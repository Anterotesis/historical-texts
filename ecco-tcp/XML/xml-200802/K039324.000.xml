<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHARP.</SPEAKER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>OW, Sir! shall you be married To-morrow? Eh, I'm afraid you joke with your poor hum∣ble Servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell thee, <HI>Sharp,</HI> last Night <HI>Melissa</HI> consented, and fixed to-morrow for the happy Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis well she did, Sir, or it might have been a dreadful one for us in our present Condition: All your Money spent; your Move∣ables sold; your Honour almost ruined, and your humble Servant almost starved; we could not possibly have stood it two Days longer—But if this young Lady will marry you and re∣lieve us, o'my Conscience I'll turn Friend to the Sex, rail no more at Matrimony, but curse the Whores, and think of a Wife myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, <HI>Sharp,</HI> when I think how I have imposed upon her, I am almost resolv'd to throw myself at her Feet, tell her the real Situation of my Affairs, ask her Pardon, and implore her Pity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>After Marriage with all my Heart, Sir; but don't let your Conscience and Honour so far get the better of your Poverty and good Sense, as to rely on so great Uncertainties as a fine Lady's Mercy and Good-nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know her generous Temper, and am almost persuaded to rely upon it: What, be∣cause I am poor, shall I abandon my Honour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, you must, Sir, or abandon me: So, pray, discharge one of us; for eat I must, and speedily too: and you know very well that that Honour of yours, will neither intro∣duce you to a great Man's Table, nor get me Credit for a single Beef-Steak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can I do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, while Honour sticks in
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
your Throat: do gulp, Master, and down with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee leave me to my Thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave you! No, not in such bad Com∣pany, I'll assure you! Why you must certainly be a very great Philosopher, Sir, to moralize and declaim so charmingly, as you do, about Honour and Conscience, when your Doors are beset with Bailiffs, and not one single Guinea in your Pocket to bribe the Villains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be witty, and give your Advice, Sirrah!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you be wise, and take it, Sir. But to be serious, you certainly have spent your Fortune, and out-liv'd your Credit, as your Pockets and my Belly can testify: Your Father has disown'd you; all your Friends for∣sook you, except myself, who am starving with you. Now, Sir, if you marry this young Lady, who as yet, thank Heaven, knows nothing of your Misfortunes, and by that means procure a better Fortune than that you squander'd a∣way, make a good Husband, and turn Oecono∣mist; you still may be happy, may still be Sir <HI>William</HI>'s Heir, and the Lady too no Lofer by the Bargain: There's Reason and Argument, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas with that Prospect I first made Love to her; and though my Fortune has been ill spent, I have, at least, purchased Discretion with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray then convince me of that, Sir, and make no more Objections to the Marriage: You see I am reduced to my Waistcoat alrea∣dy; and when Necessity has undress'd me from Top to Toe, she must begin with you; and then we shall be forced to keep House and die by Inches. Look you, Sir, if you won't re∣solve to take my Advice, while you have one Coat to your Back, I must e'en take to my Heels while I have Strength to run, and some∣thing to cover me: So, Sir, wishing you much Comfort and Consolation with your bare Con∣science, I am your most obedient and half∣starv'd Friend and Servant <STAGE>[Going.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, <HI>Sharp,</HI> you won't leave me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must eat, Sir; by my Honour and Appetite I must!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I am resolv'd to favour the Cheat, and as I shall quite change my former Course of Life, happy may be the Conse∣quences: at least of this I am sure—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you can't be worse than you are at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[A knocking without.]</STAGE> —Who's there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some of your former good Friends, who favour'd you with Money at fifty <HI>per Cent.,</HI> and helped you to spend it; and are now become daily Memento's to you of the Folly of trusting Rogues, following Whores, and laughing at my Advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cease your Impertinence! to the Door! if they are Duns, tell 'em my Marriage is now certainly fix'd, and persuade em still to forbear a few Days longer, and keep my Circumstances a Secret for their Sakes as well as my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>O never fear it, Sir; they still have so much Friendship for you, not to desire your Ruin to their own Disadvantage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you hear, <HI>Sharp;</HI> if it shou'd be any body from <HI>Melissa,</HI> say I am not at home, lest the bad Appearance we make here should make 'em suspect something to our Disadvantage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll obey you, Sir;—but I am afraid they will easily discover the consumptive Si∣tuation of our Affairs by my chop-fallen Coun∣tenance. <STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Sharp.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>These very Rascals who are now con∣tinually dunning and persecuting me, were the very Persons who led me to my Ruin, par∣took of my Prosperity, and profess'd the greatest Friendship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[without]</STAGE> Upon my word, Mrs. <HI>Kit∣ty,</HI> my Master's not at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[without.]</STAGE> Lookee, <HI>Sharp,</HI> I must and will see him!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, what do I hear? <HI>Melissa</HI>'s Maid! What has brought her here? My Poverty has made her my Enemy too—She is certainly come with no good Intent—No Friendship there, without Fees—She's coming up Stairs—What must I do?—I'll get into this Closet and listen. <STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Gayless.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE><PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<HI>Enter</HI> Sharp <HI>and</HI> Kitty.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must know where he is, and will know too, Mr. Impertinence!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not of me you won't. <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> He's not within, I tell you, Mrs. <HI>Kitty;</HI> I don't know myself: do you think I can conjure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I know you will lye abominably; therefore don't trifle with me. I come from my Mistress <HI>Melissa;</HI> you know, I suppose, what's to be done to-morrow morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and to-morrow Night too, Girl!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not if I can help it. <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> —But come where is your Master? for see him I must.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Mrs. <HI>Kitty,</HI> what's your Opi∣nion of this Match between my Master and your Mistress?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I have no Opinion of it at all; and yet most of our Wants will be reliev'd by it too: for instance now, your Master will get a Fortune, that's what I'm afraid he wants; my Mistress will get a Husband, that's what she has wanted for some time: you will have the Pleasure of my Conversation, and I an Opportunity of breaking your Head for your Impertinence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I'm your most humble Servant! But I'll tell you what, Mrs. <HI>Kitty,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
I am positively against the Match; for, was I a Man of my Master's Fortune—.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'd marry if you cou'd and mend it. Ha, ha, ha! Pray, <HI>Sharp,</HI> where does your Master's Estate lie?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh the Devil! what a Question was there! <STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lie, lie! why it lies—faith, I can't name any particular Place it lies in so many: his Effects are divided, some here, some there; his Steward hardly knows himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Scatter'd, scatter'd, I suppose. But harkee, <HI>Sharp,</HI> what's become of your Furni∣ture? You seem to be a little bare here at pre∣sent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, has she found out that too? <STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you must know, as soon as the Wedding was fixed, my Master order'd me to remove his Goods into a Friend's House, to make room for a Ball which he designs to give here the Day after the Marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>The luckiest Thing in the World! for my Mistress designs to have a Ball and En∣tertainment here to-night before the Marriage; and that's my Business with your Master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Devil it is! <STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>She'll not have it publick, she designs to invite only eight or ten Couple of Friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more: and she order'd me to de∣sire your Master not to make a great Enter∣tainment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, never fear—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ten or a Dozen little nice Things, with some Fruit, I believe, will be enough in all Conscience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, curse your Conscience! <STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what do you think I have done of my own Head?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>What?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have invited all my Lord <HI>Stately's</HI> Servants to come and see you, and have a Dance in the Kitchen: Won't your Master be surpriz'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much so indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, be quick and find out your Master, and make what haste you can with your Preparations: you have no Time to lose.—Prithee, <HI>Sharp,</HI> what's the matter with you? I have not seen you for some time, and you seem to look a little thin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh my unfortunate Face! <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> I'm in pure good Health, thank you, Mrs. <HI>Kitty;</HI> and I'll assure you, I have a very good Stomach, never better in all my Life, and I am as full of Vigour, Hussy! <STAGE>[Offers to kiss her.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, with that Face! Well, bye, bye, <STAGE>[going]</STAGE> —oh, <HI>Sharp,</HI> what ill-looking Fellows are those, were standing about your Door when
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
I came in? They want your Master too, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hum! Yes, they are waiting for him—They are some of his Tenants out of the Country that want to pay him some Money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tenants! What, do you let his Ten∣ants stand in the Street?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>They chuse it; as they seldom come to Town, they are willing to see as much of it as they can, when they o; they are raw, ignorant, honest people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I must run home, farewel!—But do your hear? Get something substantial for us in the Kitchen—a Ham, a Turkey, or what you will—We'll be very merry; and be sure remove the Tables and Chairs away there too, that we may have room to dance: I can't bear to be confined in my French Dances; tal, lal, lal, <STAGE>[dancing]</STAGE> Well, adieu! Without any Compliment I shall die if I don't see you soon. <STAGE>[Exit Kitty.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>And without any Compliment, I pray Heaven you may!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Gayless.</STAGE>
<STAGE>[They look for some Time sorrowful at each other.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sharp!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Master!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are certainly undone!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's no News to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eight or ten couple of Dancers,—ten or a dozen little nice Dishes with some Fruit—my Lord <HI>Stately</HI>'s Servants, Ham and Turkey!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more; the very Sound creates an Appetite: and I am sure of late I have had no Occasion for Whetters and Provocatives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Curs'd Misfortune! What can we do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hang ourselves; I see no other Re∣medy: except you have a Receipt to give a Ball and a Supper without Meat or Musick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Melissa</HI> has certainly heard of my bad Circumstances, and has invented this Scheme to distress me and break off the Match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't believe it, Sir; begging your Pardon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, why did her Maid then make so strict an Enquiry into my Fortune and Af∣fairs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>For two very substantial Reasons; the first, to satisfy a Curiosity, natural to her as a Woman; the second, to have the Pleasure of my Conversation, very natural to her as a Woman of Taste and Understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee be more serious: Is not our All at stake?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir: and yet that All of ours is of so little Consequence, that a Man, with a very small Share of Philosophy, may part from it without much Pain or Uneasiness.
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
However, Sir, I'll convince you in half an Hour, that Mrs. <HI>Melissa</HI> knows nothing of your Circumstances; and I'll tell you what too, Sir, she shan't be here to-night, and yet you shall marry her to-morrow Morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, how, dear Sharp.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis here, here, Sir! Warm, warm, and Delays will cool it; therefore I'll away to her, and do you be as merry as Love and Poverty will permit you.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Would you succeed, a faithful Friend depute,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Whose Head can plan, and Front can execute.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>I am the Man, and I hope you neither dis∣pute my Friendship or Qualification.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>But very easy to be explain'd.</P>

<P>Prithee explain it then, nor keep me longer in Suspence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Affair is this, Madam, Mr. <HI>Gay∣less</HI> is over Head and Ears in Debt; you are over Head and Ears in Love; you'll marry him to-morrow, the next Day your whole Fortune goes to his Creditors, and you and your Children are to live comfortably upon the Remainder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot think him base.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I know they are all base—You are very young, and very ignorant of the Sex; I am young too, but have more Experience: you never was in Love before; I have been in Love with an hundred, and try'd 'em all; and know 'em to be a Parcel of barbarous, perjured, deluding, bewitching Devils.</P>

<P>Is a Man, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope so, <HI>Kitty,</HI> or I would have no∣thing to do with him.</P>

<P>With all my Heart—I have given you my Sentiments upon the Occasion, and shall leave you to your own Inclinations.</P>
</SP>

<P>Oh, Madam, I am much oblig'd to you for your great Condescension, ha, ha, ha! However, I have so great a Regard for your Opinion, that had I certain Proofs of his Villany—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, so far from giving me the usual Perquisites of my Place, he has not so much as kept me in Temper with little endearing Ci∣vilities; and one might reasonably expect when a Man is deficient in one Way, that he should make it up in another. <STAGE>[Knocking without.</STAGE></P>

<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will assure you, Madam, I've suf∣fer'd very much in Defence of it; which is more than I would have done for my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee explain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>In short, Madam, you was seen a∣bout a Month ago, to make a visit to my Mas∣ter alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alone! my Servant was with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Mrs. <HI>Kitty?</HI> So much the worse; for she was look'd upon as my Pro∣perty; and I was brought in guilty as well as you and my Master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, your Property, Jackanapes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Madam, as I came out but now to make Preparations for you and your Company to-night; Mrs. <HI>Pryabout,</HI> the At∣torney's Wife at next Door, calls to me; Hark'ee, Fellow! says she, Do you and your modest Master know that my Husband shall indite your House, at the next Parish Meeting, for a Nusance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Nusance!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I said so—A Nusance! I believe none in the Neighbourhood live with more Decency and Regularity than I and my Mas∣ter, as is really the Case—Decency and Re∣gularity, cries she, with a Sneer,—why, Sir∣rah, does not my Window look into your Master's Bed-Chamber? And did not he bring
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
in a certain Lady, such a Day? describing you, Madam. And did not I see—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>See! Oh scandalous? What?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Modesty requires my Silence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you contradict her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Contradict her! Why, I told her I was sure she ly'd: for, zounds! said I, for I could not help swearing, I am so well convin∣ced of the Lady's and my Master's Prudence, that, I am sure, had they a mind to amuse them∣selves they would certainly have drawn the Window-Curtains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, did you say nothing else? Did not you convince her of her Error and Imper∣tinence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>She swore to such Things, that I could do nothing but swear and call Names: upon which, out-bolts her Husband upon me, with a fine taper Crab in his Hand, and fell upon me with such Violence, that, being half delirious, I made a full Confession.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>A full Confession! What did you con∣fess?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>That my Master lov'd Fornication; that you had no Aversion to it; that Mrs. <HI>Kitty</HI> was a Bawd, and your humble Servant a Pimp.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Bawd! a Bawd! Do I look like a Bawd, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, Madam, in the Scuffle, my Coat was torn to pieces as well as your Repu∣tation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you join'd to make me infa∣mous!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>For Heaven's sake, Madam, what could I do? His Proofs fell so thick upon me, as Witness my Head, <STAGE>[shewing his Head plai∣ster'd]</STAGE> that I would have given up all the Maidenheads in the Kingdom, rather than have my Brains beat to a Jelly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well!—but I'll be reveng'd!—And did not you tell your Master of this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell him! No, Madam! Had I told him, his Love is so violent for you, that he would certainly have murder'd half the At∣tornies in Town by this Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well!—But I'm resolv'd not to go to your Master's to Night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens and my Impudence be prai∣sed. <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not, Madam? If you are not guilty, face your Accusers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh the Devil! Ruin'd again! <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> To be sure, face 'em by all means, Madam—They can but be abusive, and break the Win∣dows a little:—Besides, Madam, I have thought of a Way to make this Affair quite diverting to you—I have a fine Blunderbuss charg'd with half a hundred Slugs, and my Master has a delicate large <HI>Swiss</HI> Broad Sword; and between us, Madam, we shall so pepper and slice 'em, that you will die with laughing.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, at Murder?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't fear, Madam, there will be no Murder if <HI>Sharp</HI>'s concern'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Murder, Madam! 'Tis Self defence; besides, in these Sort of Skirmishes, there are never more than two or three kill'd: for, sup∣posing they bring the whole Body of Militia upon us, down but with a Brace of them, and away fly the rest of the Covey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Persuade me never so much, I won't go; that's my Resolution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, I'll tell you what, Ma∣dam; since you are resolv'd not to go to the Supper, suppose the Supper was to come to you: 'Tis great Pity such great Preparations as Mr. <HI>Sharp</HI> has made should be thrown away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is, as you say, Mrs <HI>Kitty.</HI> But I can immediately run back and unbespeak what I have order'd; 'tis soon done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then what Excuse can I send to your Master? He'll be very uneasy at my not coming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh terribly so!—but I have it—I'll tell him you are very much out of Order—that you were suddenly taken with the Va∣pours or Qualms; or what you please, Ma∣dam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll leave it to you, <HI>Sharp,</HI> to make my Apology; and there's half a Guinea for you to help your Invention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Half a Guinea!—'Tis so long since I had any thing to do with Money, that I scarcely know the current Coin of my own Country. Oh, <HI>Sharp,</HI> what Talents hast thou! To secure thy Master; deceive his Mistress; out-lie her Chambermaid; and yet be paid for thy Honesty! But my Joy will discover me. <STAGE>[aside]</STAGE> Madam, you have eternally fix'd <HI>Timothy Sharp</HI> your most obedient humble Servant!—Oh the Delights of Impudence and a good Understanding! <STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Sharp.</STAGE></P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! Was there ever such a lying Varlet? With his Slugs and his Broad Swords; his Attorneys and broken Heads, and Nonsense! Well, Madam, are you satisfy'd now? Do you want more Proofs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of your Modesty I do: but, I find, you are resolv'd to give me none.</P>
</SP>

<P>Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see thro' your little mean Artifice: you are endeavouring to lessen Mr. <HI>Gayless</HI> in my Opinion, because he has not paid you for Services he had no Occasion for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pay me, Madam! I am sure I have very little Occasion to be angry with Mr. <HI>Gayless</HI> for not paying me, when, I believe, 'tis his general Practice.</P>

<P>We discover our Weaknesses to our Servants, make them our Confidents, put 'em upon an Equality with us, and so they become our Advisers.—<HI>Sharp</HI>'s Behaviour, tho' I seem'd to disregard it, makes me tremble with Apprehensions; and tho' I have pre∣tended to be angry with <HI>Kitty</HI> for her Ad∣vice, I think it of too much Consequence to be neglected.</P>

<P>Oh Woman, Woman, foolish Wo∣man! she'll certainly have this <HI>Gayless:</HI> nay, were she as well convinc'd of his Poverty as I am, she'd have him.—A strong Dose of Love is worse than one of Ratifia; when it once gets into our Heads, it trips up our Heels, and then Good Night to Discretion.

<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>PRithee be serious, <HI>Sharp.</HI> Hast thou really succeeded?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>To our Wishes, Sir. In short I have managed the Business with such Skill and Dex∣terity that neither your Circumstances, nor my Veracity are suspected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how hast thou excused me from the Ball and Entertainment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beyond Expectation, Sir.—But in that particular I was obliged to have re∣course to Truth, and declare the real Situation of your Affairs. I told her we had so long dis∣used our selves to dressing either Dinners or Suppers, that I was afraid we should be but aukward in our Preparations. In short, Sir,—at that instant a cursed Gnawing seized my Stomach, that I could not help telling her, that both you and myself seldom make a good Meal now-a-days once in a Quarter of a Year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hell and Confusion, have you betrayed me, Villain! Did not you tell me this Mo∣ment,
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
she did not in the least suspect my Cir∣cumstances?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more she did, Sir, till I told her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well; and was this your Skill and Dexterity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was going to tell you; but you won't hear Reason; my melancholy Face and piteous Narration had such an Effect upon her generous Bowels, that she freely forgives all that's past.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does she, <HI>Sharp?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and desires never to see your Face again; and, as a farther Consideration for so doing, she has sent you Half-a-Guinea. <STAGE>(<HI>shews the Money.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean?</P>

<P>To spend it, spend it, Sir; and re∣gale.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Villain, you have undone me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, by bringing you Money, when you are not worth a Farthing in the whole World? Well, well, then to make you happy again, I'll keep it myself; and wish Some-body would take it in their Head to load me with such Misfortunes. <STAGE>(<HI>puts up the Money.</HI>)</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you laugh at me, Rascal?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who deserves more to be laugh'd at? Ha, ha, ha. Never for the future, Sir, dispute the Success of my Negociations,
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
when even you, who know me so well, can't help swallowing my Hook. Why, Sir, I could have play'd with you backwards and forwards at the End of my Line, till I had put your Senses into such a Fermentation, that you should not have known in an Hour's Time, whether you was a Fish or a Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what is all this you have been telling me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>A down-right Lye from Beginning to End.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you really excused me to her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; but I have got this Half Guinea to make her Excuses to you; and, in∣stead of a Confederacy between you and me to deceive her, she thinks she has brought me over to put the Deceit upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou excellent Fellow!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't lose Time, but slip out of the House immediately; the Back-way, I believe, will be the safest for you, and to her as fast as you can; pretend vast Surprize and Con∣cern, that her Indisposition has debarr'd you the Pleasure of her Company here to Night: You need know no more; away!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not for the World, Sir; my Mistress was sensible you must have provided for her, and the rest of the Company; so she is resolv∣ed, tho' she cant', the other Ladies and Gen∣tlemen shall partake of your Entertainment; she's very good natur'd.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>To-morrow, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you'll oblige me, Sir, by never seeing her again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you call this a small Favour, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>A meer Trifle, Sir—breaking of Contracts, suing for Divorces, committing A∣dultery, and such like, are all reckon'd Trifles now-a-days; and smart young Fellows, like you and myself, <HI>Gayless,</HI> should be never out of Fashion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray, Sir, how are you concern∣ed in this Affair!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Sir, you must know I have a very great Regard for <HI>Melissa,</HI> and, indeed, she for me; and by the by, I have a most despicable Opinion of you; for, <HI>entre nous,</HI> I take you, <HI>Charles,</HI> to be a very great Scoundrel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, don't look fierce, Sir! and give yourself Airs—Damme, Sir, I shall be through your Body else in the snapping of a Finger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll be as quick as you, Villain! <STAGE>[<HI>Draws and makes at</HI> Melissa.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, hold, Murder! you'll kill my Mistress—the young Gentleman I mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! her Mistress! <STAGE>[Drops his Sword.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! <HI>Melissa!</HI> nay, then drive away Cart.—All's over now.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter all the Company laughing.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gad.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Mr. <HI>Gayless,</HI> engaging with <HI>Melissa</HI> before your Time. Ah, ah, ah!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your humble Servant, good Mr. Politician, <STAGE>[<HI>to</HI> Sharp.]</STAGE> This is, Gentlemen and Ladies, the most celebrated and ingenious <HI>Ti∣mothy Sharp,</HI> Schemer General and redoubted Squire to the most renowned and fortunate Adventurer <HI>Charles Gayless,</HI> Knight of the Woeful Countenance: Ha, ha, ha!—Oh that dismal Face, and more dismal Head of yours. <STAGE>[<HI>Strikes</HI> Sharp <HI>upon the Head.</HI>]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis cruel in you to disturb a Man in his last Agonies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Mr. <HI>Gayless!</HI>—what, not a Word! you are sensible I can be no Stranger to your Misfortunes, and I might reasonably expect an Excuse for your ill Treatment of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam, Silence is my only Re∣fuge; for to endeavour to vindicate my Crimes would shew a greater Want of Virtue than even the Commission of 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, <HI>Gayless!</HI> 'twas poor to impose upon a Woman, and one that lov'd you too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh most unpardonable; but my Ne∣cessities—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>And mine, Madam, were not to be match'd, I'm sure, o' this side starving.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>His Tears have softned me at once—Your Necessities, Mr. <HI>Gayless,</HI> with such real Contrition are too powerful Motives not to affect the Breast already prejudic'd in your Fa∣vour—You have suffer'd too much already for your Extravagance; and as I take part in your
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
Sufferings, 'tis easing myself to relieve you: know therefore, all that's past I freely for∣give.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot mean it sure; I am lost in Wonder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prepare yourself for more Wonder—You have another Friend in Masquerade here: Mr. <HI>Cook,</HI> pray throw aside your Drunkenness, and make your sober Appearance—Don't you know that Face, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cook.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Master, what, have you forgot your Friend <HI>Dick,</HI> as you us'd to call me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>More Wonder indeed! don't you live with my Father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel</SPEAKER>
<P>Just after your hopeful Servant there had left me, comes this Man from Sir <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> with a Letter to me; upon which (be∣ing by that wholly convinced of your neces∣sitous Condition) I invented, by the Help of <HI>Kitty</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Gadabout,</HI> this little Plot, in which your Friend <HI>Dick</HI> there has acted Mi∣racles, resolving to teaze you a little, that you might have a greater Relish for a happy Turn in your Affairs. Now, Sir, read that Letter, and compleat your Joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Reads]</STAGE><HI>Madam, I am Father to the unfortunate young Man, who, I hear by a Friend of mine (that by my Desire, has been a continual Spy upon him) is making his Ad∣dresses to you; if he is so happy as to make himself agreeable to you (whose Character I am charm'd</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
<HI>with) I shall own him with Joy for my Son, and forget his former Follies.</HI> I am, Madam, Your most Humble Servant. <HI>William Gayless.</HI></P>
<P>P.S. <HI>I will be soon in Town myself to con∣gratulate his Reformation and Marriage.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>Oh, <HI>Melissa,</HI> this is too much; thus let me shew my Thanks and Gratitude, <STAGE>[Kneeling, she raises him]</STAGE> for here 'tis only Due.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Reprieve! a Reprieve! a Re∣prieve!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been, Sir, a most bitter Ene∣my to you; but since you are likely to be a little more conversant with Cash than you have been, I am now with the greatest Since∣rity your most obedient Friend and humble Servant. And I hope, Sir, all former Enmity will be forgotten.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Mrs. <HI>Pry,</HI> I have been too much indulged with Forgiveness myself not to for∣give lesser Offences in other People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, Madam, since my Ma∣ster has vouchsaf'd Pardon to your Handmaid <HI>Kitty,</HI> I hope you'll not deny it to his Foot∣man <HI>Timothy.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon! for what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only for telling you about ten thou∣sand Lies, Madam, and, among the rest, in∣sinuating that your Ladyship would—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you: and can forgive any thing, <HI>Sharp,</HI> that was design'd for the Service of your Master; and if <HI>Pry</HI> and you will follow our Example, I'll give her a small Fortune as a Reward for both your Fide∣lities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy, Madam, 'twould be better to half the small Fortune between us, and keep us both single; for as we shall live in the same House, in all probability we may taste the Comforts of Matrimony, and not be troubled with its Inconveniencies; what say you, <HI>Kitty?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you hear, <HI>Sharp,</HI> before you talk of the Comforts of Matrimony, taste the Comforts of a good Dinner, and recover your Flesh a little; do, Puppy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Devil backs her, that's certain; and I am no Match for her at any Weapon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, Mr. <HI>Gayless,</HI> to shew I have not provided for you by halves, let the Musick prepare themselves, and, with the Approbation of the Company, we'll have a Dance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>All.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means, a Dance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gut.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means a Dance; after Supper tho'.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, pray, Sir, have Supper first, or, I'm sure, I shan't live till the Dance is finished.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Behold, <HI>Melissa,</HI> as sincere a Convert as ever Truth and Beauty made. The wild
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>
impetuous Sallies of my Youth are now blown over, and a most pleasing Calm of perfect Happiness succeeds.</P>
</SP>
<LG>
<L><HI>Thus</HI> Aetna<HI>'s</HI> Flames <HI>the verdant Earth consume,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But milder Heat makes drooping Nature bloom:</HI></L>
