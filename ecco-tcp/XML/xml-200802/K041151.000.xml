<L>In antient days, when She, the Queen endu'd</L>
<L>With more than female fortitude,</L>
<L>Bonduca led her painted ranks to fight;</L>

<L>Pallas descended from the realms of light,</L>

<L>The Goddess sought a cooling stream,</L>
<L>By chance, inviting with their glassy gleam,</L>
<L>Fair Isis' waters flow'd not far away.</L>
<L>Eager she view'd the wave,</L>
<L>On the cool bank she bar'd her breast,</L>

<L>Her accents Isis' calm attention caught,</L>
<L>As lonesome, in her secret cell,</L>

<L>She rose, and sweetly smil'd</L>
<L>With a many a lovely look,</L>

<L>She smil'd, and gave the goddess in her flood</L>
