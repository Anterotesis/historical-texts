<HEAD>To the Right Honourable ARTHUR Lord <HI>ALTHAM,</HI> BARON of <HI>ALTHAM,</HI> In the Kingdom of IRELAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>POetry,</HI> in its first Institution, was prin∣cipally design'd to Correct, and rectify Manners. Thence it was that the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Athenian Stages</HI> were accounted Schools of Divinity and Mora∣lity; where the Tragick Writers of those Days inspired their Audiences with <HI>Noble</HI> and <HI>Heroick Sentiments,</HI> and the <HI>Comick</HI> laugh'd and diverted them out of their <HI>Vices;</HI> and by rediculing <HI>Folly, Intemperence,</HI> and <HI>De∣bauchery,</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
gave them an Indignation for those Irregularities, and made them pursue the opposite <HI>Virtues.</HI></P>
<P>This caus'd the <HI>Dramatic Poets,</HI> in anci∣ent Times, not only to be reverenc'd by the lower sort of People, but highly Esteem'd and Courted by Persons of the first Rank; and tho' the Writers of latter Ages, have, in a greater Measure, not to say in a scandelous Manner, deviated from the Foot-steps, and Examples of their Pre∣decessors; yet have they found Protection and Favour with those, who have been so Generous as to ascribe the Faults of the <HI>Po∣ets</HI> to the Degeneracy of the <HI>Age</HI> wherein they liv'd.</P>
<P>This consideration, <HI>my Lord,</HI> has im∣bolden'd me to this Address, for tho' on the one Hand I am sensible, that the fol∣lowing Piece does little Merit your <HI>Lord∣ship</HI>'s Patronage; yet your innate Goodness and Generosity give me hopes, that your Lordship will Pardon this Intrusion, in
<PB REF="5"/>
which I have the Examples of all those that <HI>wrote</HI> before me to bear me out. I heartily wish this Play were more worthy of your <HI>Lordship</HI>'s Acceptance: Yet so much, I hope, will be forgiven to the fondness of a Mother for her Production; if, I say, in its Favour, that through the whole Piece, I have had a tender regard to good Manners, and by the main Drift of it, endeavour'd to Redicule and Correct one of the most reigning Vices of the Age. I might say, as many of my <HI>Brethren</HI> have done upon slighter Grounds, that this Play has had the good Fortune to Please and Di∣vert the Nicest, and Politest Part of the Town; but I should set little Stress on their Applause, had I not some reason to de∣pend upon your <HI>Lordship</HI>'s Approbation, whose Judgement, Penetration and Dis∣cernment, are alone sufficient to do full Justice to a performance of this Kind.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>
And now, my <HI>Lord,</HI> if I follow'd the beaten Road of Dedicators, it would natu∣rally Engage me in a <HI>Panegirick,</HI> upon your Lordship's Personal Virtues, and those of your <HI>Noble</HI> and <HI>Pious Family;</HI> but I shall purposely decline a Talk to which I freely own my Ability is Unequal, and which, tho' manag'd by a <HI>Masterly Pen,</HI> would make your Modesty suffer. There∣fore I shall conclude, with begging your <HI>Lordship</HI>'s leave to Subscribe my self, with all imaginable Respect and Sincerity.</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your Lordship's most Obedient, and most Devoted Humble Servant,</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoke by Mr. <HI>Penkethman.</HI></STAGE>
<L>IN all the Faces that to Plays Resort,</L>
<L>Whether of Country, City, Mob or Court;</L>
<L>I've always found that none such hopes Inspire,</L>
<L>As you—dear Brethren of the Upper Tire.</L>
<L>Poets in Prologues, may both Preach and Rail,</L>
<L>Yet all their Wisdom, nothing will avail,</L>
<L>Who writes not up to you, 'tis ten to one will fail.</L>
<L>Your thundring plaudit 'tis that deals out Fame,</L>
<L>You make Plays run, tho' of themselves but Lame:</L>
<L>How often have we known your Noise Commanding,</L>
<L>Impose on your Inferior Masters Understanding;</L>
<L>Therefore, Dear Brethren, (since I am one of you)</L>
<L>Whether adorn'd in Grey, Green, Brown or Blue,</L>
<L>This day stand all by me, as I will fall by you,</L>
<L>And now to let—</L>
<L>The poor Pit see how Pinky's Voice Commands,</L>
<L>Silence—Now rattle all your Sticks, and clap your grimy Hands▪</L>
<L>I greet your Love—and let the vainest Author show,</L>
<L>Half this Command on clearer Hands below,</L>
<L>Nay, more to prove your Interest, let this Play live by you.</L>
<L>So may you share good Claret with your Masters,</L>
<L>Still free in your Amours from their Disasters;</L>
<L>Free from poor House-keeping, where Peck is under Locks▪</L>
<L>Free from Cold Kitchings, and no Christmas Box:</L>
<L>So may no long Debates i'th' House of Commons,</L>
<L>Make you in the Lobby Starve, when hungar Summons:</L>
<L>But may your plentious Vails come flowing in,</L>
<L>Give you a lucky hit, and make you Gentlemen;</L>
<L>And thus preferr'd, ne'er fear the World's Reproaches,</L>
<L>But shake your Elbows with my Lord, and keep your Coaches:</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoke by Mr. <HI>Esthcourt.</HI></STAGE>
<L>THis goodly Fabrick to a gazing Tarr,</L>
<L>Seems Fore and Aft, a Three Deckt-man os War.</L>
<L>Abaft, the Hold's the Pit, from thence look up,</L>
<L>Aloft! that Swabber's Nest, that's the Main-Top.</L>
<L>Side-boxes mann'd with Beau, and modish Rake,</L>
<L>Are like the Fore-castle, and Quarter-Deck.</L>
<L>Those dark disguised, advent'rous, black-nos'd few,</L>
<L>May pass for Gunners, or a Fire-ship's Crew.</L>
<L>Some come like Privateers a Prize to seize,</L>
<L>And catch the <HI>French</HI> within the Narrow Seas.</L>
<L>The Orange-Ladies, Virgins of Renown,</L>
<L>Are Powder-Monkies running up and down.</L>
<L>We've here our Calms, our Storms, and prosp'rous Gales,</L>
<L>And shift our Scenes as Seamen shift their Sails.</L>
<L>The Ship's well mann'd, and not ill Woman'd neither,</L>
<L>So Ballast'd and Stow'd, my Lads, she'll bear the Weather.</L>
<L>But greater Dangers ventring Players alarm,</L>
<L>This Night's Engagement's worse than any Storm.</L>
<L>The Poet's Captain, but half dead with fright,</L>
<L>She leaves her Officers to maintain the Fight;</L>
<L>Yon'd middle Teer with Eighteen Pounders mauls us,</L>
<L>That Upper-Deck with Great and Small-Shot gauls us.</L>
<L>But from this Lower-Teer most Harm befals,</L>
<L>There's no opposing their prevailing Balls.</L>
<L>As either Foe or Friend their Chain-shot flies,</L>
<L>We sink or swim, we Conquer, Fall or Rise.</L>
<L>To fit and rig our Ships much Pains we take;</L>
<L>Grant we may now a Saving-Voyage make.</L>
<L>Here we're Embark'd, and as you Smile or Frown,</L>
<L>You are our Stars, by You we Live or Drown.</L>

<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you look me in the Face, and ask me that Question? Can you that keep a Basset-Table, a publick Gaming-House, be insensible of the shame on't? I have often told you how much the vast concurse of Peo∣ple, which Day and Night make my House their Ren∣devouze, incommode my Health; your Apartment is a Pa∣rade for Men of all Ranks, from the Duke to the Fidler, and your Vanity thinks they all pay Devoir to your Beau∣ty—but you mistake, every one has his several end in Meet∣ing here, from the Lord to the Sharper, and each their seperate Interest to Admire—some Fools there may be, for there's seldom a crowd without.</P>

<P>To be seen there every Night, in my Opinion, is more destructive to the Reputation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I had rather be noted every Night in the front Box, then, by my absence, once be suspected of Ga∣ming; one ruins my Estate and Character, the other di∣verts my Temper, and improves my Mind. Then you have such a number of Lovers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh <HI>Cupid,</HI> is it a Crime to have a number of Lovers? If it be, 'tis the pleasantest Crime in the World. A Crime that falls not every day, to every Womans Lot.</P>

<P>I slight the malicious Censure of the Town, yet defy it to asperse my Verture; Nature has given me a Face, a Shape, a Mein, an Air for Dress, and Wit and Hu∣mour to subdue. And shall I lose my Conquest for a Name.</P>
</SP>

<P>Nay, and among the unfashionable sort of People too, Madam; for Persons of Breeding and Quality will allow, that Gallantry and Virtue are not inseperable.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Coquetry and Reputation are, and there is no differerence in the Eye of the World, between ha∣ving really committed the Fault, and lying under the Scan∣dal; for, my own part, I would take as much Care to pre∣serve my Fame, as you would your Virtue.</P>

<P>A little pains will serve you for that, Cousin; for I never once heard you nam'd—A Mortification would break my Heart, ha, ha.</P>

<P>'Tis better never to be nam'd, than to be ill spoke of; but your Reflections shall not Disorder my Tem∣per. I could wish, indeed, to convince you of your Error, because you share my Blood; but since I see the Vanity of the attempt, I shall desist.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou hast hit it, <HI>James,</HI> I confess I love her Per∣son, but hate her Humours, and her way of Living; I have some reasons to believe I'm not indifferent to her, yet I despair of fixing her, her Vanity has got so much the Mistress of her Resolution; and yet her Passion for Gain furmounts her Pride, and lays her Reputation open to the World. Every Fool that has ready Money, shall dare to boast himself her very humble Servant; 'ds Death, when I could cut the Rascal's Throat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir James.</SPEAKER>
<P>your Lordship is even with her one Way, for you are as testy as she's vain, and as fond of an opportu∣nity to Quarrel with her, as she of a Gaming Acquaintance; my Opinion is, my Lord, she'll ne're be won your Way.</P>
<L>To gain all Women there's a certain Rule,</L>
<L>If Wit should sail to please, then Act the Fool;</L>
<L>And where you find simplicity not take,</L>
<L>Throw off Disguises—and Profess the Rake;</L>
<L>Observe which Way their chiefest Humours run,</L>
<L>They're by their own lov'd, can't the surest Way undone.</L>

<P>That she has—A large Portion, and as much Cunning, or she could never have manag'd the old Fellow so nicely; she has a vast Passion for my Lady <HI>Re∣veller,</HI> and endeavours to mimick her in every thing—Not a sute of Cloaths, or a Top-knot, that is not exactly the same with hers—then her Plots and Contrivances to supply these Expences, puts her continually upon the Rack; yet to give her her due, she has a fertile Brain that Way; but come, shall we go home and sleep two or three Hours, at Dinner I'll introduce you to Capt. <HI>Hearty,</HI> the Sea Officer, your Rival that is to be, he's just come to Town.</P>

<P>In a Raffling-shop she saw a young Gentleman, which she said was very handsom—At the same time, my Lord, prais'd a young Lady; she redoubles her Commen∣dations of the Beau—He enlarges on the Beauty of the Bell; their Discourse grew warm on the subject; they Pause; she begins again with the Perfections of the Gentle∣man; he ends with the same of the Lady; Thus they per∣su'd their Arguments, still finding such mighty Charms in their new Favourites, till they found one another so Ugly—so Ugly—that they parted with full Resolutions never to meet again.</P>
