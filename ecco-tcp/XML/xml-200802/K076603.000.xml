<HEAD>Mr. <HI>WHISTON</HI>'s LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>INCE your Lordship had so very con∣siderable a Share in the late Debates in the House of Peers, in <HI>Opposition</HI> to a Clause for the Toleration of the <HI>Christi∣an Religion itself,</HI> or of all that <HI>believed the Holy Scrip∣tures and the Common Creed</HI>; which I confess I had a great Hand in preparing and recommending, could it have been admitted; and in <HI>Behalf</HI> of a new <HI>Atha∣nasian Test</HI> to be laid upon Christians; whereby, with the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> they were to pro∣fess <HI>Faith in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ, his Eternal Son, the True God; and in the Holy Spirit; One God Blessed for evermore:</HI> Since your Lordship had also the like Share in a late heavy Imputation laid on Dr. <HI>C—</HI> in the same House of Peers, for omitting the Holy Spirit in Doxologies; where yet that Imputation lay harder on my self, nay indeed on St. <HI>Paul</HI> and all the Apostles themselves than on Dr. <HI>C—</HI>: He having only omitted the Holy Spi∣rit in his Doxologics <HI>sometimes,</HI> but I, in Imitation of those Apostles, never making him the direct <HI>Ob∣ject</HI> of any Doxology at all. And since your Lord∣ship's
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
Chaplain, Mr. <HI>Seaton,</HI> has lately publish'd an <HI>Essay on the Eternity of the Son of God,</HI> address'd to the Laity of this City; and written, I must confess, in a cool and sober Manner; but as it were in Vin∣dication of such your Lordship's Proceedings: I think it cannot, on all these Accounts, be impro∣per for me, who so greatly dissent from your Lord∣ship and your Chaplain in these Matters, to address this Paper to your Lordship, and therein to lay be∣fore you and the Christian World a fair Collection of the sacred and primitive Testimonies concerning this important Point; I mean, whether God the Father be the only Eternal Being, the only Eternal God; or whether the Son and Holy Spirit be also Eternal Beings, or be <HI>Coeternal</HI> with the Father, as all the real <HI>Trinitarians</HI> assert. I say <HI>real Trinitarians</HI> only: for as for the nominal or modal Trinitarians, which also include the <HI>Sabellians</HI> and <HI>Socinians,</HI> and are now the most numerous, who say the Son and Spirit are not really different from, but are, or make up, together with the Father, the One Eter∣nal God, there is no room for the Question among them at all: It being the absurdest Thing in the World to suppose that God is not coeternal to him∣self, tho' the Expression be somewhat extraordinary. Now, in order to satisfy your Lordship and the World in this Matter, I shall beg Leave at present to wave the common Method of disputing, and ar∣guing, and pleading, and drawing uncertain Con∣sequences on either Side, and shall set down, instead thereof, a Collection of those original Texts and Testimonies which relate to this important Do∣ctrine; that so every one may, with his own natu∣ral common Sense and Judgment, and without Fear of being impos'd upon by modern Inferences, im∣partially pronounce on which Side the superior E∣vidence lies. Your Lordship well knows that Truth is best discover'd by the open, fair, and solemn Way of Proceedings in Courts of Justice; where the Evidence for Facts is still enquir'd into and ex∣amin'd from Eye and Ear-Witnesses, or from the authentick Records themselves produc'd in Court;
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
where the Judges determine of those Facts intirely by that original Evidence; and where all that the Pleaders <HI>allege</HI> about those Facts goes for nothing, any farther than it is thus <HI>proved.</HI> Now, what was the Doctrine of our Blessed Saviour and his Apo∣stles, or what was the Christian Faith in this Mat∣ter, is certainly at this Day an ancient Fact; and no otherwise to be now known but by ancient Evidence, primitive Witnesses, and original Records still re∣maining. To these therefore do I solemnly Appeal in the present Question; and by these and these only do I resolve to be determin'd therein. And this Method is so evidently fair and reasonable, that I cannot but hope that your Lordship and all equi∣table Enquirers will also approve of it, and be willing to be determin'd by it. Nor do I mean this with Regard to the present Doctrine, or the real and strict <HI>Coeternity</HI> of the Son and Holy Spirit to the Father only; but with Regard to all the like controverted Points in Christianity also: which can, I think, be no other way so authentickly, so sa∣tisfactorily, and so peaceably determined among Christians as by this Procedure; especially while in this Method the Meaning of doubtful Words and Phrases are to be stated no otherwise than by the ancient Use of the same; and no modern Distincti∣ons or Evasions unsupported by Antiquity, will be admitted: and where no later Translations will be of Weight, any farther than they are supported by the primary Sense of the Original, in the Ages wherein the Books themselves were written.</P>
<P>I therefore, upon this Occasion, in the most, pub∣lick and open Manner, in the Behalf of my self and of others of my Opinion, as to the Points now in Dispute among us, do, before your Lordship, and before the Christian World, invite all the so∣ber and learned <HI>Athanasians</HI> to come into this Propo∣sal; I mean, that omitting all the Passions, the Tricks, the Subtilties, the Distinctions and Evasions of the Pleaders or <HI>Disputers of this World,</HI> they will join with us in a calm, a fair, an authentick, a friendly, and a Christian Examination of these Points in the
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
Bible and primitive Antiquity; and in drawing up, after such an Examination, an upright, impartial, and full Collection of all the ancient Texts and Te∣stimonies, before the Days of <HI>Athanasius,</HI> which concern the same; to be by joint Consent laid be∣fore the World; with the bare summing up the E∣vidence on both Sides, as the Judges themselves do in their Courts, without any other Comments or Colours of our own whatsoever.</P>
<P>Thus, for Example, the whole Christian Church, My Lord, did ever, and does still unanimously own, that there is but <HI>One,</HI> Eternal, Omnipotent, Invisible, and Almighty <HI>God</HI>; the original Cause and Creator of all other Beings: While many of the <HI>Trinitarians</HI> now affirm, that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, taken together, are that <HI>One God</HI>; and we, on the other Side, assert that God the Fa∣ther, and He alone, is that <HI>One God.</HI> Here, My Lord, we insist, that the present <HI>Trinitarians</HI> may produce all those original Texts of Scripture, all those ancient Creeds, and all those primitive Testi∣monies, which affirm the former: and we will be oblig'd to produce, in the same Manner, all those original Texts of Scripture, all those ancient Creeds, and all those primitive Testimonies which affirm the latter: And this is desir'd as to both Sides, without the Admission of any novel Distinctions, Evasions, or Inferences whatsoever: that so Christian People may have the Cause wholly before them, and may be enabled to determine sairly and impartially on which Side the <HI>superior Evidence</HI> appears to be; by which superior Evidence all certainly ought to be guided in such Matters. And the like Procedure I would recommend in all parallel Cases whatsoe∣ver.</P>
<P>And indeed, My Lord, this seems to me to be the only honest and Christian Method of disentang∣ling these and the like Points from the Sophistry of captious Arguments, Replies, and Rejoinders, with which the Writers of Controversy do on all Sides, more or less, perplex and puzzle, but not properly satisfy their Readers. And this Method,
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
I confess, My Lord, I have had principally in my Eye from the very Beginning of my Concern in the present Controversy; tho' the Pamphlets written against me have sometimes turn'd me from that my main Design, and, as it were, forc'd me, in some Degree, to comply with the common Method. I now therefore, My Lord, intend to reassume what I at first propos'd to my self; and, as I have lately, which Your Lordship will see by the enclos'd, laid the State of the Old Christian Doxologies before the World, exactly as I found it in the New Testament, and in the most early Antiquity; without pretend∣ing, from any Reasonings of my own, to introduce one single Form, different from what I there found upon Record; So do I here design to lay before Your Lordship and the World, with equal Fair∣ness, what I meet with in the first Ages concerning this important Point of the strict <HI>Coeternity</HI> of the Son and Holy Spirit to the Father. I say, the strict <HI>Coeternity</HI> only; for as to the Preexistence of our Saviour before all <HI>Time,</HI> and all <HI>Ages,</HI> even those the Antients called <HI>Eternal Times,</HI> with St. <HI>Paul,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. I. 2.</NOTE> or <HI>before the World</HI> with all its Creatures and Ages <HI>be∣gan,</HI> as our Version well renders that Passage, this is not the Question. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. I. 2.</NOTE> It being allowed on both Sides that this World, with all its Creatures and Ages whatsoever, were <HI>made,</HI> under the Father, by the Son; who must therefore, of Necessity, be before the same, without the least Consequence to be thence deduc'd that he was therefore <HI>really eternal,</HI> or truly <HI>coeternal</HI> with his Father.</P>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> I do not quote the smaller Epistles of <HI>Igna∣tius,</HI> nor some pretended Passages out of <HI>Hippolytus, Dionysius Alexandrinus, &amp;c.</HI> they being liable to too many Objections as to their Genuineness, to bear any Weight in this or any such Controversy what∣soever.</P>
<P>I begin with those Texts of Scripture which Your Lordship's Chaplain, Mr. <HI>Seaton,</HI> has cited for the <HI>Eternity of the Son:</HI> and shall set them down both as they stand in our <HI>English</HI> Bible, and as they more authentickly appear in the Septuagint Ver∣sion,
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
which alone was made Use of by Christ and his Apostles. To which I shall add what other Pas∣sages occur in the Bible or earliest Antiquity, that seem most to favour the same Eternity, till the very Days of <HI>Athanasius.</HI></P>

learn'd from you also, is this. We own but One God, who is alone Unbegotten, who is alone E∣ternal, who is alone without Beginning, who is alone the true God, who alone has Immortality, who alone is Wise, who alone is Good, who alone is the Potentate, who is the Judge, the Orderer and Disposer of all Things: Immutable and Unal∣terable, Righteous and Good, the God of the Law and the Prophets, and of the new Covenant; who begat his only begotten Son before the World be∣gan: By whom he made the Ages and the Uni∣verse. Begat him, we mean, not in Appearance only, but Reality; giving him his Subsistence by his own Will; the Immutable, and Unalterable, and Perfect Creature of God, but not as one of the ordinary Creatures: A Being begotten by him, but not as one of the ordinary Beings which were begotten. Not that this Being begotten was an Emanation, as was the Doctrine of <HI>Valentinus</HI>; nor, as <HI>Manichaeus</HI> suppos'd, is the Being begotten a Consubstantial Part of the Father: Nor, as <HI>Sabel∣lius,</HI> who divided the Unity, and call'd him both Son and Father: Nor, as <HI>Hieraeas,</HI> Light from a Light, or as one Lamp divided into two: Nor, as one that before was, yet afterward was begotten, or created into a Son. As even you your self, Blessed Father, in the midst of the Church, and in the Assembly of the Clergy, have frequently re∣jected those who introduc'd these Opinions. But, as we say, that he was Created by the Will of God before Time, and before the World began; and that he receiv'd his Life, and his Being, and all his Glory from the Father. For the Father, when he made him Heir of all Things, did not deprive himself of any Thing which he has in himself, without being begotten. For He is the Fountain of all Things. Wherefore there are three Substan∣ces, and God himself, who is the Cause of all Things, is alone without Beginning. But the Son being begotten by the Father before Time, and created and founded before the World began, was not before he was begotten; but he alone, as
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
begotten before Time by the Father, did really subsist; for he is not eternal, or co-eternal, or unbegotten as the Father is; nor has he his Ex∣istence together with the Father, as some say; who after a sort introduce two unbegotten Principles; but God is so before all Things as the only Being, and the Beginning of all Things. <HI>Wherefore he is before his Son, as we have learn'd from you, when you have preach'd in the midst of the Church.</HI> In as much, therefore, as he has his Being, and all his Glory, and his Life from God; and all Things are deliver'd to him, thence is God his Origin and Governor; for he governs him as his God, and as being <HI>Prior</HI> to him. But if that Expression, <HI>From him</HI>; and that, <HI>From the Womb</HI>; and that, <HI>I came out from the Father, and come</HI>; are understood as implying his being a con∣substantial Part of him, as an Emanation; the Fa∣ther is a compound Being, capable of Division, and Mutable; and, indeed, according to them, a Body: And so, as far as their Notions extend, the Incorporeal God is liable to Corporeal Af∣fections.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Theodor. Hist. Eccl.

<P>These, my Lord, are the principal original Texts and Testimonies which concern the important Sub∣ject before us, till the very Days of <HI>Athanasius</HI> himself.</P>
<P>And now, to sum up the Evidence on both Sides, with what Clearness I can, the Evidence for the Co-eternity of the Son to the Father, which has been above alledg'd; I mean, if, as we ought to do, we take the <HI>Septuagint</HI> Version, whence Christ, and his Apostles, and the ancient Fathers, always quoted the Old Testament, to be of more Authority than our own, or any modern ones, in such Matters, comes to no more than this: <HI>Viz.</HI> That our Saviour was <HI>created</HI> or <HI>begotten</HI> by his Father <HI>in</HI> or <HI>before the Beginning of the World; before</HI> all the <HI>Ages,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. i. 2.</NOTE> or that first Constitution of Things which was made or ordain'd by him under the Father: That he was to be the <HI>Father of the future Age,</HI> or <HI>World to come,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. ii. 5.</NOTE> which we call the <HI>last Age,</HI> or <HI>Days of the Messiah</HI>: That his Origin was <HI>of Old, from the Beginning of the World:</HI> That he <HI>was</HI> in Be∣ing, and was <HI>with God</HI> his Father in the very <HI>Be∣ginning</HI> of Things; nay, had <HI>Glory with his Father before the World was:</HI> That he was <HI>before all Things</HI>; that he was the <HI>first,</HI> and will be the <HI>last:</HI> That he was <HI>Alpha,</HI> and will be <HI>Omega:</HI> And that some of these Expressions are the same, or very like to
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
those, by which the absolute Eternity of the Fa∣ther is in other Places suppos'd to be express'd; which last Observation, however, is only here taken for granted, without Proof: It no Way ap∣pearing that the sacred Writers meddle, beyond our Faculties, with any such absolute Eternity, ei∣ther <HI>a parte ante,</HI> or <HI>a parte post,</HI> as the School-men have since done; and yet without the Proof of that Point all this Evidence is very inconsiderable.</P>
<P>It must also be remembred, that the ancient Christians ever allow'd that the Expressions in the Old Testament, concerning the invisible Father, whenever there was a visible Person appear'd, were spoken by the Son, as the <HI>Image of that invisible God,</HI> or as representing and personating the Father, as his Minister and Vicegerent among Men: and that they never look'd on them as true, in the high∣est Sense, of the Son himself, but of the Father only: Nor did they ever draw such Consequences from those Texts as do the Moderns.</P>
<P><HI>Melchisedek</HI> is, indeed, said to have <HI>neither Be∣ginning of Days, nor End of Life,</HI> when he is repre∣sented as a Type of Christ's earliest Origin and latest Duration; but this certainly without the least Pretence to any proper Eternity of his at all. So that the known Books of the Old and New Testament, as understood before the Days of <HI>Atha∣nasius,</HI> seem to have no proper Evidence at all for the real Eternity of the Son of God. As for <HI>Po∣lycarp</HI>'s and <HI>Justin</HI>'s Expressions of Christ, that he is the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the <HI>eternal</HI> Priest, or High Priest, no wise Man will thence gather any Thing about the real Eternity of the Son, before he was an <HI>High Priest.</HI> The Author of the Recognitions also speaks of the Eternity of the Son, and calls him the <HI>eternal Christ</HI>: But then, it is well known, that he did not thereby mean his real Co-eterni∣ty, <HI>a parte ante,</HI> with his Father: Nay, it has ap∣pear'd already, that of all the Ancients he is the most express for his being a Creature; and he therefore hereby rather gives us a Rule how we ought to explain such Words in other ancient Au∣thors,
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
while they seldom or never mean, by such Expressions, more than from the Beginning of the World, or to the End of it. <HI>Irenaeus</HI> does, in∣deed, say not only that Christ was God's <HI>eternal Word,</HI> but that he was <HI>unmade,</HI> or, as I suppose he means, <HI>not made out of nothing,</HI> as he supposed Men to be; that he did <HI>always co-exist with God,</HI> and was <HI>ever with him</HI>; and avoided saying that God <HI>created him,</HI> which the rest used freely to say in those A∣ges: All this makes it very probable that this Fa∣ther did believe the Eternity of the Son, in some Sort or other. But then, it must not be dissem∣bled, that even <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> as we have seen, owns him a derived Being, produc'd by his Father be∣fore all other Beings: Which seems hardly recon∣cilable to an absolute Co-eternity: And that this Sort of Eternity of the <HI>Word,</HI> which we meet with in some such Philosophers of the second, third, and fourth Century, is quite another Thing from the real <HI>Co-eternity of the Son</HI> under our present Consideration: As is most obvious in the ancient Accounts of that Matter. Their Notion was plain∣ly this; that all other Beings were made out of nothing; but that the Son was in a subtile man∣ner <HI>in</HI> his Father, virtually, potentially, or, as his internal Word and Wisdom from all Eternity; and that a little before the Creation, and not sooner, this Word was, in an ineffable manner, begotten or created, out of his Substance, into a real subsisting Being, or Person: So that the Te∣stimonies for this Sort of Eternity, which alone we find even till a good while after the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> it self, are a Demonstration that the <HI>real Co-eternity</HI> of the Son with the Father, or his pro∣per <HI>eternal Generation,</HI> was then utterly unknown among Christians. Nor does even this metaphy∣sick, this virtual, or potential, or internal Eter∣nity of the Son ever appear in the sacred Writings; in the ancient Creeds or Liturgies; or in any of the Apostolical Fathers. Whereby 'tis plain, that it is no Part of the Sacred, the Apostolical, or the Christian Doctrine; and no more than a Conje∣cture
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
or Hypothesis of some ancient Christian Phi∣losopers. Whether <HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI> ever be∣liev'd, even in his younger Years, before he was throughly instructed in Christianity, that Christ was really <HI>eternal,</HI> it is not certain: Because the Epithet <HI>eternal</HI> in the former Passage cited from him does not always denote a real Eternity, and may belong to the Father and not to the Son; and if <HI>Clement</HI> did once call him the <HI>eternal Light</HI> in a Poem, the Latitude of such Writings, espe∣cially of that romantick Piece ascrib'd to him, in∣to which this Phrase is inserted, still more plain∣ly forbids us to draw any such settled Conclusion from it: Especially when he elsewhere most plain∣ly said, he was the <HI>first created Wisdom of God</HI>; and in another Work, directly <HI>depress'd him into the Rank of a Creature</HI>; as we have already seen. So that unless we believe such Authors had a Fancy that a common <HI>Creature,</HI> or the World it self, might be <HI>co-eternal to its Creator,</HI> we must not quote them for the Son's proper Co-eternity to his Fa∣ther. And as to the seemingly most express Te∣stimonies of <HI>Eusebius,</HI> who calls the Generation of the Son <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>eternal,</HI> and says the Son was <HI>always,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>beginningless,</HI> and at <HI>all Times,</HI> with the Father; that he was elder than all <HI>Time,</HI> and all <HI>Ages; before,</HI> and <HI>still before all Ages</HI>; that he subsisted <HI>from endless Ages,</HI> or rather <HI>before all Ages</HI>; that he was <HI>before all</HI>; was the <HI>ancientest Being of all Time and of all Ages</HI>; that he reign'd with his Fa∣ther <HI>from beginningless Ages</HI>; and that of the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es∣byters and Deacons of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> that God begat him <HI>before eternal Times</HI>; they here, according to the ancient Stile, denote no more than that he was <HI>be∣fore the World began</HI>; as we are fully assured by ma∣ny other clearer and plainer Passages of the same Authors, wherein they directly and absolutely de∣ny the Son's Co-eternity with the Father notwith∣standing; as we shall see hereafter.</P>
<P>And as to some other of the Testimonies, omit∣ted in this Sum of the Evidence, they are so lit∣tle
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
to the Purpose, that the insisting on them shews how scarce the Proofs are on that Side.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Jud. v. 6.</NOTE> To conclude this Head: As the <HI>Greek</HI> Language has three Ways of Speaking, which are sometimes rendred <HI>eternal</HI>; the first <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> The second, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> And the third, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> The first of which does seldom or never signify a proper Eternity; the second not always; and the third, and that alone, always does so; 'tis very remarkable that the Bi∣ble and Apostolical Fathers never, in this Case of the Antiquity of the Son, use any but the first; none of those before the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> more than the first, and very rarely the second; while <HI>Athanasius</HI> and his Followers, and none before them, directly ventur'd on the third Way of Speak∣ing, and called the Son <HI>Co-eternal.</HI> Which how it cou'd happen, if the proper <HI>Co eternity</HI> of the Son to the Father were then all along the known Do∣ctrine of Christianity, I do by no Means under∣stand. Briefly, in the fourth Century we find this Co-eternity plainly asserted; we find obscure In∣timations about a subtile Sort of Eternity in the third and latter Part of the second; but in the former Part of the second, and the first Century we lose all certain Footsteps of any Eternity whatsoever: Which Observation renders this E∣vidence for the <HI>Co-eternity,</HI> even tho' we had no opposite Evidence to weigh on the other Side, ex∣ceeding weak and precarious.</P>
<P>But then, as to the original Evidence against this <HI>Co-eternity</HI> of the Son, and for his <HI>voluntary Genera∣tion</HI> or <HI>Creation</HI> by the Power of the Father, before the World began, the Sum of it is as follows.</P>
<P>That the Son was not an underiv'd, unorigina∣ted, independent and, in that Sense, an Eternal Be∣ing, but truly derived from, and produced, or be∣gotten by the Father, is the unanimous Voice of all Christian Antiquity, both in and after the Aposto∣lical Age; and is not directly deny'd by any <HI>Atha∣nasian</HI> at this Day. Now, how a confessedly deriv'd, produc'd, and begotten Being; an Only-begotten
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
Son, should be really coeternal with his underiv'd, unbegotten, and necessarily-existing Author, Pro∣ducer, and Father, I cannot possibly understand.</P>
<P>That the Son was also <HI>voluntarily begotten</HI> by the Power of the Father, we have the plain and nu∣merous Testimonies of the Apostles themselves in their Constitutions, of <HI>Ignatius,</HI> of the Author of the Recognitions of <HI>Clement,</HI> of <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> of <HI>Tatian,</HI> of <HI>Tertullian,</HI> of <HI>Novatian,</HI> of <HI>Lactantius,</HI> of <HI>Eusebius,</HI> and of the Presbyters and Deacons of <HI>Alex∣andria</HI>; without the least Syllable, that any one Christian thought of his being deriv'd from the Fa∣ther, as the Moderns pretend, by <HI>Necessity of Nature.</HI></P>
<P>That he was also <HI>created</HI> by God the Father, is also most evident in all Sacred and Christian Anti∣quity. This Doctrine begins from <HI>Solomon</HI> in the Old Testament, as explain'd by the Christian Re∣velation; and is continued by the Son of <HI>Sirach,</HI> and <HI>Philo</HI> the Jew, to the Writers of the New Te∣stament, <HI>Peter, Paul, John, Hermas</HI>; the Apostles in general, in their Constitutions; all these in the first Century: Thence it passes down to <HI>Ignatius,</HI> to the Author of the Recognitions of <HI>Clement,</HI> to <HI>Ju∣stin Martyr, Melito, Tatian,</HI> and <HI>Athenagoras,</HI> in the secon'd Century: And from all these it comes down to <HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Alexandria, Tertullian, Origen, Gregory</HI> of <HI>Neocoesarea, Novatian, Cyprian, Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Alex∣andria, Theognostus,</HI> and <HI>Methodius,</HI> in the 3d Cen∣tury; to <HI>Lactantius</HI> and <HI>Eusebius,</HI> and to the <HI>Alexan∣drian</HI> Presbyters and Deacons, nay, even to <HI>Athanasius</HI> himself in the fourth Century; and this, so far as we know, without any one Person's excepting against the Word <HI>Created,</HI> as improper, 'till <HI>Athanasius</HI>: without any one's asserting that the Son was <HI>uncreated,</HI> till he did it: and with the direct Assertion of several, that he was a <HI>Creature,</HI> a Being <HI>made</HI> by the Father; tho' vastly superior to all other Creatures or Beings made by him.</P>
<P>That the <HI>voluntary Generation</HI> or <HI>Creation</HI> of the Son, (for I take them to mean the same Thing) was a little before the Creation of the World also, is the only natural Import of almost all, and the direct Assertion of some of the Testimonies; with∣out the Contradiction of any one Christian Writer
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
also, that I know of, till the fourth Century, or the Days of <HI>Athanasius.</HI></P>
<P>That the Body of the Church, even in the Be∣ginning of the fourth Century, nay, even at and some Years after the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> it self, knew nothing of any real Eternity of the Son; nor de∣ny'd that he was a Being begotten or created by the Will and Power of God, a little before the Begin∣ning of the World, is very plain from the Testimo∣nies here produc'd. So that 'tis hard to say what ori∣ginal Evidence the real Trinitarians have gone up∣on, when they have so long made the World believe that the Son is truly <HI>Coeternal</HI> with the Father; and this as a prime Article establish'd at the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> nay, as a fundamental Doctrine of Christia∣nity it self; since, whatever Authority there may be for the <HI>potential</HI> or <HI>metaphysick,</HI> there seems to be directly none at all for this <HI>real Coeternity,</HI> or pro∣per <HI>eternal Generation,</HI> 'till a good while after the Council of <HI>Nice.</HI> Nor would the great and learned <HI>Eusebius,</HI> when he wrote by the Direction of the Council of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and several Years after that of <HI>Nice,</HI> have ventur'd openly to charge <HI>Mar∣cellus</HI> with Heresy, for saying that Christ was <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>eternal,</HI> if that his Eternity had been the known De∣termination of the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> or indeed the known Doctrine of the Church, either in that or in the foregoing Ages of the Gospel.</P>
<P>That this Coeternity of the Son is a very strange Doctrine to such as have the Unity of God for the Foundation of their Religion; such as all the Pa∣triarchs, the Jews, and the Christians ever had, will be granted by all. That therefore there was a great Occasion for a clear and express Declaration of this Eternity of the Son, if it were true, is very evident: while yet neither the Scriptures, nor the Apostolical Constitutions, nor any ancient Creeds whatsoever, have any one such clear Declaration; nay, have many such clear Declarations concerning One only true or eternal God, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. I. 20 1 Tim. 1.17.</NOTE> One only <HI>eternal Power and Godhead,</HI> One only <HI>King of Ages, or eter∣nal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God,</HI> as supposes
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
the contrary; especially while they add to those De∣clarations, that this One God is no other than the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Thus all the old Creeds or Confessions of Faith do begin with this as the first Doctrine of Christianity, <HI>I believe in One God the Father</HI>; or as the Baptismal Creed itself expresses it, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Constitut. 7.41.</NOTE> <HI>I believe in One unbegotten Being, the only true God Almighty, the Father of Christ</HI>; while what they say of the Son has not the least In∣timation of either his Coequality or Coeternity, but the contrary; which is particularly the Case of the original Creed beforemention'd, where the Ar∣ticle concerning the Son begins thus: <HI>I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, the First-born of the whole Creation; who, before the Ages, was begotten by the good Pleasure of the Father</HI>; which seems to me an authentick, a sacred, and an undeni∣able Testimony against any real Coeternity of the Son to the Father.</P>
<P>Nor indeed, My Lord, are the Expressions all along used in the foregoing Collection of Texts and Testimonies capable of any fair Sense, con∣sistent with this Coeternity, since many of them directly confute the same. Thus the Apostolical Constitutions affirm, That God the Father is <HI>eter∣nally One only</HI>; or, <HI>The Only Eternal Being</HI>: That those are Hereticks who say [as do the <HI>Trinitarians</HI> in Effect] that God is <HI>three,</HI> or <HI>manifold</HI>; or that there are <HI>three Gods, coeternal with one another.</HI> The Apostles <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> by calling Christ the <HI>First-born of the whole Creation,</HI> and the <HI>Beginning of the Creation of God,</HI> do in the most plain, usual, and ob∣vious Sense of the Words, and as they were under∣stood in the first Ages; [especially, if we consider the Allusion these Passages bear to the Text in the <HI>Proverbs,</HI> as then understood by all, <HI>The Lord crea∣ted me, the Beginning of his Ways</HI>] directly affirm that Christ was <HI>the first Being God created.</HI> The Author to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> directly affirms, that God <HI>made</HI> Christ; which in the fourth Century was reckon'd so hete∣rodox, that this Epistle was in some Places seldom read in publick, and that partly out of the Dread of such an Expression; as <HI>Philastrius</HI> assures us.<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Haeret. C. 41.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33"/>St. <HI>Peter</HI> is also introduc'd in that very ancient Book called The <HI>Preaching</HI> of <HI>Peter,</HI> as declaring that God <HI>made</HI> his first-born Son. St. <HI>Hermas</HI> directly asserts, that the Holy Spirit, which was placed in a Body, or the Word of God incarnate, was <HI>created</HI> the first of all Beings. The Apostolical Constituti∣ons enjoin us to dedicate our selves to the <HI>eternal God,</HI> not through his <HI>coeternal Word,</HI> as the <HI>Athanasi∣ans</HI> would certainly have said; but through <HI>that Word which was in the Beginning</HI>; as the greatest An∣tiquity of the Son then known in the Church. <HI>Ig∣natius,</HI> and the Author of the Recognitions of <HI>Cle∣ment,</HI> assure us, that the very <HI>Substance</HI> of our Savi∣our was not the <HI>unbegotten Substance</HI> of the Father, but was it self begotten by the Divine Power. The Author of the Recognitions affirms, that Christ was himself a <HI>made Being</HI>; and that the Will of God <HI>preceded</HI> his Generation. <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> who al∣ways indeed avoided those Expressions himself, of a <HI>Creature</HI> and a <HI>made Being,</HI> did not yet in the least find Fault with <HI>Trypho</HI> the Jew, when he declar'd that he understood that both he, and the Scriptures quoted by him, meant that the God of the <HI>Jews made</HI> our Lord and God Christ Jesus. Nor does this <HI>Justin,</HI> among his numerous Expressions con∣cerning the Son's praeexisting State, of which he is so very full, ever venture to say any thing that looks like his real Coeternity with the Father. <HI>Ter∣tullian,</HI> who yet favour'd the Son's metapyhysick Eternity as much as any, directly affirms there was a Time <HI>when God was not a Father, and had not a Son. Clement of Alexandria,</HI> whatever he had said in his younger Years, did at last own that Christ was the <HI>first created Wisdom of God</HI>; and was to be reckon'd as a <HI>Creature. Origen</HI> did also plainly and clearly own, that he was one of the Creatures of God, tho' the ancientest of 'em all; even so ancient, that he cared not to assign the Date of his first Generation or Creation; and the Reason seems to have been, that he had a Fancy that the World it self, though created by God, might possibly be coeternal with its Creator. <HI>Gregory</HI> of <HI>Naeocaesarea</HI> did also directly
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
profess that Christ was a <HI>Creature,</HI> or a <HI>Being made</HI> by God. <HI>Novatian</HI> also, or the acute but unknown Author of the Book concerning the <HI>Trinity,</HI> affirms that God the Father is the <HI>only eternal God,</HI> to whom no other Being can be so much as compar'd; that the Son was then begotten when <HI>it pleased the Father</HI>; who, and who alone, was <HI>prior</HI> to him; and that as a necessary Consequence from his being his Fa∣ther. <HI>Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI> directly affirms Christ to have been a <HI>Creature</HI>; and supposes not only a Dif∣ference of the Subsistences of the Father and Son, but a Diversity of <HI>Substance,</HI> an Inferiority of <HI>Power,</HI> and a Difference of <HI>Glory</HI>; so that he, as well as many others, seems not to have had so much as a Notion of a metaphysick Eternity. <HI>Theognostus</HI> also declar'd, that the Son was a <HI>Creature. Lactan∣tius</HI> is express for the Generation or Creation of the Son, a little before the World was made.</P>
<P>The great <HI>Eusebius,</HI> whom the <HI>Athanasians</HI> used sometimes to hale over to their Party, as if he be∣liev'd the <HI>Coeternity</HI> of the Son, is so fully understood, since the later Publication of some of his Works long lost, that he is now generally allowed, as he was in his own Age, to be clearly against it. Nor is there Room for any Dispute, since he directly says, the Father was <HI>prior,</HI> nay, <HI>a great deal prior</HI> to the Son; and charg'd <HI>Marcellus,</HI> as introducing an Heretical Notion, when he asserted that the Son was <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Eternal,</HI> which Assertion he directly took to be the same as <HI>Unbegotten</HI>; of all which O∣pinions of <HI>Eusebius</HI> the very learned <HI>Monfaucon</HI> has given so full an Account, in his Preliminaries to <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s Psalms, that I reckon none of the truly Learned will any more pretend he was an <HI>Athanasi∣an.</HI> Nor will any one doubt of the Opinion of many of the Bishops in the <HI>East</HI> and in <HI>Egypt</HI>; hardly indeed of <HI>Alexander</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and of the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>'s own Opinion against the pro∣per Coeternity, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Collection of ancient Monuments by me.</HI></NOTE> who carefully peruses the original Records here and elsewhere publish'd relating to that Age; which yet was generally dispos'd to ad∣vance

For I suppose he that says, The Holy Spirit is a Being made, and admits of this Assertion, that <HI>all Things were made by the Word,</HI> must of Ne∣cessity grant, that the Holy Spirit was made by him; and that, by Consequence, [<HI>N.B.</HI>] the Word was more ancient than he. But he that will not admit that the Holy Spirit was made by Christ, must, by Consequence, say he is Unbe∣gotten; if he, withal, judges what is said in the Gospel to be true.—We who are perswaded that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three Substances, and do believe there is nothing Un∣begotten but the Father, do admit this Notion as most agreeable to Piety and Truth; that when all Things are said to be made by the Word, the Holy Spirit is the most honourable, and first in Order of those Beings which the Father made by Christ, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eusebius] De Eccles. Theolog. iii. 6.</NOTE> Now the Son alone is honour'd with the Pater∣nal Divinity, and has the Power of making, and creating, all Things that are made, visible and invisible, and even is the Producer of the Ex∣istence of the Spirit, the Comforter himself. For all Things were made by him; and without him not one Thing was made. And by him were all Things created, both those in Heaven, and those on Earth; whether they be visible, or invisible.—Now the Son is the only begotten God, who is in the Bosom of the Father. But the Spi∣rit, the Comforter, is neither God, nor the Son [of God] because he did not receive his Genera∣tion from the Father, in the same Manner as did the Son; but is one of those Beings which were made by the Son. For all Things were made by him; and without him not one Thing was made. These are then the Mysteries of the Catholick and Holy Church, deliver'd by the Divine Oracles; while <HI>Marcelius,</HI> confounding all Things,—in∣troduces one Substance, with three Persons, and

<P>These, my Lord, are the chief among the Pri∣mitive Texts and Testimonies concerning the O∣rigin of the Holy Spirit, which are so much on one Side, even till long after the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> that I have not found it necessary to divide them under two Heads, as I did those of the Son. Since the only valuable Testimony that may seem to fa∣vour the real Eternity of the Holy Spirit, which is that in the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> of the <HI>eter∣nal Spirit,</HI> uses only the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which sel∣dom or never signifies a proper Eternity; since so many of the Copies have not there even that Epithet, but the usual one of <HI>Holy</HI> instead of <HI>Eter∣nal</HI> Spirit; and since 'tis not certain that this Place belongs to the third Person at all, but perhaps, to the Divine Nature or Word it self in Christ; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bull. De∣fens. Fid. Nicaen. Sect. i. §. 5.</NOTE> which <HI>Grotius</HI> and Bishop <HI>Bull</HI> have shewed several Times to have the Character of an <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI> So that I have no Occasion here to sum up the Evidence on both Sides at all, as to the Co-eterni∣ty of the Holy Spirit to the Father, or even as to his equal Antiquity with the Son; for either of which there is not, that I know of, one proper or direct Testimony sacred or primitive, now extant, in the Records of the Christian Church, till long after the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> in the latter Days of <HI>Atha∣nasius</HI> himself.</P>
<P>And now, My Lord, I beg that your Lordship will please soberly to review the Evidence that is here produc'd before you and the World; and will suppose your self in the High Court of Chancery, in the same Capacity as your Noble Father formerly presided there; and will put the Case, that your Lordship had an exactly paral∣lel Cause before you; that the Witnesses were as numerous and as plain on each Side as these here produc'd appear to be, and no otherwise; and that your Lordship were oblig'd to proceed exact∣ly,
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
<HI>secundum allegata &amp; probata,</HI> which is the known Rule of that and all other like Courts of Justice and Equity among us: And I thereupon Appeal to Your Lordship, supposing you had no Byass on either Side, as no upright Judge ought to have, whether you could possibly, with a safe Consci∣ence, determine on the Side representing the <HI>Atha∣nasians?</HI> Whether, in a Point where the general Light of Nature and common Sense is so strong against the <HI>Athanasian</HI> Doctrine; the Testimonies for it comparatively so few, and so uncertain; and those against it so very many and so very preg∣nant; whether, I say, your Lordship could possi∣bly, with a safe Conscience, pronounce from this Evidence, that the Son of God and his Holy Spi∣rit are strictly Co-eternal to the Supreme God the Father, as the <HI>Athanasians</HI> affirm? Or whether you would not be forced to declare, in Agreement with the Voice of Natural, the Patriarchal, the Jewish, and the original Christian Religion, that there is but one <HI>eternal Being,</HI> one <HI>eternal God</HI>; and that he is no other than the <HI>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>And here, My Lord, give me Leave to wish, heartily to wish, that these ancient Texts and Testimonies, thus plainly produc'd before you in this one important Article, might so far influence Your Lordship, as to engage you to endeavour that the same Method might be taken in the other Branches of this and all other the like Controver∣sies among Christians: That Your Lordship, who has had long so considerable a Hand in the pub∣lick Management of Affairs, Sacred and Ecclesia∣stical, as well as Temporal and Civil, in this Na∣tion; might be a happy Means of bringing all the Parts of our old genuine Christianity to such a fair, open, and impartial Examination, as I have here propos'd, and endeavour'd to exempli∣fy in these Papers; that so, Party, Faction, and Prejudice laid aside, all honest and sober Chri∣stians might, in a peaceable Manner, unite toge∣ther into such <HI>Societies, for promoting Primitive Chri∣stianity,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
as has been formerly exemplify'd at my House; or, however, might jointly prosecute the same pious Designs for the Discovery and Resto∣ration of the Pure and Holy Religion of our Sa∣viour Christ, as it was <HI>once deliver'd to the Saints,</HI> by such other Christian Methods as they should judge might better tend to the same excellent End.</P>
<P>It has hitherto been Your Lordship's great Glory to have supported and encourag'd that Church of <HI>England</HI> in which you was educated; and the World has great Reason to believe, by your dai∣ly religious Attendance on the Church's Liturgy at Home; as well as by your alike devout week∣ly Attendance on the same publick Service at Church; either of which, in our Age, I am sorry to say it, is but too uncommon in Persons of your Lordship's Quality; that you are in earnest in such your Support and Encouragement thereof; or that you do it because you believe this Church to be truly agreeable to the Primitive State of the Gos∣pel. Would it not therefore, My Lord, be still more highly honourable for your Lordship, to be a Means of making a more careful Review of our Doctrine, Worship, Practice, and Discipline? That so the same Church, which has long been the Glory and Bulwark of the Protestant Religion, even in it's present imperfect State, may first of all the rest be exactly conform'd to the Perfection of the Christian Settlement; and so may be the great Exemplar and Pattern of all the other Churches, as they become gradually sensible of the Necessity of such a farther Reformation? All the modern Churches, and among them our own, are, to be sure, very unwilling to allow that they stand in any great Need of a farther Reformation. But as your Lordship will easily observe, that the learn∣ed Members of every one of these Modern Churches declare such a farther Reformation to be necessary in all other Churches but their own; so am I ve∣ry sure that the truly Learned and Impartial of e∣very one of them, who have carefully compar'd
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
the present Settlements with that of the first three Centuries of Christianity, do <HI>privately know,</HI> how little soever they may <HI>publickly confess</HI> that every one of the present Churches, without Exception, do stand in no small Need of such a farther Re∣formation. I beg Leave, my Lord, to conclude here very nearly in the Words with which I for∣merly ended my fourth Volume of <HI>Primitive Chri∣stianity Reviv'd.</HI></P>
<P>I do here solemnly appeal, as to the Truth and Fairness of my Quotations and Assertions, here and elsewhere, to Archbishop <HI>Wake,</HI> Bishop <HI>Hooper,</HI> Bishop <HI>Smalridge,</HI> Bishop <HI>Potter,</HI> Bishop <HI>Chandler,</HI> L. C. J. <HI>King,</HI> Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> Dr. <HI>Bentley,</HI> Dr. <HI>Whit∣by,</HI> Dr. <HI>Clarke,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hare,</HI> Dr. <HI>Marshal,</HI> Dr. <HI>Water∣land,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wall,</HI> Mr. <HI>Gale,</HI> Mr. <HI>Reeves,</HI> and the other great Masters of Primitive Antiquity; and claim it as the Right of Truth and Religion, that they speak their Minds fairly and fully, <HI>as they will an∣swer it to our common Lord another Day,</HI> when no po∣litical, prudential, or temporal Regards, will be admitted against the <HI>plain Demands of Conscience and Sincerity.</HI> And I humbly move those in Authority, that they procure this whole Matter to be impar∣tially and <HI>publickly</HI> examin'd, as the other Popish Doctrines were at the Beginning of the Reforma∣tion; and, if the common Opinions appear not on∣ly destitute of, but contrary to the Evidence of Scripture and the first Centuries, <HI>as I am fully per∣swaded they will,</HI> that then Care be taken to cast them out of the Church; and to amend and re∣form all our publick Offices, Creeds, and Articles, and reduce them all to the Primitive Standards. I also humbly move that, in Order to these and the like Amendments and Improvements in our Eccle∣siastical Establishment, the Pretensions of that wonderful Book still extant, the <HI>Apostolical Consti∣tutions,</HI> be examin'd, with the like Care, and in the same publick Manner: And, so far as it shall appear to be a genuine, uncorrupted, Apostolical Work by <HI>Clemens Romanus,</HI> with the Addition of the most authentick original Jewish and Gentile
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
publick Liturgies; <HI>as I am fully perswaded it will</HI>; it may then be allow'd its due Weight in the Amend∣ment of the Doctrine, Discipline, Government, Worship, and Canons of the Church; or rather, that it may intirely be admitted as an original Rule and Standard in those Matters; as all Chri∣stians, who believe them genuine, and, [for the Main] uncorrupt, are immediately oblig'd to do: especially since the leaving these Constitutions, and setting up other Doctrines and Orders in their stead, seem to have been the very Causes of almost all the Anti-christian Corruptions of these last 1200 or 1300 Years together. But if all these my honest and well-meant Endeavours and Desires be rejected; and instead of any Reformation, I my self be traduc'd, and abus'd, and persecuted, I can only acquiesce in the Sense of having sincerely, with some Trouble and Hazard to my self in this World, discharg'd my Duty; and patiently wait for my Reward in that which is to come. For as to those Anathema's, or Names of Distinction and Reproach, which in this Case I must expect, I va∣lue them not at all: As having long accustom'd my self to govern both my <HI>Belief</HI> and my <HI>Life</HI> by the <HI>original Standards of Christianity,</HI> without Regard to the contrary Opinions and Practices of these <HI>later and corrupter</HI> Ages: And so, <HI>LIBERAVI ANI∣MAM MEAM.</HI></P>
