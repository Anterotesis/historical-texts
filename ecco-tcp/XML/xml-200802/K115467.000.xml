<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>IT is not age, creative Fancy's foe,</L>
<L>Foe to the finer feelings of the soul,</L>
<L>Shall dare forbid the lyric rapture flow;</L>
<L>Scorning its chill controul,</L>
<L>He, at the vernal morn of youth,</L>
<L>Who breath'd, to Liberty and Truth,</L>
<L>Fresh incense from his votive lyre,</L>
<L>In life's autumnal eve, again</L>
<L>Shall, at their shrine, resume the strain,</L>
<L>And sweep the veteran chords with renovated fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>Warm to his own, and to his country's breast,</L>
<L>Twice fifty brilliant years the theme have borne,</L>
<L>And each, through all its varying seasons, blest</L>
<L>By that auspicious morn,</L>
<L>Which gilding NASSAU's patriot prow,</L>
<L>Gave Britain's anxious eye to know</L>
<L>The source whence now her blessings spring;</L>
<L>She saw him from that prow descend,</L>
<L>And, in the Hero, hail'd the Friend;</L>
<L>A name, when Britain speaks, that dignifies her king.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>In solemn state she led him to the throne</L>
<L>Whence bigot zeal and lawless power had fled,</L>
<L>Where Justice fix'd the abdicated crown</L>
<L>On his victorious head.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="5"/>
Was there an angel in the sky,</L>
<L>That glow'd not with celestial joy,</L>
<L>When Freedom, in her native charms,</L>
<L>Descended from her throne of light,</L>
<L>On eagle plumes, to bless the rite,</L>
<L>Recall'd by Britain's voice, restor'd by Nassau's arms!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>Since then, triumphant on the car of Time,</L>
<L>The sister Years in gradual train have roll'd,</L>
<L>And seen the Goddess from her sphere sublime,</L>
<L>The sacred page unfold,</L>
<L>Inscrib'd by Her's and NASSAU's hands,</L>
<L>On which the hallow'd charter stands,</L>
<L>That bids Britannia's sons be free;</L>
<L>And, as they pass'd, each white-rob'd year</L>
<L>Has sung to her responsive sphere,</L>
<L>Hail to the charter'd rights of British Liberty!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>Still louder lift the soul-expanding strain,</L>
<L>Ye future years! while, from her starry throne,</L>
<L>Again she comes to magnify her reign,</L>
<L>And make the world her own.</L>
<L>Her fire e'en France presumes to feel,</L>
<L>And half unsheaths the patriot steel,</L>
<L>Enough the monarch to dismay,</L>
<L>Whoe'er, with rebel pride, withdraws</L>
<L>His own allegiance from the laws</L>
<L>That guard the people's rights, that rein the sovereign's sway.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Hark! how from either India's sultry bound,</L>
<L>From regions girded by the burning zone,</L>
<L>Her all-attentive ear, with sigh profound,</L>
<L>Has heard the captive moan:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="7"/>
Has heard, and ardent in the cause</L>
<L>Of all, that free by Nature's laws,</L>
<L>The avarice of her sons enthralls;</L>
<L>She comes, by Truth and Mercy led,</L>
<L>And, bending her benignant head,</L>
<L>Thus on the seraph pair in suppliant strain she calls:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>"Long have I lent to my Britannia's hands</L>
<L>That trident which controuls the willing sea,</L>
<L>And bad her circulate to distant lands</L>
<L>Each bliss deriv'd from me.</L>
<L>Shall then her Commerce spread the sail,</L>
<L>For gain accurs'd, and court the gale,</L>
<L>Her throne, her sov'reign to disgrace;</L>
<L>Daring (what will not Commerce dare!)</L>
<L>Beyond the ruthless waste of war,</L>
<L>To deal destruction round, and thin the human race?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>"Proclaim it not before th' eternal throne</L>
<L>Of Him, the sire of universal love;</L>
<L>But wait till all my sons your influence own,</L>
<L>Ye envoys from above!</L>
<L>O wait, at this precarious hour,</L>
<L>When, in the pendent scale of power,</L>
<L>My rights and Nature's trembling lye;</L>
<L>Do thou, sweet Mercy! touch the beam,</L>
<L>Till lightly, as the feather'd dream,</L>
<L>Ascends the earthly dross of—selfish policy.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>"Do thou, fair Truth! as did thy Master mild,</L>
<L>Who, fill'd with all the power of godhead, came</L>
<L>To purify the souls, by guilt defil'd,</L>
<L>With Faith's celestial flame;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="9"/>
Tell them, 'tis Heaven's benign decree</L>
<L>That all, of Christian liberty,</L>
<L>The peace-inspiring gale should breathe;</L>
<L>May then that nation hope to claim</L>
<L>The glory of the Christian name,</L>
<L>That loads fraternal tribes with bondage worse than death?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>"Tell them, they vainly grace, with festive joy,</L>
<L>The day that free'd them from Oppression's rod,</L>
<L>At Slavery's mart, who barter and who buy</L>
<L>The image of their GOD.</L>
<L>But peace!—their conscience feels the wrong;</L>
<L>From Britain's congregated tongue,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="10"/>
Repentant breaks the choral lay,</L>
<L>"Not unto us, indulgent Heav'n,</L>
<L>"In partial stream, be Freedom given,</L>
<L>"But pour her treasures wide, and guard with legal sway!"</L>
