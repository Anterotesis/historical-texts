<L>FRIEND of my youth, who, when the willing Muse</L>
<L>Stream'd o'er my breast her warm poetic rays,</L>
<L>Saw'st the fresh seeds their vital powers diffuse,</L>
<L>And fed'st them with the fost'ring dew of praise!</L>
<L>Whate'er the produce of th' unthrifty soil,</L>
<L>The leaves, the flowers, the fruits, to thee belong:</L>
<L>The labourer earns the wages of his toil;</L>
<L>Who form'd the Poet, well may claim the song.</L>
<L>Yes, 'tis my pride to own, that taught by thee</L>
<L>My conscious soul superior flights essay'd;</L>
<L>Learnt from thy lore the Poet's dignity,</L>
<L>And spurn'd the hirelings of the rhyming trade.</L>
<L>Say, scenes of Science, say, thou haunted stream!</L>
<L>[For oft my Muse-led steps did'st thou behold]</L>
<L>How on thy banks I rifled every theme,</L>
<L>That Fancy fabled in her age of gold.</L>
<L>How oft I cry'd, " O come, thou tragic Queen!</L>
<L>" March from thy Greece with firm majestic tread!</L>
<L>" Such as when Athens saw thee fill her scene,</L>
<L>" When Sophocles thy choral Graces led;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4"/>
" Saw thy proud pall it's purple length devolve,</L>
<L>" Saw thee uplift the glitt'ring dagger high,</L>
<L>" Ponder with fixed brow thy deep resolve</L>
<L>" Prepar'd to strike, to triumph, and to die.</L>
<L>" Bring then to Britain's plain that choral throng,</L>
<L>" Display thy buskin'd pomp, thy golden lyre,</L>
<L>" Give her historic forms the soul of song,</L>
<L>" And mingle Attic art with Shakespear's fire."</L>
<L>" Ah what, fond Boy, dost thou presume to claim?"</L>
<L>The Muse reply'd. " Mistaken suppliant, know,</L>
<L>" To light in Shakespear's breast the dazzling flame</L>
<L>" Exhausted all Parnassus could bestow.</L>
<L>" True; Art remains; and, if from his bright page</L>
<L>" Thy mimic power one vivid beam can seize,</L>
<L>" Proceed; and in that best of tasks engage,</L>
<L>" Which tends at once to profit, and to please."</L>
<L>She spake; and Harewood's Towers spontaneous rose;</L>
<L>Soft virgin warblings eccho'd thro' the grove;</L>
<L>And fair Elfrida pour'd forth all her woes,</L>
<L>The hapless pattern of connubial Love.</L>
<L>More awful scenes old Mona next display'd;</L>
<L>Her caverns gloom'd, her forests wav'd on high,</L>

<L>THIS is the secret centre of the isle:</L>

<L>Gaze on the solemn scene; behold yon oak,</L>
<L>How stern he frowns, and with his broad brown arms</L>
<L>Chills the pale plain beneath him: mark yon altar,</L>
<L>The dark stream brawling round it's rugged base,</L>
<L>These cliffs, these yawning caverns, this wide circus,</L>
<L>Skirted with unhewn stone: they awe my soul,</L>
<L>As if the very Genius of the place</L>

<L>Stalk'd thro' his drear domain. And yet, my friends,</L>

<L>'Mid the lone majesty of untam'd nature,</L>
<L>Controuling sober reason; tell me else,</L>
<L>Why do these haunts of barb'rous superstition</L>
<L>O'ercome me thus? I scorn them, yet they awe me.</L>

<L><PB N="3" REF="9"/>
Rob'd in their flowing vests of innocent white,</L>
<L>Descend, with harps that glitter to the moon,</L>
<L>Hymning immortal strains. The spirits of air,</L>
<L>Of earth, of water, nay of heav'n itself,</L>
<L>Do listen to their lay: and oft, 'tis said,</L>
<L>In visible shapes dance they a magic round</L>
<L>To the high minstrelsy. Now, if thine eye</L>
<L>Be sated with the view, haste to thy ships;</L>

<P>The ovum anguinum, or serpent's egg; a famous Druidical amulet, thus circumstantially described by Pliny.—Praeterea est ovorum genus in magna Galliarum fama, omissum Graecis. Angues innumeri aestate convoluti, salivis faucium corporumque spumis arti∣fici complexu glomerantur; anguinum appellatur. Druidae sibilis id dicunt in sublime jactari, sagoque oportere intercipi, ne tellurem attingat. Profugere raptorem equo, serpentes enim insequi, donec arceantur amnis alicujus interventu, &amp;c. Nat. Hist. Lib. xxix. c. 3.</P>
<P>There are remains of this superstition still, both in the north and west parts of our island. For Lhwyd, the author of the Ar∣cheologia, writes thus to Rowland; see Mona Antiqua, p. 338. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Druid doctrine about the <HI>Glain Neidr,</HI> obtains very much thro' all Scotland, as well lowlands as highlands; but there is not a word of it in this kingdom (Ireland); where, as there are no snakes, they could not propagate it. Besides snake-stones, the highlanders have their snail-stones, paddock-stones, &amp;c. to all which they attribute their several virtues, and wear them as amu∣lets."</Q> And in another letter he writes, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Cornish retain variety of charms, and have still, towards the land's-end, the amulet of Maen Magal, and Glain Neidr, which latter they call a Mil∣preu, or Melpreu, and have a charm for the snake to make it, when they have found one asleep, and struck a hazel wand in the centre of her spires."</Q></P>

The few and imperfect accounts antiquity gives us of ceremo∣nies, &amp;c. which are unquestionably Druidical, makes it necessary in this, and in other places of the Drama, to have recourse to Tacitus's account of the Germans, amongst whom, if there were really no established Druids, there was certainly a great corre∣spondency, in religious opinions, with the Gauls and Britons. The passage here alluded to is taken from his 10th chapter. Proprium gentis, equorumque quoque praesagia ac monitus experiri. Pub∣lice aluntur iisdem nemoribus ac lucis, candidi &amp; nullo mortali opere contacti, quos pressos sacro curru, sacerdos ac rex, vel prin∣ceps civitatis comitantur, hinnitus &amp; fremitus observant, nec ulli auspicio major sides non solum apud plebem, sed apud proceres, apud sacerdotes.</P>

<P>This is meant to describe the rocking-stone, of which there are several still to be seen in Wales, Cornwall, and Derbyshire. They are universally thought, by antiquarians, to be Druid monuments; and Mr. Toland thinks, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the Druids made the people believe that they only could move them, and that by a miracle, by which they condemned or acquitted the accused, and often brought criminals to confess what could in no other way be ex∣torted from them."</Q> 'Twas this conjecture which gave the hint for this piece of machinery.
