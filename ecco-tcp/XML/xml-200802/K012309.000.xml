<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THESE Poems (some of which, it is presumed, will be found to have an <HI>original</HI> cast,) were written partly to divert the Author's mind from reflections of un∣pleasing tendency, and partly to relieve it under attention to matters more professional, and of much greater importance to the in∣terest of virtue and religion. And he hopes at the same time a liberal attempt to amuse all sorts of readers but immoral ones, will not be less acceptable to the candid and the sensible, than the bulk of modern produc∣tions, which are visibly calculated to answer a mere temporary and ungenerous purpose; in the gratification of party rage, popular censoriousness, or personal disgust.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY ON GENIUS. A NEW EDITION, WITH ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>INQUIRE, dispute, reply, and all you can,</L>
<L>Say, what is GENIUS but the soul of man;—</L>
<L>Beam of that light which animates our frame,</L>
<L>Alike in many, but in none the same?</L>
<L>'Tis with our Minds, as with our bodies, none</L>
<L>In essence differ, yet each knows his own.</L>
<L>Marks of specific character we see</L>
<L>That stamp on ev'ry mortal,—THIS IS HE.</L>
<L>Nor varies more our present outward shape</L>
<L>(This man half-angel, and the next half-ape)</L>
<L>Than do the mental powers: What odds we find</L>
<L>Between a —'s and a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the course of this Essay, the names of many who have distinguished themselves by their ability will occur; but it will not be expected, that honour should be done to, or mention made of all the successful candidates for celebrity, in all countries and ages of the world. It will be thought sufficient, 'tis presumed, for the illustra∣tion of the subject, to have produced some of the most eminent and popular names, especially among those of our own nation.</NOTE> <HI>Newton</HI>'s mind?</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="8"/>Ask you the cause? First take it for a rule—</L>
<L>Whate'er the man, the soul is not a fool.</L>
<L>She came in due perfection from the skies,</L>
<L>And all defect in grosser body lies.</L>
<L>Body and soul at best but ill agree;—</L>
<L>'Tis spirit wedded to infirmity:</L>
<L>A disproportion'd match; and hence proceeds</L>
<L>The soul's inaction from the body's needs.</L>
<L>This truth once state, ev'ry soul, 'tis plain,</L>
<L>Much on the filmy texture of the brain;</L>
<L>Much on formations that escape our eyes;</L>
<L>On nice connexions, and coherencies;</L>
<L>And on corporeal organs must depend,</L>
<L>For her own functions, exercise, and end.</L>
<L>Hence then the cause of all defects is seen;</L>
<L>For one wrong movement spoils the whole machine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis hence the several passions take their rise,</L>
<L>The seeds of virtue, and the roots of vice;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="9"/>Hence notes peculiar or to young, or old,</L>
<L>Phlegmatic, sanguine, amorous, or cold;</L>
<L>And hence from constitution, such or such,</L>
<L>Wit will take modes, and <HI>Genius</HI> op'rate much.</L>
<L>The youthful bard, a gentle, sighing swain,</L>
<L>Like <HI>Ovid</HI> warbles in a love-sick strain;</L>
<L>With weaker passions, but with sense more strong.</L>
<L>The melancholy <HI>Young</HI> pursues his song.</L>
<L>Mixture of humours motley <HI>Genius</HI> shews;</L>
<L>'Tis seen, methinks, in <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author means not hereby to throw any re∣flection on the literary character of the late ingenious and worthy Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> whose MEDITATIONS have done considerable service to religion, and will rank him in the first class of elegant writers; — proper allowances made for the enthusiasm with which they are a little tinctured, and for the exuberance of a sometimes too playful imagination.</NOTE> <HI>Hervey</HI>'s dancing prose.</L>
<L>Why wonder then to mark the sons of rhyme</L>
<L>Gay, serious, turgid, easy, or sublime?</L>
<L>The soul and body closely thus allied,</L>
<L>Vile is the folly as the sin of pride;</L>
<L>And one great truth the first of men will fit —</L>
<L>That nothing more precarious is than wit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
<L>Behold yon wretch, that o'er your parish strays,</L>
<L>A baby-man, a driv'ler all his days!</L>
<L>With tongue out-lolling, and round-rolling eyes,</L>
<L>He grins against the sun, and catches flies: —</L>
<L>But for some secret flaws we cannot read,</L>
<L>That check her motions, and her flights impede,</L>
<L>His soul, perchance, enrich'd with happiest thought,</L>
<L>Had spoke like <HI>Tully,</HI> or like <HI>Virgil</HI> wrote.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas! all souls are subject to like fate,</L>
<L>All sympathizing with the body's state;</L>
<L>Let the fierce fever burn through ev'ry vein,</L>
<L>And drive the madding fury to the brain,</L>
<L>Nought can the fervour of his frenzy cool,</L>
<L>But <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s self's a parish fool!</L>
<L>Nay, in proportion, lighter ails controul</L>
<L>The mental virtue, and infect the soul.</L>
<L>Ease is best convoy in our voy'ge to truth: —</L>
<L>What man e'er reason'd with a raging tooth?</L>
<L>A poet with a <HI>Genius,</HI> and without,</L>
<L>Are the same creatures in the pangs of gout.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence then we guess, nor vain is our surmise,</L>
<L>Why some are fools, and none are always wise;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="11"/>Why <HI>Genius</HI> differs in life's every stage,</L>
<L>Runs wild with youth, and creeps with hobbling age,</L>
<L>The soul uncumber'd with the mortal clay</L>
<L>Knows no increase of strength, nor fears decay.</L>
<L>A little art this secret may unfold —</L>
<L>That what can never die, is never old.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By present powers perfection cease to scan,</L>
<L>For we may daily mourn the <HI>fall of man!</HI></L>
<L>Ah! how bright wit, possest of ev'ry gift,</L>
<L>Dwindled to folly, and went mad in <HI>Swift.</HI></L>
<L>The mighty <HI>Marlb'ro',</HI> whose great soul was prov'd</L>
<L>Upon the plains of <HI>Blenheim,</HI> where, unmov'd</L>
<L>"Amidst confusion, horrour, and despair,"</L>
<L>He view'd around "the dreadful scenes of war;</L>
<L>"In peaceful thought the field of death survey'd;</L>
<L>"To fainting squadrons sent the timely aid;</L>
<L>"Inspir'd repuls'd battalions to engage,</L>
<L>"And taught the doubtful battle where to rage;"</L>
<L>E'en he, the springs of nature in decay,</L>
<L>And all his vital functions worn away,</L>
<L>Unable now to conquer realms, or buy,</L>
<L>With idiot gesture, and unmeaning eye,</L>
<L>Sits a spectator in the foremost row,</L>
<L>And gapes at heroes in a puppet-shew.</L>
</LG>

<L>Eschew presumption ev'ry half-learn'd elf;</L>
<L>The noblest writer does not know himself.</L>
<L>Turn mighty <HI>Milton</HI>'s sacred volume o'er;</L>

<L>His numbers like th'Almighty's thunders roll,</L>
<L>And strike an aweful pleasure to the soul:</L>
<L>We joy in ruin; and are almost pain'd</L>
<L>To see the (late-lost) <HI>Paradise Regain'd.</HI></L>
<L>This work <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See <HI>Fenton</HI>'s Life of <HI>Milton,</HI> prefixed to his edition of <HI>Paradise Lost.</HI></P><P>The learned Dr. <HI>Newton</HI> tells us, in his Life of <HI>Milton,</HI> that, <Q>all that we can assert upon good authority is, that he could not endure to hear the <HI>Paradise Regained</HI> cried down so much as it was, in comparison with the other poem.</Q> But, I believe, my reader will agree with me, that such a partiality as this, will sufficiently warrant what is said in the Essay.

</LG>
<LG>
<L>GENIUS again, by inf'rence apt we see,</L>
<L>The same in species, differs in <HI>degree</HI>;</L>
<L>Propensities are strong; and few men yet</L>
<L>But have a relish for some kind of wit.</L>
<L><HI>Homer</HI> is monarch of the <HI>Epic</HI> choir;</L>
<L>Yet <HI>Virgil</HI> snatch'd a brand of <HI>Homer</HI>'s fire;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="13"/>The daring <HI>Homer</HI>'s all-impetuous strain,</L>
<L>Like a hot courser bore him o'er the plain.</L>
<L>The muse of <HI>Virgil,</HI> that affected state,</L>
<L>Speeds not so swiftly, but she keeps her rate.</L>
<L>Heats oft intense in <HI>Lucan</HI>'s patriot page,</L>
<L>And <HI>Statius'</HI> muse turns fury in her rage.</L>
<L>Each writer is distinguish'd in his way;</L>
<L>Grand <HI>Sophocles,</HI> or playful <HI>Seneca.</HI></L>
<L>Bold <HI>Aeschylus</HI> a stately buskin wore,</L>
<L>And shook th'<HI>Athenian</HI> stage with tragic roar.</L>
<L>You'd swear, so soft <HI>Euripides</HI> appears,</L>
<L>And tender still, he dipt his quill in tears.</L>
<L>Droll <HI>Aristophanes</HI> in humour's school</L>
<L>Was bred, and we admire e'en envy's tool.</L>
<L>A pleasant vein through laughing <HI>Plautus</HI> ran,</L>
<L>And <HI>Terence</HI> words it like a gentleman.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All to their fav'rite art will lay pretence;—</L>
<L>'Tis inclination, or 'tis excellence;</L>
<L>'Midst clouds of dullness gleams of wit have shone,</L>
<L>Like the faint burstings of an <HI>April</HI> sun.</L>
<L>Some partly fail, as partly they excel —</L>
<L>Thus <HI>R-ch-rds-n,</HI> we know, drew nature well;</L>
<L>Yet should a genius toy as he has done,</L>
<L>And spin morality like <HI>Grandison?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
<L>Grant you what's past, and it will less perplex</L>
<L>To ask, why woman is the weaker sex?</L>
<L>Or, why th' extremes of female wits are such,</L>
<L>They mostly say too little, or too much?</L>
<L>Beauty's soft frame, for other ends design'd,</L>
<L>Faints under toil of body, or of mind.</L>
<L>Shall dimpled girls "the state's whole thunder wield,</L>
<L>And spinsters "shake the senate, or the field?"</L>
<L>Shall tender matrons with man's follies vext,</L>
<L>With high-strain'd treble drive a pointed text?</L>
<L>Shall blooming virgins wage the wordy war,</L>
<L>And deck with brazen fronts the noisy bar?</L>
<L>Let not creation's finer part repine,</L>
<L>Or grudge the province where they cannot shine.</L>
<L>Their pleasing sway a thousand ways is shewn,</L>
<L>And beauty has an empire of its own.</L>
<L>Kind Heav'n that gave them beauty, all things gave:—</L>
<L>The soundest scholar is a woman's slave.</L>
<L>Yet have we known superior nymphs that can</L>
<L>Assert an equal pow'r, and rival man!</L>
<L>Born nature's wonders, or with art to wield</L>
<L>The pen; or grace in arms the martial field;</L>

But because the omission of the latter may be liable to misconstruction; or lay him open to a charge of tergiversation, and deser∣tion of sentiment, from more quarters than one, it is thought proper to produce the passage in this place, with as much of comment on it as will, 'tis hoped, be sufficient for his vindication, and the satisfaction of the reader.— The lines are as follows:
<Q><L>For me, howe'er, I covet lasting fame,</L>
<L>And pant with longings for a poet's name,</L>
<L>Yet let my soul confess a nobler aim!</L>
<L>Give me, kind heav'n, still higher points to reach;</L>
<L>Give me to practice what I strive to teach;</L>
<L>My standing rules of daily conduct be</L>
<L>Faith, honour, justice, candour, charity;</L>
<L>Careless of false reproach, or vain applause,</L>
<L>Be worth my eulogy, and truth my cause.</L>
<L>O may I wield an independent pen,</L>
<L>A friend to virtue, not a tool to men;</L>
<L>In perseverance placing all my glory,</L>
<L>While <HI>TORIES, WHIGS,</HI> and all Men call me <HI>TORY!</HI></L>
<L>Warm in my breast may patriot passion glow;</L>
<L>Righteous resentment of my country's woe:</L>
<L>With voice and heart for ever may I stand</L>
<L>'Gainst vermin that devour my native land;</L>
<L>And in one wish my wishes centered be —</L>
<L>That I may live to hail my country free!</L></Q></P>
<P>Two of these verses are a parody on a well-known pas∣sage in <HI>Mr. Pope,</HI> and reprobate that Gentleman's there-avowed mediocrity of principle. — However let stress be laid not on names, but things. Ideas are often affixed to terms with which they are not necessarily connected, either by the indiscretion, or the violence, or the artifice of party. Men may load the word <HI>Tory</HI> with what Imputa∣tions they please; — but (to be as explicit as the occasion seems to require) if to profess himself a friend to the Constitution in Church and State; a foe alike to <HI>Mass</HI> and <HI>Meeting,</HI> as far as candour will warrant, and charity admit; if to avow himself zealous equally for the Prero∣gative of the Crown, the freedom and independence of Parliament, and the privileges and liberties of the People; if to hold the rights of conscience sacred and inviolable, and to desire to see every peaceable subject in full possession of his religious sentiments, but at the same time to detest those latitudinarian principles, publickly maintained and insolently disseminated, which manifestly tend to undermine the foundations of all order and ccclesiastical establishment whatsoever; if to reverence at all times a constitutional opposition to ministry, but to abhor a factious one; if to wish to find the love of our country the universal passion, and the public good the grand aim and object of all orders and degrees of men among us; —if to do and to desire all this, and all that this implies, constitutes <HI>Toryism</HI> in the whole or in part, a <HI>Tory</HI> the author has been from his youth upon the fullest conviction, and a <HI>Tory</HI> he hopes to be to the last moment of his existence.</P></NOTE></L>
