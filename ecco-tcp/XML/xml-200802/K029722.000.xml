<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why how now, what you are consulting how you shall cheat the poor soldiers: for shame! for shame! how can you use the poor fellows so? a parcel of unfeeling wretches! Poor fellows, that risque their Lives to defend your property, and yet you make it your study to defraud them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Woman.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's very hard, Nell; you won't let us have a little picking among em. What is it to you what we do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes it is to me; I never will bear to see a soldier cheated, with my eyes open. I love a sol∣dier, and will always stand by them.</P>

<P>Mind your own business, Nell.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2nd. Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Nell, if you go on at this rate we'll tell his worship, Mr. Gage of you: He's an exciseman, and a great friend to us poor solks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nell.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's that you say, master Grinder?
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
Come forward, you sneaking sniveling sot you, I think your tricks are pretty well known. Was n't you caught soaking eggs in lime and water to make them pass for new ones: and did not you sit in the stocks for robbing the 'Squire's rookery to make your pigeon pies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2nd. Woman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, we'll tell Mr. Gage, and then what will he say to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell Mr. Gage, will you, he's a pretty protector indeed he's a disgrace to his Majesty's inkhorn—while he seizes with one hand, he smug∣gles with the other.—Why, no longer ago than last summer he was a broken attorney at Rochester, and came down here, and bought this place with his vote, and now he is both a smuggler and contractor. O my conscience, if I had the management of affairs, I would severely punish all such fellows who would be so base as to cheat a poor soldier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2nd. Woman.</SPEAKER>
<P>If his worship was here, you dare not say so. Here he comes, here he comes. Now you'll change your note.</P>

<P>Yes, and says you encourage us in it.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Woman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye, so I say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right—Soldiers are testy customers, and this is the market where the prettiest will always make the best bargains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>All.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, very true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>To besure; I hate to see an awkward gawkey come sneaking into the market, with her damned half-price countenance, and is never able to get scarce double the value of her best goods.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nell.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can hold no longer: are you not ashamed you who are a contractor, and has the honour to carry his Majesty's inkhorn at your button-hole, to teach these poor wretches all your court tricks. I'll tell you what. If I was to sit on a court mar∣tial against such a fellow as you, you should have had your deserts, from the pilfering suttler to the head contractor, you should have the cat o' nine tails, and be forced to run the gauntlet, from Cox∣heath to Warley common, that you should.</P>

<P>Foolish girl, not to accept a bribe, and follow the example of her betters.—But who have we here?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> O DAUB.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my little Gage! to be sure I am not in luck; I will not want an interpreter to shew me the views about here; and by my shoul I'll force you to accept my offer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what's your errand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why upon my conscience a very dan∣gerous one: Jack the Painter's job was a fool to it. I am come to take the Camp.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>The devil you are!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, and must bring it away with me in my pocket too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, here's my military chest; these are my colours you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, I guess your errand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then faith it's a very foolish one.
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
You must know, I got so much credit at the Fete Champetre there, that little Roscius recommended me to the Managers of Drury Lane, and so now I am a sort of deputy superintendant under Mr. Lanturnburg, the great painter; that as soon as he executes a thing, I always design it after him, my jewel; so I'm going to take a side front view of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then they are going to introduce the camp on the stage I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure you have hit it—Cox∣heath by candle light, my jewel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>And will that answer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, to be sure it will answer, when a jontlemen can have a warm seat, and see the whole tote of it for two thirteens, and be comfortable into the bargain. Why it has cost me above three guineas already, and I came the cheapest way too, for three of us went halves in the Maidstone Dilly, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and how do you like the prospect?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my shoul my jewel, I dont know what to make o'nt, so I am come to be a little far∣ther off, that I may have a nearer view of it. I think it looks like my cousin O Doiley's great bleach yard in the County of Antrim. <STAGE>(<HI>Boulard fings without</HI>)</STAGE> Tunder and wounds! what outland∣ish creature is this coming here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, that is Monsieur Boulard, the suttler.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then perhaps he can help me to a bit of something to eat, for I feel a sort of craving in my stomach after my journey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he's a very honest fellow, and will be happy in obliging you, Oh, here he comes.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> BOULARD.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! begar, Monsieur Gage, I am glad I have found you; begar I have been through Berkshire, Suffolk, and Yorkshire, and could not find you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Through Berkshire, Suffolk, and York∣shire—What the devil does he mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, he means through the regiments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boulard.</SPEAKER>
<P>By gar, mounsieur Gage, I must de∣pend on you for supply. I have got one, two, tree brigade dinners bespoke, besides the fat alder∣man and his lady from London.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you must send out a party of cooks to forage at Maidstone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boulard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Parblue, monsieur Gage, I must look to you, for by gar I have got nothing in de house to eat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then the devil burn me if I come to dine with you honey.</P>

<P>O, Sire, I have got every ting for you and Monsieur Gage. You shall have any ting you ike in von moment!</P>

<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, ha, I tank you honey: But pray now, Mr. Blaud, if your own countrymen were to come over here, would not you be a little puz∣zled to know which side to be on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boulard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Puzzled!—parblue Monsieur, I do assure you I love de English ver well, and vill never leave dem vile dey are victorious; and I do love mine own countrymen very well; but depend on it, Monsieur Gage, I vill always stay with do strongest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see, Mr. O Daub, my friend Mon∣sieur Boulard is divested of all national prejudice, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boulard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prejudice—by gar I have too much honour ever to leave de English while dey do vin de battle. But, Monsieur Gage, vill you bring your friend, and taste my vine; I have got every ting for you and your friend, I assure you. M. Gage, I vill never forsake de English so long as dey are victorious; but if mine own countrymen were to come, and make de English run, I would run a little way with dem; and if mine own country¦men were likely to overtake dem, I would stop short, bow to dem, and say, how you do, my ver good countrymen. By gar I shall be ver glad to see you both, so come along—but depend

on mine honour, Monsieur Gage, I vill never leave de English vile dey do vin de battle.—No, never! never! <STAGE>(<HI>Exit.</HI></STAGE></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said Monsieur Boulard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your sarvant Mr. Blaud, though faith to do him justice, he has forgot the fashion of his country, for when he is determined to be a rogue he is honest enough to own it. But pray what connection have you with the suttlers? You are no victualler here are you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not absolutely a victualler, but I deal in various articles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but no business is done here only by contract.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>A contractor! Why what the devil you are not risen to such preferment as that sure? I never knew you was able to furnish any con∣tract.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing more easy; the circumstance depends upon the quantity, not the quality. I got on very well lately, but at first it brought me in several confounded scrapes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I undertook to serve a regiment with hair powder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hair powder? What, and you sent them flower I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Flower! no, no—I should have saved nothing by that: I went to the fountain head—the pit, and gave 'em a plentiful stock of lime.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lime? brick and mortar lime?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, brick and mortar lime.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, what the plague, was not the cheat found out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why at first it answered the purpose very well, while the weather was fine it did charmingly, but one field-day they was all caught in a fine soaking shower; the smoke ran along the lines, ecod their heads were all slack'd in an instant, and by the time they returned to the camp, damme if
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
all their heads were not as smooth as an old half crown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very cross accident indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I stood a near chanceof being tied up to the halberts; but I excused myself by saying, they looked only like raw recruits before; but now they appeared like old veterans of service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you lost your contract I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but I soon got another; a shaving Contract to a company of grenadiers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Faith I never knew you practised that business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never handled a razor in all my life: I shave by deputy; hired Sam Sickle down from London—an excellent hand! handles a razor like a scythe;—he'll mow you down a regiment of beards in the beating a revally.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my conscience, a pretty way this of working at secondhand. I wish myself could do a little by proxy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>But come, what say you for something to eat, and a glass of my friend Boulard's wine, and drink his Majesty's health?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, my dear, and to the two camps if you will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two?—what two do you mean?</P>

I see'd two of the officers, mighty delicate looking gentlemen, they were drest quite different from the others; their jackets, indeed, are pretty much the same, but then they wear a sort of petticoat as 'twere, with a large hat and feather, and a mortal sight of hair.

<STAGE><HI>Enter,</HI> LADY GORGET, LADY SASH, <HI>and</HI> LADY PLUME.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Plume.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! my dear lady Sash, indeed you are too severe; and I'm sure if Lady Gorget had been here she would have been of my opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Sash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plume.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must know, she has been rally∣ing my poor brother, Sir Harry Bouquet, for not being in the militia, and so ill-naturedly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Sash.</SPEAKER>
<P>So he should indeed; but all I said was, he looked so french and so finical, that I thought he ran a risque of being mistaken for another female chevalier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>L. Plume.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, you must confess, that our situ∣ation is open to a little raillery: A few elegan∣cies of accomodation are considerably wanting, though one's toilet, as Sir Harry says, is not abso∣lutely spread on a drum-head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Sash.</SPEAKER>
<P>He vows there is an eternal confusion between stores military, and millinery; such a description he gives—On one shelf, cartriges and and cosmetics, pouches and patches; here a stand of arms, there a file of black pins; in one drawer bullet-moulds and essence-bottles, pistols and twee∣zer cases, with battle-powder mixed with mare∣chelle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, the malicious creature!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Plume.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray, Lady Sash, don't renew it, for see here comes Sir Harry to join us.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> SIR HARRY BOUQUET.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Lady Sash, I beg a truce; Lady Gorget I am rejoiced to see you at this de∣lectable spot, where Lady Plume, you may be amused with such a dismal variety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see, Lady Plume, he perseveres.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Sash.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you, Sir Harry, I should have been against you in your raillery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now as Gad's my judge, I admire the place; here's all the pride, pomp, and circum∣stance of glorious war! Mars in a vis-a-vis, and Bellona giving a Fete-Champetre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Plume.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now, seriously brother, what can make you judge so indifferently of the camp from any body else?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why seriously then, I think it the worst planned thing I ever beheld, for instance now, the tents are all ranged in a strait line, now Lady Gorget, can any thing be worse than a strait line; and is not there a horrid uniformity in their infinite vista of canvas? no curve, no break, and the avenue of marquees abominable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Sash.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, to be sure a circus or a crescent would have been vastly better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
<SPEAKER>L. Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a pity Sir Harry was not consulted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>As Gad's my judge I think so; for there is great capability in the ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sash.</SPEAKER>
<P>A camp cognoscenti possitively, Sir Harry, we will have you publish a treatise on military virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, but how will you excuse this; the officer's tents are close to the common soldiers; what an arrangment is that now? If I might have advised, there certainly should have been one part for the canaille, and the west end of the camp for the noblesse and persons of a certain rank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very right. I dare say you would have thought of proper marquees for hazard and quinze.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Plume.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, with festino tents, and opera pavilions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gad, the only plan that could make it supportable for a week; Well, certainly the great∣est defect in a general is want of taste.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Sash</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly, and conduct, discipline, and want of humanity, are no atonements for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>None in nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Plume.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir Harry, it is rather unlucky that the military spirit is so universal, for you will hardly find one to side with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Universal indeed; and the ridicule of it is to see how this madness had infected the whole road from Maidstone to London; the camp jargon is as current all the way as bad silver; the very postillions that drive you talk of their cavalry, and refuse to charge on a trot up the hill, the turnpikes seem converted into redoubts, and the dogs demanded the countersign of my servants, insteed of the tickets; then when I got to Maid∣stone I found the very waiters had got a smattering of tactics, for enquiring what I could have for dinner, a cursed drilled waiter, after reviewing his bill of fare, with the air of a field marshal,

proposed an advanced party of soup and bouille to be followed by the main body of ham and chic∣kens, flanked by a fricasee, with sallads in the in∣tervals and corps de reserve of sweetmeats, and whipt syllabubs to form a hollow square in the centre:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Plume.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! Sir Harry, I am very sorry you have so strong a dislike to every thing militaty; for unless you would contribute to the fortune of our little recruit—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>O madam, most willingly; and very apropos here comes your ladyship's protagec, and has brought I see the little recruit, as you desired.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here Nancy make your curtsey, or your bow to the ladies, who have so kindly promised you protection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Simple gratitude is the only return I can make, but I am sure the ladies who have hearts to do so good natured a deed, will excuse my not be∣ing able to answer them as I ought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nell.</SPEAKER>
<P>She means, an' please your ladyships, that she will always acknowledge your ladyships good∣ness to the last hour of her life, and, as in duty bound, will ever pray for your ladyships happiness and prosperity. That's what you mean, you know. <STAGE>(<HI>aside to Nancy.</HI></STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Plume.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well: But, Nancy, are you satisfied that your soldier shall continue in his duty.</P>

<P>O yes, your ladyship, she's quite satisfied.</P>
