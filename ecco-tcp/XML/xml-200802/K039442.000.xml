<P>MARINA: A PLAY OF THREE ACTS. As it is Acted at the THEATRE ROYAL IN <HI>CONVENT-GARDEN.</HI> Taken from <HI>PERICLES</HI> PRINCE of <HI>TYRE.</HI></P>
<P>By Mr. LILLO.</P>
<P><HI>LONDON:</HI> Printed for JOHN GRAY, at the <HI>Cross-Keys</HI> in the <HI>Poultry,</HI> near <HI>Cheapside.</HI> M.DCC.XXXVIII. [Price <HI>One Shilling.</HI>]</P>

<HEAD><HI>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE the</HI> Countess of <HI>Hertford.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PErmit me to hope that you will pardon the honest ambition which has encourag'd me to seek a proper Patroness for <HI>Marina</HI> in your Ladyship; whose real cha∣racter gives countenance to the imagi∣nary one, and whose constant practice is a living example of that steady vir∣tue, and exalted piety, which the Au∣thor of the old Play from whence this is taken, has happily described in his <HI>Princess of Tyre.</HI></P>
<P>Conscious of no mean views, and secur'd by the universal acknowledg∣ment
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
of your merit from the imputa∣tion of flattery, I approach your Lady∣ship, though a stranger, and without any previous application, with the less diffidence: If this Play should appear on perusal to be designed to promote something better than meer amuse∣ment, that will effectually recommend it to the favour of the Countess of <HI>Hertford.</HI></P>
<P>To place merit in the gifts of fortune, and happiness in what an hour may, and a few years certainly will bring to an end, is the folly and misery of too many who are reputed wise and great. To be truly so is with your Ladyship to regard the finest understanding, the most fruitful invention, the happiest elocution, talents far superior to wealth and dignity, but as they subserve the interest of truth and virtue, and ren∣der the possessors of them, in the midst of affluence, moderate even in the use of lawful pleasures, humble in the
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
most exalted stations, and capable of living above the world, even in the possession of all it can bestow. I am afraid and unwilling to offend. But as universal benevolence is the perfe∣ction of virtue, your Ladyship must suffer your own to be spoken of, how∣ever painful it may be to you, that others may not want a pattern for their encouragement or reprehension, as they shall improve or neglect it. A truly great mind discovers it self by nothing more than by a benign and well plac'd condescension; of which your Ladyship's known esteem for the late excellent Mrs. <HI>Rowe,</HI> is a noble instance, and an undoubted proof, amongst many others which you daily give, of the goodness of your heart and understanding, and cannot be mentioned but to your honour.</P>
<P>I can affirm, and I hope I shall be thought sincere, that what I have said doth not proceed from custom as a
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
Dedicator, but from a mind fully convinc'd of its truth in every circum∣stance, and a heart touch'd with a character so very amiable.</P>
<P>That you may long live an orna∣ment and a support of those excellent principles which you profess and pra∣ctice, and that your influence and example may do all the good that you your self can wish, is the earnest de∣sire of,</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HARD is the task, in this discerning age,</L>
<L>To find new subjects that will bear the stage;</L>
<L>And bold our bards, their low harsh strains to bring</L>
<L>Where <HI>Avon</HI>'s Swan has long been heard to sing:</L>
<L>Blest Parent of our Scene! whose matchless wit,</L>
<L>Tho' yearly reap'd, is our best harvest yet.</L>
<L>Well may that genius every heart command,</L>
<L>Who drew all nature with her own strong hand;</L>
<L>As various, as harmonious, fair and great,</L>
<L>With the same vigour and immortal heat,</L>
<L>As through each element and form she shines:</L>
<L>We view Heav'ns hand-maid in her <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s lines.</L>
<L>Though some mean scenes, injurious to his fame,</L>
<L>Have long usurp'd the honour of his Name;</L>
<L>To glean and clear from chaff his least remains,</L>
<L>Is just to him, and richly worth our pains.</L>
<L>We dare not charge the whole unequal play</L>
<L>Of <HI>Pericles</HI> on him; yet let us say,</L>
<L>As gold though mix'd with baser matter shines,</L>
<L>So do his bright inimitable lines</L>
<L>Throughout those rude wild scenes distinguish'd stand,</L>
<L>And show he touch'd them with no sparing hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With humour mix'd in your fore-fathers way,</L>
<L>We've to a single tale reduc'd our play.</L>
<L>Charming <HI>Marina</HI>'s wrongs begin the scene;</L>
<L><HI>Pericles</HI> finding her with his lost Queen,</L>
<L>Concludes the pleasing task. Shou'd as the soul,</L>
<L>The fire of <HI>Shakespear</HI> animate the whole,</L>
<L>Shou'd heights which none but he cou'd reach, appear,</L>
<L>To little errors do not prove severe.</L>
<L>If, when in pain for the event, surprize</L>
<L>And sympathetick joy shou'd fill your eyes;</L>
<L>Do not repine that so you crown an art,</L>
<L>Which gives such sweet emotions to the heart:</L>
<L>Whose pleasures, so exalted in their kind,</L>
<L>Do, as they charm the sense, improve the mind.</L>

<L>Whom my fond Parents from compassion foster'd,</L>

<L>No: I will rob gay <HI>Tellus</HI> of her weed,</L>

<L>The purple violets and marygolds</L>
<L>Shall, as a carpet, hang upon thy tomb,</L>

<L>Born in a tempest when my mother dy'd,</L>

<L>This world, to me, is like a lasting storm,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why, sweet <HI>Marina,</HI></L>
<L>Will you consume your youth in fruitless grief,</L>

<L>Shou'd your good father come at length to seek you,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know no cause, yet think the gentle Queen</L>
<L>Went hence in some displeasure. Is she well?</L>
<L>What are your thoughts?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>That she's nor well, nor gentle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sorry for't. Is the wind westerly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>South-west.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I was born the wind was north.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<L>The wind was north you say. I should not hear her,</L>
<L>Lest I relent. The Queen's enamour'd of me,</L>
<L>She prais'd my blooming youth, and good proportion;</L>
<L>And shall I lose a crown for foolish pity?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Father, as <HI>Lychorida</HI> hath told me,</L>
<L>(My Nurse that's dead) did never fear: but then,</L>
<L>Galling his kingly hands with haling ropes,</L>
<L>And chearing the faint Sailors with his voice,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>Endur'd a sea, that almost burst the deck.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when was this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<L>I said when I was born.</L>
<L>Never were waves nor winds more violent.</L>
<L>This tempest, and my birth, kill'd my poor Mother,</L>
<L>I was preserv'd, and left an Infant here.</L>
<L>Now do you think I e'er shall see my Father?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never. Come, say your prayers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<L>If you require a little space for pray'r,</L>
<L>That I'll allow you; pray, but be not tedious:</L>
<L>The Gods are quick of ear, and I'm in haste.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why will you kill me, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>T' obey the Queen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why will she have me kill'd? I never wrong'd her.</L>
<L>In all my life I never spake bad word,</L>
<L>Nor did ill turn to any living creature:</L>
<L>By chance I once trod on a simple worm,</L>
<L>But I wept for it. How have I offended?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm not to reason of the deed, but do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<L>You will not do't for all the world, I hope.</L>
<L>You are well favour'd, and your looks bespeak</L>
<L>A very gentle heart. I saw you lately,</L>
<L>When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:</L>
<L>Good sooth, it shew'd well in you: Do so now:</L>
<L>If the Queen seeks my life, come you between,</L>
<L>And save poor me the weaker.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<L>I have sworn,</L>
<L>And will dispatch.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet hear me speak once more. <STAGE>Kneeling.</STAGE></L>
<L>O do not kill me, though I know no cause</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12"/>Why I should wish to live who ne'er knew joy,</L>
<L>Or fear to die who ever fear'd the Gods;</L>
<L>But 'tis, perhaps, the property of youth</L>
<L>To doat on its new being, and depend,</L>
<L>Howe'er deprest, on pleasures in reversion.</L>
<L>You are but young your self: then, as you hope</L>
<L>To prove the fancy'd bliss of years to come,</L>
<L>Spare me, O spare me now.</L>

<L>You plead in vain,</L>
<L>Commit your soul to heaven.</L>

<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am what I appear, a simple Maid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>My long pent sorrow rages for a vent,</L>
<L>And will o'erflow in tears. Such was my wife,</L>
<L>And such an one my daughter might have been.</L>
<L>My Queen's square brows, her stature to an inch,</L>
<L>As wand-like strait, as silver-voic'd, her eyes</L>
<L>As jewels like, in pace another <HI>Juno:</HI></L>
<L>And then, like her, she starves the ears she feeds,</L>
<L>And makes them crave the more, the more she speaks.</L>
<L>Where were you born? and how did you atchieve</L>
<L>Endowments, that you make more rich by owning?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<L>If I shou'd tell my story it wou'd seem</L>
<L>Like lyes, disdaining the disguise of truth,</L>
<L>And found in the reporting.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>Prithee, speak.</L>
<L>Thou seem'st a palace for crown'd truth to dwell in:</L>
<L>No falshood can come from thee. Sweet, begin,</L>
<L>And I will make my senses to give credit</L>
<L>To points that seem impossible. I think,</L>
<L>Thou said'st thou had'st been toss'd from wrong to wrong,</L>
<L><PB N="53" REF="52"/>And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,</L>
<L>If both were open'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<L>Some such thing I said,</L>
<L>And said no more than what I thought was likely.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>Rehearse what thou hast born: If that con∣sider'd</L>
<L>Prove but the thousandth part of my endurance,</L>
<L>I will forego my sex, thou art a man,</L>
<L>And I have suffer'd like a girl. Yet thou</L>
<L>Dost look like patience, gazing on Kings graves,</L>
<L>And wooing with her smiles resolv'd extremity,</L>
<L>To spare himself, and wait a better day.</L>
<L>My most kind virgin, come and sit down by me.</L>
<L>Recount, I do beseech thee, what's thy name.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>My name, Sir, is <HI>Marina.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L><STAGE>Rising</STAGE> O! I'm mock'd,</L>
<L>And thou by some incensed God sent hither,</L>
<L>To make the world laugh at me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nay, have patience,</L>
<L>Or here I'll cease.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will, I will have patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>That name was giv'n me by a King and Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! a King's daughter too! and call'd <HI>Marina!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<L>Did you not say you wou'd believe me, Sir?</L>
<L>But not to be a troubler of your peace,</L>
<L>I will end here.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>But are you flesh and blood?</L>
<L>Have you a working pulse? are you no spirit?—</L>
<L>Substance and motion—Well, where were you born?</L>
<L>And wherefore call'd <HI>Marina?</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="54" REF="53"/>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<L>I was born</L>
<L>At sea, and from that circumstance so named.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>Hold, hold awhile. This is the rarest dream,</L>
<L>That e'er dull sleep did mock sad fool withal.</L>
<L>How shou'd this be my child?—Buried and here,</L>
<L>Living and dead at once— It cannot be.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twere best I did give o'er.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet give me leave.</L>
<L>Where were you bred? How came you to these parts?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<L>The King, my father, did in <HI>Tharsus</HI> leave me,</L>
<L>Till <HI>Philoten,</HI> the Queen, sought to destroy me;</L>
<L>And having won a villain to attempt it,</L>
<L>A crew of pirates came and rescued me,</L>
<L>Who brought me here.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>You Gods! if I'm deceiv'd</L>
<L>Ne'er let me wake again— <HI>Marina!</HI>— O!</L>
</SP>
<STAGE>takes her hand.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why do you wring my wrist? Where wou'd you draw me?</L>
<L>Why do you weep, good Sir? what moves you thus?</L>
<L>In sooth, I'm no imposture, but the daughter</L>
<L>Of good King <HI>Pericles.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'll praise the Gods,</L>
<L>Their power, and goodness, ever while I breath.</L>
<L>I've been a sinful man; but from this hour,</L>
<L>In darkness and distress I'll wait their mercy,</L>
<L>And ne'er distrust them more.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<L>You mighty Gods!</L>
<L>Whose boundless goodness still delights to triumph</L>
<L>O'er our demerits and confirm'd despair,</L>
<L>And evidence the wisdom of your counsels,</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="54"/>By shewing man the folly of his own;</L>
<L>What are you doing now to raise our wonder!</L>
<L>That voice and person grow familiar to me.</L>
<L>Doth my Lord live! hath <HI>Pericles</HI> a daughter!</L>
<L>It cannot, cannot be. Then who are these?</L>
<L>I'm deeply int'rested, yet know not how.</L>
<L>Some God, instruct me what to hope or fear,</L>
<L>To ask or deprecate. Stupid amazement</L>
<L>Obstructs my powers—When will these clouds dis∣perse,</L>
<L>And day break in on my benighted mind?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<P>But one thing more: Tell me, who was thy mother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was the daughter of the King of <HI>Cyprus.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>O let me hear the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<L>Her name <HI>Thaisa:</HI></L>
<L>Who, as <HI>Lychorida</HI> oft told me weeping,</L>
<L>Did end the very moment I began.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>You Gods! you Gods! your present kind∣ness makes</L>
<L>All my past mis'ries sport—</L>
<L>I'm <HI>Pericles</HI> of <HI>Tyre.</HI></L>

<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>My royal Father!— <STAGE>kneels; he raises her.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>You gracious Gods! if now you take me hence,</L>
<L>I shall not taste the joys of your Elizium. <STAGE>faints.</STAGE></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lys.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! ho! help here: The holy Priestess dies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>The heav'nly pow'rs forbid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lys.</SPEAKER>
<L>She did observe</L>
<L>The progress of this strange discovery,</L>
<L>With strong emotions and unusual transports.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray who is this Lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="56" REF="55"/>
<SPEAKER>Lys.</SPEAKER>
<L>A miracle of goodness, sent by Heav'n</L>
<L>To make this land most happy. In her bloom,</L>
<L>After a tempest, in the which 'twas thought</L>
<L>All her companions perish'd, she was cast</L>
<L>Here on our coast.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>Near it I lost the mother</L>
<L>Of my <HI>Marina.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hark, what musick's that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>These very hands did cast into those seas</L>
<L>The treasure of my soul.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know it now:</L>
<L>It is the harmony the spheres do make—</L>
<L>Nay do not weep— I am but overjoy'd—</L>
<L>I shall recover strait.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>Pray, how long since</L>
<L>Was this strange chance you speak of?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lys.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis, I've heard,</L>
<L>About as many years as your fair daughter</L>
<L>Seems to be old.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>I do begin to doat;</L>
<L>And yet the Gods are mighty as they're good.</L>
<L>How was she found?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lys.</SPEAKER>
<L>Close in a sailor's coffer.</L>
<L>She seem'd a breathless corpse; but my good father,</L>
<L>(Now with the Gods) by his superior skill</L>
<L>Did find it was not so, and by his art,</L>
<L>Which equall'd his humanity, restor'd her</L>
<L>To health and vigour.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where, O where's my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Thaisa</HI>'s voice!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet let me look again:</L>
<L>If he be none of mine, my sanctity</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="56"/>Shall guard me still from his licentious touch—</L>
<L>I'll none but <HI>Pericles.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>Her face, her stature,</L>
<L>That beauty that nor time nor grief cou'd change—</L>
<L>It is, it can be, none but my <HI>Thaisa.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>But dare we trust?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>By <HI>Jove,</HI> I'd not be kept</L>
<L>A moment longer absent from thy bosom,</L>
<L>Tho' I were sure as I did press thy lips,</L>
<L>My high wrought spirits wou'd dissolve to air,</L>
<L>And leave me cold and lifeless in thy arms.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<L>You sons and daughters of adversity,</L>
<L>Preserve your innocence, and each light grief,</L>
<L>(So bounteous are the Gods to those who serve them)</L>
<L>Shall be rewarded with ten thousand joys.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<L>My heart bounds in me, and wou'd fain be gone</L>
<L>Into my mother's bosom.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>See who kneels there, thy Child and mine, <HI>Thaisa,</HI></L>
<L>Bought almost with thy life.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>And cheaply purchased.</L>

<P>Happy monarch, hail.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>O good <HI>Escanes,</HI> strike me, noble Sir,</L>
<L>Give me a gash, put me to present pain;</L>
<L>Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me,</L>
<L>O'er bear the mounds of frail mortality,</L>
<L>And sweetness be my bane. O come, come both:</L>
<L>Thou whom the boundless ocean gave me back,</L>
<L>O let me bury thee a second time,</L>
<L><PB N="58" REF="57"/>And hide thee in my heart; and thou who gavest</L>
<L>Him life who did beget thee, come thou too:</L>
<L>There's endless space, and as repleat with love</L>
<L>As the great deep with waters. Wou'd our voices</L>
<L>Rise with our thoughts, we'd thank the holy Gods</L>
<L>As loud as their high thunder threaten'd us,</L>
<L>When thou wast born, and thou did'st seem to die.</L>
<L>This tribute paid not to our will but power,</L>
<L>I do resolve for <HI>Tharsus</HI>; there to strike</L>
<L>Th' inhospitable Queen.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lys.</SPEAKER>
<L>I have advice,</L>
<L>My Lord, that she is slain by <HI>Leonine,</HI></L>
<L>One who was poison'd by her.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<L>That's the wretch</L>
<L>She hir'd to murder me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lys.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis added too,</L>
<L>She dy'd in evil fame and unlamented.</L>
<L>Then, mighty Sir, repose your self awhile</L>
<L>After your weary griefs, and make our court</L>
<L>Proud with your presence.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>You're a noble host,</L>

<L>Injoy thy wish.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lys.</SPEAKER>
<L>Herein I'm highly honour'd.</L>
<L>But, royal Sir, I've yet a bolder suit.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your princely Sire preserv'd <HI>Thaisa</HI>'s life,</L>
<L>And you are master of as gracious parts</L>
<L>In mind and form, as any I e'er noted;</L>
<L>You shall prevail, be it to woo my daughter.</L>

<L>Thanks, royal Sir. If she accept my vows,</L>
<L>I am the very happiest of mankind.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<L>And she, sweet maid, most happily bestow'd.</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="58"/>O my dear Lord, he has been noble to her;</L>
<L>But that and all we've proved since our sad parting,</L>
<L>We will rehearse at leisure. I have had</L>

<L>Of my good Father's death, and that our subjects</L>
<L>In peace and loyalty do wait our coming.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>Heav'n make a star of him. Yet here, my Queen,</L>
<L>We'll celebrate their nuptials; and our selves</L>
<L>Will in fair <HI>Cyprus</HI> spend our future days,</L>
<L>And to our children leave the crown of <HI>Tyre.</HI></L>
<L>To cast new light on truth, in us is seen,</L>
<L>Tho' long assail'd with fortunes fierce and keen,</L>
<L>Virtue preserv'd from fell destruction's blast,</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN to a future race the present days</L>
<L>Shall be the theme of censure or of praise,</L>
<L>When they shall blame what's wrong, what's right allow,</L>
<L>Just as you treat your own fore-fathers now,</L>
<L>I'm thinking what a figure you will make,</L>
<L>No light concern, Sirs, where your fame's at stake.</L>
<L>I hope we need not urge your country's cause,</L>
<L>You'll guard her glory, and assert her laws,</L>
<L>Nor force your ruin'd race, mad with their pains,</L>
<L>To curse you as the authors of their chains,</L>
<L>We dare not think, we wou'd not fear, you will;</L>
<L>For <HI>Britons</HI> though provok'd, are <HI>Britons</HI> still.</L>
<L>Yet let not this kind caution give offence:</L>
<L>The surest friend to liberty is sense,</L>
<L><PB N="60" REF="59"/>How that declines the drooping arts declare;</L>
<L>Are your diversions what your fathers were?</L>
<L>At masquerades, your wisdom to display,</L>
<L>You make the stupid farce for which you pay.</L>
<L>Musick it self may be too dearly bought,</L>
<L>Nor was it sure design'd to banish thought.</L>
<L>But, Sirs, what e'er's your fate in future story,</L>
<L>Well have the <HI>British</HI> Fair secured their glory.</L>
<L>When worse than barbarism had sunk your taste,</L>
<L>When nothing pleas'd but what laid virtue waste,</L>
<L>A sacred band, determin'd, wise, and good,</L>
<L>They jointly rose to stop th' exotick flood,</L>
<L>And strove to wake, by <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s nervous lays,</L>
<L>The manly genius of <HI>Eliza</HI>'s days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be it an omen of returning sense,</L>
<L>Others adopt our softness and expence:</L>
<L>Well pleas'd such harmless insults we may bear,</L>
<L>Those follies lost we've numbers yet to spare;</L>
<L>Unquestion'd let 'em rob us of our shame—</L>
<L>We need but ask our treasure and our fame.</L>
