<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SAUL,</HI> for his Disobedience to Heaven, is afflicted with the Fiend of <HI>MELANCHOLY, p. 1. DAVID</HI> is sent for, to cure him by the Power of Music, <HI>p. 2.</HI> He comes, attended with a Choir of Shepherds; and, as the means of dispelling <HI>SAUL'S</HI> Despair, he sings the Creation of the World, and the happy Estate of our first Parents in Paradise, <HI>p. 3 to 7. SAUL</HI> is moved by the Representation; but expostulates with <HI>DAVID,</HI> "why, when others are happy, He should be miserable," <HI>p. 7. DAVID,</HI> to convince him that Guilt is the Source of Misery, sings the Fall of Man, and his Expulsion from Paradise, <HI>p. 8.</HI> This alarms the Monarch's Pride; and instead of reclaiming, provokes him to Resentment and Rage, <HI>p. 9. DAVID,</HI> superior to his Threats, awakens his Conscience, and terrifies him, by singing the Fate and Punishment of Guilt, in the Destruction of the rebellious Tribe of <HI>CHORAH</HI> by an Earthquake, and of the guilty World by the gene∣ral Deluge, <HI>p. 10. SAUL,</HI> struck with Horror, at∣tempts to kill himself, <HI>p. 13.</HI> But being prevented by his Friends, <HI>DAVID</HI> sooths his Anguish, by invoking Repentance and divine Mercy to compose his Passions,
<PB REF="3"/>
<HI>p. 14. SAUL</HI> relents into virtuous Sorrow, <HI>p. 15.</HI> But his Despair returning, <HI>DAVID</HI> calls on his at∣tendant Choir to raise a more sublime and affecting Strain, <HI>p. 16.</HI> This hath its Effect; and <HI>SAUL</HI> melts into Tears of Penitence, <HI>ib. DAVID</HI> now comforts him with the Return of the divine Favour, <HI>p. 17.</HI> To banish the Remains of Pride, he then sings his own Happiness in the humble Station of a Shepherd, <HI>ib.</HI> Still farther to compose the Monarch's Griefs, by a Strain of soft Music he throws him into a gentle Slumber; invoking celestial Visions to transport him to the Regions of the Blessed, and change his Anguish into Joy, <HI>p. 18.</HI> The desired Effects appear in his Countenance: The Fiend departs: And <HI>SAUL</HI> awakes in perfect Tranquillity, <HI>p. 19. DAVID</HI> then con∣cludes with a Song of Triumph on the Powers of Harmony, and the seraphic Hymn that attended her, as the Minister of Heaven, on the Creation of the World, <HI>p. 20.</HI></P>

<L>"And pour thy Tempest on his Guilty Head!"</L>
<L>Thus Heav'n's Decree, in Thunder's Sound,</L>

<L>The unchain'd Furies come!</L>
<L>Pale <HI>Melancholy</HI> stalks from Hell:</L>
<L>Th' abortive Offspring of her Womb,</L>

<L>By sleepless Terror SAUL possess'd,</L>
<L>Deep feels the Fiend within his tortur'd Breast.</L>
<L>Midnight Spectres round him howl:</L>
<L>Before his Eyes</L>
<L>In Troops they rise;</L>
<L>And Seas of Horror overwhelm his Soul.</L>
</LG>

<L>Haste; to JESSE'S <HI>Son</HI> repair:</L>
<L>He best can sweep the Lyre,</L>
<L>Wake the solemn sounding Air,</L>
<L>And lead the vocal Choir:</L>
<L>On ev'ry String soft-breathing Raptures dwell,</L>
<L>To sooth the Throbbings of the troubled Breast;</L>
<L>Whose magic Voice can bid the Tides of Passion swell,</L>
<L>Or lull the raging Storm to Rest.</L>

<L>Sunk on his Couch, and loathing Day,</L>
<L>The heav'n-forsaken <HI>Monarch</HI> lay:</L>
<L>To the sad Couch the <HI>Shepherd</HI> now drew near;</L>
<L>And, while th' obedient <HI>Choir</HI> stood round,</L>
<L>Prepar'd to catch the Soul commanding Sound,</L>
<L>He drop'd a gen'rous Tear.—</L>
<L>Thy pitying Aid, O GOD, impart!</L>
<L>For lo, thy poison'd Arrows drink his Heart!</L>

Hark! loud <HI>Discord</HI> breaks her Chain:</L>

<L>"Let there be Light!"—Th' <HI>Almighty</HI> said:</L>
<L>And lo, the radiant <HI>Sun,</HI></L>
<L>Flaming from his orient Bed,</L>
<L>His endless Course begun.</L>
<L>See, the twinkling <HI>Pleiads</HI> rise:</L>
<L>Thy Star, <HI>Orion,</HI> reddens in the Skies:</L>
<L>While slow around the northern Plain,</L>
<L><HI>Arcturus</HI> wheels his nightly Wane.</L>

<L>O'er Silver Clouds, and sheds a softer Day!</L>

<LG>
<L>Ye <HI>Planets,</HI> and each circling <HI>Constellation,</HI></L>
<L>In Songs harmonious tell your Generation!</L>
<L>Oh, while yon radiant <HI>Seraph</HI> turns the Spheres,</L>
<L>And on the stedfast Pole-Star stands sublime;</L>
<L>Wheel your Rounds</L>
<L>To heav'nly Sounds;</L>
<L>And sooth his Song-inchanted Ears,</L>
<L>With your celestial Chime.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="9"/>
In dumb Surprize the list'ning Monarch lay;</L>
<L>(His Woe suspended by sweet Music's Sway)</L>
<L>And awe-struck, with uplifted Eye</L>
<L>Mus'd on the new-born Wonders of the Sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lead the soothing Verse along:</L>
<L>He feels, he feels the Pow'r of Song.—</L>
<L>Ocean hastens to his Bed:</L>
<L>The lab'ring Mountain rears his rock-encumber'd Head:</L>
<L>Down his steep and shaggy Side</L>
<L>The Torrent rolls his thund'ring Tide;</L>
<L>Then smooth and clear, along the fertile Plain</L>
<L>Winds his majestic Waters to the distant Main.</L>
<L>Flocks and Herds the Hills adorn:</L>
<L>The Lark, high-soaring, hails the Morn.</L>
<L>And while along yon crimson-clouded Steep</L>
<L>The slow Sun steals into the golden Deep,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="10"/>
Hark! the solemn Nightingale</L>
<L>Warbles to the woodland Dale.</L>
<L>See, descending Angels show'r</L>
<L>Heav'n's own Bliss on <HI>Eden's</HI> Bow'r:</L>
<L>Peace on Nature's Lap reposes;</L>
<L>Pleasure strews her guiltless Roses:</L>
<L>Joys divine in Circles move,</L>
<L>Link'd with Innocence and Love.</L>
<L>Hail, happy Love, with Innocence combin'd!</L>
<L>All hail, ye sinless Parents of Mankind!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They paus'd:—the Monarch, prostrate on his Bed,</L>
<L>Submissive bow'd his Head;</L>
<L>Ador'd the Works of boundless Pow'r divine:</L>
<L>Then, Anguish-struck, he cry'd (and smote his Breast)▪</L>
<L>Why, why is Peace the welcome Guest</L>
<L>Of ev'ry Heart but Mine!</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="11"/>
Now let the solemn Numbers flow,</L>
<L>Till he feel that Guilt is Woe.</L>
<L>Heav'nly Harp, in mournful Strain</L>
<L>O'er yon weeping Bow'r complain:</L>
<L>What Sounds of bitter Pangs I hear!</L>
<L>What Lamentations wound mine Ear!</L>
<L>In vain, devoted Pair, these Tears ye shed:</L>
<L>Peace with Innocence is fled.</L>
<L>The Messengers of Grace depart:</L>
<L>Death glares, and shakes the dreadful Dart!</L>
<L>Ah, whither fly ye, by yourselves abhor'd,</L>
<L>To shun that frowning Cherub's firey Sword?—</L>
<L>Lo!</L>
<L>Hapless, hapless Pair,</L>
<L>Goaded by Despair,</L>
<L>Forlorn, thro' desert Climes they go!</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="12"/>
Wake, my Lyre! can Pity sleep,</L>
<L>When Heav'n is mov'd, and Angels weep!</L>
<L>Flow, ye melting Numbers, flow;</L>
<L>Till he feel, that Guilt is Woe.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The King, with Pride, and Shame, and Anguish, torn,</L>
<L>Shot Fury from his Eyes, and Scorn.</L>
<L>The glowing Youth,</L>
<L>Bold in Truth,</L>
<L>(So still should Virtue guilty Pow'r engage)</L>
<L>With Brow undaunted met his Rage.</L>
<L>See, his Cheek kindles into generous Fire:</L>
<L>Stern, he bends him o'er his Lyre;</L>
<L>And, while the Doom of Guilt he sings,</L>
<L>Shakes Horror from the tortur'd Strings.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="13"/>
What Sounds of Terror and Distress</L>
<L>Rend yon howling Wilderness!</L>
<L>The dreadful Thunders sound;</L>
<L>The forked Lightnings flash along the Ground.</L>
<L>Why yawns that deep'ning Gulph below?—</L>
<L>'Tis for Heav'n's rebellious Foe:—</L>
<L>Fly, ye Sons of ISRAEL, fly,</L>
<L>Who dwells in <HI>Korah's</HI> guilty Tents must die!—</L>
<L>They sink!—Have Mercy, Lord!—Their Cries</L>
<L>In dreadful Tumult rise!</L>
<L>Hark, from the Deep their loud Laments I hear!</L>
<L>They lessen now, and lessen on the Ear!</L>
<L>Now, Destruction's Strise is o'er!</L>
<L>The countless Host</L>
<L>For ever lost!</L>
<L>The Gulph is clos'd!—Their Cries are heard no more!—</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="14"/>
But Oh, my Lyre, what Accents can relate</L>
<L>Sinful Man's appointed Fate!</L>
<L>He comes, he comes! th' avenging GOD!</L>
<L>Clouds and Darkness round him rowl:</L>
<L>Tremble, Earth! Ye Mountains, nod!</L>
<L>He bows the Skies, and shakes the Pole.</L>
<L>The gloomy Banners of his Wrath unfurl'd,</L>
<L>He calls the Floods, to drown a guilty World:</L>
<L><HI>"Ruin,</HI> lift thy baleful Head;</L>
<L>"Rouze the guilty World from Sleep:</L>
<L>"Lead up thy Billows from their cavern'd Bed,</L>
<L>"And burst the Rocks that chain thee in the Deep.—</L>
<L>Now, th'impetuous Torrents rise;</L>
<L>The hoarse-ascending Deluge roars:</L>
<L>Down rush the Cataracts from the Skies;</L>
<L>The swelling Waves o'erwhelm the Shores.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="15"/>
Just, O God, is thy Decree!</L>
<L>Shall guilty Man contend with Thee!</L>
<L>Lo, <HI>Hate</HI> and <HI>Envy,</HI> sea-intomb'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>Rage</HI> with <HI>Lust</HI> in Ruin sleep;</L>
<L>And scoffing <HI>Luxury</HI> is doom'd</L>
<L>To glut the vast and rav'nous Deep!—</L>
<L>In vain from <HI>Fate</HI> th' astonish'd Remnant flies:—</L>
<L>"Shrink, ye Rocks! Ye Oceans, rise!"—</L>
<L>The tottering Cliffs no more the Floods controul;</L>
<L>Sea following Sea ingulphs the Ball:</L>
<L>O'er the sunk Hills the watry Mountains rowl,</L>
<L>And wide <HI>Destruction</HI> swallows all!—</L>
<L>Now fiercer let th'impassion'd Numbers glow:</L>
<L>Swell the Song, ye mighty Choir!</L>
<L>Wing your dreadful Darts with Fire!</L>
<L>Hear me, Monarch!—Guilt is Woe!—</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="16"/>
Thus while the frowning <HI>Shepherd</HI> pour'd along</L>
<L>The deep impetuous Torrent of his Song;</L>
<L>SAUL, stung by dire Despair,</L>
<L>Gnash'd his Teeth, and tore his Hair:</L>
<L>From his Blood, by Horror chill'd,</L>
<L>A cold and agonizing Sweat distill'd:</L>
<L>Then, foaming with unutterable Smart,</L>
<L>He aim'd a Dagger at his Heart.</L>
<L>His watchful Train prevent the Blow;</L>
<L>And call each lenient Balm, to sooth his frantic Woe:</L>
<L>But pleas'd, the <HI>Shepherd</HI> now beheld</L>
<L>His Pride by Heav'n's own Terrors quell'd:</L>
<L>Then bade his potent Lyre controul</L>
<L>The mighty Storm that rent his Soul.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="17"/>
Cease your Cares: the Body's Pain</L>
<L>A sweet Relief may find:</L>
<L>But Gums and lenient Balms are vain,</L>
<L>To heal the wounded Mind.</L>
<L>Come, fair <HI>Repentance,</HI> from the Skies</L>
<L>O sainted Maid, with upcast Eyes!</L>
<L>Descend in thy celestial Shrowd,</L>
<L>Vested in a weeping Cloud!</L>
<L>Holy Guide, descend, and bring</L>
<L><HI>Mercy</HI> from th' eternal King!</L>
<L>To his Soul your Beams impart,</L>
<L>And whisper Comfort to his Heart!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They come: O King, thine Ear incline:</L>
<L>Listen to their Voice divine:</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="18"/>
Their Voice shall every Pang compose,</L>
<L>To gentle Sorrow sooth thy Woes;</L>
<L>Till each pure Wish to Heav'n shall soar,</L>
<L>And Peace return, to part no more!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold, obedient to their great Command,</L>
<L>The lifted Dagger quits his trembling Hand:</L>
<L>Smooth'd is his Brow, where sullen Care</L>
<L>And furrow'd Horror couch'd with fell Despair:</L>
<L>No more his Eyes with Fury glow;</L>
<L>But heav'nly Grief succeeds to hell-born Woe,—</L>
<L>See, the Signs of Grace appear:</L>
<L>See the soft relenting Tear,</L>
<L>Trickling at sweet Mercy's Call!</L>
<L>Catch it, Angels, ere it fall!</L>
<L>And let the heart-sent Offering rise,</L>
<L>Heav'n's best-accepted Sacrifice!—</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="19"/>
Yet, yet again?—Ah see, the Pang returns!</L>
<L>Again with inward Fire his heaving Bosom burns!</L>
<L>Now, <HI>Shepherds,</HI> wake a mightier Strain;</L>
<L>Search the deep, heart rending Pain;</L>
<L>Till the large Floods of Sorrow roll,</L>
<L>And quench the Tortures of his Soul.</L>
<L>Almighty LORD, accept his Pang sincere!</L>
<L>Let heav'nly Hope dispell each dark Temptation!</L>
<L>And, while he pours the penitential Tear,</L>
<L>O visit him with thy Salvation!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Stoop from Heav'n, ye raptur'd Throng:</L>
<L>Sink, ye swelling Tides of Song!</L>
<L>For lo, dissolv'd by Music's melting Pow'r,</L>
<L>Celestial Sorrow rolls her plenteous Show'r.</L>
<L>O'er his wan Cheek the Colours rise;</L>
<L>And Beams of Comfort brighten in his Eyes.</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="20"/>
Happy King, thy Woes are o'er!</L>
<L>Thy God shall wound thy Soul no more:</L>
<L>The pitying Father of Mankind</L>
<L>Meets the pure-returning Mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now lowly let the rustic Measure glide,</L>
<L>To quell the dark Remains of self-consuming Pride;</L>
<L>Till Nature's home-sprung Blessings he confess,</L>
<L>And own that calm Content is Happiness.—</L>
<L>Ye Woods and Lakes, ye Cliffs and Mountains!</L>
<L>Haunted Grots, and living Fountains!</L>
<L>Listen to your <HI>Shepherd's</HI> Lay,</L>
<L>Whose artless Carols close the Day.</L>
<L>Bounding Kids around him throng;</L>
<L>The steep Rock echoes back his Song:</L>
<L>While all unseen to mortal Eye,</L>
<L>Sliding down the evening Sky,</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="21"/>
Holy <HI>Peace,</HI> tho' born above,</L>
<L>Daughter of <HI>Innocence</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI></L>
<L>Quits her Throne and Mansion bright,</L>
<L>Her Crown of Stars, and Robe of Light,</L>
