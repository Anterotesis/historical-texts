<P> An allusion to <HI>ridens moriar,</HI> the close of the celebrated Northern Ode, by the Danish king Regner Lodbrog; a translation of which is insert∣ed in the curious little volume of Runic poetry, printed for Dodsley, 1763.</P>
<P>Bartholin, in his admirable Essay on the Causes which inspired the Danes with a Contempt of Death, affirms, that it was customary with the
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
Northern warriors to sing their own exploits in the close of life. He mentions the example of a hero, named Hallmundus, who being mortally wounded, commanded his daughter to attend while he composed a poem, and to inscribe it on a tablet of wood. <BIBL>BARTHOLIN. Lib. i. cap. 10.</BIBL></P>

<P>The poetry of Provence contains many spirited satires against the enormities of the Clergy. The most remarkable, is the bold invective of the Trouba∣dour Guillaume Figueira, in which he execrates the avarice and the cruelty of Rome. The Papal cause found a female Poet to defend it: Ger∣monda of Montpellier composed a poetical reply to the satire of Figueira. <BIBL>See MILLOT's Hist. des Troubadours, vol. ii. p. 455.</BIBL></P>

<P>There never was a century utterly destitute of inge∣nious and elegant Poets, says the learned Po∣lycarp Leiser, after having patiently traced the obscure progress of Latin poetry through all the
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
dark ages. Indeed the merit of some Latin Po∣ets, in a period that we commonly suppose invol∣ved in the grossest barbarism, is singularly striking; many of these are of the Epic kind, and, as they describe the manners and customs of their respec∣tive times, a complete review of them might form a curious and entertaining work. I shall briefly mention such as appear most worthy of notice.</P>
<P>Abbo, a Parisian monk, of the Benedictine order, wrote a poem on the siege of Paris by the Nor∣mans and the Danes, at which he was present, in the year 886: it is printed in the second volume of Duchesne's Script. Francorum; and, though it has little or no poetical merit, may be regarded as an historical curiosity. The following lines, addressed to the city of Paris, in the beginning of the work, may serve as a specimen of its language:
<Q><L>Dic igitur, praepulchra polis, quod Danea munus</L>
<L>Libavit tibimet, soboles Plutonis amica,</L>
<L>Tempore quo praesul domini et dulcissimus heros</L>
<L>Gozlinus temet pastorque benignus alebat!</L>
<L>Haec, inquit, miror, narrare potest aliquisne?</L>
<L>Nonne tuis idem vidisti oculis? refer ergo:</L>
<L>Vidi equidem, jussisque tuis parebo libenter.</L></Q></P>
<P>Leiser has confounded this Poet with another of this name; but Fabricius has corrected the
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
mistake, in his Bibliotheca Latina mediae et infi∣mae Aetatis.</P>
<P>Guido, Bishop of Amiens from the year 1058 to 1076, wrote an Heroic poem on the exploits of William the Conqueror, in which, according to Ordericus Vitalis, he imitated both Virgil and Statius. William of Apulia composed, at the re∣quest of Pope Urban the IId, a poem, in five books, on the actions of the Normans in Sicily, Apulia, and Calabria, to the death of Robert Guiscard their prince; addressing his work to the son of that hero. It was written between the years 1080 and 1099; first printed in 1582, 4 to; and again in Muratori's Script. Ital.—Du Cange, in his Notes to the Alexiad of the Princess Anna Comnena, has illustrated that history by frequent and long quotations from William of Apulia; but though the learned Critic gives him the title of Scriptor Egregius, his poetry appears to me but a few degrees superior to that of the Monk Abbo, whom I have just mentioned. The Reader may judge from the following passage, which I select not only as a specimen of the Author's style, but as it shews that the wives of these martial Princes shared with them in all the perils of war:

<Q><PB N="7" REF="8"/><L>Uxor in hoc bello Roberti fortè sagittâ</L>
<L>Quâdam laesa fuit, quae vulnere territa, nullam</L>
<L>Dum sperabat opem, se penè subegerat hosti,</L>
<L>Navigio cujus se commendare volebat,</L>
<L>Instantis metuens vicina pericula lethi:</L>
<L>Hanc deus eripuit, fieri ludibria nolens</L>
<L>Matronae tantae tam nobilis et venerandae.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Princess Comnena has also celebrated the fortitude which this Heroine, whose name was Gaita, displayed in the battle; and it is remarkable, that the royal female Historian describes the noble Amazon more poetically than the Latin Poet.</P>
<P>Gualfredo, an Italian, who succeeded to the bishoprick of Siena in the year 1080, and died in 1127, wrote an Heroic poem on the expedition of Godfrey of Boulogne, which is said to be still pre∣served in MS. at Siena. I believe Gualfredo is the first Poet, in point of time, who treated of the hap∣py subject of the Crusades; which was afterwards embellished by two very elegant writers of Latin verse, Iscanus and Gunther, of whom I shall pre∣sently speak, and at length received its highest ho∣nour from the genius of Tasso. There is also an early Latin poem on this subject, the joint pro∣duction of two writers, named Fulco and Aegi∣dius, whom the accurate Fabricius places in the
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
beginning of the 13th century: the title of the work is Historia Gestorum Viae nostri Temporis Hierosolymitanae. It is printed in the fourth volume of Duchesne's Script. Franc. and with considerable additions in the third volume of Anecdota Edmundi Martene. I transcribe part of the opening of this poem, as the curious reader may have a pleasure in comparing it with that of Tasso:
<Q><L>Ardor inest, inquam, sententia fixaque menti</L>
<L>Versibus et numeris transmittere posteritati</L>
<L>Qualiter instinctu deitatis, et auspice cultu</L>
<L>Est aggressa via memorando nobilis actu,</L>
<L>Qua sacrosancti violantes jura sepulchri</L>
<L>Digna receperunt meriti commercia pravi.</L>
<L>Inque suis Francis antiqua resurgere Troja</L>
<L>Coepit, et edomuit Christo contraria regna.</L></Q>
I will only add the portrait of Godfrey:
<Q><L>Inclytus ille ducum Godefridus culmen honosque,</L>
<L>Omnibus exemplum bonitatis militiaeque,</L>
<L>Sive hasta jaculans aequaret Parthica tela,</L>
<L>Cominus aut feriens terebraret ferrea scuta,</L>
<L>Seu gladio pugnans carnes resecaret et ossa,</L>
<L>Sive eques atque pedes propelleret agmina densa,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Hic inimicitiis cunctis sibi conciliatis</L>
<L>Cunctis possessis pro Christi pace relictis</L>
<L>Arripuit callem Christum sectando vocantem.</L></Q>
The poem closes with the capture of Jerusalem.</P>
<P>Laurentius of Verona, who flourished about the year 1120, wrote an Heroic poem, in seven books, intitled, Rerum in Majorica Pisanorum. Edidit Ughellus, tom. 3. Italiae sacrae.</P>
<P>But, in merit and reputation, these early Latin Poets of modern time are very far inferior to Phi∣lip Gualtier de Chatillon, who seems to have been the first that caught any portion of true poetic spirit in Latin verse. He was Provost of the Canons of Tournay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fabricius calls him Episcopus Magalonensis. Bib. Lat. tom. ii. p. 255.</NOTE> about the year 1200, according to Mr. Warton, who has given some specimens of his style in the second Dissertation prefixed to his admirable History of English Poetry. I shall therefore only add, that the best edition of his Alexandreid, an Heroic poem in ten books on Alexander the Great, was printed at Leyden, 4to, 1558.</P>
<P>The superior merit of Josephus Iscanus, or
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
Joseph of Exeter, has been also displayed by the same judicious Encomiast, in the Dissertation I have mentioned; nor has he failed to commemo∣rate two Latin Epic Poets of the same period, and of considerable merit for the time in which they lived—Gunther, and William of Bretagny; the first was a German monk, who wrote after the year 1108, and has left various historical and poetical works; particularly two of the Epic kind—Solymarium, a poem on the taking of Jerusalem by Godfrey of Bulloign; and another, intitled Ligurinus, on the exploits of the Emperor Fre∣derick Barbarossa, which he completed during the life of that Prince. The first was never printed; of the latter there have been several editions, and one by the celebrated Melancthon, in 1569. That his poetical merit was considerable in many re∣spects, will appear from the following verses, in which he speaks of himself:<Q><L>Hoc quoque me famae, si desint caetera, solum</L>
<L>Conciliare potest, quod jam per multa latentes</L>
<L>Saecula, nec clausis prodire penatibus ausas</L>
<L>Pierides vulgare paro, priscumque nitorem</L>
<L>Reddere carminibus, tardosque citare poetas.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
William of Bretagny was preceptor to Pierre Charlot, natural son of Philip Augustus, King of France, and addressed a poem to his pupil, intitled Karlotis, which is yet unpublished; but his greater work, called Philippis, an Heroic poem in twelve books, is printed in the collections of Duchesne and Pithaeus; and in a separate 4to volume, with a co∣pious commentary by Barthius. Notwithstanding the praises bestowed on this Author by his learned Commentator, who prefers him to all his contem∣poraries, he appears to me inferior in poetic spirit to his three rivals, Gualtier de Chatillon, Iscanus, and Gunther. Yet his work is by no means despicable in its style, and may be considered as a valuable picture of the times in which he lived; for he was himself engaged in many of the scenes which he describes. His profest design is to celebrate the exploits of Philip Augustus; and he closes his poem with the death of that Monarch, which happened in 1223. He addresses his work, in two separate poetical de∣dications, to Lewis, the successor of Philip, and to Pierre Charlot his natural son, who was Bishop of Noyon in 1240, and died 1249. He seems to have been excited to this composition by the reputation of Gualtier's Alexandreid; to which he thus alludes, in the verses addressed to Lewis:
<Q><PB N="12" REF="13"/><L>Gesta ducis Macedum celebri describere versu</L>
<L>Si licuit, Gualtere, tibi, quae sola relatu</L>
<L>Multivago docuit te vociferatio famae—</L>
<L>— — — — —</L>
<L>Cur ego quae novi, proprio quae lumine vidi,</L>
<L>Non ausim magni magnalia scribere regis,</L>
<L>Qui nec Alexandro minor est virtute, nec illo</L>
<L>Urbi Romuleae totum qui subdidit orbem?</L></Q></P>
<P>He takes occasion also, in two other parts of his poem, to pay a liberal compliment to Gualtier, to whom, in poetical ability, he confesses himself inferior; but this inferiority his admirer Barthius will not allow. Of their respective talents the reader may judge, who will compare the passage which Mr. Warton has cited from the Alexan∣dreid, with the following lines, in which William of Bretagny uses the very simile of his predecessor, comparing his hero Philip to a young lion:
<Q><L>Rex dolet ereptum comitem sibi, frendit, et irae</L>
<L>Occultare nequit tectos sub pectore motus,</L>
<L>Nam rubor in vultu duplicatus prodit aperte</L>
<L>Quam gravis illustrem trahit indignatio mentem.</L>
<L>Qualiter in Lybicis spumante leunculo rictu</L>
<L>Saltibus ungue ferox, et dentibus asper aduncis,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
Fortis et horrisonis anno jam penè secundo,</L>
<L>Cui venatoris venabula forte per armos</L>
<L>Descendere levi stringentia vulnere corpus,</L>
<L>Colla rigens hirsuta jubis desaevit in hostem</L>
<L>Jam retrocedentem, nec eum tetigisse volentem,</L>
<L>Cum nihil ex facto referat nisi dedecus illo.</L>
<L>Nec mora nec requies, quin jam deglutiat ipsum,</L>
<L>Ni prudens hostis praetenta cuspide scuto</L>
<L>Unguibus objecto, dum dat vestigia retrò,</L>
<L>In loca se retrahat non irrumpenda leoni.</L>
<L>Sic puer in comitem rex debacchatur, et ipsum</L>
<L>Subsequitur presso relegens vestigia gressu.</L></Q></P>
<P>I will add the following passage from the eleventh Book, as it contains an animated portrait, and a simile more original than the preceding.</P>
<Q><L>At laevo in cornu, qui nulli marte secundus,</L>
<L>Bolonides pugnae insistit, cui fraxinus ingens</L>
<L>Nunc implet dextram, vix ulli bajula, qualem</L>
<L>In Bacchi legimus portasse Capanea cunas,</L>
<L>Quam vix fulmineo dejecit Jupiter ictu:</L>
<L>Nunc culter vitae impatiens, nunc sanguine pugni</L>
<L>Mucro rubens; gemina e sublimi vertice fulgens</L>
<L>Cornua conus agit, superasque eduxit in auras</L>
<L>E costis assumpta nigris, quas faucis in antro</L>
<L>Branchia balenae Britici colit incola ponti;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="15"/>
Ut qui magnus erat magnae superaddita moli</L>
<L>Majorem faceret phantastica pompa videri.</L>
<L>Ac velut in saltus scopulosa Bieria saltu</L>
<L>Praecipiti mittit ingenti corpore cervum,</L>
<L>Cujus multifidos numerant a cornibus annos,</L>
<L>Mense sub Octobri nondum Septembre peracto,</L>
<L>Annua quandò novis Venus incitat ignibus illum,</L>
<L>Cursitat in cervos ramosa fronte minores,</L>
<L>Omnibus ut pulsis victor sub tegmine fagi</L>
<L>Connubio cervam solus sibi subdat amatam.</L>
<L>Haud secus e peditum medio, quibus ipse rotundo</L>
<L>Ut castro cauta se circumsepserat arte,</L>
<L>Prosiliens volat in Thomam, Robertigenasque</L>
<L>Drocarum Comitem, Belvacenumque Philippum</L>
<L>Bolonides.—</L></Q>
<P>William of Bretagny had an immediate suc∣cessor in Latin poetry, who appears to have at least an equal portion of poetical spirit; the name of this Author is Nicholas de Brai, who wrote an Heroic poem on the actions of Louis the VIIIth, after the death of that Monarch, and addressed it to William of Auvergne, who was Bishop of Paris from the year 1228 to 1248. As a specimen of his descriptive power, I select the following lines, which form part of a long description of a Goblet presented to the King on his accession:

<Q><PB N="15" REF="16"/><L>—Parant intrare palatia regis</L>
<L>Magnifici cives, gratissima dona ferentes,</L>
<L>Tegmina quos ornant variis insculpta figuris;</L>
<L>Et patrem patriae jucunda voce salutant,</L>
<L>Et genibus flexis praesentant ditia dona.</L>
<L>— — — — —</L>
<L>Offertur crater, quem si sit credere dignum</L>
<L>Perditus ingenio fabricavit Mulciber auro;</L>
<L>Margine crateris totus depingitur orbis,</L>
<L>Et series rerum brevibus distincta figuris:</L>
<L>Illic pontus erat, tellus, et pendulus aer,</L>
<L>Ignis ad alta volans coeli supereminet illis:</L>
<L>Quatuor in partes orbis distinguitur, ingens</L>
<L>Circuit oceanus immensis fluctibus orbem.</L>
<L>Ingenio natura suo duo lumina fecit</L>
<L>Fixa tenore poli, mundi famulantia rebus.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Author proceeds to describe Thebes and Troy, as they are figured on this superb Goblet; and concludes his account of the workmanship with the four following lines, of peculiar beauty for the age in which they appeared:
<Q><L>Martis adulterium resupino margine pinxit</L>
<L>Mulciber, et Venerem laqueis cum Marteligavit;</L>
<L>Pluraque caelasset sub margine, sed pudor illi</L>
<L>Obstat, et ingentis renovatur causa doloris.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17"/>
This Poem, which the author seems to have left imperfect, is printed in the fifth volume of Duchesne's Script. Francorum.—England is said to have produced another Heroic Poet of con∣fiderable merit, who celebrated in Latin verse the exploits of Richard the First, and who was called Gulielmus Peregrinus, from his having attended that Prince to the Holy Land. Leland mentions him by the name of Gulielmus de Canno, and Pits calls him Poetarum sui temporis apud nos∣trates facile Princeps; but I do not find that his Work was ever printed; nor do the several bio∣graphical writers who speak of him, inform us where it exists in MS.</P>
<P>In Italy the Latin language is supposed to have been cultivated with still greater success, and the restoration of its purity is in great measure ascribed to Albertino Mussato, whose merits were first displayed to our country by the learned author of the Essay on Pope.—Mussato was a Paduan, of high rank and great talents, but unfortunate. He died in exile, 1329, and left, besides many smaller Latin pieces, an Heroic Poem, De Gestis Italorum post Henricum VII. Caesarem, seu de Obsidione Domini Canis Grandis de Verona circa Moenia Paduanae Civitatis et Conflictu ejus.—Quadrio, from whom I transcribe this title, says it is printed
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
in the tenth volume of Muratori. Vossius, who speaks of him as an Historian, asserts that he commanded in the war which is the subject of his Poem.</P>
<P>In a few years after the death of Mussato, Pe∣trarch received the laurel at Rome, for his Latin Epic poem, intitled Africa; a performance which has sunk so remarkably from the high reputation it once obtained, that the great admirer and encomiast of Petrarch, who has published three entertaining quarto volumes on his life, calls it <Q REND="inline">"Un ouvrage sans chaleur, sans invention, sans interet, qui n'a pas meme le merite de la versifi∣cation &amp; du style, &amp; dont il est impossible de sou∣tenir la lecture.</Q>—I must observe, however, that Tasso, in his Essay on Epic Poetry, bestows a very high encomium on that part of Petrarch's Latin poem, in which he celebrates the loves of Sophonisba and Masinissa; and indeed the censure of this amiable French writer, who in other points has done ample justice to the merits of Petrarch, appears to me infinitely too severe. There are many passages in this neglected Poem conceived with great force and imagination, and expressed with equal elegance of language. I shall select some verses from that part of it which has been honoured by the applause of Tasso. The
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
following lines describe the anguish of the young Numidian Prince, when he is constrained to aban∣don his lovely bride:
<Q><L>Volvitur inde thoro (quoniam sub pectore pernox</L>
<L>Saevit amor, lacerantque truces praecordia curae),</L>
<L>Uritur, invigilant moeror, metus, ira, furorque;</L>
<L>Saepè &amp; absentem lacrymans dum stringit amicam,</L>
<L>Saepè thoro dedit amplexus et dulcia verba.</L>
<L>Postquam nulla valent violento fraena dolori,</L>
<L>Incipit, et longis solatur damna querelis:</L>
<L>Cura mihi nimium, vita mihi dulcior omni,</L>
<L>Sophonisba, vale! non te, mea cura, videbo</L>
<L>Leniter aethereos posthac componere vultus,</L>
<L>Effusosque auro religantem ex more capillos;</L>
<L>Dulcia non coelum mulcentia verba Deosque</L>
<L>Oris odorati, secretaque murmura, carpam.</L>
<L>Solus ero, gelidoque insternam membra cubili;</L>
<L>Atque utinam socio componat amica sepulchro,</L>
<L>Et simul hic vetitos, illic concorditer annos,</L>
<L>Contingat duxisse mihi sors optima busti.</L>
<L>Si cinis amborum commixtis morte medullis</L>
<L>Unus erit, Scipio nostros non scindet amores.</L>
<L>O utinam infernis etiam nunc una latebris</L>
<L>Umbra simus, liceat pariter per claustra vagari</L>
<L>Myrtea, nec nostros Scipio disjungat amores.</L>
<L>Ibimus una ambo flentes, et passibus iisdem</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="20"/>
Ibimus, aeterno connexi foedere; nec nos</L>
<L>Ferreus aut aequos Scipio interrumpet amores.</L></Q></P>
<P>The well-known catastrophe of the unfortunate Sophonisba is related with much poetical spirit. The close of her life, and her first appearance in the regions of the dead, are peculiarly striking:
<Q><L>Illa manu pateramque tenens, &amp; lumina coelo</L>
<L>Attollens, Sol alme, inquit, Superique valete!</L>
<L>Masinissa, vale! nostri memor; inde malignum</L>
<L>Ceu sitiens haurit non mota fronte venenum,</L>
<L>Tartareasque petit violentus spiritus umbras.</L>
<L>—</L>

<L>Nulla magis Stygios mirantum obsessa corona</L>
<L>Umbra lacus subiit, postquam divisa triformis</L>
<L>Partibus hand aequis stetit ingens machina mundi.</L>
<L>Obtutu attonito stabant horrentia circum</L>
<L>Agmina Poenarum, sparsoque rigentia villo</L>
<L>Eumenidum tacitis inhiabant rictibus ora.</L>
<L>Regia vis oculis inerat, pallorque verendus,</L>
<L>Et vetus egregia majestas fronte manebat.</L>
<L>Indignata tamen superis, irataque morti,</L>
<L>Ibat et exiguo defigens lumina flexu.</L></Q></P>
<P>With Petrarch I may close this cursory review of the neglected authors who wrote Heroic poems
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
in Latin, during the course of the dark ages.—A peculiar circumstance induces me to add another name to the preceding list. John, Abbot of Pe∣terborough, in the reign of Edward the Third, wrote an Heroic poem, intitled Bellum Navar∣rense, 1366, de Petro rege Aragoniae &amp; Edwardo Principe. This performance, containing five hun∣dred and sixty verses, is said to be preserved in MS. in the Bodleian Library; and I have thought it worthy of notice, because it treats of the very subject on which Dryden informs us he had once projected an Epic poem.</P>
<P>Of the many Latin compositions of the Epic kind, which later times have produced, the Chris∣tiad of Vida, the Sarcotis of Massenius, and the Constantine of Mambrun, appear to me the most worthy of regard; but even these are seldom pe∣rused: and indeed the Poet, who in a polished age prefers the use of a dead language to that of a living one, can only expect, and perhaps only deserves, the attention of a few curious sequestered students.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE IV. VERSE 81.</HEAD>
<L><HI>Thy daring Dante his wild Vision sung.</HI>]</L>
<P>Dante Allighieri was born at Florence, in May 1265, of
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
an ancient and honourable family. Boccacio, who lived in the same period, has left a very cu∣rious and entertaining Treatise, on the Life, the Studies, and Manners of this extraordinary Poet; whom he regarded as his master, and for whose memory he professed the highest veneration. This interesting biographer relates, that Dante, before he was nine years old, conceived a passion for the lady whom he has immortalized in his singular Poem. Her age was near his own; and her name was Beatrice, the daughter of Folco Portinari, a noble citizen of Florence. Of this fair one the best accounts are obscure. Some refining commen∣tators have even denied her corporeal existence; affirming her to be nothing more or less than Theology: but we may question if Theology was ever the mistress of so young a lover. The passion of Dante, however, like that of his successor Pe∣trach, seems to have been of the chaste and Pla∣tonic kind, according to the account he has him∣self given of it, in one of his early productions, intitled Vita Nuova; a mixture of mysterious poetry and prose, in which he mentions both the origin of his affection, and the death of his mistress; who, according to Boccacio, died at the age of twenty-four. The same author asserts, that Dante fell into a deep melancholy in consequence of this
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
event, from which his friends endeavoured to raise him, by persuading him to marriage. After some time he followed their advice, and repented it; for he unfortunately made choice of a lady who bore some resemblance to the celebrated Xantippe. The Poet, not possessing the patience of Socrates, separated himself from her with such vehement expressions of dislike, that he never afterwards admitted her to his presence, though she had borne him several children.—In the early part of his life he gained some credit in a military character; distinguishing himself by his bravery in an action where the Florentines obtained a signal victory over the citizens of Arezzo. He became still more eminent by the acquisition of civil honours; and at the age of thirty-five he rose to be one of the chief magistrates of Florence, when that dig∣nity was conferred by the suffrages of the people. From this exaltation the Poet himself dated his principal misfortunes, as appears from the fragment of a letter quoted by Lionardo Bruni, one of his early biographers, where Dante speaks of his po∣litical failure with that liberal frankness which in∣tegrity inspires.—Italy was at that time distracted by the contending factions of the Ghibellins and the Guelphs: the latter, among whom Dante took an active part, were again divided into the Blacks
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
and the Whites. Dante, says Gravina, exerted all his influence to unite these inferior parties; but his efforts were ineffectual, and he had the misfor∣tune to be unjustly persecuted by those of his own faction. A powerful citizen of Florence, named Corso Donati, had taken measures to terminate these intestine broils, by introducing Charles of Valois, brother to Philip the Fair, King of France. Dante, with great vehemence, opposed this dis∣graceful project, and obtained the banishment of Donati and his partizans. The exiles applied to the Pope (Boniface the VIIIth), and by his assist∣ance succeeded in their design. Charles of Valois entered Florence in triumph, and those who had opposed his admission were banished in their turn. Dante had been dispatched to Rome as the ambas∣sador of his party, and was returning, when he received intelligence of the revolution in his native city. His enemies, availing themselves of his ab∣sence, had procured an iniquitous sentence against him, by which he was condemned to banishment, and his possessions were confiscated. His two en∣thusiastic biographers, Boccacio and Manetti, ex∣press the warmest indignation against this injustice of his country.—Dante, on receiving the intelli∣gence, took refuge in Siena, and afterwards in Arezzo, where many of his party were assembled.
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
An attempt was made to surprise the city of Flo∣rence, by a small army which Dante is supposed to have attended: the design miscarried, and our Poet is conjectured to have wandered to various parts of Italy, till he found a patron in the great Can della Scala, Prince of Verona, whom he has celebrated in his Poem. The high spirit of Dante was ill suited to courtly dependence; and he is said to have lost the favour of his Veronese patron by the rough frankness of his behaviour. From Ve∣rona he retired to France, according to Manetti; and Boccacio affirms that he disputed in the The∣ological Schools of Paris with great reputation. Bayle questions his visiting Paris at this period of his life, and thinks it improbable that a man, who had been one of the chief magistrates of Florence, should condescend to engage in the public squabbles of the Parisian Theologists. But the spirit both of Dante, and the times in which he lived, sufficiently account for this exercise of his talents; and his residence in France at this season is confirmed by Boccacio, in his life of our Poet, which Bayle seems to have had no opportunity of consulting.</P>
<P>The election of Henry Count of Luxemburgh to the empire, in November 1308, afforded Dante a prospect of being restored to his native city, as he attached himself to the interest of the new Em∣peror,
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
in whose service he is supposed to have writ∣ten his Latin treatise De Monarchia, in which he asserted the rights of the Empire against the en∣croachments of the Papacy. In the year 1311, he instigated Henry to lay siege to Florence; in which enterprize, says one of his Biographers, he did not appear in person, from motives of respect towards his native city. The Emperor was re∣pulsed by the Florentines; and his death, which happened in the succeeding year, deprived Dante of all hopes concerning his re-establishment in Florence.</P>
<P>After this disappointment, he is supposed to have passed some years in roving about Italy in a state of poverty and distress, till he found an honourable establishment at Ravenna, under the protection of Guido Novello da Polenta, the lord of that city, who received this illustrious exile with the most endearing liberality, continued to protect him through the few remaining years of his life, and ex∣tended his munificence to the ashes of the Poet.</P>
<P>Eloquence was one of the many talents which Dante possessed in an eminent degree. On this account he is said to have been employed on four∣teen different embassies in the course of his life, and to have succeeded in most of them. His patron Guido had occasion to try his abilities in a service of this
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
nature, and dispatched him as his ambassador to ne∣gociate a peace with the Venetians, who were pre∣paring for hostilities against Ravenna. Manetti as∣serts that he was unable to procure a public audi∣ence at Venice, and returned to Ravenna by land, from his apprehensions of the Venetian fleet; when the fatigue of his journey, and the mortifi∣cation of failing in his attempt to preserve his ge∣nerous patron from the impending danger, threw him into a fever, which terminated in death on the 14th of September 1321. He died, however, in the palace of his friend, and the affectionate Guido paid the most tender regard to his memory. This magnificent patron, says Boccacio, commanded the body to be adorned with poetical ornaments, and, after being carried on a bier through the streets of Ravenna by the most illustrious citizens, to be deposited in a marble coffin. He pronoun∣ced himself the funeral oration, and expressed his design of erecting a splendid monument in honour of the deceased: a design which his subsequent misfortunes rendered him unable to accomplish. At his request, many epitaphs were written on the Poet: the best of them, says Boccacio, by Gi∣ovanni del Virgilio of Bologna, a famous author of that time, and the intimate friend of Dante. Boccacio then cites a few Latin verses, not
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
worth transcribing, six of which are quoted by Bayle as the composition of Dante himself, on the authority of Paul Jovius. In 1483, Bernardo Bembo, the father of the celebrated Cardinal, raised a handsome monument over the neglected ashes of the Poet, with the following inscription:
<Q><L>Exigua tumuli Danthes hic sorte jacebas</L>
<L>Squallenti nulli cognita paenè situ;</L>
<L>At nunc marmoreo subnixus conderis arcu,</L>
<L>Omnibus et cultu splendidiore nites:</L>
<L>Nimirum Bembus, Musis incensus Etruscis,</L>
<L>Hoc tibi, quem in primis hae coluere, dedit.</L></Q></P>
<P>Before this period the Florentines had vainly endeavoured to obtain the bones of their great Poet from the city of Ravenna. In the age of Leo the Xth they made a second attempt, by a solemn application to the Pope for that purpose; and the great Michael Angelo, an enthusiastic admirer of Dante, very liberally offered to execute a magnifi∣cent monument to the Poet. The hopes of the Florentines were again unsuccessful. The parti∣culars of their singular petition may be found in the notes to Condivi's Life of Michael Angelo.</P>
<P>The person and manners of Dante are thus re∣presented by the descriptive pen of Boccacio:—
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
<Q REND="inline">"Fu adunque questo nostro Poeta di Mezzana statura; e poichè alla matura età fu pervenuto, andò alquanto gravetto, ed era il suo andar grave, e mansueto, di onestissimi panni sempre vestito, in quello abito, che era alla sua matura età convene∣vole; il suo volto fu lungo, il naso aquilino, gli occhi anzi grossi, che piccioli, le mascelle grandi, e dal labbro di sotto, era quel di sopra avanzato; il colore era bruno, i capelli, e la barba spessi neri e<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
crespi, e sempre nella faccia malinconico e pensoso—Ne costumi publici e domestici mirabilmente fu composto e ordinato; più che niuno altro cortese e civile; nel cibo e nel poto fu modestissimo.</Q>—Though Dante is described as much inclined to melancholy, and his genius particularly delighted in the gloomy and sublime, yet in his early period of life he seems to have possessed all the lighter graces of sprightly composition, as appears from the following airy and sportive sonnet:</P>

These lively verses were evidently written be∣fore the Poet lost the object of his earliest attach∣ment, as she is mentioned by the name of Bice. At what time, and in what place, he executed the great and singular work which has rendered him immortal, his numerous Commentators seem un∣able to determine. Boccacio asserts, that he began it in his thirty-fifth year, and had finished seven Cantos of his Inferno before his exile; that in the plunder of his house, on that event, the beginning of his poem was fortunately preserved, but remain∣ed for some time neglected; till its merit being ac∣cidently discovered by an intelligent Poet, named Dino, it was sent to the Marquis Maroello Males∣pina, an Italian nobleman, by whom Dante was then protected. The Marquis restored these lost papers to the Poet, and entreated him to proceed in a work which opened in so promising a manner. To this incident we are probably indebted for the poem of Dante, which he must have continued under all the disadvantages of an unfortunate and agitated life. It does not appear at what time he completed it; perhaps before he quitted Vero∣na, as he dedicated the Paradise to his Veronese patron.—The Critics have variously accounted for his having called his poem Comedia. He gave it that title, said one of his sons, because it opens with distress, and closes with felicity. The very high
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
estimation in which this production was held by his country, appears from a singular institution. The republic of Florence, in the year 1373, assigned a public stipend to a person appointed to read lec∣tures on the poem of Dante: Boccacio was the first person engaged in this office; but his death happening in two years after his appointment, his Comment extended only to the seventeen first Cantos of the Inferno. The critical dissertations that have been written on Dante are almost as numerous as those to which Homer has given birth: the Italian, like the Grecian Bard, has been the subject of the highest panegyric, and of the grossest invective. Voltaire has spoken of him with that precipitate vivacity, which so frequently led that lively Frenchman to insult the reputation of the noblest writers. In one of his entertaining letters, he says to an Italian Abbé, <Q REND="inline">"Je fais grand cas du courage, avec lequel vous avez osé dire que Dante etoit un fou, et son ouvrage un monstre—Le Dante pourra entrer dans les bibliotheques des curieux, mais il ne sera jamais lu."</Q> But more temperate and candid Critics have not been wanting, to display the merits of this original Poet. Mr. Warton has introduced into his last volume on English Poetry, a judicious and spirited summary of Dante's performance. We
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
have several versions of the celebrated story of Ugo∣lino; but I believe no entire Canto of Dante has hitherto appeared in our language, though his whole work has been translated into French, Spanish, and Latin verse. The three Cantos which follow were translated a few years ago, to oblige a particular friend. The Author has since been solicited to execute an entire translation of Dante: but the extreme inequality of this Poet would render such a work a very laborious undertaking; and it appears very doubtful how far such a version would interest our country. Per∣haps the reception of these Cantos may discover to<PB N="33" REF="34"/>the Translator the sentiments of the public. At all events, he flatters himself that the ensuing por∣tion of a celebrated poem may afford some pleasure from its novelty, as he has endeavoured to give the English reader an idea of Dante's peculiar manner, by adopting his triple rhyme; and he does not re∣collect that this mode of versification has ever ap∣peared before in our language: it has obliged him, of course to make the number of translated lines correspond exactly with those of the original. The difficulties attending this metre will sufficiently shew themselves, and obtain some degree of indul∣gence from the intelligent and candid reader.</P>

<HEAD>CANTO I.</HEAD>
<L>IN the mid season of this mortal strife,</L>
<L>I found myself within a gloomy grove,</L>
<L>Far wandering from the ways of perfect life:</L>
<L>The place I know not, where I chanc'd to rove;</L>
<L>It was a wood so wild, it wounds me sore</L>
<L>But to remember with what ills I strove:</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="36"/>
Such still my dread, that death is little more.</L>
<L>But I will tell the good which there I found.</L>
<L>High things 'twas there my fortune to explore:</L>
<L>Yet how I enter'd on that secret ground</L>
<L>I know not to explain; so much in sleep</L>
<L>My mortal senses at that hour were drown'd.</L>
<L>But when I reach'd the bottom of a steep,</L>
<L>That rose to terminate the dreary vale,</L>
<L>Which made cold terrors thro' my bosom creep,</L>
<L>I look'd on high, where breath'd a purer gale,</L>
<L>And saw the summit glisten with that ray</L>
<L>Which leads the wand'rer safe o'er hill and dale.</L>
<L>This soon began to chase those fears away,</L>
<L>Which held my struggling spirit bound so fast</L>
<L>During that night of darkness and dismay:</L>
<L>And, as th' exhausted wretch, by fortune cast</L>
<L>Safe from the stormy deep upon the shore,</L>
<L>Turns to survey the perils he has past,</L>
<L>So turn'd my soul, ere yet its dread was o'er,</L>
<L>Back to contemplate that mysterious strait</L>
<L>Where living mortal never past before.</L>
<L>Arising soon from this repose elate,</L>
<L>Up the rough steep my journey I begin,</L>
<L>My lower foot sustaining all my weight.</L>
<L>Here, while my toilsome way I slowly win,</L>
<L>Behold a nimble Panther springs to sight!</L>
<L>And beauteous spots adorn his motley skin:</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="38"/>
He at my presence shew'd no signs of fright,</L>
<L>But rather strove to bar my doubtful way;</L>
<L>I often turn'd, and oft resolv'd on flight.</L>
<L>'Twas now the chearful hour of rising day;</L>
<L>The sun advanc'd in that propitious sign</L>
<L>Which first beheld his radiant beams display</L>
<L>Creation's charms, the work of love divine!</L>
<L>So that I now was rais'd to hope sublime,</L>
<L>By these bright omens of a fate benign,</L>
<L>The beauteous Beast and the sweet hour of prime.</L>
<L>But soon I lost that hope; and shook yet more</L>
<L>To see a Lion in this lonely clime:</L>
<L>With open jaws, athirst for human gore,</L>
<L>He rush'd towards me in his hungry ire;</L>
<L>Air seem'd to tremble at his savage roar.</L>
<L>With him, enflam'd with every fierce desire,</L>
<L>A famish'd She-wolf, like a spectre, came;</L>
<L>Beneath whose gripe shall many a wretch expire.</L>
<L>Such sad oppression seiz'd my sinking frame,</L>
<L>Such horror at these strange tremendous sights,</L>
<L>My hopes to climb the hill no longer aim;</L>
<L>But, as the wretch whom lucre's lust incites,</L>
<L>In the curst hour which scatters all his wealth,</L>
<L>Sinks in deep sorrow, dead to all delights,</L>
<L>So was I robb'd of all my spirit's health,</L>
<L>And to the quarter where the sun grows mute,</L>
<L>Driven by this Beast, who crept on me by stealth.</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="40"/>
While I retreated from her dread pursuit,</L>
<L>A manly figure my glad eyes survey'd,</L>
<L>Whose voice was like the whisper of a lute.</L>
<L>Soon as I saw him in this dreary glade,</L>
<L>Take pity on me, to this form I cry'd,</L>
<L>Be thou substantial man, or fleeting shade!—</L>
<L>A man I was (the gracious form reply'd)</L>
<L>And both my parents were of Lombard race;</L>
<L>They in their native Mantua liv'd and dy'd:</L>
<L>I liv'd at Rome, rich in a monarch's grace,</L>
<L>Beneath the good Augustus' letter'd reign,</L>
<L>While fabled Gods were serv'd with worship base.</L>
<L>A Bard I was: the subject of my strain</L>
<L>That just and pious Chief who sail'd from Troy,</L>
<L>Sinking in ashes on the sanguine plain.</L>
<L>But thou, whom these portentous sights annoy,</L>
<L>Why dost thou turn? why not ascend the mount,</L>
<L>Source of all good, and summit of all joy!—</L>
<L>Art thou that Virgil? thou! that copious fount</L>
<L>Of richest eloquence, so clear, so bright?</L>
<L>I answer'd, blushing at his kind account;</L>
<L>O thou! of Poets the pure guide and light!</L>
<L>Now let me profit by that fond esteem</L>
<L>Which kept thy song for ever in my sight!</L>
<L>Thou art my Master! thou my Bard supreme,</L>
<L>From whom alone my fond ambition drew</L>
<L>That purer style which I my glory deem!</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="42"/>
O! from this Beast, so hideous to the view,</L>
<L>Save me! O save me! thou much-honour'd Sage!</L>
<L>For growing terrors all my power subdue.—</L>

<L>And from this wild thy spirit disengage;</L>
<L>For that terrific Beast, which caus'd thy fears,</L>
<L>Worries each wretch that in her road she spies,</L>
<L>Till death at length, his sole relief, appears.</L>
<L>So keen her nature, sleep ne'er seals her eyes;</L>
<L>Her ravenous hunger no repast can sate;</L>
<L>Food only serves to make its fury rise.</L>
<L>She calls from different animals her mate;</L>
<L>And long shall she produce an offspring base,</L>
<L>Then from a mighty victor meet her fate.</L>
<L>Nor pomp nor riches shall that victor grace,</L>
<L>But truth, and love, and all excelling worth;</L>
<L>He from his rescu'd land all ill shall chase,</L>
<L>The saviour of the realm that gives him birth,</L>
<L>Of Italy, for whom Camilla fell,</L>
<L>And Turnus, fighting for his native earth,</L>
<L>And Nisus, with the friend he lov'd so well.</L>
<L>The Beast this victor to that den shall drive</L>
<L>Whence Envy let her loose, her native hell!</L>
<L>Now for thy good, well-pleas'd, I will contrive,</L>
<L>That by my aid, while I thy steps controul,</L>
<L>Thou shalt in safety at those realms arrive</L>

Where thou shalt see the tortur'd spirits roll,</L>

<L>Then shalt thou visit those, who in a state</L>
<L>Of purifying fire are still content,</L>
<L>And for their promis'd heaven submissive wait:</L>
<L>If to that heaven thy happy course is bent,</L>
<L>A worthier guard will soon my place supply;</L>
<L>A purer spirit, for thy guidance sent!</L>
<L>For that Immortal Power, who rules on high,</L>
<L>Because I ne'er his perfect laws have known,</L>
<L>His sacred presence will to me deny.</L>
<L>There in the realms of light he fix'd his throne;</L>
<L>There o'er the world Almighty Lord he reigns:</L>
<L>O blest the servant whom he deigns to own!—</L>

<L>And by that God, tho' not reveal'd to thee,</L>
<L>That I may 'scape from these, and heavier pains,</L>
<L>Be thou my leader, where thy way is free!</L>

<L>Thro' me, to Misery's devoted train.</L>
<L>Justice and power in my Great Founder join,</L>
<L>And love and wisdom all his fabrics rear;</L>
<L>Wisdom above controul, and love divine!</L>
<L>Before me, Nature saw no works appear.</L>

<L>These characters, where misty darkness reign'd,</L>

<L>Ah Sire! (said I) hard things are here contain'd.</L>
<L>He, sapient Guide! my farther question sav'd,</L>
<L>With spirit answering, "Here all doubt resign,</L>

Then, stretching forth his hand with gentle grace,</L>
<L>From whence new comfort thro' my bosom flows,</L>
<L>He led me in to that mysterious place.</L>
<L>There sighs, and wailings, and severest woes,</L>
<L>Deeply resounded through the starless air;</L>
<L>And as I first advanc'd, my fears arose.</L>
<L>Each different cry, the murmuring notes of care,</L>
<L>Accents of misery, and words of ire,</L>
<L>With all the sounds of discord and despair,</L>
<L>To form such tumult in this scene conspire,</L>
<L>As flies for ever round the gloomy waste,</L>
<L>Like sand when quicken'd by the whirlwind's fire.</L>
<L>I then (my mind with error still disgrac'd)</L>
<L>Exclaim'd—O Sire! what may this trouble mean?</L>
<L>What forms are these by sorrow so debas'd?—</L>
<L>He soon reply'd—Behold, these bounds between,</L>

<L>They join those angels, of ignoble name,</L>

<L>Heaven shuts them out from its unsullied bound:</L>

<L>Lest e'en the damn'd o'er these their triumphs sound.</L>
<L>O Sire! (said I) whence then this grievous pain,</L>
<L>That on our ears their lamentations grate?—</L>
<L>This (he reply'd) I will in brief explain:</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="60"/>
These have no hope that death may mend their fate;</L>
<L>And their blind days form so confus'd a mass,</L>
<L>They pine with envy of each other's state:</L>
<L>From earth their name has perish'd like the grass;</L>
<L>E'en Mercy views them with a scornful eye.</L>
<L>We'll speak of them no more: Behold! and pass!—</L>
<L>I look'd, and saw a banner rais'd on high,</L>
<L>That whirl'd, unconscious of a moment's stand,</L>
<L>With rapid circles in the troubled sky:</L>
<L>Behind it, driven by Fate's supreme command,</L>
<L>Came such a host! I ne'er could have believ'd</L>
<L>Death had collected so complete a band.</L>
<L>When now I had the forms of all perceiv'd,</L>
<L>I saw the shade of that ignoble priest,</L>
<L>Of sovereign power by indolence bereav'd.</L>
<L>Instant I knew, from every doubt releas'd,</L>
<L>These were the base, the miscreated crew</L>
<L>To whom the hate of God had never ceas'd.</L>
<L>Vile forms! ne'er honor'd with existence true!</L>

<L>These the black blood from their gall'd faces wrung;</L>
<L>Blood mixt with tears, that, trickling to their feet,</L>
<L>Fed the fastidious worms which round them clung.</L>
<L>When now I farther pierc'd the dark retreat,</L>
<L>Numbers I saw beside a mighty stream:</L>
<L>Sudden I cry'd—Now, Sire, let me entreat</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="62"/>
To know what forms in distant prospect seem</L>
<L>To pass so swiftly o'er a flood so wide,</L>
<L>As I discern by this imperfect gleam?—</L>

<L>With downcast eyes, that pardon now beseech,</L>
<L>And hoping silence may that pardon win,</L>
<L>E'en to the river I abstain'd from speech.</L>
<L>And lo! towards us, with a shrivell'd skin,</L>
<L>A hoary boatman steers his crazy bark,</L>
<L>Exclaiming, "Woe to all ye sons of sin!</L>
<L>Hope not for heaven, nor light's celestial spark!</L>
<L>I come to waft you to a different lot;</L>
<L>To Torture's realm, with endless horror dark:</L>
<L>And thou, who living view'st this sacred spot,</L>
<L>Haste to depart from these, for these are dead!"</L>
<L>But when he saw that I departed not,</L>
<L>In wrath he cry'd, "Thro' other passes led,</L>

<L>But in a bark to bear thy firmer tread."—</L>
<L>O Charon, said my Guide, thy strife give o'er;</L>
<L>For thus 'tis will'd in that superior scene</L>
<L>Where will is power. Seek thou to know no more!—</L>

But all the naked shades began to quake;</L>
<L>Their shuddering figures grew more pale than earth,</L>

<L>And all mankind; the place, the hour, that saw</L>
<L>Their first formation, and their future birth.</L>
<L>Then were they driven, by Fate's resistless law,</L>
<L>Weeping, to that sad scene prepar'd for all</L>
<L>Who fear not God with pure devotion's awe.</L>
<L>Charon, with eyes of fire and words of gall,</L>
<L>Collects his crew, and high his oar he wields,</L>
<L>To strike the tardy wretch who slights his call.</L>

<L><HI>The gay Boccacio tempts th' Italian Muse.</HI>]</L>
<P>Boc∣cacio was almost utterly unknown to our country as a Poet, when two of our most accomplished Critics restored his poetical reputation.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrwhitt, to whom Chaucer is as deeply indebted as a Poet can be to the judgment and erudition of his commentator, has given a sketch of Boccacio's Theseida, in his introductory dis∣course to the Canterbury Tales; and Mr. War∣ton has enriched the first volume of his History of English Poetry with a considerable specimen of this very rare Italian Epic poem, of which our country is said to possess but a single copy.—The father of Boccacio was an Italian merchant, a na∣tive<PB N="65" REF="66"/>of Certaldo, near Florence, who in his travels attached himself to a young woman of Paris; and our Poet is supposed to have been the illegitimate offspring of that connection. He was born in 1313, and educated as a student of the canon law; but a sight of Virgil's tomb, according to Filippo Villani, his most ancient Biographer, made him resolve to relinquish his more irksome pursuits, and devote himself entirely to the Muses. His life seems to have been divided between literature and love, as he was equally remarkable for an amo∣rous disposition, and a passionate attachment to study. His most celebrated mistress was Mary of Arragon, the natural daughter of Robert, King of Naples, the generous and enthusiastic patron of Petrarch. To this lady, distinguished by the name
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
of The Fiammetta, Boccacio addressed his capital poem, the Theseida; telling her, in an introduc∣tory letter, that it contained many allusions to the particular circumstances of their own secret attach∣ment. In his latter days he retired to Certaldo, and died there in the year 1475, of a disorder supposed to have arisen from excessive application. Few au∣thors have rendered more essential service to the re∣public of letters than Boccacio, as he not only con∣tributed very much to the improvement of his na∣tive language, but was particularly instrumental in promoting the revival of ancient learning: a merit which he shared with Petrarch. The tender and ge∣nerous friendship which subsisted between these two engaging authors, reflects the highest honour on both; and their letters to each other may be ranked among the most interesting productions of that pe∣riod. Boccacio composed, according to Quadrio, no less than thirty-four volumes. His Novels are universally known: his Poetical Works are as follow: 1. La Theseida in Ottava Rima. 2. L'A∣morosa Visione in Terza Rima. 3. Il Filostrato in Ottava Rima. 4. Il Ninfale Fiesolano in Ot∣tava Rima.—He piqued himself on being the first Poet who sung of martial subjects in Italian verse; and he has been generally supposed the inventor of the Ottava Rima, the common Heroic measure<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
of the Italian Muse: but Quadrio has shewn that it was used by preceding writers; and Pasquier, in his Recherches, has quoted two stanzas of Thi∣baud King of Navarre, written in the same mea∣sure, on Blanch queen of France, who died in 1252. The neglect into which the Poems of Boccacio had fallen appears the more striking, as he pecu∣liarly prided himself on his poetical character; in∣forming the world, by an inscription on his tomb, that Poetry was his favourite pursuit—Studium fuit alma Poesis, are the last words of the epitaph which he composed for himself.</P>

<L><HI>She spoke exulting, and Trissino sung.</HI>]</L>
<P>Giovan∣ni Giorgio Trissino was born of a noble family in Vicenza, 1478: he was particularly distin∣guished by a passion for Poetry and Architecture; and one of the very few Poets who have been rich enough to build a palace. This he is said to have done from a design of his own, under the direction of the celebrated Palladio. He had the merit of writing the first regular tragedy in the Italian lan∣guage, entitled Sophonisba; but in his Epic poem he is generally allowed to have failed, though some learned Critics (and Gravina amongst them) have
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>
endeavoured to support the credit of that per∣formance. His subject was the expulsion of the Goths from Italy by Belisarius; and his poem consists of twenty-seven books, in blank verse. He addressed it to the Emperor Charles the Vth; and professes in his Dedication to have taken Aristotle for his preceptor, and Homer for his guide.</P>
<P>The reader will excuse a trifling anachronism, in my naming Trissino before Ariosto, for poe∣tical reasons. The Italia Liberata of the former was first published in 1548; the Orlando Furioso, in 1515. Trissino died at Rome, 1550; Ariosto at Ferrara, 1533.</P>

<L><HI>Of a poetic Sire the more poetic Son.</HI>]</L>
<P>The repu∣tation of Torquato Tasso has almost eclipsed that of his father Bernardo, who was himself a consi∣derable Poet, and left two productions of the Epic kind, L'Amadigi, and Il Floridante: the latter remained unfinished at his death, but was after∣wards published in its imperfect state by his son; who has spoken of his father's poetry with filial regard, in his different critical works. The Ama∣digi was written at the request of several Spanish
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
Grandees, in the court of Charles the Vth, and first printed in Venice by Giolito, 1560. The curious reader may find an entertaining account of the Author's ideas in composing this work, among his Letters, volume the first, page 198. I cannot help remarking, that the letter referred to contains a simile which Torquato has introduced in the opening of his Jerusalem Delivered.</P>
<P>The Italians have formed a very pleasing and valuable work, by collecting the letters of their eminent Painters; which contain much informa∣tion on points relating to their art. The letters of their Poets, if properly selected, might also form a few interesting volumes: as a proof of this, I shall insert a short letter of the younger Tasso, because it seems to have escaped the notice of his Biogra∣phers, and relates the remarkable circumstance of his having deliberated on five different subjects before he decided in favour of Goffredo;

</LETTER><BIBL>Opere di Torquato Tasso, tom. ix. p. 240.</BIBL></P>
<P>This letter is the more worthy of notice, as the subject on which Tasso fixed has been called by Voltaire, and perhaps very justly, <Q REND="inline">Le plus grand qu'on ait jamais choisi.</Q> <Q REND="inline">Le Tasse l'a traité digne∣ment,</Q> adds the lively Critic, with unusual can∣dour;
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
yet in his subsequent remarks he is peculi∣arly severe on the magic of the Italian Poet. The merits of Tasso are very ably defended against the injustice of French criticism, and particularly that of Boileau and Voltaire, in the well-known Let∣ters on Chivalry and Romance. Indeed the genius of this injured Poet seems at length to triumph in the country where he was most insulted, as the French have lately attempted a poetical version of his Jerusalem.</P>
<P>I enter not into the history of Tasso, or that of his rival Ariosto, because the public has lately re∣ceived from Mr. Hoole a judicious account of their lives, prefixed to his elegant versions of their re∣spective Poems.</P>

<L><HI>Shall gay Tassoni want his festive crown.</HI>]</L>
<P>Ales∣sandro Tassoni, the supposed inventor of the mo∣dern Heroi-comic Poetry, was born at Modena, 1565. His family was noble; but his parents dy∣ing during his infancy, left him exposed to vexa∣tious law-suits, which absorbed a great part of his patrimony, and rendered him dependant. In 1599 he was engaged as Secretary to Cardinal Ascanio
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
Colonna, whom he attended on an embassy into Spain. He was occasionally dispatched into Italy on the service of that Prelate, and in the course of one of these expeditions wrote his Observations on Petrarch. In 1605 he is supposed to have quitted the service of the Cardinal, and to have lived in a state of freedom at Rome, where, in 1607, he became the chief of a literary society, intitled Academia degli Umoristi. He was afterwards em∣ployed in the service of Charles Emanuel, Duke of Savoy; which, after suffering many vexations in it, he quitted with a design of devoting himself to study and retirement. But this design he was induced to relinquish, and to serve the Cardinal Lodovisio, nephew of Pope Gregory XV. from whom he received a considerable stipend. On the death of this patron, in 1632, he was recalled to his native city by Francis the First, Duke of Mo∣dena, and obtained an honourable establishment in the court of that Prince. Age had now rendered him unable to enjoy his good fortune: his health declined in the year of his return, and he expired in April 1635. His genius was particularly disposed to lively satire; and the incidents of his life had a tendency to increase that disposition. After having passed many vexatious and unprofitable years in
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>
the service of the Great, he had his portrait painted, with a fig in his hand; and Muratori supposes him to have written these two lines on the oc∣casion:
<Q><L>Dextera cur ficum, quaeris, mea gestet inanem:</L>
<L>Longi operis merces haec fuit; aula dedit.</L></Q></P>
<P>His celebrated Poem, La Secchia rapita, was written, as he has himself declared, in 1611; be∣gun in April, and finished in October. It was cir∣culated in MS. received with the utmost avidity, and first printed at Paris 1622. In a catalogue of the numerous editions of the Secchia, which Muratori has prefixed to his Life of Tassoni, he includes an English translation of it, printed 1715.</P>

<L><HI>And rashly judges that her Vega's lyre.</HI>]</L>
<P>The fa∣mous Lope de Vega, frequently called the Shake∣spear of Spain, is perhaps the most fertile Poet in the annals of Parnassus; and it would be difficult to name any author, ancient or modern, so universally idolized while living by all ranks of people, and so magnificently rewarded by the liberality of the Great. He was the son of Felix de Vega and Francisca Fernandez, who were both descended from honour∣able
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
families, and lived in the neighbourhood of Madrid. Our Poet was born in that city, on the 25th of November 1562. He was, according to his own expression, a Poet from his cradle; and, begin∣ning to make verses before he had learned to write, he used to bribe his elder school-fellows with a part of his breakfast, to commit to paper the lines he had composed. Having lost his father while he was still a child, he engaged in a frolic, very natural to a lively boy, and wandered with another lad to va∣rious parts of Spain, till, having spent their mo∣ney, and being conducted before a magistrate at Segovia, for offering to sell a few trinkets, they were sent home again to Madrid. Soon after this adven∣ture, our young Poet was taken under the protec∣tion of Geronimo Manrique, Bishop of Avila, and began to distinguish himself by his dramatic com∣positions, which were received with great applause by the public, though their author had not yet completed his education; for, after this period, he became a member of the university of Alcala, where he devoted himself for four years to the study of philosophy. He was then engaged as Secretary to the Duke of Alva, and wrote his Arcadia in compliment to that patron; who is frequently mentioned in his Occasional Poems. He quitted that employment on his marriage with Isabel de
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
Urbina, a lady (says his friend and biographer Pe∣rez de Montalvan) beautiful without artifice, and virtuous without affectation. His domestic happi∣ness was soon interrupted by a painful incident:—Having written some lively verses in ridicule of a person who had taken some injurious freedom with his character, he received a challenge in conse∣quence of his wit; and happening, in the duel which ensued, to give his adversary a dangerous wound, he was obliged to fly from his family, and shelter himself in Valencia. He resided there a considerable time; but connubial affection recalled him to Madrid. His wife died in the year of his return. His affliction on this event led him to re∣linquish his favourite studies, and embark on board the Armada which was then preparing for the in∣vasion of England. He had a brother who served in that fleet as a lieutenant; and being shot in an engagement with some Dutch vessels, his virtues were celebrated by our afflicted Poet, whose heart was peculiarly alive to every generous affection. After the ill success of the Armada, the disconsolate Lope de Vega returned to Madrid, and became Secretary to the Marquis of Malpica, to whom he has addressed a grateful Sonnet. From the service of this Patron he passed into the household of the Count of Lemos, whom he celebrates as an ini∣mitable
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
Poet. He was once more induced to quit his attendance on the Great, for the more invi∣ting comforts of a married life. His second choice was Juana de Guardio, of noble birth and sin∣gular beauty. By this lady he had two children; a son, who died in his infancy, and a daughter, named Feliciana, who survived her father. The death of his little boy is said to have hastened that of his wife, whom he had the misfortune to lose in about seven years after his marriage. Having now experienced the precariousness of all human en∣joyments, he devoted himself to a religious life, and fulfilled all the duties of it with the most exempla∣ry piety; still continuing to produce an astonishing variety of poetical compositions. His talents and his virtues procured him many unsolicited honours. Pope Urban the VIIIth sent him the Cross of Malta, with the title of Doctor in Divinity, and appointed him to a place of profit in the Apostolic Chamber; favours for which he expressed his gratitude by de∣dicating his Corona Tragica (a long poem on the fate of Mary Queen of Scots) to that liberal Pon∣tiff. In his seventy-third year he felt the approaches of death, and prepared himself for it with the utmost composure and devotion. His last hours were at∣tended by many of his intimate friends, and parti∣cularly his chief patron the Duke of Sessa, whom
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
he made his executor; leaving him the care of his daughter Feliciana, and of his various manuscripts. The manner in which he took leave of those he loved was most tender and affecting. He said to his Disciple and Biographer, Montalvan, That true fame consisted in being good; and that he would willingly exchange all the applauses he had received, to add a single deed of virtue to the ac∣tions of his life. Having given his dying benedic∣tion to his daughter, and performed the last cere∣monies of his religion, he expired on the 25th of August 1635.</P>
<P>The splendor of his funeral was equal to the respect paid to him while living.—His magnificent patron, the Duke of Sessa, invited the chief nobili∣ty of the kingdom to attend it. The ceremony was prolonged through the course of several days; and three sermons in honour of the deceased were deli∣vered by three of the most celebrated preachers. These are printed with the works of the Poet, and may be considered as curious specimens of the false eloquence which prevailed at that time. A volume of encomiastic verses, chiefly Spanish, and written by more than a hundred and fifty of the most distinguished characters in Spain, was pub∣lished soon after the death of this lamented Bard. To this collection his friend and disciple Perez de
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
Montalvan prefixed a circumstantial account of his life and death, which I have chiefly followed in the preceding narrative. An ingenious Tra∣veller, who has lately published a pleasing volume of Letters on the Poetry of Spain, has imputed the duel, in which Lope de Vega was engaged, to the gallantries of his first wife; but Montalvan's rela∣tion of that adventure clears the honor of the lady, whose innocence is still farther supported by a poem written in her praise by Pedro de Medina Medi∣nilla: it is printed in the works of our Poet, who is introduced in it, under the name of Belardo, ce∣lebrating the excellencies and lamenting the loss of his departed Isabel.</P>
<P>Of the person and manners of Lope de Vega, his friend Montalvan has only given this general account:—that his frame of body was particularly strong, and preserved by temperance in continued health;—that in conversation he was mild and unassuming; courteous to all, and to women pecu∣liarly gallant;—very eager when engaged in the business of his friends, and somewhat careless in the management of his own. Of his wealth and cha∣rity I shall have occasion to speak in a subsequent note. The chief expences in which he indulged himself were books and pictures; of the latter, he distributed a few as legacies to his intimate friends:
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>
to the Duke of Sessa, a fine portrait of himself; and to me, says Montalvan, another, painted when he was young, surrounded by dogs, monkies, and other monsters, and writing in the midst of them, without attending to their noise.—Of the ho∣nours paid to this extraordinary Poet, his Biogra∣pher asserts that no person of eminence visited Spain without seeking his personal acquaintance; that men yielded him precedence when they met him in the streets, and women saluted him with benedictions when he passed under their windows. If such homage can be deserved by the most un∣wearied application to poetry, Lope de Vega was certainly entitled to it. He declared that he con∣stantly wrote five sheets a day; and his biographers, who have formed a calculation from this account, conclude the number of his verses to be no less than 21,316,000. His country has very lately pub∣lished an elegant edition of his poems in 19 quarto volumes; his dramatic works are to be added to this collection, and will probably be still more volumi∣nous. I shall speak only of the former.—Among his poems there are several of the Epic kind; the three following appear to me the most remark∣able. 1. La Dragontea. 2. La Hermosura de An∣gelica. 3. La Jerusalem Conquistada. The Dra∣gontea consists of ten cantos, on the last expedition
<PB N="80" REF="81"/>
and death of our great naval hero Sir Francis Drake, whom the Poet, from his excessive partiality to his country, considers as an avaricious pirate, or rather, as he chuses to call him, a marine Dragon: and it may be sufficient to observe that he has treated him accordingly. The poem on Angelica seems to have been written in emulation of Ariosto, and it is founded on a hint in that Poet: it was composed in the early part of our Author's life, and contains many compliments to his sovereign Philip the IId: it consists of 20 cantos, and closes with Angelica's being restored to her beloved Medoro. In his Je∣rusalem Conquistada he enters the lists with Tasso, whom he mentions in his preface as having sung the first part of the history which he had chosen for his subject. From the great name of Lope de Vega, I had some thoughts of presenting to the reader a sketch of this his most remarkable poem; but as an Epic Poet he appears to me so much infe∣rior to Tasso, and to his countryman and cotempo∣rary Ercilla, that I am unwilling to swell these ex∣tensive notes by an enlarged description of so un∣successful a work: the Author has prophesied, in the close of it, that, although neglected by his own age, it would be esteemed by futurity:—a singular proof that even the most favoured writers are frequently disposed to declaim against the period in which they
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
live. If Lope de Vega could think himself neglect∣ed, what Poet may ever expect to be satisfied with popular applause?—But to return to his Jerusalem Conquistada. Richard the Second of England, and Alphonso the Eighth of Castile, are the chief heroes of the poem; which contains twenty cantos, and closes with the unfortunate return of these confe∣derate Kings, and the death of Saladin. It was first printed 1609, more than twenty years after the first appearance of Tasso's Jerusalem.—One of the most amiable peculiarities in the character of Lope de Vega, is the extreme liberality with which he commends the merit of his rivals. In his Laurel de Apolo, he celebrates all the eminent Spanish and Portugueze Poets; he speaks both of Camoens and Ercilla with the warmest applause. Among the most pleasing passages in this poem, is a com∣pliment which he pays to his father, who was, like the father of Tasso, a Poet of considerable talents.</P>
<P>Among the smaller pieces of Lope de Vega, there are two particularly curious: a descriptive poem on the garden of his patron the Duke of Alva; and a sonnet in honour of the Invincible Armada. The latter may be considered as a complete model of Spanish bombast: <Q REND="inline">"Go forth and burn the world,"</Q> says the Poet, addressing himself to that
<PB N="82" REF="83"/>
mighty fleet; <Q REND="inline">"my sighs will furnish your sails with a never-failing wind; and my breast will supply your cannon with inexhaustible fire."</Q>—Perhaps this may be equalled by a Spanish charac∣ter of our Poet, with which I shall close my imper∣fect account of him. It is his friend and biogra∣pher Montalvan, who, in the opening of his life, bestows on him the following titles: El Doctor Frey Lope Felix de Vega Carpio, Portento del Orbe, Gloria de la Nacion, Lustre de la Patria, Oracula de la Lengua, Centro de la Fama, Assumpio de la Invidia, Cuydado de la Fortuna, Fenix de los Siglos, Principe de los Versos, Orfeo de las Ciencias, Apolo de las Musas, Horacio de los Poetas, Virgilio de los Epicos, Homero de los Heroycos, Pindaro de los Lyricos, Sofocles de los Tragicos, y Terencio de los Comicos, Unico entre los Mayores, Mayor entre los Grandes, y Grande a todas Luzes, y en todas Materias.</P>

<L><HI>The brave Ercilla sounds, with potent breath,</HI></L>
<L><HI>His Epic trumpet in the fields of death.</HI>]</L>
<P>Don Alonzo de Ercilla y Zuniga was equally distin∣guished as a Hero and a Poet; but this exalted character, notwithstanding his double claim to our
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
regard, is almost totally unknown in our country; and I shall therefore endeavour to give the English reader the best idea that I can, both of his gallant life, and of his singular poem.—He was born in Madrid, on the 7th of August 1533, the third son of Fortun Garcia de Ercilla, who, tho' descended from a noble family, pursued the profession of the law, and was so remarkable for his talents, that he acquired the appellation of <Q REND="inline">"The subtle Spa∣niard."</Q> The mother of our Poet was also noble, and from her he inherited his second title, Zuniga: Ercilla was the name of an ancient castle in Biscay, which had been long in the possession of his pater∣nal ancestors. He lost his father while he was yet an infant; a circumstance which had great influence on his future life: for his mother was received, after the decease of her husband, into the household of the Empress Isabella, the wife of Charles the Vth, and had thus an early opportunity of introducing our young Alonzo into the palace. He soon ob∣tained an appointment there, in the character of page to the Infant Don Philip, to whose service he devoted himself with the most heroic enthusiasm, though Philip was a master who little deserved so generous an attachment. At the age of fourteen, he attended that Prince in the splendid progress which he made, at the desire of his Imperial father,
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>
through the principal cities of the Netherlands, and through parts of Italy and Germany. This sin∣gular expedition is very circumstantially recorded in a folio volume, by a Spanish historian named Juan Christoval Calvete de Estrella, whose work affords a very curious and striking picture of the manners and ceremonies of that martial and ro∣mantic age. All the cities which were visited by the Prince contended with each other in magnifi∣cent festivity: the brilliant series of literary and warlike pageants which they exhibited, though they answered not their design of conciliating the affection of the sullen Philip, might probably awaken the genius of our youthful Poet, and excite his ambition to acquire both poetical and military fame. In 1551, he returned with the Prince into Spain, and continued there for three years; at the end of which he attended his royal master to Eng∣land, on his marriage with Queen Mary, which was celebrated at Winchester in the summer of 1554. At this period Ercilla first assumed the military character; for his sovereign received ad∣vice, during his residence at London, that the mar∣tial natives of Arauco, a district on the coast of Chile, had revolted from the Spanish government; and dispatched an experienced officer, named Al∣derete, who attended him in England, to subdue
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
the insurrection, investing him with the command of the rebellious province. Ercilla embarked with Alderete; but that officer dying in his passage, our Poet proceeded to Lima. Don Hurtado de Men∣doza, who commanded there as Viceroy of Peru, appointed his son Don Garcia to supply the place of Alderete, and sent him with a considerable force to oppose the Araucanians. Ercilla was engaged in this enterprize, and greatly distinguished him∣self in the obstinate contest which ensued. The noble character of the Barbarians who maintained this unequal struggle, and the many splendid feats of valour which this scene afforded, led our author to the singular design of making the war, in which he was himself engaged, the subject of an Heroic poem; which he intitled "La Araucana," from the name of the country. As many of his own particular adventures may be found in the follow∣ing summary of his work, I shall not here enlarge on his military exploits; but proceed to one of the most mortifying events of his life, which he briefly mentions in the conclusion of his poem. After passing with great honour through many and vari∣ous perils, he was on the point of suffering a dis∣graceful death, from the rash orders of his young and inconsiderate Commander. On his return, from an expedition of adventure and discovery, to
<PB N="86" REF="87"/>
the Spanish city of Imperial, he was present at a scene of public festivity displayed there, to cele∣brate the accession of Philip the IId to the crown of Spain. At a kind of tournament, there arose an idle dispute between Ercilla and Don Juan de Pi∣neda, in the heat of which the two disputants drew their swords; many of the spectators joined in the broil; and a report arising that the quarrel was a mere pretence, to conceal some mutinous design, the hasty Don Garcia, their General, committed the two antagonists to prison, and sentenced them both to be publicly beheaded. Ercilla himself de∣clares, he was conducted to the scaffold before his precipitate judge discovered the iniquity of the sen∣tence; but his innocence appeared just time enough to save him; and he seems to have been fully rein∣stated in the good opinion of Don Garcia, as, among the complimentary sonnets addressed to Er∣cilla, there is one which bears the name of his Ge∣neral, in which he styles him the Divine Alonzo, and celebrates both his military and poetical genius. But Ercilla seems to have been deeply wounded by this affront; for, quitting Chile, he went to Callao, the port of Lima, and there embarked on an expe∣dition against a Spanish rebel, named Lope de Aguirre, who, having murdered his captain, and usurped the chief power, was perpetrating the most
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>
cruel enormities in the settlement of Venezuela. But Ercilla learned, on his arrival at Panama, that this barbarous usurper was destroyed; he therefore resolved, as his health was much impaired by the hardships he had passed, to return to Spain. He arrived there in the twenty-ninth year of his age; but soon left it, and travelled, as he himself informs us, through France, Italy, Germany, Silesia, Mo∣ravia, and Pannonia; but the particulars of this ex∣pedition are unknown. In the year 1570 he ap∣peared again at Madrid, and was married to Maria Bazan, a lady whom he contrives to celebrate in the course of his military poem. He is said to have been afterwards gentleman of the bed-chamber to the Emperor Rodolph the IId, a prince who had been educated at Madrid: but the connection of our Poet with this Monarch is very indistinctly re∣corded; and indeed all the latter part of his life is little known. In the year 1580 he resided at Ma∣drid, in a state of retirement and poverty. The time and circumstances of his death are uncertain: it is proved that he was living in the year 1596, by the evidence of a Spanish writer named Mosquera, who, in a treatise of military discipline, speaks of Ercilla as engaged at that time in celebrating the victories of Don Alvaro Bazan, Marques de Santa Cruz, in a poem which has never appeared, and is
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
supposed to have been left imperfect at his death. Some anecdotes related of our Poet afford us ground to hope that his various merits were not en∣tirely unrewarded. It is said, that in speaking to his sovereign Philip, he was so overwhelmed by diffidence that language failed him: <Q REND="inline">"Don Alon∣zo!"</Q> replied the King, <Q REND="inline">"speak to me in writing."</Q> He did so, and obtained his request.—The Spanish Historian Ovalle, who has written an account of Chile, in which he frequently supports his narra∣tion by the authority of Ercilla, affirms that our Poet presented his work to Philip with his own hand, and received a recompence from the King. But in this circumstance I fear the Historian was mistaken, as he supposes it to have happened on the return of Ercilla from Chile; and our Poet, in a distinct portion of his work, which was not pub∣lished till many years after that period, expressly declares, in addressing himself to Philip, that all his attempts to serve him had been utterly unrequited. Ercilla left no legitimate family; but had some na∣tural children, the most eminent of which was a daughter, who was advantageously married to a nobleman of Portugal.</P>
<P>In that elegant collection of Spanish Poets, "<HI>Parnaso Espanol,</HI>" there is a pleasing little amorous poem, written by Ercilla in his youth,
<PB N="89" REF="90"/>
which is peculiarly commended by Lope de Vega; who has bestowed a very generous encomium on our Poet, in his "<HI>Laurel de Apolo.</HI>" But the great and singular work which has justly render∣ed Ercilla immortal, is his Poem intitled Arau∣cana, which was published in three separate parts: the first appeared in 1577; he added the second in the succeeding year; and in 1590 he printed a complete edition of the whole. It was ap∣plauded by the most eminent writers of Spain; and Cervantes, in speaking of Don Quixote's Library, has ranked it among the choicest trea∣sures of the Castilian Muse. Voltaire, who speaks of Ercilla with his usual spirit and inaccuracy, has the merit of having made our Poet more ge∣nerally known, though his own acquaintance with him appears to have been extremely slight; for he affirms that Ercilla was in the battle of Saint Quintin: a mistake into which he never could have fallen, had he read the Araucana. In∣deed the undistinguishing censure which he passes on the poem in general, after commending one particular passage, sufficiently proves him a perfect stranger to many subsequent parts of the work; yet his remark on the inequality of the Poet is just. Ercilla is certainly unequal; but, with all his defects, he appears to me one of the most ex∣traordinary
<PB N="90" REF="91"/>
and engaging characters in the poeti∣cal world. Perhaps I am a little partial to him, from the accidental circumstance of having first read his poem with a departed friend, whose opi∣nions are very dear to me, and who was particu∣larly fond of this military Bard. However this may be, my idea of Ercilla's merit has led me to hazard the following extensive sketch of his work:—it has swelled to a much larger size than I at first intended; for I was continually tempted to extend it, by the desire of not injuring the pe∣culiar excellencies of this wonderful Poet. If I have not utterly failed in that desire, the English reader will be enabled to judge and to enjoy an author, who, considering his subject and its execu∣tion, may be said to stand single and unparalleled in the host of Poets. His beauties and his de∣fects are of so obvious a nature, that I shall not enlarge upon them; but let it be remembered, that his poem was composed amidst the toils and perils of the most fatiguing and hazardous service, and that his verses were sometimes written on scraps of leather, from the want of better mate∣rials. His style is remarkably pure and per∣spicuous; and, notwithstanding the restraint of rhyme, it has frequently all the ease, the spirit, and the volubility of Homer. I wish not, how∣ever,
<PB N="91" REF="92"/>
to conceal his defects; and I have there∣fore given a very fair account of the strange episode he introduces concerning the history of Dido, which has justly fallen under the ridicule of Voltaire. I must however observe, as an apo∣logy for Ercilla, that many Bards of his country have considered it as a point of honour to defend the reputation of this injured lady, and to attack Virgil with a kind of poetical Quixotism for hav∣ing slandered the chastity of so spotless a heroine. If my memory does not deceive me, both Lope de Vega and Quevedo have employed their pens as the champions of Dido. We may indeed very readily join the laugh of the lively Frenchman against our Poet on this occasion; but let us re∣collect that Ercilla has infinitely more Homeric spirit, and that his poem contains more genuine Epic beauties, than can be found in Voltaire.</P>
<P>Ercilla has been honoured with many poetical en∣comiums by the writers of his own country; and, as I believe the most elegant compliment which has been paid to his genius is the production of a Spanish lady, I shall close this account of him with a translation of the Sonnet, in which she celebrates both the Hero and the Poet.</P>

<HEAD>A SKETCH OF THE ARAUCANA.</HEAD>
<P>THE Poem of Ercilla opens with the follow∣ing exposition of his subject:<Q><L>I Sing not love of ladies, nor of sights</L>
<L>Devis'd for gentle dames by courteous knights;</L>
<L>Nor feasts, nor tourneys, nor that tender care</L>
<L>Which prompts the Gallant to regale the Fair;</L>
<L>But the bold deeds of Valour's fav'rite train,</L>
<L>Those undegenerate sons of warlike Spain,</L>
<L>Who made Arauco their stern laws embrace,</L>
<L>And bent beneath their yoke her untam'd race.</L>
<L>Of tribes distinguish'd in the field I sing;</L>
<L>Of nations who disdain the name of King;</L>
<L>Courage, that danger only taught to grow,</L>
<L>And challenge honour from a generous foe;</L>
<L>And persevering toils of purest fame,</L>
<L>And feats that aggrandize the Spanish name:</L>
<L>For the brave actions of the vanquish'd spread</L>
<L>The brightest glory round the victor's head.</L></Q></P>
<P>He then addresses his work to his sovereign, Phi∣lip the Second, and devotes his first Canto to the description of that part of the New World which forms the scene of his action, and is called Arauco;
<PB N="95" REF="96"/>
a district in the province of Chile. He paints the singular character and various customs of its war∣like inhabitants with great clearness and spirit. In many points they bear a striking resemblance to the ancient Germans, as they are drawn with a kind of poetical energy by the strong pencil of Tacitus. The first Canto closes with a brief ac∣count how this martial province was subdued by a Spanish officer named Valdivia; with an intima∣tion that his negligence in his new dominion gave birth to those important exploits which the Poet proposes to celebrate.</P>
<DIV6 N="2" TYPE="canto">
<HEAD>CANTO II.</HEAD>
<P>ERCILLA begins his Cantos much in the manner of Ariosto, with a moral reflection; sometimes rather too much dilated, but generally expressed in easy, elegant, and spirited verse.—The following lines faintly imitate the two first stanzas of his second Canto:
<Q><L>Many there are who, in this mortal strife,</L>
<L>Have reach'd the slippery heights of splendid life:</L>
<L>For Fortune's ready hand its succour lent;</L>
<L>Smiling she rais'd them up the steep ascent,</L>
<L><PB N="96" REF="97"/>
To hurl them headlong from that lofty seat</L>
<L>To which she led their unsuspecting feet;</L>
<L>E'en at the moment when all fears disperse,</L>
<L>And their proud fancy sees no sad reverse.</L>
<L>Little they think, beguil'd by fair sucess,</L>
<L>That Joy is but the herald of Distress:</L>
<L>The hasty wing of Time escapes their sight,</L>
<L>And those dark evils that attend his flight:</L>
<L>Vainly they dream, with gay presumption warm,</L>
<L>Fortune for them will take a steadier form;</L>
<L>She, unconcern'd at what her victims feel,</L>
<L>Turns with her wonted haste her fatal wheel.</L></Q></P>
<P>After blaming his countrymen for abusing their good fortune, the Poet celebrates, in the following spirited manner, the eagerness and indignation with which the Indians prepared to wreak their vengeance on their Spanish oppressors:
<Q><L>The Indians first, by novelty dismay'd,</L>
<L>As Gods rever'd us, and as Gods obey'd;</L>
<L>But when they found we were of woman born,</L>
<L>Their homage turn'd to enmity and scorn:</L>
<L>Their childish error when our weakness show'd,</L>
<L>They blush'd at what their ignorance bestow'd;</L>
<L>Fiercely they burnt with anger and with shame,</L>
<L>To see their masters but of mortal frame.</L>
<L><PB N="97" REF="98"/>
Disdaining cold and cowardly delay,</L>
<L>They seek atonement, on no distant day:</L>
<L>Prompt and resolv'd, in quick debate they join,</L>
<L>To form of deep revenge their dire design.</L>
<L>Impatient that their bold decree should spread,</L>
<L>And shake the world around with sudden dread,</L>
<L>Th' assembling Chieftains led so large a train,</L>
<L>Their ready host o'erspread th' extensive plain.</L>
<L>No summons now the soldier's heart requires;</L>
<L>The thirst of battle every breast inspires;</L>
<L>No pay, no promise of reward, they ask,</L>
<L>Keen to accomplish their spontaneous task;</L>
<L>And, by the force of one avenging blow,</L>
<L>Crush and annihilate their foreign foe.</L>
<L>Of some brave Chiefs, who to this council came,</L>
<L>Well may'st thou, Memory, preserve the name;</L>
<L>Tho' rude and savage, yet of noble soul,</L>
<L>Justly they claim their place on Glory's roll,</L>
<L>Who robbing Spain of many a gallant son,</L>
<L>In so confin'd a space such victories won;</L>
<L>Whose fame some living Spaniards yet may spread,</L>
<L>Too well attested by our warlike dead.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Poet proceeds to mention, in the manner of Homer, but in a much shorter catalogue, the principal chieftains, and the number of their re∣spective vassals.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="99"/>
Uncouthly as their names must sound to an English ear, it seems necessary to run through the list, as these free and noble-minded savages act so distinguished a part in the course of the poem.—Tucapel stands first; renowned for the most inveterate enmity to the Christians, and leader of three thousand vassals: Angol, a valiant youth, attended by four thousand: Cayocupil, with three; and Millarapue, an elder chief, with five thousand: Paycabi, with three thousand; and Lemolemo, with six: Maregnano, Gualèmo, and Lebopia, with three thousand each: Elicura, dis∣tinguished by strength of body and detestation of servitude, with six thousand; and the ancient Colocolo with a superior number: Ongolmo, with four thousand; and Puren, with six: the fierce and gigantic Lincoya with a still larger train. Pete∣guelen, lord of the valley of Arauco, prevented from personal attendance by the Christians, dis∣patches six thousand of his retainers to the assembly: the most distinguished of his party are Thomè and Andalican. The Lord of the maritime province of Pilmayquen, the bold Caupolican, is also unable to appear at the opening of the council. Many other Chieftains attended, whose names the Poet suppresses, lest his prolixity should offend. As they begin their business in the style of the ancient
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>
Germans, with a plentiful banquet, they soon grow exasperated with liquor, and a violent quarrel en∣sues concerning the command of the forces for the projected war: an honour which almost every chieftain was arrogant enough to challenge for himself. In the midst of this turbulent debate, the ancient Colocolo delivers the following harangue, which Voltaire prefers (and I think with great jus∣tice) to the speech of Nestor, on a similar occa∣sion, in the first Iliad:
<Q><LG>
<L>Assembled Chiefs! ye guardians of the land!</L>
<L>Think not I mourn from thirst of lost command,</L>
<L>To find your rival spirits thus pursue</L>
<L>A post of honour which I deem my due.</L>
<L>These marks of age, you see, such thoughts disown</L>
<L>In me, departing for the world unknown;</L>
<L>But my warm love, which ye have long possest,</L>
<L>Now prompts that counsel which you'll find the best.</L>
<L>Why should we now for marks of glory jar?</L>
<L>Why wish to spread our martial name afar?</L>
<L>Crush'd as we are by Fortune's cruel stroke,</L>
<L>And bent beneath an ignominious yoke,</L>
<L>Ill can our minds such noble pride maintain,</L>
<L>While the fierce Spaniard holds our galling chain.</L>
<L>Your generous fury here ye vainly shew;</L>
<L>Ah! rather pour it on th' embattled foe!</L>
<L><PB N="100" REF="101"/>
What frenzy has your souls of sense bereav'd?</L>
<L>Ye rush to self-perdition, unperceiv'd.</L>
<L>'Gainst your own vitals would ye lift those hands,</L>
<L>Whose vigour ought to burst oppression's bands?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If a desire of death this rage create,</L>
<L>O die not yet in this disgraceful state!</L>
<L>Turn your keen arms, and this indignant flame,</L>
<L>Against the breast of those who sink your fame,</L>
<L>Who made the world a witness of your shame.</L>
<L>Haste ye to cast these hated bonds away,</L>
<L>In this the vigour of your souls display;</L>
<L>Nor blindly lavish, from your country's veins,</L>
<L>Blood that may yet redeem her from her chains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>E'en while I thus lament, I still admire</L>
<L>The fervor of your souls; they give me fire:</L>
<L>But justly trembling at their fatal bent,</L>
<L>I dread some dire calamitous event;</L>
<L>Lest in your rage Dissention's frantic hand</L>
<L>Should cut the sinews of our native land.</L>
<L>If such its doom, my thread of being burst,</L>
<L>And let your old compeer expire the first!</L>
<L>Shall this shrunk frame, thus bow'd by age's weight,</L>
<L>Live the weak witness of a nation's fate?</L>
<L>No: let some friendly sword, with kind relief,</L>
<L>Forbid its sinking in that scene of grief.</L>
<L>Happy whose eyes in timely darkness close,</L>
<L>Sav'd from that worst of sights, his country's woes!</L>
<L><PB N="101" REF="102"/>
Yet, while I can, I make your weal my care,</L>
<L>And for the public good my thoughts declare.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Equal ye are in courage and in worth;</L>
<L>Heaven has assign'd to all an equal birth:</L>
<L>In wealth, in power, and majesty of soul,</L>
<L>Each Chief seems worthy of the world's controul.</L>
<L>These gracious gifts, not gratefully beheld,</L>
<L>To this dire strife your daring minds impell'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But on your generous valour I depend,</L>
<L>That all our country's woes will swiftly end.</L>
<L>A Leader still our present state demands,</L>
<L>To guide to vengeance our impatient bands;</L>
<L>Fit for this hardy task that Chief I deem,</L>
<L>Who longest may sustain a massive beam:</L>
<L>Your rank is equal, let your force be try'd,</L>
<L>And for the strongest let his strength decide.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>The Chieftains acquiesce in this proposal; which, as Voltaire justly observes, is very natural in a nation of savages. The beam is produced, and of a size so enormous, that the Poet declares himself afraid to specify its weight. The first Chieftains who engage in the trial support it on their shoulders five and six hours each; Tucapel fourteen; and Lincoya more than double that num∣ber; when the assembly, considering his strength as almost supernatural, is eager to bestow on him
<PB N="102" REF="103"/>
the title of General: but in the moment he is exulting in this new honour, Caupolican arrives without attendants. His person and character are thus described by the Poet:
<Q><L>Tho' from his birth one darken'd eye he drew</L>
<L>(The viewless orb was of the granate's hue),</L>
<L>Nature, who partly robb'd him of his sight,</L>
<L>Repaid this failure by redoubled might.</L>
<L>This noble youth was of the highest state;</L>
<L>His actions honour'd, and his words of weight:</L>
<L>Prompt and resolv'd in every generous cause,</L>
<L>A friend to Justice and her sternest laws:</L>
<L>Fashion'd for sudden feats, or toils of length,</L>
<L>His limbs possess'd both suppleness and strength:</L>
<L>Dauntless his mind, determin'd and adroit</L>
<L>In every quick and hazardous exploit.</L></Q></P>
<P>This accomplished Chieftain is received with great joy by the assembly; and, having surpassed Lincoya by many degrees in the trial, is invested with the supreme command. He dispatches a small party to attack a neighbouring Spanish fort: they execute his orders, and make a vigorous assault. After a arp conflict they are repulsed; but in the moment of their retreat Caupolican arrives with his army to their support. The Spaniards in despair
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
evacuate the fort, and make their escape in the night: the news is brought to Valdivia, the Spanish Commander in the city of Concepcion;—and with his resolution to punish the Barbarians the canto concludes.</P>
</DIV6>

<P>With this spirited and generous invective against that prevailing vice of his countrymen, which sullied the lustre of their most brilliant exploits, Ercilla opens his 3d canto. He does not scruple to assert, that the enmity of the Indians arose from the avaricious severity of their Spanish oppressors; and he accuses Valdivia on this head, though he gives him the praise of a brave and gallant officer.—This Spaniard, on the first intelligence of
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
the Indian insurrection, dispatched his scouts from the city where he commanded. They do not re∣turn. Pressed by the impatient gallantry of his troops, Valdivia marches out:—they soon dis∣cover the mangled heads of his messengers fixed up as a spectacle of terror on the road. Valdivia deliberates what measures to pursue. His army entreat him to continue his march. He consents, being piqued by their insinuations of his disgracing the Spanish arms. An Indian ally brings him an account that twenty thousand of the confederated Indians are waiting to destroy him in the valley of Tucapel. He still presses forward; arrives in sight of the fort which the Indians had destroyed, and engages them in a most obstinate battle; in the description of which, the Poet introduces an original and striking simile, in the following manner:
<Q><LG>
<L>The steady pikemen of the savage band,</L>
<L>Waiting our hasty charge, in order stand;</L>
<L>But when th' advancing Spaniard aim'd his stroke,</L>
<L>Their ranks, to form a hollow square, they broke;</L>
<L>An easy passage to our troop they leave,</L>
<L>And deep within their lines their foes receive;</L>
<L>Their files resuming then the ground they gave,</L>
<L>Bury the Christians in that closing grave.</L>
</LG><LG>
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
<L>As the keen Crocodile, who loves to lay</L>
<L>His silent ambush for his finny prey,</L>
<L>Hearing the scaly tribe with sportive sound</L>
<L>Advance, and cast a muddy darkness round,</L>
<L>Opens his mighty mouth, with caution, wide,</L>
<L>And, when th' unwary fish within it glide,</L>
<L>Closing with eager haste his hollow jaw,</L>
<L>Thus satiates with their lives his rav'nous maw:</L>
<L>So, in their toils, without one warning thought,</L>
<L>The murd'rous foe our little squadron caught</L>
<L>With quick destruction, in a fatal strife,</L>
<L>From whence no Christian soldier 'scap'd with life.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Such was the fate of the advanced guard of the Spaniards. The Poet then describes the conflict of the main army with great spirit:—ten Spaniards dis∣tinguish themselves by signal acts of courage, but are all cut in pieces. The battle proceeds thus:
<Q><LG>
<L>The hostile sword, now deeply dy'd in blood,</L>
<L>Drench'd the wide field with many a sanguine flood;</L>
<L>Courage still grows to form the fierce attack,</L>
<L>But wasted vigour makes the combat slack:</L>
<L>No pause they seek, to gain exhausted breath,</L>
<L>No rest, except the final rest of death:</L>
<L>The wariest combatants now only try</L>
<L>To snatch the sweets of vengeance ere they die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="106" REF="107"/>
<L>The fierce disdain of death, and scorn of flight,</L>
<L>Give to our scanty troop such wond'rous might,</L>
<L>The Araucanian host begin to yield;</L>
<L>They quit with loss and shame the long-fought field:</L>
<L>They fly; and their pursuers shake the plain</L>
<L>With joyous shouts of Victory and Spain.</L>
<L>But dire mischance, and Fate's resistless sway,</L>
<L>Gave a strange issue to the dreadful day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>An Indian Youth, a noble Chieftain's son,</L>
<L>Who as our friend his martial feats begun,</L>
<L>Our Leader's Page, by him to battle train'd,</L>
<L>Who now beside him the hard fight sustain'd,</L>
<L>As he beheld his kindred Chiefs retire,</L>
<L>Felt an indignant flash of Patriot fire;</L>
<L>And thus incited to a glorious stand</L>
<L>The flying champions of his native land:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Misguided Country! by vain fear possest,</L>
<L>Ah whither dost thou turn thy timid breast?</L>
<L>Ye brave compatriots, shall your ancient fame</L>
<L>Be vilely buried in this field of shame?</L>
<L>Those laws, those rights, ye gloried to defend,</L>
<L>All perish, all, by this ignoble end!</L>
<L>From Chiefs of dreaded power, and honour'd worth,</L>
<L>Ye sink to abject slaves, the scorn of earth!</L>
<L>To the pure founders of your boasted race</L>
<L>Ye give the cureless wound of deep disgrace!</L>
<L><PB N="107" REF="108"/>
Behold the wasted vigor of your foe!</L>
<L>See, bath'd in sweat and blood, their coursers blow!</L>
<L>Lose not your mental force, your martial fires,</L>
<L>Our best inheritance from generous sires;</L>
<L>Sink not the noble Araucanian name</L>
<L>From glory's summit to the depths of shame;</L>
<L>Fly, fly the servitude your souls detest!</L>
<L>To the keen sword oppose the dauntless breast.</L>
<L>Why shew ye frames endued with manly power,</L>
<L>Yet shrink from danger in the trying hour?</L>
<L>Fix in your minds the friendly truth I speak;</L>
<L>Vain are your fears, your terror blind and weak:</L>
<L>Now make your names immortal; now restore</L>
<L>Freedom's lost blessings to your native shore:</L>
<L>Now turn, while Fame and Victory invite,</L>
<L>While prosp'rous Fortune calls you to the fight;</L>
<L>Or yet a moment cease, O cease to fly,</L>
<L>And for our country learn of me to die!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As thus he speaks, his eager steps advance,</L>
<L>And 'gainst the Spanish Chief he points his lance;</L>
<L>To lead his kindred fugitives from flight,</L>
<L>Singly he dares to tempt th' unequal fight:</L>
<L>Against our circling arms, that round him shine,</L>
<L>Eager he darts amidst the thickest line,</L>
<L>Keen as, when chaf'd by summer's fiery beam,</L>
<L>The young Stag plunges in the cooling stream.</L>

The Poet proceeds to relate the great agility and valour displayed by Lautaro, for such is the name of this gallant and patriotic Youth: and, as Ercilla has a soul sufficiently heroic to do full justice to the virtues of an enemy, he gives him the highest praise. Having mentioned on the occasion many heroes of ancient history, he ex∣claims:
<Q><L>Say, of these famous Chiefs can one exceed</L>
<L>Or match this young Barbarian's noble deed?</L>
<L>Vict'ry for them, her purpose unexplor'd,</L>
<L>Tempted by equal chance their happy sword:</L>
<L>What risk, what peril, did they boldly meet,</L>
<L>Save where Ambition urg'd the splendid feat;</L>
<L>Or mightier Int'rest fir'd the daring mind,</L>
<L>Which makes a Hero of the fearful Hind?</L>
<L>Many there are who with a brave disdain</L>
<L>Face all the perils of the deathful plain,</L>
<L>Who, fir'd by hopes of glory, nobly dare,</L>
<L>Yet fail the stroke of adverse chance to bear;</L>
<L>With animated fire their spirit shines,</L>
<L>Till the short splendor of their day declines;</L>
<L>But all their valor, all their strength expires,</L>
<L>When fickle Fortune from their side retires.</L>
<L>This youthful Hero, when the die was cast,</L>
<L>War's dire decree against his country past,</L>
<L><PB N="109" REF="110"/>
Made the stern Power the finish'd cause resume,</L>
<L>And finally reverse the cruel doom:</L>
<L>He, by his efforts in the dread debate,</L>
<L>Forc'd the determin'd will of adverse Fate;</L>
<L>From shouting Triumph rush'd the palm to tear,</L>
<L>And fix'd it on the brow of faint Despair.</L></Q></P>
<P>Caupolican, leading his army back to the charge, in consequence of Lautaro's efforts in their favour, obtains a complete victory. The Spaniards are all slain in the field, except their Commander Valdi∣via, who flies, attended only by a priest; but he is soon taken prisoner, and conducted before the In∣dian Chief, who is inclined to spare his life; when an elder savage, called Leocato, in a sudden burst of indignation, kills him with his club.</P>
<P>All the people of Arauco assemble in a great plain to celebrate their victory: old and young, women and children, unite in the festival; and the trees that surround the scene of their assembly are decorated with the heads and spoils of their slaughtered enemies.</P>
<P>They meditate the total extermination of the Spaniards from their country, and even a descent on Spain. The General makes a prudent speech to restrain their impetuosity; and afterwards, be∣sfowing
<PB N="110" REF="111"/>
just applause on the brave exploit of the young Lautaro, appoints him his lieutenant. In the midst of the festivity, Caupolican receives ad∣vice that a party of fourteen Spanish horsemen had attacked some of his forces with great havoc. He dispatches Lautaro to oppose them.</P>

<HEAD>CANTO IV.</HEAD>
<P>APARTY of fourteen gallant Spaniards, who had set forth from the city of Imperial to join Valdivia, not being apprised of his un∣happy fate, are surprised by the enemy where they expected to meet their Commander;—they de∣fend themselves with great valor. They are in∣formed by a friendly Indian of the fate of Val∣divia. They attempt to retreat; but are sur∣rounded by numbers of the Araucanians:—when the Poet introduces the following instance of Spa∣nish heroism, which I insert as a curious stroke of their military character:
<Q><L>Here, cried a Spaniard, far unlike his race,</L>
<L>Nor shall his abject name my verse debase,</L>
<L>Marking his few associates march along,</L>
<L>O that our band were but a hundred strong!</L>
<L><PB N="111" REF="112"/>
The brave Gonsalo with disdain replied:</L>
<L>Rather let two be sever'd from our side,</L>
<L>Kind Heaven! that Memory may our feats proclaim,</L>
<L>And call our little troop The Twelve of Fame!</L></Q></P>
<P>They continue to fight with great bravery against superior numbers, when Lautaro arrives with a fresh army against them. Still undaunted, they only resolve to sell their lives as dear as pos∣sible. Seven of them are cut to pieces.—In the midst of the slaughter a furious thunder and hail storm arises, by which incident the surviving seven escape. The tempest is described with the following original simile:
<Q><L>Now in the turbid air a stormy cloud</L>
<L>Spreads its terrific shadow o'er the crowd;</L>
<L>The gathering darkness hides the solar ray,</L>
<L>And to th' affrighted earth denies the day;</L>
<L>The rushing winds, to which the forests yield,</L>
<L>Rive the tall tree, and desolate the field:</L>
<L>In drops distinct and rare now falls the rain;</L>
<L>And now with thickening fury beats the plain.</L>
<L>As the bold master of the martial drum,</L>
<L>Ere to the shock th' advancing armies come,</L>
<L>In aweful notes, that shake the heaven's high arch,</L>
<L>Intrepid strikes the slow and solemn march;</L>
<L><PB N="112" REF="113"/>
But, when the charging heroes yield their breath,</L>
<L>Doubles the horrid harmony of death:</L>
<L>So the dark tempest, with increasing sound,</L>
<L>Pours the loud deluge on the echoing ground.</L></Q></P>
<P>The few Spaniards that escape take refuge in a neighbouring fort; which they abandon the fol∣lowing day on hearing the fate of Valdivia. Lau∣taro returns, and receives new honors and new forces from his General, to march against a Spa∣nish army, which departs from the city of Penco under the command of Villagran, an experienced officer, to revenge the death of Valdivia. The de∣parture of the troops from Penco is described, and the distress of the women.—Villagran marches with expedition towards the frontiers of Arauco. He arrives at a dangerous pass, and finds Lautaro, with his army of 10,100 Indians, advantageously posted on the heights, and waiting with great stea∣diness and discipline to give him battle.</P>

<P>LAUTARO with great difficulty restrains the eager Indians in their post on the rock. He suffers a few to descend and skirmish on the lower ground, where several distinguish themselves in

single combat. The Spaniards attempt in vain to dislodge the army of Lautaro by an attack of their cavalry:—they afterwards fire on them from six pieces of cannon.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>The vext air feels the thunder of the fight,</L>

<L>Earth seems to open as the flames aspire,</L>

<L>Lautaro saw no hopes of life allow'd,</L>
<L>Save by dispersing this terrific cloud,</L>
<L>That pours its lightning with so dire a shock,</L>
<L>Smiting his lessen'd host, who strew the rock;</L>
<L>And to the troop of Leucoton the brave</L>
<L>His quick command the skilful Leader gave:</L>
<L>He bids them fiercely to the charge descend,</L>
<L>And thus exhorts aloud each ardent friend:</L>

<L>My faithful partners in bright victory's meed,</L>
<L>Whom fortune summons to this noble deed,</L>
<L>Behold the hour when your prevailing might</L>

<P>The Indians, undismayed by a dreadful slaughter, gain possession of the cannon.—Villagran makes a short but spirited harangue to his flying soldiers.

<L>Who chose that death should end his present grief,</L>
<L>And smooth the horrid path, with thornso' erspread,</L>
<L>Which Destiny condemn'd his feet to tread.</L></Q>
<P>With the preceding encomium on the spirit of this unfortunate officer the Poet opens his 6th

Canto. Thirteen of the most faithful soldiers of Villagran, perceiving their Leader fallen motion∣less under the fury of his enemies, make a despe∣rate effort to preserve him.—Being placed again on his horse by these generous deliverers, he reco∣vers from the blow which had stunned him; and by singular exertion, with the assistance of his spi∣rited little troop, effects his escape, and rejoins his main army; whom he endeavours in vain to lead back against the triumphant Araucanians. The pursuit becomes general, and the Poet describes the horrid massacre committed by the Indians on all the unhappy fugitives that fell into their hands.—The Spaniards in their flight are stopt by a nar∣row pass fortified and guarded by a party of In∣dians. Villagran forces the rude entrenchment in person, and conducts part of his army safe through the pass; but many, attempting other roads over the mountainous country, are either lost among the precipices of the rocks, or pursued and killed by the Indians.</P>

<P>The inhabitants of Concepcion, expecting every instant the triumphant Lautaro at their gates, re∣solve to abandon their city. A gallant veteran upbraids their cowardly design. They disregard his reproaches, and evacuate the place:—when the Poet introduces the following instance of fe∣male heroism:
<Q><LG>
<L>'Tis just that Fame a noble deed display,</L>
<L>Which claims remembrance, even to the day</L>
<L><PB N="117" REF="118"/>
When Memory's hand no more the pen shall use,</L>

<L>Here firmly shew'd, as this dread scene began,</L>
<L>Courage now found not in the heart of man.</L>
<L>The bed of sickness 'twas her chance to press;</L>

Lautaro arrives in the mean time before the walls they had deserted:—and the Poet concludes his canto with a spirited description of the barbaric

<P>LAUTARO is recalled from his victorious exploits, to assist at a general assembly of the Indians, in the valley of Arauco. The different Chieftains deliver their various sentiments con∣cerning the war, after their Leader Caupolican has declared his design to pursue the Spaniards with unceasing vengeance. The veteran Colocolo proposes a plan for their military operations. An ancient Augur, named Puchecalco, denounces ruin on all the projects of his countrymen, in the name of the Indian Daemon Eponamon. He recites the omens of their destruction. The fierce Tucapel, provoked to frenzy by this gloomy prophet, strikes him dead in the midst of his harangue, by a sudden blow of his mace. Caupolican orders the mur∣derous Chieftain to be led to instant death. He defends himself with success against numbers who attempt to seize him. Lautaro, pleased by this exertion of his wonderful force and valour, intreats the General to forgive what had passed; and, at
<PB N="121" REF="122"/>
his intercession, Tucapel is received into favour. Lautaro then closes the business of the assembly, by recommending the plan proposed by Colocolo, and intreating that he may himself be entrusted with a detached party of five hundred Indians, with which he engages to reduce the city of San∣tiago. His proposal is accepted. The Chieftains, having finished their debate, declare their resolu∣tions to their people; and, after their usual festi∣vity, Caupolican, with the main army, proceeds to attack the city of Imperial.</P>

<P>THE Poet opens this Canto with an apology for a miracle, which he thinks it necessary to relate, as it was attested by the whole Indian army; and, though it does not afford him any very uncommon or sublime imagery, he embellishes the wonder he describes, by his easy and spirited versification, of which the following lines are an imperfect copy:
<Q><LG>
<L>When to the city's weak defenceless wall</L>
<L>Its foes were rushing, at their trumpet's call,</L>
<L>The air grew troubled with portentous sound,</L>
<L>And mournful omens multiplied around;</L>
<L><PB N="122" REF="123"/>
With furious shock the elements engage,</L>
<L>And all the winds contend in all their rage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From clashing clouds their mingled torrents gush,</L>
<L>And rain and hail with rival fury rush.</L>
<L>Bolts of loud thunder, floods of lightning rend</L>
<L>The opening skies, and into earth descend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O'er the vast army equal terrors spread;</L>
<L>No mind escapes the universal dread;</L>
<L>No breast, tho' arm'd with adamantine power,</L>
<L>Holds its firm vigor in this horrid hour;</L>
<L>For now the fierce Eponamon appears,</L>
<L>And in a Dragon's form augments their fears;</L>
<L>Involving flames around the Daemon swell,</L>
<L>Who speaks his mandate in a hideous yell:</L>
<L>He bids his votaries with haste invest</L>
<L>The trembling city, by despair deprest.</L>
<L>Where'er th' invading squadrons force their way,</L>
<L>He promises their arms an easy prey.</L>
<L>Spare not (he cry'd) in the relentless strife,</L>
<L>One Spanish battlement, one Christian life!</L>
<L>He spoke, and, while the host his will adore,</L>
<L>Melts into vapour, and is seen no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quick as he vanish'd Nature's struggles cease;</L>
<L>The troubled elements are sooth'd to peace:</L>
<L>The winds no longer rage with boundless ire,</L>
<L>But, hush'd in silence, to their caves retire:</L>
<L>The clouds disperse, restoring as they fly</L>
<L>The unobstructed sun and azure sky:</L>
<L><PB N="123" REF="124"/>
Fear only held its place, and still possest</L>
<L>Usurp'd dominion o'er the boldest breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The tempest ceas'd, and heaven, ferenely bright,</L>
<L>Array'd the moisten'd earth in joyous light:</L>
<L>When, pois'd upon a cloud that swiftly flew,</L>
<L>A Female form descended to their view,</L>
<L>Clad in the radiance of so rich a veil,</L>
<L>As made the sun's meridian lustre pale;</L>
<L>For it outshone his golden orb as far</L>
<L>As his full blaze outshines the twinkling star.</L>
<L>Her sacred features banish all their dread,</L>
<L>And o'er the host reviving comfort shed.</L>
<L>An hoary Elder by her side appear'd,</L>
<L>For age and sanctity of life rever'd;</L>
<L>And thus she spoke, with soft persuasive grace:</L>
<L>Ah! whither rush ye, blind devoted race?</L>
<L>Turn, while you can, towards your native plain,</L>
<L>Nor 'gainst yon city point your arms in vain;</L>
<L>For God will guard his faithful Christian band,</L>
<L>And give them empire o'er your bleeding land,</L>
<L>Since, thankless, false, and obstinate in ill,</L>
<L>You scorn submission to his sacred will.</L>
<L>Yet shun those walls; th' Almighty, there ador'd,</L>

The Indians, confounded by this miraculous interposition, disperse in disorder to their several homes; and the Poet proceeds very gravely to affirm, that, having obtained the best information, from many individuals, concerning this miracle, that he might be very exact in his account of it, he finds it happened on the twenty-third of April, four years before he wrote the verses that describe it, and in the year of our Lord 1554. The Vision was followed by pestilence and famine among the Indians. They remain inactive during the winter, but assemble again the ensuing spring, in the plains of Arauco, to renew the war. They receive in∣telligence that the Spainards are attempting to rebuild the city of Concepcion, and are requested by the neighbouring tribes to march to their as∣sistance, and prevent that design. Lautaro leads a chosen band on that expedition, hoping to surprize the fort the Spaniards had erected on the ruins of their city; but the Spanish commander, Alvarado, being apprized of their motion, sallies forth to meet the Indian party: a skirmish ensues; the Spaniards retire to their fort; Lautaro attempts to storm it; a most bloody encounter ensues; Tu∣capel signalizes himself in the attack; the Indians persevere with the most obstinate valour, and, after a long conflict (described with a considerable
<PB N="125" REF="126"/>
portion of Homeric spirit) gain possession of the fort; Alvarado and a few of his followers escape; they are pursued, and much galled in their flight: a single Indian, named Rengo, harrasses Alvarado and two of his attendants; the Spanish officer, provoked by the insult, turns with his two com∣panions to punish their pursuer; but the wily In∣dian secures himself on some rocky heights, and annoys them with his sling, till, despairing of re∣venge, they continue their flight.</P>

<P>THE Indians celebrate their victory with public games; and prizes are appointed for such as excel in their various martial exercises. Leucoton is declared victor in the contest of throwing the lance, and receives a scimitar as his reward. Rengo subdues his two rivals, Cayeguan and Talco, in the exercise of wrestling, and proceeds to contend with Leucoton. After a long and severe struggle, Rengo has the misfortune to fall by an accidental failure of the ground, but, springing lightly up, en∣gages his adversary with increasing fury; and the canto ends without deciding the contest.</P>

<P>LAUTARO separates the two enraged an∣tagonists, to prevent the ill effects of their wrath. The youth Orompello, whom Leucoton had before surpassed in the contest of the lance, challenges his successful rival to wrestle: they en∣gage, and fall together: the victory is disputed. Tucapel demands the prize for his young friend Orompello, and insults the General Caupolican. The latter is restrained from avenging the insult, by the sage advice of the veteran Colocolo, at whose request he distributes prizes of equal value to each of the claimants. To prevent farther ani∣mosities, they relinquish the rest of the appointed games, and enter into debate on the war. Lau∣taro is again appointed to the command of a chosen troop, and marches towards the city of St. Jago. The Spaniards, alarmed at the report of his ap∣proach, send out some forces to reconnoitre his party: a skirmish ensues: they are driven back to the city, and relate that Lautaro is fortifying a strong post at some distance, intending soon to attack the city. Villagran, the Spaniard who commanded there, being confined by illness, ap∣points an officer of his own name to sally forth, with all the forces he can raise, in quest of the
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
enemy. The Spaniards fix their camp, on the ap∣proach of night, near the fort of Lautaro: they are suddenly alarmed, and summoned to arms; but the alarm is occasioned only by a single horse without a rider, which Lautaro, aware of their approach, had turned loose towards their camp, as an insult∣ing mode of proclaiming his late victory, in which he had taken ten of the Spanish horses.</P>
<P>The Spaniards pass the night under arms, resolv∣ing to attack the Indians at break of day. Lau∣taro had issued orders that no Indian should sally from the fort under pain of death, to prevent the advantage which the Spanish cavalry must have over his small forces in the open plain. He also commanded his soldiers to retreat with an appear∣ance of dismay, at the first attack on the fort, and suffer a considerable number of the enemy to en∣ter the place. This stratagem succeeds: the Spa∣niards rush forward with great fury: the Indians give ground, but, soon turning with redoubled vi∣olence on those who had passed their lines, destroy many, and oblige the rest to save themselves by a precipitate flight. The Indians, forgetting the orders of their Leader, in the ardour of vengeance sally forth in pursuit of their flying enemy. Lau∣taro recalls them by the sound of a military horn, which he blows with the utmost violence. They
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
return, but dare not appear in the presence of their offended Commander. He issues new restric∣tions; and then, summoning his soldiers toge∣ther, addresses them, in a spirited, yet calm and af∣fectionate harangue, on the necessity of martial obedience. While he is yet speaking, the Spa∣niards return to the attack, but are again repulsed with great loss. They retreat, and encamp at the foot of a mountain, unmolested by any pursuers.</P>

<P>THE Spaniards remain in their camp, while two of their adventurous soldiers engage to return once more to the fort, and examine the state of it. On their approach, one of them, called Marcos Vaez, is saluted by his name, and promised security, by a voice from within the walls. Lau∣taro had formerly lived with him on terms of friend∣ship, and now invites him into the fort. The Indian Chief harangues on the resolution and the power of his countrymen to exterminate the Spaniards, un∣less they submit. He proposes, however, terms of accommodation to his old friend Marcos, and spe∣cifies the tribute he should expect. The Spaniard answers with disdain, that the only tribute the In∣dians would receive from his countrymen would be
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>
torture and death. Lautaro replies, with great tem∣per, that arms, and the valor of the respective na∣tions, must determine this point; and proceeds to entertain his guest with a display of six Indians, whom he had mounted and trained to exercise on Spanish horses. The Spaniard challenges the whole party: Lautaro will not allow him to engage in any conflict, but dismisses him in peace. He re∣calls him, before he had proceeded far from the fort, and, telling him that his soldiers were much distressed by the want of provision, entreats him to send a supply, affirming it to be true heroism to relieve an enemy from the necessities of famine. The Spaniard subscribes to the sentiment, and en∣gages, if possible, to comply with the request. Returning to his camp, he acquaints his Com∣mander Villagran with all that had passed; who, suspecting some dangerous design from Lautaro, decamps hastily in the night to regain the city. The Indian Chief is severely mortified by their de∣parture, as he had formed a project for cutting off their retreat, by letting large currents of water into the marshy ground on which the Spaniards were encamped. Despairing of being able to succeed against their city, now prepared to resist him, he returns towards Arauco, most sorely galled by his disappointment, and thus venting his anguish:
<Q><PB N="130" REF="131"/><LG>
<L>What can redeem Lautaro's wounded name?</L>
<L>What plea preserve his failing arms from shame?</L>
<L>Did not my ardent soul this task demand,</L>
<L>Which now upbraids my unperforming hand?</L>
<L>On me, on me alone can censure fall;</L>
<L>Myself th' adviser and the guide of all.</L>
<L>Am I the Chief who, in Fame's bright career,</L>
<L>Ask'd to subdue the globe a single year?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While, at the head of this my glittering train,</L>
<L>I weakly threaten Spanish walls in vain,</L>
<L>Thrice has pale Cynthia, with replenish'd ray,</L>
<L>Seen my ill-order'd troop in loose array;</L>
<L>And the rich chariot of the blazing sun</L>
<L>Has from the Scorpion to Aquarious run.</L>
<L>At last, as fugitives these paths we tread,</L>
<L>And mourn twice fifty brave companions dead.</L>
<L>Could Fate's kind hand this hateful stain efface,</L>
<L>Could death redeem me from this worse disgrace,</L>
<L>My useless spear should pierce this abject heart,</L>
<L>Which has so ill sustain'd a soldier's part.</L>
<L>Unworthy thought! the mean, ignoble blow</L>
<L>Would only tempt my proud and vaunting foe</L>
<L>To boast that I preferr'd, in fear's alarm,</L>
<L>My own weak weapon to his stronger arm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By Hell I swear, who rules the sanguine strife,</L>
<L>If Chance allow me yet a year of life,</L>

<L>No changing season, neither cold nor heat,</L>

<L>Nor shall the earth, nor hell's expanding cave,</L>
<L>From this avenging arm one Spaniard save.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now the brave Chief, with solemn ardor, swore</L>
<L>To his dear native home to turn no more;</L>
<L>From no fierce sun, no stormy winds to fly,</L>
<L>But patiently abide the varying sky,</L>
<L>And spurn all thoughts of pleasure and of ease,</L>
<L>Till rescu'd fame his tortur'd soul appease;</L>
<L>Till earth confess the brave Lautaro's hand</L>
<L>Has clos'd the glorious work his spirit plann'd.</L>
<L>In these resolves the Hero found relief,</L>
<L>And thus relax'd the o'erstrain'd cord of grief;</L>
<L>Whose pressure gall'd him with such mental pain,</L>
<L>That frenzy almost seiz'd his burning brain.</L>

<P>Lautaro continues his march into an Indian district, from which he collects a small increase of force; and, after addressing his soldiers concerning the expediency of strict military discipline, and the cause of their late ill success, he turns again towards the city of St. Jago; but, receiving intelligence on his road of its preparations for defence, he again suspends his design, and fortifies a post, which he
<PB N="132" REF="133"/>
chuses with the hope of collecting still greater numbers to assist him in his projected enterprize. The Spaniards at St. Jago are eager to sally in quest of Lautaro, but their Commander Villagran was absent on an expedition to the city of Imperial. In returning from thence he passes near the post of Lautaro. An Indian ally acquaints him with its situation, and, at the earnest request of the Spanish officer, agrees to conduct him, by a short though difficult road, over a mountain, to attack the fort by surprize. The Poet suspends his narration of this interesting event, to relate the arrival of new forces from Spain in America; and he now begins to appear himself on the field of action. <Q REND="inline">"Hither∣to,"</Q> says he, <Q REND="inline">"I have described the scenes in which I was not present; yet I have collected my information from no partial witnesses, and I have recorded only those events in which both parties agree. Since it is known that I have shed so much blood in support of what I affirm, my future narra∣tion will be more authentic; for I now speak as an ocular witness of every action, unblinded by parti∣ality, which I disdain, and resolved to rob no one of the praise which he deserves."</Q></P>
<P>After pleading his youth as an apology for the defects of his style, and after declaring that his only motive for writing was the ardent desire to preserve
<PB N="133" REF="134"/>
so many valiant actions from perishing in oblivion, the Poet proceeds to relate the arrival of the Mar∣quis de Canete as Viceroy in Peru, and the spirited manner in which he corrected the abuses of that country. The canto concludes with reflections on the advantages of loyalty, and the miseries of re∣bellion.</P>

<P>SPANISH deputies from the province of Chile implore assistance from the new Viceroy of Pe∣ru: he sends them a considerable succour, under the conduct of Don Garcia, his son. The Poet is him∣self of this band, and relates the splendid prepara∣tions for the enterprize, and the embarkation of the troops in ten vessels, which sail from Lima towards the coast of Chile. Having described part of this voyage, he returns to the bold exploit of Villagran, and the adventures of Lautaro, the most interesting of all the Araucanian Heroes, whom he left secu∣ring himself in his sequestered fort.</P>

<L>But soon he starts, alarm'd, and gasps for breath,</L>
<L>The fair Guacolda, with a trembling tongue,</L>
<L>Anxious enquires from whence his anguish sprung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My lovely Fair! the brave Lautaro cries,</L>
<L>An hideous vision struck my scornful eyes:</L>
<L>Methought that instant a fierce Chief of Spain</L>
<L>Mock'd my vain spear with insolent disdain;</L>
<L>His forceful arm my failing powers o'ercame,</L>
<L>And strength and motion seem'd to quit my frame.</L>
<L>But still the vigor of my soul I keep,</L>
<L>And its keen anger burst the bonds of sleep.</L>

<L>With quick despir, the troubled Fair one said,</L>
<L>Alas! thy dreams confirm the ills I dread.</L>
<L>'Tis come—the object of my boding fears!</L>
<L>Thy end, the source of my unceasing tears.</L>
<L>Yet not so wretched is this mournful hour,</L>

But that kind death may shorten all my woes,</L>
<L>And give the agonizing scene to close.</L>
<L>Let my stern fate its cruel rage employ,</L>

<L>Whatever pangs its malice may devise,</L>
<L>It cannot rend affection's stronger ties.</L>
<L>Tho' horrible the blow my fears foresee,</L>
<L>A second blow will set my spirit free;</L>
<L>For cold on earth thy frame shall ne'er be found,</L>
<L>While mine with useless being loads the ground.</L>

<L>The Chief, transported with her tender charms,</L>
<L>Closely around her neck entwin'd his arms;</L>
<L>And, while fond tears her snowy breast bedew'd,</L>
<L>Thus with redoubled love his speech pursu'd:</L>

<L>My generous Fair, thy gloomy thoughts dismiss;</L>
<L>Nor let dark omens interrupt our bliss,</L>
<L>And cloud these moments that with transport shine,</L>
<L>While my exulting heart thus feels thee mine.</L>
<L>Thy troubled fancy prompts my mutual sigh;</L>
<L>Not that I think the hour of danger nigh:</L>
<L>But Love so melts me with his soft controul,</L>
<L>Impossibilities alarm my soul.</L>
<L>If thy kind wishes bid Lautaro live,</L>

<L>If the pure love, which, prodigal and free,</L>

<L>If truth, which Heaven will witness and defend,</L>

<L>By these let me adjure thee; by the pain</L>

And all the vows, if undispers'd in air,</L>

<L>Canst thou so poorly of Lautaro deem?</L>

<HEAD>CANTO XV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Poet opens this canto with a lively pane∣gyric on Love: he affirms that the greatest Poets have derived their glory from their vivid de∣scriptions of this enchanting passion; and he la∣ments that he is precluded by his subject from in∣dulging his imagination in such scenes as are more likely to captivate a reader.</P>
<P>He seems to intend this as an apology (but I
<PB N="144" REF="145"/>
must own it is an unsatisfactory one) for deserting the fair Guacolda, whom he mentions no more. He proceeds to describe the sharp contest which the undaunted Indians still maintained in their fort:—they refuse quarter, which is offered them by the Spanish Leader, and all resolutely perish with the brave and beloved Lautaro. The Poet then resumes his account of the naval expedition from Peru to Chile; and concludes the canto with a spirited description of a storm, which attacked the vessels as they arrived in sight of the province to which they were steering.</P>
</DIV6>
<DIV6 N="16" TYPE="canto">
<HEAD>CANTO XVI.</HEAD>
<P>THE storm abates. The Spaniards land, and fortify themselves on an island near the coun∣try of the Araucanians. The latter hold a council of war in the valley of Ongolmo. Caupolican, their General, proposes to attack the Spaniards in their new post. The elder Chieftains dissuade him from the design. A quarrel ensues between Tucapel and the aged Peteguelen:—they are appeased by a speech of the venerable Colocolo; by whose advice a spirited and adroit young Indian, named Milla∣lanco, is dispatched, as a peaceful ambassador, to learn the situation and designs of the Spaniards.
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
He embarks in a large galley with oars, and soon arrives at the island. He surveys the Spanish implements of war with astonishment, and is conducted to the tent of the General, Don Garcia.</P>
</DIV6>
<DIV6 N="17" TYPE="canto">
<HEAD>CANTO XVII.</HEAD>
<P>THE Indian addresses the Spanish officers with a proposal of peace and amity. He is dismissed with presents. The Chieftains, on his return, pre∣tend to relinquish hostilities; but prepare secretly for war. The Spaniards remain unmolested on the island during the stormy season. They send a select party of an hundred and thirty, including our Poet, to raise a fort on the continent: these exe∣cute their commission with infinite dispatch, and all the Spanish troops remove to this new post. The Araucanians are alarmed. An intrepid Youth, named Gracolano, proposes to the Indian General, Caupolican, to storm the fort. The Indians ad∣vance near it, under shelter of the night. The Poet describes himself, at this juncture, as op∣pressed by the excessive labours of the day, and unable to pursue his poetical studies according to his nightly custom: the pen falls from his hand: he is seized with violent pains and tremblings:
<PB N="146" REF="147"/>
his strength and senses forsake him. But soon reco∣vering from this infirmity, he enjoys a refreshing sleep. Bellona appears to him in a vision, and en∣courages him both as a soldier and a poet. She conducts him, through a delicious country, to the summit of a most lofty mountain; when, pointing to a spot below, she informs him it is St. Quintin, and that his countrymen, under the command of their sovereign Philip, are just marching to attack it: she adds, that her presence is necessary in the midst of that important scene; and leaves the Poet on the eminence to survey and record the battle.</P>
</DIV6>
<DIV6 N="18" TYPE="canto">
<HEAD>CANTO XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the Poet has described the success of his royal master at St. Quintin, a female figure of a most venerable appearance, but without a name, relates to him prophetically many future events of great importance to his country. She touches on the disturbances in the Netherlands, the enterprizes of the Turks, and the exploits of Don John of Austria, at that time unknown to fame. These she hints very imperfectly, telling the Poet, that if he wishes for farther information, he must follow the steps of a tame deer, which he will find in a particular spot; this animal will lead
<PB N="147" REF="148"/>
him to the cell of an ancient hermit, formerly a soldier, who will conduct him to the secret cave of the unsocial Fiton, a mighty magician, who will display to him the most miraculous visions. His female Instructor then advises him to mix softer subjects with the horrors of war, and to turn his eyes and his thoughts to the charms of the many Beauties who then flourished in Spain. He beholds all these lovely fair ones assembled in a delicious paradise; and he is particularly attracted by a young lady, whose name he discovers to be Donna Maria Bazan (his future wife): in the moment that he begins to question his Guide concerning this engaging Beauty, he is roused from his vision by the sound of an alarm. He snatches up his arms, and hurries to his post:—while the morning dawns, and the Indians begin to attack the fort.</P>
</DIV6>
<DIV6 N="19" TYPE="canto">
<HEAD>CANTO XIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE Indians advance in three squadrons. The Youth Gracolano o'erleaps the trench, sup∣ported on a lofty pike, by which he also passes the wall. He defends himself in the midst of the Spa∣niards with great spirit; but, finding himself un∣supported, he wrenches a lance from a Spanish sol∣dier, and tries to leap once more over the trench;
<PB N="148" REF="149"/>
but he is struck by a stone while vaulting through the air, and falls, covered, as the Poet expressly de∣clares, with two-and-thirty wounds. Some of his friends are shot near him; but the Indians get possession of the Spanish lance with which he had sprung over the wall, and brandish it in triumph. The Spaniard, named Elvira, who had lost his weapon, piqued by the adventure, sallies from the fort, and returns, amid the shouts of his country∣men, with an Indian spear which he won in single combat from a Barbarian, whom he had per∣ceived detached from his party. The Indians at∣tempt to storm the fort on every side: many are destroyed by the Spanish fire-arms. The head of the ancient Peteguelen is shot off; but Tucapel passes the wall, and rushes with great slaughter into the midst of the enemy. The Spaniards who were in the ships that anchored near the coast hasten on shore, and march to assist their coun∣trymen in the fort, but are attacked by a party of Indians in their march. The conflict continues furious on the walls; but the Indians at length retreat, leaving Tucapel still sighting within the fort.</P>
</DIV6>
<DIV6 N="20" TYPE="canto">
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>
<HEAD>CANTO XX.</HEAD>
<P>TUCAPEL, though severely wounded, escapes with life, and rejoins the Indian army, which continues to retreat. The Spaniards sally from the fort, but soon return to it, from the apprehension of an ambuscade. They clear their trench, and strengthen the weaker parts of their fortification. Night comes on. The Poet describes himself sta∣tioned on a little eminence in the plain below the fort, which was seated on high and rocky ground:—fatigued with the toils of the day, and oppressed by the weight of his armour, which he continues to wear, he is troubled with a lethargic heaviness; which he counteracts by exercise, declaring that his disposition to slumber in his post arose not from any intemperance either in diet or in wine, as mouldy biscuit and rain-water had been for some time his chief sustenance; and that he was accus∣tomed to make the moist earth his bed, and to di∣vide his time between his poetical and his military labours. He then relates the following nocturnal adventure, which may perhaps be considered as the most striking and pathetic incident in this sin∣gular poem:

<Q><PB N="150" REF="151"/><LG>
<L>While thus I strove my nightly watch to keep,</L>
<L>And struggled with th' oppressive weight of sleep,</L>
<L>As my quick feet, with many a silent stride,</L>
<L>Travers'd th' allotted ground from side to side,</L>
<L>My eye perceiv'd one quarter of the plain</L>
<L>White with the mingled bodies of the slain;</L>
<L>For our incessant fire, that bloody day,</L>
<L>Had slaughter'd numbers in the stubborn fray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As oft I paus'd each distant noise to hear,</L>
<L>Gazing around me with attentive ear,</L>
<L>I heard from time to time a feeble sound</L>
<L>Towards the breathless Indians on the ground,</L>
<L>Still closing with a sigh of mournful length;</L>
<L>At every interval it gather'd strength;</L>
<L>And now it ceas'd, and now again begun,</L>
<L>And still from corse to corse it seem'd to run.</L>
<L>As night's encreasing shade my hope destroys,</L>
<L>To view the source of this uncertain noise,</L>
<L>Eager my mind's unquiet doubts to still,</L>
<L>And more the duties of my post fulfil;</L>
<L>With crouching steps I haste, and earnest eyes,</L>
<L>To the low spot from whence the murmurs rise;</L>
<L>And see a dusky Form, that seems to tread</L>
<L>Slow, on four feet, among the gory dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With terror, that my heart will not deny,</L>
<L>When this strange vision struck my doubtful eye,</L>
<L><PB N="151" REF="152"/>
Towards it, with a prayer to Heav'n, I prest,</L>
<L>Arms in my hand, my corselet on my breast;</L>
<L>But now the dusky Form, on which I sprung,</L>
<L>Upright arose, and spoke with plaintive tongue:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mercy! to mercy hear my just pretence;</L>
<L>I am a woman, guiltless of offence!</L>
<L>If my distress, and unexampled plight,</L>
<L>No generous pity in thy breast excite;</L>
<L>If thy blood-thirsty rage, by tears uncheck'd,</L>
<L>Would pass those limits which the brave respect;</L>
<L>Will such a deed encrease thy martial fame,</L>
<L>When Heaven's just voice shall to the world pro∣claim</L>
<L>That by thy ruthless sword a woman died,</L>
<L>A widow, sunk in sorrow's deepest tide?</L>
<L>Yet I implore thee, if 'twas haply thine,</L>
<L>Or for thy curse, as now I feel it mine;</L>
<L>If e'er thy lot, in any state, to prove</L>
<L>How firm the faithful ties of tender love,</L>
<L>O let me bury one brave warrior slain,</L>
<L>Whose corse lies blended with this breathless train!</L>
<L>Remember, he who thwarts the duteous will</L>
<L>Becomes th' approver and the cause of ill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou wilt not hinder these my pious vows;</L>
<L>War, fiercest war, this just demand allows:</L>
<L>The basest tyranny alone is driven</L>
<L>To use the utmost power that chance has given.</L>
<L><PB N="152" REF="153"/>
Let but my soul its dear companion find,</L>
<L>Then sate thy fury, if to blood inclin'd;</L>
<L>For in such grief I draw my lingering breath,</L>
<L>Life is my dread, beyond the pangs of death.</L>
<L>There is no ill that now can wound my breast,</L>
<L>No good, but what I in my Love possest:</L>
<L>Fly then, ye hours! that keep me from the dead;</L>
<L>For he, the spirit of my life, is fled.</L>
<L>If adverse Heaven my latest wish deny,</L>
<L>On his dear corse to fix my closing eye,</L>
<L>My tortur'd soul, in cruel Fate's despight,</L>
<L>Will soar, the faithful partner of his flight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now her agony of heart implor'd</L>
<L>An end of all her sorrows from my sword.</L>
<L>Doubt and distrust my troubled mind assail,</L>
<L>That fears deceit in her affecting tale;</L>
<L>Nor was I fully of her faith secure,</L>
<L>Till oft her words the mournful truth insure;</L>
<L>Suspicion whisper'd, that an artful spy</L>
<L>By this illusion might our state descry.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Howe'er inclin'd to doubt, yet soon I knew,</L>
<L>Though night conceal'd her features from my view,</L>
<L>That truth was stamp'd on every word she said;</L>
<L>So full of grief, so free from guilty dread:</L>
<L>And that bold love, to every danger blind,</L>
<L>Had sent her forth her slaughter'd Lord to find,</L>
<L><PB N="153" REF="154"/>
Who, in the onset of our bloody strife,</L>
<L>For brave distinction sacrific'd his life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fill'd with compassion, when I saw her bent</L>
<L>To execute her chaste and fond intent,</L>
<L>I led her weeping to the higher spot,</L>
<L>To guard whose precincts was that night my lot;</L>
<L>Securely there I begg'd her to relate</L>
<L>The perfect story of her various fate;</L>
<L>From first to last her touching woes impart,</L>
<L>And by the tale relieve her loaded heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! she replied, relief I ne'er can know,</L>
<L>Till Death's kind aid shall terminate my woe!</L>
<L>Earth for my ills no remedy supplies,</L>
<L>Beyond all suff'rance my afflictions rise:</L>
<L>Yet, though the task will agonize my soul,</L>
<L>Of my sad story I will tell the whole;</L>
<L>Grief, thus inforc'd, my life's weak thread may rend,</L>
<L>And in the killing tale my pangs may end.</L>

<P>The fair Indian then relates to Ercilla the par∣ticulars of her life, in a speech of considerable length:—she informs him, that her name is Te∣gualda;—that she is the daughter of the Chieftain Brancol;—that her father had often pressed her to marry, which she had for some time declined, though solicited by many of the noblest Youths in
<PB N="154" REF="155"/>
her country; till, being appointed, in compliment to her beauty, to distribute the prizes, in a scene of public festivity, to those who excelled in the manly exercises, she was struck by the accom∣plishments of a gallant Youth, named Crepino, as she bestowed on him the reward of his victories;—that she declared her choice to her father, after perceiving the Youth inspired with a mutual af∣fection for her;—that the old Chieftain was de∣lighted by her chusing so noble a character, and their marriage had been publicly solemnized but a month from that day. On this conclusion of her story, she bursts into new agonies of grief, and en∣treats Ercilla to let her pay her last duties to her husband; or rather, to unite them again in a com∣mon grave. Ercilla endeavours to console her, by repeated promises of all the assistance in his power. In the most passionate excess of sorrow, she still entreats him to end her miserable life.—In this dis∣tressing scene, our Author is relieved by the arrival of a brother officer, who had been also stationed on the plain, and now informs Ercilla that the time of their appointed watch is expired. They join in comforting the unhappy Mourner, and conduct her into the fort; where they consign her, for the remainder of the night, to <HI>the decent care of</HI>

<HI>married women,</HI> to use the chaste expression of the generous and compassionate Ercilla.</P>

<L>O that just Fame my humble voice would raise</L>

<L>To spread her merits, in immortal rhyme,</L>

<L>With pitying females she the night remain'd,</L>

<L>With blended doubt and sorrow, weeping still,</L>
<L>My promis'd word she pray'd me to fulfil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Assembling now a menial Indian train,</L>
<L>I led her to explore the bloody plain:</L>
<L>Where heaps of mingled dead deform'd the ground,</L>
<L>Near to the fort the breathless Chief we found;</L>
<L>Clay-cold and stiff, the gory earth he prest,</L>
<L>A fatal ball had pass'd his manly breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wretched Tegualda, who before her view'd</L>
<L>The pale disfigur'd form, in blood imbru'd,</L>
<L>Sprung forward, and with instantaneous force</L>
<L>Frantic she darted on the precious corse,</L>
<L>And press'd his lips, where livid death appears,</L>
<L>And bath'd his wounded bosom in her tears,</L>
<L>And kiss'd the wound, and the wild hope pursues</L>
<L>That her fond breath may yet new life infuse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wretch that I am! at length she madly cried,</L>
<L>Why does my soul these agonies abide?</L>
<L>Why do I linger in this mortal strife,</L>
<L>Nor pay to Love his just demand, my life?</L>
<L>Why, poor of spirit! at a single blow</L>

Whence this delay? will Heaven to me deny</L>

<L>Her furious hands her snowy neck inclasp'd;</L>
<L>Failing her frantic wish, they do not spare</L>
<L>Her mournful visage nor her flowing hair.</L>
<L>Much as I strove to stop her mad intent,</L>

<L>So loath'd she life, and with such fierce controul</L>
<L>The raging thirst of death inflam'd her soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When by my prayers, and soft persuasion's balm,</L>
<L>Her pangs of sorrow grew a little calm,</L>
<L>And her mild speech confirm'd my hope, at last,</L>
<L>That her delirious agony was past,</L>
<L>My ready Indian train, with duteous haste,</L>
<L>On a firm bier the clay-cold body plac'd,</L>
<L>And bore the Warrior, in whose fate we griev'd,</L>
<L>To where her vassals the dear charge receiv'd.</L>
<L>But, lest from ruthless War's outrageous sway</L>
<L>The mourning Fair might suffer on her way,</L>
<L>O'er the near mountains, to a safer land,</L>
<L>I march'd to guard her with my warlike band;</L>
<L>And there secure, for the remaining road</L>

As I have been tempted to dwell much longer than I intended on some of the most pathetic inci∣dents of this extraordinary poem, I shall give a more concise summary of the remaining cantos.—On Ercilla's return, the Spaniards continue to strengthen their fort. They receive intelligence from an Indian ally, that the Barbarian army intend a fresh assault in the night. They are relieved from this alarm by the arrival of a large reinforcement from the Spanish cities in Chile:—on which event Colocolo prevails on the Indians to suspend the attack. Caupolican, the Indian General, reviews all his forces; and the various Chieftains are well described. The Spanish Commander, Don Garcia, being now determined to march into the hostile district of Arauco, addresses his soldiers in a spi∣rited harangue, requesting them to remember the pious cause for which they fight, and to spare the life of every Indian who is disposed to submission. They remove from their post, and pass in boats over the broad river Biobio.</P>
</DIV6>
<DIV6 N="22" TYPE="canto">
<HEAD>CANTO XXII.</HEAD>
<P>THE Spaniards are attacked in their new quar∣ters—a furious battle ensues. The Spaniards are forced to give ground, but at last prevail. The
<PB N="159" REF="160"/>
Indian Chief, Rengo, signalizes himself in the action; defends himself in a marsh, and retreats in good order with his forces. The Spaniards, after the conflict, seize an unhappy straggling Youth, named Galvarino, whom they punish as a rebel in the most barbarous manner, by cutting off both his hands. The valiant Youth defies their cruelty in the midst of this horrid scene; and, brandishing his bloody stumps, departs from his oppressors with the most insulting menaces of re∣venge.</P>
</DIV6>
<DIV6 N="23" TYPE="canto">
<HEAD>CANTO XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>GALVARINO appears in the Assembly of the Indian Chieftains, and excites them, in a very animated speech, to revenge the barbarity with which he had been treated. He faints from loss of blood, in the close of his harangue, but is recovered by the care of his friends, and restored to health. The Indians, exasperated by the sight of his wounds, unanimously determine to prosecute the war. The Spaniards, advancing in Arauco, send forth scouts to discover the disposition of the neighbouring tribes. Ercilla, engaging in this service, perceives an old Indian in a sequestered spot, apparently sinking under the infirmities of
<PB N="160" REF="161"/>
age; but, on his approach, the ancient figure flies from him with astonishing rapidity. He endea∣vours in vain, though on horseback, to overtake this aged fugitive, who soon escapes from his sight. He now discovers the tame Deer foretold in his vision; and, pursuing it, is conducted through in∣tricate paths to a retired cottage, where a courte∣ous old man receives him in a friendly manner. Ercilla enquires after the magician Fiton: the old man undertakes to guide him to the secret mansion of that wonderful Necromancer, to whom he declares himself related. He adds, that he him∣self was once a distinguished warrior; but, having the misfortune to sully his past glory, without losing his life, in a conflict with another Chieftain, he had withdrawn himself from society, and lived twenty years as a hermit. He now leads Ercilla through a gloomy grove to the cell of the Magi∣cian, whose residence and magical apparatus are described with great force of imagination. Fiton appears from a secret portal, and proves to be the aged figure who had escaped so swiftly from the sight of Ercilla. At the request of his relation, the old Warrior, he condescends to shew Ercilla the wonders of his art. He leads him to a large lucid globe, self-suspended in the middle of an immense apartment. He tells him it is the work of forty
<PB N="161" REF="162"/>
years study, and contains an exact representation of the world, with this singular power, that it exhi∣bits, at his command, any scene of futurity which he wishes to behold:—that, knowing the heroic composition of Ercilla, he will give him an oppor∣tunity to vary and embellish his poem by the de∣scription of a most important sea-fight, which he will display to him most distinctly on that sphere. He then invokes all the powers of the infernal world. Ercilla fixes his eye on the globe, and perceives the naval forces of Spain, with those of the Pope and the Venetians, prepared to engage the great armament of the Turks.</P>

Ercilla gazes with great delight on this glorious action, and beholds the complete triumph of his countrymen; when the Magician strikes the globe with his wand, and turns the scene into darkness. Ercilla, after being entertained with other marvellous sights, which he omits from his dread of prolixity, takes leave of his two aged friends, and regains his quarters. The
<PB N="162" REF="163"/>
Spaniards continue to advance: on their pitching their camp in a new spot, towards evening, an Araucanian, fantastically drest in armour, enquires for the tent of Don Garcia, and is conducted to his presence.</P>
</DIV6>
<DIV6 N="25" TYPE="canto">
<HEAD>CANTO XXV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Araucanian delivers a defiance to Don Garcia, in the name of Caupolican, who challenges the Spanish General to end the war by a single combat. The messenger adds, that the whole Indian army will descend into the plain, on the next morning, to be spectators of the duel. Don Garcia dismisses him with an acceptance of the challenge. At the dawn of day the Indian forces appear in three divisions. A party of Spa∣nish horse precipitately attack their left wing, be∣fore which Caupolican was advancing. They are repulsed. A general and obstinate engagement ensues. The mangled Galvarino appears at the head of one Indian squadron, and excites his coun∣trymen to revenge his wrongs. Many Spaniards are named who distinguish themselves in the battle. Among the Indian Chiefs Tucapel and Rengo display the most splendid acts of valour; and,
<PB N="163" REF="164"/>
though personal enemies, they mutually defend each other. Caupolican also, at the head of the left squadron, obliges the Spaniards to retreat; and the Araucanians are on the point of gaining a deci∣sive victory, when the fortune of the day begins to turn.</P>
</DIV6>
<DIV6 N="26" TYPE="canto">
<HEAD>CANTO XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>THE reserved guard of the Spaniards, in which Ercilla was stationed, advancing to the charge, recover the field, and oblige the main body of the Indians to fly. Caupolican, though victorious in his quarter, sounds a retreat when he perceives this event. The Indians fly in great disorder. Ren∣go for some time sustains an unequal conflict, and at last retreats sullenly into a wood, where he collects several of the scattered fugitives. As Ercilla hap∣pened to advance towards this spot, a Spaniard, called Remon, exhorts him by name to attempt the dangerous but important exploit of forcing this In∣dian party from the wood. His honour being thus piqued, he rushes forward with a few followers, and, after an obstinate engagement, in which many of the Indians are cut to pieces, the Spani∣ards obtain the victory, and return to their camp with several prisoners. After this great defeat of
<PB N="164" REF="165"/>
the Indian army, the Spaniards, to deter their enemies from all future resistance, barbarously re∣solve to execute twelve Chieftains of distinction, whom they find among their captives, and to leave their bodies exposed on the trees that surrounded the field of battle. The generous Ercilla, lament∣ing this inhuman sentence, intercedes particularly for the life of one, alledging that he had seen him united with the Spaniards. This person proves to be Galvarino; who, on hearing the intercession for his life, produces his mangled arms, which he had concealed in his bosom, and, giving vent to his de∣testation of the Spaniards, insists on dying with his countrymen. Ercilla persists in vain in his endea∣vour to save him. As no executioner could be found among the Spanish soldiers, a new mode of destruction, says our Poet, was invented; and every Indian was ordered to terminate his own life by a cord which was given him. These brave men hastened to accomplish their fate with as much alacrity, continues Ercilla, as the most spirited warrior marches to an attack. One alone of the twelve begins to hesitate, and pray for mercy; declaring himself the lineal descendant of the most ancient race and sovereign of the country. He is interrupted by the reproaches of the impetuous Galvarino, and, repenting his timidity, atones for it by instant death.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="166"/>
The Spaniards advance still farther in the coun∣try, and raise a fort where Valdivia had perished. Ercilla finds his old friend the Magician once more, who tells him that Heaven thought proper to punish the pride of the Araucanians by their late defeat; but that the Spaniards would soon pay dearly for their present triumph. The Wizard retires after this prophecy, and, with much intrea∣ty, allows Ercilla to follow him. Coming to a gloomy rock, he strikes it with his wand; a secret door opens, and they enter into a delicious garden, which the Poet commends for its symmetry, ex∣pressly declaring that every hedge <HI>has its brother.</HI> The Magician leads him into a vault of alabaster; and, perceiving his wish, though he does not ex∣press it, of seeing the miraculous globe again, the courteous Fiton conducts him to it.</P>

<P>THE Magician displays to our Poet the various countries of the globe; particularly pointing out to him the ancient castle of Ercilla, the seat of his ancestors in Biscay, and the spot where his so∣vereign Philip the Second was soon to build his magnificent palace, the Escurial. Having shewn

The Spaniards in vain attempt to sooth and to terify the Arauca∣nians into peace; and, finding the importance of their present post, they determine to strengthen it. Ercilla proceeds with a party to the city of Impe∣rial, to provide necessaries for this purpose. On his return, as he is marching through the country of some pacific Indians, he discovers, at the close of day, a distrest female, who attempts to fly, but is overtaken by Ercilla.</P>

<P>THE fair fugitive, whom our Poet describes as singularly beautiful, relates her story. She tells him her name is Glaura, the daughter of an opu∣lent Chieftain, with whom she lived most happily, till a brother of her father's, who frequently resided with him, persecuted her with an unwarrantable passion;—that she in vain represented to him the impious nature of his love;—he persisted in his frantic attachment, and, on the appearance of a hostile party of Spaniards, rushed forth to die in her
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>
defence, intreating her to receive his departing spirit. He fell in the action; her father shared the same fate: she herself escaped at a postern gate into the woods. Two negroes, laden with spoil, disco∣vered, and seized her. Her cries brought a young Indian, named Cariolano, to her rescue: he shot an arrow into the heart of the first ruffian, and stabbed the second. Glaura expressed her gratitude by receiving her young deliverer as her husband. Before they could regain a place of safety, they were alarmed by the approach of Spaniards. The generous Youth intreated Glaura to conceal her∣self in a tree, while he ventured to meet the ene∣my. In her terror she submitted to this expedient, which, on recovery from her panic, she bitterly re∣pented; for when she issued from her retreat, she sought in vain for Cariolano, and supposed, from the clamour she had heard, that he must have perished. She continued to wander in this wretched state of mind, still unable to hear any tidings of her protec∣tor. While the fair Indian thus closes her narra∣tive, Ercilla is alarmed by the approach of a large party of Barbarians. One of his faithful Indian attendants, whom he had lately attached to him, intreats him to escape with the utmost haste; adding, that he can save him from pursuit by his knowledge of the country; and that he will risque
<PB N="168" REF="169"/>
his own life most willingly, to preserve that of Er∣cilla. Glaura bursts into an agony of joy, in dis∣covering her lost Cariolano in this faithful atten∣dant. Ercilla exclaims, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Adieu, my friends; I give you both your liberty, which is all I have at present to bestow, and rejoins his little troop."</Q> Before he enters on the account of what followed, he relates the circumstance by which he attached Cariolano to his service; whom he had found alone, as he himself was marching with a small party, and a few prisoners that he had taken. The Youth at first defended himself, and shot two Spaniards with his arrows, and continued to resist the numbers that pressed upon him with his mantle and his dag∣ger, evading their blows by his extreme agility, and wounding several. Ercilla generously rushed in to his rescue, and declared he deserved a reward for his uncommon bravery, instead of being destroyed so unfairly. The Youth, in consequence of this treatment, flung down his dagger, and became the affectionate attendant of Ercilla. Our Poet, after relating this incident, returns to the scene where his party was surprized in a hollow road, and se∣verely galled by the enemy, who attacked them with showers of stones from the higher ground. Ercilla forces his way up the precipice, and, after dispers∣ing part of the Indian force, effects his escape with

Caupolican propo∣ses, in a public assembly, to set fire to their own ha∣bitations, and leave themselves no alternative, but that of killing or being killed. The Chieftains all agree in this desperate determination. Tucapel, before they proceed to action against the Spaniards, insists on terminating his difference with Rengo, a rival Chieftain, by a single combat. A plain is ap∣pointed for this purpose: all the people of Arauco assemble as spectators: the Chiefs appear in com∣plete armour, and engage in a most obstinate and bloody conflict.</P>

<P>AFTER many dreadful wounds on each side, the two Chieftains, closing with each other,

Caupoli∣can, who presided as judge of the combat, descends from his seat, and finding some signs of life in each, orders them to be carried to their respective tents. They recover, and are reconciled. The Spaniards, leaving a garrison in their new fort, under a captain named Reynoso, had proceeded to the city of Im∣perial. Caupolican endeavours to take advantage of this event. He employs an artful Indian, named Pran, to examine the state of the fort. Pran insi∣nuates himself among the Indian servants belong∣ing to the Spaniards. He views the fort, and en∣deavours to persuade a servile Indian, named An∣dresillo, to admit Caupolican and his forces while the Spaniards are sleeping. Andresillo promises to meet Caupolican in secret, and converse with him on this project.</P>

Andresillo meets Caupoli∣can in secret, and promises to introduce the Indian forces into the fort when the Spaniards are sleep∣ing in the heat of the day. Pran is sent forward, to learn from Andresillo if all things are quiet, just before the hour appointed for the assault. He ex∣amines the state of the fort, and, finding the Spa∣niards apparently unprepared for defence, hastens back to the Indian General, who advances by a quick and silent march.

<HEAD>CANTO XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a panegyric on clemency, and a noble censure of those enormous cruelties, by which his countrymen sullied their military fame, the Poet relates the dreadful carnage which ensued as the Indians approached the fort. The Spani∣ards, after destroying numbers by their artillery, send forth a party of horse, who cut the fugitives to pieces. They inhumanly murder thirteen of their most distinguished prisoners, by blowing them from the mouths of cannon: but none of the con∣federate Chieftains, whom the Poet has particu∣larly
<PB N="172" REF="173"/>
celebrated, were included in this number; for those high-spirited Barbarians had refused to attend Caupolican in this assault, as they considered it as disgraceful to attack their enemies by surprize. The unfortunate Indian Leader, seeing his forces thus unexpectedly massacred, escapes with ten faithful followers, and wanders through the coun∣try in the most calamitous condition. The Spa∣niards endeavour, by all the means they can devise, to discover his retreat: the faithful inhabitants of Arauco refuse to betray him.</P>
<P>Ercilla, in searching the country with a small party, finds a young wounded female. She informs him, that marching with her husband, she had the misfortune of seeing him perish in the late slaugh∣ter;—that a friendly soldier, in pity to her ex∣treme distress, had tried to end her miserable life in the midst of the confusion, but had failed in his generous design, by giving her an ineffectual wound;—that she had been removed from the field of battle to that sequestered spot, where she languished in the hourly hope of death, which she now implores from the hand of Ercilla. Our Poet consoles her; dresses her wound, and leaves one of his attendants to protect her. On his return to the fort, he discourses to his soldiers in praise of the fidelity and spirit displayed by the Indian fe∣males,
<PB N="173" REF="174"/>
comparing them to the chaste and constant Dido. A young soldier of his train expresses his surprize on hearing Ercilla commend the Cartha∣ginian Queen for a virtue to which, he conceived, she had no pretence. From hence our Poet takes occasion to vindicate the injured Eliza from the slanderous misrepresentation of Virgil; and flatters himself that the love of justice, so natural to man, will induce every reader to listen with pleasure to his defence of the calumniated Queen. He then en∣ters on her <HI>real history,</HI> and relates circumstantially her lamentation over the murdered Sichaeus, and the artifice by which she escaped with her treasures from her inhuman brother Pygmalion:—she en∣gages many of his attendants to share the chances of her voyage; and, having collected a supply of females from the island of Cyprus, she directs her course to the coast of Africa.</P>

<HEAD>CANTO XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>DIDO, as our Poet continues her <HI>more authen∣tic story,</HI> purchases her dominion and raises her flourishing city. The ambassadors of Iarbas arrive at Carthage, to offer this celebrated Queen the al∣ternative of marriage or war. The Senate, who are first informed of the proposal, being fearful that
<PB N="174" REF="175"/>
the chaste resolutions of their fair Sovereign may ruin their country, attempt to engage her, by a sin∣gular device, to accept the hand of Iarbas. They tell her, that this haughty Monarch has sent to demand twenty of her privy counsellors to regulate his kingdom; and that, in consideration of their age and infirmities, they must decline so unpleasant a service. The Queen represents to them the dan∣ger of their refusal, and the duty which they owe to their country; declaring that she would most readily sacrifice her own life for the safety or ad∣vantage of her subjects. The Senators then re∣veal to her the real demand of Iarbas, and urge the necessity of her marriage for the preservation of the state. The faithful Dido knows not what to re∣solve, and demands three months to consider of this delicate and important point:—at the close of that period, she assembles her subjects; and, taking leave of them in a very affectionate harangue, declares her resolution to die, as the only means by which she can at once satisfy both Heaven and earth, by discharging her duty to her people, and at the same time preserving her faith inviolate to her depart∣ed Sichaeus. Invoking his name, she plunges a poniard in her breast; and throws herself on a flaming pile, which had been kindled for a different sacrifice. Her grateful subjects lament her death,
<PB N="175" REF="176"/>
and pay divine honours to her memory. <Q REND="inline">"This <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Este es el cierto y verdadero cuento,</L>

<P>Our Poet returns from this digression on Dido, to the fate of the Indian Leader Caupolican.—One of the prisoners, whom the Spaniards had taken in their search after this unfortunate Chief, is at last tempted by bribes to betray his General. He conducts the Spaniards to a spot near the sequestered retreat of Caupolican, and directs them how to discover it; but refuses to advance with them, overcome by his dread of the Hero whom he is tempted to betray. The Spaniards surround the house in which the Chieftain had taken refuge with his ten faithful associates. Alarmed by a centinel, he prepares for defence; but being
<PB N="176" REF="177"/>
soon wounded in the arm, surrenders, endea∣vouring to conceal his high character, and to make the Spaniards believe him an ordinary soldier.</P>

<HEAD>CANTO XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>CAUPOLICAN entreats Reynoso to grant his life, but without any signs of terror. He affirms it will be the only method of appeasing the sanguinary hatred by which the contending nations are inflamed; and he offers, from his great influence over his country, to introduce the Chris∣tian worship, and to bring the Araucanians to
<PB N="180" REF="181"/>
consider themselves as the subjects of the Spanish Monarch. His proposals are rejected, and he is sentenced to be impaled, and shot to death with arrows. He is unappall'd by this decree; but first desires to be publicly baptized: after which ceremony, he is inhumanly led in chains to a scaffold. He displays a calm contempt of death; but, on seeing a wretched Negro appointed his executioner, his indignation bursts forth, and he hurls the Negro from the scaffold, entreating to die by a more honourable hand. His horrid sen∣tence is however executed. He supports the ago∣nies of the stake with patient intrepidity, till a chosen band of archers put a period to his life.</P>
<P>Our brave Ercilla expresses his abhorrence of this atrocious scene; and adds, that if he had been present, this cruel execution should not have taken place.</P>
<P>The consequence of it was such as Caupolican foretold:—the Araucanians determine to revenge his death, and assemble to elect a new General. The Poet makes an abrupt transition from their debate, to relate the adventures of Don Garcia, with whom he was himself marching to explore new regions. The inhabitants of the districts they invade, alarmed at the approach of the Spa∣niards,
<PB N="181" REF="182"/>
consult on the occasion. An Indian, named Tunconabala, who had served under the Arauca∣nians, addresses the assembly, and recommends to them a mode of eluding the supposed avaricious designs of the Spaniards, by sending messengers to them, who should assume an appearance of extreme poverty, and represent their country as barren, and thus induce the invaders to turn their arms towards a different quarter. He offers to en∣gage in this service himself. The Indians adopt the project he recommends, and remove their valuable effects to the interior parts of their country.</P>

Tunconabala meets them, as he had projected, with the appearance of extreme poverty; and, after many assurances of the sterility of that region, advises them to return, or to advance by a different path, which he represents to them as dangerous, but the only practicable road. On

finding them resolved to press forward, he supplies them with a guide. They advance, with great toil and danger. Their guide escapes from them. They continue their march, through various hardships, in a desolate region. They at length discover a fertile plain, and a large lake with many little in∣habited islands. As they approach the lake, a large gondola, with twelve oars, advances to meet them: the party it contained leap ashore, and salute the Spaniards with expressions of amity.</P>

<P>THE young Chieftain of the gondola supplies the Spaniards with provisions, refusing to ac∣cept any reward: and our Poet celebrates all the inhabitants of this region, for their amiable sim∣plicity of manners. He visits one of the principal islands, where he is kindly entertained. He disco∣vers that the lake had a communication with the sea, by a very rough and dangerous channel: this circumstance obliges the Spaniards, though re∣luctant, to return. They lament the necessity of passing again through the hardships of their former road. A young Indian undertakes to conduct them by an easier way. But our adventurous Ercilla, before the little army set forth on their return, en∣gages

ten chosen associates to embark with him in a small vessel, and pass the dangerous channel. He lands on a wild and sandy spot, and, advancing half a mile up the country, engraves a stanza, to record this adventure, on the bark of a tree. He repasses the channel, and rejoins the Spanish troops; who, after much difficulty, reach the city of Imperial. Our Poet then touches on some particulars of his personal history, which I men∣tion in the slight sketch of his life. He afterwards promises his reader to relate the issue of the debate among the Araucanian Chieftains, on the election of their new General; but, recollecting in the instant that Spain herself is in arms, he entreats the favour of his Sovereign to inspire him with new spirit, that he may devote himself to that higher and more interesting subject.</P>

<P><PB N="188" REF="189"/>The Spanish Commentator of Camoens con∣siders this vision as the most exquisite Sonnet of his author, and affirms that it is superior to the much longer poem of Petrarch's, on a similar idea. It may amuse a curious reader to compare both Camoens and Petrarch, on this occasion, with Milton, who has also written a Sonnet on the same subject. The Commentator Faria has a very<PB N="189" REF="190"/>pleasant remark on this species of composition. He vindicates the dignity of the amorous Sonnet, by producing an alphabetical list of two hundred great Poets, who have thus complimented the object of their affection; and he very gravely introduces Achilles as the leader of this choir, for having celebrated Briseis. If the Sonnets of the Portuguese' Poet are worthy of attention,
<PB N="190" REF="191"/>
his Elegies are perhaps still more so, as they illus∣trate many particulars of his interesting life, which ended in 1579, under the most cruel circumstances of neglect and poverty.</P>
<P>Portugal has produced no less than fourteen Epic poems; twelve in her own language, and two in that of Spain. At the head of these stands the Lusiad of Camoens. The Malaca Conquis∣tada of Francisco de Sa' de Menesis—and the Ulyssea, or Lisboa Edificada, of Gabriel Pereira de Castro, are two of the most eminent among its successors.—For a list of the Portuguese Epic Poets, and for an elegant copy of the Malaca Conquistada, I am indebted to the very liberal po∣liteness of the Chevalier de Pinto, the Ambassador of Portugal.</P>

<P>Be∣fore the appearance of Bossu's celebrated treatise on Epic poetry, the French had a similar work written in Latin. The learned Jesuit Mambrun published, in 1652, a quarto volume, entitled, Dissertatic Peripatetica de Epico Carmine.

The famous Chapelain, in the preface to his unfortunate Pucelle, has very warmly attacked these ungallant maxims of Mambrun and Aristotle. In speaking of certain critics, who had censured the choice of his subject, before the publication of his poem, he says, <Q REND="inline">Ceux-cy, jurant sur le texte d'Aristote, maintiennent que la femme est une erreur de la nature, qui ayant toujours intention de

Ils tiennent la force corporelle tellement necessaire, dans la composition d'un heros, que quand il n'y auroit autre defaut à reprocher à la femme, ils luy en refuseroient le nom, pour cela seulement, qu'elle n'a pas la vi∣gueur d'un Athlete, et que la mollesse de sa complexion l'empesche de pouvoir durer au tra∣vail. Ils n'estiment ce Sexe capable d'aucune pensée heroique, dans la creance que l'esprit suit le temperament du corps, et que, dans le corps de la femme, l'esprit ne peut rien concevoir, qui ne se sente de sa foiblesse.—Ces Messieurs me pardonneront, toutesois, si je leur dis qu'ils ne considerent pas trop bien quelle est la nature de la vertu heroique, qu'ils en definissent l'essence, par un de ses moindres accidens, et qu'ils en font plutost une vertu brutale, qu'une vertu divine.—Ils se devroient souvenir que cette vertu n'a presque rien à faire avec le corps, et qu'elle consiste, non dans les efforts d'un Milon de Cro∣tone, où l'esprit n'a aucune part, mais en ceux des ames nées pour les grandes choses; quand par une ardeur plusqu' humaine, elles s'elevent audessus d'elles-mesmes; qu'elles forment quelque dessein, dont l'utilité est aussi grande que la difficulté, et qu'elles choisissent les moyens de l'executer avec

constance et hauteur de courage. Pour prevenus qu'ils soient en faveurs des hommes, je ne pense pas qu'ils voulussent attribuer à leur ame un seul avan∣tage, auquel l'ame de la femme ne pust aspirer, ni faire deux especes des deux sexes, desquels la raison de tous les sages n'a fait qu'une jusqu'icy—je ne croy pas non plus qu'ils imaginent que les vertus morales ayent leur siege ailleurs, que dans la vo∣lonté, ou dans l'entendement. Mais si elles y ont leur siege, et si l'on ne peut dire que ces deux fa∣cultés soient autres, dans l'ame de la femme que dans l'ame de l'homme, ils ne peuvent, sans absur∣dité, accorder une de ces vertus à l'homme, et ne l'accorder pas à la femme. En effet, cette belle pensée d'Aristote qui a donné occasion à leur er∣reur, est si peu physique, qu'elle fait plus de tort à la philosophie du Lycée, qu'elle n'appuye l'opinion de ceux que nous combattons."</Q> Chapelain then enters into an historical defence of Female dig∣nity, and opposes the authority of Plato to that of Aristotle, concerning the propriety of women's ever appearing on the great theatre of active life. Happy had he supported the Female cause as forcibly, in the execution of his poem, as in the arguments of his preface: but Chapelain was unfortunately one of the many examples, which every country affords, that the most perfect union of virtue and erudition is utterly insufficient to
<PB N="195" REF="196"/>
form a Poet; and, as he had the ill fate to be per∣secuted by the pitiless rigour of Boileau, his inhar∣monious poem can never sink into a desirable obli∣vion. The treatise of Mambrun seems to have ex∣cited, among the French, an eagerness to distin∣guish themselves in the field of Epic poetry; for several Epic poems were published in France in a few years after that work appeared; but most of them, and particularly those on scriptural subjects, were hardly ever known to exist.</P>

<P>The Alaric of Scudery, and the Clovis of Des∣marests, can scarce be reckoned more fortunate; but in this band of unsuccessful Epic writers, there was one Poet, of whom even the severe Boileau could not allow himself to speak ill; this was Le Moine, the author of St. Louis. The Satirist being asked, why he had never men∣tioned the poetry of Le Moine? replied with the two following verses, parodied from Corneille,
<Q><L>Il s'est trop élevé pour en dire du mal,</L>
<L>Il s'est trop égaré pour en dire du bien.</L></Q>
<PB N="196" REF="197"/>
The judicious and candid Heyne has bestowed considerable applause on Le Moine, in one of his notes to the 6th book of Virgil, where he examines the different methods by which the Epic Poets have introduced their various pictures of futurity. From his account, Le Moine excels in this article. I can speak only from the opi∣nion of this learned Critic, for the neglected French Poet is become so rare, that I have sought in vain for a copy of his work.—The number of obscure Epic writers in France is very trifling, compared to those which Italy has produced; the Italians have been indefatigable in this species of composition, and, as if they had resolved to leave no Hero unsung, their celebrated Novelist, Giraldi Cinthio, has written an Epic poem, in twenty-six cantos, on the exploits of Hercules.</P>

<L><HI>Keen Boileau shall not want his proper praise.</HI>]</L>
<P>Nicolas Boileau Despreaux was born <HI>in</HI> or <HI>near</HI> Paris, for it is a contested point, on the first of November 1636, and died in March 1711 of a dropsy, the very disease which terminated the life of his English rival. The Lutrin of Boileau, still considered by some French Critics of the pre∣sent time as the best poem to which France has
<PB N="197" REF="198"/>
given birth, was first published in 1674. It is with great reason and justice that Voltaire confesses the Lutrin inferior to the Rape of the Lock. Few Poets can be so properly compared as Pope and Boileau; and, wherever their writings will admit of com∣parison, we may, without any national partia∣lity, adjudge the superiority to the English Bard. These two great authors resembled each other as much in the integrity of their lives, as in the sub∣jects and execution of their several compositions. There are two actions recorded of Boileau, which sufficiently prove that the inexorable Satirist had a most generous and friendly heart; when Patru, the celebrated Advocate, who was ruined by his passion for literature, found himself under the painful necessity of selling his expensive library, and had almost agreed to part with it for a mo∣derate sum, Boileau gave him a much superior price; and, after paying the money, added this condition to the purchase, that Patru should retain, during his life, the possession of the books. The succeeding instance of the Poet's generosity is yet nobler.—when it was rumoured at court that the King intended to retrench the pension of Corneille, Boileau hastened to Madame de Mon∣tespan, and said, that his Sovereign, equitable as he was, could not, without injustice, grant a pension to an author like himself, just ascending Parnas∣sus,
<PB N="198" REF="199"/>
and take it from Corneille, who had so long been seated on the summit; that he entreated her, for the honour of the King, to prevail on his Majesty rather to strike off <HI>his</HI> pension, than to withdraw that reward from a man whose title to it was incomparably greater; and that he should more easily console himself under the loss of that distinction, than under the affliction of seeing it taken away from such a Poet as Corneille. This magnanimous application had the success which it deserved, and it appears the more noble, when we recollect that the rival of Corneille was the inti∣mate friend of Boileau.</P>
<P>The long and unreserved intercourse which subsisted between our Poet and Racine was highly beneficial and honourable to both. The dying farewell of the latter is the most expressive eulogy on the private character of Boileau: Je regarde comme un bonheur pour moi de mourir avant vous, said the tender Racine, in taking a final leave of his faithful and generous friend.</P>

<P>Though the Henriade has been frequently reprinted, and the partizans of Voltaire have endeavoured to make it a national point of honour to support its reputation, it seems at length to be sinking under that neglect and oblivion, which never fail to over∣take every feeble offspring of the Epic Muse.
<PB N="201" REF="202"/>
Several of our most eminent Critics have attacked this performance with peculiar severity, and some have condemned it on the most opposite principles, merely because it does not coincide with their re∣spective systems. Their sentence has been passed only in short and incidental remarks; but a French writer, inflamed by personal animosity against Vol∣taire, has raised three octavo volumes on the defects of this single poem. Mr. Clement, in his "<HI>En∣tretiens sur le Poeme Epique relativement à la Henriade,</HI>" has endeavoured to prove it utterly deficient in all the essential points of Epic poetry;—in the structure of its general plan, in the con∣duct of its various parts, in sentiment, in character, in style. His work indeed displays an acrimonious detestation of the Poet whom he examines; and perhaps there is hardly any human composition which could support the scrutiny of so rigid an in∣quisitor: the Henriade is utterly unequal to it; for in many articles we are obliged to confess, that the justice of the Critic is not inferior to his se∣verity. He discovers, in his dissection of the Poem, the skill of an anatomist, with the malignity of an assassin. If any thing can deserve such rigorous treatment, it is certainly the artifice of Voltaire, who, in his Essay on Epic Poetry, has attempted, with much ingenuity, to sink the reputation of all the great Epic Writers, that he might raise himself
<PB N="202" REF="203"/>
to their level; an attempt in which no author can ultimately succeed; for, as D'Alembert has admi∣rabiy remarked on a different occasion, <Q REND="inline">Le public laissera l'amour propre de chaque ecrivain faire son plaidoyer, rira de leurs efforts, non de genie, mais de raisonnement, pour hausser leur place, et finira par mettre chacun à la sienne.</Q></P>

<L><HI>And, shrouded in a mist of moral spleen.</HI>]</L>
<P>It seems to be the peculiar infelicity of Pope, that his moral virtues have had a tendency to diminish his poetical reputation. Possessing a benevolent spirit, and wishing to make the art to which he devoted his life, as serviceable as he could to the great interests of mankind, he soon quitted the higher regions of poetry, for the more level, and more frequented field of Ethics and of Satire. He declares, with a noble pride arising from the pro∣bity of his intention,
<Q><L>That not in Fancy's maze he wander'd long,</L>
<L>But stoop'd to truth, and moraliz'd his song.</L></Q>
The severity of Criticism has from hence inferred, that his imagination was inferior to the other fa∣culties of his mind, and that he possessed not that vigour of genius which might enable him to rank with our more sublime and pathetic Bards. This
<PB N="203" REF="204"/>
inference appears to me extremely defective both in candour and in reason; it would surely be more generous, and I will venture to add, more just, to assign very different causes for his having latterly applied himself to moral and satyric com∣position. If his preceding poems displayed only a moderate portion of fancy and of tenderness, we might indeed very fairly conjecture, that he quitted the kind of poetry, where these qualities are parti∣cularly required, because Nature directed him to shine only as the Poet of reason.—But his earlier productions will authorize an opposite conclusion. At an age when few authors have produced any capital work, Pope gave the world two poems, one the offspring of imagination, and the other of sen∣sibility, which will ever stand at the head of the two poetical classes to which they belong: his Rape of the Lock, and his Eloise, have nothing to fear from any rivals, either of past or of future time. When a writer has displayed such early proofs of exquisite fancy, and of tender enthusiasm, those great con∣stituents of the real Poet, ought we not to regret that he did not give a greater scope and freer exer∣cise to these qualities, rather than to assert that he did not possess them in a superlative degree? Why then, it may be asked, did he confine himself to compositions in which these have little share? The life and character of Pope will perfectly ex∣plain
<PB N="204" REF="205"/>
the reasons, why he did not always follow the higher suggestions of his own natural genius. He had entertained an opinion, that by stooping to truth, and employing his talents on the vices and follies of the passing time, he should be most able to benefit mankind. The idea was perhaps ill-founded, but his conduct in consequence of-it was certainly noble. Its effects however were most unhappy; for it took from him all his enjoyment of life, and may injure, in some degree, his immortal reputa∣tion: by suffering his thoughts to dwell too much on knaves and fools, he fell into the splenetic delu∣sion, that the world is nothing but a compound of vice and folly; and from hence he has been re∣proached for supposing that all human merit was confined to himself, and to a few of his most inti∣mate correspondents.</P>
<P>There was an amiable peculiarity in the charac∣ter of Pope, which had great influence both on his conduct and composition—he embraced the sen∣timents of those he loved with a kind of supersti∣tious regard; his imagination and his judgment were perpetually the dupes of an affectionate heart: it was this which led him, at the request of his idol Bolingbroke, to write a sublime poem on metaphy∣sical ideas which he did not perfectly comprehend; it was this which urged him almost to quarrel with Mr. Allen, in compliance with the caprices of a
<PB N="205" REF="206"/>
female friend; it was this which induced him, in the warmth of gratitude, to follow the absurd hints of Warburton with all the blindness of infatuated affection. Whoever examines the life and writings of Pope with a minute and unprejudiced attention, will find that his excellencies, both as a Poet and a Man, were peculiarly his own; and that his fail∣ings were chiefly owing to the ill judgment, or the artifice, of his real and pretended friends. The lavish applause and the advice of his favourite At∣terbury, were perhaps the cause of his preserving the famous character of Addison, which, finely written as it is, all the lovers of Pope must wish him to have suppressed. Few of his friends had inte∣grity or frankness sufficient to persuade him, that his satires would destroy the tranquillity of his life, and cloud the lustre of his fame: yet, to the ho∣nour of Lyttelton, be it remembered, that he sug∣gested such ideas to the Poet, in the verses which he wrote to him from Rome, with all the becoming zeal of enlightened friendship:
<Q><L>No more let meaner Satire dim the rays</L>
<L>That flow majestic from thy nobler bays!</L>
<L>In all the flowery paths of Pindus stray,</L>
<L>But shun that thorny, that unpleasing way!</L>
<L>Nor, when each soft, engaging Muse is thine,</L>
<L>Address the least attractive of the Nine!</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207"/>
This generous admonition did not indeed pro∣duce its intended effect, for other counsellors had given a different bias to the mind of the Poet, and the malignity of his enemies had exasperated his temper; yet he afterwards turned his thoughts to∣wards the composition of a national Epic poem, and possibly in consequence of the hint which this Epistle of Lyttelton contains. The intention was formed too late, for it arose in his decline of life. Had he possessed health and leisure to execute such a work, I am persuaded it would have proved a glorious acquisition to the literature of our coun∣try: the subject indeed which he had chosen must be allowed to have an unpromising appearance; but the opinion of Addison concerning his Sylphs, which was surely honest, and not invidious, may teach us hardly ever to decide against the intended works of a superior genius. Yet in all the Arts, we are perpetually tempted to pronounce such de∣cisions. I have frequently condemned subjects which my friend Romney had selected for the pencil; but in the sequel, my opinion only proved that I was near-sighted in those regions of ima∣gination, where his keener eyes commanded all the prospect.</P>

<L><HI>Receive the Laurel from Imperial Charles!</HI>]</L>
<P>Ari∣osto is said to have been publicly crowned with laurel at Mantua, by the Emperor Charles the Vth, towards the end of the year 1532. This fact has been disputed by various writers, but it seems to be sufficiently established by the re∣searches of Mazzuchelli.</P>
<P>The custom of crowning Poets with laurel is almost as ancient as poetry itself, says the Abbé du Resnel, in his Recherches sur les Poetes couronnez, a work which contains but scanty information on this curious topic. Petrarch is generally supposed to have revived this ancient solemnity, which had been abolished as a pagan institution in the reign of the Emperor Theodosius. It appears however, from two passages in the writings of Boccacio, that Dante had entertained serious thoughts of this ho∣nourable distinction, which his exile precluded him from receiving, as he chose, says his Biographer, to be crown'd only in his native city.</P>
<P>An amusing volume might be written on the honours which have been paid to Poets in different ages, and in various parts of the world. It is re∣markable, that the most unpolished nations have been the most lavish in rewarding their Bards.

There are two instances on record, in which poe∣tical talents have raised their possessors even to so∣vereign dominion.

From the four Latin verses which the Historian has given us, as a translation of this extraordinary epitaph, we may venture to affirm, that the poetical monarch ob∣tained his crown on very easy conditions.</P>

<L><HI>For him her fountains gush with golden streams.</HI>]</L>
<P>Of the great wealth which flowed into the hands of this extraordinary Poet, his friend and biogra∣pher Montalvan has given a particular account. This author concludes that Lope de Vega gained by his dramatic works alone a sum nearly equal to 20,000 pounds sterling; the revenue arising from
<PB N="214" REF="215"/>
the posts he held, and from his pension, was very considerable. His opulence was much encreased by the most splendid instances of private liberality. He received many costly presents from various characters to whom he was personally unknown; and he was himself heard to say, in speaking of his generous patron, that the Duke of Sessa alone had given him, at different periods of his life, sums al∣most amounting to six thousand pounds.</P>
<P>It must be confessed, that the noble patrons of English poetry have not equalled this example of Spanish munificence, even if we admit the truth of our traditionary anecdotes concerning the genero∣sity of Lord Southampton to Shakespeare, and of Sir Philip Sidney to Spenser. Considering the li∣berality for which our nation is so justly celebrated, it is remarkable, that not a single English Poet appears to have been enriched by our monarchs: yet Spenser had every claim to the bounty of Eli∣zabeth; he sung her praises in a strain which might gratify her pride; and of all who have flat∣tered the great, he may justly be considered as the most worthy of reward. His song was the tribute of his heart as well as of his fancy, and the sex of his idol may be said to purify his incense from all the offensive particles of servile adulation. The neglect which he experienced from the vain, im∣perious,
<PB N="215" REF="216"/>
and ungrateful Elizabeth, appears the more striking, when we recollect, that her lovely rival, the beautiful and unfortunate Queen of Scots, signalized her superior generosity by a magnificent present of plate to the French Poet Ronsard. This neglected Bard was once the darling of France, and perhaps equalled Lope de Vega in the honours which he received: his sovereign, Charles the Ninth, composed some elegant verses in his praise, and the city of Toulouse presented him with a Mi∣nerva of massive silver.</P>
<P>If our princes and nobles have not equalled those of other kingdoms in liberality to the great Poets of their country, England may yet boast the name of a private gentleman, who discovered in this re∣spect a most princely spirit; no nation, either an∣cient or modern, can produce an example of muni∣ficence more truly noble then the annual gratuity which Akenside received from Mr. Dyson; a tri∣bute of generous and affectionate admiration, en∣deared to its worthy possessor by every considera∣tion which could make it honourable both to him∣self and to his patron!</P>
<P>It has been lately lamented by an elegant and accomplished writer, who had too much reason for the complaint, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the profession of Literature, by far the most laborious of any, leads to no
<PB N="216" REF="217"/>
real benefit."</Q> Experience undoubtedly proves that it has a general tendency to impoverish its vo∣taries; and the legislators of every country would act perhaps a wise, at all events an honourable part, if they corrected this tendency, by establishing public emoluments for such as eminently distin∣guish themselves in the various branches of science. It is surely possible to form such an establishment, which, without proving a national burthen, might aggrandize the literary glory of the nation, by pre∣serving her men of letters from the evils so fre∣quently connected with their pursuits, by securing, to those who deserve it, the possession of ease and honour, without damping their emulation, or de∣stroying their independence.</P>

<L><HI>THE loose Petronius gave the maxim birth.</HI>]</L>
<P>Aristotle has said but little, in his Poetics, concerning that weighty point, which has so much employed and embarrassed the modern Critics—the machinery of the Epic poem; and the little which he has said might rather furnish an argument for its exclusion, than justify its use. But Rome, in her most degenerate days, produced a writer, to whose authority, contemptible as it is, most fre∣quent appeals have been made in this curious lite∣rary
<PB N="218" REF="219"/>
question. In almost every modern author who has touched, however slightly, on Epic poetry, we may find at least some part of the following sen∣tence from Petronius Arbiter:—<Q REND="inline">Ecce, belli civilis ingens opus quisquis attigerit, nisi plenus litteris, sub onere labetur. Non enim res gestae versibus comprehendendae sunt, quod longe melius histo∣rici faciunt; sed per ambages, deorumque minis∣teria, &amp; fabulosum sententiarum tormentum prae∣cipitandus est liber spiritus; ut potius furentis animi vaticinatio appareat, quam religiosae orationis sub testibus fides.</Q></P>
<P>These remarks on the necessity of celestial a∣gents, were evidently made to depreciate the Phar∣salia of Lucan; and Petronius may be called a fair Critic, as Pope said of Milbourne, on his opposi∣tion to Dryden, because he produces his own po∣etry in contrast to that which he condemns. His specimen of the manner in which he thought an Epic poem should be conducted, sufficiently proves the absurdity of his criticism; for how insipid is the fable in those verses which he has opposed to the Pharsalia, when compared to the first book of Lucan! Yet the Epic composition of Petronius has not wanted admirers: a Dutch Commentator is bold enough to say, that he prefers this single rhapsody to three hundred volumes of such poetry as
<PB N="219" REF="220"/>
Lucan's: an opinion which can only lead us to exclaim with Boileau,<Q>Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l'admire.</Q></P>
<P>If men of letters, in the age of Lucan, differed in their sentiments concerning machinery, the great changes that have since happened in the world, and the disquisitions which have appeared on the sub∣ject, are very far from having reconciled the judg∣ment of modern writers on this important article. Two eminent Critics of the present time have de∣livered opinions on this topic so singularly oppo∣site to each other, that I shall transcribe them both.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In a theatrical entertainment, which employs both the eye and the ear, it would be a gross absurdity to introduce upon the stage superior Beings in a visible shape. There is not place for such objection in an Epic poem; and Boileau, with many other Critics, declares strongly for that sort of machinery in an Epic poem. But waving authority, which is apt to impose upon the judgment, let us draw what light we can from reason. I begin with a preliminary re∣mark, that this matter is but indistinctly han∣dled
<PB N="220" REF="221"/>
by Critics. The poetical privilege of ani∣mating insensible objects for enlivening a descrip∣tion, is very different from what is termed <HI>ma∣chinery,</HI> where deities, angels, devils, or other supernatural powers, are introduced as real per∣sonages, mixing in the action, and contributing to the catastrophe; and yet these two things are constantly jumbled together in the reason∣ing. The former is founded on a natural princi∣ple; but can the latter claim the same autho∣rity? So far from it, that nothing is more unna∣tural. Its effects at the same time are deplora∣ble. First, it gives an air of fiction to the whole, and prevents that impression of reality which is requisite to interest our affections, and to move our passions; which of itself is sufficient to explode machinery, whatever entertainment it may afford to readers of a fantastic taste or irre∣gular imagination. And next, were it possible, by disguising the fiction, to delude us into a notion of reality, which I think can hardly be, an insuperable objection would still remain, which is, that the aim or end of an Epic poem can never be attained in any perfection where machinery is introduced; for an evident reason, that virtuous emotions cannot be raised success∣fully, but by the actions of those who are en∣dued
<PB N="221" REF="222"/>
with passions and affections like our own, that is, by human actions: and as for moral in∣struction, it is clear that none can be drawn from Beings who act not upon the same principles with us. Homer, it is true, introduces the Gods into his fable; but the religion of his country authorized that liberty; it being an article in the Grecian creed, that the Gods often interpose visibly and bodily in human affairs. I must, however, observe, that Homer's Deities do no honour to his poems. Fictions that transgress the bounds of nature seldom have a good effect; they may inflame the imagination for a moment, but will not be relished by any person of a cor∣rect taste. They may be of some use to the lower rank of writers; but an author of genius has much finer materials of nature's production for elevating his subject, and making it interest∣ing.—Voltaire, in his Essay upon Epic Poe∣try, talking of the Pharsalia, observes judici∣ously, that the proximity of time, the notoriety of events, the character of the age, enlightened and political, joined with the solidity of Lucan's subject, deprived him of all liberty of poetical fiction. Is it not amazing, that a Critic who reasons so justly with respect to others, can be so
<PB N="222" REF="223"/>
blind with respect to himself? Voltaire, not sa∣tisfied to enrich his language with images drawn from invisible and superior Beings, introduces them into the action. In the sixth canto of the Henriade, St. Louis appears in person, and ter∣rifies the soldiers; in the seventh canto, St. Louis sends the God of Sleep to Henry; and in the tenth, the demons of Discord, Fanaticism, War, &amp;c. assist Aumale in a single combat with Turenne, and are driven away by a good angel brandishing the sword of God. To blend such fictitious personages in the same action with mortals, makes a bad figure at any rate, and is intolerable in a history so recent as that of Henry IV. This singly is sufficient to make the Hen∣riade a short-lived poem, were it otherwise pos∣sessed of every beauty."</Q><BIBL>—<HI>Elements of Criticism,</HI> vol. ii. p. 389, 4th edition.</BIBL></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Pagan Gods and Gothic Fairies were equally out of credit when Milton wrote. He did well therefore to supply their room with An∣gels and Devils.

<PB N="223" REF="224"/>
the Epic Poet might have recourse to; but this I know—the Pomp of verse, the energy of description, and even the finest moral paintings, would stand him in no stead. Without <HI>admira∣tion</HI> (which cannot be effected but by the mar∣vellous of celestial intervention, I mean the agency of superior natures really existing, or by the illusion of the fancy taken to be so) no Epic poem can be long-lived. I am not afraid to in∣stance in the Henriade itself, which, notwith∣standing the elegance of the composition, will in a short time be no more read than the Gondibert of Sir W. Davenant, and for the same reason."</Q><BIBL>—<HI>Letters on Chivalry and Ro∣mance,</HI> Letter X.</BIBL></P>
<P>I have thus ventured to confront these eminent critical antagonists, that, while they engage and overthrow each other, we may observe the injustice produced by the spirit of systematical criticism, even in authors most respectable for their talents and erudition.—Here is the unfortunate Voltaire placed between two critical fires, which equally destory him. The <HI>first</HI> Critic asserts that the Henriade must be short-lived, because the Poet <HI>has in∣troduced invisible and superior agents;</HI>—the <HI>second</HI> denounces the same fate against it, because <HI>it wants</HI>
<PB N="224" REF="225"/>
the <HI>agency of superior natures:</HI> yet surely every reader of Poetry, who is not influenced by any par∣ticular system, will readily allow, that if Voltaire had treated his subject with true Epic spirit in all other points, neither the introduction nor the ab∣sence of St. Louis could be singly sufficient to plunge the Henriade in oblivion. Indeed the learned author, who has spoken in so peremptory a manner concerning the necessity of supernatural agents to preserve the existence of an Epic poem, appears rather unfortunate in the two examples by which he endeavours to support his doctrine; for the Epic poems both of Davenant and Voltaire have sufficient defects to account for any neglect which may be their lot, without considering the article of Machinery.</P>
<P>If I have warmly opposed any decisions of this exalted Critic, it is from a persuasion (in which I may perhaps be mistaken) that <HI>some</HI> of his maxims have a strong tendency to injure an art highly dear to us both; an art on which his genius and learning have cast <HI>many</HI> rays of pleasing and of useful light.</P>

<P>The Indian mythology, as it has lately been illustrated in the writings of Mr. Holwell, is finely calculated to answer the purpose of any poetical genius who may wish to introduce new machinery into the se∣rious Epic Poem. Besides the powerful charm of novelty, it would have the advantage of not clash∣ing with our national religion; for the endeavours of Mr. Holwell to reconcile the ancient and pure doctrine of Bramah with the dispensation of Christ, have so far succeeded, that if his system does not satisfy a theologist, it certainly affords a sufficient basis for the structure of a Poem. In perusing his account of the Indian scripture, every reader of
<PB N="226" REF="227"/>
imagination may, I think, perceive, that the Shastah might supply a poetical spirit with as rich a mass of ideal treasure as fancy could wish to work upon.—An Epic Poet, desirous of laying the scene of his action in India, would be more em∣barrassed to find interesting Heroes than proper Divinities.—Had justice and generosity inspired and guided that English valour, which has signa∣lized itself on the plains of Indostan; had the arms of our country been employed to deliver the native Indians from the oppressive usurpation of the Ma∣hometan powers; such exploits would present to the Epic Muse a subject truly noble, and the my∣thology of the East might enrich it with the most splendid decorations. Whether it be possible or not to find such a subject in the records of our In∣dian history, I leave the reader to determine.—Our great Historian of the Roman empire has intimat∣ed, in a note to the first volume of his immortal work, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the wonderful expedition of Odin, which deduces the enmity of the Goths and Ro∣mans from so memorable a cause, might supply the noble ground-work of an Epic poem."</Q> The idea is certainly both just and splendid. Had Gray been ever tempted to engage in such a work, he would probably have convinced us, that the Northern my∣thology has still sufficient power to seize and en∣chant
<PB N="227" REF="228"/>
the imagination, as much in Epic as in Lyric composition.</P>
<P>It may amuse our speculative Critics, to consi∣der how far the <HI>religious Gothic fables</HI> should be in∣troduced or rejected, to render such a performance most interesting to a modern reader. Few judges would agree in their sentiments on the question; and perhaps the great dispute concerning Machi∣nery cannot be fairly adjusted, till some happy ge∣nius shall possess ambition and perseverance enough to execute two Epic poems, in the one adopting and in the other rejecting, supernatural agents; for Reason alone is by no means an infallible con∣ductor in the province of Fancy; and in the poe∣tical as well as the philosophical world, experiment is the surest guide to truth.</P>
