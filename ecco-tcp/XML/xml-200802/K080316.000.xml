<P>OBSERVATIONS ON THE STATE of the HIGHWAYS, AND On the LAWS for Amending and Keeping them in REPAIR;</P>
<P>WITH A DRAUGHT of a BILL for comprehending and reducing into one Act of Parliament the most essential Parts of all the Statutes in Force relating to the Highways, and for making Provision for the more easy and effectual Repair of the High∣ways.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Reflections contained in the following Pages, are the Result of an Enquiry to which my Duty led me, wherein the Neces∣sity
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
of an Alteration is suggested in a Branch of the Statute-Laws of great Importance to the internal Interests of this Nation; and a Proposal for an Amendment of those Laws, is humbly submitted to that Authority, in which alone the Power of enacting and re∣pealing Statutes resides.</P>
<P>It is not in Behalf of a Book, but as the Advocate of the industrious Poor, the Sinews, the Muscles of the Body politic, and as the Friend of Agricul∣ture and Manufactures, the most inno∣cent and laudable Means of national Greatness, that I presume to address your Lordship.</P>
<P>The Relation which your Lordship, by an Office of great Trust and Ho∣nour, bears to a County, that, with∣out
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
any invidious Comparison, is se∣cond to none in the Kingdom for Wealth and Grandeur, and which is ho∣noured by the Residence of his Majesty and the Royal Family, had afforded a plausible Excuse for this Trouble; but the Consideration of that Benevolence and Zeal for the Interests of your Coun∣try, which you have exerted in many In∣stances, too recent to be forgotten, left no Room to doubt but that any At∣tempt for its Service would be favour∣ably received.</P>
<P>Permit me therefore, my Lord, so far only as it shall seem likely to produce any Benefit to the Public, to intreat your Lordship's Protection for the fol∣lowing Proposal; as I am firmly per∣suaded, that if it meets with Approba∣tion,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
your Lordship's Wisdom and Hu∣manity will suggest the Means of ren∣dering that Benefit as extensive and ef∣fectual as possible. I am with great Respect,</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Bill to which the following Observations are an Introduction consists,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Of those Clauses in the several Acts of Parliament now in Force which have been found most useful, with some few Variations.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Of such new Clauses as seemed ne∣cessary for answering the Ends now proposed: These latter are printed in a different Character from the Rest of the Bill, and are recommended to the Consideration, in the approaching Recess of Parliament, of those Members of either House, who whether in Business or Retirement are equally solicitous to promote the public Good, and who knowing that the Meaning and Operation of legal Language is one of the most evanescent Subjects that the human Mind is conversant with, will employ their Talents in detecting any of those in∣formal Expressions which often defeat the Pur∣poses of the best intended Laws.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
The general Form of the <HI>BILL</HI> was suggested by a casual View of an anonymous Pamphlet, pub∣lished almost Thirty Years ago, under the Title of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A Scheme for reducing all the Laws relating to the common Highways into one Act of Par∣liament;"</Q> and said in the Preface to have been written by a Gentleman in the Commission of the Peace, who had made the Amendment of the Highways his principal Care for many Years. But this Scheme consisting merely of a Draught of a Bill for that Purpose, not very artificial in its Construction, very little Assistance could be de∣rived from it more than regarded the Selection and Arrangement of the Clauses in former Sta∣tutes, proper to be retained in any future Law; and as not only the Method of imposing and ap∣portioning the Statute-Duty, now recommended, is widely different from that Author's, but every Section contained in his Scheme has been both for∣mally and substantially varied, and the Preamble, and almost every one of the additional Clauses new drawn, the Author of the present Publication fears he has made himself answerable for what∣ever may be found amiss in the Bill as it now stands.</P>
<P>Perhaps, in estimating the Price of a Day's Labour at one Shilling and Six-pence, he has ex∣ceeded the usual Rate; if this should be the Case, let it be remembred that he had an Eye to the
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Counties adjacent to the Metropolis, and that any other Estimation, tho' it may occasion some small Alteration in the Penalties, will not affect the general Reasoning contained in the Proposal.</P>
<P>If it should be thought eligible, notwithstand∣ing the Reasons within given to the contrary, to annihilate the Statute-Duty, the Bill may be easily adapted to that End: But this the Public may be assured of, that every Attempt to amend the Highway-Laws by additional or explanatory Acts, will produce great Confusion among those whose Duty it is to execute them; and that nothing can remedy the Evils at present complained of, but the Consolidation into one Act of the most effica∣cious Clauses contained in those now subsisting.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE STATE of the HIGHWAYS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Attention of the Public, not∣withstanding it has been engaged by an Object of the utmost Importance, has of late Years been employed to a very extraordinary Degree in the Repair and Im∣provement of the Public Roads in this and the neighbouring Kingdom. Persons of all Ranks and Professions, the Philosopher and the Mecha∣nic, have, with a laudable Emulation, contend∣ed who should most promote the Interest of this Country, by facilitating the Methods of convey∣ing its Produce from one End to the other.</P>
<P>Nor is this to be looked upon as any other than a particular Mode of that Benevolence,
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
which, if we do not greatly flatter ourselves, is at present the distinguishing Characteristic of the Inhabitants of this Island; a Principle which we have beheld operating in various Ways, and which even now, seeks and solicits Occasion for its Exertion.</P>
<P>A Disposition more favourable to any Propo∣sal calculated either to remove a public Griev∣ance, or produce any positive Good, is not to be wished for; and it is hoped, that that contained in the following Pages may be thought to have a Tendency to promote one or other of those Ends.</P>
<P>It is too obvious to need insisting on, that very little of the Concern which has of late been shewn about the Roads in general, has been di∣rected to those which lead from Parish to Pa∣rish, and are not the ordinary Channel of Con∣veyance to Cities and Towns of great Trade. The Invention of Turnpikes is manifestly calcu∣lated for great Roads; which, as they are made in Favour of Commerce, produce a Revenue sufficient to keep them in Repair; but the for∣mer have been left to the Care of the Surveyors of the Highways in their respective Parishes, sub∣ject to the Direction and Controul of the Justices of Peace, whose Authority in this Branch of their Jurisdiction is of such a Nature, that it car∣ries the Appearance of great Oppression, and
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
can seldom be exerted to any beneficial Pur∣pose.</P>
<P>In what Manner, and by whom, the High∣ways were anciently repaired, does not at this Time clearly appear: it is probable, that while the Feudal Law subsisted in its greatest Vi∣gour, and the Number of Vassals was greater than it has been at any Time since the Introduc∣tion of Manufactures and Commerce amongst us, that the baser Tenures, particularly that of Villenage, might oblige the inferior Class of Peo∣ple to this Duty; and this Opinion seems to be warranted by a Passage of an Author of very re∣spectable Authority, whereby it appears, that the Judges had in Charge to enquire, among other Things, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of common Highways destroy∣ed, or otherwise in bad Repair, who is bound to repair and amend them; and such as are presented shall be attached by personal Distress to appear; and if it be found on their Appear∣ance in Court, that they hold certain Tene∣ments of the King upon Condition that they repair such Way, the said Tenements are to be seised into the King's Hands, and the She∣riffs are to answer for the Issues, and to cause the Repairs to be done: and where there is no Tenement held of the King by the Perform∣ing, such Persons as are bound to repair the Ways, and have not discharged their Duty, are to be in the King's Mercy; and the She∣riff
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
is to be commanded, that he cause them to be distrained by their Cattle and by their Chattels, and to detain the Distresses until they have amended the Defects."</Q> <HI>Britton, cap.</HI> 20. <HI>De plusors Tortz.</HI></P>
<P>The Statute of <HI>Winton,</HI> 13 <HI>Edw.</HI> I. seems to have been made but in Affirmance of this Law, for thereby the Lord is <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to abate certain Nu∣sances in the Highways leading from one Mar∣ket-Town to another, or be fined at the King's Pleasure; he is also to fell the Under∣woods in such Highways, and for that Pur∣pose is to have the Aid of the Country.</Q></P>
<P>But the earliest Statute of which the Law now seems to take Notice, is that of 2 <HI>&amp;</HI> 3 <HI>Phil. &amp; Mar. cap.</HI> 8. which, after creating an Office till then unknown to our Constitution, that of Surveyors of the Highways, proceeds to direct the Manner of their Election and Choice, in Terms which import</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Constable and Churchwardens of every Parish shall yearly upon <HI>Tuesday</HI> or <HI>Wednesday</HI> in <HI>Easter</HI> Week call together a Number of the Parishioners, and shall elect two of the Parish to be Surveyors for one Year of the Works for amending of the Highways leading to any Market-Town, which Persons shall have Authority to order and direct the
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
Persons and Carriages that shall be appointed for the amending the Highways by their Di∣rections, and shall take upon them the said Offices, upon Pain to forfeit 20<HI>s.</HI>"</Q> The Statute then proceeds to enact,</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> 2. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Constable and Church∣wardens shall then also appoint four Days for amending the Highways before the Feast of St. <HI>John Baptist,</HI> and shall openly in the Church the next <HI>Sunday</HI> after <HI>Easter</HI> give Knowledge of the same four Days; and upon the said Days the Parishioners shall endeavour themselves to the Amending of the Highways, and shall be chargeable thereto as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI> Every Person for every Ploughland in Tillage, or Pasture, that he or she shall occupy in the Parish, and every other Person keeping there a Draught or Plough, shall send at every Day and Place appointed, one Wain or Cart furnished after the Custom of the Coun∣try with Oxen, Horses, or other Cattle; and all other Necessaries to carry Things conveni∣ent; and also two able Men with the same, upon Pain of every Draught making Default, 10<HI>s.</HI> And every other Housholder, Cottager, and Labourer, able to labour, and being no hired Servant by the Year, shall by them∣selves, or one sufficient Labourer, upon every of the said four Days, work in the Amend∣ment of the Highways, upon Pain to lose
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
for every Day 12<HI>d.</HI> and all the said Persons and Carriages shall do their Works as they shall be appointed by the Supervisors eight Hours of every of the said Days, unless they be otherwise licensed by them. And the Stewards of every Leet shall have Power to enquire, by the Oaths of the Suitors, of all Offences against this Statute, and to as∣ssess Fines and Amerciaments as shall be thought meet by the Steward; and in Default of such Enquiry or Presentment, the Justices of Peace shall have Authority to enquire of the same Offences at their Quarter-Sessions, and to assess Fines as they or any two of them, whereof one to be of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> shall think meet; and the Steward of every Leet shall make estreats indented of the Fines and Amer∣ciaments for the Defaults presented before him, and shall deliver one Part thereof sealed and signed by him to the Bailiff or High Constable of every Hundred, and the other Part to the Constable and Churchwardens of the Parish wherein the Defaults were made; the same to be yearly delivered within Six Weeks after the Feast of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> and the Clerk of the Peace shall make like Estreats of the Fines and Amerciaments for the Defaults presented before the Justices of the Peace, and deliver the same as aforesaid; which Estreats shall be sufficient Warrant to the Bailiff or
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
chief Constable to levy the Amerciaments and Fines by Distress; and if no sufficient Distress can be found, or the Offender shall refuse to pay the Amerciament or Fine, and do not pay the same within twenty Days after De∣mand, such Person to forfeit double the Sum that he should have paid."</Q></P>
<P>The Statute above cited was to continue in Force for Seven Years, but being suffered to ex∣pire, it was revived by 5 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 13. and by 29 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 5. it was made perpetual.</P>
<P>There is great reason to think that these Pro∣visions of the Law fell very far short of produ∣cing the Ends proposed by them, since we find that the Repair of Bridges, Causways, and Highways, even after the Time of <HI>Phil. &amp; Mar.</HI> was deemed a laudable Exertion of public Spirit. <HI>Sutton,</HI> the Founder of the <HI>Charter-House,</HI> be∣queathed by his Will great Sums for Pur∣poses of this Sort. The Testaments of wealthy People, who died before the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, afford many other Examples of the like Nature; and many Corporations are Feoffees of Lands charged with the perpetual Repair of public Roads in different Parts of the King∣dom.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that the Beneficence of this Nation, has, at successive Periods, been directed
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
to very different Objects. The Building of Churches, and the Endowment of Monasteries, were the first Instances of public Charity of which we have any Memorials. The Dissolution of Religious Houses, and the Reformation which immediately followed, furnished Motives to the Erection of Seminaries for Learning. To this suc∣ceeded the Foundation and Endowment of Alms-Houses, after that the Building of Charity Schools, and last of all Hospitals; so that for this Reason, and perhaps, because the Law has taken them under its Care, we now seldom hear of any pri∣vate Donations for repairing the Highways.</P>
<P>We see that by the Statute of <HI>Phil. &amp; Mar.</HI> the Persons bound to contribute, either by Labour or in Money to the Amendment of the High∣ways are divided into two Classes; the first where∣of consists of</P>
<P>Such as occupy a Ploughland in Tillage or Pasture within the Parish, and</P>
<P>Every other Person keeping there a Draught or Plough.</P>
<P>These are to send, at every Day and Place ap∣pointed, one Wain or Cart, with Oxen, Horses, or other Cattle, and two Men, on Pain of every Draught making Default, 10<HI>s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="17"/>
The second Class consists of</P>
<P>Every Housholder, Cottager, and Labourer, able to labour, and being no hired Servant by the year, who are required by themselves, or one sufficient Labourer for every of them, on every of the said Days, to work in the Amendment of the Highways, upon Pain to lose for every Day 12<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we may observe every Individual in the Kingdom, from the yearly hired Servant up∣wards, is required to contribute to this necessary Work; and that those Land-Holders, who, by occupying less than a Ploughland, and keeping no Draught or Plough, are not comprehended within the first descriptive Clause, are yet reach∣ed by the second; and we may very reasonably infer, that had there been, at the Time of ma∣king the Statute, as there is now, any Rank of Men equally capable in respect of their Wealth, of contributing to the Amendment of the High∣ways with those described by the first Clause, and yet not included in it; that in that Case the Legislature would, by a few Words, have ex∣tended that Clause to them, and not tacitly have ranked such Persons with Housholders, Cotta∣gers, and Labourers able to labour.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="18"/>
It is true, that even at the Time of making this Statute, it was not universally agreed what Quantity of Land a Ploughland contained, and that the Antiquaries and Lawyers entertained different Opinions about that Matter. My Lord <HI>Coke</HI> has said, that a Carve or Hide of Land, or a Ploughland, which is all one, is not of any certain Content, but so much as one Plough may plough in one Year; and so in some Coun∣tries it is more, and in others less, according to the Heaviness of the Soil. 9 <HI>Coke's Rep.</HI> 124. <HI>Lowe's Case.</HI></P>
<P>Others assert a Difference between a Hide and a Carve or Ploughland; for they say, that a Hide of Land contains four Ploughlands, or 480 Acres; whereas a Carve or Ploughland contains but 120 Acres, or four Yardlands of thirty Acres each: others again maintain a Carve or Ploughland to be an indefinite Measure, <HI>quantum aratrum arare potest in oestivo tempore.</HI> Vide <HI>Skene, Minsheu,</HI> and <HI>Norden's Surveiour's Dialogue.</HI> However, this Controversy is now at an End, the Statute of 7 <HI>Will.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 29. having settled that 50<HI>l.</HI> a Year shall be deemed a Ploughland.</P>
<P>Thus stood the Law till the Time of Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> in the 5th, 18th, and 39th of whose Reign three several Statutes were made for the Repair of Highways. By that of the 5th, <HI>cap.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
13. <HI>sect.</HI> 8. the Surveyors are required <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"within one Month next after Default made contrary to the Statute of 2 <HI>&amp;</HI> 3 <HI>Phil. &amp; Mar.</HI> or this Act, to present such Default to the next Ju∣stice of the Peace, upon Pain to forfeit 40<HI>s.</HI> and such Justice shall certify the same Pre∣sentment at the next General Sessions, upon Pain to forfeit 5<HI>l.</HI> and the Justices of the Peace shall have Authority to enquire of any such Default or Offence at their Quarter-Ses∣sions, and to assess such Fines for the same as they or any two of them, whereof one to be of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> shall think meet."</Q> The principal End of the Statutes of 18 <HI>&amp;</HI> 39 <HI>Eliz.</HI> was the Clearing up certain Doubts that had arisen upon the Construction of the former Sta∣tute, to invest the Surveyors with more extensive Powers, particularly, as to providing Materials, and to increase the Number of Days Labour from four to six. Indeed one of these Statutes, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the 18th of the Queen, <HI>sect.</HI> 2. enacts, that every Person (except such as dwell in <HI>London</HI>) that shall be assessed to any Subsidy, to 5<HI>l.</HI> in Goods, or 40<HI>s.</HI> in Land or above, being none of the Parties chargeable for the Amend∣ment of the Highways by any former Law, but as a Cottager, shall find two able Men yearly to labour in the Highways at such Times as by the said Statute are appointed. But how far this Law can be said to be in Force, now the
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
Method of raising Money by Subsidy is discon∣tinued, is Matter of Question.</P>
<P>But afterwards, upon Consideration, it was found, that in many Places of the Kingdom there was no Use for Carts and Teams, but that the Practice was to carry Materials on Horses Backs, or by other Kinds of Carriage; it is therefore by 22 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 12. <HI>sect.</HI> 8. enacted,</P>
<P>That in such Places the Inhabitants shall send in such their Horses as are accustomed to that Labour, and their other Carriages as by any for∣mer Statute is appointed for Carts.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> 9. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If any Person shall fail to make their Days Labour for repairing the High∣ways, or neglect to send their Carriages, it shall be lawful for the Surveyors to make Complaint to the next Justices of the Peace, who are required, upon Proof, by Oath of one Witness, to levy by Distress and Sale of the Goods of every Person failing as aforesaid (and not having a reasonable Excuse to be allowed by the Justices) the Penalties here∣after mentioned, <HI>viz.</HI> for every Day Labourer 1<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> for every Man and Horse 3<HI>s.</HI> and for every Cart with two Men 10<HI>s.</HI> for every Day; which Penalties shall be employed for repairing the Highways."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="21"/>
Also, by <HI>Sect.</HI> 3. of this Statute, it is <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"pro∣vided, that where the Highways cannot be sufficiently repaired before the Feast of St. <HI>John Baptist</HI> yearly, the same may be re∣paired before the Feast of St. <HI>Luke,</HI> without incurring any Penalty."</Q></P>
<P>And by <HI>Sect.</HI> 12. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Surveyors shall be yearly chosen by such Persons as by an Act of 2 <HI>&amp;</HI> 3 <HI>Phil. &amp; Mar. cap.</HI> 8. is appointed, upon some Day in the Week that <HI>Christmas</HI> Day shall be; which Persons so chosen shall take upon them the Office, and shall appoint six Days for the providing Materials, and for working in the Highways, giving Notice publickly before the Days; and the Survey∣ors shall make Return of the Defaulters with∣in one Month to some neighbouring Justice of the Peace, who shall present the same at the Quarter-Sessions next after such Return; and the Offenders against this Act, in all Cases not particularly directed, shall incur the Pe∣nalties inflicted by the Laws now in Force for amending of Highways."</Q></P>
<P>It is observable, that the Word Teams is not made use of in any of the Statutes previous to this of 22 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. and that that Appellation, in∣stead of fixing the Meaning of the Law, has unfortunately rendered it more vague and uncer∣tain; for admitting, after what has been said,
<PB N="14" REF="22"/>
a Possibility that a Coach, Chariot, or Post-Chaise and two Horses, might be deemed a Draught, yet that they should ever be reckoned a Team, no one can imagine.</P>
<P>We may reasonably enough suppose, that the former Statutes had been found defective in Re∣spect to the Qualifications and Directions there∣in contained, for the Election of the Surveyors. For,</P>
<P>By <HI>Stat.</HI> 3 <HI>&amp;</HI> 4 <HI>Will. &amp; Mar. cap.</HI> 12. <HI>sect.</HI> 3. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Upon the 26th of <HI>December</HI> in every Year, unless that Day be <HI>Sunday,</HI> and then on the 27th, the Constables, Headboroughs, Tyth∣ing-Men, Churchwardens, Surveyors of the Highways, and Inhabitants in every Parish, shall assemble and make a List of the Names of a competent Number of Inhabitants who have Hereditaments in their own Right, or that of their Wives, of the Value of 10<HI>l.</HI> by the Year, or a Personal Estate of the Value of 100<HI>l.</HI> or are Occupiers of Tenements of the yearly Value of 30<HI>l.</HI> or if there shall be no such Persons in the Parish, then the List to be of the most sufficient Inhabitants, and shall return such List unto two Justices of the Peace in or near the Division, at a special Session to be held within the said Division on the 3d of <HI>January</HI> or within fifteen Days after. And the Justices shall then, out of
<PB N="15" REF="23"/>
the said Lists, by Warrant, appoint one, two, or more Surveyors of the Highways of every Parish within the Division for the Year ensu∣ing, which Appointment shall, by the Con∣stables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be notified to the Persons ap∣pointed within six Days after such Nomina∣tion, by serving them with the Warrants, or leaving the same or a Copy thereof at their Houses, and the Persons so appointed shall be Surveyors of the Highways for the Parish for the Year ensuing, and duly execute the Office, and if the Persons so nominated and served shall neglect or refuse so to do, they shall for∣feit 5<HI>l.</HI> to be levied on their Goods by Di∣stress and Sale, and in Case of such Neglect or Refusal, Justices are empowered to appoint other Persons."</Q></P>
<P>And by <HI>Sect.</HI> 13. of the same Statute, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"upon Notice given by the Surveyors to the Justices at their special Sessions, and Oath made of what Money they have laid out upon amend∣ing the Highways, the Justices, or any two of them, are empowered by Warrant to cause an equal Rate to be made for reimbursing the Surveyors upon all the Inhabitants of such Parish according to the Methods prescribed in an Act of 43 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 2. for Relief of the Poor, which Rate being confirmed by the Justices in their Special Sessions, shall be col∣lected by the Surveyors."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="24"/>
But by <HI>Sect.</HI> 18. such Assessment is not in one Year to exceed 6<HI>d.</HI> in the Pound for Lands, nor 6<HI>d.</HI> in 20<HI>l.</HI> for Personal Estate.</P>
<P>It has already been mentioned, that there had been a Variety of Opinions as to the Quantity of Land of which a Ploughland was supposed to consist: it was therefore by the <HI>Stat.</HI> of 7 <HI>Will.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 29. <HI>sect.</HI> 5. declared that any Person that should have in his Occupation <HI>Wood-Land</HI> or <HI>other Land</HI> to the Value of 50<HI>l. per Annum</HI> should be deemed to have a Ploughland within the Statutes of Highways; notwithstanding which, the Practice is to charge the Market-Gardeners about <HI>London,</HI> who are very numerous, only to the lesser Statute Duty, though the Quantity of Ground that most of them occupy might justly subject them to the greater.</P>
<P>By the 1 <HI>Geo. stat.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 52. <HI>sect.</HI> 2. All Surveyors of the Highways are required <HI>ex Officio</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"every four Months or oftener, if required, by Warrant, to give a true Account in Wri∣ing upon Oath of the Condition of the High∣ways, and of such Defects as want to be re∣paired, and of the Neglects of Labourers, and those who are obliged to find Labourers or Teams, to the Justices at their next Special Session. And all Surveyors neglecting to give such Account shall suffer the same Penalty as
<PB N="17" REF="25"/>
if they had refused to execute the Office."</Q> And that by the Statute of 3 <HI>Will. &amp; Mar. cap.</HI> 12. <HI>sect.</HI> 3. is 5<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>Sect.</HI> 6. of the same Act, the Power of the Justices to make an Assessment is extended to the Case of Highways which are so far out of Order, that they cannot be repaired as they ought, without further Power than the Laws had then directed, and the Justices may cause Assessments not exceeding the Proportions limited by the Act of 3 <HI>&amp;</HI> 4 <HI>Will. &amp; Mar. cap.</HI> 12. and the Money to be disposed of as by the said Act is directed, though the six Days Work have not been performed; the raising Money by Assess∣ment not to excuse the Work of any Teams or Labourers.</P>
<P>And here it may be proper to take Notice what the Sense of the Law appears to have been in the Construction of the Statutes above-cited; and first it seems</P>
<P>That a Highway may be either 1. a Foot-Way; 2. a Foot and Horse-Way, which is also a Drift-Way; or 3. a Foot, Horse, and Cart-Way. <HI>Co. Litt.</HI> 56.</P>

<P>Upon a very transient Retrospect to the Laws above cited, we shall see that the Legislature seem to have thought it just, that the Burthen of repairing the Highways should be borne by the several Classes of People into which it had arran∣ged them, in Proportion to their respective Cir∣cumstances and the Use they might each of them be supposed to make of the Highways. And inasmuch as these Laws are not in the Num∣ber of those, which, as some fanciful Legists have asserted, execute themselves, it was neces∣sary to appoint proper Officers, whose Duty should be in general to take Care of the High∣ways,
<PB N="19" REF="27"/>
and see that the several Laws enacted for their Preservation and Amendment from Time to Time were complied with. And with regard to the Manner in which these Laws are executed, we also find, that in pursuance of the Authority given them by the Statutes above-mentioned, particularly that of 3 <HI>&amp;</HI> 4 <HI>Will. &amp; Mar.</HI> the re∣spective Parish Officers and Inhabitants of every Parish throughout the Kingdom, do yearly at the stated Time for that Purpose, make Returns of a complete Number of Inhabitants qualified as the Act directs, to the Justices in their Sessions, who thereout do, by their Warrant, appoint the Surveyors of every Parish within their respective Divisions.—That the Money remaining in the Hands of their Predecessors is paid over to the new Surveyors.—That some Time in the Sum∣mer a general Notice is published in the Parish Church, of the Six Days on which the Inhabi∣tants are required to work on the Highways.—That on those Days some attend, and others make Default.—That about St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s Day in every Year a Return is made of the Defaulters to the Justices, who, if no Cause is assigned on a Summons issued by them for that Purpose, execute Distress Warrants, upon which the re∣spective Penalties are levied; which it is supposed are applied in hiring Persons to do that Labour, which the Law in the first Instance imposes on the Defaulters themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="28"/>
Before we proceed to point out the various Ways by which the salutary Purposes of the Legislature may be, and are defeated; it will be necessary to enquire how far the Laws now under Consi∣deration do at this Day consist with that Justice and Equality with a View to which they were originally framed. The intelligent Reader need not be told, that the frequent Use, if not the Invention of Coaches, and all those various Spe∣cies of Wheel-Carriage, the sole End whereof is the Conveyance of Persons from one Place to another, is of far less Antiquity than the first of the Statutes above cited; and it is far from being Matter of absolute certainty, that a Cart drawn by <HI>two</HI> Horses only, is in Construction of Law a Draught.</P>
<P><HI>Dalton,</HI> who wrote before the Year 1619, seems to make it a Question whether it is or no, when he says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I find that a Draught for the King's Carriages heretofore hath been some∣times with two Horses, as it seemeth by the Statute of <HI>Magna Charta, cap.</HI> 21."</Q> (The Words of the Statute be <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No Sheriffe, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> shall take the Horses or Carts of any Person for Carriage, except he pay for one Cart with two Horses Ten-pence by the Day, and for a Cart with three Horses Fourteen-pence by the Day); and therefore I think him that usually goeth to Cart for his own Business
<PB N="21" REF="29"/>
with two Horses, to be chargeable to find a Cart and two Horses for the Amending of the Highways, and to carry such Loads as his two Horses are well able to draw."</Q></P>
<P>Here we see the Author above quoted driven to the Necessity of reasoning from Analogy, in Order to shew that a Cart which is constantly used for the Purposes of Husbandry, and was an Implement in use so long ago as <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> if drawn but with two Horses, is a Draught within the Meaning of the Statute of <HI>Phil. &amp; Mar.</HI> and after all, his Opinion does not seem (as some others of his have) to have been adop∣ted by any subsequent Statute, or established by any Judicial Determination.</P>
<P>If this then is the Case in the Instance above∣mentioned, what are we to think of that of <HI>Coaches, Chariots,</HI> and <HI>Post-Chaises,</HI> which have no Relation to Agriculture or Husbandry, and were scarcely known at the Time of making the Statute? Or indeed, if we consider that the Occupiers of such Carriages are, throughout the Kingdom, exempted from the greater Statute-Duty, what can we think, but that there is no Law in Being, which, in respect to the Statute-Labour required of each of them, does distin∣guish between the highest and lowest Rank of Subjects?</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="30"/>
It has indeed been asserted, though on very slender Authority, that this Matter did once re∣ceive the Determination of Sir <HI>Matthew Hale,</HI> whose Opinion is said to have been, that Coaches and Chariots were included under the Appellation of a Draught, and that such as kept them were liable to do Statute-Duty in like Manner as those who kept Teams: but we have no authentic Report of any such Deter∣mination; and the Practice throughout the King∣dom is to consider such Persons merely as House∣holders.</P>
<P>There are some Propositions so evident, that they are incapable of Demonstration; for which Reason it is sufficient to say, that as the Law now stands, a Nobleman of the highest Rank that does not occupy 50<HI>l.</HI> a Year in Land, or keep a Team, (and there are many who do neither) and who is continually wearing the Highways with his Horses and his Carriages, is legally chargeable with Six Days Labour in a Year, or the Pay∣ment of Nine Shillings in Lieu thereof; and that the poor Day-Labourer, the Cottager, who has a Wife, and perhaps three or four Infant Chil∣dren to feed and clothe, whose only use of the public Highway is the walking on it to and from his daily Labour, is chargeable precisely to the same Amount.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="31"/>
My Lord <HI>Coke</HI> somewhere observes, that those Laws which impose a Penalty disproportionate to the Offence, are very seldom executed; and the Reason is, that in all such Cases, the gene∣ral Humanity both of those that should inform, and those that should convict, interposes; and so the Offender escapes with Impunity. The same may be said of every Law that seems to be either unnecessarily or inadequately severe; and to apply this Observation to the Case now be∣fore us, we find that the lower Class of those who are charged with Six Days manual Labour, from a Sense of the Hardship of such a Burthen, either do it partially, or not at all; and in the latter Case, being Contuments, they are liable to the Penalties, and so become amenable to the Justices for their Neglect.</P>
<P>The Power of the Justices in mitigating the Severity of the Law, is restrained to very few Cases; the <HI>reasonable Excuse</HI> which the Statutes of 22 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 12. <HI>sect.</HI> 9. and 1 <HI>Geo. cap.</HI> 52. <HI>sect.</HI> 2. allow, cannot operate in the Case of a Person whom the Law has expressly charged, and such as are unable to labour are specifically discharged. To whom then are the Justices to extend this their Clemency? perhaps after all, to those few Persons only, whose short Residence in a Parish would make it unreasonable to charge them with any Statute-Duty. If then the Justi∣ces
<PB N="24" REF="32"/>
are bound to issue their Warrant against every poor Defaulter for the whole of the Nine Shil∣lings, and if every Commutation or Composition be, as undoubtedly it is, illegal; let it be consi∣dered how reluctantly this Power must necessa∣rily be executed, and how much it is the Inte∣rest of every poor Man, rather than conform to the Law to disobey it, and trust to all the Chances in his Favour that it will never be exe∣cuted against him.</P>
<P>With all due Deference, therefore, to the Wisdom of those concerned in framing them, we may venture to assert, that the Laws now under Consideration, are at this Day, at least, inconsistent with those general Principles of Ju∣stice and Equity, from which every Law in the Estimation of good Men, is supposed to derive its Authority.</P>
<P>Nor does the Statute of <HI>Phil. &amp; Mar.</HI> appear at all more defensible, if we consider it in a <HI>politi∣cal</HI> View: A Law without a Sanction is but a dead Letter, and such does that appear to be, which we are now considering. Suppose a Far∣mer is required by the Statute, as occupying a Ploughland, or keeping a Draught, to send a Team to work Six Days on the Highways, and that he is averse to the Performance of this Duty, what is the legal Motive to Obedience in this Case? The Answer is, the Fear of incur∣ring
<PB N="25" REF="33"/>
the Penalty; but perhaps it may be more his Interest to incur the Penalty, than to avoid it. Let us consider whether it is or not.</P>
<P>The Labour of a Cart, a Team, and one Man, is in most Places estimated at Ten Shillings a Day; If the Farmer lets them out to a neigh∣bouring Gentleman, they will earn the Owner that Money; but if he sends his Cart and Team with two Men to work on the Highways, the Labour of them all will excuse him from the Pay∣ment of no larger a Sum: so that if he lets out his Team and incurs the Forfeiture, he saves the Labour of one Man, and the Statute is so far from being penal in this Respect, that it is preg∣nant with a Motive to Disobedience; and this is certain, that no Man will ever send his Cart and Team to Highway-work, if he can either let them out or find Employment for them at Home.</P>
<P>In like Manner may the Day-Labourer argue with himself, and conclude, that if he must either actually perform, or forfeit the Price of Six Days Labour, the latter is as eligible as the former; with this Difference, that if he does his Work, it is a certain Loss to his Family of a whole Week's Subsistence; whereas, if he omits it, the Payment of the Penalty is con∣tingent.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="34"/>
This Defect, it must however be confessed, is owing solely to the Diminution in the Value of Money since the enacting the Statute now under Consideration. Bishop <HI>Fleetwood,</HI> in his <HI>Chronicon Pretiosum, cap.</HI> V. has shewn, that in 1514. which was not a great many Years before this Statute was made, the Wages of a Labourer from <HI>Easter</HI> to <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> except in Harvest, were Four-pence; and from <HI>Michael∣mas</HI> to <HI>Easter,</HI> Three-pence by the Day: and though he has not mentioned it expresly, we may there find Reasons to conclude, that the Labour of a Waggon and Team with two Men, was worth about Two Shillings and Eight-pence by the Day. And by the Statute it appears, that at that Time, as it is now, the Penalty for every Day's Default of those who were to send a Team, was Ten Shillings, and of those who were to labour, One Shilling: now, if we compare these Forfeitures with the respective Duties they were intended to enforce, we shall find them to have been penal to a sufficient Degree at the Time of making the Statute; but the Case is otherwise at present.</P>
<P>It has been urged, that whether the Person charged does actually perform, or pay the Price of his Duty, the Case is the same to the Public; inasmuch as the Forfeiture will purchase just as
<PB N="27" REF="35"/>
much Labour and Assistance as was originally re∣quired of him; and if that is done, it is no∣thing to the Public what Hands were employed in it.</P>
<P>In Answer to this, it may be said, that it seems as if the Makers of the Statute thought otherwise when they made the Penalty in both Cases more than treble the Value of the Duty required. Besides, is it of no Consequence to a State whether the Laws are obeyed or not? we all know, that the increase of penal Laws is one of the most inflaming Topics of popular Cla∣mour, and that every additional Statute of that Sort, is an Addition to the Power of factious and designing Men to distress a Government. Is it not, therefore, of some Importance to the State whether a Law, which has solely the public Good for its Object, is constantly to wear the Face of a remedial or a penal one?</P>
<P>Let us now see in what Manner the Law at present under Consideration is observed in those few Parishes, where the Inhabitants are disposed to yield Obedience to the Letter of it; the Days for performing the Statute-Duty are so far from being considered as Days of Labour, that as well the Farmers as the common Day-Labourers, have long been used to look on them as Holidays, as a kind of Recess from their ac∣customed
<PB N="28" REF="36"/>
Labour, and devoted to Idleness and its concomitant Indulgences of Riot and Drunken∣ness. Besides, as this Labour, where it is perform∣ed, may in some Degree be said to be voluntary, we are not to wonder, if such as employ them∣selves in it are less obedient to the Directions of those whom the Law has appointed to superin∣tend it, than is consistent with the due Dis∣charge of their Duty. What is the Benefit a∣rising from the Labour of twenty Men and as many Horses, occupied in four or five different Stations within an extensive Parish, compared with that of half the Number of each, working under the immediate Direction of an Officer, and executing a Plan which he himself has con∣certed and sees the Tendency and Advantages of?</P>
<P>And this naturally leads us to reflect a little how inadequate in respect of its Duration, is the Authority of the Surveyors, to the Ends pro∣posed in the Institution of the Office: we will suppose a Surveyor to be, as the Statute of <HI>Will. &amp; Mar.</HI> requires, a Man of Substance, and in∣clined to execute the Office faithfully; and that he is what no Statute can make him, a Judge of Roads, and the Art of making and repairing them: whatever Schemes he shall form on his taking on him the Office, he has in Effect but Six Days to execute; we must therefore suppose
<PB N="29" REF="37"/>
that he will hardly think of any Repairs, Alte∣rations, or Amendments, but what may be done in that Time, by such of the Inhabitants as have usually preferred the doing their Statute-Duty to paying the Forfeiture. Besides this inevitable Restraint on the Officer in respect to the Lati∣tude of his Operations, we see he can have no Dependence on those who should execute them; and in Case they should fail to assist, he, as will be immediately shewn, is destitute of a Resource. For,</P>
<P>Suppose him desirous of mending a foun∣drous Way, and that, in Pursuance of the Di∣rection in the Statute of 22 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. and with a View of getting it done before Harvest, on the first Day of <HI>May,</HI> which is as soon as in many Places the Falling of the Waters will permit the Digging of Gravel, he gives Notice in the Church of the Six Days, and requires the Inhabitants to do their Statute-Work; and suppose also, that all those whom he expects to attend do not come in; and that, in Favour of his Neighbours, he repeats this Notice, indulging them with further Time, and that after all they make Default, what is to become of the intended Repair, and how is the Way to be amended?</P>
<P>Why, it will perhaps be said, Let the Sur∣veyor apply the Forfeitures incurred by the se∣veral
<PB N="30" REF="38"/>
Defaults in the Hire of Teams and Men, and go on with his Work; very true, but first he is to receive them; in Order to which he is to enter upon a new Work; namely, to bring the Defaulters to Justice. And first he is to make out a List of their Names, which when completed, is to be returned to the Sessions, which may possibly be to be held either in a Week or in four Months after the Offence; the Justices upon this Return, of Course issue Summonses for the Defaulters to shew Cause in a reasonable Time, why they will not pay; after this, if they do not comply, Distress-Warrants are issued, before the Execution whereof the wet Weather sets in, and there is an End of Road-Work for that Year. The Surveyor is then busied in making up his Account against the <HI>January</HI> Ses∣sions, or perhaps in defending Actions grounded on some Irregularity in the Notice, the due Publication whereof, or of the respective De∣faults, not one in Fifty of them is ever prepared to prove: when <HI>January</HI> comes, his Account is passed, and he pays the Balance to the new Sur∣veyor, who will have just the same Difficulties to encounter as his Predecessor.</P>
<P>And yet, perhaps, the worst Consequences are behind; every one knows, that the Law in general requires, that the Highways through∣out the Kingdom shall be kept in Repair by the several Parishes of which they are Part. The
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>
Law has established a Form of Proceeding by Way of Indictment against the Parishioners, up∣on which, if the Defendants are found guilty, they shall not be discharged by submitting to a Fine, but a <HI>Distringas</HI> shall go <HI>in Infinitum</HI> till they repair. This Remedy may seem to have been founded on the Statute of <HI>Winton;</HI> yet by the Passage above quoted from <HI>Britton,</HI> it ap∣pears to have been Part of the antient Common Law of the Realm, of which the Statute is but a Recognition.</P>
<P>The Statute of 5 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 13. <HI>sect.</HI> 8, 9. has prescribed another Method of Proceeding, which, though seemingly different, is in Effect much the same as that of an Indictment, which is by a Presentment of the Surveyors to the next Justice, who is to certify the same at the next General Sessions, and the Sessions is imme∣diately to enquire of the Defaulters. Now, not∣withstanding the seeming Efficacy of the Word <HI>immediately,</HI> yet the general Opinion on that Clause of the Statute is, that the Certificate of the Justice in this Case, has not the Effect of a Presentment, but must be turned into an In∣dictment; to which, by the Rules of Law, the Offender may enter his Traverse, and no Trial can be had, till the Sessions after.</P>
<P>Each of these Methods of Proceeding seems liable to great Objection; for as to the first, the
<PB N="32" REF="40"/>
Law does not distinguish those who have done, from those who have refused to do their Statute Work, but pronounces its Judgment indiscrimi∣nately against the whole Parish; from whence fol∣lows this apparent Injustice, that the Innocent and the Guilty are involved in the same Punishment.</P>
<P>As to the Method of proceeding by Presentment under the Statute of 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI> we shall soon see that it is not productive of that expeditious Justice which the Statute gives Reason to expect; for suppose twenty or thirty persons are required to work on the Highways the Week after <HI>Easter</HI> Sessions, and that they make Default, or refuse to work when they are out, the Surveyor in such Case is by the Statute of 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI> to present the Defaulters to the next Justice of the Peace, who is to certify this Presentment to the next Gene∣ral Quarter-Sessions of the Peace, that is the Summer Sessions following, when we will sup∣pose the Defaulters are indicted; now, if it should be <HI>Christmas</HI> Sessions before this Indictment can be tried, and sooner it cannot well be, here is a whole Summer lost, and nothing is done to the Repair of the Highways: for, from the Mo∣ment a Prosecution is commenced, a total De∣fection is sure to follow, and there is an End of all legal Obedience; and if any Mistake in the Manner of conducting it, or any Defect of Proof should occasion a Failure, the Offenders are
<PB N="33" REF="41"/>
supposed to have triumphed over the Law, and it is odds if they ever after do any Duty.</P>
<P>The Delay and Expence of these Methods of proceeding are Objections common to them both, and it is most ardently to be wished, that as well for these Reasons, as because of their Inefficacy, they were either totally abolished, or so regula∣ted as to be more effectual.</P>
<P>And here it may be proper to take Notice of the Difficulty that the Justices are under, with respect to the Measure of their Authority in the Case of Non performance of the Statute-Duty; for though it has been said, that by the Statute of 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Surveyors are to present the De∣faulters to the next Justice, who is to certify the Presentment to the Sessions, yet the subsequent Statute of 22 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 12. <HI>sect.</HI> 9. requires the Justice on the Oath of one Witness to levy the Penalties of 10<HI>s.</HI> and 1<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> notwithstand∣ing which, <HI>sect.</HI> 12 of the same Statute directs the same Method of Proceeding at the Sessions as is prescribed by the Statute of 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI></P>
<P>Again, the Statute of 3 <HI>Will. &amp; Mar. cap.</HI> 12. <HI>sect.</HI> 9. enacts, that all Offences and Ne∣glects respecting the publick Roads be present∣ed by the Surveyor on Oath to some Justice of the Peace within the Division: but the Act does not direct what is to be done with the Present∣ment,
<PB N="34" REF="42"/>
nor can any one conclude that the Ju∣stice is to certify it, unless from the Second Section of the Statute, which enacts, that all the former Laws relating to the Highways shall be executed according to the Tenor of those Laws.</P>
<P>Besides all this, the Statute of 1 <HI>Geo. cap.</HI> 52. is so worded, that it seems doubtful whether all the Authority given by former Acts, as to these Matters, is not taken away, and the Ju∣risdiction vested in the Special Sessions.</P>
<P>There is an Inconvenience that attends the Discharge of the Surveyor's Office, different from those already enumerated; for, whereas they are supposed to arise from Disobedience to the Law, this is the Consequence of a Com∣pliance with it. The Statutes direct, that a ge∣neral Notice be published in every Parish, re∣quiring the Inhabitants to come in and perform their Statute-Work on the Six several Days mentioned in such Notice; suppose then that they all attend and declare their Readiness to Work, how are the Surveyors to employ them? In most Places the getting ready the Materials is a Step necessarily previous to working in the Re∣pair of the Highways; Gravel must be dug be∣fore it can be spread; and till that is done, not only Teams, but more than a few Hands are of no Use; and the Surveyor, by calling out the
<PB N="35" REF="43"/>
whole Parish at once, puts himself in the hope∣less Situation of a Magician, who, according to the vulgar Notion, having raised a Spirit whom he cannot employ, is immediately in his Power, and in Danger of being torn in Pieces. There are a few Instances of local Statutes obtained on the Application of particular Parishes, whereby the Labour is converted into a Rate; and this Me∣thod, if it were universally practised, would un∣doubtedly take away this and many other Ob∣jections against the Law as it now stands: but as all the Acts of Parliament since that of <HI>Phil. &amp; Mar.</HI> have proceeded to enforce the Statute-Duty, and as none of the many various Propo∣sals for amending the Highways, which have from Time to Time been submitted to the Pub∣lic, have ventured to assert the Expediency of annihilating that Duty, we may very justly con∣clude, that the Reasons in Favour of it lie deeper than is generally thought; and it would there∣fore be great Presumption in any private Per∣son to say, that the same Advantages are to be expected from any Rate or Assessment, as are capable of being produced by a just and equi∣table Apportionment of the Statute-Duty.</P>
<P>But to return to the Duty of the Surveyor; it has hitherto been admitted, that he is what every one would wish him to be, a skillful Man in the Business of Road-making; but what must be the Consequence if we suppose him to
<PB N="36" REF="44"/>
be otherwise? A Farmer, or if he is an Inhabi∣tant of a Town, a Tradesman, as ignorant of this kind of Business as Ninety nine Men in every Hundred throughout the Kingdom are found to be, what blessed Effects are like to follow from a Contest between Ignorance armed with Au∣thority on the one Side, and invincible Obsti∣nacy, to call it perhaps by a worse Name than it deserves, on the other!</P>
<P>These are some, and but a few of the Diffi∣culties that attend the Execution of the Survey∣or's Office; but what are these, compared to those of the Magistrates, who are to execute the Law in this Respect, as it now seems to stand? Imagine a Hundred or more of the most indi∣gent Inhabitants of a Parish attending to assign Reasons for not doing what in natural Justice they ought never to have been required to do. Imagine these Reasons to be Poverty, a nume∣rous Family, a Wife, and four, five, or more small Children; Sickness, Lameness, and an Income of Nine Shillings a Week to provide for them all Food, Raiment, and other Neces∣saries, and think whether that Authority is to be envied, which the Magistrates are sworn to exert in the enforcing Obedience to perhaps one of the most oppressive Statutes that ever yet received the Sanction of public Assent.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="45"/>
In the Course of the above Reflections it has been assumed, that the Surveyors are in general disposed to pursue the Directions of the Law in the Execution of their Office; but in Truth it is very seldom that they do so: one Error into which they almost universally run, is, the con∣sidering the respective Forfeitures for every Day's Default as a <HI>Tax</HI> or <HI>Rate,</HI> than which nothing can be more absurd; in Consequence whereof their Practice is, as soon as they enter into their Office to assess <HI>ex Officio</HI> every Inhabitant in a Sum proportionable to the Labour required of him, which they proceed to collect with as little He∣sitation as the proper Officers do the Poor's Rate; whereas it is evident, that these several Sums are not due till the Persons on whom they are charged have made Default. And this Er∣ror naturally induces a general Inattention to the Manner of publishing the Notice, which they suppose is to operate against only a few, and therefore is but little more than Matter of Form.</P>
<P>There are two Mischiefs that attend this Prac∣tice, the one of a private, and the other of a public Nature; the one is, that every Indivi∣dual of whom Money has been collected in this Manner, has undoubtedly his Action at Law against the Surveyor for the Sum so collected of him; the other is, that when the Notice has
<PB N="38" REF="46"/>
been so negligently given, as that the Publica∣tion thereof cannot be proved by an uninterested Witness, a Person not himself liable to do Sta∣tute-Work in the Parish, who can swear to the Reading it by the Clerk, and is prepared with a Copy of what he heard read, it is odds but every Shilling of the Money forfeited is lost to the Parish.</P>
<P>This Behaviour of Surveyors, as also that Corruption which we see daily practised by them in garbling the Inhabitants of a Parish, commu∣ting with them for their Duty, receiving of some five, of others four Shillings, half a Crown, or what many of them like better, a Bowl of Punch, are punishable by a Fine of 5<HI>l.</HI> which the Justices in their Sessions have Power to im∣pose; though a much severer Punishment-would await an Officer who should dare to abuse his Trust in such a Manner.</P>
<P>But this, and many other Evils of the like Na∣ture, are in a great Measure owing to the Practice of electing Tradesmen, and Persons in a Situa∣tion necessarily dependent and subject to Influence, into parochial Offices. There are many Pa∣rishes in this Kingdom, where all the Offices of Churchwarden, Overseer of the Poor, Surveyor of the Highways, and Constable, are borne by a few of the Inferior Inhabitants in a Rotation so quick, as hardly to allow of a single Year's Re∣spite
<PB N="39" REF="47"/>
for any one of them; while the Gentle∣men, perhaps from a Contempt of an Employ∣ment which requires little more than to be able to write and keep a Year's Account, or for other Reasons, sit by and see the Public de∣frauded and the Law eluded. There is an Ob∣ligation which every Man is under, who parti∣cipates in the Benefits that accrue to Society from Government and Laws, which will render it very difficult for those who are qualified, and are un∣engaged in Trades or Professions, to find an Ex∣cuse for such Supineness, those who can do it are welcome to all the Satisfaction it can afford them. A Method which has been practised in some Parishes, and is constantly pursued in a very considerable one adjacent to the Metropolis, of joining a Gentleman of large Fortune, or per∣haps a Nobleman, with a Tradesman, in a pa∣rochial Office, has been found to produce con∣siderable Advantages; and were it to become universally a Fashion, the Public would soon be sensible of its good Effects.</P>
<P>Such are the Inconveniencies the Public feel, and the Hardships that the lower Class of People endure in the several Particulars above insisted on; the repeated Complaints of those who are most affected by the Inequality of the High∣way-Laws, have never yet prevailed further than to produce such Amendments and Alterations from Time to Time as the immediate Exigencies
<PB N="40" REF="48"/>
of the Case suggested. How far the Laws in this Respect are even now short of that Degree of Perfection which they are capable of being wrought up to, we may in some Measure col∣lect from the Sentiments of Mr. <HI>Burn,</HI> who says that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Most of the Books are remarkably confused under this Title, occasioned by a Mul∣tiplicity of Statutes standing unrepealed, and yet altered perhaps five or six Times or oftener, by succeeding Statutes."</Q> <HI>Burn's Justice,</HI> Tit. <HI>Highways,</HI> at the Beginning.—He afterwards gives his Sense of this Matter more at large in the fol∣lowing Terms; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Notwithstanding that the Wisdom of the Nation hath been employed for above Two hundred Years in redressing the great Evil of bad Roads, yet, excepting in some Cases, where Turnpikes have been erected, the Roads are as bad now as they were in the Days of <HI>Philip &amp; Mary;</HI> and the Defect is in many Places not so much the Want of Hands, as of proper Direction. The same Multitudes which assemble to demolish a Turnpike at the Hazard of their Liberty and Lives, are able, and I doubt not would be willing, if rightly instructed, to make the Roads good without paying Turnpike-Tolls: but the Misfortune is this, although the Laws have provided that the Surveyors shall be chosen out of the more substantial Inhabitants, yet when that is done, scarce one of them in Five hundred knows how to make a good
<PB N="41" REF="49"/>
Road; and if he does, his Power continues in Effect but Six Days, and his Successor pro∣bably hath other Schemes and Notions, and the Road is made never the better. Hence it is, that when the People assemble to repair the Highways, if indeed they do assemble, they spend the Time in Diversions and ma∣king Bargains, and other idle Amusements, and why should they not? they may as well meet and do nothing, as work hard, and to no Purpose. And from so many Years Ex∣perience the Case will never be any otherwise unless the Justices of the Peace, or others in like Manner, as the Turnpike-Trustees, shall have Power given to them by Act of Parlia∣ment to appoint general Surveyors within pro∣per Districts, with Salaries, to lay out the Roads, and attend and direct the Work, and see the Statute-Labour well performed. And this may be effected without any new Assess∣ment or Charge: half the present Assessment of Six-pence in the Pound, or even less than half, would be sufficient in many Places both to find Salaries, and to widen and purchase Roads where needful; and the People, when they should find the Benefit of their Labour, would work with Chearfulness.</Q> <HI>Burn's Just. Highways.</HI></P>
<P>There is nothing in the Passage above cited that indicates a Necessity for annihilating the

Statute-Duty; on the contrary the Author's Pro∣posal for an Alteration of the Laws seems to im∣ply the Continuance of it; and indeed it is well worthy the Attention of Parliament how far it may be prudent to indulge the People in their present Belief of the Omnipotence of Wealth. The Practice of commuting with Money for Per∣sonal Services and manual Labour will ever tend to render them Scandalous. <HI>Homer,</HI> whose Writings are supposed to exhibit a very just Pic∣ture of the antient Modes of Living, seems to have thought it no Degradation of a Hero to make him his own Cook; on the contrary, in the pre∣sent refined State of human Manners, it would be reproachful for a Person of but ordinary Rank to perform many of the Functions necessary to his own Support; the Time may come when Agriculture and other rural Employments will be as dishonourable in <HI>England</HI> as they have long been in <HI>Spain;</HI> and when the Evil of bad Roads will be more tolerable than the Disgrace of having contributed any otherwise to the A∣mendment of them than by a Display of that Opulence which seems now to be the most de∣sirable Distinction between Man and Man. With good Reason therefore did the antient Policy of our Constitution render the basest Services ho∣nourable, by converting them into feudal Te∣nures, and requiring the Nobility to do that for their Sovereign which they would now disdain to do for themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="51"/>
The Objections which Mr. <HI>Burn</HI> makes are in Truth reducible to two, the Multiplicity of the Laws in the Instance now under Considera∣tion, and the ill Direction of the Power given by them; the latter of these Inconveniencies may undoubtedly be remedied, by committing that Power to those who have no Temptations to abuse it; but the former is an Objection of Weight, is of general Importance; and requires a very serious Attention.</P>
<P>The Statutes relating to the Amendment and Repair of the Highways are not fewer than twelve in Number, made at different Times as Necessity required, and abounding with Clauses which the utmost Skill in the Modes of legal reasoning will not enable us to reconcile. Clauses in the older Statutes have been suffered to stand unrepealed, though such Clauses were altered and amended by subsequent Acts; different Pe∣nalties have been inflicted for the same Trans∣gression by different Statutes, all of which are yet suffered to subsist; and thus the Highway Laws have insensibly accumulated to such a De∣gree as to become a Subject of universal Com∣plaint.</P>
<P>It is true, that the Multiplicity of our Statute Laws has been so long lamented, that Objections of this Sort are looked on as trite; and as they
<PB N="44" REF="52"/>
contain nothing but what has been urged before, unworthy the public Attention. It is near twenty Years since <HI>Montesquieu</HI> endeavoured to palliate this Misfortune by remarking, that the Multiplicity of the <HI>English</HI> Laws is the Price that the People of that Country pay for their Liberty; but what Equivalent can they expect for that Premium, when the Laws become so numerous, that they cannot be executed; and those whom they were intended to bind are thereby in Ef∣fect absolved from their Obedience? what Rea∣son there is to fear that this may one Day be the Case, will appear on reflecting on the enormous Increase in the Volume of our Statute Book within these few Years. Six Years after the Revolution two Folio Volumes contained the public Statutes in Force from <HI>Magna Charta.</HI> By the Seventh Year of the late King they were grown to Six; and at the Expiration of the Thirtieth Year of his Reign, which was Twenty three Years after, they amounted to Nine; during which Period not a single Session passed that did not add several Sta∣tutes to that incredible Number which the Justi∣ces already had in Charge to see executed.</P>
<P>What a tremendous Prospect then has the Ma∣gistrate before his Eyes, who resolves to discharge his Duty by the legal and conscientious Exertion of his Authority! <HI>Lambarde,</HI> that learned and saga∣cious Writer, and faithful Servant of the Public, in his <HI>Eirenarcha,</HI> written so long ago as the
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>
Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> enumerates but eight Statutes that concerned the Justices of the Peace; which, in his quaint Way of expressing himself, were then thought, a Load sufficient to break the Back of any Justice, and now those Statutes are encreased to a Number not far short of Two hundred.</P>
<P>Indeed the Legislature have in some few Instan∣ces yielded to the pressing Necessity of the Times, and consolidated several Statutes relating to one common Subject, particularly in the Cases of the Navy and Militia Acts, into one general Law: this Method was originally suggested by the great Lord <HI>Verulam</HI> to his Master <HI>James</HI> the First, and we find in the <HI>Journals of the House of Com∣mons</HI> 18 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. a Vote <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That a Committee be appointed to confer with such of the Lords the Judges and other Persons of the Long Robe, who have already taken Pains and made Pro∣gress in perusing the Statute-Laws, and to consider of repealing such former Statute-Laws as they shall find necessary to be repealed, and of Expedients of reducing all Statute-Laws of one Nature under such a Method and Head as may conduce to the more ready understand∣ing and better Execution of such Laws."</Q> <HI>Journals of the House of Commons, Octob.</HI> 4. 18 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. The same Proposal has been often reiterated with Respect to the Laws relating to the Poor, but without Effect; and, except the
<PB N="46" REF="54"/>
Instances above-mentioned, it has never yet been carried into Execution.</P>
<P>Whoever has been used to turn over our Statute Book will have other Reasons than those above assigned, to wish that some such Regulation as this may soon take Place in the Instance now before us; for, not to mention the Confusion that necessarily follows from the frequent mili∣tant Clauses to be met with in many of them, the very Language of some of our Statutes is very inartificial, and reflects but little Honour on those that framed them. There is a Statute of 4 <HI>Geo. cap.</HI> 7. relating to <HI>Button-making,</HI> which <HI>Burn</HI> calls a <HI>loose, injudicious,</HI> and <HI>ungrammatical</HI> Act and adds, that it may well enough seem to have been drawn up by <HI>Taylors</HI> or <HI>Button∣makers</HI> themselves: the Perspicuity and Preci∣sion of many of our old Statutes are standing Evidences how much our Ancestors exceeded us in the Science of Legislation. <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> allowing for some Barbarisms made inevitable by the Use of a Language extinct long before the Objects of that Law had any Existence, is in these Respects a model of Perfection; and the Statute <HI>De donis conditionalibus,</HI> the Sta∣tutes of <HI>Uses,</HI> and of <HI>Frauds and Perjuries</HI> are admirable Efforts of human Wisdom and Po∣licy.</P>
<P>For the Reasons above stated, it is with all due Deference apprehended, that the several Sta∣tutes
<PB N="47" REF="55"/>
now in Force relating to the Highways stand in need of a Review; and that those Sta∣tutes may be so altered, amended, and improved, as to be clear of most of the Difficulties that at present obstruct their Execution, that half the Labour and Expence which the Public are at present at, would suffice to keep the Highways in as good Condition as the Turnpike-Roads are now in; and that the Burthen of amending them from Time to Time might be imposed in such a Manner as to do no Injury to the Rich, and take away all Possibility of Complaint from the Poor; and lastly, that an Act of Parliament calculated with these Views, might be so framed as to be as easy in its Execution, as laudable in its Design.</P>
<P>The principal Objects to be attended to in the framing a Law for these Purposes, are, that the Burthen thereby to be laid on the Public be pro∣portionable to the respective Circumstances and Abilities of those who are to bear it, and that those who make the greatest Use of the High∣ways should contribute most to keep them in Repair. More particularly Care should be taken to extend the Qualification of 50<HI>l.</HI> a Year to Houses, Lands, and every other Species of Te∣nement and Hereditament lying, as the Law phrases it, in <HI>Livery.</HI> The Tax on Gentlemen of large personal Estates, and who keep Coaches, Chariots, and other Wheel-Carriages should be
<PB N="48" REF="56"/>
adjusted in a Compound <HI>Ratio</HI> of their Wealth, and the Use they are supposed to make of the Highways. Those who shall have the Super∣intendence of the Highways should be Persons of greater Property than are usually appointed to that Office; and, perhaps it might be expedi∣ent to invest the Justices with an Authority to appoint some one Person skilled in the Business of Road-making as a Kind of perpetual Survey∣or, removeable nevertheless at Pleasure, and whose Business it should be for a Salary to lay out the Roads and attend and direct the Work, as those do who are appointed by Turnpike Trustees, and who shall be amenable to the Justices, and answerable at Law in like Manner as the Surveyors at present are.</P>
<P>The above Observations sufficiently shew the Necessity and the Justice of instituting a new Class of Contributors to the Repair of the High∣ways; namely, Persons who keep Coaches, Chariots, or other Wheel-Carriages. When that is done, the Proportions in which they are re∣spectively to contribute may be adjusted thus:</P>
<P>Let <HI>Ten</HI> Days be appointed for the Amend∣ment of the Highways instead of <HI>Six,</HI> and let every Person occupying two or more Ploughlands send a Draught on every of those Days, and let him that occupies only one Ploughland send a Draught five Days only, on Pain to forfeit in the first
<PB N="49" REF="57"/>
Case, and also in the other 30<HI>s.</HI> for every Day's Default. Persons occupying divers Ploughlands in divers Parishes, should send a Draught five Days for each Ploughland. Those who are not to send a Draught may be charged according to the following Scheme. <TABLE>

<P>But as all the Inhabitants are not to work on every one of the Ten Days, and to prevent the assembling of more of them than the Surveyors can employ, the Surveyors, besides publishing Notice in the Church, should have Power given them to call out by Summons in Writing the several Persons by such Numbers at a Time as they shall find necessary.</P>
<P>Persons who keep Coaches, Chariots, or Post-Chaises for their own Use, and not for Hire, and are not charged as Land-holders, should pay 10<HI>s.</HI> if with four Horses 15<HI>s.</HI> and if with six Horses
<PB N="50" REF="58"/>
20<HI>s.</HI> a Year, over and above their Proportion of Labour.</P>
<P>This Mode of Taxation, it is to be observed, is calculated rather to preserve the Highways in a continual State of Repair, than to answer immediate Exigencies; it will therefore be necessary to continue the Power of making As∣sessments in the Manner prescribed by the Laws now in Force, which Power may be exercised either for immediate Improvements, or in Aid of the Statute-Duty.</P>
<P>Something also should be done with Respect to Evidence. It is an uncontested Rule in Law, that no Person can be a Witness to a Fact which will either directly or consequentially affect his own Interest: The Law in a general View is doubtless very reasonable that thus disqualifies a Man, and yet his Interest may be so small or so remote in a particular Instance, as to contribute no more towards determining his Evidence than a single Hair does to the Trepidation of a Scale-Beam capable of suspending a Ton Weight; notwithstanding which the Law knows no Dif∣ference in Degree, and its Care to prevent the Operation of insensible Prejudices is uniformly the same in all Cases. How great that Care is supposed to be, we may infer from the Conduct of the late Lord <HI>Raymond,</HI> in an Instance yet in the Memory of Persons now living, who, being Lord Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench,
<PB N="51" REF="59"/>
because he lived in the Parish of <HI>Abbot's Langley</HI> in the County of <HI>Hertford,</HI> went off the Bench when an Order relating to that Parish came be∣fore the Court. See <HI>Strange's Reports</HI> 1173. It is doubtless for Reasons of this Kind, that a Freeman of a corporate Town is no legal Wit∣ness to a local Custom within that Town, and the Practice is for such a one in that Case to suf∣fer himself to be disenfranchised before he gives his Evidence. In the Case now under Conside∣ration, a Parishioner who should swear to any of the Facts which make a Part of that Chain of Evidence requisite to justify a Distress on a Defaulter, such as the Publication of Notice of the Six Days appointed for doing the Statute Work, the Non-Attendance of the Defaulter, the Service of the Summons to shew Cause, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> would by such his Evidence contribute to exonerate the Parish and himself as a Pa∣rishioner, from an Assessment which the Non∣performance of the Statute-Labour might make necessary; it is therefore apprehended, that no Parishioner is a competent Witness in this Case, and that even the Parish-Clerk could not be examined to prove the Publication in his Church of Notice of the Six Days, even though he read it himself, nor in short can any one be a Witness for this Purpose but a Stranger in the Parish, or a Servant, or other Person not liable to do Statute-Duty. We know, that in Favour of Justice, the Law has frequently interposed to remove legal Disabilities of Witnesses and others:
<PB N="52" REF="60"/>
By a late Statute, the Testimony of Persons in∣terested in the Establishment of a Will is ad∣missable to prove the Execution of it in parti∣cular Cases. By a Statute of 16 <HI>Geo.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 18. Justices may execute the Laws for punishing Vagrants, repairing the Highways, and the other Laws concerning parochial Taxes, Levies, or Rates, notwithstanding they are rated or chargeable with the Rates within any Place af∣fected by such their Acts. And by 26 <HI>Geo.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 31. for licensing Ale-Houses, any Person shall be a competent Witness upon any Infor∣mation or Complaint for any Offence against that Act, notwithstanding such Person be an In∣habitant of, or charged to the Payment of any Rates for the Relief of the Poor of any Parish or Place where such Offence shall be committed, and a Clause of Two or three Lines would sup∣ply the Defect here complained of, save consi∣derable Sums, and prevent vexatious Suits in many Parishes.</P>
<P>The Advantages arising from the Use of broad Wheels are so apparent, that it would be need∣less to insist on them; this is certain, that by means of them the Price of Carriage from <HI>York</HI> to <HI>London</HI> has been reduced 40 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Whe∣ther it be not practicable to render the Use of them still more general, may be worthy Consi∣deration. At present they are found not to suc∣ceed so well in cross Ways as in the great
<PB N="53" REF="61"/>
Roads; the former are in most Countries so con∣fined by the Inclosures on each Side, as to ad∣mit of but one Track; whereas, were Power given to the Justices to widen those Ways enough to allow of quartering, the Use of broad Wheels would become universal, and produce the same Benefit as in the great High Roads; where, as has often been observed, they do the Office of a Roller.</P>
<P>The mischievous Practice of riding in Carts is not yet sufficiently checked by the many Laws lately made to prevent it: certainly there is as much Reason to empower a Justice to convict on a View of this Offence, as in any other Case where this Power is given.</P>
<P>In the penning of such a Statute as is here proposed, Regard should be had to the Deter∣minations of Courts, particularly of the King's Bench on Appeals from Sessions upon particu∣lar Points, and those Clauses that have been en∣forced by any such Determinations, should be carefully preserved; as on the contrary, those that have been condemned or adjudged nugatory should be amended or totally rejected.</P>
<P>It has been urged as a general Argument a∣gainst an Alteration of the Highway-Laws, with Regard to the Proportion of the Statute-Labour, that the seeming Inequality of the Law is at last
<PB N="54" REF="62"/>
set right by the Advantages accruing to the Poor from the Cheapness and Plenty which result from good Roads, and a speedy Conveyance of the Necessaries of Life: But are these Advanta∣ges peculiar to the Poor? do not the Rich par∣take of them? nay, have they not by much the greatest Share? A poor Labourer, who earns 9<HI>s.</HI> a Week pays yearly a two-and-fiftieth Part of his Year's Income for these Advantages, whatever they are; does a rich Man pay after that Rate? Is there any Gentleman of a Thou∣sand Pounds a Year in the Kingdom, though he keeps a Coach, and wears the Roads more in a Week, than such a Man can possibly do in ten Years, who pays Nineteen Pounds a Year to the Highways?</P>
<P>There are, it must be confessed, some Preju∣dices of a different Nature against the inferior Class of People in this Kingdom, which seem to stand in the Way of any Regulations of this Sort in their Behalf; namely, their extreme Licen∣tiousness beyond what is seen in other Countries, their Contempt of Religion and the Laws, their Want of Respect for their Superiors, their Idle∣ness, Profaneness, Intemperance, and a Num∣ber of other Vices.</P>
<P>Before we proceed to refute the Arguments commonly deduced from these Premisses, let us enquire whether the Fact has any Foundation
<PB N="55" REF="63"/>
or not. It is certain, that the lower Sort of People amongst us are neither so dissolute nor ungovernable as they have been in Times which we have been taught to look on with more Reverence than perhaps is due to them. Tu∣mults and Insurrections are much less frequent than they were formerly; and those who mag∣nify the Vices of the common People, and repre∣sent them as less obedient to Government than heretofore, forget that they have within these very few Years seen Thousands of these People ac∣tuated by some one common Principle, what∣ever it has been, forsaking their Relations and Friends, exposing their Lives in Defence of their Country, and extending the Reputation of its Courage and Humanity beyond that of any Na∣tion in the World.</P>
<P>As to their Intemperance, it has never been so great as to be beyond the Power of Laws to reduce it within tolerable Limits: those lately made to restrain the Use of spirituous Liquors are Instances how much it is in the Power of a Legislature to effect.</P>
<P>But admitting the Justice of the above Charge, and that the lower Sort of People are ever so dissolute, shall we therefore deny them Justice? for that as far as it concerns them, is all that is now contended for; shall we refuse to discharge them from a greater Load of public Duty,
<PB N="56" REF="64"/>
than they are able to bear, at the same Time that we are, with a Zeal unequalled in any pre∣ceding Age, and with a Charity as sincere as it is wild and injudicious, anticipating their Wants, setting their selfish and social Affections at Va∣riance, and even laying in their Way Tempta∣tions to Idleness, and those other Vices of which we accuse them?</P>
<P>The Truth of the Matter is, that Subjects of this Nature, strictly speaking, are Part of the grand Science of Politics, the very first Prin∣ciples whereof very few are able to conceive, and which still fewer are able to reason about, who can pretend to say how much the Immorality of any People exceeds that Degree of it which seems to be interwoven in the Constitution of the moral World? All that concerns us as Men, is to discourage it as much as possible, for which Purpose it has ever been the Practice of wise Legislators to consider human Nature as it really is, rather than as what they would wish it to be, to encourage Virtue, and keep down Immora∣lity by proper Sanctions, and so to temper the various and conflicting Appetites and Humours of Mankind, as to produce good upon the whole.</P>
<P>There are various Causes which contribute to produce that Licentiousness of which we so much complain; one of the most prevailing seems to be the little Attention that Men at this Day are
<PB N="57" REF="65"/>
disposed to pay to Virtue as it results from Prin∣ciple; our very Modes of Expression imply our Disregard of it; we no longer say of a Man, that he is a Man of Integrity, or Probity, or that he is beneficent or charitable, but that he has a <HI>good Heart,</HI> is a <HI>good Sort</HI> of Man, or a <HI>good Creature;</HI> for which cant Phrases we are in∣debted to the fertile Invention of a deceased Wit, whose Writings, paltry and flimsy as they are, it is to be feared, may do more Mischief to Society than those of <HI>Hobbes</HI> or <HI>Spinoza.</HI> The inevitable Consequence of that loose System of Morality by which the real or supposed Good∣ness of a Man's Intention, and not the Dictates of those who have a Right to govern, is made the Rule of his Conduct, is the Contempt of all positive Institutions, of Law, of Religion it∣self.</P>
<P>The Law, considered as a Rule of Action, and as calculated to extend and improve the Blessings of social Life, is, next to Religion, an Object the most venerable; but such is the Temper of Mankind, that they look on it with Abhorrence, and form Confederacies to defeat its Purposes: necessary Penalties to enforce the most beneficial Statutes are considered as Infrac∣tions of private Liberty, and it is much less criminal in the Eye of the Public to offend a∣gainst such a Law, than it is to assist in bringing the Offender to Justice; the Man who instead
<PB N="58" REF="66"/>
of driving, rides in his Cart, in Contempt of the Law, and at the Risque of the Lives of his Fel∣low subjects, is far less odious to the Populace than he who shall inform against him; and thus it may be said that the Laws and the People are in a State of perpetual Hostility.</P>
<P>The State of Magistracy is therefore <Q REND="inline">"a pain∣ful Pre-eminence,"</Q> in which a Man becomes odious by doing Good; and he whose public Spirit would induce him to take upon himself the trouble of procuring Obedience to the Laws of his Country, must relinquish the Endeavour if he has not also Fortitude enough to despise the secret Malevolence of those who have formed an erroneous Judgment of the Extent of civil Li∣berty, and the clamourous Invectives of others who consider the slandering and traducing the Characters of all in Authority, as the Birth∣right of an <HI>Englishman.</HI></P>
<P>For this Reason we see so many Persons whose Knowledge and Abilities enable them to promote the Quiet, Safety, and Happiness of Mankind as Magistrates, decline that Service, and a Trust of the greatest Importance to the Lives and Liberties of <HI>English</HI> Subjects executed in some Instances by Mercenaries; but it is sure∣ly to be wished, that instead of indulging a selfish Indolence and Timidity, they would exert themselves in the common Cause, and endeavour
<PB N="59" REF="67"/>
to avoid the Obloquy, which so generally attends the producing remote <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd general good, by in∣flicting the immediate and particular Evil of Pu∣nishment, not by eluding the Duty, but by shewing that they discharge it upon Principles of true Benevolence, and that while they dis∣tinguish themselves in their public Capacity, by their Diligence and Activity to mark and to punish Offences, they would also recommend themselves in private Life, by the Exercise of those milder Virtues, which give Lustre to the most exalted Station.</P>
<P>The Service of the Public is indeed declined in some Instances, which admit of no Apology. Can it be thought that our early Forefathers ever imagined that a Time would come when nearly all the Freeholders of a whole County should submit to an annual Contribution, levied by the meanest of its Servants, the legal Retinue of a Sheriff, to avoid serving on Juries? or that the Legislature would ever find it necessary to hire Men of Estates to do that Duty which every Friend to Liberty should rejoice at being called to?</P>
<P>Instances of public spirit, however, are not wanting among us. What Difficulties, what Discouragements, have those Gentlemen sur∣mounted, who, from the noblest Motives have laboured in the Establishment of a national Mi∣litia,
<PB N="60" REF="68"/>
a Measure to which, next to the Pro∣vidence of God, this Country may be said to owe its Salvation!</P>
<P>But whatever are the Faults of the Times, it certainly behoves every Government to provide that the Laws are at least free from Oppression or Inequality: those which are here examined are manifestly not so; and whoever has Weight and Interest enough to procure such Alterations and Amendments of them, as upon a careful Review may be found to be necessary, will by exerting his Endeavours for that End, perform for his Country a most acceptable Service, and endear his Memory to latest Posterity.</P>
