<L>By the gnawing in my shoulder,</L>
<L>Before we are a fortnight older,</L>
<L>I fear we worse and worse shall see.</L>

<SPEAKER>CRAMP.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>Ah! that we shall, for my poor knee</L>
<L>Twitches and throbs, and gives me pain;</L>
<L>Depend upon't it brings us rain.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TWITCH.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>Nay, I must differ from you there.</L>
<L>I rather think it will be fair;</L>
<L>For by the burning in my toe,</L>
<L>And by this corn of mine—oh!—oh!—</L>
<L>Good lack a-day! it makes me sweat—</L>
<L>Oh! the burning and the heat!</L>
<L>Besides, my cat so whisk'd about,</L>
<L>Up stairs and down made such a rout—</L>
<L>And that's a sign I always find,</L>
<L>That brings us either frost or wind.</L>

<SPEAKER>CRAMP.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>God send a change, then, very soon!</L>
<L>And! if we judge it by the Moon,</L>
<L>The new one that appear'd last night,</L>
<L>Lay on her back and shone so bright,</L>
<L>That, I assure you, on my word,</L>
<L>She looks as sharp as any sword.</L>

<SPEAKER>TWITCH.</SPEAKER>

<L>What says old Sodo?—He has learning,</L>
<L>And, has beside, a quick discerning;</L>
<L>He soon cou'd tell, should he but look</L>
<L>Into his fortune-telling book.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CRAMP.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>I saw him scarce three nights ago;</L>
<L>But then he terrified me so,</L>
<L>I could not rest all night in bed,</L>
<L>His story ran so in my head.</L>
<L>Sometimes he called the Moon a punk,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="7"/>
And said that Neptune made her drunk,</L>
<L>And that she tippled greedily,</L>
<L>Upon the spring-tides of the sea;—</L>
<L>One night (this great fore-teller said)</L>
<L>The Moon was getting into bed,</L>
<L>And in her reelings had the lot,</L>
<L>To break her chrystal chamber pot;</L>
<L>That he attributes one great reason,</L>
<L>Why we have had so wet a season.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TWITCH.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>Nay, I myself have seen her rise,</L>
<L>With sanguine nose and blood-shot eyes!</L>
<L>Sometimes, indeed, I've seen her shroud</L>
<L>Her head in shame behind a cloud.—</L>
<L>Say, what's the reason?—</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CRAMP.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why, I think,</L>
<L>As Sodo says, the Moon must drink.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>TWITCH.</SPEAKER>
<L>If that indeed, should be the case,</L>
<L>I think she's wise to hide her face.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CRAMP.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>Once I remember, it was told,</L>
<L>When I was scarcely nine years old;</L>
<L>The earth had been all flooded o'er,</L>
<L>For six and thirty days and more;</L>
<L>'Twas the opinion of the wise,</L>
<L>Who knew the motion of the skies,</L>
<L>The Moon had turn'd her turvy-topsy,</L>
<L>And drank herself into a dropsy;</L>
<L>The reasons given were most various:</L>
<L>Some said the archer Sagittarius,</L>
<L>As he one night was passing by,</L>
<L>He let a bearded arrow fly;</L>
<L>And to this day some folks will tell ye,</L>
<L>He hit the Moon plump in the belly;</L>
<L>Which tapping her, for five weeks a'ter,</L>
<L>She teemed upon the earth her water.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="9"/>
Other gave out it was her grief,</L>
<L>And that suits most with my belief;</L>
<L>For now too plainly it appears,</L>
<L>She means to drown us with her tears.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TWITCH.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>But here comes neighbour Rheum I vow,</L>
<L>Who wears a very thoughtful brow;</L>
<L>I wonder where my lady's been,</L>
<L>She shakes her head; what can she mean?</L>

<L>Nay I've seen,</L>
<L>A wonder where I lately been;</L>
<L>For, coming home at twelve last night,</L>
<L>I saw a most alarming sight;</L>
<L>No good to this world it portends—</L>

<L>A comet!—Pray what says our friend?</L>

<SPEAKER>RHEUM.</SPEAKER>

<L>He says the world is near an end:</L>
<L>And I believe his saying's right—</L>
<L>Oh! what a striking, awful sight!</L>
<L>For such a swinging tail it bore,</L>
<L>I never saw the like before.</L>
<L>Nay more—he says—(but that between us)—</L>
<L>'Twill singe the bum of madam Venus!</L>
