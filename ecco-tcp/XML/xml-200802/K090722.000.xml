<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE editor does not undertake to lay before the public the whole of General <HI>Burgoyne</HI>'s orders during the campaign of <HI>1777.</HI>—In so extensive a detail, many would appear quite uninteresting at the present moment, and even at the time they were given, except perhaps to the departments immediately concerned, as far as regarded their execution: such are those respecting the daily duties, the hospital, the com∣miserate, drivers, &amp;c. Those only have been selected, that have for their object the general arrangements and movements of the army, and which may tend to illustrate the operations of the campaign. There are likewise some few by Generals <HI>Carleton</HI> and <HI>Philips,</HI> which are introduced here, as relating in particular to General <HI>Burgoyne</HI>'s expedition.</P>
<P>The editor's principal inducement for offering these orders to the public, was drawn not only from the idea that the
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
state of the expedition is incomplete without them, but likewise from the observation of the avidity with which General <HI>Wolfe</HI>'s orders were received by all ranks of people, and particularly by the officers of the army. It was conceived, that if General <HI>Wolfe</HI>'s orders were esteemed as models to commanding officers of corps, as well as instructive lessons in their profession to those of an inferior rank, General <HI>Bur∣goyne</HI>'s would more fully answer that description, as they re∣late to military transactions far more important, and to scenes infinitely more interesting to the public.—Beside that the au∣thor of them is known to add to the knowledge and experience of the General all the exterior graces and refinement of the scholar and the writer.</P>
<P>It is but justice to his Excellency the Lieutenant-General to acknowledge, that these orders are published without his concurrence or authority.</P>

<P>THE King having been pleased to order, that a detachment from the army under my command be sent upon an expedition under Lieutenant-general Burgoyne, and that this detachment be composed of the grenadiers, light-infantry, and 24th regiment; together with the 9th, 20th, 21st, 47th, 53d, and 62d regiments (except a detachment of 50 men from each of the six last-mentioned regiments) and all the German troops, except a detachment of 650—these corps will accordingly hold themselves in readiness to march at the shortest notice; orders for which will be given by Lieutenant-general Burgoyne, to whom, in the mean time, they will make all reports, as well as to the commander in chief. The detachments of 50, with a captain, two subalterns, and non-commissioned officers in proportion, from each of the six regiments as above, will assemble at the present head-quarters of their respective regiments, and there re∣main until further orders.</P>
<P>The artillery, the department of the quarter-master-general, hospi∣tal, and commiserate, will likewise supply Lieutenant-general Bur∣goyne
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
with such returns as he may call for, to enable him to lay before the commander in chief the portions of the several articles they are capable of furnishing.</P>
<P>Two hundred days bat, baggage, and forage money, will be issued to the general and staff officers, the hospital, regiments, Lieutenant Nutt's detachment, and the three companies of Canadians: the dis∣tribution lists of which are to be sent in, as soon as possible, to the pay-master-general's office.</P>

<OPENER><BYLINE>(By General Philips)</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>Quebec, <DATE>May 1st, 1777.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MAjor-general Philips has been directed by the commander in chief to inform the commanding officers of regiments of his excellency's desire, that the army should take the field this campaign in the most perfect order.</P>
<P>This will depend so entirely upon the several regiments being pre∣pared by exercise and discipline▪ that it is recommended to you to employ the utmost care and attention on such material points, where your own character and honour are so intimately connected with the duty and good of his Majesty's service.</P>
<P>His excellency the commander in chief has instructed Major-general Philips to observe to you, that the good discipline of a regiment, in its general oeconomy, behaviour, and conduct in action, will depend on the attention of that respectable rank of gentlemen, the commanding officers of companies.</P>
<P>It is from this rank of officers, whose time of service and experience give them every possible weight and respect in a regiment, that the subaltern officers are to take their example and their orders. It is by the captains that the younger officers are to be instructed, not only in the common military rules, but in that propriety of conduct, strict subordination, and indefatigable attention, so absolutely requisite in a
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
regiment, and by which alone the soldiers can be held in that obe∣dience to, and confidence in their officers, which will make them bear the fatigues, hardships, and dangers of a campaign, with patience, with zeal, and with spirit.</P>
<P>Courage has ever belonged to the British troops, and there needs only to observe, that a well disciplined body will always add to it a most essential principle in war—conduct.</P>
<P>It is necessary that the officers should be perfectly acquainted with the soldiers of their company, and that soldiers should know their officers, and be accustomed to the sound of their voices. The exer∣cising by companies will be the surest means to effect those purposes.</P>
<P>It is well understood, that all regiments exercise by companies; but it is usually done with a view of joining in battalion. It is here meant, that each company should be led to consider itself as a small, distinct body, and exercised in various evolutions independent of the battalion▪ with every possible view for single companies being taught to depend upon themselves.</P>
<P>As from the nature of the present war, the abilities and military skill of officers may be required to be shown in detached parties, and as it may frequently happen, that single companies will have to act, when an entire battalion cannot always manoeuvre; by pursuing this idea, which the commander in chief has expressed a strong desire of, it will leave the officers and soldiers a dependence and attention on each other, and give confidence to both.</P>
<P>It will therefore be proper for every officer of a company to be per∣fectly well acquainted with, and to exercise that company—for the commanding officer of a battalion to put himself at the head of one company, and to manoeuvre that company; while the other compa∣nies, being drawn up at small intervals of distance, follow the evolu∣tions so given by the commanding officer.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
As the commander in chief has already ordered regiments in their exercise to make frequent changes of their positions and fronts, and to march over difficult ground, it will give the commanding officers of companies opportunities of showing a ready power of taking good posts; and also, though there may be certain separations, owing to inclosures, ravines, ditches of water, marshy ground, &amp;c. of con∣necting the companies one with another, and with the battalion.</P>
<P>Whenever a regiment, when marching or manoeuvring, is obliged to break into parts, from marshy ground, ravines, ditches, small hills, rocks, or thick underwood, it should be done, if possible, by com∣panies, which should divide as little as possible, and never but in such parts, as an officer or serjeant may have command of such separate division; and this not at the will of the soldier, but from the distinct orders of the officers, so that the separated divisions may join, as soon as the ground will permit, into companies, and from companies into battalion.</P>
<P>The changing the order of companies at times, in drawing up the battalion, will make the soldiers ready in forming on general principles, without regarding local stations of companies.</P>
<P>His excellency has in view by this, that the soldiers learn to be steady and attached to their own company and its officers—that the officers, having a thorough knowledge of their men, and being ac∣customed to such instances of separation as have been described, suffer not the soldiers to act, but from their words of command and orders—that every company may form a respectable body singly, and though attached to its place in battalion, yet always ready to act separate from it, as the nature of the ground may require, or the nature of the local service they may be sent on make necessary.</P>
<P>Major-general Philips has endeavoured to explain the commander in chief's pleasure, by signifying how much his excellency depends
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
on the support of captains commanding companies in this army; and there can be no doubt of every respectable and attentive obedience to his excellency's injunctions and orders. The commander in chief has not directed any thing relative to commanding officers and field officers of battalions; as his excellency, as well as every general officer of the army, has reason to depend on their experience, and to be assured of the strong exertion, and active and spirited zeal of the field-officers for the particular character and credit of their own corps, and for the honour of his Majesty's service.</P>

<P>THE regiments destined for the expedition under Lieutenant Ge∣neral Burgoyne are to leave in their respective stores their blanket coats, leggings, and all baggage that can be spared during the summer months.</P>
<P>The officers are depended upon not to incumber the service with more baggage than is absolutely necessary for a campaign, where the movements may be expected to be sudden and alert. The portions of batteaux to each regiment will be regulated on those principles. Three women per company will be allowed to follow the army.</P>
<P>The exercise of the troops under the Lieutenant General's orders is to be confined to firing with ball-cartridges, bayonets fixed, and rapidity of movements in marching, evolutions, and forming.</P>

<P>THE 31st regiment is to move immediately to the posts of St. John's and the Isle aux Noix, four companies to each place. One company of those at the Isle aux Noix to move to the river Lacolle, in case Major-general Philips shall think it necessary, and signify the

same to them. The companies at all these posts to be aiding and assisting in transporting provisions, stores, and all things necessary for the troops under Lieutenant-general Burgoyne.</P>
<P>The 29th regiment to march and encamp at or near St. Therese, detaching two companies to Chamblée. This regiment will likewise be aiding and assisting in forwarding every thing necessary for General Burgoyne's army.</P>
<P>The royal highland emigrants will detach a company to Sorel for the like purpose; and Brigadier-general Maclean will make a tour to the places on that river, and order such part of his regiment to take post there, as he finds may be necessary for the above purposes, or for assist∣ing the officers of militia in executing the orders sent to them.</P>

The line upon the next movement will encamp in order of battle as follows, and will continue in the same order till countermanded. Right wing, first brigade of British, commanded by Brigadier-general Powell, and composed of the 9th, 47th, and 53d battalions; second brigade of British, commanded by Brigadier-general Hamilton, com∣posed of the 20th, 21st, and 62nd battalions. Left wing, first brigade of Germans, commanded by Brigadier-general Specht, composed of the regiments of Rhentz, Specht, and Reidesel; second brigade of Germans, commanded by Brigadier-general Gall, and composed of the regiments of Prince Frederick and Hesse Hanau.</P>
<P>If it should become necessary to form two lines, the second line is to form by the second brigade of British doubling upon the first; and by the second brigade of Germans doubling in like manner on their first. The brigadiers are always to encamp with their brigade.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Camp at River Bouquet, <DATE>June 20th, 1777.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>OFFICERS of all ranks commanding out-posts and detachments are constantly to fortify, in the best manner the circumstances of the place and the implements at hand will permit, felling trees with their points outwards, barricading churches and houses. Breast∣works of earth and timber are generally to be effected in a short time, and the science of engineering is not necessary to find and apply such resources.</P>
<P>The practice of fortifying is useful in all services, but especially in this, where the enemy, though infinitely inferior to the King's troops in open space and hardy combat, is well fitted by disposition and prac∣tice for the stratagems and enterprizes of little war; and neither the distance of camps, nor the interference of forests and rivers, are to be looked upon as security against their attempts. Upon the same prin∣ciple,
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
it must be a constant rule, in or near woods, to place advanced sentries, where they have a tree or some other defence, to prevent them from being taken off by single marksmen. Together with these pre∣cautions, officers will ever bear in mind, how much the public ho∣nour and their own are concerned in maintaining a post; and that to justify a retreat in this war, the number of the enemy must be much superior to that which would make their justification, when acting against a brave and disciplined force.</P>
<P>The officers will take all opportunities, and especially at the be∣ginning of the campaign, to inculcate into the minds of the men a re∣liance upon the bayonet. Men of half their bodily strength, and even cowards, may be their match at firing; but the onset of bayo∣nets, in the hands of the valiant, is irresistible.</P>
<P>The enemy, convinced of this truth, place their dependence in entrenchments and rifle-pieces—it will be our glory and preservation to storm where possible. The attention of every officer is to be em∣ployed on his men; to make use of his fusil, unless in very extraor∣dinary cases of immediate personal defence, would betray an ignorance of his importance and of his duty.</P>
<P>No occasion can make it necessary to keep the arms loaded in the bell tents; nor are the battalions of the line ever to be loaded on the march, till very near the time they may happen to engage.</P>
<P>No parties are to go from camp with or without arms, unless with a proportionable number of officers.—Not only the discipline and honour, but even the safety of the troops, require the strictest prohi∣bition from straggling and plundering; and the savages, as well as the provost, will have orders to punish all offenders in these respects in∣stantly, and with the utmost rigour.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="13"/>
The camp will always be extended as widely as the ground will admit, for the sake of cleanliness and health—but as it must often happen, that the extent will be insufficient for the line to form in front of the camp, according to the present established rules of open files and two deep—the quarter-master-general will therefore mark out at every new camp the proportion of ground each battalion is to clear, over and above its own front, in order to make the work equal. To clear this ground must be the immediate business after arriving in camp; and in this country it may be often necessary to have an alarm∣post cleared in the rear, as well as in front.—By clearing is meant the removal of such obstructions as might prevent the ready forming of troops, to receive or advance upon the enemy.</P>
<P>Quarter guards are always to face outwards, and at the distance of one hundred yards from the bells of arms, with a flêche of earth or timber thrown up before them. When the encampment of the line is with the front to the water, and too near to admit of this regula∣tion, the quarter guard is to be posted in the rear, or those of the flank regiments occasionally upon the flanks. Though the ground will seldom admit a strict regularity in pitching the officers tents, they are never to be placed so as to interfere with the line of defence.</P>
<P>When the Lieutenant-general visits an out-post, the men are not to stand to their arms, or pay him any compliment. The articles of war, which regard the men, to be read at the head of every regiment to-morrow, at evening parade; and afterwards these regulations.</P>
<P>The daily duties are to be as follows—One Brigadier-general for the day, who will visit the out-posts, and have a general inspection of the camp. All reports to be made through him, except when any alarm or other exigence requires instant notice to the commander in chief—A major of brigade for the day, who is to parade all guards, detach∣ments, &amp;c. The picquet, when the last brigade arrives, will consist of one field-officer for each wing, one captain each brigade, one sub∣altern,
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
one serjeant, one corporal and twenty men each regiment—a drummer to be furnished by the regiment that gives the captain. The whole picquet to assemble half an hour before gun-firing, at the centre of the line, and to be exercised in marching and charging ba∣yonets, under the inspection of the brigadier of the day; in order that the British and German troops may acquire an uniformity of pace and motions, when acting together in the line. Half the pic∣quet is always to be posted during the night at some distance from the camp, and at such places as may be exposed to the secret approaches of the enemy. It will be the care of the brigadier of the day to post them.</P>

<P>SHOULD it be necessary for the line to embark suddenly, two guns will be fired on the right wing. Upon the signal being given, the mens tents to be struck immediately, and stowed in the batteaux, together with their knapsacks, blankets, provision and ammunition.—As no other stores will be allowed to be carried▪ seven∣teen batteaux will suffice for each battalion of British, and twenty∣two for each German battalion. Should it be necessary for the line to march suddenly without embarking, four guns will be fired from the right—at which signal the line is to form, with all possible expedi∣tion, in front of the bells of arms, and the tents to be left standing.

<P>ON the sixth, the enemy was dislodged from Ticonderoga, by the mere countenances and activity of the army, and driven on the same day beyond Skeensborough on the right, and Hubberton on the left; with the loss of all their artillery, and five of their armed vessels
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
taken or blown up (by the spirited conduct of Captain Carter of the artillery, with part of his brigade of gun-boats) a great quantity of ammunition, provision, and stores of all sorts, and all their baggage.</P>
<P>On the 7th, Brigadier Fraser, with little more than half the advanced corps, and without artillery (which with the utmost endea∣vours it was found impossible to bring up) came up with 2000 of the enemy strongly posted, attacked and defeated them, with the loss, on the enemy's side, of their principal officers, 200 men killed on the spot, a much greater number wounded, and 300 taken prisoners.</P>
<P>On the 8th, Lieutenant-colonel Hill, at the head of the ninth regiment, was attacked near Fort Anne, by more than six times his number, and repulsed the enemy with great loss, after a continued fire of three hours. In consequence of this action, Fort Anne was burnt and abandoned; and a part of this army is in possession of the country on the other side.</P>
<P>These rapid successes, after exciting a proper sense of what we owe to God, intitles the troops in general to the warmest praise—and particular distinction is due to Brigadier-general Fraser, who, by his conduct and bravery, supported by the officers and soldiers under his command, effected an exploit of material service to the king, and of signal honour to the profession of arms. This corps have the further merit of having supported fatigue and bad weather, without bread and without murmur.</P>
<P>Divine service will be performed on Sunday morning at the head of the line, and at the head of the advanced corps; and on the same day at sun-set, a feu-de-joye will be fired with cannon and small-arms from Ticonderoga, Crown-point, the camp at Skeensborough, and the post of Breymen's corps.</P>

<P>IT is observed that the injunctions, before the army took the field, relative to the baggage of officers, has not been complied with; and that the regiments in general are incumbered with much more baggage than they can possibly be supplied with means of conveying when they quit the lakes and rivers: warning is therefore given to the officers, to convey by the batteaux, which will soon return to Ticonderoga, the baggage that is not indispensably necessary to them, or, upon the first sudden movement, it must inevitably be left on the ground. Such gentlemen as served in America last war may remem∣ber that officers took up with a soldiers tent, and confined their bag∣gage to a knapsack for months together.</P>

<P>IT was endeavoured, among other objects, by the expedition which marched to the left, to provide such a supply of cattle as would have enabled the army to proceed without waiting the arrival of the magazines. That attempt having failed of success, through the chances of war, the troops must necessarily halt some days for bringing forward the transport of provisions; and the several corps will employ that time to collect the sick, convalescents, and such other parties as are merely employed in regimental duties.</P>

<P>IT having been observed a common practice for officers to order to be taken from the provision train, in the service of the king for this army, the carts and horses for the carrying of baggage and other purposes, to avoid for the future this danger and inconvenience to the
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
service, it is in the most positive manner ordered, that no cart or horse is to be used, but for the public transport of the army; nor is any officer, accidentally coming to any particular post, to interfere with the provision train, in any other manner than to give it every aid and assistance in his power, which he is on all occasions to do.</P>

<P>THE Lieutenant-general having received a report from Lieutenant-colonel Breymen, relative to the action of Saintcoick Mills, and likewise having received every collateral information possible, thinks it but justice to declare publickly, that he has no reason to be dissatis∣fied with the personal spirit of the troops; that, on the contrary, the officers commanding corps acted with intrepidity on that occasion. The failure of the enterprise seems to be owing, in the first instance, to the credulity of those who managed the department of intelligence, who suffered great numbers of the rebels to pass and repass, and per∣haps to count the number of the detachment; and upon ill-grounded confidence induced Lieutenant-colonel Baume to advance too far. The next cause was the slow movement of Lieutenant-colonel Breymen; who, from bad weather, bad roads, and tired horses, together with other impediments stated by Lieutenant-colonel Brehmen, could not reach 24 miles from eight in the morning of the 15th, to four in the afternoon of the 16th. The succour therefore arrived too late. The failure of ammunition, in the management of which there seems to have been some improvidence, was another misfortune; the rest seem common occurrences of war. Upon the whole, the enemy has felt very little success; and there is no circumstance to affect the army with further regret or melancholy, than that which arises from the loss of some gallant men.—But let the affair of the mill of Saintcoick remain henceforward as a lesson against the imposition of a treacherous enemy, many of whom, in the very hour of swearing allegiance to the
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
king, fought▪against his troops; and against expending ammunition too fast, which obliged conquering troops to retreat. The reflexion on this affair will moreover excite alertness and exertion in every corps marching to the support of another, by showing in whatever degree these qualities may be possessed by the commanding officers, and they are not to be doubted in the present instance, yet, unless they are ge∣neral, common accidents may become fatal in the course of two hours, may decide the turn of an expedition, and may even decide in some cases the fate of a campaign.</P>

<P>GREAT irregularities having been committed by conductors and other followers of the army, camp courts-martial will occa∣sionally be assembled in the nature of a general court-martial, consist∣ing of one captain, and four subalterns from the line, who will try such offenders according to the clause in the mutiny act, which sub∣jects all followers of the army to military law.</P>

<P>STRICT oeconomy in the receipt and delivery of provisions, at all times an essential duty, now becomes an object of the greatest consequence. The fate of the campaign may depend upon it; and as the preservation of the live cattle demands the most particular atten∣tion, they are only to be slaughtered for the sick, and in such cases as are absolutely necessary.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="20"/>
The commanding officers are therefore to send in an account, upon honour, of the fresh provisions necessary for their sick to the commis∣sary the day before the general issue of provisions to the army, and be responsible that the proper deduction of rations is made for the fresh provision received.</P>
<P>Whenever the stock of cattle shall be sufficient to admit of it, every attention shall be paid to the comfort and convenience of officers; and notice will be given when they can be supplied with rations of fresh provisions instead of salt.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant-general, meaning that every regiment should be on the same regulation, directs, that the servants and bât-men be allowed as follows:

<P>The servants to be considered as effective in the ranks, and to at∣tend every evening parade. The other parades at roll-callings they are exempted from, unless the regiments are under arms. The bât-men to be always armed, and to form the baggage-guard. The com∣manding officers of regiments will take care that this order be com∣plied with strictly.</P>
<P>Whenever cattle are killed it must be always at night—the com∣missaries are made answerable for this. All cattle brought into camp to be sent to the board of regulation, and by that board to be sent to the commissary-general. The troops must be sensible, that buying

cattle privately, and by that means preventing a general supply, must prove very injurious to the service.</P>

<P>THE army will march in a very short time. Each regiment will therefore make such inspection and preparation in regard to their sick, their baggage, and their regimental arrangements, as will per∣mit them to move alertly, and with their ranks as strong as possible.</P>

<P>THE army may be required to take arms at the shortest notice. Officers therefore are not to quit the camp, and no soldier or follower of the army is to pass the Fish-kill, on pain of the severest punishment.</P>
<P>The present post of the six companies of the 47th regiment being dismissed to cover the depôt of provisions, these companies are not to take any duties of the line, but will augment their picquet to 40 men,
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
which, during the night, will occupy a post on the island; and another on the point of land, on the south side of the Fish-kill, where it falls into the river.</P>
<P>The 20th regiment will advance four companies to cover head∣quarters.—They will bring their tents, and receive orders from Sir Francis Clarke.</P>
<P>The picquets and quarter-guards of the line to be posted on the right flank of the incampment, so as to form a line with the British light infantry.</P>
<P>If it should be necessary to form the line of battle in that front, the regiments will march to it by two columns; the 9th regiment, followed by the 21st, making the column on the right, and the 62d regiment followed by the 20th, making the column on the left; in order to fill up the place between the corps of General Fraser and co∣lonel Brehemn—Brigadier Hamilton will order a communication, and mark it to the commanding officers in such a manner that it may be made in the night time with alertness and without confusion.</P>
<P>When Major-general Philips, shall have directed the roads proper for the park of artillery in this movement, they are to be reconnoi∣tred by their respective officers, that their march may not clash with the column.</P>
<P>If this movement is made, the 47th regiment keeps its ground, and is to defend it to the last against any attack from the other side of the water; and the four companies that cover the head-quarters are to take post in the redoubt above the bridge that leads to head-quarters.</P>
<P>In case of any movement from this side of Hudson's river, Ma∣jor-general Reidesel, will form the left wing of the army, at the head of their incampment, but not march off their ground. The quarter∣masters
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>
and camp-colour-men of the left wing are to mark out their ground to-morrow morning; but that wing is not to pass the river till the last of the depôt has crossed the bridge: for the expediting which purpose all the departments concerned are to use their utmost diligence.</P>

<P>DURING the next march of the army the corps are to move in such a state, as to be fit for instant action. It is therefore unavoidably necessary to circumspect, more than is at present done, brigade conveyances, in regard to attendance upon baggage, cattle, and other inferior purposes.</P>
<P>The brigadiers will collect to-morrow from the commanding-officers of corps under their command a report of the number of rank and file each corps can march, and how the rest are disposed of.</P>
<P>It is to be a standing order for the rest of the campaign, that all picquets and guards are to be under arms an hour before day-light every morning, and so continue till it is quite light. All out-posts and out-lying picquets to send patroles at the same time.</P>

<P>TO the great reproach of discipline, of the common sense of sol∣diers who have been made prisoners, the service has sustained a loss within these few days, that might have cost some hundreds of the enemy to have brought on in action. The Lieutenant-general will no longer bear to lose men for the pitiful consideration of pota∣toes or forage. The soldier is the property of the king, and since friendly admonitions, repeated injunctions, and corporal punishment will have no effect, the army is now to be informed, and it is not doubted the commanding-officers will do it solemnly, that the first
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
soldier caught beyond the advanced sentries of the army will be in∣stantly hanged.</P>
<P>In case of an action, the Lieutenant-general will be found near the British line, or he will leave word there where he may be followed; and a subaltern-officer is to be sent from each of the following corps, viz. one from the British line, one from Brigadier-general Fraser's corps, and one who speaks French from the left wing. These officers to be on horseback.</P>

<P>AS parties are to be employed to-day in making roads in order to advance towards the enemy, it is the general's orders that the several corps incamp on their present ground immediately.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant-general, having had an opportunity of observing the conduct of the troops on all parts in the action of the 19th in∣stant, thinks it incumbent on him to give his public testimony of the exemplary spirit of the officers in general, and in many instances of the private men. In both these distinctions the artillery is to be in∣cluded; and the brigade under Captain Jones deserves a peculiar place. His warmest thanks to Major-general Philips, cannot be omitted on any occasion, when, added to the service of the department under his immediate inspection, he finds himself under great obligation for a most able and zealous second in command.</P>
<P>The zeal and spirit of Major-general Reidesel also deserves the Lieutenant-general's acknowledgement. The regular fire given by the troops he brought up, and the good countenance of the Germans, were fully noticed.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="25"/>
Brigadier-general Fraser took his position at the beginning of the day with great judgment, and sustained the action with his usual pre∣sence of mind and vigour.</P>
<P>Brigadier-general Hamilton, acquitted himself honourably by his activity and conduct, during an action of several hours.</P>
<P>Amidst these several actions of applause, the impetuosity and uncer∣tain aim of the British troops in giving their fire, and the mistake they are still under of preferring it to the bayonet, is much to be lamented. The Lieutenant-general is persuaded this error will be corrected in the next engagement, upon the conviction of their own reason and re∣flexion, as well as upon that general precept of discipline, never to fire but by order of an officer.</P>
<P>One hundred and twenty brave men of courage and fidelity, from the provincial corps of Jessup, Peters, M<SUP>c</SUP>Alpin and M<SUP>c</SUP>Kay, are to be incorporated, for this campaign only, into the six British regiments, in the proportion of twenty to a regiment. They will have a certifi∣cate from under the hand of the Lieutenant-general, to intitle them to a discharge on the 25th day of December next. They will besides receive a gratuity on being incorporated, and another at the expiration of their service: and these will be the whole number required this campaign. Those corps, whose establishment is to take place on a certain number of men being raised, are allowed to recommend those furnished upon this occasion as part of that number.</P>

<P>THE Lieutenant-general has received intelligence of an attempt made by the enemy on Ticonderoga, in which they have mis∣carried and retired; but have made prisoners some part of the 53d regiment posted on the carrying-place of Lake George. Till circum∣stances are more authentically known, it will be an act of injustice to accuse any officer of so great a fault as suffering a surprise; but the occasion cannot be overlooked of repeating to officers in general the necessity of vigilance and unremitting alertness on their posts, and of warning them, that no distance of the enemy, or situation of the ground, is security or excuse, if they are off their guard.</P>
