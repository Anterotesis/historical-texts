<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I Have repeatedly assured the Public, that they shall be faithfully acquainted from whence I borrow any Materials to work up my Dramatic Trifles. In the METAMORPHOSES will be found some incidents taken from Moliere's <HI>Sicilien,</HI> par∣ticularly the circumstances of Don Pedro's giving away his ward in a mistake, which is here ex∣actly as it is in the French.</P>
<P>THE Servant who from simplicity betrays his Master's secrets will be directly known, for a chacter in <HI>George Dandin.</HI> In short what is taken from these two Comedies, together with hints from some other Publications make near a third of the Piece.</P>
<P>THUS have I faithfully performed my promise to the Public, whose kind Protection I should very little merit could I deceive them.</P>

<P>Oh, Fabio, I was glad to hear the sound of your sweet voice—Ha, ha, ha, what a figure you cut!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! what you are looking at my ap∣pearance; 'tis whimsical enough, to be sure, for a man of my consequence. Who would think now, that I was valet, companion, and confidant to Lysander; the most hopeful and wealthy heir in all Seville; and lover, servant, and most humble slave to the accomplish'd Juletta, gentle∣woman, duenna, and adviser of Donna Mar∣cella, the ward of Don Pedro de Castro.</P>

<P>She is only his ward at present, to be sure; but if your master does not make great haste, they will be man and wife within these two hours.</P>

<P>Did you hear, Sir, the pretty news that Mrs. Juletta has brought; your mistress is going to marry her old dragon of a guardian.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Lys.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis impossible!—She could not consent to such a thing.</P>

<P>Why, it cost her a great many tears to be sure; but at last, Sir, I seconded his request, and then she complied.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you ungrateful, mischievous—I don't know what to call you—have you a top∣knot, a ruff, or a ruffle, that you don't owe to my master's generosity?

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Sir—go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, because his happiness was dearer to me than my own, have not I, to forward the business, condescended to cast the eyes of affection upon you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Intolerable assurance!—'tis I, Jackanapes, 'tis I that am abused.—Did not I see a poor, un∣fortunate couple, moping in distress? Did not I, for the consideration of a few trifling presents, suffer myself to be prevailed upon to extricate them from it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Ma'am—go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did not I, because I wou'd not see you expire before my face, take pity on you, and give you my virgin heart, while thousands vainly tried to tear me from you? And what is my re∣ward for all this? Why, truly, when I have persuaded my mistress seemingly to consent to
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
marry her guardian, in order to get her fortune into her own possession, that she may the easier run away with the man she loves—</P>

<P>Well, I have sent away the lawyers; but, methinks, since the deeds were executed, you don't shew so much willingness as you did before.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis because you are so unwilling to con∣fide in me: I am not allow'd to take any manner of liberty; and at the very time I yield myself entirely to you, such is your suspicious temper, that I am obliged to keep a guard upon all my words and actions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don. <HI>P.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Marcella, 'tis because my love is so very delicate I take offence at even a smile, or a glance, that any person forces from you; and the care you see me take, is for nothing else but to debar all access of galants, and secure to myself the possession of a heart, the least thing relative to which I can't bear to think any body should rob me of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>In good truth you take a very wrong method, and the possession of a heart is very ill secured, when people think to keep it up by force. For my part, was I gallant to a lady in the power of another, I shou'd bend all my
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
study to make him jealous. For the way to for∣ward such affairs, is to take every advantage of the uneasiness and resentments which constraint and servitude create in the mind of a woman.</P>

<P>Well, Sir, I came to ask your advice up∣on a point of honour—This way, if you please, that nobody may hear us. <STAGE>[<HI>While</HI> Fabio <HI>draws</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="31"/> <HI>off Don</HI> Pedro, Lysander <HI>slips into the house.</HI>]</STAGE> You must know, Sir, that I have receiv'd a slap on the face; I suppose, Sir, you know what a slap on the face is, when it is given with an open hand in the middle of the cheek—Now, Sir, this slap o'the face sticks mightily in my stomach, and I am in doubt whether to revenge the affront, I ought to fight my man or have him assassinated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don <HI>P.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Assassination is the surest and shortest way.</P>

<L>Great Hercules, we've heard, was a slave to Omphale,</L>

<P>Upon my word, Sir, she's not in this house.</P>

<P>Madam, I shou'd not have been guilty of such an indecorum, as to press in here so abruptly, if I had not had the evidence of my own senses in my vindication.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, I do assure you, the person you seek for is not here, and I cannot any longer re∣frain from telling you, that your presence gives me great uneasiness—for if my guardian was to see you, I don't know what the consequence might be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don <HI>P.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Is all of this real, I wonder, or only hatch'd up—there can be no harm at least in send∣ing him out of the house.—Who are you, and what's your business here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lys.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I came to search for my wife, who has escaped from my just indignation, and fled into your house for shelter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don. <HI>P.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do assure you, Sir, if I could pre∣vail upon myself to credit you, I don't know any thing I should sooner do than assist you; but as I have a way of disbelieving what most people tell me, and you among the rest, I shou'd take it as a favour if you would suffer me to conduct you to the street-door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lys.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, this is very cavalier treatment; but since that lady has assured me that my wife is not in your house, I shall take my leave—Nay, Sir, you need not give yourself the trouble to see me down.</P>

<P>Well, upon second thoughts, I'll stay where I am—Within there—somebody shew the gentleman out.—Well, Madam, what do you say to all this?—I suppose I have no reason yet to be jealous—the sailors, the ballad-singers, the friars, the gentleman of honour, and above all, this smooth-spoken Sir, are none of them objects of jealousy!—but, however, in ten minutes I expect the priest, and then I shall have a privilege, if persuasion won't do it, to keep you from rebel∣lion, by confinement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You give me a good sample of what kind of life you expect me to lead—but, Sir, I despise your suspicions, and if it was not that I have given my word, nothing should compel me to marry you.</P>

<P>Oh! good Sir, save me from a furious husband, who pursues me; his jealousy is incredi∣ble, and works him up to an excess beyond ima∣gination; he goes so far, as to insist upon my always going veil'd, and because he caught me with my face a little uncover'd, he snatch'd up his sword, and would have kill'd me, Sir, if I had not flown to your house for protection.</P>

<P>Good Sir, be a little patient, the of∣fence is too small for such violent anger.</P>

<P>How, Sir! do you take her part? You, who are so delicate upon these sort of things.</P>

<P>No, Sir, I don't take her part; but if you could be friends with her it would be a cha∣rity, for the poor creature seeems frightened out of her senses.</P>
