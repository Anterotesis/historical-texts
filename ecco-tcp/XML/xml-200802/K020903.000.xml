<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY inscribing this slight performance to you, I do not mean so much to compliment you as myself. It may do me some honour to inform the public, that I have lived many years in in∣timacy with you. It may serve the interests of mankind also to inform them, that the greatest wit may be found in a character, without im∣pairing the most unaffected piety.</P>
<P>I have, particularly, reason to thank you for your partiality to this performance. The un∣dertaking a comedy, not merely sentimental, was very dangerous; and Mr. Colman, who saw this piece in its various stages, always thought it so. However I ventured to trust it to the public; and though it was necessarily de∣layed till late in the season, I have every reason to be grateful.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Dear Sir, Your most sincere friend, And admirer, OLIVER GOLDSMITH.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GARRICK, Esq.</BYLINE>
<STAGE>Enter Mr. <HI>WOODWARD,</HI> Dressed in Black, and holding a Handkerchief to his Eyes.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L><HI>EXCUSE</HI> me, Sirs, I pray—I can't yet speak—</L>
<L>I'm crying now—and have been all the week!</L>
<L><HI>'Tis not alone this mourning suit,</HI> good masters;</L>
<L><HI>I've that within—</HI>for which there are no plaisters!</L>
<L>Pray wou'd you know the reason why I'm crying?</L>
<L>The Comic muse, long sick, is now a dying!</L>
<L>And if she goes, my tears will never stop;</L>
<L>For as a play'r, I can't squeeze out one drop:</L>
<L>I am undone, that's all—shall lose my bread—</L>
<L>I'd rather, but that's nothing—lose my head.</L>
<L>When the sweet maid is laid upon the bier,</L>
<L><HI>Shuter</HI> and <HI>I</HI> shall be chief mourners here.</L>
<L>To her a mawkish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of spurious breed,</L>
<L>Who deals in s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tals will succeed!</L>
<L>Poor <HI>Ned</HI> and <HI>I</HI> are dead to all intents,</L>
<L>We can as soon speak <HI>Greek</HI> as <HI>sentiments!</HI></L>
<L>Both nervous grown, to keep our spirits up,</L>
<L>We now and then take down a hearty cup.</L>
<L>What shall we do?—If Comedy forsake us!</L>
<L>They'll turn us out, and no one else will take us,</L>
<L>But why can't I be moral?—Let me try—</L>
<L>My heart thus pressing—fix'd my face and eye—</L>
<L>With a sententious look, that nothing means,</L>
<L>(Faces are blocks, in sentimental scenes)</L>
<L>Thus I begin<HI>—All is not gold that glitters,</HI></L>
<L>Pleasure seems sweet, but proves a glass of bitters.</L>
<L>When ign'rance enters, folly is at hand;</L>
<L>Learning is better far than house and land:</L>
<L>Let not your virtue trip, who trips may stumble,</L>
<L>And virtue is not virtue, if she tumble.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I give it up—morals won't do for me;</L>
<L>To make you laugh I must play tragedy.</L>
<L>One hope remains—hearing the maid was ill,</L>
<L>A <HI>doctor</HI> comes this night to shew his skill.</L>
<L>To cheer her heart, and give your muscles motion,</L>
<L>He in <HI>five draughts</HI> prepar'd, presents a potion:</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>
A kind of magic charm—for be assur'd,</L>
<L>If y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> swallow it, the maid is cur'd:</L>
<L>But d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>te the Doctor, and her case is,</L>
<L>If you reject the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, and make wry faces!</L>
<L>This truth he boasts, will beast it while he lives,</L>
<L>No <HI>pois'nous drugs</HI> are mix'd in what he gives;</L>
<L>Should he succeed, you'll give him his degree;</L>
<L>If not, within he will receive no fee!</L>

<L>Pronounce him <HI>regular,</HI> or dub him <HI>quack.</HI></L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Dr. GOLDSMITH.</BYLINE>
<L><HI>WELL,</HI> having stoop'd to conquer with success,</L>
<L>And gain'd a husband without aid from dress,</L>
<L>Still as a Bar-maid, I could wish it too,</L>
<L>As I have conquer'd him to conquer you:</L>
<L>And let me say, for all your resolution,</L>
<L>That pretty Bar-maids have done execution.</L>
<L>Our life is all a play, compos'd to please,</L>
<L>"We have our exits and our entrances."</L>
<L>The first act shews the simple country maid,</L>
<L>Harmless and young, of ev'ry thing asraid;</L>
<L>Blushes when hir'd, and with unmeaning action,</L>
<L>I hopes as how to give you satisfaction.</L>
<L>Her second act displays a livelier scene,—</L>
<L>Th' unblushing Bar-maid of a country inn.</L>
<L>Who whisks about the house, at market caters,</L>
<L>Talks loud, coquets the guests, and scolds the waiters.</L>
<L>Next the scene shifts to town, and there she soars,</L>
<L>The chop house toast of ogling connoissieurs.</L>
<L>On 'Squires and Cits she there displays her arts,</L>
<L>And on the gridiron broils her lover's hearts—</L>
<L>And as she smiles, her triumphs to compleat,</L>
<L>Even Common Councilmen forget to eat.</L>
<L>The fourth act shews her wedded to the 'Squire,</L>
<L>And Madam now begins to hold it higher;</L>
<L><PB REF="6"/>
Pretends to taste, at Operas cries <HI>caro,</HI></L>
<L>And quits her Nancy Dawson, for <HI>Che Faro.</HI></L>
<L>Doats upon dancing, and in all her pride,</L>
<L>Swims round the room, the <HI>Heinel</HI> of Cheapside:</L>
<L>Ogles and leers with artificial skill,</L>
<L>Till having lost in age the power to kill,</L>
<L>She sits all night at cards, and ogles at spadille.</L>
<L>Such, thro' our lives, the eventful history—</L>
<L>The fifth and last act still remains for me.</L>
<L>The Bar-maid now for your protection prays,</L>
<L>Turns Female Barrister, and leads for Bayes.</L>

<STAGE>SCENE, <HI>A</HI> CHAMBER <HI>in an old fashioned</HI> HOUSE. <HI>Enter</HI> Mrs. HARDCASTLE <HI>and</HI> Mr. HARDCASTLE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Vow, Mr. Hardcastle, you're very particular. Is there a creature in the whole country, but our∣selves, that does not take a trip to town now and then, to rub off the rust a little? There's the two Miss Hoggs, and our neighbour, Mrs. Grigsby, go to take a month's polishing every winter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and bring back vanity and affectation to last them the whole year. I wonder why London cannot keep its own fools at home. In my time, the follies of the town crept slowly among us, but now they travel faster than a stage-coach. Its fopperies come down, not only as inside passengers, but in the very basket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, <HI>your</HI> times were fine times, indeed; you have been telling us of <HI>them</HI> for many a long year. Here we live in an old rumbling mansion, that looks for all the world like an inn, but that we never see compa∣ny. Our best visitors are old Mrs. Oddfish, the cu∣rate's wife, and little Cripplegate, the lame danc∣ing-master: And all our entertainment your old stories of Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough. I hate such old-fashioned trumpery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I love it. I love every thing that's old: old friends, old times, old manners, old books, old wine; and, I believe, Dorothy, <STAGE>(taking her hand)</STAGE> you'll own I have been pretty fond of an old wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Mr. Hardcastle, you're for ever at your Dorothy's and your old wife's. You may be a Dar∣by, but I'll be no Joan, I promise you. I'm not so old as you'd make me, by more than one good year. Add twenty to twenty, and make money of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me see; twenty added to twenty, makes just fifty and seven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's false, Mr. Hardcastle: I was but twenty when I was brought to bed of Tony, that I had by Mr. Lumpkin, my first husband; and he's not come to years of discretion yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor ever will, I dare answer for him. Ay, you have taught <HI>him</HI> finely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter, Tony Lumpkin has a good fortune. My son is not to live by his learning. I don't think a boy wants much learning to spend fifteen hundred a year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Learning, quotha! A mere composition of tricks and mischief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humour, my dear: nothing but humour. Come, Mr. Hardcastle, you must allow the boy a little humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'd sooner allow him an horse-pond. If burning the footmens shoes, frighting the maids, and worry∣ing the kittens, be humour, he has it. It was but yesterday he fastened my wig to the back of my chair, and when I went to make a bow, I popt my bald head in Mrs. Frizzle's face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And am I to blame? The poor boy was always too sickly to do any good. A school would be his death. When he comes to be a little stronger, who knows what a year or two's Latin may do for him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Latin for him! A cat and fiddle. No, no, the ale-house and the stable are the only schools he'll ever go to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, we must not snub the poor boy now, for I believe we shan't have him long among us. Any body that looks in his face may see he's consumptive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, if growing too fat be one of the symptoms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He coughs sometimes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, when his liquor goes the wrong way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm actually afraid of his lungs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And truly so am I; for he sometimes whoops like
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
a speaking trumpet— <STAGE>(Tony hallooing behind the Scenes)</STAGE>—O there he goes—A very consumptive figure, truly.</P>

<P>I'm in haste, mother, I cannot stay.</P>

<P>Ay; the ale-house, the old place: I thought so.</P>

<P>A low, paltry set of fellows.</P>

<P>Not so low neither. There's Dick Muggins the exciseman, Jack Slang the horse doctor, Little Ami∣nadab that grinds the music box, and Tom Twist that spins the pewter platter.</P>

<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, there goes a pair that only spoil each other, But is not the whole age in a combination to drive sense and discretion out of doors? There's my pretty darling Kate; the fashions of the times have almost infected her too. By living a year or two in town, she is as fond of gauze, and French frippery, as the best of them.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> MISS HARDCASTLE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blessings on my pretty innocence! Drest out as usual my Kate. Goodness! What a quantity of su∣perfluous silk has thou got about thee, girl! I could never teach the fools of this age, that the indigent world could be cloathed out of the trimmings of the vain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know our agreement, Sir. You allow me the morning to receive and pay visits, and to dress in my own manner; and in the evening, I put on my housewife's dress to please you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, remember I insist on the terms of our agree∣ment; and, by the bye, I believe I shall have occa∣sion to try your obedience this very evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I protest, Sir, I don't comprehend your meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, to be plain with you, Kate, I expect the
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
young gentleman I have chosen to be your husband from town this very day. I have his father's letter, in which he informs me his son is set out, and that he intends to follow himself shortly after.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! I wish I had known something of this be∣fore. Bless me, how shall I behave? It's a thousand to one I shan't like him; our meeting will be so for∣mal, and so like a thing of business, that I shall find no room for friendship or esteem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon it, child, I'll never controul your choice; but Mr. Marlow, whom I have pitched upon, is the son of my old friend, Sir Charles Mar∣low, of whom you have heard me talk so often. The young gentleman has been bred a scholar, and is designed for an employment in the service of his country. I am told he's a man of an excellent un∣derstanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very generous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I shall like him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Young and brave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sure I shall like him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And very handsome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Papa, say no more <STAGE>(kissing his hand)</STAGE> he's mine, I'll have him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to crown all, Kate, he's one of the most bashful and reserved young fellows in all the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh! you have frozen me to death again. That word reserved, has undone all the rest of his accom∣plishments. A reserved lover, it is said, always makes a suspicious husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the contrary, modesty seldom resides in a breast that is not enriched with nobler virtues. It was the very feature in his character that first struck me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He must have more striking features to catch me, I promise you. However, if he be so young, so handsome, and so every thing, as you mention, I be∣lieve he'll do still. I think I'll have him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Kate, but there is still an obstacle. Its more than an even wager, he may not have <HI>you.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Papa, why will you mortify one so?—Well, if he refuses, instead of breaking my heart at his indifference, I'll only break my glass for its flattery. Set my cap to some newer fashion, and look out for some less difficult admirer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravely resolved! In the mean time I'll go prepare the servants for his reception; as we seldom see com∣pany they want as much training as a company of re∣cruits, the first day's muster.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exit</STAGE>
<STAGE>Miss HARDCASTLE, <HI>Sola.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lud, this news of Papa's, puts me all in a slutter. Young, handsome; these he put last; but I put them foremost. Sensible, good-natured; I like all that. But then reserved, and sheepish, that's much against him. Yet can't he be cured of his timidity, by being taught to be proud of his wife? Yes, and can't I—But I vow I'm disposing of the husband, before I have secured the lover.</P>

<STAGE><PB REF="14"/><HI>Enter</HI> Miss NEVILLE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm glad you're come, Neville, my dear. Tell me, Constance, how do I look this evening? Is there any thing whimsical about me? Is it one of my well looking days, child? Am I in face to day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly, my dear. Yet now I look again—bless me!—sure no accident has happened among the ca∣nary birds or the gold fishes. Has your brother or the cat been meddling? Or has the last novel been too moving?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; nothing of all this. I have been threatened—I can scarce get it out—I have been threatened with a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And his name—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is Marlow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The son of Sir Charles Marlow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I live, the most intimate friend of Mr. Hastings, <HI>my</HI> admirer. They are never asunder. I believe you must have seen him when we lived in town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's a very singular character, I assure you. Among women of reputation and virtue, he is the modestest man alive; but his acquaintance give him a very different character among creatures of another stamp: you understand me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An odd character, indeed. I shall never be able
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
to manage him. What shall I do? Pshaw, think no more of him, but trust to occurrences for suc∣cess. But how goes on your own affair my dear, has my mother been courting you for my brother Tony, as usual?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have just come from one of our agreeable tête a-têtes. She has been saying a hundred tender things, and setting off her pretty monster as the very pink of perfection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And her partiality is such, that she actually thinks him so. A fortune like your's is no small tempta∣tion. Besides, as she has the sole management of it, I'm not surprized to see her unwilling to let it go out of the family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fortune like mine, which chiefly consists in jewels, is no such mighty temptation. But at any rate if my dear Hastings be but constant, I make no doubt to be too hard for her at last. However, I let her suppose that I am in love with her son, and she never once dreams that my affections are fixed upon another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good brother holds out stoutly. I could al∣most love him for hating you so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a good natured creature at bottom, and I'm sure would wish to see me married to any body but himself. But my aunt's bell rings for our after∣noon's walk round the improvements. Allons. Cou∣rage is necessary as our affairs are critical.</P>

<P>I like the maxum of it, Master Muggins. What, tho' I am obligated to dance a bear, a man may be a gentleman for all that. May this be my poison if my bear ever dances but to the very gen∣teelest of tunes. Water Parted, or the minuet in Ariadne.</P>

<P>O he takes after his own father for that. To be sure old 'Squire Lumpkin was the finest gentleman I ever set my eyes on. For winding the streight horn, or beating a thicket for a hare, or a wench he never had his fellow. It was a saying in

the place, that he kept the best horses, dogs and girls in the whole county.</P>

<P>Ecod, and when I'm of age I'll be no bastard I promise you. I have been thinking of Bett Boun∣cer and the miller's grey mare to begin with. But come, my boys, drink about and be merry, for you pay no reckoning. Well Stingo, what's the matter?</P>

<P>Father-in-law has been calling me whelp, and hound, this half year. Now if I pleased, I could be so revenged upon the old grumbletonian. But then I'm afraid—afraid of what! I shall soon be worth fifteen hundred a year, and let him frighten me out of <HI>that</HI> if he can.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a tedious uncomfortable day have we had of

it! We were told it was but forty miles across the country, and we have come above threescore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And all Marlow, from that unaccountable reserve of yours, that would not let us enquire more fre∣quently on the way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own, Hastings, I am unwilling to lay myself un∣der an obligation to every one I meet; and often, stand the chance of an unmannerly answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>At present, however, we are not likely to receive any answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No offence, gentlemen. But I'm told you have been enquiring for one Mr. Hardcastle, in those parts. Do you know what part of the country you are in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least Sir, but should thank you for in∣formation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor the way you came?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; but if you can inform us—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, gentlemen, if you know neither the road you are going, nor where you are, nor the road you came, the first thing I have to inform you is, that—You have lost your way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>We wanted no ghost to tell us that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, gentlemen, may I be so bold as to ask the place from whence you came?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's not necessary towards directing us where we are to go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No offence; but question for question is all fair,
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
you know. Pray, gentlemen, is not this same Hard∣castle a cross-grain'd, old-fashion'd, whimsical fel∣low, with an ugly face; a daughter, and a pretty son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have not seen the gentleman, but he has the family you mention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The daughter, a tall trapesing, trolloping, talka∣tive maypole—The son, a pretty, well-bred, agree∣able youth, that every body is fond of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our information differs in this. The daughter is said to be well-bred and beautiful; the son, an auk∣ward booby, reared up, and spoiled at his mother's apron-string.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He-he-hem—Then, gentlemen, all I have to tell you is, that you won't reach Mr. Hardcastle's house this night, I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unfortunate!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's a damn'd long, dark, boggy, dirty, dangerous way. Stingo, tell the gentlemen the way to Mr. Hardcastle's; <STAGE>(winking upon the Landlord)</STAGE> Mr. Hardcastle's, of Quagmire Marsh, you understand me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LANDLORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Master Hardcastle's! Lock-a-daisy, my masters, you're come a deadly deal wrong! When you came to the bottom of the hill, you should have cross'd down Squash-lane.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cross down Squash-lane!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LANDLORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you were to keep streight forward, 'till you came to four roads.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come to where four roads meet!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; but you must be sure to take only one of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir, you're facetious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then keeping to the right, you are to go side-ways till you come upon Crack-skull common: there you must look sharp for the track of the wheel, and go forward, 'till you come to farmer Murrain's barn. Coming to the farmer's barn, you are to turn to the right, and then to the left, and then to the right about again, till you find out the old mill—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds, man! we could as soon find out the lon∣gitude!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's to be done, Marlow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>This house promises but a poor reception; though perhaps the Landlord can accommodate us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LANDLORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alack, master, we have but one spare bed in the whole house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to my knowledge, that's taken up by three lodgers already. <STAGE>(after a pause, in which the rest seem disconcerted)</STAGE> I have hit it. Don't you think, Stingo, our landlady could accommodate the gentlemen by the fire-side, with—three chairs and a bolster?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hate sleeping by the fire-side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I detest your three chairs and a bolster.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do, do you?—then let me see—what—if you go on a mile further, to the Buck's Head; the old Buck's Head on the hill, one of the best inns in the whole county?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>O ho! so we have escaped an adventure for this night, however.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LANDLORD.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Apart to Tony)</STAGE>
<P>Sure, you ben't sending them to your father's as an inn, be you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mum, you fool you. Let <HI>them</HI> find that out. <STAGE>(to them)</STAGE> You have only to keep on streight forward, till you come to a large old house by the road side. You'll see a pair of large horns over the door. That's the sign. Drive up the yard, and call stoutly about you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, we are obliged to you. The servants can't miss the way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no: But I tell you though, the landlord is rich, and going to leave off business; so he wants to be thought a Gentleman, saving your presence, he! he! he! He'll be for giving you his company, and ecod if you mind him, he'll persuade you that his mother was an alderman, and his aunt a justice of peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LANDLORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>A troublesome old blade to be sure; but a keeps as good wines and beds as any in the whole country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if he supplies us with these, we shall want no further connexion. We are to turn to the right, did you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; streight forward. I'll just step myself, and shew you a piece of the way. <STAGE>(to the landlord)</STAGE> Mum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LANDLORD.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, I hope you're perfect in the table exer∣cise I have been teaching you these three days. You all know your posts and your places, and can shew that you have been used to good company, with∣out ever stirring from home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OMNES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>When company comes, you are not to pop out and stare, and then run in again, like frighted rab∣bits in a warren.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OMNES.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You, Diggory, whom I have taken from the barn, are to make a shew at the side-table; and you, Ro∣ger, whom I have advanced from the plough, are to place yourself behind <HI>my</HI> chair. But you're not to stand so, with your hands in your pockets. Take your hands from your pockets, Roger; and from your head, you blockhead you. See how Diggory carries his hands. They're a little too stiff, indeed, but that's no great matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIGGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, mind how I hold them. I learned to hold my hands this way, when I was upon drill for the mili∣tia. And so being upon drill—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must not be so talkative, Diggory. You must be all attention to the guests. You must hear us talk,
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
and not think of talking; you must see us drink, and not think of drinking; you must see us eat, and not think of eating.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIGGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the laws, your worship, that's parfectly unpos∣sible. Whenever Diggory sees yeating going forward, ecod he's always wishing for a mouthful himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blockhead! Is not a belly-full in the kitchen as good as a belly-full in the parlour? Stay your stomach with that reflection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIGGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ecod I thank your worship, I'll make a shift to stay my stomach with a slice of cold beef in the pantry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Diggory, you are too talkative. Then if I happen to say a good thing, or tell a good story at table, you must not all burst out a-laughing, as if you made part of the company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIGGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then ecod your worship must not tell the story of Ould Grouse in the gun-room: I can't help laughing at that—he! he! he!—for the soul of me. We have laughed at that these twenty years—ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! The story is a good one. Well, honest Diggory, you may laugh at that—but still re∣member to be attentive. Suppose one of the company should call for a glass of wine, how will you behave? A glass of wine, Sir, if you please <STAGE>(to Diggory)</STAGE>—Eh, why don't you move?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIGGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ecod, your worship, I never have courage till I see the eatables and drinkables brought upo' the table, and then I'm as bauld as a lion.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERVANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Welcome, gentlemen, very welcome. This way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>After the disappointments of the day, welcome once more, Charles, to the comforts of a clean room and a good fire. Upon my word, a very well-looking house; antique, but creditable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>The usual fate of a large mansion. Having first ruined the master by good housekeeping, it at last comes to levy contributions as an inn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you say, we passengers are to be taxed to pay all these fineries. I have often seen a good sideboard, or a marble chimney-piece, tho' not actually put in the bill, enflame a reckoning confoundedly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Travellers, George, must pay in all places. The only difference is, that in good inns, you pay dearly for luxuries; in bad inns, you are fleeced and starved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have lived pretty much among them. In truth, I have been often surprized, that you who have seen so much of the world, with your natural good sense, and your many opportunities, could never yet acquire a requisite share of assurance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Englishman's malady. But tell me, George, where could I have learned that assurance you talk of? My life has been chiefly spent in a college, or an inn, in seclusion from that lovely part of the creation that chiefly teach men confidence. I don't know that I was ever familiarly acquainted with a single modest woman—except my mother—But among fe∣males of another class you know—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, among them you are impudent enough of all conscience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are of <HI>us</HI> you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But in the company of women of reputation I never saw such an ideot, such a trembler; you look for all the world as if you wanted an opportunity of stealing out of the room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why man that's because I <HI>do</HI> want to steal out of the room. Faith, I have often formed
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
a resolution to break the ice, and rattle away at any rate. But I don't know how, a single glance from a pair of fine eyes has totally overset my reso∣lution. An impudent fellow may counterfeit mo∣desty, but I'll be hanged if a modest man can ever counterfeit impudence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you could but say half the fine things to them that I have heard you lavish upon the bar-maid of an inn, or even a college bed maker—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, George, I can't say fine things to them, They freeze, they petrify me. They may talk of a comet, or a burning mountain, or some such baga∣telle. But to me, a modest woman, drest out in all her finery, is the most tremendous object of the whole creation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! At this rate, man, how can you ever expect to marry!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never, unless as among kings and princes, my bride were to be courted by proxy. If, indeed, like an Eastern bridegroom, one were to be introduced to a wife he never saw before, it might be endured. But to go through all the terrors of a formal court∣ship, together with the episode of aunts, grand∣mothers and cousins, and at last to blurt out the broad staring question, of, <HI>madam will you marry me?</HI> No, no, that's strain much above me I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pity you. But how do you intend behaving to the lady you are come down to visit at the request of your father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I behave to all other ladies. Bow very low. Answer yes, or no, to all her demands—But for
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
the rest, I don't think I shall venture to look in her face, till I see my father's again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm surprized that one who is so warm a friend can be so cool a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be explicit, my dear Hastings, my chief in∣ducement down was to be instrumental in forwarding your happiness, not my own. Miss Neville loves you, the family don't know you, as my friend you are sure of a reception, and let honour do the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Marlow! But I'll suppress the emotion. Were I a wretch, meanly seeking to carry off a for∣tune, you should be the last man in the world I would apply to for assistance. But Miss Neville's person is all I ask, and that is mine, both from her deceased father's consent, and her own inclination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Happy man! You have talents and art to capti∣vate any woman. I'm doom'd to adore the sex, and yet to converse with the only part of it I despise. This stammer in my address, and this aukward pre∣possessing visage of mine, can never permit me to soar above the reach of a milliner's 'prentice, or one of the dutchesses of Drury-lane. Pshaw! this fellow here to interrupt us.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> HARDCASTLE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen, once more you are heartily welcome. Which is Mr. Marlow? Sir, you're heartily welcome. It's not my way, you see, to receive my friends with my back to the fire. I like to give them a hearty reception in the old stile at my gate. I like to see their horses and trunks taken care of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(aside)</STAGE>
<P>He has got our names from the servants already.
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
<STAGE>(To Him)</STAGE> We approve your caution and hospitality, Sir. <STAGE>(To Hastings)</STAGE> I have been thinking, George, of changing our travelling dresses in the morning. I am grown confoundedly ashamed of mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg, Mr. Marlow, you'll use no ceremony in this house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy, George, you're right: the first blow is half the battle. I intend opening the campaign with the white and gold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Marlow—Mr. Hastings—gentlemen—pray be under no constraint in this house. This is Liberty-hall, gentlemen. You may do just as you please here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, George, if we open the campaign too fierce∣ly at first, we may want ammunition before it is over. I think to reserve the embroidery to secure a retreat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your talking of a retreat, Mr. Marlow, puts me in mind of the Duke of Marlborough, when we went to besiege Denain. He first summoned the garrison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you think the <HI>ventre dor</HI> waistcoat will do with the plain brown?</P>
</SP>

<P>What, my good friend, if you gave us a glass of punch in the mean time, it would help us to carry on the siege with vigour.</P>

<P>Punch, Sir! <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE> This is the most unaccounta∣ble kind of modesty I ever met with.</P>

<P>Yes, Sir, Punch. A glass of warm punch, after our journey, will be comfortable. This is Liberty-Hall, you know.</P>

<P>I hope you'll find it to your mind. I have prepared it with my own hands, and I believe you'll own the ingredients are tolerable. Will you, be so good as to pledge me, Sir? Here, Mr. Mar∣low, here is to our better acquaintance.</P>

<P>From the excellence of your cup, my old friend, I suppose you have a good deal of business in this part of the country. Warm work, now and then, at elections, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I have long given that work over. Since our betters have hit upon the expedient of electing each other, there's no business <HI>for us that sell ale.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, then you have no turn for politics I find.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least. There was a time, indeed, I fretted myself about the mistakes of government, like other people; but finding myself every day grow more angry, and the government growing no better, I left it to mend itself. Since that, I no more trouble my head about <HI>Heyder Ally,</HI> or <HI>Ally Cawn,</HI> than about <HI>Ally Croaker.</HI> Sir, my service to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>So that with eating above stairs, and drinking be∣low, with receiving your friends within, and amusing them without, you lead a good pleasant bustling life of it.</P>

<P>Instead of the battle of Belgrade. I believe it's almost time to talk about supper. What has your philosophy got in the house for fupper?</P>
</SP>

<P>For Supper, Sir! <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE> Was ever such a request to a man in his own house!</P>

<P>Yes, Sir, supper Sir; I begin to feel an appetite. I shall make devilish work to-night in the larder, I promise you.</P>

<P>You do, do you?</P>
</SP>

<P>Then I beg they'll admit <HI>me</HI> as one of their privy

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O no, Sir, none in the least; yet I don't know how: our Bridget, the cook maid, is not very com∣municative upon these occasions. Should we send for her, she might scold us all out of the house.</P>

<P>Sir, he's very right, and it's my way too.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you have a right to command here. Here, Roger, bring us the bill of fare for to night's sup∣per. I believe it's drawn out. Your manner, Mr. Hastings, puts me in mind of my uncle, Colonel Wallop. It was a saying of his, that no man was sure of his supper till he had eaten it.</P>

<STAGE>(Perusing)</STAGE>
<P>What's here? For the first course; for the second course; for the desert. The devil, Sir, do you think we have brought down the whole Joi∣ners Company, or the Corporation of Bedford, to eat up such a supper? Two or three little things, clean and comfortable, will do.</P>

<P>Why, really, Sir, your bill of fare is so exqui∣site, that any one part of it is full as good as ano∣ther. Send us what you please. So much for supper. And now to see that our beds are air'd, and properly taken care of.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Hastings! To what unexpected good fortune? to what accident am I to ascribe this hap∣py meeting?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rather let me ask the same question, as I could never have hoped to meet my dearest Constance at an inn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An inn! sure you mistake! my aunt, my guar∣dian, lives here. What could induce you to think this house an inn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>My friend Mr. Marlow, with whom I came down, and I, have been sent here as to an inn, I assure you. A young fellow whom we accidentally met at a house hard by directed us hither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly it must be one of my hopeful cousin's tricks, of whom you have heard me talk so often, ha! ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>He whom your aunt intends for you? He of whom I have such just apprehensions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have nothing to fear from him, I assure you. You'd adore him if you knew how heartily he despises me. My aunt knows it too, and has undertaken to court me for him, and actually be∣gins to think she has made a conquest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou dear dissembler! You must know, my Constance, I have just seized this happy opportu∣nity of my friend's visit here to get admittance into the family. The horses that carried us down are now fatigued with their journey, but they'll soon be refreshed; and then if my dearest girl will trust in her faithful Hastings, we shall soon be landed in France, where even among slaves the laws of mar∣riage are respected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often told you, that though ready to obey you, I yet should leave my little fortune behind with reluctance. The greatest part of it was left me by my uncle, the India Director, and chiefly consists in jewels. I have been for some time per∣suading my aunt to let me wear them. I fancy I'm very near succeeding. The instant they are put into my possession you shall find me ready to make them and myself yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perish the baubles! Your person is all I desire. In the meantime, my friend Marlow must not be let into his mistake. I know the strange reserve of his temper is such, that if abruptly informed of it, he would instantly quit the house before our plan was ripe for execution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how shall we keep him in the deception? Miss Hardcastle is just returned from walking; what if we still continue to deceive him?—This, this way—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>The assiduities of these good people teize me beyond bearing. My host seems to think it ill manners to leave me alone, and so he claps not only himself but his old-fashioned wife on my back. They talk of coming to sup with us too; and then, I suppose, we are to run the gauntlet thro' all the rest of the family.—What have we got here!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Charles! Let me congratulate you!—The most fortunate accident!—Who do you think is just alighted?</P>

<P>Cannot guess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our mistresses boy, Miss Hardcastle and Miss Neville. Give me leave to introduce Miss Con∣stance Neville to your acquaintance. Happening to dine in the neighbourhood, they called, on their return to take fresh horses, here. Miss Hardcastle has just stept into the next room, and will be back in an instant. Wasn't it lucky? eh!</P>

<P>Well! but wasn't it the most fortunate thing in the world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes. Very fortunate—a most joyful en∣counter—But our dresses, George, you know,
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
are in disorder—What if we should postpone the happiness 'till to-morrow?—To-morrow at her own house—It will be every bit as convenient—And rather more respectful—To-morrow let it be.</P>
<STAGE>[offering to go.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, Sir. Your ceremony will displease her. The disorder of your dress will shew the ar∣dour of your impatience. Besides, she knows you are in the house, and will permit you to see her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! the devil! how shall I support it? Hem! hem! Hastings, you must not go. You are to assist me, you know. I shall be confoundedly ridi∣culous. Yet, hang it! I'll take courage. Hem!</P>
</SP>

<P>Now, for meeting my modest gentleman with a demure face, and quite in his own manner. <STAGE>(After a pause, in which he appears very uneasy and dis∣concerted.)</STAGE> I'm glad of your safe arrival, Sir—I'm told you had some accidents by the way.</P>

<STAGE>(To him.)</STAGE>
<P>You never spoke better in your whole life. Keep it up, and I'll insure you the victory.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm afraid you flatter, Sir. You that have seen so much of the finest company can find little enter∣tainment in an obscure corner of the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Gathering courage.)</STAGE>
<P>I have lived, indeed, in the world, Madam; but I have kept very little com∣pany. I have been but an observer upon life, Ma∣dam, while others were enjoying it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that, I am told, is the way to enjoy it at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(To him.)</STAGE>
<P>Cicero never spoke better. Once more, and you are confirm'd in assurance for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(To him.)</STAGE>
<P>Hem! Stand by me then, and when I'm down, throw in a word or two to set me up again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An observer, like you, upon life, were, I fear, disagreeably employed, since you must have had much more to censure than to approve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, Madam. I was always willing to be amused. The folly of most people is rather an object of mirth than uneasiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(To him.)</STAGE>
<P>Bravo, Bravo. Never spoke so well in your whole life. Well! Miss Hardcastle, I see that you and Mr. Marlow are going to be very good company. I believe our being here will but embarrass the interview.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least, Mr. Hastings. We like your company of all things. <STAGE>(To him.)</STAGE> Zounds! George, sure you won't go? How can you leave us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our presence will but spoil conversation, so we'll retire to the next room. <STAGE>(To him)</STAGE> You don't consi∣der, man, that we are to manage a little tête-à-tête of our own.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exeunt.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(After a pause)</STAGE>
<P>But you have not been wholly an observer, I presume, Sir: The ladies I should hope have employed some part of your addresses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Relapsing into timidity)</STAGE>
<P>Pardon me, Madam, I—I—I—as yet have studied—only—to—deserve them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that some say is the very worst way to ob∣tain them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps so, madam. But I love to converse on∣ly with the more grave and sensible part of the sex.—But I'm afraid I grow tiresome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, Sir; there is nothing I like so much as grave conversation myself; I could hear it for ever. Indeed I have often been surprized how a
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
man of <HI>sentiment</HI> could ever admire those light airy pleasures, where nothing reaches the heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's—a disease—of the mind, madam. In the variety of tastes there must be some who want∣ing a relish—for—um—a—um.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you, Sir. There must be some, who wanting a relish for refined pleasures, pretend to despise what they are incapable of tasting.</P>

<STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE>
<P>Egad! and that's more than I do myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean that in this hypocritical age there are few that do not condemn in public what they prac∣tise

in private, and think they pay every debt to virtue when they praise it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, madam; those who have most virtue in their mouths, have least of it in their bosoms. But I'm sure I tire you, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least, Sir; there's something so agree∣able and spirited in your manner, such life and force—pray, Sir, go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, madam. I was saying—that there are some occasions—when a total want of courage, madam, destroys all the—and puts us—upon a—a—a—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you entirely, a want of courage upon some occasions assumes the appearance of ignorance, and betrays us when we most want to excel. I beg you'll proceed.</P>
</SP>

<P>Yes, madam. Morally speaking, madam—But I see Miss Neville expecting us in the next room. I would not intrude for the world.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! Sir, you're only pleased to say so. We Country persons can have no manner at all. I'm in love with the town, and that serves to raise me above some of our neighbouring rustics; but who can have a manner, that has never seen the Pan∣theon, the Grotto Gardens, the Borough, and such places where the Nobility chiefly resort? All I can do, is to enjoy London at second-hand. I take care to know every tête-à-tête from the Scandalous Ma∣gazine, and have all the fashions, as they come out, in a letter from the two Miss Rickets of Crooked∣lane. Pray how do you like this head, Mr. Hast∣ings?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Extremely elegant and degagée, upon my word, Madam. Your Friseur is a Frenchman, I suppose?</P>

<P>I protest I dressed it myself from a print in the Ladies Memorandum-book for the last year.</P>

<P>Yet, what signifies <HI>my</HI> dressing when I have such a piece of antiquity by my side as Mr. Hard∣castle: all I can say will never argue down a single button from his cloaths.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHAT could my old friend Sir Charles mean by recommending his son as the modestest young man in town? To me he appears the most impudent piece of brass that ever spoke with a tongue. He has taken possession of the easy chair by the fire-side already. He took off his boots in the parlour, and desired me to see them taken care of. I'm desirous to know how his impudence affects my daughter.—She will certainly be shocked at it.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Miss HARDCASTLE, plainly dress'd.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my Kate, I see you have changed your dress as I bid you; and yet, I believe, there was no great occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find such a pleasure, Sir, in obeying your com∣mands, that I take care to observe them without ever debating their propriety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Kate, I sometimes give you some cause, particularly when I recommended my <HI>modest</HI> gentleman to you as a lover to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You taught me to expect something extraordi∣nary, and I find the original exceeds the descrip∣tion.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was never so surprized in my life! He has quite confounded all my faculties!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never saw any thing like it: And a man of the world too!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, he learned it all abroad,—what a fool was I, to think a young man could learn modesty by travelling. He might as soon learn wit at a mas∣querade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems all natural to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A good deal assisted by bad company and a French dancing-master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure you mistake, papa! a French dancing-master could never have taught him that timid look,—that aukward address,—that bashful man∣ner—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whose look? whose manner? child!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Marlow's: his meanvaise Loute, his timidity struck me at the first sight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then your first sight deceived you; for I think him one of the most brazen first sights that ever astonished my senses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, Sir, you rally! I never saw any one so modest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you be serious! I never saw such a bouncing swaggering puppy since I was born. Bully Dawson was but a fool to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surprizing! He met me with a respectful bow, a stammering voice, and a look fixed on the ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He met me with a loud voice, a lordly air, and a familiarity that made my blood freeze again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He treated me with diffidence and respect; cen∣sured the manners of the age; admired the pru∣dence of girls that never laughed; tired me with apologies for being tiresome; then left the room with a bow, and, madam, I would not for the world detain you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He spoke to me as if he knew me all his life before. Asked twenty questions, and never waited for an answer. Interrupted my best remarks with some silly pun, and when I was in my best story of the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene, he asked if I had not a good hand at making punch. Yes, Kate, he ask'd your father if he was a maker of punch!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>One of us must certainly be mistaken.</P>

<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>In one thing then we are agreed—to reject him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. But upon conditions. For if you should find him less impudent, and I more presuming; if you find him more respectful, and I more importu∣nate—I don't know—the fellow is well enough for a man—Certainly we don't meet many such at a horse race in the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we should find him so—But that's impossible. The first appearance has done my business. I'm seldom deceived in that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet there may be many good qualities under that first appearance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, when a girl finds a fellow's outside to her taste, she then sets about guessing the rest of his furniture. With her, a smooth face stands for good sense, and a genteel figure for every virtue.</P>

<P>I hope, Sir, a conversation begun with a compli∣ment to my good sense won't end with a sneer at my understanding?</P>

<P>Pardon me, Kate. But if young Mr. Brazen can find the art of reconciling contradictions, he may please us both, perhaps.</P>

<P>And as one of us must be mistaken, what if we go to make further discoveries?</P>

<SPEAKER>MAID.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what is more, madam, the young gentleman as you passed by in your present dress, ask'd me if you were the bar maid? He mistook you for the bar maid, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he? Then as I live I'm resolved to keep up the delusion. Tell me, Pimple, how do you like my present dress. Don't you think I look some∣thing like Cherry in the Beaux Stratagem?</P>

<P>It's the dress, madam, that every lady wears in the country, but when she visits or receives company.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAID.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what do you hope from keeping him in his mistake?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place, I shall be <HI>seen,</HI> and that is no small advantage to a girl who brings her face to market. Then I shall perhaps make an acquaintance and that's no small victory gained over one who ne∣ver addresses any but the wildest of her sex. But my chief aim is to take my gentleman off his guard, and like an invisible champion of romance examine the giant's force before I offer to combat.</P>

<P>No, Sir, we have been out of that these ten days.</P>

<P>One may call in this house, I find, to very little purpose. Suppose I should call for a taste, just by way of trial, of the nectar of your lips; perhaps I might be disappointed in that too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nectar! nectar! that's liquor there's no call for in these parts. French, I suppose. We keep no French wines here, Sir.</P>

<P>And who wants to be acquainted with you? I want no such acquaintance, not I. I'm sure you did not treat Miss Hardcastle that was here awhile ago in this obstropalous manner.

<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The girl would actually make one run mad! I tell you I'll not be convinced. I am convinced. He has scarcely been three hours in the house, and he has already encroached on all my prerogatives. You may like his impudence, and call it modesty.

<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! He'll drive me distracted if I contain myself any longer. Mr. Marlow. Sir; I have submitted to your insolence for more than four hours, and I see no likelihood of its coming to an end. I'm now resolved to be master here, Sir, and I desire that you and your drunken pack may leave my house directly.</P>

<P>I tell you, Sir, I'm serious; and, now that my passions are rouzed, I say this house is mine, Sir; this house is mine, and I command you to leave it directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! A puddle in a storm. I shan't stir a step, I assure you. <STAGE>(In a serious tone.)</STAGE> This, your house, fellow! It's my house. This is my

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I, confound me if ever I did. To come to my house, to call for what he likes, to turn me out of my own chair, to insult the family, to order his servants to get drunk, and then to tell me <HI>This house is mine, Sir.</HI> By all that's impudent it makes me laugh. Ha! ha! ha! Pray, Sir, <STAGE>(bantering.)</STAGE> as you take the house, what think you of taking the rest of the furniture? There's a pair of silver candlesticks, and there's a fire-screen, and here's a pair of brazen nosed bellows, perhaps you may take a fancy to them?</P>

<P>Bring me your bill, Sir, bring me your bill, and let's make no more words about it.</P>

<P>How's this! Sure I have not mistaken the house! Every thing looks like an inn. The ser∣vants cry, coming. The attendance is aukward; the bar-maid too to attend us. But she's here, and will further inform me. Whither so fast, child. A word with you.</P>

<P>Pray, child, answer me one question. What are you, and what may your business in this house be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>A relation of the family, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>What. A poor relation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir. A poor relation appointed to keep the keys, and to see that the guests want nothing in my power to give them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, you act as the bar-maid of this inn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="74" REF="80"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Inn. O law—What brought that in your head. One of the best families in the county keep an inn. Ha, ha, ha, old Mr. Hardcastle's house an inn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Hardcastle's house! Is this house Mr. Hard∣castle's house, child!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, sure. Whose else should it be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then all's out, and I have been damnably imposed on. O, confound my stupid head, I shall be laugh'd at over the whole town. I shall be stuck up in caricatura in all the print-shops. The Dullissimo Maccaroni. To mistake this house of all others for an inn, and my father's old friend for an inn-keeper. What a swaggering puppy must he take me for. What a silly puppy do I find myself. There again, may I be hang'd, my dear, but I mistook you for the bar-maid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear me! dear me! I'm sure there's nothing in my <HI>behavour</HI> to put me upon a level with one of that stamp.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, my dear, nothing. But I was in for a list of blunders, and could not help making you a subscriber. My stupidity saw every thing the wrong way. I mistook your assiduity for assur∣ance, and your simplicity for allurement. But its over—This house I no more shew <HI>my</HI> face in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, I have done nothing to disoblige you. I'm sure I should be sorry to affront any gentleman who has been so polite, and said so ma∣ny
<PB N="75" REF="81"/>
civil things to me. I'm sure I should be sorry <STAGE>(pretending to cry)</STAGE> if he left the family upon my account. I'm sure I should be sorry, people said any thing amiss, since I have no fortune but my character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>
<P>By heaven, she weeps. This is the first mark of tenderness I ever had from a mo∣dest woman, and it touches me; <STAGE>(to her)</STAGE> Ex∣cuse me, my lovely girl, you are the only part of the family I leave with reluctance. But to be plain with you, the difference of our birth, for∣tune and education, make an honourable connexi∣on impossible; and I can never harbour a thought of seducing simplicity that trusted in my honour, or bringing ruin upon one, whose only fault was being too lovely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Aside].</STAGE>
<P>Generous man! I now begin to admire him. <STAGE>(to him.)</STAGE> But I'm sure my family is as good as miss Hardcastle's, and though I'm poor, that's no great misfortune to a contented mind, and, until this moment, I never thought that it was bad to want fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why now, my pretty simplicity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because it puts me at a distance from one, that if I had a thousand pound I would give it all to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>
<P>This simplicity bewitches me, so that if I stay I'm undone. I must make one bold effort, and leave her. <STAGE>(to her)</STAGE> Your partiality in my fa∣vour, my dear, touches me most sensibly, and
<PB N="76" REF="82"/>
were I to live for myself alone, I could easily fix my choice. But I owe too much to the opinion of the world, too much to the authority of a fa∣ther, so that—I can scarcely speak it—it affects me. Farewell.</P>

<P>Ha, ha, ha. The peremptory tone in which he sent forth his sublime commands.</P>

<P>And the reserve with which I suppose he treated all your advances.</P>

<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet he might have seen something in me above a common inn-keeper, too.</P>

<P>Yes, Dick, but he mistook you for an uncom∣mon innkeeper, ha, ha, ha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I'm in too good spirits to think of any thing but joy. Yes, my dear friend, this union of our families will make our personal friendships hereditary; and tho' my daughter's fortune is but small—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Dick, will you talk of fortune to <HI>me.</HI> My son is possessed of more than a competence already, and can want nothing but a good and virtuous girl to share his happiness and encrease it. If they like each other, as you say they do—</P>

<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tut, boy, a trifle. You take it too gravely. An hour or two's laughing with my daughter will set all to rights again. She'll never like you the worse for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I shall be always proud of her approba∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Approbation is but a cold word, Mr. Marlow; if I am not deceived, you have something more than approbation thereabouts. You take me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Sir, I have not that happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, boy, I'm an old fellow, and know what's what, as well as you that are younger. I know what has past between you; but mum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, Sir, nothing has past between us but the most profound respect on my side, and the most distant reserve on her's. You don't think, Sir, that my impudence has been past upon all the rest of the family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impudence! No, I don't say that—Not quite impudence—Though girls like to be play'd with, and rumpled a little too sometimes. But she has told no tales, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never gave her the slightest cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I like modesty in its place well enough. But this is over-acting, young gentleman. You <HI>may</HI> be open. Your father and I will like you the better for it.</P>

<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I die. Sir, if I ever—</P>

<P>Dear Sir—I protest, Sir—</P>

<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see no reason why you should not be joined as fast as the parson can tie you.</P>

<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your father approves the match, I admire it, every moment's delay will be doing mischief, so—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why won't you hear me? By all that's just and true, I never gave miss Hardcastle the slight∣est mark of my attachment, or even the most distant hint to suspect me of affection. We had but one interview, and that was formal, modest and uninteresting.</P>

<P>This fellow's formal modest impu∣dence is beyond bearing.</P>

<P>And you never grasp'd her hand, or made any protestations!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>As heaven is my witness, I came down in obe∣dience to your commands. I saw the lady without emotion, and parted without reluctance. I hope you'll exact no further proofs of my duty, nor prevent me from leaving a house in which I suffer so many mortifications.</P>

<P>As most profest admirers do. Said some civil things of my face, talked much of his want of merit, and the greatness of mine; mentioned his heart, gave a short tragedy speech, and ended with pretended rapture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I'm perfectly convinced, indeed. I know his conversation among women to be modest and submissive. This forward canting ranting manner by no means describes him, and I am confident, he never sate for the picture.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then what, Sir, if I should convince you to your face of my sincerity? If you and my papa, in about half an hour, will place yourselves be∣hind that screen, you shall hear him declare his passion to me in person.</P>

<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall hear. I first took them down Fea∣ther-bed-lane, where we stuck fast in the mud. I then rattled them crack over the stones of Up-and-down Hill—I then introduc'd them to the gibbet on Heavy-tree Heath, and from that, with a cir∣cumbendibus, I fairly lodged them in the horse∣pond at the bottom of the garden.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Mr. Marlow, I will not, cannot detain you. Do you think I could suffer a connexion, in which there is the smallest room for repentance? Do you think I would take the mean advantage of a transient passion, to load you with confusion? Do you think I could ever relish that happiness, which was acquired by lessening your's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all that's good, I can have no happiness but what's in your power to grant me. Nor shall I ever feel repentance, but in not having seen your merits before. I will stay, even contrary to your wishes; and tho' you should persist to shun me, I
<PB N="102" REF="108"/>
will make my respectful assiduities atone for the le∣vity of my past conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I must entreat you'll desist. As our ac∣quaintance began, so let it end, in indifference. I might have given an hour or two to levity; but feriously, Mr. Marlow, do you think I could ever submit to a connexion, where <HI>I</HI> must appear mer∣cenary, and <HI>you</HI> imprudent? Do you think I could ever catch at the confident addresses of a secure admirer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Kneeling.)</STAGE>
<P>Does this look like security. Does this look like confidence. No, Madam, every moment that shews me your merit only serves to encrease my diffidence and confusion. Here let me continue—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can hold it no longer. Charles, Charles, how hast thou deceived me! Is this your indif∣ference, your uninteresting conversation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your cold contempt; your formal interview. What have you to say now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I'm all amazement! What can it mean!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It means that you can say and unsay things at pleasure. That you can address a lady in private, and deny it in public; that you have one story for us, and another for my daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="103" REF="109"/>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Daughter!—this lady your daughter!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, my only daughter. My Kate, whose else should she be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, that very identical tall squinting lady you were pleased to take me for, <STAGE>(curtesying.)</STAGE> She that you addressed as the mild, modest, sentimental man of gravity, and the bold forward agree∣able rattle of the ladies club; ha, ha, ha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds, there's no bearing this; it's worse than death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>In which of your characters, Sir, will you give us leave to address you. As the faultering gen∣tleman, with looks on the ground, that speaks just to be heard, and hates hypocrisy; or the loud confident creature, that keeps it up with Mrs. Mantrap, and old Miss Biddy Buckskin, till three in the morning; ha, ha, ha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, curse on my noisy head. I never attempted to be impudent yet, that I was not taken down. I must be gone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the hand of my body, but you shall not. I see it was all a mistake, and I am rejoiced to find it. You shall not, Sir, I tell you. I know she'll forgive you. Won't you forgive him, Kate. We'll all forgive you. Take courage, man.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[They retire, she tormenting him to the back Scene.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, so, they're gone off. Let them go, I care not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who gone?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dutiful niece and her gentleman, Mr. Ha∣stings, from Town. He who came down with our modest visitor here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who, my honest George Hastings. As worthy a fellow as lives, and the girl could not have made a more prudent choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, by the hand of my body, I'm proud of the connexion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if he has taken away the lady, he has not taken her fortune, that remains in this family to console us for her loss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure Dorothy you would not be so mercenary?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that's my affair, not your's. But you know if your son, when of age, refuses to marry his cousin, her whole fortune is then at her own dis∣posal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but he's not of age, and she has not thought proper to wait for his refusal.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> HASTINGS <HI>and</HI> Miss NEVILLE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
<P>What returned so soon, I begin not to like it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(To Hardcastle.)</STAGE>
<P>For my late attempt to fly off with your niece, let my present confusion be
<PB N="105" REF="111"/>
my punishment. We are now come back, to ap∣peal from your justice to your humanity. By her father's consent, I first paid her my addresses, and our passions were first founded in duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since his death, I have been obliged to stoop to dissimulation to avoid oppression. In an hour of levity, I was ready even to give up my fortune to secure my choice. But I'm now recover'd from the delusion, and hope from your tenderness what is denied me from a nearer connexion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw, pshaw, this is all but the whining end of a modern novel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be it what it will, I'm glad they're come back to reclaim their due. Come hither, Tony boy. Do you refuse this lady's hand whom I now of∣fer you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What signifies my refusing. You know I can't refuse her till I'm of age, father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>While I thought concealing your age boy was likely to conduce to your improvement, I con∣curred with your mother's desire to keep it se∣cret. But since I find she turns it to a wrong use, I must now declare, you have been of age these three months.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of age! Am I of age, father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Above three months.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you'll see the first use I'll make of my li∣berty. <STAGE>(taking miss Neville's hand.)</STAGE> Witness all men by these presents, that I, Anthony Lumpkin,
<PB N="106" REF="112"/>
Esquire, of BLANK place, refuse you, Constantia Neville, spinster, of no place at all, for my true and lawful wife. So Constance Neville may mar∣ry whom she pleases, and Tony Lumpkin is his own man again.</P>

<P>My undutiful offspring.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Joy, my dear George, I give you joy sincerely. And could I prevail upon my little tyrant here to be less arbitrary, I should be the happiest man alive, if you would return me the favour.</P>

<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(To miss Hardcastle.)</STAGE>
<P>Come, madam, you are now driven to the very last scene of all your con∣trivances. I know you like him, I'm sure he loves you, and you must and shall have him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Joining their hands.)</STAGE>
<P>And I say so too. And Mr. Marlow, if she makes as good a wife as she has a daughter, I don't believe you'll ever repent your bargain. So now to supper, to-morrow we shall gather all the poor of the parish about us, and the Mistakes of the Night shall be crowned with a merry morning; so boy take her; and as you have been mistakenn in the mistress, my wish is, that you may never be mistaken in the wife.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE <STAGE>To be Spoken in the Character of <HI>TONY LUMPKIN.</HI></STAGE></HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY J. CRADDOCK, Esq.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L><HI>WELL—</HI>now all's ended—and my comrades gone,</L>
<L>Pray what becomes of <HI>mother's nonly son?</HI></L>
<L>A hopeful blade!—in town I'll fix my station,</L>
<L>And try to make a bluster in the nation.</L>
<L>As for my cousin Neville, I renounce her,</L>
<L>Off—in a crack—I'll carry big Bett Bouncer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why should not I in the great world appear?</L>
<L>I soon shall have a thousand pounds a year;</L>
<L>No matter what a man may here inherit,</L>
<L>In London—'gad, they've some regard to spirit.</L>
<L>I see the horses prancing up the streets,</L>
<L>And big Bet Bouncer, bobs to all she meets;</L>
<L>Then hoikes to jiggs and pastimes ev'ry night—</L>
<L>Not to the plays—they say it a'n't polite,</L>
<L>To Sadler's-Wells perhaps, or Operas go,</L>
<L>And once by chance, to the roratorio.</L>
<L>Thus here and there, for ever up and down,</L>
<L>We'll set the fashions too, to half the town;</L>
<L>And then at auctions—money ne'er regard,</L>
<L>Buy pictures like the great, ten pounds a yard;</L>
<L>Zounds, we shall make these London gentry say,</L>
<L>We know what's damn'd genteel, as well as they. <NOTE PLACE="foot">* This came too late to be Spoken.</NOTE></L>
