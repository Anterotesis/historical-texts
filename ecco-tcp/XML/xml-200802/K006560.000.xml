<P>THE LIFE OF Dr. OLIVER GOLDSMITH: WRITTEN FROM Personal Knowledge, authentic Papers, and other indubitable Authorities. TO WHICH ARE ADDED, Such select Observations, from various Parts of this Writer's Works, as may tend to recreate the Fancy, improve the Understanding, and amend the Heart.</P>
<L>Sweet Poet of nature, dear Goldsmith, adieu!</L>
<L>As I witness'd thy worth, to thy fame I'll be true:</L>
<L>The tear of soft feeling most surely will start,</L>
<L>He must reach the warm bosom who writes to the heart;</L>
<L>But why should I check of sensation the tear?</L>
<L>The Muses already have wept on thy bier.</L>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Doctor <HI>Oliver Goldsmith.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>O write the life of Dr. Goldsmith, is far from being a laborious task, since little more is required than to give a transcript of the fairest pages of the human mind: to have known Shenstone, Cunning∣ham, and Goldsmith, is to have been happy in an acquaintance with the brightest side of the <HI>Land∣scape of Humanity</HI>; but to have seen one of these amiable pictures, is to have seen them all, abating for that slight difference in the colouring which became necessary from the different points of view, in which the pictures were to be placed.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3"/>The virtues of Dr. Goldsmith's mind, will long be conspicuous in his <HI>written page</HI>; and the reader will be warmed with the glowing graces, which, at once, animate and develope the soul of the author.</P>
<P>I know not if the observation was ever made, but I believe it will be found true, that when great abilities are united with very great virtues, if the possessor should be a writer at all, he will be a poet, and, if a poet, a very excellent one: in that case (as Cunningham sings)
<Q><L><HI>We shall mark in his elegant lines,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The graces that glow in his mind.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>I fancy if we were to try all the living writers by this standard, we should be able to form a more just opinion of their real characters as men, than by any other criterion. It is true, at least with regard to the literary men within the circle of my knowledge, that in proportion to the virtues of their minds, is the elegance of their writings; and that there is not a fool, or a worse character among them, that may not be distinguished by the turgidity of his style, and the <HI>consequential nothing∣ness</HI> of his phrase.</P>
<P>Who could hesitate a moment to distinguish be∣tween the manly dignity of style of the poet, whose loss we now lament, and the frippery bombast of a Murphy or a Kelly?—But the difference lay
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
chiefly <HI>in the mind</HI>; and the one was exactly as much a better writer than the others, as a better man.</P>
<P>It is an observation that Dr. Goldsmith has made in his Vicar of Wakefield, that <HI>Where the mind is ca∣pacious, the affections are good.</HI> I believe that the re∣mark is founded in the laws of nature.—God is infinite in wisdom and goodness.—What is genius but an emanation of the divine beam? Know you a man distinguished from all the rest of his ac∣quaintance for the frigid narrowness and selfishness of his soul?—depend on it he is remarkably de∣ficient in point of intellect: he may have much cunning; but he has no wisdom. On the contrary, know you a man of a warmer heart?—rest assured that he has a clearer head, than those who are strangers to that sublime feeling which does honour to humanity.</P>
<P>If there be an <HI>apparent</HI> exception to this rule, (and such may be found) it must be attributed to that commerce with mankind, which will, in some degree, contaminate the purest sentiments; but even under all appearances of variation, the latent principles of the mind need only to be drawn forth, to appear the same.</P>
<P>Roscommon, in Ireland, claims the honour of Dr. Goldsmith's birth. His father, who was a gentleman of a small estate, had nine sons, of whom Oliver was the third. He was born in the
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
year 1731, received a good classical education, and was intended for holy orders. With this view he was sent with his brother Henry to Trinity College, Dublin, in the year 1739, where he obtained a Bachelor's Degree: but his brother's merit, on leaving the College, not being rewarded with any preferment in the church, our author was advised to the study of physic, which he commenced, by attending several courses of anatomy in Dublin.</P>
<P>In the year 1751, he left Dublin and went to Edinburgh, where he prosecuted the study of medi∣cine, under several celebrated professors of that university; but he had not resided long in Scotland, before he began to feel the ill effects of his un∣bounded benevolence; and he was at length abso∣lutely obliged to leave the country, to avoid a prison; for he had bound himself to pay a larger sum for a friend, than the narrowness of his finances would enable him to discharge.</P>
<P>It was in the beginning of the year 1754, that he quitted Edinburgh; but he had no sooner reached Sunderland, than he was arrested for the amount of his bond; but he was happily relieved from his distress, by the humanity of Dr. Sleigh and Mr. Laughlin Maclane.</P>
<P>The debt being discharged, our ingenious philan∣thropist embarked on board a Dutch vessel, bound for Rotterdam, in which place he continued but a short time, and then went to Brussels. He now
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
made the tour of a considerable part of Flanders, took the degree of Bachelor of Physic at Louvain, and thence went through Switszerland to Geneva, in company with an English gentleman, whom he had made an acquaintance with in the course of his travels in Flanders.</P>
<P>When our poet sailed from England, he was al∣most destitute of money, so that he was under the necessity of travelling on foot, or declining a journey in which he promised himself much satisfaction, from a review of the customs and manners of dif∣ferent countries. Mr. Goldsmith was at this period in good health, possessing a strength of constitution, and a vigour of mind, which bid defiance to danger and fatigue. He was a tolerable proficient in the French language, and played on the German flute with a degree of taste something above mediocrity. Thus qualified, he travelled on, anxious to gratify his curiosity, and doubtful of the means of subsis∣tence; his classical knowledge, however, afforded him occasional entertainment in the religious houses; while his musical talents continued to feed and lodge him among the merry poor of Flanders, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Doctor, in relating the history of this part of his travels, would say, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When I approached a peasant's house in the evening, I played one of my most merry tunes; which procured me not only a lodging, but subsistence for the fol∣lowing
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
day: but I must own, that when I attempted to entertain persons of a higher rank, they always thought my performance contempt∣ible, nor ever made me any return for my endeavours to please them."</Q></P>
<P>Our author evidently refers to these circumstances of his life, in the following lines in his Traveller:
<Q><L><HI>To kinder skies, where gentler manners reign,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I turn; and France displays her bright domain;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Gay sprightly land of mirth and social ease,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Pleas'd with thyself, whom all the world can please;</HI></L>
<L><HI>How often have I led thy sportive choir,</HI></L>
<L><HI>With tuneless pipe, beside the murmuring Loire?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Where shading elms along the margin grew,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And freshen'd from the wave the zephyr flew;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And haply, though my harsh touch faltering still,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But mock'd all tune, and marr'd the dancer' skill;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Yet would the village praise my wonderous power,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And dance, forgetful of the noon-tide hour.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Alike all ages; dames of ancient days</HI></L>
<L><HI>Have led their children through the mirthful maze;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And the gay grandsire, skill'd in gestic lore,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Has frisk'd beneath the burthen of three-score.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Dr. Goldsmith had not been long at Geneva, when a young fellow arrived there, to whom he was recommended as a Tutor, in his travels through the rest of Europe. This youth having had a large fortune left him by his uncle, (a pawnbroker in London) resolved to improve himself by travel;
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
but, as avarice was his ruling passion, he saw little more of the the curiosities of the continent, than are to be seen without expence. He was con∣tinually remarking how extravagant were the ex∣pences of travelling, and perpetually contriving methods of retrenching them: so that it is not to be wondered if our author and his pupil parted, which they did at Marseilles, where the latter em∣barked for England, happy to save money rather than to gain knowledge.</P>
<P>There was, at this time, but a small balance due to Goldsmith, who was once more left to struggle with adversity. He now wandered alone through the greater part of France, till, having gratified his cu∣riosity, and sufficiently experienced those inconve∣niencies attennding the almost pennyless traveller, he sailed for England, and arriving at Dover to∣wards the latter end of the year 1758, he hastened immediately to London, where he found himself a perfect stranger, with scarce a shilling in the world.</P>
<P>Thus situated, he began to be extremely uneasy. His friend, Dr. Sleigh, now resided in London; Goldsmith enquired him out, and was received with every mark of friendship and esteem. An offer was now made him of the place of Usher at Dr. Milner's Academy at Peckham; and this he eagerly acceped, unwilling to subsist on the bounty of Dr. Sleigh.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9"/>About this period, he wrote some criticisms for the Monthly Review; which meeting with high approbation, Mr. Griffiths (the proprietor) engaged him to superintend that publication; he therefore repaired to London, and commenced Author in form. This was in the year 1759, when he wrote a few pieces, and but a few, for the Booksellers: and though his pay was, as it me∣rited, greater than that of many other writers, it was nevertheless very disproportionate to the merit of such a <HI>writer,</HI> and still farther below the me∣rit of such a <HI>man</HI> as Dr. Goldsmith: yet were not the booksellers, his employers, worthy of censure, as his name was not known to the public, and his essays and poems were inserted among the pro∣miscuous croud, in magazines, and other periodi∣cal publications.</P>
<P>It was at this period that the Doctor became ac∣quainted with the late Mr. Newberry, who being a proprietor of the Public Ledger, our poet was engaged as a writer in that paper, then newly esta∣blished, in which he published a series of valuable letters, which have been since printed in volumes, under the title of the <Q REND="inline">"Citizen of the world."</Q></P>
<P>Hitherto the Doctor had lodged, much in the stile of a poor author, in Green-arbor Court in the Old Bailey; but he now got better apartments in Wine-Office Court, Fleet-street, and a summer lodging at Canonbury House, Islington, where he continued
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
a considerable time, and then removed, first to the King's Bench Walks, and afterwards to Brick Court, in the Temple, where he died.</P>
<P>With the publication of the <HI>Traveller,</HI> our au∣thor's literary fame began to encrease very fast, and it was established by the appearance of the <HI>Vicar of Wakefield</HI>; for he was now equally and justly esteemed both as a poet and novellist; he had been before known for a good critic; and he has since shone as a learned historian.</P>
<P>The publication of the Vicar of Wakefield was succeeded by that of the Comedy of the <HI>Good-na∣tured Man,</HI> which was performed nine nights at Covent Garden Theatre; but did not meet with an applause equal to its merit; though it was far from being ill-received.</P>
<P>The next piece of any consequence that our author presented the world with, was his <HI>Deserted Village,</HI> a poem abounding in nature, truth, ele∣gance and benevolence. A circumstance respect∣ing the sale of the copy of this piece, marks very strongly the author's simplicity of mind, and un∣bounded goodness of heart. The manuscript having been delivered to the bookseller, he gave the Doctor his note of hand for one hundred gui∣neas, for the copy-right. The Doctor mentioned this circumstance the same day to a gentleman, who said he thought it a large sum for so small a piece. <Q REND="inline">"In truth, said the poet, I think so too, nor
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
have I been easy since I received it; I will therefore go and return him his note."</Q>—This he actually did, leaving the payment to the bookseller's ho∣nour, when the sale should inform him what he might afford to give.</P>
<P>The success of the Doctor's last comedy, <HI>She stoops to Conquer,</HI> is too generally known to need being mentioned. It is in fact, the most laughable piece which has been brought on the stage for many years.—Mr. Colman was, or pretended to be of opinion, that this piece would be damned. A proof that managers are not always the best judges of the taste of the town; and one would think that they are not therefore the most proper caterers, how∣ever they may have assumed a right of cramming the public with any trash they think proper.</P>
<P>The fate of a writer for the stage is not much to be envied. After many months labour to complete a piece to his own approbation, he is to summon patience to a bide all the manager's affected correc∣tions, and still more mortifying delays; and after all, perhaps, a disgusted acquaintance shall make a party, raise a riot, and damn the play!</P>
<P>Our ingenious writer had laid a plan for writing an <Q REND="inline">"Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences."</Q> In which he had a promise of the occasional assist∣ance of Dr. Johnson, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Beauclerc, and David Garrick, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>—Of the suc∣cess
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
of this great work, the Doctor had formed high expectations; but he did not live to make any pro∣gress in it.</P>
<P>It is said that our author cleared 1800 l. in one year by his writings; notwithstanding which, part∣ly by the unbounded benevolence of his disposition, and partly from an unhappy turn for gaming, which he contracted in his latter years, he was often dis∣tressed for cash in a very great degree.</P>
<P>Dr. Goldsmith's great and shining talents procur∣ed him many friends and admirers among persons in the first walk of life; among others the Duke of Northumberland is mentioned, as having wished to be known to our poet, who himself told the follow∣ing story of his visit to the Peer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was invited, said the Doctor, by my friend Mr. Percy, to wait upon the Duke, in consequence of the satisfaction he had received from the perusal of one of my productions. I dressed myself in the best manner I could, and after studying some com∣pliments I thought necessary on such an occasion, proceeded to Northumberland-house, and acquaint∣ed the servants that I had particular business with his Grace. They shewed me into an anti-chamber, where, after waiting some time, a gentleman very elegantly dressed made his appearance. Taking him for the Duke, I delivered all the fine things I had composed, in order to compliment him on the honour he had done me; when, to my great asto∣nishment,
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
he told me I had mistaken him for his master, who would see me immediately. At that instant the Duke came into the apartment; and I was so con∣fused on the occasion, that I wanted words barely sufficient to express the sense I entertained of the Duke's politeness, and went away exceedingly cha∣grined at the blunder I had committed."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Goldsmith, happy as he thought himself in the strength of a vigorous constitution, paid at all times too little regard to the preservation of that health so dear to his friends, so important to the public.</P>
<P>I remember, some years since, on the Doctor's partial recovery from a fit of illness, he came into the Chapter Coffee-House; when a gentleman ob∣served how pale he looked, and expressed his fears for his safety:—<Q REND="inline">"Pale! (cried the poet, in a pettish humour) that may be, Sir; but the <HI>Stamina's</HI> good—the <HI>Stamina's</HI> good."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Goldsmith's natural disposition led him to covet a life of learned leisure; but this was too often interrupted by that want of money to which the benevolence of his disposition frequently reduced him. When his circumstances were embarrassed, his temper was so ruffled, that he often expressed himself in the most vehement manner. These gusts of passion, as they were very violent, were very short: the philosopher recollected, and resumed himself on a moment's reflection; but his servants
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
profited by their master's violence; for they would put themselves in his way, when he was in a passion, sure to reap the reward of undeserved chastisement.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable of this gentleman, that, contrary to the opinion of almost all the world, he thought Ben Johnson, Beaumont, and their co∣temporaries, but second-rate poets; indeed he considered Shakespear himself as inferior to Van∣burgh and Farquhar.</P>
<P>The Doctor was, from principle, an enemy to that class of patriotic writers, (as they are called) who distinguish themselves, by abusing the govern∣ment under which they live: in fact, he considered them as enemies to all good government. He was a friend to monarchy, and held sacred the person of the sovereign. But if he was an enemy to those who abused our government and governors, indiscri∣minately, he was much more so to those paltry, those detestable writers, who, sacrificing every con∣sideration at the shrine of Plutus, wrote on both sides of a contested question, and <HI>on both at the same time,</HI> for HIRE. It is said that Dr. Goldsmith did not speak to Mr. Kelly for seven years pre∣ceeding his death.</P>
<P>He firmly believed the doctrine of a future state, in which the miseries of the virtuous in this life, would be amply rewarded by a permanency of happiness, incapable of decay: above flattering the vices or follies of the rich or great, he was ill qualified to push his fortune among those whom
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
his genius taught to court his company: yet was he happy in a connection with many of the greatest and best characters of this kingdom.</P>
<P>Dr. Goldsmith being seized with a violent indis∣position, on the 25th of March, 1774, sent for Mr. Hawes, an apothecary, in the Strand, the night succeeding that day, and declared his intention of taking Dr. James's fever powders; to his persisting in which resolution, many of his warmest friends have ascribed the loss of this great and good man! How far they are right in their conjectures it would be needless, if it were not impossible to say. Mr. Hawes has published an account of the Doctor's illness, so far as relates to the exhibition of these powders. The public may be interested in the enquiry into the probable effects of so powerful a medicine. The writer of these pages has only to say, that Mr. Hawes is a man whose skill or vera∣city will not be doubted for a moment by any one who has the honour of knowing him.</P>
<P>This delightful poet, this sweet moralist, this excellent man! departed this life on the 4th of April, 1774, and was interred in the Burying-Ground of the Temple. It was proposed to have buried him in Westminster-Abey, where, however, a monument is to be erected to his memory:—but the best and most lasting monument will be found in his works.</P>
<P>Dr. Goldsmith was in stature rather under the middle size, and built more like the porter than
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
the gentleman: his complexion was pale, his forehead low, his face almost round, and pitted with the small pox; but marked with the strong lines of thinking: upon the whole there was no∣thing in his appearance that would not rather pre∣possess the mind against him; but to those who knew him, there appeared a melting softness in his eye, that was the genuine effect of his humanity. Never did that eye behold an object of distress, but it conveyed an intelligence to the heart, that stretched out the hand irresistibly to relieve; and it is well known that his unbounded philanthropy contributed to keep him poor; but he ever felt a satisfaction in the conscious dignity and liberality of his mind, that the possession of wealth without the will to distribute it could never have afforded!</P>
<P>Presuming that the best use to which biography can be applied is to profit by the amiable part of the author's character: I shall extract, for the en∣tertainment and instruction of my readers, such passages of Dr. Goldsmith's works, as mark in a striking manner, the unbounded benevolence of his temper, or the elegant simplicity of his mind. That he thought justly on most occasions is a fact which will appear incontestible from the perusal of many of the following observations:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As some men gaze with admiration at the co∣lours of a tulip, or the wing of a butterfly, so I was by nature <HI>an admirer of happy human faces.</HI>"</Q> Vicar of Wakefield. vol. I. p. 3. 4th edition.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The virtue which requires to be ever guarded, is scarce worth the sentinel."</Q> Ib. p. 48.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hospitality is one of the first Christian duties.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When great vices are opposed in the same mind to as extraordinary virtues, such a character de∣serves contempt."</Q> Ib. p. 151.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Bad men want shame; they only blush at being detected in doing good, but glory in their vices."</Q> Ib. p. 154.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For the first time the very best may err; art may persuade, and novelty spread out its charm. The first fault is the child of simplicity; but every other the offspring of guilt."</Q> Ib. p. 185.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19"/><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Man little knows what calamities are beyond his patience to bear till he tries them; as in ascending the heights of ambition, which look bright from below, every step we rise shews us some new and gloomy prospect of hidden disap∣pointment; so in our descent from the summits of pleasure, though the vale of misery below may appear at first dark and gloomy, yet the busy mind, still attentive to its own amusement, finds as we descend something to flatter and to please. Still as we approach, the darkest objects appear to brighten, and the mortal eye becomes adapted to its gloomy situation."</Q> Ib. p. 191.</P>

which find or make men guilty, which enclose wretches for the commission of one crime, and return them, if returned alive, fitted for the per∣petration of thousands; we should see, as in other parts of Europe, places of penitence and solitude, where the accused might be attended by such as could give them repentance if guilty, or new motives to virtue if innocent. And this, but not the increasing punishments, is the way to mend a state."</Q> Ib. p. 119.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To religion we must hold in every circum∣stance of life for our truest comfort; for if already we are happy, it is a pleasure to see that we can make that happiness unending; and if we are miserable, it is very consoling to think that there is a place of rest.

<P>The above will, we conceive, be deemed a suf∣ficient specimen of Dr. Goldsmith's abilities as a prose writer. The reader will not be displeased to see how the poetical talents of this admirable ge∣nius are equally adapted to charm the imagination, and win the heart to virtue.</P>
<P>In his TRAVELLER, after having described the fraternal fondness of an <Q REND="inline">"<HI>untravelled heart,</HI>"</Q> he ad∣dresses his brother as follows,
<Q><L>" Eternal blessings crown my earliest friend,</L>
<L>" And round his dwelling guardian saints attend;</L>
<L>" Blest be that spot, where chearful guests retire</L>
<L>" To pause from toil, and trim their evening fire;</L>
<L>" Blest that abode, where want and pain repair,</L>
<L>" And every stranger finds a ready chair;</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="23"/>" Blest be those feasts with simple plenty crown'd,</L>
<L>" Where all the ruddy family around,</L>
<L>" Laugh at the jest or pranks that never fail,</L>
<L>" Or sigh with pity at some mournful tale,</L>
<L>" Or press the bashful stranger to his food,</L>
<L>" And learn the luxury of doing good."</L></Q></P>
<P>Is not the following as beautiful, in point of poetry, as the wish that concludes it is honour∣able to the feelings of the writer's heart?<Q><L>" As some lone miser visiting his store,</L>
<L>" Bends at his treasure, counts, recounts it o'er;</L>
<L>" Hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill,</L>
<L>" Yet still he sighs, for hoards are wanting still:</L>
<L>" Thus to my breast alternate passions rise,</L>
<L>" Pleas'd with each good that heaven to man supplies:</L>
<L>" Yet oft a sigh prevails, and sorrows fall,</L>
<L>" To see the hoard of human bliss so small;</L>
<L>" And oft I wish, amidst the scene, to find</L>
<L>" Some spot to real happiness consign'd,</L>
<L>" Where my worn soul, each wandering hope at rest,</L>
<L>" May gather bliss to see my fellows blest."</L></Q></P>
<P>Our author seems to have been of opinion that, however different in appearance the degrees of happiness in different countries, the beneficent author of nature has given an equal share to all.<Q><L>" And yet, perhaps, if countries we compare,</L>
<L>" And estimate the blessings which they share;</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="24"/>" Tho' patriots flatter, still shall wisdom find</L>
<L>" An equal portion dealt to all mankind,</L>
<L>" As different good, by Art or Nature given,</L>
<L>" To different nations makes their blessings even."</L></Q></P>
<P>Speaking of Italy and its inhabitants, our author has the following beautiful lines.<Q><L>" But small the bliss that sense alone bestows,</L>
<L>" And sensual bliss is all the nation knows.</L>
<L>" In florid beauty groves and fields appear,</L>
<L>" Man seems the only growth that dwindles here.</L>
<L>" Contrasted faults through all his manners reign,</L>
<L>" Though poor, luxurious, though submissive, vain,</L>
<L>" Though grave, yet trifling, zealous, yet untrue,</L>
<L>" And e'en in penance planning sins anew."</L></Q></P>
<P>But let us, with the poet, turn to
<Q><L>" Where the bleak Swiss their stormy mansions tread,</L>
<L>" And force a churlish soil for scanty bread;</L>
<L>" No product here the barren hills afford,</L>
<L>" But man and steel, the soldier and his sword.</L>
<L>" No vernal blooms their torpid rocks array,</L>
<L>" But winter ling'ring chills the lap of May."</L></Q></P>
<P>Of France and its inhabitants, he says,
<Q><L>" —Ostentation here, with tawdry art,</L>
<L>" Pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart;</L>
<L>" Here vanity assumes her pert grimace,</L>
<L>" And trims her robes of frize with copper lace,</L>
<L>" Here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer,</L>
<L>" To boast one splendid banquet once a year;</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="25"/>" The mind still turns where shifting fashion draws,</L>
<L>" Nor weighs the solid worth of self applause."</L></Q></P>
<P>His picture of the Dutch is very striking.
<Q><L>" —Their much-lov'd wealth imparts</L>
<L>" Convenience, plenty, elegance, and arts;</L>
<L>" But view them closer, craft and fraud appear,</L>
<L>" Even liberty itself is barter'd here.</L>
<L>" At gold's superior charms all freedom flies,</L>
<L>" The needy sell it, and the rich man buys;</L>
<L>" A land of tyrants, and a den of slaves,</L>
<L>" Here wretches seek dishonourable graves,</L>
<L>" And calmly bent, to servitude conform,</L>
<L>" Dull as their lakes that slumber in the storm."</L></Q></P>
<P>Is he not equally happy in describing our own country, and its inhabitants?
<Q><L>" —My genius spreads her wing,</L>
<L>" And flies where Britain courts the western spring;</L>
<L>" Where lawns extend that scorn Arcadian pride,</L>
<L>" And brighter streams than fam'd Hydaspis glide.</L>
<L>" There all around the gentlest breezes stray,</L>
<L>" There gentle music melts on every spray;</L>
<L>" Creation's mildest charms are there combin'd.</L>
<L>" Extremes are only in the master's mind!</L>
<L>" Stern o'er each bosom reason holds her state,</L>
<L>" With daring aims irregularly great,</L>
<L>" Pride in their port, defiance in their eye,</L>
<L>" I see the lords of human kind pass by,</L><GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1+ pages" DISP="〈1+ pages missing〉"/></Q></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26"/>This very elegant poem concludes with the following lines:
<Q><L>" Vain, very vain, my weary search to find</L>
<L>" That bliss which only centers in the mind:</L>
<L>" Why have I stray'd, from pleasure and repose,</L>
<L>" To seek a good each government bestows?</L>
<L>" In every government, though terrors reign,</L>
<L>" Though tyrant kings, or tyrant laws restrain,</L>
<L>" How small of all that human hearts endure,</L>
<L>" That part which laws or kings can cause or cure.</L>
<L>" Still to ourselves in every place consign'd,</L>
<L>" Our own felicity we make or find:</L>
<L>" With secret course, which no loud storms annoy,</L>
<L>" Glides the smooth current of domestic joy.</L>
<L>" The lifted ax, the agonizing wheel,</L>
<L>" Luke's iron crown, and Damien's bed of steel,</L>
<L>" To men remote from power but rarely known,</L>
<L>" Leave reason, faith, and conscience, all our own."</L></Q></P>
<P>In the DESERTED VILLAGE, our poet execrates and laments that encrease of luxury, which will, probably, hasten the ruin of this empire. The co∣louring of this poem is very warm, but I am afraid it is too just.—The luxuries of the higher ranks have been so long taxing the industry of the low∣er, and such numerous emigrations have already taken place, that there seems every reason to appre∣hend that Dr. Goldsmith's Deserted Village may, in another century, be realized in a <HI>Deserted Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27"/>This poem is every where, and so equally excel∣lent, that we know not to which particular beauty to turn the eye of the reader. The following ex∣tracts will shew to what a height of elegance the English language may arrive, and how astonishing∣ly sweet may be the harmony of its periods, with∣out their deducting any thing from the sterling man∣liness of their sense.<Q><LG>
<L>" Sweet AUBURN, loveliest village of the plain,</L>
<L>" Where health and plenty chea'rd the labouring swain,</L>
<L>" Where smiling spring its earliest visit paid,</L>
<L>" And parting summer's lingering blooms delayed."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,</L>
<L>" Where wealth accumulates, and men decay:</L>
<L>" Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade;</L>
<L>" A breath can make them, as a breath has made;</L>
<L>" But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,</L>
<L>" When once destroy'd, can never be supplied.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Near yonder copse, where once the garden smil'd,</L>
<L>" And still where many a garden flower grows wild;</L>
<L>" There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,</L>
<L>" The village preacher's modest mansion rose.</L>
<L>" A man he was, to all the country dear,</L>
<L>" And passing rich with forty pounds a year."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,</L>
<L>" And even his failings leaned to Virtue's side;</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="28"/>" But in his duty prompt at every call,</L>
<L>" He watched and wept, he prayed and felt, for all.</L>
<L>" And, as a bird each fond endearment ties,</L>
<L>" To tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies;</L>
<L>" He tried each art, reproved each dull delay,</L>
<L>" Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Beside the bed where parting life was layed,</L>
<L>" And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismayed,</L>
<L>" The reverend champion stood. At his control,</L>
<L>" Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;</L>
<L>" Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,</L>
<L>" And his last faultering accents whispered praise."</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Behold the picture of the country scoolmaster.<Q><L>" Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way,</L>
<L>" With blossomed furze unprofitable gay,</L>
<L>" There, in his noisy mansion, skill'd to rule,</L>
<L>" The village master taught his little school;</L>
<L>" A man severe he was, and stern to view,</L>
<L>" I knew him well, and every truant knew;</L>
<L>" Well had the boding tremblers learned to trace</L>
<L>" The day's disasters in his morning face;</L>
<L>" Full well they laugh'd with counterfeited glee,</L>
<L>" At all his jokes, for many a joke had he;</L>
<L>" Full well the busy whisper circling round,</L>
<L>" Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frown'd;</L>
<L>" Yet he was kind, or if severe in aught,</L>
<L>" The love he bore to learning was in fault;</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="29"/>" The village all declared how much he knew;</L>
<L>" 'Twas certain he could write and cypher too;</L>
<L>" Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage,</L>
<L>" And even the story ran that he could gauge.</L>
<L>" In arguing too, the parson own'd his skill,</L>
<L>" For even tho' vanquished, he could argue still;</L>
<L>" While words of learned length, and thundering sound,</L>
<L>" Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around;</L>
<L>" And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew,</L>
<L>" That one small head could carry all he knew."</L></Q></P>
<P>Having painted the village Ale-house, (decayed of course since its customers had been obliged to leave their native land in search of bread) our poet has the following picturesque lines.<Q><L>" Thither no more the peasant shall repair</L>
<L>" To sweet oblivion of his daily care;</L>
<L>" Nor more the farmer's news, the barber's tale,</L>
<L>" No more the wood-man's ballad shall prevail;</L>
<L>" No more the smith his dusky brow shall clear,</L>
<L>" Relax his ponderous strength, and lean to hear;</L>
<L>" The host himself no longer shall be found</L>
<L>" Careful to see the mantling bliss go round;</L>
<L>" Nor the coy maid, half willing to be prest,</L>
<L>" Shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest."</L></Q></P>
<P>This following picture of a rustic family, on the point of emigrating, will give a melancholy, but,
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
I fear, a just idea, of scenes that too often occur in the distant parts of these kingdoms!</P>
<Q><L>" Good Heaven! what sorrows gloom'd that parting day,</L>
<L>" That called them from their native walks away;</L>
<L>" When the poor exiles, every pleasure past,</L>
<L>" Hung round their bowers, and fondly looked their last,</L>
<L>" And took a long farewell, and wished in vain</L>
<L>" For seats like these beyond the western main;</L>
<L>" And shuddering still to face the distant deep,</L>
<L>" Retuned and wept, and still returned to weep.</L>
<L>" The good old sire, the first prepared to go</L>
<L>" To new found worlds, and wept for others woe;</L>
<L>" But for himself, in conscious virtue brave,</L>
<L>" He only wished for worlds beyond the grave.</L>
<L>" His lovely daughter, lovelier in her tears,</L>
<L>" The fond companion of his helpless years,</L>
<L>" Silent went next, neglectful of her charms,</L>
<L>" And left a lover's for a father's arms.</L>
<L>" With louder plaints the mother spoke her woes,</L>
<L>" And blest the cot where every pleasure rose;</L>
<L>" And kist her thoughtless babes with many a tear,</L>
<L>" And claspt them close in sorrow doubly dear;</L>
<L>" Whilst her fond husband strove to lend relief</L>
<L>" In all the silent manliness of grief."</L></Q>
<P>We shall conclude with the following lines, sorry only that, as general experience has proved their
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
truth, England seems resolved not to become an exception to the rule.<Q><L>" O luxury! Thou curst by Heaven's decree,</L>
<L>" How ill exchanged are things like these for thee,</L>
<L>" How do thy potions with insidious joy,</L>
<L>" Diffuse their pleasures only to destroy!</L>
<L>" Kingdoms, by thee, to sickly greatness grown,</L>
<L>" Boast of a florid vigour not their own;</L>
<L>" At every draught more large and large they grow,</L>
<L>" A bloated mass of rank unwieldy woe;</L>
<L>" Till sapped their strength, and every part unsound,</L>
<L>" Down, down they sink, and spread a ruin round."</L></Q></P>
