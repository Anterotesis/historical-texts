<HEAD>To Mr. INCLEDON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the very eminent line you are ranked in as a vocal performer, and the great pleasure I have often re∣ceived when I have heard you sing some of the following Songs, I thought there would be no impropriety, trusting at the same time that you would not take it amiss, were I to inscribe the following little work to you. I have been the more particularly urged to publish my songs in this manner, from hearing of the frequent applications which have been made for them to almost every bookseller in town, who have not had it in their power until now, to gratify their different customers. There are more people
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
capable of reading than singing a song, therefore, those that have not studied mu∣sic sufficiently, may have the opportunity of looking over the words in the closet; many of them have been set by some of the most able composers, and many also by the most moderate ones; which have often been the cause of putting the reader out of humour with the words, from the mu∣sician's misconception of the subject, or his deficiency in respect to effect and harmony. Many an author has had the mortification of seeing his words martyred by the com∣poser of the music, who has evidently shewn, by his emphasis (if I may be allowed that phrase) being wrongly placed, that although he might be full master of his science, so far as to know a crotchet from a minim, yet if you had set him to read, perhaps, he did not know a substantive from a verb, and a total stranger altogether of antithesis or inflection; in such case, good words are often prostituted through ignorance, which is as mortifying as if any body were to put a valuable piece of broad cloth into the hands of an unskilful Taylor, who having no taste, in respect to fashion or shape,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
often produces a coat not only unfit to be worn, but unfit to be seen also, from which reason, it has disgusted, and been thrown upon the shelf to rot in oblivion. And on the other hand, many a song which has been meerly <HI>measure,</HI> without the least pre∣tention to the name of Poetry, divested at the same time of instructive matter as well as of figure or incident, has become a fa∣vourite ditty with the Public, from the in∣genuity of the composer of the music, who may have been lucky enough to give it a good tune.</P>
<P>In the above instance we are told the Italian composers do often excel; and the late ingenious Bonnel Thornton, joint writer of the Connoisieur, has, in some part of his works, given us a translation of one of their popular airs, which we also find to be strictly <HI>measure,</HI> and runs thus:
<Q><L>" Where, which, and wherefore,</L>
<L>" There, this, and therefore!!!"</L></Q>
This is a kind of fashionable <HI>scaffolding</HI> for the music, which the composer <HI>builds</HI> upon,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
and finishes his part by <HI>line</HI> and <HI>rule,</HI> like a good mason or bricklayer, who never considers, or looks into the imperfection of the architect, but is perfectly contented that he has finished <HI>his</HI> part of the business well, let the superstructure be ever so con∣temptible; but you are a better judge of music than I am, and if this metaphor should not hold good, you will be kind enough to pardon,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your most obedient Servant, GEO. S. CAREY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

A CHOICE <HI>COLLECTION</HI> OF FAVOURITE SONGS.</HEAD>
<DIV1 TYPE="song">
<HEAD>I WISH YOU AN HAPPY NEW YEAR.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>JOHN ENGLISH, who often would speak without thought,</L>
<L>Not having the judgment to think as he ought,</L>
<L>From custom, let danger be ever so near,</L>
<L>Wou'd annually wish you A HAPPY NEW YEAR.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Should our coast be in danger, and people afraid,</L>
<L>Lest the French, or the Dutch, should our country invade;</L>
<L>Give John but his Pipe, and his good Christmas cheer,</L>
<L>He'll greet all his friends WITH AN HAPPY NEW YEAR.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some people call Johnny a national hack,</L>
<L>He bears such a national load on his back,</L>
<L>Should trade become dull, and should dockets appear,</L>
<L>Yet Johnny shall wish you A HAPPY NEW YEAR.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Should Monopoly threaten, or Famine surround,</L>
<L>And nothing about us but misery found,</L>
<L>When at every dwelling long faces appear,</L>
<L>Kind Johnny shall wish you A HAPPY NEW YEAR.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<L>Without knowing the fate of the following day,</L>
<L>Or what heavy demands without money to pay,</L>
<L>Tho' the weather be bad, or provisions be dear,</L>
<L>Yet Johnny shall wish you A HAPPY NEW YEAR.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis a wish that our ancestors us'd to bestow,</L>
<L>In the good times of old we all very well know,</L>
<L>But those times are over, all wise people fear,</L>
<L>Who laugh when you talk of A HAPPY NEW YEAR!</L>

<DIV1 TYPE="song">
<HEAD>THE LOYAL TAR.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>'SDEATH what a fuss land-lubbers make</L>
<L>About their rights and laws,</L>
<L>As if in doubt what part to take,</L>
<L>And jar, as 'twere, for straws;—</L>
<L>If they wou'd do the thing that's right,</L>
<L>Or cease prevarication,</L>
<L>Like loyal tars they wou'd unite,</L>
<L>To save this envy'd nation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Much talking argues little good,</L>
<L>For many do remark,</L>
<L>That our has not the truest blood,</L>
<L>Which is too apt to bark.</L>
<L>True courage ne'er delights in noise;</L>
<L>But when there is occasion,</L>
<L>The loyal tar each nerve employs</L>
<L>To save his envy'd nation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let Frenchmen say whate'er they will,</L>
<L>And pass such mad decrees,</L>
<L>That each a brother's blood shall spill,</L>
<L>Or father's if they please;</L>
<L>We are not quite so savage grown,</L>
<L>To ape so strange a fashion,</L>
<L>Each loyal tar will guard the crown,</L>
<L>His king, his friend, and nation!</L>

<HEAD>THE MASON'S ALLEGORY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE trade of a Mason's a good moral school,</L>
<L>Where the <HI>measures</HI> of life are establish'd by <HI>rule,</HI></L>
<L>When affairs go awry let your judgment incline,</L>
<L>To make matters <HI>even</HI> by drawing the <HI>line.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shou'd your paths, being crooked, bewilder the mind,</L>
<L>Or, encircl'd by care, no alternative find,</L>
<L>Ne'er let your guide, Reason, give way to despair,</L>
<L>Old Time, with exertion, your troubles may <HI>square.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shou'd you meet with a brother in <HI>craft</HI> too profound,</L>
<L>Make use of your <HI>plummet,</HI> his subtilty <HI>sound,</HI></L>
<L>And if you no <HI>bottom</HI> should find in his heart,</L>
<L>When his hand he presents you, then bid him depart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let your converse be <HI>level,</HI> your life not too gay,</L>
<L>But just within compass the moderate way;</L>
<L>When you're crippl'd by age, infirm and oppress'd,</L>
<L>Let Faith lend a <HI>pillar</HI> on which you may rest.</L>

<HEAD>THE SOLDIER'S RESOLUTION.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SEE the night's ta'en its leave, the streamers of day,</L>
<L>Begin from the eastward to dart,</L>
<L>The ravilia beats, and I'm summon'd away,</L>
<L>'Tis hard my dear Betsey to part,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It is not the foe in the field that I dread,</L>
<L>Nor the point of the glittering steel,</L>
<L>It is not the whistling bullet of lead,</L>
<L>'Tis parting with thee that I feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I must not indulge in the thought of my dear,</L>
<L>The bustle of war is around,</L>
<L>The bellowing trumpet blows loud in the ear,</L>
<L>My spirits start up at the sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<L>I'll fight for my king as a soldier should fight,</L>
<L>Yet were I to 'scape with my life,</L>
<L>When the wars are all o'er, 'twou'd be my delight,</L>
<L>To make my dear Betsey my wife.</L>

<HEAD>THE DISCONSOLATE SAILOR.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN my money was gone that I gain'd in the wars,</L>
<L>And the world 'gan to frown at my fate,</L>
<L>What matter'd my zeal or my honoured scars</L>
<L>When indifference stood at each gate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The face that would smile when my purse was well lin'd,</L>
<L>Shew'd a different aspect to me,</L>
<L>And when I could nought but ingratitude find,</L>
<L>I hi'd once again to the sea.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I thought it unwise to repine at my lot,</L>
<L>To bear with cold looks on the shore,</L>
<L>So I pack'd up the trifling remnants I'd got,</L>
<L>And a trifle, alas! was my store.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A handkerchief held all the treasure I had,</L>
<L>Which over my shoulder I threw,</L>
<L>Away then I trudg'd, with a heart rather sad,</L>
<L>To join with some jolly ship's crew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The sea was less troubl'd, by far, than my mind,</L>
<L>For when the wide main I survey'd,</L>
<L>I could not help thinking the world was unkind,</L>
<L>And fortune a slipp'ry jade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And I vow'd, if once more I could take her in tow,</L>
<L>I'd let the ungrateful ones see,</L>
<L>That the turbulent winds, and the billows could shew</L>
<L>More kindness than they did to me.</L>

<HEAD>THE DISCONSOLATE SAILOR'S RETURN.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ONCE more I return'd to my own native shore,</L>
<L>Which I left so dejected, so heartless and poor,</L>
<L>Each face look'd indignant and shy;</L>
<L>I sought for relief on the perilous main,</L>
<L>And, Fortune, she cheer'd my poor heart once again,</L>
<L>While I brav'd the caprice of the sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' death seem'd impatiently waiting around,</L>
<L>With sharp-pointed lightning and thunder profound,</L>
<L>Or roar'd in the turbulent wind,</L>
<L>When a calm has return'd, I've said to each mate,</L>
<L>Tho' the heavens have frown'd, there's nothing I hate.</L>
<L>So much as the frowns of mankind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I had not forgot how my heart was oppress'd,</L>
<L>And slighted by those, whom I'd often caress'd,</L>
<L>And parted my penny so free;</L>
<L>But if ever dame Fortune shou'd leave me again.</L>
<L>No more shall ingratitude give me a pain,</L>
<L>I'll seek for resource on the sea.</L>

<HEAD>MARY OF THE TYNE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHAT pleasure oft' 'tis to reveal,</L>
<L>The pain or pleasure that we feel;</L>
<L>'Tis bliss, while either we impart</L>
<L>Unto a sympathetic heart;—</L>
<L>Just like that sweet heart of thine,</L>
<L>My lovely Mary of the Tyne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I lose, when near thee, all my care,</L>
<L>When from thee, I am all despair;</L>
<L>My bosom heaves with anxious pain,</L>
<L>Until I meet with thee again;</L>
<L>What are the adverse pangs of mine,</L>
<L>My lovely Mary of the Tyne?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
<L>Say is it from thy beauteous face,</L>
<L>Or is it from thy natural grace,</L>
<L>Or is it thy angelic mind,</L>
<L>Or is it ev'ry one combin'd,</L>
<L>Making one sweet form divine,</L>
<L>My lovely Mary of the Tyne?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shou'd it be love, thou'lt sure forgive,</L>
<L>That is the food on which I live;</L>
<L>But if thou shou'dst that bliss deny,</L>
<L>Then must thy faithful lover die;</L>
<L>Or linger out his life and pine,</L>
<L>For lovely Mary of the Tyne.</L>

<HEAD>THE MAID OF THE ROCK.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>I SAT out one eve, with intention to roam,</L>
<L>To the Rock, where the surges wantonly play,</L>
<L>When the owl had stol'n out from his secret home,</L>
<L>And bright-vested Hesperus clos'd in the day.</L>
<L>The moon was at full, and with dignity rose,</L>
<L>And tissu'd with silver the green-mantl'd seas,</L>
<L>The God of the ocean was gone to repose,</L>
<L>And Aeolus fann'd with a whispering breeze.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On reaching the cave where old legends report,</L>
<L>And many a sorrowful tale has been sung,</L>
<L>Where blood-hunting robbers have oft held their court,</L>
<L>On each side was some vestige of chivalry hung;</L>
<L>My eyes were alarm'd on beholding a maid,</L>
<L>Who, near to the cavern, sat silent in grief,</L>
<L>Her head on her hand all in sorrow was laid,</L>
<L>A hard rocky pillow was all her relief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She started with fear, and she fain would have fled,</L>
<L>I begg'd her to stay and her sorrows relate,</L>
<L>Then told her, from me, she had nothing to dread,</L>
<L>That I was sent there by the order of fate,—</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="14"/>You came by the order of one, she reply'd,</L>
<L>Who has done all she can to distract my poor mind,</L>
<L>O'er-whelm'd in the deep, my dear William, my pride,</L>
<L>Then sunk, and she gave her last breath to the wind!</L>

<HEAD>THE AFFECTIONATE SOLDIER.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>'TWAS in the ev'ning of a wint'ry day,</L>
<L>When safe returning from a long campaign,</L>
<L>Allen o'er-toil'd and weary with the way,</L>
<L>Came home to see his Sally once again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His batter'd arms he carelessly threw down,</L>
<L>And view'd his Sally with enraptur'd eyes,</L>
<L>But she receiv'd him with a modest frown,</L>
<L>She knew not Allen in his rough disguise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His hair was knotted, and his beard unshorn,</L>
<L>His tatter'd 'coutrements about him hung;</L>
<L>A tear of pleasure did each cheek adorn,</L>
<L>And blessings fell in torrents from his tongue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Am I so alter'd by this cruel trade,</L>
<L>That you your faithful Allen have forgot?</L>
<L>Or is your heart unto another stray'd?</L>
<L>Ah!—why escap'd I from the murd'ring shot?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When thus he spake, her wonted colour fled,</L>
<L>She ran and sunk upon her Allen's breast,</L>
<L>All pale, awhile, she look'd like one that's dead,</L>
<L>He kiss'd, she breath'd, and all her love confess'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yes, my delight—tho' alter'd as thou art,</L>
<L>Reduc'd by honest courage to this state,</L>
<L>Thou art the golden treasure of my heart,</L>

<HEAD>SEQUEL TO POLL OF PLYMOUTH.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN Edward first heard Poll of Plymouth was dead,</L>
<L>The functions of life made a pause,</L>
<L>His piteous eyes stood aghast in his head,</L>
<L>His ship-mates enquir'd the cause;</L>
<L>Reviving awhile, he address'd them around,</L>
<L>His hand closely press'd on his heart,</L>
<L>Within this sad letter at once I have found,</L>
<L>The spectre of death and his dart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It tells that my dear Poll of Plymouth is dead,</L>
<L>My comfort, my joy, and my wife,</L>
<L>When I was torn from her, she flew to her bed,</L>
<L>And sighing, resign'd her dear life.</L>
<L>He fancy'd he saw his dear Poll in the clouds;</L>
<L>Ah, stay for poor Edward he cries,</L>
<L>Then, swift as his fancy, he ran up the shrouds,</L>
<L>And eagerness flash'd in his eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He call'd for all hands, and he gave a loud shriek,</L>
<L>And now all distracted he raves;</L>
<L>Said, do you not see that my heart's sprung a leak,</L>
<L>Then threw himself into the waves.</L>
<L>All hands were employ'd to prevent his sad fate,</L>
<L>And the long-boat was put out in vain,</L>
<L>That drags him aboard, but, alas, 'twas too late,</L>
<L>For he never once breathed again!</L>

<HEAD>THE SHIPWRECKED BOY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>'TWAS near a rock, within a bay,</L>
<L>Where many a shatter'd vessel rides,</L>
<L>An ample cottage shelter'd lay,</L>
<L>Which overlook'd the ebbing tides;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="16"/>Its calm inhabitants would view</L>
<L>The ocean struggling with the sky,</L>
<L>When e'er the northern tempests blew,</L>
<L>Or when each wave ran mountains high.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Once at the closing of a day,</L>
<L>When angry Boreas in his rage,</L>
<L>Had clear'd the dark'ning clouds away,</L>
<L>Which caus'd a thund'ring war to wage;</L>
<L>A ship-wreck'd sea-boy, pale and spent</L>
<L>With buffeting the threat'ning waves,</L>
<L>Straight to the peaceful cottage went,</L>
<L>And, bending low, for succour craves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He told his tale with feeble voice,</L>
<L>For he'd a heart that could not feign;</L>
<L>The list'ning hearers all rejoice,</L>
<L>That he was safe on land again.</L>
<L>The parents and the children strove,</L>
<L>Who now should first his wants supply,</L>
<L>While pity caus'd each heart to move,</L>
<L>And sympathy fill'd ev'ry eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The can was fill'd, the fire was made,</L>
<L>To cheer and dry their drenched guest,</L>
<L>For each brought something to his aid,</L>
<L>And anxiously the boy caress'd;</L>
<L>At length reviv'd, express'd his mind,</L>
<L>And shew'd his gratitude so plain,</L>
<L>Forgot the thunder and the wind,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to try the sea again.</L>

<HEAD>THE SHIPWRECKED BOY AT HOME.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE goddess of war threw her spear on the ground,</L>
<L>And Peace wav'd her olive-branch gracefully round,</L>
<L>A stillness now reign'd o'er the wide-spreading main,</L>
<L>The Syrens began a melodious strain;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="17"/>The ship-wrecked sea-boy his troubles forgot,</L>
<L>The yawn of the waves and the whistling shot,</L>
<L>His dear native home strongly press'd on his mind,</L>
<L>His parents and sisters so loving and kind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He hurry'd fast on with his heart all elate,</L>
<L>To embrace them around, and his story relate,</L>
<L>His hard-earned wages he long'd to divide,</L>
<L>'Mongst those that he lov'd near his own fire-side;</L>
<L>But when he arriv'd, say what pen can express</L>
<L>The genial delight, the joy in excess;</L>
<L>So welcome at home was this brave little guest,</L>
<L>You'd have thought that their welcoming ne'er would have ceas'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He hail'd 'em around, and he smiled with glee,</L>
<L>Cry'd, hold out your hands, take this present from me;</L>
<L>A fine silken 'kerchief, each neck to enfold,</L>

<L>The love which modesty forbad,</L>
<L>That she should shew to me,</L>
<L>The doubts which often made me sad,</L>
<L>Were chang'd to exstacy!</L>

<L>I ran and knelt at Ellen's feet,</L>

<L>I wip'd the precious gem away,</L>
