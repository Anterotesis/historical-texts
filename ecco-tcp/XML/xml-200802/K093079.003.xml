<L>THE balmy Zephyrs o'er the woodland stray,</L>
<L>And gently stir the bosom of the lake:</L>
<L>The fawns that panting in the covert lay,</L>
<L>Now thro' the bloomy park their revels take.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pale rise the rugged hills that skirt the North,</L>
<L>The wood glows yellow by the evening rays,</L>
<L>Silent and beauteous flows the silver Forth,</L>
<L>And Aman murmuring thro' the willows strays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<L>But ah! what means this silence in the grove,</L>
<L>Where oft the wild-notes sooth'd the love-sick boy?</L>
<L>Why cease in Mary's bower the songs of Love,</L>
<L>The songs of Love, of Innocence, and Joy?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When bright the lake reflects the setting ray,</L>
<L>The sportive virgins tread the flowery green;</L>
<L>And by the moon, full oft in chearful May,</L>
<L>The merry bride-maids at the dance are seen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But who these Nymphs that thro' the copse appear</L>
<L>In robes of white adorn'd with violet blue?</L>
<L>Fondly with purple flowers they deck yon bier,</L>
<L>And wave in solemn pomp the boughs of yew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Supreme in grief, her eye confus'd with woe,</L>
<L>Appears the Lady of th' aërial train,</L>
<L>Tall as the sylvan Goddess of the bow,</L>
<L>And fair as she who wept Adonis slain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such was the pomp when Gilead's virgin band,</L>
<L>Wandering by Judah's flowery mountains, wept,</L>
<L>And with fair Iphis by the hallowed strand</L>
<L>Of Siloe's brook a mournful sabbath kept.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By the resplendent cross with thistles twin'd,</L>
<L>'Tis Mary's Guardian Genius lost in woe:</L>
<L>" Ah say, what deepest wrongs have thus combin'd</L>
<L>" To heave with restless sighs thy breast of snow!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
<L>" Oh stay, ye Dryads, nor unfinish'd fly</L>
<L>" Your solemn rites; here comes no foot profane:</L>
<L>" The Muses' son, and hallowed is his eye,</L>
<L>" Implores your stay, implores to join the strain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" See, from her cheek the glowing life-blush flies;</L>
<L>" Alas, what faultering sounds of woe be these!</L>
<L>" Ye Nymphs, who fondly watch her languid eyes,</L>
<L>" Oh say, what music will her soul appease!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Resound the solemn dirge, the Nymphs reply,</L>
<L>" And let the turtles moan in Mary's bower,</L>
<L>" Let Grief indulge her grand sublimity,</L>
<L>" And Melancholy wake her melting power:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" For Art has triumph'd; Art, that never stood</L>
<L>" On Honour's side, or generous transport knew,</L>
<L>" Has dy'd its haggard hands in Mary's blood,</L>
<L>" And o'er her fame has breath'd its blighting dew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" But come, ye Nymphs, ye woodland Spirits, come,</L>
<L>" And with funereal flowers your tresses braid,</L>
<L>" While in this hallowed grove we raise the tomb,</L>
<L>" And consecrate the song to Mary's shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" O sing what smiles her youthful morning wore,</L>
<L>" Her's every charm, and every liveliest grace;</L>
<L>" When Nature's happiest touch could add no more,</L>
<L>" Heaven lent an angel's beauty to her face.</L>

<L>" O! whether by the moss grown bushy dell,</L>
<L>" Where from the oak depends the misletoe,</L>
<L>" Where creeping ivy shades the Druid's cell,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Or whether sportive o'er the cowslip beds,</L>
<L>" You thro' the haunted dales of Mona glide,</L>
<L>" Or brush the upland lea, when Cynthia sheds</L>
<L>" Her silvery light on Snowdon's hoary side:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Hither, ye gentle Guardians of the Fair,</L>
<L>" By Virtue's tears, by weeping Beauty, come;</L>
<L>" Unbind the festive robes, unbind the hair,</L>
<L>" And wave the cypress bough at Mary's tomb.</L>

<LG>
<L>" And come, ye fleet Magicians of the air,</L>
<L>" The mournful Lady of the chorus cry'd,</L>
<L>" Your airy tints of baleful hue prepare,</L>
<L>" And thro' this grove bid Mary's fortunes glide:</L>

<LG>
<L>" And let the song with solemn harping join'd,</L>
<L>" And wailing notes unfold the tale of woe."</L>
<L>She spoke, and waking thro' the breathing wind</L>
<L>From lyres unseen the solemn harpings flow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The song began: "How bright her early morn!</L>

<L>The hinds are seen in arms, and glittering spears</L>

Suffice it only to observe, that the following facts may be proved to demonstration: The Letters, which have been always esteemed as the principal proof of Queen Mary's guilt, are forged: Buchanan, on whose authority Thuanus and other historians have condemned her, has fal∣sified several circumstances of her history, and has cited against her public records which never existed: And, to add no more; The treatment she received from her illustrious Cousin was dictated by a policy truly Machia∣velian, which trampled on the obligations of Honour, of Humanity, and Morality. From whence it may be inferred, That, to express the indignation at the cruel treatment of Mary which History must ever inspire, and to drop a tear on her sufferings, is not unworthy of a writer who would appear in the cause of Virtue.</NOTE>.</L>

<LG>
<L>IN antient days, when Arthur reign'd,</L>
<L>Sir Elmer had no peer!</L>
<L>And no young knight in all the land</L>
<L>The ladies lov'd so dear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His sister Mey, the fairest maid</L>
<L>Of all the virgin train,</L>
<L>Won every heart at Arthur's court,</L>
<L>But all their love was vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain they lov'd, in vain they vow'd,</L>
<L>Her heart they could not move:</L>
<L>Yet at the evening hour of prayer</L>
<L>Her mind was lost in love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Abbess saw, the Abbess knew,</L>
<L>And urg'd her to explain;</L>
<L>" O name the gentle youth to me,</L>
<L>" And his consent I'll gain."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
<L>Long urg'd, long vext, fair Mey reply'd,</L>
<L>" His name how can I say?</L>
<L>" An angel from the fields above</L>
<L>" Has rapt my heart away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" But once, alas, and never more,</L>
<L>" His lovely form I spied,</L>
<L>" One evening by the sounding shore,</L>
<L>" All by the greenwood side:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" His eyes to mine the love confest,</L>
<L>" That glow'd with mildest grace:</L>
<L>" His courtly mien and purple vest</L>
<L>" Bespoke his princely race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" But when he heard my brother's horn</L>
<L>" Fast to his ships he fled:</L>
<L>" Yet while I sleep his graceful form</L>
<L>" Still hovers round my bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Sometimes all clad in armour bright,</L>
<L>" He shakes a warlike lance;</L>
<L>" And now in courtly garments dight,</L>
<L>" He leads the sprightly dance,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" His hair is black as raven's wing,</L>
<L>" His skin as Christmas snow,</L>
<L>" His cheeks outvie the blush of morn,</L>
<L>" His lips like rose-buds glow.</L>

<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
<L>" His limbs, his arms, his stature, shap'd</L>
<L>" By Nature's finest hand;</L>
<L>" His sparkling eyes declare him born</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The live-long year fair Mey bemoan'd</L>
<L>Her hopeless pining love:</L>
<L>But when the balmy Spring return'd,</L>
<L>And Summer cloath'd the grove;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All round by pleasant Humber side</L>
<L>The Saxon banners flew,</L>
<L>And to Sir Elmer's castle gates</L>
<L>The spear-men came in view.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fair blush'd the morn when Mey look'd o'er</L>
<L>The castle-wall so sheen;</L>
<L>And, lo, the warlike Saxon youth</L>
<L>Were sporting on the green.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There Hengist, Offa's eldest son,</L>
<L>Lean'd on his burnish'd lance,</L>
<L>And all the armed youth around</L>
<L>Obey'd his manly glance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His locks as black as raven's wing</L>
<L>Adown his shoulders flow'd,</L>
<L>His cheeks outvied the blush of morn,</L>
<L>His lips like rose-buds glow'd,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
<L>And soon the lovely form of Mey</L>
<L>Has caught his piercing eyes:</L>
<L>He gives the sign, his bands retire,</L>
<L>While big with love he sighs,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Oh thou, for whom I dar'd the seas,</L>
<L>" And come with peace or war;</L>
<L>" Oh, by that cross that veils thy breast,</L>
<L>" Relieve thy Lover's care!</L>

<L>" For thee I'll quit my father's throne,</L>
<L>" With thee the wilds explore;</L>
<L>" Or with thee share the British crown,</L>

<L>Beneath the timorous virgin blush,</L>
<L>With love's soft warmth she glows:</L>
<L>So blushing thro' the dews of morn</L>
<L>Appears the opening rose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas now the hour of morning prayer,</L>
<L>When men their sins bewail,</L>
<L>That Elmer heard king Arthur's horn</L>
<L>Shrill sounding thro' the dale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The pearly tears from Mey's bright eyes</L>
<L>Like April dew drops fell,</L>
<L>When with a parting dear embrace</L>
<L>Her brother bade farewell.</L>

<L>He join'd king Arthur's train.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Full forty thousand Saxon spears</L>
<L>Came glittering down the hill,</L>
<L>And with their shouts and clang of arms</L>
<L>The distant valleys fill.</L>

<LG>
<L>Old Offa, drest in Odin's garb,</L>
<L>Assum'd the hoary god;</L>
<L>And Hengist, like the warlike Thor,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>With dreadful rage the combat burns,</L>
<L>The captains shout amain;</L>
<L>And Elmer's tall victorious spear</L>

<LG>
<L>To stop its course young Hengist flew</L>
<L>Like lightning o'er the field;</L>

<L>On his imagin'd rival's steed</L>
<L>With furious force he prest,</L>

<L>Resounds on Elmer's crest.</L>

<LG>
<L>The foe gave way, the princely youth</L>
<L>With heedless rage pursu'd,</L>
<L>Till trembling in his cloven helm</L>
<L>Sir Elmer's javelin stood.</L>

<LG>
<L>He bow'd his head, slow dropt his spear,</L>
<L>The reins slipt through his hand,</L>
<L>And stain'd with blood, his stately corse</L>
<L>Lay breathless on the strand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" O bear me off," Sir Elmer cried,</L>

<L>" The combat swims—Yet Hengist's vest</L>
<L>" I claim as victor's right."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Brave Hengist's fall the Saxons saw,</L>

<L>Had been his hermitage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His mantle grey flow'd loose behind,</L>
<L>His snowy beard wav'd to the wind,</L>

<L>His broad bald front gave dignity,</L>
<L>Attention mark'd his lively eye,</L>
<L>And peace smil'd in his face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He beckon'd with his wrinkled hand,</L>
<L>My ear was all at his command;</L>

<L>So plant the vine on Norway's wintery land,</L>

<L>The lonely shepherd on the mountain's side,</L>

<LG>
<L>Oh that some kind, some pitying kindred shade,</L>

<L>But let me from the tender theme refrain,</L>
<L>While every word but sharpens every pain;</L>
<L>For when the hand that wounds would heal the fore,</L>
<L>The generous heart will only bleed the more.</L>
<L>My latest breath for thee a prayer shall sigh,</L>

<L>FRIEND to the wretch, whom every friend forsakes,</L>
<L>I woo thee, Death! In Fancy's fairy paths</L>
<L>Let the gay Songster rove, and gently trill</L>
<L>The strain of empty joy.—Life and its joys</L>
<L>I leave to those that prize them.—At this hour,</L>
<L>This solemn hour, when Silence rules the world,</L>
<L>And wearied Nature makes a general pause!</L>
<L>Wrapt in Night's sable robe, through cloysters drear</L>
<L>And charnels pale, tenanted by a throng</L>
<L>Of meagre phantoms shooting cross my path</L>
<L>With silent glance, I seek the shadowy vale</L>
<L>Of Death.—Deep in a murky cave's recess</L>
<L>Lav'd by Oblivion's listless stream, and fenc'd</L>
<L>By shelving rocks and intermingled horrors</L>
<L>Of yew' and cypress' shade from all intrusion</L>
<L>Of busy noontide-beam, the Monarch sits</L>
<L>In unsubstantial Majesty enthron'd.</L>
<L>At his right hand, nearest himself in place</L>
<L>And frightfulness of form, his parent Sin</L>
<L>With fatal industry and cruel care</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="52"/>
Busies herself in pointing all his stings,</L>
<L>And tipping every shaft with venom drawn</L>
<L>From her infernal store: around him rang'd</L>
<L>In terrible array and strange diversity</L>
<L>Of uncouth shapes, stand his dread Ministers:</L>
<L>Foremost Old Age, his natural ally</L>
<L>And firmest friend: next him diseases thick,</L>
<L>A motley train; Fever with cheek of fire;</L>
<L>Consumption wan; Palsy, half warm with life,</L>
<L>And half a clay-cold lump; joint-torturing Gout,</L>
<L>And ever-gnawing Rheum; Convulsion wild;</L>
<L>Swol'n Dropsy; panting Asthma; Apoplex</L>
<L>Full-gorg'd.—There too the Pestilence that walks</L>
<L>In darkness, and the Sickness that destroys</L>
<L>At broad noon-day. These and a thousand more,</L>

<L>Ah! why, All-Righteous Father, didst thou make</L>

<L>If this the Lot of Being!—Was it for this</L>
<L>Thy Breath divine kindled within his breast</L>
<L><PB N="51" REF="53"/>
The vital flame? For this was thy fair image</L>
<L>Stampt on his soul in godlike lineaments?</L>
<L>For this dominion given him absolute</L>
<L>O'er all thy creatures, only that he might reign</L>
<L>Supreme in woe? From the blest source of Good</L>
<L>Could Pain and Death proceed? Could such foul Ills</L>
<L>Fall from fair Mercy's hands? Far be the thought,</L>
<L>The impious thought! God never made a Creature</L>
<L>But what was good. He made a living Man:</L>
<L>The Man of Death was made by Man himself.</L>
<L>Forth from his Maker's hands he sprung to life,</L>
<L>Fresh with immortal bloom; No pain he knew,</L>
<L>No fear of death, no check to his desires</L>
<L>Save one command. That one command (which stood</L>
<L>'Twixt him and ruin, the test of his obedience,)</L>
<L>Urg'd on by wanton curiosity</L>
<L>He broke.—There in one moment was undone</L>
<L>The fairest of God's works. The same rash hand</L>
<L>That pluck'd in evil hour the fatal fruit,</L>
<L>Unbarr'd the gates of Hell, and let loose Sin</L>
<L>And Death and all the family of Pain</L>
<L>To prey upon Mankind. Young Nature saw</L>
<L>The monstrous crew, and shook thro' all her frame.</L>
<L>Then fled her new-born lustre, then begar.</L>
<L>Heaven's chearful face to low'r, then vapours choak'd</L>
<L>The troubled air, and form'd a veil of clouds</L>
<L>To hide the willing Sun. The Earth convuls'd</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="54"/>
With painful throes threw forth a bristly crop</L>
<L>Of thorns and briars; and Insect, Bird, and Beast,</L>
<L>That wont before with admiration fond</L>
<L>To gaze at Man, and fearless croud around him,</L>
<L>Now fled before his face, shunning in haste</L>
<L>Th' infection of his misery. He alone,</L>
<L>Who justly might, th' offended Lord of Man,</L>
<L>Turn'd not away his face, he full of pity</L>
<L>Forsook not in this uttermost distress</L>
<L>His best-lov'd work. That comfort still remain'd,</L>

<L>Rang'd unreprov'd and free, shall sink appall'd,</L>
<L>I sing adventurous.—But what eye can pierce</L>
<L>The vast immeasurable realms of space</L>
<L>O'er which Messiah drives his flaming car</L>
<L>To that bright region, where enthron'd he sits</L>
<L>First-born of heaven, to judge assembled worlds,</L>
<L>Cloath'd in celestial radiance! Can the Muse,</L>
<L>Her feeble wing all damp with earthly dew,</L>
<L>Soar to that bright empyreal, where around,</L>
<L>Myriads of angels, God's perpetual choir,</L>
<L>Hymn Halelujah's; and in concert loud</L>
<L>Chaunt songs of triumph to their Maker's praise?—</L>
<L>Yet will I strive to sing, albeit unus'd</L>
<L>To tread poetic soil. What tho' the wiles</L>

That thro' her vallies weave their mazy way;</L>
<L>Or climb her mountain tops; yet will I raise</L>
<L>My feeble voice to tell what harmony</L>
<L>(Sweet as the music of the rolling spheres)</L>
<L>Attunes the moral world: that Virtue still</L>
<L>May hope her promis'd crown; that Vice may dread</L>
<L>Vengeance, tho' late; that reasoning Pride may own</L>

Or joy on secret good? Why conscience acts</L>
<L>With tenfold force, when sickness, age, or pain,</L>
<L>Stands tottering on the precipice of Death?</L>
<L>Or why such horror gnaws the guilty soul</L>
<L>Of dying sinners; while the good man sleeps</L>
<L>Peaceful and calm, and with a smile expires?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Look round the world, with what a partial hand</L>
<L>The scale of bliss and misery is sustain'd!</L>
<L>Beneath the shade of cold obscurity</L>
<L>Pale Virtue lies! no arm supports her head,</L>
<L>No friendly voice speaks comfort to her soul,</L>
<L>Nor soft-ey'd Pity drops a melting tear;</L>
<L>But, in their stead, Contempt and rude Disdain</L>
<L>Insult the banish'd wanderer: on she goes</L>
<L>Neglected and forlorn: Disease, and Cold,</L>
<L>And Famine, worst of ills, her steps attend:</L>
<L>Yet patient, and to heaven's just will resign'd,</L>

<L>Nor think for these he pays the tribute due</L>

Sinks in the universal ruin lost.—</L>
<L>No more shall planets round their central sun</L>

<L>Spangling the golden canopy of night,</L>

<L>Call'd from their wonderous height, to read their names</L>
<L>And magnitude, some winged minister</L>
<L>Shall quench; and (surest sign that all on earth</L>
<L>Is lost) shall rend from heaven the mystic bow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such is that awful, that tremendous day,</L>
<L>Whose coming who shall tell? for as a thief</L>
<L>Unheard, unseen, it steals with silent pace</L>
<L>Thro' night's dark gloom.—Perhaps as here I sit</L>
<L>And rudely carol these incondite lays,</L>
<L>Soon shall the hand be check'd, and dumb the mouth</L>
<L>That lisps the faultering strain.—O! may it ne'er</L>
<L>Intrude unwelcome on an ill-spent hour;</L>
<L>But find me wrapt in meditations high,</L>
<L>Hymning my great Creator!</L>
<L>" Power supreme!</L>
<L>" O Everlasting King! to thee I kneel,</L>
<L>" To thee I lift my voice. With fervent heat</L>
<L>" Melt all ye elements? And thou, high heaven,</L>
<L>" Shrink, like a shrivell'd scroll? But think, O Lord,</L>
<L>" Think on the best, the noblest of thy works;</L>
<L>" Think on thine own bright Image! Think on him,</L>

<HEAD>TO A LADY GOING TO BATHE IN THE SEA.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY GEORGE KEATE, ESQ.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>VENUS, most histories agree,</L>
<L>Sprung from the ferment of the sea;</L>
<L>Yet I confess I'm always loth</L>
<L>To think such beauty was but froth,</L>
<L>Or that the ocean, which more odd is,</L>
<L>Should from a bubble spawn a Goddess:</L>
<L>Tho' hence, my Laura, learned fellows</L>
<L>Of such its wonderous powers still tell us,</L>
<L>That every mother brings her daughter</L>
<L>To dip in this specific water,</L>
<L>Expecting from the briny wave</L>
<L>Charms which it once to Venus gave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These charms, my Laura, strive to gain;</L>
<L>And that you may not bathe in vain,</L>
<L>I'll here, as well as I am able,</L>
<L>Give you a Moral to this Fable.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Would you a Goddess reign o'er all?</L>
<L>From the wide flood its virtues call.</L>
<L><PB N="73" REF="75"/>
Free from each stain thy bosom keep,</L>
<L>Clear be it as this azure deep,</L>
<L>Which no capricious passion knows,</L>
<L>But duly ebbs, and duly flows;</L>
<L>Tho' sometimes ruffled, calm'd as soon,</L>
<L>Still constant to its faithful moon,</L>
<L>At whose approach with pride it swells,</L>
<L>And to each shore its chaste love tells:</L>
<L>Heedless of every change of weather,</L>
<L>That wafts a straw, or coxcomb feather,</L>
<L>Which only on the surface play,</L>
<L>And unobserv'd are wash'd away.</L>
</LG>

<L>Reflect, that lodg'd within its breast</L>
<L>The modest pearl delights to rest,</L>
<L>While every gem to Neptune known,</L>
<L>Is there with partial bounty sown.—</L>

<L>Each sparkling charm, each blushing grace;</L>
<L>To these let judgment value give,</L>

<BYLINE>BY THE SAME.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THE Bard whose scenes this night your thoughts engage,</L>
<L>Has somewhere told us, <HI>All the world's a stage,</HI></L>
<L>Where all in one great farce their talents try,</L>
<L>Are born, love, wed, grow covetous,—and die.</L>
<L>From hence I think we fairly may infer,</L>
<L>That NATURE is, or should be <HI>manager;</HI></L>
<L>And yet in NATURE's spite, we every day</L>
<L><HI>Cast cur own parts</HI> ourselves, and spoil her play;</L>
<L>Some vain conceit disturbs her sober plan,</L>
<L>And ART debauches that strange creature, man:</L>
<L>Hence, ere Life's <HI>curtain drops,</HI> this truth is plain,</L>
<L>That few, the characters they take, sustain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See, CATO-like, in Freedom's boasted cause</L>
<L>The maddening PATRIOT raves of dying Laws;</L>
<L>With ready lash pursues the venal tribe:</L>
<L>But what's the sequel?—<HI>Exit</HI> with a bribe.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
<L>Not less a Player the METHODIST appears:</L>
<L>In some hir'd barn his casual stage he rears;</L>
<L>Prophane, loquacious, insolent, and loud,</L>
<L>The grave <HI>Jack-Pudding</HI> of a sniveling crowd,</L>
<L>Who promis'd heaven in change for pence receive;</L>
<L>For those who teach <HI>to die,</HI> know how <HI>to live.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The PRUDE austere, who shuns each forward spark,</L>
<L>Meets less reserv'd her footman in the dark;</L>
<L>The gay COQUET, the COXCOMB, and the WIT,</L>
<L>Across Life's stage like airy phantoms flit,</L>
<L>Applause nor pity sure their parts command:</L>
<L>The mark of scorn let <HI>Affectation</HI> stand!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If, then, the <HI>finish'd</HI> man can sometimes err,</L>
<L>And make mistakes on the World's Theatre,</L>
<L>Desert himself, as various passions call,</L>
<L>And prove at last no character at all;</L>
<L>We ask your candour, if in us appears</L>
<L>Th' <HI>imperfect</HI> growth of unexperienc'd years;</L>
<L>Tho' buds, yet Learning like the sun has power</L>
<L>To rear the stem, and paint the future flower!</L>
<L>If JOHN should not each stroke of guilt impart,</L>
<L>Nor CONSTANCE triumph o'er the feeling heart,</L>
<L>Think, in Life's happy morn we cannot know</L>
<L>The sad extent of baseness or of woe!</L>
<L>Boys as we are, to us each scene is new,</L>
<L>If sometimes wrong, e'en there we copy <HI>you:</HI></L>
<L>To bold attempts be then indulgence shewn,</L>
<L>And learn to pity faults so like your own.</L>

<L>SPITE of court tricks, of sorrow, madness, pain,</L>

<L>O Ladies! what cannot our sex perform?—</L>
<L>A bustling woman lives thro' every storm.</L>
<L>Have I not dash'd my character with spirit?</L>
<L>To bully <HI>two such Kings</HI> was no small merit.</L>
<L>Around the world to find the wretch I'd search,</L>
<L>Who dares to leave a woman in the lurch.—</L>
<L>My son the dupe of regal baseness made,</L>
<L>Myself amus'd by hopes, cajol'd, betray'd,</L>
<L>My jointure lost, a widow, and not young,</L>
<L>I had no weapon left me but my tongue—</L>

<L>That play'd her philosophic husband mute:</L>

<L>Her rival, and subdue great ALEXANDER?—</L>
<L>What gifts of speech had EGYPT's QUEEN to boast,</L>
<L>Who talk'd till ANTONY <HI>the world well lost!</HI></L>
<L>Think of the Maid of ORLEANS, JOAN of ARC,</L>
<L>There was an enterprizing, female spark!</L>
<L>Whole armies she harangued, whole hosts withstood;</L>
<L>Her tongue was surely more than flesh and blood!</L>
<L>Tho' last, not least shall BESS of ENGLAND stand,</L>
<L>Who box'd her courtiers with her own fair hand,</L>
<L>To female rules profess'd a brave dislike,</L>
<L>Her majesty could swear as well as strike.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ladies! might I advise, let's urge our power,</L>
<L>Dethrone usurping man, and take him lower;</L>
<L>He'd only have us learn the gentle arts</L>
<L>Of studying graces, and subduing hearts:</L>

<L>Yet tho' in other clime I rest remote,</L>

<L>And flies, unfetter'd, CAVENDISH, to thee.</L>

<L>Thou dear companion of my better days,</L>

<L>When, leagu'd with patriots, we maintain'd the cause</L>
<L>Of true religion, liberty, and laws,</L>
<L>Disdaining down the golden stream to glide,</L>

No: view me firm, unshaken, undismay'd,</L>
<L>As when the welcome mandate I obey'd—</L>
<L>Heavens! with what pride that moment I recall!</L>
<L>Who would not wish, so honour'd, thus to fall!</L>
<L>When England's Genius, hovering o'er, inspir'd</L>
<L>Her chosen sons, with love of Freedom fir'd,</L>
<L>Spite of an abject, servile, pension'd train,</L>
<L>Minions of Power, and worshippers of Gain,</L>
<L>To save from Bigotry its destin'd prey,</L>
<L>And shield three nations from tyrannick sway.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas then my CA'NDISH caught the glorious flame,</L>

<L>Warm from the heart, and to the heart address'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Justice prevail'd; yes Justice, let me say,</L>
<L>Well pois'd her scales on that auspicious day.</L>
<L>The watchful shepherd spies the wolf afar,</L>
<L>Nor trusts his flock to try the unequal war;</L>
<L>What tho' the savage crouch in humble guise,</L>
<L>And check the fire that flashes from his eyes,</L>
<L>Should once his barbarous fangs the fold invade,</L>
<L>Vain were their cries, too late the shepherd's aid,</L>

Thirsting for blood, he knows not how to spare,</L>

<L>Now, Memory, fail! nor let my mind revolve,</L>

<L>When Conscience bares her horrors, and the dread</L>

<L>Wrings his black soul; when injured nations groan,</L>

<L>Shall flattering churchmen soothe his guilty ears,</L>

<L>My MARY ANNE is twenty one.</L>
<L>Of days still shorter just a Lent,</L>
<L>Patch'd up from different years, is spent,</L>

<L>Bending beneath the weight of years,</L>
<L>Full as infirm as he appears,</L>

<L>For such a phrenzy no defence is—</L>

<L>Perhaps deceiv'd by some fond notion,</L>
<L>Embrac'd in rapture of devotion,</L>
<L>(I quote such fancies to expose 'em)</L>
<L>She dreams of bliss in Abraham's bosom;</L>
<L>And chuses an Antique the rather,</L>

My faithful flame her heart approves;</L>
<L>And O! transporting thought! she loves.</L>

<L>When Souls, by impulse sympathetick,</L>

<L>By feelings, which they cannot smother,</L>
<L>Leap at first glance to meet each other,</L>
<L>When each itself in t'other traces,</L>
<L>What matter for their different cases?</L>
<L>Of kin, perhaps, in pre-existence,</L>
<L>Without dull Reason's slow assistance,</L>
<L>They recollect the happy union,</L>
<L>And long to recommence communion.</L>
<L>I must confess that such attraction,</L>
<L>For ease, convenience, satisfaction,</L>
<L>Were best if, on deliberation,</L>
<L>It met with Reason's approbation:</L>
<L>Not as of absolute dominion,</L>
<L>To rule by dint of dark opinion;</L>
<L>Not as a Lord of sovereign sway,</L>
<L>Whom love must worship and obey;</L>
<L>But merely as the herd inferior</L>
<L>May judge the acts of Powers superior;</L>
<L>As my poor intellect, or thine,</L>
<L>May scan authority divine—</L>
<L>In short, I'd have our simple love,</L>
<L>Not <HI>against</HI> reason, but <HI>above.</HI></L>

<L>Far happier I, who well could spare,</L>

<L>Though every hour should steal a charm—</L>
<L>Long ere, by twenty stars a day,</L>
<L>The spangled Heavens would wear away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unconscious of the gradual wane,</L>
<L>As years their empire slowly gain,</L>

And limbs grow cold, and senses faulter,</L>

<L>HIGH o'er the bed, conspicuous seen,</L>

<L>THE shrinking brooks and russet meads complain'd</L>
<L>That Summer's tyrant, fervid Sirius, reign'd;</L>
<L>Full west the sun from heaven descending rode,</L>
<L>And six the shadow on the dial show'd.</L>
<L>Philo, tho' young, to musing much inclin'd,</L>
<L>A shameless sloven, in his gown had din'd,</L>
<L>From table sneaking with a sheepish face,</L>
<L>Before the circle was dismiss'd with grace,</L>
<L>And smoaking now, his desk with books o'erspread,</L>
<L>Thick clouds of incense roll around his head:</L>
<L>His head, which save a quarter's growth of hair,</L>
<L>His woollen cap long since scratch'd off, was bare:</L>
<L>His beard three days had grown, of golden hue,</L>
<L>Black was his shirt, uncomely to the view;</L>
<L>Cross-legg'd he sat, and his ungartered hose</L>

<L>His cheek he lean'd upon his hand; below</L>

Now mere privation fails the wings of thought,</L>

<L>Matter thro' modes and qualities pursues,</L>

<L>Like wave by wave impell'd, now questions roll—</L>
<L>Does soul in ought subsist, or all in soul?</L>
<L>Is space, extension, nothing but a name,</L>
<L>And mere idea Nature's mighty frame?</L>

<L>The mingling colours of the rich brocade;</L>
<L>This aiding fancy, blending shame and pride,</L>
<L>Inflames with beauties it was meant to hide:</L>
<L>With careless ease the Nymph first snapp'd her fan,</L>

<L>" For this, when Cloe goes at twelve to bed,</L>

<L><PB N="229" REF="231"/>
" No wonder then, in vain my skill's employ'd</L>

<L>" These tears my witness, which your pride disdains;</L>
<L>" These tears, at once my witness and relief."</L>

<LG>
<L>He, who had often, and alone, o'erturn'd</L>
<L>Witlings, and sophists, when his fury burn'd,</L>
<L>Now yields to love the fortress of his soul:</L>
<L>His eyes with vengeance on ARACHNE roll:</L>
<L>" Curs'd wretch, thou poisonous quintessence of ill,</L>
<L>" Those precious drops, unpunish'd, shalt thou spill?"</L>
<L>He said, and stooping, from his foot he drew,</L>
<L>Black as his purpose, what was once a shoe;</L>
<L>Now, high in air the fatal heel ascends,</L>
<L>Reason's last effort now the stroke suspends;</L>
<L>In doubt he stood—when, breath'd from Cloe's breast,</L>
<L>A struggling sigh her inward grief exprest.</L>
<L>Fir'd by the sound, "Die, sorceress, die," he cried,</L>
<L>And to his arm his utmost strength applied:</L>
<L>Crush'd falls the foe, one complicated wound,</L>
<L>And the smote shelf returns a jarring sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="230" REF="232"/>
<L>On Ida's top thus Venus erst prevail'd,</L>
<L>When all the sapience of Minerva fail'd:</L>
<L>Thus to like arts a prey, as poets tell,</L>
<L>By Juno lov'd in vain, great Dido fell.</L>
<L>And thus for ever Beauty shall controul</L>
<L>The saint's, the sage's, and the hero's soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Jove with hate beheld th' atrocious deed,</L>
<L>And Vengeance follows with tremendous speed;</L>
<L>In Philo's mind she quench'd the ray that fir'd</L>
<L>With love of science, and with verse inspir'd,</L>
<L>Expung'd at once the philosophic theme,</L>
<L>All sages think and all that poets dream;</L>
<L>Yields him thus chang'd a vassal to the fair;</L>
<L>And forth she leads him with a victor's air:</L>
<L>Drest to her wish, he mixes with the gay,</L>
<L>As much a trifle, and as vain as they;</L>
<L>To fix their power, and rivet fast the chain,</L>
<L>They lead where Pleasure spreads her soft domain;</L>
<L>Where, drown'd in music Reason's hoarser call,</L>
<L>Love smiles triumphant in thy groves, Vaux-hall.</L>

<HEAD>THE THREE WARNINGS: A TALE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MRS. THRALE.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THE tree of deepest root is found</L>
<L>Least willing still to quit the ground;</L>
<L>'Twas therefore said by antient sages,</L>
<L>That love of life increas'd with years</L>
<L>So much, that in our latter stages,</L>
<L>When pains grow sharp, and sickness rages,</L>
<L>The greatest love of life appears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This great affection to believe,</L>
<L>Which all confess, but few perceive,</L>
<L>If old assertions can't prevail,</L>
<L>Be pleas'd to hear a modern tale.</L>
<L>When sports went round, and all were gay</L>
<L>On neighbour Dobson's wedding-day,</L>
<L>Death call'd aside the jocund groom</L>
<L>With him into another room:</L>
<L>And looking grave, "You must, says he,</L>
<L>" Quit your sweet bride, and come with me."</L>
<L>" With you, and quit my Susan's side!</L>
<L>" With you! the hapless husband cry'd:</L>
<L>" Young as I am! 'tis monstrous hard!</L>
<L>" Besides, in truth, I'm not prepar'd:</L>
<L><PB N="259" REF="261"/>
" My thoughts on other matters go,</L>
<L>" This is my wedding-night, you know."</L>
<L>What more he urg'd I have not heard,</L>
<L>His reasons could not well be stronger;</L>
<L>So Death the poor delinquent spar'd,</L>
<L>And left to live a little longer.</L>
<L>Yet calling up a serious look,</L>
<L>His hour-glass trembled while he spoke,</L>
<L>" Neighbour, he said, farewell: No more</L>
<L>" Shall Death disturb your mirthful hour;</L>
<L>" And further, to avoid all blame</L>
<L>" Of cruelty upon my name,</L>
<L>" To give you time for preparation,</L>
<L>" And fit you for your future station,</L>
<L>" Three several Warnings you shall have,</L>
<L>" Before you're summon'd to the grave:</L>
<L>" Willing for once I'll quit my prey,</L>
<L>" And grant a kind reprieve;</L>
<L>" In hopes you'll have no more to say,</L>
<L>" But when I call again this way,</L>
<L>" Well-pleas'd the world will leave."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To these conditions both consented,</L>
<L>And parted perfectly contented.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What next the hero of our tale befell,</L>
<L>How long he liv'd, how wise, how well,</L>
<L>How roundly he pursu'd his course,</L>
<L>And smok'd his pipe, and strok'd his horse,</L>
<L>The willing Muse shall tell:</L>
<L><PB N="260" REF="262"/>
He chaffer'd then, he bought, he sold,</L>
<L>Nor once perceiv'd his growing old,</L>
<L>Nor thought of Death as near;</L>
<L>His friends not false, his wife no shrew,</L>
<L>Many his gains, his children few,</L>
<L>He pass'd his hours in peace;</L>
<L>But while he view'd his wealth increase,</L>
<L>While thus along Life's dusty road</L>
<L>The beaten track content he trod,</L>
<L>Old Time, whose haste no mortal spares,</L>
<L>Uncall'd, unheeded, unawares,</L>
<L>Brought on his eightieth year.</L>
</LG>

<L>And now one night in musing mood,</L>
<L>As all alone he sate,</L>
<L>Th' unwelcome messenger of Fate</L>
<L>Once more before him stood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Half kill'd with anger and surprize,</L>
<L>" So soon return'd! old Dobson cries."</L>
<L>" So soon, d'ye call it! Death replies:</L>
<L>" Surely, my friend, you're but in jest.</L>
<L>" Since I was here before,</L>
<L>" 'Tis six-and-thirty years at least,</L>
<L>" And you are now fourscore."</L>
<L>" So much the worse, the Clown rejoin'd:</L>
<L>" To spare the aged would be kind:</L>
<L>" However, see your search be legal;</L>
<L>" And your authority—Is't regal?</L>
<L>" Else you are come on a fool's errand,</L>
<L>" With but a ecretary's warrant.</L>
<L><PB N="261" REF="263"/>
" Besides, you promis'd me Three Warnings,</L>
<L>" Which I have look'd for nights and mornings.</L>
<L>" But for that loss of time and ease,</L>
<L>" I can recover damages."</L>
<L>" I know, cries Death, that at the best,</L>
<L>" I seldom am a welcome guest;</L>
<L>" But don't be captious, friend, at least;</L>
<L>" I little thought you'd still be able</L>
<L>" To stump about your farm and stable;</L>
<L>" Your years have run to a great length,</L>
<L>" I wish you joy tho' of your strength."</L>
<L>" Hold, says the Farmer, not so fast,</L>
<L>" I have been lame these four years past."</L>
<L>" And no great wonder, Death replies,</L>
<L>" However, you still keep your eyes;</L>
<L>" And sure to see one's loves and friends,</L>
<L>" For legs and arms would make amends."</L>
<L>" Perhaps, says Dobson, so it might,</L>
<L>" But latterly I've lost my sight."</L>
<L>" This is a shocking story, faith,</L>
<L>" Yet there's some comfort still, says Death;</L>
<L>" Each strives your sadness to amuse;</L>
<L>" I warrant you hear all the news."</L>
<L>" There's none, cries he; and if there were,</L>
<L>" I'm grown so deaf I could not hear."</L>
<L>" Nay then, the spectre stern rejoin'd,</L>
<L>" These are unjustifiable yearnings;</L>
<L>" If you are lame, and deaf, and blind,</L>
<L>" You've had your three sufficient Warnings.</L>
<L><PB N="262" REF="264"/>
" So come along, no more we'll part:"</L>
<L>He said, and touch'd him with his dart;</L>
<L>And now old Dobson turning pale,</L>
<L>Yields to his fate—so ends my tale.</L>

<LG>
<L>ALEXIS, the pride of the plain,</L>
<L>Beside a clear brook lay reclin'd,</L>
<L>His complaint was fair Daphne's disdain,</L>
<L>Who had prov'd to the shepherd unkind:</L>
<L>His flock was no longer his care,</L>
<L>His pipe now no longer could please,</L>
<L>He neglected his dress and his hair,</L>
<L>And by solitude fed his disease.</L>

<L>" Poor shepherd! he wildly exclaim'd,</L>
<L>" Alas! what avails all thy moan?</L>
<L>" The joys thy fond fancy had fram'd,</L>
<L>" With Daphne for ever are flown!</L>
<L>" How could you, O Daphne, deceive</L>
<L>" A swain not unworthy your love?</L>
<L>" Why didst thou, Alexis, believe</L>
<L>" Such a maid could thy passion approve?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="270" REF="272"/>
<L>" Her form is replete with each grace,</L>
<L>" The diamond beams forth in her eye,</L>
<L>" The lily expands o'er her face,</L>
<L>" And the rose-bud imparts its soft dye.</L>
<L>" No warbler can rival her song,</L>
<L>" Philomela with envy complains,</L>
<L>" The streams glide in silence along,</L>
<L>" The glad Zephyrs diffuse her soft strains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" When Daphne appear'd in the mead,</L>
<L>" Her presence enliven'd the morn,</L>
<L>" Now the winds roughly blow round my head,</L>
<L>" And the sun's chearful beams are withdrawn.</L>
<L>" No longer these meadows look green,</L>
<L>" Now the warblers abandon the grove,</L>
<L>" The air breathes no longer serene,</L>
<L>" All Summer is fled with my love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Oh! Daphne, you heard my fond sighs,</L>
<L>" You did not my passion disdain,</L>
<L>" When I gaz'd with delight on your eyes,</L>
<L>" My soft glances you did not restrain:</L>
<L>" But now you make sport of my woes,</L>
<L>" And laugh at the sufferings I feel,</L>
<L>" I enjoy not the sweets of repose,</L>
<L>" Nor can I my torments conceal!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="271" REF="273"/>
<L>" Farewell, ye sad scenes of my love,</L>
<L>" I shall never revisit you more!</L>
<L>" Adieu to the mead an he grove,</L>
<L>" 'Twas here I first learn'd to adore!</L>
<L>" I will banish this wretch from her sight,</L>

<LG>
<L>WITH a torrent of heart-bursting grief</L>
<L>Alexis continues his moan,</L>
<L>Tears gave him some little relief,</L>
<L>Yet he ceas'd not to sigh and to groan.</L>
<L>Pastora by chance hasten'd by,</L>
<L>She saw the poor shepherd's despair,</L>
<L>Soft pity appear'd in her eye,</L>
<L>She ask'd him the source of his care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" What cause has Alexis to weep?"</L>
<L>With looks of compassion, she said;</L>
<L>" Have you lost e'er a lamb or a sheep?</L>
<L>" Or is Tray the poor favourite dead?</L>
<L>" Or, perhaps, your fair Daphne's unkind,</L>
<L>" Perhaps for her coyness you grieve,</L>
<L>" Ah! 'tis jealousy poisons your mind!</L>
<L>" But appearances often deceive."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="272" REF="274"/>
<L>The shepherd just rais'd up his head,</L>
<L>He thank'd the kind maid for her care,</L>
<L>He confess'd that all comfort was fled,</L>
<L>And nothing was left but despair.</L>
<L>Pastora e'en wept at the tale,</L>
<L>And wish'd she could ease his distress;</L>
<L>Could her interest with Daphne prevail,</L>
<L>His suffering should soon find redress.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He gaz'd on the fair with surprize,</L>
<L>And admir'd the good-nature she shew'd,</L>
<L>When she went he withdrew not his eyes,</L>
<L>But with pleasure her footsteps pursu'd.</L>
<L>Her sweetness, her beauty, and truth,</L>
<L>With Daphne's late falshood compar'd,</L>
<L>So charm'd, so astonish'd the youth,</L>
<L>That his heart for a change was prepar'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet still his fond wish would arise,</L>
<L>" Ah! was but my Daphne thus kind!</L>
<L>" I would wipe off these tears from my eyes,</L>
<L>" And give up my sighs to the wind!"</L>
<L>He said, and arose from the ground,</L>
<L>Then instant return'd to his cot,</L>
<L>Soon in sleep every suffering was drown'd,</L>
<L>And Daphne's unkindness forgot.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="273" REF="275"/>
<L>With the sun the next morn he arose,</L>
<L>Pastora he sought in the grove,</L>
<L>He repeated the tale of his woes,</L>
<L>And mourn'd the sad fate of his love!</L>
<L>Pastora heard every complaint;</L>
<L>Again he imparted his grief,</L>
<L>He talk'd without fear or constraint,</L>
<L>And found from her converse, relief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The friendship he felt for the fair,</L>
<L>Each meeting still serv'd to improve;</L>
<L>He then blest his late cause of despair,</L>
<L>And became a true votary to Love.</L>
<L>'Twas no longer for beauty he sigh'd,</L>
<L>He no longer to merit was blind,</L>
<L>'Twas his joy, and a laudable pride,</L>
<L>That he valu'd the charms of the mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pastora with blushes confest,</L>
<L>That she felt all the force of true love;</L>
<L>But that reason her passion supprest,</L>
<L>Yet that now she must own and approve.</L>
<L>She soon gave her hand to the swain,</L>
<L>Who proclaim'd to each shepherd this truth,</L>
<L>He had met a reward for his pain,</L>
<L>More lasting than beauty and youth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="274" REF="276"/>
<L>When Spring decks with verdure the mead,</L>
<L>Love wafts milder fragrance around;</L>
<L>When Summer invites to the shade,</L>
<L>Love strews with fresh flowrets the ground.</L>
<L>In Autumn thro' corn-fields they rove,</L>
<L>And their loves as in Spring-time appear,</L>
<L>Tho' Winter disrobes the known grove,</L>
<L>Yet their love varies not with the year.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye Nymphs, to this maxim attend,</L>
<L>Tho' beauty awhile may allure,</L>
<L>Yet to fix in the lover the friend,</L>
<L>'Tis virtue alone is secure!</L>
<L>Ye Swains, who are caught by a face,</L>
