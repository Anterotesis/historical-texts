<HEAD>A NIGHT-PIECE, ON DEATH.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>The great fault of this piece, written by Dr. Parnell, is, that it is in eight syllable lines, very improper for the solemnity of the subject; otherwise, the poem is natural, and the reflections just.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<L>BY the blue taper's trembling light</L>
<L>No more I waste the wakeful night,</L>
<L>Intent with endless view to pore</L>
<L>The schoolmen and the sages o'er:</L>
<L>Their books from wisdom widely stray,</L>
<L>Or point, at best, the longest way.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="5"/>I'll seek a readier path, and go</L>
<L>Where wisdom's surely taught below.</L>
<L>How deep yon azure dies the sky!</L>
<L>Where orbs of gold unnumber'd lye,</L>
<L>While thro' their ranks, in silver pride,</L>
<L>The nether crescent seems to glide.</L>
<L>The slumb'ring breeze forgets to breathe,</L>
<L>The lake is smooth, and clear beneath,</L>
<L>Where once again the spangled show</L>
<L>Descends to meet our eyes below.</L>
<L>The grounds which on the right aspire,</L>
<L>In dimness from the view retire:</L>
<L>The left presents a place of graves,</L>
<L>Whose wall the silent water laves.</L>
<L>That steeple guides thy doubtful sight</L>
<L>Among the livid gleams of night.</L>
<L>There pass, with melancholy state,</L>
<L>By all the solemn heaps of fate,</L>
<L>And think, as, softly-sad, you tread</L>
<L>Above the venerable dead,</L>
<L>"Time was, like thee they life possest,</L>
<L>And time shall be, that thou shalt rest."</L>
<L>Those graves, with bending osier bound,</L>
<L>That, nameless, heave the crumbled ground,</L>
<L>Quick to the glancing thought disclose,</L>
<L>Where toil and poverty repose.</L>
<L>The flat smooth stones that bear a name,</L>
<L>The chissel's slender help to fame,</L>
<L>(Which ere our set of friends decay</L>
<L>Their frequent steps may wear away;)</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="6"/>A middle race of mortals own,</L>
<L>Men, half ambitious, all unknown.</L>
<L>The marble tombs that rise on high,</L>
<L>Whose dead in vaulted arches lye,</L>
<L>Whose pillars swell with sculptur'd stones,</L>
<L>Arms, angels, epitaphs, and bones,</L>
<L>These, all the poor remains of state,</L>
<L>Adorn the rich, or praise the great;</L>
<L>Who while on earth in fame they live,</L>
<L>Are senseless of the fame they give.</L>
<L>Ha! while I gaze pale Cynthia fades,</L>
<L>The bursting earth unveils the shades!</L>
<L>All slow, and wan, and wrap'd with shrouds,</L>
<L>They rise in visionary crouds,</L>
<L>And all with sober accent cry,</L>
<L>"Think, mortal, what it is to die."</L>
<L>Now, from yon black and fun'ral yew,</L>
<L>That bathes the charnel-house with dew,</L>
<L>Methinks, I hear a voice begin;</L>
<L>(Ye ravens, cease your croaking din,</L>
<L>Ye tolling clocks, no time resound</L>
<L>O'er the long lake and midnight ground)</L>
<L>It sends a peal of hollow groans,</L>
<L>Thus speaking from among the bones.</L>
<L>"When men my scythe and darts supply,</L>
<L>How great a King of Fears am I!</L>
<L>They view me like the last of things;</L>
<L>They make, and then they dread my stings.</L>
<L>Fools! if you less provok'd your fears,</L>
<L>No more my spectre-form appears.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="7"/>Death's but a path that must be trod,</L>
<L>If man wou'd ever pass to God:</L>
<L>A port of calms, a state of ease</L>
<L>From the rough rage of swelling seas.</L>
<L>Why, then, thy flowing sable stoles,</L>
<L>Deep pending cypress, mourning poles,</L>
<L>Loose scarfs to fall athwart thy weeds,</L>
<L>Long palls, drawn herses, cover'd steeds,</L>
<L>And plumes of black, that, as they tread,</L>
<L>Nod o'er the 'scutcheons of the dead?</L>
<L>Nor can the parted body know,</L>
<L>Nor wants the soul, these forms of woe:</L>
<L>As men who long in prison dwell,</L>
<L>With lamps that glimmer round the cell,</L>
<L>When-e'er their suff'ring years are run,</L>
<L>Spring forth to greet the glitt'ring sun:</L>
<L>Such joy, tho' far transcending sense,</L>
<L>Have pious souls at parting hence.</L>
<L>On earth, and in the body plac'd,</L>
<L>A few, and evil years, they waste:</L>
<L>But, when their chains are cast aside,</L>
<L>See the glad scene unfolding wide,</L>
<L>Clap the glad wing, and tow'r away,</L>
<L>And mingle with the blaze of day.</L>

<HEAD>A FAIRY TALE. BY DR. PARNELL.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>Never was the old manner of speaking more hapâˆ£pily applied, or a tale better told, than this.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<L>IN Britain's isle, and Arthur's days,</L>
<L>When midnight Fairies daunc'd the maze,</L>
<L>Liv'd Edwin of the Green;</L>
<L>Edwin, I wis, a gentle youth,</L>
<L>Endow'd with courage, sense, and truth,</L>
<L>Tho' badly shap'd he been.</L>
<L>His mountain back mote well be said,</L>
<L>To measure height against his head,</L>
<L>And lift itself above;</L>
<L>Yet, spite of all that Nature did</L>
<L>To make his uncouth form forbid,</L>
<L>This creature dar'd to love.</L>
<L>He felt the charms of Edith's eyes,</L>
<L>Nor wanted hope to gain the prize,</L>
<L>Cou'd ladies look within;</L>
<L>But one Sir Topaz dress'd with art,</L>
<L>And, if a shape cou'd win a heart,</L>
<L>He had a shape to win.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="9"/>Edwin, if right I read my song,</L>
<L>With slighted passion pac'd along</L>
<L>All in the moony light;</L>
<L>'Twas near an old inchanted court,</L>
<L>Where sportive fairies made resort,</L>
<L>To revel out the night.</L>
<L>His heart was drear, his hope was cross'd,</L>
<L>'Twas late, 'twas far, the path was lost</L>
<L>That reach'd the neighbour-town;</L>
<L>With weary steps he quits the shades,</L>
<L>Resolv'd, the darkling dome he treads,</L>
<L>And drops his limbs adown.</L>
<L>But scant he lays him on the floor,</L>
<L>When hollow winds remove the door,</L>
<L>A trembling rocks the ground:</L>
<L>And, well I ween to count aright,</L>
<L>At once an hundred tapers light</L>
<L>On all the walls around.</L>
<L>Now sounding tongues assail his ear,</L>
<L>Now sounding feet approachen near,</L>
<L>And now the sounds increase:</L>
<L>And, from the corner where he lay,</L>
<L>He sees a train profusely gay</L>
<L>Come prankling o'er the place.</L>
<L>But (trust me gentles!) never yet</L>
<L>Was dight a masquing half so neat,</L>
<L>Or half so rich, before;</L>
<L>The country lent the sweet perfumes,</L>
<L>The sea the pearl, the sky the plumes,</L>
<L>The town its silken store.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="10"/>Now, whilst he gaz'd, a gallant, drest</L>
<L>In flaunting robes above the rest</L>
<L>With awful accent cry'd,</L>
<L>What mortal, of a wretched mind,</L>
<L>Whose sighs infect the balmy wind,</L>
<L>Has here presum'd to hide?</L>
<L>At this the swain, whose vent'rous soul</L>
<L>No fears of magic art controul,</L>
<L>Advanc'd in open sight;</L>
<L>"Nor have I cause of dreed, he said,</L>
<L>Who view, by no presumption led,</L>
<L>Your revels of the night.</L>
<L>'Twas grief, for scorn of faithful love,</L>
<L>Which made my steps unweeting rove</L>
<L>Amid the nightly dew."</L>
<L>'Tis well, the gallant cries again,</L>
<L>We fairies never injure men</L>
<L>Who dare to tell us true.</L>
<L>Exalt thy love-dejected heart;</L>
<L>Be mine the task, or ere we part,</L>
<L>To make thee grief resign;</L>
<L>Now take the pleasure of thy chaunce;</L>
<L>Whilst I with Mab, my partner, daunce,</L>
<L>Be little Mable thine.</L>
<L>He spoke, and, all a sudden, there</L>
<L>Light music floats in wanton air;</L>
<L>The Monarch leads the Queen:</L>
<L>The rest their fairie partners found:</L>
<L>And Mable trimly tript the ground,</L>
<L>With Edwin of the green.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="11"/>The dauncing past, the board was laid,</L>
<L>And siker such a feast was made</L>
<L>As heart and lip desire,</L>
<L>Withouten hands the dishes fly,</L>
<L>The glasses with a wish come nigh,</L>
<L>And with a wish retire.</L>
<L>But now, to please the fairie king,</L>
<L>Full ev'ry deal they laugh and sing,</L>
<L>And antic feats devise;</L>
<L>Some wind and tumble like an ape,</L>
<L>And other-some transmute their shape</L>
<L>In Edwin's wond'ring eyes.</L>
<L>Till one, at last, that Robin hight,</L>
<L>Renown'd for pinching maids by night,</L>
<L>Has hent him up aloof;</L>
<L>And full against the beam he slung,</L>
<L>Where, by the back, the youth he hung,</L>
<L>To sprawl unneath the roof,</L>
<L>From thence, "Reverse my charm, he crys,</L>
<L>And let it fairly now suffice</L>
<L>The gambol has been shown."</L>
<L>But Oberon answers with a smile,</L>
<L>Content thee, Edwin, for a while,</L>
<L>The vantage is thine own.</L>
<L>Here ended all the phantom play;</L>
<L>They smelt the fresh approach of day,</L>
<L>And heard a cock to crow;</L>
<L>The whirling wind that bore the crowd,</L>
<L>Has clapp'd the door, and whistled loud,</L>
<L>To warn them all to go.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="12"/>Then, screaming all at once, they fly,</L>
<L>And, all at once, the tapers dye;</L>
<L>Poor Edwin falls to floor;</L>
<L>Forlorn his state, and dark the place,</L>
<L>Was never wight in such a case</L>
<L>Thro' all the land before.</L>
<L>But, soon as dan Apollo rose,</L>
<L>Full jolly creature home he goes,</L>
<L>He feels his back the less;</L>
<L>His honest tongue and steady mind</L>
<L>Had rid him of the lump behind,</L>
<L>Which made him want success.</L>
<L>With lusty livelyhed he talks,</L>
<L>He seems a dauncing as he walks;</L>
<L>His story soon took wind;</L>
<L>And beauteous Edith sees the youth</L>
<L>Endow'd with courage, sense, and truth,</L>
<L>Without a bunch behind.</L>
<L>The story told, Sir Topaz mov'd,</L>
<L>The youth of Edith erst approv'd,</L>
<L>To see the revel scene:</L>
<L>At close of eve he leaves his home,</L>
<L>And wends to find the ruin'd dome</L>
<L>All on the gloomy plain.</L>
<L>As there he bides, it so befell,</L>
<L>The wind came rustling down a dell,</L>
<L>A shaking seiz'd the wall:</L>
<L>Up sprung the tapers as before,</L>
<L>The fairies bragly foot the floor,</L>
<L>And music fills the hall.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="13"/>But, certes, sorely sunk with woe</L>
<L>Sir Topaz sees the Elphin show,</L>
<L>His spirits in him dy:</L>
<L>When Oberon crys, "A man is near;</L>
<L>A mortal passion, cleeped sear,</L>
<L>Hangs flagging in the sky."</L>
<L>With that Sir Topaz, hapless youth!</L>
<L>In accents falt'ring, ay for ruth,</L>
<L>Intreats them pity graunt,</L>
<L>For als he been a mister wight</L>
<L>Betray'd by wand'ring in the night</L>
<L>To tread the circled haunt;</L>
<L>"Ah Losell vile, at once they roar;</L>
<L>And little skill'd of fairie lore,</L>
<L>Thy cause to come we know:</L>
<L>Now has thy kestrell courage fell;</L>
<L>And fairies, since a lye you tell,</L>
<L>Are free to work thee woe."</L>
<L>Then Will, who bears the wispy fire</L>
<L>To trail the swains among the mire,</L>
<L>The captive upward flung:</L>
<L>There, like a tortoise in a shop,</L>
<L>He dangled from the chamber-top,</L>
<L>Where, whilom, Edwin hung.</L>
<L>The revel now proceeds apace,</L>
<L>Deftly they frisk it o'er the place,</L>
<L>They sit, they drink, and eat;</L>
<L>The time with frolic mirth beguile,</L>
<L>And poor Sir Topaz hangs the while,</L>
<L>Till all the rout retreat.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="14"/>By this the stars began to wink,</L>
<L>They shriek, they fly, the tapers sink,</L>
<L>And down ydrops the knight:</L>
<L>For never spell by fairie laid</L>
<L>With strong enchantment, bound a glade,</L>
<L>Beyond the length of night.</L>
<L>Chill, dark, alone, adreed, he lay,</L>
<L>Till up the welkin rose the day,</L>
<L>Then deem'd the dole was o'er:</L>
<L>But wot ye well his harder lot;</L>
<L>His seely back the bunch had got</L>
<L>Which Edwin lost afore.</L>
<L>This tale a Sybil-nurse ared;</L>
<L>She softly stroak'd my youngling head;</L>
<L>And, when the tale was done,</L>
<L>"Thus some are born, my son, she cries,</L>
<L>With base impediments, to rise,</L>
<L>And some are born with none.</L>
<L>But virtue can itself advance</L>
<L>To what the fav'rite fools of chance</L>
<L>By Fortune seem'd design'd;</L>
<L>Virtue can gain the odds of fate,</L>

<HEAD>PALEMON AND LAVINIA.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>Mr. Thomson, though, in general, a verbose and affected poet, has told this story with unusual simâˆ£plicity: it is rather given here for being much esteemed by the public, than by the editor.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<L>THE lovely young Lavinia once had friends;</L>
<L>And Fortune smil'd, deceitful, on her birth.</L>
<L>For, in her helpless years, depriv'd of all,</L>
<L>Of every stay, save Innocence and Heaven,</L>
<L>She, with her widow'd mother, feeble, old,</L>
<L>And poor, liv'd in a cottage, far retir'd</L>
<L>Among the windings of a woody vale;</L>
<L>By solitude and deep surrounding shades,</L>
<L>But more by bashful modesty, conceal'd.</L>
<L>Together thus they shunn'd the cruel scorn</L>
<L>Which virtue, sunk to poverty, would meet</L>
<L>From giddy passion and low-minded pride:</L>
<L>Almost on Nature's common bounty fed;</L>
<L>Like the gay birds that sung them to repose,</L>
<L>Content, and careless of tomorrow's fare.</L>
<L>Her form was fresher than the morning rose,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="16"/>When the dew wets its leaves: unstain'd, and pure,</L>
<L>As is the lilly, or the mountain snow.</L>
<L>The modest virtues mingled in her eyes,</L>
<L>Still on the ground dejected, darting all</L>
<L>Their humid beams into the blooming flowers:</L>
<L>Or when the mournful tale her mother told,</L>
<L>Of what her faithless fortune promis'd once,</L>
<L>Thrill'd in her thought, they, like the dewy star</L>
<L>Of evening, shone in tears. A native grace</L>
<L>Sat, fair-proportion'd, on her polish'd limbs,</L>
<L>Veil'd in a simple robe, their best attire,</L>
<L>Beyond the pomp of dress; for loveliness</L>
<L>Needs not the foreign aid of ornament,</L>
<L>But is, when unadorn'd, adorn'd the most.</L>
<L>Thoughtless of beauty, she was beauty's self,</L>
<L>Recluse amid the close-embowering woods.</L>
<L>As, in the hollow breast of Appenine,</L>
<L>Beneath the shelter of encircling hills,</L>
<L>A myrtle rises, far from human eye,</L>
<L>And breathes its balmy fragrance o'er the wild;</L>
<L>So flourish'd blooming, and unseen by all,</L>
<L>The sweet Lavinia; till, at length, compell'd</L>
<L>By strong Necessity's supreme command,</L>
<L>With smiling patience in her looks, she went</L>
<L>To glean Palemon's fields. The pride of swains</L>
<L>Palemon was, the generous, and the rich;</L>
<L>Who led the rural life in all its joy</L>
<L>And elegance, such as Arcadian song</L>
<L>Transmits from ancient uncorrupted times;</L>
<L>When tyrant custom had not shackled Man,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="17"/>But free to follow Nature was the mode.</L>
<L>He then, his fancy with autumnal scenes</L>
<L>Amusing, chanc'd beside his reaper-train</L>
<L>To walk, when poor Lavinia drew his eye;</L>
<L>Unconscious of her power, and turning quick</L>
<L>With unaffected blushes from his gaze:</L>
<L>He saw her charming, but he saw not half</L>
<L>The charms her down-cast modesty conceal'd.</L>
<L>That very moment love and chaste desire</L>
<L>Sprung in his bosom, to himself unknown;</L>
<L>For still the world prevail'd, and its dread laugh,</L>
<L>Which scarce the firm philosopher can scorn,</L>
<L>Should his heart own a gleaner in the field:</L>
<L>And thus, in secret, to his soul he sigh'd.</L>
<L>"What pity! that so delicate a form,</L>
<L>By beauty kindled, where enlivening sense</L>
<L>And more than vulgar goodness seem to dwell,</L>
<L>Should be devoted to the rude embrace</L>
<L>Of some indecent clown! She looks, methinks,</L>
<L>Of old Acasto's line; and to my mind</L>
<L>Recalls that patron of my happy life,</L>
<L>From whom my liberal fortune took its rise;</L>
<L>Now to the dust gone down; his houses, lands,</L>
<L>And once fair-spreading family, dissolv'd.</L>
<L>'Tis said, that, in some lone, obscure retreat,</L>
<L>Urg'd by remembrance sad, and decent pride,</L>
<L>Far from those scenes which knew their better days,</L>
<L>His aged widow and his daughter live,</L>
<L>Whom, yet, my fruitless search could never find.</L>
<L>Romantic wish! would this the daughter were!"</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="18"/>When, strict enquiring, from herself he found</L>
<L>She was the same, the daughter of his friend,</L>
<L>Of bountiful Acasto: who can speak</L>
<L>The mingled passions that surpris'd his heart,</L>
<L>And thro' his nerves in shiv'ring transport ran?</L>
<L>Then blaz'd his smother'd flame, avow'd, and bold;</L>
<L>And as he view'd her, ardent, o'er and o'er,</L>
<L>Love, gratitude, and pity, wept at once.</L>
<L>Confus'd, and frighten'd at his sudden tears,</L>
<L>Her rising beauties flush'd a higher bloom,</L>
<L>As thus Palemon, passionate, and just,</L>
<L>Pour'd out the pious rapture of his soul.</L>
<L>"And art thou, then, Acasto's dear remains?</L>
<L>She, whom my restless gratitude has sought</L>
<L>So long in vain? O heavens! the very same,</L>
<L>The softened image of my noble friend</L>
<L>Alive, his every look, his every feature,</L>
<L>More elegantly touch'd. Sweeter than Spring!</L>
<L>Thou sole surviving blossom from the root</L>
<L>That nourish'd up my fortune! Say, ah where,</L>
<L>In what sequester'd desart, hast thou drawn</L>
<L>The kindest aspect of delighted Heaven?</L>
<L>Into such beauty spread, and blown so fair;</L>
<L>Tho' Poverty's cold wind, and crushing rain,</L>
<L>Beat keen, and heavy, on thy tender years?</L>
<L>O let me, now, into a richer soil</L>
<L>Transplant thee safe; where vernal suns, and showers,</L>
<L>Diffuse their warmest, largest influence;</L>
<L>And of my garden be the pride, and joy!</L>
<L>Ill it befits thee, oh it ill befits</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="19"/>Acasto's daughter, his whose open stores,</L>
<L>Tho' vast, were little to his ampler heart,</L>
<L>The father of a country, thus to pick</L>
<L>The very refuse of those harvest-fields,</L>
<L>Which from his bounteous friendship I enjoy.</L>
<L>Then throw that shameful pittance from thy hand,</L>
<L>But ill apply'd to such a rugged task;</L>
<L>The fields, the master, all, my fair, are thine;</L>
<L>If to the various blessings which thy house</L>
<L>Has on me lavish'd, thou wilt add that bliss,</L>
<L>That dearest bliss, the power of blessing thee!"</L>
<L>Here ceas'd the youth: yet still his speaking eye</L>
<L>Express'd the sacred triumph of his soul,</L>
<L>With conscious virtue, gratitude, and love,</L>
<L>Above the vulgar joy divinely rais'd.</L>
<L>Nor waited he reply. Won by the charm</L>
<L>Of goodness irresistible, and all</L>
<L>In sweet disorder lost, she blush'd consent.</L>
<L>The news immediate to her mother brought,</L>
<L>While, pierc'd with anxious thought, she pin'd away</L>
<L>The lonely moments for Lavinia's fate;</L>
<L>Amaz'd, and scarce believing what she heard,</L>
<L>Joy seiz'd her wither'd veins, and one bright gleam</L>

<HEAD>THE BASTARD.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>Almost all things written from the heart, as this certainly was, have some merit. The poet here describes sorrows and misfortunes which were by no means imaginary; and, thus, there runs a truth of thinking through this poem, without which it would be of little value, as Savage is, in other respects, but an indifferent poet.</P>

<L>Born to himself, by no possession led,</L>

<HEAD>HANS CARVEL.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>This bagatelle, for which, by the bye, Mr. Prior has got his greatest reputation, was a tale told in all the old Italian collections of jests, and borâˆ£rowed from thence by Fontaine. It had been translated once or twice before into English, yet was never regarded till it fell into the hands of Mr. Prior. A strong instance how much every thing is improved in the hands of a man of genius.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<L>HANS CARVEL, impotent and old,</L>
<L>Married a lass of London mold:</L>
<L>Handsome enough; extremely gay;</L>
<L>Lov'd music, company, and play:</L>
<L>High flights she had, and wit at will;</L>
<L>And so her tongue lay seldom still:</L>
<L>For, in all visits, who but she,</L>
<L>To argue, or to repartee?</L>
<L>She made it plain, that human passion</L>
<L>Was order'd by predestination;</L>
<L>That if weak women went astray,</L>
<L>Their stars were more in fault than they:</L>
<L>Whole tragedies she had by heart:</L>
<L>Enter'd into Roxana's part:</L>
<L>To triumph in her rival's blood,</L>
<L>The action, certainly, was good.</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="59"/>How like a vine young Ammon curl'd!</L>
<L>Oh that dear conqu'ror of the world!</L>
<L>She pity'd Betterton in age,</L>
<L>That ridicul'd the godlike rage.</L>
<L>She first of all the town, was told,</L>
<L>Where newest India things were sold:</L>
<L>So, in a morning, without bodice,</L>
<L>Slipt sometimes out to Mrs. Thody's;</L>
<L>To cheapen tea, to buy a screen:</L>
<L>What else could so much virtue mean?</L>
<L>For, to prevent the least reproach,</L>
<L>Betty went with her in the coach.</L>
<L>But, when no very great affair</L>
<L>Excited her peculiar care,</L>
<L>She, without fail, was wak'd at ten;</L>
<L>Drank chocolate, then slept again:</L>
<L>At twelve she rose; with much ado</L>
<L>Her cloaths were huddled on by two:</L>
<L>Then, does my lady dine at home?</L>
<L>Yes, sure;â€”but is the Col'nel come?</L>
<L>Next, how to spend the afternoon,</L>
<L>And not come home again too soon;</L>
<L>The change, the city, or the play,</L>
<L>As each was proper for the day;</L>
<L>A turn, in summer, to Hyde Park,</L>
<L>When it grew tolerably dark.</L>
<L>Wife's pleasure causes husband's pain:</L>
<L>Strange fancies come in Hans's brain:</L>
<L>He thought of what he did not name;</L>
<L>And would reform; but durst not blame.</L>
<L><PB N="60" REF="60"/>At first, he, therefore, preach'd his wife</L>
<L>The comforts of a pious life:</L>
<L>Told her, how transient beauty was;</L>
<L>That all must die, and flesh was grass:</L>
<L>He bought her sermons, psalms, and graces;</L>
<L>And doubled down the useful places.</L>
<L>But, still, the weight of worldly care</L>
<L>Allow'd her little time for pray'r;</L>
<L>And Cleopatra was read o'er,</L>
<L>While Scot, and Wake, and twenty more,</L>
<L>That teach one to deny one's self,</L>
<L>Stood unmolested on the shelf.</L>
<L>An untouch'd bible grac'd her toilet:</L>
<L>No fear that thumb of her's should spoil it.</L>
<L>In short, the trade was still the same;</L>
<L>The dame went out; the Col'nel came.</L>
<L>What's to be done? poor Carvel cry'd;</L>
<L>Another batt'ry must be try'd:</L>
<L>What if to spells I had recourse?</L>
<L>'Tis but to hinder something worse.</L>
<L>The end must justify the means;</L>
<L>He only sins, who ill intends:</L>
<L>Since, therefore, 'tis to combat evil,</L>
<L>'Tis lawful to employ the Devil.</L>
<L>Forthwith, the Devil did appear</L>
<L>(For name him and he's always near)</L>
<L>Not in the shape in which he plies</L>
<L>At Miss's elbow when she lies;</L>
<L>Or stands before the nurs'ry doors,</L>
<L>To take the naughty boy that roars:</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="61"/>But without sawcer eye or claw,</L>
<L>Like a grave barrister at law.</L>
<L>Hans Carvel, lay aside your grief,</L>
<L>The Devil says; I bring relief.</L>
<L>Relief, says Hans: pray let me crave</L>
<L>Your name, Sir,â€”Satan.â€”Sir, your slave:</L>
<L>I did not look upon your feet:</L>
<L>You'll pardon me:â€”Ay now I see't:</L>
<L>And pray, Sir, when came you from Hell?</L>
<L>Our friends there, did you leave them well?</L>
<L>All well: but pr'ythee, honest Hans,</L>
<L>(Says Satan) leave your complaisance:</L>
<L>The truth is this: I cannot stay</L>
<L>Flaring in sun-shine all the day:</L>
<L>For, <HI>entre nous,</HI> we hellish sprites,</L>
<L>Love more the fresco of the nights;</L>
<L>And oftner our receipts convey</L>
<L>In dreams, than any other way.</L>
<L>I tell you, therefore, as a friend,</L>
<L>Ere morning dawns your fears shall end:</L>
<L>Go, then, this evening, master Carvel,</L>
<L>Lay down your fowls, and broach your barrel;</L>
<L>Let friends and wine dissolve your care,</L>
<L>Whilst I the great receipt prepare:â€”</L>
<L>To-night I'll bring it, by my faith;</L>
<L>Believe, for once, what Satan saith.</L>
<L>Away went Hans, glad not a little;</L>
<L>Obey'd the Devil to a tittle;</L>
<L>Invited friends some half a dozen,</L>
<L>The Col'nel, and my lady's cousin.</L>
<L><PB N="62" REF="62"/>The meat was serv'd; the bowls were crown'd;</L>
<L>Catches were sung; and healths went round:</L>
<L>Barbadoes waters for the close;</L>
<L>Till Hans had fairly got his dose:</L>
<L>The Col'nel toasted to the best:</L>
<L>The dame mov'd off, to be undrest:</L>
<L>The chimes went twelve: the guests withdrew;</L>
<L>But when, or how, Hans hardly knew.</L>
<L>Some modern anecdotes aver,</L>
<L>He nodded in his elbow chair;</L>
<L>From thence was carried off to bed;</L>
<L>John held his heels, and Nan his head.</L>
<L>My lady was disturb'd: new sorrow!</L>
<L>Which Hans must answer for to-morrow.</L>
<L>In bed, then, view this happy pair;</L>
<L>And think how Hymen triumph'd there.</L>
<L>Hans, fast asleep as soon as laid;</L>
<L>The duty of the night unpaid:</L>
<L>The waking dame, with thoughts opprest,</L>
<L>That made her hate both him and rest:</L>
<L>By such a husband, such a wife!</L>
<L>'Twas Achme's and Septimius' life:</L>
<L>The lady sigh'd; the lover snor'd:</L>
<L>The punctual Devil kept his word;</L>
<L>Appear'd to honest Hans again;</L>
<L>But not at all by madam seen;</L>
<L>And giving him a magic ring,</L>

<L>THE Sceptics think, 'twas long ago,</L>

<P>This poem is very fine; and, though in the same strain with the preceding, is yet superior.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<L>IN ancient times, as story tells,</L>
<L>The saints would often leave their cells,</L>
<L>And strole about, but hide their quality,</L>
<L>To try good people's hospitality.</L>
<L>It happen'd on a winter night,</L>
<L>As authors of the legend write,</L>
<L>Two brother hermits, saints by trade,</L>

<L>But not a soul would let 'em in.</L>
<L>Our wand'ring saints, in woful state,</L>
<L>Treated at this ungodly rate,</L>
<L>Having through all the village pass'd,</L>
<L>To a small cottage came at last;</L>
<L>Where dwelt a good old honest ye'man,</L>
<L>Call'd in the neighbourhood Philemon,</L>
<L>Who kindly did these saints invite</L>
<L>In his poor hut to pass the night;</L>
<L><PB N="72" REF="71"/>And then, the hospitable sire</L>
<L>Bid goody Baucis mend the fire;</L>
<L>While he from out the chimney took</L>
<L>A flitch of bacon, off the hook,</L>
<L>And, freely, from the fattest side,</L>
<L>Cut out large slices, to be fry'd;</L>
<L>Then stepp'd aside to fetch 'em drink,</L>
<L>Fill'd a large jug up to the brink,</L>
<L>And saw it fairly twice go round;</L>
<L>Yet (what is wonderful!) they found</L>
<L>'Twas still replenish'd to the top,</L>
<L>As if they had not touch'd a drop.</L>
<L>The good old couple were amaz'd,</L>
<L>And often on each other gaz'd;</L>
<L>For both were frighten'd to the heart,</L>
<L>And just began to cryâ€”what art!</L>
<L>Then softly turn'd aside, to view</L>
<L>Whether the lights were burning blue.</L>
<L>The gentle pilgrims, soon aware on't,</L>
<L>Told them their calling, and their errand;</L>
<L>Good folks, you need not be afraid;</L>
<L>We are but Saints, the hermits said;</L>
<L>No hurt shall come to you or yours;</L>

<L>Not fit to live on christian ground,</L>
<L>They and their houses shall be drown'd;</L>
<L>Whilst you shall see your cottage rise,</L>
<L>And grow a church before your eyes.</L>

<L>And there stood fasten'd to a joist;</L>
<L>But with the upside down, to show</L>
<L>Its inclination for below;</L>
<L>In vain, for a superior force,</L>
<L>Apply'd at bottom, stops its course:</L>
<L>Doom'd ever in suspence to dwell,</L>

<L>A sudden alteration feels,</L>
<L>Increas'd by new intestine wheels;</L>
<L>And, what exalts the wonder more,</L>
<L>The number made the motion slower.</L>
<L>The flyer, though't had leaden feet,</L>
<L>Turn'd round so quick, you scarce could see't;</L>
<L>But, slacken'd by some secret pow'r,</L>
<L>Now hardly moves an inch an hour.</L>

<HEAD>TO THE EARL OF WARWICK, ON THE DEATH OF MR. ADDISON.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>This elegy (by Mr. Tickell) is one of the finest in our language: there is so little new that can be said upon the death of a friend, after the comâˆ£plaints of Ovid, and the Latin Italians, in this way, that one is surprised to see so much novelty in this to strike us, and so much interest to affect.</P>

<L>While speechless o'er thy closing grave we bend,</L>
<L>Accept these tears, thou dear departed friend;</L>
<L>Oh gone for ever, take this long adieu;</L>
<L>And sleep in peace, next thy lov'd Montagu.</L>
<L>To strew fresh laurels let the task be mine,</L>

<L>There taught us how to live and (oh! too high</L>

<HEAD>COLIN AND LUCY. A BALLAD.</HEAD>

<L>She saw her husband dead.</L>
<L>Then to his Lucy's new-made grave,</L>
<L>Convey'd by trembling swains,</L>
<L>One mould with her, beneath one sod,</L>

<L>Oft, at this grave, the constant hind,</L>
<L>And plighted maid, are seen;</L>

<HEAD>ON THE DEATH OF THE LORD PROTECTOR.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>Our poetry was not quite harmonized in Waller's time; so that this, which would be now looked upon as a slovenly sort of versification, was, with respect to the times in which it was written, almost a prodigy of harmony. A modern reader will chiefly be struck with the strength of thinking, and the turn of the compliments bestowed upon the usurper. Every body has heard the answer our poet made Charles II; who asked him how his poem upon Cromwell came to be finer than his panegyric upon himself. "Your majesty," replies Waller, "knows, that poets always sucâˆ£ceed best in fiction."</P>

<L>The ocean, which so long our hopes confin'd,</L>
<L>Could give no limits to his vaster mind;</L>
<L>Our bounds' enlargement was his latest toil;</L>
<L>Nor hath he left us pris'ners to our isle:</L>
<L>Under the tropic is our language spoke:</L>

<L>"WHEN the cock crew, he wept"â€”Smote by that eye,</L>
<L>Which looks on me, on all: that Pow'r, who bids</L>
<L>This midnight centinel, with clarion shrill,</L>
<L>Emblem of that which shall awake the dead,</L>
<L>Rouse souls from slumber, into thoughts of Heaven.</L>
<L>Shall I, too, weep? Where, then, is Fortitude?</L>
<L>And, Fortitude abandon'd, where is man?</L>
<L>I know the terms on which he sees the light;</L>
<L>He that is born is listed: life is war;</L>
<L>Eternal war with Woe. Who bears it best,</L>
<L>Deserves it least.â€”On other themes I'll dwell.</L>
<L>Lorenzo! let me turn my thoughts on thee,</L>
<L>And thine, on themes may profit; profit there,</L>
<L>Where most thy need. Themes, too, the genuine growth,</L>
<L>Of dear Philander's dust. He, thus, tho' dead,</L>
<L>May still befriendâ€”What themes? Time's wond'rous Price,</L>
<L>Death, Friendship, and Philander's final scene.</L>
<L>So could I touch these themes, as might obtain</L>
<L>Thine ear, nor leave thy heart quite disengag'd,</L>
<L><PB N="112" REF="108"/>The good deed would delight me; half-impress</L>
<L>On my dark cloud an Iris; and from Grief</L>
<L>Call Gloryâ€”Dost thou mourn Philander's fate?</L>
<L>I know thou say'st it: says thy life the same?</L>
<L>He mourns the dead, who lives as they desire.</L>
<L>Where is that thrift, that avarice of Time,</L>
<L>(O glorious avarice!) thought of Death inspires,</L>
<L>As rumour'd robberies endear our gold?</L>
<L>O Time! than gold more sacred; more a load</L>
<L>Than lead, to fools; and fools reputed wise.</L>
<L>What moment granted man without account?</L>
<L>What years are squander'd, Wisdom's debt unpaid!</L>
<L>Our wealth in days all due to that discharge.</L>
<L>Haste, haste, he lies in wait; he's at the door;</L>
<L>Insidious Death! should his strong hand arrest,</L>
<L>No composition sets the pris'ner free.</L>
<L>Eternity's inexorable chain</L>
<L>Fast binds; and Vengeance claims the full arrear,</L>
<L>How, late, I shudder'd on the brink! how, late,</L>
<L>Life call'd for her last refuge in despair!</L>
<L>That Time is mine, O Mead, to thee I owe;</L>
<L>Fain would I pay thee with eternity.</L>
<L>But ill my genius answers my desire;</L>
<L>My sickly song is mortal, past thy cure.</L>
<L>Accept the willâ€”that dies not with my strain.</L>
<L>For what calls thy disease, Lorenzo? Not</L>
<L>For Esculapian, but for moral aid.</L>
<L>Thou think'st it folly to be wise too soon.</L>
<L>Youth is not rich in Time; it may be poor;</L>
<L>Part with it as with money, sparing; pay</L>
<L><PB N="113" REF="109"/>No moment, but in purchase of its worth;</L>
<L>And what its worth, ask death-beds; they can tell.</L>
<L>Part with it as with life, reluctant; big</L>
<L>With holy hope of nobler time to come;</L>
<L>Time higher-aim'd, still nearer the great mark</L>
<L>Of men and angels; virtue more divine.</L>
<L>Is this our duty, wisdom, glory, gain?</L>
<L>(These Heav'n benign in vital union binds)</L>
<L>And sport we like the natives of the bough,</L>
<L>When vernal suns inspire? Amusement reigns</L>
<L>Man's great demand: to trifle is to live:</L>
<L>And is it, then, a trifle, too, to die?</L>
<L>Thou say'st I preach, Lorenzo! 'Tis confest.</L>
<L>What if, for once, I preach thee quite awake?</L>
<L>Who wants amusement in the flame of battle?</L>
<L>Is it not treason to the soul immortal,</L>
<L>Her foes in arms, eternity the prize?</L>
<L>Will toys amuse, when med'cines cannot cure?</L>
<L>When spirits ebb, when Life's enchanting scenes</L>
<L>Their lustre lose, and lessen in our sight,</L>
<L>As lands and cities with their glitt'ring spires,</L>
<L>To the poor shatter'd bark, by sudden storm</L>
<L>Thrown off to sea, and soon to perish there;</L>
<L>Will toys amuse? No; thrones will then be toys,</L>
<L>And earth and skies seem dust upon the scale.</L>
<L>Redeem we time?â€”Its loss we dearly buy.</L>
<L>What pleads Lorenzo for his high-priz'd sports?</L>
<L>He pleads Time's num'rous blanks: he loudly pleads</L>
<L>The straw-like trifles on Life's common stream.</L>
<L>From whom those blanks and trifles, but from thee?</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="110"/>No blank, no trifle Nature made, or meant.</L>
<L>Virtue, or purpos'd virtue, still be thine;</L>
<L>This cancels thy complaint at once; this leaves</L>
<L>In act no trifle, and no blank in time.</L>
<L>This greatens, fills, immortalizes all;</L>
<L>This, the blest art of turning all to gold;</L>
<L>This, the good heart's prerogative to raise</L>
<L>A royal tribute from the poorest hours;</L>
<L>Immense revenue! ev'ry moment pays.</L>
<L>If nothing more than purpose in thy pow'r;</L>
<L>Thy purpose firm, is equal to the deed:</L>
<L>Who does the best his circumstance allows,</L>
<L>Does well, acts nobly; angels could no more.</L>
<L>Our outward act, indeed, admits restraint:</L>
<L>'Tis not in things o'er Thought to domineer;</L>
<L>Guard well thy thought; our thoughts are heard in Heaven.</L>
<L>On all important Time, thro' ev'ry age,</L>
<L>Tho' much, and warm, the wise have urg'd; the man</L>
<L>Is yet unborn, who duly weighs an hour.</L>
<L>"I've lost a day."â€”The prince who nobly cry'd,</L>
<L>Had been an emperor without his crown;</L>
<L>Of Rome? Say, rather, lord of human race:</L>
<L>He spoke, as if deputed by mankind.</L>
<L>So should all speak: so Reason speaks in all;</L>
<L>From the soft whispers of that God in man,</L>
<L>Why fly to Folly, why to phrensy fly,</L>
<L>For rescue from the blessings we possess!</L>
<L>Time, the supreme!â€”Time is Eternity;</L>
<L>Pregnant with all Eternity can give;</L>
<L><PB N="115" REF="111"/>Pregnant with all that makes archangels smile.</L>
<L>Who murders Time, he crushes in the birth</L>
<L>A pow'r ethereal, only not ador'd.</L>
<L>Ah! how unjust to Nature, and himself,</L>
<L>Is thoughtless, thankless, inconsistent man!</L>
<L>Like children babbling nonsense in their sports,</L>
<L>We censure Nature for a span too short;</L>
<L>That span too short, we tax as tedious too;</L>
<L>Torture invention, all expedients tire,</L>
<L>To lash the ling'ring moments into speed,</L>
<L>And whirl us (happy riddance!) from ourselves.</L>
<L>Art, brainless Art, our furious charioteer,</L>
<L>(For Nature's voice unstifled would recall)</L>
<L>Drives headlong tow'rds the precipice of Death;</L>
<L>Death, most our dread; Death thus more dreadful made;</L>
<L>O what a riddle of absurdity!</L>
<L>Leisure is pain; takes off our chariot-wheels;</L>
<L>How heavily we drag the load of life!</L>
<L>Blest Leisure is our curse; like that of Cain,</L>
<L>It makes us wander, wander earth around,</L>
<L>To fly that tyrant Thought. As Atlas groan'd</L>
<L>The world beneath, we groan beneath an hour.</L>
<L>We cry for mercy to the next amusement;</L>
<L>The next amusement mortgages our fields!</L>
<L>Slight inconvenience! Prisons hardly frown,</L>
<L>From hateful Time if prisons set us free.</L>
<L>Yet when Death kindly tenders us relief,</L>
<L>We call him cruel! years to moments shrink,</L>
<L>Ages to years. The telescope is turn'd.</L>
<L><PB N="116" REF="112"/>To man's false optics (from his folly false)</L>
<L>Time, in advance, behind him hides his wings,</L>
<L>And seems to creep, decrepit with his age:</L>
<L>Behold him when past by; what then is seen,</L>
<L>But his broad pinions, swifter than the winds?</L>
<L>And all mankind, in contradiction strong,</L>
<L>Rueful, aghast, cry out on his career.</L>
<L>Leave to thy foes these errors, and these ills;</L>
<L>To Nature just, their cause and cure explore.</L>
<L>Not short Heav'n's bounty; boundless our expence;</L>
<L>No niggard, Nature; men are prodigals.</L>
<L>We waste, not use our time; we breathe, not live.</L>
<L>Time wasted is existence; us'd, is life.</L>
<L>And bare existence, man, to live ordain'd,</L>
<L>Wrings, and oppresses with enormous weight.</L>
<L>And why? since Time was giv'n for use, not waste,</L>
<L>Injoin'd to fly; with tempest, tide, and stars,</L>
<L>To keep his speed, nor ever wait for man;</L>
<L>Time's use was doom'd a pleasure; waste, a pain;</L>
<L>That man might feel his error, if unseen:</L>
<L>And, feeling, fly to labour for his cure;</L>
<L>Not, blund'ring, split on idleness for ease.</L>
<L>Life's cares are comforts; such by Heav'n design'd;</L>
<L>He that has none, must make them, or be wretched.</L>
<L>Cares are employments; and, without employ,</L>
<L>The soul is on the rack; the rack of rest,</L>
<L>To souls most adverse, action all their joy.</L>
<L>Here, then, the riddle, mark'd above, unfolds;</L>
<L>Then Time turns torment, when man turns a fool.</L>
<L>We rave, we wrestle with great Nature's plan;</L>
<L><PB N="117" REF="113"/>We thwart the Deity; and 'tis decreed,</L>
<L>Who thwart his will, shall contradict their own.</L>
<L>Hence our unnatural quarrel with ourselves;</L>
<L>Our thoughts at enmity; our bosom-broil;</L>
<L>We push Time from us, and we wish him back;</L>
<L>Lavish of lustrums, and yet fond of life;</L>
<L>Life we think long, and short; Death seek, and shun;</L>
<L>Body and soul, like peevish man and wife,</L>
<L>United jar, and yet are loth part.</L>
<L>Oh the dark days of Vanity! while here,</L>
<L>How tasteless! and how terrible, when gone!</L>
<L>Gone? they ne'er go; when past, they haunt us still;</L>
<L>The spirit walks of ev'ry day deceas'd;</L>
<L>And smiles an angel, or a fury frowns.</L>
<L>Nor death, nor life delight us. If Time past,</L>
<L>And Time possest, both pain us, what can please?</L>
<L>That which the Deity to please ordain'd,</L>
<L>Time us'd. The man who consecrates his hours</L>
<L>By vigorous effort, and an honest aim,</L>
<L>At once he draws the sting of Life and Death;</L>
<L>He walks with Nature; and her paths are peace.</L>
<L>Our error's cause and cure are seen: see, next,</L>
<L>Time's nature, origin, importance, speed;</L>
<L>And thy great gain from urging his career.â€”</L>
<L>All-sensual man, because untouch'd, unseen,</L>
<L>He looks on Time as nothing. Nothing else</L>
<L>Is truly man's; 'tis Fortune'sâ€”Time's a God.</L>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON POETRY.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>This work, by the duke of Buckingham, is enâˆ£rolled among our great English productions. The precepts are sensible, the poetry not indifferent, but it has been praised more than it deserves.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<L>OF all those arts in which the wise excel,</L>
<L>Nature's chief master-piece is writing well:</L>
<L>No writing lifts exalted man so high,</L>
<L>As sacred and soul-moving poesy:</L>
<L>No kind of work requires so nice a touch;</L>
<L>And, if well finish'd, nothing shines so much.</L>
<L>But Heav'n forbid we should be so profane,</L>
<L>To grace the vulgar with that noble name.</L>
<L>'Tis not a flash of fancy, which, sometimes,</L>
<L>Dazzling our minds, sets off the slightest rhimes;</L>
<L>Bright as a blaze, but in a moment done:</L>
<L>True wit is everlasting, like the sun,</L>
<L>Which, tho' sometimes behind a cloud retir'd,</L>
<L>Breaks out again, and is by all admir'd.</L>
<L>Number and rhime, and that harmonious sound,</L>
<L>Which not the nicest ear with harshness wound,</L>

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="ã€ˆ1 page duplicateã€‰"/>
<L><PB N="164" REF="160"/>Are necessary, yet but vulgar arts;</L>
<L>And all in vain these superficial parts</L>
<L>Contribute to the structure of the whole,</L>
<L>Without a genius too; for that's the soul:</L>
<L>A spirit which inspires the work throughout,</L>
<L>As that of nature moves the world about;</L>
<L>A flame that glows amidst conceptions fit;</L>
<L>Ev'n something of divine, and more than wit;</L>
<L>Itself unseen, yet all things by it shown,</L>
<L>Describing all men, but describ'd by none.</L>
<L>Where dost thou dwell? What caverns of the brain</L>
<L>Can such a vast and mighty thing contain?</L>
<L>When I, at vacant hours, in vain thy absence mourn,</L>
<L>Oh! where dost thou retire? and why dost thou return,</L>
<L>Sometimes with pow'rful charms to hurry me away,</L>
<L>From pleasures of the night, and bus'ness of the day?</L>
<L>Ev'n now, too far transported, I am fain</L>
<L>To check thy course, and use the needful rein.</L>
<L>As all is dulness, when the fancy's bad;</L>
<L>So, without judgment, fancy is but mad:</L>
<L>And judgment has a boundless influence</L>
<L>Not only in the choice of words, or sense,</L>
<L>But on the world, on manners, and on men;</L>
<L>Fancy is but the feather of the pen;</L>
<L>Reason is that substantial, useful part,</L>
<L>Which gains the head, while t'other wins the heart.</L>
<L>Here I shall all the various sorts of verse,</L>
<L>And the whole art of poetry rehearse;</L>
<L>But who that task would after Horace do?</L>
<L>The best of masters, and examples too!</L>
<L><PB N="165" REF="161"/>Echoes at best, all we can say is vain;</L>
<L>Dull the design, and fruitless were the pain.</L>
<L>'Tis true, the ancients we may rob with ease;</L>
<L>But who with that mean shift himself can please,</L>
<L>Without an actor's pride? A player's art</L>
<L>Is above his who writes a borrow'd part.</L>
<L>Yet modern laws are made for later faults,</L>
<L>And new absurdities inspire new thoughts;</L>
<L>What need has Satire, then, to live on theft,</L>
<L>When so much fresh occasion still is left?</L>
<L>Fertile our soil, and full of rankest weeds,</L>
<L>And monsters worse than ever Nilus breeds.</L>
<L>But hold, the fools shall have no cause to fear;</L>
<L>'Tis wit and sense that is the subject here:</L>
<L>Defects of witty men deserve a cure,</L>
<L>And those who are so, will ev'n this endure.</L>
<L>First, then, of Songs, which now so much abound,</L>
<L>Without his song no fop is to be found;</L>
<L>A most offensive weapon, which he draws</L>
<L>On all he meets, against Apollo's laws.</L>
<L>Tho' nothing seems more easy, yet no part</L>
<L>Of poetry requires a nicer art;</L>
<L>For as in rows of richest pearl there lies</L>
<L>Many a blemish that escape our eyes,</L>
<L>The least of which defects is plainly shown</L>
<L>In one small ring, and brings the value down:</L>
<L>So Songs should be to just perfection brought;</L>
<L>Yet where can one be seen without a fault?</L>
<L>Exact propriety of words and thought;</L>
<L>Expression easy, and the fancy high;</L>
<L>Yet that not seem to creep, nor this to fly;</L>
<L><PB N="166" REF="162"/>No words transpos'd, but in such order all,</L>
<L>As wrought with care, yet seem by chance to fall?</L>
<L>Here, as in all things else, is most unfit,</L>
<L>Bare ribaldry, that poor pretence to wit;</L>
<L>Such nauseous songs by a late author made,</L>
<L>Call an unwilling censure on his shade.</L>
<L>Not that warm thoughts of the transporting joy</L>
<L>Can shock the chastest, or the nicest cloy;</L>
<L>But words obscene, too gross to move desire,</L>
<L>Like heaps of fuel, only choak the fire.</L>
<L>On other themes he well deserves our praise;</L>
<L>But palls that appetite he meant to raise.</L>
<L>Next, Elegy, of sweet, but solemn voice,</L>
<L>And of a subject grave, exacts the choice;</L>
<L>The praise of beauty, valour, wit contains;</L>
<L>And there too oft despairing love complains:</L>
<L>In vain, alas! for who by wit is mov'd?</L>
<L>That Phoenix-she deserves to be belov'd;</L>
<L>But noisy nonsense, and such fops as vex</L>
<L>Mankind, take most with that fantastic sex.</L>
<L>This to the praise of those who better knew;</L>
<L>The many raise the value of the few.</L>
<L>But here (as all our sex too oft have try'd)</L>
<L>Women have drawn my wand'ring thoughts aside.</L>
<L>Their greatest fault, who in this kind have writ,</L>
<L>Is not defect in words, or want of wit;</L>
<L>But should this muse harmonious numbers yield,</L>
<L>And ev'ry couplet be with fancy fill'd;</L>
<L>If yet a just coherence be not made</L>
<L>Between each thought, and the whole model laid</L>
<L><PB N="167" REF="163"/>So right, that ev'ry line may higher rise,</L>
<L>Like goodly mountains, till they reach the skies:</L>
<L>Such trifles may, perhaps, of late, have pass'd,</L>
<L>And may be lik'd awhile, but never last:</L>
<L>'Tis epigram, 'tis point, 'tis what you will,</L>
<L>But not an Elegy, nor writ with skill,</L>
<L>No Panegyric, nor a Cooper's Hill.</L>
<L>A higher flight, and of a happier force,</L>
<L>Are Odes: the Muses' most unruly horse,</L>
<L>That bounds so fierce, the rider has no rest,</L>
<L>Here foams at mouth, and moves like one possess'd.</L>
<L>The poet, here, must be, indeed, inspir'd,</L>
<L>With fury too, as well as fancy fir'd.</L>
<L>Cowley might boast to have perform'd this part,</L>
<L>Had he with nature join'd the rules of art;</L>
<L>But, sometimes, diction mean, or verse ill-wrought,</L>
<L>Deadens, or clouds, his noble frame of thought.</L>
<L>Tho' all appear in heat and fury done,</L>
<L>The language still must soft and easy run.</L>
<L>These laws may sound a little too severe;</L>
<L>But judgment yields and fancy governs here,</L>
<L>Which, tho' extravagant, this muse allows,</L>
<L>And makes the work much easier than it shows.</L>
<L>Of all the ways that wisest men could find</L>
<L>To mend the age, and mortify mankind,</L>
<L>Satire well-writ has most successful prov'd,</L>
<L>And cures, because the remedy is lov'd;</L>
<L>'Tis hard to write on such a subject more,</L>
<L>Without repeating things said oft before:</L>
<L>Some vulgar errors only we'll remove,</L>
<L>That stain a beauty which we so much love.</L>
<L><PB N="168" REF="164"/>Of chosen words some take not care enough,</L>
<L>And think they should be, as the subject, rough;</L>
<L>This poem must be more exactly made,</L>
<L>And sharpest thoughts in smoothest words convey'd.</L>
<L>Some think, if sharp enough, they cannot fail,</L>
<L>As if their only bus'ness was to rail:</L>
<L>But human frailty nicely to unfold,</L>
<L>Distinguishes a satyr from a scold.</L>
<L>Rage you must hide, and prejudice lay down;</L>
<L>A satyr's smile is sharper than his frown;</L>
<L>So, while you seem to slight some rival youth,</L>
<L>Malice itself may pass sometimes for truth.</L>
<L>The Laureat, here, may justly claim our praise,</L>
<L>Crown'd by Mack-Fleckno with immortal bays;</L>
<L>Yet once his Pegasus has borne dead weight,</L>
<L>Rid by some lumpish minister of state.</L>
<L>Here rest, my Muse, suspend thy cares awhile,</L>
<L>A more important task attends thy toil.</L>
<L>As some young eagle, that designs to fly</L>
<L>A long unwonted journey through the sky,</L>
<L>Weighs all the dang'rous enterprize before,</L>
<L>O'er what wide lands and seas she is to soar,</L>
<L>Doubts her own strength so far, and justly fears</L>
<L>That lofty road of airy travellers;</L>
<L>But yet, incited by some bold design,</L>
<L>That does her hopes beyond her fears incline,</L>
<L>Prunes ev'ry feather, views herself with care,</L>
<L>At last resolv'd, she cleaves the yielding air;</L>
<L>Away she flies, so strong, so high, so fast,</L>
<L>She lessens to us, and is lost at last:</L>
<L><PB N="169" REF="165"/>So (tho' too weak for such a weighty thing)</L>
<L>The muse inspires a sharper note to sing.</L>
<L>And why should truth offend, when only told</L>
<L>To guide the ignorant, and warn the bold?</L>
<L>On then, my Muse, advent'rously engage</L>
<L>To give instructions that concern the Stage.</L>
<L>The unities of action, time, and place,</L>
<L>Which, if observ'd, give plays so great a grace,</L>
<L>Are, tho' but little practis'd, too well known</L>
<L>To be taught here, where we pretend alone</L>
<L>From nicer faults to purge the present age,</L>
<L>Less obvious errors of the English stage.</L>
<L>First then, Soliloquies had need be few,</L>
<L>Extremely short, and spoke in passion too.</L>
<L>Our lovers talking to themselves, for want</L>
<L>Of others, make the pit their confidant;</L>
<L>Nor is the matter mended yet, if thus</L>
<L>They trust a friend, only to tell it us:</L>
<L>Th' occasion should as naturally fall,</L>
<L>As when Bellario confesses all.</L>
<L>Figures of speech, which poets think so fine,</L>
<L>(Art's needless varnish to make nature shine)</L>
<L>Are all but paint upon a beauteous face,</L>
<L>And in descriptions only claim a place:</L>
<L>But, to make rage declaim, and grief discourse,</L>
<L>From lovers in despair fine things to force,</L>
<L>Must needs succeed: for who can choose but pity</L>
<L>A dying hero, miserably witty?</L>
<L>But oh! the Dialogues, where jest and mock</L>
<L>Is held up like a rest at shittle-cock!</L>
<L><PB N="170" REF="166"/>Or else, like bells eternally they chime,</L>
<L>They sigh in Simile, and die in Rhime.</L>
<L>What things are these who would be poets thought,</L>
<L>By nature not inspir'd, nor learning taught?</L>
<L>Some wit they have, and therefore they deserve</L>
<L>A better course than this, by which they starve:</L>
<L>But to write plays! why, 'tis a bold pretence</L>
<L>To judgement, breeding, wit, and eloquence:</L>
<L>Nay more; for they must look within, to find</L>
<L>Those secret turns of nature in the mind:</L>
<L>Without this part, in vain would be the whole,</L>
<L>And but a body all, without a soul.</L>
<L>All this united, yet but makes a part</L>
<L>Of Dialogue, that great and pow'rful art,</L>
<L>Now almost lost, which the old Grecians knew,</L>
<L>From whom the Romans fainter copies drew,</L>
<L>Scarce comprehended since, but by a few.</L>
<L>Plato and Lucian are the best remains</L>
<L>Of all the wonders which this art contains;</L>
<L>Yet to ourselves we justice must allow,</L>
<L>Shakespeare and Fletcher are the wonders now:</L>
<L>Consider them, and read them o'er and o'er;</L>
<L>Go see them play'd; then read them as before;</L>
<L>For tho' in many things they grossly fail,</L>
<L>Over our passions still they so prevail,</L>
<L>That our own grief by their's is rock'd asleep;</L>

<L>Their beauties imitate, avoid their fau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="â€¢â€¢â€¢"/>â–ª</L>
<L>First, on a plot employ thy careful thoughts;</L>
<L>Turn it, with time, a thousand several ways;</L>
<L>This oft, alone, has giv'n success to plays.</L>
<L><PB N="171" REF="167"/>Reject that vulgar error (which appears</L>
<L>So fair) of making perfect characters;</L>
<L>There's no such thing in nature; and you'll draw</L>
<L>A faultless monster which the world ne'er saw.</L>
<L>Some faults must be, that his misfortunes drew,</L>
<L>But such as may deserve compassion too.</L>
<L>Besides the main design compos'd with art,</L>
<L>Each moving scene must be a plot apart;</L>
<L>Contrive each little turn, mark ev'ry place,</L>
<L>As painters first chalk out the future face:</L>
<L>Yet be not fondly your own slave for this,</L>
<L>But change hereafter what appears amiss.</L>
<L>Think not so much where shining thoughts to place,</L>
<L>As what a man would say in such a case:</L>
<L>Neither in comedy will this suffice,</L>
<L>The player too must be before your eyes;</L>
<L>And, tho' 'tis drudgery to stoop so low,</L>
<L>To him you must your secret meaning show.</L>
<L>Expose no single fop, but lay the load</L>
<L>More equally, and spread the folly broad;</L>
<L>Mere coxcombs are too obvious; oft we see</L>
<L>A fool derided by as bad as he:</L>
<L>Hawks fly at nobler game; in this low way,</L>
<L>A very owl may prove a bird of prey.</L>
<L>Small poets thus will one poor fop devour,</L>
<L>But to collect, like bees, from ev'ry flow'r,</L>
<L>Ingredients to compose that precious juice,</L>
<L>Which serves the world for pleasure and for use,</L>
<L>In spite of faction this would favour get;</L>
<L>But Falstaff stands inimitable yet.</L>
<L><PB N="172" REF="168"/>Another fault which often may befall,</L>
<L>Is, when the wit of some great poet shall</L>
<L>So overflow, that is, be none at all;</L>
<L>That ev'n his fools speak sense, as if possest,</L>
<L>And each by inspiration breaks his jest.</L>
<L>If once the justness of each part be lost,</L>
<L>Well we may laugh, but at the poet's cost,</L>
<L>That silly thing men call sheer-wit avoid,</L>
<L>With which our age so nauseously is cloy'd;</L>
<L>Humour is all; wit should be only brought</L>
<L>To turn agreeably some proper thought.</L>
<L>But since the poets we of late have known,</L>
<L>Shine in no dress so much as in their own,</L>
<L>The better by example to convince,</L>
<L>Cast but a view on this wrong side of sense.</L>
<L>First, a Soliloquy is calmly made,</L>
<L>Where ev'ry reason is exactly weigh'd;</L>
<L>Which once perform'd, most opportunely comes</L>
<L>Some hero frighted at the noise of drums;</L>
<L>For her sweet sake, whom at first sight he loves,</L>
<L>And all in metaphor his passion proves:</L>
<L>But some sad accident, tho' yet unknown,</L>
<L>Parting this pair, to leave the swain alone;</L>
<L>He strait grows jealous, tho' we know not why;</L>
<L>Then, to oblige his rival, needs will die:</L>
<L>But first he makes a speech, wherein he tells</L>
<L>The absent nymph how much his flame excels;</L>
<L>And yet bequeaths her generously now,</L>
<L>To that lov'd rival whom he does not know!</L>
<L>Who strait appears; but who can fate withstand?</L>
<L>Too late, alas! to hold his hasty hand,</L>
<L><PB N="173" REF="169"/>That just has giv'n himself the cruel stroke!</L>
<L>At which his very rival's heart is broke:</L>
<L>He, more to his new friend than mistress kind,</L>
<L>Most sadly mourns at being left behind,</L>
<L>Of such a death prefers the pleasing charms</L>
<L>To love, and living in a lady's arms.</L>
<L>What shameful and what monstrous things are these?</L>
<L>And then they rail at those they cannot please;</L>
<L>Conclude us only partial to the dead,</L>
<L>And grudge the sign of old Ben Johnson's head;</L>
<L>When the intrinsic value of the stage</L>
<L>Can scarce be judg'd but by a following age:</L>
<L>For dances, flutes, Italian songs, and rhime,</L>
<L>May keep up sinking nonsense for a time;</L>
<L>But that must fail, which now so much o'er-rules,</L>
<L>And sense no longer will submit to fools.</L>
<L>By painful steps at last we labour up</L>
<L>Parnassus' hill, on whose bright airy top,</L>
<L>The Epick poets so divinely show,</L>
<L>And with just pride behold the rest below.</L>
<L>Heroic poems have a just pretence</L>
<L>To be the utmost stretch of human sense;</L>
<L>A work of such inestimable worth,</L>
<L>There are but two the world has yet brought forth!</L>
<L>Homer and Virgil! with what sacred awe,</L>
<L>Do those mere sounds the world's attention draw!</L>
<L>Just as a changeling seems below the rest</L>
<L>Of men, or rather is a two-legg'd beast;</L>
<L>So these gigantic souls amaz'd we find</L>
<L>As much above the rest of human kind!</L>
<L><PB N="174" REF="170"/>Nature's whole strength united! endless fame,</L>
<L>And universal shouts attend their name!</L>
<L>Read Homer once, and you can read no more;</L>
<L>For all books else appear so mean, so poor,</L>
<L>Verse will seem prose; but still persist to read,</L>
<L>And Homer will be all the books you need.</L>
<L>Had Bossu never writ, the world had still,</L>
<L>Like Indians, view'd this wond'rous piece of skill;</L>
<L>As something of divine, the work admir'd;</L>
<L>Not hop'd to be instructed, but inspir'd:</L>

<L>Who thro' this labyrinth has lent the clue!</L>
<L>But what, alas! avails it poor mankind,</L>
<L>To see this promis'd land, yet stay behind?</L>
<L>The way is shewn, but who has strength to go?</L>
<L>Who can all sciences profoundly know?</L>
<L>Whose fancy flies beyond weak reason's sight,</L>
<L>And yet has judgment to direct it right?</L>
<L>Whose just discernment, Virgil-like, is such,</L>
<L>Never to say too little, or too much?</L>
<L>Let such a man begin without delay;</L>

<L>Therefore he humbly would insist,</L>
<L>The bill might be with costs dismist.</L>
<L>The cause appear'd of so much weight,</L>
<L>That Venus, from her judgment-seat,</L>
<L>Desir'd them not to talk so loud,</L>
<L>Else she must interpose a cloud:</L>
<L>For, if the heav'nly folk should know</L>
<L>These pleadings in the court below,</L>
<L>That mortals here disdain to love,</L>
<L>She ne'er could shew her face above;</L>
<L><PB N="178" REF="174"/>For Gods, their betters, are too wise</L>
<L>To value that which men despise.</L>
<L>And then, said she, my son and I</L>

<L>Or else, shut out from heav'n and earth,</L>
<L>Fly to the sea, my place of birth;</L>
<L>There live with daggled mermaids pent,</L>
<L>And keep on fish perpetual lent.</L>
<L>But, since the case appear'd so nice,</L>
<L>She thought it best to take advice.</L>
<L>The Muses, by their king's permission,</L>
<L>Though foes to love, attend the session,</L>
<L>And on the right hand took their places</L>
<L>In order; on the left, the Graces:</L>
<L>To whom she might her doubts propose</L>
<L>On all emergencies that rose.</L>
<L>The Muses oft were seen to frown;</L>
<L>The Graces, half-asham'd, look'd down;</L>
<L>And 'twas observ'd, there were but few</L>
<L>Of either sex among the crew,</L>
<L>Whom she or her assessors knew.</L>
<L>The goddess soon began to see,</L>
<L>Things were not ripe for a decree,</L>
<L>And said she must consult her books,</L>
<L>The Lovers' Fletas, Bractons, Cooks.</L>
<L>First to a dapper clerk she beckon'd</L>
<L>To turn to Ovid, book the second;</L>
<L>She then referr'd them to a place</L>
<L>In Virgil (vide Dido's case);</L>
<L>As for Tibullus's reports,</L>
<L>They never pass'd for law in courts:</L>
<L><PB N="179" REF="175"/>For Cowley's briefs, and pleas of Waller,</L>
<L>Still their authority was smaller.</L>
<L>There was on both sides much to say:</L>
<L>She'd hear the cause another day;</L>
<L>And so she did, and then a third;</L>
<L>She heard itâ€”there she kept her word:</L>
<L>But with rejoinders and replies,</L>
<L>Long bills, and answers stuff'd with lies,</L>
<L>Demur, imparlance, and essoign,</L>
<L>The parties ne'er could issue join:</L>
<L>For sixteen years the cause was spun,</L>
<L>And then stood where it first begun.</L>
<L>Now, gentle Clio, sing or say,</L>
<L>What Venus meant by this delay.</L>
<L>The goddess, much perplex'd in mind</L>
<L>To see her empire thus declin'd,</L>
<L>When first this grand debate arose,</L>
<L>Above her wisdom to compose,</L>
<L>Conceiv'd a project in her head</L>
<L>To work her ends; which, if it sped,</L>
<L>Wou'd shew the merits of the cause</L>
<L>Far better than consulting laws.</L>
<L>In a glad hour Lucina's aid</L>
<L>Produc'd on earth a wond'rous maid,</L>
<L>On whom the queen of love was bent</L>
<L>To try a new experiment.</L>
<L>She threw her law-books on the shelf,</L>
<L>And thus debated with herself:</L>
<L>"Since men alledge, they ne'er can find</L>
<L>Those beauties in a female mind,</L>
<L><PB N="180" REF="176"/>Which raise a flame, that will endure</L>
<L>For ever uncorrupt and pure;</L>
<L>If 'tis with reason they complain,</L>
<L>This instant shall restore my reign.</L>
<L>I'll search where ev'ry virtue dwells,</L>
<L>From courts inclusive down to cells;</L>
<L>What preachers talk, or sages write;</L>
<L>These I will gather and unite,</L>
<L>And represent them to mankind</L>
<L>Collected in that infant's mind."</L>
<L>This said, she plucks in heav'n's high bow'rs</L>
<L>A sprig of amaranthine flow'rs,</L>
<L>In nectar thrice infuses bays,</L>
<L>Three times refin'd in Titan's rays;</L>
<L>Then calls the Graces to her aid,</L>
<L>And sprinkles thrice the new-born maid:</L>
<L>From whence the tender skin assumes</L>
<L>A sweetness above all perfumes:</L>
<L>From whence a cleanliness remains,</L>
<L>Incapable of outward stains;</L>
<L>From whence that decency of mind,</L>
<L>So lovely in the female kind;</L>
<L>Where not one careless thought intrudes</L>
<L>Less modest than the speech of prudes;</L>
<L>Where never blush was call'd in aid,</L>
<L>That spurious virtue in a maid,</L>
<L>A virtue but at second-hand;</L>
<L>They blush, because they understand.</L>
<L>The Graces next would act their part,</L>
<L>And shew'd but little of their art;</L>
<L><PB N="181" REF="177"/>Their work was half already done,</L>
<L>The child with native beauty shone;</L>
<L>The outward form no help requir'd:</L>
<L>Each, breathing on her thrice, inspir'd</L>
<L>That gentle, soft, engaging air,</L>
<L>Which in old times adorn'd the fair:</L>
<L>And said, "Vanessa be the name,</L>
<L>By which you shall be known to fame;</L>
<L>Vanessa, by the gods enroll'd:</L>
<L>Her name on earthâ€”shall not be told."</L>
<L>But still the work was not compleat,</L>
<L>When Venus thought on a deceit:</L>
<L>Drawn by her doves, away she flies,</L>
<L>And finds out Pallas in the skies:</L>
<L>"Dear Pallas, I have been this morn</L>
<L>To see a lovely infant born;</L>
<L>A boy in yonder isle below,</L>
<L>So like my own without his bow,</L>
<L>By beauty could your heart be won,</L>
<L>You'd swear it is Apollo's son:</L>
<L>But it shall ne'er be said a child</L>

<L>I have enough besides to spare,</L>
<L>And give him wholly to your care."</L>
<L>Wisdom's above suspecting wiles:</L>
<L>The queen of learning gravely smiles,</L>
<L>Down from Olympus comes with joy,</L>
<L>Mistakes Vanessa for a boy;</L>

<L>Seeds long unknown to womankind;</L>
<L><PB N="182" REF="178"/>For manly bosoms chiefly fit;</L>
<L>The seeds of knowledge, judgment, wit:</L>
<L>Her soul was suddenly endu'd</L>
<L>With justice, truth, and fortitude;</L>
<L>With honour, which no breath can stain,</L>
<L>Which malice must attack in vain;</L>
<L>With open heart and bounteous hand;</L>
<L>But Pallas here was at a stand;</L>
<L>She knew in our degen'rate days</L>
<L>Bare virtue could not live on praise;â€”</L>
<L>That meat must be with money bought:</L>
<L>She therefore, upon second thought,</L>
<L>Infus'd, yet as it were by stealth,</L>
<L>Some small regard for state and wealth;</L>
<L>Of which, as she grew up, there stay'd</L>
<L>A tincture in the prudent maid:</L>
<L>She manag'd her estate with care,</L>
<L>Yet lik'd three footmen to her chair.</L>
<L>But, lest he should neglect her studies,</L>
<L>Like a young heir, the thrifty goddess</L>
<L>(For fear young master should be spoil'd)</L>
<L>Would use him like a younger child!</L>
<L>And, after long computing, found</L>
<L>'Twould come to just five thousand pound,</L>
<L>The queen of love was pleas'd, and proud,</L>
<L>To see Vanessa thus endow'd;</L>
<L>She doubted not but such a dame</L>
<L>Through ev'ry breast would dart a flame:</L>
<L>That ev'ry rich and lordly swain</L>
<L>With pride would drag about her chain;</L>
<L><PB N="183" REF="179"/>That scholars would desert their books</L>
<L>To study bright Vanessa's looks;</L>
<L>As she advanc'd, that womankind</L>
<L>Would by her model form their mind,</L>

<L>By her, as an unerring guide;</L>
<L>Offending daughters oft would hear</L>
<L>Vanessa's praise rung in their ear:</L>
<L>Miss Betty, when she does a fault,</L>
<L>Lets fall a knife, or spills the salt,</L>
<L>Will thus be by her mother chid,</L>
<L>"'Tis what Vanessa never did."</L>
<L>Thus by the nymphs and swains ador'd,</L>
<L>My pow'r shall be again restor'd,</L>
<L>And happy lovers bless my reignâ€”</L>
<L>So Venus hop'd, but hop'd in vain,</L>
<L>For when, in time, the martial maid</L>
<L>Found out the trick that Venus play'd,</L>
<L>She shakes her helm, she knits her brows,</L>
<L>And, fir'd with indignation, vows,</L>
<L>To-morrow, e're the setting sun,</L>
<L>She'd all undo that she had done.</L>
<L>But in the poets we may find,</L>
<L>A wholesome law time out of mind</L>
<L>Had been confirm'd by fate's decree,</L>
<L>That gods, of whatsoe'er degree,</L>
<L>Resume not what themselves have giv'n,</L>
<L>Or any brother-god in heav'n;</L>
<L>Which keeps the peace among the gods,</L>
<L>Or they must always be at odds:</L>
<L><PB N="184" REF="180"/>And Pallas, if she broke the laws,</L>
<L>Must yield her foe the stronger cause;</L>
<L>A shame to one so much ador'd</L>
<L>For wisdom, at Jove's council-board.</L>
<L>Besides, she fear'd the queen of love</L>
<L>Would meet with better friends above.</L>
<L>And though she must with grief reflect,</L>
<L>To see a mortal virgin deck'd</L>
<L>With graces hitherto unknown</L>

<L>Yet she would act as best became</L>
<L>A goddess of unspotted fame.</L>
<L>She knew, by augury divine,</L>
<L>Venus would fail in her design:</L>
<L>She study'd well the point, and found</L>
<L>Her foe's conclusions were not found,</L>
<L>From premisses erroneous brought,</L>
<L>And therefore the deduction's nought,</L>
<L>And must have contrary effects,</L>
<L>To what her treach'rous foe expects.</L>
<L>In proper season Pallas meets</L>
<L>The queen of love, whom thus she greets,</L>
<L>(For gods, we are by Homer told,</L>
<L>Can in celestial language scold)</L>
<L>"Perfidious goddess! but in vain</L>
<L>You form'd this project in your brain;</L>
<L>A project for thy talents fit,</L>

<L>The goddess thus pronounc'd her doom:</L>
<L>When, lo! Vanessa in her bloom</L>
<L>Advanc'd, like Atalanta's star,</L>
<L>But rarely seen, and seen from far;</L>
<L>In a new world with caution stept,</L>
<L>Watch'd all the company she kept,</L>
<L>Well knowing, from the books she read,</L>

<L>Would seldom at the park appear,</L>
<L>Nor saw the playhouse twice a year;</L>
<L>Yet, not incurious, was inclin'd</L>
<L>To know the converse of mankind.</L>
<L>First issu'd from perfumers shops</L>
<L>A croud of fashionable fops:</L>
<L>They ask'd her, how she lik'd the play?</L>
<L>Then told the tattle of the day;</L>
<L>A duel fought last night at two,</L>

<L><PB N="186" REF="182"/>Gave hints of who and who's together:</L>
<L>Then fell to talking of the weather:</L>

<L>With fustian from exploded plays,</L>
<L>They celebrate her beauty's praise;</L>
<L>Run o'er their cant of stupid lyes,</L>

<L>When they grew p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="â€¢"/>rt, to pull them down.</L>
<L>At last she spitefully was bent</L>
<L>To try their wisdom's full extent;</L>
<L>And said, she valu'd nothing less</L>
<L>Than titles, figure, shape, and dress;</L>
<L>That merit should be chiefly plac'd</L>
<L>In judgment, knowledge, wit, and taste;</L>
<L>And these, she offer'd to dispute,</L>

<L>That present times have no pretence</L>
<L>To virtue, in the noble sense</L>
<L>By Greeks and Romans understood</L>
<L>To perish for our country's good.</L>
<L>She nam'd the ancient heroes round,</L>
<L>Explain'd for what they were renown'd;</L>
<L>Then spoke with censure, or applause,</L>
<L>Of foreign customs, rites, and laws;</L>
<L><PB N="187" REF="183"/>Thro' nature and thro' art she rang'd,</L>

<L>A party next of glitt'ring dames,</L>

<L>Their clamour, 'lighting from their chairs,</L>
<L>Grew louder all the way up stairs;</L>
<L>At entrance loudest; where they found</L>
<L>The room with volumes litter'd round.</L>
<L>Vanessa held Montaigne, and read,</L>
<L>Whilst Mrs. Susan comb'd her head:</L>
<L>They call'd for tea and chocolate,</L>
<L>And fell into their usual chat,</L>

<L>And gravely ask'd her what she thought;</L>
<L>Whether the red or green were best,</L>

<L><PB N="188" REF="184"/>To scandal nextâ€”What aukward thing</L>

<L>I'm sorry Mopsa breaks so fast;</L>

<L>Corinna, with that youthful air,</L>

<L>Her fondness for a certain earl</L>
<L>Began, when I was but a girl.</L>

<L>They rally'd next Vanessa's dress:</L>
<L>That gown was made for old queen Bess.</L>
<L>Dear madam, let me see your head:</L>
<L>Don't you intend to put on red?</L>
<L>A petticoat without a hoop!</L>
<L>Sure, you are not asham'd to stoop;</L>

<L>Fill'd with disdain, with rage inflam'd,</L>

<L>The nymph stood silent out of spight,</L>
<L>Nor would vouchsafe to set them right.</L>
<L>Away the fair detractors went,</L>
<L>And gave by turns their censures vent.</L>
<L>She's not so handsome in my eyes:</L>
<L>For wit, I wonder where it lies.</L>
<L>She's fair and clean, and that's the most:</L>
<L>But why proclaim her for a toast?</L>

<L>In flounces hath a better fancy.</L>

<L>("To know the world!" a modern phrase</L>

<L>Thus, to the world's perpetual shame,</L>
<L>The queen of Beauty lost her aim.</L>
<L>Too late, with grief she understood,</L>
<L>Pallas had done more harm than good:</L>
<L>For great examples are but vain,</L>
<L>Where ignorance begets disdain,</L>
<L>Both sexes, arm'd with guilt and spite,</L>

<L>Men's talents to their proper use;</L>
<L>And with address each genius held</L>
<L>To that, wherein it most excell'd;</L>
<L>Thus making others wisdom known,</L>

<L>A modest youth said something new;</L>
<L>She plac'd it in the strongest view.</L>
<L>All humble worth she strove to raise;</L>
<L>Would not be prais'd, yet lov'd to praise.</L>
<L>The learned met with free approach,</L>
<L>Although they came not in a coach:</L>
<L>Some clergy too she would allow,</L>
<L>Nor quarrel'd at their aukward bow.</L>
<L>But this was for Cadenus' sake,</L>
<L>A gownman of a diff'rent make;</L>
<L>Whom Pallas, once Vanessa's tutor,</L>
<L>Had fix'd on for her coadjutor.</L>
<L>But Cupid, full of mischief, longs</L>
<L>To vindicate his mother's wrongs.</L>
<L>On Pallas all attempts are vain:</L>

<L>Vanessa, though by Pallas taught,</L>

<L>His pupil might be tir'd with lectures;</L>

<L>One of her tender sex and age;</L>
<L>That ev'ry nymph with envy own'd,</L>
<L>How she might shine in the Grande-monde,</L>
<L>And ev'ry shepherd was undone</L>
<L>To see her cloister'd like a nun.</L>
<L>This was a visionary scheme:</L>

<L>A project far above his skill;</L>
<L>For nature must be nature still.</L>
<L>If he was bolder than became</L>

<L>Had he employ'd his time so long</L>
<L>To teach her what was right and wrong,</L>
<L>Yet could such notions entertain,</L>
<L>That all his lectures were in vain?</L>
<L>She own'd the wandering of her thoughts;</L>

<L>Knows nothing which it dares not own,</L>
<L>Can make us without fear disclose</L>
<L>Our inmost secrets to our foes;</L>
<L>That common forms were not design'd</L>
<L>Directors to a noble mind.</L>
<L>Now, said the nymph, I'll let you see</L>
<L>My actions with your rules agree;</L>
<L>That I can vulgar forms despise,</L>
<L>And have no secrets to disguise.</L>
<L>I knew, by what you said and writ,</L>
<L>How dang'rous things were men of wit;</L>
<L>You cautioned me against their charms,</L>
<L>But never gave me equal arms;</L>
<L>Your lessons found the weakest part;</L>

<L><PB N="196" REF="192"/>Cadenus felt within him rise</L>
<L>Shame, disappointment, guilt, surprise.</L>
<L>He knew not how to reconcile</L>
<L>Such language with her usual stile:</L>
<L>And yet her words were so exprest,</L>
<L>He could not hope she spoke in jest.</L>
<L>His thoughts had wholly been confin'd</L>
<L>To form and cultivate her mind.</L>
<L>He hardly knew, till he was told,</L>
<L>Whether the nymph were young or old;</L>
<L>Had met her in a public place</L>
<L>Without distinguishing her face:</L>
<L>Much less could his declining age</L>

<L>And, if her youth indiff'rence met,</L>

<L>That, when Platonic flights were over,</L>

<L>Interpreting her complaisance,</L>
<L>Just as a man fans consequence.</L>
<L>She rally'd well, he always knew:</L>
<L>Her manner now was something new;</L>
<L>And what she spoke was in an air</L>
<L>As serious as a tragic player.</L>
<L>But those who aim at ridicule</L>
<L>Should fix upon some certain rule,</L>

<L>A science which he never taught,</L>

<L>But, not to dwell on things minute,</L>

<L>Brought weighty arguments to prove</L>
<L>That reason was her guide in love.</L>
<L>She thought he had himself describ'd,</L>
<L>His doctrines when she first imbib'd:</L>

<L>The genius's of ancient days!</L>
<L>(Those authors he so oft had nam'd,</L>

<L>Suppose Cadenus flourish'd then,</L>
<L>He must adore such god-like men.</L>
<L>If one short volume could comprize</L>
<L>All that was witty, learn'd, and wise,</L>

<L>If such an author were alive,</L>
<L>How all would for his friendship strive,</L>

<L>Cadenus answers ev'ry end,</L>
<L>The book, the author, and the friend:</L>
<L>The utmost her desires will reach,</L>
<L>Is but to learn what he can teach:</L>
<L>His converse is a system fit</L>
<L>Alone to fill up all her wit;</L>
<L>While ev'ry passion of her mind</L>
<L>In him is center'd and confin'd.</L>
<L>Love can with speech inspire a mute,</L>
<L>And taught Yanessa to dispute.</L>
<L><PB N="199" REF="195"/>This topic, never touch'd before,</L>

<L>Which gave a tincture o'er the mass;</L>
<L>As rivers, though they bend and twine,</L>

<L>Or, as philosophers, who find</L>
<L>Some fav'rite system to their mind,</L>

<L>Cadenus, who could ne'er suspect</L>
<L>His lessons would have such effect,</L>
<L>Or be so artfully apply'd,</L>
<L>Insensibly came on her side.</L>
<L>It was an unforeseen event;</L>
<L>Things took a turn he never meant.</L>
<L>Whoe'er excels in what we prize</L>
<L>Appears a hero in our eyes:</L>
<L>Each girl, when pleas'd with what is taught,</L>
<L>Will have the teacher in her thought.</L>
<L>The nymph in sober words intreats</L>
<L>A truce with all sublime conceits:</L>
<L>For why such raptures, flights and fancies,</L>
<L>To her who durst not read romances?</L>
<L>In lofty style to make replies,</L>
<L>Which he had taught her to despise?</L>
<L>But when her tutor will affect</L>
<L>Devotion, duty, and respect,</L>
<L><PB N="200" REF="196"/>He fairly abdicates his throne;</L>
<L>The government is now her own:</L>
<L>But, though her arguments were strong,</L>
<L>At least could hardly wish them wrong.</L>
<L>Howe'er it came, he could not tell,</L>
<L>But sure she never talk'd so well.</L>
<L>His pride began to interpose;</L>
<L>Preferr'd before a crowd of beaux!</L>
<L>So bright a nymph to come unsought!</L>
<L>Such wonder by his merit wrought!</L>
<L>'Tis merit must with her prevail:</L>
<L>He never knew her judgment fail.</L>
<L>She noted all she ever read,</L>
<L>And had a most discerning head.</L>
<L>'Tis an old maxim in the schools,</L>
<L>That vanity's the food of fools:</L>
<L>Yet now and then your men of wit</L>
<L>Will condescend to take a bit.</L>
<L>So, when Cadenus could not hide,</L>
<L>He chose to justify, his pride;</L>
<L>When miss delights in her spinnet,</L>
<L>A fiddler may a fortune get;</L>
<L>A blockhead, with melodious voice,</L>
<L>In boarding-schools can have his choice:</L>

<L>Climbs from the toe to touch the heart.</L>
<L>In learning let a nymph delight,</L>
<L>The pedant gets a mistress by't.</L>

<L>His want of passion will redeem</L>
<L>With gratitude, respect, esteem;</L>
<L>With that devotion we bestow,</L>
<L>When Goddesses appear below.</L>
<L>While thus Cadenus entertains</L>
<L>Vanessa in exalted strains,</L>
<L>Constr'ing the passion she had shown,</L>
<L>Much to her praise, more to his own.</L>
<L>Nature in him had merit plac'd,</L>
<L>In her a most judicious taste.</L>
<L>Love, hitherto a transient guest,</L>
<L>Ne'er held possession in his breast;</L>
<L>So long attending at the gate,</L>
<L>Disdain'd to enter in so late.</L>
<L>Love why do we one passion call,</L>
<L>When 'tis a compound of them all?</L>
<L>He has a forfeiture incurr'd;</L>
<L>She vows to take him at his word,</L>
<L><PB N="202" REF="198"/>And hopes he will not think it strange,</L>
<L>If both should now their stations change.</L>
<L>The nymph will have her turn to be</L>

<L>Though she already can discern,</L>

<L>Or wants capacity to reach</L>

<L>Who, though he cannot spell, is wise</L>

<L>Interpret for a kind advance.</L>
<L>But what success Vanessa met,</L>
<L>Is to the world a secret yet.</L>
<L>Whether the nymph, to please her swain,</L>
<L>Talks in a high romantic strain;</L>
<L>Or whether he at last descends</L>

<L>Must never to mankind be told,</L>
<L>Nor shall the conscious muse unfold.</L>
<L>Mean time the mournful queen of love</L>
<L>Led but a weary life above.</L>
<L>She ventures now to leave the skies,</L>
<L>Grown by Vanessa's conduct wise:</L>
<L>For, though by one perverse event</L>
<L>Pallas had cross'd her first intent,</L>
<L><PB N="203" REF="199"/>Though her design was not obtain'd,</L>
<L>Yet had she much experience gain'd,</L>

<L>She gave due notice, that both parties</L>
<L>Coram regina prox' die Martis</L>
<L>Should at their peril without fail</L>
<L>Come and appear, and save their bail.</L>
<L>All met; and, silence thrice proclaim'd,</L>
<L>One lawyer to each side was nam'd.</L>
<L>The judge discover'd in her face</L>
<L>Resentments for her late disgrace;</L>
<L>And, full of anger, shame, and grief,</L>

<L>Nor spend their time to shew their readingâ–ª</L>
<L>She'd have a summary proceeding.</L>
<L>She gather'd under ev'ry head</L>
<L>The sum of what each lawyer said,</L>
<L>Gave her own reasons last, and then</L>
<L>Decreed the cause against the men.</L>
<L>But, in a weighty case like this</L>
<L>To show she did not judge amiss,</L>
<L>Which evil tongues might else report,</L>
<L>She made a speech in open court;</L>
<L>Wherein she grievously complains,</L>
<L>"How she was cheated by the swains;"</L>
<L>On whose petition (humbly shewing</L>
<L>That women were not worth the wooing,</L>

<L>MATTHEW met Richard, when or where</L>
<L>From story is not mighty clear:</L>
<L>Of many knotty points they spoke;</L>
<L>And pro and con by turns they took.</L>
<L>Rats half the manuscript have eat:</L>
<L>Dire hunger! which we still regret:</L>
<L>O! may they ne'er again digest</L>
<L>The horrors of so sad a feast.</L>
<L>Yet less our grief, if what remains,</L>
<L>Dear Jacob, by thy care and pains</L>
<L>Shall be to future times convey'd,</L>
<L>It thus begins:</L>
<L>* * * * Here Matthew said:</L>
<L><PB N="206" REF="202"/>Alma in verse; in prose, the Mind,</L>
<L>By Aristotle's pen defin'd,</L>
<L>Throughout the body squat or tall,</L>
<L>Is, bona fide, all in all.</L>
<L>And yet, slap dash, is all again</L>
<L>In ev'ry sinew, nerve, and vein:</L>
<L>Runs here and there, like Hamlet's ghost:</L>
<L>While every where she rules the roast.</L>
<L>This system, Richard, we are told,</L>
<L>The men of Oxford firmly hold.</L>
<L>The Cambridge wits, you know, deny</L>
<L>With ipse dixit to comply.</L>
<L>They say (for in good truth they speak</L>
<L>With small respect of that old Greek)</L>
<L>That, putting all his words together,</L>
<L>'Tis three blue beans, one blue bladder.</L>
<L>Alma, they strenuously maintain,</L>
<L>Sits cock-horse on her throne the brain;</L>
<L>And from that seat of thought dispenses</L>
<L>Her sov'reign pleasure to the senses.</L>
<L>Two optic nerves, they say, she tyes,</L>
<L>Like spectacles, a-cross the eyes;</L>
<L>By which the spirits bring her word,</L>
<L>Whene'er the balls are fix'd or stirr'd;</L>
<L>How quick at park and play they strike;</L>
<L>The duke they court; the toast they like;</L>
<L>And at St. James's turn their grace</L>
<L>From former friends, now out of place.</L>
<L>Without these aids, to be more serious,</L>
<L>Her pow'r, they hold, had been precarious:</L>
<L><PB N="207" REF="203"/>The eyes might have conspir'd her ruin:</L>
<L>And she not known what they were doing.</L>
<L>Foolish it had been, and unkind,</L>
<L>That they should see, and she be blind.</L>
<L>Wise nature likewise, they suppose</L>
<L>Has drawn two conduits down our nose:</L>
<L>Could Alma else with judgment tell,</L>
<L>When cabbage stinks, or roses smell?</L>
<L>Or who would ask for her opinion</L>
<L>Between an oyster and an onion?</L>
<L>For from most bodies, Dick, you know,</L>
<L>Some little bits ask leave to flow;</L>
<L>And, as thro' these canals they roll,</L>
<L>Bring up a sample of the whole;</L>
<L>Like footmen running before coaches,</L>
<L>To tell the inn what lord approaches.</L>
<L>By nerves about our palate plac'd,</L>
<L>She likewise judges of the taste.</L>
<L>Else (dismal thought!) our warlike men</L>
<L>Might drink thick Port for fine Champagne;</L>
<L>And our ill-judging wives and daughters</L>
<L>Mistake small beer for Citron-waters.</L>
<L>Hence too, that she might better hear,</L>
<L>She sets a drum at either ear;</L>
<L>And loud or gentle, harsh or sweet,</L>
<L>Are but the alarums which they beat.</L>
<L>Last, to enjoy her sense of feeling</L>
<L>(A thing she much delights to deal in)</L>
<L>A thousand little nerves she sends</L>
<L>Quite to our toes, and fingers' ends;</L>
<L><PB N="208" REF="204"/>And these in gratitude again</L>
<L>Return their spirits to the brain;</L>
<L>In which their figure being printed</L>
<L>(As just before I think I hinted)</L>
<L>Alma inform'd can try the case,</L>
<L>As she had been upon the place.</L>
<L>Thus, while the judge gives diff'rent journeys</L>
<L>To country counsel, and attornies,</L>
<L>He on the bench in quiet sits,</L>
<L>Deciding, as they bring the writs.</L>
<L>The Pope thus prays and sleeps at Rome,</L>
<L>And very seldom stirs from home:</L>
<L>Yet sending forth his holy spies,</L>
<L>And having heard what they advise,</L>
<L>He rules the church's blest dominions,</L>
<L>And sets men's faith by his opinions.</L>
<L>The scholars of the Stagyrite,</L>
<L>Who for the old opinion fight,</L>
<L>Would make their modern friends confess,</L>
<L>The diff'rence but from more to less.</L>

<L>You grant, at least, she is extended:</L>
<L>Ergo, the whole dispute is ended.</L>
<L>For till to-morrow should you plead</L>
<L>From form and structure of the head;</L>
<L>The mind as visibly is seen</L>
<L>Extended thro' the whole Machine.</L>
<L>Why should all honour then be ta'en</L>
<L>From lower parts to load the brain:</L>
<L><PB N="209" REF="205"/>When other limbs we plainly see</L>

<L>The soldier's arm maintains the quarrel.</L>
<L>Besides, the nostrils, ears and eyes</L>
<L>Are not his parts, but his allies.</L>
<L>Ev'n what you hear the tongue proclaim,</L>

<L>What could the head perform alone,</L>

<L>Nor matters it, that you can show,</L>

<L>Those spirits started from some goal,</L>

<L>And, as their notions you confound,</L>
<L>Those you invent get farther ground.</L>
<L>The commentators on old Ariâˆ£stotle ('tis urg'd) in judgment vary:</L>
<L>They to their own conceits have brought</L>
<L>The image of his gen'ral thought;</L>

<L>Theodoret, and Origen,</L>
<L>And fifty other learned men,</L>
<L>Attest, that if their comments find</L>
<L>The traces of their master's mind;</L>
<L>Alma can ne'er decay or die:</L>
<L>This flatly t'other sect deny,</L>
<L><PB N="213" REF="209"/>Simplicius, Theophrast, Durand;</L>
<L>Great names, but hard in verse to stand.</L>
<L>They wonder men should have mistook</L>
<L>The tenets of their master's book;</L>
<L>And hold, that Alma yields her breath,</L>
<L>O'ercome by age, and seiz'd by death.</L>
<L>Now which were wise? and which were fools?</L>
<L>Poor Alma sits between two stools:</L>
<L>The more she reads, the more perplext;</L>
<L>The comment ruining the text:</L>
<L>Now fears, now hopes her doubtful fate:</L>
<L>But, Richard, let her look to thatâ€”</L>
<L>Whilst we our own affairs pursue.</L>
<L>These diff'rent systems, old or new,</L>
<L>A man with half an eye may see</L>
<L>Were only form'd to disagree.</L>
<L>Now, to bring things to fair conclusion,</L>
<L>And save much Christian ink's effusion;</L>
<L>Let me propose an healing scheme,</L>
<L>And sail along the middle stream:</L>
<L>For, Dick, if we could reconcile</L>
<L>Old Aristotle with Gassendus?</L>
<L>How many would admire our toil?</L>
<L>And yet how few would comprehend us?</L>
<L>Here, Richard, let my scheme commence:</L>
<L>Oh! may my words be lost in sense;</L>
<L>While pleas'd Thalia deigns to write</L>
<L>The slips and bounds of Alma's flight.</L>
<L>My simple system shall suppose,</L>
<L>That Alma enters at the toes;</L>
<L><PB N="214" REF="210"/>That then she mounts by just degrees</L>
<L>Up to the ancles, legs, and knees:</L>
<L>Next, as the sap of life does rise,</L>
<L>She lends her vigor to the thighs;</L>
<L>And, all these under-regions past,</L>
<L>She nestles somewhere near the waist;</L>
<L>Gives pain or pleasure, grief or laughter,</L>
<L>As we shall shew at large hereafter.</L>
<L>Mature, if not improv'd by time,</L>
<L>Up to the heart she loves to climb:</L>
<L>From thence, compell'd by craft and age,</L>
<L>She makes the head her latest stage.</L>
<L>From the feet upward to the head;</L>
<L>Pithy, and short, says Dick; proceed.</L>
<L>Dick, this is not an idle notion:</L>
<L>Observe the progress of the motion:</L>
<L>First I demonstratively prove,</L>
<L>That feet were only made to move;</L>
<L>And legs desire to come and go:</L>
<L>For they have nothing else to do.</L>
<L>Hence, long before the child can crawl,</L>
<L>He learns to kick, and wince, and sprawl:</L>
<L>To hinder which, your midwife knows</L>
<L>To bind those parts extremely close;</L>
<L>Lest Alma newly enter'd in,</L>
<L>And stunn'd at her own christ'ning's din,</L>
<L>Fearful of future grief and pain,</L>
<L>Sould silently sneak out again.</L>
<L>Full piteous seems young Alma's case:</L>
<L>As in a luckless gamester's place,</L>
<L>She would not play, yet must not passâ–ª</L>
<L><PB N="215" REF="211"/>Again, as she grows something stronger,</L>
<L>And master's feet are swath'd no longer,</L>
<L>If in the night too oft he kicks,</L>
<L>Or shows his Loco-motive tricks;</L>
<L>These first assaults fat Kate repays him,</L>
<L>When, half asleep, she overlays him.</L>
<L>Now mark, dear Richard, from the age</L>
<L>That children tread this wordly stage,</L>
<L>Broom-staff or poker they bestride,</L>
<L>And round the parlor love to ride;</L>
<L>Till thoughtful father's pious care</L>
<L>Provides his brood, next Smithfield fair,</L>
<L>With supplemental hobby-horses:</L>
<L>And happy be their infant courses!</L>
<L>Hence for some years they ne'er stand still:</L>
<L>Their legs, you see, direct their will;</L>
<L>From opening morn till setting sun,</L>
<L>Around the fields and woods they run:</L>
<L>They frisk, and dance, and leap, and play;</L>
<L>Nor heed what Friend or Snape can say.</L>
<L>To her next stage as Alma flies,</L>
<L>And likes, as I have said, the thighs.</L>
<L>With sympathetic power she warms</L>
<L>Their good allies and friends, the arms;</L>
<L>While Betty dances on the green,</L>
<L>And Susan is at school-ball seen:</L>
<L>While John for nine-pins does declare;</L>
<L>And Roger loves to pitch the bar;</L>
<L>Both legs and arms spontaneous move:</L>
<L>Which was the thing I meant to prove.</L>
<L><PB N="216" REF="212"/>Another motion now she makes:</L>
<L>O need I name the seat she takes?</L>
<L>His thought quite chang'd the stripling finds;</L>
<L>The sport and race no more he minds;</L>
<L>Neglected Tray and Pointer lie,</L>
<L>And covies unmolested fly.</L>
<L>Sudden the jocund plain he leaves;</L>
<L>And for the nymph in secret grieves.</L>
<L>In dying accents he complains</L>
<L>Of cruel fires, and raging pains.</L>
<L>The nymph too longs to be alone;</L>
<L>Leaves all the swains, and sighs for one.</L>
<L>The nymph is warm'd with young desire;</L>
<L>And feels, and dies to quench his fire.</L>
<L>They meet each evening in the grove:</L>
<L>Their parley but augments their love;</L>
<L>So to the priest their case they tell:</L>
<L>He ties the knot; and all goes well.</L>
<L>But, O my Muse, just distance keep;</L>
<L>Thou art a maid, and must not peep.</L>
<L>In nine months time the boddice loose,</L>
<L>And petticoats too short, disclose</L>
<L>That at this age the active mind</L>
<L>About the waist lies most confin'd;</L>
<L>And that young life, and quick'ning sense</L>
<L>Spring from his influence darted thence.</L>
<L>So from the middle of the world</L>
<L>The Sun's prolific rays are hurl'd:</L>
<L>'Tis from that seat he darts those beams</L>
<L>Which quicken earth with genial flames.</L>
<L><PB N="217" REF="213"/>Dick, who thus long had passive sat,</L>
<L>Here stroak'd his chin, and cock'd his hat;</L>
<L>Then slapp'd his hand upon the board,</L>
<L>And thus the youth put in his word:</L>
<L>Love's advocates, sweet fir, would find him</L>
<L>A higher place than you assign'd him.</L>
<L>Love's advocates, Dick, who are chose?â€”</L>
<L>The poets, you may well suppose.</L>
<L>I'm sorry, sir, you have discarded</L>
<L>The men, with whom till now you herded.</L>
<L>Prose-men alone for private ends,</L>
<L>I thought forsook their ancient friends.</L>
<L>"In cor stillavit," cries Lucretius;</L>
<L>If he may be allowed to teach us.</L>
<L>The self-same thing soft Ovid says,</L>
<L>(A proper judge in such a case.)</L>
<L>Horace, his phrase is, "torret jecur;"</L>
<L>And happy was that curious speaker.</L>
<L>Here Virgil too has plac'd this passion:</L>
<L>What signifies too long quotation?</L>
<L>In Ode and Epic plain the case is,</L>
<L>That love holds one of these two places.</L>
<L>Dick, without passion or reflection,</L>
<L>I'll straight demolish this objection.</L>
<L>First, poets, all the world agrees,</L>
<L>Write half to profit, half to please.</L>
<L>Matter and figure they produce;</L>
<L>For garnish this, and that for use;</L>
<L>And, in the structure of their feasts,</L>
<L>They seek to feed, and please their guests:</L>
<L><PB N="218" REF="214"/>But one may balk this good intent,</L>
<L>And take things otherwise than meant.</L>
<L>Thus, if you dine with my lord-may'r,</L>
<L>Roast-beef, and ven'son, is your fare,</L>
<L>Thence you proceed to swan and bustard,</L>
<L>And persevere in tart, and custard:</L>
<L>But Tulip-leaves, and Lemon-peel,</L>
<L>Help only to adorn the meal:</L>
<L>And painted flags, superb and neat,</L>
<L>Proclaim you welcome to the treat.</L>
<L>The man of sense his meat devours;</L>
<L>But only smells the peel and flow'rs;</L>
<L>And he must be an idle dreamer,</L>
<L>Who leaves the pie, and gnaws the streamer.</L>
<L>That Cupid goes with bow and arrows,</L>
<L>And Venus keeps her coach and sparrows,</L>
<L>Is all but emblem to acquaint one,</L>
<L>The son is sharp, the mother wanton.</L>
<L>Such images have sometimes shown</L>
<L>A mystic sense, but oftner none,</L>
<L>For who conceives, what bards devise,</L>
<L>That Heav'n is plac'd in Celia's eyes,</L>
<L>Or where's the sense, direct and moral,</L>
<L>That teeth are pearl, or lips are coral?</L>
<L>Your Horace owns, he various writ,</L>
<L>As wild or sober maggots bit;</L>
<L>And, where too much the poet ranted,</L>
<L>The sage philosopher recanted.</L>
<L>His grave Epistles may disprove</L>
<L>The wanton Odes he made to love.</L>
<L><PB N="219" REF="215"/>Lucretius keeps a mighty pother</L>
<L>With Cupid, and his fancy'd mother:</L>
<L>Calls her great queen of earth and air,</L>
<L>Declares that winds and seas obey her;</L>
<L>And, while her honour he rehearses,</L>
<L>Implores her to inspire his verses.</L>
<L>Yet, free from this poetic madness,</L>
<L>Next page he says in sober sadness,</L>
<L>That she and all her fellow-gods</L>
<L>Sit idling in their high abodes,</L>
<L>Regardless of this world below,</L>
<L>Our health or hanging, weal or woe;</L>
<L>Nor once disturb their heav'nly spirits</L>
<L>With Scapin's cheats, or Caesar's merits.</L>
<L>Nor e'er can Latin poets prove,</L>
<L>Where lies the real seat of love.</L>
<L>Jecur they burn, and Cor they pierce,</L>
<L>As either best supplies their verse;</L>
<L>And, if folks ask the reason for't,</L>
<L>Say, one was long, and t'other short.</L>
<L>Thus, I presume, the British Muse</L>
<L>May take the freedom strangers use.</L>
<L>In prose our property is greater,</L>
<L>Why should it then be less in metre?</L>
<L>If Cupid throws a single dart,</L>
<L>We make him wound the lover's heart;</L>
<L>But, if he takes his bow and quiver,</L>
<L>'Tis sure, he must transfix the Liver:</L>
<L>For rhime with reason may dispense;</L>
<L>And sound has right to govern sense.</L>
<L><PB N="220" REF="216"/>But let your friends in verse suppose,</L>

<L>Anatomists can make it clear,</L>
<L>The Liver minds his own affair;</L>
<L>Kindly supplies our public uses,</L>

<L>Still lays some useful bile aside,</L>
<L>To tinge the chyle's insipid tide:</L>
<L>Else we should want both gibe and satyr;</L>
<L>And all be burst with pure good-nature.</L>
<L>Now gall is bitter with a witness:</L>
<L>And love is all delight and sweetness.</L>
<L>My logic then has lost its aim,</L>
<L>If sweet and bitter be the same:</L>
<L>And he, methinks, is no great scholar,</L>
<L>Who can mistake desire for choler.</L>
<L>The like may of the Heart be said:</L>
<L>Courage and terror there are bred.</L>
<L>All those whose hearts are loose and low,</L>
<L>Start, if they hear but the Tattoo:</L>
<L>And mighty physical their fear is;</L>
<L>For, soon as noise of combat near is,</L>
<L>Their heart, descending to their breeches,</L>
<L>Must give their stomach cruel twitches.</L>
<L>But heroes who o'ercome or die,</L>
<L>Have their hearts hung extremely high;</L>
<L>The strings of which, in battles heat,</L>
<L>Against their very Corslets beat;</L>
<L>Keep time with their own trumpet's measure,</L>
<L>And yield 'em most excessive pleasure.</L>
<L><PB N="221" REF="217"/>Now if 'tis chiefly in the heart,</L>
<L>That courage does itself exert;</L>
<L>'Twill be prodigious hard to prove,</L>
<L>That this is eke the throne of love.</L>
<L>Would nature make one place the seat</L>
<L>Of fond desire, and fell debate?</L>
<L>Most people only take delight in</L>
<L>Those hours, when they are tir'd with fighting:</L>
<L>And has no man but who has kill'd</L>
<L>A father, right to get a child?</L>
<L>These notions then I think but idle;</L>
<L>And love shall still possess the middle.</L>
<L>This truth more plainly to discover,</L>
<L>Suppose your hero were a lover.</L>
<L>Tho' he before had gall and rage,</L>
<L>Which death, or conquest, must asswage;</L>
<L>He grows dispirited and low:</L>
<L>He hates the fight, and shuns the foe.</L>
<L>In scornful sloth Achilles slept;</L>
<L>And for his wench, like Tall-Boy, wept:</L>
<L>Nor would return to war and slaughter,</L>
<L>Till they brought back the parson's daughter.</L>
<L>Antonius fled from Actium's coast,</L>
<L>Augustus pressing, Asia lost:</L>
<L>His sails by Cupid's hand unfurl'd,</L>
<L>To keep the fair, he gave the world.</L>

<L>Disguis'd, o'er hills and vallies went,</L>
<L>To wanton with the sprightly dame;</L>

<L>Bold is the critic, who dares prove</L>
<L>These heroes were no friends to love;</L>
<L>And bolder he, who dares aver,</L>
<L>That they were enemies to war.</L>
<L>Yet, when their thought should, now or never,</L>
<L>Have rais'd their Heart, or fir'd their Liver;</L>
<L>Fond Alma to those parts was gone,</L>
<L>Which love more justly calls his own.</L>
<L>Examples I could cite you more;</L>
<L>But be contented with these sour;</L>
<L>For when one's proofs are aptly chosen,</L>
<L>Four are as valid as four dozen.</L>
<L>One came from Greece, and one from Rome;</L>
<L>The other two grew nearer home.</L>
<L>For some in ancient books delight,</L>

<L>This, Richard, is a curious case:</L>

<L>Upon two distant pots of ale,</L>
<L>Not knowing which was mild, or stale:</L>
<L>In this sad state your doubtful choice</L>

<L>By virtue of some casual weight;</L>
<L>On either side you hear 'em clatter,</L>

<L>Now, Richard, this coercive force,</L>

<L>Mark then;â€”Where fancy or desire</L>

<L>Into that limb fair Alma slides,</L>

<L>Fair Alma plays about her waist;</L>
<L>And, when the swelling hoop sustains</L>
<L>The rich brocade, fair Alma deigns</L>
<L>Into that lower sphere to enter,</L>
<L>Of the large round, herself the centre.</L>
<L>Again: that single limb or feature</L>
<L>(Such is the cogent force of nature)</L>
<L>Which most did Alma's passion move,</L>
<L>In the first object of her love,</L>
<L>For ever will be found confest,</L>
<L>And printed on the am'rous breast.</L>
<L>O Abelard, ill-fated youth,</L>
<L>Thy tale will justify this truth:</L>
<L>But well I weet, that cruel wrong</L>
<L>Adorns a nobler poet's song.</L>
<L>Dan Pope for thy misfortune griev'd;</L>
<L>With kind concern and skill has weav'd</L>
<L>A silken web; and ne'er shall fade</L>
<L>Its colours, gently as he laid</L>

<L>Next, Dick, as youth and habit sways,</L>
<L>A hundred gambols Alma plays.</L>
<L>If, whilst a boy, Jack ran from school,</L>
<L>Fond of his hunting-horn, and pole;</L>
<L>Tho' gout and age his speed detain,</L>
<L>Old John halloos his hounds again;</L>
<L>By his fire-side he starts the hare,</L>
<L>And turns her in his wicker chair:</L>
<L>His feet, however lame, you find,</L>
<L>Have got the better of his mind.</L>
<L>If, while the Mind was in her leg,</L>
<L>The dance affected nimble Peg;</L>
<L>Old Madge, bewitch'd at sixty-one,</L>

<L>In public mask, or private ball,</L>
<L>From Lincoln's-inn, to Goldsmiths-hall,</L>
<L>All Christmass long away she trudges;</L>
<L>Trips it with 'prentices, and judges:</L>
<L>In vain her children urge her stay,</L>
<L>And age or palsey bar the way.</L>
<L>But if those images prevail,</L>

<L>She cheats her son, to wed her page.</L>
<L>If Alma, whilst the man was young,</L>
<L>Slipp'd up too soon into his tongue;</L>
<L>Pleas'd with his own fantastic skill,</L>
<L>He lets that weapon ne'er lie still:</L>
<L>On any point if you dispute;</L>
<L>Depend upon it, he'll confute:</L>
<L>Change sides; and you increase your pain:</L>

<L>For one may speak with Tully's tongue;</L>

<L>Your dainty speakers have the curse,</L>

<L>As dames, who native beauty want,</L>

<L>Again: if in the female sex,</L>
<L>Alma should on this member fix;</L>
<L>(A cruel and a desp'rate case,</L>

<L>For evermore all care is vain,</L>

<L>Dear Dick, quoth Mat, let not thy force</L>
<L>Of eloquence, spoil my discourse.</L>
<L>I tell thee, this is Alma's case,</L>
<L>Still asking, what some wise-man says,</L>
<L>Who does his mind in words reveal,</L>
<L>Which all must gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="â€¢â€¢"/> tho' few can spell.</L>
<L>You tell your do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="â€¢â€¢â€¢"/>r that y' are ill;</L>
<L>And what does he, but write a bill,</L>
<L>Of which you need not read one letter?</L>
<L>The worse the scrawl, the dose the better;</L>
<L>For if you knew but what you take,</L>
<L>Tho' you recover, he must break.</L>
<L>Ideas, Forms, and Intellects,</L>
<L>Have furnish'd out three diff'rent sects.</L>
<L>Substance, or Accident, divides</L>
<L>All Europe into adverse sides.</L>
<L>Now, as engag'd in arms or laws,</L>
<L>You must have friends to back your cause:</L>
<L>In Philosophic matters so</L>
<L>Your judgment must with others' go.</L>
<L>For as in senates, so in schools,</L>
<L>Majority of voices rules.</L>
<L>Poor Alma, like a lonely deer,</L>
<L>O'er hills and dales does doubtful err:</L>
<L>With panting haste, and quick surprise,</L>
<L>From ev'ry leaf that stirs, she flies:</L>
<L><PB N="246" REF="242"/>Till mingled with the neighb'ring herd,</L>
<L>She slights what erst she singly fear'd,</L>
<L>And now, exempt from doubt and dread,</L>
<L>She dares pursue, if they dare lead:</L>
<L>As their example still prevails,</L>
<L>She tempts the stream, or leaps the pales.</L>
<L>He then, quoth Dick, who by your rule</L>
<L>Thinks for himself, becomes a fool.</L>
<L>As party-man who leaves the rest,</L>
<L>Is call'd but Whimsical at best.</L>
<L>Now, by your favour, master Mat,</L>
<L>Like Ralpho, here I smell a rat.</L>
<L>I must be listed in your sect;</L>
<L>Who, tho' they teach not, can protect.</L>
<L>Right, Richard, Mat. in triumph cry'd:</L>
<L>So put off all mistrust and pride.</L>
<L>And, while my principles I beg,</L>
<L>Pray answer only with your leg.</L>
<L>Believe what friendly I advise:</L>
<L>Be first secure; and then be wise.</L>
<L>The man within the coach that sits,</L>
<L>And to another's skill submits,</L>
<L>Is safer much (whate'er arrives)</L>
<L>And warmer too, than he that drives.</L>
<L>So, Dick Adept, tuck back thy hair,</L>
<L>And I will pour into thy ear</L>
<L>Remarks, which none did e'er disclose,</L>
<L>In smooth-pac'd verse, or hobbling prose.</L>
<L>Attend, dear Dick; but don't reply:</L>
<L>And thou may'st prove as wise as I.</L>
<L><PB N="247" REF="243"/>When Alma, now, in diff'rent ages,</L>
<L>Has finish'd her ascending stages;</L>
<L>Into the head at length she gets,</L>
<L>And there in public grandeur sits,</L>
<L>To judge of things, and censure wits.</L>
<L>Here, Richard, how could I explain,</L>
<L>The various lab'rinths of the brain?</L>
<L>Surprise my readers, whilst I tell 'em</L>
<L>Of Cerebrum and Cerebellum?</L>
<L>How could I play the commentator</L>
<L>On Dura and on Pia Mater?</L>
<L>Where hot and cold, and dry and wet,</L>
<L>Strive each the other's place to get;</L>
<L>And, with incessant toil and strife,</L>
<L>Would keep possession during life.</L>
<L>I could demonstrate every pore,</L>
<L>Where mem'ry lays up all her store;</L>
<L>And to an inch compute the station,</L>
<L>'Twixt judgment and imagination.</L>
<L>O friend! I could display much learning,</L>
<L>At least to men of small discerning.</L>
<L>The brain contains ten thousand cells:</L>
<L>In each some active fancy dwells;</L>
<L>Which always is at work, and framing</L>
<L>The several follies I was naming.</L>
<L>As in a hive's vimineous dome,</L>
<L>Ten thousand bees enjoy their home;</L>
<L>Each does her studious actions vary,</L>
<L>To go and come, to fetch and carry.</L>
<L>Each still renews her little labour,</L>
<L>Nor justles her assiduous neighbour:</L>
<L><PB N="248" REF="244"/>Eachâ€”whilst this thesis I maintain,</L>
<L>I fancy, Dick, I know thy brain.</L>
<L>O with the mighty theme affected,</L>
<L>Could I but see thy head dissected?</L>
<L>My head, quoth Dick, to serve your whim?</L>
<L>Spare that, and take some other limb.</L>
<L>Sir, in your nice affairs of system,</L>
<L>Wise men propose; but fools assist 'em.</L>
<L>Says Matthew: Richard, keep thy head,</L>
<L>And hold thy peace; and I'll proceed.</L>
<L>Proceed? quoth Dick: sir, I aver,</L>
<L>You have already gone too far.</L>
<L>When people once are in the wrong,</L>
<L>Each line they add, is much too long.</L>
<L>Who fastest walks, but walks astray,</L>
<L>Is only furthest from his way.</L>
<L>Bless your conceits! must I believe,</L>
<L>Howe'er absurd, what you conceive;</L>
<L>And, for your friendship, live and die</L>
<L>A Papist in philosophy:</L>
<L>I say, whatever you maintain,</L>
<L>Of Alma in the heart, or brain;</L>
<L>The plainest man alive may tell ye,</L>
<L>Her seat of empire is the belly:</L>
<L>From hence she sends out those supplies,</L>
<L>Which makes us, either stout or wise:</L>
<L>The strength of ev'ry other member</L>
<L>Is founded on your belly-timber:</L>
<L>The qualms or raptures of your blood</L>
<L>Rise in proportion to your food:</L>
<L><PB N="249" REF="245"/>And, if you would improve your thought,</L>
<L>You must be fed, as well as taught.</L>
<L>Your stomach makes your fabric roll;</L>
<L>Just as the bias rules the bowl.</L>
<L>That great Achilles might employ</L>
<L>The strength design'd to ruin Troy;</L>
<L>He din'd on lion's marrow, spread</L>
<L>On toasts of ammunition-bread:</L>
<L>But by his mother sent away,</L>
<L>Amongst the Thracian girls to play,</L>
<L>Effeminate he sat, and quiet:</L>
<L>Strange product of a cheese-cake diet!</L>
<L>Now give my argument fair play;</L>
<L>And take the thing the other way:</L>
<L>The youngster, who at nine and three</L>
<L>Drinks with his sisters milk and tea,</L>
<L>From breakfast reads till twelve o'clock,</L>
<L>Burnet and Heylin, Hobbes and Locke;</L>
<L>He pays due visits after noon</L>
<L>To cousin Alice, and uncle John;</L>
<L>At ten, from coffee-house or play</L>
<L>Returning, finishes the day.</L>
<L>But give him port, and potent sack;</L>
<L>From Milk-sop he starts up Mohack:</L>
<L>Holds that the happy know no hours;</L>
<L>So thro' the street at midnight scow'rs:</L>
<L>Breaks watchmen's heads and chairmen's glasses;</L>
<L>And thence proceeds to nicking sashes:</L>
<L>Till by some tougher hand o'ercome,</L>
<L>And first knock'd down, and then led home;</L>
<L><PB N="250" REF="246"/>He damns the footman, strikes the maid,</L>
<L>And decently reels up to bed.</L>
<L>Observe the various operations</L>
<L>Of food and drink in several nations.</L>
<L>Was ever Tartar fierce or cruel</L>
<L>Upon the strength of water-gruel?</L>
<L>But who shall stand his rage and force,</L>
<L>If first he rides, then eats his horse?</L>
<L>Sallads, and eggs, and lighter fare,</L>
<L>Tune the Italian spark's guitar.</L>
<L>And, if I take Dan Congreve right,</L>
<L>Pudding and beef make Britons fight.</L>
<L>Tokay and coffee cause this work</L>
<L>Between the German and the Turk:</L>
<L>And both, as they provisions want,</L>
<L>Chicane, avoid, retire, and faint.</L>
<L>Hunger and thirst, or guns and swords</L>
<L>Give the same death in diff'rent words.</L>
<L>To push this argument no further;</L>
<L>To starve a man, in law, is murder.</L>
<L>As in a Watch's fine machine,</L>
<L>Tho' many artful springs are seen;</L>
<L>The added movements which declare</L>
<L>How full the moon, how old the year,</L>
<L>Derive their secondary pow'r</L>
<L>From that which simply points the hour,</L>
<L>For, tho' those gim-cracks were away</L>
<L>(Quare would not swear; but Quare would say)</L>
<L>However more reduc'd and plain,</L>
<L>The watch would still a watch remain:</L>
<L><PB N="251" REF="247"/>But if the Horal orbite ceases,</L>
<L>The whole stands still, or breaks to pieces;</L>
<L>Is now no longer what it was;</L>
<L>And you may e'en go sell the case:</L>
<L>So if, unprejudic'd you scan</L>
<L>The goings of this clock-work, Man;</L>
<L>You find a hundred movements made</L>
<L>By fine devices in his head:</L>
<L>But 'tis the stomach's solid stroke,</L>
<L>That tells his being what's o'clock.</L>
<L>If you take off his Rhet'ric trigger,</L>
<L>He talks no more in mode and figure:</L>
<L>Or clog his Mathematic-wheel;</L>
<L>His buildings fall; his ships stand still.</L>
<L>Or lastly, break his Politic-weight;</L>
<L>His voice no longer rules the state.</L>
<L>Yet if these finer whims were gone;</L>
<L>Your clock, tho' plain, would still go on:</L>
<L>And spoil the engine of digestion,</L>
<L>And you entirely change the question.</L>
<L>Alma's affairs no pow'r can mend;</L>
<L>The jest, alas! is at an end;</L>
<L>Soon ceases all this worldly bustle;</L>
<L>And you consign the corpse to Russel.</L>
<L>Now make your Alma come or go</L>
<L>From leg to hand, from top to toe;</L>
<L>Your system, without my addition,</L>
<L>Is in a very sad condition.</L>
<L>So Harlequin extoll'd his horse,</L>
<L>Fit for the war, or road, or course;</L>
<L><PB N="252" REF="248"/>His mouth was soft; his eye was good;</L>
<L>His foot was sure as ever trod:</L>
<L>One fault he had; a fault indeed;</L>
<L>And what was that? the horse was dead.</L>
<L>Dick, from these instances and fetches,</L>
<L>Thou mak'st of horses clocks and watches,</L>
<L>Quoth Mat, to me thou seem'st to mean,</L>
<L>That Alma is a mere Machine:</L>
<L>That telling others what's o'clock,</L>
<L>She knows not what herself has struck;</L>
<L>But leaves to standers-by the trial,</L>
<L>Of what is mark'd upon her dial.</L>
<L>Here hold a blow, good friend, quoth Dick,</L>
<L>And rais'd his voice exceeding quick.</L>
<L>Fight fair, Sir: what I never meant</L>
<L>Don't you infer. In argument</L>
<L>Similies are like songs in love:</L>
<L>They much describe; they nothing prove.</L>
<L>Mat, who was here a little gravell'd,</L>
<L>Tost up his nose, and would have cavill'd:</L>
<L>But, calling Hermes to his aid,</L>
<L>Half pleas'd, half angry, thus he said:</L>
<L>Where mind ('tis for the author's fame)</L>
<L>That Matthew call'd, and Hermes came.</L>
<L>In danger heroes, and in doubt</L>
<L>Poets, find gods to help 'em out.</L>
<L>Friend Richard, I begin to see,</L>
<L>That you and I shall scarce agree.</L>
<L>Observe how oddly you behave:</L>
<L>The more I grant, the more you crave.</L>
<L><PB N="253" REF="249"/>But, comrade, as I said just now,</L>
<L>I should affirm, and you allow.</L>
<L>We system-makers can sustain</L>
<L>The thesis which you grant was plain:</L>
<L>And with remarks and comments teaze ye;</L>
<L>In case the thing before was easy.</L>
<L>But in a point obscure and dark,</L>
<L>We fight as Leibnits did with Clark;</L>
<L>And when no reason we can show,</L>
<L>Why matters this or that way go,</L>
<L>The shortest way the thing we try,</L>
<L>And what we know not, we deny:</L>
<L>True to our own o'erbearing pride,</L>
<L>And false to all the world beside.</L>
<L>That old philosopher grew cross,</L>
<L>Who could not tell what motion was:</L>
<L>Because he walk'd against his will,</L>
<L>He fac'd down men that he stood still:</L>
<L>And he who, reading on the heart,</L>
<L>(When all his Quidlibets of art</L>
<L>Could not expound its pulse and heat)</L>
<L>Swore, he had never felt it beat.</L>
<L>Chrysippus, foil'd by Epicurus,</L>
<L>Makes bold (Jove bless him!) to assure us,</L>
<L>That all things which our mind can view,</L>
<L>May be at once both false and true.</L>
<L>And Mallbranch has an odd conceit,</L>
<L>As ever enter'd Frenchman's pate:</L>
<L>Says he, so little can our mind</L>
<L>Of matter, or of spirit find,</L>
<L><PB N="254" REF="250"/>That we by guess, at least, may gather</L>
<L>Something, which may be both, or neither.</L>
<L>Faith, Dick, I must confess, 'tis true</L>
<L>(But this is only Entre Nous)</L>
<L>That many knotty points there are,</L>
<L>Which all discuss, but few can clear:</L>
<L>As Nature slily had thought fit,</L>
<L>For some by-ends, to cross-bite wit,</L>
<L>Circles to square, and cubes to double,</L>
<L>Would give a man excessive trouble;</L>
<L>The longitude uncertain roams,</L>
<L>In spite of Whiston and his bombs.</L>
<L>What system, Dick, has right averr'd</L>
<L>The cause, why woman has no beard;</L>
<L>Or why, as years our frame attack,</L>
<L>Our hair grows white, our teeth grow black?</L>
<L>In points like these, we must agree,</L>
<L>Our barbers know as much as we.</L>
<L>Yet still unable to explain,</L>
<L>We must persist the best we can:</L>
<L>With care our systems still renew,</L>
<L>And prove things likely, tho' not true.</L>
<L>I could, thou see'st, in quaint dispute,</L>
<L>By dint of Logic, strike the mute;</L>
<L>With learned skill, now push, now parry,</L>
<L>From Darii to Bocardo vary,</L>
<L>And never yield, or what is worst,</L>
<L>Never conclude the point discours'd.</L>
<L>Yet, that you hic &amp; nunc may know,</L>
<L>How much you to my candor owe;</L>
<L><PB N="255" REF="251"/>I'll from the disputant descend,</L>
<L>To show thee, I assume the friend:</L>
<L>I'll take thy notion for my ownâ€”</L>
<L>(So most philosophers have done)</L>
<L>It makes my system more complete:</L>
<L>Dick, can it have a nobler fate?</L>
<L>Take what thou wilt, said Dick, dear friend;</L>
<L>But bring thy matters to an end.</L>
<L>I find, quoth Mat, reproof is vain:</L>
<L>Who first offend, will first complain.</L>
<L>Thou wishest, I should make to shoar;</L>
<L>Yet still put'st in thy thwarting oar.</L>
<L>What I have told thee fifty times</L>
<L>In prose, receive for once in rhimes:</L>
<L>A huge fat man in country-fair,</L>
<L>Or city-church, (no matter where)</L>
<L>Labour'd and push'd amidst the croud,</L>
<L>Still bauling out extremely loud;</L>
<L>Lord save us! why do people press!</L>
<L>Another, marking his distress,</L>
<L>Friendly reply'd: Plump gentleman,</L>
<L>Get out as fast as e'er you can:</L>
<L>Or cease to push, or to exclaim:</L>
<L>You make the very croud you blame.</L>
<L>Says Dick, your moral does not need</L>
<L>The least return; so e'en proceed:</L>
<L>Your tale, howe'er apply'd, was short:</L>
<L>So far, at least, I thank you for't.</L>
<L>Mat. took his thanks, and in a tone</L>
<L>More magisterial, thus went on.</L>
<L><PB N="256" REF="252"/>Now Alma settles in the head,</L>
<L>As has before been sung, or said:</L>
<L>And here begins this farce of life,</L>
<L>Enter Revenge, Ambition, Strife:</L>
<L>Behold on both sides men advance,</L>
<L>To form in earnest Bays's dance.</L>
<L>L'Avare, not using half his store,</L>
<L>Still grumbles that he has no more;</L>
<L>Strikes not the present tun, for fear</L>
<L>The vintage should be bad next year;</L>
<L>And eats to-day with inward sorrow,</L>
<L>And dread of fancied want to-morrow.</L>
<L>Abroad if the Sur-tout you wear</L>
<L>Repels the rigour of the air;</L>
<L>Would you be warmer, if at home</L>
<L>You had the fabric, and the loom;</L>
<L>And if two boots keep out the weather,</L>
<L>What need you have two hides of leather?</L>
<L>Could Pedro, think you, make no trial</L>
<L>Of a Sonata on his viol,</L>
<L>Unless he had the total gut</L>
<L>Whence ev'ry string at first was cut?</L>
<L>When Rarus shows you his Cartone,</L>
<L>He always tells you, with a groan,</L>
<L>Where two of that same hand were torn,</L>
<L>Long before you or he were born.</L>
<L>Poor Vento's mind so much is crost,</L>
<L>For part of his Petronius lost,</L>
<L>That he can never take the pains</L>
<L>To understand what yet remains.</L>
<L><PB N="257" REF="253"/>What toil did honest Curio take;</L>
<L>What strict enquiries did he make,</L>
<L>To get one medal wanting yet,</L>
<L>And perfect all his Roman set?</L>

<L>Of these no more you hear him speak;</L>
<L>He now begins upon the Greek;</L>
<L>These rang'd and shown, shall, in their turns</L>
<L>Remain obscure as in their urns.</L>
<L>My copper-lamps, at any rate,</L>
<L>For being true antique, I bought;</L>
<L>Yet wisely melted down my plate,</L>
<L>On modern models to be wrought:</L>
<L>And trifles I alike pursue;</L>
<L>Because they're old, because they're new.</L>
<L>Dick, I have seen you with delight,</L>

<L>And simple odes too many, show ye,</L>
<L>My servile complaisance to Cloe.</L>
<L>Parents and lovers are decreed</L>
<L>By nature foolsâ€”That's brave indeed!</L>
<L>Quoth Dick: such truths are worth receiving;</L>
<L>Yet still Dick look'd as not believing.</L>
<L>Now, Alma, to divines and prose</L>
<L>I leave thy frauds, and crimes, and woes;</L>
<L>Nor think to-night of thy ill-nature,</L>
<L>But of thy follies, idle creature;</L>

<L>Happy result of human wit!</L>
<L>That Alma may herself forget.</L>
<L>Dick, thus we act; and thus we are</L>

<L>With endless pain this man pursues,</L>
<L>What, if he gain'd, he could not use:</L>

<L>That people live and die, I knew</L>
<L>An hour ago, as well as you.</L>
<L>And if fate spins us longer years,</L>
<L>Or is in haste to take the shears;</L>
<L>I know, we must both Fortunes try,</L>
<L>And bear our evils wet or dry.</L>
<L>Yet let the goddess smile, or frown;</L>
<L>Bread we shall eat, or white, or brown:</L>
<L>And in a cottage, or a court,</L>
<L>Drink fine Champagne, or muddled Port.</L>
<L>What need of books these truths to tell,</L>
<L>Which folks perceive who cannot spell?</L>
<L>And must we spectacles apply,</L>
<L>To view what hurts our naked eye?</L>
<L>Sir, if it be your wisdom's aim,</L>
<L>To make me merrier than I am;</L>
<L>I'll be all night at your devotionâ€”</L>
<L>Come on, friend; broach the pleasing notion;</L>
<L><PB N="262" REF="258"/>But if you would depress my thought,</L>
<L>Your system is not worth a groatâ€”</L>
<L>For Plato's fancies what care I?</L>
<L>I hope you would not have me die,</L>
<L>Like simple Cato, in the play,</L>
<L>For any thing that he can say?</L>
<L>E'en let him of ideas speak</L>
<L>To heathens in his native Greek.</L>
<L>If to be sad is to be wise,</L>
<L>I do most heartily despise</L>
<L>Whatever Socrates has said,</L>
<L>Or Tully writ, or Wanley read.</L>
<L>Dear Drift, to set our matters right,</L>
<L>Remove these papers from my sight:</L>
<L>Burn Mat's Des-cart, and Aristottle:</L>
<L>Here, Jonathan, your master's bottle.</L>
