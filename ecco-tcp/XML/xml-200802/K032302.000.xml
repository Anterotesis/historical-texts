<P>MAR-PLOT; Or The Second Part of <HI>The BUSIE-BODY.</HI> A COMEDY. As it is Acted at the THEATRE-ROYAL in <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> BY Her MAJESTY's Servants.</P>
<P>Written by Mrs. <HI>SUSANNA CENTLIVRE.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE <HI>HENRY BENTINCK,</HI> EARL of <HI>Portland, Viscount</HI> Woodstock, <HI>Baron of</HI> Cirencester, <HI>Captain of Her Majesty's First Troop of Guards,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WOmen, and Men like Women, natu∣rally fly to the Brave for Protection. This Pretence <HI>Mar-plot</HI> and I have for Ad∣dressing to your LORDSHIP. We know it is the peculiar Distinction of Noble Minds, that they are ready to receive under their
<PB REF="3"/>
Care the Distress'd, though they have no other Merit, than that they beseech their Patronage.</P>
<P>When I say this, my LORD, I wou'd not be understood to conceal, that my <HI>Play</HI> has been very kindly receiv'd; but we Wo∣men overlook all Praise, but from those Persons whose Approbation we most esteem. We are apt to be carry'd away from Admi∣rers to those we Admire: And this <HI>Come∣dy</HI> prefers the Honour of being thrown at Your Feet, to the Applause of an Audience. It is the Misfortune of our Sex, that we are deterr'd from the Advantages of a Learn∣ed Education: But as our Expressions are Artless, our Sentiments are less Disguis'd. Had I, my LORD, the Skill of a Writer, I shou'd here record your Noble Father's Zeal for his Royal Master, and celebrate that Care and Fidelity which preserv'd the Life of Our Deliverer: But, instead of men∣tioning this Obligation, which my late Lord <HI>Portland</HI> laid on every Man in <HI>England,</HI> I confine my self to what we owe Him for being your Father.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>That Your LORDSHIP may long bless the World with the same Virtues which You have shown in the Entrance You have made on the busie Stage of it, and long en∣joy the Advantages of an Affluent Fortune, Graceful Person, and Generous Mind, is the ardent Prayer of,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>THE Men of Wit do now their Brains fatigue</L>
<L>So much with Politicks and State-Intrigue!</L>
<L>That there's not one Male-Poet of the Age</L>
<L>Will condescend to labour for the Stage.</L>
<L>Therefore our Author, tho' no <HI>Rules</HI> she knows,</L>
<L>What Nature prompts, with Artless Hand bestows:</L>
<L>You'll see the <HI>Subject</HI> for the <HI>Genius</HI> fit,</L>
<L>A <HI>Busie-Body,</HI> drawn by Female Wit,</L>
<L>Still on the Hunt to know of others Wooing,</L>
<L>Eternally employ'd, and nothing doing!</L>
<L>Into dear Secrets anxiously they press,</L>
<L>Destroying, even where they wish Success!</L>
<L>The scanty Age all better Fare denies,</L>
<L>And no new Characters the Town supplies.</L>
<L>Some Years ago Wit had a larger Field,</L>
<L>And every Room cou'd fresh Stage-Coxcombs yield;</L>
<L>But long has been all Humorous Folly crost,</L>
<L>All Fool in empty Politician's lost.</L>
<L>Scowrers, and Rakes, and Debauchees are o'er,</L>
<L>Beaux are extinct, and Bullies are no more.</L>
<L>Therefore in Scarcity of home-bred Tools,</L>
<L>Your Treat to Night's compos'd of Foreign Fools;</L>
<L>And tho' our <HI>Mar-plot</HI> has been shown before,</L>
<L>The Fool may differ, on a different Shore—</L>
<L>For once, then, break old Custom; be not o'er-nice,</L>
<L>But let the <HI>self-same</HI> Woman please you <HI>Twice.</HI></L>

<SPEAKER>Don Per.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY Brother, you are distracted; how often have you fill'd my Brain with these Chyme∣ra's? Why should I murder my Wife with∣out a Cause?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Cause! Do's a Cuckold want a Cause?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Per.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye, Senior, keep that Word Cuckold between your Teeth, till you can prove me such, or by St. <HI>Anthony</HI> you shall feel what Mettle my Spado is made of. <STAGE>[Laying his Hand to his Sword.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Name your Spado again, and I'll shake thee into Dust, thou feeble Dotard. Your Spado! employ it against the Man that robs you of your Honour, and not against him that would preserve it. I say, My Sister, your Wife, is a Strumpet, the Strumpet of a damn'd Heretick: I saw the Looks, nay the Signs, she gave some of the <HI>English</HI> Officers, as she came from Church this Morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Per.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>English</HI> Officers!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>English</HI> I'm sure they were, I can't swear they were all Officers, nor cou'd I perceive which she sign'd to, or he shou'd not live to meet her Wishes—Now if you don't like the Name of Cuckold, find another for the Husband of a Whore, if you can—For my part I know of none; but this I know, if you won't punish her as a Wife, I will as a Sister; she shall not stain
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
the Honour of my House this way; she injur'd it too much in marrying you. I shall pursue my own Method, and so Fare∣well. <STAGE>[Going.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Per.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, there's the Blessing of matching into an ho∣nourable Family: Now must I bear all Affronts patiently, be∣cause I'm but a Merchant, forsooth—Oh, give me any Curse but this—Pray, Senior, give me leave to speak one Word with you: I am convinc'd of my too much Indulgence for this very Cockatrice, and there remains nothing to quicken my Re∣venge, but certain Demonstration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certain Demonstration! Must you have Ocular Proof? Must your Coward Heart be animated with the Sight? A Curse of your Equivocations—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Per.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, any other Sense will serve; let me hear 'em, feel 'em, nay, smell 'em; and sure Cuckoldom is so rank a Scent, that, tho' I liv'd in <HI>England,</HI> where they scarce breathe any other Air, I cou'd distinguish it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you talk like a <HI>Portuguese</HI>; keep up this Pas∣sion, and secure the Honour of your House and mine, and deserve the Alliance of my Blood, it shall be my Care to fix them.</P>

<P>Colonel <HI>Ravelin!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Charles Gripe!</HI> honest <HI>Charles,</HI> how dost thou do, Boy? Why, what brought thee to <HI>Lisbon?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Part of the Cause that brought you, Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>What? art thou in the Army?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Colonel, I leave Honour to you, Interest brought me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are Twin-Brothers, <HI>Charles</HI>; if Interest did not drive, Honour wou'd come slowly on: Art thou turn'd Mer∣chant then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, faith, not I; but it pleas'd Heav'n to take my Wife's Father out of the way, who left me Executor, and his Concerns here oblig'd me to take this Voyage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then, old Sir, jealous Traffick is dead at last. How long do you intend to stay?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Longer than I expected when I embark'd: I came away in such a Hurry, the Ship sailing sooner than I thought she
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
wou'd, I forgot to put up some Papers, without which I can't adjust my Accounts with some Merchants here; I have writ to my Wife to send them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was very unlucky; prithee, how dost thou spend thy Time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why very insipidly: How do you pass yours? What Company have you here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>All sorts; the Women, I'll say that for 'em, are kind enough, and won't put you to the Expence of Swearing and Lying to gain them; but a Man is as safe in an Engagement, as in their Arms; Fortune is the kind Friend in both the On∣sets: But I have got acquainted in a <HI>French</HI> Family, which are not altogether so dangerous one way, but much more so ano∣ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! how's that, Colonel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I'm fearful of dwindling into an honourable A∣mour there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Exert your Gallantry, gain your Point once, and those Fears will vanish. The <HI>French</HI> Ladies are easie of Access.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, the <HI>French</HI> Gayety resembles the <HI>English</HI> Com∣plaisance, yet they have always a Reserve to dash your Ex∣pectations, and when you think your self in a manner Master of their Cover'd-way, they spring a Mine of Coquetry, and blow you up at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say you so, Colonel? Why then give me the <HI>Lisbon</HI> Dames, that surrender to the Bold and Brave: He deserves not a Woman, that would not run some Hazard, provided she be kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some are of Opinion, that the jilting Fair gives the surest Blow, and <HI>Sucklin</HI> says, <HI>'Tis Expectation makes the Blessing dear.</HI> This <HI>French</HI> Woman has found the way to unite my jarring Inclinations, and tune 'em to the pitch of Constancy, and I am very apprehensive of becoming that tame Monster, call'd a Husband. Ah! I find I am caught, for I can name that terrible Word without starting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! I shall have you in my Class: Sure the La∣dy that can make such an entire Conquest over your Heart must be a Person of extraordinary Parts, Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, faith, her Ladyship has very extraordinary Parts; she's airy to Affectation, and changeable as the Wind: She has
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
Tongue enough for a Lawyer, but as hard to be understood as an Apothecary: She begins as many Stories as a Romance, and ends them as intricately, or, to speak more properly, seldom ends them at all: She's as whimsical as a Projector, as obstinate as a Physician, and as faithful as the Monarch of her Country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Admirable Qualities for a Wife; and can you forsake the whole Sex for this Woman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humph! that I won't swear; but I find I can't forsake her for the whole Sex: To be plain with you, I have try'd the Strength of Variety, and at this time am in prospect of the Fa∣vour from as fine a Woman as any in <HI>Lisbon</HI>; yet this Medly of Womankind triumphs over all, and in the midst of my Rap∣tures I murmur <HI>Joneton.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>But may I not see this wondrous Engineer, who can countermine her whole Sex, and blow up the Magazine of your Affections, Colonel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall, but you must give me your Honour not to rival me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Description you have given, Colonel, secures you from that Fear; besides, you know I am marry'd, neither am I destitute of a Mistress, tho' in a strange Place. I this Morning was a assur'd, by a Sign from a Lady's Hankerchief, that my Wants shou'd be supply'd upon Occasion. I did not rightly understand her, till the good old <HI>Duena</HI> explain'd her Mean∣ing; and this Night I shall be happy in her Arms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a Stranger to these Affairs <HI>Charles,</HI> take heed, proceed with caution, for the Women here are as warm in their Revenge as in their Inclinations, bare Suspicion justifies Murder; if you manage your Intreague so closely to escape the Husband and Relations, 'tis odds but your Mistress finds some pretence to employ her Bravoes, Fellows that will dispatch a dozen Men for a <HI>Moydre.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I go well arm'd, understand the Language, and will not easily fall a Victime, but resolve to see the event of this In∣treague; the old Matron told me that the Lady was young and beautiful, her Husband a Merchant, rich, covetous, old, and ugly; that she hated him worse than Penance, and lov'd me bet∣ter than her Prayers; shall I be such a Poultroon to decline a Lady's Summons? No, for the honour of <HI>Britain,</HI> it shall never be said an <HI>Englishman</HI> fled either from the Wars of <HI>Mars,</HI> or
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
<HI>Venus</HI>; let her bring me on, if I discharge not my self with Honour, and make my Retreat secure, may I forfeit the Embraces of the Sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said <HI>Charles,</HI> in my Conscience you married Men encroach too much upon our Prerogative methinks; you who purchase pleasure by way of Annuity, should leave us Batchel∣lours the liberty of the Freehold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Ground we course in, is never the worse for your Use.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, 'tis sometimes the better; there's many a Wife lies Fallow, and many a good Estate wou'd want an Heir, if it were not for us young Fellows, especially Soldiers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you ought to make Provision for the Recruits you raise, as much as for your Widows, they are far more Nu∣merous.</P>
<STAGE>[A noise of clashing of Swords, and Murder cry'd within.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! What noise is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis <HI>Mar-plot</HI>'s Voice, his damn'd Curiosity has brought him into some Mischief, I'll lay my Life on't.</P>
<STAGE>[Draws.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Devil's in that Fellow; what made you bring him with you?</P>
<STAGE>[Murder cry'd again within.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Murder, murder, <STAGE>[Mar. <HI>running pursued by two Bravoes.</HI></STAGE> Ah <HI>Charles,</HI> help me dear <HI>Charles,</HI> for Heav'ns sake.</P>
<STAGE>[They beat off the Bravoes.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Curse on your Paper Skull, what have you been doing now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing at all, as I hope to be saved; only I had a mind to see where that Lady liv'd that shook her Handkerchief at you, and out of no other design than to inform you, I protest, <HI>Charles,</HI> when immediately these two Scoundrels came slap upon me, I know no more for what than the Child that's unborn; but I'm sure I shall feel their blows this Month, pox take 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>For what? Why you took the only method in the World to have your Guts let out: Ha, ha! watch a Woman in <HI>Lisbon</HI>! Hark you young Gentleman, suppress that natural Curiosity of diving into other Peoples Affairs, or never hope to see old <HI>Eng∣land</HI> again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I were safe in it, Colonel <HI>Ravelin</HI>! The duce take me if I saw you before, my Senses was all in such a hurry, with these unconscionable Villains, that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you over-look'd your Friends, I warrant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have said it <HI>Charles,</HI> but I hope the Colonel will forgive me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be plain with you, Mr. <HI>Mar-plot,</HI> I shall take these kind of Over-sights for particular Favours, if you don't shake off that Temper of yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pish, prethee Colonel don't put on those grave Airs, why what harm is there in't?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's ill Manners in't, I'm sure, and have a care you han't your Bones broke for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye <HI>Mar-plot,</HI> you must either resolve to quit this inquisitive Humour, or forfeit my Acquaintance,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Man may be ruin'd by your foolish Quarrels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my Soul, Colonel, I never quarrel'd with any Man, out of design to hurt him in my Life: <HI>Charles</HI> can witness for me, that I hate fighting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>So can every Body else that knows you; I wish you hated Impertinence as much, for the good of Society.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you of all Men living have the least reason to complain; I have run the hazard of my Life many a time for you, and in my Conscience I believe I shall fall your Martyr one time or another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your own you mean, you'll certainly be Canoniz'd by all the Busie-body's about Town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this all the thanks I get for my Friendship? Well <HI>Charles,</HI> well, you shall see I can prefer Safety, and sacrifice my Curiosity too, as you call it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the way to oblige your Friends, Mr. <HI>Mar-plot,</HI> ne∣ver desire to know more than they are willing to tell you, readily comply with a reasonable Demand, and never meddle with any body's Business but your own, this will render you agreeable to all Companies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! But that will make all Companies very disagree∣able to me. <STAGE>(<HI>Aside.</HI>)</STAGE> But Colonel, is there nothing due from one Friend to another? One ought to be let into the bosom Secrets of a Friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not always, for there are some Secrets of such a Nature that will not admit of that Freedom; for Example, suppose your Friend had an Affair with another Man's Wife, or Daughter, where's the advantage of your knowing it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I wou'd watch the Husband or Father in the mean time, prevent his being surpriz'd, and perhaps save his Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how wou'd you save his Honour? A Man of Ho∣nour must have no Confidents in those Cases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then hang Honour, I say, 'tis good for nothing but to spoil Conversation. Shall I beg a pinch of your Snuff, Colonel?</P>

<P>HA, ha, ha; certainly this Fellow is the most mischie∣vous Rogue that ever liv'd; which way got he down the Chimney?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay that's past my finding out, as also what's become of him: I cou'd have cut his Throat with all my Soul just then, and yet I can't help being concern'd for him now, I fear he is kill'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shou'd be sorry for that, tho' in my Conscience he de∣serves it, this busie humour of his is as natural to him as his Food; he follow'd me home this Morning, I was forc'd to use him very roughly to get rid of him, for you must know, I have a trap Door in my Chimney, thro' which I descend into a back Street, where I am conducted by an old Negro to an Angel of a Woman; I had her Summons, and the hour of Assignation was come when he en∣ter'd my Chamber.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very unseasonable Visit, faith Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, was it not? but I quickly dispatch'd him, tho' how he stumbl'd upon you afterwards, and in so odd a manner, is a miracle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he lives we shall know when next we meet; I never catch'd him in a lye, which is the best Qualification he has: But Colonel, did not you promise to introduce me to your <HI>French</HI> Mistress? What, this Lady <HI>incog.</HI> has not beat her out by the by, has she Colonel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, she maintains her Ground too well, there's more danger of my raising the Siege, than her beating the Chamade; she has so many retreats of Pride, Vanity, and Affectation, that without some lucky Accident toss a Granade into the Magazine of her Inclination, there'll be no hopes of the Town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Storm then, Colonel, storm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rather chuse to block her up and starve her out, suffer no Admirer to enter; and if once a Woman of her temper want the Provision of Vanity, she surrenders of course.</P>

<P>Lead the way—where the Devil are they going? now can't I help having a violent desire to follow them, tho' I scap'd so narrowly in my last Project: Yonder they go, ha! they are enter'd already, that is no publick House I'm sure: Egad, may be it is some private Bourdell, or what business can both of 'em have at one House? Well, <HI>Charles,</HI> tho' you was so barbarous to desert me in my Afflictions, I won't serve you so, I'll not stir from this place 'till I see you safe out—Od, upon second thoughts I'll knock at the Door, and ask for him, perhaps three may be as welcome as two.</P>

<P>Ha! my Mind misgives me plaguily that this is an En∣voy from the old Man's Wife, pray Heav'n he has never a Sum∣mons from my old Matron too; for tho' I comply'd with all she ask'd to purchase my Liberty, I am sure I shall have no Stomach to perform Articles. <STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE></P>

<P>Yes, yes, Sir, I hear you—What the duce shall I say to him, he must not know that <HI>Charles</HI> is gone into yon House; for Women here, they say, are cursed Jealous, and that may be a means to have his Throat cut. <STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE></P>

<P>Where does he Lodge?—this must be some new In∣treague, for doubtless t'other knows his Lodgings: Look ye, Sir, one good turn deserves another; let me know what business you have with him, and accordingly as I like it, your Question shall be answered.</P>

<SPEAKER>Isab.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Mar-plot</HI> still, I find he's no changling. <STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE> Why then, Sir, if you must know, I have a Letter for him from a La∣dy who is desperately in love with him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, here's another Intreague popt into my Mouth. In Love with him? prithee dear Youth who is she? where does she live? What's her Name? Is she Maid, Wife, or Widow? Young, or Old? Black, Brown, or Fair? Short, or Tall? Fat, or Lean? this Country, or a Foreigner? quick, quick, quick my dear lit∣tle Rogue, let me into the secret, and I'll carry thee to his Lodg∣ings immediately—Egad this Discovery will make my peace with <HI>Charles</HI> compleatly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isab.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can only answer him these questions, Sir, I am no Blab, you must excuse me if I'm silent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>So must you me, Sir, I'm no Blab neither, Sir, if you go to that, I'd have you to believe I can keep my Friend's secrets when intrusted; I don't know his Lodgings, find them out as you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isab.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very short, Sir; I have nothing to say against your secrecy, but it wou'd be Impudence in me to run the hazard, besides forestalling your Friend's Generosity, he ought to have the disposal of his own secrets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, if it comes into his Hands once 'twill cost me more pains to find out? than 'tis worth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Pains to find out? I hope you never endeavour to find out what other People wou'd conceal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No? yes to chuse; why the duce shou'd any Man know more than my self? We came into the World alike, and I can see no occasion for his superior knowledge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isab.</SPEAKER>
<P>I admire you are not for levelling Estates too; how can you bear any Man to be richer than your self?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh with ease, my Wealth lies in my Mind, I had rather fathom the depth of a Man's Thoughts, than his Pockets; yet to show you I can suppress my Curiosity, let me read the Letter, and I'll excuse the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isab.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is as much as my Life's worth to open the Letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Pox take his Life—tell me what's in't then, or may I be carbonaded if you know his Lodgings. I'd give a Finger to have this Intreague rightly. <STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE></P>

<P>I must not let this Fellow know me, if I intend to con∣ceal my being in <HI>Lisbon</HI>; I'll humour him a little, and try what

<P>Why really, Sir, were I a Woman, I shou'd prefer you before him, but I can't answer for my Lady; if you please I'll mention you.</P>

<L>Had but all Women <HI>Isabinda</HI>'s Mind,</L>
<L>So Constant, Prudent, Virtuous, and so kind,</L>
<L>What Joys so great as Wedlock cou'd we find?</L>
<L>No more shou'd we unlawful Love pursue,</L>
<L>But think our Wives for ever young and new,</L>
<L>And learn from them the Art of being true.</L>

<L>Is the design and business of a Wife;</L>
<L>Still all his Faults with Patience to behold,</L>
<L>And not for ev'ry Trifle rant, and scold:</L>
<L>Men from Example, more than Precept, learn,</L>
<L>And modest Carriage still has power to Charm.</L>
<L>After my Method, wou'd all Wives but move,</L>
<L>They'd soon regain, and keep their Husbands Love:</L>
<L>Our kind Indulgence wou'd their Vice o'ercome,</L>
<L>And with our Meekness strike their Passions dumb.</L>
