<HEAD>EPISTLE DEDICATORY. To the Hon. THO. LYTTLETON, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I would not insult your singular countenance with any thing like the appearance of a blush, I inform you that the following pages are not sacrificed to you as a compliment, but entirely due to you as a most distinguished character. The position, I believe, will stand uncontro∣verted, that there is not another man so circumstanced in the three kingdoms, on whom they would not sit aukward. What∣ever consequences we derive from an ef∣fect, the primary cause should neither be neglected, nor forgotten. Immortal deeds, I own, have been atchieved by the execu∣tive sinews of military veterans; but an acquisition of empire or honours, we rather owe to the wisdom of the <HI>Minister,</HI> than the mechanical prowess of the Troops.</P>
<P>The actions of your life, previous to the AFFRAY in point, have given you that rank in the Annals of <HI>Modern</HI> HEROISM, which your generalship, had it been for∣tunate in this instance, could scarcely ele∣vate.</P>
<P>Human policy, however circumspect, is subject to disasters; and, therefore, we
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
wonder not, that this your last undertaking, although truly meritorious and momentous, has fatally miscarried. But I am no mer∣cenary sycophant, and can therefore accost the great man with honest panegyric, tho' success keep not equal pace with his merits. Be it my business, therefore, in this offering, to proclaim,—<HI>That where∣ever</HI> LYTTLETON <HI>the</HI> II. d <HI>failed, it was neither from ignorance nor inattention, but some over-ruling necessity.</HI>—</P>
<P>I have the vanity to imagine, that these sheets will find their way to all those va∣rious places on the continent, which, ha∣ving once known you, will eagerly snatch the future anecdotes of a man, rendered a glaring phaenomenon throughout Europe. The shades of <HI>Hagley</HI> I could wish sacred from their approach: For the muses will fly abashed their wonted groves;—the venerable and noble Peer must weep blood at that unnatural portrait, where the <HI>Pro∣digal</HI> insultingly refuses the repeated offers of forgiveness, and the virtuous robes of restoration—insolently approaching his aged sire, with the tattered garb of every studied, and possible deformity.—</P>

<HEAD>THE VAUXHALL AFFRAY; OR, MACARONIES DEFEATED.</HEAD>
<P>THE following paragraph appearing in the MORNING CHRONICLE of <HI>Tuesday, July</HI> 27, opened the literary campaign, in which the Maca∣roni forces have so fatally suffered.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"THAT the public may not be mis-informed by the news collectors of an affray and its consequences, which happened at <HI>Vauxhall</HI> last <HI>Friday</HI> night, the following is declared to be the truth of the whole.—Mrs. <HI>Hartley,</HI> the celebrated actress, being in com∣pany with others, among whom was the Rev. Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> and Mr. <HI>Colman,</HI> was put out of countenance, by what she deemed the impudent looks of four or five gentlemen, who purposely placed themselves di∣rectly opposite to her, which obliged her to appeal to Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> on the occasion, who, observing as she did, arose and seated himself between her and these rude-looking gentlemen, who taking offence at this,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
got up one by one, and reconnoitred him with all possible contempt, telling him, the said <HI>Bate,</HI> that he looked like a stout, tight-made fellow, and capa∣ble, no doubt, of bruising; to which Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> re∣plied, They were four impertinent puppies, and could not be gentlemen for their behaviour to Mrs. <HI>Hartley,</HI> &amp;c. This brought on a general dispute, which was divided into <HI>three acts,</HI> till at last a gentleman, one Captain <HI>Crofts,</HI> addressed himself to Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> and asked him, Whether he meant any thing against him? who was answered, No: however, Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> perhaps imprudently, made himself a principal with the rest, and after much ill language had passed, brought upon himself an expression of anger from Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> that he would wring him by the nose: addresses were then given; very scurrilous language was received by Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> afterwards in the Gardens, a challenge was sent to him the next morning, and an appointment made in the afternoon at the Turk's Head Coffee-house, Strand, where Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> with a friend, Mr. <HI>Dawes,</HI> waited with punctuality for near an hour, when Captain <HI>Crofts,</HI> in company with the honourable Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> came in: a short recapitulation began between Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> and Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> who were interrupted by Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> as second to the latter, by desiring that a crisis should be made without words; that Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> should ask the Captain's pardon in the papers, or name his weapon, and go with him in half an hour. Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> in a very manly way, refused begging par∣don, where no offence was given; but after expatiat∣ing on the impropriety of his deciding the difference as a clergyman in a military manner, waved a re∣membrance of his profession in defence of his honour, and agreed to adjourn with Captain <HI>Crofts,</HI> to such
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
place as should be appointed by the seconds, Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI> for Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> for the Captain; who, after exerting every thing in their power to prevent any ill consequences, reduced the causes of quarrel and defence to writing, the better to un∣derstand what ground they were to stand upon, as friends to the combatants, Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> being the whole time as impatient for decision as any man living, who had conceived himself injured; but just as Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI> were going out to chuse their pistols, the Hon. Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> broke in with apparent anger, and demanded satisfaction of Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> for his friend Capt. <HI>Miles;</HI> but Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> remonstrated with him on the great in∣consistency of giving that satisfaction, when Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> and Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> were then going out; yet he insisted on his friend's having satisfaction first; to which Capt <HI>Crofts,</HI> replied, in a way that did him honour, that he was highly offended at the mode of Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI>'s calling on Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> after they had agreed to go out on one and the same quarrel, and said that he never understood that one man was bound to fight a whole company, where the sup∣posed offence was given in gross, and not in par∣ticular. Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> however continued his an∣ger, saying that his friend could not wait, and he was determined Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> should not go out with Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> till his affair was settled. From this circumstance, Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI> then thinking, from the particulars they had heard on both sides, a trifling acknowledgment that each was wrong, would be best, recommended it to the parties, who, with some difficulty complied, and were made friends. Thus ended matters relative to Capt. <HI>Crofts;</HI> and with respect to Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
he declared, that had Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> and their seconds, Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> gone out, he would have prevented a duel, by putting the former under an arrest. The former matter be∣ing thus settled, Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> desired Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> to introduce his friend, who he alledged was in∣jured. He answered, that it would be better with∣out, for that he was a hot-headed man, and might come to blows without ceremony. Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> however, insisted on seeing him, observing that he could not receive any violence from him, being con∣scious he had never offended him. On being intro∣duced, he said, unless Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> would box him, he would beat him in every public place he met him. Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> then said, if he did, he would defend himself; for though he was capable of boxing, he never chose to decide any differences that way, but with those from whom he could have no other satis∣faction; still, as Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> triumphed in this refusal, Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> with very great reluctance, con∣sented to meet him on his own terms, and accord∣ingly a long room was fixed on, and Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI> and Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> were to second the bruisers, who immediately prepared themselves for battle, in the presence of Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall,</HI> and ano∣ther. At first, the advantage seemed against Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> but a fair set-to for about twenty minutes, convinced the company (but particularly Capt. <HI>Miles</HI>) that Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> though inferior in size, was victorious, who never received one blow that he felt. Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> was sent home in a coach, with his face a perfect jelly, and Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> was invited to dine with the Hon. Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> on the morrow, as a proof of the applause he highly merited. A greater instance of true courage never
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
appeared in man, than in Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> who ac∣cording to the proverb, <HI>etiam quos contra statuit equos placatosque demisit,</HI> enforced the applause of his ad∣versaries."</Q></P>
<P>In consequence of the foregoing imperfect ac∣count, the following appeared in the MORNING POST of <HI>Friday, July</HI> 30.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHOULD hold it an insult to the world, if this public appeal on a late dispute, was grounded simply on injuries I had received individually. So∣ciety at large is however so far connected with it, as to render it a matter of some importance; a mis∣representation of facts cannot therefore be permitted, without a manifest partiality to that indecorum my situation compelled me to correct.</P>
<P>There will not be wanting those, even amongst my own fraternity, rigid enough to censure my con∣duct in a <HI>professional</HI> point of view, however com∣mendable it may appear to them in any other. For these I have no other answer, than—<HI>I was neither born a Philosopher—nor bred a Pharisee.</HI> The candid however, from similar feelings with my own, will acknowledge, that during the outrage I complain of, the formalities of my profession might slumber, without any glaring injustice to decency, or religion.—I mean no contempt to the natural laws of gallantry, when waving their sanction I appeal to the more serious one of humanity, where an helpless
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
woman was wantonly, and repeatedly insulted, by a set of poltroons the most wretched, and contemp∣tible.—</P>

<HEAD>The CASE.</HEAD>
<P>BEING at <HI>Vauxhall Gardens</HI> on Friday evening last, I saw Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI> (in company with Mr. <HI>Hartley,</HI> Mr. <HI>Colman,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Tateham</HI>) seated on a bench, not very far distant from the orchestra. Hav∣ing the pleasure of her acquaintance, I joined the party and their conversation; when we presently ob∣served two gentlemen pass by, and look at her in a manner not altogether genteel; however, as custom has in some measure ridiculously indulged our fine gentlemen in these familiarities <HI>en passant,</HI> little or no notice was taken of it. Not satisfied with this in∣dulgence, these gentlemen presently returned, with two or three others of a military <HI>appearance,</HI> who all seated themselves at a table directly opposite to her, and began an attack in form, resolutely determined to stare her out of countenance. Situated in the middle of her company, she bore this treatment for some minutes, before she even complained to Mr. <HI>Hartley</HI> of her distress. Imagining that their triumph was near complete, he begged her to continue her seat, till the conclusion of the Cantata then singing, after which we would all retire. These gallant heroes however still continuing the siege, she found her∣self under the disagreeable necessity of addressing her friends generally, telling us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That the behaviour of these Gentlemen was so uncommonly rude, she could bear it no longer.</HI>"</Q> On this I turned my head, and discovered four of these pretty beings staring at her
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
with that kind of <HI>petit maitre</HI> audacity, which no language, but the modern French, can possibly de∣scribe! and triumphing over those female distresses which their prowess had nobly occasioned.</P>
<P>To be a silent spectator of such insolence, would be tacitly to countenance it; loudly therefore, in order that they might hear it, I observed to her, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I begged she would not be distressed, as I would prevent any future insult of that nature."</Q>—In consequence of which, I immediately placed my∣self on a seat directly between them and Mrs. <HI>Hartley.</HI> This was an intimation, that their behaviour was generally remarked; and I expected to find it at least productive of the end intended; instead of which, I became now the subject of their loud horse∣laughs and wise remarks. Thus unpleasantly cir∣cumstanced, I thought it better to face these despera∣does, and therefore turned about and looked them, in my turn, full in the face; in consequence of which, some distortions of features, I believe, passed on both sides.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Hartley,</HI> during this latter transaction, rose up, and made for the walk; observing which, I followed her, with the rest of the company, first justly remarking as I quitted the scene, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>that they were four impertinent puppies.</HI>"</Q> A gentleman in∣stantly followed me, whom I afterwards found to be Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> of Burgoyne's light dragoons, and asked me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Whether I addressed myself in that speech to him?</HI>"</Q>—To which I replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Certainly not; as I did not recollect to have seen him in the party.</HI>"</Q>—Not satisfied with this answer, he again demanded, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Whether I called him a puppy?</HI>"</Q>—To which I rejoin∣ed as before, adding however, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That the only way to</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<HI>be perfectly convinced in this particular, was to tell me whether he was one of the four, or more, who formed the party, and then the application would come home; for that I said, and still persisted,—the Gentlemen, who so meanly, and scandalously distressed the Lady with whom I was in company, were four dirty, impertinent puppies.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>After this answer, Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> observed, <HI>that I look'd very big upon the occasion,</HI>—surveyed me, with a supercilious kind of air from head to foot, and then remarked, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>You are indeed a good tight fellow, and there∣fore mean to intimidate me I suppose, because you are a boxer.</HI>"</Q> To this he received for reply, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>that box∣ing was by no means my plan; however, as he seemed determined not to be satisfied, but continued to follow me, if he spoke three more impertinent words to me, I would wring his nose off his face.</HI>"</Q>—On this he demanded my name and address, which was instantly given him; I then drew off to my company, imagining that the affair would at least stand peaceably over till the morrow.</P>
<P>Previous to our leaving the Gardens, which we intended to do immediately, we were under the ne∣cessity of walking round, in search of one of our com∣pany; when at the further end of the walk, we dis∣covered our former assailants, now made doubly for∣midable by a considerable augmentation.—No sooner did we approach, than they began a fresh attack with redoubled insolence, interlarding their loud sallies of pleasantry, with <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Twig the Curate,</HI> &amp;c."</Q> Sub∣mitting to this as long as human nature could do, at last I stopp'd short, with a view of knocking down the first man that insulted me; when Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> touched me on the shoulder, called me by name, and
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
begged to speak another word with me, which I com∣plied with, by going back with him; he observed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he had forgotten my address, which was the cause of this second application on that subject."</Q> I immediately told him again, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No. 17, <HI>Clifford's-Inn;</HI> but desired that he would now make sure of it, by getting pen and ink from one of the waiters, and take it down;"</Q> which he did accordingly.</P>
<P>During this transaction, a little effeminate being, whom I afterwards found to be a Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall,</HI> came up to me, dressed <HI>a la Macaroni,</HI> and impertinently asked me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whether any man had not a right to look at a fine woman?"</Q> After getting over my first surprize at this wanton interference of a man, who was not even present at the dispute, I answered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Most certainly; and that I despised the man who did not look at a fine woman; however, I begged leave to observe, that there were two distinct ways of looking at her—with <HI>admiration,</HI> and with <HI>un∣authorized contempt:</HI>—that the conduct I censured, was strongly of the latter kind; and on that I founded my opinion, that the offenders were <HI>four dirty impertinent puppies.</HI>"</Q> On this, he consequen∣tially remarked, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That even <HI>he himself</HI> had been serv∣ed thus, when <HI>he</HI> look'd at a fine woman."</Q> To which I answered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That I had not the least doubt, but that he merited any observation which might be made to him on that head."</Q> On this, he <HI>greatly</HI> answered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he would knock the rascal down who dared to say so;"</Q> and <HI>nobly</HI> put his hand to his sword.</P>
<P>This <HI>interesting</HI> conference was, for the moment, interrupted by Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> who observed, that he supposed I was a Clergyman. Receiving an answer in the affirmative, he said, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Perhaps then, you will
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
take the advantage of your profession, and not give me the satisfaction I shall demand."</Q> To which I replied, That he never should find I availed myself of that, to act in any manner derogatory from the cha∣racter of the Gentleman.—Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> now be∣came abundantly pleasant on this discovery of my profession, which I parried as well as I was able; and, in return, began to hold up this <HI>creature of all creatures</HI> to public derision. The dress, hat and feather,—miniature picture, pendant at his snow∣white bosom, and a variety of other delicate appen∣dages to this <HI>man of fashion,</HI> were naturally seized upon by me, and set off to the best advantage.—Here, however, as the laugh grew warm against him, I was attacked by a <HI>bran-span</HI> new face, another red∣hot Hibernian, who was scarcely intelligible. His ignorance of our language, I believe, preserved me from that insolence, which his savage countenance strongly menaced. Him however I soon cut short, by observing, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the affair could by no means concern him, and that therefore, he was an <HI>im∣pertinent fellow</HI> for his pains."</Q></P>
<P>The company who assembled round us, on this occasion, being desirous of knowing the cause of the dispute, I told it them in a few words, and then appealed, whether I had not done as much as could be expected of me, even if wrong in the first instance, by giving my name and address?—And whether Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall,</HI> or any indifferent person, had a right thus wantonly to interfere in a matter, in which he was by no means concerned?—So far sensible of the impropriety of his conduct, he was generally hooted by the whole company, and jostled into the middle of the Gardens, where I left him to lament his folly; and immediately took coach, and returned with Mrs. <HI>Hartley,</HI> &amp;c. to town.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ABOUT two o'clock in the morning, my ser∣vant came to my bed-side, and awaked me, in order to deliver the following laconic epistle, which he said, he had that instant received from a man who had the appearance of a waiter, and was then in my chambers expecting an answer.</P>

<HEAD>COPY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEREAS you insulted me last night in a manner not to be suffered by a man, much less by a gentleman; I am determined to have satisfaction; and, as boxing is the exercise you seem to pride yourself upon, and the only one that I apprehend you will partake of with me,
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
this is to give you notice, that if you will ap∣point your time and place, I will meet you upon your own terms; and if you do refuse to give me the satisfaction I require, I will hunt you up and down London till I find you, and will then <HI>pull your nose—spit in your face,</HI> and <HI>pull your black coat off your back.</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>Though in expectation of some interview on the preceding night's <HI>fracas,</HI> and perhaps a recapitulation of circumstances, yet I must confess, the style of this letter,—the bearer,—the time,—and mode of its delivery, staggered me not a little. However, I ordered my servant to tell the man who waited with∣out,—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That having some little business to settle in the morning, I must defer seeing the Gentleman till two o'clock in the afternoon, at which time I would expect him.</HI>"</Q>—Contemplation naturally arose with me in the morning, when the impropriety of this intended meeting struck me, having no friend, on my part, to be privy to any transaction that might succeed. I resolved, therefore, to adjourn the <HI>ecclaircissement</HI> of this matter to a place less exceptionable than my own chambers, and in the mean time, prevail upon some friend to be present at the interview. Accordingly I wrote the following, which I delivered to my ser∣vant, with strict injunctions not to leave the cham∣bers on any pretence whatever; that if any Gentle∣man of the name of <HI>Crofts,</HI> or any Gentleman who said he came from Mr. <HI>Crofts,</HI> should call, to deliver it to either of them.</P>

<OPENER>To Captain CROFTS.</OPENER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS in hopes, that a moment's reflection would have convinced you of the general im∣propriety of that conduct last night, I was un∣der the necessity of remarking. However, from a letter the most extraordinary, which I received in bed, at near two o'clock this morning (by the hands I suppose of a waiter) without any date or address, I am sorry to find, that you mean a justification of the measures of your associates, and further, insist upon satisfaction from me for my just censure of them.—The unseasonable hour was the cause of your receiv∣ing a verbal answer,—<HI>that I should be at home precisely at two o'clock, and expect you.</HI> However, upon more serious consideration, I find myself under the necessity of begging you to meet me at the Turk's Head Coffee-house, in the Strand, that I may avail myself of a friend's presence at our interview, lest our conversation be misrepre∣sented.—I shall wait for you till four.—Violent measures are in every point of view disagreeable to me; but, when I wish to avoid them, it can∣not be expected that it should be done at the expence of my honour. I heartily wish our meeting may be different from what your threats seem to denounce; for you must take some pains to bring <HI>me</HI> to extremities. However, sensible that the cause I espouse was strictly a
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
just one, I am determined neither to be shaken from it by menaces, nor intimidated by any of your most desperate resolutions.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Immediately upon this, I repaired in search of, and soon found Mr. <HI>Tateham,</HI> a gentleman who was present at the affray in the Gardens, and who readily accompanied me to dinner to the Turk's Head Coffee-house, in the Strand. On our arrival here, I gave orders to the waiters, that if any gentlemen inquired for me, to shew them to our room. In the course of our dinner, Mr. <HI>Dawes,</HI> a young gentleman of the law, and a friend of mine, hearing of the nature of the dispute, and of my being there, sent in his name, and begged to attend me through it; to this I will∣ingly consented, as Mr. <HI>Tateham</HI> was under the ne∣cessity of going out of town that evening, and I knew not at a certainty when the matter might be finally decided.</P>
<P>Not long after this, Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> attended by his friend, (whom I afterwards found to be the Honour∣able Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI>) arrived, who were immediately shewn in. After some customary civilities on each side, Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> addressed me, by observing, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That he supposed I knew the nature of his visit.</HI>"</Q>—To which I answered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>I certainly did, if that letter which I had then in my hand was written by him, and contained his sentiments.</HI>"</Q>—He rejoined in the affirmative to both;
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
on which I remarked, that it was not possible then we could go out upon the terms he might require, until he had put some of his threats in execution.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> on this warmly interfered; and ob∣served, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>that this was not the time to recapitulate parti∣culars; the matter being simply reduced to one point, which, as Capt.</HI> Crofts<HI>'s friend, he was deputed to ask me,</HI> viz. <HI>Whether I chose to ask Capt.</HI> Crofts<HI>'s par∣don in all the public papers, for saying I would wring his nose off his face, or go out with him in half an hour?</HI>"</Q>—To this peremptory demand, I directly replied:—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That being sensible of no impropriety in this instance, I should not make any concession at all; nor did I think myself justified, after the treatment I had received in Capt.</HI> Crofts<HI>'s letter, to go out with him, till he had executed one of his threats; after which I would certain∣ly attend him.</HI>"</Q>—</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> on this begged leave to reduce the substance of the question and answer to writing; which was done by him and me, in words nearly as above.—After this he asked me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Whether I was not now wrong in urging Capt.</HI> Crofts <HI>to strike me; as from his situation in a military capacity, nothing but the life of one of us could atone for it?</HI>"</Q>—To this I an∣swered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That having been in the army myself, I was not to be informed of the etiquette thereof in this particular; and was therefore apprized of the grounds on which I stood.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>On this Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> observed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>that he must beg then I would go over to France, lest the consequence might prove fatal to his friend.</HI>"</Q>—This new expedition however, I begged leave to wave, by informing him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That sensible of the propriety of my conduct, I would by no means leave England, be the event what it would."</Q>—Here Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> interposed,
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
and said, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The matter might be settled without such an excursion; for as a misrepresentation of my character had been the cause of his sending me the above letter, and being now convinced that the reverse of the report was the fact, he apologized for the error, and acquainted me, that he now looked upon me as a gentleman in every respect."</Q></P>
<P>Immediately upon this, I took him by the hand, confessed his behaviour to be manly, and told him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That as we could now go out as gentlemen, I was ready to attend him, according to his request:"</Q>—Then turning to Mr. <HI>Dawes,</HI> begged he would provide a case of pistols, and any other necessaries that might be wanting. The Ring in Hyde Park being proposed as the ground, I objected to it, for fear of interruption; and therefore recommended to Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dawes,</HI> our seconds, to pro∣vide a more private place; at the same time intimat∣ing a desire, that we might have a gentleman of the faculty near us, in case either of us should unfor∣tunately stand in need of his assistance.—Here Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> observed, that the afternoon was rather an unusual time for these matters, and therefore urged it might stand over till Sunday morning four o'clock.</P>
<P>To this I answered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the affair was dis∣agreeable enough at present in every point of view to me, and therefore I would not on any account, suffer it to hang another night upon my mind."</Q> This, with Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI>'s citing the case of Lords <HI>Townshend</HI> and <HI>Bellamont,</HI> to prove that it was not so very unusual as was represented, produced an unani∣mous agreement, that we should therefore instantly take a post coach and four, with a surgeon, drive down to Richmond-Park, and there finally deter∣mine the whole difference.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20"/>
At the instant we were about to quit the room, Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> abruptly broke in upon us, with his hat on, and, in the most insolent tone of voice, demanded satisfaction of me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in the name of <HI>his friend Capt. Miles,</HI> who was without in the Coffee∣room, waiting with the utmost impatience."</Q> Hay∣ing recovered from the surprize, I answered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he came rather <HI>mal a propos,</HI> as I was going out that moment to settle a point of honour with Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> which I hoped would rectify the whole matter."</Q>—To this he replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That his friend insisted upon satisfaction first; and therefore I should not go out with any other man until he had received it; and that even after this, there were <HI>three</HI> or <HI>four others</HI> who insisted upon the same."</Q>—I now appealed to Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> and Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> to know in what manner I should act; telling them, I could fight but one at a time, and therefore would be directed by them; my second frequently interrupting with similar observations:—I begged leave that Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> would introduce his friend Capt. <HI>Miles,</HI> that I might see this man, whom I was assured I could not have offended.</P>
<P>He replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he could not do that, as Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> was so enraged against me, that probably he might beat me."</Q> I observed, That I fancied myself in the company of Gentlemen; and even at the worst I could defend myself, and therefore begged he might be introduced.—He now informed me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> only came <HI>to fight me my own way; and there∣fore if I</HI> did not box him immediately, he would knock me down wherever he saw me in public."</Q> Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI> now in∣terposed, by observing, That I had behaved in every respect like the gentleman; that from my present
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
conduct, my character must have been totally misre∣presented; and therefore begged this matter might drop, and Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> and I go out to settle our point:—This however Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> flatly refused; but while I was in conversation with him, Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI> consulted together, and agreed, that with my consent, the affair between Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> and me might be adjusted, if some concessions were made on either side; to which I immediately assented, if it could possibly be done consistent with my honour. Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> there∣fore first declared, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI> having been ungenteelly treated, Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> acted with great spirit and propriety in defending her."</Q> To which I readily replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That point being granted, I begged Mr. <HI>Crofts</HI>'s pardon for any unguarded ex∣pression, which arose from a misunderstanding on both sides."</Q></P>
<P>Thus far being amicably settled, we returned to the former subject; and on Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI>'s retiring, Captain <HI>Miles</HI> was introduced. Addressing myself to him, I acquainted him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That I had never seen his face before, and therefore was ignorant how I could offend him."</Q> I therefore begg'd leave to ask him, Whether he was the person who took Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI>'s part in Vauxhall-Gardens? To which he confusedly answered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes; and he now came to take the part of his friend Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall.</HI>"</Q> I told him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he would be disappointed of the satisfaction he intended himself, for that I never boxed with a gentleman, nor ever would; but if he had a violent inclination to box, and nothing would satisfy him without it, I would send for two chairmen, give them a guinea a-piece, and beat, or be beaten, by them."</Q>—Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
now said, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It did not signify talking any more about it, for that if I did not fight him now, Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> was determined to beat me at Vaux∣hall, or any where he next saw me."</Q> To which I answered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I should be there every night next week, and would certainly defend myself."</Q></P>
<P>Here the congress broke up, Mess. <HI>Lyttleton, Fitz-Gerall,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> going out. Not willing they should enjoy any thing like the shadow of a triumph, I run instantly after them into the street, perhaps indeed, imprudently, and, overtaking them on the pavement, opposite Catharine-street, I told the <HI>Captain,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That rather than receive any public insults, if he would fix an hour on Monday morning, and bring either of the gentlemen then with him, I would meet him, and give him the satisfaction he re∣quired."</Q> I received no other answer than <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Damn ye now, Sir.</HI>"</Q>—Not able to contain myself any longer, I beckoned him into the passage of the Spread Eagle Tavern, where we went into the front dining-room, attended by our friends, as before. I again addressed him, and begged he would not insist upon this porter-like business, or that he would tell me how I had offended him; intimating to him, at the same time, that I shrewdly suspected I could beat him. Not being able to pacify him with words, we stripped, and previous to the onset, I addressed Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to testify how disagreeable it was to me; and if there could be a propriety in such an exercise, which I much doubted, begged it might be here observed on both sides."</Q> These proper preliminaries being settled, the <HI>Captain</HI> received in about fifteen minutes the <HI>satisfaction</HI> he required, not being able to discern a single ray of light, by which to find his way home.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23"/>
Three Irish Chairmen, I have this instant learnt, were hired to attend the meeting (according to their own confession to Mr. English, Hosier, in Catharine-Street) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>to see their little Tommy,</HI> (Capt. Miles) <HI>had fair play;</HI>"</Q> and if it came to a riot in the street, that they might lend a friendly hand, to carry the point of an infamous assassin.</P>
<P>This <HI>ungentlemanlike</HI> business being however settled, we all returned to the Turk's Head, except the un∣fortunate Capt. <HI>Miles,</HI> when my conduct was in general highly commended, and Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> on his leaving us, begged I would oblige him with my company to dinner the next day, (Sunday.)</P>
<P>On their departure, Mr. <HI>Dawes</HI> and I began to collect together some circumstances, which led us to suspect, that this Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> was an hired bruiser.—His most amazingly confused address, the manner in which his friends treated him, and his new awk∣ward vestments, all conspired to convince us he was a <HI>made-up gentleman</HI> for the business. Determined, however, to act with caution in the investigation of the matter, the next day when I dined with Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> I asked him in the drawing-room apart, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whether he knew Capt. <HI>Miles?</HI>"</Q> To which he answered, with a shrug of the shoulders, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He did not."</Q> Not a word more on the subject passed the whole day, though Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> and Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> were of the party.</P>
<P>On the Monday morning I was informed, that <HI>his vanquished friend</HI> Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> was Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI>'s own footman. In consequence of this intelligence, which was a confirmation of my own suspicions, I sent the following note to Mr. <HI>Lyttleton:</HI></P>

<P>In consequence of an unseasonable visit from Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> to Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> at his chambers on <HI>Sunday</HI> morning, the following was published in <HI>Monday</HI>'s MORNING POST.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To — FITZ-GERALL, Esq.</OPENER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE honour of your visit to me this morning at one o'clock, was of so singular a nature, that a pub∣lic acknowledgement of it cannot be chargeable with any violent impropriety.—It will save us both an infinity of trouble. The curious will be informed of the circumstances on both sides, without the tedious formalities of separate narrations.—</P>
<P>In the late infamous affray, from whence I de∣rived the melancholy consequence of your ac∣quaintance, it is I believe, generally understood, that I acquitted myself with a tolerable degree of prudence and fortitude. The voice of candour has therefore upon that event, prescribed a solemn di∣stance
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
between us for ever: you will, perhaps, think it too rigid; since it will now scarce permit me to look down upon, or lament the situation of a wretch, since that wretch is the wanton, self-created, out-cast of society. Yet premeditated Villainy must not go unpunished: However dark and secret his footsteps, I will industriously trace the monster, till public atonement be made, or he hide his savage head eter∣nally in oblivion.</P>
<P>I would fain attribute your dark attempt of last night, or rather this morning, to those Bacchana∣lian sallies, which have regularly preceded you to the chair of Infamy: But it savours too much of deliberate villainy, to be less than the machination of some daemon of revenge.—I own my situation was somewhat unpleasant, when four armed gentlemen, attended by two others, came to my chambers in the dead of night, knocked up my servant, and endea∣voured, under a feigned voice, and other specious pretences, to allure me from my bed: the instant I had entered amongst you in the dark, I doubt not but your triumph had been complete. The summons of a known poltroon I never obey, and therefore I escaped; for, Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> I believe was the only one who had even a pretence for speaking with me. I honour the impudence of that man, who, knowing he has too far degraded himself below the dignity of a gentleman ever to be seen in that light again, now talks of nothing but <HI>Bullets and Bagshot.</HI> Before my knowledge of <HI>your friend</HI> Captain <HI>Miles,</HI> you could tamely submit to be called an <HI>impertinent, meddling puppy</HI> in the midst of Vauxhall Gardens; a phrase that would have called forth the resentment of a grocer's apprentice; but when you and the world are informed of the mode of chastisement I have
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
laid out for you, and which is the only one I can now condescend to bestow upon you, we hear of nothing but <HI>Slugs in a Saw-pit.</HI></P>
<P>Think not, young gentleman, that the humours of last night, however oft repeated, will shake me from my resolve. I have zeal in some instances, which may surmount the resolution of an assassin. Should you continue to watch each pale moon to her cham∣bers of retirement through the circling year, and then steal out when darkness reigns propitious to your de∣sign, still, as long as I can escape the stiletto, the ruffian shall be dragged forth, however reluctant, to public view; where, as his designs were dark and hor∣rid, his punishment shall be proportionably ignomi∣nious.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the Rev. Mr. HENRY BATE.</OPENER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE unwarrantable freedom you have taken with my character in your narrative of the Vauxhall trans∣actions, and the little regard you have paid to truth and candour, constrain me to lay before the public a
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
<HI>true</HI> and <HI>impartial</HI> account of that affair, so far as I had any concerns in it directly or indirectly: Nor can I entertain the least doubt, but that upon a fair hearing, my conduct from the beginning to the end will bear the common sterling stamp of the gentleman, the man of honour, and, (if rightly considered by Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> himself) the <HI>real friend.</HI></P>
<P>To begin then my justification; even you your∣self, Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> will do me the justice to acknowledge I was not present when the pretended rudeness you so much complain of was offered to Mrs. Hartley. In fact I was in another part of the gardens: But the rumour being instantaneously spread over the whole place, that Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> had been insulted with the grossest abuse and foulest language by a gentleman then unknown; I own, Sir, I made what expedi∣tion I could to find my friend, in order, if possible, to prevent any fatal consequences. When I found Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> Sir, you was in conference with him, words had run very high between you both, and the cause of all this <HI>fracas,</HI> it seems, was, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI> had been looked at in a manner (as you say) not altogether genteel."</Q> This being the ground of the quarrel, I thought there was room to qualify the supposed affront that had unintentionally been given to this lady, and I observed, that certainly every man had a right to look at a <HI>fine woman.</HI> I flattered myself, that by giving Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI> that epithet, which so justly is her due, I should receive at least a decent, if not a polite answer, more especially as I declared to you, that I only came to <HI>mediate</HI> the af∣fair. Sir, I am now appealing to the tribunal of the public, and upon my honour I solemnly de∣clare I had no other intentions when I accosted you, but to mediate the affair between Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> and
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
you. The one I knew to be a gentleman, the other, by his dress, <HI>appeared</HI> to be so; and I was in hopes of reconciling you both. But, Sir, what opinion must the public have of your veracity in telling your own tale, when, instead of thanking, or at least meeting me half way in my endeavours to <HI>mediate,</HI> you abruptly an∣swered in these very words, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Damn you for your mediation;</HI> you are an impertinent puppy for your pains."</Q> This answer of yours, Sir, you have not only jesuitically with-held from the public; but you are pleased to tell them another story, and add, <Q REND="inline">"that on this, I <HI>greatly</HI> answered, I would knock the rascal down who dared to say so, and nobly put my hand to my sword."</Q> Sir, you know in your own conscience I never men∣tioned the word rascal, nor did I tell you that I would knock any man down who dared to say so. Nature, Sir, has not cast me in an athletic mould, nor has the science of bruising had any share in my gymnastic education. It is true, indeed, when you gave me the ungentlemanlike answer I have mentioned above, I observed to you that you had no sword, but that you might easily borrow one, and that we had better retire than make any noise in so public a place. I declare, Sir, upon my honour, that at the time I gave you this whisper in the ear, I was an utter stran∣ger to your profession; nor, from your preceding be∣haviour, could I possibly divine that you were in <HI>holy orders;</HI> much less could I dream of any such thing by the answer you gave me, which was, that you did not chuse to encounter me <HI>that way,</HI> but that, if I had a mind to try my skill at bruising, you was entirely at my service. Thus, Sir, stood the <HI>demelé</HI> I had with you, when Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> gave me to understand that you was a PARSON. Upon this ecclaircissement you are pleased to say, that <Q REND="inline">"I became abundantly plea∣sant
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
and witty upon your ecclesiastical character."</Q> The real truth is, and I will not disguise it, I replied, That I was ashamed of your behaviour, and that you ought to have your gown publicly stripped from off your shoulders; and from that moment I determined, Sir, even though your conduct towards me had been a thousand times more reprehensible than it really was, and though you had sworn a thousand more oaths than I am sorry to say you did, I determined within my own mind to pay every possible respect to your cloth, and treat you as a man, who, if not out of his senses, was at least within the sacred pale and protection of the church. For, Sir, I had a character at stake, which I might have endangered, had I applied either my sword or my cane, knowing you to be a clergy∣man. But, Sir, notwithstanding the lenity and pru∣dence I manifested on this occasion, I cannot help repeating, that I think you deserve to have your cas∣sock pulled over your ears. I may, however, be erroneous in my judgment, as no person is a proper judge in his own cause; but if you think my judg∣ment in the wrong, Sir, I am very willing to submit the censure I thus pass upon your public conduct to the decision and final adjudication of your own Dio∣cesan, who, I understand, is the Bishop of London, and whom all the world must allow to be a competent arbitrator.</P>

<OPENER>To GEO.-ROBERT FITZ-GERALL, Esq.</OPENER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN villainy has wrought the human mind to a certain degree of deformity, the phaenomenon, at∣tracting our admiration, may influence the weakest of our passions.—Having confessed the originality of your character, and even now astonished at such a wonder-work of Providence, considering the frailty of human nature, I wish our dealings hereafter to be as limited as possible. I own that you have betrayed me into a weakness, by forcing me for a moment to dis∣pute the rectitude of the universal system. But, doubtless, the same extensive Wisdom who gave being to the <HI>blood-enveloped house-breaker,</HI> and <HI>assassinating foot∣pad,</HI> found it necessary, in his mysterious operations, to create a being, in whom should center the defor∣mities of both. The man, impatient of violent in∣juries, may here be rather innocently led to arraign the Divine Justice; but I am thankful, that reflection has weight enough with me to banish such melancholy ideas; and rejoice from thence to find, that a sacred <HI>ne plus</HI> is assigned even to the most refined degeneracy. If we could ever be led to doubt the position, your letter of this day must convince us—<HI>that the vicious ignorance of the darkest profligate betrays itself in language; and that his vices are therefore seldom or never contagious, but from a personal intercourse.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33"/>
Being now in no danger of becoming a convert to the creed of libertinism and treachery, from the im∣potence of those arguments dealt out for their support by niggard Nature, a distant correspondence of this kind I will never refuse you. If such condescension can at all amuse in this your disgraceful state of exile from society, I have that Christian charity which will not let me with-hold it from you.—Forlorn and wretched as you really are, I will give you a tempo∣rary relief from the pangs of self-conviction, by en∣ticing your feeble talents ever and anon into their di∣minutive kind of exertion.</P>
<P>Dragged forth with horrible reluctance, ten days being elapsed, you make a miserable entrance in this day's <HI>Gazetteer;</HI> and after the example of every self∣convicted culprit, unwilling to plead <HI>guilty,</HI> you make a contemptible appeal to the public, in the nature of a defence. Generously giving <HI>you</HI> credit for its ma∣sterly formation, I apprehend the whole burden of it to be strictly this:—<HI>That your interposition was that of a mediator;—that I damn'd you for your mediation, and called you an impertinent puppy for your pains;—that you told me I had no sword on, but that I might borrow one;—and that I replied, I did not chuse to engage you that way, but that if you had a mind to try your skill at bruising, I was entirely at your service.</HI>—</P>
<P>Unfortunately for you, my gentle <HI>Paris!</HI> not a shadow of truth rests on either of these assertions, ex∣cept that indeed of your being <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>an impertinent puppy for your pains,</HI>"</Q> which I acknowledged in my letter of yesterday to have said to you; nor need you there∣fore have taken such an infinity of pains to enforce, what is already so strongly impressed on my mind, and on that of the public.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34"/>
Rescued from the danger as a naked man, I can∣not now but laugh at your savage notions of a media∣tor;—but my wonder ceases, when I recollect to have read of two gentlemen going out to fight, one of whom was shot through the head by a mediatorial friend, in order to prevent the consequence of a tri∣umph on either side.—I fancy Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> cannot but recollect the mode of your first address, and there∣fore I will not enforce the evidence of <HI>my friends,</HI> till that gentleman, or some other, will step forth in public, and bear <HI>you</HI> witness. As far as respects the sword business, it is entirely either the effect of a phrensied and distempered brain, or the paltry, forged evasion of an equivocating reptile. To one and the same cause must I assign the origin of the <HI>bruising,</HI> since I repeatedly and studiously told you all, THAT <HI>was never my plan.</HI> Nay, had it been,—what could tempt me to it, when Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> was the tiny object of my resentment! I appeal to your friend Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> whether I did not repeatedly disown such a mode to <HI>him?</HI> and if I waved it here, where some triumph might have been the consequence, how could I condescend to think of such an operation, when your little presence of aerial divinity courted my thoughts from manhood, to a silent contemplation of the progressive beauties of the pigmy system?</P>
<P>No, my dear little whimsey-formed being, let no such rude forebodings disturb thy pretty peace in future! Terrific as my strides appear to such silphs and silphids, I have long forgotten that school-boy pleasure of <HI>breaking butterflies on the wheel;</HI> nor would I now crush a noxious reptile, had it not attempted to sting the foot, that meant not to disturb it.</P>
<P>I cannot take leave of you, without acknowledging your political merit, in referring the nature of our
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
dispute to the arbitration of the <HI>Bishop of London.</HI> I will not accuse <HI>you</HI> with the thought, notwithstanding its excellence.—Candid as it may appear, I must however decline it, tho' no man esteems this illustri∣ous prelate more than I do. I know his worth, as a man; his excellence, as a christian: yet his decree must be in some respect, opposite to the feelings of humanity. You know not perhaps, the motto of the reverend bench, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>If a man smite thee on the right cheek, turn unto him thy left also.</HI>"</Q> This, I own is an ex∣cellent system, accompanied with lawn sleeves: these pious appendages have a soporific quality, depriving the wearers of any other than a theorical knowledge of it. However, point me not out to their Lordships as an heretic in this instance; for I have no objection to fall into their notions, upon similar terms.—</P>
<P>The fiery taper of youth will naturally burn less and less glaring, as Time with frigid hand shall call forth his hoary emblems on our head. The mitre then adorns the reverend brow; the holy crosier guards its <HI>single</HI> priest from violence.—In this calm stand-still of life, the hour may come, when I shall wish for such sacred protections; and without an abundance of miracles, time might vouchsafe to work me to the sacred purpose.—Then, being free from the wanton attacks of libertinism, my right-reverend feelings, would be reduced to a narrow and peaceable compass;—then could I perhaps, declaim in favour of that non-resistance which my youthful impetuosity pointed out as no virtue, and even being smitten by Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> on the right cheek, might, from a fortitude truly religious,—<HI>turn unto him my left also.</HI></P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the Rev. Mr. HENRY BATE.</OPENER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE letter I addressed to you, Sir, in <HI>Monday</HI>'s Gazetteer, I flatter myself hath fully convinced the impartial Public, my conduct throughout this trans∣action hath been that of the gentleman, and the man of honour: <HI>of the gentleman,</HI> by my treating you as such, so long as I took you to be a LAYMAN. <HI>Of the man of honour,</HI> by ceasing to demand satisfaction, the very moment I knew you to be in <HI>holy orders.</HI> It now remains that I convince the same impartial Public, that I also acted to you as a real friend; I say <HI>real friend,</HI> Sir, because if I see a Clergyman of the Church of England scandalously exposing himself in public, and can possibly make him feel his folly so as to prevent a return of a similar paroxysm; I think, Sir, even in your own opinion, I must be allowed to be doing that Clergyman an act of real friendship. If you grant me this position, then my reply is, <Q REND="inline">"Na∣than, thou art the man."</Q> For I appeal to the whole company who were that night at <HI>Vauxhall,</HI> whether they did not deem you, as a man, lost to all sense of public shame, public character, and public decorum?</P>
<P>Desperate as your <HI>disorder</HI> was, I did not despair to cure it. The only doubt with me was the <HI>modus curandi.</HI></P>
<P>To have consigned you over to <HI>Lord Mansfield</HI>'s tipstaff might possibly have had a temporary effect,
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
but it would not have gone to the root of the disorder, and a relapse in such a calenture as yours, seemed to me to be death unavoidable.</P>
<P>On the other hand, had I taken this matter up se∣riously, had I attempted to convince you, that the fate of nations is not now-a-days, decided by bodily strength or muscular adroitness, but by the fusil, bay∣onet, and cannon; and that consequently, in a poli∣tical point of view, the science of bruising, so far as it relates to gentlemen who are born to command fleets and armies, can be of no service, and therefore contemned by them as a thing of no value; nay, had I even acknowledged that I approved of this <HI>bruising science,</HI> when confined to the lower class of people, because I think the national habits of vulgar courage ought never to be checked; I say, Sir, had I attempt∣ed to have reasoned with you in this manner, I should only have added fuel to fire. The only method then I could make use of with any hopes of success, was to hold up to you the mirror of ridicule, not doubting but that I should find with the poet Horace,<Q><L><HI>Ridiculum Aeri</HI></L><L><HI>Fortius ac Melius, magnas plerumque secat res.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>On this plan, Sir, I will not conceal from you, that my first intention was to have borrowed one of <HI>Foote</HI>'s wooden heroes; strip him stark naked, put him in a true Broughtonian attitude, and have told you, that he insisted upon your fighting him. It was ob∣jected, that you must certainly see through the game that was going to be played upon you. I was, indeed, of a different opinion; and I observed, that if the Knight of La Manch, who, in every respect, that of <HI>frantic courage</HI> excepted, was an excellent scholar,
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
and an accomplished gentleman, could seriously en∣counter a wind-mill, or a barber's bason, your dis∣order being similar to his, you would easily fall into a similar deception, <HI>specie recti.</HI>—However, Sir, to comply with my friends, I suffered my opinion to be over-ruled; yet unwilling to leave you uncured, I dressed one of my servants, introduced you to him, as a person you greatly affronted, and a pitched battle ensued between you both, to the great diversion of the few bye-standers, who were privy to the secret, which hath been pompously recorded by your own pen in the Morning Post. But there is one little circumstance, which out of charity I now tell you, and that is, I gave my servant strict orders not to beat you unmercifully, and when we thought he had given you a sufficient dose, we not only interposed and parted you, but we highly commended your bravery, and made you believe that you had sealed up both the peepers of the redoubtable Capt. <HI>Miles.</HI></P>
<P>The good intention I had in playing the risible farce upon you, was, that when you should come to the denouement of the plot, you might see <HI>quasi in speculo</HI> into what an infinite number of absurdities, embar∣rassments, and vulgarisms your <HI>unclassical</HI> propensity for bruising must, <HI>as a Clergyman,</HI> unavoidably betray you; for, a man, not absolutely bereft of reason, to see his error, is to be half cured of it; and I had flattered myself, indeed, that I had happily made this half-way progress, and was determined to be an au∣toptical witness of the real fact. With this intent I went last <HI>Saturday</HI> to your chambers in <HI>Clifford's-Inn;</HI> Mr. <HI>Montague,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Storer</HI> were so obliging as to accompany me. It was nearly eleven o'clock at night, when I pleased myself with thinking that cool reason would have resumed her empire, and
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
that I should have found you preparing yourself for the next morning's function of your holy office, and that consequently all rancour, animosity, and ill-will was buried for ever in oblivion. But, Sir, how greatly were my hopes crest-fallen, when after gently knocking at your door, I found it barricadoed against me, though I repeatedly told you my name, and the real purport of my visit. In return for this my care and attention, all the satisfaction I could obtain was, to hear myself called, <Q REND="inline">"an assassin,"</Q> with reiterated assurances from your own lips, that the first time you should meet me, either in the Mall, Vauxhall, Ra∣nelagh, or the Pantheon, you would break every bone in my skin. Sir, it is an easy matter to talk of breaking bones; but if you are not <HI>incurably gone,</HI> I now caution you not to attempt putting your menaces into execution. For if I must be serious with you, Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> you ought to know that the gentleman who can respect the protection of your cloth to a cer∣tain degree, will beyond that degree protect himself. And I must further observe to you, that if in the de∣fence of my person, any <HI>fatal consequence</HI> should happen either to you or myself, the blame will now lie at the door of your Diocesan, and not at that of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To GEO.-ROB. FITZ-GERALL, Esq.</OPENER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE thread of inconsistent villainy being this day re-united, I have now before me the whole contemp∣tible defence of the most daring, yet ridiculous, dis∣turber of the public peace.—It has been observed, that my former letters soared too far above the nar∣row limits of your puny understanding. I admit in part the propriety of the remark, and therefore, in this reply, I shall studiously confine myself to that simplicity of language which is found the abler advo∣cate in the cause of virtue.</P>
<P>Pardon me, if here I breathe a digressive sigh for some noble and worthy personages, who, till the fatal conclusion of your letter, had comforted themselves with a flattering idea, that their kinsman was rather vicious from accident, than from principle, or fatal necessity. The tears of penitence, young man, are a grateful and efficacious offering even to despairing friends, winning them, as it were, by enchantment, almost to our own terms of remission;—but, from your example, we are taught not to wonder, that a wanton and stubborn perseverance alarms the dig∣nity of their fortitude, and bids them renounce for ever the villain they could not reclaim.—</P>
<P>I have hitherto, Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall,</HI> in this correspond∣ence with you, trifled with my own consequence,
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
rather pursuing the delusive flights of imagination, than standing forth simply your accuser, as the injured man. However, a just and public sacrifice can never be out of season, and therefore I will now pin you down to that public stake of infamy, from which the extravagance of your conduct will never let you rise. Behold me, therefore, literally a rigid accuser, no longer wishing to trifle with the despondency of a cri∣minal, or the patience of the public, his appointed judge.—If shame will permit you to look up, you may now see how truly formidable is an injured indi∣vidual rationally collected, and inspired with a strong but temperate fortitude, the powerful staff ordained to support him.—The public, Sir, are impatient for the decision, and therefore no <HI>hired</HI> evasions will longer avail you. The following black indictment courts your dejected eyes; and truly dismal is such a scroll, which bears the stamp of unshaken authen∣ticity.—</P>
<LIST>
<HEAD>CHARGES Against GEORGE ROBERT FITZ-GERALL, Esq.</HEAD>
<ITEM>I. I have all along accused you, and now more solemn∣ly accuse you of being a wanton leader of the second attack against me in Vauxhall-Gardens;—of being an impertinent meddler in my dispute with Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> to whom I had previously given my name and address; averring that the mode of your <HI>mediatorial</HI> interpo∣sition was audacious, and presuming.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. I accuse you of publickly sporting with my pro∣fession; of putting your hand to your sword against
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
me as a naked man, without the least intimation <HI>at any time</HI> of your desiring satisfaction of me for the extorted ridicule, you received from me in the Gar∣dens.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. I accuse you of breaking into a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It remains to be answered—How Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> came to know of this place of meeting, except from Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> or Mr. <HI>Lyttleton;</HI> as Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> never called at Mr. <HI>Bate</HI>'s chambers; nor did even Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> and his second, Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> know it was to be at the Turk's-Head, until the receipt of Mr. <HI>Bate</HI>'s letter to Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> a few minutes before their arrival there.</NOTE> private room the next morning, in the most insolent manner, just at that instant when Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> and I were going out to terminate our difference; and, ruffian-like, pre∣vented it, by insisting that your <HI>friend</HI> Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> should have satisfaction <HI>first.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. I accuse you of introducing your own servant to me as <HI>a gentleman</HI> and <HI>an officer;</HI> and of persisting in my <HI>boxing</HI> with this savage, notwithstanding the interposition of Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> and Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> who repeatedly told you <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>that my character had been mis∣conceived, and that I had acted in every respect like the gentleman, and man of honour.</HI>"</Q></ITEM>
<ITEM>V. I accuse you likewise of hiring three other Irish ruffians, and planting them at the door of Mr. <HI>English,</HI> the corner of Catharine-street, in order to aid and assist in your infamous project, should it be necessary to <HI>enforce</HI> it in the street.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="44" REF="43"/>VI. I accuse you of totally <HI>misrepresenting</HI> the <HI>consequences</HI> of the <HI>boxing business,</HI> since <HI>your friend</HI> was beat stone∣blind in reality, and I did not receive a single blow.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. I accuse you of <HI>misrepresenting</HI> the time of your in∣tended assassination at my chambers on the Sunday morning, it being more than a <HI>quarter after one o'clock,</HI> as can be testified, if necessary, by the affi∣davit of the porter of the Inn.—</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>This dark catalogue of positive charges, I solemn∣ly lay at your door, and defy your every exertion to remove them. The fact on which they are ground∣ed, I shall conceive as admitted even by your own partizans, who were present at the transactions, ex∣cept one or more of them step publicly forth, and confute them. I now leave you for the present despicable in the eyes of this vast metropolis, and even condemned, alas! by the generous natives of your own kingdom; whose notions of honour, though sometimes too chimerical, will not permit them even to rank with a countryman, who, harsh as it may sound, stands convicted as An INCENDIARY,—a LYAR,—and a POLTROON.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><HI>To the Rev. Mr.</HI> BATE.</OPENER>
<P>BY seeing this letter in the paper, do not think I mean to continue a literary correspondence with you, Sir, who thrive by scandal, and live upon defamation; I therefore declare, that as this is the first, so it shall be the last time I will publish any thing concerning the late affair at Vauxhall. I had indeed imagined that you and I, Sir, had finally settled all our differences: but as I find you have revived the subject, by your letters in the Morning Post, it is incumbent upon me to set the misinformed public right, in some particulars which you have grossly falsified.</P>
<P>You publicly call upon me to certify the truth of your having declined boxing, during the whole course of your proceedings. Now, Sir, I as publicly declare, that so far from declining, you long insisted upon it, refusing me the satisfaction I required, and calling upon me to put my threats into execution, which, you said, you would resent with your fist, and your fist only; and it was in consequence of Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI>'s assuring you, that the issue of the affair must then of necessity be fatal, that you condescended to <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"wave your privilege;"</Q> and, for the first time in your life, put yourself upon the footing of a gentleman.</P>
<P>Again, Sir, in your letter to Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall,</HI> you assert that I said, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI> having been ungen∣teelly treated, Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> acted with great spirit and propriety in defending her."</Q>—This, Sir, as I
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
never thought, I never said: the concluding words that passed between us were as follows; I confessed that you would have acted properly in protecting a lady who had in your company been publicly affronted, but that I did not think Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI> came under that predicament; and as to myself, I neither intended nor offered her an insult. In answer to which, you re∣plied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am sorry my passion forced improper words from me, and I ask your pardon."</Q> These, Sir, were your words; and as they were much attended to, they must have been heard and remembered by every gen∣tleman present. I little thought the affair would have terminated thus amicably, as I was far from imagining that there would have been any stop put to my determined resolution of chastising your in∣solence.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, I take my leave of you, advertising you that I have heard of your <HI>terrific</HI> threats, and denun∣ciations of revenge. These I look upon as the ravings of a lunatic, and the frantic workings of a distempered brain. If, however, you have coolly concerted schemes of meditated vengeance, I shall not, Sir, appeal to the mediation of your diocesan, or the interposition of Justice Fielding. I, Sir, am a soldier, and look equally with an eye of contempt at the mischief of a monkey, and the malice of a monk.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS a man truly sensible of your situation, I cannot but pity your misfortunes.—You must at last I think discover, the fatality of your league with an abandoned and despicable associate, who will not let you now en∣joy that retreat from an extravagant imprudence, which your penitentials, and my sympathy, had hap∣pily wrought for you. Convicted himself,—after the most candid and dispassionate hearing, he seems divested of that savage kind of clemency which has dignified the robber and assassin; who bear individually the ven∣geance of society, rather than involve the partner of their guilt in the horrors of their punishment. This was the <HI>etiquette</HI> of heroic villainy; but now lost in the dastard refinements introduced by our modern <HI>fine gentlemen:</HI> for Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> has hauled you forth, ere the conscious blush of guilt had lost its empire o'er your cheek, insisting that you shall make a similar atonement with him, and that on the same public, and disgraceful scaffold.</P>
<P>With what a becoming diffidence do you face the world, Mr. <HI>Croftes,</HI> in this day's <HI>Gazetteer!</HI>—Your anticipations are so melancholy and well founded, that I could, as far as respects myself, let them die away contemptibly with the jargon and nonsense of the day.—We lament the distresses of the wretched, culprit mariner, who declares with aching heart, that if he weathers but the perils of his present voyage, he ne'er
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
will tempt the watery main again.—Yet Society has its sacred claims on culprits of every denomination; on that account, though you studiously wish to pre∣clude my reply, I cannot let you fall a slow and mi∣serable sacrifice to your own wretched feelings and falsehoods, when one friendly crush may annihilate you for ever.</P>
<P>After a lethargy of three tedious summer weeks, you are roused from your somnolency, and <HI>now</HI> attempt to invalidate a simple narration of facts, which your silence, and the public candour, have solemnly con∣firmed. However apparently insignificant its orbit, that little fiery meteor <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> has its influence I perceive on certain <HI>pliant</HI> bodies; forcing the timid into that disgraceful service in which he himself has been so shamefully defeated. The servile awe with which the whole <HI>petit maitre</HI> tribe look up to this gilded phantom of prowess, is a justification of your prudence. I jump with you in opinion, that an ex∣perimentary insult on a peaceable clergyman, who fights not but from necessity, is less hazardous, than even a difference in opinion with another, whose va∣lour is founded on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was one, amongst others, of Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI>'s observations to me (perhaps <HI>in terr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="4+ letters" DISP="••••…"/></HI>) at the Turk's Head. It seems not to tally, however, with an anecdote now circulating at <HI>Stuart</HI>'s, in Bond-street; where a case of pistols are said to be still hanging as disgraceful <HI>mementos</HI> of Mr. <HI>F—'s</HI> forgetfulness.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline">"<HI>his having fought eleven duels,</HI>"</Q> and whose principal beauty arises from having lost the roof of his skull by a pistol shot.—</P>
<P>The world, Sir, are already convinced of your folly, and my circumspection.—I will not therefore now dispute with you myself on the two facts, the subject of your letters, which you have so totally misrepre∣sented. The candid will be satisfied without it; and even the incredulous shall be eased of any doubts and
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
scruples about it, by the public testimony of those Gentlemen, who were present at the discussion.</P>
<P>I cannot however but remind you of this aukward introduction of yourself to the public.—You ac∣knowledge to stand forth on my appeal.—Now, Sir, if my memory serves me, the appeal was to prove, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I observed to you repeatedly at <HI>Vauxhall,</HI> that boxing was by no means my plan, and therefore, if I refused to <HI>you,</HI> where some honour might suc∣ceed a bruising conquest, how could I (in <HI>Vauxhall</HI> observe) think of such a mode with the tiny <HI>Fitz-Gerall?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Your masterly reply (admitting it true for the mo∣ment) is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That I insisted upon your putting the threats of your letter in execution, &amp;c. &amp;c. <HI>the next day at the Turk's Head Coffee-house.</HI>"</Q> This is a mode of advancing so truly <HI>Hibernian,</HI> that nothing but Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI> having a mechanical command of you, could possibly have occasioned.</P>
<P>I believe I have worked myself up into that phi∣losophical contempt for complicated vice and folly, to be able to <HI>hear</HI> any thing you can advance, how∣ever false and atrocious, without the least emotion. Since your own <HI>passive</HI> disposition, and the well-con∣certed interposition of an <HI>Irish renegado,</HI> and his at∣tendant ruffians, prevented the proof positive of my courage, I will not sigh for a fresh opportunity of displaying it, but rather be thankful, that <HI>my</HI> honour has been preserved, without the loss of blood on either side.—You may now indulge yourself, young man, with paroxysms of rage and vengeance; since neither <HI>my</HI> necessities, nor vices, are so pressing, as seriously to demand my forfeit life,—since I never mean to be∣friend that most abject of all beings, who has not spirit enough to disengage <HI>himself</HI> from his miseries, but
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>
cowardly courts another's hand to drive him from ex∣istence.</P>
<P>As a proof that I never vowed the least vengeance against <HI>you</HI> whatever, I will even consent that all your anxieties shall cease in future.—You shall be a man of <HI>gallantry,</HI>—but it must only be in those politer re∣gions, <HI>where beaux plume themselves on distressing the fair sex!</HI>—You shall be a <HI>man of honour</HI>—in that country where they ask a public, and an ignominious acknowledgment of a supposed offender, or his blood in half an hour, and yet after that—<HI>blush not to make the first concession.</HI>—You shall be a man of <HI>cool,</HI> tho' <HI>resolute courage,</HI>—where danger is happily precluded by <HI>the known interposition of some generous friends.</HI>—You shall be a man of <HI>strict veracity,</HI>—where, after having been mean in one instance, they get over it, by <HI>honestly denying the fact</HI> in another.</P>
<P>Nay! come back from <HI>Richmond;</HI>—for, however offensive to Colonel <HI>Burgoyne,</HI> you shall even be a SOLDIER still!—But it must be in that arduous service, where FORTS and ARMIES own your friend <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI>'s hereditary government; where they fight with scented quil pop-guns, loaded with <HI>bleu mange;</HI>—whose armour is composed of miniature pictures, and chicken gloves;—who escape the severities of a noxious climate, by an artificial atmosphere of ambrosial essences.</P>

<P>YOUR paragraph respecting the late fray at <HI>Vaux∣hall Gardens,</HI> diverted me more than any thing I have met with for some time. Surely it could not be as I have heard it whispered: Is it possible little <HI>Coly</HI> could conceal himself under the Lady's petticoats all the while?

'Twas very good up∣on my word: I admire <HI>Coly</HI>'s policy; he could not have got a better bully in the world than a priest; their blows are weighty; he knows that he has ex∣perienced them, and lately too.—Was it not great! plume thy feathers, wench, for who but thee could charm two sages from the solemn chair of sophistry, and make them take the cudgel for the pen?—Well, 'tis an ill wind that blows no one any good;—the parson is to write a play—<HI>Coly</HI> is to bring it out—the lady is to play a principal part in it—and the town
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>
is to be diverted with it, as no doubt it will—good luck for the town—some comfort for our theatrical expectations—since there was never a <HI>better</HI> manager than <HI>Coly</HI>—a <HI>better</HI> actress than the Lady—or a <HI>subli∣mer</HI> poet than the parson—and I—but don't tell any body—I intend to write them a farce—and what do you think I mean to call it, eh?—perhaps you cannot guess, and so I'll tell you—The <HI>Vauxhall Fray,</HI> or a <HI>Peep through the Pocket-hole</HI>—damn'd good, is it not?—don't you think 'twill <HI>take?</HI>—if it don't, the devil <HI>take</HI> the town, I say—perhaps I may take it in my head to send it you in a day or two, and if you don't like it, I'll give you leave to print it without my consent, and take the copy-right out of my hands, in spight of my teeth.</P>

<P>PEEP-O-MALICO is one of the greatest wits that has ever exhibited in your paper, or indeed in any other; it is pity but his courage was equal to his wit, but where is the man that excels in all things?—He was certainly a party in that entertaining <HI>fracas</HI> which he has immortalized by his pen, and, from his description of <HI>Coly</HI>'s fear, seems entirely to understand that sensation and its effects.—The public must be delighted with his proposal to write a farce on the oc∣casion; I have no doubt it will be an admirable per∣formance,
<PB N="53" REF="52"/>

<P>THE public has been lately much obliged to the literary talents of a Reverend Gentleman, for investi∣gating a difference between himself and an other, founded on a political cause; they are now enter∣tained with one something similar, and equally as important to the world, but formed on a voluptuous one; for what, Sir, can we style a party at <HI>Vauxhall,</HI> an intimate acquaintance with a Lady in a public character, and a display of knight-errantry in her de∣fence, but an offering to the shrine of Pleasure? Our young Clergy, convinced of the ill effects of theolo∣gical disputes, are contriving some means to soften the austerity of religion; sensible how disgustful sub∣jects of that nature are become to this polite age; they have changed the tedious disquisitions of the fathers, to the more gentle topicks of gallantry and honour. 'Tis true their intention is humane and cha∣ritable, worthy the applause of the present rewarders of merit; but methinks (to please the generality of mankind) the transition is rather too rapid. Though Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> did not contemplate, like <HI>Harvey,</HI> the calm delights of a garden, he might have shunned the tu∣multuous reverse; he might have enjoyed the social converse of a friend, without making himself the partizan of a quarrel; he could have noticed an in∣sult to a Lady, without particularizing himself in an affair which her husband thought uninteresting. Per∣haps he was impelled by a warmer motive, and had a deeper sense of her distress than the other gentlemen present; but still he should have considered the badge of his profession, and stifled his resentment to some
<PB N="55" REF="54"/>
degree of stoicism. The world is too apt to judge from such appearance, that priests are juggling with their consciences, that their own example shews the decency and ceremony of religion, is nothing more than a cheat upon them. Great changes are brought about slowly and imperceptibly; men of pleasure will admire the spirit of Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> but those who are wont to approach a pulpit, will reflect that the old precepts of obedience and humility, are violated by the very hand and tongue that enforced them; they will appeal to their own understandings, and despise the man who attempts to pay so ill a tribute to their memories, and by losing the good opinion of a few, may fail of their salutary designs in general.</P>
<P>These, Sir, are my thoughts upon the subject, which, if you please, you may communicate to the Public, that those who are engaged in Mr. <HI>Bate</HI>'s laudable plan, may avoid those indiscretions he has been guilty of, and by a <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"cunning working of the scene,"</Q> descend gradually to a new mode of re∣ligion. May they retain the exalted courage of that gentleman, but endeavour to improve on his conduct, is the wish of</P>

Now, Sir, if, in your next letter to the Morning Post, you will allow, that a mecha∣nical person, or Grocer's Apprentice, has the same feelings as you, or any of those Gentlemen concern∣ed in the above affray, you will make me still remain, what I already am, an admirer of your conduct.</P>

<P>AS the late altercations between the Rev. Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> and some gentlemen of the laity, at <HI>Vauxhall,</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="63"/>
have prepossessed the Public to know who is the most censurable; I cannot help (as I happened to be a spectator) giving an impartial and candid account so far as I saw and heard, which was as follows, viz.</P>
<P>As Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Hartley,</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> with another gentleman or two were innocently enjoying themselves over a few Vauxhall <HI>slices,</HI> while their auricular faculties were ravish'd with the melodious strains from the orchestra, suddenly a violent <HI>squall</HI> of some descendants of Adam (whose occupations might be in the manufactory of <HI>wigs,</HI> for what I can tell, as I never saw any of them before) overset their tranquillity, and entirely sunk for that night their pleasures to the bottom. The Mariners, however, exerted all their efforts to weather the storm, which I'm afraid they would not have accomplish'd, had not Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> plied his <HI>oar</HI> in so judicious a manner as fairly kept them above water, though he rowed into the very nose of the <HI>squall.</HI> But to be concise,—those gentlemen, the inconsistencies of whose behavi∣our the Rev. Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> so sensibly delineated, in my opinion were highly reprehensible; if some open re∣marks and long impertinent starings to discover the exact symmetry of every feature in Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI>'s face in that situation, are to be deem'd so. One of the Macaroni <HI>Antiloguists,</HI> not quite six feet ten inches high, but uncommonly full of garrulity, with a look that would have intimidated a butterfly, thus ad∣dressed Mr. <HI>Bate;</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Parson Bate! Parson Bate, as you are a soul-driver, it would much redound to my dishonour to box you, and as I believe you wou'd thrash me were you to try, I will not attempt it; but you may be assured I shall procure one, who will wallop you to your heart's content, the first time he meets you.</HI>"</Q> By this request Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> gave them directions where he was to be
<PB N="65" REF="64"/>
found, and as to the result, he has candidly laid it open to the public in this paper before; it would therefore be necessary to quote it again.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I hope every impartial person will acquiesce with me, that the Rev. Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> acted the part of a <HI>man,</HI> by heroically frustrating the de∣signs of those that certainly attempted to break a very material part of the Tenth Commandment.</P>

<P>MR. BATE having this day published a narrative of the affray at Vauxhall, the public therefore have a right to make their remarks on it. I shall observe then, that I don't in the least doubt the veracity of it in any one particular, for these reasons; first, it is attested with his name, and an appeal to the parties concerned; secondly, the signature wears the name of a man who has acted <HI>nobly,</HI> in shewing a nice sense of honour, and a man of nice honour <HI>scorns a lie.</HI> Ha∣ving so far premised, what must we think of the <HI>mili∣tary gentlemen,</HI> in drawing up their <HI>brazen artillery</HI> to attack a <HI>woman,</HI> and <HI>stare</HI> her out of countenance? The answer is plain; that for their <HI>rude behaviour</HI> to our <HI>theatrical Shore,</HI> they are undeserving of the name of Gentlemen, <HI>in poorly daring to insult a woman.</HI> Mr. BATE (like a <HI>Dumont</HI>) protected her, and every man of honour must applaud him for the part he acted. He was ready to give them either <HI>gentleman or ungentle∣manlike satisfaction,</HI> and to shew there was a <HI>poetical</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="65"/>
<HI>justice</HI> in the conclusion of this piece; the person who was himself <HI>no gentleman (the boxing Capt. Miles</HI>) met with <HI>ungentlemanlike satisfaction:</HI> I am only sorry that the servant received the wages which were so properly <HI>due to the master,</HI> and that the master was beat by <HI>proxy.</HI> But there is one point particularly wants clearing up, and the <HI>worthy triumvirate</HI> are <HI>publicly</HI> called upon to answer these questions. Was not Capt. <HI>Miles a coun∣terfeit man of war, and no soldier</HI> (as Brainworm says), or, in plain English, was he not either Mr. <HI>Fitz-Ge∣rall</HI>'s servant, or a person employed to fight for him and the party? Did not Capt. <HI>Crofts</HI> challenge Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> at the coffee-house, to <HI>try his courage,</HI> with an intent, if he was found wanting therein, to <HI>expose him as a coward?</HI> And, lastly, was not the introducing of the supposed <HI>Capt. Miles</HI> at the same time, perempto∣rily insisting, that Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> should fight him first, a scheme planned to <HI>secure a retreat to Capt. Crofts,</HI> if Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> accepted his challenge? Should this be the case, it is making courage, as it were, a game at <HI>Brag,</HI> and the Captain was bragging with <HI>Pam in hand,</HI> for there was a knave secured in his favour, being determined not to <HI>sleep with his forefathers,</HI> but to <HI>sleep in a whole skin.</HI> An answer therefore is necessary, to remove a stigma, which silence on this head will construe in the affirmative.</P>

<P>THE conclusion of <HI>Fitz-Gerall</HI>'s reply having made its appearance in this day's Gazetteer, I will venture to say that it is the weakest defence I ever saw; and had a premium been offered for the most foolish production of the daily papers, the Gazetteer would have carried off the prize <HI>nem. con.</HI> To prove this, what can be more weak and ridiculous than his tale about Mr. <HI>Foote</HI>'s poppets, or more infamous than that a man (pardon the <HI>misnomer</HI>) who bears a com∣mission under the king, should even bribe his foot∣man to do that which he was afraid to do himself; that is, fight Mr. <HI>Bate.</HI> This was not only an affront to that gentleman, by putting his footman on a level with him, but to the army in general, in equipping a man with military vestments, cockade, &amp;c. that was a disgrace to it, and could be equalled in infamy only by his master. But to return to Mr. <HI>Foote</HI>'s poppets:—Though it is well known that Mr. <HI>Foote</HI> does not love fighting himself, I am of opinion he admires that spirit so much in others, he would not even keep a poppet in his pay, that would turn his back on Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall;</HI> whom, for his pusillanimous behaviour in this affair, I shall characterise as a kind of <HI>mandrake</HI> tottering under the mighty load of a cockade, like the poppy percharged with the morning dew.

abuse for the sake of popularity, and has often been about to hang himself, that he never could extort an answer.—Without a blush, he has addressed the Muses too; but they with indignation turned their backs; Apollo refused to beam one ray upon him, and Pegasus would have kicked his brains out for da∣ring to ride, had not Hercules interfered, and snatch∣ed him from despair, advised him to lay down his pen, take up his fist, fix upon the first coward he could meet with, and <HI>that way</HI> fight his way to fame; and <HI>that way</HI> the parson has succeeded. And so, Mr. <HI>Q,</HI> you would advise me to change the title of my farce; but when you know me better, you will find me a man who never takes a fool's advice; I shall give it you under the title I have proposed; <HI>The Vauxhall Fray;</HI> or, <HI>A Peep through the Pocket Hole;</HI> I am about the last scene, and you shall have it forthwith; till when, I am your's,</P>

<P>The same Day these Paragraphs appeared in the same.</P>
<Q>A CORRESPONDENT informs us, that the <HI>Maca∣roni Club</HI> have had a meeting on the piteous situation
<PB N="72" REF="71"/>
of their brother member Mr. Fitz-Gerall, and have unanimously resolved to advise that unfortunate <HI>petit maitre</HI> to appear <HI>only</HI> in petticoats at Vauxhall for the remainder of the season, as the most likely method of escaping the chastisement due for his late unmanly and senseless conduct. The pretty creature (<HI>his snow∣white bosom decorated with the miniature resemblance of his own sweet person,</HI>) may then tread in perfect security the delightful walks of that enchanting spot, in com∣pany with his equally gallant associates, Capt. MILES, Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> &amp;c.</Q>
<Q>A Correspondent thinks it would not be entirely unnecessary to insert the following short sketch, lest those who do not much resort to public places, should be ignorant of the <HI>manly</HI> personage of Mr. Fitz-Gerall. He may be easily distinguished from the rest of the noble <HI>order,</HI> by the following extraordinary piece of <HI>Macaroniship:</HI> Sweet <HI>Fitz</HI> wears two watches!—Sweet <HI>Fitz</HI> has nine seals to each!—Heavens! what could not such a sweet creature perform!</Q>
<P>The Paragraph beneath is taken from the LONDON PACKET of the same evening.</P>
<Q>A CORRESPONDENT says, that Capt. Crofts' let∣ter in yesterday's <HI>Gazetteer,</HI> breathes an air of harsh∣ness which the military are but too apt to assume in the room of candour and gentleman-like civility. When an officer talks or writes to a clergyman, or, in∣deed any man of a civil profession, he should surely aim at a placid, inoffensive style, and forget the haughty language of a young ensign to a corporal in a garrison. To tell a clergyman, that his agreeing to fight a man with a cockade in his hat, was the first instance of his gentleman-like behaviour, is a very gross insult to the dignity of the cloth in general; the clerical gown is
<PB N="73" REF="72"/>
supposed to be of itself an infallible token of the gentility of the person who wears it. The bravado, at the conclusion of the letter, in the words, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I, Sir, am a soldier, and look equally with an eye of contempt at the mischief of a monkey, and the malice of a monk,"</Q> is equally <HI>Bobadilian</HI> and para∣doxical: Does Capt. Crofts mean his friend Fitz-Gerall by the monkey; since the Papers have said he dresses so like one of those animals whose mischievous qualities he seems fully to possess? It is evident that Mr. Bate acts openly, if he acts absurdly; he has nei∣ther the malice of a <HI>Monk,</HI> nor the frigid caution which characterizes that order.</Q>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR behaviour concerning the Vauxhall affray has not only made you more contemptible in the eyes of the public than you really were before, but has likewise shown a meanness in you, which I think im∣possible to be paralleled. You, Mr. Fitz-Gerall, I principally address, as having acted inconsistent both with the character of a soldier and a man of honour. Your behaviour, Sir, was more like that of an assassin than of a gentleman, to come to a person's chambers at the dead of night, armed, and along with a set of ruffians, who, no doubt, if you could have drawn
<PB N="74" REF="73"/>
Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> from his bed with feigned pretences, were to have assisted you in your black purpose.—Your bring∣ing your own footman, in the habit of a military gen∣tleman, and imposing him as such upon Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> under a feigned pretence that he was affronted by Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> at Vauxhall, will <HI>that,</HI> Mr. Fitz-Gerall, (as you express in your letter) bear the uniform stamp of the gentleman, or the man of honour; and, if rightly considered by Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> himself, the real friend?—No, Sir; it will only bear the uniform stamp of a villain; and in no other light can I look on the man who, because he was afraid to vindicate the cause he had unjustly espoused, brought his own footman to undergo the chastisement he himself so justly merited. You, Mr. <HI>Crofts</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> must have been ac∣quainted with the whole; it must have been a con∣certed scheme; for, after you found Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> had spi∣rit enough to give you the satisfaction you required, you meanly, while Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> was engaged in a talk with Mr. <HI>Fitz Gerall</HI> and <HI>his friend</HI> Captain <HI>Miles,</HI> (only fit for each other's company retired to a corner of the room, and proposed making up the affair ami∣cably: how far different this behaviour was to the letter you sent at two o'clock in the morning, I leave the public to the reference of the Morning Post for.—Neither could I, was I Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> have sat down ta∣citly, and not have called you both to account, both being privy to it, although the former affair was ami∣cably cancelled; and how Mr. <HI>Lyttleton</HI> could have the effrontery to ask Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> home to dinner with him, being sensible, as he certainly must, that he had acted to a man of honour with such impropriety, is to me most astonishing.—If Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall,</HI> or any of the Gentlemen concerned, can vindicate themselves against the above charges, I shall be quite happy to find I have been mistaken in their real characters.</P>

<P>YOU, and your reverend adversary have appealed to the Public, as if they were interested in your dis∣putes, or as if a quarrel between two obscure indivi∣duals (of little consequence to society, and not very respectable) was an event of importance to the whole human race.</P>
<P>Such vanity I can easily pardon, but when it is accompanied with an impudent and avowed insult, with a violation of that decency and respect which are due to the military, I hold it deserving of the se∣verest censure; and since you have submitted your conduct to the tribunal of the Public, I shall examine it with great freedom, but not I assure you without candour.</P>
<P>As to the Priest, I shall leave him to contemplate the disgraceful consequences of an impertinent and officious interposition. The husband of the woman (who by the bye appears to have been too squeamish, considering her station in life) <HI>only</HI> was obligated to take cognizance of your rudeness, and in <HI>his</HI> ab∣sence, her two friends who accompanied her to Vaux∣hall, were the properest persons to chastise your in∣solence; but Priests, in all ages, and of every com∣munity, have been distinguished and despised for their officiousness, and the conduct of this Reverend Gen∣tlemen affords me a sufficient reason why I should leave him to his reflections.</P>
<P>Your giving the rank of <HI>Captain</HI> to your livery servant, is the occasion of this letter; and though
<PB N="76" REF="75"/>
you may possibly find an excuse for every other part of your behaviour, I am fully persuaded, Sir, you will not be able to justify the liberty which you have taken with the Gentlemen of the army upon this oc∣casion.</P>
<P>The military will not thank you for reducing them to a level with your domestic, and after declar∣ing that your respect for the Church prevented <HI>your</HI> punishing your adversary, it is somewhat extra∣ordinary that the only instance you give of your re∣spect for religion, was the greatest indignity you could possibly offer to it! This circumstance I pro∣test is rather unlucky. It is a certificate of your country, but neither a proof of your courage nor humanity.</P>
<P>How unfortunate it is, that in almost every trans∣action you prove yourself a native of Hibernia! Let us now, Sir, proceed to particulars.—You became engaged in a riot at Vauxhall, but not principally. The parties who were immediately concerned agreed to meet, and that meeting was at a Coffee-house. While they, attended by their seconds, were settling the dispute, your servant, with an assumed name and rank, demanded satisfaction for a pretended insult, and upon this occasion you acted in your favourite character of a <HI>Mediator,</HI> by assuring the Parson, that Capt. <HI>Miles</HI> was so passionate, that if he was admit∣ted, he might beat him with uncommon fury. I will pass over the indignity offered to the army, and leave the Military to correct your insolence: they are very capable of doing it, and I have no doubt but they will take notice of the favour you have done them. I come now, Sir, to consider you in the character of a Gentleman: When you officiously entered the room at the Coffee-house, to inform Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> that
<PB N="77" REF="76"/>
Capt. <HI>Miles,</HI> whom he had insulted, was below, did it not occur to you, that you was guilty of a pre∣meditated falsehood, at all times unworthy of a Gen∣tleman, and particularly in this instance? And was it from that confusion of ideas so common to your countrymen, that you blended the character of an <HI>Officer</HI> with that of a <HI>Bravo?</HI></P>
<P>Shame upon such baseness! By your letter of to∣day, you speak of Gentlemen that are BORN <HI>to command fleets and armies</HI>—BORN <HI>to command fleets and armies!</HI> Good Heavens!</P>
<P>I presume, Sir, you imagine the ranks of Admiral and General are hereditary, and that the son of either must succeed to the honours of the father, though it is very possible this son might be an arrant Coward, and a consummate Blockhead! The fate of a Nation so unfortunately circumstanced would be as precari∣ous, as if you was at the head of a Fleet or Army.—A misfortune which I trust to God will never happen to us! I have one more remark to make, viz. the impropriety of a drunken man going at one o'clock in the morning to reason with his antagonist, attend∣ed by three more. The late hour, and your different situations amount, Sir, to a presumption, that with this auxiliary aid you meant to accomplish what your servant was on trial found incapable of. To me, your intentions appear to have been hostile; and the difficulty, not to say impossibility of proving yourself a Gentleman, and a man of honour, is manifest in the confusion and perplexity which appear through∣out the whole of a laborious defence, neither plau∣sible nor free from grammatical errors. As to Capt. <HI>Crofts,</HI> was I not assured he had been in the army, I should have concluded by his letter to Mr. <HI>Bate,</HI> that he was the Editor of the Gazette, or that a
<PB N="78" REF="77"/>
Statute of Bankruptcy had lately been issued against him; and if he was in the secret, as you assert he was, of giving the title of Captain to a Bravo, I shall yet doubt the reality of his Military character.</P>
<P>As to Mr. <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> out of respect to his venerable and virtuous father, I shall remain silent; I will not add to the anxiety of an aged and unhappy father, already depressed with grief and sorrow for the Vices of a dissipated Son.</P>

<P>I AM one of that impartial Public who so heartily concur in applauding Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> for the great spirit and propriety with which he has conducted himself towards those insolent Macaronics, who dared to offend him, in the face of the world, in a manner so diametrically opposite to every sentiment of honour and honesty. It is not my present purpose to canvass this matter; the investigation it has already gone through, suffi∣ciently evinces Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> to be really the gentleman, and the man of honour; and that his greatest mis∣fortune has been, having to do with persons so totally devoid of every quality requisite to the constituting either of those characters.—Nothing remains to be said on this subject that can increase Mr. <HI>Bate's</HI> merit, or the infamy and disgrace of his opponents. I defy either his, or any other pen, to add to that universal odium which they have so effectually procured to themselves; and therefore I hope, and doubt not, Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> will treat the letter addressed to him in a paper of this day by Mr. <HI>Croftes,</HI> with that silent con∣tempt so justly due to it.</P>

<P>The Paragraphs following came forth in the MORN∣ING CHRONICLE of <HI>Wednesday, August</HI> 11.</P>
<Q><P>IT is strongly reported, that a friendship, which will probably be of duration, has commenced between a certain foppish Knight, now invested with an office of some consequence to the city of London and county of Middlesex, and the fribbling, parson-fearing Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerall,</HI> founded on a fellow-feeling for each other. The Knight is beyond conception rejoiced that there is in the creation as abject a coward as himself; has therefore communicated to Mr. <HI>F.</HI> his readiness to ac∣company the Rev. Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> to Tyburn in his public character, if the said <HI>B.</HI> should be convicted of maim∣ing and defacing, with an intention to kill, before his shrievalty expires.</P><P><PB N="82" REF="81"/>
Now we see the <HI>denouement</HI> of the petit piece of Vauxhall, (which had like to have turned out a deep Tragedy, if not to the great actress, to the reverend, sensible, and spirited actor under her, and to some of the spectators) we surely cannot be at a loss to de∣termine that the Parson behaved well, as a <HI>bruiser</HI> and defender of the fair, but ill as a <HI>parson</HI> and lecturer of others; as parsons, like coblers, should not go beyond their <HI>last</HI> or text;</P>

<L>For, if Cobler-like, the Parson will fight or get drunk,</L>
<L>Worth makes the man, and want of it the fellow,</L>
<L>The rest is all nothing, but leather and Prunella.</L>

<P>It is therefore hoped this will be a lesson to all parsons to stick to their texts, and not ramble again to public places, not even with gods or goddesses either of the stage, pit, or gallery.</P></Q>

BATE's compliments to the EDITOR, and begs leave, through the channel of the <HI>Morning Post,</HI> to inform the Public, whose patience he is afraid he has already tired in this dispute, that the moment Mess. <HI>Tateham</HI> and <HI>Dawes</HI> come to town, (who were present at the dastardly meeting at the Turk's Head Coffee-house, in which the <HI>Captains</HI> CROFTES and FITS-GERALL cut so capital a figure), their distinct evidence will be given in this Paper, in direct oppo∣sition to those scandalously FALSE, and childish eva∣sions made use of by the contemptible Mr. <HI>Croftes,</HI> in yesterday's <HI>Gazetteer.</HI></P>

<P>{inverted ⁂} <HI>The impatience of the Public has been such, that the publication of this pamphlet could not be retarded, in or∣der to wait for the testimony of the gentlemen mentioned in Mr.</HI> BATE<HI>'s card. However, as we suppose it can only be a confirmation of his own candid narrative, already universally admitted, the omission of it here, we hope, will not be judged of any very material consequence.</HI></P>
