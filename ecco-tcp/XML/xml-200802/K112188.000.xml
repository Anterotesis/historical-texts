<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOu're welcome, dear <HI>Sauney,</HI> from the <HI>Northern</HI> Climate to a more Friendly Air, and this famous Metropolis; where your great and exalted Genius will meet with its merited Reward, and your poetical Abilities shine in their full Splendor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my Soul Man you say too much to an unworthy Brother—I am a Stranger to <HI>England,</HI> but extraordinarily pleas'd with your good Acquaintance, which recompences the Toil of my fatiguing Journey from the City of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Toil, my Friend, you'll think the greatest Pleasure of your Life, when you find by my unequall'd Pen your Character is rais'd to the Top Pinacle of Fame—<HI>Virgil</HI>'s Shade will envy the Reputation I am capable of giving you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> was an Eminent Poet: He's une∣quall'd in this Age, unless it be in you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>You speak like a Man of Judgment, Bro∣ther, and I doubt not to convince the ignorant World, that <HI>Virgil,</HI> amidst his soaring Flights and pompous Elegance, was an Ass to <HI>S—l.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we shall find it a plaguy Task to per∣suade the giddy Multitude to this Opinion: You may seem to resemble the Style and Manner of the Ancients, but I fear the Colours are faint, and will not bear Examination—They are <HI>strong and sublime,</HI> we <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>spiritless.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought you Gentlemen had more of the <HI>Hibernian</HI> Quality than to entertain a mean Opinion of your selves, and your own Capacities: Lay aside Humility, if you intend to thrive in the <HI>English</HI> Territories, and let Conceit, Hy∣pocrisy and Pride take place; be bold and auda∣cious in self-praises; learn to Cabal, flatter, and Condemn, and the Game's your own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>To all these I'm a Stranger, my Dear—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>For what did you desert your Native Country?—Can you expect Services from me, and you entirely unqualified?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>But hold! 'tis not too late to learn—I believe I can despise Merit, and for a conside∣rable Sum be a considerable Flatterer; but the greatest Work is to compliment my self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pugh, that's the easiest Thing in the World; you've Nature on your side, which in∣cites Fondness in all to Works of their own Pro∣duction; I can do it with an Air of Gravity, and damn with a Grace the Misbelievers of an Un∣truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you have the Happiness, Brother, to be Establish'd, and it requires some Time for a Man to be Entered in any thing, altho' it be in Iniquity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every airy Female tells ye her Ware is the best, most charming, the most inviting, and all that—And cannot we extoll our own Verses, many whereof describe those Beauties they falsly pretend to be Mistresses of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Woud'nt it be better that like a fair vir∣tuous Woman, we make no Boastings of our selves, but let our own real Worth recommend us to Mankind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no such thing as real Worth, my Friend, 'tis all imaginary: The whole Universe is a sham, and false Representation—Generals are not always made with Fighting, Scholars by Learning, nor Divines by Study: No, Manage∣ment and Caballing will save infinite Trouble of that kind—'Tis but to place proper Fame-brokers at the most remarkable Parts of the Town, Fellows of good Lungs to bellow out your Praise, the Work is done; the ignorant Populace, fam'd for Credulity, will believe it with as much Eager∣ness as they entertain Scandal against true Merit; and thus is a Reputation at once acquired.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this seems, according to my Notion of Things, to be inconsistent with true Sense, and 'tis contrary to all Scottish Politicks; we are equally backward in Praising as in Condemning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sense, Sir, is nothing else but a Rule of acting on the Principle of Interest; so that if it promotes my Profit, I'll applaud my self, or any senseless Wretch; and if my Fortune cannot be raised without calumniating what is truly Great and Glorious, the doing it is an Argument of sound Sense, and perfectly consonant with the Di∣ctates of Nature, and the great <HI>SENECA</HI>'s Philosophy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot be of your Opinion, Brother, I must term that <HI>Abuse,</HI> which you are pleas'd to call Sense, in Spite of the greatest Oratory to recommend it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must learn to think more advanta∣giously, if you expect Prosperity here—But that I may not be tedious in my first Lectures, we'll quit this Conversation, and retire to a House of Diversion in the Hundreds of <HI>Drury;</HI> we'll drink 'till we rival the Sun with our ruddy Com∣plexions; set up all Night with the Moon; lye with half a Dozen Virgins; break all the Win∣dows of the Mansion; and then, like true Sons of <HI>Parnassus,</HI> make a hasty Escape, and pay no Reckoning, but leave that to be accounted for by the Gods.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will not the Substitutes of <HI>Venus</HI> exhaust our Poetical Fire?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, they'll encrease it.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>But have ye no Salamanders—I fear I shall be metamorphiz'd to a Glow-worm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>None at all, my Dear—I'll help ye to an agreeable Female with whom Safety will be your Lot.</P>
</SP>

<P>The Deel damn me, if I don't think the Lot of <HI>Jonas</HI> will be mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll be in no Belly of a Whale, I'll assure ye.</P>

<P>Have I found my Enemy at last.— <STAGE>(<HI>To Goosecap</HI>)—</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm an Enemy to nothing, but that Merit which is of a superiour kind, Sir.—Dear <HI>Sauney,</HI> repair to <HI>Button</HI>'s; I'll be with you pre∣sently. <STAGE>(<HI>To</HI> Sauny.)</STAGE></P>
<STAGE><HI>Exit</HI> Sauny.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you any Pretence, Sir, to Merit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>As much as you have to be a <HI>Coxcomb,</HI> Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smart.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Coxcomb does not belong to me at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can write <HI>Sense</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> a Capacity you are unacquainted with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smart.</SPEAKER>
<P>In your Walk to St. <HI>J—</HI>'s-<HI>street,</HI> there is neither English, Sense, nor Grammar; and your best Pieces of Poetry are but Trifles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be an Honour to you, Sir, to be the Author of such Trifles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smart.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can receive no Honour from your Ac∣complishments.—You have by good Fortune indeed wrote one Piece that has sold, but more from the Popularity of the Subject, than the Per∣formance;
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
your best Scenes of Love are notoriously worse than those of the lowest Poet in this or any other Age.—The few Similies are no way adapted, and really appear like Flowers in a Dung∣hill.—In your other Poetical Writings all the Beauties are borrow'd: If we divest you of your Thefts, you'll resemble the Crow in the Fable, and little will remain but Froth and Rhime.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou foolish Boy, do'st Thee pretend to criticise on the Greatest Genius of the Age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smart.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may compliment your Genius as you please, and your Friends may give it out, but I shall take Liberty to affirm that 'tis far from being a perfect one in Poetry: A perfect Genius is capable of producing a finish'd Piece of the greatest Length, which is what you will never be Master of.—A few good Lines I confess you sometimes happen to write, but more from a <HI>Flashy Wit,</HI> than a true <HI>Native Genius.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Genius is eminently conspicuous in every thing I do—Can you peruse any Per∣formance of mine, where I don't strike out with a surprizing Strength of Poetical Fury?—And in my Odes, my Flights are very Extraordi∣nary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Flights are like those of the Owl, never Soaring or Lofty. If you intend to gain a solid Reputation, you must <HI>strike out</HI> the great∣est part of what you have written: Leave off re∣commending the Works of others, in order to assume the Honour of the Whole yourself, and
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
blaming that which you cannot mend, for no o∣ther Reason than because you've had no Hand in't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why all this unmerited Calumny?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Talent is Calumny, Brother, tho' preposterously mix'd with Panegyrick.—You can condemn and praise even the same thing, and at such times as it merits neither your Censure, nor Approbation.—You can lam∣poon your best Friends, and abuse your greatest Benefactors, in their Absence; and, supported by a Gamester, you think to Bully Mankind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is provoking with a Vengeance; wou'd any one but a Poet bear all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smart.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are born to bear the Burthen of your Folly, and the Repetition of your Faults.—A first RateMinister of State was first your Patron; him you've commended to Excess; since you've let fly at him at least twenty Satyrs. On a great Statesman whom you've lately prais'd, first a Sa∣tyr, then a Panegyrick: On a certain Noble Lord first a Panegyrick, then a Lampoon: A great Com∣moner, first a Satyr, then a Compliment; and ma∣ny other Instances of this kind I could enumerate: And as Hypocrisy is your Principle, the Whigs have your present Praises, but the Tories and Jacobites your Affections.</P>
