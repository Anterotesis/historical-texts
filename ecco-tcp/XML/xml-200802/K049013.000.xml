<P>JOANNA OF MONTFAUCON; A DRAMATIC ROMANCE OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY: AS PERFORMED AT THE Theatre-Royal, Covent-Garden. FORMED UPON THE PLAN OF THE GERMAN DRAMA OF KOTZEBUE: AND ADAPTED TO THE ENGLISH STAGE BY RICHARD CUMBERLAND.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE German original of this Play, which its Author stiles 'a Dramatic Romance of the fourteenth century,' has not, I believe, as yet been published. It never came under my inspection; and, if it had, I could have made no use of it, not understanding a syllable of the language.</P>
<P>The model, upon which I worked was an English translation, that professed nothing more than fidelity to the words of the author, and this I have no doubt it correctly perform∣ed. In this copy I discovered the frame-work of what might be made a splendid spectacle; and the known liberality of those, in whom the property and conduct of the Theatre are
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
vested, has more than equalled every expecta∣tion I could ground upon their support. What else I discovered, except as above stated, it may not become me to say, for I have no right to pronounce upon an author, who composes in a language unknown to me; but certain it is, I stand responsible to the Public for every sen∣tence in this Drama now before them, with the exception of a very few periods indeed, and those of no great importance. Let Kot∣zebue therefore answer for no more than be∣longs to him—the plot and fabric of <HI>JOANNA.</HI> Whether I have marred it or mended it in the execution, can only be decided when the Public shall be in possession of the means for comparing them.</P>
<P>It has so rarely been my habit to write upon any plot but of my own fabrication and invention, that what I assert in the Prologue is most strictly true; viz.</P>
<Q><L>"All, who cou'd judge my labour, wou'd confess</L>
<L>"Originality had made it less."</L></Q>
<P>Whether from inaptitude for the task, or from whatever other cause my embarrassments have
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
proceeded, such they have been, and so many times have I woven and unwoven this Pe∣nelope's web, that if plays were only to be appreciated by the pains they cost in composing, this of mine would have a merit, which I suspect the world will not be in the humour to attach to it. Then indeed I should have one fair exception to set against the many in∣stances of precipitation, of which I stand ac∣cused, but of which I cannot be duly convicted, till it is known of how many hours my day consists, and what portion of those I devote to my studies.</P>
<P>I have heard several authors instance a dispatch in composition, of which I have no conception; but, with respect to the drama now submitted, whether I did or did not write it, <HI>stans pede in uno,</HI> I can only assure the Public, I will never stand upon German legs any more, but take my chance with my countrymen for so much of their favour as my own independant efforts can obtain for me.</P>
<P>I have now been so often before the Reader, that I must claim the privilege of addressing him as a friend, whom I am not to flatter,
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
and in whose company I am not to degrade myself by an unmanly stile of supplication, as∣sumed for no other purpose than to invoke his candour; the which, if he has not, false dif∣fidence will not create, and, if he has, plain speaking will not offend. I therefore shall not scruple to say (speaking under the sanc∣tion of age and long experience) that the diction of Joanna is not inferior to that of any of my most favoured plays. I know I have outlived the time, when a simple and consistent fable, developed in correct and classic diction, presenting characters to be found in nature, and producing incidents not irrecon∣cileable to probability, can no longer attract: I also perceive I have lived to see the time, when not content with the eccentricities of our own stage, we have gone to that of the Ger∣mans for fresh supplies of what we were over∣stocked with—false writing and false moral. It is too often that the success or failure of a play depends upon the <HI>cast,</HI> not upon the com∣position; of course the play is written more for the actors behind the curtain, than for the audience before it: this makes Tragedy run
<PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
riot, and Comedy play the antick. We have actors, who possess such irresistible power over the risibility of the spectator, that our writers for the stage find their account in availing themselves of those powers, and produce a spe∣cies of composition, which, departing from the character of the legitimate drama, may be said to border very nearly upon farce and mum∣mery.</P>
<P>Where fashion points, the stage will follow. If, endeavouring to write according to nature and good models, the dramatic author finds himself deserted by the Town, who but will be weary of the attempt? If the public taste is vitiated, the remedy is not with him: the critic may take up the cause; a good <HI>dramatic censor</HI> may do much, but a scurrilous one can effect nothing. Are authors only to be lashed, and their misleaders to be passed over uncor∣rected? The enlarged expences of our royal theatres do not warrant their proprietors in opposing themselves to the public taste—how then should authors undertake it?</P>
<P>As I have been uniformly adverse in my opinion to the introduction of these German
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
dramas on the English stage, it may well be supposed my reasons for undertaking to adapt this of Joanna were strong ones, and in yield∣ing to them, I have only to regret, that my endeavours have not been more serviceable to the interests of a theatre, to which I have every obligation, not only for the fair and honourable treatment I experienced from the proprietors, but also for the warm and cordial support I received from the performers. <HI>Mr. Incledon</HI> in particular has a claim to my best acknowledgments for his very honour∣able and zealous perseverance in his duty, under circumstances of such an afflicting nature, as might have fully justified him for declining it.</P>
<P>In the copy now printed, I have not alto∣gether adhered to the Prompter's book, as it was altered after the first night's representa∣tion. The Reader will observe I have re∣tained the incident of Lazarra's falling by the hand of Joanna; this I have done, because I see no particular reason for departing so entirely from the author's first conception, though good reason obtained, in point of action, for the altera∣tion
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
that was made on the second night. On the German stage, Albert, in the combat with his rival, stumbles over the root of a tree, and falls to the ground; in this instant Joanna rushes in accoutred in the complete armour of a warlike knight, and with a huge sword of two-handed sway dispatches Lazarra at a stroke. Albert, thus critically rescued, rises and requests the unknown Knight to put up his visor, when to his astonishment he dis∣covers his preserver in the person of his wife. How they may manage these matters on the German stage I cannot pretend to say; perhaps their actors may be better duellists, and their actresses more adroit in warlike operations than ours; but if we found diffi∣culty in the action, simplified as it is, how much more should we have been embarrassed in point of execution, had we undertaken to perform it in the spirit of the original?</P>
<P>In the concluding scene of the third act, Wensel in the original gets drunk upon the stage, and the keys are taken out of his cham∣ber by Philip, whilst his intoxicated father
<PB N="x" REF="10"/>
lies buried in profound sleep. If what I substituted in place of this incident is not so near to nature as the original, it is certainly less offensive to decorum, and better suited to the manners of our English stage. When I am speaking of this scene (unquestionably the most prominent in the play) I cannot pass it over without acknowledging my obligations to the young and rising actor, whose energetic and impressive execution in the character of Philip gave such brilliancy to the represen∣tation, and displayed powers, which, when drawn forth by abler authors, and better opportunities, cannot fail to place him in the very highest rank of his profession.</P>
<P>The Joanna of Kotzebue is kept out of sight during the whole time that Lazarra is in possession of her castle, and of course is never before the audience but in the opening and conclusion of the play. It appeared to me expedient to fill up this <HI>hiatus,</HI> and of course her scenes in the middle acts are supple∣mentary.</P>
<P>In like manner, Wolf in the original is
<PB N="xi" REF="11"/>
merely the shadow of a character. The sup∣port of such an actor as <HI>Mr. Munden,</HI> is an object which every author will reach at with avidity. I sincerely thank him for his cordial assistance; I wish my efforts had been more proportionate to his merit. To the performers, who condescended to appear in characters, neither adequate to their merits, nor consonant with their feelings, I have more to offer than acknowledgments; I must beg them to accept my apology.</P>
<P>As there is no music in the original, I must in justice exonerate the author from all respon∣sibility on the score of the discarded Page. When his singing ceased, his services were no longer wanted; two songs were composed for this character, though but one was perform∣ed; these exquisite melodies will, I hope, be published by the composer; and that I may not appear to keep that out of sight, which will do him so much honour to produce, I retain those songs in my copy, and of course the whole part of Eugene.</P>
<P>The overture, chorusses, and songs, inci∣dental
<PB N="xii" REF="12"/>
to the piece, with four symphonies be∣tween the acts, were all composed for the oc∣casion by <HI>Mr. Thomas Busby:</HI> He also, in the run of the piece, substituted a new Quin∣tetto instead of the Peasant's chorus in the opening scene, and at the same time withdrew the finale of Joy, Joy, Joy! and introduced upon the ninth night a shorter and most bril∣liant chorus to the following words:
<Q><L>"Hail, glorious day! Death strikes our impious foe,</L>
<L>"And Victory binds her wreath on Virtue's brow."</L></Q></P>
<P>It is matter of the highest satisfaction to me to find that the Public have done justice to his eminent abilities. I sincerely hope this his first essay in the dramatic line will encou∣rage him to employ his talents upon a larger and more splendid scale. Where genius so sublime is combined with science so profound, what is there within the province of his studies, which the world may not expect from <HI>Mr. Busby?</HI></P>
<P>As the opposition, which was given to this play upon the first evening only of its per∣formance, has passed over me without injury, I should have passed over it without a re∣mark,
<PB N="xiii" REF="13"/>
but that I am given to understand an opinion was in circulation, that I had vanity enough to conceive I had prepared a spec∣tacle, and composed a drama to rival, nay to eclipse, one that was triumphantly established on the sister stage. As an author, I have never appealed from the decisions of the theatre: conscious that nothing can be more perfectly at the mercy of the Public than an author's reputation, when he has committed it to the stage, I have never offered a single word in arrest of judgment, however rigo∣rous, nor persisted to obtrude myself, when I had once discovered I was no longer welcome. That we had no reason to yield the play up upon the partial clamour of the first night, the event of the second clearly evinced; not a murmur was heard, and the applause was ge∣neral. If I had been the arrogant man, which it is presumed I was thought to be by some of my opponents, their resentment would have fallen so much more heavily upon the li∣beral proprietors of the theatre, than upon me individually, that there would have been infinitely more cruelty than justice in their
<PB N="xiv" REF="14"/>
revenge. But the task of adapting this Ger∣man Drama to our stage was no work of my seeking, and though I expended more pains upon it than I ever did upon any play in my life, the hopes I formed of its success were chiefly grounded on the brilliancy of the spec∣tacle, and the excellence of the music: As for Pizarro, I envy not his success; I do not as∣pire to rival it, I cannot wish to lessen it; and if any man doubts my sincerity, let him put himself in the predicament of an author, for years held off from receiving the fair and moderate earnings of his productive services; and looking to that very fund for indemnifica∣tion, then let him ask his conscience what he would say to such an idle imputation, and his answer shall be mine.</P>

<L>THE Scenes that soon will open to your view,</L>
<L>In their first sketch a foreign author drew;</L>
<L>If merely tracing his inventive thought</L>
<L>We set translation's servile task at nought,</L>
<L>All who can judge our labour, must confess</L>
<L>Originality had made it less.</L>
<L>Our Dramatists you know, in every age,</L>
<L>Have copied from the French and Spanish stage:</L>
<L>We have done less—for save in plot alone,</L>
<L>The work from top to bottom is our own.</L>
<L>[<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These four lines between brackets were not spoken.</NOTE> "Still, if you think the British stage disgrac'd,</L>

<L>If thus tow'rds you in conscience we are clear▪</L>
<L>There's nothing from our foreign friend to fear;</L>
<L>We've given him all our care—with music's aid,</L>

<L>This character, as fearing to advance</L>
<L>Fiction too bold, he paints as a Romance;</L>
<L>We, under no such terrors, vouch it true,</L>
<L>And for its living model point to you:</L>
<L>Asserting, you in grace and goodness show</L>
<L>All that was lovely centuries ago;</L>
<L>Conscious tho' Wives of old were more demure,</L>
<L>Your eyes may sparkle, and your hearts be pure.</L>
<L>Here we conclude, for Music now prepares</L>
<L>Her better prologue to more moving airs—</L>

<P>What is another's right?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ev'n all you see.—This castle, at whose gate you feed the poor; this rich domain, was ravish'd from its owner, the banish'd Lord of Thurn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOANNA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not by my Albert.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.—Would to heaven my father had been clear from that reproach as I am! But alas! it was a guilty business, my Joanna; and tho' in candour I'm not bound to blazon my father's shame, in honour I am bound to render justice to the Lord of Thurn.</P>

<SPEAKER>JOANNA.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Lord of Thurn is dead.—He had no son.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>ALBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>He had a daughter; and, if she survives, she is the rightful heiress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOANNA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, where is she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is not known. Her father was attack'd and slain by robbers. This daughter, then an infant, was with him; and whether she was carried off alive, or shar'd her father's fate, remains in doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOANNA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then do we hold this castle but in trust till that doubt is resolv'd. Let her be found.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is Joanna then content to lose what she employs so worthily?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOANNA.</SPEAKER>
<P>To lose?—How is that lost which we've no right to keep?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but reflect, that when this castle's gone, my family estate is all that's left me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOANNA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that all?—No; you have a faithful wife, a lovely hopeful child, a mind at peace, and the pure bliss which unstain'd honour gives—enjoyments, Albert, which who hath, is rich in his proud po∣verty; and who hath not, is beggar'd by his riches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Glorious woman, come to my arms! This treasure is my own: Nothing but death can rob me of this wealth.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>JOANNA.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will have treasure where death cannot reach it. When conscious rectitude hath chac'd the cloud that wrinkles on your brow, and with a smile you enter the small cot where I will meet you, cherubs of health and peace shall deck the chamber of our repose with furniture more rich than kings can purchase; the low roof shall mount above the pitch of palaces and towers; and when I walk beside thee, what imports it if leagues or inches limit our possessions? Thou art my property, thy love my treasure, thy cou∣rage my strong castle and defence: One robe adorns me, thy untainted honour; one costly jewel, my beloved child.</P>

<P>So cannot I your most unbounded goodness.
<PB N="10" REF="26"/>
For life alone I am my father's debtor; for virtue, your's. You taught me how to prize it, and your example train'd me in the practice.

<P>Sir, take which side you will of a convicted thief, and you shall find him still an arrant knave; for here's the case—this fellow lurks about, and hides in the thick woods; why does he so? Why but because the gallows stands in sight, and 'tis a pretty eye-trap he has no taste for, being a two-leg'd building without floors, the which who takes possession of is left to dangle and cut capers in the air.—I pray you, Sir, give him a lease for life of that same airy tenement; that sky-parlour.</P>

<P>For shame! must your abuse sweep all his kindred?—What has Guntram done to deserve this of you?</P>

<P>Come, no more of this!</P>

<P>Nay, Sir, I have not half run out his roll. Guntram's a traitor, harbours rogues and runa∣gates, javelin companions in Lazarra's pay, who carry within their shields wicked designs against your castle's peace.</P>

Now you shall hear me speak as softly to her as the zephyr blows: Child, this is Darbony, a wealthy knight; a gentleman of Florence: one whose sword has carv'd him out a fortune by the wars, that well may warrant him to say, to any the best and proudest spinster in the land—"Come Yorth, and be my bride!"</P>

<P>Softly, friend Guntram! there you go too fast. You are old and harsh; your daughter's young and gentle.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GUNTRAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, tell her so! You are a notable lover; and she 'll tell you she is too young to marry you. She'd not say that to me, if I propos'd Philip of Belmont, neighbour Wensel's son: not she, not she; she'd jump into his arms.—But she shall know these shuffling pleas won't pass: she's your's this very night.—Hav'nt I said the word?</P>

<P>The monster will not let me see my child— Well! Heaven's high will be done—There was a time when my afflicted spirit was prepar'd to die with Albert! But last night in silence I com∣mun'd with my heart, and heard a voice that seem'd to cry within me—
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hold thine hand, creature of God! thy life is not thine own, and none but he that gave can take away"</Q>— I started; left my couch; my lamp was burning; the book of life was open on my table; I read; the text was—patience—and the word of in∣spiration sunk into my heart with influence so persuasive, so serene, that as I read, I reasoned, and perceived when Heaven is pleased to punish,

<P>Is there not something stirring in the castle that occupies my tyrant, and reprieves me from his detested presence?</P>

<SPEAKER>EUGENE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think there is—Scouts are for ever passing, that scour the country round; the walls are manned; in all the watch towers centinels are posted, and by what is going forward, I should suppose he looks to be attack'd.</P>

<P>Boy, you're deceived; let me not hear of hope, save what the cheering recollection gives, that all the sufferings of this transient life must have a speedy end: of this assur'd, I am prepar'd, for conscience sake, to brave all that Lazarra's fury can inflict to shake my honour, or subdue my spirit; for 'tis no question with me whom to fear—him, a contemptible and short-liv'd ty∣rant, that only can afflict me for awhile, or that tremendous judge whose just award is happiness or misery without end.</P>
