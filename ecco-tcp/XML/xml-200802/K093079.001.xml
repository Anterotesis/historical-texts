<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN an age like the present, wherein literary merit of every kind so much abounds, and is at the same time so much encouraged; many poetical performances which deserve a longer remembrance than fugitive pieces usually meet with, are daily thrown upon the public, and left to perish in oblivion. To select these from the trifling productions of the day, has ever been considered as an useful employment: and the fa∣vourable reception which Mr. DODSLEY's ele∣gant Collection of Poems obtained from the public, is sufficient to encourage any person who has the means in his power to continue that deservedly esteemed Miscellany. Several at∣tempts of this sort have been made, but none have acquired so much reputation as to render the present undertaking useless or unnecessary.
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
Twelve years are now elapsed since the last volumes of that work were published, in which time it is not to be supposed that there has been so great a dearth of genius, but that many pieces have made their appearance which are not infe∣rior to the best preserved in that Miscellany. Of the truth of this observation, the Editor ap∣peals to the following Collection, which is com∣piled from the best productions published within that time, which Mr. DODSLEY had not the opportunity of seeing, with the addition of many other pieces, which with all his diligence were overlooked by him. With what degree of judgment this Collection is made, the Editor submits to the determination of the public; the greater part of the poetical pieces of the last thirty years have passed through his hands, and as of them the following Volumes are composed, he hopes they will not be considered as in im∣proper Supplement to the work of which they are designed as a Continuation. He flatters him∣self that he has not suffered private friendship to obtrude any piece into this Collection, which is unworthy of the rest, and great care has been
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
taken to prevent the insertion of any performance which has not been approved by gentlemen of distinguished reputation; but as he is sensible that the taste of persons is very different, he ex∣pects not after all that every piece will meet with equal applause, being convinced of the truth of Mr. DODSLEY's observation, <Q REND="inline">"That it is impossible to furnish out an entertainment of this nature, where every part shall be re∣lished by every guest."</Q></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Abelard and Eloisa flourished in the twelfth century; they were two of the most distinguished persons of their age in learning and beauty, but for nothing more famous than for their unfortunate passion. After a long course of calamities they retired each to a several convent, and consecrated the remainder of their days to religion. It was many years after this separation, that a letter of Abelard to a friend, which contained the history of his misfortunes, fell into the hands of Eloisa: this occasioned those celebrated letters (out of which the following is partly extract∣ed) which give so lively a picture of the struggles of grace and nature, virtue and passion.</P>

<HEAD>ABELARD TO ELOISA.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. CAWTHORNE, MASTER OF TUNBRIDGE-SCHOOL.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>AH, why this boding start? this sudden pain,</L>
<L>That wings my pulse, and shoots from vein to vein?</L>
<L>What mean, regardless of yon midnight bell,</L>
<L>These earth-born visions saddening o'er my cell?</L>
<L>What strange disorder prompts these thoughts to glow?</L>
<L>These sighs to murmur, and these tears to flow?</L>
<L>'Tis she, 'tis Eloisa's form restor'd,</L>
<L>Once a pure saint, and more than saints ador'd:</L>
<L>She comes in all her killing charms confest,</L>
<L>Glares thro' the gloom, and pours upon my breast,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="8"/>
Bids heav'n's bright guard from Paraclete remove,</L>
<L>And drags me back to misery and love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Enjoy thy triumphs, dear illusion! see</L>
<L>This sad apostate from his God to thee;</L>
<L>See, at thy call, my guilty warmths return,</L>
<L>Flame thro' my blood, and steal me from my urn.</L>
<L>Yet, yet, frail Abelard! one effort try,</L>
<L>Ere the last lingering spark of virtue die;</L>
<L>The deadly charming sorceress controul,</L>
<L>And spite of nature tear her from thy soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long has that soul in these unsocial woods,</L>
<L>Where anguish muses, and where horror broods,</L>
<L>From love's wild visionary wishes stray'd,</L>
<L>And sought to lose thy beauties in the shade,</L>
<L>Faith dropt a smile, devotion lent her fire,</L>
<L>Woke the keen pang, and sanctify'd desire;</L>
<L>Led me enraptur'd to the blest abode,</L>
<L>And taught my heart to glow with all its God.</L>
<L>But oh, how weak fair faith and virtue prove!</L>
<L>When Eloisa melts away in love!</L>
<L>When her fond soul impassion'd, rapt, unveil'd,</L>
<L>No joy forgotten, and no wish conceal'd,</L>
<L>Flows thro' her pen as infant softness free,</L>
<L>And fiercely springs in ecstasies to me.</L>
<L>Ye heavens! as walking in yon sacred fane</L>
<L>With every seraph warm in every vein,</L>
<L>Just as remorse had rous'd an aking sigh,</L>
<L>And my torn soul hung trembling in my eye,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="9"/>
In that kind hour thy fatal letter came,</L>
<L>I saw, I gaz'd, I shiver'd at the name;</L>
<L>The conscious lamps at once forgot to shine,</L>
<L>Prophetic tremors shook the hallow'd shrine;</L>
<L>Priests, censors, altars from thy genius fled,</L>
<L>And heaven itself shut on me while I read.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dear smiling mischief! art thou still the same,</L>
<L>The still pale victim of too soft a flame?</L>
<L>Warm, as when first with more than mortal shine</L>
<L>Each melting eye-ball mix'd thy soul with mine?</L>
<L>Have not thy tears for ever taught to flow,</L>
<L>The glooms of absence, and the pangs of woe,</L>
<L>The pomp of sacrifice, the whisper'd tale,</L>
<L>The dreadful vow yet hovering o'er thy veil,</L>
<L>Drove this bewitching fondness from thy breast?</L>
<L>Curb'd the loose wish, and form'd each pulse to rest?</L>
<L>And canst thou still, still bend the suppliant knee</L>
<L>To love's dread shrine, and weep and sigh for me?</L>
<L>Then take me, take me, lock me in thy arms,</L>
<L>Spring to my lips, and give me all thy charms:</L>
<L>No, fly me, fly me, spread th' impatient sail,</L>
<L>Steal the lark's wing, and mount the swiftest gale;</L>
<L>Skim the last ocean, freeze beneath the pole;</L>
<L>Renounce me, curse me, root me from thy soul;</L>
<L>Fly, fly, for justice bares the arm of God,</L>
<L>And the grasp'd vengeance only waits his nod.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Are these my wishes? can they thus aspire?</L>
<L>Does phrenzy form them, or does grace inspire?</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="10"/>
Can Abelard, in hurricanes of zeal,</L>
<L>Betray his heart, and teach thee not to feel?</L>
<L>Teach thy enamour'd spirit to disown</L>
<L>Each human warmth, and chill thee into stone?</L>
<L>Ah, rather let my tenderest accents move</L>
<L>The last wild tumults of unholy love!</L>
<L>On that dear bosom trembling let me lie,</L>
<L>Pour out my soul, and in fierce raptures die,</L>
<L>Rouze all my passions, act my joys anew,</L>
<L>Farewell, ye cells! ye martyr'd saints! adieu:</L>
<L>Sleep, conscience, sleep! each awful thought be drown'd,</L>
<L>And seven-fold darkness veil the scene around.</L>
<L>What means this pause, this agonizing start?</L>
<L>This glimpse of heaven quick-rushing thro' my heart?</L>
<L>Methinks I see a radiant cross display'd,</L>
<L>A wounded Saviour bl eds along the shade;</L>
<L>Around th' expiring God bright angels fly,</L>
<L>Swell the loud hymn, and open all the sky:</L>
<L>O save me, save me, ere the thunders roll,</L>
<L>And hell's black caverns swallow up my soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Return, ye hours! when guiltless of a stain,</L>
<L>My strong-plum'd genius throbb'd in every vein,</L>
<L>When warm'd with all th' Aegyptian fanes inspir'd,</L>
<L>All Athens boasted, and all Rome admir'd;</L>
<L>My merit in its full meridian shone,</L>
<L>Each rival blushing, and each heart my own.</L>
<L>Return, ye scenes! ah no, from fancy fly,</L>
<L>On time's stretch'd wing, till each idea die,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="11"/>
Eternal fly, since all that learning gave</L>
<L>Too weak to conquer, and too fond to save,</L>
<L>To love's soft empire every wish betray'd,</L>
<L>And left my laurels withering in the shade.</L>
<L>Let me forget, that while deceitful fame</L>
<L>Grasp'd her shrill trump, and fill'd it with my name,</L>
<L>Thy stronger charms, impower'd by heav'n to move</L>
<L>Each saint, each blest insensible to love,</L>
<L>At once my soul from bright ambition won,</L>
<L>I hugg'd the dart, I wish'd to be undone;</L>
<L>No more pale science durst my thoughts engage,</L>
<L>Insipid dulness hung on every page;</L>
<L>The midnight lamp no more enjoy'd its blaze,</L>
<L>No more my spirit flew from maze to maze:</L>
<L>Thy glances bade philosophy resign</L>
<L>Her throne to thee, and every sense was thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But what could all the frosts of wisdom do,</L>
<L>Oppos'd to beauty, when it melts in you?</L>
<L>Since these dark, cheerless, solitary caves,</L>
<L>Death-breathing woods, and daily-opening graves,</L>
<L>Mis-shapen rocks, wild images of woe,</L>
<L>For ever howling to the deeps below;</L>
<L>Ungenial desarts, where no vernal shower</L>
<L>Wakes the green herb, or paints th' unfolding flower;</L>
<L>Th' imbrowning glooms these holy mansions shed,</L>
<L>The night-born horrors brooding o'er my bed,</L>
<L>The dismal scenes black melancholy pours</L>
<L>O'er the sad visions of enanguish'd hours;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="12"/>
Lean abstinence, wan grief, low-thoughted care,</L>
<L>Distracting guilt, and hell's worst fiend, despair,</L>
<L>Conspire, in vain, with all the aids of art,</L>
<L>To blot thy dear idea from my heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Delusive, sightless god of warm desire!</L>
<L>Why would'st thou wish to set a wretch on fire?</L>
<L>Why lives thy soft divinity where woe</L>
<L>Heaves the pale sigh, and anguish loves to glow?</L>
<L>Fly to the mead, the daisy-painted vale,</L>
<L>Breathe in its sweets, and melt along the gale;</L>
<L>Fly where gay scenes luxurious youths employ,</L>
<L>Where every moment steals the wing of joy;</L>
<L>There may'st thou see, low prostrate at thy throne,</L>
<L>Devoted slaves and victims all thy own:</L>
<L>Each village-swain the turf-built shrine shall raise,</L>
<L>And kings command whole hecatombs to blaze.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O memory! ingenious to revive</L>
<L>Each fleeting hour, and teach the past to live,</L>
<L>Witness what conflicts this frail bosom tore!</L>
<L>What griefs I suffer'd! and what pangs I bore!</L>
<L>How long I struggled, labour'd, strove to save</L>
<L>An heart that panted to be still a slave!</L>
<L>When youth, warmth, rapture, spirit, love, and flame,</L>
<L>Seiz'd every sense, and burnt thro' all my frame;</L>
<L>From youth, warmth, rapture, to these wilds I fled,</L>
<L>My food the herbage, and the rock my bed.</L>
<L>There, while these venerable cloisters rise</L>
<L>O'er the bleak surge, and gain upon the skies,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="13"/>
My wounded soul indulg'd the tear to flow</L>
<L>O'er all her sad vicissitudes of woe;</L>
<L>Profuse of life, and yet afraid to die,</L>
<L>Guilt in my heart, and horror in my eye,</L>
<L>With ceaseless prayers, the whole artillery given</L>
<L>To win the mercies of offended heaven,</L>
<L>Each hill, made vocal, eccho'd all around,</L>
<L>While my torn breast knock'd bleeding on the ground.</L>
<L>Yet, yet, alas! tho' all my moments fly</L>
<L>Stain'd by a tear, and darken'd in a sigh;</L>
<L>Tho' meagre fasts have on my cheek display'd</L>
<L>The dusk of death, and sunk me to a shade,</L>
<L>Spite of myself the still-impoisoning dart</L>
<L>Shoots thro' my blood, and drinks up all my heart;</L>
<L>My vows and wishes wildly disagree,</L>
<L>And grace itself mistakes my God for thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Athwart the glooms, that wrap the midnight sky,</L>
<L>My Eloisa steals upon my eye;</L>
<L>For ever rises in the solar ray,</L>
<L>A phantom brighter than the blaze of day:</L>
<L>Where-e'er I go, the visionary guest</L>
<L>Pants on my lip, or sinks upon my breast;</L>
<L>Unfolds her sweets, and, throbbing to destroy,</L>
<L>Winds round my heart in luxury of joy;</L>
<L>While loud hosannas shake the shrines around,</L>
<L>I hear her softer accents in the sound;</L>
<L>Her idol-beauties on each altar glare,</L>
<L>And heaven much-injur'd has but half my prayer:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="14"/>
No tears can drive her hence, no pangs controul,</L>
<L>For every object brings her to my soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Last night, reclining on yon airy steep,</L>
<L>My busy eyes hung brooding o'er the deep;</L>
<L>The breathless whirlwinds slept in every cave,</L>
<L>And the soft moon-beam danc'd from wave to wave;</L>
<L>Each former bliss in this bright mirror seen,</L>
<L>With all my glories, dawn'd upon the scene,</L>
<L>Recall'd the dear auspicious hour anew,</L>
<L>When my fond soul to Eloisa flew:</L>
<L>When, with keen speechless ecstasies opprest,</L>
<L>Thy frantic lover snatch'd thee to his breast,</L>
<L>Gaz'd on thy blushes arm'd with every grace,</L>
<L>And saw the goddess beaming in thy face;</L>
<L>Saw thy wild, trembling, ardent wishes move</L>
<L>Each pulse to rapture, and each glance to love.</L>
<L>But lo! the winds descend, the billows roar,</L>
<L>Foam to the clouds, and burst upon the shore,</L>
<L>Vast peals of thunder o'er the ocean roll,</L>
<L>The flame-wing'd lightning gleams from pole to pole.</L>
<L>At once the pleasing images withdrew,</L>
<L>And more than horrors crouded on my view;</L>
<L>Thy uncle's form, in all his ire array'd,</L>
<L>Serenely dreadful stalk'd along the shade,</L>
<L>Pierc'd by his sword, I sunk upon the ground,</L>
<L>The spectre ghastly smil'd upon the wound;</L>
<L>A group of black infernals round me hung,</L>
<L>And toss'd my infamy from tongue to tongue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
<L>Detested wretch! how impotent thy age!</L>
<L>How weak'thy malice! and how kind thy rage!</L>
<L>Spite of thyself, inhuman as thou art,</L>
<L>Thy murdering hand has left me all my heart;</L>
<L>Left me each tender, fond affection, warm,</L>
<L>A nerve to tremble, and an eye to charm.</L>
<L>No, cruel, cruel, exquisite in ill,</L>
<L>Thou thought'st it dull barbarity to kill;</L>
<L>My death had robb'd lost vengeance of her toil,</L>
<L>And scarcely warm'd a Scythian to a smile:</L>
<L>Sublimer furies taught thy soul to glow</L>
<L>With all their savage mysteries of woe;</L>
<L>Taught thy unfeeling poniard to destroy</L>
<L>The powers of nature, and the source of joy;</L>
<L>To stretch me on the racks of vain desire,</L>
<L>Each passion throbbing, and each wish on fire;</L>
<L>Mad to enjoy, unable to be blest,</L>
<L>Fiends in my veins, and hell within my breast.</L>

<L>Aid me, fair faith! assist me, grace divine!</L>
<L>Ye martyrs! bless me, and ye saints! refine,</L>
<L>Ye sacred groves! ye heaven-devoted walls!</L>
<L>Where folly sickens, and where virtue calls;</L>
<L>Ye vows! ye altars! from this bosom tear</L>
<L>Voluptuous love, and leave no anguish there:</L>
<L>Oblivion! be thy blackest plume display'd</L>
<L>O'er all my griefs, and hide me in the shade;</L>
<L>And thou, too fondly idoliz'd! attend,</L>
<L>While awful reason whispers in the friend;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="16"/>
Friend, did I say? immortals! what a name?</L>
<L>Can dull, cold friendship, own so wild a flame?</L>
<L>No; let thy lover, whose enkindling eye</L>
<L>Shot all his soul between thee and the sky,</L>
<L>Whose warmths bewitch'd thee, whose unhallow'd song</L>
<L>Call'd thy rapt ear to die upon his tongue,</L>
<L>Now strongly rouze, while heaven his zeal inspires</L>
<L>Diviner transports, and more holy fires;</L>
<L>Calm all thy passions, all thy peace restore,</L>
<L>And teach that snowy breast to heave no more.</L>

<LG>
<L>Torn from the world, within dark cells immur'd,</L>
<L>By angels guarded, and by vows secur'd,</L>
<L>To all that once awoke thy fondness dead,</L>
<L>And hope, pale sorrow's last sad refuge, fled;</L>
<L>Why wilt thou weep, and sigh, and melt in vain,</L>
<L>Brood o'er false joys, and hug th'ideal chain?</L>
<L>Say, canst thou wish, that, madly wild to fly</L>
<L>From yon bright portal opening in the sky,</L>
<L>Thy Abelard should bid his God adieu,</L>
<L>Pant at thy feet, and taste thy charms anew?</L>
<L>Ye heavens! if to this tender bosom woo'd,</L>
<L>Thy mere idea harrows up my blood;</L>
<L>If one faint glimpse of Eloise can move</L>
<L>The fiercest, wildest agonies of love;</L>
<L>What shall I be, when, dazzling as the light,</L>

<L>Look on thyself, consider who thou art,</L>

See, while devotion's ever-melting strain</L>

<L>Vain fruitless wish! still, still, the vigorous flame</L>

Spite of the joys that truth and virtue prove,</L>

<L>Unbars the gates of light, and bids thee live;</L>
<L>Seize on th'auspicious moment ere it flee,</L>

But when, by some accident, they are set on fire, they then produce dreadful ex∣plosions, very destructive to the miners; and bursting out of the pits with great impetuosity, like the fiery eruptions from burning mountains, force along with them ponderous bodies to a great height in the air.</NOTE>,</L>

Being arrived at the coal, he may suppose himself still to descend, by ways less steep, till, after a journey of a mile and a half, he arrives at the profoundest parts of the mine.

At such places there seem to have been breaks in the earth, from the surface downwards; one part of the earth seeming to have sunk down, while the part adjoining has remained in its ancient situation. In some of these places, the earth may have sunk ten or twenty fathoms, or more; in other places, less than one fathom. These breaks, the miners call Dykes; and when they come at one of them, their first care is to discover whether the starta in the part adjoining be higher or lower than in the part where they have been working: or, (to use their own terms) whether the coal be cast down, or cast up. If it be cast down, they sink a pit to it; but if it be cast up to any considerable height, they are often-times obliged, with great labour and expence, as at the place here described, to carry forwards a level or long gallery through the rock, until they again arrive at the stratum of coal.</NOTE>, the miner's way to close,</L>

While pent within the iron womb<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>While pent within the iron womb,</HI> &amp;c.] The author hath here taken occasion to celebrate the fire-engine, the invention of which does such honour to this nation. He has endeavoured to describe, in a po∣etic manner, the effects of the elastic steam, and the great power of the atmosphere; which, by their alternate actions, give force and motion to the beam of this engine, and by it, to the pump-rods, which elevate the water through tubes, and discharge it out of the mine. It appears, from pretty exact calculations, that it would require about 550 men, or a power equal to that of 110 horses, to work the pumps of one of the largest fire-engines now in use, (the diameter of whose cylinder is se∣venty inches) and thrice that number of men to keep an engine of this size constantly at work. And that as much water may be raised by an engine of this size kept constantly at work, as can be drawn up by 2520 men with rollers and buckets, after the manner now daily practised in many mines; or as much as can be borne up on the shoulders of twice that number of men; as is said to be done in some of the mines of Peru.—So great is the power of the air in one of those engines.</P>
<P>There are four fire-engines belonging to this colliery; which, when all at work, discharge from it about 1228 gallons every minute, at thirteen strokes; 1,768,320 gallons every twenty-four hours. By the four engines here employed, nearly twice the above-mentioned quantity of water might be discharged from mines that are not above sixty or seventy fathoms deep, which depth is rarely exceeded in the Newcastle collieries, or in any of the English collieries, those of Whitehaven ex∣cepted.</P>
<P>The reader may find an account of Savery's engine in Harris's Lexi∣con Technicum.—Many great improvements have been made to it since, and are daily making; several of which are related in the Philosophical Transactions. The best account of it, its various improvement and uses, is, I think, in Dr. Desaguliers's course of experimental philoso∣phy, vol. 11.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>Sweet <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Sweet Keswick's vale,</HI> &amp;c.] This delightful vale is thus elegantly described by the late ingenious Dr. Brown in a letter to a friend. <Q REND="inline">"In my way to the north from Hagley, I passed through Dovedale; and, to say the truth, was disappointed in it. When I came to Buxton, I vi∣sited another or two of their romantic scenes; but these are inferior to Dovedale. They are all but poor miniatures of Keswick; which ex∣ceeds them more in grandeur than I can give you to imagine; and more, if possible, in beauty than in grandeur.<P>"Instead of the narrow slip of valley which is seen at Dovedale, you have at Keswick a vast amphitheatre, in circumference above twenty miles. Instead of a meagre rivulet, a noble living lake, ten miles round, of an oblong form, adorned with a variety of wooded islands. The rocks indeed of Dovedale are finely wild, pointed, and irregular; but the hilis are both little and unanimated; and the margin of the brook is poorly edged with weeds, morass, and brushwood. But at Keswick, you will, on one side of the lake, see a rich and beautiful landskip of cultivated fields, rising to the eye in fine inequalities, with noble groves of oak, happily dispersed; and climbing the adjacent hills, shade above shade, in the most various and picturesque forms. On the opposite shore, you will find rocks and cliffs of stupendous height, hanging broken over the like in horrible grandeur, some of them a thousand feet high, the woods climbing up their steep and shaggy sides, where mortal foot never yet approached: on these dreadful heights the eagles build their nests; a variety of water-falls are seen pouring from their summits, and tumbling in vast sheets from rock to rock in rude and ter∣rible magnificence: while on all sides of this immense amphitheatre the lofty mountains rise round, piercing the clouds in shapes as spiry and fantastic as the very rocks of Dovedale. To this I must add the fre∣quent and bold projection of the cliffs into the lake, forming noble bays and promontories: in other parts they finely retire from it, and often open in abrupt chasms or clefts, through which at hand you see rich and uncultivated vales, and beyond these, at various distance, mountain rising over mountain; among which, new prospects present themselves in mist, till the eye is lost in an agreeable perplexity.</P>
<Q><L>Where active fancy travels beyond sense,</L>
<L>And pictures things unseen.—</L></Q>
<P>Were I to analyse the two places into their constituent principles, I should tell you, that the full perfection of Keswick consists of three cir∣cumstances, beauty, horror, and immensity united; the second of which alone is found in Dovedale. Of beauty it hath little; nature having left it almost a desert: neither its small extent, nor the diminutive and life∣less form of the hills, admit magnificence; but to give you a complete idea of these three perfections, as they are joined in Keswick, would re∣quire the united powers of Claude, Salvator, and Poussin. The first should throw his delicate sunshine over the cultivated vales, the scat∣tered cots, the groves, the lake, and wooded islands. The second should dash out the horror of the rugged cliffs, the steeps, the hanging woods, and foaming water-falls; while the grand pencil of Poussin should crown the whole with the majesty of the impending mountains.</P>
<P>"So much, for what I would call the permanent beauties of this astonishing seene. Were I not afraid of being tiresome, I could now dwell as long on its varying or accidental beauties. I would sail round the lake, anchor in every bay, and land you on every promontory and island. I would point out the perpetual change of prospect: the woods, rocks, cliffs, and mountains, by turns vanishing or rising into view: now gaining on the sight, hanging over our heads in their full dimen∣sions, beautifully dreadful; and now, by a change of situation, assuming new romantic shapes, retiring and lessening on the eye, and insensibly losing themselves in an azure mist. I would remark the contrast of light and shade, produced by the morning and evening sun; the one gilding the western, the other the eastern side of this immense amphi∣theatre; while the vast shadow projected by the mountains buries the opposite part in a deep and purple gloom, which the eye can hardly pe∣netrate: the natural variety of colouring which the several objects pro∣duce is no less wonderful and pleasing: the ruling tincts in the valley being those of azure, green, and gold, yet ever various, arising from an intermixture of the lake, the woods, the grass, and corn-fields: these are finely contrasted by the grey rocks and cliffs; and the whole heigh∣tened by the yellow streams of light, the purple hues, and misty azure of the mountains. Sometimes a serene air and clear sky disclose the tops of the highest hills: at others, you see the clouds involving their sum∣mits, resting on their sides, or descending to their base, and rolling among the vallies, as in a vast furnace; when the winds are high, they roar among the cliffs and caverns like peals of thunder; then, too, the clouds are seen in vast bodies sweeping along the hills in gloomy great∣ness, while the lake joins the tumult, and tosses like a sea: but in calm weather the whole scene becomes new: the lake is a perfect mirror; and the landskip in all its beauty: islands, fields, woods, rocks, and mountains, are seen inverted, and floating on its surface. I will now carry you to the top of a cliff, where, if you dare approach the ridge, a new scene of astonishment presents itself; where the valley, lake, and islands, seem lying at your feet; where this expanse of water ap∣pears diminished to a little pool amidst the vast and immeasurable ob∣jects that surround it; for here the summits of more distant hills appear beyond those you have already seen; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ising behind each other in successive ranges and azure groups of craggy and broken steeps, form an immense and awful picture, which can only be expressed by the image of a tempestuous sea of mountains. Let me now conduct you down again to the valley, and conclude with one circumstance more; which is, that a walk by still moon-light (at which time the distant water-falls are heard in all their variety of sound) among these inchant∣ing dales, open such scenes of delicate beauty, repose, and solemnity, as exceed all description.</P></Q></P></NOTE> Keswick's vale, the muse will guide.</L>

<L>YOU ask me, madam, if the muse</L>

</LG>

<L>She, that at Bath, so debonair,</L>
<L>Sung gallant Damon and his fair,</L>
<L>To beauteous Townsend tun'd her lyre,</L>
<L>And did, at Pelham's sight, inspire</L>
<L>Strains, that her Lincoln's self forgives</L>
<L>(You see the daring poet lives!)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She, that at Percy-Lodge so late</L>
<L>From morn to night was us'd to prate,</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="61"/>
Almost impertinent and rude,</L>
<L>Unbidden would herself intrude</L>
<L>With tale, and epigram, and song,</L>
<L>To waft the chearful hours along,</L>
<L>Whilst I, o'erjoy'd myself to view</L>
<L>Alive, and with my lord and you,</L>
<L>Not once could check her merry vein,</L>
<L>Her unpremeditated strain,</L>
<L>And did, from heedless joy, neglect</L>
<L>To greatness every grave respect;</L>
<L>This muse, I say, inconstant grown,</L>
<L>Forsook me, when I came to town;</L>
<L>Friend to my fortune, she withdrew,</L>
<L>When I left Percy-Lodge and you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since then, in vain I ask her aid,</L>
<L>In vain her cruelty upbraid;</L>
<L>The town, she says, was ne'er her choice;</L>
<L>If there she tries to raise her voice,</L>
<L>Her strains are to their theme unjust,</L>
<L>Or drown'd in noise, or choak'd with dust.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her plea is good. The muse's theme,</L>
<L>Like the pure, bright, harmonious stream,</L>

<L>Cities and bards are endless foes.</L>

<L>How rare does pleasure stand the test!</L>

<L>The suppliant prayer, and tributary song:</L>
<L>To thee from all thy mortal offspring due;</L>
<L>From thee we came, from thee our being drew;</L>
<L>Whatever lives and moves, great Sire! is thine,</L>

<L>The wheeling orbs, the wandering fires above,</L>
<L>That round this earthly sphere incessant move,</L>

Such is the awe imprest on nature round</L>
<L>When through the void thy dreadful thunders sound.</L>

<L>Thus paramount to all, by all obey'd,</L>
<L>Ruling that reason which thro' all convey'd</L>

<L>Vice is the act of man, by passion tost,</L>

<L>One universal law of truth and right;</L>

<L>Hear not, or heed not reason's sacred voice,</L>
<L>That common guide ordain'd to point the road</L>
<L>That leads obedient man to solid good.</L>
<L>Thence quitting virtue's lovely paths they rove,</L>
<L>As various objects various passions move.</L>
<L>Some thro' opposing crowds and threatning war</L>
<L>Seek power's bright throne, and fame's triumphal car.</L>

Some, bent on wealth, pursue with endless pain</L>
<L>Oppressive, sordid, and dishonest gain:</L>
<L>While others, to soft indolence resign'd,</L>
<L>Drown in corporeal sweets th'immortal mind.</L>
<L>But, O great father, thunder-ruling God!</L>
<L>Who in thick darkness mak'st thy dread abode!</L>
<L>Thou, from whose bounty all good gifts descend,</L>
<L>Do thou from ignorance mankind defend!</L>
<L>The clouds of vice and folly, O controul;</L>
<L>And shed the beams of wisdom on the soul!</L>
<L>Those radiant beams, by whose all-piercing flame</L>
<L>Thy justice rules this universal frame.</L>
<L>That honour'd with a portion of thy light</L>
<L>We may essay thy goodness to requite</L>
<L>With honorary songs and grateful lays,</L>
<L>And hymn thy glorious works with ceaseless praise,</L>
<L>The proper task of man: and sure to sing</L>
<L>Of nature's laws, and nature's mighty king</L>
<L>Is bliss supreme. Let gods with mortals join!</L>

<L>As when fair morning dries her pearly tears,</L>
<L>The mountain lifts o'er mists its lofty head;</L>
<L>Thus new to sight a gothic dome appears</L>
<L>With the grey rust of rolling years o'erspread.</L>
<L>Here Superstition holds her dreary reign,</L>
<L>And her lip-labour'd orisons she plies</L>
<L>In tongue unknown, when morn bedews the plain,</L>
<L>Or evening skirts with gold the western skies;</L>

<L>Stretching in darksome cave along the ground.</L>
<L>No object e'er awakes his stupid eyes,</L>
<L>Nor voice articulate arrests his ears,</L>
<L>Save when beneath the moon pale spectres rise,</L>
<L>And haunt his soul with visionary fears:</L>

<L>The chidings of the headlong brook;</L>
<L>The green leaf shivering in the gale;</L>
<L>The warbling hill, the lowing vale;</L>
<L>The distant woodman's echoing stroke;</L>
<L>The thunder of the falling oak.</L>
<L>From thought to thought in vision led,</L>
<L>He holds high converse with the dead;</L>

<L>Those sacred drops, by virtuous weakness shed,</L>

<LG>
<L>FAR in the windings of a vale,</L>
<L>Fast by a sh ltering wood,</L>
<L>The safe retreat of Health and Peace,</L>
<L>An humble cottage stood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There beauteous Emma flourish'd fair</L>
<L>Beneath a mother's eye;</L>
<L>Whose only wish on earth was now</L>
<L>To see her blest, and die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The softest blush that Nature spreads</L>
<L>Gave colour to her cheek:</L>
<L>Such orient colour smiles thro' heaven,</L>
<L>When vernal mornings break.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="105" REF="111"/>
<L>Nor let the pride of great ones scorn</L>
<L>This charmer of the plains:</L>
<L>That sun, who bids their diamond blaze,</L>
<L>To paint our lilly deigns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long had she fill'd each youth with love,</L>
<L>Each maiden with despair;</L>
<L>And tho' by all a wonder own'd,</L>
<L>Yet knew not she was fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Till Edwin came, the pride of swains,</L>
<L>A soul devoid of art;</L>
<L>And from whose eye, serenely mild,</L>
<L>Shone forth the feeling heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A mutual flame was quickly caught:</L>
<L>Was quickly too reveal'd:</L>
<L>For neither bosom lodg'd a wish</L>
<L>That virtue keeps conceal'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What happy hours of home-selt bliss</L>
<L>Did love on both bestow!</L>
<L>But bliss too mighty long to last,</L>
<L>Where fortune proves a foe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His sister, who, like Envy form'd,</L>
<L>Like her in mischief joy'd,</L>
<L>To work them harm, with wicked skill,</L>
<L>Each darker art employ'd.</L>
</LG>

<L>The Father too, a sordid man,</L>
<L>Who love nor pity knew,</L>
<L>Was all unfeeling as the clod</L>
<L>From whence his riches grew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long had he seen their secret flame,</L>
<L>And seen it long unmov'd:</L>
<L>Then with a father's frown at last</L>
<L>Had sternly disapprov'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In Edwin's gentle heart, a war</L>

<L>Deny'd her sight, he oft behind</L>

<L>Oft too on Stanemore's wintry waste,</L>
<L>Beneath the moon-light shade,</L>
<L>In fighs to pour his soften'd soul,</L>
<L>The midnight mourner stray'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His cheek, where health with beauty glow'd,</L>
<L>A deadly pale o'ercast:</L>
<L>So fades the fresh rose in its prime,</L>
<L>Before the northern blast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="107" REF="113"/>
<L>The parents now, with late remorse,</L>
<L>Hung o'er his dying bed;</L>
<L>And weary'd heaven with fruitless vows,</L>
<L>And fruitless sorrow shed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis past! he cry'd—but if your souls</L>
<L>Sweet mercy yet can move,</L>
<L>Let these dim eyes once more behold</L>
<L>What they must ever love!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She came; his cold hand softly touch'd,</L>
<L>And bath'd with many a tear:</L>
<L>Fast-falling o'er the primrose pale,</L>
<L>So morning dews appear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But oh! his sister's jealous care,</L>
<L>A cruel sister she!</L>
<L>Forbade what Emma came to say;</L>
<L>" My Edwin, live for me."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now homeward as she hopeless wept</L>
<L>The church-yard path along,</L>
<L>The blast blew cold, the dark owl scream'd</L>
<L>Her lover's funeral song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Amid the falling gloom of night,</L>

<L>Alone, appall'd, thus had she past</L>
<L>The visionary vale—</L>
<L>When lo! the death-bell smote her ear,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Just then she reach'd, with trembling step,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>I feel, I feel this breaking heart</L>
<L>Beat high against my side—</L>
<L>From her white arm down sunk her head,</L>
<L>She shivering sigh'd, and died.</L>

<HEAD>AN ELEGY ON A PILE OF RUINS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY J. CUNNINGHAM.</BYLINE>

<L>IN the full prospect yonder hill commands</L>
<L>O'er forests, fields, and vernal-coated plains;</L>
<L>The vestige of an ancient abbey stands,</L>
<L>Close by a ruin'd castle's rude remains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="109" REF="115"/>
<L>Half buried, there, lie many a broken bust,</L>
<L>And obelisk, and urn, o'erthrown by time;</L>
<L>And many a cherub, here, descends in dust</L>
<L>From the rent roof, and portico sublime.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The rivulets, oft frighted at the sound</L>
<L>Of fragments tumbling from the towers on high,</L>
<L>Plunge to their source in secret caves profound,</L>
<L>Leaving their banks and pebbly bottoms dry.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where reverend shrines in gothic grandeur stood,</L>
<L>The nettle, or the noxious night-shade, spreads;</L>
<L>And ashlings, wafted from the neighbouring wood,</L>
<L>Thro' the worn turrets wave their trembling heads.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There Contemplation, to the crowd unknown,</L>
<L>Her attitude compos'd, and aspect sweet!</L>
<L>Sits musing on a monumental stone,</L>
<L>And points to the memento at her feet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon as sage evening check'd day's sunny pride,</L>
<L>I left the mantling shade, in moral mood;</L>
<L>And, seated by the maid's sequester'd side,</L>
<L>Thus sigh'd, the mouldering ruins as I view'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Inexorably calm, with silent pace,</L>
<L>Here Time has pass'd—What ruin marks his way!</L>
<L>This pile, now crumbling o'er its hallow'd base,</L>
<L>Turn'd not his step, nor could his course delay.</L>

<L>Religion rais'd her supplicating eyes</L>

<L>Low levell'd in the dust her darling's laid!</L>
<L>Death pitied not the pride of youthful bloom;</L>

<L>The relicks of a mitred saint may rest,</L>

<L>Where the light lyre gave many a softening sound,</L>

<HEAD>SLANDER: OR, THE WITCH OF WOKEY<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Wokey-hole is a noted cavern in Somersetshire, which has given birth to as many wild fanciful stories as the Sybils cave in Italy. Through a very narrow entrance, it opens into a large vault, the roof whereof, either on account of its height, or the thickness of the gloom, cannot be discovered by the light of torches. It goes winding a great way underground, is crost by a stream of very cold water, and is all horrid with broken pieces of rock: many of these are evident petrifac∣tions; which on account of their singular forms, have given rise to the fables alluded to in this poem.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<L>Of mutual rapture, she devoted fell</L>
<L>The mournful victim of the conquering hand</L>
<L>Of unrelenting Death: he dread approach'd,</L>
<L>And Nature trembled at his ghastly mien.</L>
<L>Her Damon now, in moving strains, laments,</L>
<L>And sadly pensive to her sacred tomb</L>
<L>He oft repairs, there drops a lover's tear,</L>
<L>While fond Remembrance opens all the scene</L>
<L>Of past delight, calls forth his beauteous bride</L>
<L>In visionary bloom once more to blaze</L>
<L>In all-attractive charms, till lost again</L>
<L>The phantom glides in air: all Nature wears</L>
<L>To him a face of woe; the valleys round</L>
<L>Re-echo doleful to his moving moan.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So Beauty fades, so fleets its showy life,</L>
<L>As droops the lily, clad in all its pride</L>
<L>Of rich array. Yet while the pensive muse</L>
<L>Touches the springs of grief, may no dark gloom</L>
<L>O'erwhelm your souls, for innocence survives</L>
<L>To bloom eternal: and while life invites</L>
<L>To view its gayer scenes, amidst the pomp</L>
<L>Of radiant courts, still chearful move along</L>
<L>Its flowery walks, and lead with jovial heart</L>
<L>The laughing moments on; for Beauty shines</L>
<L>First in the gaudy circles, and commands</L>
<L>Fond admiration. As Britannia's sons</L>
<L>Excel in every virtue, manly brave</L>
<L>Amidst th' alarms of fate, gen'rous, sincere,</L>
<L><PB N="189" REF="195"/>
By glory kindled, may her virgins too,</L>
<L>Supremely fair, 'midst Beauty's brightest blaze,</L>
<L>In soft perfections shine; may Hymen wave</L>
<L>His purple wings, and o'er the sacred couch</L>
<L>His azure mantle spread, as down ye sink</L>
<L>In wedlock's chaste embrace, and oft renew</L>
<L>The hallow'd rapture: thus may peaceful life</L>
<L>Flow undisturb'd, nor jarring feud invade</L>
<L>Your happy hours. And ye, gay circles, now</L>
<L>Forgive the Muse, which daring thus has sung</L>
<L>Of Beauty's triumphs, tho' unequal far</L>
<L>To the delightful theme; yet Beauty charm'd</L>
<L>My soul, and pour'd into my glowing breast</L>
<L>Her fascination, led me thro' the maze</L>
<L>Of Love: nor unambitious of applause</L>
<L>She courts your smiles, yours is her pleasing song.</L>
<L>To you she warbles, and devoted pays</L>
<L>Her fond oblation to your radiant charms.</L>
<L>But chief indulgent, 'midst the shining throng,</L>
<L>Will fair Dorinda smile; she first inspir'd</L>
<L>My heart with Love, to her my early Muse</L>
<L>Her infant raptures pour'd; happy if now</L>
<L>Sweet flow my numbers on her judging ear,</L>
<L>And steal persuasive to her virgin breast.</L>

<HEAD>THE TRIUMPH OF ISIS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OCCASIONED BY THE FOREGOING POEM.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DR. THOMAS WARTON.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>ON closing flowers when genial gales diffuse</L>
<L>The fragrant tribute of refreshing dews;</L>
<L>When chaunts the milk-maid at her balmy pail,</L>
<L>And weary reapers whistle o'er the vale;</L>
<L>Charm'd by the murmurs of the quivering shade,</L>
<L>O'er Isis' willow-fringed banks I stray'd:</L>
<L>And calmly musing thro' the twilight way,</L>
<L>In pensive mood I fram'd the Doric lay.</L>
<L>When lo! from opening clouds, a golden gleam</L>
<L>Pour'd sudden splendors o'er the shadowy stream;</L>
<L>And from the wave arose its guardian queen,</L>
<L>Known by her sweeping stole of glossy green;</L>
<L>While in the coral crown that bound her brow,</L>
<L>Was wove the Delphic laurel's verdant bough.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As the smooth surface of the dimply flood,</L>
<L>The silver-slipper'd Isis lightly trod,</L>
<L>From her loose hair the dropping dew she press'd,</L>
<L>And thus mine ear in accents mild address'd.</L>
</LG>

<L>No more, my son, the rural reed employ,</L>
<L>Nor trill the trifting strain of empty joy;</L>
<L>No more thy love-resounding sonnets suit</L>
<L>To notes of pastoral pipe or oaten flute.</L>
<L>For hark! high-thron'd on you majestic walls,</L>
<L>To the dear Muse afflicted Freedom calls:</L>
<L>When Freedom calls, and Oxford bids thee sing,</L>
<L>Why stays thy hand to strike the sounding string?</L>
<L>While thus, in Freedom's and in Phoebus' spite,</L>
<L>The venal sons of slavish Cam, unite;</L>
<L>To shake yon towers, when Malice rears her crest,</L>
<L>Shall all my sons in silence idly rest?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still sing, O Cam, your favourite Freedom's cause;</L>
<L>Still boast of Freedom, while you break her laws:</L>
<L>To power your songs of gratulation pay,</L>
<L>To courts address soft Flattery's soothing lay.</L>
<L>What tho' your gentle Mason's plaintive verse</L>
<L>Has hung with sweetest wreaths Musaeus' hearse;</L>
<L>What tho' your vaunted bard's ingenuous woe,</L>
<L>Soft as my stream, in tuneful numbers flow?</L>
<L>Yet strove his Muse, by Fame or Envy led,</L>
<L>To tear the laurels from a sister's head?—</L>
<L>Misguided youth! with rude unclassic rage</L>
<L>To blot the beauties of thy whiter page;</L>
<L>A rage that sullies ev'n thy guiltless lays,</L>
<L>And blasts the vernal bloom of half thy bays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let Granta boast the patrons of her name,</L>
<L>Each pompous fool of Fortune and of Fame:</L>
<L>Still of preferment let her shine the queen,</L>
<L>Prolific parent of each bowing dean:</L>
<L><PB N="207" REF="213"/>
Be hers each prelate of the pamper'd cheek,</L>
<L>Each courtly chaplain sanctify'd and sleek;</L>
<L>Still let the drones of her exhaustless hive</L>
<L>On fat pluralities supinely thrive:</L>
<L>Still let her senates titled slaves revere,</L>
<L>Nor dare to know the patriot from the peer;</L>
<L>For tinsel'd courts their laurel'd mount despise,</L>
<L>In stars and strings superlatively wise:</L>
<L>No longer charm'd by Virtue's golden lyre,</L>
<L>Who sung of old amid th' Aonian choir,</L>
<L>Where Cam, slow winding thro' the breezy reeds,</L>
<L>With kindly wave his groves of laurel feeds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis ours, my son, to deal the sacred bay,</L>
<L>Where Honour calls, and Justice points the way;</L>
<L>To wear the well-earn'd wreath which Merit brings,</L>
<L>And snatch a gift beyond the reach of kings.</L>
<L>Scorning, and scorn'd by courts, yon Muses' bower</L>
<L>Still nor enjoys, nor asks the smile of power.</L>
<L>Tho' wakeful Vengeance watch my crystal spring.</L>
<L>Tho' Persecution wave her iron wing,</L>
<L>And o'er yon spiry temples as she flies,</L>
<L>" These destin'd seats be mine," exulting cries;</L>
<L>On Isis still each gift of Fortune waits,</L>
<L>Still Peace and Plenty deck my beauteous gates.</L>
<L>See Science walks with freshest chaplets crown'd;</L>
<L>With songs of joy my festal groves resound;</L>
<L>My Muse divine still keeps her wonted state,</L>
<L>The front erect, and high majestic gait:</L>
<L>Green as of old, each oliv'd portal smiles,</L>
<L>And still the Graces build my Parian piles:</L>
<L><PB N="208" REF="214"/>
My Gothic spires in ancient grandeur rise,</L>
<L>And dare with wonted pride to rush into the skies;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! should'st thou fall (forbid it heavenly powers!)</L>
<L>Dash'd into dust with all thy cloud-capt towers;</L>
<L>Who but would mourn to British virtue dear,</L>
<L>What patriot could refuse the manly tear!</L>
<L>What British Marius could refrain to weep</L>
<L>O'er mighty Carthage fall'n, a prostrate heap!</L>

<L>Ev'n late when Radcliffe's delegated train</L>
<L>Auspicious shone in Isis' happy plain;</L>
<L>When yon proud <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Radcliffe's library.</NOTE> dome, fair Learning's amplest shrine;</L>
<L>Beneath its Attic roofs receiv'd the nine;</L>
<L>Mute was the voice of joy and loud applause,</L>
<L>To Radcliffe due, and Isis' honour'd cause?</L>
<L>What free-born crowds adorn the festive day,</L>
<L>Nor blush'd to wear my tributary bay!</L>
<L>How each brave breast with honest ardors heav'd,</L>
<L>When Sheldon's fane the patriot band receiv'd;</L>
<L>While, as we loudly hail'd the chosen few,</L>
<L>Rome's awful senate rush'd upon our view!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O may the day in latest annals shine,</L>
<L>That made a Beaufort, and an Harley mine:</L>
<L>Then bade them leave the lostier scene awhile,</L>
<L>The pomp of guiltless state, the patriot toil,</L>
<L>For bleeding Albion's aid the sage design,</L>
<L>To hold short dalliance with the tuneful nine.</L>
<L>Then Music left her golden sphere on high,</L>
<L>And bore each strain of triumph from the sky:</L>
<L><PB N="209" REF="215"/>
Swell'd the full song, and to my chiefs around</L>
<L>Pour'd the full Paeans of mellifluous sound,</L>
<L>My Naiads blythe the floating accents caught,</L>
<L>And listening danc'd beneath their pearly grot:</L>
<L>In gentler eddies play'd my wanton wave,</L>
<L>And all my reeds their softest whispers gave;</L>
<L>Each lay with brighter green adorn'd my bowers,</L>
<L>And breath'd a fresher fragrance on my flowers.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But lo! at once the swelling concerts cease,</L>
<L>And crowded theatres are hush'd in peace,</L>
<L>See, on yon Sage how all attentive stand,</L>
<L>To catch his darting eye, and waving hand.</L>
<L>Hark! he begins, with all a Tully's art</L>
<L>To pour the dictates of a Cato's heart.</L>
<L>Skill'd to pronounce what noblest thoughts inspire,</L>
<L>He blends the speaker's with the patriot's fire;</L>
<L>Bold to conceive, nor timorous to conceal,</L>
<L>What Britons dare to think, he dares to tell.</L>
<L>'Tis his alike the ear and eye to charm,</L>
<L>To win with action, and with sense to warm;</L>
<L>Untaught in flowery diction to dispense</L>
<L>The lulling sounds of sweet impertinence;</L>
<L>In frowns or smiles he gains an equal prize,</L>
<L>Nor meanly fears to sall, not creeps to rise;</L>
<L>Bids happier days to Albion be restor'd,</L>
<L>Bids ancient Justice rear her radiant sword;</L>
<L>From me, as from my country, wins applause,</L>
<L>And makes an Oxford's a Britannia's cause.</L>

<L>Some low-born worm, a lurking mischief dwells;</L>
<L>Eats his blind way, and saps with secret toil</L>
<L>The deep foundations of the watry pile.</L>
<L>In vain the forest lent its stateliest pride,</L>
<L>Rear'd her tall mast, and fram'd her knotty side;</L>
<L>In vain the thunder's martial rage she stood,</L>

<L>For, taught like ours, she dar'd with prudent pride,</L>
<L>Obedience from dependance to divide:</L>

<HEAD>THE CHARGE OF CYRUS THE GREAT.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY RICHARD ONELY, M. A.</BYLINE>

<L>WHAT means this awful sight? why round me shine</L>
<L>Those radiant glories, and that form divine?</L>
<L>See! where commission'd with some dread command,</L>
<L>How sternly waves you visionary hand!</L>
<L>Near and more near it beckons, "Cyrus, rise;</L>
<L>" The Gods remand thee to thy native skies."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since thus the pleasure of imperial Jove,</L>
<L>And solemn omens warn me from above;</L>
<L>Come then, ye fathers, venerable grown,</L>
<L>Whose steady counsels prop the Persian throne!</L>
<L>Ye friends, long wedded to fair Virtue's cause,</L>
<L>And ye, my sons, whom filial duty awes!</L>
<L>Attentive hear, amidst th' assembled throng,</L>
<L>The dying accents of a monarch's tongue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I cease to live! yet, ah! forbear to shew</L>
<L>The mad expressions of unmanly woe.</L>
<L>To die, is to be blest: this understood,</L>
<L>'Twere needless mourning for the wise and good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What Virtues charm us, or what Arts engage</L>
<L>In childhood, youth, in manhood, or in age,</L>
<L><PB N="243" REF="249"/>
In these I spent each well-distinguish'd day,</L>
<L>And still pursued, where Honour led the way:</L>
<L>Mine was each gift kind fortune could afford,</L>
<L>The statesman's counsel, or the hero's sword.</L>
<L>See, Asia, see thy once ignoble race,</L>
<L>What glory heightens, and what worthies grace!</L>
<L>See Peace thy realms with smiling train adorn,</L>
<L>And Plenty pour the treasures of her horn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, oft as Fortune blew propitious gales,</L>
<L>And mildest Zephyrs fann'd my swelling sails,</L>
<L>Still Caution warn'd me, anxious for the realm,</L>
<L>And Reason fear'd to quit her much-lov'd helm:</L>
<L>She calmly stemm'd Ambition's boisterous tide,</L>
<L>And lower'd the projects of gigantic Pride:</L>
<L>Hence unimpair'd are all my blessings now;</L>
<L>Hence fresh my laurels blooming o'er my brow:</L>
<L>Sage Foresight only keeps our conquests won;</L>
<L>The too secure too surely are undone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No claimant princes shall hereafter jar,</L>
<L>(The bloody sources of intestine war)</L>
<L>For thus I will—both ye, my children, share</L>
<L>Alike my fondness, and alike my care!</L>
<L>Yet you, my eldest, to the crown succeed;</L>
<L>'Tis what thy father, what the gods decreed.</L>
<L>Reflect, from whence that sacred power is given,</L>
<L>Its fount, the grand authority of heaven!</L>
<L>Reflect, that monarchs only were design'd</L>
<L>To guard their people, and to bless mankind!</L>
<L>Each royal mandate Equity should bound,</L>
<L>And Goodness cast a smile on all around.</L>

<L>Nor less, whilst, hovering o'er th' embattled field,</L>
<L>Her palms to thee fond Victory shall yield,</L>

<L>Without that god-like principle—To save:</L>
<L>Distress should bid our generous pity flow;</L>
<L>Whilst Nature softens at another's woe.</L>

<L>Not true by nature, man, whate'er he boast,</L>
<L>Most saithful seeming, may deceive the most.</L>
<L>Be thine the well-try'd statesman, prudent, just,</L>
<L>Unsway'd by lucre, unenslav'd by lust;</L>
<L>Who public good prefers to private ends,</L>
<L>Whose truth directs you, and whose zeal defends.</L>

<L>STERN Winter hence with all his train removes;</L>
<L>And chearful skies and limpid streams are seen;</L>
<L>Thick-sprouting foliage decorates the groves;</L>
<L>Reviving herbage robes the fields in green.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet lovelier scenes shall crown th' advancing year;</L>
<L>When blooming Spring's full bounty is display'd;</L>
<L>The smile of beauty every vale shall wear;</L>
<L>The voice of song enliven every shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Fancy, paint not coming days too fair!</L>
<L>Oft for the prospects sprightly May should yield,</L>
<L>Rain-pouring clouds have darken'd all the air,</L>
<L>Or snows untimely whiten'd o'er the field:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But should kind Spring her wonted bounty shower,</L>
<L>The smile of beauty and the voice of song;</L>
<L>If gloomy thought the human mind o'erpower,</L>
<L>Ev'n vernal hours glide unenjoy'd along.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="254" REF="260"/>
<L>I shun the scenes where maddening Passion raves;</L>
<L>Where Pride and Folly high dominion hold,</L>
<L>And unrelenting Avarice drives her slaves</L>
<L>O'er prostrate Virtue in pursuit of gold:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The grassy lane, the wood-surrounded field,</L>
<L>The rude stone-fence with fragrant wall-flowers gay,</L>
<L>The clay-built cot, to me more pleasure yield</L>
<L>Than all the pomp imperial domes display;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet ev'n here amid these secret shades,</L>
<L>These simple scenes of unreprov'd delight,</L>
<L>Affliction's iron hand my breast invades,</L>
<L>And Death's dread dart is ever in my sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While genial suns to genial showers succeed;</L>
<L>(The air all mildness, and the earth all bloom)</L>
<L>While herds and flocks range sportive o'er the mead;</L>
<L>Crop the sweet herb, and snuff the rich perfume;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O why alone to hapless man deny'd</L>
<L>To taste the bliss inferior beings boast!</L>
<L>O why this fate that fear and pain divide</L>
<L>His few short hours on earth's delightful coast!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah cease—no more of Providence complain!</L>
<L>'Tis sense of guilt that wakes the mind to woe,</L>
<L>Gives force to fear, adds energy to pain,</L>
<L>And palls each joy by heaven indulg'd below:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="255" REF="261"/>
<L>Why else the smiling infant train so blest,</L>
<L>Ere dear-bought knowledge ends the peace within,</L>
<L>Or wild desire inflames the youthful breast,</L>
<L>Or ill propension ripens into sin?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As to the bleating tenants of the field,</L>
<L>As to the sportive warblers on the trees,</L>
<L>To them their joys sincere the seasons yield,</L>
<L>And all their days and all their prospects please;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such joys were mine when from the peopled streets,</L>
<L>Where on Thame<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s' banks I liv'd immur'd,</L>
<L>The new blown fields that breath'd a thousand sweets,</L>
<L>To Surry's wood-crown'd hills my steps allur'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O happy hours, beyond recovery fled!</L>
<L>What share I now "that can your loss repay,"</L>
<L>While o'er my mind these glooms of thought are spread,</L>
<L>And veil the light of life's meridian ray?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is there no power this darkness to remove?</L>
<L>The long-lost joys of Eden to restore,</L>
<L>Or raise our views to happier seats above,</L>
<L>Where Fear, and Pain, and Death shall be no more?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yes, those there are who know a Saviour's love</L>

<L>Where Fear, and Pain, and Death shall be no more:</L>

<L>These grateful share the gift of Nature's hand;</L>
<L>And in the varied scenes that round them shine;</L>

<L>Admire th' amazing workmanship divine.</L>

<L>Blows not a flow'ret in th' enamel'd vale,</L>
<L>Shines not a pebble where the rivulet strays;</L>
<L>Sports not an insect on the spicy gale;</L>

<L>For them ev'n vernal nature looks more gay,</L>
<L>For them more lively hues the fields adorn;</L>
<L>To them more fair the fairest smile of day,</L>
<L>To them more sweet the sweetest breath of morn.</L>

<LG>
<L>They feel the bliss that hope and faith supply;</L>
<L>They pass serene th' appointed hours that bring</L>

<L>THREE hours from noon the passing shadow shows,</L>

<L>Where are the flowers that made the garden gay?</L>

<L>All but the natives of the torrid zone,</L>

<L>Where is wild nature's heart-reviving song,</L>

<L>Silent in gloomy woods the feather'd throng</L>

<L>Where is the dream of bliss by Summer brought?</L>

<L>In different seasons different joys we place,</L>

<L>BY his hall chimney, where in rusty grate</L>
<L>Green faggots wept their own untimely fate,</L>
<L>In elbow-chair the pensive 'Squire reclin'd,</L>
<L>Revolving debts and taxes in his mind:</L>
<L>A pipe just fill'd, upon a table near</L>
<L>Lay by the London Evening stain'd with beer,</L>
<L>With half a bible, on whose remnants torn</L>
<L>Each parish round was annually forsworn.</L>

<L>The well known savour of the Parson's toes,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fair Ella! of all the gay throng</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! boast not of beauty's fond power,</L>
<L>For short is the triumph, ye fair!</L>
<L>Not fleeter the bloom of each flower;</L>
<L>And hope is but gilded despair.</L>
