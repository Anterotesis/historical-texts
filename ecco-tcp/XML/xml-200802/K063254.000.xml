<HEAD>DEDICATION. TO WILLIAM HAYLEY, ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM your writings I received all that in∣expressible Pleasure and Improvement which Eru∣dition ever affords the Mind of the feeling Man: From your Writings I learned to form a just Character of those illustrious Worthies, your mighty Predecessors, in that Chair where you now sit.—Permit me then, great Man! as a Lover of Poesy, and Reverer of Merit, to pay you this tributary Token of Respect.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TIRED with the Importunities of many, I at length selected the following Trifles, and presume to present them to the pub∣lic eye.</P>
<P>HOW far "Idle Verses essayed in early Age," may meet the public Approbation, I cannot tell; but he who endeavours well, surely ought not to be censured.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="7"/>JUVENILLE Compositions sometimes meet more good-natured Readers than rigid Critics: may such be the Fate of this Vo∣lume, written by an Author between his fifteenth and nineteenth Years.</P>
<P>SUCH Sensations as are in the Bosom of a penitent Criminal certain of immediate Death, but unknowing whither his im∣mortal Soul may go; such strong Sensa∣tions now beat high in me, whilst with a trembling Hand I pen these Lines, fearing the fatal Consequences "of flying from the safe Scenes of Privacy to meet in giddy Haste the public Eye."</P>
<P>BUT as some of the Productions of my boyish Fancy had appeared in the different
<PB N="vii" REF="8"/>
periodical Papers, I the more readily con∣sented to this Publication; and the Poems (such as they are) will be here found more correct.</P>
<P>SOME people will perhaps accuse me of that Vanity which so powerfully predomi∣nates in the youthful Mind, for attempt∣ing to climb that Ascent down which so many have tumbled.—In what I have written I meant well; I therefore present it to the Public, not with the Arrogance of an assuming young Man, but with all the submissive Modesty of an Author.</P>

THE VANITY OF FRIENDSHIP, A POEM, WRITTEN AFTER THE MANNER OF SWIFT. INSCRIBED TO RICE HARRISON, ESQ.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Who not needs, shall never lack a friend;</L>
<L>But who in want, a hollow friend doth try,</L>
<L>Directly seasons him his enemy.
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LG>
<L>"'TIS true we talk of Friendship much,</L>
<L>"But who are they who can keep touch?"</L>
<L>Thus sung Hibernia's patriot Dean,</L>
<L>In Satire's energetic strain;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="11"/>The story we have now in view,</L>
<L>Will prove his observations true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Seventeen hundred pounds a year;</L>
<L>Made <HI>Jack</HI> to all the country dear,</L>
<L>Of it he was no miser, as</L>
<L>His starving predecessor was,</L>
<L>Who left behind him what he stor'd,</L>
<L>Of gold, the god that he ador'd:</L>
<L>But <HI>Jack,</HI> Sir, liv'd a diff'rent way,</L>
<L>He spent his time in amours gay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He'd friends to come to him and dine,</L>
<L>To prodigally drink his wine,</L>
<L>To spend the tedious passing hours,</L>
<L>In costly pleasure's roseate bow'rs,</L>
<L>To take all from him they cou'd get,</L>
<L>To make him pay their tavern debt,</L>
<L>To give advice thro' private ends,</L>
<L>In short, <HI>who had so many friends?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
<L>But now, alas! the time was come,</L>
<L>When <HI>Jack</HI> had lost his stately home,</L>
<L>When he consum'd his whole estate,</L>
<L>That Fame might sound him goodly great,</L>
<L>When he had run in debt to have</L>
<L>Th' expensive suppers which he gave,</L>
<L>And now the sheriffs keepers laid</L>
<L>On house, 'till all the debts were paid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Now, let me think, (says <HI>Jack</HI>) I've gentry,</L>
<L>Who'll give me diet and my rent free;</L>
<L>There is Samuel, James, and John,</L>
<L>Generous Sidropel and Mun,</L>
<L>Whose numerous friendly actions shew'd</L>
<L>Their tempers hospitably good,</L>
<L>Whose soft benignity will grant</L>
<L>What my necessity may want;</L>
<L>With them I'll screen from Law's turmoils,</L>
<L>'Till Fortune more propitious smiles."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
<L>His case to Samuel then he told,</L>
<L>Him Samuel cordially condol'd,</L>
<L>But costly aid he wou'd not give,</L>
<L>Yet seem'd from teeth to greatly grieve.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Jack saw his dissembling mode,</L>
<L>He curs'd the gifts he ill bestow'd,</L>
<L>And hied to James's to sojourn—</L>
<L>But supplication meets with scorn:</L>
<L>He rap'd at door, sent in his name,</L>
<L>The servant with this answer came:—</L>
<L>"His Honour says, he does not know you;</L>
<L>"And bid me the hall-door to show you."</L>
<L>Thus baffled and abus'd by two,</L>
<L>He went to John, and told his woe;</L>
<L>But John, Sir, with a bow polite,</L>
<L>Exclaim'd his house was robb'd last night,</L>
<L>And was it not for that he wou'd</L>
<L>Repay the compliments he ow'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
<L><HI>Jack,</HI> stung with disappointment's pain,</L>
<L>At this unmerited disdain,</L>
<L>From those he almost rais'd from want,</L>
<L>Cry'd, "Cou'd I former deeds recant,</L>
<L>"I'd chuse with more judicious ken,</L>
<L>"My friends 'mid undesigning men."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wrap'd in such thoughts, which woe augment,</L>
<L>To generous Sidropel he went;</L>
<L>Who said his wife was brought-to-bed;</L>
<L>The Doctor's fee was not yet paid;</L>
<L>The house-rent was a heavy debt,</L>
<L>And money he cou'd no where get.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then quick to Mun he bent his way,</L>
<L>And told the Fates' severe decree,</L>
<L>Impell'd by Law's austere command,</L>
<L>Whose mandate poorness can't withstand,</L>
<L>To quit in mean Disguise's garb,</L>
<L>(Profusion's sure and just reward)</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="15"/>A patrimonial goodly seat,</L>
<L>His wealthy ancestor's estate;</L>
<L>And O! if happ'ly he wou'd glad,</L>
<L>A bosom miserably sad,</L>
<L>Ev'n with that cheering ray of hope,</L>
<L>Which might the present anguish stop,</L>
<L>He'd pray that to him shou'd be giv'n,</L>
<L>Transcendent joys, the gifts of Heav'n!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then Mun, replies "<HI>my dearest Jack,</HI></L>
<L>"You know the troubles <HI>on my back,</HI></L>
<L>"You know, Lord Love by passion led,</L>
<L>"Debas'd, defil'd my nuptial bed;</L>
<L>But when the damages I recover</L>
<L>I'll pay thy friendship more than over."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Poor Jack when he had try'd each friend,</L>
<L>And found none who'd assistance lend,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="16"/>Went home with sorrow in his heart,</L>
<L>Which now felt Penury's galling smart:</L>
<L>Scarce was he in, when noise at door</L>
<L>Made him his dreadful case deplore;</L>
<L>He thought 'twas bailiffs him to take,</L>
<L>But, oh, how pleasing the mistake!</L>
<L>'Twas letter, with the glad account,</L>
<L>He'd got a prize to the amount</L>
<L>Of twice five thousand sterling pound,</L>
<L>Which he might draw from lott'ry fund.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>His friends</HI> came the succeeding day,</L>
<L>Respects and compliments to pay,</L>
<L>And e'en to lend the wanted cash,</L>
<L>(They're sorry now they were so rash)</L>
<L>Says Jack (who with just passion burn'd)</L>
<L>Avaunt! by me ye're ever scorn'd!</L>
<L>Ye vile dissembling hypocrites!</L>
<L>Ye mean deceitful parasites!</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="17"/>I cherished ye, far worse than fiends,</L>
<L>And thought ye were my dearest friends;</L>
<L>Too late I see my sad mistake,</L>
<L>Experience must true wisdom make;</L>
<L>'Tis it can teach to justly scan</L>
<L>The temper of dissembling man.</L>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>—(Ades sunt multa loquacem)</L>
<L>Delassare valent Fabium—</L></Q></NOTE> <HI>I thought so num'rous were my friends,</HI></L>
<L>'<HI>Twou'd Fabius tire to tell their names!</HI></L>
<L>But now I plainly see, alas!</L>
<L>True Friendship neither is nor was.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O, HARRISON! belov'd, rever'd,</L>
<L>With truth by all, to all endear'd,</L>

AN EPISTLE FROM LADY G—, TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF C—.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AH, dear deluder, cause of all my woe,</L>
<L>Who made me break the solemn nuptial vow;</L>
<L>Who by compulsion and enticing charms,</L>
<L>Seduc'd me from the tend'rest husband's arms,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="21"/>Hear how too late my injur'd lord I mourn,</L>
<L>How eager I'd to Virtue's paths return.</L>
<L>Ah, vainest thought, my sacred honor's gone,</L>
<L>Snar'd by Persuasion's smooth ascendant tongue;</L>
<L>But now I grieve, abandon'd and alone,</L>
<L>My former frailties in Seclusion's gloom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How mem'ry rouses, (ah! that gushing tear)</L>
<L>In my rack'd brain ideas sadly dear,</L>
<L>That rapt'rous day Imagination sees,</L>
<L>When I sought much lov'd C— to please,</L>
<L>When I receiv'd thee in a blithe alcove,</L>
<L>Imperial object of my guilty love!</L>
<L>For o'er my head the graceful smiles were seen</L>
<L>Of genial Venus, Beauty's peerless queen,</L>
<L>With fair Adonis, vot'ry to her power,</L>
<L>In sweet embraces in the Idalian bower;</L>
<L>And white plum'd Jove, dissolv'd in soft desire,</L>
<L>O'ercome by Laeda and the golden fire,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="22"/>Myself beneath in brightest scarlet roll'd,</L>
<L>Sat mantled loosely with a veil of gold,</L>
<L>Lost in tumultuous languishments of love,</L>
<L>I made your heart with am'rous ardour move;</L>
<L>Oh! that I cou'd forget th' unhappy bliss,</L>
<L>But conscience stings o'ertake who did amiss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Low thoughted Slander's quick reviling tongue</L>
<L>Expos'd me, Virtue's progeny among:</L>
<L>Unhappy me, so vilified by Fame,</L>
<L>That late posterity shall hate my name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What is a woman once her virtue's gone;</L>
<L>She mourns the crime for which she can't atone,</L>
<L>Depriv'd of balmy slumbers lenient rest,</L>
<L>She feels recoiling torture in her breast,</L>
<L>Cold sweats, convulsions, agonizing pains,</L>
<L>Eternal throbbing through her languid veins,</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="23"/>Tumultuous rackings, sighs, distractions, fears,</L>
<L>And all th' effects of never ceasing tears;</L>
<L>She feels ineffable, her pain augment,</L>
<L>Beyond Imagination's vast extent,</L>
<L>My pen delineates not what she endures,</L>
<L>Death's raging pains are mild, compar'd to her's!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now from society, in solitude,</L>
<L>My youthful passion's impulse is subdu'd,</L>
<L>I'll banish C— far from my thoughts,</L>
<L>Revere my lord, repent my former faults,</L>
<L>And let my soul with seriousness be given</L>
<L>To the indulgent Majesty of Heaven.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Misfortunes ever follow lawless loves,</L>
<L>This our libidinous example proves.</L>
<L>Illicit love's supreme destructive powers</L>
<L>Destroy'd Heaven-founded Phrygia's lofty towers,</L>
<L>Illicit love degraded Tarquin's pride,</L>
<L>And drove from pomp th' imperious regicide:</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="24"/>Illicit love, Antonius, caus'd thy doom,</L>
<L>And spoil'd thee of th' imperial throne of Rome:</L>
<L>Illicit love untimely cropt the flower,</L>
<L>The blooming <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rosamond, daughter of Lord Clifford, and the beauti∣ful mistress of Henry the Second.</NOTE> boast of Woodstock's mazy bower;</L>
<L>Illicit love destroy'd—but sobs and sighs,</L>

<LG>
<L>WHAT Poet justly can recite,</L>
<L>O, Dargle, pregnant with delight!</L>
<L>The beauties of thy various bowers,</L>
<L>Where Nature sheds her kindly powers;</L>
<L>And gives perfections to each sense,</L>
<L>In pomp of rustic excellence?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here rocks high tow'ring tow'rds the skies,</L>

<L><PB N="24" REF="27"/>And here th' extending trees of Jove</L>
<L>Produce a cool imbowering grove,</L>

<L>Join concert with the mingled song,</L>
<L>Of the melodious feather'd throng.</L>

<L>Where thy brisk vot'ry, loveliest queen!</L>

<L>Where each soft breeze revives th' old man,</L>
<L>And strengthens Life's uncertain span.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
<L>Within thy lofty whisp'ring woods,</L>
<L>Where Dryads sport, and Sylvan Gods,</L>

</LG>

<L>"O, Powerscourt, graciously benign,</L>

<L>THY lawns, sweet village, and thy shady hills,</L>

<Q><P>Homo sum—et nihil humanum à me alienum.</P>
<BIBL>TERENCE.</BIBL>
<P>I am a Man, and bless'd with manly Feeling.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I WAS brought the other day by some of my juvenile acquaintance, into a cock-pit, and there heard the most gentle reproof that the tender lips of parental love could utter. Johannes, a sage gentleman, whom curiosity led to the pit,
<PB N="72" REF="67"/>
chanced to see his son Gallus at the opposite side, holding wagers; when the battle was terminated, Johannes asked Gallus did he lose. "No," re∣plied he, with the quick voice of joy, "I have won a crown." "I'm sorry for it," returned Johannes." Then after shaking his head and making a long pause, he continued—
<Q>I hope that crown may not cost you five hundred pounds.</Q></P>
<P>These few words made so deep an impression on my mind that I instantly left the pit, and vowed never to enter one again. When I had got home, reflection and sober reason made me plainly see the barbarity of that, which is termed an amusement only by the unfeeling, inconside∣rate, and mean.</P>
<P>Those people who are termed Cockers, are in general ignorant, avaricious, indolent, fond of
<PB N="73" REF="68"/>
inebriety, and fond of accumulating money 'in an easy way,' as they express themselves; with∣out once considering it is also an easy way of los∣ing it. What but a sordid desire of lucre makes a man go to such an opprobrious place! Youth should beware how they enter a cock-pit: if they win, they bet on expecting to win more; if they lose, Hope, which is so predominant in the hu∣man mind, stimulates them to bet on, with the desire of recovering their own. Turn your steps far from this seat of immorality and corruption, where the discordant voices of the blasphemers perpetually prophane that awful name, at the sound of which Virtue shudders with a religious fear.</P>
<P>How many illustrious personages have fallen unhappy victims to their insatiable passion for cock-fighting, and involved their rising families

in ruin! that fortune which should be theirs by hereditary right, the hand of Imprudence has squandered, by discharging the honourable debts at the sod.</P>
<P>The barbarity of this epidemic pastime no less affects the heart with sensations of pity, than the sight of men, who stake one half of their fortunes on a black-breasted duck-wing, of yellow pile affects the mind with wonder. A thousand pounds lost in a few minutes! such, in the course of years, must exhaust a man's pecuniary resources, were he master even of the riches of Chili and Peru. What do cockers or gamblers of any denomina∣tion depend on? Chance, blind chance. The unpropitious termination of a single battle may perhaps hurl them headlong from the glittering pinnacles of magnificence, to the vast profundity of poverty, and from thence to the low gloomy
<PB N="75" REF="72"/>
mansions of confinement, where they may pass away their dark days till death transports them from the miseries of life.</P>
<P>The pathetic Pope strongly inveighs against the cruelty practised by man to inferior creatures; and the unmanly diversions of cock-fighting and throwing at cocks, have been reprobated by him, and many of his cotemporaries. I knew a gentle∣man who tortured every creature, that his visitors might compare him to Domitian, because that monster once filled the powerful chair of domi∣nion. I have seen him put two flies on a needle, one at the eye, the other at the point, and while they in agonies would pull against each other, he'd cry—"Behold Domitian."</P>
<P>I shall conclude this paper with the story of Zai, which I recollect to have heard in the happy
<PB N="76" REF="73"/>
days of boyish innocence: Zai was the only son of Amazar the wealthy, who had amassed im∣mense riches by bringing merchandize from Egypt, and selling it again at considerable profit. Amazar, at the age of twenty-nine, met with an irreparable loss, which drove him to the height of melancholy: this was the death of the beau∣tiful Hasora, to whom he had been eight years joined in all the endearing bands of wedlock.— The only consolation the disconsolate Amazar had, was in the glooms of retirement, caressing little smiling Zai, the sole pledge of that pure love he had borne the amiable Hasora.</P>
<P>Zai had now seen seven summers, his lovely visage and engaging ways made him the delight of every who frequented his father's house. But let us now reverse the leaf. Behold the youth (when the cold hand of Death consigned the ten∣der parent to the grave) possessed of those riches
<PB N="77" REF="74"/>
which the hand of Frugality had gathered, to keep him independent of mankind. The pro∣mising hope of the respected—Amazar now spends his whole time in the company of Is∣maen, the gambler. See! see! how quickly he empties the foaming goblet of intoxication. Are those pale lips the once rosy ones of Zai, which were so often wont to kiss the cooling cup of lime-juice and water?—Yes, Heaven, they are!—But what a metamorphosis!</P>
<P>Zai's constitution was soon broke, his money as soon spent. What could he do? He ran in debt to support nature, and his merciless creditor thrust him in the dismal confines of a prison, where he expired a victim to his inordinate de∣sires.</P>

APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>IN the north of Ireland I met with a gentleman to whose good nature I am indebted for a copy of the following Poem; it is the production of the late Rev. William Pilkington, Curate of Omagh, capital of the county of Tyrone. This genius is reputed to have been a son of Dean Swift's, by the celebrated Mrs. Laetitia Pilkinton. I am told he was the exact image of Swift, and a man whose abi∣lities were universally acknowledged; his satiric talent, which was very great, procured him high disrespect from the brethren of the gown: he was a graceful and eloquent preacher, but not a very rigid observer of the doctrine he preached.
<PB N="82" REF="77"/>
The burden of a large family, with the attendant anxieties and cares, extremely depressed the ge∣nerous spirit of this pleasing companion. Think∣ing to drown the memory of his afflictions, he frequented Bacchanalian societies, and latterly drank strong liquors when alone; this, at length, put a period to his existence: he expired, in a manner truly pitiable, a deplorable spectacle of ungovernable passion.</P>

<L>I WONDER, Sir, for what intent,</L>
<L>My master me a present sent;</L>
<L>To one whom he assur'dly knew</L>
<L>Had neither call for cork or screw,</L>
<L><PB N="84" REF="79"/>Whose pittance scarce three times a year,</L>
<L>Affords small brewings of bad beer;</L>
<L>For which, so rare, you bottles ask,</L>

<L>A splendid sideboard still I grac'd,</L>

<L>My sphere is fellowship and drinking;</L>

<L>If you in fact, good Screw, possess</L>
<L>Such pow'r to make affliction less,</L>
<L>No person stands in greater need,</L>
<L>Of all thy friendship, help, or aid;</L>
<L>But why did you so long conceal</L>
<L>Specifics, which can sorrow heal?</L>
<L>Or yet perhaps, you may contrive</L>
<L>Some means to keep a wretch alive.</L>

<L>Keep you alive? No! you deserve,</L>

<L>My former beauties I deplore;</L>
<L><PB N="86" REF="81"/>My outside which, like mirror shone,</L>

<SPEAKER>CURATE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why I must own, since you were mine</L>
<L>You seldom dip'd your nib in wine,</L>
<L>My scanty pittance can't afford,</L>
<L>The sparkling glass or splendid board;</L>
<L>Yet you from harm I'd still protect,</L>

<L>At least all men of common sense;</L>
<L>Proctors I mean, who're men of merit,</L>
<L>Ye Curates want soul, sense, and spirit;</L>
<L>For 'gainst the rosy God we've reason,</L>
<L>T' accuse your Reverences of treason;</L>
<L>First I detest your smoaky cot,</L>
<L>Where all things rust with damps and rot;</L>
<L>No elegance your chambers grace,</L>

<L>Your frugal table next I hate,</L>
