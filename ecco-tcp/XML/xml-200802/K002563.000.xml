<L><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HERE proud <HI>Augusta,</HI> Empire of the Great,</L>
<L>Sees a whole World pay Tribute at her Feet,</L>
<L>Where social Pleasure, with indulgent Sway,</L>
<L>Chears ev'ry Breast, and bids e'en <HI>Want</HI> be gay,</L>
<L>The Muse beginsâ€”Ye <HI>British</HI> Fair-Ones, smile;</L>
<L>So shall your Favours recompense my Toil;</L>
<L>So shall Mankind the Ear attentive lend,</L>
<L>Since All the World admires what You commend.</L>

<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<L>FOR You, kind Nature shifts the restless Year,</L>
<L>And varying Seasons roll, to bless the Fair:</L>
<L>To charm your Footsteps thro' the winding Maze,</L>
<L>Unfolding Spring a thousand Sweets displays:</L>
<L>For You, with genial Heat the Summer glows,</L>
<L>Smiles in the Fields, and blushes in the Rose:</L>
<L>Autumnal Suns, to gratify your Taste,</L>
<L>With Fruits and Plenty crown the long Repast:</L>
<L>And shiv'ring Winter charms no less than these,</L>
<L>If Change of Joys can boast the Pow'r to please.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tir'd with the mid-day Heat, and Ev'ning Gale,</L>
<L>The wide-stretch'd Prospect, and the flow'ry Vale,</L>
<L>The bubbling Fountain, and the Linnet's Song,</L>
<L>(For who can bear e'en <HI>Harmony</HI> too long?)</L>
<L><HI>Cynthia,</HI> the Passion of contending Swains,</L>
<L>Flies to the Town, and leaves the sylvan Scenes.</L>
<L>Unhappy Scenes! the Birds forgot to sing,</L>
<L>And Nature mourn'd her, till returning Spring.</L>

<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
<L>Ye airy Sylphs, who hover round the Fair,</L>
<L>With Aid invisible, but always near,</L>
<L>Assist your Poet, while his daring Muse</L>
<L>Sings the Diversions that the Nymph pursues,</L>
<L>When frozen Streams in lazy Currents run,</L>
<L>And the big Cloud, portentous, hides the Sun.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See sullen Night with tardy Step retires,</L>
<L>And in the Lamp the glimm'ring Flame expires.</L>
<L>On Roofs of Snow reflected Sun-Beams play,</L>
<L>And early Business fills the strait'ned Way.</L>
<L>With Cries of diff'rent Note resounds the Street,</L>
<L>And Coaches roll, and jostling Carmen meet.</L>
<L>On his deep-furrow'd Brow the Broker wears</L>
<L>Schemes yet in Embryo, and unwieldy Cares;</L>
<L>While the grave Doctor, from the Tumult free,</L>
<L>Lolls in his Chariot, and expects the Fee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Fair still slept, while Sleep, to Fair-Ones kind,</L>
<L>Bid visionary Scenes divert her Mind;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="6"/>
Where shone the Circles of the Great and Gay,</L>
<L>Who shar'd the Dance, and pass'd the Hours at Play;</L>
<L>Where, arm'd with Gallantry, the well-dress'd Beau,</L>
<L>In Slumber, bid the Cheek with Blushes glow;</L>
<L>Till early Footmen, with untimely Noise,</L>
<L>And op'ning Lap-Dogs, interrupt her Joys;</L>
<L>Then fled the airy Sweets of calm Repose,</L>
<L>And the unwilling Maid with Sighs arose,</L>
<L>Perus'd the Morning's Billet-doux with Care,</L>
<L>And, next, to Beauty's Queen preferr'd her Pray'r.</L>
<L>"Oh Thou, whose Pow'r supreme, and gentle Sway,</L>
<L>"Not Mortals only, but the <HI>Gods,</HI> obey,</L>
<L>"Celestial <HI>Venus,</HI> Guardian of the Fair,</L>
<L>"Who lives unheeded, if without thy Care;</L>
<L>"Still may Mankind thy sov'reign Rule adore,</L>
<L>"And Altars blaze, till Time shall be no more!</L>
<L>"But Oh! with full Success my Wishes crown,</L>
<L>"Long may I reign the Fav'rite of the Town;</L>
<L>"Long may I boast th' unrivall'd Pow'r to <HI>kill;</HI></L>
<L>"Joy more than <HI>Life,</HI> belov'd beyond <HI>Quadrille!</HI></L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="7"/>
"With ev'ry Grace my faultless Form supply,</L>
<L>"Till Prudes in secret rack'd with Envy die.</L>
<L>"And when I wed (if such the Will of Fate)</L>
<L>"May no learn'd Pedant be my future Mate;</L>
<L>"No Wretch, who Gold prefers to Joys like thine,</L>
<L>"Nor Sot, enamour'd with the Fumes of Wine.</L>
<L>"All Cares, but Love, with Pleasure I forego,</L>
<L>"And all my Wishes centre in a Beau."</L>
<L>So pray'd, nor vainly, the Heart-conqu'ring Fair,</L>
<L>Love's Goddess list'ned, and approv'd the Pray'r:</L>
<L>Then bid, t' adorn the Nymph, each smiling Grace</L>
<L>With more than mortal Beauty arm her Face,</L>
<L>Call forth the latent Mischiefs of her Eyes,</L>
<L>And give the Blush that with the Morning vies.</L>
<L>To crown the Whole, inventive Fancy came,</L>
<L>And with the Pow'r of Dress improv'd the Dame;</L>
<L>From ev'ry Clime some gaudy Tribute bore,</L>
<L>And deck'd her with the Spoils of <HI>India</HI>'s Shore;</L>
<L>While Fashion, as the Ocean unconfin'd,</L>
<L>Dispos'd each Charm to captivate the Mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<L>And now with warmer Pow'r the Sun-Beams glow,</L>
<L>And Kennels widen with dissolving Snow,</L>
<L>In ev'ry Street officious Shoe-Boys ply,</L>
<L>And meagre Poverty prefers its Cry.</L>
<L>Touch'd with the Ills that wait on pining Woe,</L>
<L>With lib'ral Hand their Alms the Good bestow;</L>
<L>E'en <HI>Av'rice</HI> stops, affected with the Sight,</L>
<L>And, e'er he cheats the Orphan, gives his Mite.</L>
<L>'Tis Noon, and Business dwells in ev'ry Face,</L>
<L>Directs the Eye, and animates the Pace:</L>
<L>Big with the Prospect of some future Gain,</L>
<L>The Merchant's Haste, nor Winds, nor Show'rs detain;</L>
<L>With unloop'd Hat he dares th' inclement Day,</L>
<L>Nor heeds the dashing Spout, or miry Way.</L>
<L>So, bent on Riches, on th' unfriendly Waves,</L>
<L>Impending Death the bold Advent'rer braves;</L>
<L>Bears <HI>India</HI>'s scorching Suns, and <HI>Zembla</HI>'s Cold,</L>
<L>And mocks all Dangers, for the Charms of Gold.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Ludgate-Hill</HI> with rattling Coaches swarms,</L>
<L>And thro' the Sash the gaudy Tissue charms.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="9"/>
Here croud <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Pride, intent t' express</L>
<L>The Pow'r of Fancy, by their Skill in Dress.</L>
<L>Vers'd in the Rhet'rick that supports his Trade,</L>
<L>The smooth-tongu'd Mercer shews the rich Brocade;</L>
<L>Expatiates on the Labours of the Loom,</L>
<L>And sells, for Foreign, Patterns wrought at Home:</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the Whole, in Hesitation lost,</L>
<L>The Nymph stands doubtful which she fancies most;</L>
<L>Till, struck by something New, she buys at last,</L>
<L>Pays the full Price, and glories in her Taste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor with less Judgment, or inferior Grace,</L>
<L>The artful Milaner harangues on Lace;</L>
<L>Describes each Fashion that allures the Eye,</L>
<L>The Mobb <HI>Venetian,</HI> Quoif, or airy Fly;</L>
<L>What Ribbands suit the Fresh, and what the Wan,</L>
<L>And dwells upon the Colours of a Fan;</L>
<L>Improves each Hint, and hangs on ev'ry Tale,</L>
<L>And keeps Discourse alive, with Lungs that never fail.</L>
<L>Is there a Poet, whose capacious Rhimes</L>
<L>Can range distinct the Fashions of the Times?</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="10"/>
Where-e'er he dwells, ye Muses, round him shine;</L>
<L>A Task so arduous calls for all the Nine.</L>
<L>His let it be, to sing, in lofty Lays,</L>
<L>The Hoop's wide Circle, and the Diamond's Blaze,</L>
<L>Paint the gay Ornaments that deck the Fair,</L>
<L>And praise the wavy Ringlets of her Hair.</L>
<L>But Time rolls on, impatient of Delay,</L>
<L>And Hunger sends the Citizen away:</L>
<L>To Halls well-furnish'd Liv'rymen repair,</L>
<L>And feast, in Fancy, on the Bill of Fare:</L>
<L>Calmly they drown th' eternal Feuds of State,</L>
<L>And bid e'en Business till To-morrow wait.</L>
<L>Homeward, returning see the blooming Fair,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with her Bargains, and devoid of Care;</L>
<L>No gloomy Thought her peaceful Mind annoys,</L>
<L>Nor Spleen malevolent disturbs her Joys;</L>
<L>In the gay Chariot rais'd, she rolls along,</L>
<L>Safe from the Hardships that affect the Throng;</L>
<L>Exults amidst the Rigours of the Day,</L>
<L>And hears the whistling Tempest round her play.</L>
<L>The witless Fop, unheedful of the Storm,</L>
<L>Stands fixt, and wonders at th' angelic Form;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="11"/>
Ling'ring, looks back, in Admiration lost,</L>
<L>Nor gains his Senses, till he meets a Post.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So, on the faithless Waves, the Syren-Train,</L>
<L>With melting Airs the Mariner detain;</L>
<L>Heedless, he sails along the dang'rous Seas,</L>
<L>Enchanted with the Music of their Lays,</L>
<L>Till, bulg'd upon some Rock, he mourns too late</L>
<L>His Stay, and yields unwillingly to Fate.</L>
<L>Now Plenty triumphs o'er the genial Board,</L>
<L>And grateful Wines a gen'rous Warmth afford;</L>
<L>While Mirth, Effect of Innocence, prevails,</L>
<L>And wakes the social Laugh with well-told Tales;</L>
<L>Lively in Years, perhaps, historic Age</L>
<L>With <HI>Britain</HI>'s Glories past their Thoughts engage;</L>

<L>Then paints the Joys that wait on <HI>Brunswick</HI>'s Name,</L>

<L>Hence shall our Sons, when long in future Days,</L>

Rouz'd at the Mem'ry of <HI>Rebellion</HI> vile,</L>

<L>To conquer Faction, and to humble <HI>France!</HI></L>
<L>How <HI>William</HI> (glorious Name!) the Traitors drove!</L>
<L>His Cause, our Country, and his Guardian <HI>Jove.</HI></L>
<L>But softer Things the Female Band amuse,</L>
<L>Than Wars, Ambition, Politics, and News;</L>
<L>To hardier Breasts they trust the Martial Toil;</L>
<L>Kill with a Frown, and conquer with a Smile.</L>
<L>Theirs is the Task o'er Fashions to preside,</L>
<L>And fix the changing Ornaments of Pride;</L>
<L>Recount the Arts that captivate the Mind,</L>
<L>Subdue th' Inconstant, and attract the Blind;</L>
<L>Safe in their Charms, admire the well-form'd Plan,</L>
<L>And join their Sex's Pow'r, to conquer Man.</L>
<L>Subjects so copious ask a longer Day,</L>
<L>And Themes so fruitful wear the Hours away:</L>
<L>But Pleasure calls, and Scenes instructive glow,</L>
<L>With all the mournful Eloquence of Woe;</L>
<L><HI>Monimia,</HI> fainting, on <HI>Castalio</HI> cries,</L>
<L>And sad <HI>Arpasia</HI> with <HI>Moneses</HI> dies.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="13"/>
Mad as the Sea, <HI>Othello</HI> raves, distrest;</L>
<L>And Patriot-Zeal inspires a <HI>Cato</HI>'s Breast:</L>
<L>Here wild Ambition mourns her tott'ring State,</L>
<L>And Envy sickens at the Tyrant's Fate;</L>
<L>There sorrowing Virtue pains the gen'rous Mind,</L>
<L>And Love, unpity'd, bids the Fair be kind.</L>
<L>These were the Arts, that pleas'd a former Age,</L>
<L>When <HI>Booth,</HI> majestic, grac'd <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Stage;</L>
<L>When <HI>Oldfield,</HI> skill'd to paint distressful Woe,</L>
<L>Bid marble Breasts with fond Compassion glow:</L>
<L>And still they flourish, still the Town may boast</L>
<L>Names not inferior e'en to those it lost;</L>
<L><HI>Garrick,</HI> each Passion that he feigns, can move,</L>
<L>And <HI>Cibber</HI> softens all the Soul to Love:</L>
<L>In these survives what matchless <HI>Shakespear</HI> writ,</L>
<L>And still the World admires a <HI>Congreve</HI>'s Wit.</L>
<L>The youthful Hero views th' inspiring Scenes,</L>
<L>And martial Ardour kindles in his Veins;</L>
<L>While the fond Virgin, on the Brink of Fate,</L>
<L>Warn'd by <HI>Calista,</HI> shuns the dang'rous Bait.</L>
<L>Ye modern Wits, who, emulous of Fame,</L>
<L>Build, on the Comic Scene, the deathless Name,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="14"/>
Would ye excell? With strictest Care restrain</L>
<L>The Jest immodest, and the Phrase prophane;</L>
<L>So shall the gen'ral Shout your Toil repay,</L>
<L>And <HI>Britain</HI>'s Fair attend the Poet's Day;</L>
<L>The moral Tale shall please the virtuous Youth,</L>
<L>And <HI>Guilt</HI> alone shall redden at the Truth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, chearful, Winter-Ev'nings roll away,</L>
<L>And gay Diversions crown the short'ned Day:</L>
<L>Joys, yet unsung, t' amuse the Fair remain,</L>
<L>And Skies inclement spend their Rage in vain:</L>
