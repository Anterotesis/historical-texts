<HEAD>PROLOGUE, Written and Spoken by Mr. GENTLEMAN.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><HI>BEN JOHNSON</HI>'s name, in ev'ry ear of taste,</L>
<L>Must with respect, and countenance be graced;</L>
<L>No pen the lines of nature better drew,</L>
<L>No wit or satire ever higher flew;</L>
<L>An early pillar of the English stage,</L>
<L>His pieces were true pictures of the age;</L>
<L>Time-worn they feel impair—yet still must please.</L>
<L>Nervous and just, though void of modern ease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fashions, in characters as well as cloaths,</L>
<L>Change, though less oft, as wav'ring fancy flows;</L>
<L>Witches and fairies with their midnight train,</L>
<L>No longer revel on the blasted plain;</L>
<L>Now ev'ry simpleton of britain's isle,</L>
<L>At such a fraud as <HI>Alchymy</HI> would smile;</L>
<L>Yet being only chang'd in name and shapes,</L>
<L>Scarce one in ten the gilded bait escapes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Haste to the hall where law is sold like ware,</L>
<L>How many long rob'd alchymsts ply there;</L>
<L>What hopes to gudgeon clients they unfold,</L>
<L>While empty quibbles turn to solid gold;</L>
<L>See swarming quacks!—so public folly wills</L>
<L>Convert to gold their health-destroying pills</L>
<L>Change Alley view—that scene of transmutation</L>
<L>That base alchemic bubble of the nation;</L>
<L>See beauty's self resign its brightest charms</L>
<L>And turn to gold in age's frozen arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="4"/>
<L>Search all the world, examine ev'ry part;</L>
<L>You'll find each man an alchymist at heart</L>
<L>In ev'ry clime we find, if truth be told</L>
<L>The universal deity is gold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whate'er of merit you perceive this night,</L>
<L>Grant your old bard as his undoubted right</L>
<L>My brain has laboured—feebly I confess,</L>
<L>Only to furnish a more modern dress.</L>
<L>My weak endeavours let your candor raise,</L>
<L>They hope indulgence, though they reach not praise.</L>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AS the PROLOGUE has, in part, apologized for this alteration from BEN JOHNSON, nothing more need be added, but that it was meant to give Mr. WESTON's established merit in the character of <HI>Abel Drugger,</HI> more frequent, familiar, and com∣pact opportunity of shewing itself, than the Old Play can possibly afford; upon comparison, it will be found, that very little of the original is retained, but a general idea, and the part of <HI>Abel Drugger,</HI> to which however, some additions have been made.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE I.</HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> SUBTLE, <HI>followed by</HI> FACE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>NAY, nay, though thy name be Face, and thou hadst a face of brass, thou shalt not out-face me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then must I be unable to handle a most excel∣lent subject; tho' shame and thee have long since parted, I will so anatomize that calf's head of thine.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Calf's head! Blood of my life, I have a mind to mark my resentment in such legible characters up∣on that Tyburn visage of thine, as will put thy features in mourning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come on then, see whose stomach will bear brui∣sing best; I'll tickle those pampered sides.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>A poor, ignorant, impertinent, ungrateful wretch; whose life, to my disgrace be it spoken, I have saved—vile emblem of an empty cask, much sound, no contents, canst thou forget the mouldy crusts, Suffolk cheese, and dead small beer, on which thou wert starving in common with bare-ribbed rats and limping mice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mighty well, mighty well, master Subtle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have I not made thee an occasional captain, am I not filling thy pockets as well as thy belly; have I not taught thee, dull as thou art, to con∣verse with, and impose on various degrees of man∣kind? have I not from the stupidest slave that ever marred common sense sharpened thy wit, smoothed thy tongue, polished thy manners, regulated thy features, to make thee capable of thriving in life, and this treatment, my hopeful recompence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so fast, not so fast, master glib-tongue, give eccho fair play—I do indeed confess myself indebted to thee for being a thriving pupil in the noble sci∣ence of knavery, of which I admit thee an able professor; but as motives constitute, or destroy ob∣ligation, I ask what were thine? to strengthen and further thy own iniquitous designs; and if thou
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
talk'st of favour I can bring a powerful balance on my side, to silence your modest worship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>With contempt I defy thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, then my tongue shall so buffet thee, that thou shalt think half Billingsgate, the seat of thy education, let loose about thy ears, and shrink back that knave's face of thine like a snail into its shell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mighty fine!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Remember St. Giles's Scape-grace where I found thee a compleat emblem of poverty, resembling the fruit of a gibbet seven years exposed to wind and weather, not a coat to thy back, a stocking to thy legs, nor a shoe to thy feet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, go on sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I not find thee tatterdemallion with a beard two inches long, not having wherewithal to pay a penny barber; squallid cheeks, furrowed brows, sunk eyes, and chattering teeth, crawling by the doors of cook-shops, to feed upon the steam of baked ox heads and shins of beef.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tremble audacious villian at thy insolence—fear my rage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I not put thee into some liking, snatch thee from Jane Shore's fate, and when thou had'st not as much linen about thee as would furnish a tinder box, did I not like a guardian genius bring thee to this house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes thy master's house, which, like a hungry mastiff, thou wast left to guard, and for a single bone would have let in any thief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I not enable thee to carry on the deceptions of alchymy, fortune telling, and algebra; your minerals, your vegetals, and animals, to fleece the credulous vulgar; have not I provided you with conjuror's robes, stills, glasses, furnaces, coals, and all other materials, to carry on thy profitable farce? answer me knave have I not done all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>And answer me miscreant, hast thou not thy share of the plunder? sirrah thou art as craving and unthankful as a Bumbailiff.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>And thou, poltroon, as tricking as a Jewish Stock-Broker, or an <HI>Old Bailey</HI> Solicitor.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Tricksy.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tric.</SPEAKER>
<P>How now my masters, I thought high words struck my ears; say what churlish point blows the
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
wind from, to make such a gloomy appearance of foul weather?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Slave, there is no name vile enough for thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Call me any thing but Subtle, and I care not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tric.</SPEAKER>
<P>What tantrums are these I trow? I find my ears were right, some fiend has spread this mischief be∣tween ye, why ye look as black at each other as a dark Christmass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>The dog is more hateful to me than cheese.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>And thou to me more detestable than the ful∣some steam of a tallow-chandler's work-shop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tric.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame, talk not so loud, you will discover yourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>I care not, welcome pillory, or cart, so that varlet has his share.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Content, so thou art cropped, or hanged, first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey day, hey day, if you are for that sport have among ye; I must raise my voice too, then look to it; why you couple of paltry, pimping, petulant knaves cant we comfortably share gains and be
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
quiet, cant we make fools without being such our∣selves; what bring our golden scheme to so fair a prospect, and let it, according to your jargon, va∣nish in fumo—the old dispute revived, I suppose, about honesty, when you know in your consciences that there is not a grain in either of you, or if there was, you would starve by it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it is all his fault Doll.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>I deny it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tric.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis both your faults, you tinder temper'd knaves; you sputter at one another, and yet have as little courage as honesty, I know your high words and big looks, you spend your lungs to bawl, and strain your limbs to stride, without any meaning; what, am I a partner in all your undertakings, your impostures, and shall I waste my wit for nothing; must I encourage fools of various shapes, and assume as many different characters as Mr. What d' ye Callum, Protus, to forward your designs, that they may be blown up by idle passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take breath Doll—take breath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take breath, 'ads my life, shake hands, live peacea∣bly and cheat industriously, or tremble at my ven∣geance, I'll blow ye—get a genteel reward for ap∣prehending such notorious bites; turn honest my∣self,
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
and make those necks and ears you talk so light∣ly of, tremble at the approach of wooden and hempen collars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let him leave off grumbling like a bear, that he has the heaviest part of our plan to exe∣cute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I have; above one half the work, yet not above a third of the profit, besides ill language.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tric.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who begins it, old snarler, don't we perform the parts allotted us chearfully; if your's exceeds to-day, our's may match it to-morrow, s'death I have a good mind to pull you by the nose for this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay but dear Doll—Doll the soft—Doll the gentle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tric.</SPEAKER>
<P>No wheedling, Mr. Morose, but swear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>What wouldst thou have me swear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tric.</SPEAKER>
<P>To leave idle disputation and high words, for industry in promoting our common cause, this will best become you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>By my hopes I meant no other; what I said was only to spur him up a little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay but your spurs gall worse than those of a wild London apprentice, hack-mounted, to take the air on a sunday; they would make even the numbed sides of a sand ass shrink.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, no more, we want no whipping, nor spurring, take hands—no frowns but cordiality; I proclaim a peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which for thy sake, fair mediatrix, I will keep religiously.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tric.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll have no, no, Frenchified professions, fair faces with designing hearts—for my sake! keep the compact for your own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wench of spirit, we will, and when we have stuffed our paunches, which, before our master returns we certainly shall, as a reward for thy pains thou shalt be lady Face, or lady Subtle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry, come up I trow—a wonderful catch—suppose I should be neither, but of that hereafter is it not near the hour, when that Prince of simpli∣city, my sweet swain, the Tobaconist, is to be here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, Face be thou in the way, to meet and con∣duct him to an audience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fear not, I'll play the gudgeon with an angler's skill.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Doll, thou hast almost as many admirers as Hellen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Admirers! if the frames were not gilded, the pictures would be intolerable; as for instance Abel Drugger, whose formality of phiz, and shallow∣ness of scull, might for a few visits make even mel∣ancholly smile; then my slink-haired methodist preacher, Bawlwell, who wooes me in the stile of a saint, to make me in reality a devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! well said little volatile.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Third that cumbersome repository of lewd thoughts, Sir Epicure, who batters my ears with such pomposity of phrase, that I should always have a dictionary at hand to understand him; he is, for mouthing, the puff'd up cryer of Cupid's court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is indeed a rich subject for imposition; good wench, thou art to us as a conjuror's shew cloth to
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>
draw in the gaping croud; most of the sheep are penned by thee, and we fleece them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes that you do pretty handsomely—but of all my numerous gallants I am most troubled with Headlong, the betting, boxing blade, and often fancy I stand in danger of feeling personally, by way of joke, the dexterity of his fists.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush! I hear somebody coming;—retire till occasion demands thy presence; and above all re∣member the feigned madness I have taught thee, for thy next interview with Sir Epicure—much de∣pends on that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fear not—he shall think me fresh slipped from the region of Moorfields.
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now for suitable importance of look, and essen∣tial obscurity of phrase; by which the prudent are sometimes, and the foolish are always taken in.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> FACE, <HI>with</HI> ABEL DRUGGER.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>There he is—the wonder of the world—past, present, and to come, are as familiar to him as thou art with thy own face; there's not a fixed Planet, nor even a wandering star, beyond his knowledge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A. Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>May hap so—then he must have a power of ac∣quaintances—I should not remember half of them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>You!—comparisons are—but mum—he turns upon us.</P>

<P>I hope it was a north star—they say that's lucki∣est now.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou hast an illustrious set of features.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A. Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes very lustrous—mother used to call me her bright baby Abel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—now for business—I know thy thoughts yet require thy own explanation—what wouldst thou have with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A. Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>This an please your wise worship—I am a young beginner, and am building a new shop, if it likes your reverence—it is just at the corner of a street—here's the plot on't; and I would know, by art sir, of your venerableship which way I should make my door by necromany, and where to place my boxes, where my shelves, and where my pots—I should be glad to thrive—I was wished to you by Captain Face here, my very good friend, who says that you known men's planets and their good Angels and their bad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>He tells you a most solemn truth, I do know them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A. Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray you Captain speak for me to Master Doc∣tor, his wisdom has taken both my courage and breath away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I'll be thy spokesman—Doctor this is my friend; his name Abel—a very honest fel∣low.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes very honest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>And no Goldsmith.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="13" REF="18"/>
<SPEAKER>A Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no Goldsmith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>And as I have already hinted very fortunate—at which allow me to rejoice—soft—metaposcopy informs me that your chesnut, or olive coloured hair does never fail; besides your long ears promise extremely well—you were born on Wednesday.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A. Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good now—by my truly and so I was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not this astonishing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>The thumb in chiromancy we give to Venus—the fore finger to Jove, the midst to Saturn, the ring to Sol, the least to Mercury.—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>(While</HI> Subtle <HI>is examining</HI> Drugger's <HI>fingers, he steals off a ring.)</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A. Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, and you give them all away, I shall have none for myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not this strange.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A. Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes truly, very strange.—<HI>Missing his Ring.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now for attention—this is thy house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A. Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>And these are your two sides.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>So they are indeed sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mark me then—make your door here in the south, your broad side west, and to the east side of your shop write in fair golden letters these words, <HI>Mathlai, Tarmael, Baraborat.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A. Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Matlay, turnmill, boreabrat,</HI> what may that be in English, an like your wise worship?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(aside)</STAGE>
Mum there; plain English would ruin all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon the north side inscribe <HI>Thael velil thiel.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A. Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Rael velil thiel.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those are the names of such mercurial spirits as fright flies from boxes, cobwebs from shelves, and vermin from thy cupboards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A. Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray you sir write down these charms, for I have but a sieve-like memory—all runs though.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fear not, I'll strengthen thy recollection, and give thee, for I like thy countenance, such other assistance as will make thee stand a fair chance to
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>
possess that source of boundless riches, the philoso∣pher's stone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hearst thou that little Nab.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A. Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, I do, good captain—what must I give the Doctor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give him—consider thou art a made man—thou can'st not possibly give less than—but hold, that you may try his wisdom a little closer, ask him about any particular circumstance that happened some time since—see if he can tell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A. Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll do't—with your worship's good favour, I would ask what happened to me last Martinmass day was twelvemonth, at night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see thou doubt'st my skill—but I'll indulge thee, Aries, Taurus, Virgo, Sagittarius, Capri∣cornus, whisper in my ear the event I am questioned upon.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>A. Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are all these brother conjurors he's talking to?</P>

I pitied him, but now, as lady Fanny Flirtem says, if an army of lovers was before me, with pistols at their ears, daggers at their breasts, running nooses round their necks, or poi∣son at their mouths, I could look on with the most immoveable composure, the true unfeeling fashion∣able indifference.</P>
