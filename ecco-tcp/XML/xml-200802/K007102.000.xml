<HEAD>THE LIFE OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH, M.B.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In these Memoirs, which were published in London, soon after the death of Dr. Goldsmith, were several mistakes, with re∣spect to our author's age, the time of his admission into the col∣lege of Dublin, &amp;c. which are here corrected from accurate in∣formation.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>OLIVER GOLDSMITH, son of the Reverend Charles Goldsmith, was born at Elphin, in the county of Roscommon in Ireland, in the year 1729. His fa∣ther had four sons, of whom Oliver was the third. After being well instructed in the classics, at the school of Mr. Hughes, he was admitted a sizer in
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
Trinity-college, Dublin, on the 11th of June, 1744. While he resided there, he exhibited no specimens of that genius, which, in his maturer years, raised his character so high. On the 27th of February, 1749, O. S. (two years after the regular time) he obtained the degree of Bachelor of Arts. Soon after, he turned his thoughts to the profession of physic; and, after attending some courses of anatomy in Dublin, proceeded to Edinburgh, in the year 1751, where he studied the several branches of medicine un∣der the different professors in that university. His beneficent disposition soon involved him in unex∣pected difficulties; and he was obliged precipitately to leave Scotland, in consequence of having engaged himself to pay a considerable sum of money for a fel∣low-student.</P>
<P>A FEW days after, about the beginning of the year 1754, he arrived at Sunderland, near Newcastle, where he was arrested at the suit of one Barclay, a taylor in Edinburgh, to whom he had given security for his friend. By the friendship of Mr. Laughlin Maclane and Dr. Sleigh, who were then in the col∣lege, he was soon delivered out of the hands of the bailiff, and took his passage on board a Dutch ship to Rotterdam, where, after a short stay, he proceeded to Brussels. He then visited great part of Flanders; and, after passing some time at Strasbourg and Lou∣vain, where he obtained a degree of Bachelor in phy∣sic, he accompanied an English gentleman to Geneva.</P>
<P>IT is undoubtedly fact, that this ingenious, un∣fortunate man made most part of his tour on

A man who is whirled through Europe in a post∣chaise, and the pilgrim who walks the grand tour on foot, will form very different conclusions. <HI>Haud inexpertus loquor.</HI>" <BIBL>Goldsmith<HI>'s Present State of Learning in Europe,</HI> 1759.</BIBL></Q></P></NOTE> He had left England with very little mo∣ney; and, being of a philosophical turn, and at that time possessing a body capable of sustaining every fa∣tigue, and a heart not easily terrified by danger, he be∣came an enthusiast to the design he had formed of see∣ing the manners of different countries. He had some knowledge of the French language, and of music; he played tolerably well on the German flute; which, from an amusement, became at some times the means of subsistence. His learning produced him an hospi∣table reception at most of the religious houses that he visited; and his music made him welcome to the pea∣sants of Flanders and Germany. <Q REND="inline">'Whenever I ap∣proached a peasant's house towards night-fall,'</Q> he used to say, <Q REND="inline">'I played one of my most merry tunes, and that generally procured me not only a lodging, but sub∣sistence for the next day: but <HI>in truth</HI>'</Q> (his constant ex∣pression) <Q REND="inline">'I must own, whenever I attempted to en∣tertain persons of a higher rank, they always thought my performance odious, and never made me any return for my endeavours to please them.'</Q></P>
<P>ON his arrival at Geneva, he was recommended as a proper person for a travelling tutor to a young man, who had been unexpectedly left a considerable sum of money by his uncle Mr. S******. This youth, who was articled to an attorney, on receipt of his fortune determined to see the world; and, on his engaging with his preceptor, made a proviso, that he
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
should be permitted to govern himself: and our travel∣ler soon found his pupil understood the art of direct∣ing in money concerns extremely well, as avarice was his prevailing passion.</P>
<P>DURING Goldsmith's continuance in Switzerland, he assiduously cultivated his poetical talent, of which he had given some striking proofs at the college of Edinburgh. It was from hence he sent the first sketch of his delightful epistle, called the <HI>Traveller,</HI> to his brother Henry, a clergyman in Ireland.</P>
<P>FROM Geneva Mr. Goldsmith and his pupil pro∣ceeded to the south of France, where the young man, upon some disagreement with his preceptor, paid him the small part of his salary which was due, and embarked at Marseilles for England. Our wanderer was left once more upon the world at large, and passed through a number of difficulties in traversing the greatest part of France. At length his curiosity being gratified, he bent his course towards England, and arrived at Dover, the beginning of the winter, in the year 1758.</P>
<P>HIS finances were so low on his return to Eng∣land, that he with difficulty got to the metropolis, his whole stock of cash amounting to no more than a few halfpence! An entire stranger in London, his mind was filled with the most gloomy reflections in conse∣quence of his embarrassed situation! He applied to se∣veral apothecaries in hopes of being received in the capacity of a journeyman, but his broad Irish accent, and the uncouthness of his appearance, occasioned him to meet with insult from most of the medicinal tribe. The next day, however, a chymist near Fish-street,
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>
struck with his forlorn condition, and the simplicity of his manner, took him into his laboratory, where he continued till he discovered that his old friend Dr. Sleigh was in London. That gentleman received him with the warmest affection, and liberally invited him to share his purse till some establishment could be pro∣cured for him. Goldsmith, unwilling to be a burden to his friend, a short time after eagerly embraced an offer which was made him to assist the late Rev. Dr. Milner, in instructing the young gentlemen at the Academy at Peckham; and acquitted himself greatly to the Doctor's satisfaction for a short time; but, hav∣ing obtained some reputation by the criticisms he had written in the Monthly Review, Mr. Griffith, the principal proprietor, engaged him in the compilation of it; and, resolving to pursue the profession of writ∣ing, he returned to London, as the mart where abili∣ties of every kind were sure of meeting distinction and reward. Here he determined to adopt a plan of the strictest oeconomy, and, at the close of the year 1759, took lodgings in Green-Arbour-court in the Old Bailey, where he wrote several ingenious pieces. The late Mr. Newbery, who, at that time gave great encouragement to men of literary abilities, became a kind of patron to our young author, and introduced him as one of the writers in the Public Ledger, in which his <HI>Citizen of the World</HI> originally appeared, un∣der the title of 'Chinese Letters.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">During this time, (according to another account) he wrote for the British Magazine, of which Dr. Smollet was then Editor, most of those <HI>Essays</HI> and <HI>Tales,</HI> which he afterwards collected and published in a separate volume. He also wrote occasionally, for the Critical Review; and it was the merit which he discovered in criticising a despicable translation of Ovid's <HI>Fasti</HI> by a pedantic school-master, and his <HI>Enquiry into the present state of learning in Europe,</HI> which first introduced him to the acquaintance of Dr. Smollet, who recommended him to several literati, and to most of the booksellers by whom he was afterwards patronized.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
FORTUNE now seemed to take some notice of a man she had long neglected. The simplicity of his character, the integrity of his heart, and the merit of his productions, made his company very acceptable to a number of respectable persons; and, about the mid∣dle of the year 1762, he emerged from his mean apartments near the Old Bailey to the politer air of the Temple, where he took handsome chambers, and lived in a genteel style. The publication of his <HI>Tra∣veller,</HI> his <HI>Vicar of Wakefield,</HI> and his <HI>History of Eng∣land,</HI> was followed by the performance of his comedy of <HI>the Good natured Man</HI> at Covent Garden theatre, and placed him in the first rank of the poets of the present age.</P>
<P>OUR Doctor, as he was now universally called, had a constant levee of his distrest countrymen, whose wants, as far as he was able, he always relieved; and he has been often known to leave himself even with∣out a guinea, in order to supply the necessities of others.</P>
<P>ANOTHER feature in his character we cannot help laying before the reader. Previous to the publication of his <HI>Deserted Village,</HI> the bookseller had given him a note for one hundred guineas for the copy, which the Doctor mentioned, a few hours after, to one of his friends, who observed it was a very great sum for so short a performance. <Q REND="inline">'In truth,'</Q> replied Goldsmith, <Q REND="inline">'I think so too, it is much more than the honest man can afford, or the piece is worth; I have not been
<PB N="vii" REF="9"/>
easy since I received it; I will therefore go back and return him his note:'</Q> which he actually did, and left it entirely to the bookseller to pay him according to the profits produced by the sale of the poem, which turned out very considerable.</P>
<P>DURING the last rehearsal of his comedy, intitled, <HI>She stoops to Conquer,</HI> which Mr. Coleman thought would not succeed, on the Doctor's objecting to the repetition of one of Tony Lumpkin's speeches, being apprehensive it might injure the play, the Manager, with great keenness replied, <Q REND="inline">'Psha, my dear Doctor, do not be fearful of <HI>squibs,</HI> when we have been sitting almost these two hours upon a <HI>barrel of gunpowder.</HI>'</Q> The piece, however, contrary to Mr. Coleman's ex∣pectation, was received with uncommon applause by the audience; and Goldsmith's pride was so hurt by the severity of the above observation, that it entirely put an end to his friendship for the gentleman who made it.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the great success of his pieces, by some of which, it is asserted, upon good authority, he cleared 1800 l. in one year, his cir∣cumstances were by no means in a prosperous situa∣tion! partly owing to the liberality of his dispositi∣on, and partly to an unfortunate habit he had con∣tracted of gaming, with the arts of which he was very little acquainted, and consequently became the prey of those who were unprincipled enough to take advantage of his ignorance.</P>
<P>JUST before his death he had formed a design for executing an universal dictionary of arts and sciences,
<PB N="viii" REF="10"/>
the <HI>prospectus</HI> of which he actually printed and distributed among his acquaintance. In this work se∣veral of his literary friends (particularly Sir Joshua Reynolds, Dr. Johnson, Mr. Beauclerc, and Mr. Gar∣rick) had promised to assist, and to furnish him with articles upon different subjects. He had entertained the most sanguine expectations from the success of it. The undertaking, however, did not meet with that encouragement from the booksellers which he had im∣agined it would undoubtedly receive; and he used to lament this circumstance almost to the last hour of his existence.</P>
<P>HE had been for some years afflicted, at different times, with a violent strangury, which contributed not a little to imbitter the latter part of his life; and which, united with the vexations he suffered upon other occasions, brought on a kind of habitual despondency. In this unhappy condition he was attacked by a nervous fever, which, being improperly treated, terminated in his dissolution on the 4th day of April, 1774, in the forty-fifth year of his age. His friends, who were very numerous and respecta∣ble, had determined to bury him in Westminster-ab∣bey, where a tablet was to have been erected to his memory. His pall was to have been supported by Lord Shelburne, Lord Louth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, the Hon. Mr. Beauclerc, Mr. Edmond Burke, and Mr. Garrick; but from some unaccountable circum∣stances this design was dropped, and his remains were privately deposited in the Temple burial-ground.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A subscription, however, has since been raised by his friends, to defray the expence of a marble monument which is now executed by Mr. Nollikens, an eminent Statuary in London, and is shortly to be placed in Westminster-abbey, with the follow∣ing inscription, written by Dr. Samuel Johnson.

<P><PB N="ix" REF="11"/>
AS to his character, it is strongly illustrated by Mr. Pope's line,
<Q><L>'In wit a man, simplicity a child.'</L></Q></P>
<P>THE learned leisure he loved to enjoy was too often interrupted by distresses which arose from the openness of his temper, and which sometimes threw him into loud fits of passion; but this impetuosity was corrected upon a moment's reflection, and his servants have been known, upon these occasions, purposely to throw themselves in his way, that they might profit by it immediately after; for he who had the good fortune to be reproved was certain of being rewarded for it. His disappointments at other times, made him peevish and sullen, and he has often left a party of convivial friends abruptly in the evening,
<PB N="x" REF="12"/>
in order to go home and brood over his misfor∣tunes.</P>
<P>THE universal esteem in which his poems are held, and the repeated pleasure they give in the peru∣sal, are striking proofs of their merit. He was a studious and correct observer of nature, happy in the selection of his images, in the choice of his subjects, and in the harmony of his versification; and, though his embarrassed situation prevented him from putting the last hand to many of his productions, his <HI>Her∣mit,</HI> his <HI>Traveller,</HI> and his <HI>Deserted Village,</HI> bid fair to claim a place among the most finished pieces in the English language.</P>
<P>AS different accounts have been given of this in∣genious man, the writer of <HI>these</HI> anecdotes cannot conclude without declaring, that they are all found∣ed upon facts, and collected by one who lived with him upon the most friendly footing for a great number of years, and who never felt any sorrow more sensibly than that which was occasioned by his death.</P>

<L>And save from infamy my sinking age.</L>
<L>Scarce half-alive, oppress'd with many a year,</L>

<L>SECLUDED from domestic strife,</L>

<L>O had the archer ne'er come down</L>
<L>To ravage in a country town!</L>
<L>Or Flavia been content to stop</L>
<L>At triumphs in a Fleet-street shop.</L>
<L>O had her eyes forgot to blaze!</L>
<L>Or Jack had wanted eyes to gaze.</L>
<L>O!—But let exclamation cease,</L>
<L>Her presence banish'd all his peace.</L>
<L>So with decorum all things carry'd;</L>
<L>Miss frown'd, and blush'd, and then was—married.</L>

<L>NEED we expose to vulgar sight,</L>
<L>The raptures of the bridal night?</L>
<L>Need we intrude on hallow'd ground,</L>

<L>Let it suffice, that each had charms;</L>

<L>A third, a fourth, were not amiss,</L>

<L>Found half the charms that deck'd her face,</L>

<L>Could any curtain lectures bring</L>

<HEAD>THE FOLLOWING LETTER, ADDRESSED TO THE PRINTER OF THE ST. JAMES'S CHRONICLE, Appeared in that Paper, in JUNE, 1767.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS there is nothing I dislike so much as news-paper controversy, particularly upon trifles, permit me to be as concise as possible in informing a correspondent of yours, that I recommended Blainville's Travels, be∣cause I thought the book was a good one; and I think so still. I said, I was told by the bookseller that it was then first published; but in that, it seems, I was misin∣formed, and my reading was not extensive enough to set me right.</P>
<P>Another correspondent of yours accuses me of hav∣ing taken a ballad, I published some time ago, from one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Friar of Orders Gray.—<HI>Reliq. of Anc. Poetry,</HI> vol. 1, p. 243.</NOTE> by the ingenious Mr. Percy. I do not think there is any great resemblance between the two pieces
<PB N="16" REF="26"/>
in question. If there be any, his ballad is taken from mine. I read it to Mr. Percy, some years ago; and he (as we both considered these things as trifles at best) told me, with his usual good humour, the next time I saw him, that he had taken my plan to form the frag∣ments of Shakespeare into a ballad of his own. He then read me his little Cento, if I may so call it, and I highly approved it. Such petty anecdotes as these are scarce worth printing: and, were it not for the busy disposition of some of your correspondents, the public should never have known that he owes me the hint of his ballad, or that I am obliged to his friendship and learning for communications of a much more important nature.</P>

<PB N="29" REF="38"/>
<HEAD>TO THE REV. HENRY GOLDSMITH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM sensible that the friendship between us can ac∣quire no new force from the ceremonies of a Dedica∣tion; and perhaps it demands an excuse thus to prefix your name to my attempts, which you decline giving with your own. But as a part of this Poem was for∣merly written to you from Switzerland, the whole can now, with propriety, be only inscribed to you. It will also throw a light upon many parts of it, when the reader understands, that it is addressed to a man, who, despising Fame and Fortune, has retired early to Happiness and Obscurity, with an income of forty pounds a year.</P>
<P>I now perceive, my dear brother, the wisdom of your humble choice. You have entered upon a sa∣cred office, where the harvest is great, and the la∣bourers are but few; while you have left the field of Ambition, where the labourers are many, and the harvest not worth carrying away. But of all kinds of ambition, what from the refinement of the times, from different systems of criticism, and from the
<PB N="30" REF="39"/>
divisions of party, that which pursues poetical fame is the wildest.</P>
<P>Poetry makes a principal amusement among unpo∣lished nations; but in a country verging to the ex∣tremes of refinement, Painting and Music come in for a share. As these offer the feeble mind a less labori∣ous entertainment, they at first rival Poetry, and at length supplant her; they engross all that favour once shewn to her, and though but younger sisters, seize upon the elder's birth-right.</P>
<P>Yet, however this art may be neglected by the powerful, it is still in greater danger from the mistaken efforts of the learned to improve it. What criticisms have we not heard of late in favour of blank verse, and Pindaric odes, chorusses, anapests and iambics, alliterative care and happy negligence! Every absur∣dity has now a champion to defend it, and as he is generally much in the wrong, so he has always much to say; for error is ever talkative.</P>
<P>But there is an enemy to this art still more danger∣ous, I mean Party. Party entirely distorts the judg∣ment, and destroys the taste. When the mind is once infected with this disease, it can only find pleasure in what contributes to increase the distemper. Like the tyger, that seldom desists from pursuing man after having once preyed upon human flesh, the reader, who has once gratified his appetite with calumny, makes, ever after, the most agreeable feast upon mur∣dered reputation. Such readers generally admire some half-witted thing, who wants to be thought a bold man, having lost the character of a wise one. Him they dignify with the name of poet; his tawdry
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
lampoons are called satires, his turbulence is said to be force, and his phrenzy fire.</P>
<P>What reception a Poem may find, which has nei∣ther abuse, party, nor blank verse to support it, I can∣not tell, nor am I solicitous to know. My aims are right. Without espousing the cause of any party, I have attempted to moderate the rage of all. I have endeavoured to shew, that there may be equal happi∣ness in states, that are differently governed from our own; that every state has a particular principle of happiness, and that this principle in each may be car∣ried to a mischievous excess. There are few can judge, better than yourself, how far these positions are illustrated in this Poem. I am,</P>

<L>But me, not destin'd such delights to share,</L>
<L>My prime of life in wand'ring spent and care:</L>
<L>Impell'd, with steps unceasing, to pursue</L>
<L>Some fleeting good, that mocks me with the view;</L>
<L>That, like the circle bounding earth and skies;</L>
<L>Allures from far, yet, as I follow, flies;</L>
<L>My fortune leads to traverse realms alone,</L>
<L>And find no spot of all the world my own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ev'n now, where Alpine solitudes ascend,</L>
<L>I sit me down a pensive hour to spend;</L>
<L>And, plac'd on high above the storm's career,</L>
<L>Look downward where an hundred realms appear;</L>
<L>Lakes, forests, cities, plains extending wide,</L>
<L>The pomp of kings, the shepherd's humbler pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When thus Creation's charms around combine,</L>
<L>Amidst the store, should thankless pride repine?</L>
<L>Say, should the philosophic mind disdain</L>
<L>That good, which makes each humbler bosom vain?</L>
<L>Let school-taught pride dissemble all it can,</L>
<L>These little things are great to little man;</L>
<L>And wiser he, whose sympathetic mind</L>
<L>Exults in all the good of all mankind.</L>
<L>Ye glitt'ring towns, with wealth and splendor crown'd,</L>
<L>Ye fields, where summer spreads profusion round,</L>
<L>Ye lakes, whose vessels catch the busy gale,</L>
<L>Ye bending swains, that dress the flow'ry vale,</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="43"/>
For me your tributary stores combine;</L>
<L>Creation's heir, the world, the world is mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As some lone miser visiting his store,</L>
<L>Bends at his treasure, counts, recounts it o'er;</L>
<L>Hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill,</L>
<L>Yet still he sighs, for hoards are wanting still:</L>
<L>Thus to my breast alternates passions rise,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with each good that heav'n to man supplies:</L>
<L>Yet oft a sigh prevails, and sorrows fall,</L>
<L>To see the hoard of human bliss so small;</L>
<L>And oft I wish, amidst the scene, to find</L>
<L>Some spot to real happiness consign'd,</L>
<L>Where my worn soul, each wand'ring hope at rest,</L>
<L>May gather bliss to see my fellows blest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But where to find that happiest spot below,</L>
<L>Who can direct, when all pretend to know?</L>
<L>The shudd'ring tenant of the frigid zone</L>
<L>Boldly proclaims that happiest spot his own,</L>
<L>Extols the treasures of his stormy seas,</L>
<L>And his long nights of revelry and ease;</L>
<L>The naked negro, panting at the line,</L>
<L>Boasts of his golden sands and palmy wine,</L>
<L>Basks in the glare, or stems the tepid wave,</L>
<L>And thanks his Gods for all the good they gave.</L>
<L>Such is the patriot's boast, where'er we roam,</L>
<L>His first, best country ever is, at home.</L>
<L>And yet, perhaps, if countries we compare,</L>
<L>And estimate the blessings which they share,</L>
<L>Tho' patriots flatter, still shall wisdom find</L>
<L>An equal portion dealt to all mankind,</L>
<L>As different good, by art or nature given,</L>
<L>To different nations makes their blessings even.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="36" REF="44"/>
<L>Nature, a mother kind alike to all,</L>
<L>Still grants her bliss at labour's earnest call;</L>
<L>With food as well the peasant is supply'd</L>
<L>On Idra's cliffs as Arno's shelvy side;</L>
<L>And though the rocky crested summits frown,</L>
<L>These rocks, by custom, turn to beds of down.</L>
<L>From art more various are the blessings sent;</L>
<L>Wealth, commerce, honour, liberty, content.</L>
<L>Yet these each other's pow'r so strong contest,</L>
<L>That either seems destructive of the rest.</L>
<L>Where wealth and freedom reign contentment fails,</L>
<L>And honour sinks where commerce long prevails.</L>
<L>Hence ev'ry state to one lov'd blessing prone,</L>
<L>Conforms and models life to that alone.</L>

<L>This fav'rite good begets peculiar pain.</L>

<L>But let us try these truths with closer eyes,</L>
<L>And trace them through the prospect as it lies:</L>
<L>Here for a while my proper cares resign'd,</L>
<L>Here let me sit in sorrow for mankind,</L>
<L>Like yon neglected shrub at random cast,</L>
<L>That shades the steep, and sighs at ev'ry blast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far to the right where Appennine ascends,</L>
<L>Bright as the summer, Italy extends;</L>
<L>Its uplands sloping deck the mountain's side,</L>
<L>Woods over woods in gay theatric pride;</L>
<L>While oft some temple's mould'ring tops between,</L>
<L>With venerable grandeur mark the scene.</L>

<L>Could nature's bounty satisfy the breast,</L>
<L>The sons of Italy were surely blest.</L>

Whatever fruits in different climes were found,</L>
<L>That proudly rise, or humbly court the ground;</L>
<L>Whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear,</L>
<L>Whose bright succession decks the varied year;</L>
<L>Whatever sweets salute the northern sky</L>
<L>With vernal lives that blossom but to die;</L>
<L>These here disporting own the kindred soil,</L>
<L>Nor ask luxuriance from the planter's toil;</L>
<L>While sea-born gales their gelid wings expand</L>
<L>To winnow fragrance round the smiling land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But small the bliss that sense alone bestows,</L>
<L>And sensual bliss is all the nation knows.</L>
<L>In florid beauty groves and fields appear,</L>
<L>Man seems the only growth that dwindles here.</L>
<L>Contrasted faults through all his manners reign,</L>
<L>Though poor, luxurious, though submissive, vain,</L>
<L>Though grave, yet trifling, zealous, yet untrue,</L>
<L>And ev'n in penance planning sins anew.</L>
<L>All evils here contaminate the mind,</L>
<L>That opulence departed leaves behind;</L>
<L>For wealth was theirs, not far remov'd the date,</L>
<L>When commerce proudly flourish'd through the state;</L>
<L>At her command the palace learnt to rise,</L>
<L>Again the long-fall'n column sought the skies;</L>
<L>The canvass glow'd beyond e'en Nature warm,</L>
<L>The pregnant quarry teem'd with human form.</L>
<L>Till, more unsteady than the southern gale,</L>
<L>Commerce on other shores display'd her sail;</L>
<L>While naught remain'd of all that riches gave,</L>
<L>But towns unmann'd, and lords without a slave:</L>
<L>And late the nation found with fruitless skill</L>
<L>Its former strength was but plethoric ill.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="38" REF="46"/>
<L>Yet, still the loss of wealth is here supplied</L>
<L>By arts, the splendid wrecks of former pride;</L>
<L>From these the feeble heart and long-fall'n mind</L>
<L>An easy compensation seem to find.</L>
<L>Here may be seen, in bloodless pomp array'd,</L>
<L>The paste-board triumph and the cavalcade;</L>
<L>Processions form'd for piety and love,</L>
<L>A mistress or a saint in ev'ry grove.</L>
<L>By sports like these are all their cares beguil'd,</L>
<L>The sports of children satisfy the child;</L>
<L>Each nobler aim represt by long controul,</L>
<L>Now sinks at last, or feebly mans the soul;</L>
<L>While low delights, succeeding fast behind,</L>
<L>In happier meanness occupy the mind:</L>
<L>As in those domes, where Caesars once bore sway,</L>
<L>Defac'd by time and tott'ring in decay,</L>
<L>There in the ruin, heedless of the dead,</L>
<L>The shelter-seeking peasant builds his shed,</L>
<L>And, wond'ring man could want the larger pile,</L>
<L>Exults, and owns his cottage with a smile.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My soul turn from them, turn we to survey</L>
<L>Where rougher climes a nobler race display,</L>
<L>Where the bleak Swiss their stormy mansions tread,</L>
<L>And force a churlish soil for scanty bread;</L>
<L>No product here the barren hills afford,</L>
<L>But man and steel, the soldier and his sword.</L>
<L>No vernal blooms their torpid rocks array,</L>
<L>But winter ling'ring chills the lap of May;</L>
<L>No zephyr fondly sues the mountain's breast,</L>
<L>But meteors glare, and stormy glooms invest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet still, ev'n here, content can spread a charm,</L>
<L>Redress the clime, and all its rage disarm.</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="47"/>
Though poor the peasant's hut, his feasts though small,</L>
<L>He sees his little lot the lot of all;</L>
<L>Sees no contiguous palace rear its head</L>
<L>To shame the meanness of his humble shed;</L>
<L>No costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal</L>
<L>To make him loath his vegetable meal;</L>
<L>But calm, and bred in ignorance and toil,</L>
<L>Each wish contracting, fits him to the soil.</L>
<L>Chearful at morn he wakes from short repose,</L>
<L>Breasts the keen air, and carols as he goes;</L>
<L>With patient angle trolls the finny deep,</L>
<L>Or drives his vent'rous plough-share to the steep;</L>
<L>Or seeks the den where snow-tracks mark the way,</L>
<L>And drags the struggling savage into day.</L>
<L>At night returning, ev'ry labour sped,</L>
<L>He sits him down the monarch of a shed;</L>
<L>Smiles by his chearful fire, and round surveys</L>
<L>His childrens looks, that brighten at the blaze;</L>
<L>While his lov'd partner, boastful of her hoard,</L>
<L>Displays her cleanly platter on the board:</L>
<L>And haply too some pilgrim, thither led,</L>
<L>With many a tale repays the nightly bed.</L>

<L>Thus every good his native wilds impart,</L>
<L>Imprints the patriot passion on his heart,</L>

<L>Enhance the bliss his scanty fund supplies.</L>
<L>Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms,</L>
<L>And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms;</L>
<L>And as a child, when scaring sounds molest,</L>
<L>Clings close and closer to the mother's breast,</L>
<L>So the loud torrent, and the whirlwind's roar,</L>

<L>Such are the charms to barren states assign'd,</L>
<L>Their wants but few, their wishes all confin'd.</L>
<L>Yet let them only share the praises due,</L>
<L>If few their wants, their pleasures are but few;</L>
<L>For ev'ry want that stimulates the breast,</L>
<L>Becomes a source of pleasure when redrest.</L>
<L>Whence from such lands each pleasing science flies,</L>
<L>That first excites desire, and then supplies;</L>
<L>Unknown to them, when sensual pleasures cloy,</L>
<L>To fill the languid pause with finer joy;</L>
<L>Unknown those pow'rs that raise the soul to flame,</L>
<L>Catch ev'ry nerve, and vibrate through the frame.</L>
<L>Their level life is but a mould'ring fire,</L>
<L>Unquench'd by want, unfann'd by strong desire;</L>
<L>Unfit for raptures, or, if raptures cheer</L>
<L>On some high festival of once a year,</L>
<L>In wild excess the vulgar breast takes fire,</L>
<L>Till buried in debauch, the bliss expires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But not their joys alone thus coarsely flow:</L>
<L>Their morals, like their pleasures, are but low,</L>
<L>For, as refinement stops, from sire to son</L>
<L>Unalter'd, unimprov'd the manners run,</L>
<L>And love's and friendship's finely pointed dart</L>
<L>Fall blunted from each indurated heart.</L>
<L>Some sterner virtues o'er the mountain's breast</L>
<L>May sit, like falcons cow'ring on the nest;</L>
<L>But all the gentler morals, such as play</L>
<L>Through life's more cultur'd walks, and charm the way,</L>
<L>These far dispers'd, on tim'rous pinions fly,</L>
<L>To sport and flutter in a kinder sky.</L>

Gay, sprightly land of mirth and social ease,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with thyself, whom all the world can please,</L>
<L>How often have I led thy sportive choir,</L>
<L>With tuneless pipe, beside the murmuring Loire?</L>
<L>Where shading elms along the margin grew,</L>
<L>And freshen'd from the wave the zephyr flew;</L>
<L>And haply, though my harsh touch falt'ring still,</L>
<L>But mock'd all tune, and marr'd the dancer's skill;</L>
<L>Yet would the village praise my wond'rous pow'r,</L>
<L>And dance, forgetful of the noon-tide hour.</L>
<L>Alike all ages. Dames of ancient days</L>
<L>Have led their children through the mirthful maze,</L>
<L>And the gay grandsire, skill'd in gestic lore,</L>
<L>Has frisk'd beneath the burthen of threescore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So blest a life these thoughtless realms display,</L>
<L>Thus idly busy rolls their world away:</L>
<L>Theirs are those arts that mind to mind endear,</L>
<L>For honour forms the social temper here.</L>
<L>Honour, that praise which real merit gains,</L>
<L>Or ev'n imaginary worth obtains,</L>
<L>Here passes current; paid from hand to hand,</L>
<L>It shifts in splendid traffic round the land:</L>
<L>From courts, to camps, to cottages it strays,</L>
<L>And all are taught an avarice of praise;</L>
<L>They please, are pleas'd, they give to get esteem,</L>
<L>Till, seeming blest, they grow to what they seem.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But while this softer art their bliss supplies,</L>
<L>It gives their follies also room to rise;</L>
<L>For praise too dearly lov'd, or warmly sought,</L>
<L>Enfeebles all internal strength of thought.</L>
<L>And the weak soul, within itself unblest,</L>
<L>Leans for all pleasure on another's breast.</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="50"/>
Hence ostentation here, with tawdry art,</L>
<L>Pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart;</L>
<L>Here vanity assumes her pert grimace,</L>
<L>And trims her robes of frize with copper lace;</L>
<L>Here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer,</L>
<L>To boast one splendid banquet once a year;</L>
<L>The mind still turns where shifting fashion draws,</L>
<L>Nor weigh the solid worth of self applause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To men of other minds my fancy flies,</L>
<L>Embosom'd in the deep where Holland lies.</L>
<L>Methinks her patient sons before me stand,</L>
<L>Where the broad ocean leans against the land,</L>
<L>And, sedulous to stop the coming tide,</L>
<L>Lift the tall rampire's artificial pride.</L>
<L>Onward methinks, and diligently slow</L>
<L>The firm connected bulwark seems to grow;</L>
<L>Spreads its long arms amidst the wat'ry roar,</L>
<L>Scoops out an empire, and usurps the shore.</L>
<L>While the pent ocean rising o'er the pile,</L>
<L>Sees an amphibious world beneath him smile;</L>
<L>The slow canal, the yellow blossom'd vale,</L>
<L>The willow tufted bank, the gliding sail,</L>
<L>The crouded mart, the cultivated plain,</L>
<L>A new creation rescu'd from his reign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, while around the wave-subjected soil</L>
<L>Impels the native to repeated toil,</L>
<L>Industrious habits in each bosom reign,</L>
<L>And industry begets a love of gain.</L>
<L>Hence all the good from opulence that springs,</L>
<L>With all those ills superfluous treasure brings,</L>
<L>Are here display'd. Their much-lov'd wealth imparts</L>
<L>Convenience, plenty, elegance, and arts;</L>
<L>But view them closer, craft and fraud appear,</L>

At gold's superior charms all freedom flies,</L>
<L>The needy sell it, and the rich man buys;</L>
<L>A land of tyrants, and a den of slaves,</L>

<L>And calmly bent, to servitude conform,</L>
<L>Dull as their lakes that slumber in the storm.</L>

<L>Fir'd at the sound my genius spreads her wing,</L>

<L>There all around the gentlest breezes stray,</L>
<L>There gentle music melts on ev'ry spray;</L>
<L>Creation's mildest charms are there combin'd,</L>
<L>Extremes are only in the master's mind!</L>
<L>Stern o'er each bosom reason holds her state</L>
<L>With daring aims irregularly great,</L>
<L>Pride in their port, defiance in their eye,</L>
<L>I see the lords of human kind pass by,</L>
<L>Intent on high designs, a thoughtful band,</L>

<L>Fierce in their native hardiness of soul,</L>
<L>True to imagin'd right, above controul,</L>
<L>While ev'n the peasant boasts these rights to scan,</L>
<L>And learns to venerate himself as man.</L>
</LG>

<L>Thine, Freedom, thine the blessings pictur'd here,</L>

<L>Too blest indeed, were such without alloy,</L>
<L>But foster'd ev'n by Freedom ills annoy;</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="52"/>
That independence Britons prize too high,</L>
<L>Keeps man from man, and breaks the social tie;</L>
<L>The self-dependent lordlings stand alone,</L>
<L>All claims that bind and sweeten life unknown;</L>
<L>Here by the bonds of nature feebly held,</L>
<L>Minds combat minds, repelling and repell'd.</L>
<L>Ferments arise, imprison'd factions roar,</L>
<L>Represt ambition struggles round her shore,</L>
<L>Till over-wrought, the gen'ral system feels</L>
<L>Its motions stop, or phrenzy fire the wheels.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor this the worst. As nature's ties decay,</L>
<L>As duty, love, and honour fail to sway,</L>
<L>Fictitious bonds, the bonds of wealth and law,</L>
<L>Still gather strength, and force unwilling awe.</L>
<L>Hence all obedience bows to these alone,</L>
<L>And talent sinks, and merit weeps unknown;</L>
<L>Till time may come, when stript of all her charms,</L>
<L>The land of scholars, and the nurse of arms,</L>
<L>Where noble stems transmit the patriot flame,</L>
<L>Where kings have toil'd, and poets wrote for fame,</L>
<L>One sink of level avarice shall lie,</L>
<L>And scholars, soldiers, kings, unhonour'd die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet think not, thus when Freedom's ills I state,</L>
<L>I mean to flatter kings, or court the great;</L>
<L>Ye pow'rs of truth that bid my soul aspire,</L>
<L>Far from my bosom drive the low desire;</L>
<L>And thou, fair Freedom, taught alike to feel</L>
<L>The rabble's rage, and tyrant's angry steel;</L>
<L>Thou transitory flow'r, alike undone</L>
<L>By proud contempt, or favour's fost'ring sun,</L>
<L>Still may thy blooms the changeful clime endure,</L>

For just experience tells, in ev'ry soil,</L>
<L>That those who think must govern those that toil;</L>
<L>And all that freedom's highest aims can reach,</L>
<L>Is but to lay proportion'd loads on each.</L>
<L>Hence, should one order disproportion'd grow,</L>
<L>Its double weight must ruin all below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O then how blind to all that truth requires,</L>
<L>Who think it freedom when a part aspires!</L>
<L>Calm is my soul, nor apt to rise in arms,</L>
<L>Except when fast approaching danger warms:</L>
<L>But when contending chiefs blockade the throne,</L>
<L>Contracting regal pow'r to stretch their own,</L>
<L>When I behold a factious band agree</L>
<L>To call it freedom when themselves are free;</L>
<L>Each wanton judge new penal statutes draw,</L>
<L>Laws grind the poor, and rich men rule the law;</L>
<L>The wealth of climes, where savage nations roam,</L>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CAN have no expectations in an address of this kind, either to add to your reputation, or to establish my own. You can gain nothing from my admira∣tion, as I am ignorant of that art in which you are said to excel; and I may lose much by the severity of your judgment, as few have a juster taste in poetry than you. Setting interest therefore aside, to which I never paid much attention, I must be indulged at present in following my affections. The only dedi∣cation I ever made was to my brother, because I lov∣ed him better than most other men. He is since dead. Permit me to inscribe this poem to you.</P>
<P>How far you may be pleased with the versification and meer mechanical parts of this attempt, I don't pretend to inquire; but I know you will object (and indeed several of our best and wisest friends concur in the opinion) that the depopulation it deplores is no where to be seen, and the disorders it laments are on∣ly to be found in the poet's own imagination. To this I can scarce make any other answer than that I sincerely believe what I have written; that I have taken all possible pains, in my country excursions, for
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
these four or five years past, to be certain of what I allege, and that all my views and inquiries have led me to believe those miseries real, which I here at∣tempt to display. But this is not the place to enter into an inquiry, whether the country be depopulat∣ing, or not; the discussion would take up much room, and I should prove myself, at best, an indifferent poli∣tician, to tire the reader with a long preface, when I want his unfatigued attention to a long poem:</P>
<P>In regretting the depopulation of the country, I in∣veigh against the increase of our luxuries; and here also I expect the shout of modern politicians against me. For twenty or thirty years past, it has been the fashion to consider luxury as one of the greatest nati∣onal advantages; and all the wisdom of antiquity in that particular, as erroneous. Still, however, I must remain a professed ancient on that head, and continue to think those luxuries prejudicial to states, by which so many vices are introduced, and so many kingdoms have been undone. Indeed so much has been poured out of late on the other side of the question, that, meerly for the sake of novelty and variety, one would sometimes wish to be in the right. I am,</P>

<L>SWEET AUBURN! loveliest village of the plain,</L>

<L>How often have I paus'd on ev'ry charm,</L>
<L>The shelter'd cot, the cultivated farm,</L>
<L>The never-failing brook, the busy mill,</L>
<L>The decent church that topt the neighb'ring hill,</L>
<L>The hawthorn bush, with feats beneath the shade,</L>
<L>For talking age and whisp'ring lovers made!</L>
<L>How often have I blest the coming day,</L>
<L>When toil remitting lent its turn to play,</L>
<L>And all the village train, from labour free,</L>
<L>Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree,</L>
<L>While many a pastime circled in the shade,</L>
<L>The young contending as the old survey'd;</L>
<L>And many a gambol frolic'd o'er the ground,</L>
<L>And slights of art and feats of strength went round.</L>

And still as each repeated pleasure tir'd,</L>
<L>Succeeding sports the mirthful band inspir'd;</L>
<L>The dancing pair that simply sought renown,</L>
<L>By holding out, to tire each other down;</L>
<L>The swain mistrustless of his smutted face,</L>
<L>While secret laughter titter'd round the place;</L>
<L>The bashful virgin's side-long looks of love,</L>
<L>The matron's glance that would those looks reprove.</L>
<L>These were thy charms, sweet village! sports like these,</L>
<L>With sweet succession, taught ev'n toil to please;</L>

<L>Thy sports are fled, and all thy charms withdrawn;</L>
<L>Amidst thy bow'rs the tyrant's hand is seen,</L>
<L>And desolation saddens all thy green:</L>
<L>One only master grasps the whole domain,</L>
<L>And half a tillage stints thy smiling plain;</L>
<L>No more thy glassy brook reflects the day,</L>
<L>But, choak'd with sedges, works its weedy way;</L>
<L>Along thy glades, a solitary guest,</L>
<L>The hollow sounding bittern guards its nest;</L>

<L>A time there was, ere England's griefs began,</L>
<L>When ev'ry rood of ground maintain'd its man;</L>
<L>For him light labour spread her wholesome store,</L>
<L>Just gave what life requir'd, but gave no more:</L>

<L>And his best riches, ignorance of wealth.</L>

<L>Sweet AUBURN! parent of the blissful hour,</L>
<L>Thy glades forlorn confess the tyrant's pow'r.</L>
<L>Here, as I take my solitary rounds,</L>
<L>Amidst thy tangling walks, and ruin'd grounds,</L>
<L>And, many a year elaps'd, return to view</L>
<L>Where once the cottage stood, the hawthorn grew,</L>
<L>Remembrance wakes with all her busy train,</L>
<L>Swells at my breast, and turns the past to pain.</L>

<L>In all my wand'rings round this world of care,</L>
<L>In all my griefs—and GOD has giv'n my share—</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="62"/>
I still had hopes my latest hours to crown,</L>
<L>Amidst these humble bow'rs to lay me down;</L>
<L>To husband out life's taper at the close,</L>
<L>And keep the flame from wasting by repose:</L>
<L>I still had hopes, for pride attends us still,</L>
<L>Amidst the swains to shew my book-learn'd skill,</L>
<L>Around my fire an ev'ning group to draw,</L>
<L>And tell of all I felt, and all I saw;</L>
<L>And, as an hare whom hounds and horns pursue,</L>
<L>Pants to the place from whence at first he flew,</L>
<L>I still had hopes, my long vexations past,</L>
<L>Here to return—and die at home at last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O blest retirement, friend to life's decline,</L>
<L>Retreats from care, that never must be mine,</L>
<L>How blest is he who crowns in shades like these,</L>
<L>A youth of labour with an age of ease;</L>
<L>Who quits a world where strong temptations try,</L>
<L>And, since 'tis hard to combat, learns to fly!</L>
<L>For him no wretches, born to work and weep,</L>
<L>Explore the mine, or tempt the dang'rous deep;</L>
<L>No surly porter stands in guilty state,</L>
<L>To spurn imploring famine from the gate;</L>
<L>But on he moves to meet his latter end,</L>

<L>While resignation gently slopes the way;</L>
<L>And, all his prospects bright'ning to the last,</L>
<L>His Heav'n com mences ere theworld be past!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sweet was the sound, when oft at ev'ning's close,</L>
<L>Up yonder hill the village murmur rose;</L>
<L>There, as I past with careless steps and slow,</L>
<L>The mingling notes came soften'd from below;</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="63"/>
The swain responsive as the milk-maid sung,</L>
<L>The sober herd that low'd to meet their young;</L>
<L>The noisy geese that gabbled o'er the pool,</L>
<L>The playful children just let loose from school;</L>
<L>The watch-dog's voice that bay'd the whisp'ring wind,</L>
<L>And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind;</L>
<L>These all in sweet confusion sought the shade,</L>
<L>And fill'd each pause the nightingale had made.</L>
<L>For now the sounds of population fail,</L>
<L>No chearful murmurs fluctuate in the gale,</L>
<L>No busy steps the grass-grown foot-way tread,</L>
<L>But all the bloomy flush of life is sled.</L>
<L>All but yon widow'd, solitary thing,</L>
<L>That feebly bends beside the plashy spring;</L>
<L>She, wretched matron, forc'd, in age, for bread,</L>
<L>To strip the brook with mantling cresses spread,</L>
<L>To pick her wintry faggot from the thorn,</L>
<L>To seek her nightly shed, and weep till morn;</L>
<L>She only left of all the harmless train,</L>
<L>The sad historian of the pensive plain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Near yonder copse, where once the garden smil'd,</L>
<L>And still where many a garden flow'r grows wild;</L>
<L>There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,</L>
<L>The village preacher's modest mansion rose.</L>
<L>A man he was, to all the country dear,</L>
<L>And passing rich with forty pounds a year;</L>
<L>Remote from towns he ran his godly race,</L>
<L>Nor ere had chang'd, nor wish'd to change his place;</L>
<L>Unskilful he to fawn, or seek for pow'r,</L>
<L>By doctrines fashion'd to the varying hour;</L>
<L>Far other aims his heart had learn'd to prize,</L>
<L>More bent to raise the wretched than to rise.</L>
<L><PB N="58" REF="64"/>
His house was known to all the vagrant train,</L>
<L>He chid their wand'rings, but reliev'd their pain,</L>
<L>The long-remember'd beggar was his guest,</L>
<L>Whose beard descending swept his aged breast;</L>
<L>The ruin'd spendthrift, now no longer proud,</L>
<L>Claim'd kindred there, and had his claims allow'd;</L>
<L>The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,</L>
<L>Sate by his fire, and talk'd the night away;</L>
<L>Wept o'er his wounds, or tales of sorrow done,</L>
<L>Shoulder'd his crutch, and shew'd how fields were won.</L>
<L>Pleas'd with his guests, the good man learn'd to glow,</L>
<L>And quite forgot their vices in their wo;</L>
<L>Careless their merits, or their faults to scan,</L>
<L>His pity gave ere charity began.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,</L>
<L>And ev'n his failings lean'd to Virtue's side;</L>
<L>But in his duty prompt at ev'ry call,</L>
<L>He watch'd and wept, he pray'd and felt, for all.</L>
<L>And, as a bird each fond endearment tries,</L>
<L>To tempt its new-fledg'd offspring to the skies;</L>
<L>He tried each art, reprov'd each dull delay,</L>
<L>Allur'd to brighter worlds, and led the way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beside the bed where parting life was lay'd,</L>
<L>And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismay'd,</L>
<L>The rev'rend champion stood. At his control,</L>
<L>Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;</L>
<L>Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,</L>
<L>And his last fault'ring accents whisper'd praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At church, with meek and unaffected grace,</L>
<L>His looks adorn'd the venerable place;</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="65"/>
Truth from his lips prevail'd with double sway,</L>
<L>And fools, who came to scoff, remain'd to pray.</L>
<L>The service past, around the pious man,</L>
<L>With ready zeal, each honest rustic ran;</L>
<L>Ev'n children follow'd with endearing wile,</L>
<L>And pluck'd his gown, to share the good man's smile.</L>
<L>His ready smile a parent's warmth exprest,</L>
<L>Their welfare pleas'd him, and their cares distrest;</L>
<L>To them his heart, his love, his griefs were giv'n,</L>
<L>But all his serious thoughts had rest in heav'n.</L>
<L>As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form,</L>
<L>Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,</L>
<L>Tho' round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,</L>
<L>Eternal sunshine settles on its head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way,</L>
<L>With blossom'd furze unprofitably gay,</L>
<L>There, in his noisy mansion, skill'd to rule,</L>
<L>The village master taught his little school;</L>
<L>A man severe he was, and stern to view,</L>
<L>I knew him well, and ev'ry truant knew;</L>
<L>Well had the boding tremblers learn'd to trace</L>
<L>The day's disasters in his morning face;</L>
<L>Full well they laugh'd with counterfeited glee</L>
<L>At all his jokes, for many a joke had he;</L>
<L>Full well the busy whisper circling round,</L>
<L>Convey'd the dismal tidings when he frown'd;</L>
<L>Yet he was kind, or if severe in aught,</L>
<L>The love he bore to learning was in fault;</L>
<L>The village all declar'd how much he knew;</L>
<L>'Twas certain he could write, and cypher too;</L>
<L>Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage,</L>
<L>And ev'n the story ran that he could gauge:</L>
<L><PB N="60" REF="66"/>
In arguing too, the parson own'd his skill,</L>
<L>For e'en tho' vanquish'd, he could argue still;</L>
<L>While words of learned length, and thund'ring sound,</L>
<L>Amaz'd the gazing rustics rang'd around,</L>
<L>And still they gaz'd, and still the wonder grew,</L>
<L>That one small head could carry all he knew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But past is all his fame. The very spot</L>
<L>Where many a time he triumph'd, is forgot.</L>
<L>Near yonder thorn, that lifts its head on high,</L>
<L>Where once the sign-post caught the passing eye,</L>
<L>Low lies that house where nut-brown draughts inspir'd,</L>
<L>Where grey-beard mirth and smiling toil retir'd,</L>
<L>Where village statesmen talk'd with looks profound,</L>
<L>And news much older than their ale went round.</L>
<L>Imagination fondly stoops to trace</L>
<L>The parlour splendors of that festive place;</L>
<L>The white-wash'd wall, the nicely-sanded floor,</L>
<L>The varnish'd clock that click'd behind the door;</L>
<L>The chest contriv'd a double debt to pay,</L>
<L>A bed by night, a chest of draw'rs by day;</L>
<L>The pictures plac'd for ornament and use,</L>
<L>The twelve good rules, the royal game of goose;</L>
<L>The hearth, except when winter chill'd the day,</L>
<L>With aspen boughs, and flow'rs and fennel gay,</L>
<L>While broken tea-cups, wisely kept for shew,</L>
<L>Rang'd o'er the chimney, glisten'd in a row.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Vain transitory splendor! cou'd not all</L>
<L>Reprieve the tott'ring mansion from its fall!</L>
<L>Obscure it sinks, nor shall it more impart</L>
<L>An hour's importance to the poor man's heart;</L>
<L>Thither no more the peasant shall repair,</L>
<L>To sweet oblivion of his daily care;</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="67"/>
No more the farmer's news, the barber's tale,</L>
<L>No more the wood-man's ballad shall prevail;</L>
<L>No more the smith his dusky brow shall clear,</L>

<L>The host himself no longer shall be found</L>
<L>Careful to see the mantling bliss go round;</L>
<L>Nor the coy maid, half willing to be prest,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yes! let the rich deride, the proud disdain,</L>
<L>These simple blessings of the lowly train,</L>
<L>To me more dear, congenial to my heart,</L>
<L>One native charm, than all the gloss of art;</L>
<L>Spontaneous joys, where Nature has its play,</L>
<L>The soul adopts, and owns their first-born sway;</L>
<L>Lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind,</L>
<L>Unenvy'd, unmolested, unconfin'd.</L>
<L>But the long pomp, the midnight masquerade,</L>
<L>With all the freaks of wanton wealth array'd,</L>
<L>In these, ere triflers half their wish obtain,</L>
<L>The toiling pleasure sickens into pain;</L>
<L>And, ev'n while fashion's brightest arts decoy,</L>
<L>The heart distrusting asks, if this be joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye friends to truth, ye statesmen who survey</L>
<L>The rich man's joys encrease, the poor's decay,</L>
<L>'Tis yours to judge, how wide the limits stand</L>
<L>Between a splendid and an happy land.</L>
<L>Proud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore,</L>
<L>And shouting Folly hails them from her shore;</L>
<L>Hoards, ev'n beyond the miser's wish abound,</L>
<L>And rich men flock from all the world around.</L>
<L>Yet count our gains. This wealth is but a name</L>
<L>That leaves our useful product still the same.</L>
<L><PB N="62" REF="68"/>
Not so the loss. The man of wealth and pride,</L>
<L>Takes up a space that many poor supply'd;</L>
<L>Space for his lake, his park's extended bounds,</L>
<L>Space for his horses, equipage and hounds;</L>
<L>The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth,</L>
<L>Has robb'd the neighb'ring fields of half their growth,</L>
<L>His seat, where solitary sports are seen,</L>
<L>Indignant spurns the cottage from the green;</L>
<L>Around the world each needful product flies,</L>
<L>For all the luxuries the world supplies.</L>
<L>While thus the land adorn'd for pleasure all</L>
<L>In barren splendor feebly waits the fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As some fair female unadorn'd and plain,</L>
<L>Secure to please while youth confirms her reign.</L>
<L>Slights ev'ry borrow'd charm that dress supplies,</L>
<L>Nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes:</L>
<L>But when those charms are past, for charms are frail,</L>
<L>When time advances, and when lovers fail,</L>
<L>She then shines forth, solicitous to bless,</L>
<L>In all the glaring impotence of dress.</L>
<L>Thus fares the land, by luxury betray'd,</L>
<L>In nature's simplest charms at first array'd,</L>
<L>But verging to decline, its splendors rise,</L>
<L>Its vistas strike, its palaces surprise;</L>
<L>While, scourg'd by famine from the smiling land,</L>
<L>The mournful peasant leads his humble band;</L>
<L>And while he sinks, without one arm to save,</L>
<L>The country blooms—a garden, and a grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where then, ah, where shall poverty reside,</L>
<L>To 'scape the pressure of contiguous pride?</L>
<L>If to some common's fenceless limits stray'd,</L>

<L>To see profusion that he must not share;</L>
<L>To see ten thousand baneful arts combin'd</L>
<L>To pamper luxury, and thin mankind;</L>
<L>To see each joy the sons of pleasure know,</L>
<L>Extorted from his fellow-creature's wo.</L>
<L>Here, while the courtier glitters in brocade,</L>
<L>There the pale artist plies the sickly trade;</L>
<L>Here, while the proud their long-drawn pomps display,</L>

<L>The dome where Pleasure holds her midnight reign,</L>

<L>Tumultuous grandeur crouds the blazing square,</L>

<L>Sure these denote one universal joy!</L>

<L>Where the poor houseless shiv'ring female lies.</L>

<L>Her modest looks the cottage might adorn,</L>
<L>Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn;</L>
<L>Now lost to all; her friends, her virtue fled,</L>
<L>Near her betrayer's door she lays her head,</L>
<L>And, pinch'd with cold, and shrinking from the show'r,</L>
<L>With heavy heart deplores that luckless hour,</L>
<L>When idly first, ambitious of the town,</L>
<L>She left her wheel and robes of country brown.</L>

<HEAD>THE HAUNCH OF VENISON, A POETIC EPISTLE, TO LORD CLARE.</HEAD>

<HEAD>THE HAUNCH OF VENISON, A POETIC EPISTLE, TO LORD CLARE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THANKS, my lord, for your venison, for finer or fatter</L>
<L>Never rang'd in a forest, or smoak'd in a platter;</L>
<L>The haunch was a picture for painters to study,</L>
<L>The fat was so white, and the lean was so ruddy,</L>
<L>Tho' my stomach was sharp, I could scarce help re∣gretting,</L>
<L>To spoil such a delicate picture by eating;</L>
<L>I had thoughts, in my chambers, to place it in view,</L>
<L>To be shewn to my friends as a piece of virtu:</L>
<L>As in some Irish houses, where things are so so,</L>
<L>One gammon of bacon hangs up for a show:</L>
<L>But, for eating a rasher of what they take pride in,</L>
<L>They'd as soon think of eating the pan it is fry'd in.</L>
<L><PB N="74" REF="79"/>
But hold—let me pause—don't I hear you pronounce,</L>
<L>This tale of the bacon's a damnable bounce;</L>
<L>Well, suppose it a bounce—sure a poet may try,</L>
<L>By a bounce now and then, to get courage to fly.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, my lord, it's no bounce: I protest in my turn,</L>
<L>It's a truth—and your lordship may ask Mr. Burn.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Clare's nephew.</NOTE></L>
<L>To go on with my tale—as I gaz'd on the haunch;</L>
<L>I thought of a friend that was trusty and staunch,</L>
<L>So I cut it, and sent it to Reynolds undrest,</L>
<L>To paint it, or eat it, just as he lik'd best.</L>
<L>Of the neck and the breast I had next to dispose;</L>
<L>'Twas a neck and a breast that might rival Monroe's:</L>
<L>But in parting with these I was puzzled again,</L>
<L>With the how, and the who, and the where, and the when.</L>
<L>There's H—d, and C—y, and H—rth, and H—ff,</L>
<L>I think they love venison—I know they love beef.</L>
<L>There's my countryman Higgins—Oh! let him alone,</L>
<L>For making a blunder, or picking a bone.</L>
<L>But hang it—to poets who seldom can eat,</L>
<L>Your very good mutton's a very good treat;</L>
<L>Such dainties to them their health it might hurt,</L>
<L>It's like sending them ruffles, when wanting a shirt.</L>
<L>While thus I debated, in reverie center'd,</L>
<L>An acquaintance, a friend as he call'd himself, enter'd;</L>
<L>An under-bred, fine-spoken fellow was he,</L>
<L>And he smil'd as he look'd at the venison and me.</L>
<L>What have we got here?—Why this is good eating!</L>
<L>Your own I suppose—or is it in waiting?</L>
<L>Why whose should it be? cried I, with a flounce,</L>
<L>I get these things often;—but that was a bounce▪</L>
<L><PB N="75" REF="80"/>
Some lords, my acquaintance, that settle the nation,</L>
<L>Are pleas'd to be kind—but I hate ostentation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If that be the case then, cried he, very gay,</L>
<L>I'm glad I have taken this house in my way.</L>
<L>To-morrow you take a poor dinner with me;</L>
<L>No words—I insist on't—precisely at three:</L>
<L>We'll have Johnson, and Burke, all the wits will be there,</L>
<L>My acquaintance is slight, or I'd ask my lord Clare.</L>
<L>And, now that I think on't, as I am a sinner!</L>
<L>We wanted this venison to make out the dinner.</L>
<L>What say you—a pasty, it shall, and it must,</L>
<L>And my wife, little Kitty, is famous for crust.</L>
<L>Here, porter—this venison with me to Mile-end;</L>
<L>No stirring—I beg—my dear friend—my dear friend!</L>
<L>Thus snatching his hat, he brusht off like the wind,</L>
<L>And the porter and eatables follow'd behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Left alone to reflect, having emptied my shelf,</L>
<L>And "nobody with me at sea but myself;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the letters that passed between his royal highness Henry duke of Cumberland, and lady Grosvenor—12<SUP>o</SUP>. 1769.</NOTE></L>
<L>Tho' I could not help thinking my gentleman hasty,</L>
<L>Yet Johnson, and Burke, and a good venison pasty,</L>
<L>Were things that I never disliked in my life,</L>
<L>Tho' clogg'd with a coxcomb, and Kitty his wife.</L>
<L>So next day in due splendor to make my approach,</L>
<L>I drove to his door in my own hackney-coach.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When come to the place where we all were to dine,</L>
<L>(A chair-lumber'd closet just twelve feet by nine:)</L>
<L><PB N="76" REF="81"/>
My friend bade me welcome, but struck me quite dumb,</L>
<L>With tidings that Johnson, and Burke would not come,</L>
<L>For I knew it, he cried, both eternally fail,</L>
<L>The one with his speeches, and t'other with Thrale;</L>
<L>But no matter, I'll warrant we'll make up the party,</L>
<L>With two full as clever, and ten times as hearty.</L>
<L>The one is a Scotchman, the other a Jew,</L>
<L>They both of them merry, and authors like you;</L>
<L>The one writes the Snarler, the other the Scourge;</L>
<L>Some thinks he writes Cinna—he owns to Panurge.</L>
<L>While thus he describ'd them by trade and by name,</L>
<L>They enter'd, and dinner was serv'd as they came.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At the top a fried liver, and bacon were seen,</L>
<L>At the bottom was tripe, in a swinging tureen;</L>
<L>At the sides there was spinnage and pudding made hot;</L>
<L>In the middle a place where the pasty—was not.</L>
<L>Now, my lord, as for tripe it's my utter aversion,</L>
<L>And your bacon I hate like a Turk or a Persian;</L>
<L>So there I sat stuck, like a horse in a pound,</L>
<L>While the bacon and liver went merrily round:</L>
<L>But what vex'd me most, was that d—'d Scottish rogue,</L>
<L>With his long-winded speeches, his smiles and his brogue,</L>
<L>And, madam, quoth he, may this bit be my poison,</L>
<L>A prettier dinner I never set eyes on;</L>
<L>Pray a slice of your liver, tho' may I be curst,</L>
<L>But I've eat of your tripe, till I'm ready to burst.</L>
<L>The tripe, quoth the Jew, with his chocolate cheek,</L>
<L>I could dine on this tripe seven days in the week:</L>
<L>I like these here dinners so pretty and small;</L>
<L>But your friend there, the-doctor, eats nothing at all.</L>
<L>O—oh! quoth my friend, he'll come on in a trice,</L>
<L>He's keeping a corner for something that's nice:</L>
<L><PB N="77" REF="82"/>
There's a pasty—a pasty! repeated the Jew;</L>
<L>I don't care, if I keep a corner for't too.</L>
<L>What the de'il, mon, a pasty! re-echo'd the Scot;</L>
<L>Though splitting, I'll still keep a corner for that.</L>
<L>We'll all keep a corner, the lady cried out;</L>
<L>We'll all keep a corner was echo'd about.</L>
<L>While thus we resolv'd, and the pasty delay'd,</L>
<L>With looks that quite petrified, enter'd the maid;</L>
<L>A visage so sad, and so pale with affright,</L>
<L>Wak'd Priam in drawing his curtains by night.</L>
<L>But we quickly found out, for who could mistake her?</L>
<L>That she came with some terrible news from the baker:</L>
<L>And so it fell out, for that negligent sloven,</L>
<L>Had shut out the pasty on shutting his oven.</L>
<L>Sad Philomel thus—but let similes drop—</L>
<L>And now that I think on't, the story may stop.</L>
<L>To be plain, my good lord, it's but labour misplac'd,</L>
<L>To send such good verses to one of your taste;</L>
<L>You've got an odd something—a kind of discerning—</L>
<L>A relish—a taste—sicken'd over by learning;</L>
<L>At least, it's your temper, as very well known,</L>
<L>That you think very slightly of all that's your own:</L>
<L>So, perhaps, in your habits of thinking amiss,</L>
<L>You may make a mistake, and think slightly of this.</L>

<PB N="99" REF="100"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I undertook to write a comedy, I con∣fess I was strongly prepossessed in favour of the poets of the last age, and strove to imitate them. The term, genteel comedy, was then unknown amongst us, and little more was desired by an audience, than nature and humour, in whatever walks of life they were most conspicuous. The author of the follow∣ing scenes never imagined that more would be ex∣pected of him, and therefore to delineate character has been his principal aim. Those who know any thing of composition, are sensible, that in pursuing humour, it will sometimes lead us into the recesses of the mean; I was even tempted to look for it in the master of a spunging-house: but in deference to the public taste, grown of late, perhaps, too delicate; the scene of the bailiffs was retrenched in the re∣presentation. In deference also to the judgment of a few friends, who think in a particular way, the scene is here restored. The author submits it to the reader in his closet; and hopes that too much refinement will not banish humour and character from ours, as it has already done from the French theatre. Indeed the French comedy is now become so very elevated and sentimental, that it has not only banished hu∣mour and Moliere from the stage, but it has banish∣ed all spectators too.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="101"/>
Upon the whole, the author returns his thanks to the public for the favourable reception which the Good-Natur'd Man has met with: and to Mr. Col∣man in particular, for his kindness to it. It may not also be improper to assure any, who shall hereafter write for the theatre, that merit, or supposed merit, will ever be a sufficient passport to his protection.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE</HEAD>
<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY DR. JOHNSON:</BYLINE>
<STAGE>SPOKEN BY MR. BENSLEY.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>PREST by the load of life, the weary mind</L>
<L>Surveys the general toil of human kind;</L>
<L>With cool submission joins the lab'ring train,</L>
<L>And social sorrow, loses half its pain:</L>
<L>Our anxious bard, without complaint, may share</L>
<L>This bustling season's epidemic care.</L>
<L>Like Caesar's pilot, dignify'd by fate,</L>
<L>Tost in one common storm with all the great;</L>
<L>Distrest alike, the statesman and the wit,</L>
<L>When one a borough courts, and one the pit.</L>
<L>The busy candidates for power and fame,</L>
<L>Have hopes, and fears, and wishes, just the same;</L>
<L>Disabled both to combat, or to fly,</L>
<L>Must hear all taunts, and hear without reply.</L>
<L>Uncheck'd on both, loud rabbles vent their rage,</L>
<L>As mongrels bay the lion in a cage.</L>
<L>Th' offended burgess hoards his angry tale,</L>
<L>For that blest year when all that vote may rail;</L>
<L>Their schemes of spite the poet's foes dismiss,</L>
<L>Till that glad night, when all that hate may hiss.</L>
<L>This day the powder'd curls and golden coat,</L>
<L>Says swelling Crispin, begg'd a cobler's vote.</L>
<L><PB N="102" REF="103"/>
This night, our wit, the pert apprentice cries,</L>
<L>Lies at my feet, I hiss him, and he dies.</L>
<L>The great, 'tis true, can charm th' electing tribe;</L>
<L>The bard may supplicate, but cannot bribe.</L>
<L>Yet judg'd by those, whose voices ne'er were sold,</L>
<L>He feels no want of ill-persuading gold;</L>
<L>But confident of praise, if praise be due,</L>
<L>Trusts without fear, to merit, and to you.</L>

<STAGE>SCENE, an apartment in YOUNG HONEYWOOD'S house.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Enter SIR WILLIAM HONEYWOOD, JARVIS.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>GOOD Jarvis, make no apologies for this honest bluntness. Fidelity, like yours, is the best excuse for every freedom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't help being blunt, and being very angry too, when I hear you talk of disinheriting so good, so wor∣thy a young gentleman as your nephew, my master. All the world loves him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say rather, that he loves all the world; that is his fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sure there is no part of it more dear to him than you are, tho' he has not seen you since he was a child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>What signifies his affection to me; or how can I be proud of a place in a heart where every sharper and coxcomb find an easy entrance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant you that he's rather too good-natur'd; that he's too much every man's man; that he laughs this minute with one, and cries the next with another; but whose instructions may he thank for all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not mine, sure? My letters to him during my em∣ployment in Italy, taught him only that philosophy which might prevent, not defend his errors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, begging your honour's pardon, I'm sorry they taught him any philosophy at all; it has only serv'd to spoil him. This same philosophy is a good horse in the stable, but an errant jade on a journey. For my own part, whenever I hear him mention the name on't, I'm always sure he's going to play the fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't let us ascribe his faults to his philosophy, I entreat you. No, Jarvis, his good nature arises ra∣ther from his fears of offending the importunate, than his desire of making the deserving happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What it rises from, I don't know. But, to be sure, every body has it, that asks it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, or that does not ask it. I have been now for some time a concealed spectator of his follies, and find them as boundless as his dissipation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, faith, he has some fine name or other for them all. He calls his extravagance, generosity; and his trusting every body, universal benevolence. It was but last week he went security for a fellow whose face he scarce knew, and that he called an act of exalted mu—mu—munificence; ay, that was the name he gave it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>And upon that I proceed, as my last effort, tho' with very little hopes to reclaim him. That very fellow has just absconded, and I have taken up the se∣curity. Now, my intention is to involve him in fic∣titious distress, before he has plunged himself into real calamity. To arrest him for that very debt, to clap an officer upon him, and then let him see which of his friends will come to his relief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if I could but any way see him thoroughly vexed, every groan of his would be music to me; yet faith, I believe it impossible. I have tried to fret him myself every morning these three years; but, instead of being angry, he sits as calmly to hear me scold, as he does to his hair-dresser.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must try him once more, however, and I'll go this instant to put my scheme into execution; and I don't despair of succeeding, as, by your means, I can have frequent opportunities of being about him, without being known. What a pity it is, Jarvis, that any man's good will to others should produce so much neglect of himself, as to require correction. Yet, we must touch his weaknesses with a delicate
<PB N="106" REF="107"/>
hand. There are some faults so nearly allied to ex∣cellence, that we can scarce weed out the vice with∣out eradicating the virtue. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, go thy ways, sir William Honeywood. It is not without reason that the world allows thee to be the best of men. But here comes his hopeful ne∣phew; the strange, good-natur'd, foolish, open-heart∣ed—And yet, all his faults are such that one loves him still the better for them.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter HONEYWOOD.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Jarvis, what messages from my friends this morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have no friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; from my acquaintance then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P> <STAGE>(<HI>Pulling out bills</HI>)</STAGE> A few of our usual cards of com∣pliment, that's all. This bill from your taylor; this from your mercer; and this from the little broker in Crooked-lane. He says he has been at a great deal of trouble to get back the money you borrowed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I don't know; but I'm sure we were at a great deal of trouble in getting him to lend it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has lost all patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he has lost a very good thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="107" REF="108"/>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's that ten guineas you were sending to the poor gentleman and his children in the Fleet. I be∣lieve that would stop his mouth, for a while at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Jarvis, but what will fill their mouths in the mean time? Must I be cruel because he happens to be importunate; and, to relieve his avarice, leave them to insupportable distress?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath! sir, the question now is how to relieve yourself. Yourself—Hav'nt I reason to be out of my senses, when I see things going at sixes and sevens?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever reason you may have for being out of your senses, I hope you'll allow that I'm not quite unreasonable for continuing in mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're the only man alive in your present situati∣on that could do so—Every thing upon the waste. There's miss Richland and her fine fortune gone al∣ready, and upon the point of being given to your rival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm no man's rival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your uncle in Italy preparing to disinherit you; your own fortune almost spent; and nothing but press∣ing creditors, false friends, and a pack of drunken servants that your kindness has made unfit for any other family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they have the more occasion for being in mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Soh! What will you have done with him that I caught stealing your plate in the pantry? In the fact; I caught him in the fact.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the fact! If so, I really think that we should pay him his wages, and turn him off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>He shall be turn'd off at Tyburn, the dog; we'll hang him, if it be only to frighten the rest of the fa∣mily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Jarvis: it's enough that we have lost what he has stolen, let us not add to it the loss of a fellow creature!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very fine; well, here was the footman just now, to complain of the butler; he says he does most work, and ought to have most wages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's but just; tho' perhaps here comes the but∣ler to complain of the footman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, its the way with them all, from the scullion to the privy-counsellor. If they have a bad master, they keep quarrelling with him: if they have a good-mas∣ter, they keep quarrelling with one another.</P>

<SPEAKER>BUTLER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I'll not stay in the family with Jonathan; you must part with him, or part with me, that's the ex∣ex-exposition of the matter, sir.</P>

<P>Full and explicit enough. But what's his fault, good Philip?</P>

<P>Sir, he's given to drinking, sir, and I shall have my morals corrupted, by keeping such company.</P>

<P>Begging your honour's pardon, and begging your pardon, master Jarvis, I'll not go to bed, nor to the devil neither. I have enough to do to mind my cel∣lar. I forgot, your honour, Mr. Croaker is below. I came on purpose to tell you.</P>

<P>Why didn't you shew him up, blockhead?</P>

<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, we have one or other of that family in this house from morning till night. He comes on the old affair I suppose. The match between his son,

that's just returned from Paris, and miss Richland, the young lady he's guardian to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps so. Mr. Croaker, knowing my friendship for the young lady, has got it into his head that I can persuade her to what I please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! If you lov'd yourself but half as well as she loves you, we should soon see a marriage that would set all things to rights again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love me! Sure, Jarvis, you dream. No, no; her intimacy with me never amounted to more than friend∣ship—mere friendship. That she is the most lovely woman that ever warm'd the human heart with de∣sire, I own. But never let me harbour a thought of making her unhappy, by a connection with one so unworthy her merits as I am. No, Jarvis, it shall be my study to serve her, even in spite of my wishes; and to secure her happiness, tho' it destroys my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was ever the like! I want patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, Jarvis, tho' I could obtain miss Richland's consent, do you think I could succeed with her guar∣dian, or Mrs. Croaker his wife; who, tho' both very fine in their way, are yet a little opposite in their dis∣positions you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Opposite enough, heaven knows; the very reverse of each other; she all laugh and no joke; he always complaining, and never sorrowful; a fretful poor soul that has a new distress for every hour in the four and twenty—</P>

<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must own my old monitor is not entirely wrong. There is something in my friend Croaker's conversa∣tion that quite depresses me. His very mirth is an antidote to all gaiety, and his appearance has a stron∣ger effect on my spirits than an undertaker's shop.—Mr. Croaker, this is such a satisfaction—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter CROAKER.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>A pleasant morning to Mr. Honeywood, and many of them. How is this! You look most shock∣ingly to day, my dear friend. I hope this weather does not affect your spirits. To be sure, if this wea∣ther continues—I say nothing—But God send we be all better this day three months.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I heartily concur in the wish, tho' I own not in your apprehensions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be not! Indeed what signifies what weather we have in a country going to ruin like ours? Taxes
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
rising and trade falling. Money flying out of the king∣dom and Jesuits swarming into it. I know at this time no less than an hundred and twenty-seven Je∣suits between Charing-cross and Temple-bar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Jesuits will scarce pervert you or me I should hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be not. Indeed what signifies whom they pervert in a country that has scarce any religion to lose? I'm only afraid for our wives and daughters.</P>

<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no apprehensions for the ladies I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be not. Indeed what signifies whether they be perverted or no? The women in my time were good for something. I have seen a lady drest from top to toe in her own manufactures formerly. But now a-days the devil a thing of their own manufac∣tures about them, except their faces.</P>

<P>But, however these faults may be practised abroad, you don't find them at home, either with Mrs. Croaker, Olivia or miss Richland.</P>

<P>The best of them will never be canoniz'd for a saint when she's dead. By the bye, my dear friend, I don't find this match between miss Richland and my son much relish'd, either by one side or t'other.</P>

People think, indeed, because they see me come out in a morning thus, with a pleasant face, and to make my friends merry, that all's well within. But I have cares that would break an heart of stone. My wife has so encroach'd upon every one of my privileges, that I'm now no more than a mere lodger in my own house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>But a little spirit exerted on your side might per∣haps restore your authority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, tho' I had the spirit of a lion! I do rouze sometimes. But what then! Always haggling and haggling. A man is tired of getting the better before his wife is tired of losing the victory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's a melancholy consideration indeed, that our chief comforts often produce our greatest anxieties, and that an encrease of our possessions is but an inlet to new disquietudes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dear friend, these were the very words of poor Dick Doleful to me not a week before he made away with himself. Indeed, Mr. Honeywood, I ne∣ner see you but you put me in mind of poor—Dick. Ah there was merit neglected for you! and so true a
<PB N="114" REF="115"/>
friend; we lov'd each other for thirty years, and yet he never asked me to lend him a single farthing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what could induce him to commit so rash an action at last?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know, some people were malicious enough to say it was keeping company with me; because we us'd to meet now and then and open our hearts to each other. To be sure I lov'd to hear him talk, and he lov'd to hear me talk; poor dear Dick. He us'd to say that Croaker rhim'd to joker; and so we us'd to laugh—Poor Dick. <STAGE>(<HI>Going to cry.</HI>)</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>His fate affects me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, he grew sick of this miserable life, where we do nothing but eat and grow hungry, dress and un∣dress, get up and lie down; while reason, that should watch like a nurse by our side, falls as fast asleep as we do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>To say truth, if we compare that part of life which is to come, by that which we have past, the prospect is hideous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Life at the greatest and best is but a froward child, that must be humour'd and coax'd a little till it falls asleep, and then all the care is over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, sir, nothing can exceed the vanity of our existence, but the folly of our pursuits. We wept when we came into the world, and every day tells us why.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="115" REF="116"/>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dear friend, it is a perfect satisfaction to be miserable with you. My son Leontine shan't lose the benefit of such fine conversation. I'll just step home for him. I am willing to shew him so much seriousness in one scarce older than himself—And what if I bring my last letter to the Gazetteer on the encrease and progress of earthquakes? It will amuse us I promise you. I there prove how the late earth∣quake is coming round to pay us another visit from London to Lisbon, from Lisbon to the Canary Islands, from the Canary Islands to Palmyra, from Palmyra to Constantinople, and so from Constantinople back to London again. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Croaker! His situation deserves the utmost pity. I shall scarce recover my spirits these three days. Sure to live upon such terms is worse than death itself. And yet, when I consider my own situation, a broken fortune, an hopeless passion, friends in distress; the wish but not the power to serve them— <STAGE>(<HI>paus∣ing and sighing.</HI>)</STAGE> </P>

<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have just come, my dear Honeywood, from the auction. There was the old deaf dowager, as usual, bidding like a fury against herself. And then so curi∣ous in antiques! herself the most genuine piece of an∣tiquity in the whole collection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me, ladies, if some uneasiness from friend∣ship makes me unfit to share in this good humour: I know you'll pardon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I vow he seems as melancholy as if he had taken a dose of my husband this morning. Well, if Richland here can pardon you, I must.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would seem to insinuate, madam, that I have particular reasons for being dispos'd to refuse it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever I insinuate, my dear, don't be so ready to wish an explanation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own I should be sorry, Mr. Honeywood's long friendship and mine should be misunderstood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no answering for others, madam. But I hope you'll never find me presuming to offer more than the most delicate friendship may readily allow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I shall be prouder of such a tribute from you than the most passionate professions from others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>My own sentiments, madam: friendship is a disin∣terested commerce between equals; love, an abject intercourse between tyrants and slaves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="117" REF="118"/>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, without a compliment, I know none more dis∣interested or more capable of friendship than Mr. Ho∣neywood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, indeed, I know nobody that has more friends, at least among the ladies. Miss Fruzz, miss Odbody, and miss Winterbottom praise him in all companies. As for miss Biddy Bundle, she's his professed admirer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! an admirer! I did not know, sir, you were such a favourite there. But is she seriously so hand∣some? Is she the mighty thing talked of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>The town, madam, seldom begins to praise a lady's beauty, till she's beginning to lose it. <STAGE>(<HI>Smiling.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But she's resolved never to lose it, it seems. For, as her natural face decays, her skill improves in making the artificial one. Well, nothing diverts me more than one of those fine, old, dressy things, who thinks to conceal her age, by every where exposing her per∣son; sticking herself up in the front of a side-box; trailing through a minuet at Almack's; and then, in the public gardens, looking for all the world like one of the painted ruins of the place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every age has its admirers, ladies. While you, perhaps, are trading among the warmer climates of youth; there ought to be some to carry on an useful commerce in the frozen latitudes beyond fifty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, then, the mortifications they must suffer, be∣fore they can be fitted out for traffic. I have seen
<PB N="118" REF="119"/>
one of them fret an whole morning at her hair-dres∣ser, when all the fault was her face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, I'll engage, has carried that face at last to a very good market. This good-natur'd town, ma∣dam, has husbands, like spectacles, to fit every age, from fifteen to fourscore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you're a dear good-natur'd creature. But you know you're engaged with us this morning up∣on a strolling party. I want to shew Olivia the town, and the things; I believe I shall have business for you for the whole day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, madam, I have an appointment with Mr. Croaker, which it is impossible to put off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! with my husband! Then I'm resolved to take no refusal. Nay, I protest you must. You know I never laugh so much as with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if I must, I must. I'll swear you have put me into such spirits. Well, do you find jest, and I'll find laugh, I promise you. We'll wait for the cha∣riot in the next room. <STAGE>[Exeunt.</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>There they go, thoughtless and happy. My dear∣est Olivia, what would I give to see you capable of sharing in their amusements, and as chearful as they are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="119" REF="120"/>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, my Leontine, how can I be chearful, when I have so many terrors to oppress me? The fear of being detected by this family, and the apprehensions of a censuring world, when I must be detected—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The world! my love, what can it say? At worst it can only say that, being compelled by a mercenary guardian to embrace a life you disliked, you formed a resolution of flying with the man of your choice; that you confided in his honour, and took refuge in my father's house; the only one where your's could remain without censure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But consider, Leontine, your disobedience and my indiscretion: your being sent to France to bring home a sister; and, instead of a sister, bringing home—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>One dearer than a thousand sisters. One that I am convinc'd will be equally dear, to the rest of the fa∣mily, when she comes to be known.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that, I fear, will shortly be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible, 'till we ourselves think proper to make the discovery. My sister, you know, has been with her aunt, at Lyons, since she was a child, and you find every creature in the family takes you for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But may'nt she write, may'nt her aunt write?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her aunt scarce ever writes, and all my sister's let∣ters are directed to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="120" REF="121"/>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But won't your refusing miss Richland, for whom you know the old gentleman intends you, create a suspicion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, there's my master-stroke. I have resolv∣ed not to refuse her; nay, an hour hence I have con∣sented to go with my father, to make her an offer of my heart and fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your heart and fortune!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be alarm'd, my dearest. Can Olivia think so meanly of my honour, or my love, as to suppose I could ever hope for happiness from any but her? No, my Olivia, neither the force, nor, permit me to add, the delicacy of my passion, leave any room to suspect me. I only offer miss Richland an heart, I am convinc'd she will refuse; as I am confident, that, without knowing it, her affections are fixed upon Mr. Honeywood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Honeywood! You'll excuse my apprehensi∣ons; but when your merits come to be put in the balance—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You view them with too much partiality. How∣ever, by making this offer, I shew a seeming com∣pliance with my father's command; and perhaps, up∣on her refusal, I may have his consent to chuse for myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I submit. And yet, my Leontine, I own, I shall envy her, even your pretended addresses. I
<PB N="121" REF="122"/>
consider every look, every expression of your esteem, as due only to me. This is folly perhaps: I allow it; but it is natural to suppose, that merit which has made an impression on one's own heart, may be pow∣erful over that of another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't, my life's treasure, don't let us make imagi∣nary evils, when you know we have so many real ones to encounter. At worst, you know, if miss Richland should consent, or my father refuse his par∣don, it can but end in a trip to Scotland; and—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where have you been, boy? I have been seeking you. My friend Honeywood here, has been saying such comfortable things. Ah! he's an example in∣deed. Where is he? I left him here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I believe you may see him, and hear him too in the next room: he's preparing to go out with the ladies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good gracious, can I believe my eyes or my ears! I'm struck dumb with his vivacity, and stunn'd with the loudness of his laugh. Was there ever such a transformation! <STAGE>(<HI>A laugh behind the scenes, Croaker mimics it.</HI>)</STAGE> Ha! ha! ha! there it goes: a plague take their balderdash; yet I could expect nothing less, when my precious wife was of the party. On my conscience, I believe, she could spread an horse∣laugh thro' the pews of a tabernacle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="122" REF="123"/>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since you find so many objections to a wife, sir, how can you be so earnest in recommending one to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have told you, and tell you again, boy, that miss Richland's fortune must not go out of the fa∣mily; one may find comfort in the money, whatever one does in the wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, sir, tho', in obedience to your desire, I am ready to marry her; it may be possible, she has no inclination to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you once for all how it stands. A good part of miss Richland's large fortune consists in a claim upon government, which my good friend, Mr. Lofty, assures me the treasury will allow. One half of this she is to forfeit, by her father's will, in case she refuses to marry you. So, if she rejects you, we seize half her fortune; if she accepts you, we seize the whole, and a fine girl into the bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, sir, if you will but listen to reason—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, then, produce your reasons. I tell you I'm fix'd, determined, so now produce your reasons. When I'm determined, I always listen to reason, be∣cause it can then do no harm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have alleged that a mutual choice was the first requisite in matrimonial happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and you have both of you a mutual choice. She has her choice—to marry you, or lose half her
<PB N="123" REF="124"/>
fortune; and you have your choice—to marry her, or pack out of doors without any fortune at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An only son, sir, might expect more indulgence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>An only father, sir, might expect more obedience; besides, has not your sister here, that never disobliged me in her life, as good a right as you? He's a sad dog, Livy, my dear, and would take all from you. But he shan't, I tell you he shan't, for you shall have your share.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear sir, I wish you'd be convinced that I can ne∣ver be happy in any addition to my fortune, which is taken from his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, it's a good child, so say no more; but come with me, and we shall see something that will give us a great deal of pleasure, I promise you; old Ruggins, the curry-comb-maker, lying in state; I'm told he makes a very handsome corpse, and becomes his coffin prodigiously.

<P>OLIVIA not his sister? Olivia not Leontine's sister? You amaze me!</P>

<P>No more his sister than I am; I had it all from his own servant; I can get any thing from that quarter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how? Tell me again, Garnet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GARNET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, madam, as I told you before, instead of go∣ing to Lyons, to bring home his sister, who has been there with her aunt these ten years; he never went further than Paris; there he saw and fell in love with this young lady, by the bye, of a prodigious family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And brought her home to my guardian, as his daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GARNET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and his daughter she will be. If he don't con∣sent to their marriage, they talk of trying what a Scotch parson can do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I own they have deceived me—And so de∣murely as Olivia carried it too!—Would you believe it, Garnet, I told her all my secrets; and yet the sly cheat concealed all this from me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="125" REF="126"/>
<SPEAKER>GARNET.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, upon my word, madam, I don't much blame her; she was loath to trust one with her secrets, that was so very bad at keeping her own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, to add to their deceit, the young gentleman, it seems, pretends to make me serious proposals. My guardian and he are to be here presently, to open the affair in form. You know I am to lose half my fortune if I refuse him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GARNET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, what can you do? For being, as you are, in love with Mr. Honeywood, madam—</P>

<P>How! idiot; what do you mean? In love with Mr. Honeywood! Is this to provoke me?</P>

<P>That is, madam, in friendship with him; I meant nothing more than friendship, as I hope to be married; nothing more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, no more of this! As to my guardian, and his son, they shall find me prepared to receive them; I'm resolved to accept their proposal with seeming pleasure, to mortify them by compliance, and so throw the re∣fusal at last upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GARNET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Delicious! and that will secure your whole fortune to yourself. Well, who could have thought so inno∣cent a face could cover so much cuteness!</P>

<P>That's not the thing, my little sweeting; my love!

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear, sir, he's absent now; or such a declaration would have come most properly from himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Himself! madam, he would die before he could make such a confession; and if he had not a channel for his passion thro' me, it would ere now have drowned his understanding.</P>

<P>I must grant, sir, there are attractions in modest diffidence above the force of words. A silent address is the genuine eloquence of sincerity.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why indeed, sir, his uncommon ardour almost com∣pels me, forces me to comply. And yet I'm afraid he'll despise a conquest gained with too much ease: won't you, Mr. Leontine?</P>

<P>'DEAR NICK,</P>
<P>'AN English gentleman, of large fortune, has for some time made private, tho' honourable proposals to your daughter Olivia. They love each other tenderly, and I find she has consented, without let∣ting any of the family know, to crown his addresses. As such good offers don't come every day, your own good sense, his large fortune, and family considera∣tions, will induce you to forgive her.</P>
<P>'Yours ever, RACHEL CROAKER.'</P>
<P>My daughter, Olivia, privately contracted to a man of large fortune! This is good news indeed. My heart never foretold me of this. And yet, how slily the lit∣tle baggage has carried it since she came home. Not a word on't to the old ones for the world. Yet, I thought, I saw something she wanted to conceal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if they have concealed their amour, they shan't conceal their wedding; that shall be public, I'm resolved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell thee, woman, the wedding is the most foolish part of the ceremony. I can never get this woman to think of the more serious part of the nuptial engage∣ment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, would you have me think of their funeral? But come, tell me, my dear, don't you owe more to me than you care to confess? Would you have ever been known to Mr. Lofty, who has undertaken miss Richland's claim at the treasury, but for me? Who was it first made him an acquaintance at lady Shab∣baroon's rout? Who got him to promise us his in∣terest? Is not he a back-stairs favourite, one that can do what he pleases with those that do what they please? Isn't he an acquaintance that all your groaning and la∣mentations could never have got us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is a man of importance, I grant you. And yet, what amazes me is, that while he is giving away places to all the world, he can't get one for himself.</P>
</SP>

<P>You see now, my dear. What an extensive depart∣ment! Well, friend, let your master know, that we are extremely honoured by this honour. Was there any thing ever in a higher style of breeding! All messages among the great are now done by express.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, no man does little things with more solemnity, or claims more respect than he. But he's in the right on't. In our bad world, respect is given, where respect is claim'd.</P>

<P>Never mind the world, my dear; you were never in a pleasanter place in your life. Let us now think of receiving him with proper respect <STAGE>(<HI>a loud rapping at the door</HI>)</STAGE> and there he is by the thundering rap.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, verily, there he is; as close upon the heels of his own express, as an indorsement upon the back of a bill. Well, I'll leave you to receive him, whilst I go to chide my little Olivia for intending to steal a marriage without mine or her aunt's consent.

the expresses to his grace be ready, let them be sent off; they're of importance. Madam, I ask a thousand pardons.</P>

<P>Sir, this honour—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And Dubardieu! if the person calls about the com∣mission, let him know that it is made out. As for lord Cumbercourt's stale request, it can keep cold: you understand me. Madam, I ask ten thousand par∣dons.</P>

<P>Sir, this honour—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And, Dubardieu! if the man comes from the Cor∣nish borough, you must do him; you must do him, I say. Madam, I ask ten thousand pardons. And if the Russian—ambassador calls: but he will scarce call to∣day, I believe. And now, madam, I have just got time to express my happiness in having the honour of being permitted to profess myself your most obedient humble servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, the happiness and honour are all mine; and yet, I'm only robbing the public while I detain you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sink the public, madam, when the fair are to be attended. Ah, could all my hours be so charmingly devoted! Sincerely, don't you pity us poor creatures in affairs? Thus it is eternally; solicited for places here, teized for pensions there, and courted every where. I know you pity me. Yes, I see you do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Excuse me, sir. Toils of empires pleasures are, as Waller says.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>The modern poet of that name, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, a modern! We men of business despise the mo∣derns; and as for the ancients, we have no time to read them. Poetry is a pretty thing enough for our wives and daughters; but not for us. Why now, here I stand that know nothing of books. I say, madam, I know nothing of books; and yet, I believe, upon a land carriage fishery, a stamp act, or a jag-hire, I can talk my two hours without feeling the want of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>The world is no stranger to Mr. Lofty's eminence in every capacity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I vow to gad, madam, you make me blush. I'm nothing, nothing, nothing in the world; a mere ob∣scure gentleman. To be sure, indeed, one or two of the present ministers are pleased to represent me as a formidable man. I know they are pleased to be-spatter me at all their little dirty levees. Yet, upon my foul, I wonder what they see in me to treat me so! Measures, not men, have always been my mark; and I vow, by all that's honourable, my resentment has never done the men, as mere men, any manner of harm—that is as mere men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What importance, and yet what modesty!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, if you talk of modesty, madam! there I own, I'm accessible to praise: modesty is my foible: it was so, the duke of Brentford used to say of me. I love
<PB N="135" REF="136"/>
Jack Lofty, he used to say: no man has a finer know∣ledge of things; quite a man of information; and when he speaks upon his legs, by the Lord he's prodi∣gious, he scouts them; and yet all men have their faults; too much modesty is his, says his grace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, I dare say, you don't want assurance when you come to solicit for your friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, there indeed I'm in bronze. Apropos, I have just been mentioning miss Richland's case to a cer∣tain personage; we must name no names. When I ask, I am not to be put off, madam. No, no, I take my friend by the button. A sine girl, sir; great jus∣tice in her case. A friend of mine. Borough interest. Business must be done, Mr. Secretary. I say, Mr. Se∣cretary, her business must be done, sir. That's my way, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me! you said all this to the secretary of state, did you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not say the secretary, did I? Well, curse it, since you have found me out I will not deny it. It was to the secretary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was going to the fountain head at once, not applying to the understrappers, as Mr. Honeywood would have had us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honeywood! he! he! He was, indeed, a fine so∣licitor. I suppose you have heard what has just hap∣pened to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="136" REF="137"/>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor dear man; no accident, I hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undone, madam, that's all. His creditors have taken him into custody. A prisoner in his own house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>A prisoner in his own house! How! At this very time! I'm quite unhappy for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so am I. The man, to be sure, was immense∣ly good-natur'd. But then I could never find that he had any thing in him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>His manner, to be sure, was excessive harmless; some, indeed, thought it a little dull. For my part, I always concealed my opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>It can't be concealed, madam; the man was dull, dull as the last new comedy! A poor impracticable creature! I tried once or twice to know if he was fit for business; but he had scarce talents to be groom∣porter to an orange barrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>How differently does miss Richland think of him! For, I believe, with all his faults, she loves him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Loves him! Does she? You should cure her of that by all means. Let me see; what if she were sent to him this instant, in his present doleful situa∣tion? My life for it, that works her cure. Distress is a perfect antidote to love. Suppose we join her in the next room? Miss Richland is a fine girl, has a fine fortune, and must not be thrown away. Upon my honour, madam, I have a regard for miss Richland;
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
and, rather than she should be thrown away, I should think it no indignity to marry her myself. <STAGE>[Exeunt.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter OLIVIA and LEONTINE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, trust me, Olivia, I had every reason to expect miss Richland's refusal, as I did every thing in my power to deserve it. Her indelicacy surprises me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, Leontine, there's nothing so indelicate in be∣ing sensible of your merit. If so, I fear, I shall be the most guilty thing alive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you mistake, my dear. The same attention I used to advance my merit with you, I practised to les∣sen it with her. What more could I do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us now rather consider what's to be done. We have both dissembled too long—I have always been ashamed—I am now quite weary of it. Sure I could never have undergone so much for any other but you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you shall find my gratitude equal to your kind∣est compliance. Tho' our friends should totally for∣sake us, Olivia, we can draw upon content for the de∣ficiencies of fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why should we defer our scheme of humble happiness, when it is now in our power? I may be the favourite of your father, it is true; but can it ever be thought, that his present kindness to a supposed child, will continue to a known deceiver?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="138" REF="139"/>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have many reasons to believe it will. As his at∣tachments are but few, they are lasting. His own marriage was a private one, as ours may be. Be∣sides, I have sounded him already at a distance, and find all his answers exactly to our wish. Nay, by an expression or two that dropped from him, I am indu∣ced to think he knows of this affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! But that would be an happiness too great to be expected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>However it be, I'm certain you have power over him; and am persuaded, if you informed him of our situation, that he would be disposed to pardon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had equal expectations, Leontine, from your last scheme with miss Richland, which you find has succeeded most wretchedly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that's the best reason for trying another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it must be so, I submit.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>As we could wish, he comes this way. Now, my dearest Olivia, be resolute. I'll just retire within hear∣ing, to come in at a proper time, either to share your danger, or confirm your victory. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>Yes, I must forgive her; and yet not too easily, neither. It will be proper to keep up the decorums

<P>How I tremble to approach him!—Might I pre∣sume, sir—If I interrupt you—</P>

<P>No, child, where I have an affection, it is not a little thing can interrupt me. Affection gets over lit∣tle things.</P>

<P>Sir, you're too kind. I'm sensible how ill I deserve this partiality. Yet, heaven knows, there is nothing I would not do to gain it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you have but too well succeeded, you little hussey, you. With those endearing ways of yours, on my conscience, I could be brought to forgive any thing, unless it were a very great offence indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But mine is such an offence—When you know my guilt—Yes, you shall know it, tho' I feel the greatest pain in the confession.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, if it be so very great a pain, you may spare yourself the trouble; for I know every syllable of the matter before you begin.</P>

<P>Indeed! Then I'm undone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, miss, you wanted to steal a match, without letting me know it, did you! But, I'm not worth being consulted, I suppose, when there's to be a marriage in my own family. No, I'm to have no hand in the disposal of my own children. No, I'm
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
nobody. I'm to be a mere article of family lumber; a piece of crack'd china to be stuck up in a corner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear sir, nothing but the dread of your authority could induce us to conceal it from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, my consequence is no more; I'm as little minded as a dead Russian in winter, just stuck up with a pipe in his mouth till there comes a thaw—It goes to my heart to vex her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was prepared, sir, for your anger, and despaired of pardon, even while I presumed to ask it. But your severity shall never abate my affection, as my punish∣ment is but justice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you should not despair neither, Livy. We ought to hope all for the best.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you permit me to hope, sir! Can I ever ex∣pect to be forgiven! But hope has too long deceived me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, child, it shan't deceive you now, for I forgive you this very moment. I forgive you all; and now you are indeed my daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>O transport! This kindness overpowers me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was always against severity to our children. We have been young and giddy ourselves, and we can't ex∣pect boys and girls to be old before their time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>What generosity! But can you forget the many falsehoods, the dissimulation—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It shall be my future care never to put such genero∣sity to a second trial. And as for the partner of my offence and folly, from his native honour, and the just sense he has of his duty, I can answer for him that—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter LEONTINE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Permit him thus to answer for himself. <STAGE>(<HI>Kneeling.</HI>)</STAGE> Thus, sir, let me speak my gratitude for this unme∣rited forgiveness. Yes, sir, this even exceeds all your former tenderness: I now can boast the most indulgent of fathers. The life he gave, compared to this, was but a trifling blessing.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, good sir, who sent for you, with that fine tragedy face, and flourishing manner? I don't know what we have to do with your gratitude upon this occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, sir! Is it possible to be silent, when so much obliged! Would you refuse me the pleasure of being grateful! of adding my thanks to my Olivia's! of sharing in the transports that you have thus occa∣sioned?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Lord, sir, we can be happy enough, without your coming in to make up the party. I don't know what's

the matter with the boy all this day; he has got into such a rhodomontade manner all this morning!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, sir, I that have so large a part in the benefit, is it not my duty to shew my joy? Is the being ad∣mitted to your favour so slight an obligation? Is the happiness of marrying my Olivia so small a blessing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Oh! your honour; I hope your honour takes no∣thing amiss as I does, as I does nothing but my duty in so doing. I'm sure no man can say I ever give a gentleman, that was a gentleman, ill usage.

<P>Ay, sir, it's a perfect treasure. I love to see a gentleman with a tender heart. I don't know, but I think I have a tender heart myself. If all that I have lost by my heart was put together, it would make a—but no matter for that.</P>

<P>Humanity, sir, is a jewel. It's better than gold. I love humanity. People may say, that we, in our way, have no humanity; but I'll shew you my hu∣manity this moment. There's my follower here, little Flanigan, with a wife and four children, a guinea or two would be more to him, than twice as much to another.

<P>Why, madam, they do—occasionally serve in the fleet, madam. A dangerous service!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I'm told so. And I own, it has often surprised me, that, while we have had so many instances of bravery there, we have had so few of wit at home to praise it.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, Mr. Honeywood, this does not convince me but that severity in criticism is necessary. It was our first adopting the severity of French taste, that has brought them in turn to taste us.</P>

<SPEAKER>BAILIFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Taste us! By the Lord, madam, they devour us. Give monseers but a taste, and I'll be damn'd but they come in for a bellyful.</P>

<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very extraordinary this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOLLOWER.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! the vulgar rogues; all will be out. <STAGE>(<HI>Aside.</HI>)</STAGE> Right, gentlemen, very right, upon my word, and quite to the purpose.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' I don't see the force of the parallel, yet, I'll own, that we should sometimes pardon books, as we do our friends, that have now and then agreeable ab∣furdities to recommend them.</P>

<P>That's all my eye. The king only can pardon, as the law says: for, set in case—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm quite of your opinion, sir. I see the whole drift of your argument. Yes, certainly, our presum∣ing to pardon any work, is arrogating a power that belongs to another. If all have power to condemn, what writer can be free?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm obliged to you, sir, for the hint. If, madam, as my friend observes, our laws are so careful of a gentle∣man's person, sure we ought to be equally careful of his dearer part, his fame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOLLOWER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but if so be a man's nabb'd, you know—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Flanigan, if you spoke for ever, you could not improve the last observation. For my own part, I think it conclusive.</P>

<SPEAKER>BAILIFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for the matter of that, mayhap—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, sir, give me leave in this instance to be posi∣tive. For, where is the necessity of censuring works without genius, which must shortly sink of themselves? what is it, but aiming our unnecessary blow against a victim already under the hands of justice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Justice! O, by the elevens, if you talk about jus∣tice, I think I am at home there: for, in a course of law—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GARNET.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so they are. But I wonder, madam, that the lawyer you just employed to pay his debts, and set him free, has not done it by this time. He ought at least to have been here before now. But lawyers are always more ready to get a man into troubles, than out of them.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter SIR WILLIAM.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>For miss Richland to undertake setting him free, I own, was quite unexpected. It has totally unhinged my schemes to reclaim him. Yet, it gives me plea∣sure to find, that, among a number of worthless friend∣ships, he has made one acquisition of real value; for there must be some softer passion on her side that prompts this generosity. Ha! here before me: I'll endeavour to sound her affections. Madam, as I am the person that have had some demands upon the gen∣tleman of this house, I hope you'll excuse me, if, be∣fore I enlarged him, I wanted to see yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>The precaution was very unnecessary, sir. I sup∣pose your wants were only such as my agent had power to satisfy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="154" REF="155"/>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Partly, madam. But, I was also willing you should be fully apprized of the character of the gentleman you intended to serve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must come, sir, with a very ill grace from you. To censure it, after what you have done, would look like malice; and, to speak favourably of a character you have oppressed, would be impeaching your own. And sure, his tenderness, his humanity, his universal friendship, may atone for many faults.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>That friendship, madam, which is exerted in too wide a sphere, becomes totally useless. Our bounty, like a drop of water, disappears when diffused too widely. They, who pretend most to this universal benevolence, are either deceivers, or dupes. Men who desire to cover their private ill-nature, by a pre∣tended regard for all; or, men who, reasoning them∣selves into false feelings, are more earnest in pursuit of splendid, than of useful virtues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am surprised, sir, to hear one, who has probably been a gainer by the folly of others, so severe in his censure of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever I may have gained by folly, madam, you see I am willing to prevent your losing by it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your cares for me, sir, are unnecessary. I always suspect those services which are denied where they are wanted, and offered, perhaps, in hopes of a refusal. No, sir, my directions have been given, and I insist upon their being complied with.</P>

<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou amiable woman! I can no longer contain the expressions of my gratitude: my pleasure. You see before you one, who has been equally careful of his interest; one, who has for some time been a con∣cealed spectator of his follies, and only punished, in hopes to reclaim them—his uncle!</P>

<P>Don't make any apologies, madam. I only find myself unable to repay the obligation. And yet, I have been trying my interest of late to serve you. Having learnt, madam, that you had some demands upon government, I have, tho' unasked, been your so∣licitor there.</P>

<P>My dear madam, what can a private man like me do? One man can't do every thing; and then, I do so much in this way every day: let me see; some∣thing considerable might be done for him by subscrip∣tion; it could not fail if I carried the list. I'll under∣take to set down a brace of dukes, two dozen lords, and half the lower house, at my own peril.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>At his wit's end, I believe: he's scarce gotten out of one scrape, but he's running his head into another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="161" REF="162"/>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>The house has but just been cleared of the bai∣liffs, and now he's again engaging tooth and nail in assisting old Croaker's son to patch up a clandestine match with the young lady that passes in the house for his sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ever busy to serve others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, any body but himself. The young couple, it seems, are just setting out for Scotland; and he sup∣plies them with money for the journey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Money! how is he able to supply others, who has scarce any for himself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, there it is: he has no money, that's true; but then, as he never said no to any request in his life, he has given them a bill, drawn by a friend of his upon a merchant in the city, which I am to get changed; for you must know that I am to go with them to Scotland myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems the young gentleman is obliged to take a different road from his mistress, as he is to call upon an uncle of his that lives out of the way, in order to prepare a place for their reception, when they return; so they have borrowed me from my master, as the properest person to attend the young lady down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>To the land of matrimony! A pleasant journey, Jarvis.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but I'm only to have all the fatigues on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="162" REF="163"/>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, it may be shorter, and less fatiguing, than you imagine. I know but too much of the young lady's family and connexions, whom I have seen abroad. I have also discovered that miss Richland is not indif∣ferent to my thoughtless nephew; and will endeavour, tho' I fear, in vain, to establish that connexion. But, come, the letter I wait for must be almost finished; I'll let you further into my intentions, in the next room. <STAGE>[Exeunt.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, sure the devil's in me of late, for run∣ning my head into such defiles, as nothing but a ge∣nius like my own could draw me from. I was for∣merly contented to husband out my places and pensions with some degree of frugality; but, curse it, of late I have given away the whole Court Register in less time than they could print the title page: yet, hang it, why scruple a lie or two to come at a fine girl, when I every day tell a thousand for nothing. Ha! Honey∣wood here before me. Could miss Richland have set him at liberty?</P>
<STAGE>Enter HONEYWOOD.</STAGE>
<P>Mr. Honeywood, I'm glad to see you abroad again. I find my concurrence was not necessary in your unfor∣tunate affairs. I had put things in a train to do your bu∣siness; but it is not for me to say what I intended doing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="163" REF="164"/>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was unfortunate indeed, sir. But what adds to my uneasiness is, that while you seem to be acquainted with my misfortune, I, myself, continue still a stran∣ger to my benefactor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! not know the friend that served you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can't guess at the person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Inquire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have; but all I can learn is, that he chuses to re∣main concealed, and that all inquiry must be fruitless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Must be fruitless?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Absolutely fruitless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I'll be damn'd if you shall ever know it from me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose now, Mr. Honeywood, you think my rent-roll very considerable, and that I have vast sums of money to throw away; I know you do. The world to be sure says such things of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>The world, by what I learn, is no stranger to your generosity. But where does this tend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="164" REF="165"/>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>To nothing; nothing in the world. The town, to be sure, when it makes such a thing as me the subject of conversation, has asserted, that I never yet patro∣nized a man of merit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard instances to the contrary, even from yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, Honeywood, and there are instances to the contrary, that you shall never hear from myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! dear sir, permit me to ask you but one question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, ask me no questions: I say, sir, ask me no questions; I'll be damn'd, if I answer them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will ask no further. My friend! my benefactor, it is, it must be here, that I am indebted for freedom, for honour. Yes, thou worthiest of men, from the beginning I suspected it, but was afraid to return thanks; which, if undeserved, might seem reproaches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I protest I don't understand all this, Mr. Honey∣wood. You treat me very cavalierly. I do assure you, sir.—Blood, sir, can't a man be permitted to en∣joy the luxury of his own feelings, without all this parade?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, do not attempt to conceal an action that adds to your honour. Your looks, your air, your manner, all confess it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Confess it, sir! Torture itself, sir, shall never bring me to confess it. Mr. Honeywood, I have
<PB N="165" REF="166"/>
admitted you upon terms of friendship. Don't let us fall out; make me happy, and let this be buried in oblivion. You know I hate ostentation; you know I do. Come, come, Honeywood, you know I always loved to be a friend, and not a patron. I beg this may make no kind of distance between us. Come, come, you and I must be more familiar—Indeed we must.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens! Can I ever repay such friendship! Is there any way! Thou best of men, can I ever return the obligation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A bagatelle, a mere bagatelle. But I see your heart is labouring to be grateful. You shall be grateful. It would be cruel to disappoint you.</P>

<P>How! Teach me the manner. Is there any way?</P>

<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens! was ever any thing more unfortunate! It is too much to be endured.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unfortunate indeed! And yet I can endure it, till you have opened the affair to her for me. Between ourselves, I think she likes me. I'm not apt to boast, but I think she does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! But, do you know the person you ap∣ply to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I know you are her friend and mine: that's enough. To you, therefore, I commit the success of my passion. I'll say no more, let friendship do the rest. I have only to add, that if at any time my little inte∣rest can be of service—but, hang it, I'll make no promises—you know my interest is yours at any time. No apologies, my friend, I'll not be answered, it shall be so. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Open, generous, unsuspecting man! He little thinks that I love her too; and with such an ardent passion!—But then it was ever but a vain and hopeless one; my torment, my persecution! What shall I do! Love, friendship, a hopeless passion, a deserving friend! Love, that has been my tormentor; a friend, that has, perhaps, distressed himself, to serve me. It shall be so. Yes, I will discard the fondling hope
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>
from my bosom, and exert all my influence in his favour. And yet to see her in the possession of an∣other!—Insupportable! But then to betray a gene∣rous, trusting friend!—Worse, worse!

<P>Not a stick, madam—all's here. Yet I wish you could take the white and silver to be married in. It's the worst luck in the world, in any thing but white. I knew one Bett Stubbs, of our town, that was

married in red; and, as sure as eggs is eggs, the bride∣groom and she had a miff before morning.</P>

<P>Death and destruction! Are all the horrors of air, fire and water to be levelled only at me! Am I only to be singled out for gunpowder-plots, combustibles and conflagration!

'With speed.' O, confound your speed. But let me read it once more. <STAGE>(<HI>Reads.</HI>)</STAGE> 'Muster Croaker as as sone as yoew see this leve twenty gunnes at the bar of the Talboot tell caled for or yowe and yower ex∣peretion will be al blown up.'

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, sir, you have alarmed them so often already, we have nothing but earthquakes, famines, plagues and mad dogs from year's end to year's end. You remem∣ber, sir, it is not above a month ago, you assur'd us of a conspiracy among the bakers, to poison us in our bread; and so kept the whole family a week upon po∣tatoes.</P>
</SP>

<P>And potatoes were too good for them. But why do I stand talking here with a girl, when I should be fa∣cing the enemy without? Here, John, Nicodemus, search the house. Look into the cellars, to see if there be any combustibles below; and above, in the apart∣ments, that no matches be thrown in at the windows.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND, alone.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can he mean by all this? Yet, why should I inquire, when he alarms us in this manner almost every day! But Honeywood has desired an inter∣view with me in private. What can he mean? or, rather, what means this palpitation at his approach! It is the first time he ever shewed any thing in his conduct that seemed particular. Sure he cannot mean to—but he's here.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I presumed to solicit this interview, madam, before I left town, to be permitted—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! Leaving town, sir?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, madam; perhaps the kingdom. I have pre∣sumed, I say, to desire the favour of this interview,—in order to disclose something which our long friend∣ship prompts. And yet my fears—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="175" REF="176"/>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>His fears! What are his fears to mine! <STAGE>(<HI>Aside.</HI>)</STAGE> We have indeed been long acquainted, sir; very long. If I remember, our first meeting was at the French ambassador's.—Do you recollect how you were pleas∣ed to rally me upon my complexion there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly, madam: I presumed to reprove you for painting: but your warmer blushes soon convinced the company, that the colouring was all from nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you only meant it, in your good-natured way, to make me pay a compliment to myself. In the same manner you danced that night with the most aukward woman in company, because you saw nobody else would take her out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and was rewarded the next night, by dancing with the finest woman in company, whom every body wished to take out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, sir, if you thought so then, I fear your judg∣ment has since corrected the errors of a first impres∣sion. We generally shew to most advantage at first. Our sex are like poor tradesmen, that put all their best goods to be seen at the windows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first impression, madam, did indeed deceive me. I expected to find a woman with all the faults of conscious flattered beauty. I expected to find her vain and insolent. But every day has since taught me that it is possible to possess sense without pride, and beauty without affectation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="176" REF="177"/>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, sir, is a style very unsual with Mr. Honey∣wood; and I should be glad to know why he thus at∣tempts to encrease that vanity, which his own lessons have taught me to despise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ask pardon, madam. Yet, from our long friend∣ship, I presumed I might have some right to offer, without offence, what you may refuse without offend∣ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir! I beg you'd reflect; tho', I fear, I shall scarce have any power to refuse a request of yours; yet you may be precipitate: consider, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own my rashness; but, as I plead the cause of friendship, of one who loves—Don't be alarmed, ma∣dam—who loves you with the most ardent passion; whose whole happiness is placed in you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear, sir, I shall never find whom you mean, by this description of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, madam, it but too plainly points him out; tho' he should be too humble himself to urge his pre∣tensions, or you too modest to understand them.</P>
</SP>

<P>Well; it would be affectation any longer to pretend ignorance; and I will own, sir, I have long been pre∣judiced in his favour. It was but natural to wish to make his heart mine, as he seemed himself ignorant of its value.</P>

happy is my friend, to be the favourite of one with such sense to distinguish merit, and such beauty to re∣ward it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your friend, sir! What friend?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>He, sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he, madam. He is, indeed, what your warm∣est wishes might have formed him. And to his other qualities, he adds that of the most passionate regard for you.</P>

<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amazement!—No more of this, I beg you, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see your confusion, madam, and know how to in∣terpret it. And, since I so plainly read the language of your heart, shall I make my friend happy, by com∣municating your sentiments?</P>
</SP>

<P>Excuse me; I must; I know you desire it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Honeywood, let me tell you, that you wrong my sentiments and yourself. When I first applied to your friendship, I expected advice and assistance; but, now, sir, I see that it is vain to expect happiness from him, who has been so bad an oeconomist of his own; and that I must disclaim his friendship, who ceases to be a friend to himself. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is this! she has confessed she loved him, and yet she seemed to part in displeasure. Can I have done any thing to reproach myself with? No; I be∣lieve not: yet, after all, these things should not be done by a third person; I should have spared her con∣fusion. My friendship carried me a little too far.</P>

<P>Ha, ha, ha! and so, my dear, it's your supreme pleasure to give me no better consolation?</P>

<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Positively, my dear; what is this incendiary stuff and trumpery to me? Our house may travel thro' the air like the house of Loretto, for aught I care, if I'm to be miserable in it.</P>

<P>And so your good humour advises me to part with my money? Why then, to tell your good humour a piece of my mind, I'd sooner part with my wife. Here's Mr. Honeywood, see what he'll say to it. My dear Honeywood, look at this incendiary letter drop∣ped at my door. It will freeze you with terror; and yet lovey here can read it—can read it, and laugh.</P>

<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and so will Mr. Honeywood.</P>

<P>Speak, Mr. Honeywood; is there any thing more foolish than my husband's fright upon this occasion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would not become me to decide, madam; but doubtless, the greatness of his terrors, now, will but in∣vite them to renew their villainy another time.</P>

<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you, he'd be of my opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, sir! do you maintain that I should lie down under such an injury, and shew, neither by my tears, or complaints, that I have something of the spirit of a man in me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, sir. You ought to make the loudest complaints, if you desire redress. The surest way to have redress, is to be earnest in the pursuit of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="180" REF="181"/>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, whose opinion is he of now?</P>
</SP>

<P>But don't you think that laughing off our fears is the best way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the best, madam, few can say; but I'll main∣tain it to be a very wise way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we're talking of the best. Surely the best way is to face the enemy in the field, and not wait till he plunders us in our very bed-chamber.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, sir, as to the best, that—that's a very wise way too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can any thing be more absurd, than to double our distresses by our apprehensions, and put it in the power of every low fellow, that can scrawl ten words of wretched spelling, to torment us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt, nothing more absurd.</P>
</SP>

<P>How! would it not be more absurd to despise the rattle till we are bit by the snake?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt, perfectly absurd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are of my opinion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Entirely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you reject mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="181" REF="182"/>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens forbid, madam. No, sure, no reasoning can be more just than yours. We ought certainly to despise malice if we cannot oppose it, and not make the incendiary's pen as fatal to our repose as the highway∣man's pistol.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! then you think I'm quite right?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>A plague of plagues, we can't be both right. I ought to be sorry, or I ought to be glad. My hat must be on my head, or my hat must be off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, in two opposite opinions, if one be per∣fectly reasonable, the other can't be perfectly right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why may not both be right, madam: Mr. Croaker in earnestly seeking redress, and you in waiting the event with good humour? Pray, let me see the letter again. I have it. This letter requires twenty guineas to be left at the bar of the Talbot inn. If it be indeed an incendiary letter, what if you and I, sir, go there; and, when the writer comes to be paid his expected booty, seize him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear friend, it's the very thing; the very thing. While I walk by the door, you shall plant yourself in ambush near the bar; burst out upon the miscreant like a masqued battery; extort a confession at once, and so hang him up by surprise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but I would not chuse to exercise too much severity. It is my maxim, sir, that crimes generally punish themselves.</P>

no questions. To be sure, we had a sweet little cou∣ple set off from this two days ago for the same place. The gentleman, for a taylor, was, to be sure, as fine a spoken taylor, as ever blew froth from a full pot.

<P>May every thing you do prove as fortunate. In∣deed, Leontine, we have been most cruelly disap∣pointed. Mr. Honeywood's bill upon the city has, it seems, been protested, and we have been utterly at a loss how to proceed.</P>

<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, all's out; I now see the whole affair: my son is either married, or going to be so, to this lady, whom he imposed upon me as his sister. Ay, certainly so; and yet I don't find it afflicts me so much as one might think. There's the advantage of fretting away our misfortunes beforehand, we never feel them when they come.</P>

<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>My maid assured me he was come to this inn, and my own knowledge of his intending to leave the king∣dom, suggested the rest. But what do I see, my guar∣dian here before us! Who, my dear, sir, could have have expected meeting you here? to what accident do we owe this pleasure?</P>

<P>Why, Mr. Honeywood brought me here, to do nothing, now I am here; and my son is going to be married to I don't know who, that is here: so now you are as wise as I am.</P>

<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, sir, I can inform you; and, tho' a stranger, yet you shall find me a friend to your family: it will be enough, at present, to assure you, that, both in point of birth and fortune, the young lady is at least your son's equal. Being left by her father, sir James Woodville—</P>

<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir James Woodville! What, of the west?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Being left by him, I say, to the care of a merce∣nary wretch, whose only aim was to secure her fortune to himself, she was sent into France, under pretence of education; and there every art was tried to fix her for life in a convent, contrary to her inclinations. Of this I was informed, upon my arrival at Paris; and,
<PB N="194" REF="195"/>
as I had been once her father's friend, I did all in my power to frustrate her guardian's base intentions. I had even meditated to rescue her from his authority, when your son stept in with more pleasing violence, gave her liberty, and you a daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I intend to have a daughter of my own chusing, sir. A young lady, sir, whose fortune, by my inter∣est with those that have interest, will be double what my son has a right to expect. Do you know Mr. Lofty, sir?</P>

<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Obstinate man, still to persist in his outrage! Insult∣ed by him, despis'd by all, I now begin to grow con∣temptible, even to myself. How have I sunk by too great an assiduity to please! How have I overtax'd all my abilities, lest the approbation of a single fool should escape me! But all is now over; I have survived my reputation, my fortune, my friendships, and nothing remains henceforward for me but solitude and repent∣ance.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it true, Mr. Honeywood, that you are setting off, without taking leave of your friends? The report is, that you are quitting England. Can it be?</P>

<PB N="195" REF="196"/>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, madam; and tho' I am so unhappy as to have fallen under your displeasure, yet, thank Heaven, I leave you to happiness; to one who loves you, and deserves your love; to one who has power to procure you affluence, and generosity to improve your enjoy∣ment of it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are you sure, sir, that the gentleman you mean is what you describe him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have the best assurances of it, his serving me. He does indeed deserve the highest happiness, and that is in your power to confer. As for me, weak and waver∣ing as I have been, obliged by all, and incapable of serving any, what happiness can I find but in solitude? What hope but in being forgotten?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>A thousand! to live among friends that esteem you, whose happiness it will be to be permitted to oblige you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, madam; my resolution is fix'd. Inferiority among strangers is easy; but among those that once were equals, insupportable. Nay, to shew you how far my resolution can go, I can now speak with calm∣ness of my former follies, my vanity, my dissipation, my weakness. I will even confess, that, among the number of my other presumptions, I had the insolence to think of loving you. Yes, madam, while I was pleading the passion of another, my heart was tortur'd with its own. But it is over, it was unworthy our friendship, and let it be forgotten.</P>

<P>Yes, sir, I believe you'll be amazed, if, after wait∣ing some time in the anti-chamber, after being survey∣ed with insolent curiosity by the passing servants, I was at last assured, that sir William Honeywood knew no such person, and I must certainly have been im∣posed upon.</P>

<P>Ay, sir, too well I see it; and I can't but say I have had some boding of it these ten days. So, I'm resolved, since my son has placed his affections on a lady of moderate fortune, to be satisfied with his choice, and not run the hazard of another Mr. Lofty, in helping him to a better.</P>

<P>Excuse me, sir, if I interrupt your thanks, as I have here an interest that calls me. <STAGE>(<HI>Turning to</HI> Honeywood.)</STAGE> Yes, sir, you are surprised to see me; and I own that a desire of correcting your follies led me hither. I saw, with indignation, the errors of a mind that only sought applause from others; that easiness of disposition, which, though inclined to the right, had not courage to condemn the wrong. I saw, with regret, those splendid errors, that still took name from some neigh∣bouring duty. Your charity, that was but injustice; your benevolence, that was but weakness; and your friendship, but credulity. I saw, with regret, great talents and extensive learning, only employed to add sprightliness to error, and encrease your perplexities. I saw your mind with a thousand natural charms: but, the greatness of its beauty served only to heighten my pity for its prostitution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cease to upbraid me, sir: I have for some time but too strongly felt the justice of your reproaches. But there is one way still left me. Yes, sir, I have determined

this very hour, to quit for ever a place where I have made myself the voluntary slave of all; and to seek among strangers that fortitude which may give strength to the mind, and marshal all its dissipated virtues. Yet, ere I depart, permit me to solicit favour for this gentleman; who, notwithstanding what has happened, has laid me under the most signal obligations. Mr. Lofty—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Honeywood, I'm resolved upon a reformation, as well as you. I now begin to find, that the man who first invented the art of speaking truth was a much cun∣ninger fellow than I thought him. And, to prove that I design to speak truth for the future, I must now assure you, that you owe your late enlargement to an∣other; as, upon my soul, I had no hand in the mat∣ter. So now if any of the company has a mind for preferment, he may take my place, I'm determined to resign. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<L>For as a play'r, I can't squeeze out one drop:</L>

<STAGE>Enter MRS. HARDCASTLE and MR. HARDCASTLE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I VOW, Mr. Hardcastle, you're very particular. Is there a creature in the whole country, but ourselves, that does not take a trip to town now and then, to rub off the rust a little? There's the two miss Hoggs, and our neighbour, Mrs. Grigsby, go to take a month's polishing every winter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and bring back vanity and affection to last them the whole year. I wonder why London cannot keep its own fools at home. In my time, the follies of the town crept slowly among us, but now they travel faster than a stage-coach. Its fopperies come down, not only as inside passengers, but in the very basket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="214" REF="213"/>
<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, your times were fine times, indeed; you have been telling us of them for many a long year. Here we live in an old rumbling mansion, that looks for all the world like an inn, but that we never see compa∣ny. Our best visitors are old Mrs. Oddfish, the cu∣rate's wife, and little Cripplegate, the lame dancing∣master: and all our entertainment your old stories of prince Eugene and the duke of Marlborough. I hate such old-fashioned trumpery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I love it. I love every thing that's old: old friends, old times, old manners, old books, old wine; and, I believe, Dorothy, <STAGE>(<HI>taking her hand</HI>)</STAGE> you'll own I have been pretty fond of an old wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Mr. Hardcastle, you're for ever at your Do∣rothy's and your old wife's. You may be a Darby, but I'll be no Joan, I promise you. I'm not so old as you'd make me, by more than one good year. Add twenty to twenty, and make money of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me see; twenty added to twenty, makes just fifty and seven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's false, Mr. Hardcastle: I was but twenty when I was brought to bed of Tony, that I had by Mr. Lumpkin, my first husband; and he's not come to years of discretion yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor ever will, I dare answer for him. Ay, you have taught him finely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter, Tony Lumpkin has a good fortune. My son is not to live by his learning. I don't think a
<PB N="215" REF="214"/>
boy wants much learning to spend fifteen hundred a year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Learning, quotha! A mere composition of tricks and mischief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humour, my dear: nothing but humour. Come, Mr. Hardcastle, you must allow the boy a little hu∣mour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'd sooner allow him an horse-pond. If burning the footmens shoes, frighting the maids, and worry∣ing the kittens, be humour, he has it. It was but yesterday he fastened my wig to the back of my chair, and when I went to make a bow, I popt my bald head in Mrs. Frizzle's face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And am I to blame? The poor boy was always too sickly to do any good. A school would be his death. When he comes to be a little stronger, who knows what a year or two's Latin may do for him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Latin for him! A cat and fiddle. No, no, the ale∣house and the stable are the only schools he'll ever go to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, we must not snub the poor boy now, for I believe we shan't have him long among us. Any bo∣dy that looks in his face may see he's consumptive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, if growing too fat be one of the symptoms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He coughs sometimes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="216" REF="215"/>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, when his liquor goes the wrong way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm actually afraid of his lungs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And truly so am I; for he sometimes whoops like a speaking trumpet— <STAGE>(<HI>Tony hallooing behind the scenes</HI>)</STAGE> —O there he goes—A very consumptive figure, truly.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter TONY, crossing the stage.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tony, where are you going, my charmer? Won't you give papa and I a little of your company, lovee?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm in hastle, mother, I cannot stay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shan't venture out this raw evening, my dear: You look most shockingly.</P>

<P>I can't stay, I tell you. The three pigeons expects me down every moment. There's some fun going for∣ward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; the ale-house, the old place: I thought so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A low, paltry set of fellows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so low neither. There's Dick Muggins the exciseman, Jack Slang the horse doctor, little Amina∣dab that grinds the music box, and Tom Twist that spins the pewter platter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, my dear, disappoint them for one night at least.</P>
</SP>

<P>As for disappointing them, I should not so much mind; but I can't abide to disappoint myself.</P>

<P> <STAGE>(<HI>Detaining him</HI>)</STAGE> You shan't go.</P>

<P>I say you shan't.</P>

<P>We'll see which is strongest, you or I. <STAGE>[Exit, hawling her out.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE, solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, there goes a pair that only spoil each other. But is not the whole age in a combination to drive sense and discretion out of doors? There's my pretty darling Kate; the fashions of the times have almost infected her too. By living a year or two in town, she is as fond of gauze, and French frippery, as the best of them.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter MISS HARDCASTLE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blessings on my pretty innocence! drest out as usual, my Kate. Goodness! what a quantity of su∣perfluous silk has thou got about thee, girl! I could never teach the fools of this age, that the indigent world could be cloathed out of the trimmings of the vain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know our agreement, sir. You allow me the morning to receive and pay visits, and to dress in my
<PB N="218" REF="217"/>
own manner; and in the evening, I put on my house∣wife's dress to please you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, remember I insist on the terms of our agree∣ment; and, by the bye, I believe I shall have occa∣sion to try your obedience this very evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I protest, sir, I don't comprehend your meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, to be plain with you, Kate, I expect the young gentleman I have chosen to be your husband from town this very day. I have his father's letter, in which he informs me his son is set out, and that he intends to follow himself shortly after.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! I wish I had known something of this be∣fore. Bless me, how shall I behave? It's a thousand to one I shan't like him; our meeting will be so for∣mal, and so like a thing of business, that I shall find no room for friendship or esteem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon it, child, I'll never controul your choice; but Mr. Marlow, whom I have pitched upon, is the son of my old friend, sir Charles Mar∣low, of whom you have heard me talk so often. The young gentleman has been bred a scholar, and is designed for an employment in the service of his country. I am told he's a man of an excellent un∣derstanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very generous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="219" REF="218"/>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I shall like him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Young and brave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sure I shall like him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And very handsome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>May dear papa, say no more, <STAGE>(<HI>kissing his hand</HI>)</STAGE> he's mine, I'll have him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to crown all, Kate, he's one of the most bash∣ful and reserved young fellows in all the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh! you have frozen me to death again. That word reserved, has undone all the rest of his accom∣plishments. A reserved lover, it is said, always makes a suspicious husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the contrary, modesty seldom resides in a breast that is not enriched with nobler virtues. It was the very feature in his character that first struck me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He must have more striking features to catch me, I promise you. However, if he be so young, so handsome, and so every thing, as you mention, I be∣lieve he'll do still. I think I'll have him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Kate, but there is still an obstacle. It's more than an even wager, he may not have you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear papa, why will you mortify one so?—Well, if he refuses, instead of breaking my heart a
<PB N="220" REF="219"/>
his indifference, I'll only break my glass for its flatte∣ry. Set my cap to some newer fashion, and look out for some less difficult admirer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravely resolved! In the mean time I'll go prepare the servants for his reception; as we seldom see com∣pany they want as much training as a company of re∣cruits, the first day's muster. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE, sola.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lud, this news of papa's, puts me all in a flutter. Young, handsome; these he put last; but I put them foremost. Sensible, good-natured; I like all that. But then reserved, and sheepish, that's much against him. Yet can't he be cured of his timidity, by being taught to be proud of his wife? Yes, and can't I—But I vow I'm disposing of the husband, before I have secured the lover.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter MISS NEVILLE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm glad you're come, Neville, my dear. Tell me, Constance, how do I look this evening? Is there any thing whimsical about me? Is it one of my well looking days, child? am I in face to-day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly, my dear. Yet now I look again—bless me!—sure no accident has happened among the ca∣nary birds or the gold fishes. Has your brother or the cat been meddling? or has the last novel been too moving?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="221" REF="220"/>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; nothing of all this. I have been threatened—I can scarce get it out—I have been threatened with a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And his name—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is Marlow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The son of sir Charles Marlow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I live, the most intimate friend of Mr. Hastings, my admirer. They are never asunder. I believe you must have seen him when we lived in town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's a very singular character, I assure you. Among women of reputation and virtue, he is the modestest man alive; but his acquaintance give him a very dif∣ferent character among creatures of another stamp: you understand me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An odd character, indeed. I shall never be able to manage him. What shall I do? pshaw, think no more of him, but trust to occurrences for suc∣cess. But how goes on your own affair, my dear? has my mother been courting you for my brother Tony, as usual?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have just come from one of our agreeable tête-a-têtes. She has been saying a hundred tender things,
<PB N="222" REF="221"/>
and setting off her pretty monster as the very pink of perfection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And her partiality is such, that she actually thinks him so. A fortune like yours is no small temptati∣on. Besides, as she has the sole management of it, I'm not surprized to see her unwilling to let it go out of the family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fortune like mine, which chiefly consists in jewels, is no such mighty temptation. But at any rate if my dear Hastings be but constant, I make no doubt to be too hard for her at last. However, I let her suppose that I am in love with her son, and she never once dreams that my affections are fixed upon another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good brother holds out stoutly. I could almost love him for hating you so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a good-natured creature at bottom, and I'm sure would wish to see me married to any body but himself. But my aunt's bell rings for our afternoon's walk round the improvements. Allons. Courage is necessary as our affairs are critical.</P>

<P>You must not be so talkative, Diggory. You must be all attention to the guests. You must hear us talk, and not think of talking; you must see us drink, and not think of drinking; you must see us eat, and not think of eating.</P>
</SP>

<P>Welcome, gentlemen, very welcome. This way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>After the disappointments of the day, welcome once more, Charles, to the comforts of a clean room and a good fire. Upon my word, a very well-looking house; antique, but creditable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>The usual fate of a large mansion. Having first ruined the master by good housekeeping, it at last comes to levy contributions as an inn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you say, we passengers are to be taxed to pay all these fineries. I have often seen a good sideboard, or a marble chimney-piece, tho' not actually put in the bill, enflame a reckoning confoundedly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Travellers, George, must pay in all places. The only difference is, that in good inns, you pay dearly for luxuries; in bad inns, you are fleeced and starved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have lived pretty much among them. In truth, I have been often surprised, that you who have seen so much of the world, with your natural
<PB N="235" REF="234"/>
good sense, and your many opportunities, could ne∣ver yet acquire a requisite share of assurance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Englishman's malady. But tell me, George, where could I have learned that assurance you talk of? My life has been chiefly spent in a college, or an inn, in seclusion from that lovely part of the creation that chiefly teach men confidence. I don't know that I was ever familiarly acquainted with a single modest wo∣man—except my mother—But among females of ano∣ther class you know—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, among them you are impudent enough of all conscience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are of <HI>us,</HI> you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But in the company of women of reputation I ne∣ver saw such an idiot, such a trembler; you look for all the world as if you wanted an opportunity of steal∣ing out of the room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why man that's because I do want to steal out of the room. Faith, I have often formed a resolution to break the ice, and rattle away at any rate. But I don't know how, a single glance from a pair of fine eyes has totally overset my resolution. An impudent fellow may counterfeit modesty, but I'll be hanged if a modest man can ever counterfeit impudence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you could but say half the fine things to them that I have heard you lavish upon the bar-maid of an inn, or even a college bed-maker—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="236" REF="235"/>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, George, I can't say fine things to them; they freeze, they petrify me. They may talk of a comet, or a burning mountain, or some such baga∣telle. But to me, a modest woman, drest out in all her finery, is the most tremendous object of the whole creation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! At this rate, man, how can you ever expect to marry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never, unless, as among kings and princes, my bride were to be courted by proxy. If, indeed, like an eastern bridegroom, one were to be introduced to a wife he never saw before, it might be endured. But to go through all the terrors of a formal court∣ship, together with the episode of aunts, grand∣mothers and cousins, and at last to blurt out the broad staring question of, Madam, will you marry me? No, no, that's a strain much above me I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pity you. But how do you intend behaving to the lady you are come down to visit at the request of your father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I behave to all other ladies. Bow very low. Answer yes, or no, to all her demands—But for the rest, I don't think I shall venture to look in her face, till I see my father's again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm surprised that one who is so warm a friend can be so cool a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="237" REF="236"/>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be explicit, my dear Hastings, my chief induce∣ment down was to be instrumental in forwarding your happiness, not my own. Miss Neville loves you, the family don't know you, as my friend you are sure of a reception, and let honour do the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Marlow! But I'll suppress the emotion. Were I a wretch, meanly seeking to carry off a for∣tune, you should be the last man in the world I would apply to for assistance. But miss Neville's person is all I ask, and that is mine, both from her deceased father's consent, and her own inclination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Happy man! You have talents and art to capti∣vate any woman. I'm doom'd to adore the sex, and yet to converse with the only part of it I despise. This stammer in my address, and this aukward pre∣possessing visage of mine, can never permit me to soar above the reach of a milliner's 'prentice, or one of the duchesses of Drury-lane. Pshaw! this fellow here to interrupt us.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter HARDCASTLE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen, once more you are heartily welcome. Which is Mr. Marlow? Sir, you're heartily welcome. It's not my way, you see, to receive my friends with my back to the fire.

<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg, Mr. Marlow, you'll use no ceremony in this house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy, George, you're right: the first blow is half the battle. I intend opening the campaign with the white and gold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Marlow—Mr. Hastings—gentlemen—pray be under no constraint in this house. This is Liberty∣hall, gentlemen. You may do just as you please here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, George, if we open the campaign too fierce∣ly at first, we may want ammunition before it is over. I think to reserve the embroidery to secure a retreat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your talking of a retreat, Mr. Marlow, puts me in mind of the duke of Marlborough, when we went to besiege Denain. He first summoned the garrison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you think the ventre dor waistcoat will do with the plain brown?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He first summoned the garrison, which might con∣sist of about five thousand men—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="239" REF="238"/>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think not: brown and yellow mix but very poorly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say, gentlemen, as I was telling you, he sum∣moned the garrison, which might consist of about five thousand men—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>The girls like finery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which might consist of about five thousand men, well appointed with stores, ammunition, and other implements of war. Now, says the duke of Marl∣borough, to George Brooks, that stood next to him—You must have heard of George Brooks—I'll pawn my dukedom, says he, but I take that garrison with∣out spilling a drop of blood. So—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, my good friend, if you gave us a glass of punch in the mean time, it would help us to carry on the siege with vigour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Punch, sir! <STAGE>(<HI>Aside</HI>)</STAGE> This is the most unaccountable kind of modesty I ever met with.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>From the excellence of your cup, my old friend, I suppose you have a good deal of business in this part of the country. Warm work, now and then, at elections, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, sir, I have long given that work over. Since our betters have hit upon the expedient of electing each other, there is no business 'for us that sell ale.'</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, then you have no turn for politics I find.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least. There was a time, indeed, I fretted myself about the mistakes of government, like other people; but finding myself every day grow more angry, and the government growing no better, I left it to mend itself. Since that, I no more trouble my head about Heyder Ally, or Ally Cawn, than about Ally Croaker. Sir, my service to you.</P>

<SPEAKER>HASTINGS, solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I find this fellow's civilities begin to grow trou∣blesome. But who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him? Ha! what do I see? Miss Neville, by all that's happy!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter MISS NEVILLE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Hastings! To what unexpected good fortune? to what accident, am I to ascribe this happy meeting?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rather let me ask the same question, as I could never have hoped to meet my dearest Constance at an inn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="246" REF="245"/>
<SPEAKER>MISS NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An inn! sure you mistake! My aunt, my guardian, lives here. What could induce you to think this house an inn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>My friend, Mr. Marlow, with whom I came down, and I, have been sent here as to an inn, I assure you. A young fellow whom we accidentally met at a house hard by directed us hither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly it must be one of my hopeful cousin's tricks, of whom you have heard me talk so often, ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>He whom your aunt intends for you? he of whom I have such just apprehensions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have nothing to fear from him, I assure you. You'd adore him if you knew how heartily he de∣spises me. My aunt knows it too, and has undertaken to court me for him, and actually begins to think she has made a conquest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou dear dissembler! You must know, my Con∣stance, I have just seized this happy opportunity of my friend's visit here to get admittance into the fa∣mily. The horses that carried us down are now fatigued with their journey, but they'll soon be re∣freshed; and then, if my dearest girl will trust in her faithful Hastings, we shall soon be landed in France, where even among slaves the laws of marriage are respected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="247" REF="246"/>
<SPEAKER>MISS NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often told you, that, though ready to obey you, I yet should leave my little fortune behind with reluctance. The greatest part of it was left me by my uncle, the India director, and chiefly consists in jewels. I have been for some time per∣suading my aunt to let me wear them. I fancy I'm very near succeeding. The instant they are put into my possession you shall find me ready to make them and myself yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perish the baubles! Your person is all I desire. In the mean time, my friend Marlow must not be let into his mistake. I know the strange reserve of his temper is such, that if abruptly informed of it, he would instantly quit the house before our plan was ripe for execution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how shall we keep him in the deception? Miss Hardcastle is just returned from walking; what if we still continue to deceive him?—This, this way— <STAGE>[They confer.</STAGE></P>

<STAGE>Enter MARLOW.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>The assiduities of these good people teize me be∣yond bearing. My host seems to think it ill manners to leave me alone, and so he claps not only himself but his old-fashioned wife on my back. They talk of coming to sup with us too; and then, I suppose, we are to run the gauntlet thro' all the rest of the fami∣ly.—What have we got here!—</P>

<P>Our mistresses, boy, miss Hardcastle and miss Ne∣ville. Give me leave to introduce miss Constance Neville to your acquaintance. Happening to dine in the neighbourhood, they called, on their return, to take fresh horses here. Miss Hardcastle has just stept into the next room, and will be back in an instant. Wasn't it lucky? eh!</P>

<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! but wasn't it the most fortunate thing in the world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes. Very fortunate—a most joyful en∣counter—But our dresses, George, you know are in disorder—What if we should postpone the happiness 'till to-morrow?—To-morrow at her own house—It will be every bit as convenient—and rather more respectful—To-morrow let it be. <STAGE>[Offering to go.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, sir. Your ceremony will displease her. The disorder of your dress will shew the ar∣dour of your impatience. Besides, she knows you are in the house, and will permit you to see her.</P>

<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P> <STAGE>(<HI>Aside</HI>)</STAGE> Now, for meeting my modest gentleman with a demure face, and quite in his own manner. <STAGE>(<HI>After a pause, in which he appears very uneasy and dis∣concerted.</HI>)</STAGE> I'm glad of your safe arrival, sir—I'm told you had some accidents by the way.</P>
</SP>

<P>Only a few madam. Yes, we had some. Yes, madam, a good many accidents, but should be sorry—madam—or rather glad of any accidents—that are so agreeably concluded. Hem!</P>

<P>I'm afraid you flatter, sir. You that have seen so much of the finest company can find little entertain∣ment in an obscure corner of the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P> <STAGE>(<HI>Gathering courage</HI>)</STAGE> I have lived, indeed, in the world, madam; but I have kept very little com∣pany. I have been but an observer upon life, ma∣dam, while others were enjoying it.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An observer, like you, upon life, were, I fear, dis∣agreeably employed, since you must have had much more to censure than to approve.</P>

<P>Pardon me, madam. I was always willing to be amused. The folly of most people is rather an object of mirth than uneasiness.</P>

<P> <STAGE>(<HI>To him</HI>)</STAGE> Bravo, bravo. Never spoke so well in your whole life. Well! Miss Hardcastle, I see that you and Mr. Marlow are going to be very good com∣pany. I believe our being here will but embarrass the interview.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P> <STAGE>(<HI>After a pause</HI>)</STAGE> But you have not been wholly an observer, I presume, sir: the ladies I should hope have employed some part of your addresses.</P>

<P>And that, some say, is the very worst way to obtain them.</P>

<P>Perhaps so, madam. But I love to converse only with the more grave and sensible part of the sex.—But I'm afraid I grow tiresome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, sir; there is nothing I like so much as grave conversation myself; I could hear it for ever. Indeed I have often been surprised how a man of sentiment could ever admire those light airy pleasures, where nothing reaches the heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean that in this hypocritical age there are few that do not condemn in public what they prac∣tise in private, and think they pay every debt to virtue when they praise it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, madam; those who have most virtue in their mouths, have least of it in their bosoms. But I'm sure I tire you, madam.</P>

my face the whole time. Yet the fellow, but for his unaccountable bashfulness, is pretty well too. He has good sense, but then so buried in his fears, that it fatigues one more than ignorance.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never there! You amaze me! From your air and manner, I concluded you had been bred all

your life either at Ranelagh, St. James's, or Tower Wharf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! Sir, you're only pleased to say so. We country persons can have no manner at all. I'm in love with the town, and that serves to raise me above some of our neighbouring rustics; but who can have a manner, that has never seen the Pan∣theon, the Grotto Gardens, the Borough, and such places where the nobility chiefly resort? All I can do, is to enjoy London at second-hand. I take care to know every tête-à-tête from the scandalous ma∣gazine, and have all the fashions, as they come out, in a letter from the two miss Rickets of Crooked∣lane. Pray how do you like this head, Mr. Hast∣ings?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Extremely elegant and degagée, upon my word, madam. Your friseur is a Frenchman, I suppose?</P>

<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, what signifies my dressing when I have such a piece of antiquity by my side as Mr. Hard∣castle: all I can say will never argue down a single button from his cloaths. I have often wanted him to throw off his great flaxen wig, and where he was bald, to plaister it over, like my lord Pately, with powder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right, madam; for, as among the ladies, there are none ugly, so among the men there are none old.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what do you think his answer was? Why, with his usual Gothic vivacity, he said I only wanted him to throw off his wig to convert it into a tête for my own wearing.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Intolerable! At your age you may wear what you please, and it must become you.</P>

<P>Pray, Mr. Hastings, what do you take to be the most fashionable age about town?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Some time ago, forty was all the mode; but I'm told the ladies intend to bring up fifty for the ensuing winter.</P>

<P>Seriously. Then I shall be too young for the fashion.</P>

<P>No lady begins now to put on jewels 'till she's past forty. For instance, miss there, in a polite

<P>WHAT could my old friend sir Charles mean by recommending his son as the modestest young man in town? To me he appears the most impudent piece of brass that ever spoke with a tongue. He has taken possession of the easy chair by the fire side already. He took off his boots in the parlour, and desired me to see them taken care of. I'm desirous to know how his impudence affects my daughter.—She will cer∣tainly be shocked at it.</P>

<P>And yet, Kate, I sometimes give you some cause, particularly when I recommended my modest gentle∣man to you as a lover to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You taught me to expect something extraordi∣nary, and I find the original exceeds the descrip∣tion.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>

<P>Mr. Marlow's: his mauvaise honte, his timidity struck me at the first sight.</P>

<P>Surprising! He met me with a respectful bow, a stammering voice, and a look fixed on the ground.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He met me with a loud voice, a lordly air, and a familiarity that made my blood freeze again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He treated me with diffidence and respect; cen∣sured the manners of the age; admired the pru∣dence of girls that never laughed; tired me with apologies for being tiresome; then left the room with a bow, and, madam, I would not for the world detain you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He spoke to me as if he knew me all his life before. Asked twenty questions, and never waited for an answer. Interrupted my best remarks with
<PB N="265" REF="264"/>
some silly pun, and when I was in my best story of the duke of Marlborough and prince Eugene, he asked if I had not a good hand at making punch. Yes, Kate, he asked your father if he was a maker of punch!</P>

<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>In one thing then we are agreed—to reject him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. But upon conditions. For if you should find him less impudent, and I more presuming; if you find him more respectful, and I more importu∣nate—I don't know—the fellow is well enough for a man—Certainly we don't meet many such at a horse race in the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we should find him so—But that's impossible. The first appearance has done my business. I'm sel∣dom deceived in that.</P>

<P>But how have you procured them from your mother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ask me no questions, and I'll tell you no fibs. I procured them by the rule of thumb. If I had not a key to every drawer in mother's bureau, how could I go to the alehouse so often as I do? An honest man may rob himself of his own at any time.</P>

<SP>

<P>I protest, child, you use me extremely ill. If you keep me at this distance, how is it possible you and I can be ever acquainted?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who wants to be acquainted with you? I want no such acquaintance, not I. I'm sure you did not treat miss Hardcastle that was here awhile ago in this obstropalous manner. I'll warrant me, before her you look'd dash'd, and kept bowing to the ground, and talk'd, for all the world, as if you was before a justice of peace.</P>

<P>O! then, sir, you are a favourite, I find, among the ladies?</P>

<P>Yes, my dear, a great favourite. And yet, hang me, I don't see what they find in me to follow. At the ladies club in town, I'm called their agreeable Rattle.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, madam. So I find this is your modest lover. This is your humble admirer that kept his eyes fixed on the ground, and only ador'd at humble distance. Kate, Kate, art thou not asham'd to deceive your fa∣ther so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never trust me, dear papa, but he's still the modest man I first took him for, you'll be convinced of it as well as I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="280" REF="279"/>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the hand of my body I believe his impudence is infectious! Didn't I see him seize your hand? Didn't I see him hawl you about like a milk-maid? and now you talk of his respect and his modesty, for∣sooth!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if I shortly convince you of his modesty, that he has only the faults that will pass off with time, and the virtues that will improve with age, I hope you'll forgive him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The girl would actually make one run mad! I tell you I'll not be convinced. I am convinced. He has scarcely been three hours in the house, and he has already encroached on all my prerogatives. You may like his impudence, and call it modesty. But my son-in-law, madam, must have very different qualifications.</P>

<P>Yes, yes. I have sent them to Marlow, who keeps the keys of our baggage. In the mean time, I'll go to prepare matters for our elopement. I have had the Squire's promise of a sresh pair of horses; and, if I should not see him again, will write him further directions. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>I wonder what Hastings could mean by sending me so valuable a thing as a casket to keep for him, when he knows the only place I have is the seat of a post-coach at an inn-door. Have you deposited the casket with the landlady, as I ordered you? Have you put it into her own hands?</P>

<P>Ha! ha! ha! They're safe however. What an unaccountable set of beings have we got amongst! This little bar-maid though runs in my head most strangely, and drives out the absurdities of all the rest of the family. She's mine, she must be mine, or I'm greatly mistaken.</P>

<P>Nothing, my dear, nothing. But I was in for a list of blunders, and could not help making you a subscriber. My stupidity saw every thing the wrong way. I mistook your assiduity for assurance, and your simplicity for allurement. But its over—This house I no more shew my face in.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, sir, I have done nothing to disoblige you. I'm sure I should be sorry to affront any gentleman who has been so polite, and said so ma∣ny civil things to me. I'm sure I should be sorry <STAGE>(<HI>pretending to cry</HI>)</STAGE> if he left the family upon my

<P>You shall hear. I first took them down Fea∣ther-bed-lane, where we stuck fast in the mud.

<P> <STAGE>(<HI>Joining their hunds</HI>)</STAGE> And I say so too. And, Mr. Marlow, if she makes as good a wife as she has a daughter, I don't believe you'll ever repent your bar∣gain. So now to supper. To-morrow we shall gather all the poor of the parish about us, and the mistakes of the night shall be crowned with a merry morn∣ing; so, boy, take her; and as you have been mistaken in the mistress, my wish is, that you may never be mistaken in the wife.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DR. GOLDSMITH.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WELL, having stoop'd to conquer with success,</L>
<L>And gain'd a husband without aid from dress,</L>
<L>Still as a bar-maid, I could wish it too,</L>
<L>As I have conquer'd him to conquer you:</L>
<L>And let me say, for all your resolution,</L>
<L>That pretty bar-maids have done execution.</L>
<L>Our life is all a play, compos'd to please,</L>
<L>"We have our exits and our entrances."</L>
<L>The first act shews the simple country maid,</L>
<L>Harmless and young, of ev'ry thing afraid;</L>
<L>Blushes when hir'd, and with unmeaning action,</L>
<L>"I hopes as how to give you satisfaction."</L>
<L><PB N="327" REF="326"/>
Her second act displays a livelier scene,—</L>
<L>Th' unblushing bar-maid of a country inn,</L>
<L>Who whisks about the house, at market caters,</L>
<L>Talks loud, coquets the guests, and scolds the waiters.</L>
<L>Next the scene shifts to town, and there she soars,</L>
<L>The chop-house toast of ogling connoisieurs.</L>
<L>On 'squires and cits she there displays her arts,</L>
<L>And on the gridiron broils her lover's hearts—</L>
<L>And as she smiles, her triumphs to compleat,</L>
<L>Even common councilmen forget to eat.</L>
<L>The fourth act shews her wedded to the 'squire,</L>
<L>And madam now begins to hold it higher;</L>
<L>Pretends to taste, at Operas cries caro,</L>
<L>And quits her Nancy Dawson, for Che Faro.</L>
<L>Doats upon dancing, and in all her pride,</L>
<L>Swims round the room, the Heinel of Cheapside:</L>
<L>Ogles and leers with artificial skill,</L>
<L>Till having lost in age the power to kill,</L>
<L>She sits all night at cards, and ogles at spadille.</L>
<L>Such, thro' our lives, the eventful history—</L>
<L>The fifth and last act still remains for me.</L>
<L>The bar-maid now for your protection prays,</L>
<L>Turns female Barrister, and pleads for Bays.</L>

<BYLINE>BY J. CRADDOCK, ESQ.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WELL—now all's ended—and my comrades gone,</L>
<L>Pray what becomes of mother's nonly son?</L>
<L>A hopeful blade!—in town I'll fix my station,</L>
<L>And try to make a bluster in the nation.</L>
<L>As for my cousin Neville, I renounce her,</L>
<L>Off—in a crack—I'll carry big Bett Bouncer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why should not I in the great world appear?</L>
<L>I soon shall have a thousand pounds a year;</L>
<L>No matter what a man may here inherit,</L>
<L>In London—'gad, they've some regard to spirit.</L>
<L>I see the horses prancing up the streets,</L>
<L>And big Bett Bouncer, bobs to all she meets;</L>
<L>Then hoikes to jiggs and pastimes ev'ry night—</L>
<L>Not to the plays—they say it a'n't polite;</L>
<L>To Sadler's-Wells perhaps, or Operas go,</L>
<L>And once by chance, to the roratorio.</L>
<L>Thus here and there, for ever up and down,</L>
<L>We'll set the fashions too, to half the town;</L>
<L>And then at auctions—money ne'er regard,</L>
<L>Buy pictures like the great, ten pounds a yard;</L>
<L>Zounds, we shall make these London gentry say,</L>
<L>We know what's damn'd genteel as well as they.</L>
