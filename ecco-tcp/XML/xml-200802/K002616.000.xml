<HEAD>The first <HI>Clause</HI> of a <HI>LETTER</HI> from the Lord Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> to the <HI>In∣cumbents</HI> of all <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>Chapels</HI> in his Diocese, concerning their not using any <HI>New Forms of Doxology,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is an Instance of your Care and Du∣ty, which I conceive my self at this time highly obliged to offer, and you to regard, as ne∣cessary for the Preservation of the very Foundations of our Faith. Some Persons seduced, I fear, by the strong Delusions of Pride and Self-conceit, have lately published new Forms of Doxology, entirely agreeable to those of some Ancient Hereticks, who impiously denied a Trinity of Persons in the Unity of the Godhead. I do therefore warn, and charge it upon your Souls, as you hope to obtain Mercy from God the Father, through the Merits of Jesus Christ our Lord, and by the Sanctification of the Holy Ghost, Three Persons and One God Blessed for ever, that you imploy your best Endeavours to pre∣vail with your several Flocks to have a great Ab∣horrence for the above mentioned new Forms, and particularly that you do not suffer the same to be used, either in your Churches, or in any Schools where you are able to prevent that most pernicious Abuse, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Mr. <HI>WHISTON</HI>'s <HI>Letter of</HI> Thanks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHO' I have not the Honour of being One of those Incumbents in your Lordship's Diocese, to whom you immediately direct your late Letter against the Use of <HI>New Forms of Doxology,</HI> &amp;c. Yet because I generally frequent one of your Parish Churches, where a <HI>New Form of Doxo∣logy</HI> is every Day used; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Histo∣rical Pref. Edit. 2. p.128.—131.</NOTE> where yet, accord∣ing to your Lordship's laudable Admonition, I dissent from that <HI>New Form of Doxology,</HI> and use an <HI>Old one;</HI> because I several Years ago at <HI>Cambridge</HI> oppos'd that <HI>New,</HI> and there¦fore, by the same excellent Rule, unjustifi∣able <HI>Form of Doxology,</HI> I cannot but think it very fit for me to own the great Pleasure your Lordship's Caution against <HI>New Forms of Doxology</HI> has given me; and in my own Name, and in the Name of many other good Christians, who, with me, reject all such <HI>New Forms of Doxology</HI> whatsoever, I return your Lordship this Publick Thanks for your so open Approbation of our Conduct in this Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4"/>
I take it here for granted, My Lord, that your Lordship is in earnest in this Letter; that by <HI>New Forms of Doxology</HI> therein dis∣approv'd, without any particular mention of the Forms themselves, you truly mean such as arose long since the beginning of the Gos∣pel; That also by <HI>New Forms of Doxology, in∣tirely agreeable to those of some ancient He∣reticks,</HI> your Lordship particularly means those <HI>New Forms</HI> which were introduc'd by certain Hereticks in the fourth Century; tho' your Lordship seems indeed unhappily to have mistaken their Name and Character.</P>
<P>I take it also for granted, My Lord, that 'tis impossible for a Christian and a Protestant Bishop, both which your Lordship is known to be, to call the ancient and sacred Doxo∣logies of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> St. <HI>Peter,</HI> St. <HI>John,</HI> St. <HI>Jude,</HI> &amp;c. with those of the rest of the most pri∣mitive Christians, <HI>New Forms of Doxology, intirely agreeable to those of some ancient He∣reticks:</HI> And upon this reasonable Suppositi∣on, I do again return your Lordship my most hearty Thanks for so seasonable and Christi∣an a Caution against the modern gross, and notorious Corruption of this kind.</P>
<P>Now that this solemn Caution of your Lordship's against all <HI>New Forms of Doxo∣logy</HI> may have the greater regard paid to it by all the Clergy of your Diocese, I shall beg leave to supply what seems wanting in your Lordship's Letter, and shall produce here all the certainly genuine <HI>Forms of Dox∣ology,</HI> that, upon a former diligent Enquiry, I met with in the Apostolick Age, or a little later. And that your Lordship may be secure that none of them shall be liable to the lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> suspicion of favouring any dangerous Opini¦ons
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
that arose in the fourth Century, your Lordship will there find that the latest of them is near two hundred Years older than the rise of either the <HI>Arian</HI> or <HI>Athanasian</HI> He∣resies. And I hope this Account may be far∣ther useful to your Lordship's Clergy, as af∣fording them for Practice sure Original po∣sitive Rules or Forms of Doxology, free from all suspicion of <HI>Heretical Pravity;</HI> which also your Lordship has intirely omitted to give them in your Letter.</P>

<P><HI>Note</HI> here, (1) That <HI>Athanasius</HI>'s only Dox∣ology before the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> and not a few afterward also, were the same that has so long been called <HI>Arian;</HI> I mean that of <HI>in,</HI> and not <HI>to,</HI> or <HI>with</HI> the holy Spirit: And that <HI>Athanasius</HI> sometimes afterward used the one way of speaking as well as the other: Just as <HI>Basil</HI> did also; and as the present Copies of the Liturgy in the Eighth Book of the Consti∣tutions do still exhibit it to us: While it ap∣pears by other Evidence, and by <HI>Basil</HI>'s own Accounts, that no other than that esteemed the <HI>Arian</HI> Form of <HI>in the holy Spirit,</HI> can lay sure Claim to any publick Original, or sacred Authority in the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14"/>
<HI>Note,</HI> (2) That <HI>Basil</HI> has a full and remark∣able <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">De Spiritu Sancto ad Amphilochium.</NOTE> Discourse upon this Subject; a short Summary of which only, because of its length, I shall here give the Reader; as highly wor∣thy of his serious Consideration upon this Oc∣casion.</P>
<P><HI>Basil</HI> then was accused by those that dis∣liked the late Notions and Practices brought into the Church, that he had ventured to alter the old Christian Doxology, as to the Particle <HI>in,</HI> which used to be given to the holy Ghost; and that he often made use of <HI>and,</HI> or <HI>with</HI> in∣stead of it; as if Glory, and Honour, and A∣doration, were to be not only ascribed to the Father, and to the Son, <HI>in</HI> the holy Ghost, or by his Assistance, but also directly <HI>to</HI> the holy Ghost himself, as to a proper Object of Chri∣stian Adoration or Doxology. In answer to which he owns that the Form <HI>in</HI> the holy Ghost is indeed certainly the ancient and un∣doubted Christian Form of Doxology; and that he will sometimes make use of it still accordingly; that however the other Forms <HI>and</HI> or <HI>with,</HI> if they be not really genuine and original in Doxologies, which yet he would willingly insinuate, they have however been used upon other Occasions indifferently; that even in Doxologies he is not the first that has used those Particles, concerning the Holy Ghost; but that several great Men had done the like before him; at least since the begin∣ning of the third Century, as he proves by particular Instances; and that he therefore looks upon it as a piece of <HI>Arian</HI> or Heretical Inclination to be so scrupulous of keeping to this one old Particle <HI>in,</HI> out of Opposition to
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
those that would shew their Orthodoxy by the use of the other Particles, <HI>and</HI> or <HI>with</HI> the holy Ghost. This is the Purport of <HI>Basil</HI>'s Reason∣ing in this Case. And I own that if Pruden∣tials must govern, and Christians are at li∣berty to make themselves a new Object of direct Invocation or Doxology from remote Inferences of their own, and out of Compli∣ance with a prevailing Party, <HI>Basil</HI> may be in the right, as well as those that follow him in these Matters. But if Divine Worship is on∣ly to be given in such a Manner, and to such Objects, as Divine Institution ordains, He and all the <HI>Athanasians</HI> run a great Hazard in such Matters, and must have a heavy Account to give of this their rash and unjustifiable, and unchristian Procedure at the great Day. [Vid. <HI>Collection of Monuments, p.</HI> 124-126.]</P>
<P>The former Doxologies, My Lord, and many of the latter also are for certain the Old, the Christian, the Apostolical Doxologies; some Centuries before <HI>Arius</HI> or <HI>Arthanasius</HI> were known in the World; by which Men gave Glory, and Praise <HI>to</HI> God the Father, the Fountain and Origin of all Beings what∣soever; together <HI>with,</HI> or <HI>through</HI> the Media∣tion of Jesus Christ, his Only-begotten Son; and <HI>by</HI> the Aid and Assistance of his Holy Spi∣rit.</P>
<P>And that your Lordship does fully ap∣prove of this ancient way of Worship and Doxology, is plain by your own excellent and remarkable Words to the very same pur∣pose, which indeed describe exactly the man∣ner of Christian Worship in the three first Centuries, <HI>I do warn and charge it upon your Souls,</HI> says your Lordship to your Clergy, <HI>as you hope to obtain Mercy from God the Father, through the Merits of Jesus Christ our Lord,</HI>

<P>This, My Lord, seems to be the plain Pur¦port of the principal Branch of your Lord¦ship's Letter to your Clergy, in the Opinion of these Suspicious Persons; and this sets the Matter in so clear a Light, that I hope i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will be impossible to mistake it; and equally impossible to suspect that to be your Lord¦ship's Meaning, without supposing you to ac¦knowledge before all the World, that the

<P>I freely own, My Lord, the great Dignity of your Lordship's Episcopal Office; and can never be suspected by those that know me and my Opinions, of any wilful or criminal Disrespect thereto. I also heartily acknow∣ledge the great Regard that is justly due to the Pastoral Instructions of Christian Bishops, when they enforce any Parts of Christian Duty upon their Clergy or their Flocks; in which Case I should greatly rejoice to be any way instrumental in forwarding the same: But if, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stead thereof, the Sacred Episcopal Charac∣ter and Authority be used to discourage any Duties of Christianity, I and all sober Chri∣stians must constantly <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.
