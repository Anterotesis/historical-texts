<P>ENGLISH READINGS; A COMIC PIECE, IN ONE ACT.</P>

<P>AMONG the Performers to whom the Author of the following Dramatic Sketch esteems himself obliged for their en∣deavours to promote its success, MR. BAN∣NISTER, Junior, MR. WEWITZER, MR. MOSS, and MRS. WEBB, are entitled to his particular thanks.</P>
<P>Mr. COLMAN'S conduct respecting this lit∣tle Piece is its own panegyric. The first scenes were sent to that gentleman anonymously: he deemed them not destitute of merit, and there∣fore encouraged the Author to compleat the rest. Mr. COLMAN has since devoted the utmost care and attention to prepare the Piece for representation; and, in short, has interested himself warmly in its success, though the Author remains unknown to him.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="scene">
<HEAD><STAGE>SCENE. A Room in BOOTEKIN'S House.</STAGE></HEAD>
<STAGE>KITTY and Capt. WILMOT.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>PRAY let me alone, Captain Wilmot—you forget that you are making love to me instead of my mistress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Wilmot.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Why faith, Kitty, your beauty is so much a type of my dear Charlotte's, that, like a Roman Catholic, I almost adore the <HI>image</HI> for its likeness to the <HI>saint.</HI>"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Well," let us leave fooling—and consi∣der how you are to secure Miss Charlotte—You find her father, old Bootekin, is resolved to marry her to his nephew Bob.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Wilmot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I have a scheme to pre∣vent that.—But tell me, Kitty, how did this <HI>rage</HI> for English Readings reach a town so far from London?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Poplin, the Irish mantua-maker, who came down from London, introduced it—
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
You know from the moment that my master quit∣ted business, as a shoemaker in town, and came down here to live on his <HI>means,</HI> Mrs. Poplin and he cou'd never set their horses together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Wilmot.</SPEAKER>
<P>"I think they quarrel'd who shou'd have the best <HI>pew</HI> at church."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>"And ever since have been at open war.—Mrs. Poplin <HI>took the field</HI> by giving a ball; and tho' old Bootekin hates the sound of a fiddle, he let all the heavy-heel'd rustics in the neighbourhood <HI>right hand and left</HI> in our hall, till they made the house shake to its founda∣tion.—Next, the lady had card-parties;—deter∣min'd not to be behind-hand, the old man quitted his pipe and bottle for <HI>Loo</HI> and <HI>Pope Joan.</HI>"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Wilmot.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now the whim of burlesque∣ing a rational and elegant amusement—giving <HI>Readings,</HI> has seiz'd her ladyship—he is to have the same on a more extensive scale of absurdity—"as if resolv'd that all his follies, like the <HI>shadows</HI> of her's, shall not only keep pace with, but become <HI>larger</HI> than their <HI>originals.</HI>"</P>
<STAGE>Enter CHARLOTTE.</STAGE>
<P>Well, my dear Charlotte, what news?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charlotte.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father has just told me that I am to marry my hopeful cousin, Bob Bootekin, next week.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Wilmot.</SPEAKER>
<P>How unfortunate!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charlotte.</SPEAKER>
<P>How <HI>fortunate</HI> you mean—if he had left my choice free, ten to one if I shou'd have come to a resolution for this twelvemonth; but an attempt to force my inclinations drives me to a determination at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Wilmot.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Charming Charlotte!"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Take her at her word, Sir.—The cap∣tain
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
has got a ring and licence in his pocket, ma'am."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charlotte.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Aye—but then I shall be so closely watch'd."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Wilmot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll contrive to put them off their guard, and make this scheme of the <HI>Read∣ings</HI> turn to our advantage—"if we can but per∣suade your father to alter the place of exhibi∣tion from his own house to the large room at the George Inn."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush!—Lud, Miss Charlotte, here comes your father—and that booby, Dismal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Wilmot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I must e'en quit the field—but while I can carry off so charming a prize, <HI>retreat</HI> is victory.</P>
<STAGE>[Exeunt.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter BOOTEKIN and DISMAL.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold your tongue, sirrah!—and don't contradict me—you know I can't bear opposi∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dismal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, master, I have done—I'll say no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what signifies your <HI>saying</HI> no more—your cursed inflexible countenance has contradiction in every feature.—When I liv'd in London, I dreaded your appearance in the shop—the very sight of you put my customers in ill hu∣mour—and they then were sure to swear their shoes did not fit 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dismal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Lud! Oh Lud!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>"How often have I strapp'd you round the shop to cure your sour aspect?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dismal.</SPEAKER>
<P>"I remember it as well as if it was yesterday."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>"And yet, egad, let me strap you ever so often, I could never make you look
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
pleasant—But" pray now let us know, good Mr. Dismal, what are your objections to my <HI>Readings?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dismal.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part I never knew, till now, that you was so given to reading.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more I an't—I never read but two books in my life—my <HI>cash-book,</HI> and my <HI>jour∣nal</HI>—but I'm resolved to like reading now, from mere opposition—What the devil, an't I a bet∣ter gentleman, by a <HI>hundred</HI> a year, than any man in the neighbourhood?—and shall a paultry man∣tua-maker—a walking <HI>pincushion</HI>—a <HI>remnant</HI> of old tabby, pretend to give <HI>Readings,</HI> when I hardly know whether I can read or not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dismal.</SPEAKER>
<P>"She'll be too many for you yet—she vows she'll have the best <HI>pew</HI> at church to herself."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>"I tell you she shan't.—What a pro∣voking dog it is!"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dismal.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first time she can catch you ab∣sent from church, depend on't she'll fill the pew with her own family, and hang her footboy's hat upon your peg.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not be absent, I tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dismal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose you should be taken ill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I <HI>won't</HI> be taken ill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dismal.</SPEAKER>
<P>"But how can you help it?—She will certainly have the pew."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>"'Sblood! I'll go to church on Sun∣day-morning and afternoon, besides pray'r-days, I'll be <HI>damn'd</HI> if I dont."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dismal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—well—I hope all will turn out for the best—but suppose—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! I'll suppose nothing—Out of the room directly. <STAGE>[Pushing him.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dismal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps you'll think of my words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[pushes him out]</STAGE> Not if I can help it—they always give me the vapours.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter KITTY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, there is Mr. Stately, the great law∣yer, come to pay you a visit—he is just getting off his horse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Odd's so, Mr. Stately!—shew him up directly—Bless me, I'm vastly glad he's come.— <STAGE>[Exit Kitty]</STAGE> A formal old prig—has a scull with nothing in it but <HI>pride</HI>—and yet thinks all the world fools but himself—However, I expect something at his death, and so I must not quarrel with him.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter STATELY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Bootekin, I rejoice to see you look so well—tho' indeed I don't wonder at it—when I consider that you take so much exercise—it will do you good—you have been <HI>used</HI> to it—being a working man, I <HI>mean to say.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear friend, I heartily thank you for what you <HI>mean</HI> to say.—Well, and how d'ye do?—I suppose you are pretty well—I'm heartily glad of it—and so much for compliments.—Now, my dear Mr. Stately—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Perhaps I did not explain myself for <HI>you</HI> to understand me."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Yes, you did—and so let us proceed to business."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Bootekin, your ideas are confus∣ed—tho', indeed, how shou'd you have ideas—do you know what an idea is?—it is—I'll tell you an∣other time what it is—I studied the noble science of the law—it was at the bar I learnt to think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, you had leisure enough for <HI>thinking</HI> then—I believe you never had the trou∣ble to speak at the bar in your life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Explanation</HI> was always my motto.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE> "And it suits you just as badly as many other mottos suit those who adopt them."—I suppose you have heard how Mrs. Poplin has crow'd over me, because, forsooth, I can't jab∣ber gibberish out of a printed book as fast as she can—now is it not—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>Permit me to interrupt you—Reading you know—indeed I need not say <HI>you</HI> know—but <HI>I</HI> know—that reading—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Permit me to interrupt <HI>you</HI>—I only wish to ask you if my case is not a cursed hard one.—After working like a horse to get a fortune, I quitted business, and came down "here to smoke a comfortable pipe—walk about the green fields—look at the trees, and enjoy the pleasure of doing nothing—Well, down I came," and bought a large estate here, to make myself respected—and respected I was—"was com∣plimented by being made churchwarden imme∣diately on my arrival, and gave a feast to the parish"—the parson declared I spoke monstrous well at the vestry, and liked my company so well that he has <HI>dined</HI> with me three or four times a week—all my letters came directed to Robert Bootekin, Esquire—and the member for the coun∣ty shook me by the hand last election, when he came round to <HI>canvas.</HI>—"Nay, Sir Charles Courtly came down from London t'other day to dine with me, and apologize for not paying two hundred pounds he owes me."—Now I call <HI>this</HI> being respected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You</HI> may call it so, Mr. Bootekin—you have not much idea of respect—He! He!
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
He!—I don't mean to offend you—but give me leave to explain to you—it is my opinion—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! my dear friend, when you were in the law did you give opinions before the <HI>case</HI> was <HI>stated?</HI>—I was going to tell you, that since this Irish woman has set it about the town that I'm a vulgar dog, egad things begin to change—fellows in carters frocks and hob∣nail'd shoes contradict me at the vestry—the parson had the impudence to <HI>preach</HI> about the badness of my wine at my own table—and, egad, nobody in the place bow to me now but old women and children, and that's only when I give them halfpence—all because, forsooth, I'm a vulgar fellow.—Zounds! how can a man be vulgar with £.20,000 in his pocket?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye, Mr. Bootekin—I knew you in London—you made shoes for me many years—you are a well-meaning man, and I have a regard for you—but you have been brought up in a low way—and your ideas are confin'd—He! He! He! "Your arguments are loud and heavy, like a <HI>lap-stone</HI> dropt in a pond—they make a noise for a moment, and then sink in the mud—He! He! He!—sink in the mud"—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>"First raising circles in the pond, which, like your round-about explanations, be∣come wider of the mark every moment, 'till at last they leave no trace of what occasioned them." He! He! He! <STAGE>[Imitating him.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Bootekin, you are ignoramus, as we say in the courts, and therefore—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg pardon, Mr. Stately—I was too warm.— <STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE> Egad I shall lose the legacy.— <STAGE>[To him]</STAGE> I thank you much for the honour of
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
this visit—this afternoon I give my Readings—I'll convince you and all the world that I am not a vulgar fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be very happy to see it, Mr. Bootekin, He! He! He!—Pray, do you read yourself?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>No,—my nephew, Bob, to whom I gave my business, will read—he is a smart lad, I assure you—and very much of a gentleman, though <HI>I</HI> say it.— <STAGE>[Enter Kitty.]</STAGE>—Is Bob come home?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>This very moment, Sir—he desires to speak to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll introduce him to you, Mr. Stately, you'll be vastly pleas'd with him.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE> A mighty pretty girl, i'faith!—My dear, you seem in a hurry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had you any thing to say to me, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, yes, my dear, I should like to have something to say to you.— <STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE> If I could but tell what—but these girls are so apt to laugh at a middle-aged man, when he makes love to them, that I am half afraid to venture.— <STAGE>[To her]</STAGE> I suppose you have a sweetheart, my pretty maid?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, what should there be about me for people to fall in love with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! ho!—it will do.— <STAGE>[To her]</STAGE> Fall in love with you!—why, who could help it?—Come here, child—don't be afraid of <HI>me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh dear—no, Sir, I am not at all afraid of you—Ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE> There—now it won't do—she begins to laugh—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure, Sir, you are too good-na∣tur'd a gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear, you'll find me so.— <STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE> Egad, it <HI>will do</HI> after all. <STAGE>[To her]</STAGE> My sweet little Kitty, will you favour me so far as to—to— <STAGE>[Enter Bootekin and Bob Bootekin, who runs up to Stately, and shakes him by the hand]</STAGE>—to tell 'em to give my horse some corn?—do, my dear, go directly— <STAGE>[Exit Kitty.]</STAGE>— <STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE> To be inter∣rupted in such an interesting situation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I have the honour to be your most obedient, devoted, very humble servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Stately, this is my nephew, Bob.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>Young man, I hear you are an orator, I suppose you have classical learning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Classical learning!—Ho! ho! ho! Bless your ignorance—why I went through all the <HI>classes</HI>—but my genius was too great to remem∣ber any thing I learnt at school.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must explain to you, that without classical learning genius is but a kind of—a—a—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye—you mean to say 'tis all <HI>my eye.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>All</HI> my eye!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if you like it, I'll take t'other side of the question—'tis all the same to me—I'll engage to speak on any thing for a quarter of an hour at least—what say you to that, old gen∣tleman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Stately, pray excuse my ne∣phew's freedom of speech, he! he!— <STAGE>[Aside to Bob]</STAGE> At him again, Bob.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bob.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive, Sir, you have resided in the country lately—you must come to town and visit our disputing society—we have questions to suit every body, and I speak upon all questions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt, and with equal ability—
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
but, pray Sir, don't you find it necessary, some∣times, to understand your subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, Sir—I am a natural speaker—never study, but say whatever comes uppermost;—my opinion is, that a speech is a speech, if there are but words enough in it—and I am allowed to have the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of saying more in a given time than any speaker in the society.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose you talk faster.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Exactly so, Sir.—But, à-propos, I can give you a specimen or two of our questions—Let me see, where are my memorandums—Oh, here! The questions to be debated, as they stand in order on our list, are; First—Is war or peace best for this country?—we were favour'd with this question by a <HI>navy agent,</HI> and we expect it will produce a warm debate.—Second in the list stands the question, Whether the lady who has <HI>black, blue,</HI> or <HI>grey eyes,</HI> is likely to make the best wife?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very instructive and amusing specu∣lation—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bob.</SPEAKER>
<P>—Upon Charlotte's first introduction to Werter, did not she behave rather ungenteelly, in not offering him a dish of tea?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very material to be ascertained.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bob.</SPEAKER>
<P>The next—no, faith, the next question was debated last week, out of its turn, on ac∣count of its peculiar importance, and at the desire of several respectable members—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>What may that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is the tinker, the taylor, or the lamp∣lighter, the most useful member of society?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>"And how might it have been deter∣mined?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bob.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Why, Sir—as our advertisement in the newspapers next day very properly stated—this
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
question gave rise to a most important and in∣teresting debate, in which instruction was mingled with amusement.—The arguments were, from time to time, enliven'd by the most brilliant flashes of wit and humour from several gentlemen of the first-rate abilities, who ho∣nour'd the question with their attention—(by the bye, <HI>I</HI> was prodigiously great that night)—with their attention.—But the variety of mate∣rial points which presented for discussion pro∣tracting the debate to an unusual length, and the friends of the lamp-lighter (<HI>I</HI> supported him)—the friends of the lamp-lighter wishing for an opportunity of answering the arguments of their opponents, the debate was adjourned till next week."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, pray, young Mr. Bootekin, do you never touch on politics?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes, Sir,—politics are my forte—we had a most glorious debate the other day—Whether some great men ought not to lose their heads for not doing something?—but, egad, I forget what—however I supported the question, and beat Dick Dab hollow, though he sported a dozen Latin mottos, which he stole from the Spectators and Tatlers the day before—I sat down amidst a thunder of applause from hands, feet, and sticks:—in short, the minister totter'd—when, within ten minutes of the debate closing, in came a posse of treasury-runners, as we suspect, who by dint of coughing, laughing, and hooting, put a stop to the debate—a battle en∣sued between two ladies—the <HI>moderator</HI> flew into a <HI>violent passion</HI>—constables were sent for—and the debate ended—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>As most political disputes end—nei∣ther party giving up the point.—Well, I must go
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
and pay a few visits to some of my old ac∣quaintance—and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll be back time enough for our Readings—what d' ye think of Bob—is not his conversation vastly amusing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stately.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes—like the bells of a team of horses, it makes a pleasant jingling noise, though there is no meaning in it—He! he! he!—I don't mean to be severe, I assure you.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bob.</SPEAKER>
<P>A stupid old put!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stupid indeed!—I never knew him do but one sensible thing in his life—and that was putting my name down in his will.—But, Bob, you have not told me what preparations you have made for our Readings.</P>
</SP>
