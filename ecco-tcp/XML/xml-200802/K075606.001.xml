<HEAD>TO THE REVEREND THOMAS PERCY, D.D. DEAN OF CARLISLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>REV. SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN these MISCELLANIES are inscribed to a PERCY, I place them under the most auspicious shelter. THE RELIQUES OF ANCIENT POETRY, with which you obliged the world in your younger years, would, independent of all other claims, have pointed you out as a proper Patron to these Fugitive Remains. But, excellent as your own Publications are, it is neither to them, nor to your elevated Station in Life, that I pay this disinterested Tribute.</P>
<P>Happy in a Family Connexion, which, how∣ever remotely, entitles me to claim Relationship with the Poet CLEIVELAND (extracts from whose Works will add merit to a future volume
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
of this Collection); I am proud to have it known that the DEAN OF CARLISLE derives his descent from the same Family, his father's mother having been niece to the Bard above∣mentioned: a Family distinguished in private life for having produced a succession of most excellent Clergymen, treading in the steps of their venerable Ancestor, the Rev. THOMAS CLEIVELAND, father of the Poet, who is upon record<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See "Walker's Sufferings of the Clergy," p. 221.</NOTE> for his very worthy character and most exemplary life.</P>
<P>That urbanity, Sir, with which you recog∣nized me as of kin to you, and the Friendship I have since in consequence experienced from you, as they have made an indelible impression, demand the warm acknowledgements with which these volumes are most respectfully presented by,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Collection, though formed principally from that of Mr. DRYDEN, is by no means a mere republication; which would now have been particularly ill-timed, as a large portion of that excellent Miscellany (the first which appeared in this kingdom with reputation) is very properly arranged among the
"Works of the English Poets;" and some pages had crept into DRYDEN's Collection, which may be permitted to perish without regret.
There still, however, are an infinite number of small poems, which, coming under neither of these descriptions, must be allowed to possess con∣siderable merit; being the productions of men of real genius, who, from the brevity rather than the inferiority of their writings, have been usually styled "Minor Poets."</P>
<P>On DRYDEN's foundation the present super∣structure is begun. In its progress, almost every un∣dertaking of a similar nature has been consulted, and material parts incorporated. The Collections formed by FENTON and STEELE have been epitomized; whilst POPE's, PEMBERTON's, LINTOT's, and
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
C. TOOKE's, have occasionally contributed to embellishment.</P>
<P>The Collection by Mr. R. DODSLEY is allowed to be the completest of the kind; and with this the present publication is so far from interfering, that not a single poem is intended to be printed, which is either in "DODSLEY's Collection," the Supplement to it by Mr. PEARCH, or in the Sixty Volumes of the "English Poets." To all or either of these, therefore, this Selection will be a suitable appen∣dage; and the more so, as I have preserved some poems of merit, which before were not known to have existed.</P>
<P>The Reader will find in these volumes some of the earliest productions of DRYDEN; some originals by Sir WILLIAM TEMPLE; an Ode by SWIFT, which had long been considered as irrecoverable; a considerable number of good poems by STEELE, PARNELL, FENTON, BROOME, and YALDEN, with a few pieces by HALIFAX, DORSET, RO∣CHESTER, SPRAT, PRIOR<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following anecdotes of this excellent Poet being curious, I print them in the words of the friend from whom they are received:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"At lord Oxford's seat at Wimple (now lord Hardwicke's) there hung a fine picture of Harley in his Speaker's robes, with the roll of the bill in his hand for bringing-in the present family; which, if I mistake not, was done by his casting vote. In allusion to Harley's being afterwards sent to The Tower, Prior wrote with a pencil on the white scroll, <HI>Bill paid such a day.</HI>—The late Recorder of Cambridge [Pont] had seen some MS. Dialogues of the Dead of Prior's; they were prose, but had verse intermixed freely: and the specimen, I heard, proved it. The Dialogue was between Sir Thomas More and the Vicar of Bray. You must allow that the cha∣racters are well chosen; and the speakers maintain their respective opinions smartly: at last the Knight seems to come over to his adversary, at least so far as to allow that the doctrine was convenient, if not honourable; but that he did not see how any man could allow himself to act thus: when the Vicar concludes; Nothing easier, with proper management; &amp;c.
You must go the right way to work—
<Q><L>" For Conscience, like a fiery horse,</L>
<L>" Will stumble, if you check his course:</L>
<L>" But ride him with an easy rein,</L>
<L>" And rub him down with worldly gain,</L>
<L>" He'll carry you through thick and thin,</L>
<L>" Safe, although dirty, to your inn."</L></Q></Q>
This certainly is sterling sense.—It would give me great pleasure to be enabled to present these Dialogues to the world; but where they are now deposited is unknown.</NOTE>, POPE, BOLING-BROKE,
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
PHILIPS, KING, SMITH, WATTS, PITT, HUGHES, A. PHILIPS, and TICKELL, which are not to be found in any edition of their works.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9"/>The assistance of some intelligent friends has enabled me to add a biographical account of almost every Writer here selected; and their persuasions have induced me to lay before the publick FOUR VOLUMES, as part of the plan I have undertaken. Two others are actually in the press. There are still an infinite number of Collections, which, amidst a chaos of weeds, would afford a con∣siderable quantity of flowers well worth the trans∣planting. But the encouragement these meet with must determine whether the publication shall cease at the end of the SIXTH volume, or be extended still farther. Without any great idea of emolument, which in this case is far from being the principal object, I am unwilling to sacrifice the little leisure of a laborious life in a pursuit that I have not reason to think will in some small degree contribute to <Q REND="inline">"the public stock of harmless pleasure."</Q></P>
<P>To my concluding volume shall be annexed a complete POETICAL INDEX. In the mean time, for the convenience of the Reader, a short Index to the Notes will follow this Advertisement.</P>

<HEAD>SAPPHO TO PHAON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This epistle, after having appeared in a variety of collec∣tions, was placed at the beginning of Garth's edition of
"Ovid's Epistles, by several hands," 1720;
where it is followed by another translation of it by Mr. Pope; undertaken, as that great poet expressly says,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not from any supposed defect in Sir Carr's translation,"</Q> but because he had not taken the whole of the original.
N.</NOTE></HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE HON. SIR CARR SCROPE<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Son of Sir Adrian Scrope, of Cockrington in Lincoln∣shire, knight. He became a gentleman commoner of Wad∣ham College in 1664; was created a baronet Jan. 16, 1666; and took the degree of M.A. on the fourth of Fe∣bruary following. His poems are not numerous; consisting principally of translations and lampoons. In his
"Defence of Satire,"
we are told by Anthony Wood, there are reflec∣tions on,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"1. John earl of Rochester; 2. Edward Griffin; 3. Wroth the page; 4. Franc. Newport; 5. Lord Cul∣pepper; 6. Henry Savil; 7. James duke of Monmouth; 8. Tho. Armstrong; 9.—Loftus; 10. Brandon Ger∣rard; 11. Jermyn earl of St. Albans; 12. Finch lord chan∣cellor."</Q>
This produced, as might have been expected, the keenest resentment of Rochester (see his Poems, 1779, p. 340). Sir Carr translated the fourth elegy of Ovid's first book, and "The Parting of Sireno and Diana;" wrote the Prologue to Lee's "Rival Queens," and to
"The Man of Mode;" and several songs introduced into the plays of those times.
He died, in the parish of St. Martin in the Fields, in or about November, 1680. He is mentioned with respect by Dr. King, Poems, p. 271. Wood refers to a MS Song "on Scrope, Godolphin, and Dorset," in Mr. Sheldon's Library.
"The Parting of Sireno and Di∣ana," Wood says, was translated from the third book of Ovid's Elegies; but it is more probably from an Italian ori∣ginal.

<HEAD>THE PARTING OF SIRENO AND DIANA.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE SAME.</BYLINE>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Sireno and Diana having loved each other with a most violent passion, Sireno is compelled, upon the account of his master's service, to go for some time into a foreign country. The melancholy parting of the two lovers is the subject of the following eclogue.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<L>CLOSE by a stream, whose flowery bank might give</L>
<L>Delight to eyes that had no cause to grieve,</L>
<L>The sad Sireno sate, and fed his sheep,</L>
<L>Which now, alas! he had no joy to keep;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="24"/>Since his hard fate compell'd him to depart</L>
<L>From her dear sight, who long had charm'd his heart.</L>
<L>Fix'd were his thoughts upon the fatal day</L>
<L>That gave him first what this must take away;</L>
<L>Through all the story of his love he ran,</L>
<L>And nought forgot that might increase his pain.</L>
<L>Then with a sigh raising his heavy eyes,</L>
<L>Th' approach of his afflicted nymph he spies.</L>
<L>Sad as she was, she lost no usual grace,</L>
<L>But as she pass'd seem'd to adorn the place:</L>
<L>Thither she came to take her last farewell;</L>
<L>Her silent look did her sad business tell.</L>
<L>Under a neighbouring tree they sate them down,</L>
<L>Whose shade had oft preserv'd them from the sun;</L>
<L>Each took the other by the willing hand,</L>
<L>Striving to speak, but could no word command:</L>
<L>With mutual grief both were so overcome,</L>
<L>The much they had to say had made them dumb.</L>
<L>There many a time they two had met before,</L>
<L>But met, alas! upon a happier score:</L>
<L>Cruel reverse of fate, which all the joys</L>
<L>Their mutual presence us'd to bring destroys.</L>
<L>Sireno saw his fatal hour draw near,</L>
<L>And, wanting strength the parting pang to bear,</L>
<L>All drown'd in tears he gaz'd upon the maid,</L>
<L>And she with equal grief the swain survey'd;</L>
<L>Till his imprison'd passion forc'd its way,</L>
<L>And gave him leave faintly at last to say:</L>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIRENO.</SPEAKER>
<L>O my Diana! who would have believ'd</L>
<L>That when the sad Sireno most had griev'd,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="25"/>Any affliction could have fall'n on me</L>
<L>That would not vanish at the sight of thee?</L>
<L>Thy charming eyes could all my clouds dispel;</L>
<L>Let but Diana smile, and all was well.</L>
<L>Absent from thee, my soul no joy could know;</L>
<L>And yet, alas! I die to see thee now.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIANA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Turn, O Sireno! turn away thy face,</L>
<L>While all her shame a blushing maid betrays;</L>
<L>For though my eyes a secret pain reveal,</L>
<L>My tongue at least should my fond thoughts conceal:</L>
<L>Yet I would speak, could speaking do me good,</L>
<L>And since it is to thee, methinks it should.</L>
<L>O shepherd, think how wretched I shall be,</L>
<L>When hither I return depriv'd of thee!</L>
<L>When, sitting all alone within this shade,</L>
<L>Which thou so oft thy tender choice hast made,</L>
<L>I read my name engrav'd on every bark,</L>
<L>Of our past love the kind affecting mark;</L>
<L>Then my despairing soul to death nust fly;</L>
<L>And must thou be content to let me die?</L>
<L>Why dost thou weep? Alas! those tears are vain,</L>
<L>Since 'tis thy fault that both of us complain.</L>
<L>By this the falsehood of thy vows I know;</L>
<L>For, were thy sorrow true, thou would'st not go.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIRENO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Cease, cruel nymph, such killing language cease,</L>
<L>And let the poor Sireno die in peace.</L>
<L>Witness, ye everlasting powers above,</L>
<L>That never shepherd bore a truer love!</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="26"/>With thee I wish 't had been my happy doom,</L>
<L>With thee alone to spend my life to come;</L>
<L>That we now part, is by no fault of mine,</L>

<L>For, as no faith did ever mine excel,</L>
<L>So never any nymph deserv'd so well.</L>

<L>I must my joy, or else my honour, lose;</L>
<L>Should I to him deny th' allegiance due,</L>
<L>Thou might'st to thee think me disloyal too.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIANA.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, no, Sireno, now too late I find</L>
<L>How fond she is that can believe mankind;</L>
<L>Who such excuses for himself pretends,</L>
<L>Will easily bear the absence he defends.</L>
<L>A little time, I fear, will quite deface</L>
<L>Thy thoughts of me, to give another place:</L>
<L>Fool that I was my weakness to betray</L>
<L>To one not mov'd with all that I can say.</L>
<L>Go, cruel man, embark whene'er you please,</L>
<L>But take this with you as you pass the seas;</L>
<L>Though with the fiercest winds the waves should roar,</L>
<L>That tempest will be less than mine on shore.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIRENO.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis hard unjust suspicions to abide:</L>
<L>But who can such obliging anger chide?</L>
<L>Fair as thou art, that charm could never move</L>
<L>My heart to this degree, without thy love:</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="27"/>For 'tis thy tender sense of my sad fate,</L>
<L>That does my sharpest, deadliest pain create.</L>
<L>Ah fear not, to what place soe'er I go,</L>

<L>When for another I abandon thee,</L>
<L>May heaven, for such a crime, abandon me!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIANA.</SPEAKER>
<L>If ever I my dearest swain deceive,</L>
<L>Or violate the faith that here I give:</L>
<L>When to their food my hungry flocks I lead,</L>
<L>May the fresh grass still wither where they tread!</L>
<L>And may this river, when I come to drink,</L>
<L>Dry up as soon as I approach the brink!</L>
<L>Take here this bracelet of my virgin hair,</L>
<L>And when for me thou canst a minute spare,</L>
<L>Remember this poor pledge was once a part</L>
<L>Of her, who with it gave thee all her heart.</L>
<L>Where'er thou goest, may fortune deal with thee</L>
<L>Better than thou, alas! has dealt with me.</L>
<L>Farewell; my tears will give me leave to say</L>
<L>No more than this, to all the Gods I pray,</L>
<L>These weeping eyes may once enjoy thy sight,</L>
<L>Before they close in death's eternal night.</L>
</SP>

<L>Then let Sireno banish all his fears,</L>

<L>The righteous Gods, from whom our passion came,</L>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Simaetha is here introduced by the poet in love with one Delphis; and not having seen him in twelve days, and suspecting him to love some other woman, she, by the help of her maid Thestylis, endeavours by charms to reduce him.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>THE philtres, Thestylis, and charms prepare,</L>
<L>I'll try, since neither Gods nor Delphis hear,</L>
<L>If the false man, by me in vain belov'd,</L>
<L>Be charms, and arts more powerful, can be mov'd,</L>
<L>Twelve days, an age to me, alas! are past,</L>
<L>Since at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se doors he knock'd, or saw me last;</L>
<L>Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn'd and neglected, if I live, or no,</L>
<L>Inhuman as he is, he does not know.</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="35"/>To some new mistress sure he is inclin'd,</L>
<L>For love has wings, and he a changing mind.</L>
<L>To-morrow I'll to the Palaestra go,</L>
<L>And tell him he 's unkind to use me so.</L>
<L>Now to my charm: but you, bright queen of night,</L>
<L>Shine, and assist me with your borrow'd light,</L>
<L>You, mighty goddess, I invoke; and you</L>
<L>Infernal Hecate—</L>
<L>(When you ascend from the pale shades below</L>
<L>Through gaping tombs, and the divided ground,</L>
<L>A sudden horror seizes all around,</L>
<L>The dogs at your approach affrighted fly),</L>
<L>Assist, and with your powerful aid be nigh;</L>
<L>Inspire this charm, and may it prove as strong</L>
<L>As Circe's or the bold Medea's song!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bring back, ye sacred herbs, and powerful charms,</L>
<L>Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Throw meal upon the hallow'd flames: d' you stand</L>
<L>Insensible, you sot, when I command?</L>
<L>Or am I scorn'd, and grown a jest to you?</L>
<L>Strew salt, and say, thus Delphis' bones I strew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bring back, ye sacred herbs, and powerful charms,</L>
<L>Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As Delphis me, so I this laurel burn;</L>
<L>And as that burns, and does to ashes turn,</L>
<L>And cracks, and in a glorious light expires,</L>
<L>So may false Delphis burn in quicker fires!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bring back, ye sacred herbs, and powerful charms,</L>
<L>Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As the wax melts, which in the fire I cast,</L>
<L>So in love's slower flames may Delphis waste:</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="36"/>And as this wheel, with motion quick turn'd round,</L>
<L>Though seeming to go on, and quit its ground,</L>
<L>Returns, and in its magic circle still is found;</L>
<L>So, though averse, and fled from my embrace,</L>
<L>May he return, and still maintain his place!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bring back, ye sacred herbs, and powerful charms,</L>
<L>Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, Artemis, and aid me from above;</L>
<L>You all the stubborn powers below can move,</L>
<L>Th' infernal judges and th' infernal king:</L>
<L>Ring, Thestylis, the sounding brass, haste, ring.</L>
<L>She comes, the goddess comes; the dreadful cry</L>
<L>Of howling dogs gives notice she is nigh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bring back, ye sacred herbs, and powerful charms,</L>
<L>Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See! silent are the winds; a peaceful sleep</L>
<L>Has calm'd the raging seas, and smooth'd the deep:</L>
<L>But the rough tempest, that distracts my breast.</L>
<L>No calm can find, and will admit no rest.</L>
<L>O chastity, and violated same!</L>
<L>I burn for him whose love's my only shame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bring back, ye sacred herbs, and powerful charms.</L>
<L>Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus thrice I sacrifice, and thrice I pray</L>
<L>You execute, great goddess, what I say.</L>
<L>Whoe'er she be that shares his envied bed,</L>
<L>Proud by her conquest, and my ruin, made,</L>
<L>Her honour lost, and she und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, as I,</L>
<L>Deserted and abandon'd may she lie,</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="37"/>As did on Dia's shore the royal maid</L>
<L>By perjur'd Theseus' cruelty betray'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bring back, ye sacred herbs, and powerful charms,</L>
<L>Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hippomanes, but tasted, rage inspires,</L>
<L>And with new heat the winged coursers fires,</L>
<L>O'er fields and woods and mountains tops they go,</L>
<L>Their rage no bounds, and they no stop can know;</L>
<L>Such is the plant: and oh! that I might see</L>
<L>My Delphis with like rage run home to me!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bring back, ye sacred herbs, and powerful charms,</L>
<L>Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This fringe, which my lov'd Delphis once did wear,</L>
<L>This once dear relick thus enrag'd I tear:</L>
<L>How cruel is the love that leach-like drains</L>
<L>From my pale limbs the blood and empty veins!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bring back, ye sacred herbs, and powerful charms,</L>
<L>Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To-morrow a dire potion I'll compound;</L>
<L>Now, Thestylis, this philtre spread around</L>
<L>His fatal door—</L>
<L>(There all my thoughts and my lost senses dwell,</L>
<L>There, though ill us'd, my soul continues still)</L>
<L>And spit, and the ingrateful man de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove,</L>

<LG>
<L>She's gone; and since I now am left alone,</L>
<L>What shall I say? what first shall I bemoan?</L>
<L>What was the cause? whence sprung my ill-plac'd love?</L>
<L>Diana's rites can tell, and fatal grove;</L>

<L>Tell, silver Phoebe, tell whence sprung my flame,</L>

<L>The cruel man sat down upon my bed,</L>

<HEAD>ON MR. WALLER.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY SIR THOMAS HIGGONS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son of Dr. Thomas Higgons, some time rector of West∣burgh in Shropshire. He was born in that county; became a commoner of St. Albans Hall in the beginning of the year 1638, at the age of 14; when he was put under the tuition of Mr. Edward Corbet, fellow of Merton College, and lodged in the chamber under him in that house. Leaving the univer∣sity without a degree, he retired to his native county. He married the widow of Robert earl of Essex; and delivered an oration at her funeral, Sept. 16, 1656.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oratio sunebri, a marito ipso, more prisco laudata fuit,"</Q> is part of this lady's epitaph.
He married, secondly, Bridget daughter of Sir Be∣vil Greenvill of Stow, and sister to John earl of Bath; and removed to Grewell in Hampshire; was elected a burgess for Malmsbury in 1658, and for New Windsor in 1661. His services to the crown were rewarded with a pension of 500£. a year, and gifts to the amount of 4000£. He was afterwards knighted; and in 1669 was sent envoy extraordi∣nary to invest John George duke of Saxony with the order of the Garter. About four years after he was sent envoy to Vi∣enna, where he continued three years. In 1685 he was elected burgess for St. Germain's, "being then," says Wood,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"accounted a loyal and accomplished person, and a great lo∣ver of the regular clergy."</Q>
He died suddenly, of an apo∣plexy, in the king's-bench court, having been summoned there as a witness, November 24, 1691; and was buried in Winches∣ter cathedral near the relicks of his first wife. His literary productions are, 1. "A Panegyric to the King, 1660." fol. 2. "The Funeral Oration on his first Lady, 1656." 3.
"The History of Isoof Bassa, 1684."
He also translated into English "The Venetian Triumph;" for which he was com∣plimented by Waller, in his Poems, p. 113; who has also addressed a poem to <HI>Mrs.</HI> Higgons, p. 201. Mr. Granger, who styles Sir Thomas <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a gentleman of great merit,"</Q> was favoured by the dutchess dowager of Portland with a manu∣script copy of his Oration; and concludes, from the great scarcity of that pamphlet, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the copies of it were, for certain reasons, industriously collected and destroyed, though few pieces of this kind have less deserved to perish. The countess of Essex had a greatness of mind which enabled her to bear the whole weight of infamy which was thrown upon her; but it was, nevertheless, attended with a delicacy and sensibility of honour which poisoned all her enjoyments. Mr. Higgons had said much, and I think, much to the purpose, in her vin∣dication: and was himself fully convinced from the te∣nor of her life, and the words which the spoke at the awful close of it, that the was perfectly innocent.—In reading this interesting oration, I fancied myself standing by the grave of injured innocence and beauty; was sen∣sibly touched with the pious affection of the tenderest and best of husbands doing public and solemn justice to an ami∣able and worthy woman, who had been grossly and pub∣licly defamed. Nor could I with-hold the tribute of a tear; a tribute which, I am confident, was paid at her in∣terment by every one who loved virtue, and was not desti∣tute of the feelings of humanity. This is what I immedi∣ately wrote upon reading the oration. If I am wrong in my opinion, the benevolent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ader, I am sure, will forgive me. It is not the first time that my heart has got the better of my judgment."</Q>

<HEAD>TO THE DUKE, ON HIS RETURN. <DATE>1682.</DATE></HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY NATHANAEL LEE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This celebrated dramatic poet was the son of a clergy∣man, and bred at Westminster-school under the famous Dr. Busby, whence he removed to Trinity college in Cambridge; became scholar upon that foundation in 1668, and pro∣ceeded A.B. the same year; but not succeeding to a fellow∣ship, he quitted the university, and came to London, where he made an unsuccessful attempt to become an actor in 1672. The part he performed was Duncan in Sir William Dave∣nant's alteration of Macbeth. Failing in this design, he had recourse to his pen for a support, and, having a genius for the drama, he composed a tragedy called "Nero emperor of Rome," in 1675, which being well received, he pushed on the same way, producing a new play almost every year one with another, till 1681. Though unsuccessful in his performance on the stage, yet it is observed by Cibber, that he read his pieces with a degree of excellence which astonished the most ca∣pital actors of that age. Mr. Lee was not only careless in his oeconomy, a foible incident to the poetic race, but rakishly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ravagant: to that degree, as to be frequently plunged into the lowest depths of misery: his wit and genius were also of the same unlucky turn, turgid, unbridled, and apt to break the bounds of sense. Thus gifted by nature, he left the reins loose to his imagination, till at length indigence and poetical enthusiasm transported him into madness; so that, in November 1684, he was taken into Bedlam, where he continued four years under the care of the physicians. He was discharged in April 1688, being so much recovered as to be able to return to his occupation of writing for the stage. And he produced two plays afterwards,
"The Princess of Cleve," in 1689, and "The massacre of Paris," the fol∣lowing year.
However, notwithstanding the profits arising from these performances, he was this year reduced to so low <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n ebb, that a weekly stipend of ten shillings from the thea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re royal was his chief dependance. He was not so clear of his phrenzy, as not to suffer some temporary relapses, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erhaps his untimely end might be occasioned by one. He died this year, 1690, as it is said, in a drunken frolic, by night in the street, and was interred in the parish of St. Cle∣ment Danes, near Temple-bar. He is the author of eleven plays, all acted with applause, and printed as soon as finished, with dedications of most of them to the earls of Dorset, Mul∣grave, Pembroke, the duchesses of Portsmouth and Rich∣mond, as his patrons. Mr. Addison declares, that, among our modern English poets, there was none better turned for tragedy than our author, if, instead of favouring the impe∣tuosity of his genius, he had restrained it, and kept it within proper bounds. His thoughts are wonderfully suited to tra∣gedy, but frequently lost in such a cloud of words, that it is hard to see the beauty of them. There is an infinite fire in his works, but so involved in smoke, that it does not appear in half its lustre. He frequently succeeds in the passionate parts of the tragedy, but more particularly where he slackens his efforts, and eases the style of those epithets and meta∣phors in which he so much abounds.

He is said to be particularly a master in that art, and for that reason has been compared to Ovid among the ancients, and to Otway among the mo∣derns. Mr. Dryden prefixed a copy of commendatory verses to the Rival Queens, and our author joined with that laureat in writing the tragedy of the Duke of Guise and that of Oe∣dipus.

<HEAD>ARIADNE'S COMPLAINT, UPON A ROCK IN THE ISLAND OF NAXOS ON BEING DESERTED BY THESEUS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son of Thomas Cartwright, of Burford, in Oxfordshire, was born Aug. 16, 1615. This is the account given by Lloyd. But Wood, who may be supposed well-informed, says, he was the son of a gentleman of broken fortune, who was re∣duced to keep an inn at Cirencester, in Gloucestershire; was born at Northway, near Tewksbury, in September, 1611; and received the early part of his education at Cirencester Free-school: being placed as a king's scholar at Westminster, he was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1628, where he took the degree of M.A. in 1635. The same writer informs us,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he went through the classes of Logick and Philosophy with an unwearied industry, took holy orders, and became the most florid and scraphical preacher in the university. He was another Tully and Virgil, as being most excellent for Oratory and Poetry; in which faculties, as also in the Greek tongue, he was so full and absolute, that those that best knew him, knew not in which he most excelled. So admirably well versed also was he in Metaphysicks, that when he was Reader of them in the University, the ex∣position of them was never better performed than by him and his predecessor Thomas Barlow, of Queen's College. His preaching also was so graceful, and profound withal, that none of his time or age went beyond him. So that, if the Wits read his Poems, Divines his Sermons, and Philosophers his Lectures on Aristotle's Metaphysicks, they would scarcely believe that he died at a little above thirty years of age. But that which is most remarkable is, that these his high parts and abilities were accompanied with so much candour and sweetness, that they made him equally beloved and admired of all persons, especially those of the Gown and Court; who esteemed also his life a fair copy of practic piety, a rare example of heroic worth, and in whom Arts, Learning, and Language, made up the true complement of perfection."</Q>
In 1642 bishop Duppa ap∣pointed him to be succentor in the church of Salisbury, and in 1643 he was chosen junior proctor of the university. He was also metaphysical reader to the university. Ben Jonson said of him, <Q REND="inline">"My son Cartwright writes like a man!"</Q> There are extant, of this author's, four plays, besides other poems, which were printed together in 1651, accompanied by above fifty copies of commendatory verses by the wits of the university. A. Wood tells us, Mr. Cartwright wrote also, 1. Poëmata Graeca et Latina. 2. An offspring of mercy issuing out of the womb of cruelty: a passion sermon, preached at Christ Church in Oxford, on Acts ii. 23. 3. On the signal days in the month of November, in relation to the crown and royal family: a poem. 4. Poems and verses containing airs for several voices, set by Mr. Henry Lawes. His "Royal Slave" was acted before the king and queen by his fellow-students of Christ Church; of whom the most applauded was Mr. Busby, afterwards the celebrated master of Westminster school. Wit, learning, judgement, elocution, a graceful person and behaviour, occasioned that well-known encomium of him from dean Fell,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he was the utmost man could come to."</Q>
This instance of the perfection of human nature was also an instance of its vanity. He was suddenly snatched away by a fever, in the prime of life, on the twenty-ninth of November, 1643; and had the honour to be regretted by his sovereign and his queen, who were in Oxford at the time of his death. See Wood and Granger. Jacob says,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Cartwright was a king's scholar at Eton under Dr. Olbaston; eminent for learning and loyalty; an excellent scholar, and an admirable poet; expert in the Latin, Greek, French, and Italian languages.</Q>
The wits of Oxford prefixed recommendatory verses to his Works.—After such eulogiums, it seems a kind of poetical blasphemy to annex the opinion of Dr. King, who says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Cartwright's poems seem to me very indifferent!"</Q> N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<L>HECTOR, though warn'd by an approaching cry,</L>
<L>That to Troy walls the conquering Greeks drew nigh,</L>
<L>T' his princess one short visit pays in haste,</L>
<L>Some daemon told him this would be his last:</L>
<L>Her (swiftly passing through the spacious streets)</L>
<L>He nor at home nor in the circle meets,</L>
<L>Nor at Minerva's<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The temple of Minerva. C.</NOTE>, where the beauteous train</L>
<L>Made prayers and vows to angry powers in vain.</L>
<L><PB N="71" REF="84"/>She, half distracted with the loud alarms,</L>
<L>(The prince was carry'd in his nurse's arms)</L>
<L>Runs to a turret, whose commanding height</L>
<L>Presented all the battle to her sight,</L>
<L>Advancing Grecians, and the Trojans flight.</L>
<L>Here Hector finds her; with a lover's pace</L>
<L>She speeds, and breathless sinks in his embrace;</L>
<L>The nurse came after with her princely care,</L>
<L>As Hesperus, fresh, promising, and fair;</L>
<L>Hector in little, with paternal joy,</L>
<L>He blest in silent smiles the lovely boy.</L>
<L>The princess, at his sight compos'd again,</L>
<L>Pressing his hand, does gently thus complain:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My dearest lord, believe a careful wife,</L>
<L>You are too lavish of your precious life;</L>
<L>You foremost into every danger run,</L>
<L>Of me regardless, and your little son.</L>
<L>Shortly the Greeks, what none can singly do,</L>
<L>Will compass, pointing all the war at you.</L>
<L>But before that day comes, heavens! may I have</L>
<L>The mournful privilege of an early grave!</L>
<L>For I, of your dear company bereft,</L>
<L>Have no reserve, no second comfort left.</L>
<L>My father, who did in Cilicia reign,</L>
<L>By fierce Achilles was in battle slain:</L>
<L>His arms that savage conqueror durst not spoil,</L>
<L>But paid just honours to his funeral pile;</L>
<L>Wood-nymphs about his grave have planted since</L>
<L>A rural monument to a mighty prince.</L>
<L>Seven brothers, who seven legions did command,</L>
<L>Had the same fate, from the same murdering hand.</L>
<L><PB N="72" REF="85"/>My mother too, who their sad heir did reign,</L>
<L>With a vast treasure was redeem'd in vain,</L>
<L>For she soon clos'd her empire and her breath,</L>
<L>By wretches' last good fortune—sudden death.</L>
<L>Thus father, mother, brethren, all are gone;</L>
<L>But they seem all alive in you alone.</L>
<L>To gain you, those endearments I have sold,</L>
<L>And like the purchase—if the title hold.</L>
<L>Have pity then, here in this tower abide,</L>
<L>And round the walls and works your troops divide.</L>
<L>But row the Greeks, by both their generals led,</L>
<L>Ajax, Idomeneus, Diomede,</L>
<L>With all their most experienc'd chiefs and brave,</L>
<L>Three fierce attacks upon the out-works gave;</L>
<L>Some god their courage to this pitch did raise,</L>
<L>Or this is one of Troy's unlucky days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hector replied: This you have said, and more,</L>
<L>I have revolv'd in serious thoughts before.</L>
<L>But I not half so much those Grecians fear,</L>
<L>As carpet-knights, state-dames, and flatterers here.</L>
<L>For they, if ever I decline the fight,</L>
<L>Miscall wise conduct, cowardice and flight;</L>
<L>Others may methods chuse the most secure,</L>
<L>My life no middle courses can endure.</L>
<L>Urg'd by my own and my great father's name,</L>
<L>I must add something to our ancient fame:</L>
<L>Embark'd in Ilium's cause, I cannot fly,</L>
<L>Will conquer with it, or must for it die.</L>
<L>But still som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> boding genius does po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tend</L>

<L>Which Troy and all her glories shall deface,</L>

<L>When I presage your case, I learn to fear:</L>
<L>When you by some proud conqueror shall be led</L>
<L>A mournful captive to a master's bed:</L>

<L>To weave Troy's downfal in a Grecian loom:</L>
<L>Or, lower yet, you may be forc'd to bring</L>
<L>Water to Argos from Hiperia's spring;</L>
<L>And, as you measure out the tedious way,</L>
<L>Some one shall, pointing to his neighbour, say,</L>
<L>See to what fortune Hector's wife is brought,</L>
<L>That famous general, that for Ilium fought!</L>
<L>This will renew your sorrows without end,</L>
<L>Depriv'd in such a day of such a friend.</L>
<L>But this is fancy, or before it I</L>
<L>Low in the dust will with my country lie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then to his infant he his arms address'd,</L>
<L>The child clung, crying, to his nurse's breast,</L>
<L>Scar'd at the burnish'd arms and threatening crest.</L>
<L>This made them smile, whilst Hector did unbrace</L>
<L>His shining helmet, and disclos'd his face:</L>
<L>Then, dancing the pleas'd infant in the air,</L>
<L>Kiss'd him, and to the gods conceiv'd this prayer:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Jove, and ye heavenly powers, whoever hear</L>
<L>Hector's request with a propitious ear,</L>
<L>Grant this my child in honour and renown</L>

<L><PB N="74" REF="87"/>And when from some great action he shall come</L>
<L>Laden with hostile spoils in triumph home,</L>
<L>May Trojans say, Hector great things hath done,</L>

<L>This will rejoice his tender mother's heart,</L>
<L>And sense of joy to my pale ghost impart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then in the mother's arms he puts the child;</L>
<L>With troubled joy, in flowing tears she smil'd:</L>
<L>Beauty and grief shew'd all their pomp and pride,</L>
<L>Whilst those soft passions did her looks divide.</L>
<L>This scene ev'n Hector's courage melted down,</L>
<L>But soon recovering, with a lover's frown,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Madam, says he, these fancies put away,</L>
<L>I cannot die before my fatal day:</L>
<L>Heaven, when we first take-in our vital breath,</L>

<L>The beauteous princess silently withdrew,</L>

<HEAD>ON THE DEATH OF MR. WALLER.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MRS. APHARA BEHN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Born at Canterbury in the reign of Charles I. Her father, whose name was Johnson, being related to lord Wil∣loughby, was appointed lieutenant-general o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rinam, and embarked for the West Indies with his family whilst Aphan was very young. He died on his passage; but his family arrived at Surinam, where his daughter became acquainted with Prince Oronooko, whose story she has given. Soon after her return to England, she was married to Mr. Behn, a merchant of Dutch extraction. She was employed by Charles II, in 1666, in a political negotiation at Antwerp, which she managed with much dexterity; but her intelligence (though well-sounded) being disregarded, she renounced all state affairs, and amused herself some time with the gallantries of Antwerp; and, when she arrived at London, dedicated the rest of her life to pleasure and poetry. She published three volumes of miscellany poems, the first in 1684, the second in 1685, and the third in 1688. They consist of songs and other little pieces, by the earl of Rochester, Sir George Etherege, Mr. Henry Crisp, and others, with some pieces of her own. To the second miscellany, is annexed a translation of the duke of Rochefoucault's Moral Reflections, under the title of "Seneca unmasked," an edition of which was printed in 1727, in four volumes 12 mo. She wrote also seventeen plays, some histories and novels; and translated M. Fonte∣nelle's History of Oracles, and Plurality of Worlds, to which last she annexed an essay on translation and translated prose. The paraphrase of Oenone's epistle to Paris, in the English translation of Ovid's epistles, is Mrs. Behn's; and Mr. Dry∣den, in his preface to that work, pays her the following compliment:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I was desired to say, that the author, who is of the fair sex, understood not Latin; but if she does not, I am afraid she has given us occasion to be ashamed who do."</Q>
She was also the authoress of the celebrated letters between a nobleman and his sister, printed in London, 1684; and we have extant of hers eight love-letters, to a gentle∣man whom she passionately loved, and with whom she cor∣responded under the name of Lycidas. They are printed in the life and memoirs of Mrs. Behn, prefixed to her histories and novels. She died, after a long indisposition, April 16, 1689, and was buried in the Cloisters in Westminster-Abbey. There are several encomiums on Mrs. Behn prefixed to her "Lover's Watch;" and Mr. Gildon, who was inti∣mately acquainted with our poetess, speaks of her in the highest terms. Dr. King tells us,
<Q><L>" Astraea's lines flow on with so much ease,</L>
<L>" That she who writes like her must surely please."</L></Q>
Yet, pleasing as they may be, the licentiousness of her dra∣matic pieces occasioned the just censure of Mr. Pope:

<L>" Who fairly puts all characters to-bed!"</L></Q> N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

Whilst the reputation of his wit increased, he became poor and debauched, his estate was impaired, and his morals much corrupted. In 1663, being fined five hundred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounds for a riot in Bow-street, he became more serious, and applied to politicks.—His daughter Catha∣rine, having been mistress to James II. before he ascended the throne, was created countess of Dorchester, Jan. 2, 1685; and, on that king's abdication, she married the earl of Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣more.

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for, since his majesty has made my daughter a countess, it is fit I should do all I can to make his daughter a queen."</Q>
He died Aug. 20, 1701. His works, which hear great marks genius, and consist of speeches, political pieces, translation from Virgil and Horace, poems, songs, and five plays, were printed in 2 vols. 8vo. 1719, and again in 1722. Among<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them is a comedy called "The Mulberry Garden," acted at the Theatre Royal 1668. That garden is also mentioned in several other comedies of the last century. And Dr. King, in his "Art of Cookery," ver. 83, observes,
<Q><L>" A princely palace on that space does rise,</L>
<L>" Where Sedley's noble Muse found Mulberries."</L></Q>
At the representation of his comedy of "Bellamira," the roof of the play-house sell down; by which Sir Charles and a few others were hurt. His merry friend Sir Fleetwood Shepheard observed to him on this occasion,

His resignation is sealed with a griffin segreant: but it does not seem to be meant for coat armour; and is witnessed by William <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owles senior, Samuel and Thomas Palmer. On the 19th of August 1695 (Willis's Cath. vol. I. p. 448) he was collated by W. Lloyd, bishop of Litchfield, to the prebend of Gaia M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nor in his cathedral, which he vacated by his death in 1705. His elder brother Henry Bowles, fellow of King's College also, succeeded him in the living of Endfield. He was e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eemed a most complete scholar, and a great poet. Carter, in his "History of Cambridge," p. 150, says, from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> information, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he wrote several poems and transla∣tions."</Q>
I am indebted to the kind communication of the Reverend Mr. Cole for most of the above particulars; to which Mr. Baker's valuable MSS. enable me to add, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Henry</HI> Bowles was born at Hagley in the county of Wor∣cester; moderator in the sophisters schools anno 1683; senior fellow 1690; schoolmaster at Stourbridge in Wor∣cestershire 1691; bursar 1695, and proctor 1697; vice-provost 1705; succeeded his brother in the rectorship of Endfield;"</Q>

<HEAD>THE COMPLAINT OF ARIADNE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FROM CATULLUS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. W. BOWLES.</BYLINE>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The poet, in the epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis, describes the genial bed, on which was wrought the story of Theseus and Ariadne; and on that occasion makes a long digression, part of which is the subject of the following poem.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>THERE, on th' extremest beach and farthest sand,</L>
<L>Deserted Ariadne seem'd to stand,</L>
<L>New-wak'd, and raving with her love, she flew</L>
<L>To the dire shore, from whence she might pursue</L>
<L>With longing eyes, but all alas in vain!</L>
<L>The winged bark o'er the tempestuous main;</L>
<L>For buried in fallacious sleep she lay,</L>
<L>While through the waves false Theseus cut his way,</L>
<L>Regardless of her fate who sav'd his youth;</L>
<L>Winds bore away his promise and his truth.</L>
<L>Like some wild Bacchanal unmov'd she stood,</L>
<L>And with fix'd eyes survey'd the raging flood.</L>
<L>There with alternate waves the sea does roll,</L>
<L>Nor less the tempests that distract her soul;</L>
<L>Abandon'd to the winds her flowing hair,</L>
<L>Rage in her soul exprest, and wild despair:</L>
<L>Her rising breasts with indignation swell,</L>
<L>And her loose robes disdainfully repel.</L>
<L><PB N="101" REF="114"/>The shining ornaments that drest her head,</L>
<L>When with the glorious ravisher she fled,</L>
<L>Now at her mistress' feet neglected lay,</L>
<L>Sport of the wanton waves that with them play.</L>
<L>But she nor them regards, nor waves that beat</L>
<L>Her snowy legs, and wound her tender feet:</L>
<L>On Theseus her lost senses all attend,</L>
<L>And all the passions of her soul depend.</L>
<L>Long did her weaker sense contend in vain.</L>
<L>She sunk at last beneath the mighty pain:</L>
<L>With various ills beset, and stupid grown,</L>
<L>She lost the power those ills ev'n to bemoan:</L>
<L>But when the first assault and fierce surprize</L>
<L>Were past, and grief had found a passage at her eyes,</L>
<L>With cruel hands her snowy breast she wounds,</L>
<L>Theseus in vain through all the shore resounds.</L>
<L>Now, urg'd by love, she plunges in the main,</L>
<L>And now draws back her tender feet again:</L>
<L>Thrice she repeats the vain attempt to wade,</L>
<L>Thrice fear and cold her shivering limbs invade.</L>
<L>Fainting at last she hung her beauteous head,</L>
<L>And, fixing on the shore her eyes, she said:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah, cruel man! and did I leave for thee</L>
<L>My parents, friends, (for thou wast all to me)</L>
<L>And is my love, and is my faith thus paid?</L>
<L>Oh cruelty unheard! a wretched maid</L>
<L>Here on a naked shore abandon'd and betray'd!</L>
<L>Betray'd to mischiefs of which death 's the least,</L>
<L>And plung'd in ills too great to be exprest.</L>
<L>Yet the Gods will, the Gods contemn'd by you,</L>
<L>With vengeance thy devoted ship pursue,</L>
<L><PB N="102" REF="115"/>O'ertake thy sails, and rack thy guilty breast,</L>
<L>And with new plagues th' ill-omen'd flight infest.</L>
<L>But though no pity thy stern breast could move,</L>
<L>Nor angry Gods, nor ill-required love;</L>
<L>Yet sense of honour sure should touch thy heart,</L>
<L>And shame from low, unmanly flight divert.</L>
<L>With other hopes my easy faith you fed,</L>
<L>A glorious triumph, and a nuptial bed;</L>
<L>But all those joys with thee, alas! are fled.</L>
<L>Let no vain woman vows and oaths believe,</L>
<L>They only with more form and pomp deceive:</L>
<L>To compass their lewd ends the wretches swear,</L>
<L>Of oaths profuse, nor Gods nor temples spare;</L>
<L>But when enjoy'd—</L>
<L>Nor broken vows, nor angry heaven they fear.</L>
<L>But, O ye women! warn'd by me, be wise,</L>
<L>Turn their false oaths on them, their arts, their lies;</L>
<L>Dissemble, fawn, weep, swear, when you betray,</L>
<L>Defeat the gamesters at their own foul play.</L>
<L>Oh banish'd faith! but now from certain death</L>
<L>I snatch'd the wretch, and sav'd his perjur'd breath;</L>
<L>His life with my own brother's blood I bought,</L>
<L>And love by such a cruel service sought;</L>
<L>By me preserv'd, yet me he does betray,</L>
<L>And to wild beasts expose an easy prey!</L>
<L>Nor thou of royal race nor human stock</L>
<L>Wast born, but nurs'd by bears, and issued from a rock;</L>
<L>Too plain thou dost thy dire extraction prove,</L>
<L>Who death for life return'st, and hate for love,</L>
<L>Yet he securely sails! and I in vain</L>
<L>Recal the fled, and to deaf rocks complain.</L>
<L><PB N="103" REF="116"/>Unmov'd they stand; yet, could they see and hear,</L>
<L>More human would than cruel man appear.</L>
<L>But I—</L>
<L>Must the sad pleasure of compassion want,</L>
<L>And die unheard, and lose my last complaint.</L>
<L>Happy, ye gods! too happy had I liv'd,</L>
<L>Hadst thou, O charming stranger, ne'er arriv'd;</L>
<L>Dissembled sweetness in thy look does shine,</L>
<L>But ah! th' inhuman monsters lurk within.</L>
<L>What now remains? or whom shall I implore,</L>
<L>In a wild isle, on a deserted shore?</L>
<L>Shall I return, and beg my father's aid?</L>
<L>My father's! whom ingrateful I betray'd.</L>
<L>And with my brother's cruel murderer fled!</L>
<L>But Theseus, Ariadne, 's constant, kind,</L>
<L>Kind as the seas, and constant as the wind.</L>
<L>See! wretched maid, vast seas around thee roar,</L>
<L>And angry waves beat the resounding shore,</L>
<L>Cut off thy hopes, and intercept thy flight,</L>
<L>No ship appears to bless thy longing sight.</L>
<L>The dismal isle no human footstep bears,</L>
<L>But a sad silence doubles all my fears,</L>
<L>And fate in all its dreadful shapes appears.</L>
<L>Ev'n fainting nature scarce maintains the strife</L>
<L>Betwixt prevailing death and yielding life.</L>
<L>Yet, ere I die, revenging gods I'll call,</L>
<L>And curse him first, and then contented fall.</L>
<L>Ascend, ye furies then, ascend, and hear</L>
<L>My last complaints, and grant my dying prayer,</L>
<L>Which grief and rage for ill-rewarded love,</L>
<L>And the deep sense of his injustice, move:</L>
<L><PB N="104" REF="117"/>Oh, suffer not my latest words to fly</L>
<L>Like common air, and unregarded die!</L>
<L>With vengeance his dire treachery pursue,</L>

<L>And all the frightful forms the guilty fear.</L>

<L>To see my lambs were fed, and folds were pent,</L>
<L>A flame shone round my head; but soon the light</L>
<L>Decay'd, and all around stood deepest night.</L>
<L>But is Urania so averse to love?</L>
<L>Could none of all the rival shepherds move?</L>
<L>Ah, Aegon, how I envy thy success!</L>
<L>Thy fortune greater, though thy charms were less:</L>

<L>The door was open'd, and you reach'd the fruit:</L>

<L>And proudly look'd on the despairing throng!</L>
<L>Yet he ne'er fed the flocks, ne'er pent the fold,</L>
<L>Nor bore the summer's heat, nor winter's cold;</L>
<L>But he had wealth, and that alone betray'd</L>
<L>The heedless mind of the unthinking maid.</L>
<L>Curst be the wretch that first did gold dispense,</L>
<L>And robd'd the happy plains of innocence!</L>
<L>Am I refus'd because my suit was plain,</L>

<L>You know me not, nor yet the pains I took,</L>

<HEAD>ON THE DEATH OF MR. WALLER.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. BEVIL HIGGONS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A younger son of Sir Thomas Higgons (already men∣tioned, p. 42) by Bridget his second wife. At the age of 16, he became a commoner of St. John's College, Oxford, in Lent term 1686; and went afterwards to Cambridge. Wood enumerates five of his poems. He wrote some others; and was the author of a tragedy, intituled,
"The Generous Conqueror, or the Timely Discovery," acted at Drury Lane, and printed in 4to, 1702.
See the prologue to this tragedy in Lord Lansdowne's Poems, p. 220. He was a steady adherent to the cause of the exiled family; and ac∣companied K. James into France, where he maintained his wit and good-humour undepressed by his misfortunes. On the publication of Bishop Burnet's History of his own Times, he wrote some strictures on it, in a volume, intituled,
"Histo∣rical and Critical Remarks;"
the second edition of which was printed in 8vo, 1727; and, in the same year, published
"A short View of the English History; with Reflections, Political, Historical, Civil, Physical, and Moral; on the Reigns of the Kings; their Characters, and Manners; their Successions to the Throne, and all other remarkable Incidents to the Revolution 1688.

He wrote the extraordinary Preface to Lord Rochester's Valentinian; a translation from the sixth book of Virgil, on Aeneas's meeting with Dido, not worth preserving; and some other little pieces.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">LUCRET. BOOK V.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE HON. SIR ROBERT HOWARD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A younger son of Thomas earl of Berkshire, and edu∣cated at Magdalen College in Oxford. During the civil wars he was a zealous royalist; and was knighted at the Restora∣tion, and rewarded by the office of auditor of the exchequer. He was chosen member for Stockbridge in 1661; and for Castle Rising in 1679 and 1688. He was so strong an ad∣vocate for the Revolution, as to disclaim all manner of con∣versation with the Nonjurors; and, by his obstinacy and pride, made many enemies. His patron the duke of Buck∣ingham had in 1663 exposed him under the name of <HI>Bilboa</HI> in "The Rehearsal;" but afterwards altered his resolution, and leveled his ridicule at a much greater name, under that of <HI>Bayes.</HI> He was also ridiculed in Shadwell's
"Sullen Lovers." 1670, under the name of <HI>Sir Positive At-all.</HI>
He published six plays, a volume of poems, and some treatises in prose; was four times married; and died Sept. 3, 1698.—In Dryden, vol. II. p. 117, is a beautiful epistle
"To my ho∣noured Friend Sir R. Howard, on his excellent Poems."

<L>SINCE Earth and Water, more dilated Air,</L>
<L>And active Fire, mixt Nature's parts appear;</L>
<L>These all new form'd, and to destruction brought;</L>
<L>Why of the World may not the like be thought?</L>
<L><PB N="148" REF="161"/>Reason presents this maxim to our view,</L>
<L>What in each part, that in the whole is true:</L>
<L>And therefore, when you see spring up and fall</L>
<L>Nature's great parts, conclude the like of all:</L>
<L>Know, heaven and earth on the same laws depend,</L>
<L>In time they both began, in time shall end.</L>
<L>But, Memmius, not t' assume what some deny,</L>
<L>The proof on plain experience shall rely:</L>
<L>I'll shew, these elements to change are prone;</L>
<L>Rise in new shapes, continue long in none.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then first of Earth: conclude that all must fail,</L>
<L>Which differing parts, fermenting, can exhale:</L>
<L>Much the reflected rays extract from thence;</L>
<L>And from their burning heat no less th' expence.</L>
<L>The dust and smoke in flying clouds appear,</L>
<L>Which boisterous winds disperse through liquid air.</L>
<L>Some parts dissolve and flow away in rain,</L>
<L>And from their banks the rapid rivers gain.</L>
<L>A diminution nothing e'er escapes;</L>
<L>Which new existence gives to other shapes:</L>
<L>Plants, minerals, and concretes, owe their birth,</L>
<L>And animals their growth, in part to earth:</L>
<L>Then, since from this their beings first did spring,</L>
<L>Time all to this, their common grave, does bring.</L>
<L>In these examples, not to mention more,</L>
<L>Nature does earth consume, and earth restore.</L>
<L>The springs, the rivers, and the seas are found,</L>
<L>For earth's supply, with waters to abound;</L>
<L>Renew'd, and flowing in continual round.</L>
<L>Lest these, increasing, should at last prevail;</L>
<L>The mighty ocean fiercer winds assail:</L>
<L><PB N="149" REF="162"/>Vast shoals of atoms thence away they bear,</L>
<L>And, raising them aloft, transform to air.</L>
<L>Much is extracted from the powerful sun,</L>
<L>More does in subterranean channels run:</L>
<L>In earth it first excessive saltness spends,</L>
<L>Then to our springs' and rivers' heads ascends;</L>
<L>These in the fruitful valleys turn and wind,</L>
<L>And still to new productions are inclin'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And next of Air: which, in its vast extent,</L>
<L>In changes infinite, each hour is spent:</L>
<L>For air's wide ocean still requiring more,</L>
<L>Fill'd with effluvia, should it not restore</L>
<L>The perish'd shapes, time's ruins to repair,</L>
<L>Long since had all things been dissolv'd to air.</L>
<L>From others loss its being it receives;</L>
<L>To these again its changing substance leaves:</L>
<L>So true it is, that nature ebbs and flows;</L>
<L>And, one part perishing, another grows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Sun, the fountain of the glorious rays,</L>
<L>Instead of vanish'd light, new light displays.</L>
<L>The brightness of the flying minute past,</L>
<L>Is now obscur'd, and to new forms does haste.</L>
<L>From hence it comes that, when black clouds draw near,</L>
<L>And banish'd sun-shine strait does disappear,</L>
<L>The earth 's o'ershadow'd, as the storms are driven,</L>
<L>And rays new darted are requir'd from heaven.</L>
<L>Vision would cease (so soon would light expire)</L>
<L>Without recruits of bright etherial fire.</L>
<L>In our inferior and sulphureous light,</L>
<L>Of lamps and tapers chacing shades of night,</L>
<L><PB N="150" REF="163"/>Continued fuel feeds the trembling flame</L>
<L>Which gives the light, nor is that light the same</L>
<L>Of sun, of moon, of stars; ne'er think it strange</L>
<L>That they are not secure from final change.</L>
<L>When what so late did smile this instant dies,</L>
<L>And new-born light still shines to mortal eyes.</L>
<L>Thus we observe hard rocks in time decay'd;</L>
<L>The marble monuments for heroes made,</L>
<L>And stately towers, in humble ruins laid.</L>
<L>Do Gods their images from age secure?</L>
<L>Or force their temples always to endure?</L>
<L>Thus when you see old rocks from mountains fall,</L>
<L>By this conclude their sure original;</L>
<L>For, were they from eternity so plac'd,</L>
<L>No chance could ruin them, no time could waste.</L>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, a noble writer, a man of great wit and humour, and of the most whimsical ca∣price, was the admiration and the jest of the reign of Charles II. He was the alchemist and the philosopher; the fiddler and the poet; the mimic and the statesman. He has left us a specimen of his admirable wit in "The Rehearsal," which had a considerable effect in reforming the stage. It was finished before the end of 1664; but the great plague and other accidents prevented its being acted before 1671. He is said to have been assisted in this comedy by Dr. Spratt, Mr. Clifford, and the celebrated author of Hudibras.—The duke was born Jan. 30, 1627, the year before his fa∣ther's assassination. After many sufferings in the royal cause, he solicited one of the daughters of Cromwell in mar∣riage; but was mortified with a denial. He afterwards mar∣ried the only daughter of lord Fairfax, and was soon commit∣ted to The Tower by the protector. On the Restoration, he was at first slighted by the king; but the charms of his wit and conversation soon prevailed, and he was appointed a lord of the bed-chamber. In May 1668, he purchased the office of master of the horse; was installed chancellor of Cambridge, June 7, 1671, and deprived of that office in 1674. He died, in contempt and misery, April 16, 1688; a melancholy ex∣ample of the prostitution of talents. His end is pathetically described in Mr. Pope's Epistle to Lord Bathurst. And see some further particulars of a peer,

<L>IN Windsor forest, before war destroy'd</L>
<L>The harmless pleasure which soft peace enjoy'd;</L>
<L>A mighty stag grew monarch of the herd,</L>
<L>By all his savage slaves obey'd and fear'd;</L>
<L>And, while the troops about their sovereign fed,</L>
<L>They watch'd the awful nodding of his head.</L>
<L>Still as he passeth by, they all remove,</L>
<L>Proud in dominion, prouder in his love:</L>
<L>And while with pride and appetite he swells,</L>
<L>He courts no chosen object, but compels:</L>
<L>No subject his lov'd mistress dares deny,</L>
<L>But yields his hopes up to his tyranny.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long had this prince imperiously thus sway'd,</L>
<L>By no set laws, but by his will obey'd;</L>
<L>His fearful slaves, to full obedience grown,</L>
<L>Admire his strength, and dare not use their own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="157" REF="170"/>
<L>One subject most did his suspicion move,</L>
<L>That shew'd least fear, and counterfeited love;</L>
<L>In the best pastures by his side he fed,</L>
<L>Arm'd with two large militias on his head:</L>
<L>As if he practis'd majesty, he walk'd,</L>
<L>And at his nod, he made not haste, but stalk'd.</L>
<L>By his large shade, he saw how great he was,</L>
<L>And his vast layers on the bended grass.</L>
<L>His thoughts as large as his proportion grew,</L>
<L>And judg'd himself as fit for empire too.</L>
<L>Thus to rebellious hopes he swell'd at length,</L>
<L>Love and ambition growing with his strength.</L>
<L>This hid ambition his bold passion shows,</L>
<L>And from a subject to a rival grows;</L>
<L>Solicits all his prince's fearful dames,</L>
<L>And in his sight courts with rebellious flames.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The prince sees this with an inflamed eye,</L>
<L>But looks are only signs of majesty:</L>
<L>When once a prince's will meets a restraint,</L>
<L>His power is then esteem'd but his complaint.</L>
<L>His head then shakes, at which th' affrighted herd</L>
<L>Start to each side; his rival, not afear'd,</L>
<L>Stands by his mistress' side, and stirs not thence,</L>
<L>But bids her own his love, and his defence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The quarrel now to a vast height is grown,</L>
<L>Both urg'd to fight by passion, and a throne;</L>
<L>But love has most excuse; for all, we find,</L>
<L>Have passions, though not thrones alike assign'd.</L>
<L>The sovereign stag, shaking his loadedhead,</L>
<L>On which his scepters with his arms were spread,</L>
<L><PB N="158" REF="171"/>Wisely by nature there together fix'd,</L>
<L>Where with the title the defence was mixt.</L>
<L>The pace which he advanc'd with to engage</L>
<L>Became at once his majesty and rage:</L>
<L>T' other stands still with as much confidence,</L>
<L>To make his part seem only his defence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their heads now meet, and at one blow each strikes</L>
<L>As many strokes as if a rank of pikes</L>
<L>Grew on his brows, as thick their antlers stand,</L>
<L>Which every year kind nature does di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>band.</L>
<L>Wild beasts sometimes in peace and quiet are,</L>
<L>But man no season frees from love or war.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With equal strength they met, as if two oaks</L>
<L>Had fell, and mingled with a thousand strokes.</L>
<L>One by ambition urg'd, t'other disdain.</L>
<L>One to preserve, the other fought to gain:</L>
<L>The subjects and the mistresses stood by,</L>
<L>With love and duty to crown victory:</L>
<L>For all affections wait on prosperous fame,</L>
<L>Not he that climbs, but he that falls, meets shame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While thus with equal courages they meet,</L>
<L>The wounded earth yields to their struggling feet;</L>
<L>And while one slides, t'other pursues the fight:</L>
<L>And thinks that forc'd retreat looks like a flight:</L>
<L>But then, asham'd of his retreat, at length</L>
<L>Drives his foe back, his rage renews his strength.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As even weights into a motion thrown,</L>
<L>By equal turns, drive themselves up and down;</L>
<L>So sometimes one, then t' other stag prevails,</L>
<L>And victory, yet doubtful, holds the scales.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="159" REF="172"/>
<L>The prince, asham'd to be oppos'd so long,</L>
<L>With all his strength united rushes on;</L>
<L>The rebel weaker than at first appears,</L>
<L>And from his courage sinks unto his fears.</L>
<L>Not able longer to withstand his might,</L>
<L>From a retreat at last steals to a flight.</L>
<L>The mighty stag pursues his flying foe,</L>
<L>Till his own pride of conquest made him slow;</L>
<L>Thought it enough to scorn a thing that flies,</L>
<L>And only now pursued him with his eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The vanquish'd, as he fled, turn'd back his sight,</L>
<L>Asham'd to fly, and yet afraid to fight:</L>
<L>Sometimes his wounds, as his excuse, survey'd,</L>
<L>Then fled again, and then look'd back and staid:</L>
<L>Blush'd that his wounds so slight should not deny</L>
<L>Strength for a fight, that left him strength to fly.</L>
<L>Calls thoughts of love and empire to his aid,</L>
<L>But fears more powerful than all those persuade,</L>
<L>And yet in spite of them retains his shame,</L>
<L>His cool'd ambition, and his half-quench'd flame.</L>
<L>There's none from their own sense of shame can fly,</L>
<L>And dregs of passions dwell with misery.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now to the shades he bends his feeble course,</L>
<L>Despis'd by those that once admir'd his force:</L>
<L>The wretch that to a scorn'd condition 's thrown,</L>
<L>With the world's favour, loses too his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While fawning troops their conquering prince inclos'd,</L>
<L>Now render'd absolute by being oppos'd;</L>
<L>Princes by disobedience get command,</L>
<L>And by new-quench'd rebellions firmer stand;</L>
<L><PB N="160" REF="173"/>Till, by the boundless offers of success,</L>
<L>They meet their fate in ill-us'd happiness.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The vanquish'd stag to thickest shades repairs,</L>
<L>Where he finds safety punish'd with his cares;</L>
<L>Thorough the woods he rushes not, but glides,</L>
<L>And from all searches but his own he hides;</L>
<L>Asham'd to live, unwilling yet to lose</L>
<L>That wretched life he knew not how to use.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In this retirement thus he liv'd conceal'd,</L>
<L>Till with his wounds his fears were almost heal'd:</L>
<L>His ancient passions now began to move,</L>
<L>He thought again of empire and of love:</L>
<L>Then rous'd himself, and, stretch'd at his full length,</L>
<L>Took the large measure of his mighty strength;</L>
<L>Then shook his loaded head; the shadow too</L>
<L>Shook like a tree, where leafless branches grew.</L>
<L>Stooping to drink, he sees it in the streams,</L>
<L>And in the woods hears clashing of its beams:</L>
<L>No accident but does alike proclaim</L>
<L>His growing strength, and his increasing shame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now once again resolves to try his fate</L>
<L>(For envy always is importunate;</L>
<L>And in the mind perpetually does move,</L>
<L>A fit companion for unquiet love)</L>
<L>He thinks upon his mighty enemy</L>
<L>Circled about with power and luxury,</L>
<L>And hop'd his strength might sink in his desires;</L>
<L>Remembering he had wasted in such fires:</L>
<L>Yet while he hop'd by them to overcome,</L>
<L>He wish'd the other's fatal joys his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="161" REF="174"/>
<L>Thus the unquiet beast in safety lay,</L>
<L>Where nothing was to fear, nor to obey;</L>
<L>Where he alone commanded, and was lord</L>
<L>Of every bounty nature did afford,</L>
<L>Chose feasts for every arbitrary sense,</L>
<L>An empire in the state of innocence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But all the feasts nature before him plac'd</L>
<L>Had but faint relishes to his lost taste.</L>
<L>Sick minds, like bodies in a fever spent,</L>
<L>Turn food to the disease, not nourishment.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sometimes he stole abroad, and shrinking stood</L>
<L>Under the shelter of the friendly wood;</L>
<L>Casting his envious eyes towards those plains,</L>
<L>Where, crown'd with joys, his mighty rival reigns.</L>
<L>He saw th' obeying herd marching along,</L>
<L>And weigh'd his rival's greatness by the throng.</L>
<L>Want takes false measures both of power and joys,</L>
<L>And envy'd greatness is but croud and noise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not able to endure this hated sight,</L>
<L>Back to the shades he flies to seek out night.</L>
<L>Like exiles from their native soils, though sent</L>
<L>To better countries, think it banishment.</L>
<L>Here he enjoy'd what t'other could have there,</L>
<L>The woods as shady, and the streams as clear,</L>
<L>The pastures more untainted where he fed,</L>
<L>And every night chose out an unpress'd bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But then his labouring soul with dreams was prest,</L>
<L>And found the greatest weariness in rest;</L>
<L>His dreadful rival in his sleep appears,</L>
<L>And in his dreams again he fights and fears:</L>
<L><PB N="162" REF="175"/>Shrinks at the strokes of t'other's mighty head,</L>
<L>Feels every wound, and dreams how fast he fled.</L>
<L>At this he wakes, and with his fearful eyes</L>
<L>Salutes the light, that fleets the Eastern skies.</L>
<L>Still half amaz'd looks round, and, held by fear,</L>
<L>Scarce can believe no enemy was near.</L>
<L>But when he saw his heedless fears were brought,</L>
<L>Not by a substance, but a drowsy thought,</L>
<L>His ample sides he shakes, from whence the dew</L>
<L>In scatter'd showers like driven tempests flew;</L>
<L>At which through all his breast new boldness spread,</L>
<L>And with his courage rais'd his mighty head;</L>
<L>Then, by his love inspir'd, resolves to try</L>
<L>The combat now, and overcome or die.</L>
<L>Every weak passion sometimes is above</L>
<L>The fear of death, much more the noblest love.</L>
<L>By hope 'tis scorn'd, and by despair 'tis sought,</L>
<L>Pursued by honour, and by sorrow brought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Resolv'd the paths of danger now to tread,</L>
<L>From his scorn'd shelter and his fears he fled;</L>
<L>With a brave haste now seeks a second fight,</L>
<L>Redeems the base one by a noble flight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In the mean time, the conqueror enjoy'd</L>
<L>That power by which he was to be destroy'd.</L>
<L>How hard 'tis for the prosperous to see</L>
<L>That fate which waits on power and victory!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus he securely reign'd, when in a rout</L>
<L>He saw th' affrighted herd flying about;</L>
<L>As if some huntsmen did their chace pursue,</L>
<L>About themselves in scatter'd rings they flew.</L>
<L><PB N="163" REF="176"/>He, like a careful monarch, rais'd his head,</L>
<L>To see what cause that strange disturbance bred.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when the search'd-out cause appear'd no more</L>
<L>Than from a slave he had o'ercome before,</L>
<L>A bold disdain did in his looks appear,</L>
<L>And shook his awful head to chide their fear.</L>
<L>The herd, afraid of friend and enemy,</L>
<L>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ink from the one, and from the other fly;</L>
<L>They scarce know which they should obey or trust,</L>
<L>Since fortune only makes it safe and just.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, in despite of all his pride, he staid,</L>
<L>And this unlook'd-for chance with trouble weigh'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His rage and his contempt alike swell'd high,</L>
<L>And only fear'd his enemy should fly;</L>

<L>The mighty enemies now meet at length,</L>
<L>With equal fury, though not equal strength;</L>
<L>For now, too late, the conqueror did find,</L>

<L>As a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld pilot steers with tatter'd sails;</L>

<L><PB N="164" REF="177"/>The other's strength more from his weakness grows,</L>
<L>And with one furious push his rival throws.</L>

<LG>
<L>So a tall oak, the pride of all the wood,</L>
<L>That long th' assault of several storms had stood,</L>
<L>Till, by a mighty blast more strongly push'd,</L>
<L>His root's torn up, and to the earth he rush'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet then he rais'd his head, on which there grew,</L>
<L>Once, all his power, and all his title too;</L>
<L>Unable now to rise, and less to fight,</L>
<L>He rais'd those scepters to demand his right:</L>
<L>But such weak arguments prevail with none,</L>
<L>To plead their titles, when their power is gone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His head now sinks, and with it all defence,</L>
<L>Not only robb'd of power, but pretence.</L>
<L>Wounds upon wounds the conqueror still gives,</L>
<L>And thinks himself unsafe while t'other lives:</L>
<L>Unhappy state of such as wear a crown,</L>
<L>Fortune can never lay them gently down!</L>

<L>The flattering troops unto the victor fly,</L>

<HEAD>HORACE, BOOK II. ODE XXIII.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>PARAPHRASED BY DR. WALTER POPE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Half-brother to Bp. Wilkins. He was born at Fawsley in Northamptonshire, and elected from Westminster-school to Trinity College, Cambridge, 1645. He was afterward a scholar of Wadham College, Oxford, where he took the de∣gree of B.A. July 6, 1649; was admitted probationer fel∣low July 3, 1651; and commenced B.A. on the 10th of the same month. In 1658, being junior proctor, an attempt was made to abrogate the statute for wearing caps and hoods. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s was frustrated by his firmness, which he called
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the most glorious action of his life."</Q>
While Mr. Pope was in his proctorship, Mr. Sprat (afterwards bishop) addressed to him "The Plague of Athens;" which fixes the date of that poem to 1658. He was appointed dean of Wadham College in 1660; astronomy professor in Gresham College, March 8, 1660-1; created doctor of physic, Sept. 12, 1661; was ob∣liged to give up his fellowship, June 27, 1662, as incompati∣ble with the professorship. He was chosen one of the first fel∣lows of the Royal Society, May 20, 1663; and soon after had license to travel for two years, during which time he made the tour of Italy. After the great fire, Sept. 2, 1666, the principal lodgings in Gresham College were taken up by the lord mayor and other persons of note; but those of Dr. Pope were preserved for the use of the professors and the Royal Society, who first assembled there on Tuesday the 11th of that month, but soon after removed to Arundel-House in the Strand. Dr. Pope was chosen into the council of the Royal Society in 1667; and appointed register of the diocese of Chester, March 16, 1668. He published, in 1670,
"The Memoirs of Monsieur Du Vall, with his last Speech and Epitaph."
[Claude Du Vall, a native of Normandy, was a brisk handsome fellow; but, being a notorious highway-man, was hanged at Tyburn, Jan. 21, 1669; and in this pamphlet the Doctor humourously raillied the fashion, then prevalent among the ladies, of admiring Frenchmen.] In 1686, Dr. Pope had very nearly lost his sight by an inflam∣mation which had been of many years continuance; but was cured by Dr. Turbervill, as he handsomely acknowledges in the epitaph he wrote on that eminent oculist. He resigned his professorship, Sept. 21, 1687; and in 1693 published "The Wish," a well-known little poem. On the 16th of November that year he lost all his books, by a fire in Lom∣bard-street. He published the "Life of Bp. Ward in 1697;" and "Moral and Political Fables" in 1698. The next year he withdrew from the Royal Society, and resided principally at Epsom; but settled at last in Buning-fields, in the suburbs of London, where he died at a very advanced age, and was buried at Cripplegate Church, June 25, 1714. He wrote a copy of Verses upon Anne Green, who was executed at Ox∣ford, Dec. 14, 1650; and afterwards revived. [A narrative of this fact was printed at Oxford in 1651, 4to. intituled, "News from the Dead, &amp;c.," reprinted in Morgan's
"Phoe∣nix Britannicus."
See likewise in Heath's Chronicle, p. 278; Plot's Natural History of Oxfordshire, p. 201; and Warton's "Life of Dr. Bathurst." Sir Wm. Petty was one chiefly concerned in recovering her]. Dr. Pope was author of several humourous ballads, and of many serious treatises in prose; which are enumerated in Dr. Ward's Lives of the Gresham Professors; of which a valuable copy, with large MS additions by the author, is in The British Museum.

"The Poems of John Hoddesdon, London, 12mo. 1650."—Neither these verses, nor the prologue and two epilogues to "The Duke of Guise," having yet found admittance among the Works of this great Poet; I am happy in being thus able to supply the deficiency; and of observing, that he was <HI>not</HI> the author of
"An Elegy on the Usurper O. C. by the Author of Absalom and Achitophel, published to shew the Loyalty and Integrity of the Poet. 1681;"
nor of
"The Address of John Dryden, Laureat, to his Highness the Prince of Orange, 1689;" nor of the "Familiar Epistle to Julian," (erroneously ascribed to him in the sixth volume of his Miscellanies published by Tonson after the death of the person whose name they bear, and since continued in every edition of his Works.
See vol. II. 1778, p. 157.) which was originally published about 1683, under the title of
"An Exclamation against Julian, Secretary of the Muses; with the Character of a Libeller [Sir Charles Scrope]. By a Person of Quality [Lord Mulgrave]."
Having the original edition before me, I think it necessary to point out the following material errors in that of 1778: P. 157. l. 15. r. "leaves"—l. 23. r. "wight"—l. 26. r. "she sung Euphelia's"—P. 158. l. 20. r. "his self-love,"—l. 21. r. "He dares"—l. 23. r. "the least"—After l. 27, r.

<HEAD>SONG,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY SIR GEORGE ETHEREGE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This celebrated wit was born near London about the year 1634; and, after receiving some part of his education at Cambridge, travelled into France and Flanders. At his return, he studied the law for some time; which he soon ex∣changed for the belles lettres, and commenced dramatic writer in 1664. His first comedy,
"The Comical Re∣venge," secured to him the general esteem of the publick.
He was married young to a widow of considerable fortune, who would not consent to the match unless he could make her a lady by obtaining the honour of knighthood; which he applied for, and succeeded. His accomplishments pro∣cured him the favour of James the Second's queen, to whom (whilst she was only daughter of the duke of Modena) he had dedicated his "Man of Mode," 1676; and, by her in∣terest and recommendation, he was sent envoy to Hamburgh. On the Revolution he followed the fortunes of James II. and died either in France, or very soon after his arrival in Eng∣land from thence; but there was a report that he came to an untimely end by an accident in consequence of inebriation after a social dinner he had given to some friends at Ratisbon. He wrote three plays, and a number of sprightly poems. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>VOITURE'S<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This polite and elegant writer, who was born at Amiens in 1591, and died in 1648, was famous for introducing new and easy graces into the French language, and giving a more agreeable turn to many trite and familiar modes of expression, by a happiness peculiar to himself. His irony has been par∣ticularly admired for its singularity and address; but it has been observed, that few authors have suffered so much by translation, his native beauties being of too delicate a kind to be copied in a foreign language.

He seemed to be pleased with, and joined in the Revolution, and was made vice-chamberlain to Queen Mary; but having asked a grant, which was refused him, and given to Lord Portland, he fell from the court, and was all that reign the most violent and open antagonist King William had in the House.

He is indefatigable in whatever he undertakes; witness the Old East India Company, whose cause he maintained till he fixed it upon as sure a foot as the New; even when they thought themselves past recovery. He lives up to what his visible estate can afford; and yet purchases, instead of run∣ning in debt. He is endued with good natural parts, at∣tended with an unaccountable boldness; daring to say what he pleases, and will be heard out; so that he passeth with some for the shrew of the House.

<HEAD>PART OF VIRGIL'S FOURTH GEORGICK.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. CREECH<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Born near Sherborne in Dorsetshire in 1659, and bred up at the Free-school in that town, under Mr. Curganven, to whom he gratefully inscribed an Idyllium of Theocritus. He was sent by Colonel Strangeways to Wadham College in Oxford, where he was admitted a scholar on the foundation 1675, and took the degree of B.A. June 13, 1683. The reputation acquired by his Lucretius, which he published when very young, recommended him to All Souls College, where he was elected Fellow in 1689; proceeded B.D. March 18, 1696; and was presented by that College to the living of Welwyn in Hertfordshire; but, through some dis∣appointment either in love or in his expectations, laid violent hands on himself in 1701, before he had taken possession of his living. "He was a man," says Jacob,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of excellent parts, sound judgement, and perfectly master of the Greek and Latin languages; but naturally of a morose temper, and too apt to despise the understandings and performances of others. This made him less esteemed than his great merit deserved; and his resentments on this account fre∣quently engaged him in those heats and disputes which in the end proved fatal to him."</Q>
On his father's monument at Blandford, he is called
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The learned, much-admired, and much-envied Mr. Creech."</Q>—He translated Lucretius, Theocritus, and Horace; some eclogues of Virgil; and some of the satires of Juvenal. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Aristaeus, having lost his bees, goes by his mother's di∣rection to Proteus, to know why the Gods had sent this plague. Proteus tells him they sent it to revenge the injury he had done Orpheus, in being the cause of his bride's death, and so goes on with the story of his passion.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>NOW scorching Sirius burnt the thirsty moors,</L>
<L>And seas contracted left their naked shores;</L>
<L>The earth lay chopp'd, no spring supply'd his flood,</L>
<L>And mid-day rays boil'd-up the streams to mud:</L>
<L><PB N="231" REF="244"/>When Proteus coming to his usual cave,</L>
<L>The sea-calf following spouts the brackish wave:</L>
<L>Spread o'er the sand the scatter'd monsters lay,</L>
<L>He (like a shepherd at the close of day,</L>
<L>When heifers seek their stalls, and round a rock</L>
<L>The bleating lambs the hungry wolves provoke)</L>
<L>Sits midst the beach, and counts the scaly flock.</L>
<L>Scarce was he laid, scarce sleep had seal'd his eyes,</L>
<L>When Aristaeus, eager to surprize,</L>
<L>Invades and binds him: straight he starts and roars,</L>
<L>And with shrill noises fills the echoing shores:</L>
<L>He flies to his old arts, and strives to 'scape</L>
<L>By frequent change, and varying of his shape:</L>
<L>All monstrous forms put on, he would appear</L>
<L>A flame, a flood, a lion, or a bear:</L>
<L>When nought avail'd, he turn'd himself again;</L>
<L>And thus spoke with the accent of a man:</L>
<L><PB N="232" REF="245"/>By whose advice hast thou so rashly prest,</L>
<L>Bold youth, on me? And what do'st thou request?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You know, great God, you know, the swain reply'd,</L>
<L>For who can cheat you? who his wants can hide?</L>
<L>But strive to change no more: I humbly come,</L>
<L>And by the Gods commands, to know my doom:</L>
<L>For what I'm punish'd, whence these plagues arose,</L>
<L>And by what means I may retrieve my loss.</L>
<L>This said, the angry God with fury shook,</L>
<L>His eyes shot flame, and horror chang'd his look,</L>
<L>He gnash'd his teeth, and thus at last he spoke:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No common Gods, no common Gods pursue,</L>
<L>Thou suffer'st what to thy great crimes is due;</L>
<L>At wretched Orpheus' suit these plagues commence,</L>
<L>Though (fate being kind) too small for thy offence.</L>
<L>To heaven's strict justice he his wrongs apply'd,</L>
<L>And call'd down vengeance for his perish'd bride:</L>
<L>She, while she fled from thee, unhappy maid,</L>
<L>By heedless fear to treacherous banks betray'd,</L>
<L>Ne'er saw the snake glide o'er the grassy ground,</L>
<L>But, ere she knew the foe, she felt the wound:</L>
<L>Her fellow Dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ads fill'd the hills with cries,</L>
<L>In groans the soften'd Rhodope replies;</L>
<L>Rough Thrace, the Getes, and Hebrus' streams lament,</L>
<L>Forget their fury, and in grief consent:</L>
<L>While he to doleful tunes his strings does move,</L>
<L>And strove to solace his uneasy love:</L>
<L>Thee, thee, dear bride, on desart shores alone</L>
<L>He mourn'd at rising and at setting sun:</L>
<L>His restless love did natural fears expel,</L>
<L>He dar'd to enter the black jaws of hell,</L>
<L><PB N="233" REF="246"/>He saw the grove, where gloomy horrors spread,</L>
<L>The ghost and ghastly tyrant of the dead;</L>
<L>With those rough powers, that there severely reign,</L>
<L>Unus'd to pity, when poor men complain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He strook his harp, and strait a numerous throng</L>
<L>Of airy people fled to hear the song,</L>
<L>Thither vast troops of wretched lovers came,</L>
<L>And shriek'd at the remembrance of their flame;</L>
<L>With heavy grief and gloomy thoughts opprest,</L>
<L>Meag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e each shape, and wounds in every breast;</L>
<L>(How deep, ah me! and wide must mine appear,</L>
<L>If so much beauty can be so severe!)</L>
<L>With these, mixt troops of fathers, husbands, wives,</L>
<L>As thick as swarms of bees, fly round their hives</L>
<L>At evening close, or when a tempest drives:</L>
<L>With ghosts of heroes, and of babes expos'd,</L>
<L>And sons whose dying eyes their mothers clos'd:</L>
<L>Which now the dull unnavigable flood,</L>

<L>The wondrous numbers softened all beneath,</L>
<L>Hell, and the inmost flinty seats of death:</L>
<L>Snakes round the Furies heads did upward rear,</L>

<L>While fiery Styx in milder streams did roll,</L>
<L>And Cerberus gap'd, but yet forbore to howl;</L>
<L>Ixion's wheel stood still, all tortures ceas'd,</L>
<L>And hell amaz'd knew an unusual rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="234" REF="247"/>
<L>All dangers past, beyond the reach of fear,</L>
<L>Restor'd Eurydice breath'd the upper air,</L>
<L>Following behind (for, mov'd by his complaint,</L>
<L>Hell added this condition to the grant)</L>
<L>When Fury soon the heedless lover seiz'd,</L>
<L>(To be forgiven, if hell could be appeas'd)</L>
<L>For near the confines of aetherial air,</L>
<L>Unmindful, and unable to forbear,</L>
<L>He stopt, look'd back, (what cannot Love persuade?)</L>
<L>To take one view of the unhappy maid:</L>
<L>Here all his pains were lost, one greedy look</L>
<L>Defeats his hopes, and hell's conditions broke,</L>
<L>Thrice Styx resounded, thrice Avernus shook:</L>
<L>A fatal messenger from Pluto flew,</L>
<L>And snatch'd the forfeit from a second view.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Backward she fell; ah me! too greedy youth,</L>
<L>(She cry'd) what Fury now hath ruin'd both!</L>
<L>Death summons me again, cold fates surprize,</L>
<L>And icy sleep spreads o'er my nodding eyes:</L>
<L>Wrapt up in night I feel the Stygian shore,</L>
<L>And stretch my arms to thee in vain, ah thine no more!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This scarce pronounc'd, like smoke dispers'd in air,</L>
<L>So vanish'd the twice-lost unhappy fair;</L>
<L>And left him catching at the flying shade:</L>
<L>He stood distracted, much he would have said,</L>
<L>In vain; for Charon would not waft him o'er,</L>
<L>Once he had pass'd, and now must hope no more.</L>
<L>What should he do? Where should he seek repose?</L>
<L>Where fly the trouble of his second loss?</L>
<L>In what soft numbers should the wretch complain,</L>
<L>And beg his dear Eurydice again!</L>
<L><PB N="235" REF="248"/>She now grew cold in Charon's boat beneath,</L>
<L>And sadly sail'd to the known seats of death:</L>
<L>But while nine circling months in order turn'd,</L>
<L>Beneath black rocks (thus fame reports) he mourn'd:</L>
<L>By freezing Strymon's unfrequented stream,</L>
<L>Eurydice, his lost Eurydice, his theme;</L>
<L>And while he sang this sad event of love,</L>
<L>He tam'd fierce tigers, and made oaks to move:</L>
<L>With such soft tunes, and such a doleful song,</L>
<L>Sweet nightingales bewail their ravish'd young,</L>
<L>Which some hard-hearted swain hath borne away</L>
<L>While ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low birds, or kill'd the easy prey;</L>
<L>Restless they sit, renew their mournful strains,</L>
<L>And with sad passion fill their neighbouring plains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No face could win him, and no charms could move,</L>
<L>He fled the heinous thoughts of second love;</L>
<L>In vain the Thracians woo'd; wit, wealth, esteem,</L>
<L>Those great enticers, lost their force on him:</L>
<L>Alone he wander'd through the Scythian snows,</L>
<L>Where icy Tanaïs freezeth as it flows;</L>
<L>Through fields still white with frost, or beat with hail,</L>
<L>Constant to grief, and eager to bewail:</L>
<L>Eurydice, the Gods vain gift, employs</L>
<L>His thoughts, and makes him deaf to other joys.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The slighted Thracians heat this scorn encreas'd,</L>
<L>They breath'd revenge, and fir'd at Bacchus' feast,</L>
<L>(For what so soon as wine makes fury burn?</L>
<L>And what can wound a maid so deep as scorn?)</L>
<L>Full of their God, they wretched Orpheus tore,</L>
<L>Scatter'd his limbs, and drank his reeking gore:</L>
<L><PB N="236" REF="249"/>His head torn off, as Hebrus roll'd along,</L>
<L>Eurydice fell from his dying tongue.</L>

<BYLINE>BY LORD FALKLAND<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lucius Cary, eldest son of the first lord viscount of Falkland, was born about 1610; and received his academical learning first at Trinity College Dublin, and then at St. John's Cambridge. He entered early into the service of Charles I; and was shot at the battle of Newbury, Sept. 20, 1643.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The character of Lord Falkland by the Earl of Clarendon is the completest, if not the finest, of any in his admirable history. He is represented as an assemblage of almost every virtue and excellency that can dignify or adorn a man. This encomium is doubtless somewhat ex∣aggerated; but there seems to be much truth in it with respect to the private part of his life, as it appears to have been taken from near and repeated views. A great man in public rather appears to be what it is his interest or in∣clination to be thought, than what he is. The Earl of Clarendon, who knew Lord Falkland in private life, seems therefore to have given us a juster portrait of him than if he had seen him only in his public character. It must be acknowledged, that he has drawn him to great advantage: but we are not to impute this to the least disregard to truth, but to the amiable lights in which his friendship had placed him. A friend who draws the portrait of another friend, is apt to bestow as much heightening upon it as a painter would in finishing the picture of his mis∣tress."</Q>
This extract from Mr. Granger is given without the most distant inclination of
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"throwing a shade on a virtue the brightest and purest that hath done honour to these later ages;"</Q> [see Bp. Hurd's excellent Dialogues, vol. I. p. 78.]—Before he was twenty-three years of age, he had read over all the Greek and Latin fathers, and was inde∣fatigable in collecting books of value.
He has given specimens of his own abilities as a poet, a politician, and a polemic writer; but his
"Discourse of the Infallibility of the Church of Rome," which is written in an easy and familiar style, without the least affectation of learning, is the most considerable of his Works.
It is remarked by Doctor Swift, that in some of Lord Falkland's writings,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"when he doubted whether a word was perfectly intelligible or no, he used to consult one of his lady's chambermaids (not the waiting-woman, because it was possible she might be conversant in romances), and by her judgment was guided whether to receive or reject it."</Q>

<HEAD>ON THE DEATH OF BEN JONSON<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ben Jonson, a most celebrated English poet in his time, died Aug. 6, 1637, in his 63d year. He is gene∣rally represented as surly and morose by the writers of the present time, though, from the attention shewn to him by his contemporaries, it might be suspected that the charge was not well founded. Certain it is that he died much lamented; and in the beginning of 1638 his memory was embalmed by the tears of the Muses, in a collection of elegies and poems under the title of
"Jonsonius Virbius, or The Memorie of Ben Jonson revived by the Friends of the Muses."
In this collection were poems by most of the men of genius of that age. One by Mr. Waller is in his Poems, p. 104; another by Cartwright in this volume, p. 63. Those of the Lords Falkland and Buckhurst, Bp. King, and Dr. Mayne, are here exhibited. Sir John Beaumont, Sir Thomas Hawkins, H. Coventry, T. May, D. Diggs, G. Fortescue, W. Abington, J. Vernon, J.

Warying the author of "Effigies Amoris," James Howel, and some others, employed their pens in this collection; which was published by Dr. Duppa, bishop of Chichester, and tutor to Charles II. then prince of Wales.

<BYLINE>BY MR. HENRY KING<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Son of Dr. John King, bishop of London from 1611 to 1621. Henry was born in January 1591; educated partly at Thame, and partly at Westminster; elected student of Christ Church in 1608. He was made chaplain to James I. archdeacon of Colchester, residentiary of St. Paul's, and canon of Christ Church; D.D. in 1625; chaplain to Charles I; dean of Rochester in 1638; and in 1641, when episcopacy was sinking, was advanced to the bishoprick of Chester, "it being conceived," says Jacob,

His death happened October 1, 1669; after having published a new metrical translation of the Psalms, 1651, 12mo; "Poems, Elegies, Paradoxes, Sonnets, 1657," 8vo; "Divers Latin and Greek Poems;" some Sermons, and religious treatises. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

He took the degrees of B. and M.A, and was presented by the College to the livings of Cassington and Pyrton in Oxford∣shire. In the civil wars he preached before the king at Ox∣ford, and was made D.D.; but was soon after ejected from his livings by Cromwell's visitors. He found an asylum with the Earl of Devonshire; and at the Restoration obtained his livings again, was made canon of Christ Church, arch∣deacon of Chichester, and chaplain to Charles II. He died December 6, 1672; and is called by Wood
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a quaint preacher and a noted poet."</Q>
Five only of his sermons are in print, and his poems are not numerous. He published two plays; a poem on the Naval Victory over the Dutch by the Duke of York; translated some of Lucian's Dialogues, 1638; and Donne's Latin Epigrams, 1652, which he called
"A Sheaf of Miscellany Epigrams."
Though very orthodox in his opinions, and severe in his manners, he was a facetious companion, and his propensity to mirth attended him in his last moments; for to a servant who had lived long with him
he
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"bequeathed a trunk, with something in it to make him drink;"</Q> which being opened by the expecting servant, he found the legacy to be nothing but a red herring.

In his "England's Heroical Epistles," written in the manner of Ovid, he has been, in general, happier in the choice, than the execution of his subjects; yet some of his imitations are more in the spirit of a poet, than several of the English translations of him.

<HEAD>THYRSIS'S PRAISE TO HIS MISTRESS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. WILLIAM BROWNE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An excellent writer, whose fate was as uncommon as it was unmerited. He who was admired and beloved by all the best writers of his time, who was esteemed and highly recommended by the critical Jonson and the learned Selden, was in a few years after his death almost forgotten. To the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o small credit of Mr. T. Davies, his writings were for the first time completely collected in 1772, in three neat volumes, of a size which makes them a proper companion for the "English Poets," and consequently renders it unnecessary to print here any more than a specimen of his poetry. But a few particulars of his life shall be given in the words of Mr. Davies:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"William Browne, descended of a good family, was born at Tavistock in Devonshire, in the year 1590; his father, according to Prince, in his "Worthies of Devon," being probably of the knightly family of Browne, of Browne's-Ilash, in the parish of Langtree, near Great-Torrington. After he had passed through the Grammar-school, he was sent to Exeter College in the University of Oxford, about the beginning of the reign of king James the First, where he became a great proficient in classical learning, and in the Belles Lettres was scarcely equalled; from hence, however, before he had taken any academical degree, he removed to the Inner-Temple, London, where he more particularly devoted himself to the Muses. In the beginning of the year 1624, he returned again to Exeter College, and became tutor to Robert Dormer, who was af∣terwards earl of Carnarvon, and who lost his life at New∣bury Fight, on the 20th of September, 1643. On the 25th of March, 1624, our author received permission to be actu∣ally created a Master of Arts, although the degree was not conferred upon him till the November following. He is styled, in the public register of the University, a man well skilled in all kinds of polite literature and useful arts; <HI>vir omni humanâ literaturâ et bonarum artium cognitione in∣structus.</HI> After he had left College with his pupil, he was gladly received into the family of William earl of Pem∣broke, who had a great respect for him; and here, ac∣cording to the author of the Athenae Oxonienses, he made his fortune so well that he purchased an estate; he also adds, that he had a great mind in a little body; but with regard to the time of his death, he is very doubtful, for all that he says of the matter is, that in his searches he finds that one William Browne, of Ottery St. Mary in De∣vonshire, died in the year 1645; but that he cannot tell whether he was the same with our poet."</Q>
To this ac∣count I shall only add that Mr. Warburton the herald ap∣pears to have been possessed of some MS. poems by this au∣thor, which were sold, with the rest of his library, about the year 1759 or 1760. I cannot but wish that Mr. Davies had met with sufficient encouragement to have proceeded with the work he announced at the conclusion of his preface, under the title of "England's Helicon." He published, however, in the same size, the whole works of Suckling, in 1770, the poems of Marvell and Carew in 1772; and those of Sir John Davies in 1773. A small portion, therefore, of each of these writers will be sufficient for this collection. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>TO MICHAEL DRAYTON, ESQ.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. JOHN SELDEN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This famous antiquary, descended from a good family, was born at Salvington in Sussex, December 16, 1585; edu∣cated at Chichester free-school, and admitted of Hart-Hall, Oxon, in 1598; removed to Clifford's Inn in 1602, to study the law; admitted of the Inner Temple in May 1604. He soon commenced writer; and published a considerable num∣ber of valuable works, which it is needless here to enume∣rate. In 1612 he published notes and illustrations on the first eighteen songs in
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"his worthy friend Michael Dray∣ton's"</Q>
Poly-Olbion, and the year after wrote verses in Greek, Latin, and English, upon Browne's
"Britannia's Pastorals;" which, with divers poems prefixed to the works of other authors, occasioned Sir John Suckling to give him a place in his "Session of the Poets."
Mr. Selden, when not above three and thirty years of age, had shewn himself a great philologist, ant'quary, herald, and linguist; and his name was so wonderfully advanced, not only at home, but in foreign countries, that he was actually then, what he was afterwards usually styled, the great dictator of learning to the English nation. In 1618, when he was in his thirty-fourth year, he published his "History of Tithes;" which alarming the clergy, and offending king James I, it was suppressed, and the author forced to make public sub∣mission. He again offended that monarch in 1621, by an opinion he gave against the crown as counsel in the house of lords, and was committed into the custody of the sheriff of London; but was released in five weeks by the favour of the lord keeper Williams. He was chosen member for Lan∣caster that year; but neglected all public business to apply himself to study. In 1624 he was appointed, by the Inner Temple, reader at Lyon's Inn; but refused to accept that office. In 1625 he was chosen burgess for Great Bedwin, Wiltshire, and again in 1626, when he was an active ma∣nager against the duke of Buckingham. In 1627 he was counsel for Mr. Hampden; and in the third parliament of king James was again elected for Lancaster, and had a con∣siderable hand in the Petition of Rights. After the proro∣gation in June, retiring to Wrest in Bedfordshire, he finished his Commentaries on the Arundelian Marbles. In the next session he warmly opposed the court, and was committed to the Tower, and had his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy sealed up, March 24, 1628. He was closely confined three months, but magnificently supported at the king's expence; and being afterwards al∣lowed the use of such books as he desired, he proceeded in his studies. In Hilary Term, 1629, declining to give se∣curity for his good behaviour (as unwarrantable by law), he was committed to the King's Ben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h prison. He was released the latter end of the year, though it does not appear how; only that the parliament in 1646 ordered him £.5000. for the losses he had sustained on that occasion. In 1630 he was again committed to custody, with the earls of Bedford and Clare, Sir Robert Cotton, and Mr. St. John, being accused of having dispersed a libel, intituled,
"A Proposition for his Majesty's service to bridle the impertinency of Parlia∣ments;" but it was proved that Sir Robert Dudley, their living in the duke of Tuscany's dominions, was the author.
All these various imprisonments and tumults gave no inter∣ruption to his studies; but he proceeded, in his old way, to write and publish books. In 1640 he was chosen member of parliament for the University of Oxford; and though he was against the court, yet in 1642 the king had thoughts of tak∣ing the seal from the lord keeper Littleton, and giving it to him. In 1643 he was appointed one of the lay-members to sit in the assembly of divines at Westminster, in which he frequently perplexed those divines with his vast learning. About this time he took the covenant; and the same year, 1643, was by the parliament appointed keeper of the records in the Tower. In 1644 he was elected one of the twelve commissioners of the Admiralty; and the same year was no∣minated to the mastership of Trinity College in Cambridge, which he did not think proper to accept. In the beginning of 1653 his health began to decline; and he died the 30th of November that year, at the Friary House in White-Friars, where he had resided for some years, being possessed of it in the right of Elizabeth counte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s dowager of Kent, who had appointed him executor of her will, having before, from the first of her widowhood, committed the management of her affairs to him. He was buried in the Temple church, where a monume<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was erected to him. He left a most valu∣able and curious library to his executors; which they gene∣rously would have bestowed on the society of the Inner Temple, if a proper place had been provided to receive it; but, this being neglected, they gave it to the University of Oxford. A good edition of his Works was published by Dr. Wilkins, 1726, in three volumes, folio. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dr. Bathurst, in the early part of his life, applied himself to the study of divinity, in which he made a very considerable progress. But when he saw that some churches were defaced or demolished, and others con∣verted into barracks and stables, and that a learned mi∣nistry was held in the utmost contempt, he changed the course of his studies, and applied himself to physic. He took a doctor's degree in that faculty, in which he rose to such eminence, that he was, in the time of the Usurpation, appointed physician to the state. Upon the Restoration, he quitted his profession of physic, was elected a fell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w of the Royal Society, and president of his college: and having entered into holy orders, he was made chaplain to the king, and installed dean of Wells, June 28, 1670. His learning and talents were various: he was the orator and the poet, the philosopher and the divine. He possessed an inexhaustible fund of writ, and was the facetious companion at eighty years of age. Ridicule was the weapon that he made use of to correct the deliquents of his college; and he was so absolute a master of it, that he had it always at hand. His poetical pieces in the "Musae Anglicanae" are excellent in their kind: they are much in the spirit of Ovid, who was his favourite poet. His "Diatribae Theo∣logicae" in manuscript, which he began at twenty-three years of age, are much commended by Mr. Warton. He died greatly lamented by all that knew his worth, and particularly by the society over which he presided, the 14th of June, 1704, in the 84th year of his age."</Q>

<HEAD>VERSES</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY GEORGE CHAPMAN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This writer, who obtained much applause in his time, and was greatly praised by his contemporaries, was born at Hitching-hill, in the county of Hertford, some time in the year 1557. After being well grounded in school-learning, he was sent to the University, but whether to Oxford or Cam∣bridge was unknown to Anthony Wood, who declares him∣self certain he resided some time at the former, where he was observed to be most excellent in the Latin and Greek tongues, but not in Logic or Philosophy, which may be presumed to be the reason he took no degree there. He appears to have been a man of a very respectable character, being countenanced and patronized by several eminent persons, particularly Sir Thomas Walsyngham and his son, and by Prince Henry, son of James the First. Wood imagines that he was a sworn servant either to James the First or his Queen, and says he was highly valued, but not so much as Ben Jonson. The same writer adds, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he was a person of most reverend aspect, religious and temperate qualities, rarely meeting in a poet."</Q>
After living to the age of 77 years, he died on the 12th day of May, 1634, in the parish of St. Giles in the Fields, and was buried on the South-side of the Church-yard there. His friend Inigo Jones erected a monument to his memory near the place of his interment. His translation of Homer acquired him a considerable degree of reputation. Mr. Dryden tells us, that Waller used to say he never could read it without incredible transport. It is much censured by Mr. Pope, who, notwithstanding, acknowledges that there is a daring, fiery spirit, which animates it, something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have writ before he arrived at years of discretion. He translated also the Batrachomyomachia, and all the Hymns of Homer, to which he annexed the verses here printed; finished Marlow's Trans∣lation of Musaeus; produced several original Poems, and some other Translations; was the author of seventeen dra∣matick performances, and assisted Shirley in two others. For this note I am indebted to the new edition of Dodsley's Old Plays, vol. IV. p. 113. where the reader will find some other curious particulars of Chapman, and an exact list of his dra∣matick writings.</P>
<P>Of the Batrachomyomachia and Hymns, I have the copy presented to Lord Russel, with the following MS. dedi∣cation:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For the many noble favors, receiv'd of the righte honorable the Lord RUSSELL; and desirouse by all best services, to crowne his Lordship's free graces with con∣tin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wance; GEORGE CHAPMAN humblie inscribes this crowne of all the Homericall Graces and Muses to his Lordship's Honor: wishing the same, crownde above title, and establishte past marble."</Q>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION OF <HI>NOSCE TEIPSUM</HI></HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY SIR JOHN DAVIES<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son of a wealthy tanner of Chisgrove in Wiltshire, and born there about 1569; commoner of Queen's College, Ox∣ford, in Michaelmas term 1583. When he had taken the degree of B.A. he removed to the Middle Temple, and was called to the bar. Being expelled thence on account of a quarrel, he returned to Oxford. He was afterwards rein∣stated in the Temple, practised as a barrister, and was chosen a burgess in the parliament held at Westminster in 1601. Upon the death of Queen Elizabeth, our author went with Lord Hunsdon into Scotland, to congratulate King James. That prince was learned himself, and a great encourager of learned men; when Hunsdon and his retinue were admitted into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing's presence, his majesty enquired the names of the gentlemen who accompanied him; his lordship naming among the rest John Davies, the king presently asked whe∣ther he was Nosce Teiptum, which was the title of his poem on the I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mortality of the Soul, and being answered that he was, he graciously embraced him, and assured him of his fa∣vour. The king presently after promoted him to the office of solicitor and then attorney-general in Ireland, where in 1606 he was made serjeant at law, and afterwards speaker of the house of commons in that kingdom; the year following he received the order of knighthood from the king at Whitehall. In the year 1612 he published a very valuable book, called,
"A Discovery of the true Causes why Ireland was never en∣tirely subdued, nor brought under obedience of the Crown of England, until the beginning of his Majesty's happy Reign;" reprinted in 12mo, 1747.
Sir John, in 1612, quitted Ireland, and was made one of his majesty's English serjeants at law. After his settling in England he was often appointed one of the judges of assize in the circuits. He mar∣ried Eleanor Tonchet, youngest daughter of George, Lord Audley, by whom he had a son an ideot, who died young, and a daughter named Lucy, married to Ferdinand, Lord Hastings, afterwards Earl of Huntingdon. In 1626 Sir John was appointed Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench; but, before the ceremony of his installation could be per∣formed, he died suddenly of an apoplexy, the 7th of Decem∣ber, at his house in the Strand, in the 57th year of his age. Sir John Davies, besides his Poems and his Account of the reduction of Ireland before-mentioned, published reports and other books relating to the constitution and laws of this kingdom. Anthony Wood says, there were several of his manuscripts on various subjects, which were formerly in the library of Sir James Ware, and since that in the possession of Edward Earl of Clarendon; besides these, which were chiefly of the political kind, the same author says there were also some epigrams written by Sir John, and a metaphrase of several of King David's Psalms, but never published. The poem on the Soul, which he called Nosce Teipsum, was first published in 1599, and afterwards in 1622 with Hymns to Astrea in acrostic verse; and Orchestra, a poem expressing the antiquity and excellence of dancing, in a dialogue be∣tween Penelope and one of her wooers, containing one hun∣dred and thirty-one stanzas unfinished. See the Life pre∣fixed by Mr. Davies to the complete edition of his poems, 1773. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>DETRACTION EXECRATED.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY SIR JOHN SUCKLING<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A poet of great vivacity and some elegance, and one of the finest gentlemen of his time. He was son to Sir John Suckling, comptroller of the houshold to king Charles the First; and was born at Witham in Essex in 1613. He spoke Latin at five years of age, and wrote it when nine. He had a general knowledge of polite literature; but applied himself more particularly to music and poetry. In the course of his foreign travels, he made a campaign under Gustavus Adol∣phus; and, at his return, raised a splendid troop of horse, at the expence of twelve thousand pounds, for the service of the king. This troop, with Sir John at its head, behaved so ill in the engagement with the Scots, upon the English borders, in 1639, as to occasion the famous lampoon by Sir John Mennis, "Sir John he got him an ambling nag," &amp;c. which was set to an Irish tune, and much sung by the Parliamenta∣rians. This disastrous exped<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, and the ridicule that at∣tended it, was supposed to have hastened his death, which happened in 1641, at the age of twenty-eight. His prose writings, particularly his "Discourse of Religion," addressed to lord Dorset, are thought equal to the best of his poetical performances. His ballad on a wedding, and his
"Session of the Poets," are oftener remembered than any of his works.
This ballad was occasioned by the marriage of Roger Boyle, the first earl of Orrery, with lady Margaret Howard, daughter of the earl of Suffolk. There was a great intimacy betwixt Sir John and the earl of Orrery, then lord Broghill. In his "Session of the Poets," he has given us some traits of the characters of his poetical brethren. This article is prin∣cipally compiled from Jacob and Granger. The whole of Sir John Suckling's Works, containing his
"Poems, Letters, and Plays," were published several times by Mr. Tonson; and in two neat volumes, by Mr. Davies, 1770.

<HEAD>SONG,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THOMAS CAREW<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thomas Carew, a poet of real elegance, was a younger son of the family of the Carews in Devonshire. He was born in 1589; and after receiving some part of his education at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, he spent many years in France and Italy. Returning from travel, he followed the court, which, says Lord Clarendon,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the modesty of that time disposed men to do some time, before they pretended to be of it; and he was very much esteemed by the most emi∣nent persons in the court, and well looked upon by the King himself, some years before he could obtain to be Sewer to the King; and when the King conferred that place upon him it was not without the regret even of the whole Scotch nation, which united themselves in recom∣mending another gentleman to it; and of so great value were those relations held in that age, when majesty was beheld with the reverence it ought to be."</Q>
Wood, the ce∣lebrated Oxford Biographer, says that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he was adored by the poets of his time"</Q>
Which seems to be true, as we well know that his admirers were the first men of the age; that Montague, the Lord Abbot of Pontois, caressed him; that Donne, D' Avenant, and May, loved him. Suckling too admired him; and yet, in his Session of the Poets, says,
<Q><L>" Tom Carew came next, but he had a fault</L>
<L>" That would not well stand with a Laureat;</L>
<L>" His Muse was hide-bound, and the issue of 's brain</L>
<L>" Was seldom brought forth but with trouble and pain."</L></Q>
Suckling knew otherwise: but we must remember, that the poet, when he wrote this, was writing a satire. The ele∣gance of his love-sonnets made them familiar to his Majesty and his nobles; they were sought after, read, and rehearsed; and by his Majesty's command were set to music, or (as Wood expresses it) wedded to the charming notes of Mr. Henry Lawes, who was gentleman of the King's chapel, and at that time the greatest musical composer in England. Lord Clarendon says,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Carew was a person of a pleasant and face∣tious wit, and made many poems (especially in the amorous way) which, for the sharpness of the fancy, and the ele∣gance of the language in which that fancy was spread, were at least equal, if not superior, to any of that time: but his glory was, that after fifty years of his life had been spent with less severity or exactness than it ought to have been, he died with the greatest remorse for that license, and with the greatest manifestation of Christianity that his best friends could desire."</Q>
He died in the year 1639. I have already mentioned that his poems were published in 1772 by Mr. Davies. N.</NOTE>, ESQ.</BYLINE>
