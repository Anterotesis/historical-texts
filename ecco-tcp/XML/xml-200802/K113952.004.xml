<L>TO woo green April, lo the sun</L>
<L>That very form (which Jove put on</L>
<L>To bear Europa from her native land)</L>
<L>Assumes to win the queen of showers!</L>
<L>A new-blown primrose decks her hand,</L>
<L>Her taper waist a zone of flowers;</L>
<L>Like a young widow she appears</L>
<L>Shining thro' shades, and beautiful in tears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now genial nature every seed</L>
<L>Opens to grace the vernal mead,</L>
<L>The lark now ventures up the sapphire skies,</L>
<L>Tho' Zephyr shakes his madid wing,</L>
<L>Yet warmth awakes the embryo flies</L>
<L>To creep, and meet parental spring:</L>
<L>When lo! a shower of drizzling rain,</L>
<L>Or drowns, or drives them to their nests again!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<L>Prolific mists o'er every rill</L>
<L>Preside, and shade the distant hill;</L>
<L>A tepid moisture gladdens every root,</L>
<L>The husbandmen now pole and bind</L>
<L>The hops, and bid the tendrils shoot,</L>
<L>Thus guarded from the southern wind,</L>
<L>While every vegetative power</L>
<L>Imbibes young April's soft balsamic shower.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mark! how each month's unwearied toil</L>
<L>Successive cloaths, or strips the soil!</L>
<L>From heat to cold they traverse thro' the sky,</L>
<L>And yet unerring is the plan,</L>
<L>And regular from hot to dry</L>
<L>The calendar of social man!</L>
<L>In no one track the steps appear,</L>
<L>Yet all to one united centre steer.</L>

<HEAD>AN ODE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>STern winter now, by spring repress'd,</L>
<L>Forbears the long-continued strife,</L>
<L>And nature, on her naked breast,</L>
<L>Delights to catch the gales of life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, o'er the rural kingdom roves</L>
<L>Soft Pleasure with her laughing train,</L>
<L>Love warbles in the vocal groves,</L>
<L>And vegetation paints the plain.</L>
</LG>

<L>Unhappy! whom to beds of pain</L>
<L>Arthritic tyranny consigns,</L>
<L>Whom smiling nature courts in vain,</L>
<L>Tho' rapture sings, and beauty shines.</L>

<LG>
<L>Yet, tho' my limbs disease invades,</L>
<L>Her wings imagination tries,</L>
<L>And bears me to the peaceful shades,</L>
<L>Where â€”'s humble turrets rise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here stop, my soul, thy rapid flight,</L>
<L>Nor from the pleasing groves depart,</L>
<L>Where first great nature charm'd my sight,</L>
<L>Where wisdom first inform'd my heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<L>Here let me thro' the vales pursue</L>
<L>A guide, a father, and a friend;</L>
<L>Once more great nature's works review,</L>
<L>Once more on wisdom's voice attend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From false caresses, causeless strife,</L>
<L>Wild hope, vain fear, alike remov'd,</L>
<L>Here let me learn the use of life,</L>
<L>Then best enjoy'd, when most improv'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Teach me, thou venerable bower,</L>
<L>Cool meditation's quiet seat,</L>
<L>The generous scorn of venal power,</L>
<L>The silent grandeur of retreat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Pride, by guilt, to greatness climbs,</L>
<L>Or raging factions rush to war,</L>
<L>Here let me learn to shun the crimes</L>
<L>I can't prevent, and will not share.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, lest I fall by subtler foes,</L>
<L>Bright wisdom, teach me Curio's art,</L>
<L>The swelling passions to compose,</L>
<L>And quell the rebels of the heart.</L>

<HEAD>STANZAS ON THE SPRING.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>NOW from the southern climes returning spring</L>
<L>Breathes fragrant odours o'er th' enamell'd ground,</L>
<L>The feather'd warblers flutter on the wing,</L>
<L>And with their notes th' embowering woods resound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The rising sun, when first he gilds the plains,</L>
<L>Receives the tribute of the sylvan throng,</L>
<L>And Philomela, fraught with tragic strains,</L>
<L>Tunes, to the full-orb'd moon, her plaintive song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now blithsome Colin, with his oaten reed,</L>
<L>Delights the listening swains in glade or grove;</L>
<L>While Corydon, in yonder yellow mead,</L>
<L>To Amaryllis tells his tale of love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At evening hour the nymphs and swains advance,</L>
<L>And rang'd in order on the plain are seen,</L>
<L>In various orbs revolve the rustic dance,</L>
<L>And beat with measur'd pace the level green.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The purple violet scents the mossy hill,</L>
<L>And rich in bloom the fragrant hawthorn blows;</L>
<L>While, near the margin of some brawling rill,</L>
<L>The cowslip brightens, and the daisy glows.</L>

<L>The lawns, the mountains, and the vocal woods,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hark! how the birds in consort raise their notes;</L>
<L>And sweetly chant the renovated lay,</L>
<L>'Tis nature's impulse tunes their warbling throats,</L>
<L>To hail thee, Flora, goddess of the May.</L>

<L>To thee of old, on fair Ausonia's plains,</L>
<L>(With ease and wealth by godlike Titus blest)</L>

<L>Pour'd the full bowl, and pil'd the annual feast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And still to thee, in fair Britannia's isle,</L>
<L>When each revolving year renews the spring;</L>
<L>(Beneath great George! while ease and plenty smile)</L>
<L>My swelling lyre shall annual tribute bring.</L>

<L>Where sage Contentment builds her seat,</L>
<L>And Peace attends the calm retreat;</L>
<L>My soul responsive hails the scene,</L>
<L>Attun'd to joy and peace within:</L>

<HEAD>THE AFRICAN PRINCE, NOW IN ENGLAND, TO ZARA AT HIS FATHER'S COURT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WROTE IN THE YEAR MDCCXLIX.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>PRinces, my fair, unfortunately great,</L>
<L>Born to the pompous vassalage of state,</L>
<L>Whene'er the public calls, are doom'd to fly</L>
<L>Domestic bliss, and break the private tie.</L>
<L>Fame pays with empty breath the toils they bear,</L>
<L>And love's soft joys are chang'd for glorious care.</L>
<L>Yet conscious virtue, in the silent hour,</L>
<L>Rewards the hero with a nobler dower.</L>
<L>For this alone I dar'd the roaring sea,</L>
<L>Yet more, for this I dar'd to part with thee.</L>
<L>But while my bosom feels the nobler flame,</L>
<L>Still unreprov'd, it owns thy gentler claim.</L>
<L>Tho' virtue's awful form my soul approves,</L>
<L>'Tis thine, thine only, Zara, that it loves.</L>
<L>A private lot had made the claim but one,</L>
<L>The prince alone must love, for virtue, shun.</L>
<L>Ah! why, distinguish'd from the happier crowd,</L>
<L>To me the bliss of millions disallow'd?</L>
<L>Why was I singled for imperial sway,</L>
<L>Since love and duty point a different way?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
<L>Fix'd the dread voyage, and the day decreed,</L>
<L>When, duty's victim, love was doom'd to bleed,</L>
<L>Too well my memory can those scenes renew,</L>
<L>We met to sigh, to weep our last adieu.</L>
<L>That conscious palm, beneath whose towering shade</L>
<L>So oft our vows of mutual love were made;</L>
<L>Where hope so oft anticipated joy,</L>
<L>And plann'd of future years the blest employ;</L>
<L>That palm was witness to the tears we shed,</L>
<L>When that fond hope, and all those joys were fled.</L>
<L>Thy trembling lips, with trembling lips, I press'd,</L>
<L>And held thee panting to my panting breast.</L>
<L>Our sorrow, grown too mighty to sustain,</L>
<L>Now snatch'd us, fainting, from the sense of pain.</L>
<L>Together sinking in the trance divine,</L>
<L>I caught thy fleeting soul, and gave thee mine.</L>
<L>O! blest oblivion of tormenting care!</L>
<L>O! why recall'd to life and to despair?</L>
<L>The dreadful summons came, to partâ€”and why?</L>
<L>Why not the kinder summons but to die?</L>
<L>To die together were to part no more,</L>
<L>To land in safety on some peaceful shore,</L>
<L>Where love's the business of immortal life,</L>
<L>And happy spirits only guess at strife.</L>
<L>" If in some distant land my prince should find</L>

<L>Relief to mine, and anguish to thy heart.</L>

<L>Torn from thy fond embrace, the strand I gain,</L>

<L>From guilt and fraud, that strikes in silence sure,</L>

<L>And hostile barks, and storms, are God's domain:</L>
<L>He rules resistless, and his power shall guide</L>
<L>My life in safety o'er the roaring tide;</L>
<L>Shall bless the love that's built on virtue's base,</L>
<L>And spare me to evangelize my race.</L>
<L>Farewell! thy prince still lives, and still is free:</L>
<L>Farewell! hope all things, and remember me.</L>

<HEAD>ZARA, AT THE COURT OF ANAMABOE, TO THE AFRICAN PRINCE NOW IN ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SHould I the language of my heart conceal,</L>
<L>Nor warmly paint the passion that I feel,</L>
<L>My rising wish should groundless fears confine,</L>
<L>And doubts ungenerous chill the glowing line,</L>
<L>Would not my prince, with nobler warmth, disdain</L>
<L>That love, as languid, which could stoop to feign?</L>
<L>Let guilt dissembleâ€”in my faithful breast</L>
<L>Love reigns unblam'd, and be that love confest.</L>
<L>I give my bosom naked to thy view,</L>
<L>For what has shame with innocence to do?</L>
<L>In fancy, now, I clasp thee to my heart,</L>
<L>Exchange my vows, and all my joys impart.</L>
<L>I catch new transport from thy speaking eye;â€”</L>
<L>But whence this sad involuntary sigh?</L>
<L>Why pants my bosom with intruding fears?</L>
<L>Why from my eyes distil unbidden tears?</L>
<L>Why do my hands thus tremble as I write?</L>
<L>Why fades thy lov'd idea from my sight?</L>
<L>O! art thou safe on Britain's happy shore,</L>
<L>From winds that bellow, and from seas that roar?</L>
<L>And has my princeâ€”(Oh, more than mortal pain!)</L>
<L>Betray'd by ruffians, felt the captive's chain?</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="23"/>Bound were those limbs ordain'd alone to prove</L>
<L>The toils of empire, and the sweets of love?</L>
<L>Hold, hold! Barbarians of the fiercest kind!</L>
<L>Fear heaven's red lightningâ€”'tis a prince ye bind;</L>
<L>A prince, whom no indignities could hide,</L>
<L>They knew, presumptuous! and the gods defied.</L>
<L>Where-e'er he moves let love-join'd reverence rise,</L>
<L>And all mankind behold with Zara's eyes!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy breast alone, when bounding o'er the waves</L>
<L>To freedom's climes, from slavery and slaves;</L>
<L>Thy breast alone the pleasing thought could frame</L>
<L>Of what I felt, when thy dear letters came:</L>
<L>A thousand times I held them to my breast,</L>
<L>A thousand times my lips the paper prest:</L>
<L>My full heart panted with a joy too strong,</L>
<L>And "Oh my prince!" died faltering on my tongue:</L>
<L>Fainting I sunk, unequal to the strife,</L>
<L>And milder joys sustain'd returning life.</L>
<L>Hope, sweet enchantress, round my love-sick head</L>
<L>Delightful scenes of blest delusion spread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Come, come, my prince! my charmer! haste away;</L>
<L>" Come, come, I cried, thy Zara blames thy stay.</L>
<L>" For thee the shrubs their richest sweets retain;</L>
<L>" For thee new colours wait to paint the plain;</L>
<L>" For thee cool breezes linger in the grove,</L>
<L>" The birds expect thee in the green alcove;</L>

<L>" Bright as the sun, yet gentle as the dove,</L>
<L>" He comes, uniting majesty and love."â€”</L>
<L>Too soon, alas! the blest delusion flies;</L>
<L>Care swells my breast, and sorrow fills my eyes.</L>
<L>Ah! why do thy fond words suggest a fear?â€”</L>

<L>Day follow'd day, and still I wish'd the next,</L>

<BYLINE>BY MR. WILLIAM PATTISON.</BYLINE>
<L>IN my dark cell, low prostrate on the ground,</L>
<L>Mourning my crimes, thy letter entrance found;</L>
<L>Too soon my soul the well-known name confest;</L>
<L>My beating heart sprung fiercely in my breast:</L>
<L>Thro' my whole frame a guilty transport glow'd,</L>
<L>And streaming torrents from my eyes fast flow'd.</L>
<L>O Eloisa! art thou still the same?</L>
<L>Dost thou still nourish this destructive flame?</L>
<L>Have not the gentle rules of peace and heaven</L>
<L>From thy soft soul this fatal passion driven?</L>
<L>Alas! I thought thee disengag'd and free;</L>
<L>And can'st thou still, still sigh and weep for me?</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="30"/>What powerful deity, what hallow'd shrine,</L>
<L>Can save me from a love and faith like thine?</L>
<L>Where shall I fly, when not this awful cave,</L>
<L>Whose rugged feet the surging billows lave;</L>
<L>When not these gloomy cloister's solemn walls,</L>
<L>O'er whose rough sides the languid ivy crawls;</L>
<L>When my dread vows in vain their force oppose,</L>
<L>Oppos'd to loveâ€”alas! how vain are vows!</L>
<L>In fruitless penitence I wear away</L>
<L>Each tedious night; each sad revolving day</L>
<L>I fast, I pray; and, with deceitful art,</L>
<L>Veil thy dear image from my tortur'd heart:</L>
<L>My tortur'd heart conflicting passions move,</L>
<L>I hope, despair, repentâ€”yet still I love.</L>
<L>A thousand jarring thoughts my bosom tear,</L>
<L>For thou, not God, O Eloise art there.</L>
<L>To the false world's deluding pleasures dead,</L>
<L>Nor longer by its wandering fires misled,</L>
<L>In learn'd disputes harsh precepts I infuse,</L>
<L>And give that counsel I want power to use.</L>
<L>The rigid maxims of the grave and wise</L>
<L>Have quench'd each milder sparkle of my eyes;</L>
<L>Each lovely feature of this well-known face,</L>
<L>By grief revers'd, assumes a sterner grace.</L>
<L>O Eloisa! should the fates once more,</L>
<L>Indulgent to my view, thy charms restore!</L>
<L>How wouldst thou from my arms with horror start,</L>
<L>To miss the form familiar to thy heart!</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="31"/>Nought could thy quick, thy piercing judgment see,</L>
<L>To speak thy Abelardâ€”but love of thee.</L>
<L>Lean abstinence, pale grief, and haggard care,</L>
<L>The dire attendants of forlorn despair,</L>
<L>Have Abelard the young, the gay, remov'd,</L>
<L>And in the hermit sunk the man you lov'd.</L>
<L>Wrapt in the gloom these holy mansions shed,</L>
<L>The thorny paths of penitence I tread;</L>
<L>Lost to the world, from all its interests free,</L>
<L>And torn from all my soul held dear in thee.</L>
<L>Ambition, with its train of frailties gone,</L>
<L>All love, all forms forgot, but thine alone.</L>
<L>Amid the blaze of day, the dusk of night,</L>
<L>My Eloisa rises to my sight:</L>
<L>Veil'd, as in Paraclete's secluded towers,</L>
<L>The wretched mourner counts the lagging hours;</L>
<L>I hear her sighs, see the swift-falling tears,</L>
<L>Weep all her griefs, and pine with all her cares.</L>
<L>O vows! O convents! your stern force impart,</L>
<L>And frown the melting phantom from my heart:</L>
<L>Let other sighs a worthier sorrow show;</L>
<L>Let other tears, for sin, repentant flow:</L>
<L>Low to the earth my guilty eyes I roll,</L>
<L>And humble to the dust my contrite soul.</L>
<L>Forgiving power! thy gracious call I meet,</L>
<L>Who first impower'd this rebel heart to beat;</L>
<L>Who thro' this trembling, this offending frame,</L>

<L><PB N="30" REF="32"/>O change the temper of this labouring breast,</L>
<L>And form anew each beating pulse to rest!</L>
<L>Let springing grace, fair faith, and hope remove</L>
<L>The fatal traces of destructive love;</L>
<L>Destructive love from its warm mansion tear,</L>
<L>And leave no tracks of Eloisa there.</L>
<L>Are these the wishes of my inmost soul?</L>
<L>Would I its softest, tenderest sense controul?</L>
<L>Would I this touch'd, this glowing heart refine</L>
<L>To the cold substance of that marble shrine?</L>
<L>Transform'd like these pale swarms that round me move</L>
<L>Of blest insensiblesâ€”who know not love?</L>
<L>Ah! rather let me keep this hapless flame;</L>
<L>Adieu, false honour! unavailing fame!</L>
<L>Not your harsh rules, but tender love supplies</L>
<L>The streams that gush from my despairing eyes:</L>

<L>Sent from thy crown I never felt a dart;</L>
<L>The lover, not the monarch, won my heart:</L>
<L>Nor e'er the monarch with such charms appears,</L>
<L>As when the lover's soften'd dress he wears:</L>
<L>As when he, silent, deigns my breast to seek,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whene'er my crimes (if love a crime can be,</L>

<L>One thought of Henry can that gloom controul:</L>
<L>No more my breast alternate passions move,</L>
<L>The frosts of honour melt before the fires of love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Again I must repeat that fatal hour,</L>
<L>Which snatch'd my Henry from his Woodstock bower;</L>
<L>When mad Bellona, with tumultuous cries,</L>
<L>The hero rouz'd, and drown'd the lover's sighs.</L>
<L>Stretch'd on my downy couch at ease I lay,</L>
<L>And sought by reading to beguile the day;</L>
<L>With amorous strains I sooth'd a grateful fire,</L>
<L>And all the woman glow'd with soft desire.</L>
<L>'Till, as I wish'd, I heard the vocal breeze</L>
<L>Proclaim my Henry rustling thro' the trees;</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="39"/>O'erjoy'd, I ran to meet thy longing arms,</L>
<L>And taste a dear remembrance of thy charms;</L>
<L>But soon I saw some sad conceal'd surprize,</L>
<L>Fade on thy cheeks, and languish on thine eyes;</L>
<L>Thro' each dissembled smile a sorrow stole,</L>
<L>And whisper'd out the secret of thy soul.</L>
<L>What this could mean uncertain to divine;</L>
<L>No fault I knew, yet fear'd some fault was mine.</L>
<L>But soon thy love dispell'd those airy fears,</L>
<L>Dispell'd alas!â€”but brought too solid cares.</L>
<L>For as with hands, entwin'd in hands, we walk'd,</L>
<L>Of Love, and hapless lovers, still thou talk'd:</L>
<L>Thy tears of pity answer'd each sad moan,</L>
<L>And in their seeming miseries wept thy own.</L>
<L>" I cannot leave her!"â€”I o'erheard thee say,â€”</L>
<L>Pierc'd to the soul, I sunk, and died away.</L>
<L>What art restor'd me, thou alone canst tell,</L>

<L>Again thou dost my sweet physician prove,</L>
<L>From death to life alternately I move,</L>
<L>Now dead by anguish, now reviv'd by love.</L>
<L>But when, without disguise, the truth I found,</L>
<L>My agonizing sorrows knew no bound:</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="40"/>My locks I tore; then all-intranc'd I lay,</L>

<L>The pretty lisper whistles Henry's name:</L>

<HEAD>ABELARD TO ELOISA.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE LATE MR. CAWTHORNE, MASTER OF TUNBRIDGE-SCHOOL.</BYLINE>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Abelard and Eloisa flourished in the twelfth century: they were two of the most distinguished persons of their age in learning and beauty, but for nothing more famous than for their unfortunate passion. After a long course of calamities, they retired each to a several convent, and consecrated the remainder of their days to religion. It was many years after this separation, that a letter of Abelard's to a friend, which contained the hisâˆ£tory of his misfortunes, fell into the hands of Eloisa: this occasioned those celebrated letters (out of which the following is partly extracted), which give so lively a picture of the struggles of grace and nature, virtue and passion.</P>
<P>MR. POPE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>AH, why this boding start? this sudden pain,</L>
<L>That wings my pulse, and shoots from vein to vein?</L>
<L>What mean, regardless of yon midnight bell,</L>
<L>These earth-born visions saddening o'er my cell?</L>
<L><PB N="48" REF="50"/>What strange disorder prompts these thoughts to glow?</L>
<L>These sighs to murmur, and these tears to flow?</L>
<L>'Tis she, 'tis Eloisa's form restor'd,</L>
<L>Once a pure saint, and more than saints ador'd:</L>
<L>She comes in all her killing charms confest,</L>
<L>Glares thro' the gloom, and pours upon my breast,</L>
<L>Bid heaven's bright guard from Paraclete remove,</L>
<L>And drags me back to misery and love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Enjoy thy triumphs, dear illusion! see</L>
<L>This sad apostate from his God to thee;</L>
<L>See, at thy call, my guilty warmths return,</L>
<L>Flame thro' my blood, and steal me from my urn.</L>
<L>Yet, yet, frail Abelard! one effort try,</L>
<L>Ere the last lingering spark of virtue die;</L>
<L>The deadly charming sorceress controul,</L>
<L>And spite of nature tear her from thy soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long has that soul in these unsocial woods,</L>
<L>Where anguish muses, and where horror broods,</L>
<L>From love's wild visionary wishes stray'd,</L>
<L>And sought to lose thy beauties in the shade,</L>
<L>Faith dropt a smile, devotion lent her fire,</L>
<L>Woke the keen pang, and sanctified desire;</L>
<L>Led me enraptur'd to the blest abode,</L>
<L>And taught my heart to glow with all its God.</L>
<L>But oh, how weak fair faith and virtue prove!</L>
<L>When Eloisa melts away in love!</L>
<L><PB N="49" REF="51"/>When her fond soul impassion'd, rapt, unveil'd,</L>
<L>No joy forgotten, and no wish conceal'd,</L>
<L>Flows thro' her pen as infant softness free,</L>
<L>And fiercely springs in ecstasies to me.</L>
<L>Ye heavens! as walking in yon sacred fane</L>
<L>With every seraph warm in every vein,</L>
<L>Just as remorse had rous'd an aking sigh,</L>
<L>And my torn soul hung trembling in my eye,</L>
<L>In that kind hour thy fatal letter came,</L>
<L>I saw, I gaz'd, I shiver'd at the name;</L>
<L>The conscious lamps at once forgot to shine,</L>
<L>Prophetic tremors shook the hallow'd shrine;</L>
<L>Priests, censers, altars from thy genius fled,</L>
<L>And heaven itself shut on me while I read.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dear smiling mischief! art thou still the same,</L>
<L>The still pale victim of too soft a flame?</L>
<L>Warm, as when first with more than mortal shine</L>
<L>Each melting eye-ball mix'd thy soul with mine?</L>
<L>Have not thy tears for ever taught to flow,</L>
<L>The glooms of absence, and the pangs of woe,</L>
<L>The pomp of sacrifice, the whisper'd tale,</L>
<L>The dreadful vow yet hovering o'er thy veil,</L>
<L>Drove this bewitching fondness from thy breast?</L>
<L>Curb'd the loose wish, and form'd each pulse to rest?</L>
<L>And canst thou still, still bend the suppliant knee</L>
<L>To love's dead shrine, and weep and sigh for me?</L>
<L>Then take me, take me, lock me in thy arms,</L>
<L>Spring to my lips, and give me all thy charms:</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="52"/>No, fly me, fly me, spread th' impatient sail,</L>
<L>Steal the lark's wing, and mount the swiftest gale;</L>
<L>Skim the last ocean, freeze beneath the pole;</L>
<L>Renounce me, curse me, root thee from thy soul;</L>
<L>Fly, fly, for justice bares the arm of God;</L>
<L>And the grasp'd vengeance only waits his nod.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Are these my wishes? can they thus aspire?</L>
<L>Does phrenzy form them, or does grace inspire?</L>
<L>Can Abelard, in hurricanes of zeal,</L>
<L>Betray his heart, and teach thee not to feel?</L>
<L>Teach thy enamour'd spirit to disown</L>
<L>Each human warmth, and chill thee into stone?</L>
<L>Ah, rather let my tenderest accents move</L>
<L>The last wild tumults of unholy love!</L>
<L>On that dear bosom trembling let me lie,</L>
<L>Pour out my soul, and in fierce raptures die,</L>
<L>Rouze all my passions, act my joys anew,</L>

<L>O generous Mackworth! could the muse impart</L>
<L>A labour worthy thy auspicious art;</L>
<L>Like thee succeed in paths untrod before,</L>
<L>And secret treasures of the land explore;</L>
<L>Apollo's self should on the labour smile,</L>
<L>And Delphos quit for Britain's fruitful isle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where fair Sabrina flows around the coast,</L>
<L>And aged Dovey in the ocean's lost,</L>
<L>Her lofty brows unconquer'd Britain rears,</L>
<L>And fenc'd with rocks impregnable appears;</L>
<L>Which like the well-fix'd bars of nature show,</L>
<L>To guard the treasures she conceals below.</L>
<L>For Earth, distorted with her pregnant womb,</L>
<L>Heaves up to give the forming embryo room:</L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="68"/>Hence vast excrescencies of hills arise,</L>
<L>And mountains swell to a portentous size.</L>
<L>Louring and black the rugged coast appears,</L>
<L>The sullen earth a gloomy surface wears;</L>
<L>Yet all beneath, deep as the centre, shines</L>
<L>With native wealth, and more than India's mines.</L>
<L>Thus erring Nature her defects supplies,</L>
<L>Indulgent oft to what her sons despise:</L>

<L>The antient Britons are a hardy race,</L>
<L>Averse to luxury and slothful ease;</L>
<L>Their necks beneath a foreign yoke ne'er bow'd,</L>
<L>In war unconquer'd, and of freedom proud;</L>
<L>With minds resolv'd they lasting toils endure,</L>
<L>Unmix'd their language, and their manners pure.</L>
<L><PB N="67" REF="69"/>Wisely does nature such an offspring chuse,</L>
<L>Brave to defend her wealth, and slow to use.</L>
<L>Where thirst of empire ne'er inflames their veins,</L>

<L>But, low in mines, they constant toils renew,</L>
<L>And thro' the earth their branching veins pursue.</L>

<L>Contending divers would the wreck regain,</L>
<L>And make reprisals on the grasping main:</L>
<L>Wild in pursuit they are endanger'd more,</L>
<L>Than when they combated the storms before.</L>
<L>The miner thus thro' perils digs his way,</L>
<L>Equal to theirs, and deeper than the sea;</L>
<L>Drawing, in pestilential steams, his breath,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to conquer, tho' he combats death.</L>
<L>Night's gloomy realms his pointed steel invades,</L>
<L>The courts of Pluto, and infernal shades:</L>
<L>He cuts thro' mountains, subterraneous lakes,</L>
<L>Plying his work, each nervous stroke he takes</L>
<L>Loosens the earth, and the whole cavern shakes.</L>
<L>Thus, with his brawny arms, the Cyclops stands,</L>
<L>To form Jove's lightning with uplifted hands;</L>

<L>The anvil yields, and Aetna groans below.</L>

<L>Thy speedy sails, and useful engines, show</L>
<L>A genius richer than the mines below.</L>
<L>Thousands of slaves unskill'd Peru maintains;</L>
<L>The hands that labour still exhaust the gains:</L>
<L>The winds, thy slaves, their useful succour join,</L>
<L>Convey thy ore, and labour at thy mine;</L>
<L>Instructed by thy arts, a power they find</L>
<L>To vanquish realms, where once they lay confin'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Downward, my muse, direct thy steepy flight,</L>
<L>Where smiling shades, and bounteous realms invite;</L>
<L>I first of British bards invoke thee down,</L>
<L>And first with wealth thy graceful temples crown,</L>

<L>The offspring shines with its paternal light:</L>

<L>THE virgin, when soften'd by May,</L>

<L>The birds sweetly bill on the spray,</L>

<L>On Ida bright Venus may reign,</L>

<L>We shepherds, that live on the plain,</L>

<L>From the west, as it wantonly blows,</L>
<L>Fond zephyr caresses the pine;</L>
<L>The bee steals a kiss from the rose,</L>
<L>And willows and woodbines entwine:</L>
<L>The pinks by the rivulet's side,</L>
<L>That border the vernal alcove,</L>
<L>Bend downwards to kiss the soft tide,</L>
<L>For May is the mother of love.</L>
</LG>

<L>May tinges the butterfly's wing;</L>
<L>He flutters in bridal array:</L>
<L>If the larks and the linnets now sing,</L>
<L>Their music is taught them by May,</L>
<L><PB N="90" REF="92"/>The stock-dove, recluse with her mate,</L>

<L>OH, born to bless some youth unknown,</L>
<L>Fâ€”, thy beauties all will own;</L>
<L>Yet all who know you will confess</L>
<L>Your beauty than your merit less.</L>
<L>One who deserves you would you chuse?</L>

<L>Him, who alone should call you wife,</L>
<L>That dear, dear name in which are join'd</L>
<L>All that can charm or sooth the mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let me, my fair, direct your choice,</L>
<L>For that alone is my advice.</L>
<L>Rules for behaviour I'll not give,</L>
<L>Those from an abler hand receive,</L>
<L>For them to Lyttleton attend,</L>
<L>He, tho' a poet, is a friend,</L>
<L>And trust me, I, my gentle dame,</L>
<L>Altho' no poet, am the same.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Would you be happy?â€”Yes, you wou'd:</L>
<L>Then let the favour'd youth be good,</L>
<L>Else every tender thought remove,</L>
<L>Where there's no virtue, far be love,</L>
<L><PB N="98" REF="100"/>But where bright glows that heavenly flame,</L>
<L>Virtue and love become the same.</L>
<L>Scorning the pert, the dull, the vain,</L>

<L>Let fair sincerity and truth</L>
<L>Adorn thine only-favour'd youth,</L>
<L>To these humility be join'd,</L>
<L>That fairest virtue of the mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mark well his looks: let them impart</L>
<L>The genuine fondness of the heart,</L>
<L>That ever in the looks appears</L>
<L>A fondness form'd of hopes and fears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mark his behaviour: love inspires</L>
<L>Respectful awe amidst its fires,</L>
<L>His trembling hand to yours when join'd,</L>
<L>Speaks the soft awe that fills his mind,</L>
<L>His words, his actions should proclaim</L>
<L>A pure, a true, and real flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be sure let cheerfulness divine</L>
<L>Inspire the heart that's made for thine,</L>
<L>For that, when join'd with manly sense,</L>
<L>Pleasures perpetual will dispense.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These virtues let us now unite</L>
<L>To place them in the fairest light,</L>
<L>And see how lovely they'll appear:â€”</L>
<L>He must be good, must be sincere,</L>
<L>Be true, be humble, and his love</L>
<L>Be pure as virtue may approve,</L>
<L><PB N="99" REF="101"/>Respectful fondness must he show,</L>
<L>And round him cheerfulness must throw</L>
<L>Her pleasing light, her beams divine,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus have I drawn th' ideal man</L>
<L>That may deserve deserving * * *.</L>
<L>And know you none whom this is like?</L>
<L>None where resemblance strong may strike?</L>
<L>Or is there this distinguish'd one?â€”</L>
<L>Be he or not as yet unknown</L>
<L>Have him, my lovely maid, or none.</L>

<LG>
<L>On foreign or on English ground</L>
<L>If this deserving youth be found,</L>
<L>In whom these merits all combine,</L>
<L>Bring him to me to make him thine:</L>
<L>I'll exercise my magic powers,</L>
<L>And date from thence your happiest hours.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if, rejecting my advice,</L>
<L>As fancy's form, and over-nice,</L>
<L>To one unlike you'll give your charms,</L>
<L>And take th' unworthy to your arms,</L>
<L>Trust me, my office I'll decline;</L>
<L>The hateful deed shall ne'er be mine,</L>

<L>IN antient days (as jovial Horace sings)</L>

<L>To name the vicious, and the vice to paint;</L>
<L>Th' enliven'd picture from the canvas flew,</L>
<L>And the strong likeness crouded on the view.</L>
<L>Our author practises more general rules,</L>
<L>He is no niggard of his knaves and fools:</L>
<L>Both small and great, both dull and pert he shews,</L>
<L>That every gentleman may pick and chuse.</L>
<L>The laws dramatic tho' he scarcely knows</L>
<L>Of time and place, and all the piteous prose,</L>
<L>Which pedant Frenchmen snuffle thro' their nose.</L>
<L>Fools!â€”who prescribe what Homer should have done,</L>
<L>Like tattling watches they correct the sun.</L>
<L>Criticsâ€”like postsâ€”undoubtedly may show</L>
<L>The way to Pindusâ€”but they cannot go.</L>
<L>For to delight and elevate the mind,</L>

<L>Fancy precedes and conquers all the mind,</L>
<L>Deliberating judgment slowly lags behind,</L>
<L>Comes to the field with blunderbuss and gun,</L>
<L>Like heavy Falstaff, when the work is done,</L>
<L>Fights, when the battle's o'er, with wondrous pain</L>
