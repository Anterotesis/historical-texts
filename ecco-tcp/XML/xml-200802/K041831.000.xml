<HEAD>NIGHT.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN foes insult, and <HI>prudent</HI> friends dispense,</L>
<L>In pity's strains, the worst of insolence,</L>
<L>Oft with thee, LLOYD, I steal an hour from grief,</L>
<L>And in thy social converse find relief.</L>
<L>The mind, of solitude, impatient grown,</L>
<L>Loves any sorrows rather than her own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LET slaves to business, bodies without soul,</L>
<L>Important blanks in Nature's mighty roll,</L>
<L>Solemnize nonsense in the day's broad glare,</L>
<L>We NIGHT prefer, which heals or hides our care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
<L>ROGUES justified and by success made bold,</L>
<L>Dull fools and coxcombs sanctified by Gold,</L>
<L>Freely may bask in fortune's partial ray,</L>
<L>And spread their feathers op'ning to the day;</L>
<L>But <HI>thread-bare</HI> Merit dares not shew the head</L>
<L>'Till vain Prosperity retires to bed.</L>
<L>Missortunes, like the Owl, avoid the light;</L>
<L>The sons of CARE are always sons of NIGHT.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Wretch bred up in Method's drowsy school,</L>
<L>Whose only merit is to err by rule,</L>
<L>Who ne'er thro' heat of blood was tripping caught,</L>
<L>Nor guilty deem'd of one eccentric thought,</L>
<L>Whose soul directed to no use is seen</L>
<L>Unless to move the body's dull Machine;</L>
<L>Which, clock-work like, with the same equal pace,</L>
<L>Still travels on thro' life's insipid space,</L>
<L>Turns up his eyes to think that there should be</L>
<L>Among God's creatures too such things as <HI>we.</HI></L>
<L>Then for his night-cap calls, and thanks the pow'rs</L>
<L>Which kindly give him grace to keep <HI>good hours.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Good hours—</HI>Fine words—but was it ever seen</L>
<L>That all men could agree in what they mean?</L>
<L>FLORIO, who many years a course hath run</L>
<L>In downright opposition to the sun,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4"/>
Expatiates on <HI>good hours,</HI> their cause defends</L>
<L>With as much vigour as our PRUDENT FRIENDS.</L>
<L>Th' uncertain term no settled notion brings,</L>
<L>But still in diff'rent mouths mean diff'rent things.</L>
<L>Each takes the phrase in his own private view,</L>
<L>With PRUDENCE it is ten, with FLORIO two.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Go on, ye fools, who talk for talking sake,</L>
<L>Without distinguishing distinctions make;</L>
<L>Shine forth in native folly, native pride,</L>
<L>Make yourselves rules to all the world beside;</L>
<L>Reason, collected in herself disdains</L>
<L>The slavish yoke of arbitrary chains,</L>
<L>Steady and true each circumstance she weighs,</L>
<L>Nor to bare <HI>words</HI> inglorious tribute pays.</L>
<L>Men of sense live exempt from vulgar awe,</L>
<L>And Reason to herself alone is law.</L>
<L>That freedom she enjoys with lib'ral mind</L>
<L>Which she as freely grants to all mankind.</L>
<L>No idol titled name her rev'rence stirs,</L>
<L>No hour she blindly to the rest prefers,</L>
<L>All are alike, if they're alike employ'd,</L>
<L>And all are good if <HI>virtuously</HI> enjoy'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LET the sage DOCTOR (think him one we know)</L>
<L>With scraps of antient learning overflow,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
In all the dignity of <HI>wig</HI> declare</L>
<L>The fatal consequence of midnight air,</L>
<L>How damps and vapours as it were by stealth,</L>
<L>Undermine life, and sap the walls of health.</L>
<L>For me let GALEN moulder on the shelf,</L>
<L>I'll live, and be physician to myself.</L>
<L>Whilst soul is join'd to body, whether fate</L>
<L>Allot a longer or a shorter date;</L>
<L>I'll make them live, as brother should with brother,</L>
<L>And keep them in good humour with each other.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE surest road to health, say what they will,</L>
<L>Is never to suppose we shall be ill.</L>
<L>Most of those evils we poor mortals know</L>
<L>From doctors and imagination flow.</L>
<L>Hence to old women with your boasted rules,</L>
<L>Stale traps, and only sacred now to fools;</L>
<L>As well may sons of physic hope to find</L>
<L>One medicine, as one hour, for all mankind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IF RUPERT after ten is out of bed</L>
<L>The fool next morning can't hold up his head,</L>
<L>What reason this which <HI>me</HI> to bed must call</L>
<L>Whose head (thank heaven) never aches at all?</L>
<L>In diff'rent courses diff'rent tempers run,</L>
<L>He hates the Moon, I sicken at the sun.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
Wound up at twelve, at noon <HI>his</HI> clock goes right,</L>
<L><HI>Mine</HI> better goes, wound up at twelve at night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN in Oblivion's grateful cup I drown</L>
<L>The galling sneer, the supercilious frown,</L>
<L>The strange reserve, the proud affected state</L>
<L>Of upstart knaves grown rich and fools grown great.</L>
<L>No more that abject wretch disturbs my rest</L>
<L>Who meanly overlooks a friend distrest.</L>
<L>Purblind to poverty the Worldling goes,</L>
<L>And scarce sees rags an inch beyond his nose.</L>
<L>But from a croud can single out his grace</L>
<L>And cringe and creep to fools who strut in lace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHETHER those classic regions are survey'd</L>
<L>Where we in earliest youth together stray'd,</L>
<L>Where hand in hand we trod the flow'ry shore,</L>
<L>Tho' now thy happier genius runs before,</L>
<L>When we conspir'd a thankless wretch to raise,</L>
<L>And taught a <HI>stump</HI> to shoot with pilser'd praise,</L>
<L>Who once for <HI>Rev'rend</HI> merit famous grown</L>
<L>Gratefully strove to kick his MAKER down,</L>
<L>Or if more gen'ral arguments engage,</L>
<L>The court or camp, the pulpit, bar, or stage,</L>
<L>If half-bred surgeons, whom men doctors call,</L>
<L>And lawyers, who were never bred at all,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
Those mighty-letter'd monsters of the earth,</L>
<L>Our pity move, or exercise our mirth,</L>
<L>Or if in tittle-tattle tooth-pick way</L>
<L>Our rambling thoughts with easy freedom stray,</L>
<L>A gainer still thy friend himself must find,</L>
<L>His grief suspended, and improv'd his mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHILST peaceful slumbers bless the homely bed,</L>
<L>Where virtue, self-approv'd, reclines her head;</L>
<L>Whilst vice beneath imagin'd horrors mourns,</L>
<L>And conscience plants the villains couch with thorns,</L>
<L>Impatient of restraint, the active mind,</L>
<L>No more by servile prejudice confin'd,</L>
<L>Leaps from her seat, as wak'ned from a trance,</L>
<L>And darts through Nature at a single glance.</L>
<L>Then we our friends, our foes, ourselves, survey,</L>
<L>And see by NIGHT what fools we are by DAY.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>STRIPT of her gaudy plumes and vain disguise</L>
<L>See where Ambition mean and loathsome lies!</L>
<L>Reflexion with relentless hand pulls down</L>
<L>The tyrant's bloody wreath and ravish'd crown.</L>
<L>In vain he tells of battles bravely won,</L>
<L>Of nations conquer'd, and of Worlds undone;</L>
<L>Triumphs like these but ill with Manhood suit,</L>
<L>And sink the conqueror beneath the brute.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
But if in searching round the world we find</L>
<L>Some gen'rous youth, the Friend of all mankind,</L>
<L>Whose anger, like the bolt of JOVE, is sped</L>
<L>In terrors only at the guilty head,</L>
<L>Whose mercies, like Heav'n's dew, refreshing fall</L>
<L>In gen'ral love and charity to all,</L>
<L>Pleas'd we behold such worth on any throne,</L>
<L>And doubly pleas'd we find it on our own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THROUGH a false medium things are shewn by day,</L>
<L>Pomp, wealth, and titles judgment lead astray.</L>
<L>How many from appearance borrow state</L>
<L>Whom NIGHT disdains to number with the Great!</L>
<L>Must not we laugh to see you <HI>lordling</HI> proud</L>
<L>Snuff up vile incense from a fawning croud?</L>
<L>Whilst in his beam surrounding clients play,</L>
<L>Like insects in the sun's enliv'ning ray,</L>
<L>Whilst, JEHU like, he drives at furious rate,</L>
<L>And seems the only charioteer of state,</L>
<L>Talking himself into a little God,</L>
<L>And ruling empires with a single nod,</L>
<L>Who would not think, to hear him law dispense,</L>
<L>That he had Int'rest, and that they had sense?</L>
<L>Injurious thought! beneath NIGHT's honest shade</L>
<L>When pomp is buried and false colours fade,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="9"/>
Plainly we see at that impartial hour</L>
<L><HI>Them</HI> dupes to pride, and <HI>him</HI> the tool of pow'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>GOD help the man, condemn'd by cruel fate</L>
<L>To court the seeming, or the real great.</L>
<L>Much sorrow shall he feel, and suffer more</L>
<L>Than any slave who labours at the oar.</L>
<L>By slavish methods must he learn to please,</L>
<L>By smooth-tongu'd flatt'ry, that curst <HI>court-disease,</HI></L>
<L>Supple to ev'ry wayward mood strike sail,</L>
<L>And shift with shifting humour's peevish gale.</L>
<L>To Nature dead he must adopt vile art,</L>
<L>And wear a smile, with anguish in his heart.</L>
<L>A sense of honour would destroy his schemes,</L>
<L>And conscience ne'er must speak unless in dreams.</L>
<L>When he hath tamely borne for many years</L>
<L>Cold looks, forbidding frowns, contemptuous sneers,</L>
<L>When he at last expects, good easy man,</L>
<L>To reap the profits of his labour'd plan,</L>
<L>Some cringing LACQUEY, or rapacious WHORE,</L>
<L>To favours of the great the surest door,</L>
<L>Some CATAMITE, or PIMP, in credit grown,</L>
<L>Who tempts another's wife, or sells his own,</L>
<L>Steps cross his hopes, the promis'd boon denies,</L>
<L>And for some MINION'S MINION claims the prize.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<L>FOE to restraint, unpractis'd in deceir,</L>
<L>Too resolute, from Nature's active heat,</L>
<L>To brook affronts, and tamely pass them by;</L>
<L>Too proud to flatter, too sincere to lie,</L>
<L>Too plain to please, too honest to be great;</L>
<L>Give me, kind Heaven, an humbler, happier state:</L>
<L>Far from the place where men with pride deceive,</L>
<L>Where rascals promise, and where fools believe;</L>
<L>Far from the walk of folly, vice and strife,</L>
<L>Calm, independent, let me steal thro life,</L>
<L>Nor one vain wish my steady thoughts beguile</L>
<L>To fear his lordship's frown, or court his smile.</L>
<L>Unfit for greatness, I her snares defy,</L>
<L>And look on riches with untainted eye.</L>
<L>To others let the glitt'ring bawbles fall,</L>
<L>Content shall place <HI>us</HI> far above them all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SPECTATORS only on this bustling stage.</L>
<L>We see what vain designs mankind engage.</L>
<L>Vice after vice with ardour they pursue,</L>
<L>And one old folly brings forth twenty new.</L>
<L>Perplex'd with trifles thro' the vale of life,</L>
<L>Man strives 'gainst man, without a cause for strife;</L>
<L>Armies embattled meet, and thousands bleed,</L>
<L>For some vile spot which cannot fifty feed.</L>

Squirrels for nuts contend, and, wrong or right,</L>
<L>For the world's empire kings ambitious fight,</L>
<L>What odds?<HI>—to us</HI> 'tis all the self-same thing,</L>
<L>A NUT, a WORLD, a SQUIRREL, and a KING.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BRITONS, like Roman spirits fam'd of old,</L>
<L>Are cast by Nature in a PATRIOT mould;</L>
<L>No private joy, no private grief they know,</L>
<L>Their soul's engross'd by public weal or woe.</L>
<L>Inglorious ease like ours, they greatly scorn:</L>
<L>Let care with nobler wreaths their brows adorn.</L>
<L>Gladly they toil beneath the statesman's pains,</L>
<L>Give them but credit for a statesman's brains.</L>
<L>All would be deem'd e'en from the cradle fit</L>
<L>To rule in politics as well as wit.</L>
<L>The grave, the gay, the fopling, and the dunce,</L>
<L>Start up (God bless us!) statesmen all at once.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HIS mighty charge of souls the priest forgets,</L>
<L>The court-bred lord his promises and debts,</L>
<L>Soldiers their same, misers forget their pelf,</L>
<L>The rake his mistress, and the fop himself,</L>
<L>Whilst thoughts of higher moment claim their care,</L>
<L>And their wife heads the weight of kingdoms bear.</L>

<L>FEMALES themselves the glorious ardour feel,</L>
<L>And boast an equal, or a greater zeal.</L>
<L>From nymph to nymph the state infection flies,</L>
<L>Swells in her breast, and sparkles in her eyes.</L>
<L>O'er whelm'd by politics lye malice, pride,</L>
<L>Envy and twenty other faults beside.</L>
<L>No more their little flutt'ring hearts confess</L>
<L>A passion for applause, or rage for dress;</L>
<L>No more they pant for PUBLIC RAREE-SHOWS,</L>
<L>Or lose one thought on monkeys or on beaux.</L>
<L>Coquettes no more pursue the jilting plan,</L>
<L>And lustful prudes forget to rail at man.</L>
<L>The darling theme CAECILIA's self will chuse,</L>
<L>Nor thinks of scandal whilst she talks of news.</L>

<L>The CIT, a COMMON-COUNCIL-MAN by place,</L>
<L>Ten thousand mighty nothings in his face,</L>
<L>By situation as by nature great,</L>
<L>With nice precision parcels out the state,</L>
<L>Proves and disproves, affirms and then denies,</L>
<L>Objects himself, and to himself replies,</L>
<L>Wielding aloft the Politician rod,</L>
<L>Makes P—by turns a devil and a god,</L>
<L>Maintains e'en to the very teeth of pow'r</L>
<L>The same thing right and wrong in half an hour,</L>

Now all is well, now he suspects a plot,</L>
<L>And plainly proves, WHATEVER IS, IS NOT.</L>
<L>Fearfully wise, he shakes his empty head,</L>
<L>And deals out empires as he deals out thread.</L>
<L>His useless scales are in a corner flung,</L>
<L>And Europe's balance hangs upon his tongue.</L>

<L>PEACE to such triflers, be our happier plan</L>
<L>To pass thro' life as easy as we can.</L>
<L>Who's in or out, who moves this grand machine,</L>
<L>Nor stirs my curiosity nor spleen.</L>
<L>Secrets of state no more I wish to know</L>

<L>Lament those hardships which <HI>we</HI> cannot feel.</L>

<L>But must I bellow too, who sit at ease?</L>
<L>By custom safe the poet's numbers flow,</L>
