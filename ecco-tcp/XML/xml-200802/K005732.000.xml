<P>THE PADLOCK: A COMIC OPERA: As it is perform'd by HIS MAJESTY'S SERVANTS, AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>SHOULD any one be curious about the origin of this petty Drama, they will find the story on which it is founded, among the twelve Exemplary Novels written by the celebrated Author of Don Quixote; under the title of The Jealous Husband. Some little variation has been necessary in the ground-work, in order to render it dramatic; but the characters are untouched from the inimitable pencil of the first de∣signer; unless the dialogue with which the English writer supplies them has done them an injury. The chief addition to the fable is the circumstance of the padlock, and the four last lines of the opera sufficiently mark the place from whence that is taken.</P>

<P>Where is Leonora?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>In her chamber, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deig.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is the key of it; there the key of the best hall; there the key of the door upon the first flight of stairs; there the key of the door upon the second; this double locks the hatch below; and this the door that opens into the entry.</P>

<SPEAKER>Urs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am acquainted with every ward of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deig.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Ursula, when I took Leonora from her father and mother, she was to live in the house with me three months; at the expiration of which time, I entered into a bond of four thousand pistoles, either to return her to them spotless, with half that sum for a dowry, or make her my true and lawful wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Urs.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, I warrant you, they came secretly to enquire of me whether they might venture to trust your worship; Lord! said I, I have lived with the gentleman nine years and three quarters, come Lam∣mas, and never saw any thing uncivil by him in my life; nor no more I ever did; and to let your worship know, if I had, you would have mistaken your per∣son; for, I bless Heaven, tho' I'm poor, I'm honest, and would not live with any man alive that should want to handle me unlawfully.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deig.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ursula, I do believe it; and, you are parti∣cularly happy, that both your age and your person ex∣empt you from any such temptation. But, be this as it will, Leonora's parents, after some little difficulty, consented to comply with my proposal; and, being fully satisfied with their daughter's temper and conduct, which I wanted to be acquainted with, this day being the expiration of the term, I am resolved to fulfil my bond by marrying her to-morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Urs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven bless you together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deig.</SPEAKER>
<P>During the time she has lived with me, she has never been a moment out of my sight; and now, tell me, Ursula, what you have observed in her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Urs.</SPEAKER>
<P>All meekness and gentleness, your worship; and yet, I warrant you, shrewd and sensible; egad, when she pleases she can be as sharp as a needle.</P>

<P>You have not been able to discover any par∣ticular attachments?</P>

<P>Ay, ay, of the kitten, and your worship, and her birds, and going to mass. I have taken notice of late, that she is mighty fond of going to mass, as your worship lets her early of a morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deig.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! I am now going to her parents, to let them know my resolution; I will not take her with me, because having been used to confinement, and it being the life I am determined she shall lead, it will be only giving her a bad habit. I shall return with the good folks to morrow morning; in the mean time, Ursula, I confide in your attention, and take care as you would merit my favour.</P>

<P>Heigho!—I think I'm sick.—He's very good to me to be sure, and its my duty to love him, because we ought not to be ungrateful; but, I wish I was not to marry him for all that, tho' I am afraid to tell him so. Fine feathers, they say, make fine birds; but, I am sure they don't make happy ones; a sparrow is happier in the fields than a gold-finch in a cage. There is something makes me mighty uneasy. While he was talking to me, I thought I never saw any thing look so ugly in my life—O dear now, why did I forget to ask leave to go to mass to-morrow? I suppose because he's abroad Ursula won't take me—I wish I had asked leave to go to mass.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leand.</SPEAKER>
<P>His name is Don Deigo; there's his house like another monastery, or rather prison; his servants are an ancient duenna, and a Negro slave—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1<HI>st Schol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And after having lived fifty years a bat∣chelor, this old fellow has pick'd up a young thing of sixteen, whom he by chance saw in a balcony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, her parents are decay'd gentry, that live about a mile or two from Salamanca here; and he has made the most ridiculous agreement with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2<HI>d. Schol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And you are in love with the girl?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leand.</SPEAKER>
<P>To desperation, and I believe I am not in∣different to her; for finding that her jealous guardian took her to the chapel of a neighbouring convent every morning before it was light, I went there in the habit of a pilgrim, planting myself as near her as I could; I then varied my appearance, continuing to do so from time to time, till I was convinced she had sufficiently remarked, and understood my meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1<HI>st Schol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Leander, I'll say that for you, there is not a more industrious lad in the university of Salamanca, when a wench is to be feritted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2<HI>d Schol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But, pr'ythee, tell us now, how did you get information?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leand.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, from report, which raised my curio∣sity; and afterwards from the Negro I just now men∣tioned: I observ'd that when the family was gone to bed, he often came to air himself at yonder grate; you know I am no bad chanter, nor a very scurvy minstrel, so taking a guittar, clapping a black patch on my eye, and a swathe upon one of my legs, I soon scraped ac∣quaintance with my friend Mungo. He adores my songs and sarabands, and taking me for a poor cripple, often repays me with a share of his allowance, which I ac∣cept to avoid suspicion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1<HI>st Schol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Leand.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, Sir, he has told me all the secrets of his family, and one worth knowing; for he in∣formed me last night, that his master will this evening take a short journey into the country, from whence he proposes not to return till to-morrow, leaving his young wife that is to be, behind him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2<HI>d Schol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! let's scale the wall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fair and softly, I will this instant go and put on my disguise, watch for the Don's going out, attack my Negro a fresh, and try if by his means I cannot come into the house, or at least get a sight of my charming angel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1<HI>st Schol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Angel! Is she then so handsome!</P>

<P>It is time for us to withdraw: come to my chambers; and there you shall know all you can desire.</P>

<L>That vernal zephyr blows;</L>
<L>Her cheeks transcend the rose's bloom;</L>
<L>And sweeter is the rich perfume</L>

<P>With the precautions I have taken, I think I run no risk in quitting my house for a short time; Leo∣nora has never shewn the least inclination to deceive me; besides, my old woman is prudent and faithful, she has all the keys, and will not part with them from herself: but, suppose—suppose—by the rood and Saint Francis, I will not leave it in her power to do mis∣chief; a woman's not having it in her power to de∣ceive you is the best security for her fidelity, and the only one a wise man will confide in; fast bind, fast find, is an excellent proverb: I'll e'en lock her up with the rest; there is a hasp to the door, and I have a padlock within which shall be my guarantee; I will wait till the Negro returns with provisions, which he is gone to purchase; and clapping them all up together, make my mind easy by having the key they are under in my pocket.</P>

<P>For you must understand, Sir, to play a trick upon a grave discreet matron.—And yet, after all, by my faith, I don't wonder you should love the young thing under my care; for it is one of the sweetest con∣ditioned souls that ever I was acquainted with; and, between ourselves, our Donn-ee is too old for such a babe.</P>

<P>All dark, all quiet, gone to bed and fast asleep I warrant them; however I am not sorry that I altered my first intention of staying out the whole night; and meeting Leonora's father on the road, was at any rate a lucky incident. I will not disturb them; but, since I have let myself in with my master key, go softly to bed; I shall be able to strike a light, and then I think I may say, my cares are over.</P>
<P>Good heavens! what a wonderful deal of uneasi∣ness may mortals avoid by a little prudence! I doubt not now, there are some men who would have gone out in my situation; and, trusting to the goodness of fortune, left their house and their honour in the care of an unexperienced girl, or the discretion of a mer∣cenary servant. While he is abroad, he is tormented with fears and jealousies; and when he returns home, he pro∣bably finds disorder, and perhaps shame. But what do I do—I put a padlock on my door, and all is safe.</P>

<P>Thus then my hopes and cares are at once frustrated; possess'd of what I thought a jewel, I was desirous to keep it for myself; I rais'd up the walls of this house to a great height, I barr'd up my windows towards the street, I put double bolts on my doors; I banish'd all that had the shadow of man, or male kind; and I stood continually centinel over it myself, to guard my suspicion from surprize; thus secur'd, I left my watch for one little moment, and in that mo∣ment——</P>

<P>Pray, pray, guardian, let me tell you the story, and you'll find I am not to blame.</P>
