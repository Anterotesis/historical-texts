<P>A very consciencious Resolution truly—But, Captain, wou'd you be less open and daring in your Attempts, you might hope to succeed—The old Gentleman, you know, is cautious to a Degree; his Daughter is under a strict Confinement; and wou'd you use more of the Fox than the Lion, Fortune may perhaps throw an Op∣portunity in your Way—But you must have Patience.</P>

<P>I hope, Sir, there's no harm in reading a harmless Poem.</P>

<P>Give me the Book, I say, Huswife—Poems with a Pox, what are they good for?

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you your Duty, and a Fig for Desires—No, no, Mistress; Delays are dangerous in these Cases—Mr. <HI>Cuckoo</HI> is a brisk young Fellow, and a little Fea∣ther-bed Doctrine will soon put the Cap∣tain out of your Head—and to put you out of his Power, you shall be given over to the Squire to Morrow.</P>

<P>Why one cannot find a Mon out in this same <HI>London,</HI> there are so many Ta∣veruns and Chockling-Housen, you may as well seek a Needle in a Hay Fardel, as they sayn in the Country—I was at Squire's Lodging yonder, and there was no body, but a prate a pace whorson of a Footboy, and he told me Maister was at Chockling-House, and the while the Vixen did nothing but taunt and laugh at me, or so—I Cod I cou'd have found in my Heart to have given a good wherrit i'th' Chops, so I cou'd—so I went to one Chockling-House, and Squire was not there, and so I went to t'other Chockling-House, and t'other, 'till I was a weary, and I cou'd see nothing but a many People supping hot Suppings, and reading your Gazate Papers so we came away here and please you, but we had much ado to find out your Worship's House, the vixen Boys set us a thick a side, and a thack a side, that we were almost lost—an it were not for an honest Fellow that came and show∣ed us the right way.</P>
