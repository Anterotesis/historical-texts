<P>DURING a long and disgraceful reign of of twenty-eight years, Honorius, emperor of the West, was separated from the friendship <NOTE PLACE="marg">Last years and death of Hono∣rius, A. D. 423, Aug. 27.</NOTE> of his brother, and afterwards of his nephew, who reigned over the East; and Constantinople beheld, with apparent indifference and secret joy, the calamities of Rome. The strange adventures of Placidia <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Chap. xxxi.</NOTE> gradually renewed, and cemented, the alliance of the two empires. The daughter
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
of the great Theodosius had been the captive and the queen of the Goths: she lost an affec∣tionate husband; she was dragged in chains by his insulting assassin; she tasted the pleasure of revenge, and was exchanged, in the treaty of peace, for six hundred thousand measures of wheat. After her return from Spain to Italy, Placidia experienced a new persecution in the bosom of her family. She was averse to a mar∣riage, which had been stipulated without her consent; and the brave Constantius, as a noble reward for the tyrants whom he had vanquished, received, from the hand of Honorius himself, the struggling and reluctant hand of the widow of Adolphus. But her resistance ended with the ceremony of the nuptials; nor did Placidia refuse to become the mother of Honoria and Valentinian the third, or to assume and exercise an absolute dominion over the mind of her grateful husband. The generous soldier, whose time had hitherto been divided between social pleasure and military service, was taught new lessons of avarice and ambition: he extorted the title of Augustus; and the servant of Honorius was associated to the empire of the West. The death of Constantius, in the seventh month of his reign, instead of diminishing, seemed to increase, the power of Placidia; and the indecent familiarity <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is the expression of Olympiodorus (apud Photium, p. 197.); who means, perhaps, to describe the same caresses which Mahomet bestowed on his <HI>daughter</HI> Phatemah. Quando (says the prophet himself), quando subit mihi desiderium Paradisi, osculor cam, et ingero linguam meam in os ejus. But this sensual indulgence was justified by miracle and mystery; and the anecdote has been communicated to the public by the Reverend Fa∣ther Maracci, in his Version and Confutation of the Koran, tom. i. p. 32.</NOTE> of her
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
brother, which might be no more than the symp∣toms of a childish affection, were universally attributed to incestuous love. On a sudden, by some base intrigues of a steward and a nurse, this excessive fondness was converted into an irrecon∣cileable quarrel: the debates of the emperor and his sister were not long confined within the walls of the palace; and as the Gothic soldiers adhered to their queen, the city of Ravenna was agitated with bloody and dangerous tumults, which could only be appeased by the forced or voluntary re∣treat of Placidia and her children. The royal exiles landed at Constantinople, soon after the marriage of Theodosius, during the festival of the Persian victories. They were treated with kindness and magnificence; but as the statues of the emperor Constantius had been rejected by the Eastern court, the title of Augusta could not de∣cently be allowed to his widow. Within a few months after the arrival of Placidia, a swift mes∣senger announced the death of Honorius, the consequence of a dropsy; but the important secret was not divulged, till the necessary orders had been dispatched for the march of a large body of troops to the sea-coast of Dalmatia. The shops and the gates of Constantinople remained shut during seven days; and the loss of a foreign prince, who could neither be esteemed nor re∣gretted,
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
was celebrated with loud and affected demonstrations of the public grief.</P>
<P>While the ministers of Constantinople delibe∣rated, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Elevation and fall of the usurper John, A. D. 423—425.</NOTE> the vacant throne of Honorius was usurped by the ambition of a stranger. The name of the rebel was John: he filled the confidential office of <HI>Primicerius,</HI> or principal secretary; and history has attributed to his character more virtues, than can easily be reconciled with the violation of the most sacred duty. Elated by the submission of Italy, and the hope of an alliance with the Huns, John presumed to insult, by an embassy, the majesty of the Eastern emperor; but when he understood that his agents had been banished, imprisoned, and at length chaced away with de∣served ignominy, John prepared to assert, by arms, the injustice of his claims. In such a cause, the grandson of the great Theodosius should have marched in person: but the young emperor was easily diverted, by his physicians, from so rash and hazardous a design; and the conduct of the Italian expedition was prudently entrusted to Ardaburius, and his son Aspar, who had already signalised their valour against the Persians. It was resolved, that Ardaburius should embark with the infantry; whilst Aspar, at the head of the cavalry, conducted Placidia, and her son Valentinian, along the sea-coast of the Ha∣driatic. The march of the cavalry was perform∣ed with such active diligence, that they surprised, without resistance, the important city of Aquileia; when the hopes of Aspar were unexpectedly con∣founded
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
by the intelligence, that a storm had dispersed the Imperial fleet; and that his father, with only two gallies, was taken and carried a prisoner into the port of Ravenna. Yet this in∣cident, unfortunate as it might seem, facilitated the conquest of Italy. Ardaburius employed, or abused, the courteous freedom, which he was permitted to enjoy, to revive among the troops a sense of loyalty and gratitude; and, as soon as the conspiracy was ripe for execution, he invited by private messages, and pressed the approach of, Aspar. A shepherd, whom the popular credulity transformed into an angel, guided the Eastern cavalry, by a secret, and, it was thought, an im∣passable road, through the morasses of the Po: the gates of Ravenna, after a short struggle, were thrown open; and the defenceless tyrant was delivered to the mercy, or rather to the cruelty, of the conquerors. His right hand was first cut off; and, after he had been exposed, mounted on an ass, to the public derision, John was be∣headed in the Circus of Aquileia. The emperor Theodosius, when he received the news of the victory, interrupted the horse-races; and singing, as he marched through the streets, a suitable psalm, conducted his people from the Hippo∣drome to the church, where he spent the remain∣der of the day in grateful devotion <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">For these revolutions of the Western empire, consult Olympiodor. apud Phot. p. 192, 193. 196, 197. 200.

In a monarchy, which, according to various precedents, might be considered as elective, or hereditary, or patrimonial, it was impossible that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Valenti∣nian III. emperor of the West, A. D. 425-455.</NOTE> the intricate claims of female and collateral suc∣cession should be clearly defined <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">See Grotius de Jure Belli et Pacis, l. ii. c. 7. He has labori∣ously, but vainly, attempted to form a reasonable system of juris∣prudence, from the various and discordant modes of royal succession, which have been introduced by fraud, or force, by time, or acci∣dent.</NOTE>; and Theo∣dosius, by the right of consanguinity or con∣quest, might have reigned the sole legitimate emperor of the Romans. For a moment, per∣haps, his eyes were dazzled by the prospect of unbounded sway; but his indolent temper gra∣dually acquiesced in the dictates of sound policy. He contented himself with the possession of the East; and wisely relinquished the laborious task, of waging a distant and doubtful war against the Barbarians beyond the Alps; or of securing the obedience of the Italians and Africans, whose minds were alienated by the irreconcileable dif∣ference of language and interest.

Their union might have supported a sinking empire; their discord was the fatal and immediate cause of the loss of Africa. The in∣vasion and defeat of Attila has immortalized the fame of Aetius; and though time has thrown a shade over the exploits of his rival, the defence of Marscelles, and the deliverance of Africa, attest the military talents of count Boniface. In the field of battle, in partial encounters, in sin∣gle combats, he was still the terror of the Bar∣barians: the clergy, and particularly his friend Augustin, were edified by the Christian piety, which had once tempted him to retire from the world; the people applauded his spotless integrity; the army dreaded his equal and inexorable justice, which may be displayed in a very singular exam∣ple. A peasant, who complained of the criminal intimacy between his wife and a Gothic soldier, was directed to attend his tribunal the following day: in the evening the count, who had dili∣gently
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
informed himself of the time and place of the assignation, mounted his horse, rode ten miles into the country, surprised the guilty couple, punished the soldier with instant death, and si∣lenced the complaints of the husband, by pre∣senting him, the next morning, with the head of the adulterer. The abilities of Aetius and Boni∣face might have been usefully employed against the public enemies, in separate and important commands; but the experience of their past con∣duct should have decided the real favour and con∣fidence of the empress Placidia. In the melan∣choly season of her exile and distress, Boniface alone had maintained her cause with unshaken fidelity; and the troops and treasures of Africa had essentially contributed to extinguish the rebellion. The same rebellion had been sup∣ported by the zeal and activity of Aetius, who brought an army of sixty thousand Huns from the Danube to the confines of Italy, for the service of the usurper. The untimely death of John, compelled him to accept an advantageous treaty; but he still continued, the subject and the soldier of Valentinian, to entertain a secret, perhaps a treasonable, correspondence with his Barbarian allies, whose retreat had been purchased by liberal gifts, and more liberal promises. But Aetius possessed an advantage of singular moment in a female reign: he was present: he besieged, with artful and assiduous flattery, the palace of Ravenna; disguised his dark designs with the mask of loyalty and friendship; and at length
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
deceived both his mistress and his absent rival, by a subtle conspiracy, which a weak woman, and a brave man, could not easily suspect.

A temperate enquiry into the real motives of Boniface, would have restored a faith∣ful servant to his duty and to the republic; but the arts of Aetius still continued to betray and to inflame, and the count was urged, by per∣secution, to embrace the most desperate counsels. The success with which he eluded or repelled the first attacks, could not inspire a vain confidence, that, at the head of some loose, disorderly Afri∣cans, he should be able to withstand the regular forces of the West, commanded by a rival, whose military character it was impossible for him to despise. After some hesitation, the last struggles of prudence and loyalty, Boniface dispatched a trusty friend to the court, or rather to the camp, of Gonderic, king of the Vandals, with the pro∣posal

The Vandals prevailed; and their adversaries were besieged in the Nervasian hills, between Leon and Oviedo, till the approach of Count Asterius compelled, or rather provoked, the victorious Barbarians to remove the scene of the war to the plains of Boetica. The rapid progress of the Vandals soon required a more effectual opposition; and the master-general Castinus marched against them with a numerous army of Romans and Goths. Vanquished in battle by an inferior enemy, Castinus fled with dishonour to Tarragona; and this memorable defeat, which has been represented as the punishment, was most probably the effect, of his rash presumption <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">See the Chronicles of Prosper and Idatius.

The

The king of the Vandals is described to have been of a middle stature, with a lameness in one leg, which he had contracted by an accidental fall from his horse. His slow and cautious speech seldom declared the deep purposes of his soul: he disdained to imitate the luxury of the vanquished; but he indulged the sterner passions of anger and revenge. The am∣bition of Genseric was without bounds, and with∣out scruples; and the warrior could dexterously employ the dark engines of policy of solicit the allies who might be useful to his success, or to scatter among his enemies the seeds of hatred and contention. Almost in the moment of his depar∣ture he was informed, that Hermanric, king of the Suevi, had presumed to ravage the Spanish

territories, which he was resolved to abandon. Impatient of the insult, Genseric pursued the hasty retreat of the Suevi as far as Merida; precipitated the king and his army into the river Anas, and calmly returned to the sea-shore, to embark his victorious troops. The vessels which transported the Vandals over the modern Streights <NOTE PLACE="marg">He lands in Africa, A. D. 429.

by the same means which had occasioned their ruin.

His repentance was fervent and sincere; but he soon discovered, that it was no longer in his power to restore the edifice which he had shaken to its foundations. Carthage, and the Roman garrisons, returned with their general to the allegiance of Valentinian; but the rest of Africa was still distracted with war and faction; and the inexorable king of the Vandals, disdain∣ing all terms of accommodation, sternly refused to relinquish the possession of his prey. The band of veterans, who marched under the stand∣ard

<P>The long and narrow tract of the African coast <NOTE PLACE="marg">Desolation of Africa.</NOTE> was filled with frequent monuments of Roman art and magnificence; and the respective degrees of improvement might be accurately measured by the distance from Carthage and the Mediter∣ranean. A simple reflection will impress every thinking mind with the clearest idea of fertility and cultivation: the country was extremely po∣pulous; the inhabitants reserved a liberal sub∣sistence for their own use; and the annual ex∣portation, particularly of wheat, was so regular and plentiful, that Africa deserved the name of the common granary of Rome and of mankind. On a sudden, the seven fruitful provinces, from Tangier to Tripoli, were overwhelmed by the invasion of the Vandals; whose destructive rage has perhaps been exaggerated by popular ani∣mosity, religious zeal, and extravagant declama∣tion. War, in its fairest form, implies a per∣petual violation of humanity and justice; and the hostilities of Barbarians are inflamed by the fierce and lawless spirit which incessantly disturbs their peaceful and domestic society. The Vandals, where they found resistance, seldom gave quarter; and the deaths of their valiant countrymen were expiated by the ruin of the cities under whose walls they had fallen. Careless of the distinctions

of age, or sex, or rank, they employed every spe∣cies of indignity and torture, to force from the captives a discovery of their hidden wealth. The stern policy of Genseric justified his frequent ex∣amples of military execution: he was not always the master of his own passions, or of those of his followers; and the calamities of war were aggra∣vated by the licentiousness of the Moors, and the fanaticism of the Donatists. Yet I shall not easily be persuaded, that it was the common prac∣tice of the Vandals to extirpate the olives, and other fruit-trees, of a country where they intend∣ed to settle: nor can I believe that it was a usual stratagem to slaughter great numbers of their prisoners before the walls of a besieged city, for the sole purpose of infecting the air, and pro∣ducing a pestilence, of which they themselves must have been the first victims <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">The original complaints of the desolation of Africa are con∣tained, 1.

<P>By the skill of Boniface, and perhaps by the ignorance of the Vandals, the siege of Hippo <NOTE PLACE="marg">Death and retreat of Boniface, A.

The im∣portance and danger of Africa were deeply felt by the regent of the West. Placidia implored the assistance of her eastern ally; and the Italian fleet and army were reinforced by Aspar, who failed from Constantinople with a powerful arma∣ment. As soon as the force of the two empires was united under the command of Boniface, he boldly marched against the Vandals; and the loss of a second battle irretrievably decided the fate of Africa. He embarked with the precipi∣tation of despair; and the people of Hippo were permitted, with their families and effects, to occupy the vacant place of the soldiers, the great∣est part of whom were either slain or made pri∣soners by the Vandals. The Count, whose fatal

credulity had wounded the vitals of the republic, might enter the palace of Ravenna with some anxiety, which was soon removed by the smiles of Placidia. Boniface accepted with gratitude the rank of patrician, and the dignity of master∣general of the Roman armies; but he must have blushed at the sight of those medals, in which he was represented with the name and attributes of victory <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot">Ducange, Fam.

The discovery of his fraud, the dis∣pleasure of the empress, and the distinguished favour of his rival, exasperated the haughty and perfidious soul of Aetius. He hastily returned from Gaul to Italy, with a retinue, or rather with an army, of Barbarian followers; and such was the weakness of the government, that the two generals decided their private quarrel in a bloody battle. Boniface was successful; but he <NOTE PLACE="marg">His death, A.

But Aetius could not derive any imme∣diate advantage from the generosity of his dying enemy: he was proclaimed a rebel by the justice of Placidia; and though he attempted to defend

Eight years however elapsed, from the evacua∣tion of Hippo to the reduction of Carthage. In the midst of that interval, the ambitious Gen∣seric, in the full tide of apparent prosperity, negociated a treaty of peace, by which he gave his son Hunneric for an hostage; and consented to leave the Western emperor in the undisturbed possession of the three Mauritanias <NOTE N="34" PLACE="foot">See Procopius, de Bell.

The buildings of Carthage were uniform and magnificent: a shady grove was planted in the midst of the capital; the <HI>new</HI> port, a secure and capacious harbour, was subservient to the com∣mercial industry of citizens and strangers; and the splendid games of the circus and theatre were exhibited almost in the presence of the Bar∣barians.

An edict was promulgated, which enjoined all persons, without fraud or de∣lay, to deliver their gold, silver, jewels, and valuable furniture or apparel, to the royal officers; and the attempt to secrete any part of their patri∣mony, was inexorably punished with death and torture, as an act of treason against the state.

The Syrian bishop deplores the mis∣fortunes of Caelestian, who, from the state of a noble and opulent senator of Carthage, was reduced, with his wife and family, and servants, to beg his bread in a foreign country; but he applauds the resignation of the Christian exile, and the philosophic temper, which, under the pressure of such calamities, could enjoy more real happiness, than was the ordinary lot of wealth and prosperity. The story of Maria, the daughter of the magnificent Eudaemon, is sin∣gular and interesting. In the sack of Car∣thage, she was purchased from the Vandals by some merchants of Syria, who afterwards sold her as a slave in their native country. A female attendant, transported in the same ship, and sold in the same family, still continued to respect a mistress whom fortune had reduced to the com∣mon level of servitude; and the daughter of Eu∣daemon received from her grateful affection the domestic services, which she had once required from her obedience. This remarkable behaviour divulged the real condition of Maria; who, in the absence of the bishop of Cyrrhus, was redeem∣ed from slavery by the generosity of some soldiers of the garrison. The liberality of Theodoret provided for her decent maintenance; and she passed ten months among the deaconesses of the church; till she was unexpectedly informed, that her father, who had escaped from the ruin of
<PB N="32" REF="41"/>
Carthage, exercised an honourable office in one of the Western provinces. Her filial impatience was seconded by the pious bishop: Theodoret, in a letter still extant, recommends Maria to the bishop of Aegae, a maritime city of Cilicia, which was frequented, during the annual fair, by the vessels of the West; most earnestly requesting, that his colleague would use the maiden with a tenderness suitable to her birth; and that he would entrust her to the care of such faithful merchants, as would esteem it a sufficient gain, if they restored a daughter, lost beyond all human hope, to the arms of her afflicted parent.</P>
<P>Among the insipid legends of ecclesiastical <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fable of the seven sleepers.</NOTE> history, I am tempted to distinguish the memo∣rable fable of the SEVEN SLEEPERS <NOTE N="43" PLACE="foot">The choice of fabulous circumstances is of small importance; yet I have confined myself to the narrative which was translated from the Syriac by the care of Gregory of Tours (de Gloriâ Martyrûm, l. i. c. 95. in Max.

Their Greek acts, which Photius had read, assign the date of the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Theo∣dosius, which may coincide either with A. D. 439, or 446. The period which had elapsed since the persecution of Decius is easily as∣certained; and nothing less than the ignorance of Mahomet, or the legendaries, could suppose an interval of three or four hundred years.</NOTE>. When the emperor Decius persecuted the Christians, seven noble youths of
<PB N="33" REF="42"/>
Ephesus concealed themselves in a spacious ca∣vern in the side of an adjacent mountain; where they were doomed to perish by the tyrant, who gave orders that the entrance should be firmly secured with a pile of huge stones. They imme∣diately fell into a deep slumber, which was mi∣raculously prolonged, without injuring the powers of life, during a period of one hundred and eighty-seven years. At the end of that time, the slaves of Adolius, to whom the inheritance of the mountain had descended, removed the stones, to supply materials for some rustic edifice: the light of the sun darted into the cavern; and the seven sleepers were permitted to awake. After a slumber, as they thought, of a few hours, they were pressed by the calls of hunger; and resolved that Jamblichus, one of their number, should secretly return to the city, to purchase bread for the use of his companions. The youth (if we may still employ that appellation) could no longer recognise the once familiar aspect of his native country; and his surprise was increased by the appearance of a large cross, triumphantly erected over the principal gate of Ephesus. His singular dress, and obsolete language, confounded the baker, to whom he offered an ancient medal of Decius as the current coin of the empire; and Jamblichus, on the suspicion of a secret trea∣sure, was dragged before the judge. Their mu∣tual enquiries produced the amazing discovery, that two centuries were almost elapsed since Jam∣blichus, and his friends, had escaped from the rage of a Pagan tyrant. The bishop of Ephe∣sus,

the clergy, the magistrates, the people, and as it is said the emperor Theodosius himself, has∣tened to visit the cavern of the Seven Sleepers; who bestowed their benediction, related their story, and at the same instant peaceably expired. The origin of this marvellous fable cannot be ascribed to the pious fraud and credulity of the <HI>modern</HI> Greeks, since the authentic tradition may be traced within half a century of the supposed miracle. James of Sarug, a Syrian bishop, who was born only two years after the death of the younger Theodosius, has devoted one of his two hundred and thirty homilies to the praise of the young men of Ephesus <NOTE N="45" PLACE="foot">James, one of the orthodox fathers of the Syrian church, was born A.

(Assemanni, tom. i. p. 288, 289.).

The throne of the persecuting Decius was filled by a succession of Christian and orthodox princes, who had extirpated the fabulous gods of antiquity: and the public devotion of the age was impatient to exalt the saints and martyrs of the Catholic church, on the altars of Diana and Hercules. The union of the Roman empire was dissolved: its genius was humbled in the dust; and armies of unknown Barbarians, issuing from the frozen regions of the North, had established their vic∣torious reign over the fairest provinces of Europe and Africa.</P>

<P>THE western world was oppressed by the Goths and Vandals, who fled before the Huns; but the atchievements of the Huns them∣selves <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Huns, A. D. 376—433.</NOTE> were not adequate to their power and pro∣sperity. Their victorious hords had spread from the Volga to the Danube; but the public force was exhausted by the discord of independent chief∣tains; their valour was idly consumed in obscure and predatory excursions; and they often de∣graded their national dignity by condescending, for the hopes of spoil, to enlist under the ban∣ners of their fugitive enemies. In the reign of ATTILA <NOTE N="1" PLACE="marg">The authentic materials for the history of Attila may be found in Jornandes (de Rebus Geticis, c. 34—50. p. 660—688. edit.

I have not seen the lives of Attila, composed by Juvencus Caelius Calanus Dalmatinus, in the twelfth century, or by Nicholas Olahus, archbishop of Gran, in the sixteenth. See Mascou's History of the Germans, ix. 23. and Maffei Osservazioni Litteraric, tom. i. p. 88, 89.

the world; and I shall now describe the character and actions of that formidable Barbarian; who alternately insulted and invaded the East and the West, and urged the rapid downfal of the Ro∣man empire.</P>
<P>In the tide of emigration, which impetuously <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their esta∣blishment in modern Hungary.</NOTE> rolled from the confines of China to those of Germany, the most powerful and populous tribes may commonly be found on the verge of the Roman provinces. The accumulated weight was sustained for a while by artificial barriers; and the easy condescension of the emperors invited, without satisfying, the insolent demands of the Barbarians, who had acquired an eager appetite for the luxuries of civilized life. The Hunga∣rians, who ambitiously insert the name of Attila among their native kings, may affirm with truth, that the hords, which were subject to his uncle Roas, or Rugilas, had formed their encampments within the limits of modern Hungary <NOTE N="2" PLACE="marg">Hungary has been successively occupied by three Scythian colo∣nies. 1. The Huns of Attila; 2. the Abares, in the sixth century; and, 3. the Turks, or Magiars, A.

The <HI>Prodromus</HI> and <HI>Notitia</HI> of Matthew Belius, appear to contain a rich fund of informa∣tion concerning ancient and modern Hungary.

In this advantageous situation, Rugilas, and his valiant brothers, who continually added to their power and reputation, commanded the alternative of
<PB N="39" REF="48"/>
peace or war with the two empires. His alliance with the Romans of the West was cemented by his personal friendship for the great Aetius; who was always secure of finding, in the Barbarian camp, a hospitable reception, and a powerful support. At his solicitation, and in the name of John the usurper, sixty thousand Huns advanced to the confines of Italy; their march and their retreat were alike expensive to the state; and the grateful policy of Aetius abandoned the posses∣sion of Pannonia to his faithful confederates. The Romans of the East were not less apprehen∣sive of the arms of Rugilas, which threatened the provinces, or even the capital. Some eccle∣siastical historians have destroyed the Barbarians with lightning and pestilence <NOTE N="3" PLACE="marg">Socrates, l. vii. c. 43. Theodoret, l. v. c. 36.

The public tranquillity was frequently interrupted by the fierce impatience of the Bar∣barians, and the perfidious intrigues of the By∣zantine court. Four dependent nations, among whom we may distinguish the Bavarians, dis∣claimed the sovereignty of the Huns; and their revolt was encouraged and protected by a Roman alliance; till the just claims, and formidable

power, of Rugilas, were effectually urged by the voice of Eslaw his ambassador. Peace was the unanimous wish of the senate: their decree was ratified by the emperor; and two ambassadors were named, Plinthas, a general of Scythian extraction, but of consular rank; and the quae∣stor Epigenes, a wise and experienced statesman, who was recommended to that office by his am∣bitious colleague.</P>
<P>The death of Rugilas suspended the progress <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reign of Attila, A. D. 433—453.</NOTE> of the treaty. His two nephews, Attila and Bleda, who succeeded to the throne of their un∣cle, consented to a personal interview with the ambassadors of Constantinople; but as they proudly refused to dismount, the business was transacted on horseback, in a spacious plain near the city of Margus, in the Upper Maesia. The kings of the Huns assumed the solid benefits, as well as the vain honours, of the negociation. They dictated the conditions of peace, and each condition was an insult on the majesty of the em∣pire. Besides the freedom of a safe and plentiful market on the banks of the Danube, they re∣quired that the annual contribution should be augmented from three hundred and fifty, to seven hundred, pounds of gold; that a fine, or ransom, of eight pieces of gold, should be paid for every Roman captive, who had escaped from his Bar∣barian master; that the emperor should renounce all treaties and engagements with the enemies of the Huns; and that all the fugitives, who had taken refuge in the court, or provinces, of Theo∣dofius,
<PB N="41" REF="50"/>
should be delivered to the justice of their offended sovereign. This justice was rigorously in∣flicted on some unfortunate youths of a royal race. They were crucified on the territories of the em∣pire, by the command of Attila: and, as soon as the king of the Huns had impressed the Ro∣mans with the terror of his name, he indulged them in a short and arbitrary respite, whilst he subdued the rebellious or independent nations of Scythia and Germany <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">See Priscus, p. 47, 48. and Hist. des Peuples de l'Europe, tom. vii. c. xii, xiii, xiv, xv.</NOTE>.</P>

fiercely rolling his eyes, as if he wished to enjoy the terror which he inspired. Yet this savage hero was not inaccessible to pity: his suppliant enemies might confide in the assurance of peace or pardon; and Attila was considered by his sub∣jects as a just and indulgent master. He delight∣ed in war; but, after he had ascended the throne in a mature age, his head, rather than his hand, atchieved the conquest of the North; and the fame of an adventurous soldier was usefully exchanged for that of a prudent and successful general. The effects of personal valour are so incosiderable, except in poetry or romance, that victory, even among Barbarians, must depend on the degree of skill, with which the passions of the multitude are combined and guided for the service of a single man. The Scythian con∣querors, Attila and Zingis, surpassed their rude countrymen in art, rather than in courage; and it may be observed, that the monarchies, both of the Huns, and of the Moguls, were erected by their founders on the basis of popular supersti∣tion. The miraculous conception, which fraud and credulity ascribed to the virgin-mother of Zingis, raised him above the level of human nature; and the naked prophet, who, in the name of the Deity, invested him with the empire of the earth, pointed the valour of the Moguls with irresistible enthusiasm <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Abulpharag.

conquerors by the severity of the climate, and the courage of the natives. Towards the East, it is difficult to circumscribe the dominion of Attila over the Scythian deserts; yet we may be assur∣ed, that he reigned on the banks of the Volga; that the king of the Huns was dreaded, not only as a warrior, but as a magician <NOTE N="14" PLACE="foot">See Hist. des Huns, tom. ii. p. 296.

In the proud review of the nations who acknowledged the sovereignty of Attila, and who never entertained, during his lifetime, the thought of a revolt, the Gepidae and the Ostro∣goths were distinguished by their numbers, their bravery, and the personal merit of their chiefs. The renowned Ardaric, king of the Gepidae, was the faithful and sagacious counsellor of the mo∣narch; who esteemed his intrepid genius, whilst he loved the mild and discreet virtues of the no∣ble Walamir, king of the Ostrogoths. The crowd of vulgar kings, the leaders of so many martial tribes, who served under the standard of Attila, were ranged in the submissive order of guards and domestics, round the person of their master. They watched his nod; they trembled at his frown; and, at the first signal of his will,

they executed, without murmur or hesitation, his stern and absolute commands. In time of peace, the dependent princes, with their national troops, attended the royal camp in regular suc∣cession; but when Attila collected his military force, he was able to bring into the field an army of five, or, according to another account, of seven hundred thousand Barbarians <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">Jornandes, c. 35. p. 661. c. 37. p. 667.

They advanced, by a secret path, along the shores of the Caspian sea; traversed the snowy moun∣tains of Armenia; passed the Tigris, the Euphra∣tes, and the Halys; recruited their weary cavalry with the generous breed of Cappadocian horses; occupied the hilly country of Cilicia, and dis∣turbed the festal songs, and dances, of the citizens of Antioch. Egypt trembled at their approach; and the monks and pilgrims of the Holy Land prepared to escape their fury by a speedy embark∣ation. The memory of this invasion was still recent in the minds of the Orientals. The sub∣jects of Attila might execute, with superior forces, the design which these adventurers had so boldly attempted; and it soon became the subject of anxious conjecture, whether the tempest would fall on the dominions of Rome, or of Persia. Some of the great vassals of the king of the Huns, who were themselves in the rank of powerful princes, had been sent to ratify an alliance and society of arms with the emperor, or rather with the general, of the West. They related, during their residence at Rome, the circumstances of an expedition, which they had lately made into the East. After passing a desert and a morass, sup∣posed by the Romans to be the lake Moeotis, they penetrated through the mountains, and ar∣rived, at the end of fifteen days march, on the confines of Media; where they advanced as far as the unknown cities of Basic and Cursic. They encountered the Persian army in the plains of Media; and the air, according to their own ex∣pression,
<PB N="49" REF="58"/>
was darkened by a cloud of arrows. But the Huns were obliged to retire, before the num∣bers of the enemy. Their laborious retreat was effected by a different road; they lost the great∣est part of their booty; and at length returned to the royal camp, with some knowledge of the country, and an impatient desire of revenge. In the free conversation of the Imperial ambas∣sadors, who discussed, at the court of Attila, the character and designs of their formidable enemy, the ministers of Constantinople expressed their hope, that his strength might be diverted and employed in a long and doubtful contest with the princes of the house of Sassan. The more saga∣cious Italians admonished their Eastern brethren of the folly and danger of such a hope; and convinced them, <HI>that</HI> the Medes and Persians were incapable of resisting the arms of the Huns; and, <HI>that</HI> the easy and important acquisition would exalt the pride, as well as power, of the con∣queror. Instead of contenting himself with a moderate contribution, and a military title, which equalled him only to the generals of Theodosius, Attila would proceed to impose a disgraceful and intolerable yoke on the necks of the prostrate and captive Romans, who would then be en∣compassed, on all sides, by the empire of the Huns <NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">See the original conversation in Priscus, p. 64, 65.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>While the powers of Europe and Asia were <NOTE PLACE="marg">They at∣tack the Eastern empire, A. D. 441, &amp;c.</NOTE> solicitous to avert the impending danger, the alliance of Attila maintained the Vandals in the

possession of Africa. An enterprise had been concerted between the courts of Ravenna and Constantinople, for the recovery of that valuable province; and the ports of Sicily were already filled with the military and naval forces of Theo∣dosius. But the subtle Genseric, who spread his negociations round the world, prevented their designs, by exciting the king of the Huns to invade the Eastern empire; and a trifling inci∣dent soon became the motive, or pretence, of a destructive war <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">Priscus, p. 331. His history contained a copious and elegant account of the war (Evagrius, l. i. c. 17.); but the extracts which relate to the embassies are the only parts that have reached our times. The original work was accessible, however, to the writers, from whom we borrow our imperfect knowledge, Jornandes, Theophanes, Count Marcellinus, Prosper-Tyro, and the author of the Alexan∣drian, or Paschal, Chronicle. M. de Buat (Hist. des Peuples de l'Europe, tom. vii. c. xv.) has examined the cause, the circum∣stances, and the duration, of this war; and will not allow it to extend beyond the year four hundred and forty-four.</NOTE>. Under the faith of the treaty of Margus, a free market was held on the north∣ern side of the Danube, which was protected by a Roman fortress, surnamed Constantia. A troop of Barbarians violated the commercial se∣curity: killed, or dispersed, the unsuspecting traders; and levelled the fortress with the ground. The Huns justified this outrage as an act of re∣prisal; alleged, that the bishop of Margus had entered their territories, to discover and steal a secret treasure of their kings; and sternly de∣manded the guilty prelate, the sacrilegious spoil, and the fugitive subjects, who had escaped from the justice of Attila. The refusal of the Byzan∣tine
<PB N="51" REF="60"/>
court was the signal of war; and the Mae∣sians at first applauded the generous firmness of their sovereign. But they were soon intimidated by the destruction of Viminiacum and the adja∣cent towns; and the people was persuaded to adopt the convenient maxim, that a private citi∣zen, however innocent or respectable, may be justly sacrificed to the safety of his country. The bishop of Margus, who did not possess the spirit of a martyr, resolved to prevent the designs which he suspected. He boldly treated with the princes of the Huns; secured, by solemn oaths, his par∣don and reward; posted a numerous detachment of Barbarians, in silent ambush, on the banks of the Danube; and, at the appointed hour, opened, with his own hand, the gates of his episcopal city. This advantage, which had been obtained by treachery, served as a prelude to more ho∣nourable and decisive victories. The Illyrian frontier was covered by a line of castles and for∣tresses; and though the greatest part of them consisted only of a single tower, with a small gar∣rison, they were commonly sufficient to repel, or to intercept, the inroads of an enemy, who was ignorant of the art, and impatient of the delay, of a regular siege. But these slight obstacles were instantly swept away by the inundation of the Huns <NOTE N="19" PLACE="foot">Procopius, de Edificiis, l. iv. c. 5. These fortresses were afterwards restored, strengthened, and enlarged by the emperor Jus∣tinian; but they were soon destroyed by the Abares, who succeeded to the power and possessions of the Huns.</NOTE>. They destroyed, with fire and sword, the populous cities of Sirmium and Singi∣dunum,

of Ratiaria and Marcianapolis, of Na∣issus and Sardica; where every circumstance, in the discipline of the people, and the construction of the buildings, had been gradually adapted to the sole purpose of defence. The whole breadth <NOTE PLACE="marg">and ra∣vage Eu∣rope as far as Con∣stantinople.</NOTE> of Europe, as it extends above five hundred miles from the Euxine to the Hadriatic, was at once invaded, and occupied, and desolated, by the myriads of Barbarians whom Attila led into the field. The public danger and distress could not, however, provoke Theodosius to interrupt his amusements and devotion, or to appear in person at the head of the Roman legions. But the troops, which had been sent against Genseric, were hastily recalled from Sicily; the garrisons, on the side of Persia, were exhausted; and a military force was collected in Europe, formid∣able by their arms and numbers, if the generals had understood the science of command, and their soldiers the duty of obedience. The ar∣mies of the Eastern empire were vanquished in three successive engagements; and the progress of Attila may be traced by the fields of battle. The two former, on the banks of the Utus, and under the walls of Marcianapolis, were fought in the extensive plains between the Danube and Mount Haemus. As the Romans were pressed by a victorious enemy, they gradually, and un∣skilfully, retired towards the Chersonesus of Thrace; and that narrow peninsula, the last ex∣tremity of the land, was marked by their third, and irreparable, defeat. By the destruction of
<PB N="53" REF="62"/>
this army, Attila acquired the indisputable pos∣session of the field. From the Hellespont to Thermopylae, and the suburbs of Constantinople, he ravaged, without resistance, and without mercy, the provinces of Thrace and Macedonia. Heraclea and Hadrianople might, perhaps, es∣cape this dreadful irruption of the Huns; but the words, the most expressive of total extirpa∣tion and erasure, are applied to the calamities which they inflicted on seventy cities of the Eas∣tern empire <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">Septuaginta civitates (says Prosper-Tyro) depraedatione vasta∣tae.

Theodosius, his court, and the unwarlike people, were protected by the walls of Constantinople; but those walls had been shaken by a recent earthquake, and the fall of fifty-eight towers had opened a large and tremendous breach.

of national rapine and murder, are founded on two principles of substantial interest: the knowledge of the permanent benefits which may be obtained by a moderate use of conquest; and a just apprehension, lest the desolation which we inflict on the enemy's country, may be retaliated on our own. But these considerations of hope and fear are almost unknown in the pastoral state of nations. The Huns of Attila may, without injustice, be compared to the Moguls and Tar∣tars, before their primitive manners were changed by religion and luxury; and the evidence of Oriental history may reflect some light on the short and imperfect annals of Rome. After the Moguls had subdued the northern provinces of China, it was seriously proposed, not in the hour of victory and passion, but in calm deliberate council, to exterminate all the inhabitants of that populous country, that the vacant land might be converted to the pasture of cattle. The firmness of a Chinese mandarin <NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot">He represented, to the emperor of the Moguls, that the four provinces (Petcheli, Chantong, Chansi, and Leaotong) which he already possessed, might annually produce, under a mild administra∣tion, 500,000 ounces of silver, 400,000 measures of rice, and 800,000 pieces of silk.

But in the cities of Asia, which yielded to the Moguls, the inhuman abuse of the rights of war was exercised, with a regular
<PB N="55" REF="64"/>
form of discipline, which may, with equal reason, though not with equal authority, be imputed to the victorious Huns. The inhabitants, who had submitted to their discretion, were ordered to evacuate their houses, and to assemble in some plain adjacent to the city; where a division was made of the vanquished into three parts. The first class consisted of the soldiers of the garrison, and of the young men capable of bearing arms; and their fate was instantly decided: they were either inlisted among the Moguls, or they were massacred on the spot by the troops, who, with pointed spears and bended bows, had formed a circle round the captive multitude. The second class, composed of the young and beautiful wo∣men, of the artificers of every rank and profes∣sion, and of the more wealthy or honourable citizens, from whom a private ransom might be expected, was distributed in equal or proportion∣able lots. The remainder, whose life or death was alike useless to the conquerors, were per∣mitted to return to the city; which, in the mean while, had been stripped of its valuable furniture; and a tax was imposed on those wretched inha∣bitants for the indulgence of breathing their na∣tive air. Such was the behaviour of the Moguls, when they were not conscious of any extraordinary rigour <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">Particular instances would be endless; but the curious reader may consult the life of Gengiscan, by Petit de la Croix, the Histoire des Mongous, and the fifteenth book of the History of the Huns.</NOTE>.

It may be affirmed, with bolder assurance, that the Huns depopulated the provinces of the em∣pire, by the number of Roman subjects whom <NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the cap∣tives.</NOTE> they led away into captivity. In the hands of a wise legislator, such an industrious colony might have contributed to diffuse, through the deserts of Scythia, the rudiments of the useful and or∣namental arts; but these captives, who had been taken in war, were accidentally dispersed among the hords, that obeyed the empire, of Attila. The estimate of their respective value was form∣ed by the simple judgment of unenlightened, and unprejudiced, Barbarians. Perhaps they might not understand the merit of a theologian, profoundly skilled in the controversies of the Trinity and the Incarnation: yet they respected the ministers of every religion; and the active zeal of the Christian missionaries, without ap∣proaching the person, or the palace, of the mo∣narch, successfully laboured in the propagation of the gospel <NOTE N="27" PLACE="foot">The missionaries of St. Chrysostom had converted great numbers of the Scythians, who dwelt beyond the Danube, in tents and wag∣gons.

The historian Priscus, whose embassy is a source of curious instruction, was accosted, in the camp of Attila, by a stranger, who saluted him in the Greek language, but whose dress and figure displayed the appearance of a wealthy Scythian. In the siege of Viminia∣cum, he had lost, according to his own account, his fortune and liberty: he became the slave of Onegesius; but his faithful services, against the Romans and the Acatzires, had gradually raised him to the rank of the native Huns; to whom he was attached by the domestic pledges of a new wife and several children. The spoils of war had restored and improved his private property; he was admitted to the table of his former lord; and the apostate Greek blessed the hour of his captivity, since it had been the introduction to
<PB N="60" REF="69"/>
an happy and independent state; which he held by the honourable tenure of military service. This reflection naturally produced a dispute on the advantages, and defects, of the Roman go∣vernment, which was severely arraigned by the apostate, and defended by Priscus in a prolix and feeble declamation. The freedman of Onegesius exposed, in true and lively colours, the vices of a declining empire, of which he had so long been the victim; the cruel absurdity of the Roman princes, unable to protect their subjects against the public enemy, unwilling to trust them with arms for their own defence; the intolerable weight of taxes, rendered still more oppressive by the intricate or arbitrary modes of collection; the obscurity of numerous and contradictory laws; the tedious and expensive forms of judicial pro∣ceedings; the partial administration of justice; and the universal corruption, which increased the influence of the rich, and aggravated the mis∣fortunes of the poor.

discipline, or virtue, were not supplied by the personal character of the monarch. Theodosius might still affect the style, as well as the title, of <HI>Invincible Augustus;</HI> but he was reduced to solicit the clemency of Attila, who imperiously dictated these harsh and humiliating conditions of peace. I. The emperor of the East resigned, by an ex∣press or tacit convention, an extensive and im∣portant territory, which stretched along the southern banks of the Danube, from Singidunum or Belgrade, as far as Novae, in the diocese of Thrace. The breadth was defined by the vague computation of fifteen days journey; but, from the proposal of Attila, to remove the situation of the national market, it soon appeared, that he comprehended the ruined city of Naissus within the limits of his dominions. II. The king of the Huns required, and obtained, that his tribute or subsidy should be augmented from seven hundred pounds of gold to the annual sum of two thou∣sand one hundred; and he stipulated the imme∣diate payment of six thousand pounds of gold to defray the expences, or to expiate the guilt, of the war. One might imagine, that such a de∣mand, which scarcely equalled the measure of private wealth, would have been readily discharg∣ed by the opulent empire of the East; and the public distress affords a remarkable proof of the impoverished, or at least of the disorderly, state of the finances. A large proportion of the taxes, extorted from the people, was detained and in∣tercepted in their passage, through the foulest
<PB N="62" REF="71"/>
channels, to the treasury of Constantinople. The revenue was dissipated by Theodosius, and his favourites, in wasteful and profuse luxury; which was disguised by the names of Imperial magni∣ficence, or Christian charity. The immediate supplies had been exhausted by the unforeseen necessity of military preparations. A personal contribution, rigorously, but capriciously, im∣posed on the members of the senatorian order, was the only expedient that could disarm, with∣out loss of time, the impatient avarice of At∣tila: and the poverty of the nobles compelled them to adopt the scandalous resource of exposing to public auction the jewels of their wives, and the hereditary ornaments of their palaces <NOTE N="34" PLACE="foot">According to the description, or rather invective, of Chrysos∣tom, an auction of Byzantine luxury must have been very produc∣tive.

III. The king of the Huns appears to have esta∣blished, as a principle of national jurisprudence, that he could never lose the property, which he had once acquired, in the persons, who had yielded either a voluntary, or reluctant, submis∣sion to his authority. From this principle he concluded, and the conclusions of Attila were irrevocable laws, that the Huns, who had been taken prisoners in war, should be released with∣out delay, and without ransom; that every Ro∣man captive, who had presumed to escape, should purchase his right to freedom at the price of twelve pieces of gold; and that all the Barba∣rians,
<PB N="63" REF="72" MS="y"/>
who had deserted the standard of Attila, should be restored, without any promise, or sti∣pulation, of pardon. In the execution of this cruel and ignominious treaty, the Imperial offi∣cers were forced to massacre several loyal and noble deserters, who refused to devote themselves to certain death; and the Romans forfeited all reasonable claims to the friendship of any Scy∣thian people, by this public confession, that they were destitute either of faith, or power, to protect the suppliants, who had embraced the throne of Theodosius <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">The articles of the treaty, expressed without much order or precision, may be found in Priscus (p. 34, 35, 36, 37. 53, &amp;c.).

Instead of tamely ex∣pecting

their approach, the Azimuntines attack∣ed, in frequent and successful sallies, the troops of the Huns, who gradually declined the danger∣ous neighbourhood; rescued from their hands the spoil and the captives, and recruited their domes∣tic force by the voluntary association of fugitives and deserters. After the conclusion of the treaty, Attila still menaced the empire with implacable war, unless the Azimuntines were persuaded, or compelled, to comply with the conditions which their sovereign had accepted. The ministers of Theodosius confessed with shame, and with truth, that they no longer possessed any authority over a society of men, who so bravely asserted their na∣tural independence; and the king of the Huns condescended to negociate an equal exchange with the citizens of Azimus. They demanded the restitution of some shepherds, who, with their cattle, had been accidentally surprised. A strict, though fruitless inquiry, was allowed: but the Huns were obliged to swear, that they did not detain any prisoners belonging to the city, before they could recover two surviving countrymen, whom the Azimuntines had reserved as pledges for the safety of their lost companions. Attila, on his side, was satisfied, and deceived, by their solemn asseveration, that the rest of the captives had been put to the sword; and that it was their constant practice, immediately to dismiss the Romans and the deserters, who had obtained the security of the public faith. This prudent and officious dissimulation may be condemned, or excused, by the casuists, as they incline to the

rigid decree of St. Augustin, or to the milder sentiment of St. Jerom and St. Chrysostom: but every soldier, every statesman, must acknowledge, that, if the race of the Azimuntines had been encouraged and multiplied, the Barbarians would have ceased to trample on the majesty of the empire <NOTE N="37" PLACE="foot">The peevish dispute of St. Jerom and St. Augustin, who la∣boured; by different expedients, to reconcile the <HI>seeming</HI> quarrel of the two apostles St. Peter and St. Paul, depends on the solution of an important question (Middleton's Works, vol. ii. p. 5—10.), which has been frequently agitated by Catholic and Protestant divines, and even by lawyers and philosophers of every age.</NOTE>.</P>

Besides the motives of pride and interest, which might prompt the king of the Huns to continue this train of negociation, he
<PB N="66" REF="75"/>
was influenced by the less honourable view of enriching his favourites at the expence of his ene∣mies. The Imperial treasury was exhausted, to procure the friendly offices of the ambassadors, and their principal attendants, whose favourable report might conduce to the maintenance of peace. The Barbarian monarch was flattered by the liberal reception of his ministers; he com∣puted with pleasure the value and splendour of their gifts, rigorously exacted the performance of every promise, which would contribute to their private emolument, and treated as an important business of state, the marriage of his secretary Constantius <NOTE N="39" PLACE="foot">See Priscus, p. 69. 71, 72, &amp;c. I would fain believe, that this adventurer was afterwards crucified by the order of Attila, on a sus∣picion of treasonable practices: but Priscus (p. 57.) has too plainly distinguished <HI>two</HI> persons of the name of Constantius, who, from the similar events of their lives, might have been easily confounded.</NOTE>. That Gallic adventurer, who was recommended by Aetius to the king of the Huns, had engaged his service to the ministers of Con∣stantinople, for the stipulated reward of a wealthy and noble wife; and the daughter of count Sa∣turninus was chosen to discharge the obligations of her country. The reluctance of the victim, some domestic troubles, and the unjust confis∣cation of her fortune, cooled the ardour of her interested lover; but he still demanded, in the name of Attila, an equivalent alliance; and, after many ambiguous delays and excuses, the Byzan∣tine court was compelled to sacrifice to this inso∣lent stranger the widow of Armatius, whose birth, opulence, and beauty, placed her in the most
<PB N="67" REF="76"/>
illustrious rank of the Roman matrons. For these importunate and oppressive embassies, At∣tila claimed a suitable return: he weighed, with suspicious pride, the character and station of the Imperial envoys; but he condescended to pro∣mise, that he would advance as far as Sardica, to receive any ministers who had been invested with the consular dignity. The council of Theodosius eluded this proposal, by representing the desolate and ruined condition of Sardica; and even ven∣tured to insinuate, that every officer of the army or household was qualified to treat with the most powerful princes of Scythia. Maximin <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">In the Persian treaty concluded in the year 422, the wise and eloquent Maximin had been the assessor of Ardaburius (Socrates, l. vii. c. 20.).

embassy, a fatal and guilty secret, was entrusted only to the interpreter Vigilius. The two last ambassadors of the Huns, Orestes, a noble sub∣ject of the Pannonian province, and Edecon, a valiant chieftain of the tribe of the Scyrri, re∣turned at the same time from Constantinople to the royal camp. Their obscure names were after∣wards illustrated by the extraordinary fortune and the contrast of their sons: the two servants of Attila became the fathers of the last Roman em∣peror of the West, and of the first Barbarian king of Italy.</P>
<P>The ambassadors, who were followed by a nu∣merous <NOTE PLACE="marg">The em∣bassy of Maximin to Attila, A. D. 448.</NOTE> train of men and horses, made their first halt at Sardica, at the distance of three hundred and fifty miles, or thirteen days journey, from Constantinople. As the remains of Sardica were still included within the limits of the empire, it was incumbent on the Romans to exercise the duties of hospitality. They provided, with the assistance of the provincials, a sufficient number of sheep and oxen; and invited the Huns to a splendid, or at least, a plentiful, supper. But the harmony of the entertainment was soon disturbed by mutual prejudice and indiscretion. The great∣ness of the emperor and the empire was warmly maintained by their ministers; the Huns, with equal ardour, asserted the superiority of their victorious monarch: the dispute was inflamed by the rash and unseasonable flattery of Vigilius, who passionately rejected the comparison of a mere mortal with the divine Theodosius; and it was with extreme difficulty that Maximin and Priscus
<PB N="69" REF="78"/>
were able to divert the conversation, or to soothe the angry minds of the Barbarians. When they rose from table, the Imperial ambassador pre∣sented Edecon and Orestes with rich gifts of silk robes and Indian pearls, which they thankfully accepted. Yet Orestes could not forbear insi∣nuating, that <HI>he</HI> had not always been treated with such respect and liberality: and the offensive dis∣tinction, which was implied, between his civil office and the hereditary rank of his colleague, seems to have made Edecon a doubtful friend, and Orestes an irreconcileable enemy. After this entertainment, they travelled about one hundred miles from Sardica to Naissus. That flourishing city, which had given birth to the great Constan∣tine, was levelled with the ground: the inhabit∣ants were destroyed, or dispersed; and the ap∣pearance of some sick persons, who were still per∣mitted to exist among the ruins of the churches, served only to increase the horror of the prospect. The surface of the country was covered with the bones of the slain; and the ambassadors, who directed their course to the north-west, were obliged to pass the hills of modern Servia, be∣fore they descended into the flat and marshy grounds, which are terminated by the Danube. The Huns were masters of the great river: their navigation was performed in large canoes, hol∣lowed out of the trunk of a single tree; the mi∣nisters of Theodosius were safely landed on the opposite bank; and their Barbarian associates im∣mediately hastened to the camp of Attila, which was equally prepared for the amusements of
<PB N="70" REF="79"/>
hunting, or of war. No sooner had Maximin advanced about two miles from the Danube, than he began to experience the fastidious inso∣lence of the conqueror. He was sternly forbid to pitch his tents in a pleasant valley, lest he should infringe the distant awe that was due to the royal mansion. The ministers of Attila pressed him to communicate the business, and the instruc∣tions, which he reserved for the ear of their sove∣reign. When Maximin temperately urged the contrary practice of nations, he was still more confounded to find, that the resolutions of the Sacred Consistory, those secrets (says Priscus) which should not be revealed to the gods them∣selves, had been treacherously disclosed to the public enemy. On his refusal to comply with such ignominious terms, the Imperial envoy was commanded instantly to depart: the order was recalled; it was again repeated; and the Huns renewed their ineffectual attempts to subdue the patient firmness of Maximin. At length, by the intercession of Scotta, the brother of Onegesius, whose friendship had been purchased by a liberal gift, he was admitted to the royal presence; but, instead of obtaining a decisive answer, he was compelled to undertake a remote journey to∣wards the North, that Attila might enjoy the proud satisfaction of receiving, in the same camp, the ambassadors of the Eastern and Western em∣pires. His journey was regulated by the guides, who obliged him to halt, to hasten his march, or to deviate from the common road, as it best suit∣ed
<PB N="71" REF="80"/>
the convenience of the King. The Romans who traversed the plains of Hungary, suppose that they passed <HI>several</HI> navigable rivers, either in canoes or portable boats; but there is reason to suspect, that the winding stream of the Teyss, or Tibiscus, might present itself in different places, under different names. From the conti∣guous villages they received a plentiful and re∣gular supply of provisions; mead instead of wine, millet in the place of bread, and a certain liquor named <HI>camus,</HI> which, according to the report of Priscus, was distilled from barley <NOTE N="42" PLACE="foot">The Huns themselves still continued to despise the labours of agriculture: they abused the privilege of a victorious nation; and the Goths, their industrious subjects who cultivated the earth, dread∣ed their neighbourhood, like that of so many ravenous wolves (Pris∣cus, p. 45.). In the same manner the Sarts and Tadgies provide for their own subsistence, and for that of the Usbec Tartars, their lazy and rapacious sovereigns. See Genealogical History of the Tar∣tars, p. 423. 455, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Such fare might appear coarse and indelicate to men who had tasted the luxury of Constantinople: but, in their accidental distress, they were relieved by the gentleness and hospitality of the same Bar∣barians, so terrible and so merciless in war. The ambassadors had encamped on the edge of a large morass. A violent tempest of wind and rain, of thunder and lightning, overturned their tents, immersed their baggage and furniture in the water, and scattered their retinue, who wandered in the darkness of the night, uncertain of their road, and apprehensive of some unknown danger, till they awakened by their cries the inhabitants of a neighbouring village, the property of the
<PB N="72" REF="81"/>
widow of Bleda. A bright illumination, and, in a few moments, a comfortable fire of reeds, was kindled by their officious benevolence: the wants, and even the desires, of the Romans were libe∣rally satisfied; and they seem to have been em∣barrassed by the singular politeness of Bleda's widow, who added to her other favours the gift, or at least the loan, of a sufficient number of beautiful and obsequious damsels. The sunshine of the succeeding day was dedicated to repose; to collect and dry the baggage, and to the refresh∣ment of the men and horses: but, in the even∣ing, before they pursued their journey, the am∣bassadors expressed their gratitude to the bounte∣ous lady of the village, by a very acceptable pre∣sent of silver cups, red fleeces, dried fruits, and Indian pepper. Soon after this adventure, they rejoined the march of Attila, from whom they had been separated about six days; and slowly proceeded to the capital of an empire, which did not contain, in the space of several thousand miles, a single city.</P>
<P>As far as we may ascertain the vague and ob∣scure <NOTE PLACE="marg">The royal village and palace.</NOTE> geography of Priscus, this capital appears to have been seated between the Danube, the Teyss, and the Carpathian hills, in the plains of Upper Hungary, and most probably in the neigh∣bourhood of Jazberin, Agria, or Tokay <NOTE N="43" PLACE="foot">It is evident, that Priscus passed the Danube and the Teyss, and that he did not reach the foot of the Carpathian hills. Agria, Tokay, and Jazberin, are situated in the plains circumscribed by this definition. M. de Buat (Histoire des Peuples, &amp;c. tom. vii. p 461.) has chosen Tokay; Otrokosci (p. 180. apud Mascou, ix. 23.), a learned. Hungarian, has preferred Jazberin, a place about thirty-six miles westward of Buda and the Danube.</NOTE>. In
<PB N="73" REF="82"/>
its origin it could be no more than an accidental camp, which, by the long and frequent residence of Attila, had insensibly swelled into a huge vil∣lage, for the reception of his court, of the troops who followed his person, and of the various mul∣titude of idle or industrious slaves and retainers <NOTE N="44" PLACE="foot">The royal village of Attila may be compared to the city of Karacorum, the residence of the successors of Zingis; which, though it appears to have been a more stable habitation, did not equal the size or splendor of the town and abbey of St. Denys; in the 13th cen∣tury (see Rubruquis, in the Historie Generale des Voyages, tom. vii. p. 286.). The camp of Aurengzebe, as it is so agreeably described by Bernier (tom. ii. p. 217—235.), blended the manners of Scythia with the magnificence and luxury of Hindostan.</NOTE>. The baths, constructed by Onegesius, were the only edifice of stone; the materials had been transported from Pannonia; and since the adja∣cent country was destitute even of large timber, it may be presumed, that the meaner habitations of the royal village consisted of straw, of mud, or of canvas. The wooden houses of the more illustrious Huns, were built and adorned with rude magnificence, according to the rank, the fortune, or the taste of the proprietors. They seem to have been distributed with some degree of order and symmetry; and each spot became more honourable, as it approached the person of the sovereign. The palace of Attila, which sur∣passed all other houses in his dominions, was built entirely of wood, and covered an ample space of ground. The outward enclosure was a lofty wall, or pallisade, of smooth square timber, intersected with high towers, but intended rather for orna∣ment than defence. This wall, which seems to
<PB N="74" REF="83"/>
have encircled the declivity of a hill, compre∣hended a great variety of wooden edifices, adapt∣ed to the uses of royalty. A separate house was assigned to each of the numerous wives of Attila; and, instead of the rigid and illiberal confine∣ment imposed by Asiatic jealousy, they politely admitted the Roman ambassadors to their pre∣sence, their table, and even to the freedom of an innocent embrace. When Maximin offered his presents to Cerca, the principal queen, he ad∣mired the singular architecture of her mansion, the height of the round columns, the size and beauty of the wood, which was curiously shaped or turned, or polished, or carved; and his atten∣tive eye was able to discover some taste in the ornaments, and some regularity in the propor∣tions. After passing through the guards, who watched before the gate, the ambassadors were introduced into the private apartment of Cerca. The wife of Attila received their visit sitting, or rather lying, on a soft couch; the floor was co∣vered with a carpet; the domestics formed a cir∣cle round the queen; and her damsels, seated on the ground, were employed in working the varie∣gated embroidery which adorned the dress of the Barbaric warriors. The Huns were ambitious of displaying those riches which were the fruit and evidence of their victories: the trappings of their horses, their swords, and even their shoes, were studded with gold and precious stones; and their tables were profusely spread with plates, and gob∣lets, and vases of gold and silver, which had
<PB N="75" REF="84"/>
been fashioned by the labour of Grecian artists. The monarch alone assumed the superior pride of still adhering to the simplicity of his Scythian ancestors <NOTE N="45" PLACE="foot">When the Moguls displayed the spoils of Asia, in the diet of Toncat, the throne of Zingis was still covered with the original black felt carpet, on which he had been seated, when he was raised to the command of his warlike countrymen. See Vie de Gengiscan, l. iv. c. 9.</NOTE>. The dress of Attila, his arms, and the furniture of his horse, were plain, without ornament, and of a single colour. The royal table was served in wooden cups and platters; flesh was his only food; and the conqueror of the North never tasted the luxury of bread.</P>
<P>When Attila first gave audience to the Roman ambassadors on the banks of the Danube, his tent <NOTE PLACE="marg">The beha∣viour of Attila to the Roman ambassa∣dors.</NOTE> was encompassed with a formidable guard. The monarch himself was seated in a wooden chair. His stern countenance, angry gestures, and im∣patient tone, astonished the firmness of Maximin; but Vigilius had more reason to tremble, since he distinctly understood the menace, that if At∣tila did not respect the law of nations, he would nail the deceitful interpreter to a cross, and leave his body to the vultures. The Barbarian con∣descended, by producing an accurate list, to ex∣pose the bold falsehood of Vigilius, who had affirmed that no more than seventeen deserters could be found. But he arrogantly declared, that he apprehended only the disgrace of con∣tending with his fugitive slaves; since he despised their impotent efforts to defend the provinces which Theodofius had entrusted to their arms:
<PB N="76" REF="85"/>
<Q REND="inline">"For what fortress" (added Attila), "what city, in the wide extent of the Roman empire, can hope to exist, secure and impregnable, if it is our pleasure that it should be erazed from the earth?"</Q> He dismissed, however, the in∣terpreter, who returned to Constantinople with his peremptory demand of more complete resti∣tution, and a more splendid embassy. His an∣ger gradually subsided, and his domestic satis∣faction, in a marriage which he celebrated on the road with the daughter of Eslam, might perhaps contribute to mollify the native fierceness of his temper. The entrance of Attila into the royal village, was marked by a very singular ceremony. A numerous troop of women came out to meet their hero, and their king. They marched be∣fore him, distributed into long and regular files: the intervals between the files were filled by white veils of thin linen, which the women on either side bore aloft in their hands, and which formed a canopy for a chorus of young virgins, who chanted hymns and songs in the Scythian lan∣guage. The wife of his favourite Onegesius, with a train of female attendants, saluted Attila at the door of her own house, on his way to the palace; and offered, according to the custom of the country, her respectful homage, by intreating him to taste the wine and meat, which she had prepared for his reception. As soon as the mo∣narch had graciously accepted her hospitable gift, his domestics lifted a small silver table to a con∣venient height, as he sat on horseback; and At∣tila,
<PB N="77" REF="86"/>
when he had touched the goblet with his lips, again saluted the wife of Onegesius, and continued his march. During his residence at the seat of empire, his hours were not wasted in the recluse idleness of a seraglio; and the king of the Huns could maintain his superior dignity, without concealing his person from the public view. He frequently assembled his council, and gave audience to the ambassadors of the nations; and his people might appeal to the supreme tri∣bunal, which he held at stated times, and, ac∣cording to the eastern custom, before the prin∣cipal gate of his wooden palace. The Romans, both of the East and of the West, were twice in∣vited to the banquets, where Attila feasted with the princes and nobles of Scythia. Maximin <NOTE PLACE="marg">The royal feast.</NOTE> and his colleagues were stopped on the threshold, till they had made a devout libation to the health and prosperity of the king of the Huns; and were conducted, after this ceremony, to their respective seats in a spacious hall. The royal table and couch, covered with carpets and fine linen, was raised by several steps in the midst of the hall; and a son, an uncle, or perhaps a fa∣vourite king, were admitted to share the simple and homely repast of Attila. Two lines of small tables, each of which contained three or four guests, were ranged in order on either hand; the right was esteemed the most honourable, but the Romans ingenuously confess, that they were placed on the left; and that Beric, an unknown chieftain, most probably of the Gothic race, pre∣ceded
<PB N="78" REF="87"/>
the representatives of Theodosius and Va∣lentinian. The Barbarian monarch received from his cup-bearer a goblet filled with wine, and courteously drank to the health of the most distin∣guished guest; who rose from his seat, and ex∣pressed, in the same manner, his loyal and re∣spectful vows. This ceremony was successively performed for all, or at least for the illustrious persons of the assembly; and a considerable time must have been consumed, since it was thrice repeated, as each course of service was placed on the table. But the wine still remained after the meat had been removed; and the Huns conti∣nued to indulge their intemperance long after the sober and decent ambassadors of the two empires had withdrawn themselves from the nocturnal banquet. Yet before they retired, they enjoyed a singular opportunity of observing the manners of the nation in their convivial amusements. Two Scythians stood before the couch of Attila, and recited the verses which they had composed, to celebrate his valour and his victories. A pro∣found silence prevailed in the hall; and the at∣tention of the guests was captivated by the vocal harmony, which revived and perpetuated the memory of their own exploits: a martial ardour flashed from the eyes of the warriors, who were impatient for battle; and the tears of the old men expressed their generous despair, that they could no longer partake the danger and glory of the field <NOTE N="46" PLACE="foot">If we may believe Plutarch (in Demetrio, tom. v. p. 24.) it was the custom of the Scythians, when they indulged in the pleasures of the table, to awaken their languid courage by the martial harmony of twanging their bow-strings.</NOTE>. This entertainment, which might be
<PB N="79" REF="88"/>
considered as a school of military virtue, was succeeded by a farce, that debased the dignity of human nature. A Moorish and a Scythian buffoon successively excited the mirth of the rude spec∣tators, by their deformed figure, ridiculous dress, antic gestures, absurd speeches, and the strange unintelligible confusion of the Latin, the Gothic, and the Hunnic languages; and the hall resound∣ed with loud and licentious peals of laughter. In the midst of this intemperate riot, Attila alone, without a change of countenance, maintained his stedfast and inflexible gravity; which was never relaxed, except on the entrance of Irnac, the youngest of his sons: he embraced the boy with a smile of paternal tenderness, gently pinched him by the cheek, and betrayed a partial affec∣tion, which was justified by the assurance of his prophets, that Irnac would be the future support of his family and empire. Two days afterwards, the ambassadors received a second invitation; and they had reason to praise the politeness, as well as the hospitality, of Attila. The king of the Huns held a long and familiar conversation with Maxi∣min; but his civility was interrupted by rude expressions, and haughty reproaches; and he was provoked, by a motive of interest, to support with unbecoming zeal, the private claims of his secretary Constantius. <Q REND="inline">"The emperor" (said Attila) "has long promised him a rich wife: Constantius must not be disappointed; nor should a Roman emperor deserve the name of liar."</Q> On the third day, the ambassadors
<PB N="80" REF="89"/>
were dismissed; the freedom of several captives was granted, for a moderate ransom, to their pressing entreaties; and, besides the royal pre∣sents, they were permitted to accept from each of the Scythian nobles, the honourable and useful gift of a horse. Maximin returned, by the same road, to Constantinople; and though he was in∣volved in an accidental dispute with Beric, the new ambassador of Attila, he flattered himself that he had contributed, by the laborious journey, to confirm the peace and alliance of the two na∣tions <NOTE N="47" PLACE="foot">The curious narrative of this embassy, which required few observations, and was not susceptible of any collateral evidence, may be found in Priscus, p. 49—70. But I have not confined my∣self to the same order; and I had previously extracted the historical circumstances, which were less intimately connected with the journey, and business, of the Roman ambassadors.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the Roman ambassador was ignorant of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Conspira∣cy of the Romans a∣gainst the life of At∣tila.</NOTE> treacherous design, which had been concealed un∣der the mask of the public faith. The surprise and satisfaction of Edecon, when he contemplated the splendour of Constantinople, had encouraged the interpreter Vigilius to procure for him a secret interview with the eunuch Chrysaphius <NOTE N="48" PLACE="foot">M. de Tillemont has very properly given the succession of Chamberlains, who reigned in the name of Theodosius. Chrysa∣phius was the last, and, according to the unanimous evidence of his∣tory, the worst of these favourites (see Hist. des Empereurs, tom. vi. p. 117—119. Mem. Eccles. tom. xv. p. 438.). His partiality for his godfather, the heresiarch Eutyches, engaged him to persecute the orthodox party.</NOTE>, who governed the emperor and the empire. After some previous conversation, and a mutual oath of secrecy, the eunuch, who had not, from his
<PB N="81" REF="90"/>
own feelings or experience, imbibed any exalted notions of ministerial virtue, ventured to propose the death of Attila, as an important service, by which Edecon might deserve a liberal share of the wealth and luxury which he admired. The ambassador of the Huns listened to the tempting offer; and professed, with apparent zeal, his abi∣lity, as well as readiness, to execute the bloody deed: the design was communicated to the mas∣ter of the offices, and the devout Theodosius consented to the assassination of his invincible enemy. But this perfidious conspiracy was de∣feated by the dissimulation, or the repentance, of Edecon; and, though he might exaggerate his inward abhorrence for the treason, which he seemed to approve, he dexterously assumed the merit of an early and voluntary confession. If we <HI>now</HI> review the embassy of Maximin, and the behaviour of Attila, we must applaud the Bar∣barian, who respected the laws of hospitality, and generously entertained and dismissed the minister of a prince, who had conspired against his life. But the rashness of Vigilius will appear still more extraordinary, since he returned, conscious of his guilt and danger, to the royal camp; accom∣panied by his son, and carrying with him a weighty purse of gold, which the favourite eu∣nuch had furnished, to satisfy the demands of Edecon, and to corrupt the fidelity of the guards. The interpreter was instantly seized, and dragged before the tribunal of Attila, where he asserted his innocence with specious firmness, till the
<PB N="82" REF="91"/>
threat of inflicting instant death on his son, ex∣torted from him a sincere discovery of the crimi∣nal transaction. Under the name of ransom or confiscation, the rapacious king of the Huns accepted two hundred pounds of gold for the life of a traitor, whom he disdained to punish. He pointed his just indignation against a nobler ob∣ject. His ambassadors Eslaw and Orestes were <NOTE PLACE="marg">He repri∣mands and forgives the Empe∣ror.</NOTE> immediately dispatched to Constantinople, with a peremptory instruction, which it was much safer for them to execute than to disobey. They boldly entered the Imperial presence, with the fatal purse hanging down from the neck of Orestes; who interrogated the eunuch Chrysaphius, as he stood beside the throne, whether he recognised the evi∣dence of his guilt. But the office of reproof was reserved for the superior dignity of his colleague Eslaw, who gravely addressed the Emperor of the East in the following words: <Q REND="inline">"Theodosius is the son of an illustrious and respectable parent: Attila likewise is descended from a noble race; and <HI>he</HI> has supported, by his actions, the dig∣nity which he inherited from his father Mund∣zuk. But Theodosius has forfeited his pater∣nal honours, and, by consenting to pay tribute, has degraded himself to the condition of a slave. It is therefore just, that he should reve∣rence the man whom fortune and merit have placed above him; instead of attempting, like a wicked slave, clandestinely to conspire against his master."</Q> The son of Arcadius, who was accustomed only to the voice of flattery, heard
<PB N="83" REF="92"/>
with astonishment the severe language of truth: he blushed and trembled; nor did he presume directly to refuse the head of Chrysaphius, which Eslaw and Orestes were instructed to demand. A solemn embassy, armed with full powers and magnificent gifts, was hastily sent to deprecate the wrath of Attila; and his pride was gratified by the choice of Nomius and Anatolius, two ministers of consular or patrician rank, of whom the one was great treasurer, and the other was master-general of the armies of the East. He condescended to meet these ambassadors on the banks of the river Drenco; and though he at first affected a stern and haughty demeanor, his anger was insensibly mollified by their eloquence and liberality. He condescended to pardon the em∣peror, the eunuch, and the interpreter; bound himself by an oath to observe the conditions of peace; released a great number of captives; abandoned the fugitives and deserters to their fate; and resigned a large territory to the south of the Danube, which he had already exhausted of its wealth and inhabitants. But this treaty was purchased at an expence which might have supported a vigorous and successful war; and the subjects of Theodosius were compelled to redeem the safety of a worthless favourite by oppressive taxes, which they would more cheerfully have paid for his destruction <NOTE N="49" PLACE="foot">This secret conspiracy, and its important consequences, may be traced in the fragments of Priscus, p. 37, 38, 39. 54. 70, 71, 72.

His sister Pulcheria, whose authority had been con∣trouled both in civil and ecclesiastical affairs by the pernicious influence of the eunuchs, was una∣nimously proclaimed Empress of the East; and the Romans, for the first time, submitted to a female reign. No sooner had Pulcheria ascended the throne, than she indulged her own, and the public resentment, by an act of popular justice. Without any legal trial, the eunuch Chrysaphius was executed before the gates of the city; and the immense riches which had been accumulated by the rapacious favourite, served only to hasten and to justify his punishment <NOTE N="51" PLACE="foot">Pulcheriae nutû (says Count Marcellinus) suâ cum avaritiâ in∣teremptus est.

He was born in Thrace, and educated to the profession of arms; but Marci∣an's youth had been severely exercised by poverty and misfortune, since his only resource, when he first arrived at Constantinople, consisted in two hundred pieces of gold, which he had borrowed of a friend. He passed nineteen years in the domestic and military service of Aspar, and his son Ardaburius; followed those powerful generals to the Persian and African wars; and obtained, by their influence, the honourable rank of tri∣bune and senator.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXV. <HI>Invasion of Gaul by Attila.—He is repulsed by Aetius and the Visigoths.—Attila invades and evacuates Italy.—The Deaths of Attila, Aetius, and Valen∣tinian the Third.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT was the opinion of Marcian, that war should be avoided, as long as it is possible to pre∣serve a secure and honourable peace; but it was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Attila threatens both em∣pires, and prepares to invade Gaul, A. D. 450.</NOTE> likewise his opinion, that peace cannot be ho∣nourable or secure, if the sovereign betrays a pusillanimous aversion to war. This temperate courage dictated his reply to the demands of At∣tila, who insolently pressed the payment of the annual tribute. The emperor signified to the Barbarians, that they must no longer insult the majesty of Rome, by the mention of a tribute; that he was disposed to reward, with becoming liberality, the faithful friendship of his allies; but that, if they presumed to violate the public peace, they should feel that he possessed troops, and arms, and resolution, to repel their attacks. The same language, even in the camp of the Huns, was used by his ambassador Apollonius, whose bold refusal to deliver the presents, till he had been admitted to a personal interview, displayed a sense of dignity, and a contempt of danger, which Attila was not prepared to expect from the
<PB N="88" REF="97"/>
degenerate Romans <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Priscus, p. 39. 72.</NOTE>. He threatened to chastise the rash successor of Theodosius; but he hesitated, whether he should first direct his invincible arms against the Eastern or the Western empire. While mankind awaited his decision with awful suspense, he sent an equal defiance to the courts of Ra∣venna and Constantinople; and his ministers saluted the two emperors with the same haughty declaration. <Q REND="inline">"Attila, <HI>my</HI> lord, and <HI>thy</HI> lord, commands thee to provide a palace for his immediate reception <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The Alexandrian or Paschal Chronicle, which introduces this haughty message, during the lifetime of Theodosius, may have anti∣cipated the date; but the dull annalist was incapable of inventing the original and genuine style of Attila.</NOTE>."</Q> But as the Barbarian despised, or affected to despise, the Romans of the East, whom he had so often vanquished, he soon declared his resolution of suspending the easy conquest, till he had atchieved a more glo∣rious and important enterprise. In the memo∣rable invasions of Gaul and Italy, the Huns were naturally attracted by the wealth and fertility of those provinces; but the particular motives and provocations of Attila, can only be explained by the state of the Western empire under the reign of Valentinian, or, to speak more correctly, un∣der the administration of Aetius <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">The second book of the Histoire Critique de l'Etablissement de la Monarchie Françoise, tom. i. p. 189—424, throws great light on the state of Gaul, when it was invaded by Attila; but the ingeni∣ous author, the Abbé Dubos, too often bewilders himself in system and conjecture.</NOTE>.</P>

D. 433—454.</NOTE> at the head of sixty thousand Barbarians; and the empress Placidia confessed, by a feeble resistance, that the condescension, which might have been ascribed to clemency, was the effect of weakness or fear. She delivered herself, her son Valentinian, and the Western empire, into the hands of an insolent subject; nor could Placidia protect the son-in-law of Boniface, the virtuous and faithful Sebastian <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Victor Vitensis (de Persecut. Vandal. l. i. c. 6. p. 8. edit.

The fortunate Aetius, who was im∣mediately promoted to the rank of patrician, and thrice invested with the honours of the confulship, assumed, with the title of master of the cavalry and infantry, the whole military power of the state; and he is sometimes styled, by contempo∣rary writers, the Duke, or General, of the Ro∣mans of the West. His prudence, rather than his virtue, engaged him to leave the grandson of Theodosius in the possession of the purple; and Valentinian was permitted to enjoy the peace and

The graceful figure of Aetius was not above the middle stature; but his manly limbs were admirably formed for strength, beauty, and agility; and he ex∣celled in the martial exercises of managing a horse, drawing the bow, and darting the jave∣lin. He could patiently endure the want of food or of sleep; and his mind and body were alike capable of the most laborious efforts.

A seasonable treaty, which he concluded with Genseric, protected Italy from the depredations of the Vandals; the independent Britons implored and acknowledged his salutary aid; the Imperial authority was restored and maintained in Gaul and Spain; and he compelled the Franks and the Suevi, whom he had van∣quished in the field, to become the useful con∣federates of the republic.</P>
<P>From a principle of interest, as well as grati∣tude, <NOTE PLACE="marg">His con∣nection with the Huns and Alani.</NOTE> Aetius assiduously cultivated the alliance of the Huns. While he resided in their tents as a hostage, or an exile, he had familiarly conversed with Attila himself, the nephew of his benefactor; and the two famous antagonists appear to have been connected by a personal and military friend∣ship, which they afterwards confirmed by mutual gifts, frequent embassies, and the education of Carpilio, the son of Aetius, in the camp of At∣tila. By the specious professions of gratitude
<PB N="92" REF="101"/>
and voluntary attachment, the patrician might disguise his apprehensions of the Scythian con∣queror, who pressed the two empires with his in∣numerable armies. His demands were obeyed or eluded.

Strangers to the emperor or the republic, the Alani of Gaul were devoted to the ambition of Aetius; and though he might suspect, that, in a contest with Attila himself, they would revolt to the standard of their national king, the patrician laboured to restrain, rather than to excite, their zeal and resentment against the Goths, the Burgundians, and the Franks.</P>

See Valesius, Notit. Galliarum, p. 503. D'Anville, No∣tice de l'Ancienne Gaul, p. 284. 579.</NOTE>. The walls of Narbonne had been shaken by the battering engines, and the inhabitants had endured the last extremities of famine, when count Litorius, approaching in silence, and directing each horseman to carry behind him two sacks of flour, cut his way through the intrenchments of the besiegers. The siege was immediately raised; and the more decisive victory, which is ascribed to the personal conduct of Aetius himself, was marked with the blood of eight thousand Goths. But in the absence of the patrician, who was hastily summoned to Italy by some public or private interest, count Litorius succeeded to the command; and his presumption soon discovered, that far different talents are re∣quired to lead a wing of cavalry, or to direct the operations of an important war. At the head of an army of Huns, he rashly advanced to the gates of Thoulouse, full of careless contempt for an enemy, whom his misfortunes had rendered prudent, and his situation made desperate. The predictions of the Augurs had inspired Litorius with the profane confidence, that he should enter the Gothic capital in triumph; and the trust which he reposed in his Pagan allies, encouraged him to reject the fair conditions of peace, which

The king of the Goths ex∣hibited in his distress the edifying contrast of Christian piety and moderation; nor did he lay aside his sackcloth and ashes till he was prepared to arm for the combat. His soldiers, animated with martial and religious enthusiasm, assaulted the camp of Litorius. The conflict was obstinate; the slaughter was mutual. The Roman general, after a total defeat, which could be imputed only to his unskilful rashness, was actually led through the streets of Thoulouse, not in his own, but in a hostile, triumph; and the misery which he expe∣rienced, in a long and ignominious captivity, excited the compassion of the Barbarians them∣selves <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">Salvian has attempted to explain the moral government of the Deity; a task which may be readily performed by supposing, that the calamities of the wicked are, <HI>judgments,</HI> and those of the righteous, <HI>trials.</HI></NOTE>.

This horrid act, which must seem incredible to a civilized age, drew tears from every spectator; but Theodoric was urged, by the feelings of a parent and a king, to revenge such irreparable injuries. The Imperial ministers, who always cherished the discord of the Barba∣rians, would have supplied the Goths with arms, and ships, and treasures, for the African war; and the cruelty of Genseric might have been fatal to himself, if the artful Vandal had not armed, in his cause, the formidable power of the Huns.

Her guilt and shame (such is the absurd language of imperious man) were soon betrayed by the ap∣perances of pregnancy: but the disgrace of the royal family was published to the world by the
<PB N="104" REF="113"/>
imprudence of the empress Placidia; who dis∣missed her daughter, after a strict and shameful confinement, to a remote exile at Constantinople. The unhappy princess passed twelve or fourteen years in the irksome society of the sisters of Theodosius, and their chosen virgins; to whose <HI>crown</HI> Honoria could no longer aspire, and whose monastic assiduity of prayer, fasting, and vigils, she reluctantly imitated. Her impatience of long and hopeless celibacy, urged her to embrace a strange and desperate resolution. The name of Attila was familiar and formidable at Constantinople; and his frequent embassies entertained a perpetual intercourse between his camp and the Imperial palace. In the pursuit of love, or rather of re∣venge, the daughter of Placidia sacrificed every duty, and every prejudice; and offered to deli∣ver her person into the arms of a Barbarian, of whose language she was ignorant, whose figure was scarcely human, and whose religion and man∣ners she abhorred. By the ministry of a faithful eunuch, she transmitted to Attila a ring, the pledge of her affection; and earnestly conjured him to claim her as a lawful spouse, to whom he had been secretly betrothed. These indecent advances were received, however, with coldness and disdain; and the king of the Huns con∣tinued to multiply the number of his wives, till his love was awakened by the more forcible pas∣sions of ambition and avarice. The invasion of Gaul was preceded, and justified, by a formal demand of the princess Honoria, with a just and

equal share of the Imperial patrimony. His pre∣decessors, the ancient Tanjous, had often ad∣dressed, in the same hostile and peremptory man∣ner, the daughters of China; and the pretensions of Attila were not less offensive to the majesty of Rome. A firm, but temperate, refusal was com∣municated to his ambassadors. The right of female succession, though it might derive a spe∣cious argument from the recent examples of Pla∣cidia and Pulcheria, was strenuously denied; and the indissoluble engagements of Honoria were opposed to the claims of her Scythian lo∣ver <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">See Priscus, p. 39, 40.

On the discovery of her connexion with the king of the Huns, the guilty princess had been sent away, as an object of horror, from Constantinople to Italy: her life was spared; but the ceremony of her marriage was performed with some obscure and nominal husband, before she was immured in a perpetual prison, to bewail those crimes and misfortunes, which Honoria might have escaped, had she not been born the daughter of an emperor <NOTE N="30" PLACE="foot">The adventures of Honoria are imperfectly related by Jornan∣des, de Successione Regn. c. 97. and de Reb.

The learned Count, who seems to have undertaken the apology of Attila, and the Barbarians, appeals to the false Ida∣tius, <HI>parcens</HI> civitatibus Germaniae et Galliae, and forgets, that the true Idatius had explicitly affirmed, plurimae civitates <HI>effractae,</HI> among which he enumerates Metz.</NOTE>, their customary maxims of war. They involved, in a promiscuous massacre, the priests who served at the altar, and the infants, who, in the hour of danger, had been providently bap∣tized by the bishop; the flourishing city was de∣livered to the flames, and a solitary chapel of St. Stephen marked the place where it formerly stood. From the Rhine and the Moselle, Attila advanced into the heart of Gaul; crossed the Seine at Auxerre; and, after a long and laborious march, fixed his camp under the walls of Orleans. He was desirous of securing his conquests by the possession of an advantageous post, which com∣manded the passage of the Loire; and he de∣pended on the secret invitation of Sangiban, king of the Alani, who had promised to betray the city, and to revolt from the service of the em∣pire. But this treacherous conspiracy was detect∣ed and disappointed: Orleans had been strength∣ened with recent fortifications; and the assaults of the Huns were vigorously repelled by the faith∣ful valour of the soldiers, or citizens, who de∣fended the place. The pastoral diligence of Anianus, a bishop of primitive sanctity and con∣summate
<PB N="109" REF="118"/>
prudence, exhausted every art of reli∣gious policy to support their courage, till the arrival of the expected succours. After an ob∣stinate siege, the walls were shaken by the batter∣ing rams; the Huns had already occupied the suburbs; and the people, who were incapable of bearing arms, lay prostrate in prayer. Anianus, who anxiously counted the days and hours, dis∣patched a trusty messenger to observe, from the rampart, the face of the distant country. He returned twice, without any intelligence, that could inspire hope or comfort; but, in his third report, he mentioned a small cloud, which he had faintly descried at the extremity of the hori∣zon. "It is the aid of God," exclaimed the bishop, in a tone of pious confidence; and the whole multitude repeated after him, "It is the aid of God." The remote object, on which every eye was fixed, became each moment larger, and more distinct; the Roman and Gothic banners were gradually perceived; and a favourable wind blowing aside the dust, discovered, in deep array, the impatient squadrons of Aetius and Theodoric, who pressed forwards to the relief of Orleans.</P>
<P>The facility with which Attila had penetrated <NOTE PLACE="marg">Alliance of the Ro∣mans and Visigoths.</NOTE> into the heart of Gaul, may be ascribed to his insidious policy, as well as to the terror of his arms. His public declarations were skilfully mitigated by his private assurances; he alter∣nately soothed and threatened the Romans and the Goths; and the courts of Ravenna and Thou∣louse, mutually suspicious of each other's inten∣tions,
<PB N="110" REF="119"/>
beheld, with supine indifference, the ap∣proach of their common enemy. Aetius was the sole guardian of the public safety; but his wisest measures were embarrassed by a faction, which, since the death of Placidia, infested the Imperial palace: the youth of Italy trembled at the sound of the trumpet; and the Barbarians, who, from fear or affection, were inclined to the cause of Attila, awaited, with doubtful and venal faith, the event of the war.

But on his arrival at Arles, or Lyons, he was confounded by the intelligence, that the Visigoths, refusing to embrace the defence of Gaul, had determined to expect, within their own territories, the formidable invader, whom they professed to despise. The senator Avitus, who, after the honourable exercise of the praetorian Praefecture, had retired to his estate in Auvergne, was persuaded to accept the important embassy, which he executed with ability and success. He represented to Theodoric, that an ambitious con∣queror, who aspired to the dominion of the earth, could be resisted only by the firm and unani∣mous alliance of the powers whom he laboured to oppress. The lively eloquence of Avitus inflam∣ed the Gothic warriors, by the description of the
<PB N="111" REF="120"/>
injuries which their ancestors had suffered from the Huns; whose implacable fury still pursued them from the Danube to the foot of the Pyre∣nees. He strenuously urged, that it was the duty of every Christian to save, from sacrilegious vio∣lation, the churches of God, and the relics of the saints: that it was the interest of every Bar∣barian, who had acquired a settlement in Gaul, to defend the fields and vineyards, which were cultivated for his use, against the desolation of the Scythian shepherds. Theodoric yielded to the evidence of truth; adopted the measure at once the most prudent and the most honourable; and declared, that as the faithful ally of Aetius and the Romans, he was ready to expose his life and kingdom for the common safety of Gaul <NOTE N="37" PLACE="foot">The policy of Attila, of Aetius, and of the Visigoths, is im∣perfectly described in the Panegyric of Avitus, and the thirty-sixth chapter of Jornandes.

But the unusual de∣spondency, which seemed to prevail among the Huns, engaged Attila to use the expedient, so familiar to the generals of antiquity, of animating his troops by a military oration; and his language was that of a king, who had often fought and conquered at their head <NOTE N="43" PLACE="foot">I am sensible that these military orations are usually composed by the historian; yet the old Ostrogoths, who had served under Attila, might repeat his discourse to Cassiodorius: the ideas, and even the expressions, have an original Scythian cast; and I doubt, whether an Italian of the sixth century, would have thought of the hujus certaminis <HI>gaudia.</HI></NOTE>. He pressed them to consider their past glory, their actual danger, and their future hopes. The same fortune, which opened the deserts and morasses of Scy∣thia to their unarmed valour, which had laid so many warlike nations prostrate at their feet, had reserved the <HI>joys</HI> of this memorable field for the consummation of their victories. The cautious steps of their enemies, their strict alliance, and their advantageous posts he artfully represented as the effects, not of prudence, but
<PB N="115" REF="124"/>
of fear. The Visigoths alone were the strength and nerves of the opposite army; and the Huns might securely trample on the degenerate Ro∣mans, whose close and compact order betrayed their apprehensions, and who were equally inca∣pable of supporting the dangers, or the fatigues, of a day of battle. The doctrine of predestina∣tion, so favourable to martial virtue, was care∣fully inculcated by the king of the Huns; who assured his subjects, that the warriors, protected by Heaven, were safe and invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy; but that the unerring Fates would strike their victims in the bosom of inglorious peace. <Q REND="inline">"I myself," continued Attila, "will throw the first javelin, and the wretch who refuses to imitate the example of his so∣vereign, is devoted to inevitable death."</Q> The spirit of the Barbarians was rekindled by the pre∣sence, the voice, and the example of their in∣trepid leader; and Attila, yielding to their im∣patience, immediately formed his order of battle. At the head of his brave and faithful Huns, he occupied, in person, the centre of the line. The nations, subject to his empire, the Rugians, the Heruli, the Thuringians, the Franks, the Bur∣gundians, were extended, on either hand, over the ample space of the Catalaunian fields; the right wing was commanded by Ardaric, king of the Gepidae; and the three valiant brothers, who reigned over the Ostrogoths, were posted on the left to oppose the kindred tribes of the Visigoths. The disposition of the allies was regulated by a different principle. Sangiban, the faithless king of the Ala∣ni,
<PB N="116" REF="125"/>
was placed in the centre; where his motions might be strictly watched, and his treachery might be instantly punished. Aetius assumed the command of the left, and Theodoric of the right, wing; while Torismond still continued to occupy the heights which appear to have stretched on the flank, and perhaps the rear, of the Scythian army. The nations from the Volga to the Atlan∣tic were assembled on the plain of Châlons; but many of these nations had been divided by fac∣tion, or conquest, or emigration; and the ap∣pearance of similar arms and ensigns, which threatened each other, presented the image of a civil war.</P>
<P>The discipline and tactics of the Greeks and Romans form an interesting part of their national <NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Châlons.</NOTE> manners. The attentive study of the military operations of Xenophon, or Caesar, or Frederic, when they are described by the same genius which conceived and executed them, may tend to im∣prove (if such improvement can be wished) the art of destroying the human species. But the battle of Châlons can only excite our curiosity, by the magnitude of the object; since it was de∣cided by the blind impetuosity of Barbarians, and has been related by partial writers, whose civil or ecclesiastical profession secluded them from the knowledge of military affairs. Cassiodorius, how∣ever, had familiarly conversed with many Gothic warriors, who served in that memorable engage∣ment; <Q REND="inline">"a conflict," as they informed him, "fierce, various, obstinate, and bloody; such as could not be paralleled, either in the pre∣sent,

or in past ages."</Q> The number of the slain amounted to one hundred and sixty-two thousand, or, according to another account, three hundred thousand persons <NOTE N="44" PLACE="foot">The expressions of Jornandes, or rather of Cassiodorius, are extremely strong. Bellum atrox, multiplex, immane, pertinax, cui simili nulla usquam narrat antiquitas: ubi talia gesta referuntur, ut nihil esset quod in vitâ suâ conspicere potuisset egregius, qui hujus miraculi privaretur aspectû. Dubos (Hist. Critique, tom. i. p. 392, 393.) attempts to reconcile the 162,000 of Jornandes, with the 300,000 of Idatius and Isidore; by supposing, that the larger num∣ber included the total destruction of the war, the effects of disease, the slaughter of the unarmed people, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and these incredible exaggerations suppose a real and effective loss, sufficient to justify the historian's remark, that whole generations may be swept away, by the madness of kings, in the space of a single hour. After the mutual and repeated discharge of missile weapons, in which the archers of Scythia might signalize their superior dexterity, the cavalry and infantry of the two armies were furiously mingled in closer combat. The Huns, who fought under the eyes of their king, pierced through the feeble and doubtful centre of the allies, separated their wings from each other, and wheeling, with a rapid effort, to the left, directed their whole force against the Visigoths. As Theodoric rode along the ranks, to animate his troops, he re∣ceived a mortal stroke from the javelin of An∣dages, a noble Ostrogoth, and immediately fell from his horse. The wounded king was op∣pressed in the general disorder, and trampled under the feet of his own cavalry; and this im∣portant death served to explain the ambiguous prophecy of the Haruspices. Attila already ex∣ulted

in the confidence of victory, when the valiant Torismond descended from the hills, and verified the remainder of the prediction. The Visigoths, who had been thrown into confusion by the flight, or defection, of the Alani, gra∣dually restored their order of battle; and the Huns were undoubtedly vanquished, since Attila was compelled to retreat. He had exposed his person with the rashness of a private soldier; but the intrepid troops of the centre had pushed for∣wards beyond the rest of the line: their attack was faintly supported; their flanks were un∣guarded; and the conquerors of Scythia and Germany were saved by the approach of the night from a total defeat. They retired within the circle of waggons that fortified their camp; and the dismounted squadrons prepared themselves for a defence, to which neither their arms, nor their temper, were adapted. The event was doubtful: but Attila had secured a last and ho∣nourable resource. The saddles and rich furni∣ture of the cavalry were collected, by his order, into a funeral pile; and the magnanimous Bar∣barian had resolved, if his intrenchments should be forced, to rush headlong into the flames, and to deprive his enemies of the glory which they might have acquired, by the death or captivity of Attila <NOTE N="45" PLACE="foot">The count de Buat (Hist. des Peuples, &amp;c. tom. vii. p. 554—573.), still depending on the <HI>false,</HI> and again rejecting the <HI>true</HI> Ida∣tius, has divided the defeat of Attila into two great battles; the for∣mer near Orleans, the latter in Champagne: in the one, Theodoric was slain; in the other, he was revenged.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="128"/>
But his enemies had passed the night in equal disorder and anxiety. The inconsiderate courage of Torismond was tempted to urge the pursuit, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Retreat of Attila.</NOTE> till he unexpectedly found himself, with a few followers, in the midst of the Scythian waggons. In the confusion of a nocturnal combat, he was thrown from his horse; and the Gothic prince must have perished like his father, if his youth∣ful strength, and the intrepid zeal of his com∣panions, had not rescued him from this dangerous situation. In the same manner, but on the left of the line, Aetius himself, separated from his allies, ignorant of their victory, and anxious for their fate, encountered and escaped the hostile troops, that were scattered over the plains of Châlons; and at length reached the camp of the Goths, which he could only fortify with a slight rampart of shields, till the dawn of day. The Imperial general was soon satisfied of the defeat of Attila, who still remained inactive within his intrenchments; and when he contemplated the bloody scene, he observed, with secret satisfac∣tion, that the loss had principally fallen on the Barbarians. The body of Theodoric, pierced with honourable wounds, was discovered under a heap of the slain: his subjects bewailed the death of their king and father; but their tears were min∣gled with songs and acclamations, and his funeral rites were performed in the face of a vanquished enemy. The Goths, clashing their arms, elevated on a buckler his eldest son Torismond, to whom they justly ascribed the glory of their success; and the new king accepted the obligation of re∣venge,
<PB N="120" REF="129"/>
as a sacred portion of his paternal inhe∣ritance. Yet the Goths themselves were asto∣nished by the fierce and undaunted aspect of their formidable antagonist; and their historian has compared Attila to a lion encompassed in his den, and threatening his hunters with redoubled fury. The kings and nations, who might have deserted his standard in the hour of distress, were made sensible, that the displeasure of their monarch was the most imminent and inevitable danger. All his instruments of martial music incessantly sounded a loud and animating strain of defiance; and the foremost troops who advanced to the assault, were checked, or destroyed, by showers of arrows from every side of the intrenchments. It was determined in a general council of war, to besiege the king of the Huns in his camp, to intercept his provisions, and to reduce him to the alternative of a disgraceful treaty, or an un∣equal combat. But the impatience of the Bar∣barians soon disdained these cautious and dilatory measures: and the mature policy of Aetius was apprehensive, that, after the extirpation of the Huns, the republic would be oppressed by the pride and power of the Gothic nation. The patrician exerted the superior ascendant of autho∣rity and reason, to calm the passions, which the son of Theodoric considered as a duty; repre∣sented, with seeming affection, and real truth, the dangers of absence and delay; and persuaded Torismond to disappoint, by his speedy return, the ambitious designs of his brothers, who might occupy the throne and treasures of Thou∣louse <NOTE N="46" PLACE="foot">Jornandes de Rebus Geticis, c. 41. p. 671. The policy of Aetius, and the behaviour of Torismond, are extremely natural; and the patrician, according to Gregory of Tours (l. ii. c. 7. p. 163.), dismissed the prince of the Franks, by suggesting to him a similar apprehension. The false Idatius ridiculously pretends, that Aetius paid a clandestine, nocturnal, visit to the kings of the Huns and of the Visigoths; from each of whom he obtained a bribe of ten thousand pieces of gold, as the price of an undisturbed retreat.</NOTE>.
<PB N="121" REF="130"/>
After the departure of the Goths, and the separation of the allied army, Attila was sur∣prised at the vast silence that reigned over the plains of Châlons: the suspicion of some hostile stratagem detained him several days within the circle of his waggons; and his retreat beyond the Rhine confessed the last victory which was attchieved in the name of the Western empire. Meroveus and his Franks, observing a prudent distance, and magnifying the opinion of their strength, by the numerous fires which they kin∣dled every night, continued to follow the rear of the Huns, till they reached the confines of Thuringia. The Thuringians served in the army of Attila: they traversed, both in their march and in their return, the territories of the Franks; and it was perhaps in this war that they exercised the cruelties, which, about fourscore years after∣wards, were revenged by the son of Clovis. They massacred their hostages, as well as their cap∣tives: two hundred young maidens were tortured with exquisite and unrelenting rage; their bodies were torn asunder by wild horses, or their bones were crushed under the weight of rolling wag∣gons; and their unburied limbs were abandoned on the public roads, as a prey to dogs and vul∣tures.
<PB N="122" REF="131"/>
Such were those savage ancestors, whose imaginary virtues have sometimes excited the praise and envy of civilized ages <NOTE N="47" PLACE="foot">These cruelties, which are passionately deplored by Theodoric, the son of Clovis (Gregory of Tours, l. iii. c. 10. p. 190.), suit the time and circumstances of the invasion of Artila. His residence in Thuringia was long attested by popular tradition; and he is sup∣posed to have assembled a <HI>couroultai,</HI> or diet, in the territory of Eise∣nach.

<P>Neither the spirit, nor the forces, nor the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of Italy by Attila, A. D. 452.</NOTE> reputation of Attila, were impaired by the fai∣lure of the Gallic expedition. In the ensuing spring, he repeated his demand, of the princess Honoria, and her patrimonial treasures. The demand was again rejected, or eluded; and the indignant lover immediately took the field, passed the Alps, invaded Italy, and besieged Aquileia with an innumerable host of Barbarians. Those Barbarians were unskilled in the methods of con∣ducting a regular siege, which, even among the ancients, required some knowledge, or at least some practice, of the mechanic arts. But the labour of many thousand provincials and captives, whose lives were sacrificed without pity, might execute the most painful and dangerous work. The skill of the Roman artists might be cor∣rupted to the destruction of their country. The walls of Aquileia were assaulted by a formidable train of battering rams, moveable turrets, and engines, that threw stones, darts, and fire <NOTE N="48" PLACE="foot">Machinis constructis, omnibusque tormentorum generibus ad∣hibitis. Jornandes, c. 42. p. 673. In the thirteenth century, the Moguls battered the cities of China with large engines, constructed by the Mahometans or Christians in their service, which threw stones from 150 to 300 pounds weight. In the defence of their country, the Chinese used gunpowder, and even bombs, above an hundred years before they were known in Europe; yet even those celestial, or infernal, arms were insufficient to protect a pusillanimous nation.

the monarch of the Huns employed the forcible impulse of hope, fear, emulation, and interest, to subvert the only barrier which delayed the conquest of Italy. Aquileia was at that period one of the richest, the most populous, and the strongest of the maritime cities of the Hadriatic coast. The Gothic auxiliaries, who appear to have served under their native princes Alaric and Antala, communicated their intrepid spirit; and the citizens still remembered the glorious and successful resistance, which their ancestors had opposed to a fierce, inexorable Barbarian, who disgraced the majesty of the Roman purple. Three months were consumed without effect in the siege of Aquileia; till the want of provisions, and the clamours of his army, compelled Attila to relinquish the enterprise; and reluctantly to issue his orders, that the troops should strike their tents the next morning, and begin their retreat. But as he rode round the walls, pen∣sive, angry, and disappointed, he observed a stork, preparing to leave her nest, in one of the towers, and to fly with her infant family towards the country. He seized, with the ready penetration of a statesman, this trifling incident, which chance had offered to superstition; and exclaimed, in a

loud and cheerful tone, that such a domestic bird, so constantly attached to human society, would never have abandoned her ancient seats, unless those towers had been devoted to impend∣ing ruin and solitude <NOTE N="49" PLACE="foot">The same story is told by Jornandes, and by Procopius (de Bell.

But the Greek historian is guilty of an inex∣cuseable mistake, in placing the siege of Aquileia <HI>after</HI> the death of Aetius.</NOTE>. The favourable omen inspired an assurance of victory; the siege was renewed, and prosecuted with fresh vigour; a large breach was made in the part of the wall from whence the stork had taken her flight; the Huns mounted to the assault with irresistible fury; and the succeeding generation could scarcely dis∣cover the ruins of Aquileia <NOTE N="50" PLACE="foot">Jornandes, about an hundred years afterwards, affirms, that Aquileia was so completely ruined, ita ut vix ejus vestigia, ut appa∣reant, reliquerint.

The name of Aquileia was sometimes applied to Forum Julii (Ci∣vidad del Friuli), the more recent capital of the Venetian province.</NOTE>. After this dread∣ful chastisement, Attila pursued his march; and as he passed, the cities of Altinum, Concordia, and Padua, were reduced into heaps of stones and ashes. The inland towns, Vicenza, Verona, and Bergamo, were exposed to the rapacious cruelty of the Huns. Milan and Pavia submitted, with∣out resistance, to the loss of their wealth; and applauded the unusual clemency, which preserv∣ed from the flames the public, as well as private, buildings; and spared the lives of the captive multitude. The popular traditions of Comum, Turin, or Modena, may justly be suspected; yet

Yet the savage de∣stroyer <NOTE PLACE="marg">Founda∣tion of the republic of Venice.</NOTE> undesignedly laid the foundations of a republic, which revived, in the feudal state of Europe, the art and spirit of commercial industry.

Before the irruption of the Barbarians, fifty Venetian cities flourished in peace and prosperity: Aquileia was placed in the most conspicuous station: but the ancient dignity of Padua was supported by agriculture and ma∣nufactures; and the property of five hundred citizens, who were entitled to the equestrian rank, must have amounted, at the strictest computation, to one million seven hundred thousand pounds. Many families of Aquileia, Padua, and the adja∣cent towns, who fled from the sword of the Huns, found a safe, though obscure, refuge in the neigh∣bouring islands <NOTE N="55" PLACE="foot">This emigration is not attested by any contemporary evidence: but the fact is proved by the event, and the circumstances might be preserved by tradition.

Till the middle of the fifth century, these remote and sequestered spots remained without cultivation, with few inhabitants, and almost without a name.

Fish was the common, and almost the universal,

food of every rank: their only treasure consisted in the plenty of salt, which they extracted from the sea: and the exchange of that commodity, so essential to human life, was substituted in the neighbouring markets to the currency of gold and silver. A people, whose habitations might be doubtfully assigned to the earth or water, soon became alike familiar with the two elements; and the demands of avarice succeeded to those of necessity. The islanders, who, from Grado to Chiozza, were intimately connected with each other, penetrated into the heart of Italy, by the secure, though laborious, navigation of the rivers and inland canals. Their vessels, which were continually increasing in size and number, visited all the harbours of the Gulf; and the mar∣riage, which Venice annually celebrates with the Hadriatic, was contracted in her early infancy. The epistle of Cassiodorius, the Praetorian prae∣fect, is addressed to the maritime tribunes: and he exhorts them, in a mild tone of authority, to animate the zeal of their countrymen for the pub∣lic service, which required their assistance to transport the magazines of wine and oil from the province of Istria to the royal city of Ravenna. The ambiguous office of these magistrates is ex∣plained by the tradition, that, in the twelve prin∣cipal islands, twelve tribunes, or judges, were created by an annual and popular election.

<P>The Italians, who had long since renounced <NOTE PLACE="marg">Attila gives peace to the Ro∣mans.</NOTE> the exercise of arms, were surprised, after forty years peace, by the approach of a formidable Barbarian, whom they abhorred, as the enemy of their religion, as well as of their republic. Amidst the general consternation, Aetius alone was incapable of fear; but it was impossible that he should atchieve, alone, and unassisted, any military exploits worthy of his former renown. The Barbarians who had defended Gaul, refused to march to the relief of Italy; and the succours promised by the Eastern emperor were distant and doubtful. Since Aetius, at the head of his do∣mestic troops, still maintained the field, and ha∣rassed or retarded the march of Attila, he never shewed himself more truly great, than at the time when his conduct was blamed by an ignorant and ungrateful people <NOTE N="59" PLACE="foot">Sirmond (Not. ad Sidon.

Theodosius, instead of sharing the dangers, es∣caped from the sound of war; and his hasty retreat from Ravenna to Rome, from an impreg∣nable fortress to an open capital, betrayed his secret intention of abandoning Italy, as soon as the danger should approach his Imperial person. This shameful abdication was suspended, how∣ever, by the spirit of doubt and delay, which commonly adheres to pusillanimous counsels, and sometimes corrects their pernicious tendency. The Western emperor, with the senate and peo∣ple of Rome, embraced the more salutary reso∣lution of deprecating, by a solemn and suppliant embassy, the wrath of Attila.

His mind, su∣perior to real danger, was assaulted by imaginary terrors; nor could he escape the influence of superstition, which had so often been subservient to his designs <NOTE N="65" PLACE="foot">The historian Priscus had positively mentioned the effect which this example produced on the mind of Attila. Jornandes, c. 42. p. 673.</NOTE>. The pressing eloquence of Leo, his majestic aspect, and sacerdotal robes, excited the veneration of Attila for the spiritual father of the Christians. The apparition of the two apostles, St. Peter and St. Paul, who menaced the Bar∣barian with instant death, if he rejected the prayer of their successor, is one of the noblest legends of ecclesiastical tradition. The safety of Rome might deserve the interposition of celestial beings; and some indulgence is due to a fable, which has been represented by the pencil of Raphael, and the chissel of Algardi <NOTE N="66" PLACE="foot">The picture of Raphael is in the Vatican; the basso (or per∣haps the alto) relievo of Algardi, on one of the altars of St. Peter's (see Dubos, Reflexions sur la Poesie et sur la Peinture, tom. i. p. 519, 520.). Baronius (Annal. Eccles. A. D. 452. No 57, 58.) bravely sustains the truth of the apparition; which is rejected, how∣ever, by the most learned and pious Catholics.</NOTE>.</P>

Before the king of the Huns evacuated Italy, he threatened to return more dreadful, and more implacable, if his bride, the princess Honoria, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of Attila, A.

Yet, in the mean while, Attila relieved his tender anxiety, by add∣ing a beautiful maid, whose name was Ildico, to the list of his innumerable wives <NOTE N="67" PLACE="foot">Attila, ut Priscus historicus refert, extinctionis suae tempore, puellam Ildico nomine, decoram valde, sibi matrimonium post in∣numerabiles uxores . . . socians.

His attendants con∣tinued to respect his pleasures, or his repose, the greatest part of the ensuing day, till the unusual silence alarmed their fears and suspicions; and, after attempting to awaken Attila by loud and repeated cries, they at length broke into the royal apartment.

An artery had suddenly burst; and as Attila lay in a supine posture, he was suf∣focated by a torrent of blood, which, instead of finding a passage through the nostrils, regurgi∣tated into the lungs and stomach. His body was solemnly exposed in the midst of the plain, un∣der a silken pavilion; and the chosen squadrons of the Huns, wheeling round in measured evo∣lutions, chaunted a funeral song to the memory of a hero, glorious in his life, invincible in his death, the father of his people, the scourge of his enemies, and the terror of the world. Ac∣cording to their national custom, the Barbarians cut off a part of their hair, gashed their faces with unseemly wounds, and bewailed their valiant leader as he deserved, not with the tears of wo∣men, but with the blood of warriors. The re∣mains of Attila were inclosed within three coffins, of gold, of silver, and of iron, and privately buried in the night: the spoils of nations were thrown into his grave; the captives who had opened the ground were inhumanly massacred; and the same Huns, who had indulged such ex∣cessive grief, feasted, with dissolute and intem∣perate mirth, about the recent sepulchre of their king. It was reported at Constantinople, that on

<P>The revolution which subverted the empire of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Destruc∣tion of his empire.</NOTE> the Huns, established the fame of Attila, whose genius alone had sustained the huge and disjoint∣ed fabric. After his death, the boldest chief∣tains aspired to the rank of kings; the most pow∣erful kings refused to acknowledge a superior; and the numerous sons, whom so many various mothers bore to the deceased monarch, divided and disputed, like a private inheritance, the so∣vereign command of the nations of Germany and Scythia. The bold Ardaric felt and represented the disgrace of this servile partition; and his sub∣jects, the warlike Gepidae, with the Ostrogoths, under the conduct of three valiant brothers, en∣couraged their allies to vindicate the rights of freedom and royalty. In a bloody and decisive conflict on the banks of the river Netad, in Pan∣nonia, the lance of the Gepidae, the sword of the Goths, the arrows of the Huns, the Suevic in∣fantry, the light arms of the Heruli, and the heavy weapons of the Alani, encountered or sup∣ported each other; and the victory of Ardaric was accompanied with the slaughter of thirty

Ellac, the eldest son of Attila, lost his life and crown in the memo∣rable battle of Netad: his early valour had raised him to the throne of the Acatzires, a Scythian people, whom he subdued; and his father, who loved the superior merit, would have envied the death, of Ellac <NOTE N="70" PLACE="foot">See Jornandes, de Robus Geticis, c. 50. p. 685, 686, 687, 688.

His brother Dengisich, with an army of Huns, still formidable in their flight and ruin, maintained his ground above fifteen years on the banks of the Danube. The palace of Attila, with the old country of Dacia, from the Carpathian hills to the Euxine, became the seat of a new power, which was erected by Ar∣daric, king of the Gepidae. The Pannonian conquests, from Vienna to Sirmium, were occu∣pied by the Ostrogoths; and the settlements of the tribes, who had so bravely asserted their native freedom, were irregularly distributed, according to the measure of their respective strength. Sur∣rounded and oppressed by the multitude of his father's slaves, the kingdom of Dengisich was confined to the circle of his waggons; his des∣perate courage urged him to invade the Eastern empire; he fell in battle; and his head, igno∣miniously exposed in the Hippodrome, exhibited a grateful spectacle to the people of Constan∣tinople. Attila had fondly or superstitiously be∣lieved,

that Irnac, the youngest of his sons, was destined to perpetuate the glories of his race. The character of that prince, who attempted to moderate the rashness of his brother Dengisich, was more suitable to the declining condition of the Huns; and Irnac, with his subject hords, re∣tired into the heart of the Lesser Scythia. They were soon overwhelmed by a torrent of new Bar∣barians, who followed the same road which their own ancestors had formerly discovered. The <HI>Geougen,</HI> or Avares, whose residence is assigned by the Greek writers to the shores of the ocean, impelled the adjacent tribes; till at length the Igours of the North, issuing from the cold Sibe∣rian regions, which produce the most valuable furs, spread themselves over the desert, as far as the Boristhenes and Caspian gates; and finally extinguished the empire of the Huns <NOTE N="71" PLACE="foot">Two modern historians have thrown much new light on the ruin and division of the empire of Attila.

But the emperor of the West, the feeble and dissolute Valentinian, who had reached his thirty-fifth year without attaining the age of reason or cou∣rage, abused this apparent security, to undermine the foundations of his own throne, by the mur∣der of the patrician Aetius. From the instinct
<PB N="138" REF="147"/>
of a base and jealous mind, he hated the man who was universally celebrated as the terror of the barbarians, and the support of the republic; and his new favourite, the eunuch Heraclius, awakened the emperor from the supine lethargy, which might be disguised, during the life of Placidia <NOTE N="72" PLACE="foot">Placidia died at Rome, November 27, A.

See Tillemont, Hist. des Emp. tom. vi. p. 240.</NOTE>, by the excuse of filial piety. The fame of Aetius, his wealth and dignity, the nu∣merous and martial train of Barbarian followers, his powerful dependents, who filled the civil offices of the state, and the hopes of his son Gaudentius, who was already contracted to Eu∣doxia, the emperor's daughter, had raised him above the rank of a subject. The ambitious de∣signs, of which he was secretly accused, excited the fears, as well as the resentment, of Valenti∣nian. Aetius himself, supported by the conscious∣ness of his merit, his services, and perhaps his innocence, seems to have maintained a haughty and indiscreet behaviour. The patrician offended his sovereign by an hostile declaration; he aggra∣vated the offence, by compelling him to ratify, with a solemn oath, a treaty of reconciliation and alliance; he proclaimed his suspicions; he ne∣glected his safety; and from a vain confidence that the enemy, whom he despised, was incapable
<PB N="139" REF="148"/>
even of a manly crime, he rashly ventured his person in the palace of Rome. Whilst he urged, perhaps with intemperate vehemence, the mar∣riage of his son; Valentinian, drawing his sword, the first sword he had ever drawn, plunged it in the breast of a general who had saved his empire: his courtiers and eunuchs ambitiously struggled to imitate their master; and Aetius, pierced with an hundred wounds, fell dead in the royal pre∣sence. Boethius, the Praetorian praefect, was killed at the same moment; and before the event could be divulged, the principal friends of the patrician were summoned to the palace, and separately murdered. The horrid deed, palliated by the specious names of justice and necessity, was immediately communicated by the emperor to his soldiers, his subjects, and his allies. The nations, who were strangers or enemies to Aetius, generously deplored the unworthy fate of a hero: the Barbarians, who had been attached to his service, dissembled their grief and resentment; and the public contempt, which had been so long entertained for Valentinian, was at once converted into deep and universal abhorrence. Such sentiments seldom pervade the walls of a palace; yet the emperor was confounded by the honest reply of a Roman, whose approbation he had not disdained to solicit. <Q REND="inline">"I am ignorant, Sir, of your motives or provocations; I only know, that you have acted like a man who cuts off his right hand with his left <NOTE N="73" PLACE="foot">Actium Placidus mactavit semivir amens, is the expression of Sidonius (Panegyr.

<P><PB N="140" REF="149"/>
The luxury of Rome seems to have attracted the long and frequent visits of Valentinian; who was consequently more despised at Rome, than in <NOTE PLACE="marg">and ra∣vishes the wife of Maximus.</NOTE> any other part of his dominions. A republican spirit was insensibly revived in the senate, as their authority, and even their supplies, became ne∣cessary for the support of his feeble government. The stately demeanour of an hereditary monarch offended their pride; and the pleasures of Valen∣tinian were injurious to the peace and honour of noble families. The birth of the empress Eu∣doxia was equal to his own, and her charms and tender affection deserved those testimonies of love, which her inconstant husband dissipated in vague and unlawful amours. Petronius Maxi∣mus, a wealthy senator of the Anician family, who had been twice consul, was possessed of a chaste and beautiful wife: her obstinate resistance served only to irritate the desires of Valentinian; and he resolved to accomplish them either by strata∣gem or force. Deep gaming was one of the vices of the court: the emperor, who, by chance or contrivance, had gained from Maximus a con∣siderable sum, uncourteously exacted his ring as a security for the debt; and sent it by a trusty messenger to his wife, with an order, in her husband's name, that she should immediately at∣tend the empress Eudoxia. The unsuspecting wife of Maximus was conveyed in her litter to the Imperial palace; the emissaries of her impa∣tient lover conducted her to a remote and silent
<PB N="141" REF="150"/>
bed-chamber; and Valentinian violated, without remorse, the laws of hospitality. Her tears, when she returned home; her deep affliction; and her bitter reproaches against her husband, whom she considered as the accomplice of his own shame, excited Maximus to a just revenge; the desire of revenge was stimulated by ambition; and he might reasonably aspire, by the free suffrage of the Roman senate, to the throne of a detested and despicable rival. Valentinian, who supposed that every human breast was devoid, like his own, of friendship and gratitude, had impru∣dently admitted among his guards several domes∣tics and followers of Aetius. Two of these, of Bar∣barian race, were persuaded to execute a sacred and honourable duty, by punishing with death the assassin of their patron; and their intrepid courage did not long expect a favourable mo∣ment. Whilst Valentinian amused himself in the field of Mars with the spectacle of some military sports, they suddenly rushed upon him with drawn weapons, dispatched the guilty Heraclius, and stabbed the emperor to the heart, without the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Valentini∣an, A.

<P>As early as the time of Cicero and Varro, it <NOTE PLACE="marg">Symptoms of decay and ruin.</NOTE> was the opinion of the Roman augurs, that the <HI>twelve vultures,</HI> which Romulus had seen, repre∣sented the <HI>twelve centuries,</HI> assigned for the fatal period of his city <NOTE N="75" PLACE="foot">This interpretation of Vettius, a celebrated augur, was quoted by Varro, in the xviiith book of his Antiquities.

They abjured and abhorred the name of Roman citizens, which had formerly excited the ambi∣tion of mankind.

<P>THE loss or desolation of the provinces, from the ocean to the Alps, impaired the glory and greatness of Rome: her internal prosperity was ir∣retrievably <NOTE PLACE="marg">Naval power of the Van∣dals.

The rapacious Vandals confiscated the patrimo∣nial estates of the senators, and intercepted the regular subsidies, which relieved the poverty, and encouraged the idleness, of the plebeians. The distress of the Romans was soon aggravated by an unexpected attack; and the province, so long cultivated for their use by industrious and obedient subjects, was armed against them by an ambitious Barbarian. The Vandals and Alani, who followed the successful standard of Genseric, had acquired a rich and fertile territory, which stretched along the coast above ninety days jour∣ney from Tangier to Tripoli; but their narrow limits were pressed and confined, on either side, by the sandy desert and the Mediterranean. The discovery and conquest of the Black nations, that might dwell beneath the torrid zone, could not
<PB N="146" REF="155"/>
tempt the rational ambition of Genseric: but he cast his eyes towards the sea; he resolved to create a naval power, and his bold resolution was executed with steady and active perseverance. The woods of mount Atlas afforded an inexhaustible nur∣sery of timber; his new subjects were skilled in the arts of navigation and ship-building; he animated his daring Vandals to embrace a mode of warfare which would render every maritime country ac∣cessible to their arms; the Moors and Africans were allured by the hopes of plunder; and, after an interval of six centuries, the fleets that issued from the port of Carthage again claimed the em∣pire of the Mediterranean. The success of the Vandals, the conquest of Sicily, the sack of Pa∣lermo, and the frequent descents on the coast of Lucania, awakened and alarmed the mother of Valentinian, and the sister of Theodosius. Al∣liances were formed; and armaments, expensive and ineffectual, were prepared, for the destruction of the common enemy; who reserved his courage to encounter those dangers which his policy could not prevent or elude. The designs of the Roman government were repeatedly baffled by his artful delays, ambiguous promises, and apparent concessions; and the interposition of his formid∣able confederate the king of the Huns, recalled the emperors from the conquest of Africa to the care of their domestic safety. The revolutions of the palace, which left the Western empire with∣out a defender, and without a lawful prince, dis∣pelled the apprehensions, and stimulated the ava∣rice,
<PB N="147" REF="156"/>
of Genseric. He immediately equipped a numerous fleet of Vandals and Moors, and cast anchor at the mouth of the Tyber, about three months after the death of Valentinian, and the elevation of Maximus to the Imperial throne.</P>
<P>The private life of the senator Petronius Maxi∣mus <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Sidonius Apollinaris composed the thirteenth epistle of the se∣cond book, to refute the paradox of his friend Serranus, who en∣tertained a singular, though generous, enthusiasm for the deceased emperor. This epistle, with some indulgence, may claim the praise of an elegant composition; and it throws much light on the charac∣ter of Maximus.</NOTE>, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The cha∣racter and reign of the empe∣ror Maxi∣mus, A. D. 455, March 17.</NOTE> was often alleged as a rare example of hu∣man felicity. His birth was noble and illustrious, since he descended from the Anician family; his dignity was supported by an adequate patrimony in land and money: and these advantages of for∣tune were accompanied with liberal arts, and de∣cent manners, which adorn or imitate the inesti∣mable gifts of genius and virtue. The luxury of his palace and table was hospitable and ele∣gant. Whenever Maximus appeared in public, he was surrounded by a train of grateful and ob∣sequious clients <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Clientum, praevia, pedisequa, circumfusa, populositas, is the train which Sidonius himself (l. i. epist. 9.) assigns to another sena∣tor of consular rank.</NOTE>; and it is possible that among these clients, he might deserve and possess some real friends. His merit was rewarded by the favour of the prince and senate: he thrice exer∣cised the office of Praetorian praefect of Italy; he was twice invested with the consulship, and he obtained the rank of patrician. These civil ho∣nours were not incompatible with the enjoyment
<PB N="148" REF="157"/>
of leisure and tranquillity; his hours, according to the demands of pleasure or reason, were accu∣rately distributed by a water-clock; and this ava∣rice of time may be allowed to prove the sense which Maximus entertained of his own happiness. The injury which he received from the emperor Valentinian, appears to excuse the most bloody revenge. Yet a philosopher might have reflected, that, if the resistance of his wife had been sincere, her chastity was still inviolate, and that it could never be restored if she had consented to the will of the adulterer. A patriot would have hesitated, before he plunged himself and his country into those inevitable calamities, which must follow the extinction of the royal house of Theodosius. The imprudent Maximus disregarded these salu∣tary considerations: he gratified his resentment and ambition; he saw the bleeding corpse of Va∣lentinian at his feet; and he heard himself sa∣luted emperor by the unanimous voice of the se∣nate and people. But the day of his inaugura∣tion was the last day of his happiness. He was imprisoned (such is the lively expression of Si∣donius) in the palace; and after passing a sleep∣less night he sighed, that he had attained the sum∣mit of his wishes, and aspired only to descend from the dangerous elevation. Oppressed by the weight of the diadem, he communicated his anxious thoughts to his friend and quaestor Ful∣gentius; and when he looked back with unavail∣ing regret on the secure pleasures of his former life, the emperor exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"O fortunate Da∣mocles <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><L>Districtus ensis cui super impiâ</L>

<P>The reign of Maximus continued about three <NOTE PLACE="marg">His death, A. D. 455. June 12.</NOTE> months. His hours, of which he had lost the command, were disturbed by remorse, or guilt, or terror, and his throne was shaken by the sedi∣tions of the soldiers, the people, and the con∣federate Barbarians. The marriage of his son Palladius with the eldest daughter of the late em∣peror, might tend to establish the hereditary suc∣cession of his family; but the violence which he offered to the empress Eudoxia, could proceed only from the blind impulse of lust or revenge. His own wife, the cause of these tragic events, had been seasonably removed by death; and the widow of Valentinian was compelled to violate her decent mourning, perhaps her real grief, and to submit to the embraces of a presumptuous usurper, whom she suspected as the assassin of her deceased husband. These suspicions were soon justified by the indiscreet confession of Maximus himself; and he wantonly provoked the hatred of his reluctant bride, who was still conscious that she descended from a line of emperors. From
<PB N="150" REF="159"/>
the East, however, Eudoxia could not hope to obtain any effectual assistance: her father and her aunt Pulcheria were dead; her mother lan∣guished at Jerusalem in disgrace and exile; and the sceptre of Constantinople was in the hands of a stranger. She directed her eyes towards Car∣thage; secretly implored the aid of the king of the Vandals; and persuaded Genseric to improve the fair opportunity of disguising his rapacious designs by the specious names of honour, justice, and compassion <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Notwithstanding the evidence of Procopius, Evagrius, Idatius, Marcellinus, &amp;c. the learned Muratori (Annali d'Italia, tom. iv. p. 249.) doubts the reality of this invitation, and observes, with great truth, "Non si può dir quanto sia facile il popolo a sognare e "spacciar voci false." But his argument, from the interval of time and place, is extremely feeble. The figs which grew near Carthage were produced to the senate of Rome on the third day.</NOTE>. Whatever abilities Maximus might have shewn in a subordinate station, he was found incapable of administering an empire; and though he might easily have been informed of the naval preparations, which were made on the opposite shores of Africa, he expected with su∣pine indifference the approach of the enemy, without adopting any measures of defence, of ne∣gociation, or of a timely retreat. When the Van∣dals disembarked at the mouth of the Tyber, the emperor was suddenly roused from his lethargy by the clamours of a trembling and exasperated multitude.

But Rome, and its inhabitants, were
<PB N="152" REF="161"/>
delivered to the licentiousness of the Vandals and Moors, whose blind passions revenged the injuries of Carthage. The pillage lasted fourteen days and nights; and all that yet remained of public or private wealth, of sacred or profane treasure, was diligently transported to the vessels of Gen∣seric. Among the spoils, the splendid relics of two temples, or rather of two religions, exhibited a memorable example of the vicissitude of human and divine things.

These ancient monuments might attract the notice of curiosity, as well as of avarice. But the Christian churches, enriched and adorned by the prevailing supersti∣tion of the times, afforded more plentiful mate∣rials for sacrilege; and the pious liberality of pope Leo, who melted six silver vases, the gift of Constantine, each of an hundred pounds weight, is an evidence of the damage which he attempted to repair. In the forty-five years, that had elapsed since the Gothic invasion, the pomp and luxury of Rome were in some measure restored; and it was difficult either to escape, or to satisfy, the avarice of a conqueror, who possessed leisure to collect, and ships to transport, the wealth of the capital. The imperial ornaments of the palace, the mag∣nificent furniture and wardrobe, the sideboards of massy plate, were accumulated with disorderly ra∣pine: the gold and silver amounted to several thousand talents; yet even the brass and copper were laboriously removed. Eudoxia herself, who advanced to meet her friend and deliverer, soon bewailed the imprudence of her own conduct. She was rudely stripped of her jewels; and the unfortunate empress, with her two daughters, the only surviving remains of the great Theodosius, was compelled, as a captive, to follow the haughty Vandal; who immediately hoisted sail, and re∣turned with a prosperous navigation to the port

The season was now approaching, in which the annual assembly of the seven provinces was held at Arles; their deliberations might perhaps be in∣fluenced by the presence of Theodoric, and his martial brothers; but their choice would naturally incline to the most illustrious of their countrymen. Avitus, after a decent resistance, accepted the Imperial diadem from the representatives of Gaul; and his election was ratified by the acclamations of the Barbarians and provincials. The formal consent of Marcian, emperor of the East, was so∣licited and obtained: but the senate, Rome, and

Such a crime might not be incompatible with the virtues of a Barba∣rian; but the manners of Theodoric were gentle and humane; and posterity may contemplate with∣out terror the original picture of a Gothic king, whom Sidonius had intimately observed, in the hours of peace and of social intercourse. In an epistle, dated from the court of Thoulouse, the orator satisfies the curiosity of one of his friends, in the following description <NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">This elaborate description (l. i. ep. ii. p. 2—7.) was dictated by some political motive.

If you examine his countenance, you will dis∣tinguish a high forehead, large shaggy eye∣brows, an aquiline nose, thin lips, a regular set of white teeth, and a fair complexion, that blushes more frequently from modesty than from anger. The ordinary distribution of his time, as far as it is exposed to the public view, may be concisely represented. Before day∣break, he repairs, with a small train, to his domestic chapel, where the service is performed by the Arian clergy; but those who presume to interpret his secret sentiments, consider this assiduous devotion as the effect of habit and po∣licy. The rest of the morning is employed in the administration of his kingdom. His chair is surrounded by some military officers of decent aspect and behaviour: the noisy crowd of his Barbarian guards occupies the hall of audience; but they are not permitted to stand within the veils or curtains, that conceal the council∣chamber from vulgar eyes. The ambassadors of the nations are successively introduced: Theo∣doric listens with attention, answers them with discreet brevity, and either announces or de∣lays, according to the nature of their busi∣ness, his final resolution. About eight (the second hour) he rises from his throne, and visits,
<PB N="160" REF="169"/>
either his treasury, or his stables. If he chuses to hunt, or at least to exercise himself on horse∣back, his bow is carried by a favourite youth; but when the game is marked, he bends it with his own hand, and seldom misses the object of his aim: as a king, he disdains to bear arms in such ignoble warfare; but as a soldier, he would blush to accept any military service which he could perform himself. On common days, his dinner is not different from the repast of a private citizen; but every Saturday many ho∣nourable guests are invited to the royal table, which, on these occasions, is served with the elegance of Greece, the plenty of Gaul, and the order and diligence of Italy <NOTE N="19" PLACE="foot">Videas ibi elegantiam Graecam, abundantiam Gallicanam; ce∣leritatem Italam; publicam pompam, privatam diligentiam, regiam disciplinam.</NOTE>. The gold or silver plate is less remarkable for its weight, than for the brightness and curious workman∣ship: the taste is gratified without the help of foreign and costly luxury; the size and number of the cups of wine are regulated with a strict regard to the laws of temperance; and the re∣spectful silence that prevails, is interrupted only by grave and instructive conversation. After dinner, Theodoric sometimes indulges himself in a short slumber; and as soon as he wakes, he calls for the dice and tables, encourages his friends to forget the royal majesty, and is de∣lighted when they freely express the passions, which are excited by the incidents of play. At this game, which he loves as the image of war,
<PB N="161" REF="170"/>
he alternately displays his eagerness, his skill, his patience, and his cheerful temper. If he loses, he laughs; he is modest and silent, if he wins. Yet, notwithstanding this seeming indif∣ference, his courtiers chuse to solicit any fa∣vour in the moments of victory; and I myself, in my applications to the king, have derived some benefit from my losses <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">Tunc etiam ego aliquid obsecraturus feliciter vincor, et mihi tabula perit ut causa salvetur.

The exploits of Theodoric soon con∣vinced the world, that he had not degenerated from the warlike virtues of his ancestors. After the establishment of the Goths in Aquitain, and the passage of the Vandals into Africa, the Suevi, who had fixed their kingdom in Gallicia, aspired to the conquest of Spain, and threatened to extinguish the feeble remains of the Roman dominion. The provincials of Carthagena and Tarragona, afflicted by an hostile invasion, repre∣sented their injuries and their apprehensions. Count Fronto was dispatched, in the name of the emperor Avitus, with advantageous offers of peace and alliance; and Theodoric interposed his weighty mediation, to declare, that, unless his bro∣ther-in-law, the king of the Suevi, immediately retired, he should be obliged to arm in the cause of justice and of Rome. <Q REND="inline">"Tell him," replied the haughty Rechiarius, "that I despise his friend∣ship and his arms; but that I shall soon try, whether he will dare to expect my arrival under the walls of Thoulouse."</Q> Such a challenge urged Theodoric to prevent the bold designs of his enemy: he passed the Pyrenees at the head of the Visigoths: the Franks and Burgundians served under his standard; and though he professed him∣self the dutiful servant of Avitus, he privately stipulated, for himself and his successors, the ab∣solute
<PB N="163" REF="172"/>
possession of his Spanish conquests. The two armies, or rather the two nations, encoun∣tered each other on the banks of the river Urbi∣cus, about twelve miles from Astorga; and the decisive victory of the Goths appeared for a while to have extirpated the name and kingdom of the Suevi. From the field of battle Theodoric ad∣vanced to Braga, their metropolis, which still re∣tained the splendid vestiges of its ancient com∣merce and dignity <NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot"><P>Quaeque sinû pelagi jactat se Bracara dives.</P>

<P>From the design of the king of the Suevi, it is evident that the navi∣gation from the ports of Gallicia to the Mediterranean was known and practised. The ships of Bracara, or Braga, cautiously steered along the coast, without daring to lose themselves in the Atlantic.</P></NOTE>. His entrance was not pol∣luted with blood, and the Goths respected the chastity of their female captives, more especially of the consecrated virgins: but the greatest part of the clergy and people were made slaves, and even the churches and altars were confounded in the universal pillage. The unfortunate king of the Suevi had escaped to one of the ports of the ocean; but the obstinacy of the winds opposed his flight; he was delivered to his implacable rival; and Rechiarius, who neither desired nor expected mercy, received, with manly constancy, the death which he would probably have inflicted. After this bloody sacrifice to policy or resentment, Theodoric carried his victorious arms as far as Merida, the principal town of Lusitania, without meeting any resistance, except from the miracu∣lous powers of St. Eulalia; but he was stopped in
<PB N="164" REF="173"/>
the full career of success, and recalled from Spain, before he could provide for the security of his conquests. In his retreat towards the Pyrenees, he revenged his disappointment on the country through which he passed, and in the sack of Pol∣lentia and Astorga, he shewed himself a faithless ally, as well as a cruel enemy. Whilst the king of the Visigoths fought and vanquished in the name of Avitus, the reign of Avitus had expired; and both the honour and the interest of Theodoric were deeply wounded by the disgrace of a friend, whom he had seated on the throne of the Western empire <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">This Suevic was is the most authentic part of the Chronicle of Idatius, who, as bishop of Iria Flavia, was himself a spectator and a sufferer.

The poet, if we may degrade that sacred name, exag∣gerates the merit of a sovereign and a father; and his prophecy of a long and glorious reign was

soon contradicted by the event. Avitus, at a time when the Imperial dignity was reduced to a pre∣eminence of toil and danger, indulged himself in the pleasures of Italian luxury: age had not ex∣tinguished his amorous inclinations; and he is accused of insulting, with indiscreet and ungene∣rous raillery, the husbands whose wives he had seduced or violated <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">Luxuriose agere volens a senatoribus projectus est, is the con∣cise expression of Gregory of Tours (l. ii. c. xi. in tom. ii. p. 168.)

But the Romans were not inclined, either to excuse his faults, or to ac∣knowledge his virtues. The several parts of the empire became every day more alienated from each other; and the stranger of Gaul was the ob∣ject of popular hatred and contempt. The senate asserted their legitimate claim in the election of an emperor; and their authority, which had been originally derived from the old constitution, was again fortified by the actual weakness of a declin∣ing monarchy. Yet even such a monarchy might have resisted the votes of an unarmed senate, if their discontent had not been supported, or per∣haps inflamed, by Count Ricimer, one of the principal commanders of the Barbarian troops, who formed the military defence of Italy.

It has more art than genius, and more labour than art. The ornaments are false or tri∣vial; the expression is feeble and prolix: and Sidonius wants the skill to exhibit the principal figure in a strong and distinct light. The private life of Majorian occupies about two hundred lines, 107—305.</NOTE>. Majorian derived his name from his maternal grandfather, who, in the reign of the great Theo∣dosius, had commanded the troops of the Illyrian frontier. He gave his daughter in marriage to the father of Majorian, a respectable officer, who administered the revenues of Gaul with skill and integrity; and generously preferred the friendship of Aetius, to the tempting offers of an insidious court. His son, the future emperor, who was educated in the profession of arms, displayed, from his early youth, intrepid courage, premature
<PB N="169" REF="178"/>
wisdom, and unbounded liberality in a scanty fortune. He followed the standard of Aetius, contributed to his success, shared, and sometimes eclipsed, his glory, and at last excited the jea∣lousy of the patrician, or rather of his wife, who forced him to retire from the service <NOTE N="34" PLACE="foot">She pressed his immediate death, and was scarcely satisfied with his disgrace. It should seem, that Aetius, like Belisarius and Marlborough, was governed by his wife; whose fervent piety, though it might work miracles (Gregor. Turon. l. ii. c. 7. p. 162.) was not incompatible with base and sanguinary counsels.</NOTE>. Majo∣rian, after the death of Aetius, was recalled, and promoted; and his intimate connection with count Ricimer, was the immediate step by which he ascended the throne of the Western empire. During the vacancy that succeeded the abdication of Avitus, the ambitious Barbarian, whose birth excluded him from the Imperial dignity, govern∣ed Italy, with the title of Patrician; resigned, to his friend, the conspicuous station of master∣general of the cavalry and infantry; and, after an interval of some months, consented to the unanimous wish of the Romans, whose favour Majorian had solicited by a recent victory over the Alemanni <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">The Alemanni had passed the Rhaetian Alps, and were deseat∣ed in the <HI>Campi Canini,</HI> or Valley of Bellinzone, through which the Tesin flows, in its descent from mount Adula, to the Lago Mag∣giore (Cluver.

<P>The private and public actions of Majorian <NOTE PLACE="marg">His salu∣tary laws, A. D. 457—461.</NOTE> are very imperfectly known: but his laws, re∣markable for an original cast of thought and expression, faithfully represent the character of a sovereign, who loved his people, who sympathized in their distress, who had studied the causes of the decline of the empire, and who was capable of applying, (as far as such reformation was
<PB N="172" REF="181"/>
practicable) judicious and effectual remedies to the public disorders <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">See the laws of Majorian (they are only nine in number, but very long and various), at the end of the Theodosian Code, Novell. l. iv. p. 32—37. Godefroy has not given any commentary on these additional pieces.</NOTE>. His regulations concern∣ing the finances manifestly tended to remove, or at least to mitigate, the most intolerable griev∣ances. I. From the first hour of his reign, he was solicitous. (I translate his own words) to re∣lieve the <HI>weary</HI> fortunes of the provincials, op∣pressed by the accumulated weight of indictions and superindictions <NOTE N="41" PLACE="foot">Fessas provincialium variâ atque multiplici tributorum exactione fortunas, et extraordinariis fiscalium solutionum oneribus attritas, &amp;c. Novell. Majorian, tit. iv. p. 34.</NOTE>. With this view, he grant∣ed an universal amnesty, a final and absolute dis∣charge of all arrears of tribute, of all debts, which, under any pretence, the fiscal officers might demand from the people. This wise dere∣liction of obsolete, vexatious, and unprofitable claims, improved and purified the sources of the public revenue; and the subject, who could now look back without despair, might labour with hope and gratitude for himself and for his coun∣try. II. In the assessment and collection of taxes Majorian restored the ordinary jurisdiction of the provincial magistrates; and suppressed the extra∣ordinary commissions which had been introduced, in the name of the emperor himself, or of the Praetorian praefects. The favourite servants, who obtained such irregular powers, were insolent in their behaviour, and arbitrary in their demands: they affected to despise the subordinate tribunals,
<PB N="173" REF="182"/>
and they were discontented, if their fees and pro∣fits did not twice exceed the sum which they condescended to pay into the treasury. One in∣stance of their extortion would appear incredible, were it not authenticated by the legislator him∣self. They exacted the whole payment in gold: but they refused the current coin of the empire, and would accept only such ancient pieces as were stamped with the names of Faustina or the Antonines. The subject, who was unprovided with these curious medals, had recourse to the expedient of compounding with their rapacious demands; or, if he succeeded in the research, his imposition was doubled, according to the weight and value of the money of former times <NOTE N="42" PLACE="foot">The learned Greaves (vol. i. p. 329, 330, 331.) has found, by a diligent inquiry, that <HI>aurei</HI> of the Antonines weighed one hundred and eighteen, and those of the fifth century only sixty-eight, English grains. Majorian gives currency to all gold coin, excepting only the <HI>Gallic solidus,</HI> from its deficiency, not in the weight, but in the stan∣dard.</NOTE>. III. <Q REND="inline">"The municipal corporations (says the em∣peror), the lesser senates (so antiquity has justly styled them), deserve to be considered as the heart of the cities, and the sinews of the repub∣lic. And yet so low are they now reduced, by the injustice of magistrates, and the venality of collectors, that many of their members, re∣nouncing their dignity and their country, have taken refuge in distant and obscure exile."</Q> He urges, and even compels, their return to their respective cities; but he removes the griev∣ance which had forced them to desert the exercise
<PB N="174" REF="183"/>
of their municipal functions. They are directed, under the authority of the provincial magistrates, to resume their office of levying the tribute; but, instead of being made responsible for the whole sum assessed on their district, they are only requir∣ed to produce a regular account of the payments which they have actually received, and of the defaulters who are still indebted to the public. IV. But Majorian was not ignorant, that these corporate bodies were too much inclined to re∣taliate the injustice and oppression which they had suffered; and he therefore revives the useful office of the <HI>defenders of cities.</HI> He exhorts the people to elect, in a full and free assembly, some man of discretion and integrity, who would dare to assert their privileges, to represent their griev∣ances, to protect the poor from the tyranny of the rich, and to inform the emperor of the abuses that were committed under the sanction of his name and authority.</P>
<P>The spectator, who casts a mournful view over <NOTE PLACE="marg">The edi∣fices of Rome.</NOTE> the ruins of ancient Rome, is tempted to accuse the memory of the Goths and Vandals, for the mischief which they had neither leisure, nor power, nor perhaps inclination, to perpetrate. The tempest of war might strike some lofty tur∣rets to the ground; but the destruction which un∣dermined the foundations of those massy fabrics, was prosecuted, slowly and silently, during a period of ten centuries; and the motives of in∣terest, that afterwards operated without shame or controul, were severely checked by the taste and spirit of the emperor Majorian. The decay of
<PB N="175" REF="184"/>
the city had gradually impaired the value of the public works. The circus and theatres might still excite, but they seldom gratified, the desires of the people: the temples, which had escaped the zeal of the Christians, were no longer inha∣bited either by gods or men; the diminished crowds of the Romans were lost in the immense space of their baths and porticoes; and the stately libraries and halls of justice became use∣less to an indolent generation, whose repose was seldom disturbed, either by study, or business. The monuments of consular, or Imperial, great∣ness were no longer revered, as the immortal glory of the capital; they were only esteemed as an inexhaustible mine of materials, cheaper, and more convenient, than the distant quarry. Specious petitions were continually addressed to the easy magistrates of Rome, which stated the want of stones or bricks for some necessary ser∣vice: the fairest forms of architecture were rudely defaced for the sake of some paltry, or pretended, repairs; and the degenerate Romans, who convert∣ed the spoil to their own emolument, demolished, with sacrilegious hands, the labours of their an∣cestors. Majorian, who had often sighed over the desolation of the city, applied a severe re∣medy to the growing evil <NOTE N="43" PLACE="foot">The whole edict (Novell. Majorian. tit. vi. p. 35.) is curious. <Q>Antiquarum aedium dissipatur speciosa constructio; et ut aliquid reparetur, magna diruuntur. Hinc jam occasio nascitur, ut etiam unusquisque privatum aedificium construens, per gratiam judi∣cum . . . . praesumere de publicis locis necessaria, et transferre non dubitet, &amp;c.</Q> With equal zeal, but with less power, Pe∣trarch, in the fourteenth century, repeated the same complaints (Vie de Petrarque, tom. i. p. 326, 327.). If I prosecute this History, I shall not be unmindful of the decline and fall of the <HI>city</HI> of Rome; an interesting object, to which my plan was originally consined.</NOTE> He reserved to
<PB N="176" REF="185"/>
the prince and senate the sole congnisance of the extreme cases which might justify the destruc∣tion of an ancient edifice; imposed a fine of fifty pounds of gold (two thousand pounds sterling), on every magistrate, who should presume to grant such illegal and scandalous licence; and threaten∣ed to chastise the criminal obedience of their subordinate officers, by a severe whipping, and the amputation of both their hands. In the last instance, the legislator might seem to forget the proportion of guilt and punishment; but his zeal arose from a generous principle, and Majorian was anxious to protect the monuments of those ages, in which he would have desired and deserved to live. The emperor conceived, that it was his interest to increase the number of his subjects; that it was his duty to guard the purity of the marriage-bed: but the means which he employed to accomplish these salutary purposes, are of an ambiguous, and perhaps exceptionable, kind. The pious maids, who consecrated their virginity to Christ, were restrained from taking the veil, till they had reached their fortieth year. Windows under that age were compelled to form a second alliance within the term of five years, by the for∣feiture of half their wealth to their nearest rela∣tions, or to the state. Unequal marriages were condemned or annulled. The punishment of confiscation and exile was deemed so inadequate
<PB N="177" REF="186"/>
to the guilt of adultery, that, if the criminal returned to Italy, he might, by the express de∣claration of Majorian, be slain with impunity <NOTE N="44" PLACE="foot">The emperor chides the lenity of Rogatian, consular of Tus∣cany, in a style of acrimonious reproof, which sounds almost like personal resentment (Novell. tit. ix. p. 37.). The law of Majo∣rian, which punished obstinate widows, was soon afterwards repealed by his successor Severus (Novell. Sever. tit. i. p. 37.).</NOTE>.</P>
<P>While the emperor Majorian assiduously la∣boured <NOTE PLACE="marg">Majorian prepares to invade Africa, A. D. 457.</NOTE> to restore the happiness and virtue of the Romans, he encountered the arms of Genseric, from his character and situation, their most for∣midable enemy. A fleet of Vandals and Moors landed at the mouth of the Liris, or Garigliano: but the Imperial troops surprised and attacked the disorderly Barbarians, who were encumbered with the spoils of Campania; they were chaced with slaughter to their ships, and their leader, the king's brother-in-law, was found in the num∣ber of the slain <NOTE N="45" PLACE="foot">Sidon. Panegyr. Majorian. 385—440.</NOTE>. Such vigilance might an∣nounce the character of the new reign; but the strictest vigilance, and the most numerous forces, were insufficient to protect the long-extended coast of Italy, from the depredations of a naval war. The public opinion had imposed a nobler and more arduous task on the genius of Majo∣rian. Rome expected from him alone the resti∣tution of Africa; and the design, which he form∣ed, of attacking the Vandals in their new settle∣ments, was the result of bold and judicious po∣licy. If the intrepid emperor could have infused his own spirit into the youth of Italy; if he could
<PB N="178" REF="187"/>
have revived, in the field of Mars, the manly exercises in which he had always surpassed his equals; he might have marched against Genseric at the head of a <HI>Roman</HI> army. Such a reforma∣tion of national manners might be embraced by the rising generation; but it is the misfortune of those princes who laboriously sustain a declining monarchy, that, to obtain some immediate ad∣vantage, or to avert some impending danger, they are forced to countenance, and even to mul∣tiply, the most pernicious abuses. Majorian, like the weakest of his predecessors, was reduced to the disgraceful expedient of substituting Bar∣barian auxiliaries in the place of his unwarlike subjects: and his superior abilities could only be displayed in the vigour and dexterity with which he wielded a dangerous instrument, so apt to recoil on the hand that used it. Besides the con∣federates, who were already engaged in the ser∣vice of the empire, the fame of his liberality and valour attracted the nations of the Danube, the Borysthenes, and perhaps of the Tanais. Many thousands of the bravest subjects of Attila, the Gepidae, the Ostrogoths, the Rugians, the Bur∣gundians, the Suevi, the Alani, assembled in the plains of Liguria; and their formidable strength was balanced by their mutual animosities <NOTE N="46" PLACE="foot">The review of the army; and passage of the Alps, contain the most tolerable passages of the Panegyric (470—552.).

The citizens of Lyons had presumed to shut their gates: they soon im∣plored, and experienced, the clemency of Majo∣rian. He vanquished Theodoric in the field; and admitted to his friendship and alliance, a king whom he had found not unworthy of his arms. The beneficial, though precarious, re∣union of the greatest part of Gaul and Spain, was the effect of persuasion, as well as of force <NOTE N="47" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is the just and forcible distinction of Priscus (Excerpt. Legat. p. 42.) in a short fragment, which throws much light on the history of Majorian. Jornandes has suppressed the defeat and alliance of the Visigoths, which were solemnly proclaimed in Galicia; and are marked in the Chronicle of Idatius.</NOTE>; and the independent Bagaudae, who had escaped, or resisted, the oppression of former reigns, were disposed to confide in the virtues of Majorian. His camp was filled with Barbarian allies; his throne was supported by the zeal of an affectinate people; but the emperor had foreseen, that it was impossible, without a maritime power, to atchieve the conquest of Africa. In the first Pu∣nic war, the republic had exerted such incre∣dible diligence, that, within sixty days after the first stroke of the axe had been given in the forest, a fleet of one hundred and sixty gallies proudly rode at anchor in the sea <NOTE N="48" PLACE="foot">Florus, l. ii: c. 2.

Under circumstances
<PB N="180" REF="189"/>
much less favourable, Majorian equalled the spi∣rit and perseverance of the ancient Romans. The woods of the Apennine were felled; the arsenals and manufactures of Ravenna and Mise∣num were restored; Italy and Gaul vied with each other in liberal contributions to the public service; and the Imperial navy of three hundred large gallies, with an adequate proportion of transports and smaller vessels, was collected in the secure and capacious harbour of Carthagena in Spain <NOTE N="49" PLACE="foot"><L>Interea duplici texis dum littore classem</L>

The intrepid countenance of Ma∣jorian animated his troops with a confidence of victory; and if we might credit the historian Procopius, his courage sometimes hurried him beyond the bounds of prudence. Anxious to explore, with his own eyes, the state of the Van∣dals, he ventured, after disguising the colour of his hair, to visit Carthage, in the character of his own ambassador: and Genseric was after∣wards mortified by the discovery, that he had entertained and dismissed the emperor of the Romans.

Guided by their secret intelligence, he surprised the unguarded

After this event, the behaviour of the two antagonists shewed them superior to their fortune. The Vandal, instead of being elated by this accidental victory, immediately renewed his solicitations for peace. The emperor of the West, who was capable of forming great designs, and of supporting heavy disappointments, consented to a treaty, or rather to a suspension of arms; in the full assurance that, before he could restore his navy, he should be supplied with provocations to justify a second war. Majorian returned to Italy, to prosecute his labours for the public happiness; and, as he was conscious of his own integrity, he might long remain ignorant of the dark conspi∣racy which threatened his throne and his life. The recent misfortune of Carthagena sullied the glory which had dazzled the eyes of the multi∣tude; almost every description of civil and mili∣tary officers were exasperated against the Re∣former, since they all derived some advantage from the abuses which he endeavoured to sup∣press; and the patrician Rieimer impelled the inconstant passions of the Barbarians against a prince whom he esteemed and hated.

During that period the government was in the hands of Ricimer alone; and although the modest Barbarian disclaimed the name of king, he accumulated treasures, formed a separate army, negociated private alliances, and ruled Italy with the same independent and despotic authority, which was afterwards exercised by Odoacer and Theodoric. But his dominions were bounded by the Alps; and two Roman ge∣nerals, Marcellinus and Aegidius, maintained their allegiance to the Republic, by rejecting, with disdain, the phantom which he styled an emperor. Marcellinus still adhered to the old <NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of Marcelli∣nus in Dalmatia,</NOTE> religion; and the devout Pagans, who secretly disobeyed the laws of the church and state, ap∣plauded his profound skill in the science of divination.

His voluntary, or reluctant, submission, to the authority of Majorian, was rewarded by the government of Sicily, and the command of an army, stationed in that island to oppose, or to attack, the Vandals; but his Barbarian merce∣naries, after the emperor's death, were tempted to revolt by the artful liberality of Ricimer. At the head of a band of faithful followers, the intrepid Marcellinus occupied the province of Dalmatia, assumed the title of patrician of the West, secured the love of his subjects by a mild and equitable reign, built a fleet, which claimed the dominion of the Hadriatic, and alternately alarmed the coasts of Italy and of Africa <NOTE N="59" PLACE="foot">Procopius de Bell.

The Franks, who had punished with exile the youthful follies of Childeric, elected the Roman general for their king; his vanity, rather than his ambition, was gratified by that singular ho∣nour; and when the nation, at the end of four years, repented of the injury which they had offered to the Merovingian family, he patiently acquiesced in the restoration of the lawful prince.

<L>—Hinc Vandalus hostis</L>
<L>Urget; et in nostrum numerosâ classe quotannis</L>
<L>Militat excidium; conversoque ordine Fati</L>
<L>Torrida Caucaseos infert mihi Byrsa furores.</L></NOTE>. In the spring of each year, they equipped a for∣midable navy in the port of Carthage; and Gen∣seric himself, though in a very advanced age, still commanded in person the most important expe∣ditions. His designs were concealed with im∣penetrable secrecy, till the moment that he hoisted sail. When he was asked by his pilot, what course he should steer; <Q REND="inline">"Leave the deter∣mination to the winds (replied the Barbarian, with pious arrogance); <HI>they</HI> will transport us to the guilty coast, whose inhabitants have provoked the divine justice:"</Q> but if Genseric himself deigned to issue more precise orders, he judged the most wealthy to be the most criminal. The Vandals repeatedly visited the coasts of Spain, Liguria, Tuscany, Campania, Lucania, Bruttium, Apulia, Calabria, Venetia, Dalmatia, Epirus, Greece, and Sicily: they were tempted to subdue the island of Sardinia, so advantage∣ously placed in the centre of the Mediterranean;
<PB N="188" REF="197"/>
and their arms spread desolation, or terror, from the columns of Hercules to the mouth of the Nile. As they were more ambitious of spoil than of glory, they seldom attacked any fortified cities, or engaged any regular troops in the open field. But the celerity of their motions enabled them, almost at the same time, to threaten and to attack the most distant objects, which at∣tracted their desires; and as they always em∣barked a sufficient number of horses, they had no sooner landed, than they swept the dismayed country with a body of light cavalry. Yet, not∣withstanding the example of their king, the native Vandals and Alani insensibly declined this toilsome and perilous warfare; the hardy gene∣ration of the first conquerors was almost extin∣guished, and their sons, who were born in Africa, enjoyed the delicious baths and gardens which had been acquired by the valour of their fathers. Their place was readily supplied by a various multitude of Moors and Romans, of captives and outlaws; and those desperate wretches, who had already violated the laws of their country, were the most eager to promote the atrocious acts which disgrace the victories of Genseric. In the treatment of his unhappy pri∣soners, he sometimes consulted his avarice, and sometimes indulged his cruelty; and the massacre of five hundred noble citizens of Zant or Za∣cynthus, whose mangled bodies he cast into the Ionian sea, was imputed, by the public indig∣nation, to his latest posterity.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="198"/>
Such crimes could not be excused by any pro∣vocations; but the war, which the king of the Vandals prosecuted against the Roman empire, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Negocia∣tions with the Eastern empire, A. D. 462, &amp;c.</NOTE> was justified by a specious and reasonable motive. The widow of Valentinian, Eudoxia, whom he had led captive from Rome to Carthage, was the sole heiress of the Theodosian house; her elder daughter, Eudocia, became the reluctant wife of Hunneric, his eldest son; and the stern father, asserting a legal claim, which could not easily be refuted or satisfied, demanded a just proportion of the Imperial patrimony. An adequate, or at least a valuable, compensation, was offered by the Eastern emperor, to purchase a necessary peace. Eudoxia and her younger daughter, Pla∣cidia, were honourably restored, and the fury of the Vandals was confined to the limits of the Western empire. The Italians, destitute of a naval force, which alone was capable of protect∣ing their coasts, implored the aid of the more fortunate nations of the East; who had formerly acknowledged, in peace and war, the supremacy of Rome. But the perpetual division of the two empires had alienated their interest and their in∣clinations; the faith of a recent treaty was alleged; and the Western Romans, instead of arms and ships, could only obtain the assistance of a cold and ineffectual mediation. The haughty Ricimer, who had long struggled with the diffi∣culties of his situation, was at length reduced to address the throne of Constantinople, in the humble language of a subject; and Italy sub∣mitted,

<P>Since the death of the younger Theodosius, the domestic repose of Constantinople had never been <NOTE PLACE="marg">Leo, em∣peror of the East, A. D. 457—474.</NOTE> interrupted by war or faction.

to the prosperity of his own dominions, Marcian seemed to behold, with indifference, the misfor∣tunes of Rome; and the obstinate refusal of a a brave and active prince, to draw his sword against the Vandals, was ascribed to a secret pro∣mise, which had formerly been exacted from him when he was a captive in the power of Gense∣ric <NOTE N="66" PLACE="foot">See Procopius de Bell. Vandal. l. i. c. 4. p. 185.</NOTE>. The death of Marcian, after a reign of seven years, would have exposed the East to the danger of a popular election; if the superior weight of a single family, had not been able to incline the balance in favour of the candidate whose interest they supported. The patrician Aspar might have placed the diadem on his own head; if he would have subscribed the Nicene creed <NOTE N="67" PLACE="foot">From this disability of Aspar to acend the throne, it may be inferred that the stain of <HI>Heresy</HI> was perpetual and indelible, while that of <HI>Barbarism</HI> disappeared in the second generation.</NOTE>. During three generations, the armies of the East were successively commanded by his father, by himself, and by his son Ardaburius: his Barbarian guards formed a military force that overawed the palace and the capital; and the liberal distribution of his immense treasures, rendered Aspar as popular, as he was powerful. He recommended the obscure name of Leo of Thrace, a military tribune, and the principal steward of his household. His nomination was unanimously ratified by the senate; and the ser∣vant of Aspar received the Imperial crown from the hands of the patriarch, or bishop, who was permitted to express, by this unusual ceremony,

the suffrage of the Deity <NOTE N="68" PLACE="foot">Theophanes, p. 95. This appears to be the first origin of a ceremony, which all the Christian princes of the world have since adopted; and from which the clergy have deduced the most formid∣able consequences.</NOTE>. This emperor, the first of the name of Leo, has been distinguished by the title of the <HI>Great;</HI> from a succession of princes, who gradually fixed, in the opinion of the Greeks, a very humble standard of heroic, or at least of royal, perfection. Yet the temperate firmness with which Leo resisted the oppression of his benefactor, shewed that he was conscious of his duty and of his prerogative. Aspar was asto∣nished to find that his influence could no longer appoint a praefect of Constantinople: he pre∣sumed to reproach his sovereign with a breach of promise, and insolently shaking his purple, <Q REND="inline">"It is not proper (said he), that the man who is invested with this garment, should be guilty of lying."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Nor is it proper (replied Leo), that a prince should be compelled to resign his own judgment, and the public interest, to the will of a subject <NOTE N="69" PLACE="foot">Cedrenus (p. 345, 346.), who was conversant with the wri∣ters of better days, has preserved the remarkable words of Aspar, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>."</Q> After this extraor∣dinary scene, it was impossible that the reconci∣liation of the emperor and the patrician could be sincere; or, at least, that it could be solid and permanent.

while Leo undermined the authority, and pre∣pared the disgrace, of the family of Aspar, his mild and cautious behaviour restrained them from any rash and desperate attempts, which might have been fatal to themselves, or their enemies. The measures of peace and war were affected by this internal revolution. As long as Aspar degraded the majesty of the throne, the secret correspondence of religion and interest en∣gaged him to favour the cause of Genseric. When Leo had delivered himself from that ig∣nominious servitude, he listened to the com∣plaints of the Italians; resolved to extirpate the tyranny of the Vandals; and declared his alliance with his colleague, Anthemius, whom he so∣lemnly invested with the diadem and purple of the West.</P>
<P>The virtues of Anthemius have perhaps been <NOTE PLACE="marg">Anthe∣mius em∣peror of the West, A.

But the merit of his immediate parents, their honours, and their riches, rendered Anthemius one of the most illustrious subjects of the East.

The grandson of the praefect was raised above the condition of a pri∣vate subject, by his marriage with Euphemia, the daughter of the emperor Marcian. This splen∣did alliance, which might supersede the necessity of merit, hastened the promotion of Anthemius to the successive dignities of count, of master-general, of consul, and of patrician; and his merit or fortune claimed the honours of a victory, which was obtained on the banks of the Danube, over the Huns. Without indulging an extrava∣gant ambition, the son-in-law of Marcian might hope to be his successor; but Anthemius supported the disappointment with courage and patience; and his subsequent elevation was universally ap∣proved by the public, who esteemed him worthy to reign, till he ascended the throne <NOTE N="72" PLACE="foot">Sidonius discovers, with tolerable ingenuity, that this disap∣pointment added new lustre to the virtues of Anthemius (210, &amp;c.), who declined one sceptre, and reluctantly accepted another (22, &amp;c.).</NOTE>.

The wealth of two empires was osten∣tatiously displayed; and many senators completed their ruin by an expensive effort to disguise their poverty. All serious business was suspended du∣ring this festival; the courts of justice were shut; the streets of Rome, the theatres, the places of public and private resort, resounded with hyme∣naeal songs and dances; and the royal bride, clothed in silken robes, with a crown on her head, was conducted to the palace of Ricimer, who had changed his military dress for the habit of a consul and a senator. On this memorable occasion, Sidonius, whose early ambition had been so fatally blasted, appeared as the orator of Au∣vergne, among the provincial deputies who ad∣dressed the throne with congratulations or com∣plaints <NOTE N="74" PLACE="foot">Interveni autem nuptiis Patricii Ricimeris, cui filia perennis Augusti in spem publicae securitatis copulabatur.

The intelligence of this loss extorted from Genseric, some insidious and ineffectual propositions of peace: but he was still more seriously alarmed by the reconciliation of Marcellinus with the two empires. The inde∣pendent patrician had been persuaded to acknow∣ledge the legitimate title of Anthemius, whom he accompanied in his journey to Rome; the Dal∣matian fleet was received into the harbours of Italy; the active valour of Marcellinus expelled the Vandals from the island of Sardinia; and the languid efforts of the West added some weight to the immense preparations of the Eastern Romans. The expence of the naval armament, which Leo sent against the Vandals, has been distinctly ascer∣tained; and the curious and instructive account displays the wealth of the declining empire. The royal demesnes, or private patrimony of the prince, supplied seventeen thousand pounds of gold; forty∣seven

thousand pounds of gold, and seven hun∣dred thousand of silver, were levied and paid into the treasury by the Praetorian praefects. But the cities were reduced to extreme poverty; and the diligent calculation of fines and forfeitures, as a valuable object of the revenue, does not suggest the idea of a just, or merciful, administration. The whole expence, by whatsoever means it was defrayed, of the African campaign, amounted to the sum of one hundred and thirty thousand pounds of gold, about five millions two hundred thousand pounds sterling, at a time when the value of money appears, from the comparative price of corn, to have been somewhat higher than in the present age <NOTE N="86" PLACE="foot">The principal sum is clearly expressed by Procopius (de Bell.

The fleet that sailed from Constantinople to Carthage, consisted of eleven hundred and thirteen ships, and the number of soldiers and mariners exceeded one hundred thousand men. Basiliscus, the brother of the empress Vorina, was entrusted with this important command. His sister, the wife of Leo, had exaggerated the merit of his former exploits against the Scythians. But the discovery of his guilt, or incapacity, was re∣served for the African war; and his friends could only save his military reputation, by asserting, that he had conspired with Aspar to spare Gen∣seric,

kingdom of the Vandals was extinguished. Gen∣seric beheld the danger with firmness, and eluded it with his veteran dexterity. He protested, in the most respectful language, that he was ready to submit his person, and his dominions, to the will of the emperor; but he requested a truce of five days to regulate the terms of his submission; and it was universally believed, that his secret libera∣lity contributed to the success of this public nego∣ciation. Instead of obstinately refusing whatever indulgence his enemy so earnestly solicited, the guilty, or the credulous, Basiliscus consented to the fatal truce; and his imprudent security seemed to proclaim, that he already considered himself as the conqueror of Africa. During this short inter∣val, the wind became favourable to the designs of Genseric. He manned his largest ships of war with the bravest of the Moors and Vandals; and they towed after them many large barks, filled with combustible materials. In the obscurity of the night, these destructive vessels were impelled against the unguarded and unsuspecting fleet of the Romans, who were awakened by the sense of their instant danger. Their close and crowded order assisted the progress of the fire, which was communicated with rapid and irresistible violence; and the noise of the wind, the crackling of the flames, the dissonant cries of the soldiers and ma∣riners, who could neither command, nor obey, increased the horror of the nocturnal tumult. Whilst they laboured to extricate themselves from the fireships, and to save at least a part of the
<PB N="204" REF="213"/>
navy, the gallies of Genseric assaulted them with temperate and disciplined valour; and many of the Romans, who escaped the fury of the flames, were destroyed or taken by the victorious Vandals. Among the events of that disastrous night, the he∣roic, or rather desperate, courage of John, one of the principal officers of Basiliscus, has rescued his name from oblivion. When the ship, which he had bravely defended, was almost consumed, he threw himself in his armour into the sea, dis∣dainfully rejected the esteem and pity of Genso, the son of Genseric, who pressed him to accept honourable quarter, and sunk under the waves; exclaiming with his last breath, that he would never fall alive into the hands of those impious dogs. Actuated by a far different spirit, Basiliscus, whose station was the most remote from danger, disgracefully fled in the beginning of the engage∣ment, returned to Constantinople with the loss of more than half of his fleet and army, and sheltered his guilty head in the sanctuary of St. Sophia, till his sister, by her tears and entreaties, could obtain his pardon from the indignant emperor. Hera∣clius effected his retreat through the desert; Mar∣cellinus retired to Sicily, where he was assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer, by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expressed his surprise and satisfaction, that the Ro∣mans themselves should remove from the world his most formidable antagonists <NOTE N="89" PLACE="foot">Damascius in Vit.

The selfish policy of Ricimer en∣couraged him to invade the provinces which were in the possession of Aegidius, his rival; but the active count, by the defence of Arles, and the victory of Orleans, saved Gaul, and checked, during his lifetime, the progress of the Visigoths. Their ambition was soon rekindled; and the de∣sign of extinguishing the Roman empire in Spain and Gaul, was conceived, and almost completed, in the reign of Euric, who assassinated his brother Theodoric, and displayed, with a more savage temper, superior abilities, both in peace and war. He passed the Pyrenees at the head of a numerous army, subdued the cities of Saragossa and Pampe∣luna, vanquished in battle the martial nobles of the Tarragonese province, carried his victorious arms into the heart of Lusitania, and permitted the Suevi to hold the kingdom of Gallicia under the Gothic monarchy of Spain <NOTE N="92" PLACE="foot">See Mariana, Hist.

<P>One of the last acts of jurisdiction, which the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of Arvandus, A.

Sidonius, who rejoices that he lived under a reign in which he might pity and assist a state-criminal, has ex∣pressed, with tenderness and freedom, the faults of his indiscreet and unfortunate friend <NOTE N="97" PLACE="foot">See Sidonius, l. i. epist. 7. p. 15—20, with Sirmond's notes.

From the perils which he had escaped, Arvandus im∣bibed confidence rather than wisdom; and such was the various, though uniform, imprudence of his behaviour, that his prosperity must appear much more surprising than his downfal. The second praefecture, which he obtained within the term of five years, abolished the merit and popu∣larity of his preceding administration. His easy
<PB N="209" REF="218"/>
temper was corrupted by flattery, and exasperated by opposition; he was forced to satisfy his im∣portunate creditors with the spoils of the pro∣vince; his capricious insolence offended the nobles of Gaul, and he sunk under the weight of the public hatred. The mandate of his disgrace summoned him to justify his conduct before the senate; and he passed the sea of Tuscany with a favourable wind, the presage, as he vainly ima∣gined, of his future fortunes. A decent respect was still observed for the <HI>Praefectorian</HI> rank; and on his arrival at Rome, Arvandus was committed to the hospitality, rather than to the custody, of Flavius Asellus, the count of the sacred largesses, who resided in the Capitol <NOTE N="98" PLACE="foot">When the Capitol ceased to be a temple, it was appropriated to the use of the civil magistrate; and it is still the residence of the Roman senator.

He was eagerly pursued by his accusers, the four deputies of Gaul, who were all distinguished by their birth, their dignities, or their eloquence. In the name of a great province, and according to the forms of Roman jurisprudence, they instituted a civil and criminal action, requiring such a restitution as might compensate the losses of individuals, and such punishment as might satisfy the justice of the state. Their charges of corrupt oppres∣sion were numerous and weighty; but they placed their secret dependence on a letter, which they had intercepted, and which they could prove, by the evidence of his secretary, to have been dic∣tated
<PB N="210" REF="219"/>
by Arvandus himself. The author of this letter seemed to dissuade the king of the Goths from a peace with the <HI>Greek</HI> emperor: he sug∣gested the attack of the Britons on the Loire; and he recommended a division of Gaul, ac∣cording to the law of nations, between the Visi∣goths and the Burgundians <NOTE N="99" PLACE="foot">Haec ad regem Gothorum, charta videbatur emitti, pacem cum Graeco Imperatore dissuadens, Britannos super Ligerim sitos impug∣nari opportere demonstrans, cum Burgundionibus jure gentium Gal∣lias dividi debere confirmans.</NOTE>. These pernicious schemes, which a friend could only palliate by the reproaches of vanity and indiscretion, were susceptible of a treasonable interpretation; and the deputies had artfully resolved, not to produce their most formidable weapons till the decisive moment of the contest. But their intentions were discovered by the zeal of Sidonius. He immediately apprised the unsuspecting criminal of his danger; and sincerely lamented, without any mixture of anger, the haughty presumption of Arvandus, who rejected, and even resented, the salutary advice of his friends. Ignorant of his real situation, Arvandus shewed himself in the Capitol in the white robe of a candidate, ac∣cepted indiscriminate salutations and offers of service, examined the shops of the merchants, the silks and gems, sometimes with the indiffe∣rence of a spectator, and sometimes with the at∣tention of a purchaser; and complained of the times, of the senate, of the prince, and of the delays of justice. His complaints were soon re∣moved.
<PB N="211" REF="220"/>
An early day was fixed for his trial; and Arvandus appeared, with his accusers, be∣fore a numerous assembly of the Roman senate. The mournful garb, which they affected, excited the compassion of the judges, who were scan∣dalized by the gay and splendid dress of their adversary; and when the praefect Arvandus, with the first of the Gallic deputies, were directed to take their places on the senatorial benches, the same contrast of pride and modesty was observed in their behaviour. In this memorable judg∣ment, which presented a lively image of the old republic, the Gauls exposed, with force and freedom, the grievances of the province; and as soon as the minds of the audience were sufficiently inflamed, they recited the fatal epistle. The obstinacy of Arvandus was founded on the strange supposition, that a subject could not be convicted of treason, unless he had actually conspired to assume the purple. As the paper was read, he repeatedly, and with a loud voice, acknowledged it for his genuine composition; and his asto∣nishment was equal to his dismay, when the unanimous voice of the senate declared him guilty of a capital offence. By their decree, he was degraded from the rank of a praefect to the obscure condition of a plebeian, and ignominiously dragged by servile hands to the public prison. After a fortnight's adjourn∣ment, the senate was again convened to pro∣nounce the sentence of his death: but while he expected, in the island of Aesculapius, the expi∣ration

of the thirty days allowed by an ancient law to the vilest malefactors <NOTE N="100" PLACE="foot"><HI>Senatûsconsultum Tiberianum</HI> (Sirmond Not. p. 17.); but that law allowed only ten days between the sentence and execution; the remaining twenty were added in the reign of Theodosius.</NOTE>, his friends inter∣posed, the emperor Anthemius relented, and the praefect of Gaul obtained the milder punishment of exile and confiscation. The faults of Arvan∣dus might deserve compassion; but the impunity of Seronatus accused the justice of the republic, till he was condemned, and executed, on the complaint of the people of Auvergne. That flagitious minister, the Catiline of his age and country, held a secret correspondence with the Visigoths, to betray the province which he op∣pressed: his industry was continually exercised in the discovery of new taxes and obsolete offences; and his extravagant vices would have inspired contempt, if they had not excited fear and ab∣horrence <NOTE N="101" PLACE="foot">Catilina seculi nostri.

Their
<PB N="214" REF="223"/>
recommendation was approved; and Epiphanius, assuming the benevolent office of mediation, proceeded without delay to Rome, where he was received with the honours due to his merit and reputation. The oration of a bishop in favour of peace, may be easily supposed: he argued, that in all possible circumstances, the forgiveness of injuries must be an act of mercy, or magnani∣mity, or prudence; and be seriously admonished the emperor to avoid a contest with a fierce Bar∣barian, which might be fatal to himself, and must be ruinous to his dominions. Anthemius acknowledged the truth of his maxims; but he deeply felt, with grief and indignation, the be∣haviour of Ricimer; and his passion gave elo∣quence and energy to his discourse. <Q REND="inline">"What favours," he warmly exclaimed, "have we refused to this ungrateful man?

The clemency of the emperor was extorted from his weakness; and Ricimer suspended his ambi∣tious designs, till he had secretly prepared the engines, with which he resolved to subvert the throne of Anthemius. The mask of peace and moderation was then thrown aside. The army of Ricimer was fortified by a numerous reinforce∣ment of Burgundians and Oriental Suevi: he disclaimed all allegiance to the Greek emperor, marched from Milan to the gates of Rome, and fixing his camp on the banks of the Anio, impa∣tiently expected the arrival of Olybrius, his Im∣perial candidate.</P>

The king of the Vandals supported, by threats and solicitations, the fair pretensions of his Roman ally; and assigned, as one of the motives of the war, the refusal of the senate and people to acknowledge their lawful prince, and the unworthy preference which they had given to

The husband of Placidia, who, like most of his ancestors, had been invested with the consular dignity, might have continued to enjoy a secure and splendid fortune in the peaceful residence of Constantinople; nor does he appear to have been tormented by such a genius, as cannot be amused or occupied, unless by the administration of an empire. Yet Oly∣brius yielded to the importunities of his friends, perhaps of his wife; rashly plunged into the dangers and calamities of a civil war; and, with the secret connivance of the emperor Leo, ac∣cepted the Italian purple, which was bestowed, and resumed, at the capricious will of a Barba∣rian.

After extinguishing such a competitor, the emperor Nepos was acknow∣ledged by the senate, by the Italians, and by the provincials of Gaul; his moral virtues, and military talents, were loudly celebrated; and those who derived any private benefit from his government, announced, in prophetic strains, the restoration of the public felicity <NOTE N="114" PLACE="foot">Julius Nepos armis pariter summus Augustus ac moribus.

When that province was ceded to the Huns, he entered into the service of Attila, his lawful sovereign, obtained the office of his secre∣tary, and was repeatedly sent ambassador to Con∣stantinople, to represent the person, and signify the commands, of the imperious monarch. The death of that conqueror restored him to his free∣dom; and Orestes might honourably refuse either to follow the sons of Attila into the Scythian de∣sert, or to obey the Ostrogoths, who had usurped the dominion of Pannonia. He preferred the ser∣vice of the Italian princes, the successors of Va∣lentinian; and, as he possessed the qualifications of courage, industry, and experience, he advanced with rapid steps in the military profession, till he was elevated, by the favour of Nepos himself, to the dignities of patrician, and master-general of the troops. These troops had been long accus∣tomed to reverence the character and authority of Orestes, who affected their manners, conversed with them in their own language, and was inti∣mately connected with their national chieftains, by long habits of familiarity and friendship. At his solicitation they rose in arms against the ob∣scure Greek, who presumed to claim their obe∣dience; and when Orestes, from some secret mo∣tive, declined the purple, they consented, with the same facility, to acknowledge his son Au∣gustulus, as the emperor of the West. By the ab∣dication of Nepos, Orestes had now attained the <NOTE PLACE="marg">His son Augustu∣lus, the last emperor of the West, A.

must inculcate, will be retorted against himself; and that the precarious sovereign of Italy was only permitted to chuse, whether he would be the slave, or the victim, of his Barbarian mercenaries. The dangerous alliance of these strangers, had op∣pressed and insulted the last remains of Roman freedom and dignity. At each revolution, their pay and privileges were augmented; but their in∣solence increased in a still more extravagant de∣gree; they envied the fortune of their brethren in Gaul, Spain, and Africa, whose victorious arms had acquired an independent and perpetual inherit∣ance; and they insisted on their peremptory de∣mand, that a <HI>third</HI> part of the lands of Italy should be immediately divided among them. Orestes, with a spirit which, in another situation, might be entitled to our esteem, chose rather to en∣counter the rage of an armed multitude, than to subscribe the ruin of an innocent people. He re∣jected the audacious demand; and his refusal was favourable to the ambition of Odoacer; a bold Barbarian, who assured his fellow-soldiers, that, if they dared to associate under his command, they might soon extort the justice which had been denied to their dutiful petitions. From all the camps and garrisons of Italy, the confederates, actuated by the same resentment and the same hopes, impatiently flocked to the standard of this popular leader; and the unfortunate patrician, overwhelmed by the torrent, hastily retreated to the strong city of Pavia, the episcopal seat of the holy Epiphanites. Pavia was immediately be∣sieged,

But this apparent guilt was expiated by his merit or repentance: his rank was eminent and conspicuous; he enjoyed the favour of Attila; and the troops under his command, who guarded, in their turn, the royal village, consisted in a tribe of Scyrri, his imme∣diate and hereditary subjects. In the revolt of the nations, they still adhered to the Huns; and, more than twelve years afterwards, the name of Edecon is honourably mentioned, in their unequal contest with the Ostrogoths; which was termi∣nated, after two bloody battles, by the defeat and

the city and the provinces became the servile property of a tyrant. The forms of the consti∣tution, which alleviated or disguised their abject slavery, were abolished by time and violence; the Italians alternately lamented the presence or the absence of the sovereigns, whom they de∣tested or despised; and the succession of five cen∣turies inflicted the various evils of military li∣cence, capricious despotism, and elaborate op∣pression. During the same period, the Barba∣rians had emerged from obscurity and contempt, and the warriors of Germany and Scythia were introduced into the provinces, as the servants, the allies, and at length the masters, of the Ro∣mans, whom they insulted or protected. The hatred of the people was suppressed by fear; they respected the spirit and splendour of the martial chiefs who were invested with the honours of the empire; and the fate of Rome had long de∣pended on the sword of those formidable stran∣gers.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVII. <HI>Origin, Progress, and Effects of the Monastic Life.—Conversion of the Barbarians to Christianity and Arianism.—Persecution of the Vandals in Africa.—Extinction of Arianism among the Barbarians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE indissoluble connection of civil and ec∣clesiastical affairs, has compelled and en∣couraged me, to relate the progress, the perse∣cutions, the establishment, the divisions, the final triumph, and the gradual corruption of Christian∣ity. I have purposely delayed the consideration of two religious events, interesting in the study of human nature, and important in the decline and fall of the Roman empire. I. The institu∣tion of the monastic life <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The origin of the monastic institution has been laboriously dis∣cussed by Thomasin (Discipline de l'Eglise, tom. i. p. 1419—1426.) and Helyot (Hist. des Ordres Monastiques, tom. i. p. 1—66.). These authors are very learned and tolerably honest, and their difference of opinion shews the subject in its full extent. Yet the cautious Protestant, who distrusts <HI>any</HI> popish guides, may consult the seventh book of Bingham's Christian Antiquities.</NOTE>; and, II.

the conscience of the multitude. The prince or magistrate, the soldier or merchant, reconciled their fervent zeal, and implicit faith, with the exercise of their profession, the pursuit of their interest, and the indulgence of their pas∣sions: but the Ascetics who obeyed and abused the rigid precepts of the gospel, were inspired by the savage enthusiasm, which represents man as a criminal, and God as a tyrant. They seriously renounced the business, and the pleasures, of the age; abjured the use of wine, of flesh, and of marriage; chastised their body, mortified their affections, and embraced a life of misery, as the price of eternal happiness. In the reign of Con∣stantine, the Ascetics fled from a profane and degenerate world, to perpetual solitude, or reli∣gious society. Like the first Christians of Jeru∣salem <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Cassian (Collat. xviii. 5.) claims this origin for the institution of the <HI>Coenobites,</HI> which gradually decayed till it was restored by An∣thony and his disciples.</NOTE>, they resigned the use, or the property, of their temporal possessions; established regular communities of the same sex, and a similar dis∣position; and assumed the names of <HI>Hermits, Monks,</HI> and <HI>Anachorets,</HI> expressive of their lonely retreat in a natural or artificial desert.

Stoic. iii. 13.), and La Mothe le Vayer (tom. ix. de la Vertû des Payens, p. 228—262.), have compared the Carmelites to the Pythagoreans, and the Cynics to the Ca∣pucins.</NOTE>, which sur∣passed,
<PB N="240" REF="249"/>
without the aid of science or reason, the laborious virtues of the Grecian schools. The monks might indeed contend with the Stoics, in the contempt of fortune, of pain, and of death: the Pythagorean silence and submission were re∣vived in their servile discipline; and they dis∣dained, as firmly as the Cynics themselves, all the forms and decencies of civil society. But the votaries of this Divine Philosophy aspired to imi∣tate a purer and more perfect model. They trod in the footsteps of the prophets, who had retired to the desert <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">The Carmelites derive their pedigree, in regular succession, from the prophet Elijah (see the Theses of Beziers, A.

Rome, and the inquisition of Spain, silenced the profane criticism of the Jesults of Flanders (Helyot, Hist. des Ordres Monastiques, tom. i. p. 282—300.), and the statue of Elijah, the Carmelite, has been erected in the church of St. Peter (Voyages du P.

Every mode of religious worship which had been practised by the saints, every mysterious doctrine which they be∣lieved, was fortified by the sanction of divine re∣velation, and all the manly virtues were oppressed by the servile and pusillanimous reign of the monks. If it be possible to measure the interval, between the philosophic writings of Cicero and the sacred legend of Theodoret, between the cha∣racter of Cato and that of Simeon, we may ap∣preciate the memorable revolution which was ac∣complished in the Roman empire within a period of five hundred years.</P>

Goths were the foremost of these savage prose∣lytes; and the nation was indebted for its conver∣sion to a countryman, or, at least, to a subject, worthy to be ranked among the inventors of use∣ful arts, who have deserved the remembrance and gratitude of posterity. A great number of Ro∣man provincials had been led away into captivity by the Gothic bands, who ravaged Asia in the time of Gallienus: and of these captives, many were Christians, and several belonged to the ec∣clesiastical order. Those involuntary missionaries, dispersed as slaves in the villages of Dacia, suc∣cessively laboured for the salvation of their mas∣ters. The seeds, which they planted of the evan∣gelic doctrine, were gradually propagated; and, before the end of a century, the pious work was atchieved by the labours of Ulphilas, whose an∣cestors had been transported beyond the Danube from a small town of Cappadocia.</P>

spirit of the Barbarians. The rude, imperfect, idiom of soldiers and shepherds, so ill-qualified to communicate any spiritual ideas, was improved and modulated by his genius; and Ulphilas, be∣fore he could frame his version, was obliged to compose a new alphabet of twenty-four letters; four of which he invented, to express the peculiar sounds that were unknown to the Greek, and La∣tin, pronunciation <NOTE N="74" PLACE="foot">A mutilated copy of the four Gospels, in the Gothic version, was published A.

But the prosperous state of the Gothic church was soon afflicted by war and intestine discord, and the chieftains were divided by religion as well as by interest. Fritigern, the friend of the Romans, became the proselyte of Ulphilas; while the haughty soul of Athanaric disdained the yoke of the empire, and of the Go∣spel. The faith of the new converts was tried by the persecution which he excited. A waggon, bearing aloft the shapeless image, of Thor, per∣haps, or of Woden, was conducted in solemn pro∣cession through the streets of the camp; and the rebels, who refused to worship the God of their fathers, were immediately burnt, with their tents and families. The character of Ulphilas recom∣mended him to the esteem of the Eastern court, where he twice appeared as the minister of peace;
<PB N="271" REF="280"/>

The de∣vout shepherds, who were attached to his person, and tractable to his voice, acquiesced in their set∣tlement, at the foot of the Maesian mountains, in a country of woodlands and pastures, which sup∣ported their flocks and herds, and enabled them to purchase the corn and wine of the more plenti∣ful provinces.

During the same period, Christianity was em∣braced by almost all the Barbarians, who esta∣blished their kingdoms on the ruins of the Western empire; the Burgundians in Gaul, the Suevi in Spain, the Vandals in Africa, the Ostrogoths in Pannonia, and the various bands of Mercenaries, that raised Odoacer to the throne of Italy. The Franks and the Saxons still persevered in the er∣rors of Paganism; but the Franks obtained the mo∣narchy of Gaul by their submission to the example of Clovis; and the Saxon conquerors of Britain were reclaimed from their savage superstition by the missionaries of Rome. These Barbarian pro∣felytes displayed an ardent and successful zeal in the propagation of the faith. The Merovingian kings, and their successors, Charlemagne and the Othos, extended by their laws and victories, the dominion of the cross. England produced the apostle of Germany; and the evangelic light was gradually diffused from the neighbourhood of the Rhine, to the nations of the Elbe, the Vistula, and the Baltic. <NOTE N="78" PLACE="foot">Mosheim has slightly sketched the progress of Christianity in the North, from the fourth to the fourteenth century.

<P>The different motives which influenced the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Motives of their faith.</NOTE> reason, or the passions, of the Barbarian converts, cannot easily be ascertained. They were often capricious and accidental; a dream, an omen, the report of a miracle, the example of some priest, or hero, the charms of a believing wife, and above all, the fortunate event of a prayer, or vow,

The early prejudices of education were insensibly erazed by the habits of frequent and familiar society; the moral precepts of the Gospel were protected by the extravagant virtues of the monks; and a spi∣ritual theology was supported by the visible power of relics, and the pomp of religious worship. But the rational and ingenious mode of persuasion, which a Saxon bishop <NOTE N="80" PLACE="foot">See an original and curious epistle from Daniel, the first bishop of Winchester (Beda, Hist, Eccles.

<PB N="274" REF="283"/>
become infinite; and shall we not risk, by the indiscreet worship of some impotent deity, to excite the resentment of his jealous superior? The visible heavens and earth, the whole system of the universe, which may be conceived by the mind, is it created or eternal? If created, how, or where, could the gods themselves exist before the creation? If eternal, how could they assume the empire of an independent and pre∣existing world? Urge these arguments with temper and moderation; insinuate, at season∣able intervals, the truth, and beauty, of the Christian revelation; and endeavour to make the unbelievers ashamed, without making them angry."</Q> This metaphysical reasoning, too re∣fined perhaps for the Barbarians of Germany, was fortified by the grosser weight of authority and po∣pular consent. The advantage of temporal pro∣sperity had deserted the Pagan cause, and passed over to the service of Christianity. The Romans themselves, the most powerful and enlightened nation of the globe, had renounced their ancient superstition; and, if the ruin of their empire seemed to accuse the efficacy of the new faith, the disgrace was already retrieved by the conversion of the victorious Goths. The valiant and fortunate Barbarians, who subdued the provinces of the West, successively received, and reflected, the same edifying example. Before the age of Char∣lemagne, the Christian nations of Europe might exult in the exclusive possession of the temperate climates, of the fertile lands, which produced
<PB N="275" REF="284"/>
corn, wine, and oil; while the savage idolaters, and their helpless idols, were confined to the ex∣tremities of the earth, the dark and frozen regions of the North <NOTE N="81" PLACE="foot">The sword of Charlemagne added weight to the argument; but when Daniel wrote this epistle (A.

<P>Christianity, which opened the gates of Heaven <NOTE PLACE="marg">Effects of their con∣version.</NOTE> to the Barbarians, introduced an important change in their moral and political condition. They re∣ceived, at the same time, the use of letters, so es∣sential to a religion whose doctrines are contained in a sacred book; and while they studied the di∣vine truth, their minds were insensibly enlarged by the distant view of history, of nature, of the arts, and of society. The version of the Scrip∣tures into their native tongue, which had facili∣tated their conversion, must excite, among their clergy, some curiosity to read the original text, to understand the sacred liturgy of the church, and to examine, in the writings of the fathers, the chain of ecclesiastical tradition. These spiritual gifts were preserved in the Greek and Latin lan∣guages, which concealed the inestimable monu∣ments of ancient learning. The immortal pro∣ductions of Virgil, Cicero, and Livy, which were accessible to the Christian Barbarians, maintained a silent intercourse between the reign of Augustus, and the times of Clovis and Charlemagne, The emulation of mankind was encouraged by the re∣membrance of a more perfect state; and the flame of science was secretly kept alive, to warm and
<PB N="276" REF="285"/>
enlighten the mature age of the Western world. In the most corrupt state of Christianity, the Bar∣barians might learn justice from the <HI>law,</HI> and mercy from the <HI>gospel:</HI> and if the knowledge of their duty was insufficient to guide their actions, or to regulate their passions; they were sometimes restrained by conscience, and frequently punished by remorse. But the direct authority of religion was less effectual, than the holy communion which united them with their Christian brethren in spi∣ritual friendship. The influence of these senti∣ments contributed to secure their fidelity in the service, or the alliance, of the Romans, to alle∣viate the horrors of war, to moderate the insolence of conquest, and to preserve, in the downfall of the empire, a permanent respect for the name and institutions of Rome. In the days of Paganism, the priests of Gaul and Germany reigned over the people, and controuled the jurisdiction of the ma∣gistrates; and the zealous proselytes transferred an equal, or more ample, measure of devout obe∣dience, to the pontiffs of the Christian faith. The sacred character of the bishops was supported by their temporal possessions; they obtained an ho∣nourable seat in the legislative assemblies of sol∣diers and freemen; and it was their interest, as well as their duty, to mollify, by peaceful coun∣sels, the fierce spirit of the Barbarians. The per∣petual correspondence of the Latin clergy, the frequent pilgrimages to Rome and Jerusalem, and the growing authority of the Popes, cemented the union of the Christian republic: and gradually produced the similar manners, and common juris∣prudence,
<PB N="277" REF="286"/>
which have distinguished, from the rest of mankind, the independent, and even hos∣tile, nations of modern Europe.</P>
<P>But the operation of these causes was checked <NOTE PLACE="marg">They are involved in the Arian heresy.</NOTE> and retarded by the unfortunate accident, which infused a deadly poison into the cup of Salvation. Whatever might be the early sentiments of Ul∣philas, his connections with the empire and the church were formed during the reign of Arianism. The apostle of the Goths subscribed the creed of Rimini; professed with freedom, and perhaps with sincerity, that the SON was not equal, or consub∣stantial to the FATHER <NOTE N="82" PLACE="foot">The opinions of Ulphilas and the Goths inclined to Semi-Ari∣anism, since they would not say that the Son was a <HI>creature,</HI> though they held communion with those who maintained that heresy.

<PB N="281" REF="290"/>
The religious war was preceded and prepared by an insidious truce; persecution was made the serious and important business of the Vandal court; and the loathsome disease, which hastened the death of Hunneric, revenged the injuries, without contributing to the deliverance, of the church. The throne of Africa was successively filled by the two nephews of Hunneric; by Gun∣damund, who reigned about twelve, and by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gunda∣mund, A.

Gundamund appeared to emulate, or even to surpass, the cruelty of his uncle; and, if at length he relented, if he recalled the bishops, and restored the freedom of Athanasian worship, a premature death intercepted the benefits of his tardy clemency. His brother, Thrasimund, was the greatest and most accomplished of the Vandal <NOTE PLACE="marg">Thrasi∣mund, A. D. 496.</NOTE> kings, whom he excelled in beauty, prudence, and magnanimity of soul. But this magnanimous character was degraded by his intolerant zeal and deceitful clemency. Instead of threats and tor∣tures, he employed the gentle, but efficacious, powers of seduction. Wealth, dignity, and the royal favour, were the liberal rewards of apo∣stacy; the Catholics, who had violated the laws, might purchase their pardon by the renunciation of their faith; and whenever Thrasimund medi∣tated any rigorous measure, he patiently waited till the indiscretion of his adversaries furnished him with a specious opportunity. Bigotry was his last sentiment in the hour of death: and he

exacted from his successor a solemn oath, that he would never tolerate the sectaries of Athana∣sius.

They excite the flame which they strive to extinguish; and it soon becomes necessary to chastise the contumacy, as well as the crime, of the offender. The fine, which he is unable or unwilling to discharge, exposes his person to the severity of the law; and his contempt of lighter penalties suggests the use and propriety of capital punishment.

His eldest son Hermenegild, who was invested by his father with the royal diadem, and the fair principality of Boetica, contracted an honourable and ortho∣dox alliance with a Merovingian princess, the daughter of Sigibert king of Austrasia, and of the famous Brunechild. The beauteous Ingun∣dis, who was no more than thirteen years of age, was received, beloved, and persecuted, in the Arian court of Toledo; and her religious con∣stancy was alternately assaulted with blandish∣ments and violence by Goisvintha, the Gothic queen, who abused the double claim of maternal authority <NOTE N="126" PLACE="foot">Goisvintha successively married two kings of the Visigoths: Athanigild, to whom she bore Brunechild, the mother of Ingundis; and Leovigild, whose two sons, Hermenegild and Recared, were the issue of a former marriage.</NOTE>.

Love and honour might excite Hermenegild to resent this injurious treatment of his bride; and he was gradually persuaded, that Ingundis suffered for the cause of divine truth.

The rash youth, inflamed by zeal, and perhaps by ambition, was tempted to violate the duties of a son, and a subject; and the Ca∣tholics of Spain, although they could not com∣plain of persecution, applauded his pious rebel∣lion against an heretical father. The civil war was protracted by the long and obstinate sieges of Merida, Cordova, and Seville, which had stre∣nuously espoused the party of Hermenegild. He invited the orthodox Barbarians, the Suevi, and
<PB N="298" REF="307"/>
the Franks, to the destruction of his native land: he folicited the dangerous aid of the Romans, who possessed Africa, and a part of the Spanish coast; and his holy ambassador, the archbishop Leander, effectually negociated in person with the Byzantine court. But the hopes of the Ca∣tholics were crushed by the active diligence of a monarch who commanded the troops and trea∣sures of Spain; and the guilty Hermenegild, after his vain attempts to resist or to escape, was com∣pelled to surrender himself into the hands of an incensed father. Leovigild was still mindful of that sacred character; and the rebel, despoiled of the regal ornaments, was still permitted, in a decent exile, to profess the Catholic religion. His repeated and unsuccessful treasons at length provoked the indignation of the Gothic king; and the sentence of death, which he pronounced with apparent reluctance, was privately executed in the tower of Seville. The inflexible constancy with which he refused to accept the Arian com∣munion, as the price of his safety, may excuse the honours that have been paid to the memory of St. Hermenegild. His wife and infant son were detained by the Romans in ignominious captivity: and this domestic misfortune tarnish∣ed the glories of Leovigild, and embittered the last moments of his life.</P>

against his father, Recared patiently expected the hour of his death. Instead of condemning his memory, he piously supposed, that the dying monarch had abjured the errors of Arianism, and recommended to his son the conversion of the Gothic nation. To accomplish that salutary end, Recared convened an assembly of the Arian clergy and nobles, declared himself a Catholic, and ex∣horted them to imitate the example of their prince. The laborious interpretation of doubtful texts, or the curious pursuit of metaphysical arguments, would have excited an endless controversy; and the monarch discreetly proposed to his illiterate audience, two substantial and visible arguments, the testimony of Earth, and of Heaven. The <HI>Earth</HI> had submitted to the Nicene synod: the Romans, the Barbarians, and the inhabitants of Spain, unanimously professed the same orthodox creed; and the Visigoths resisted, almost alone, the consent of the Christian world. A supersti∣tious age was prepared to reverence, as the testi∣mony of <HI>Heaven,</HI> the preternatural cures, which were performed by the skill or virtue of the Ca∣tholic clergy; the baptismal fonts of Osset in Boetica <NOTE N="129" PLACE="foot">Osset, or Julia Constantia, was opposite to Seville, on the northern side of the Boetis (Plin.

The Catholic king encoun∣tered some difficulties on this important change of the national religion. A conspiracy, secretly fomented by the queen-dowager, was formed against his life; and two counts excited a dan∣gerous revolt in the Narbonnese Gaul. But Re∣cared disarmed the conspirators, defeated the rebels, and executed severe justice; which the Arians, in their turn, might brand with the re∣proach of persecution. Eight bishops, whose names betray their Barbaric origin, abjured their errors; and all the books of Arian theology were reduced to ashes, with the house in which they had been purposely collected. The whole body of the Visigoths and Suevi were allured or driven into the pale of the Catholic communion; the faith, at least of the rising generation, was fer∣vent and sincere; and the devout liberality of the Barbarians enriched the churches and monas∣teries of Spain. Seventy bishops, assembled in the council of Toledo, received the submission of their conquerors; and the zeal of the Spaniards improved the Nicene creed, by declaring the pro∣cession

The successors of Clovis inflicted one hundred lashes on the peasants who refused to destroy their idols; the crime of sacrificing to the daemons was punished by the Anglo-Saxon laws with the heavier penalties of imprisonment and confiscation; and even the wise Alfred adopted, as an indispensable duty, the extreme rigour of the Mosaic institutions <NOTE N="136" PLACE="foot">See the Historians of France, tom. iv. p. 114.; and Wilkins, Leges Anglo-Saxonicae, p. 11. 31.

Their frequent relapses provoked one of the suc∣cessors of Sisebut to banish the whole nation from his dominions; and a council of Toledo pub∣lished a decree, that every Gothic king should swear to maintain this salutary edict. But the tyrants were unwilling to dismiss the victims, whom they delighted to torture, or to deprive themselves of the industrious slaves, over whom they might exercise a lucrative oppression. The Jews still continued in Spain, under the weight of the civil and ecclesiastical laws, which in the same country have been faithfully transcribed in the Code of the Inquisition. The Gothic kings and bishops at length discovered, that injuries will produce hatred, and that hatred will find the opportunity of revenge.

the church, and, perhaps, of the empire. The historian of the empire may overlook those dis∣putes which were confined to the obscurity of schools and synods. The Manichaeans, who la∣boured to reconcile the religions of Christ and of Zoroaster, had secretly introduced themselves into the provinces: but these foreign sectaries were involved in the common disgrace of the Gnostics, and the Imperial laws were executed by the pub∣lic hatred. The rational opinions of the Pela∣gians were propagated from Britain to Rome, Africa, and Palestine, and silently expired in a superstitious age. But the East was distracted by the Nestorian and Eutychian controversies; which attempted to explain the mystery of the incarna∣tion, and hastened the ruin of Christianity in her native land. These controversies were first agi∣tated under the reign of the younger Theodosius: but their important consequences extend far be∣yond the limits of the present volume. The me∣taphysical chain of argument, the contests of ec∣clesiastical ambition, and their political influence on the decline of the Byzantine empire, may afford an interesting and instructive series of his∣tory, from the general councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon, to the conquest of the East by the successors of Mahomet.</P>

The liberal studies were still cultivated in the schools of Autun and Bor∣deaux; and the language of Cicero and Virgil was familiar to the Gallic youth. Their ears were astonished by the harsh and unknown sounds of the Germanic dialect, and they ingeniously lamented that the trembling muses fled from the harmony of a Burgundian lyre.

The great Theodoric congratulated the victory of Clovis, whose sister Albofleda the king of Italy had lately married; but he mildly interceded with his brother in favour of the suppliants and fugitives, who had implored his protection. The Gallic territories, which were possessed by the Alemanni, became the prize of their con∣queror; and the haughty nation, invincible, or rebellious, to the arms of Rome, acknowledged the sovereignty of the Merovingian kings, who graciously permitted them to enjoy their peculiar manners and institutions, under the government of official, and, at length, of hereditary, dukes. After the conquest of the Western provinces, the Franks alone maintained their ancient habitations beyond the Rhine. They gradually subdued, and civilised, the exhausted countries, as far as the Elbe, and the mountains of Bohemia; and the peace of Europe was secured by the obedience of Germany <NOTE N="24" PLACE="foot">Gregory of Tours (l. ii. 30. 37. in tom. ii. p. 176, 177. 182.), the Gesta Francorum (in tom. ii. p. 551.), and the epistle of Theo∣doric (Cassiodor.

The emperor Anastasius entertained some dangerous errors con∣cerning the nature of the divine incarnation; and the Barbarians of Italy, Africa, Spain, and Gaul were involved in the Arian heresy.

were reconciled by the religion of the Franks. The military force, which had been stationed for the defence of Gaul, consisted of one hundred dif∣ferent bands of cavalry or infantry; and these troops, while they assumed the title and privileges of Roman soldiers, were renewed by an incessant supply of the Barbarian youth. The extreme for∣tifications, and scattered fragments, of the em∣pire, were still defended by their hopeless courage. But their retreat was intercepted, and their com∣munication was impracticable: they were aban∣doned by the Greek princes of Constantinople, and they piously disclaimed all connection with the Arian usurpers of Gaul. They accepted, without shame or reluctance, the generous capitulation, which was proposed by a Catholic hero; and this spurious, or legitimate, progeny of the Roman legions, was distinguished in the succeeding age by their arms, their ensigns, and their peculiar dress and institutions. But the national strength was increased by these powerful and voluntary ac∣cessions; and the neighbouring kingdoms dread∣ed the numbers, as well as the spirit, of the Franks. The reduction of the Northern pro∣vinces of Gaul, instead of being decided by the chance of a single battle, appears to have been slowly effected by the gradual operation of war and treaty; and Clovis acquired each object of his ambition, by such efforts, or such conces∣sions, as were adequate to its real value. <HI>His</HI> savage character, and the virtues of Henry IV. suggest the most opposite ideas of human nature: yet some resemblance may be found in the situa∣tion

But their apparent confidence concealed a dark suspicion of hostile and treacherous de∣signs; and their mutual complaints solicited, eluded, and disclaimed, a final arbitration.

Orleans secured to the Franks a bridge on the Loire; but, at the distance of forty miles from Poitiers, their progress was intercepted by an ex∣traordinary swell of the river Vigenna, or Vienne; and the opposite banks were covered by the encampment of the Visigoths. Delay must be always dangerous to Barbarians, who consume the country through which they march; and had Clovis possessed leisure and materials, it might

have been impracticable to construct a bridge, or to force a passage, in the face of a superior enemy. But the affectionate peasants, who were impatient to welcome their deliverer, could easily betray some unknown, or unguarded, ford: the merit of the discovery was enhanced by the useful in∣terposition of fraud or fiction; and a white hart, of singular size and beauty, appeared to guide and animate the march of the Catholic army. The counsels of the Visigoths were irresolute and distracted. A crowd of impatient warriors, pre∣sumptuous in their strength, and disdaining to sly before the robbers of Germany, excited Ala∣ric to assert in arms the name and blood of the conqueror of Rome. The advice of the graver chieftains pressed him to elude the first ardour of the Franks; and to expect, in the southern provinces of Gaul, the veteran and victorious Ostrogoths, whom the king of Italy had already sent to his assistance. The decisive moments were wasted in idle deliberation; the Goths too hastily abandoned, perhaps, an advantageous post; and the opportunity of a secure retreat was lost by their slow and disorderly motions.

His nocturnal march was directed by a flaming meteor, suspend∣ed in the air above the cathedral of Poitiers; and this signal, which might be previously concerted with the orthodox successor of St. Hilary, was compared to the column of fire that guided the

Israelites in the desert. At the third hour of the day, about ten miles beyond Poitiers, Clovis overtook, and instantly attacked, the Gothic army; whose defeat was already prepared by ter∣ror and confusion. Yet they rallied in their ex∣treme distress, and the martial youths, who had clamorously demanded the battle, refused to survive the ignominy of flight. The two kings encountered each other in single combat. Alaric fell by the hand of his rival; and the victorious Frank was saved by the goodness of his cuirass, and the vigour of his horse, from the spears of two desperate Goths, who furiously rode against him, to revenge the death of their sovereign. The vague expression of a mountain of the slain, serves to indicate a cruel, though indefinite, slaughter; but Gregory has carefully observed, that his valiant countryman Apollinaris, the son of Sidonius, lost his life at the head of the nobles of Auvergne.

that it is almost equally difficult to foresee the events of war, or to explain their various con∣sequences. A bloody and complete victory has sometimes yielded no more than the possession of the field; and the loss of ten thousand men has sometimes been sufficient to destroy, in a single day, the work of ages. The decisive battle of Poitiers was followed by the conquest of Aqui∣tain. Alaric had left behind him an infant son, a bastard competitor, factious nobles, and a dis∣loyal people; and the remaining forces of the Goths were oppressed by the general consterna∣tion, or opposed to each other in civil discord. The victorious king of the Franks proceeded without delay to the siege of Angoulême.

<P>Twenty-five years after the death of Clovis, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Final esta∣blishment of the French monarchy in Gaul, A.

The Ostrogoths of Italy, un∣able to defend their distant acquisitions, had re∣signed to the Franks the cities of Arles and Mar∣seilles: of Arles, still adorned with the seat of a Praetorian praefect; and of Marseilles, enriched by the advantages of trade and navigation <NOTE N="58" PLACE="foot">Under the Merovingian kings, Marseilles still imported from the East, paper, wine, oil, linen, silk, precious stones, spices, &amp;c.

Yet the laws of the Barbarians were adapted to their wants and desires, their occupations and their capacity; and they all contributed to preserve the peace, and promote the improvements, of the society for whose use they were originally established.

A more ample latitude was allowed, if every citizen, in the pre∣sence of the judge, might declare the law under which he desired to live, and the national so∣ciety to which he chose to belong. Such an in∣dulgence would abolish the partial distinctions of victory; and the Roman provincials might pa∣tiently acquiesce in the hardships of their condi∣tion; since it depended on themselves to assume the privilege, if they dared to assert the charac∣ter, of free and warlike Barbarians <NOTE N="71" PLACE="foot">This liberty of choice has been aptly deduced (Esprit des Loix, l. xxviii. 2.) from a constitution of Lothaire I.

But in the loose society of the Germans, revenge was always honourable, and often meritorious: the independent warrior cha∣stised, or vindicated, with his own hand, the in∣juries which he had offered, or received; and he had only to dread the resentment of the sons, and kinsmen, of the enemy whom he had sacrificed to his selfish or angry passions. The magistrate, conscious of his weakness, interposed, not to pu∣nish, but to reconcile; and he was satisfied if he could persuade, or compel, the contending par∣ties to pay, and to accept, the moderate fine which had been ascertained as the price of blood <NOTE N="72" PLACE="foot">In the heroic times of Greece, the guilt of murder was ex∣piated by a pecuniary satisfaction to the family of the deceased (Fei∣thius Antiquitat.

Two hundred were deemed suffi∣cient for a Frank of ordinary condition; but the meaner Romans were exposed to disgrace and danger by a trifling compensation of one hun∣dred, or even fifty, pieces of gold. Had these laws been regulated by any principle of equity or reason, the public protection should have sup∣plied in just proportion the want of personal strength. But the legislator had weighed in the scale, not of justice, but of policy, the loss of a soldier against that of a slave: the head of an in∣solent and rapacious Barbarian was guarded by an heavy fine; and the slightest aid was afforded to

the most defenceless subjects. Time insensibly abated the pride of the conquerors, and the pa∣tience of the vanquished; and the boldest citizen was taught by experience, that he might suffer more injuries than he could inflict. As the man∣ners of the Franks became less ferocious, their laws were rendered more severe; and the Mero∣vingian kings attempted to imitate the impartial rigour of the Visigoths and Burgundians <NOTE N="75" PLACE="foot">See the Burgundian laws (tit. ii. in tom. iv. p. 257.), the Code of the Visigoths (l. vi. tit. v. in tom. iv. p. 384.), and the constitution of <HI>Childebert,</HI> not of Paris, but most evidently of Austrasia (in tom. iv. p. 112.).

Their personal injuries were partial and irregular; but the great body of the Romans

A large portion of their lands was exacted for the use of the Franks: but they enjoyed the remainder, exempt from tribute <NOTE N="112" PLACE="foot">The Abbé de Mably (tom. i. p. 247—267) has diligently confirmed this opinion of the president de Montesquieu (Esprit des Loix, l. xxx. c. 13.).</NOTE>; and the same irresistible violence which swept away the arts and manu∣factures of Gaul, destroyed the elaborate and expensive system of Imperial despotism. The Provincials must frequently deplore the savage jurisprudence of the Salic or Ripuarian laws; but their private life, in the important concerns of marriage, testaments, or inheritance, was still regulated by the Theodosian Code; and a dis∣contented Roman might freely aspire, or descend, to the title and character of a Barbarian. The honours of the state were accessible to his ambi∣tion: the education and temper of the Romans more peculiarly qualified them for the offices of civil government; and, as soon as emulation had rekindled their military ardour, they were per∣mitted to march in the ranks, or even at the head, of the victorious Germans.

Observations, &amp;c. tom. i. p. 34—56. It should seem that the institution of national assemblies, which are coeval with the French nation, have never been congenial to its temper.</NOTE>. The monarchy was left without any regular establish∣ment of justice, of arms, or of revenue. The successors of Clovis wanted resolution to assume, or strength to exercise, the legislative and exe∣cutive powers, which the people had abdicated: the royal prerogative was distinguished only by a more ample privilege of rapine and murder; and the love of freedom, so often invigorated and disgraced by private ambition, was reduced, among the licentious Franks, to the contempt of order, and the desire of impunity. Seventy-five years after the death of Clovis, his grandson, Gontran, king of Burgundy, sent an army to invade the Gothic possessions of Septimania, or
<PB N="374" REF="383"/>
Languedoc. The troops of Burgundy, Berry, Auvergne, and the adjacent territories, were ex∣cited by the hopes of spoil. They marched, without discipline, under the banners of German, or Gallic, counts: their attack was feeble and unsuccessful; but the friendly and hostile pro∣vinces were desolated with indiscriminate rage. The corn-fields, the villages, the churches them∣selves, were consumed by fire; the inhabitants were massacred, or dragged into captivity; and, in the disorderly retreat, five thousand of these inhuman savages were destroyed by hunger or intestine discord. When the pious Gontran re∣proached the guilt, or neglect, of their leaders; and threatened to inflict, not a legal sentence, but instant and arbitrary execution; they accused the universal and incurable corruption of the people. <Q REND="inline">"No one," they said, "any longer fears or respects his king, his duke, or his count.

<P>The Visigoths had resigned to Clovis the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Visi∣goths of Spain.</NOTE> greatest part of their Gallic possessions; but their loss was amply compensated by the easy conquest, and secure enjoyment, of the provinces of Spain. From the monarchy of the Goths, which soon in∣volved the Suevic kingdom of Galicia, the mo∣dern Spaniards still derive some national vanity: but the historian of the Roman Empire is neither invited, nor compelled, to pursue the obscure and barren series of their annals <NOTE N="122" PLACE="foot">Spain, in these dark ages, has been peculiarly unfortunate. The Franks had a Gregory of Tours; the Saxons, or Angles, a Bede; the Lombards, a Paul Warnefrid, &amp;c. But the history of the Visigoths is contained in the short and imperfect chronicles of Isidore of Seville, and John of Biclar.</NOTE>. The Goths of Spain were separated from the rest of mankind, by the lofty ridge of the Pyrenaean mountains: their manners and institutions, as far as they were common to the Germanic tribes, have been al∣ready explained. I have anticipated, in the pre∣ceding chapter, the most important of their eccle∣siastical events, the fall of Arianism, and the per∣secution of the Jews: and it only remains to ob∣serve some interesting circumstances, which re∣late to the civil and ecclesiastical constitution of the Spanish kingdom.</P>
<P>After their conversion from idolatry or heresy, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Legislative assemblies of Spain.</NOTE> the Franks and the Visigoths were disposed to
<PB N="376" REF="385"/>
embrace, with equal submission, the inherent evils, and the accidental benefits, of superstition. But the prelates of France, long before the ex∣tinction of the Merovingian race, had degene∣rated into fighting and hunting Barbarians. They disdained the use of synods; forgot the laws of temperance and chastity; and preferred the in∣dulgence of private ambition and luxury, to the general interest of the sacerdotal profession <NOTE N="123" PLACE="foot">Such are the complaints of St. Boniface, the apostle of Ger∣many, and the reformer of Gaul (in tom. iv. p. 94.). The four-score years, which he deplores, of licence and corruption, would seem to insinuate, that the Barbarians were admitted into the clergy about the year 660.</NOTE>. The bishops of Spain respected themselves, and were respected by the public: their indissoluble union disguised their vices, and confirmed their authority: and the regular discipline of the church introduced peace, order, and stability into the government of the state. From the reign of Re∣cared, the first Catholic king, to that of Witiza, the immediate predecessor of the unfortunate Ro∣deric, sixteen national councils were successively convened. The six metropolitans, Toledo, Se∣ville, Merida, Braga, Tarragona, and Narbonne, presided according to their respective seniority; the assembly was composed of their suffragan bishops, who appeared in person, or by their proxies; and a place was assigned to the most holy or opulent of the Spanish abbots. During the first three days of the convocation, as long as they agitated the ecclesiastical questions of doctrine and discipline, the profane laity was excluded from
<PB N="377" REF="386"/>
their debates; which were conducted, however, with decent solemnity. But, on the morning of the fourth day, the doors were thrown open for the entrance of the great officers of the palace, the dukes and counts of the provinces, the judges of the cities, and the Gothic nobles: and the de∣crees of Heaven were ratified by the consent of the people. The same rules were observed in the provincial assemblies, the annual synods which were empowered to hear complaints, and to re∣dress grievances; and a legal government was supported by the prevailing influence of the Spa∣nish clergy. The bishops, who, in each revolu∣tion, were prepared to flatter the victorious, and to insult the prostrate, laboured, with diligence and success, to kindle the flames of persecution, and to exalt the mitre above the crown. Yet the national councils of Toledo, in which the free spirit of the Barbarians was tempered and guided by episcopal policy, have established some pru∣dent laws for the common benefit of the king and people. The vacancy of the throne was supplied by the choice of the bishops and Pala∣tines; and, after the failure of the line of Alaric, the regal dignity was still limited to the pure and noble blood of the Goths. The clergy, who anointed their lawful prince, always recommend∣ed, and sometimes practised, the duty of alle∣giance: and the spiritual censures were de∣nounced on the heads of the impious subjects, who should resist his authority, conspire against his life, or violate, by an indecent union, the chastity even of his widow. But the monarch
<PB N="378" REF="387"/>
himself, when he ascended the throne, was bound by a reciprocal oath to God and his people, that he would faithfully execute his important trust. The real or imaginary faults of his administration were subject to the controul of a powerful aristo∣cracy; and the bishops and palatines were guarded by a fundamental privilege, that they should not be degraded, imprisoned, tortured, nor punished with death, exile, or confiscation, unless by the free and public judgment of their peers <NOTE N="124" PLACE="foot">The acts of the councils of Toledo are still the most authentic records of the church and constitution of Spain. The following passages are particularly important (iii. 17, 18. iv. 75. v. 2, 3, 4, 5. 8. vi. 11, 12, 13, 14. 17, 18. vii. 1. xiii. 2, 3, 6.).

<P>One of these legislative councils of Toledo, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Code of the Visi∣goths.</NOTE> examined and ratified the code of laws which had been compiled by a succession of Gothic kings, from the fierce Euric, to the devout Egica. As long as the Visigoths themselves were satisfied with the rude customs of their ancestors, they indulged their subjects of Aquitain and Spain in the enjoyment of the Roman law. Their gradual improvement in arts, in policy, and at length in religion, encouraged them to imitate, and to su∣persede, these foreign institutions; and to com∣pose a code of civil and criminal jurisprudence, for the use of a great and united people. The same obligations, and the same privileges, were communicated to the nations of the Spanish mo∣narchy: and the conquerors, insensibly renoun∣cing
<PB N="379" REF="388"/>
the Teutonic idiom, submitted to the re∣straints of equity, and exalted the Romans to the participation of freedom. The merit of this im∣partial policy was enhanced by the situation of Spain, under the reign of the Visigoths. The Provincials were long separated from their Arian masters, by the irreconcilable difference of re∣ligion. After the conversion of Recared had re∣moved the prejudices of the Catholics, the coasts, both of the Ocean and Mediterranean, were still possessed by the Eastern emperors; who secretly excited a discontented people, to reject the yoke of the Barbarians, and to assert the name and dignity of Roman citizens. The allegiance of doubtful subjects is indeed most effectually se∣cured by their own persuasion, that they hazard more in a revolt, than they can hope to obtain by a revolution; but it has appeared so natural to oppress those whom we hate and fear, that the contrary system well deserves the praise of wisdom and moderation <NOTE N="125" PLACE="foot">The Code of the Visigoths, regularly divided into twelve books, has been correctly published by Dom Bouquet (in tom. iv. p. 273—460.). It has been treated by the president de Montesquieu (Esprit des Loix, l. xxviii. c. 1.) with excessive severity. I dis∣like the style; I detest the superstition; but I shall presume to think, that the civil jurisprudence displays a more civilised and enlightened state of society, than that of the Burgundians, or even of the Lom∣bards.</NOTE>.</P>

The Saxons, who excelled in the use of the oar, or the battle-axe, were ignorant of the art which could alone perpetuate the fame of their exploits: the Provincials, relapsing into Barbarism, neglected to describe the ruin of their country; and the doubtful tradition was almost extinguished, be∣fore the missionaries of Rome restored the light of science and Christianity.

About forty years after the dissolution of the Roman government, Vortigern appears to have obtained the supreme, though precarious, com∣mand <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descent of the Saxons, A.

That unfortunate monarch has been almost unanimously condemned for the weak and mischievous policy of inviting <NOTE N="128" PLACE="foot">This <HI>invitation,</HI> which may derive some countenance from the loose expressions of Gildas and Bede, is framed into a regular story by Witikind, a Saxon monk of the tenth century (see Cousin, Hist. de l'Empire d'Occident, tom. ii. p. 356.). Rapin, and even Hume, have too freely used this suspicious evidence, without regarding the precise and probable testimony of Nennius: Interea venerunt tres Chiulae a Germaniâ <HI>in exilio pulsae,</HI> in quibus erant Hors et Hengist.</NOTE> a formidable stranger, to repel the vexatious inroads of a domestic foe. His am∣bassadors are dispatched, by the gravest histo∣rians, to the coast of Germany; they address a pathetic oration to the general assembly of the Saxons, and those warlike Barbarians resolve to assist with a fleet and army the suppliants of a distant and unknown island. If Britain had in∣deed been unknown to the Saxons, the measure of its calamities would have been less complete. But the strength of the Roman government could not always guard the maritime province against the pirates of Germany: the independent and di∣vided states were exposed to their attacks; and the Saxons might sometimes join the Scots and the Picts, in a tacit, or express, confederacy of rapine and destruction. Vortigern could only balance the various perils, which assaulted on every side his throne and his people; and his po∣licy may deserve either praise or excuse, if he pre∣ferred the alliance of <HI>those</HI> Barbarians, whose naval
<PB N="382" REF="391"/>
power rendered them the most dangerous enemies, and the most serviceable allies. Hengist and Horsa, as they ranged along the Eastern coast with three ships, were engaged, by the promise of an ample stipend, to embrace the defence of Britain; and their intrepid valour soon delivered the country from the Caledonian invaders. The isle of Thanet, a secure and fertile district, was allotted for the residence of these German auxi∣liaries, and they were supplied, according to the treaty, with a plentiful allowance of clothing and provisions. This favourable reception encou∣raged five thousand warriors to embark with their families in seventeen vessels, and the infant power of Hengist was fortified by this strong and season∣able reinforcement. The crafty Barbarian sug∣gested to Vortigern the obvious advantage of fix∣ing, in the neighbourhood of the Picts, a colony of faithful allies: a third fleet of forty ships, under the command of his son and nephew, sailed from Germany, ravaged the Orkneys, and disembarked a new army on the coast of Northumberland, or Lothian, at the opposite extremity of the devoted land. It was easy to foresee, but it was im∣possible to prevent, the impending evils. The two nations were soon divided and exasperated by mutual jealousies. The Saxons magnified all that they had done and suffered in the cause of an un∣grateful people; while the Britons regretted the liberal rewards which could not satisfy the avarice of those haughty mercenaries. The causes of fear and hatred were inflamed into an irrecon∣cileable quarrel. The Saxons flew to arms; and,

if they perpetrated a treacherous massacre during the security of a feast, the destroyed the recipro∣cal confidence which sustains the intercourse of peace and war <NOTE N="129" PLACE="foot">Nennius imputes to the Saxons the murder of three hundred British chiefs; a crime not unsuitable to their savage manners.

<P>Hengist, who boldly aspired to the conquest of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Establish∣ment of the Saxon heptarchy, A. D. 455—582.</NOTE> Britain, exhorted his countrymen to embrace the glorious opportunity: he painted in lively co∣lours the fertility of the soil, the wealth of the cities, the pusillanimous temper of the natives, and the convenient situation of a spacious solitary island, accessible on all sides to the Saxon fleets. The successive colonies which issued, in the period of a century, from the mouths of the Elbe, the Weser, and the Rhine, were principally com∣posed of three valiant tribes or nations of Ger∣many; the <HI>Jutes,</HI> the <HI>old Saxons,</HI> and the <HI>Angles.</HI> The Jutes, who fought under the peculiar banner of Hengist, assumed the merit of leading their countrymen in the paths of glory, and of erecting, in Kent, the first independent kingdom. The fame of the enterprise was attributed to the pri∣mitive Saxons; and the common laws and lan∣guage of the conquerors are described by the na∣tional appellation of a people, which, at the end of four hundred years, produced the first mo∣narchs of South Britain. The Angles were dis∣tinguished by their numbers and their success;
<PB N="384" REF="393"/>
and they claimed the honour of fixing a perpetual name on the country, of which they occupied the most ample portion. The Barbarians, who fol∣lowed the hopes of rapine either on the land or sea, were insensibly blended with this triple con∣federacy; the <HI>Frisians,</HI> who had been tempted by their vicinity to the British shores, might balance, during a short space, the strength and reputation of the native Saxons; the <HI>Danes,</HI> the <HI>Prussians,</HI> the <HI>Rugians</HI> are faintly described; and some ad∣venturous <HI>Huns,</HI> who had wandered as far as the Baltic, might embark on board the German ves∣sels, for the conquest of a new world <NOTE N="130" PLACE="foot">All these tribes are expressly enumerated by Bede (l. i. c. 15. p. 52. l. v. c. 9. p. 190.), and though I have considered Mr. Whit∣aker's remarks (Hist. of Manchester, vol. ii. p. 538—543.), I do not perceive the absurdity of supposing that the Frisians, &amp;c. were mingled with the Anglo-Saxons.</NOTE>. But this arduous atchievement was not prepared or executed by the union of national powers. Each intrepid chieftain, according to the measure of his fame and fortunes, assembled his followers; equipped a fleet of three, or perhaps of sixty, vessels; chose the place of the attack; and con∣ducted his subsequent operations according to the events of the war and the dictates of his private interest. In the invasion of Britain many heroes vanquished and fell; but only seven victorious leaders assumed, or at least maintained, the title of kings.

had been insensibly moulded into the elegant and servile form of a Roman province, whose safety was entrusted to a foreign power. The subjects of Honorius contemplated their new freedom with surprise and terror; they were left destitute of any civil or military constitution; and their un∣certain rulers wanted either skill, or courage, or authority, to direct the public force against the common enemy. The introduction of the Saxons betrayed their internal weakness, and degraded the character both of the prince and people. Their consternation magnified the danger; the want of union diminished their resources; and the madness of civil factions was more solicitous to accuse, than to remedy, the evils, which they imputed to the misconduct of their adversaries. Yet the Britons were not ignorant, they could not be ignorant, of the manufacture or the use of arms: the successive and disorderly attacks of the Saxons, allowed them to recover from their amazement, and the prosperous or adverse events of the war added discipline and experience to their native valour.</P>
<P>While the continent of Europe and Africa <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their re∣sistance,</NOTE> yielded, without resistance, to the Barbarians, the British island, alone and unaided, maintained a long, a vigorous, though an unsuccessful struggle, against the formidable pirates, who, almost at the same instant, assaulted the Northern, the Eastern, and the Southern coasts. The cities which had been fortified with skill, were defended with resolution; the advantages of ground, hills,
<PB N="387" REF="396"/>
forests, and morasses, were diligently improved by the inhabitants; the conquest of each district was purchased with blood; and the defeats of the Saxons are strongly attested by the discreet silence of their annalist. Hengist might hope to atchieve the conquest of Britain; but his ambition, in an active reign of thirty-five years, was confined to the possession of Kent; and the numerous colony which he had planted in the North, was extirpated by the sword of the Britons. The monarchy of the West-Saxons was laboriously founded by the persevering efforts of three martial generations. The life of Cerdic, one of the bravest of the children of Woden, was consumed in the con∣quest of Hampshire, and the isle of Wight; and the loss which he sustained in the battle of Mount Badon, reduced him to a state of inglorious re∣pose. Kenric, his valiant son, advanced into Wiltshire; besieged Salisbury, at that time seated on a commanding eminence; and vanquished an army which advanced to the relief of the city. In the subsequent battle of Marlborough <NOTE N="134" PLACE="foot">At Beran-birig, or Barbury-castle, near Marlborough. The Saxon chronicle assigns the name and date.

according to the principles of Roman tac∣tics. The Saxons charged in one weighty co∣lumn, boldly encountered with their short swords the long lances of the Britons, and maintained an equal conflict till the approach of night. Two decisive victories, the death of three British kings, and the reduction of Cirencester, Bath, and Gloucester, established the fame and power of Ceaulin, the grandson of Cerdic, who carried his victorious arms to the banks of the Severn.</P>
<P>After a war of an hundred years, the independent <NOTE PLACE="marg">and flight.</NOTE> Britons still occupied the whole extent of the Western coast, from the wall of Antoninus to the extreme promontory of Cornwall; and the prin∣cipal cities of the inland country still opposed the arms of the Barbarians. Resistance became more languid, as the number and boldness of the as∣sailants continually increased. Winning their way by slow and painful efforts, the Saxons, the Angles, and their various confederates, advanced from the North, from the East, and from the South, till their victorious banners were united in the centre of the island. Beyond the Severn the Britons still asserted their national freedom, which survived the heptarchy, and even the monarchy, of the Saxons. The bravest warriors, who pre∣ferred exile to slavery, found a secure refuge in the mountains of Wales: the reluctant submission of Cornwall was delayed for some ages <NOTE N="135" PLACE="foot">Cornwall was finally subdued by Athelstan (A.

D. 461. or rather 481.), the army of Riothamus, and the loose declamation of Gildas (alii transmarinas petebant regiones, c. 25. p. 8.), may countenance an emigration as early as the middle of the fifth century. Beyond that aera, the Britons of Armorica can be found only in romance; and I am sur∣prized that Mr. Whitaker (Genuine History of the Britons, p. 214—221.) should so faithfully transcribe the gross ignorance of Carte, whose venial errors he has so rigorously chastised.</NOTE>.

In a century of perpetual, or at least impla∣cable, war, much courage, and some skill, must have been exerted for the defence of Britain. Yet <NOTE PLACE="marg">The fame of Arthur.</NOTE> if the memory of its champions is almost buried in oblivion, we need not repine; since every age, however destitute of science or virtue, sufficiently abounds with acts of blood and military renown. The tomb of Vortimer, the son of Vortigern, was erected on the margin of the sea-shore, as a landmark formidable to the Saxons, whom he had thrice vanquished in the fields of Kent. Ambro∣sius Aurelian was descended from a noble family of Romans <NOTE N="138" PLACE="foot">Bede, who in his chronicle (p. 28.) places Ambrosius under the reign of Zeno (A. D. 474—491.), observes, that his parents had been "purpurâ induti;" which he explains, in his ecclesiastical history, by "regium nomen et insigne ferentibus" (l. i. c. 16. p. 53.). The expression of Nennius (c. 44. p. 110. edit.

According to the most rational ac∣count,

he defeated, in twelve successive battles, the Angles of the North, and the Saxons of the West; but the declining age of the hero was em∣bittered by popular ingratitude, and domestic mis∣fortunes. The events of his life are less interest∣ing, than the singular revolutions of his fame. During a period of five hundred years the tradition of his exploits was preserved, and rudely embel∣lished, by the obscure bards of Wales and Armo∣rica, who were odious to the Saxons, and un∣known to the rest of mankind. The pride and curiosity of the Norman conquerors, prompted them to enquire into the ancient history of Bri∣tain: they listened with fond credulity to the tale of Arthur, and eagerly applauded the merit of a prince, who had triumphed over the Saxons, their common enemies. His romance, transcribed in the Latin of Jeffrey of Monmouth, and afterwards translated into the fashionable idiom of the times, was enriched with the various, though incoherent, ornaments, which were familiar to the experience, the learning, or the fancy, of the twelfth century. The progress of a Phrygian colony, from the Ty∣ber to the Thames, was easily engrafted on the fable of the Aeneid; and the royal ancestors of Arthur derived their origin from Troy, and claimed their alliance with the Caesars. His tro∣phies were decorated with captive provinces, and Imperial titles; and his Danish victories avenged the recent injuries of his country. The gallantry and superstition of the British hero, his feasts and tournaments, and the memorable institution of

his Knights of the <HI>Round Table,</HI> were faithfully copied from the reigning manners of chivalry; and the fabulous exploits of Uther's son, appear less incredible, than the adventures which were atchieved by the enterprising valour of the Nor∣mans. Pilgrimage, and the holy wars, intro∣duced into Europe the specious miracles of Ara∣bian magic. Fairies, and giants, flying dragons, and enchanted palaces, were blended with the more simple sictions of the West; and the fate of Britain depended on the art, or the predictions, of Merlin. Every nation embraced and adorned the popular romance of Arthur, and the Knights of the Round Table: their names were celebrated in Greece and Italy; and the voluminous tales of Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristram were devoutly studied by the princes and nobles, who disregarded the genuine heroes and historians of antiquity. At length the light of science and reason was re∣kindled; the talisman was broken; the visionary fabric melted into air; and by a natural, though unjust, reverse of the public opinion, the severity of the present age is inclined to question the <HI>ex∣istence</HI> of Arthur <NOTE N="140" PLACE="foot">The progress of romance, and the state of learning, in the middle ages, are illustrated by Mr. Thomas Wharton, with the taste of a poet, and the minute diligence of an antiquarian.

The arts and religion, the laws and language, which the Romans had so carefully planted in Britain, were extirpated by their barbarous successors. After the destruction of the principal churches, the bishops, who had declined the crown of martyrdom, retired with the holy relics into Wales and Armorica; the remains of their flocks were left destitute of any spiritual food; the practice, and even the remembrance, of Christianity were abolished; and the British clergy might obtain some comfort from the damnation of the idolatrous strangers. The kings of France maintained the privileges of their Roman subjects; but the ferocious Saxons trampled on the laws of Rome, and of the emperors. The proceedings

Yet they continued to reign over the East, from the Da∣nube to the Nile and Tigris; the Gothic and Vandal kingdoms of Italy and Africa were sub∣verted by the arms of Justinian; and the history of the <HI>Greek</HI> emperors may still afford a long series of instructive lessons, and interesting re∣volutions.</P>

<HEAD>General Observations on the Fall of the Roman Empire in the West.</HEAD>
<P>THE Greeks, after their country had been reduced into a province, imputed the tri∣umphs of Rome, not to the merit, but to the FORTUNE, of the republic. The inconstant god∣dess, who so blindly distributes and resumes her favours, had <HI>now</HI> consented (such was the lan∣guage of envious flattery) to resign her wings, to descend from her globe, and to fix her firm and immutable throne on the banks of the Tyber <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Such are the figurative expressions of Plutarch (Opera, tom. ii. p. 318. edit. Wechel), to whom, on the faith of his son Lamprias (Fabricius, Bibliot. Graec. tom. iii. p. 341.), I shall boldly impute the malicious declamation, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The same opi∣nions had prevailed among the Greeks two hundred and fifty years before Plutarch; and to confute them, is the professed intention of Polybius (Hist. l. i. p. 90. edit. Gronov. Amstel. 1670.).</NOTE>. A wiser Greek, who has composed, with a phi∣losophic spirit, the memorable history of his own times, deprived his countrymen of this vain and delusive comfort, by opening to their view the deep foundations of the greatness of Rome <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See the inestimable remains of the sixth book of Polybius, and many other parts of his general history, particularly a digression in the seventeenth book, in which he compares the phalanx and the legion.</NOTE>. The fidelity of the citizens to each other, and to the state, was confirmed by the habits of education, and the prejudices of religion. Honour, as well as virtue, was the principle of the republic; the ambitious citizens laboured to deserve the solemn
<PB N="406" REF="415"/>
glories of a triumph; and the ardour of the Ro∣man youth was kindled into active emulation, as often as they beheld the domestic images of their ancestors <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Sallust, de Bell. Jugurthin. c. 4. Such were the generous pro∣fessions of P. Scipio and Q. Maximus. The Latin historian had read, and most probably transcribes, Polybius, their contemporary and friend.</NOTE>. The temperate struggles of the pa∣tricians and plebeians had finally established the firm and equal balance of the constitution; which united the freedom of popular assemblies, with the authority and wisdom of a senate, and the executive powers of a regal magistrate. When the consul displayed the standard of the republic, each citizen bound himself, by the obligation of an oath, to draw his sword in the cause of his country, till he had discharged the sacred duty by a military service of ten years. This wise insti∣tution continually poured into the field the ri∣sing generations of freemen and soldiers; and their numbers were reinforced by the warlike and populous states of Italy, who, after a brave resist∣ance, had yielded to the valour, and embraced the alliance, of the Romans. The sage historian, who excited the virtue of the younger Scipio, and beheld the ruin of Carthage <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">While Carthage was in flames, Scipio repeated two lines of the Iliad, which express the destruction of Troy, acknowledging to Po∣lybius, his friend and preceptor (Polyb. in Excerpt. de Virtut. et Vit. tom. ii. p. 1455—1465). that while he recollected the vicissi∣tudes of human affairs, he inwardly applied them to the future cala∣mities of Rome (Appian. in Libycis, p. 136. edit. Toll.).</NOTE>, has accurately described their military system; their levies, arms, exercises, subordination, marches, encampments;
<PB N="407" REF="416"/>
and the invincible legion, superior in active strength to the Macedonian phalanx of Philip and Alexander. From these institutions of peace and war, Polybius has deduced the spirit and success of a people, incapable of fear, and impatient of repose. The ambitious design of conquest, which might have been defeated by the seasonable con∣spiracy of mankind, was attempted and atchiev∣ed; and the perpetual violation of justice was maintained by the political virtues of prudence and courage. The arms of the republic, some∣times vanquished in battle, always victorious in war, advanced with rapid steps to the Euphrates, the Danube, the Rhine, and the Ocean; and the images of gold, or silver, or brass, that might serve to represent the nations and their kings, were successively broken by the <HI>iron</HI> monarchy of Rome <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">See Daniel ii. 31—40. <Q REND="inline">"And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as <HI>iron;</HI> forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces, and subdueth all things."</Q> The remainder of the prophecy (the mixture of iron and <HI>clay)</HI> was accomplished, according to St. Jerom, in his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime. Sicut enim in principio nihil Romano Imperio fortius et du∣rius, ita in sine rerum nihil imbecillius: quum et in bellis civilibus et adversus diversas nationes, aliarum gentium barbararum auxilio indigemus (Opera, tom. v. p. 572.).</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The rise of a city, which swelled into an empire, may deserve, as a singular prodigy, the reflection of a philosophic mind. But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial
<PB N="408" REF="417"/>
supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. The story of its ruin is simple and obvious; and instead of enquiring <HI>why</HI> the Roman empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long. The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which ren∣dered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military government was relaxed, and finally dissolved, by the partial institutions of Constantine; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.</P>
<P>The decay of Rome has been frequently ascrib∣ed to the translation of the seat of empire; but this history has already shewn, that the powers of government were <HI>divided,</HI> rather than <HI>removed.</HI> The throne of Constantinople was erected in the East; while the West was still possessed by a series of emperors who held their residence in Italy, and claimed their equal inheritance of the legions and provinces. This dangerous novelty impaired the strength, and fomented the vices, of a double reign: the instruments of an oppressive and arbitrary system were multiplied; and a vain emulation of luxury, not of merit, was intro∣duced and supported between the degenerate
<PB N="409" REF="418"/>
successors of Theodosius. Extreme distress, which unites the virtue of a free people, embitters the factions of a declining monarchy. The hostile favourites of Arcadius and Honorius betrayed the republic to its common enemies; and the Byzan∣tine court beheld with indifference, perhaps with pleasure, the disgrace of Rome, the misfortunes of Italy, and the loss of the West. Under the succeeding reigns, the alliance of the two empires was restored; but the aid of the Oriental Romans was tardy, doubtful, and ineffectual; and the national schism of the Greeks and Latins was enlarged by the perpetual difference of language and manners, of interest, and even of religion. Yet the salutary event approved in some measure the judgment of Constantine. During a long period of decay, his impregnable city repelled the victorious armies of Barbarians, protected the wealth of Asia, and commanded, both in peace and war, the important streights which connect the Euxine and Mediterranean seas. The foun∣dation of Constantinople more essentially con∣tributed to the preservation of the East, than to the ruin of the West.</P>
<P>As the happiness of a <HI>future</HI> life is the great object of religion, we may hear without surprise or scandal, that the introduction, or at least the abuse, of Christianity, had some influence on the decline and fall of the Roman empire. The clergy successfully preached the doctrines of pa∣tience and pusillanimity; the active virtues of society were discouraged; and the last remains
<PB N="410" REF="419"/>
of military spirit were buried in the cloyster: a large portion of public and private wealth was consecrated to the specious demands of charity and devotion; and the soldiers pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes, who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity. Faith, zeal, curiosity, and the more earthly pas∣sions of malice and ambition, kindled the flame of theological discord; the church, and even the state, were distracted by religious factions, whose conflicts were sometimes bloody, and always implacable; the attention of the emperors was diverted from camps to synods; the Roman world was oppressed by a new species of tyranny; and the persecuted sects became the secret enemies of their country. Yet party-spirit, however per∣nicious or absurd, is a principle of union as well as of dissention. The bishops, from eighteen hundred pulpits, inculcated the duty of passive obedience to a lawful and orthodox sovereign; their frequent assemblies, and perpetual corre∣spondence, maintained the communion of distant churches; and the benevolent temper of the go∣spel was strengthened, though confined, by the spiritual alliance of the Catholics. The sacred indolence of the monks was devoutly embraced by a servile and effeminate age; but if supersti∣tion had not afforded a decent retreat, the same vices would have tempted the unworthy Romans to desert, from baser motives, the standard of the republic. Religious precepts are easily obeyed, which indulge and sanctify the natural inclinations
<PB N="411" REF="420"/>
of their votaries; but the pure and genuine influ∣ence of Christianity may be traced in its beneficial, though imperfect, effects on the Barbarian pro∣selytes of the North. If the decline of the Roman empire was hastened by the conversion of Con∣stantine, his victorious religion broke the violence of the fall, and mollified the ferocious temper of the conquerors.</P>
<P>This awful revolution may be usefully applied to the instruction of the present age. It is the duty of a patriot to prefer and promote the ex∣clusive interest and glory of his native country: but a philosopher may be permitted to enlarge his views, and to consider Europe as one great republic, whose various inhabitants have attained almost the same level of politeness and cultivation. The balance of power will continue to fluctuate, and the prosperity of our own, or the neighbour∣ing kingdoms, may be alternately exalted or de∣pressed; but these partial events cannot essen∣tially injure our general state of happiness, the system of arts, and laws, and manners, which so advantageously distinguish, above the rest of man∣kind, the Europeans and their colonies. The savage nations of the globe are the common ene∣mies of civilised society; and we may inquire with anxious curiosity, whether Europe is still threatened with a repetition of those calamities, which formerly oppressed the arms and institu∣tions of Rome. Perhaps the same reflections will illustrate the fall of that mighty empire, and explain the probable causes of our actual security.</P>

I. The Romans were ignorant of the extent of their danger, and the number of their enemies. Beyond the Rhine and Danube, the northern countries of Europe and Asia were filled with innumerable tribes of hunters and shepherds, poor, voracious, and turbulent; bold in arms, and impatient to ravish the fruits of industry. The Barbarian world was agitated by the rapid impulse of war; and the peace of Gaul or Italy was shaken by the distant revolutions of China. The Huns, who fled before a victorious enemy, directed their march towards the West; and the torrent was swelled by the gradual accession of captives and allies. The flying tribes who yielded to the Huns, assumed in <HI>their</HI> turn the spirit of conquest; the endless column of Barbarians pressed on the Roman empire with accumulated weight; and, if the foremost were destroyed, the vacant space was instantly replenished by new assailants. Such formidable emigrations can no longer issue from the North; and the long repose, which has been imputed to the decrease of population, is the happy consequence of the progress of arts and agriculture. Instead of some rude villages, thinly scattered among its woods and morasses, Germany now produces a list of two thousand three hundred walled towns: the Christian kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden, and Poland have been successively established; and the Hanse merchants, with the Teutonic knights, have extended their colonies along the coast of the Baltic, as far as the Gulf of Finland. From
<PB N="413" REF="422"/>
the Gulf of Finland to the Eastern Ocean, Russia now assumes the form of a powerful and civilised empire. The plough, the loom, and the forge are introduced on the banks of the Volga, the Oby, and the Lena; and the fiercest of the Tar∣tar hords have been taught to tremble and obey. The reign of independent Barbarism is now con∣tracted to a narrow span; and the remnant of Calmucks or Uzbecks, whose forces may be al∣most numbered, cannot seriously excite the ap∣prehensions of the great republic of Europe <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">The French and English editors of the Genealogical History of the Tartars have subjoined a curious, though imperfect, descrip∣tion of their present state. We might question the independence of the Calmucks, or Eluths, since they have been recently vanquished by the Chinese, who, in the year 1759, subdued the lesser Bucharia, and advanced into the country of Badakshan, near the sources of the Oxus (Memoires sur les Chinois, tom. i. p. 325—400.). But these conquests are precarious, nor will I venture to ensure the safety of the Chinese empire.</NOTE>. Yet this apparent security should not tempt us to forget that new enemies, and unknown dangers, may <HI>possibly</HI> arise from some obscure people, scarcely visible in the map of the world. The Arabs or Saracens, who spread their conquests from India to Sapin, had languished in poverty and contempt, till Mahomet breathed into those savage bodies the soul of enthusiasm.</P>
<P N="2">II. The empire of Rome was firmly established by the singular and perfect coalition of its mem∣bers. The subject nations, resigning the hope, and even the wish, of independence, embraced the character of Roman citizens; and the pro∣vinces of the West were reluctantly torn by the
<PB N="414" REF="423" MS="y"/>
Barbarians from the bosom of their mother∣country <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">The prudent reader will determine how far this general propo∣sition is weakened by the revolt of the Isaurians, the independence of Britain and Armorica, the Moorish tribes, or the Bagaudae of Gaul and Spain (vol. i. p. 240. vol. iii. p. 273. 337. 434.).</NOTE>. But this union was purchased by the loss of national freedom and military spirit; and the servile provinces, destitute of life and motion, expected their safety from the mercenary troops and governors, who were directed by the orders of a distant court. The happiness of an hundred millions depended on the personal merit of one, or two, men, perhaps children, whose minds were corrupted by education, luxury, and despotic power. The deepest wounds were in∣flicted on the empire during the minorities of the sons and grandsons of Theodosius; and after those incapable princes seemed to attain the age of manhood, they abandoned the church to the bishops, the state to the eunuchs, and the provinces to the Barbarians. Europe is now divided into twelve powerful, though un∣equal, kingdoms, three respectable common∣wealths, and a variety of smaller, though inde∣pendent, states: the chances of royal and ministerial talents are multiplied, at least, with the number of its rulers; and a Julian, or Semi∣ramis, may reign in the North, while Arcadius and Honorius again slumber on the thrones of the South. The abuses of tyranny are restrained by the mutual influence of fear and shame; re∣publics have acquired order and stability; mo∣narchies have imbibed the principles of freedom,
<PB N="415" REF="424"/>
or, at least, of moderation; and some sense of honour and justice is introduced into the most defective constitutions by the general manners of the times. In peace, the progress of knowledge and industry is accelerated by the emulation of so many active rivals: in war, the European forces are exercised by temperate and undecisive contests. If a savage conqueror should issue from the deserts of Tartary, he must repeatedly van∣quish the robust peasants of Russia, the numerous armies of Germany, the gallant nobles of France, and the intrepid freemen of Britain; who, per∣haps, might confederate for their common de∣fence. Should the victorious Barbarians carry slavery and desolation as far as the Atlantic Ocean, ten thousand vessels would transport be∣yond their pursuit the remains of civilised society; and Europe would revive and flourish in the American world, which is already filled with her colonies, and institutions <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">America now contains about six millions of European blood and descent; and their numbers, at least in the North, are conti∣nually increasing. Whatever may be the changes of their political situation, they must preserve the manners of Europe; and we may reflect with some pleasure, that the English language will probably be diffused over an immense and populous continent.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">III. Cold, poverty, and a life of danger and fatigue, fortify the strength and courage of Bar∣barians. In every age they have oppressed the polite and peaceful nations of China, India, and Persia, who neglected, and still neglect, to coun∣terbalance these natural powers by the resources of military art. The warlike states of antiquity,
<PB N="416" REF="425"/>
Greece, Macedonia, and Rome, educated a race of soldiers; exercised their bodies, disciplined their courage, multiplied their forces by regular evolutions, and converted the iron, which they possessed, into strong and serviceable weapons. But this superiority insensibly declined with their laws and manners; and the feeble policy of Con∣stantine and his successors armed and instructed, for the ruin of the empire, the rude valour of the Barbarian mercenaries. The military art has been changed by the invention of gunpowder; which enables man to command the two most powerful agents of nature, air and fire. Mathe∣matics, chymistry, mechanics, architecture, have been applied to the service of war; and the ad∣verse parties oppose to each other the most ela∣borate modes of attack and of defence. Histo∣rians may indignantly observe, that the prepara∣tions of a siege would found and maintain a flourishing colony <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">On avoit fait venir (for the siege of Turin) 140 pieces de canon; et il est à remarquer que chaque gros canon monté revient à environ 2000 ecus: il y avoit 110,000 boulets; 106,000 cartouches d'une façon, et 300,000 d'une autre; 21,000 bombes; 27,700 gre∣nades, 15,000 facs à terre, 30,000 instrumens pour le pionnage; 1,200,000 livres de poudre. Ajoutez à ces munitions, le plomb, le fer, et le fer-blanc, les cordages, tout ce qui ser. aux mineurs, le souphre, le salpêtre, les outils de toute espece. Il est certain que les frais de tous ces préparatiss de destruction suffiroient pour fonder et pour faire fleurir la plus nombreuse colonie. Voltaire, Siécle de Louis XIV. c. xx. in his Works, tom. xi. p. 391.</NOTE>; yet we cannot be displeased, that the subversion of a city should be a work of cost and difficulty; or that an industrious people should be protected by those arts, which survive
<PB N="417" REF="426"/>
and supply the decay of military virtue. Cannon and fortifications now form an impregnable bar∣rier against the Tartar horse; and Europe is secure from any future irruption of Barbarians; since, before they can conquer, they must cease to be barbarous. Their gradual advances in the science of war would always be accompanied, as we may learn from the example of Russia, with a proportionable improvement in the arts of peace and civil policy; and they themselves must de∣serve a place among the polished nations whom they subdue.</P>
<P>Should these speculations be found doubtful or fallacious, there still remains a more humble source of comfort and hope. The discoveries of ancient and modern navigators, and the do∣mestic history, or tradition, of the most en∣lightened nations, represent the <HI>human savage,</HI> naked both in mind and body, and destitute of laws, of arts, of ideas, and almost of language <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">It would be an easy, though tedious task, to produce the authorities of poets, philosophers, and historians. I shall therefore content myself with appealing to the decisive and authentic testimony of Diodorus Siculus (tom. i. l. i. p. 11, 12. l. iii. p. 184, &amp;c. edit. Wesseling.). The Icthyophagi, who in his time wandered along the shores of the Red Sea, can only be compared to the natives of New Holland (Dampier's Voyages, vol. i. p. 464—469.). Fancy, or perhaps reason, may still suppose an extreme and absolute state of nature far below the level of these savages, who had acquired some arts and instruments.</NOTE>. From this abject condition, perhaps the primitive and universal state of man, he has gradually arisen to command the animals, to fertilise the earth, to traverse the ocean, and to measure the
<PB N="418" REF="427"/>
heavens. His progress in the improvement and exercise of his mental and corporeal faculties <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">See the learned and rational work of the President Goguet, de l'Origine des Loix, des Arts et des Sciences. He traces from facts, or conjectures (tom. i. p. 147—337, edit. 12mo.), the first and most difficult steps of human invention.</NOTE> has been irregular and various; infinitely slow in the beginning, and increasing by degrees with redoubled velocity: ages of laborious ascent have been followed by a moment of rapid down∣fal; and the several climates of the globe have felt the vicissitudes of light and darkness. Yet the experience of four thousand years should enlarge our hopes, and diminish our apprehen∣sions: we cannot determine to what height the human species may aspire in their advances to∣wards perfection; but it may safely be presumed, that no people, unless the face of nature is changed, will relapse into their original bar∣barism. The improvements of society may be viewed under a threefold aspect. 1. The poet or philosopher illustrates his age and country by the efforts of a <HI>single</HI> mind; but these superior powers of reason or fancy are rare and sponta∣neous productions; and the genius of Homer, or Cicero, or Newton, would excite less admira∣tion, if they could be created by the will of a prince, or the lessons of a preceptor. 2. The benefits of law and policy, of trade and manu∣factures, of arts and sciences, are more solid and permanent; and <HI>many</HI> individuals may be quali∣fied, by education and discipline, to promote, in their respective stations, the interest of the com∣munity.
<PB N="419" REF="428"/>
But this general order is the effect of skill and labour; and the complex machinery may be decayed by time, or injured by violence. 3. Fortunately for mankind, the more useful, or, at least, more necessary arts, can be per∣formed without superior talents, or national subordination; without the powers of <HI>one,</HI> or the union of <HI>many.</HI> Each village, each family, each individual, must always possess both ability and inclination, to perpetuate the use of fire <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">It is certain, however strange, that many nations have been ignorant of the use of fire. Even the ingenious natives of Otaheite, who are destitute of metals, have not invented any earthen vessels capable of sustaining the action of fire, and of communicating the heat to the liquids which they contain.</NOTE> and of metals; the propagation and service of do∣mestic animals; the methods of hunting and fishing; the rudiments of navigation; the imper∣fect cultivation of corn, or other nutritive grain; and the simple practice of the mechanic trades. Private genius and public industry may be extir∣tirpated; but these hardy plants survive the tempest, and strike an everlasting root into the most unfavourable soil. The splendid days of Augustus and Trajan were eclipsed by a cloud of ignorance; and the Barbarians subverted the laws and palaces of Rome. But the scythe, the invention or emblem of Saturn <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">Plutarch. Quaest. Rom. in tom. ii. p. 275. Macrob. Saturnal. l. i. c. 8. p. 152. edit. London. The arrival of Saturn (of his re∣ligious worship) in a ship, may indicate, that the savage coast of Latium was first discovered and civilised by the Phoenicians.</NOTE>, still con∣tinued annually to mow the harvests of Italy;
<PB N="420" REF="429"/>
and the human feasts of the Laestrigons <NOTE N="14" PLACE="foot">In the ninth and tenth books of the Odyssey, Homer has em∣bellished the tales of fearful and credulous sailors, who transformed the cannibals of Italy and Sicily into monstrous giants.</NOTE> have never been renewed on the coast of Campania.</P>
<P>Since the first discovery of the arts, war, commerce, and religious zeal have diffused, among the savages of the Old and New World, these inestimable gifts: they have been succes∣sively propagated; they can never be lost. We may therefore acquiesce in the pleasing conclu∣sion, that every age of the world has increased, and still increases, the real wealth, the happi∣ness, the knowledge, and perhaps the virtue, of the human race <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">The merit of discovery has too often been stained with avarice, cruelty, and fanaticism; and the intercourse of nations has produced the communication of disease and prejudice. A singular exception is due to the virtue of our own times and country. The five great voyages successively undertaken by the command of his present Ma∣jesty, were inspired by the pure and generous love of science and of mankind. The same prince, adapting his benefactions to the diffe∣rent stages of society, has founded a school of painting in his capital; and has introduced into the islands of the South Sea, the vegetables and animals most useful to human life.</NOTE>.</P>
