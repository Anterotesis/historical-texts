<HEAD>To all the Generous Encouragers of <HI>Female In∣genuity,</HI> this <HI>Play</HI> is Humbly Dedicated.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen and Ladies;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY Muse chose to make this Universal Address, hoping, among the numerous Crowd, to find some Souls Great enough to protect her against the Carping Malice of the Vulgar World; who think it a proof of their Sense, to dislike every thing that is writ by Women. I was the more induc'd to this General Application, from the Usage I have met on all sides.</P>
<P>A Play secretly introduc'd to the House, whilst the Au∣thor remains unknown, is approv'd by every Body: The Actors cry it up, and are in expectation of a great Run; the Bookseller of a Second Edition, and the Scribler of a Sixth Night: But if by chance the Plot's discover'd, and the Brat found Fatherless, immediately it flags in the Opini∣on of those that extoll'd it before, and the Bookseller falls in his Price, with this Reason only, <HI>It is a Woman's.</HI> Thus they alter their Judgment, by the Esteem they have for the Author, tho' the Play is still the same. They ne'er re∣flect, that we have had some Male-Productions of this kind, void of Plot and Wit, and full as insipid as ever a Wo∣man's of us all.</P>
<P>I can't forbear inserting a Story which my Bookseller, that printed my <HI>Gamester,</HI> told me, of a Spark that had seen my <HI>Gamester</HI> three or four times, and lik'd it extremely: Having bought one of the Books, ask'd who the Author was; and be∣ing told, a Woman, threw down the Book, and put up his Money, saying, he had spent too much after it already, and was sure if the Town had known that, it wou'd never have run ten days. No doubt this was a Wit in his own Eyes. It is such as these that rob us of that which inspires the Poet, Praise. And it is such as these made him that Printed my Comedy call'd, <HI>Love's Contrivance;</HI> or, <HI>Medin</HI>
<PB REF="3"/>
<HI>cin Malgre lui,</HI> put two Letters of a wrong Name to it; which tho' it was the height of Injustice to me, yet his imposing on the Town turn'd to account with him; and thus passing for a Man's, it has been play'd at least a hun∣dred times.</P>
<P>And why this Wrath against the Womens Works? Per∣haps you'll answer, because they meddle with things out of their Sphere: But I say, no; for since the Poet is born, why not a Woman as well as a Man? Not that I wou'd derogate from those great Men who have a Genius, and Learning to improve that Genius: I only object against those ill-natur'd Criticks, who wanting both, think they have a sufficient claim to Sense, by railing at what they don't understand. Some have arm'd themselves with re∣solution not to like the Play they paid to see; and if in spite of Spleen they have been pleas'd against their Will, have maliciously reported it was none of mine, but given me by some Gentleman: Nay, even my own Sex, which shou'd assert our Prerogative against such Detractors, are often backward to encourage a Female Pen.</P>
<P>Wou'd these profest Enemies but consider what Examples we have had of Women that excell'd in all Arts; in Musick, Painting, Poetry; also in War: Nay, to our immortal Praise, what Empresses and Queens have fill'd the World? What cannot <HI>England</HI> boast from Women? The mighty <HI>Romans</HI> felt the Power of <HI>Boadicea</HI>'s Arm; <HI>Eliza</HI> made <HI>Spain</HI> trem∣ble; but <HI>ANN,</HI> the greatest of the Three, has shook the Man that aim'd at Universal Sway. After naming this Mi∣racle, the Glory of our Sex, sure none will spitefully cavil at the following Scenes, purely because a Woman writ'em. This I dare venture to say in their behalf, there is a Plot and Story in them, I hope will entertain the Reader; which is the utmost Ambition of,</P>

<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. <HI>Betterton.</HI></STAGE>
<L>REjoice, ye Fair, the <HI>British</HI> Warrior's come,</L>
<L>Victorious o're, to your soft Wars at home.</L>
<L>Each Conqueror flies, with eager Longing's fraught,</L>
<L>To clasp the Darling Fair, for which he fought.</L>
<L>He lays his Trophies down before those Eyes,</L>
<L>By which Inspir'd, he won the Glorious Prize.</L>
<L>Prouder, when wellcom'd by his Generous Fair,</L>
<L>Of dying in her Arms, than Conquering there.</L>
<L>O! cou'd our Bards of <HI>Britains</HI> Isle but write</L>
<L>With the same Fire with which our Hero's fight:</L>
<L>Or cou'd our Stage but represent a Scene,</L>
<L>To Copy that on great <HI>Ramillis</HI> Plain;</L>
<L>Then we with Courage wou'd assert our Plays,</L>
<L>And to your glorious Laurels joyn our Bays.</L>
<L>But our poor <HI>Pegasus,</HI> a Beast of ease,</L>
<L>Cares not for foraging beyond the Seas:</L>
<L>Content with <HI>London</HI> Provender, he flyes,</L>
<L>To make each Coxcomb he can find, a Prize:</L>
<L>And after trudging long, perhaps he may</L>
<L>Pick up a Set of Fools, to furnish out a Play.</L>
<L>To make him Eat, and you to Entertain.</L>
<L>That for his safety fought beyond the Main.</L>
<L>Your Courage There, but Here your Mercy show;</L>
<L>The Brave scorn to insult a Prostrate Poe.</L>

<L>TO you, the Tyrant Criticks of the Age,</L>

<L>Whilst vanquish'd Wit, shrunk from her Native-Glory,</L>
<L>Like the Cow'd <HI>Gaul,</HI> too weakly stands before Ye.</L>
<L>Since then the Poets play this Loosing Game,</L>
<L>I, a poor Suppliant in the Muses Name,</L>
<L>Beg to avert our trembling Author's Fate;</L>
<L>And, like the sad <HI>Bavarian</HI> Advocate,</L>
<L>Resistance Vain, we to your Mercy fly.</L>
<L>And court you now to lay your Thunder by.</L>

One Lady proves so fond, or rather mad,</L>
<L>She'd fain confess a Child she never had.</L>
<L>Alas! how many Nymphs about this Town,</L>

<L>Then a West-country Dam'sel trots to Town,</L>
<L>And talks of Paint, False-hair, and Rumpt-up-Gown,</L>
<L>Things which to Men shou'd never be reveal'd,</L>
<L>But equally with Cuckoldom conceal'd.</L>
<L>Yet, tell me, Sirs, don't you as nice appear,</L>
<L>With your false Calves, Bardash, and Fav'rites here?</L>

<L>Young Templers too, with upstart forward Graces,</L>
<L>When Pummis-stone has travell'd o're their Faces,</L>
<L>March hither, where Mobb'd Hoods too often ply,</L>
<L>And want a Lodging, tho' Six-stories high;</L>
<L>Where the fond Youth the modest Dame implores,</L>
<L>And at Day-break ejects her out of Doors.</L>
<L>Some Cheapside-Bobbs too trudge it to our Play,</L>
<L>Faith, <HI>Jack,</HI> this <HI>Hay-Market's</HI> a cursed way:</L>
<L>What signifie the Quality or Wits,</L>
<L>The Money, <HI>Daniel,</HI> rises from us Cits.</L>
<L>Who, like Cock-Sparrows, hop about the Benches,</L>
<L>And court, with Six-pences, fat Orange-Wenches.</L>
<L>In short, you Men have more Fantastick ways,</L>
<L>More Follies, than can e're be stuft in Plays:</L>

<P>AS I was saying, Sir, I have advanc'd the Expences of our Summers Expedition from <HI>Epsom</HI> to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> from <HI>Tun∣bridge</HI> to the <HI>Bath,</HI> and from thence to <HI>London</HI> here; where instead of Board-wages, I have liv'd upon Hopes that some of these Places wou'd furnish you with a Bubble, and me with my Money; but I see no appearance of it: Therefore pray let you and I dis∣count.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, <HI>Equipage,</HI> have but Patience to see what this Winter produces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Equi.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; the Affront you put upon me at <HI>Tun∣bridge</HI> I can't forget, when you had lost fifty Guineas to the Knight upon Honour, and pretended you had sent
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
me Post to <HI>London</HI> to your Scrutore for the Money, and that I had robb'd you and run away with your Keys; when you ordered me to keep out of the way till he had left the Town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou know'st I had no other quibble to avoid paying the Debt, and quitting the Place with Honour: Come, don't reflect upon my Misfortune; we have seen better Summers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Equi.</SPEAKER>
<P>In troth, Sir, I thought <HI>Bath</HI> promis'd well; I am sure 'twas very full of Company; and if you had not fallen in Love, you might have paid me out of the Subscription.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>How must I have liv'd like a Gentleman then, Sirrah? I shall break your Head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Equi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have done upon that Subject, Sir; I only desire my Discharge and Wages; that's all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know what you ask, <HI>Equipage?</HI> A Gamester and a Soldier are both Sons of Fortune; now to quit my Service, is directly to embroil your self with Fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Equi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been embroil'd with her from the first Day I enter'd into your Service: But I thank my Stars I am a∣bove Fortune, and design to forsake the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, forsake the World!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Equi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I have lately made some moral Reflecti∣ons on the Uncertainty of worldly Pleasures. I am weary of being well beaten, and ill fed; of passing the Night at a Tavern Door, and the Day in carrying Messages from one Miss to another. In short, Sir, I am weary of the subservient Title, without the subservient Money, and resolve to marry; that is, when I can find a Woman that deserves me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>A difficult matter truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Equi.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is, Sir; but this Digression makes you for∣get that there is a small Rule in Arithmetick to be adjust∣ed. I have serv'd you these eight Years at twenty-five
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
Crowns a Year, which in plain <HI>English</HI> is forty-two Pounds Sterling; of which I have received now and then a broken Pate: Nevertheless there remains two and forty Pounds; which I desire you'd give me immediately, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two and Forty Pounds—a great deal of Mo∣ney—eight Years Service; Mercy upon me! How have I had Patience to endure this Dog so long?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Equi.</SPEAKER>
<P>How have I had Patience to stay thus long for my Wages?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are not you a Rogue, Sirrah?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Equi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>And deserve to be hang'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Equi.</SPEAKER>
<P>As Affairs stands now it seems. Whilst I was silent I was a very honest Fellow; but now I ask for my Wages, I'm fit for the Gallows: Faith, Sir, you might be a Duke by your Conscience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sirrah, you know I am good natur'd; hang me if I am not very unwilling to part with thee: I will not turn thee away, go get my Cloak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Equi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Turn me away! why, 'tis not you that turn me away; 'tis I that turn you away, if you go to that.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, we won't dispute about that; thou shalt not leave me.</P>
</SP>

<P>Be pleas'd to pay me then; for I design the Mo∣ney for my Wife's Jointure: Look ye, Sir, here's the Re∣ceipt ready.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Devil's in the Fellow, I think; thy Noddle runs of nothing but thy own Business; prithee let's think a little of mine. Mrs. <HI>Brazen</HI> the Match-maker, is to help me to a <HI>Somersetshire</HI> Widow worth fifty thousand Pound; she's just come to Town.</P>

<P>I can't imagine from whence proceeds this change. You that us'd to love Parks, Plays, Balls, Drawing-Rooms, Picquet, Baslett, and such nice Conversation: You'd not endure my Lady <HI>Lockup,</HI> because she entertain'd you with nothing but railing at her Servants; of their Waste, and her good House-wifery; nor Mr. <HI>Self-love,</HI> because he always got to the Glass before you; my Lady <HI>Wrinkle</HI> laid on too much White, and my Lady <HI>Blouze</HI> too much Red, and Mrs. <HI>Coquet</HI> engross'd the whole Company: My Lady <HI>Prattle</HI> fill'd your Ears with the Beauty and Wit of her Children.</P>

<P>Why then, I wrack my poor Brain in finding out why you spend so much time with your Country Cousin, Mrs. <HI>Dowdy;</HI> who is the very reverse of every thing you us'd to admire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charity, <HI>Toylet,</HI> perfect Charity. You know my aukward Cousin wants Instructions: She's left a rich Wi∣dow, and comes to <HI>London</HI> on purpose to Dress and make a Figure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Born and bred in <HI>Somersetshire;</HI> never five Miles from Home before, wore the Cloath of her own Spinning, dain'd to make her own Butter, paid the Labourers their Wages on Work-days, and took a Jigg with them on Holy-days.

<P>Upon my Life thou hast hit it, Girl; I'll not con∣ceal my Plot, since I design thee Chief Instrument. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f you remember, I told you that five Years since I was in <HI>France;</HI> and my Mother's Sister being of the <HI>Romish</HI> Perswa∣sion, had enter'd her self among the <HI>Augustines</HI> in <HI>Paris:</HI> She over-perswaded me to Board there too, hoping (I sup∣pose) from her endeavours to make me quit my Religion, and profess my self a Nun: During my aboad there, this very Gentleman us'd to make me frequent Visits at the Grate; the first time I saw him he came a long with ano∣ther

that paid a Compliment to a young Lady of the same Convent: Our Acquaintance held near two Months. 'Twas then, <HI>Toylet,</HI> that I felt the force of Love, but not without a thousand Protestations of the same from him. But my Father hearing of my Aunts design, and apprehending my Youth, (for I was then not full sixteen) might be prevail'd upon to change my Faith, sent for me to <HI>England</HI> in such haste, that I was not permitted to stay one Hour in the Monastery after the Messenger arri∣ved; so had no opportunity to inform <HI>Belvil</HI> of my De∣parture.</P>

<P>I presume you've kept a Correspondence ever since.</P>

<P>No, I knew not how to direct to him; he told me he had been bred in the <HI>Spanish-Netherlands,</HI> and came to <HI>France</HI> only for his Pleasure: His Parents (he said) were <HI>English,</HI> and he spoke the Language very well.</P>

<P>I cannot love him; it was in my Nonage, and the Barter's illegal; and therefore I'll not Mind it; besides I'm inform'd he is in Love elsewhere, and cares as little for me as I for him; and I would not be a Wife i'th' Mode.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>You brought me into the Danger; I came wounded off, and have no hopes of Cure, but from your roving Temper. You weigh the Sex alike, and without a Pang may give me leave to try my Fortune with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>This comes of carrying a Friend to see one's Mi∣striss. Why, I thought you had been engag'd from your Childhood. Come will you be upon the square, bring me to your Mistriss; if I like her as well as I do <HI>Lucinda,</HI> per∣haps we may agree upon the change.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will: she cannot fail to charm thee; all Eyes, but mine, adore her: And sure 'twas the Malice of our Stars caus'd our Fathers to conclude the Match, where In∣terest only held the Scale, and gentle Love fled from either side: But be serious. How far are you engag'd with <HI>Lu∣cinda?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, 'tis a kind of intricate Story, but you must be satisfied. I have been bred a Soldier of Fortune, and am to this Day ignorant who my Parents were. The Man who took care of me, always told me <HI>England</HI> was my Na∣tive Country, taught me the Language; and for ought I know, some travelling Prince begot me: My Foster-Father was in Battle kill'd, and never gave me farther Light: I had still an Inclination to see this Country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Story seems Romantick—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll think it so before I have done: Being land∣ed, and travelling with my Servant towards <HI>London,</HI> I lost my way; Night came on; when, at a distance, we disco∣vered Lights and made up to 'em. It proved <HI>Lucinda</HI>'s Country House: Her Uncle, Sir <HI>Thomas Beamont,</HI> kindly receiv'd and entertain'd us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lucky Chance!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it prov'd to them; for that very Night her House was beset with Thieves: Their number must have prevail'd but for our unexpected Aid; we beat them off, preserv'd their Wealth, and perhaps their Lives. The La∣dy
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
express'd a thousand Thanks. The old Man grew In∣quisitive, who I was, and whence I came. I frankly told him the Story of my Life: He stood amaz'd, and ask'd me fifty Questions, and seem'd surpriz'd at every Answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; and what ensu'd upon that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he has ever since been mighty fond of me, and forc'd Money upon me, which I could scarcely make him take my Note for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're establish'd every way; his kindness pro∣motes you Interest with his Niece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite contrary: His generous Carriage has oblig'd me to swear to him, never to attempt to marry her, if she should consent without his leave, which he seems still a∣verse to. I confess I love her beyond the rest of her Sex, except one I saw thro' a Grate in <HI>France,</HI> that I could ne∣ver hear of since: yet this restraint keeps me from pressing my Suit for Marriage, and I have too much respect to at∣tempt the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does she know the Injunction?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; that he forbad me too—Besides, she is de∣voted to Platonick Notions</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never mind that in a handsome Woman: This generous Declaration draws another Question, why do you address Mrs. <HI>Dowdy?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's another Injunction of the old Gentle∣man's, to procure the Writings of an Estate out of her Hands, that her Husband cheated a Relation of his of. You see, Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I have a World of Business cut out, and have made you entirely my Confident: No foul play; do ye hear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>There can be none with a Prince that aims at universal Monarchy. But setting Love apart, last Night after you left us, there came a Fellow into the Chocolate-House, who pretended he had made a Campaign in the Nature of a Voluntier; and amongst a number of palpable
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
Lyes, swore, at the Battle of <HI>Blenheim,</HI> he pursu'd a <HI>French</HI> General over the <HI>Danube,</HI> and took him Prisoner on the o∣ther side, then brought him over upon his Back; the E∣nemies Cannon playing at him all the while: The Com∣pany laugh'd: I confess it rais'd my Spleen, and I cou'd not forbear saying, That Action was too Glorious in it self to want a Romance to illustrate it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I suppose you brought a squabble upon your Hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; he swore, look'd big, bluster'd, and walk'd off.</P>

<P>How do you make that out?</P>

<P>Why, when a Man takes his sick Bed, the sad Formalitics that attend it, are more dreadful than Death it self: His Friends and Relations all weeping round his
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
Bed; a Lawyer, brib'd by his Spouse to urge the Will: That made, the Sorrow is finish'd; each then enquire after their Legacy: And the disconsolate Wife having borrow∣ed a Weed of her Neighbour, is consulting her Glass to see how it becomes her. Her Thoughts are where to find another Husband; the Servants Heads full of their Mourn∣ing: So that if the dying Man calls for a Cordial; slap, they give him a Bolous—He desires to be rais'd—They pull away the Pillow.</P>
