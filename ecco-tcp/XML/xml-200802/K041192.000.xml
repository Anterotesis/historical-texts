<L>'TIS May's meridian reign; yet EURUS cold</L>
<L>Forbids each shrinking thorn its leaves unfold,</L>
<L>Or hang with silver buds her rural throne;</L>
<L>No primrose shower from her green lap she throws <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This expression is taken from MILTON's song on May Morning, to which this stanza in general alludes, and the 4th verse in the next.</NOTE>,</L>
<L>No daisy, violet, or cowslip blows,</L>
<L>And FLORA weeps her fragrant offspring gone.</L>
<L>Hoar frost arrests the genial dew;</L>
<L>To wake, to warble, and to woo</L>
<L>No Linnet calls his drooping love:</L>
<L>Shall then the Poet strike the lyre,</L>
<L>When mute are all the feather'd quire,</L>
<L>And Nature fails to warm the Syrens of the grove?</L>

<L>He shall: for what the sullen Spring denies</L>
<L>The orient beam of virtuous youth supplies;</L>
<L>That moral dawn be his inspiring flame.</L>
<L>Beyond the dancing radiance of the East</L>
<L>Thy glory, Son of CHATHAM! fires his breast,</L>
<L>And, proud to celebrate thy vernal fame,</L>
<L>Hark, from his lyre the strain ascends,</L>
<L>Which but to Freedom's fav'rite friends</L>
<L>That lyre disdains to sound.</L>
<L>Hark and approve, as did thy Sire <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The poem of Caractacus was read in MS. by the late Earl of CHATHAM, who honoured it with an approbation which the author is here proud to record.</NOTE></L>

<L>But now, replenish'd with a richer theme,</L>
<L>The vase of Harmony shall pour its stream,</L>

<L>Thy Country too shall hail the song,</L>
<L>Her ecchoing heart the notes prolong;</L>

<L>From Earth and These the Muse averts her view,</L>
<L>To meet in yonder sea of Ether blue</L>
<L>A beam to which the blaze of noon is pale;</L>
<L>In purpling circles now the glory spreads,</L>
<L>A host of angels now unveil their heads,</L>
<L>While Heav'n's own music triumphs on the gale.</L>
<L>Ah see, two white-rob'd Seraphs lead</L>
<L>Thy Father's venerable shade;</L>
<L>He bends from yonder cloud of gold,</L>
<L>While they, the ministers of light,</L>
<L>Bear from his breast a mantle bright,</L>
<L>And with the Heav'n-wove robe thy youthful limbs enfold.</L>
