<P>Measter! Measter!</P>
<LG>
<L>IS not my Measter here among you, pray?</L>
<L>Nay, speak—my Measter wrote this fine new Play—</L>
<L>The Actor-Folks are making such a Clatter!</L>
<L>They want the Pro-log—I know nought o'th' Matter!</L>
<L>He must be there among you—look about—</L>
<L>A Weezen, pale-fac'd Man, do—find him out—</L>
<L>Pray, Measter, come—or all will fall to Sheame</L>
<L>Call Mister—hold—I must not tell his Name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Law! what a Croud is here! what Noise and Pother!</L>
<L>Fine Lads and Lasses! one o' top o't'other.</L>
<STAGE>[Pointing to the Rows of Pit and Gallery.]</STAGE>
<L>I cou'd for ever here with Wonder geaze!</L>
<L>I ne'er saw Church so full in all my Days!—</L>
<L>Your Servunt, Surs!—what do you laugh for? Eh!</L>
<L>You donna take me sure for one o'th' Play?</L>
<L>You shou'd not flout an honest Country-Lad,—</L>
<L>You think me fool, and I think you half mad:</L>
<L>You're all as strange as I, and stranger too,</L>
<L>And, if you laugh at me, I'll laugh at you.</L>
<STAGE>[Laughing.</STAGE>
<L>I donna like your London Tricks, not I,</L>
<L>And since you've rais'd my Blood, I'll tell you why?</L>
<L>And if you wull, since now I am before ye,</L>
<L>For want of Pro-log, I'll relate my Story.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I came from Country here to try my Fate,</L>
<L>And get a Place among the Rich and Great;</L>
<L>But troth I'm sick o' th' Journey I ha' ta'en,</L>
<L>I like it not—wou'd I were whoame again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First, in the City I took up my Station,</L>
<L>And got a Place with one of th' Corporation,</L>
<L>A round big Man—he eat a plagy deal,</L>
<L>Zooks! he'd have beat five P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oomen at a Meal!</L>
<L>But long with him I cou'd not make abode,</L>
<L>For, cou'd you think't?—He eat a great Sea-Toad!</L>
<L>It came from <HI>Indies</HI>—'twas as big as me,</L>
<L>He call'd it <HI>Belly-patch,</HI> and <HI>Capapce:</HI></L>
<L>Law! how I star'd!—I thought,—who knows, but I,</L>
<L>For want of Monsters, may be made a Pye;</L>
<L>Rather than tarry here for Bribe or Gain,</L>
<L>I'll back to whoame, and Country-Farc again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I left Toad-eater; then I sarv'd a Lord,</L>
<L>And there they promis'd!—but ne'er kept their Word.</L>
<L>While 'mong the Great, this Geaming Work the Trade is,</L>
<L>They mind no more poor Servants, than their Ladies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="3"/>
<L>A Lady next, who lik'd a smart young Lad,</L>
<L>Hir'd me forthwith—but, troth, I thought her mad.</L>
<L>She turn'd the World top down, as I may say,</L>
<L>She chang'd the Day to Neet, the Neet to Day!</L>
<L>I was so sheam'd with all her freakish Ways,</L>
<L>She wore her Gear so short, so low her Stays—</L>
<L>Fine Folks shew all for Nothing now-a-Days!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now I'm the Poet's Man—I find with Wits,</L>
<L>There's Nothing sartain—Nay, we eat by Fits.</L>
<L>Our Meals, indeed, are slender,—what of that?</L>
<L>There are but three on's—Measter, I, and Cat.</L>
<L>Did you but see us all, as I'm a Sinner,</L>
<L>You'd searcely say, which of the three is thinner.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My Wages all depend on this Night's Piece,</L>
<L>But shou'd you find that all our Swans are Geese!</L>
<L>E'feck I'll trust no more to Measter's Brain,</L>
<L>But pack up all, and whistle whoame again.</L>

<STAGE><HI>Enter.</HI>—speaking without.</STAGE>
<L>PSHAW!—damn your Epilogue—and hold your Tongue—</L>
<L>Shall we of Rank be told what's right and wrong?</L>
<L>Had you ten Epilogues you shou'd not speak 'em,</L>
<L>Tho' he had writ 'em all in Linguum Grecum.</L>
<L>I'll do't by all the Gods!—(you must excuse me)</L>
<L>Tho' Author, Actors, Audience, all abuse me!</L>
<STAGE>To the Audience.</STAGE>
<L>Behold a Gentleman!—and that's enough!—</L>
<L>Laugh if you please—I'll take a Pinch of Snuff!</L>
<L>I come to tell you—(let it not surprise you)</L>
<L>That I'm a Wit—and worthy to advise you.—</L>
<L>How could you suffer that same Country Booby,</L>
<L>That Pro-logue speaking Savage,—that great Looby,</L>
<L>To talk his Nonsense?—give me Leave to say</L>
<L>'Twas low—damn'd low!—but save the Fellow's Play—</L>
<L>Let the poor Devil eat,—allow him that,</L>
<L><HI>And give a Meal to</HI> Measter, Mon, <HI>and</HI> Cat,</L>
<L>But why attack the Fashions?—Senseless Rogue!—</L>
<L>We have no Joys but what result from Vogue:</L>
<L>The Mode shou'd all Controll—nay, ev'ry Passion,</L>
<L>Sense, Appetite, and all, give way to Fashion;</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>
<HI>I hate as much as he, a</HI> Turtle-Feast,</L>
<L><HI>But 'till the present</HI> Turtle-Rage <HI>has ceas'd,</HI></L>
<L>I'd ride a hundred Miles to make myself a Beast.</L>
<L>I have no Ears,—yet Op'ras I adore!—</L>
<L><HI>Always prepar'd</HI> to die—to sleep—no more!</L>
<L>The Ladies too were carp'd at, and their Dress,</L>
<L><HI>He wants 'em all ruff'd up like good Queen</HI> Bess!</L>
<L>They are, forsooth, too much expos'd, and free—</L>
<L>Were more expos'd, no ill Effects I see,</L>
<L>For more, or less, 'tis all the same to me.</L>
<L>Poor Gaming too, was mauld among the rest,</L>
<L>That precious Cordial to a high-life Breast!</L>
<L>When Thoughts arise I always game, or drink,</L>
<L><HI>An</HI> English <HI>Gentleman shou'd never think—</HI></L>
<L>The Reason's plain, which ev'ry Soul might hit on—</L>
<L><HI>What</HI> trims <HI>a</HI> Frenchman, oversets <HI>a</HI> Briton;</L>
<L>In us Reflection breeds a sober Sadness,</L>
<L>Which always ends in Politicks or Madness:</L>
<L>I therefore now propose—by your Command,</L>
<L>That Tragedies no more shall cloud this Land;</L>
<L><HI>Send o'er your</HI> Shakespears <HI>to the Sons of</HI> France,</L>
<L><HI>Let</HI> them <HI>grow grave—Let</HI> us <HI>begin to dance!</HI></L>
<L>Banish your gloomy Scenes to foreign Climes,</L>
<L>Reserve alone to bless these golden Times,</L>
<L><HI>A Farce or two—and</HI> Woodward's <HI>Pantomimes!</HI></L>

<P>The Author of the Prologue and Epilogue, would not have publish'd them had it not been customary to print them with the Play. He is very sensible that they can have little or no Merit in the Reading, their Effect wholly depending upon the Characters which speak them, and the Novelty of introducing them. They were likewise written at a very short Warning, for the Author of the Play, had not provided these usual, and therefore necessary, Parts of the Performance, which Mr. GARRICK thought proper to provide at all Events.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"TRAGEDY, as it was anciently composed, hath been ever held the gravest, moralest, and most profitable of all other Poems. Hence Philosophers, and other gravest Writers, as, <HI>Cicero, Plutarch,</HI> and others, frequently cite out of Tragic Poets, both to adorn and illustrate their Discourse The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> himself, thought it not unworthy to insert a Verse of <HI>a Greek Poet</HI> into the Text of Holy Scripture.—Heretofore, Men in highest Dignity have laboured, not a little, to be thought able to compose a Tragedy. Of that Honour <HI>Dionysius</HI> the Elder, was no less ambitious, than be∣fore, of his attaining to the Tyranny. <HI>Augustus Caesar</HI> also had begun his <HI>Ajax,</HI> but unable to please his own Judg∣ment, left it unfinished. <HI>Sencca</HI> the Philosopher, is by some thought the Author of those Tragedies, at least the best of them that go under that Name. <HI>Gregory Nazianzen,</HI> a Father of the Church, thought it not unbeseeming the Sanctity of his Person to write a Tragedy, which is intitled, <HI>Christ Suffering.</HI> This is mentioned, to <HI>vindicate Tragedy</HI> from the small Esteem, or rather Infamy, which in the Account of many, it undergoes at this Day,"</Q></P>
<P>So sar the great <HI>Milton:</HI> who strengthen'd these Examples by <HI>his own.</HI> The Author hath nothing more to add, save only, that he hath aimed to write this Piece, in its <HI>essential Parts,</HI> according to the Model of ancient Tragedy, so far as modern Ideas and Manners wou'd permit. And he is so gratefully senssble of that favourable Reception it hath met with from the Public, that in every future Attempt, he will assuredly labour to merit their farther Regarcs, by keeping in his Eye the same great Originals.</P>
