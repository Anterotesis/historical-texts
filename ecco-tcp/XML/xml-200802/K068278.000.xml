<P>THE COBLER: OR, A Wife of Ten Thousand. A BALLAD OPERA. <HI>IN TWO ACTS.</HI> AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, DRURY-LANE.</P>

<P>THE hint of the subsequent trifle is taken from the <HI>Blaise le Saveteir, of Sedan,</HI> as is the hint of the Club-scene from an essay of Dr. <HI>Goldsmith;</HI> and if the indulgent public find a few passable airs, and allow the dialogue to be wor∣thy of filling the intervals, which are necessary in musical pieces, to set off the songs; I trust they will overlook the pictures of low life, I have in a manner considered myself obliged to draw as the proper subjects for ballads, which, unless they are familiar, and have something like character and con∣trast, 'tis next to impossibility but they must be dull and insipid.</P>

<P>Why, you jade. what do you prate at?—Isn't Saint Monday, and are not the club waiting for me?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNOB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you impudent vixen, are Master Muggins, Joey Jenkins, and Gaffer Grumble, rag∣gamuffins? Is the pimple-nos'd Exciseman a ragga∣muffin? or are little Hone the barber, Lawyer Pest, and Mr. Confusion, the surgeon, raggamuffins? But I don't know what's come to you, since you have had the credit of being a tradesman's wife!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALICE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, great credit to be sure. Don't Mrs. Marmalade, the 'Squire's house-keeper, and every one of the other gentlefolks that I am ac∣quainted with, turn up their noses; and don't they cry, only think that such a comely young woman, and one that has been so genteelly edicated, should throw herself away upon such a fellow as Snob, the cobler?

<SPEAKER>ALICE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, as to that, if report does not belie her, old Madam Nipikin is as fond of smirking after the fellows as he is after the girls: But, as I was saying, you don't know how soon he may take away the little we have.</P>

<SPEAKER>ALICE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why will you face me down, that it is not through your misconduct? Are not all my misfor∣tunes owing to you? Did not you come down into the country, when I was in my first place, and pre∣tended that you were a young gentleman run away for killing your friend in a duel?—And did not I, because the butler was my sweetheart, contrive to get you into the house?—Did not you persuade me to get a key to the pantry? And was not I, upon your account, turn'd away—Oh, that I had never seen your bewitching face!</P>

<P>And afterwards when I liv'd at the 'Squire's, at the same time you offered to take your oath that you lov'd nobody but me; had not you a child by the blind fidler's daughter? and was not I fool enough to give a year's wages to make the matter up.</P>

<P>How I am us'd, and after behaving to him as I do!—He does not deserve such a true and faithful wife; for I am sure, though I have never mentioned a word of it, that Mr. Nipikin has been trying a whole twelvemonth to make me bad, and I have always given him his own with a witness: And as for Dick Froth, the tapster, if I'd go off with him, I am sure he'd love me for ever; and every body knows that Dick, on account of his town-edi∣cation, is the gayest young fellow in these parts: I don't mind being poor a bit, if I could but be us'd kind.—I have it: Dick's mistress, Madam Nipikin, is as fond of him as the old fool, his master, is of me; and so—but here he comes.—Your servant, Mr. Rich∣ard; what have you done with my husband?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FROTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he is fairly set in with his guzzling companions; and so I thought I could not take a more properer time, than while you are left like a tur∣kle here alone, to shew you the difference between him who deserts you, and him who would wish to de∣serve you—was not that very prettily said of me?</P>
</SP>

<P>Indeed, Mr. Richard, I don't understand being affronted so. I told you, you know, the last time you talked to me in this manner, that I'd tell my husband.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>FROTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my dear, I have been too much among the Bucks de Sprits of the age to mind hus∣bands; besides, my dear, what you drink with your meals, need not hinder you from having a cordial privately in your closet—Prettily said again.</P>

But suppose he does not—I must bear it as well as I can—for though I am not very wise, I have sense enough to know, that a woman who can consent to be wicked to revenge herself upon her husband, only takes a thorn out of her finger, to place it in her heart.</P>

<P>Well, surely, nothing can be a more simpler contract, than for a woman of my prudence and virtue, to place her infections upon a rattle-pated boy! If we like a man, the lightest hint sophisticates, whereas a boy proposes upon us.</P>

<SPEAKER>SNOB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, your humble servant. As to what you was a saying of a woman of your age and pru∣dence, fixing your affections upon a boy, I agree with you, that it is a damn'd foolish thing; we are all so∣phisticated, as you call it, at one time or another, by love. For instance now, you are as ugly, and as old as any gentlewoman need to be, yet I don't know how it is, I am stark mad in love with you, and can think of nothing else.</P>

<L>'Twas in a village, near Castlebury,</L>
<L>A Cobler and his Wife did dwell;</L>
<L>And for a time no two so merry;</L>
<L>Their happiness no tongue can tell:</L>
<L>But to this couple, the neighbours tell us,</L>
<L>Something did happen that caus'd much strife,</L>
<L>For going to a neighbouring alehouse,</L>
<L>The man got druuk and beat his wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>But though he treated her so vilely,</L>
<L>What did this wife, good creature do?</L>
<L>Slept snug, and found a method slily,</L>
<L>To wring his heart quite through and through;</L>
<L>For Dick the tapster, and his master,</L>
<L>By the report that then was rife,</L>
<L>Were both in hopes, by this disaster,</L>
<L>To gain the Cobler's pretty wife,</L>
</LG>

<L>While things went on to rack and ruin,</L>
<L>And all their furniture was sold,</L>
<L>She seem'd t'approve what each was doing,</L>
<L>And got from each a purse of gold:</L>
<L>So when the Cobler's cares were over,</L>
<L>He swore to lead an alter'd life,</L>
<L>To mind his work, ne'er be a rover,</L>
<L>And love no other but his wife.</L>

<P>We have now nothing to do, I think, my dear, but to thank you, Sir, for releasing us out of all our troubles; and you, Ma'am, for giving us money to set up afresh.</P>

<P>I need not then advise you to be friends, because one is as much to blame as the other. As to the money, take it, Alice, do with it what you please.
