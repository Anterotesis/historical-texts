<HEAD>TO Lord <HI>CLARE.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THANKS, my Lord, for your Ven'son; for finer, or fatter,</L>
<L>Never rang'd in a forest, or smok'd on a platter:</L>
<L>The Haunch was a picture for Painters to study;</L>
<L>The white was so white, and the red was so ruddy!</L>
<L>I had thoughts, in my chamber to hang it in view,</L>
<L>To be shown to my Friends as a piece of <HI>Virtù;</HI></L>
<L>As in some <HI>Irish</HI> Houses, where things are so-so,</L>
<L>One Gammon of Bacon hangs up for a show;</L>
<L>But, for eating a rasher of what they take pride in,</L>
<L>They'd as soon think of eating the pan it is fry'd in.</L>
<L>But hold—let us pause—Don't I hear you pronounce</L>
<L>This tale of the Bacon a damnable bounce?</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="6"/>
Well, suppose it a bounce; sure a Poet may try,</L>
<L>By a bounce now and then, to get courage to fly:</L>
<L>But, my Lord, it's no bounce: I protest, in my turn,</L>
<L>It's a truth; and your Lordship may ask Mr. BURNE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To go on with my tale—As I gaz'd on the Haunch,</L>
<L>thought of a Friend that was trusty and staunch:</L>
<L>So I cut it, and sent it to REYNOLDS undrest,</L>
<L>To paint it, or eat it, just as he lik'd best.</L>
<L>Of the Neck and the Breast I had next to dispose;</L>
<L>'Twas a neck and a breast—that might rival MONROE's:</L>
<L>But in parting with these I was puzzled again,</L>
<L>With the <HI>how,</HI> and the <HI>who,</HI> and the <HI>where,</HI> and the <HI>when:</HI></L>
<L>There's COLEY, and WILLIAMS, and HOWARD, and HIFF—</L>
<L>I think they love Ven'son; I know they love Beef:</L>
<L>But—hang it!—to Poets, that seldom can eat,</L>
<L>Your very good Mutton's a very good treat:</L>
<L>Such dainties to them! It <HI>would</HI> look like a flirt,</L>
<L>Like sending 'em Ruffles when wanting a Shirt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While thus I debated, in <HI>reverie</HI> center'd,</L>
<L>An Acquaintance, a Friend—as he call'd himself, enter'd;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="7"/>
A fine-spoken Custom-house Officer he,</L>
<L>Who smil'd as he gaz'd on the Ven'son and me.</L>
<L>" What have we got here?—Aye, this is <HI>good eating!</HI></L>
<L>" Your own, I suppose—or is it in waiting?"</L>
<L><HI>Why, whose should it be, Sir?</HI> cry'd I, with a flounce;</L>
<L><HI>I get these things often—</HI>But that was a bounce.</L>
<L>" If that be the case then," cry'd he very gay,</L>
<L>" I'm glad I have taken this house in my way.</L>
<L>" To-morrow you take a poor dinner with me:</L>
<L>" No words—I insist on't—precisely at three.</L>
<L>" And now that I think on't, as I am a sinner,</L>
<L>" We wanted this Ven'son to make up the dinner.</L>
<L>" I'll take no denial—you shall, and you must;</L>
<L>" And my Wife, little <HI>Kitty,</HI> is famous for Crust.</L>
<L>" We'll have JOHNSON and BURKE; all the Wits will be there;</L>
<L>" My acquaintance is slight, or I'd ask my Lord CLARE.</L>
<L>" Here, Porter! this Ven'son with me to <HI>Mile-end—</HI></L>
<L>" No words, my dear GOLDSMITH! my very good Friend!"</L>
<L>Thus, seizing his hat, he brush'd off like the wind,</L>
<L>And the Porter and Eatables follow'd behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
<L>Left alone to reflect, having empty'd my shelf,</L>
<L>And nobody with me at sea, but myself;</L>
<L>Though I could not help thinking my Gentleman hasty,</L>
<L>Yet JOHNSON and BURKE, and a good Ven'son Pasty,</L>
<L>Were things that I never dislik'd in my life,</L>
<L>Though clogg'd with a Coxcomb, and <HI>Kitty</HI> his Wife.</L>
<L>So next day, in due splendor to make my approach,</L>
<L>I drove to his door in my own Hackney-coach.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When come to the place where we all were to dine,</L>
<L>(A chair-lumber'd Closet, just twelve feet by nine)</L>
<L>My Friend bid me welcome, but struck me quite dumb</L>
<L>With tidings <HI>that</HI> JOHNSON and BURKE could not come:</L>
<L>" And I knew it," he cry'd; "both eternally fail;</L>
<L>" The one at the House, and the other with THRALE.</L>
<L>" But, I warrant for me, we shall make up the Party,</L>
<L>" With two full as clever, and ten times as hearty.</L>
<L>" The one is a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> the other a <HI>Jew,</HI></L>
<L>" Who dabble and write in the Papers—like you:</L>
<L>" The one writes the <HI>Snarler;</HI> the other, the <HI>Scourge:</HI></L>
<L>" Some think he writes <HI>Cinna—</HI>he owns to <HI>Panurge.</HI>"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
<L>While thus he describ'd them by Trade and by Name,</L>
<L>They enter'd; and Dinner was serv'd as they came:</L>
<L>At the top a fry'd Liver and Bacon was seen;</L>
<L>At the bottom was Tripe in a swinging terrene;</L>
<L>At the sides there was Spinage and Pudding made hot;</L>
<L>In the middle—a place, where the Ven'son was not.</L>
<L>Now, my Lord, as for Tripe, it's my utter aversion;</L>
<L>And your Bacon I hate, like a <HI>Turk,</HI> or a <HI>Persian:</HI></L>
<L>But what vex'd me most was that damn'd <HI>Scottish</HI> Rogue,</L>
<L>With his long-winded speeches, and smiles, and his brogue:</L>
<L>" And, Madam," says he, "may this bit be my poison</L>
<L>" If a prettier Dinner I ever set eyes on!</L>
<L>" Pray, a slice of your Liver;—but may I be curst,</L>
<L>" But I've eat of your Tripe till I'm ready to burst."</L>
<L>'Your Tripe!' quoth the <HI>Jew,</HI> 'if the truth I may speak,</L>
<L>'I could eat of this Tripe seven days in the week:</L>
<L>'I like these <HI>here</HI> Dinners, so pretty and small;</L>
<L>'But your Friend there, the Doctor, eats nothing at all.'</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="10"/>
" O ho!" quoth my Friend, "he'll come on in a trice;</L>
<L>" He's keeping a corner for something that's nice:</L>
<L>" There's a Pasty."—'A Pasty!' returned the <HI>Scot;</HI></L>
<L>'I don't care if I keep a corner for <HI>thot.</HI>'</L>
<L>" We'll all keep a corner," the Lady cry'd out:</L>
<L><HI>We'll all keep a corner,</HI> was eccho'd about.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While thus we resolv'd, and the Pasty delay'd,</L>
<L>With looks quite astonishing enter'd the Maid:</L>
<L>A visage so sad, and so pale with affright!</L>
<L>Wak'd PRIAM, by drawing his curtains by night.</L>
<L>But too soon we found out (for who could mistake her?)</L>
<L>That she came with some terrible news from the Baker;</L>
<L>And so it fell out; for that negligent Sloven</L>
<L>Had shut out the Pasty on shutting his Oven.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sad <HI>Philomel</HI> thus—but let similes drop;</L>
<L>And now, that I think on't, the story may stop.</L>
<L>To be plain, my good Lord, 'tis but labour misplac'd</L>
<L>To send such good Verses to one of your taste:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="11"/>
You've got an odd something, a kind of discerning,</L>
<L>A relish, a taste, sicken'd over by learning;</L>
<L>At least it's your temper, 'tis very well known,</L>
<L>That you think very slightly of all that's your own:</L>
<L>So perhaps, in your habits of thinking amiss,</L>
<L>You may make a Mistake—and think slightly of This.</L>

<L>THIS tomb, inscrib'd to gentle PARNEL's name,</L>
<L>May speak our gratitude, but not his fame.</L>
<L>What heart but feels his sweetly-moral lay,</L>
<L>That leads to Truth thro' Pleasure's flow'ry way?</L>
<L>Celestial themes confess'd his tuneful aid;</L>
<L>And Heav'n, that lent him Genius, was repaid.</L>
<L>Needless to him the tribute we bestow,</L>
<L>The transitory breath of Fame below:</L>
<L>More lasting rapture from his Works shall rise,</L>
<L>While Converts thank their Poet in the skies.</L>
