<HEAD>TO HIS GRACE THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING had the honour of being appointed preacher of the <HI>Bampton Lectures</HI> for the current year, by the Heads of Colleges in Oxford, I have the happiness to intro∣duce them to the Public with the additional great advantage of your Grace's protection; an advantage the more considerable, as it derives as much from the character, as the rank of my patron.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
In this situation it will, I presume, become me to address your Grace ra∣ther under the form of preface than in the style of dedication.</P>
<P>My slender pretensions to your fa∣vour are grounded in the earnest en∣deavour of the following sheets fully and circumstantially to vindicate that faith which, I need not tell your Grace, is not barely attacked, but in∣sulted every day. The Charity which <HI>is not easily provoked</HI> must resent the freedom, I had almost said the audacity which distinguishes the infidels of the present generation. These Gentlemen affect to be the party aggrieved; and to console themselves at the same time with a hope, and sometimes a per∣suasion of the speedy abolition of con∣fessions and systems, and, in conse∣quence
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
of it, the revival of evangeli∣cal doctrine in its native simplicity.</P>
<P>I cannot think opinions openly and arrogantly hostile to the national es∣tablishment can be justified even by their sincerity. But infidelity in ge∣neral is without this excuse: it has been repeatedly shewn to draw its principal resources from the vigilance of captiousness, the popularity of profession, the artifice of dissimula∣tion, the confusion of things not really connected, and the occasional suppression, or adulteration of truth. To these I am sorry, for our own sakes, to add the inconsistency be∣tween certain controversial terms, and the imprudence, or unwariness of con∣cession. Such resources as these are indeed inexhaustible. Mr. <HI>Bampton</HI>'s wise and pious institution, and every

other of a similar nature, supposes as much. We contend with enemies, who, though with unequal forces, will always be able to take the field. However, my Lord, I flatter myself I have happily chosen more advan∣tageous ground than many of my fellow-soldiers in this warfare; to whose names on other accounts I look up with deference and venera∣tion. After all, the event must be left in the hands of Providence. I have only to beg the favour of the intelligent reader to peruse these dis∣courses and the annexed annotations, (which will be equally necessary,) with an inclination to be satisfied; and in that spirit of candor and impartiallity with which, I trust, he will find them to have been composed. I request his attention throughout the performance, and reasonable allowances for the in∣accuracy,

or inequality that may be discovered in it. I hope he will be biassed, not by speciousness of princi∣ple, or habit of attachment, but by preponderance of argument. I sub∣mit it to his judgment, whether I have in any instance shewn an undue warmth, or unwarrantable resent∣ment; and desire him finally to de∣termine, as he shall upon the whole be persuaded, not of the abilities of the advocate, but the merits of the cause. Open to conviction myself, I shall always be ready to rectify an er∣ror, or to renounce an opinion, on competent representation; but shall not pay the least regard to any cen∣sure or animadversion, the features of which shall manifestly betray it to be the offspring of prepossession, chagrin, or malevolence.</P>

<HEAD>Extract from the last Will and Testa∣ment of the late Reverend <HI>JOHN BAMPTON,</HI> Canon of <HI>Salisbury.</HI></HEAD>
<Q><P>—I give and bequeath my Lands and Estates to the Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford for ever, to have and to hold all and sin∣gular the said Lands or Estates upon trust, and to the intents and purposes herein after mentioned; that is to say, I will and ap∣point, that the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford for the time being shall take and receive all the rents, issues, and profits thereof, and (after all taxes, reparations, and necessary deductions made) that he pay all the remainder to the en∣dowment of eight Divinity Lecture Ser∣mons, to be established for ever in the said University, and to be performed in the manner following:</P>
<P>I direct and appoint, that, upon the first Tuesday in Easter Term, a Lecturer be yearly chosen by the Heads of Colleges only, and by no others, in the room ad∣joining to the Printing-House, between
<PB N="x" REF="12"/>
the hours of ten in the morning and two in the afternoon, to preach eight Divinity Lecture Sermons, the year following, at St. Mary's in Oxford, between the com∣mencement of the last month in Lent Term, and the end of the third week in Act Term.</P>
<P>Also I direct and appoint, that the eight Divinity Lecture Sermons shall be preach∣ed upon either of the following subjects—to confirm and establish the Christian Faith, and to confute all heretics and schis∣matics—upon the divine authority of the Holy Scriptures—upon the authority of the writings of the primitive Fathers, as to the faith and practice of the primitive Church—upon the Divinity of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ—upon the Divi∣nity of the Holy Ghost—upon the Articles of the Christian Faith, as comprehended in the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds.</P>
<P>Also I direct, that thirty copies of the eight Divinity Lecture Sermons shall be always printed, within two months after they are preached, and one copy shall be given to the Chancellor of the University, and one copy to the Head of every Col∣lege,
<PB N="xi" REF="13"/>
and one copy to the Mayor of the City of Oxford, and one copy to be put into the Bodleian Library; and the ex∣pence of printing them shall be paid out of the revenue of the Lands or Estates given for establishing the Divinity Lecture Sermons; and the Preacher shall not be paid, nor be entitled to the revenue, before they are printed.</P>
<P>Also I direct and appoint, that no per∣son shall be qualified to preach the Di∣vinity Lecture Sermons, unless he hath taken the Degree of Master of Arts at least, in one of the two Universities of Oxford or Cambridge; and that the same person shall never preach the Divinity Lecture Sermons twice.</P></Q>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE I.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOHN XVIII. 38.</BIBL>
<Q>Pilate saith unto him, What is Truth?</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS question, of all by far the most important, was put to our blessed Sa∣viour by the <HI>Roman Governour,</HI> perhaps care∣lessly, perhaps contemptuously, but certainly without the least wish for information. In much the same spirit of scorn, or with simi∣lar indifference, the same question is every day in the mouths, sometimes of sceptics and scoffers, and sometimes of men of a more serious cast, who affect to be persuaded that we cannot, and, it may be, desire not to give them satisfaction. Unhappily, the Christian world is divided and subdivided almost infi∣nitely;
<PB N="2" REF="15"/>
it is parcelled out into sectaries of a thousand denominations. The fact is, though the right of private judgment in mat∣ters of religion, which has been exercised from the beginning, was justly and necessarily as∣serted by the leaders and friends of the RE∣FORMATION, it must be acknowledged, folly, perverseness, pride, and enthusiasm, have, by severally maintaining it, been productive of that strange multiplicity of religious senti∣ment which we have so much cause to la∣ment; of that schism, heresy, scepticism, and infidelity, which have all along disturbed the Church, but fix a mark of peculiar dis∣grace on the last and present century.</P>
<P>And indeed, when it is considered, that the Scriptures are on many accounts particu∣larly liable to be misapplied, perverted, or misconstrued; <HI>(a)</HI> that some passages are to be understood in a literal, and some in a figura∣tive sense; that some things are expressed agreeably to the modes of common speech, and some in pure condescension to the human capacity; that passages are to be compared
<PB N="3" REF="16"/>
with each other in order to a true understand∣ing of them, and doctrines to be deduced, not so much from single and separate texts, as from the manifest tenor of the Scriptures at large; that not unfrequently one and the same text shall be capable of different, and even opposite construction; that though most places in holy writ are of universal im∣portance, yet some are of temporary and oc∣casional purport only; that the sacred writ∣ings, strictly speaking, are the foundation of a rule of faith and manners, such as a creed, formulary, or confession, rather than the rule itself, as will, I trust, in due time more fully appear; and that an assent to the collective body of scripture, as true, does not imply a knowlege, or belief of all scrip∣tural truths; when all this, to which more, were there occasion, might be added, is fairly considered, we cannot possibly be at a loss to account for that variety of notion, that wild∣ness and absurdity of conceit, that extrava∣gance, or impiety of opinion, which I just now observed has more or less so shamefully dishonoured the Christian name in all ages.
<PB N="4" REF="17"/>
Of this exuberance of folly and wicked∣ness Popery has ever been industrious to avail itself. From the acknowledged liableness of the Scriptures to the grossest abuse, when in the hands of such as are <HI>unlearned</HI> and <HI>unsta∣ble,</HI> (to use the apostle's words,) the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> draws her most specious argument against the common use of them; and would fain have us infer the necessity, or the cer∣tainty of an infallible authority lodged in the Church for the decision of controversies, and ascertainment of a rule of faith, from the confessed convenience and utility of such an authority. <HI>(b)</HI> But, unfortunately for her pre∣tensions, as much error and absurdity has re∣peatedly been demonstrated to be within her pale as out of it. <HI>Wh t is truth?</HI> becomes therefore with many a question of as much difficulty as importance; or, rather, of more form than importance; some encouraging themselves in scepticism from these circum∣stances, and others blindly acquiescing in any mode of religion, or in none at all, or at best in that which is usually called natural religion, from a pretence of the utter impossibility of
<PB N="5" REF="18"/>
discovering the true under such a complica∣tion of perplexity.</P>
<P>With points of inferior consequence I shall not trouble myself; but to such as deny, or call in question the capital articles of our religion on the strength of the above conside∣rations, let me insist that nothing of this na∣ture ought to supersede their endeavours to find the truth, and much less to discourage their obedience to it when found. After inquiry we may in some respect or other be mistaken, but without it we are inexcusable. In fact, the very diversity, or contrariety complained of may be justly urged in behalf of the faith which is received in the Church. Were the doctrine of the Trinity, for instance, impugned from one quarter only, and by consistent and uniform opposition, infidelity would be a much more formidable thing than it is; but you may as well look for <HI>one language</HI> at <HI>Ba∣bel</HI> as for a catholic system of unbelief, if I may be indulged with the expression. To enumerate all the heresies which have at different times torn and dismembered the
<PB N="6" REF="19"/>
Church of Christ, is in a manner to confute them; and these, their common animosity against her excepted, are <HI>at</HI> perpetual <HI>enmity</HI> among themselves. Nay, what is yet more extraordinary, we shall find infidelity itself abounding in mysteries, even while it repro∣bates them almost with the confidence of a <HI>faith</HI> which <HI>could remove mountains!</HI> If the sacred theory we are to maintain be in many respects incomprehensible, the substitutions of human wisdom will in due time be shewn to be at least equally so; and to require the same degree of assent without any thing like the same foundation.</P>
<P><HI>What is truth, say</HI> others <HI>among us,</HI> what is it but a system of doctrines officially taught, and formally transmitted from generation to generation?</P>
<P>But if doctrines are true, why not officially taught, and carefully transmitted? Is profes∣sion ridiculous, or authority contemptible, as such? Indeed, the question is not, what saith the Church?—but—<HI>what saith the</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="20"/>
<HI>Scripture?</HI> Now by Scripture, and the ear∣liest antiquity, our surest guide, and purest precedent, we are not only willing, but wish∣ful to be tried. It is true the bulk of Chris∣tians are not equal to this trial; in a certain sense, they <HI>care for none of these things;</HI> they take matters upon trust; they are not able to <HI>give an answer to every man that asketh a rea∣son of the</HI> faith <HI>that is in them,</HI> except that they were born and bred in it, and suppose it to be unquestionable. It is with respect to this implicitness of assent, this tameness of acquiescence, as it is opprobriously called, that the doctrine of the Holy Trinity has no less impiously than ludicrously been exposed to contempt under the description of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 16, 36, 37. in Preface to <HI>Stilling fleet</HI>'s Discourse in vindication of the doctrine of the Trinity.</NOTE><HI>Tri∣nity of the Mob!</HI> But this is very unfair re∣presentation. Surely no argument can be drawn from the incapacity, or the credulity of the <HI>many,</HI> to the disadvantage of a doctrine that, with respect to the grounds on which we defend it, solicits, demands, defies the penetration of enquiry, and the inquisitive∣ness

<PB N="8" REF="23"/>
of criticism. The spiritual state of the <HI>common people</HI> all over the world falls nearly under the same predicament; but at the same time a proportionable degree of sa∣tisfaction will always be derived to every man from every degree of rational assurance that he is in the <HI>right way;</HI> or belongs to a com∣munion wherein the truth is held in purity approaching nearest to the standard of primi∣tive Christianity.</P>
<P><HI>What is truth?</HI>—Say others. We are no strangers to the doctrines publicly establish∣ed; to the faith asserted in your Articles, and expressed in your Creeds; but to these <HI>Sub∣scription</HI> is much more universal than agree∣ment. We can produce you names even among yourselves of persons <HI>not a whit behind the very chiefest</HI> Divines in point of rank, probity, or understanding, who nevertheless hold that <HI>God</HI> is to be <HI>worshipped after a way which</HI> you <HI>call heresy;</HI> who <HI>preach another Gospel than that which ye have received</HI> from your fathers, <HI>constantly affirming,</HI> or per∣petually insinuating, that <HI>ye do err, not know∣ing the Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="24"/>
Too true indeed it is that the principal controverted points subsisting among those "who profess and call themselves Christians" are of the most serious nature. If the tenets of our gainsayers and adversaries of many ap∣pellations are right and just, the doctrines of the Trinity, and of the resurrection of the body, (which will be the objects of the ensuing disquisitions,) are heresies of the most abominable, or ridiculous tendency. However, these are circumstances which should not check, but stimulate the spirit of investigation. It will be of infinite moment to inquire whether we or they are the mis∣taken party, and on which side error really lies; whether <HI>our</HI> doctrines or <HI>theirs</HI> have the strongest foundation in scripture and an∣tiquity; are best supported by presumptive ar∣gument, and corroborative evidence; or have least recourse to artifice, and the pitifulness of subterfuge and evasion. We do not wish to have this matter determined either vul∣garly by a majority of voices, or invidiously by the reputation of names.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="25"/>
But again, say others, <HI>What is truth?</HI>—What good purpose is answered, or what ad∣vantage gained by this extraordinary zeal for theory and establishment? What doth it but <HI>gender strifes,</HI> and feed the flame of conten∣tion? The practical doctrines of the gospel are so forcibly, yet so familiarly inculcated, as not to be liable to misinterpretation. <HI>Con∣cerning the faith</HI> thousands <HI>have erred,</HI> but, <HI>as</HI> one <HI>of</HI> our <HI>own poets</HI> hath <HI>said,</HI>
<Q><L>"His can't be wrong, whose life is in the right."</L></Q></P>
<P>It is well for us there is nothing argumen∣tative in the jingle of a couplet. I confess myself to be one of those who are hurt by every effort that has a plain aspect towards resolving all religion into morality. I con∣sider every attempt of this kind as an indi∣rect attack upon the fundamentals of Chris∣tianity. According to the idea of these rea∣soners, the character of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> and of the <HI>Son of God,</HI> will dwindle into that of a mere Legislator, or moral philosopher, who <HI>teaches us to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 12.</NOTE>This text, and texts
<PB N="11" REF="26"/>
congenerous with this, may plausibly be urged in exaltation of <HI>good works</HI> to the ex∣clusion of faith: but let them be contrasted with the following, <HI>he that believeth, and is baptiz'd shall be saved;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark xvi. 16.</NOTE><HI>he that believe thon the Son hath everlasting life,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John. vi. 47.</NOTE>&amp;c. &amp;c; and <HI>where is boasting</HI> on the part of moral honesty, or evangelical righteousness? As speciously, or as justly as men may harangue in demon∣stration of the excellence of piety and virtue; or as loudly, or as reasonably as they may exclaim against the violence, and much more the virulence, which has actuated the spirit of controversy in too many instances; I pre∣sume, no intelligent person, if he is impar∣tial, will deny, that the <HI>faith</HI> which St. <HI>Jude</HI> tells us <HI>was once delivered to the Saints,</HI> what∣ever we are precisely to understand by it, is something entirely distinct from mere mora∣lity; that it ought <HI>earnestly</HI> to be <HI>contended for,</HI> agre ably to the same Apostle's exhorta∣tion; that it is very possible to contend with <HI>meekness;</HI> that errors, and schisms, and here∣sies are represented in scripture as things more or less sinful, dangerous, and damnable; and
<PB N="12" REF="27"/>
that consequently it is of the utmost impor∣tance to our spiritual interests to be right in principle as well as in practice. The petu∣lancy, the pride, and the malevolence of bi∣gots, and of <HI>disputers of this world,</HI> as the Apostle calls them, will no doubt be <HI>brought into judgment</HI> no less than the grossest immora∣lities; but this will not by any means super∣sede, or retard an honest and charitable at∣tempt to enquire into and ascertain the lead∣ing doctrines of our common Christianity.</P>
<P>Complaints against the damnatory clauses of the <HI>Athanasian</HI> Creed, as it is commonly called, reverberate from more quarters than one. People do not seem to be sufficiently aware that a right faith and a good life are required by this form of confession under the same penalty. <Q>Which faith except a man keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly. They that have done good shall go into life everlasting, and they that have done evil into everlasting fire. This is the catholic faith, which except a man believe faithfully he cannot be saved.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="28"/>
It is plain these clauses are to be considered as simply declarative on scriptural grounds of the necessity both of faith and of good works to salvation; and at the same time as leaving all men to that infinite mercy, and those ines∣timable merits, which are fully adequate to the pardon and atonement of sins, failings, ignorances, and errors of integrity. <HI>(c)</HI> Which few considerations will, I apprehend, fairly deliver the Creed before us from the reproach of uncharitableness. With regard to the se∣veral articles of which it consists, I trust, they will be found, in the course of these disquisi∣tions, to have foundation in a fully competent authority; and in the mean time I shall endeavour to remove one general prejudice against them, and to create rather a prepos∣session in their favour, by evincing, that their acknowleged mysteriousness and incompre∣hensibility does by no means unqualify them for our assent.</P>
<P>"Man is as such a rational creature;" and as a rational creature he is a believing one too. We can no more conceive him to be
<PB N="14" REF="29"/>
without belief, than without sense, thought, or reflection. The Atheist who <HI>says in his heart,</HI> as well as with his lips, <HI>there is no God,</HI> believes there is none. He protests against the sup∣posed folly, or extravagance of the fundamen∣tal article of all religion; and on the strength of false conclusions, resolves every thing into a concourse of atoms fortuitously uniting; or into the operation of an unintelligent prin∣ciple which we call nature; or, in other words, into an everlasting succession of causes and effects. It is possible for a man to deny his own existence, or that there is any such thing as motion. We have heard of instances of this sort; though properly they are in∣stances, not of false persuasion, but of in∣sanity. <HI>(d)</HI> Still man is a rational creature, whether he reasons well or ill; and whether, in consequence of such reasoning, his faith be well or ill grounded. It is certain we know little or nothing by intuition. The mind yields assent to many mysterious truths by forming a very small chain of deductions; such as the immensity of space, the infinite progression of number, and eternity, as well <HI>a</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="30"/>
<HI>parte ante</HI> as <HI>a parte post.</HI> <Q>Space and duration, says an ingenious author, are mysterious abysses in which our thoughts are confound∣ed with demonstrable propositions, to all sense and reason, flatly contradictory to one another. Any two points of time, though ne∣ver so distant, are each of them exactly in the middle of eternity. The remotest points of space that can be imagined are, each of them, precisely in the centre of infinite space.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Deism Revealed.</HI> Vol. 2. p. 145.</NOTE>In fact, we have no stronger, or more ade∣quate conception of immensity than of om∣nipresence; we have no clearer idea of the existence of SOMETHING from all eternity than we have of eternal generation. Faith, it is true, strictly speaking, has reference to religion only; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Note at p. 3 of</HI> Howes<HI>'s</HI> Discourse on the abuse of the Talent of Disputation in Religion. &amp;c.</NOTE>but, I hope, a truth or a mys∣tery is not inadmissible purely on account of its respecting practice, or implying obliga∣tion. This will readily be granted even by infidels who deny the truths of Revelation; and much more by such Christians as have
<PB N="16" REF="31"/>
called into debate particular points of that Revelation, to which in general they profess to subscribe. It is well worth remarking that Deists and Heretics never fail to at∣tack the professed atheist with such reason∣ings, as, if pursued through their just con∣sequences, may fairly and successfully be en∣forced upon themselves. For if <HI>he</HI> affects to decry the fundamental principle of all reli∣gion, the Being of a God, on account of the pretended inconceivableness of it, will not <HI>they</HI> observe, in order to confute him, that, unless a more complete, a more uniform, and intelligible system could be built on the ruins of this great article, such his exception can have no weight? And this is the very rea∣soning we urge against the principles both of deists and heretics. With the professed atheist I shall no farther concern myself; but de∣sire to observe, that deists and heretics of all denominations are agreed with us in one ge∣neral point, the acknowlegement of the ex∣istence of God, and consequently the incom∣prehensibleness of the Divine nature, attri∣butes, and operations. The primary notion
<PB N="17" REF="32"/>
which the human mind frames of God is this general and complex, yet negative idea of incomprehensibleness. There is a certain preeminence, if I may so call it, in the Di∣vine essence, &amp;c. which utterly precludes in∣vestigation. But if so, all mysteries, whether natural or religious, whether relative, <HI>e. g.</HI> to the extension of space, &amp;c. or to the nature of the Deity; all these, if considered purely as mysteries, will stand upon a level in point of credibility. And let a revelation be sup∣posed, all adventitious truths introduced there∣by will be fixed upon the same foot; because faith cannot have a stronger foundation in hu∣man reason than in divine authority. This is granted without difficulty; but then as the deist denies the authenticity of those writings which we affirm to contain such revelation, so the heretic disputes the sense and scope of them. The question therefore is, whether the opinion of the one, and the unbelief of the other, is respectively the result of judg∣ment, or of passion; of conviction, or of pride; of impartial enquiry, or of unwilling∣ness to submit the understanding of man to
<PB N="18" REF="33"/>
the <HI>wisdom of God?</HI> For, I repeat it, nei∣ther the one nor the other can, consistently with his own principles and acknowledg∣ments, controvert the received sense, or deny the authority of those writings which the Church holds to be the <HI>Word of God,</HI> barely on account of mysterious truths contained in them. If the Divine Essence be necessarily incomprehensible, no Revelation can possibly make it less so; so far from it, that the very idea of a Divine Revelation, with respect to that essence, implies a Revelation of myste∣ries; <HI>i. e.</HI> of truths undiscoverable, and in∣conceivable by our natural powers; and ac∣cordingly, the credit of Revelation is rather confirmed than weakened by the number and importance of such truths. For it is but natural to expect a more ample display of wonders, and larger discoveries of sublime and sacred points of faith in this Revelation; and surely God is not the less to be believed, the more he communicates to us of his na∣ture, properties, and dispensations. As far as these remarks affect Revelation in gene∣ral, heretics in general will admit the just∣ness
<PB N="19" REF="34"/>
of them; though at the very instant that they allow the writings in question to be the sole rule of faith, they endeavour, as much as may be, to reduce that rule to the measure of their own judgments and apprehensions. I am however already justified in asserting, that as much as some people are averse to be∣lieving what they do not understand, they cannot avoid believing what they do not un∣derstand; and that therefore, on proper au∣thority, it is full as reasonable to believe an hundred mysteries as one. <HI>(e)</HI> And here taking my leave of the deist, I would desire the he∣retic by what appellation soever distinguished, to recollect, that Revelation left human na∣ture as it found it; I mean with respect to our intellectual faculties; that, <HI>from the be∣ginning of the creation</HI> to this very hour, man is to be considered as a reasonable creature, as a free-agent, as sometimes believing upon competent evidence, sometimes governed by passions, and sometimes influenced by pre∣possession. A truth which accounts in a mo∣ment for the multitude of persuasions which have engaged the speculative world. To ex∣pect,

or require that God should manifest him∣self and his proceedings, &amp;c. to every man fully and personally, is to destroy every no∣tion not only of faith, but of obedience likewise; and to wish to invert the essential frame and constitution of things. Difficul∣ties, unsurmountable difficulties of many kinds occur to our contemplations on that frame and constitution; difficulties, on which the light of Revelation darts not a single beam. If we indulge the excursive faculty of imagination beyond the bounds which reason and scripture have set us, we shall find ourselves inextricably entangled in per∣plexity, and sometimes in impiety too. Who shall discover the consistency between Divine prescience and human free-will? Yet that man acts freely, and that God foreknows all events, and decrees accordingly, are equal∣ly truths not to be shaken by any seeming irreconcileableness or contrariety whatsoever. So again: that the most perfect <HI>freedom</HI> of agency must be ascribed to God, cannot pos∣sibly be controverted; and yet does he not <HI>necessarily</HI> foreknow his own actions? Does
<PB N="21" REF="36"/>
not <HI>necessarily</HI> act agreeably to the eternal rules of justice, wisdom, and holiness? That God is in no sense the author of evil, either natu∣ral or moral, every reasonable man, and much more every Christian will maintain; yet is it not certain, that had this world never been made, neither <HI>sin</HI> nor <HI>death</HI> could have <HI>entered</HI> into it? Human wisdom has fatigued itself to no purpose in the ventilation of these sub∣jects. <HI>(f)</HI> Many real truths, but at present seeming paradoxes, will doubtless be capable of future explication; and spiritual things in general should rather be received with the humility of reverence, than encountered with the arrogance of discussion. There will be no end to <HI>doubtful disputations</HI> while men's sentiments are modified by a partial attach∣ment to a favourite principle; and while truths, apparently opposite and contradicto∣ry, are separately contended for, which ought both to be admitted; as ultimately they will be reconciled.</P>
<P>What has been here advanced concerning faith, or mysteries in general, will, I trust,
<PB N="22" REF="37"/>
secure at least a fair and earnest attention to what I shall have to offer in defence of the mysteries of the Gospel. If these mysteries should be found to be real objects of faith, it will be neither right, nor safe, to think, or to speak of them indifferently, unhandsomely, or contemptuously.</P>
<P>That the doctrines of the Church of <HI>En∣gland,</HI> the doctrine of one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, and that of the Resur∣rection of the Body, are as reconcileable to our ideas as the consistency of free-will with necessity, or of the Divine perfections with the existence of evil, I should suppose, no man can deny; and therefore the great ques∣tion is, whether those doctrines be undeniably in those Scriptures which all with whom I am concerned acknowledge to be the rule of faith.</P>
<P>That, with respect to the Trinity, the doctrine of the Church has been so long, so frequently, so copiously agitated with much less success, on our part, than might have been expected from some of the best <HI>Soldiers of Jesus Christ,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="38"/>
the <HI>weapons</HI> of whose <HI>warfare</HI> have been <HI>migh∣ty</HI> in this spiritual field; this, I must confess, is a circumstance enough discouraging; but however, not without its counterbalance in certain considerations. <HI>The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.</HI> Matters are capable of being set in new lights; nor will any exertion be desperate which has for its object the honour of God, and the peace of his Church. Men are wedded to their errors as much as to their vices; but as we are not to be remiss, or hopeless in our labours for the reformation of sinners, though the <HI>whole world</HI> should <HI>lie in wickedness;</HI> so neither should we be impeded or disheartened in our attempts for the con∣version of infidels and heretics, by that pride, that prejudice, however contracted, that <HI>hard∣ness,</HI> or that <HI>slowness of heart,</HI> which indisposes them for the reception of truth.—After all, inquiries of this nature are of very conside∣rable use and importance; they cannot fail at least to <HI>stablish, strengthen,</HI> and <HI>settle</HI> our∣selves; to <HI>root</HI> and <HI>ground</HI> us in that <HI>faith</HI> which we shall find to be built upon the most immoveable foundations.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="39"/>
That assertors and vindicators of this faith, that champions for the Church militant, might never be wanting in this place, the zeal and the piety, the wisdom, and the mu∣nificence of our founder hath nobly pro∣vided. The present institution is happily distinguished by its location; and, in some de∣gree to answer and accomplish it's end, I shall proceed with as much confidence and satis∣faction as may reasonably be supposed to arise from a proper sense of obligation, a full persuasion of the truth of the great doctrines in question, and particularly of the merits of the <HI>Trinitarian</HI> cause.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO the Scriptures of the Old Testament our blessed Saviour referred the <HI>Jews</HI> for satisfaction with respect to his claims to the character in which he appeared among them; and to the Scriptures of the New Testament, together with the other, I am to refer for proofs of those great but mysterious doctrines which I have undertaken to defend: the doctrines contained in the Liturgy, and in the Articles of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Without laying before you at present all, or the principal texts by which the doctrine
<PB N="26" REF="41"/>
of the Trinity is supported, or in which the absolute divinity both of the Son and of the Holy Ghost is explicitly asserted, or necessarily implied, we may previously re∣mark that, supposing them to be authen∣tic, unequivocal, and intelligible, the in∣fidel is in fact precluded from taking advan∣tage of those passages which are declarative either of the acknowleged humanity of Je∣sus Christ, or of the gifts and operations of the blessed Spirit: that humanity, and those operations being things manifestly dis∣tinct from the Divine essence, and real per∣sonality. What we shall have to do therefore will be to enquire, in due time and place, whether the exceptions which have been made against the texts with which the catho∣lic doctrine is fortified, are grounded in prin∣ciples of common candour and common sense; or, in other words, whether the in∣terpretations of anti-trinitarians are critically just, and agreable to the rules which are ge∣nerally allowed to govern interpretation. In the mean time, it will be well worth while to examine, whether the doctrine before us
<PB N="27" REF="42"/>
is not proveable by evidence which, though indirect and collateral, is irresistible. There is hardly any such thing as framing a sen∣tence, or a proposition that cannot be preva∣ricated with; but the tenor of a context, and the weight of circumstances will not easily admit of sophistication.</P>
<P>According to the Athanasian Creed, as it is called, <Q>the Catholic Faith is this; that we worship one God in Trinity, and Tri∣nity in Unity; and that the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is all one: the Glory equal, the Majesty co-eternal.</Q> <HI>But what saith the Scripture? Saith it not,</HI> in effect, <HI>the same also?</HI> That the Father is the first Person in the Trinity, merely in order of nomina∣tion; the Son, the second; and the Holy Ghost, the third; is sufficiently demonstra∣ble from many considerations. In the first place, though the three divine Persons are usually mentioned in a manner which at first sight seems to import an order of a dif∣ferent kind, yet this order is upon some oc∣casions
<PB N="28" REF="43"/>
inverted; <HI>e. g.</HI> in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s often quoted benediction to the <HI>Corinthians; The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you:</HI> and in the following passage of the same Apostle; <HI>there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are diffe∣rences of administrations, but the same Lord; and there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xii. 4.</NOTE>And, in other places, the same inversion is observable with regard to the first and second persons; <HI>Ye know,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>that no whoremon∣ger, nor unclean person, &amp;c. hath any inheri∣tance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ephes. v. 5.</NOTE><HI>Now our Lord Jesus Christ</HI> HIMSELF, says the same Apostle, <HI>and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, comfort your hearts, &amp;c. No man,</HI> says our Lord, <HI>knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Fa∣ther save the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Matt. xi. 27.</NOTE>To this we may add the intro∣duction of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s epistle to the <HI>Galatians; Paul, an Apostle, not of men, neither by man,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="44"/>
<HI>but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who hath raised him from the dead,</HI> &amp;c. From these instances we may at least draw this inference, that the general priority of order above mentioned imports no distinction, or preeminence of essence.</P>
<P>The root, ground, or fountain of essence may be acknowledged to be in the <HI>Father,</HI> without the least prejudice to the <HI>Trinitarian</HI> doctrine, which supposes an ETERNAL com∣munication to the Son and to the Holy Ghost. The terms <HI>root</HI> and <HI>fountain,</HI> &amp;c. are custom∣ary indeed, but by no means strictly proper, or precisely descriptive. They are familiar, not to our ideas, but to our ears. When we speak of, or contemplate the Divine nature, absolutely, and without reference to particu∣lar dispensations, God the <HI>Father</HI> is generally the first in our conception, as far as he can be the object of conception, but not to the exclusion of the Divine nature either of the <HI>Son</HI> or <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI> In these dispensations, in the heavenly oeconomy, we have a mani∣fest and obvious reason for addressing our
<PB N="30" REF="45"/>
prayers and petitions, public and private, for the most part, to the first Person of the Holy Trinity. In short, the terms <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Son,</HI> under which it has pleased infinite wisdom, by way of analogy, to represent this mysterious relation to our minds; these terms imply nothing more than nominal preemi∣nence and subordination: if the Anti-trinita∣rian should insist that they do imply more, and ask what we mean by eternal generation, or procession, we will answer him the mo∣ment we are told what he means by eternal essence itself. <HI>(g)</HI></P>
<P>Again. The Father is commonly repre∣sented to us under the character of the ma∣ker, the governor, preserver, and judge of the world; the Son under that of our re∣deemer, advocate, and saviour; the Holy Ghost under that of our guide, comforter, and sanctifier; and yet these characters, we shall see, with the names, properties, and at∣tributes of the Deity, are frequently recipro∣cated. Thus, in the following places among others, the office of Redeemer is ascribed in
<PB N="31" REF="46"/>
expess terms to the first person; or, if you please, to God absolutely considered. <HI>God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave. I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hosea xiii. 14.</NOTE><HI>My soul shall rejoice which thou hast redeemed.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm lxxi. 23.</NOTE>So likewise in numberless passages the Fa∣ther is styled Saviour. To instance only a few. <HI>There is no God else beside me, a just God, and a Saviour.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isa. xlv. 21.</NOTE><HI>Paul, an apostle, &amp;c. by the commandment of God our Saviour,</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 1.</NOTE>&amp;c. <HI>We trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men. To the only wise God our Saviour be glory and majesty now and ever</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Jude v. 25.</NOTE>And again; the work of sanctification is indis∣criminately said to be the work of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Thus our bodies are sometimes called the <HI>temple of God,</HI> and sometimes of the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI> The Apostle declares, that <HI>it is God which worketh in us to will and to do of his good pleasure.</HI> The same Apostle prays, that <HI>the very God of peace may sanctify the Thessalonians; and</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="47"/>
<HI>make</HI> his <HI>Hebrew</HI> converts <HI>perfect in every good work to do his will, working in them that which is well-pleasing in his sight;</HI> and, not to multiply examples, St. <HI>Jude</HI> addresses his ge∣neral Epistle to <HI>those that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ.</HI> To which we may add, that the Father hath sometimes other titles and characters given him which belong more peculiarly to the Holy Spirit, and is called the <HI>God of consola∣tion,</HI> and the <HI>God of all comfort;</HI> as, accord∣ing to one Apostle, <HI>all scripture is given by inspiration of God;</HI> while we are assured by another, that <HI>holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 16. 2 Pet. i. 21.</NOTE></P>
<P>Again. We find all the great properties and characters of the first Person frequently at∣tributed to the second.

raise the dead? And is it not the pre∣rogative of the Supreme God to judge the world? Yet to do both is the work of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> For he is <HI>the resurrection and the life;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xi. v. 25.</NOTE><HI>and as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom he will; and whoso eateth his flesh hath eternal life, and he will raise him up at the last day.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vi. 54.</NOTE>In consequence of such resurrection <HI>we must all appear before his judgment seat.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 10.</NOTE>And once more; is not the true God invisible and incomprehensible? So is <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> For, agreably to a text before cited, <HI>no man knoweth the Son but the Father.</HI> Again. The character and office of the Third Person are explicitly attributed to <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> The Apostle's wish, or benediction, which we have already had occasion to refer to, may be produced as one instance of this. <HI>Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, com∣fort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work. For without Christ we can do nothing; and he of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemp∣tion;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xi. v. 25.</NOTE>
<PB N="35" REF="50"/>
<HI>and he gave himself for the Church, that he might sanctify and cleanse it;</HI> and the Apostle could <HI>do all things through Christ which strengthned him.</HI> Farther; the characters and properties both of the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>second</HI> Person in the Holy Trinity are likewise many of them ascrib'd to the <HI>third.</HI> Thus, in the old Testament, the work of creation seems to be attributed to the operation of the Holy Ghost, as a distinct personage, or agent. <HI>The Spirit of God,</HI> says <HI>Moses, moved upon the face of the waters. Thou sendest forth thy spirit,</HI> says the Psalmist, <HI>and they are created:</HI> and <HI>Job</HI> asserts, that <HI>God by his Spirit hath garnish'd the hea∣vens;</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job. xxvi. 13.</NOTE>and <HI>the Spirit of God ha smade me,</HI> says <HI>Elihu.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. xxxiii 4.</NOTE>For whatever might have been the precise notion of the antient <HI>Jews,</HI> with re∣gard to the <HI>Spirit,</HI> the <HI>Spirit of God,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit of the Lord,</HI> of which we find such frequent mention; or, whatever they might understand by that parallel expression, (in respect at least of the work of creation,) the <HI>breath of the Almighty,</HI> or the <HI>breath of his mouth;</HI> the light of the New Testament, I <NOTE PLACE="foot">Cor. i. 30.</NOTE>
<PB N="36" REF="51"/>
think, sufficiently directs us to the above in∣terpretation. Thus again, the Holy Ghost is omniscient, and eternal; for the <HI>Spirit searcheth all things, yea the deep things of God;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii 10.</NOTE>and <HI>Christ through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 14.</NOTE>Thus the office of advocate, or intercessor, is attributed to the <HI>Spirit, who maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 27.</NOTE>Thus the resurrection of our Lord himself is said to have been effected by the power of the <HI>Holy Ghost;</HI> for <HI>Christ was put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit,</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iii. 18.</NOTE><HI>and he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken our mortal bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in us.</HI> Thus again; both Prophets and Apostles are said to be sent, or commissioned by the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> as well as by the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son. The Lord God and his Spirit hath sent me,</HI> says <HI>Isaiah; the Spirit entered into me,</HI> says <HI>Eze∣kiel, and said unto me, go shut thyself within thy house;</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ezek. iii. 24.</NOTE>and <HI>the Holy Ghost said, separate me Barnabus and Saul for the work whereunto I</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="52"/>
<HI>have called them.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xiii. 2.</NOTE>Once more. The Holy Ghost is indiscriminately called the <HI>Spirit of God,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit of Christ;</HI> and the <HI>Gospel of God</HI> and the <HI>Gospel of Christ</HI> are terms equivalent; and the Apostles are sometimes stiled <HI>servants of God,</HI> and sometimes <HI>servants of Jesus Christ;</HI> and the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> is said to <HI>make overseers over the flock;</HI> as God the <HI>Fa∣ther</HI> hath <HI>set some in the Church, first Apostles,</HI> &amp;c; and as the <HI>Son gave some, Apostles; and some, Prophets,</HI> &amp;c. And, lastly, the very terms of our salvation are reciprocated. St. <HI>Paul testified to Jews and Greeks repentance to∣wards God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts xx. 21.</NOTE>and among the <HI>principles of the doc∣trine of Christ,</HI> the Apostle reckons <HI>repentance from dead works, and faith towards God.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 1.</NOTE>Our Saviour says in one place, <HI>he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life;</HI> and in another place, <HI>he that believeth on him that sent him hath everlasting life.</HI> The general scripture doctrine is, that we are saved by the mercy of God through the merits of our Redeemer;
<PB N="38" REF="53"/>
and yet our salvation is sometimes ascribed absolutely to the mercy, or grace of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> Thus St. <HI>Peter</HI> declares his and his brethren's belief, that both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xv. 11.</NOTE>and St. <HI>Jude</HI> exhorts Chris∣tians to <HI>keep themselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jude 21.</NOTE>To all this we may add, that the title of <HI>Lord,</HI> (which is one unques∣tionable character of supremacy,) is common to the three Persons in the <HI>Holy Trinity;</HI> to the second it is applied as well as to the first in places almost numberless; and to the third beyond all doubt in the following: <HI>the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ;</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">2 Thess. iii. 5.</NOTE><HI>now God him∣self, and our Father,</HI> (where, by the way, the word—HIMSELF—does not appear to be more emphatical than in the text some∣time since cited,) <HI>and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto you; and the Lord make you to increase, and abound in love one towards another, &amp;c; to the end he may stablish your</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="54"/>
<HI>hearts unblameable in holiness before God, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.*</HI> For that by the <HI>Lord</HI> in these texts we are to understand the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> is, I apprehend, demonstra∣ble from these two considerations; first, be∣cause it is his peculiar office to <HI>direct the heart, to make us to increase in love, and to sta∣blish our hearts unblameable in holiness;</HI> and se∣condly, because, according to any other con∣struction, we shall at best make but very in∣different sense of either of these passages. From this inversion then and reciprocation, of which we have produced such a number of instances, the Divinity of each Person in the Trinity may reasonably be inferred; espe∣cially as the sense of many at least of the texts I have produced is obvious, and alto∣gether uncontrovertible.</P>
<P>Again; this great point is evincible from the necessary sense, or natural import of cer∣tain passages. Let us turn to a few of the most remarkable. <NOTE PLACE="foot">1 Thess. iii. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="55"/>
The <HI>sin against the Holy Ghost</HI> is pronounced by our blessed Lord himself to be of all sins the most damnable. <HI>I say unto you, all man∣ner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xii. 31.</NOTE>Now without staying to inquire here into the precise nature of this sin, or how far it may be absolutely incapable of remis∣sion, or in what sense our Saviour's audience understood him, or he meant to be under∣stood, it will be sufficient for our purpose to remark, that the doctrine of the Holy Tri∣nity in general, and particularly of the per∣sonal existence, and coequal divinity of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> with that of the <HI>Father,</HI> and of the <HI>Son,</HI> is plainly and truly though covertly comprehended in the above texts, and in their parallels in the other Evangelists. For otherwise we shall be unavoidably driven into
<PB N="41" REF="56"/>
the following absurd and execrable conclu∣sions, <HI>viz.</HI> that the highest degree of impiety and profaneness against God the <HI>Father</HI> is a mere venial sin; and that a blasphemy, or a sin, a sin, humanly speaking at least, with∣out hope, or possibility of pardon, may be committed against a Being less than the su∣preme God; and even against a kind of spi∣ritual chimera, a motion, a virtue, a quality, or an operation.</P>
<P>Again. <HI>As touching brotherly love,</HI> says St. <HI>Paul, ye need not that I write unto you; for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one ano∣ther.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. iv. 9.</NOTE>Now that by him who in this place is absolutely styled God, we are to understand <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> I have little or no difficulty to pronounce, for the two following reasons; first, because, though we may very properly be said to be <HI>taught of God,</HI> when we are in∣structed by the mouth, or by the preaching of his prophets, or apostles, or others com∣mission'd by him, yet the doctrine of univer∣sal love and charity was more immediately
<PB N="42" REF="57"/>
and peculiarly the doctrine of our blessed Saviour: <HI>A new commandment,</HI> says he, <HI>I give unto you, that ye love one another;—by this all all men know that ye are</HI> MY <HI>disciples, if ye have love one to another</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xiii. 34.</NOTE>; <HI>this is</HI> MY <HI>commandment, that ye love one another</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 9.</NOTE>: and secondly, be∣cause the Apostle seems to regard this great duty as a principle recently taught, and par∣ticularly enforced by the precept and exam∣ple of our Divine Master.</P>
<P>Again. <HI>He that hath seen me hath seen the Father</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">John i. 18.</NOTE>, says our Lord, and <HI>he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.</HI> Now in what sense are these declarations true? Not in the literal; for the <HI>Father</HI> could not be visible in the human person of the <HI>Son;</HI> because <HI>God is a Spirit, and no man hath seen God at any time; whom no man hath seen, or can see</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 16.</NOTE>: and by necessary consequence our Saviour hereby in effect as∣serts, that, notwithstanding his appearance in the flesh, he himself really and truly par∣took of the Divine nature; that, according
<PB N="43" REF="58"/>
to his own expression, the <HI>Father dwelt in him;</HI> or, in the language of the Apostle, in him <HI>dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,</HI> or substantially.</P>
<P>Again. In the Gospels St. <HI>John</HI> the Baptist is called <HI>the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths strait</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. iii. 3.</NOTE>: but in the evangelical prophet the style is at once more explicit and more majestical; <HI>prepare ye,</HI> says he, <HI>the way of the Lord, make strait in the desart a high∣way for our God.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. xl. 3.</NOTE>In the course of the same sublime chapter <HI>Jerusalem</HI> is called upon to <HI>lift up her voice with strength,</HI> to <HI>lift it up and say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God.</HI> And then the prophecy proceeds in the following words. <HI>Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him. He shall feed his flock like a shepherd,</HI> &amp;c. Now, unless it can be de∣monstrated, that these passages do not refer, ultimately at least, to the coming, and to the
<PB N="44" REF="59"/>
person of the Messiah, he is manifestly here announced under the different characters of a <HI>good shepherd,</HI> a <HI>righteous judge,</HI> and the <HI>Lord God.</HI> Besides, if there is no such reference, the several apostolical citations from the pro∣phet are most impertinently ridiculous.</P>
<P>Once more. The first and second persons of the blessed Trinity are expressly distin∣guished, and respectively characterised as equal, in a passage wherein the Apostle occa∣sionally asserts the unity of essence in the Godhead. <HI>We know,</HI> says he, <HI>that there is none other God but one; for though there be that are called Gods, to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. viii. 4. &amp;c.</NOTE>. It may be pretended indeed, that the terms under which the <HI>Son</HI> is here characterised are not of equal weight and significance with those which are des∣criptive of the <HI>Father;</HI> but I will take upon me to aver, that the same might have been pretended, had these terms been transposed,
<PB N="45" REF="60"/>
and the passage had run thus; <HI>to us there is but one God, the Father,</HI> by <HI>whom are all things, and we</HI> by <HI>him; and one Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> of <HI>whom are all things, and we</HI> in <HI>him.</HI> And in many places the three divine Persons are severally specified and referred to, as jointly concurring in the wonderful scheme of man's redemption; particularly in the fol∣lowing. St. <HI>Peter</HI> inscribes his first epistle to the <HI>strangers scattered through Pontus, Galatia, &amp;c. elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Je∣sus Christ:</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI> salutes the <HI>churches</HI> of <HI>Asia</HI> with wishing them <HI>grace and peace from him which is, which was, and which is to come, and from the seven spirits which are be∣fore his throne, and from Jesus Christ</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Rev. 4.</NOTE>. I am sensible indeed that by the <HI>seven spirits,</HI> just mentioned, interpreters do not universally un∣derstand the <HI>Holy Ghost;</HI> but this at least, I cannot help remarking, may be offered in favour of the sense in which I have taken the expression, that it is a sense of which the
<PB N="46" REF="61"/>
words are full as capable as of any other whatever; and that by the present construc∣tion a very considerable difficulty is removed which clogs a different interpretation. For admitting the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> to be signified by the <HI>seven spirits,</HI> there will be nothing sin∣gular or unprecedented in this inversion of the order of Persons in the <HI>Trinity;</HI> but why <HI>angels,</HI> according to the sense of some com∣mentators, should be mentioned before <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> (who is higher than the angels even in many of our adversaries conceptions,) seems accountable only by forced and unnatural ex∣plications. And still more perplexed, and in∣compatible with the nature of a blessing, or a salutation in general, or with the apostoli∣cal greetings and benedictions in particular, the sense of others seems to be, who by the <HI>seven spirits</HI> understand the <HI>graces</HI> of the <HI>Spi∣rit,</HI> or the various operations of Divine Pro∣vidence. <HI>(i)</HI> However, granting the passage to be rather obscure, I would take occasion to observe from it yet farther, that although we should be very cautious of deducing doc∣trines of faith from symbols, or mystical ex∣pressions,
<PB N="47" REF="62"/>
yet types and emblems confessedly significant and characteristical will justify our suitable conclusions. It may be questioned perhaps what is precisely to be understood by the <HI>seven spirits</HI> just mentioned, or by many other symbols in the <HI>Revelation;</HI> but it would be excess of perverseness to doubt, whether the <HI>Lamb</HI> in our Apostle's allegori∣cal prophecy be the emblem of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> Whenever therefore we observe divine ho∣nours plainly ascribed to the <HI>Lamb,</HI> or find him spoken of in terms of equal importance and majesty with those which are predicated of him who is indisputably the true God, the inference is obvious and unavoidable. How then will the <HI>antitrinitarian</HI> evade the force of such passages as these? <HI>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, &amp;c. heard I saying, Blessing and glory, and honour, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. v. 13.</NOTE><HI>The Lamb shall overcome them, for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. xvii. 14.</NOTE><HI>I saw no temple therein, for the Lord God Almighty,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="63"/>
<HI>and the Lamb are the temple of it; and the city had no need of the Sun, &amp;c. for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxi. 22.</NOTE>. <HI>And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, proceeding out of the throne of God, and of the Lamb</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxii. i.</NOTE>. <HI>And the kings of the earth, and the great men, &amp;c. hid them∣selves in the rocks and the mountains, and said unto the mountains and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rev. vi. 15.</NOTE>. If any man should affect to make a distinc∣tion betwixt <HI>him that sitteth on the throne and the Lamb,</HI> or him who is said to <HI>sit on the right hand of God,</HI> in proof of the superio∣rity of the former, I would desire him to re∣member, that the throne in question is called sometimes simply the <HI>throne of God;</HI> some∣times, as in a text lately produced, the <HI>throne of God and of the Lamb;</HI> that, in another place, the <HI>Lamb</HI> is said to be <HI>in the midst of the throne;</HI> in another, to <HI>sit down in the throne of the Father;</HI> and that it is the <HI>throne</HI> of the <HI>Son of God</HI> which is <HI>for ever and ever.</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="64"/>
So likewise, notwithstanding the diversity of constructions to which the expression of the <HI>seven spirits</HI> is liable, the personality, opera∣tion, and Divinity of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> may be demonstrated from the plain literal sense of many places in this book which are utterly void of emblematical ornament, or allusion. Indeed, the whole was evidently dictated by the <HI>Spirit,</HI> by whose <HI>inspiration all scripture was given,</HI> who alone <HI>searcheth the deep things of God,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 10.</NOTE>and under whose immediate direction our Apostle wrote this epistle: for he tells us expressly, before he communicates his Revelations, that he <HI>was in the Spirit on the Lord's day;</HI> and elsewhere, that he <HI>was car∣ried away in the Spirit;</HI> and the solemn call to all persons concerned is frequently re∣peated, <HI>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. ii. 11.</NOTE>To all this we may add, that the personal inherency of the <HI>Spirit</HI> in the essence of the Godhead is demonstrable from St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s illustration of a passage just now quoted from him. <HI>The Spirit,</HI> says he, <HI>searcheth all things, yea, the</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="65"/>
<HI>deep things of God. For what man,</HI> continues he, <HI>knoweth the things of a man, save the Spirit of man which is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</HI> If the conscious spirit in man is man, the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God must be essentially God.</P>
<P>I desire to observe yet farther, that nothing less than a belief in the doctrine of the <HI>Tri∣nity,</HI> as it is received in the Church, can satisfy the full demands of the terms—<HI>faith,</HI>—and <HI>mystery,</HI>—which we meet with so re∣peatedly in the New Testament, and to which there is so much reference under the old. The whole of the <HI>mystery</HI> of the divine <HI>will made known in the dispensation of the fulness of times;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephes. i. 10.</NOTE><HI>the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world,</HI> &amp;c; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 7.</NOTE>or, if you please, the real cha∣racter of the universal Saviour, who was to be both God and man, was a secret from the beginning. This stupendous doctrine was infinitely, and by the divine intention, too sublime for the carnal conceptions of the
<PB N="51" REF="66"/>
<HI>Jews;</HI> who, whatever they might ultimately understand by, or hope from the <HI>Messiah</HI> pro∣mised to <HI>Adam,</HI> to <HI>Abraham,</HI> to the <HI>Patri∣archs,</HI> and to others; and foretold by the Prophets in language clear and strong indeed, but at the same time figurative, magnificent, and mysterious, expected, and primarily de∣sired only a temporal deliverer, who should <HI>restore again,</HI> and perpetuate <HI>the kingdom to Israel.</HI> Nay, it is abundantly evident that the Prophets themselves, those <HI>holy men of God who spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. i. 21.</NOTE>had not an insight into the full scope, and whole import of the sacred truths and oracles which they delivered. Our Lord seems to allude to this ignorance, when he acquaints his disciples, that <HI>many prophets and kings had desired to see the things</HI> which they saw, and <HI>had not seen them,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke x. 24.</NOTE>&amp;c. It is true this was said by way of anticipation; because, as will be shewn, it was not then even to them <HI>given</HI> to <HI>know</HI> the capital <HI>mystery of the kingdom of heaven.</HI> But St. <HI>Peter</HI> is plain and full upon this subject, when, speaking, in his first general epistle, of the salvation obtained
<PB N="52" REF="67"/>
for us by <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> he proceeds in the following words; <HI>of which salvation the pro∣phets have enquired, and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you; searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did sig∣nify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow: unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the Gospel unto you, with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 10.</NOTE>The ex∣pressions here are, I think, in themselves al∣most sufficiently decisive upon the great point before us. For it is hard to conceive that the Prophets, in whom, it seems, the <HI>Spirit of Christ</HI> resided; and much harder that the angels should not have a clear idea of the work of human redemption; should not be <HI>able to comprehend what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height,</HI> (as St. <HI>Paul</HI> expresses himself, with an eye, I imagine,
<PB N="53" REF="68"/>
to this dispensation,) supposing that work to have been accomplished by any person less than <HI>very God;</HI> but admit the Divinity of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and the inquisitiveness and the incapacity of men and angels will by no means be unaccountable. All this, I trust, will afford a most strong argument, that the <HI>faith</HI> which the Apostles preached after the ascension of our Saviour; the <HI>faith</HI> which was first <HI>delivered</HI> to the christian <HI>Saints;</HI> the <HI>faith</HI> which we are required to <HI>hold fast without wavering,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 23.</NOTE>and to <HI>build up ourselves upon,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jude 20.</NOTE>is a <HI>faith</HI> in the incarnation of the <HI>eternal Son of God;</HI> or, in other words, in the doctrine of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> as it has all along been held in the Christian Church. In conse∣quence of the removal of a popular objection against all this, I hope in the ensuing disqui∣sitions to set in a still clearer point of view the great doctrine before us.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words immediately refer to the great event of our Lord's resurrec∣tion, but in consequence of it to the divinity of his person. Of this therefore I shall pro∣ceed to lay more proofs before you, taking first this opportunity to obviate the following popular objection; that, notwithstanding all that has been, or can be advanced, the doctrine before us is not so absolutely clear and indisputable as we would have it thought, and as a fundamental article of faith ought to be; in as much as no text can be pro∣duced which precisely, and <HI>totidem verbis,</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="70"/>
speaks the language of the first article of our Church; <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>in the unity of the Godhead there be three Persons of one substance, power, and eternity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; or of the second; two whole and perfect natures, that is to say, the Godhead and Manhood are joined together in one Person, never to be di∣vided, whereof is one Christ, very God and very man; or of the fifth; the Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father, and the Son, is of one substance, majesty, and glory with the Father and the Son, very and eternal God.</Q></P>
<P>To all this, I apprehend, we may readily reply, that if there be any real force in such objections, it will operate much farther by necessary consequence than the objectors themselves can be supposed to desire it should. For it will supply the perverse, or idle caviller with pretences and exceptions against all the divine properties and attri∣butes, as far as they are asserted in the first article. There is no <HI>one</HI> passage in the Scrip∣ture
<PB N="57" REF="71"/>
which literally tells us, that <Q>there is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body, parts, or passions, of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness, the Maker and Preserver of all things both visible and invisible.</Q> The divine superintendency, &amp;c, usually called <HI>Providence,</HI> is justly re∣puted one of the capital doctrines of reli∣gion. Yet, upon the principles of these ob∣jectors, it should be no doctrine at all. For we meet with no such term as <HI>Providence,</HI> in the sense demanded, either in the <HI>old</HI> or <HI>new</HI> Testament. So that this doctrine must inevi∣tably fall to the ground, unless it be main∣tained and supported by natural inference; or unless we are at liberty to make use of a proper term to express our sense of it. He who objects to the term—<HI>Trinity</HI>—as un∣scriptural, should consider by what texts he will undertake to prove the <HI>Unity</HI> of the Divine Nature; which, in the sense required by his argument, is a term no more to be found in Scripture than the other. In fact, upon the principle of our opponents, we shall be under a necessity of expunging a
<PB N="58" REF="72"/>
great part of the Apostles Creed, and even such parts of it as all Christians whatever, without the least scruple or hesitation, have assented to. For I desire to know by what express or literal authority of Scripture any person believes in the <HI>Holy Catholic Church,</HI> or in the <HI>Communion of Saints;</HI> or that our blessed Lord was <HI>born of the Virgin Mary, or suffered under Pontius Pilate,</HI> &amp;c? In short, if we are to be absolutely precluded the use and application of proper terms and expressions in the investigation and exposition of Scrip∣ture-meaning, it will, I presume, be impos∣sible to frame the most simple system, or for∣mulary of Christian faith and doctrine, or any such thing as a <HI>Creed</HI> of any kind in the Church. The holy Scripture is the sole rule or measure of every form of confession, &amp;c; it is the only test by which any doctrine, or system is, in all its branches, even the most minute of them, to be deliberately and ulti∣mately tried; but it is not the rule itself; and indeed a little inquiry will shew us why the capital points of religion are not syste∣matically delivered in the sacred writings.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="73"/>
The doctrine of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> as main∣tained by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> was the doctrine of the Catholic Church at and before the time of the publication of the Scriptures of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> or it was not. If it was, the controversy is at an end. If it was not, we would fain know how to account for that great variety of passages, and those numerous circumstances, by which it is at least so plau∣sibly countenanced, not to say forcibly de∣fended. We would fain know how to re∣concile with the character of the <HI>meek</HI> and the <HI>lowly</HI> Jesus, any one of his expressions which is capable of being construed into a claim to the Divinity. If this doctrine was the doctrine of the Church previously to the publication of the holy writings, they are sufficiently full and explicit for the satisfac∣tion, or confirmation of Christians of all ages; if otherwise, here is more than enough said to perplex and misguide them, and to lead them into errors of the first magnitude. The great question therefore, I take it, is, whe∣ther we have not all the reason in the world to infer from the very mode in which the
<PB N="60" REF="74"/>
doctrine of the <HI>Trinity</HI> is inserted and incul∣cated in the sacred pages; the question, I say, is, whether we are not authorised by this circumstance to conclude that this doc∣trine was antecedently received in the Chris∣tian world? For instance; supposing the doc∣trine of the <HI>Trinity</HI> to have been the standing doctrine of the Church when St. <HI>John (k)</HI> wrote his Gospel, we have no kind of diffi∣culty to encounter; but are we not very much embarassed by the contrary supposi∣tion? In the former case, we may readily conceive the Apostle to be asserting the Divi∣nity of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> in the most express terms at the beginning of his Gospel; and, in the course of it, to record many particulars clearly declarative of the same; not by way of formal answer to <HI>Cerinthus,</HI> or any other heretic that disputed, or denied it, but purely in flat contradiction to the novel and he∣terodox notions advanced and propagated by them; and to encourage and stablish good Christians in the faith, as they had all along been taught. What this great Evangelist de∣clares at the latter end of his Gospel, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="75"/>
that <HI>these things were written,</HI> or, as we may say, given under his own hand, that the Christians whom he addresses <HI>might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,</HI> is perfectly consistent with their pre-acquain∣tance with these matters. Agreably hereunto, and indeed in direct confirmation of our hy∣pothesis, St. <HI>Luke</HI> (and many, it seems, before him,) <HI>set in order a declaration of those things which most surely were believed among Chris∣tians,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke i. 1.</NOTE>that the person he writes to <HI>might know the certainty of those things wherein</HI> he had <HI>been instructed.</HI> In the same light we may re∣gard those passages in the epistles which have often been produced in vindication of the doctrine before us. Some of these epistles were, with respect to the main end and de∣sign of them, entirely of a temporary nature; being written with a view to the decision of controversies in the primitive Church, which for many centuries have been out of date; and upon several occasions and subjects of little moment to succeeding generations. Not one of them however was professedly written
<PB N="62" REF="76"/>
in defence of the doctrine of the <HI>Trinity.</HI> Ac∣cording to our present hypothesis, a vindi∣cation of this kind had been absolutely su∣perfluous; and though we cannot wonder to observe a point of this consequence fre∣quently mentioned, or alluded to in these writings, yet it would be very unreasonable to expect to find it methodically or systema∣tically taught.</P>
<P>The grand principle of the leading op∣pugners of the doctrine under consideration is, that the only thing required of Chris∣tians to be believed with regard to the Person of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> is, that he was the <HI>Messiah,</HI> the Person promised and sent by God to re∣deem men from that death which they were inevitably appointed to as descendants of <HI>Adam;</HI> and that the <HI>Messiah,</HI> and the <HI>Christ,</HI> and the <HI>king of Israel,</HI> and the <HI>Son of God,</HI> are terms or titles in Scripture absolutely denoting one and the same thing. I need not tell you, that this is the favourite tenet of Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> in his treatise on the <HI>Reasona∣bleness of Christianity,</HI> as delivered in Scripture.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="77"/>
Now we shall willingly admit, that the Apostles themselves were believers under this idea mostly, during our Saviour's resi∣dence upon earth; as 'tis certain, they had not the whole <HI>mystery</HI> of the Divine <HI>Will,</HI> the grand scheme of man's redemption, clearly and fully made known to them before our Lord's Ascension into heaven. <HI>I have many things to say unto you,</HI> he says to them, <HI>but ye cannot bear them now;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xvi. 12.</NOTE>&amp;c. and in saying this he had most probably an eye to the <HI>mystery</HI> of the Gospel. For though he took frequent occasions to assert and presignify, as I may say, his truly Divine Nature, either directly, or by necessary implication, and could not but have been understood so to have done by his disciples, and by the <HI>Jews,</HI> who <HI>sought to stone him</HI> on that very account, yet, <HI>in the days of his flesh,</HI> many circumstances con∣curred to shake, or rather to overturn the faith of his followers, with respect to this great article. This is plain enough from the tenor of the evangelical history. It would be ridiculous to suppose that the Apostles could believe their Master to be the <HI>Son of</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="78"/>
<HI>God</HI> in the highest sense, or even to be the <HI>redeemer of Israel</HI> in any sense, when <HI>they all forsook him and fled.</HI> At the melancholy crisis I refer to, they conceived no doubt very dif∣ferent notions of their Lord from what they had once entertained of him, and afterwards did, when he was <HI>declared to be the Son of God with power,</HI> or to full effect, by his <HI>re∣surrection from the dead.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>The fact is, the scheme of human redemp∣tion by <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the <HI>only-begotten Son of God,</HI> in the strictest sense, was opened gra∣dually, and propounded to the world as it were article by article. At first it must ne∣cessarily have been sufficient to have believed that <HI>Jesus</HI> was the <HI>Christ,</HI> the <HI>Messiah,</HI> or the <HI>Son of God,</HI> merely as executing a divine commission, &amp;c; his resurrection, ascension, and exaltation to the <HI>right hand of the Ma∣jesty on high,</HI> being subsequent points of faith; and accordingly we read of many that <HI>be∣lieved on him</HI> at different times, and in dif∣ferent places, long before the conversion of
<PB N="65" REF="79"/>
the <HI>three thousand on the day of Pentecost,</HI> whom we cannot but consider as believers in a much higher sense. The <HI>faith</HI> of Chris∣tians at that memorable period, and ever since, cannot with the least colour of reason be ascertained, or is to be measured by what is declared to be <HI>faith</HI> in particular instances recorded in the Gospels. The <HI>faith</HI> which <HI>made the woman whole,</HI> who <HI>had an issue of blood,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke viii. 43.</NOTE>and the <HI>faith</HI> that <HI>saved,</HI> i. e. restored to sight the <HI>blind man</HI> near <HI>Jericho,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. xviii. 35.</NOTE>could not be that <HI>faith,</HI> the <HI>mystery</HI> of which St. <HI>Paul</HI> requires <HI>Deacons to hold in a pure con∣science.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iii. 9.</NOTE>In short, our Saviour's actual re∣surrection, by virtue of his own as well as his Father's power, (as we shall presently see,) cleared up a thousand difficulties in a moment, and amounted to a full demonstra∣tion of his Divinity. From a thorough con∣viction of this no doubt it was that his Dis∣ciples <HI>worshipped him;</HI> and St. <HI>Thomas</HI> in par∣ticular burst into that rapture of acknow∣legement, <HI>My Lord, and my God!</HI> Though therefore the <HI>Messiah,</HI> or the <HI>Christ,</HI> be not
<PB N="66" REF="80"/>
unfrequently called the <HI>Son of God,</HI> as a per∣son <HI>sent from God,</HI> as a <HI>teacher,</HI> a <HI>prophet,</HI> or deliverer, &amp;c. (as many even created beings, angels, &amp;c. and men in general are called <HI>Sons of God</HI> in certain respects,) yet we insist that this appellation belongs peculiarly to <HI>Jesus,</HI> the <HI>author of our faith,</HI> as a Divine Person likewise; and that he is so called with reference to his nature, as well as to his offices. In some passages of Scripture per∣haps, the precise import of this title may be controvertible; as when <HI>devils</HI> and <HI>unclean spirits</HI> call our Saviour the <HI>Son of God,</HI> and the <HI>Holy One of God;</HI> and when <HI>Peter</HI> styles him the <HI>Son of the living God.</HI> In answer to our Lord's question, <HI>whom say ye that I am?</HI> the disciples, according to St. <HI>Mark,</HI> replied by the mouth of <HI>Peter, thou art the Christ.</HI> In other places the significance of the title in question is discoverable by the context; as when <HI>Nathaniel</HI> addresses our Saviour in the character of the <HI>Son of God,</HI> the <HI>king of Israel.</HI> But why must all this affect the sense of any one passage wherein the appellation is given for reasons infinitely superiour? <HI>The</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="81"/>
<HI>Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke i. 35.</NOTE><HI>(l)</HI> Could stronger terms be devised to express the as∣sumption of the human nature by the Di∣vine? Is it not perfectly reasonable to con∣clude, that the sacred penmen often make mention of the <HI>Son of God</HI> with an eye to this mysterious and ineffable incarnation? And is it not certain that the person whom St. <HI>John,</HI> at the end of his Gospel, calls the <HI>Christ,</HI> the <HI>Son of God,</HI> is the same with him whom, at the beginning of it, he styles the <HI>Word</HI> that <HI>was with God,</HI> and <HI>was God?</HI> And if so, is not the sense of the latter passage determinable by the preceding? Neverthe∣less the great Philosopher above mentioned leaves the introduction to this Gospel, and other passages in it of equal import, entirely unnoticed, as though it had no connection with his argument; which is a piece of dis∣ingenuousness that, one cannot avoid saying, did little credit to his cause, or to himself.
<PB N="68" REF="82"/>
We shall be enabled, by such considerations as these, to put the true construction on the title of the <HI>Son of God,</HI> in most, if not all the places where it occurs in the Epistles; naturally taking into the account the many clear and express proofs of our Lord's Divi∣nity which are cited from them. Of some of the most striking of these proofs, among other particulars, we shall for satisfaction∣sake take a review in proper time. What Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> has adduced on this subject with a purpose to invalidate these proofs in general, will, I am confident, be utterly overthrown by the force of the following considerations; <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Epistles</HI> are a part of the <HI>New Tes∣ment,</HI> and as essential a part as the Gospels; were like them, as was observed, written oc∣casionally, and after our Saviour's <HI>Ascension,</HI> &amp;c; that St. <HI>Paul,</HI> e. g. was as much a <HI>teacher</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> an inspired <HI>Apostle,</HI> as St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> or any other Apostle who has historically recorded the actions, words, or doctrine of <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> and that a <HI>Creed,</HI> or system of faith should have its foundation in these <HI>Epistles</HI> together with the other Scrip∣tures.
<PB N="69" REF="83"/>
The truth is, St. <HI>John</HI> in his <HI>Epistles</HI> assérts the same doctrine of our Lord's Divi∣nity as in his Gospel. By Mr. <HI>Locke's</HI> way of proceeding, <HI>viz.</HI> arbitrarily admitting, or re∣jecting Scripture, we may mould Christianity into what form we please; and to this way of proceeding, among other causes, we are to ascribe the various Schisms, and Heresies, which have so long, and so deplorably di∣vided the Christian world.</P>
<P>We may now, I imagine, fairly date the reception of the doctrine of our Lord's Di∣vinity from his resurrection; and we will next see whether the subsequent accounts we have of the propagation of the Gospel be not entirely uniform and consistent upon this hypothesis, at the same time that they open to us the whole <HI>Trinitarian</HI> system.</P>
<P>Let it be observed then, that the first re∣corded prayer we meet with is that of the Apostles after the <HI>Ascension,</HI> in which the address is made immediately to our Lord himself, that he would be pleased to <HI>shew</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="84"/>
whether he had <HI>chosen Joseph, or Matthias,</HI> to supply the place vacated by <HI>Judas</HI> the <HI>traitor,</HI> whom he had originally chosen with the <HI>eleven Apostles. Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts i. 24.</NOTE>It is, I believe, gene∣rally agreed that this address was made to <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and if so, this attribution of om∣niscience to him is sure as strong an argument of his Divinity as any one thing which can be produced in demonstration of it. The ascription is to me on any other foot unac∣countable. It is indeed true, that the Apos∣tles had not yet a thorough insight into the evangelical mystery, nor had got perfectly clear of the prejudices and notions, respecting the <HI>Messiah,</HI> which they had imbibed in com∣mon with their countrymen: in consequence of which we find them asking our Lord, even after his resurrection, and after he had spoken to them, more or less explicitly, of the <HI>things pertaining to the kingdom of God,</HI> whether he would <HI>at that time restore again the kingdom to Israel?</HI> But that they put this question to

him as to one who was able to effect such restoration by his own inherent divine power, or, in other words essentially partook of the divine nature, must surely be concluded from this consideration; that they could not pos∣sibly <HI>now</HI> entertain the least doubt but that all his declarations and assurances to them would be verified to a tittle; and that as he <HI>came forth from the Father, and was come into the world,</HI> so he would soon <HI>leave the world, and go to the Father; and be glorified with that glory which he had with the Father, before the world was.</HI> The case appears plainly to have been this: they did not yet comprehend the whole evangelical plan in the concurrence of three Divine Persons, in "glory equal, in majesty coeternal;" they did not perfectly conceive all the <HI>things pertaining</HI> to Christ's spiritual kingdom; the <HI>kingdom of God</HI> in the fullest and most exalted sense, of which he had been speaking to them allusively <HI>forty days,</HI> and with regard to which he may be supposed to have before promised them, that the <HI>spirit of truth, whom</HI> he would <HI>send unto them from the Father,</HI> should <HI>guide them into</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="86"/>
ALL truth, and <HI>testify of him.</HI> Accordingly, after the miraculous effusion of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> on the <HI>day of Pentecost,</HI> we find them discovering very different sentiments, and animated with spiritual expectations; we see them calling upon the people to <HI>save</HI> them∣selves from an <HI>untoward generation;</HI> exhorting them to <HI>repent,</HI> and to be <HI>baptized for the re∣mission of sins; (m)</HI> renouncing in an instant all honours, profits, and pleasures of this world; <HI>rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame</HI> for the <HI>name</HI> of their Divine Master; and, in a word, preaching the Gos∣pel of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the <HI>Son of God,</HI> through the inspiration of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and in the truest sense of the expression. On the memorable day just mentioned we are told, that the <HI>Apostles were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</HI> What they spake is not particularly specified; but in general we are given to understand, that they spake in all languages the <HI>wonderful works of God.</HI> On the credit of what has been advanced, which will be strengthned by what will follow, it
<PB N="73" REF="87"/>
is most reasonable to suppose, that, by the <HI>works</HI> here referred to, the great work of re∣demption by the eternal <HI>Son of God</HI> is prin∣cipally intended; the <HI>mystery of godliness,</HI> ex∣hibited in <HI>God manifest in the flesh,</HI> and dis∣played in the wonderful effusion of the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>In the first address of the Apostles to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and <HI>Jewish proselytes,</HI> by the mouth of <HI>Peter,</HI> on the same day, both the humanity and divinity of our Saviour are plainly and distinctly asserted, or implied; and in such a manner as hardly to be liable to misconstruc∣tion. The doctrine of the resurrection of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> considered as the confirmation of a still greater doctrine, that of his Divi∣nity, is the chief <HI>corner-stone</HI> of our Christian Faith; and, as such, is particularly insisted upon by the Apostles, who were <HI>ordained</HI> to be <HI>witnesses</HI> of it. And because this most im∣portant of all events could not be accom∣plished by himself in his mere human capa∣city, we find the holy writers frequently de∣claring that <HI>God raised him from the dead.</HI> But
<PB N="74" REF="88"/>
let it be remembered, that <HI>Jesus, whom God raised up,</HI> is likewise as expressly said to have <HI>risen;</HI> and is styled by these very witnesses the <HI>Holy One,</HI> and the <HI>Just,</HI> and the <HI>Prince of life</HI> in different places; which beyond all doubt are titles appertaining to the Supreme God. Under the first of these characters, God the Creator is described in numberless passages of the <HI>Old Testament;</HI> and he who is the <HI>Prince,</HI> or author of <HI>life,</HI> according to the marginal reading, must be the same, in point of power and perogative, with him to whom belong the <HI>issues from death;</HI> who <HI>kil∣leth and maketh alive;</HI> and <HI>in whose hand is the life of every thing.</HI> Indeed the <HI>Prince,</HI> or Author of <HI>life</HI> must have <HI>life in himself</HI> from all eternity; must be emphatically <HI>the life</HI> and <HI>resurrection,</HI> as our Saviour calls himself; and therefore may as truly and properly be said to have <HI>raised the temple of his body</HI> by his own power, (to borrow his own phrase,) as to have been <HI>raised from the dead</HI> by the power of <HI>God the Father.</HI> We may say, in short, with equal truth and propriety, <HI>Christ was raised from the dead,</HI> or <HI>Christ rose from the</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="89"/>
<HI>dead, according to the Scriptures;</HI> the latter assertion importing his Divinity, the former not superseding it; and therefore when St. <HI>Peter</HI> told the <HI>men of Israel,</HI> that they had <HI>killed the Prince of life,</HI> I scarce know which strikes us most, the force of the implied truth, or the keenness of the sarcasm. But to return to the address of the Apostles. <HI>Peter, standing up with the eleven,</HI> says the sacred historian, <HI>lift up his voice, and said unto them, ye men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words; for these are not drunken, as ye suppose, &amp;c; but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel: and it shall come to pass in the last days, (saith God,) I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,</HI> &amp;c; and I <HI>will shew wonders, &amp;c; and it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 14.</NOTE>Now let us com∣pare the promulgation or delivery of this prophecy with the completion of it at this period. Observe the words of the Apostle in
<PB N="76" REF="90"/>
the course of his harange. <HI>This Jesus,</HI> says he, (whom, with reference to his humanity, he had just before called <HI>a man approved</HI> by God,) <HI>hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost,</HI> HE <HI>hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear.</HI> That the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son</HI> concurred in this won∣derful dispensation of infinite wisdom and power on an equal foot, it will scarce be possible for us to doubt, when we recollect that the <HI>second Person</HI> in the blessed <HI>Trinity</HI> is often represented as the giver of <HI>spiritual gifts,</HI> independently on any <HI>promise</HI> from, or association with the <HI>first. I will give you a mouth,</HI> says he to his Apostles, just before his passion, <HI>and wisdom which all your adver∣saries shall not be able to gainsay. I am with you always,</HI> says he after his resurrection, <HI>even unto the end of the world.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxviii. 20.</NOTE><HI>Without</HI> him, he tells them, they <HI>can do nothing.</HI> And, to produce only one passage more out of many that might be cited, which has a manifest
<PB N="77" REF="91"/>
allusion to the effusion of the <HI>Spirit</HI> on the <HI>day of Pentecost,</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> assures the <HI>Ephe∣sians,</HI> that <HI>unto every one is given grace ac∣cording to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore,</HI> he adds, <HI>he saith, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ephes. iv. 7. 1 Cor. vii 11.</NOTE>It may be pertinent yet farther to remark, that sometimes neither the <HI>Father,</HI> nor the <HI>Son,</HI> appear to be con∣cerned in this matter; the <HI>Spirit</HI> being said, of and by himself, to <HI>divide</HI> his <HI>gifts</HI> and graces <HI>to every man severally as he will.</HI></P>
<P>But what shall we say to the invocation implied in the close of the prophecy we are considering; <HI>whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved?</HI> Whom are we to understand by the <HI>Lord</HI> here? This, I should think, may be determined by the significance of the same words in other places. They cannot be misunderstood in the original pro∣phecy of <HI>Joel.</HI> And if we refer to the tenth Chapter of St. <HI>Paul's</HI> Epistle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> where they occur again, they will amount
<PB N="78" REF="92"/>
to an irresistible, though indirect proof of the point in question. It is apparent that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is intended, or included however in all these texts, is accordingly to be worshipped, and consequently is God.</P>
<P>After what has been said, we shall not be at a loss for the construction to be put upon the inference with which the Apostle con∣cludes this first discourse which we have been remarking on. <HI>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ.</HI> Just noting that in the phrase—<HI>that same Jesus</HI>—abundance of reproach is conveyed, I observe, that these words suffi∣ciently express the two natures united in our blessed Saviour, the <HI>Christ</HI> in his human cha∣racter, the <HI>Lord</HI> in his divine. But yet far∣ther, the Apostle encourages his auditors, (who, it seems, were <HI>pricked</HI> in the heart by what he had preached to them,) to <HI>repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,</HI> with the comfortable assurance that the <HI>promise of the Holy Ghost was unto them, and to their</HI>
<PB N="79" REF="93"/>
<HI>Children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the</HI> LORD OUR GOD should <HI>call.</HI> Agreably to which declaration we are told, that <HI>the Lord added to the Church daily such as should be saved;</HI> and are afterwards in∣formed, that <HI>believers were added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.</HI> Now that, according to the most natural and obvious interpretation, we are by the <HI>Lord</HI> to under∣stand <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> in the two last quoted places, I presume will be admitted by every candid enquirer; and if so, it is he who is de∣scribed under the character of the <HI>Lord our God</HI> in the text immediately before cited. When therefore we are told at the 42d verse of this Chapter, that the newly-baptized converts <HI>continued stedfastly in the Apostles doc∣trine;</HI> and afterwards, that the <HI>Apostles taught and preached Jesus Christ,</HI> and spake to <HI>the people the words of this life,</HI> &amp;c. we may justly conclude that doctrine to have been the doc∣trine of redemption, as it has since been re∣ceived in the Christian Church.</P>
<P>When St. <HI>Peter</HI> and his colleagues were brought before the <HI>High-Priest and Rulers,</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="94"/>
&amp;c, in order to be examined concerning the cure of the <HI>impotent</HI> man at the <HI>beautiful gate of the Temple,</HI> we find them again insisting on the <HI>resurrection</HI> of their Master, as the fundamental article which was demonstrative of the truth of his mission and doctrine, and by consequence of the Divinity of his Person. This <HI>deceiver</HI> (as they had blasphemously re∣puted him) had <HI>said, while he was yet alive,</HI> that <HI>after three days he would rise again;</HI> he had affirmed to them, that <HI>as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom he will;</HI> he had declared to them his existence before <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> in the most explicit terms, <HI>Before Abra∣ham was, I am;</HI> he had <HI>said, that God was his Father,</HI> in the strictest sense, <HI>making him∣self equal with God,</HI> &amp;c, &amp;c. Supposing then <HI>the Lord to have risen indeed,</HI> the truth of these several assertions must necessarily fol∣low. And, in fact, that he was <HI>risen,</HI> these <HI>betrayers</HI> and <HI>murderers</HI> of the <HI>just one,</HI> had they not been <HI>stiffnecked</HI> and <HI>uncircumcised in heart and ears,</HI> could not but have been con∣vinced by <HI>beholding the lame man who was</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="95"/>
<HI>healed standing before them;</HI> and afterwards by the many <HI>signs</HI> and <HI>wonders</HI> which were <HI>wrought among the people by the hands of the Apostles,</HI> who most undoubtedly must have been <HI>endowed with</HI> such <HI>power from on high;</HI> or, in other words, by their now <HI>glorified</HI> Master.</P>
<P>I have already in effect considered the sin of <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira,</HI> who <HI>agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord,</HI> as a sin against the <HI>Third</HI> Person in the Holy <HI>Trinity;</HI> and, I think, we may defy infidelity to put a fairer interpretation upon this portion of the Apos∣tolical history.</P>
<P><HI>I shall not dwell on the two invocations of the proto-martyr at the hour of death;</HI> Lord Jesus receive my Spirit; Lord, lay not this sin to their charge; <HI>both which abun∣dantly imply his faith in</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>as God; but pass on to the account of the conversion of the</HI> Ethiopian Eunuch <HI>by</HI> Philip <HI>the</HI> Deacon. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts viii. 26, &amp;c.</NOTE>The Angel of the Lord spake unto Philip,
<PB N="82" REF="96"/>
saying, arise, and go toward the South, &amp;c; and he arose, and went; and behold a man of Ethiopia, an Eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, &amp;c. who had come to Jerusalem for to worship, was returning, and, sitting in his▪ chariot, read Esaias the pro∣phet. Then the Spirit said to Philip, go near, &amp;c. And Philip ran to him, and heard him read, &amp;c, and said, understandest thou what thou readest? And he said, how can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Phi∣lip that he would come up, and sit with him. The place, &amp;c. which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, &amp;c. And the Eunuch said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? Then Philip began at the same Scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. And as they went on their way they came to a certain water; and the Eunuch said, see, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? And Philip said, if thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I be∣lieve that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. And he baptized him. <HI>The history is as succinct as possible: but why is it not as reasonable</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="97"/>
<HI>to suppose, that, when</HI> Philip preached unto the Eunuch Jesus, <HI>he laid the whole mystery of Christianity before him, the grand scheme of human Salvation; and consequently that he believed</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>to be the eternal</HI> Son of God, <HI>as that, when he</HI> baptized him, <HI>he did so</HI> in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost? <HI>There was no manner of occasion to be more circumstan∣tial, supposing the primitive readers of this history to have believed in our sense of the term.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The next particular that meets us is the conversion of St.</HI> Paul. <HI>It will be proper to lay it before you.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ix. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>Saul yet breathing out threatnings and slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord, went unto the high-priest, and desired of him letters to Damascus to the Syna∣gogues, that if he found any of this way, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem. And as he journeyed, suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven. And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him,
<PB N="84" REF="98"/>
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said, who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And he trembling, and astonished, said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee; and Saul arose, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man; but they led him, and brought him into Damascus. And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, behold I am here, Lord. And the Lord said, Arise, and go into the street which is called strait, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus; for behold he prayeth; and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias, coming in, and putting his hands on him, that he might receive his sight. Then Ana∣nias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem: and here he hath autho∣rity from the chief priests, to bind all that call on thy name. But the Lord said unto him, go thy way; for he is a chosen vessel unto me. And
<PB N="85" REF="99"/>
Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him, said, Bro∣ther Saul, the Lord (even Jesus that appeared unto thee) hath sent me, that thou mightest re∣ceive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. And he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus; and he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. But all that heard him were amazed, and said, is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name? But Saul in∣creased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ. <HI>Upon this compendious narrative I remark, first, that throughout the whole we must understand by—the</HI> Lord—Jesus Christ: <HI>secondly, that whether</HI> Saul <HI>re∣ceived the</HI> Holy Ghost <HI>by virtue of the impo∣sition of the hands of</HI> Ananias, <HI>and previously to his baptism, or after it; in either case, the whole</HI> mystery of the Gospel <HI>must have been communicated to him by immediate ir∣radiation: and, thirdly, that therefore when</HI> he preached Christ in the Synagogues that he is
<PB N="86" REF="100"/>
the Son of God, <HI>he asserted him so to be by eternal generation. Occasionally indeed, when he</HI> confounded the Jews, <HI>by proving</HI> that this is very Christ, <HI>his argument no doubt turned upon what he alledged to shew that</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>was the true</HI> Messiah, <HI>the</HI> prophet that should come into the world, <HI>and the</HI> king of Israel <HI>in a spiritual sense, whom they had, and did expect under the idea of a temporal Saviour. It seems after this</HI> Saul spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus at Jerusalem; <HI>and we are told, that upon his being</HI> sent forth to Tarsus, <HI>that he might be out of the reach of the</HI> Gre∣cians, <HI>who</HI> went about to slay him, the Chur∣ches had rest throughout all Judea, &amp;c, and were edified, and walking in the <HI>FEAR OF THE LORD,</HI> and in the <HI>COMFORT OF THE HOLY GHOST,</HI> were multiplied. <HI>I recommend the two last particulars of this passage to the at∣tention of every candid and intelligent hearer. I add too, in corroboration of what has been offered under this portion of the history, that as</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>here tells</HI> Ananias, <HI>that</HI> Saul <HI>was</HI> a chosen vessel unto <HI>HIM, so</HI> Ananias <HI>tells</HI> Paul, <HI>(according to the latter's account of</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="101"/>
<HI>this transaction in another place,) that the GOD OF THEIR FATHERS had</HI> chosen <HI>him.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xxii. 14. x. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>The conversion of <HI>Cornelius</HI> and his family presents itself next to our consideration; and the short, but important narrative of it is pregnant with matter to our purpose. This <HI>proselyte</HI> of the <HI>gates</HI> (for such doubtless he was) <HI>saw evidently an Angel of</HI> GOD <HI>coming unto him,</HI> &amp;c. To the <HI>voice</HI> which called to <HI>Peter</HI> to <HI>rise, kill, and eat,</HI> he answered, <HI>not so,</HI> LORD; <HI>for I have never eaten any thing that is common, &amp;c. While Peter thought on the vision, the</HI> SPIRIT <HI>said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee; arise therefore, and go with them, nothing doubting, for I have sent them.</HI> GOD <HI>hath shewed me,</HI> says he afterwards to <HI>Cornelius</HI> and his friends, that <HI>I should not call any man common,</HI> &amp;c. Now if we only sup∣pose, as, I think, we can do no less than sup∣pose, that St. <HI>Peter</HI> addresses <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> in the words—<HI>not so, Lord,</HI> we have plainly a distinction of <HI>three</HI> Persons in the sacred story. The same will be observable likewise in the
<PB N="88" REF="102"/>
harangue of the Apostle upon this extraordi∣nary occasion. <HI>Of a truth I perceive that</HI> GOD <HI>is no respecter of persons; but in every nation he that feareth him, &amp;c. is accepted with him. The word which</HI> GOD <HI>sent unto the child∣ren of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ,</HI> (HE IS LORD OF ALL,) <HI>that word, I say, you know, which was published throughout all Ju∣dea; how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the</HI> HOLY GHOST, <HI>and with power,</HI> &amp;c. However, if it be objected, that it is by no means credible this devout <HI>proselyte</HI> and his family should be converted to the Christian Faith, in the <HI>trinitarian</HI> sense, by any thing asserted, or intimated in St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s discourse to them, we will admit the objection, and leave our adversaries in possession of all the advantage they can make of it. We may venture to do so without the least hesitation: for I desire it may be remembered in what manner, and by whom the Apostle was in∣terrupted in his sermon, if it may be called one. <HI>While Peter yet spake these words,</HI> says the sacred writer, <HI>the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. And they of the</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="103"/>
<HI>circumcision were astonished, for they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God.</HI> By this miraculous event therefore all farther endea∣vours of the Apostle for the instruction of these people were happily superseded: they were, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> was, instantaneously as it were, <HI>guided into all truth;</HI> and became be∣lievers in the same sense in which he was one. Agreeably hereunto, when St. <HI>Peter re∣hearsed</HI> this matter, and <HI>expounded it by order to those of the circumcision who contended with him,</HI> he tells them in the course of his nar∣ration, that <HI>as he</HI> BEGAN <HI>to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them</HI> that heard him. After this, would it not be idle to insist upon the inade∣quateness of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s address to the purpose of conversion in its utmost extent?</P>
<P>We read in the sequel of this, and in the following chapters, that the <HI>word was preached,</HI> that the <HI>hand of the Lord was with these preachers;</HI> that <HI>a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord; and that the word of God grew and multiplied.</HI> If these expres∣sions are compared with others similar to
<PB N="90" REF="104"/>
them in this history, and with several al∣ready cited, they will be found, I presume, abundantly to coincide with our hypothesis, or, more properly, to confirm it.</P>
<P>But the time admonishes me to bespeak your attention to the continuation of my ar∣gument at the next opportunity.</P>

<P>IN prosecution of the subject which en∣gaged us last <HI>Sunday,</HI> I proceed to the account of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s imprisonment, and what followed upon it, which the sacred Historian gives us in the 12th chapter of the <HI>Acts of the Apostles.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Peter</HI> was <HI>put in prison by Herod,</HI> it seems, <HI>prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xii. 5.</NOTE>; and on the night before his intended execution, <HI>the Lord,</HI> we find, <HI>sent his angel, and delivered him out</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="106"/>
<HI>of the hand of Herod,</HI> &amp;c. Now that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> was <HI>the Lord that sent his angel,</HI> ap∣pears evident enough from these considera∣tions. <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is manifestly designed by this title, for the most part at least, through this whole history. <HI>The Lord who delivered Peter by his angel</HI> was certainly the same <HI>Lord</HI> who afterwards spake to <HI>Paul in the night by a vision;</HI> and who, upon another occasion, <HI>stood</HI> by the same Apostle, and encouraged him, &amp;c. Now we should be glad to know, why these particulars are not to be regarded as equivalent to the appearances, and visions, and deliverances <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dan. iii. 28. and chap. vi. 22.</NOTE>, which are so frequent in the <HI>Old Testament;</HI> and, in that case, I need not point out the consequences they lead to.</P>
<P><HI>In the following chapter, we see</HI> Barnabas <HI>and</HI> Saul sent forth <HI>by an immediate com∣mission from the</HI> Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost said, separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Acts xiii. 2.</NOTE>. So they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed
<PB N="93" REF="107"/>
unto Seleucia, &amp;c. <HI>The passage has been in∣troduced before, and I leave it to the consi∣deration of every attentive and impartial hearer.</HI></P>
<P>The next occurrence is the conversion of the <HI>Deputy S. Paulus,</HI> who, we are informed, was a <HI>prudent man,</HI> and <HI>called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.</HI> And we may reasonably suppose that our Apostles preached it to him at large, and laid before him the great mysteries of the Gospel; and that he <HI>believed</HI> in the most ex∣tensive sense, and was confirmed in his faith by the judgment which he saw miraculously inflicted by the <HI>hand of the Lord</HI> upon <HI>Ely∣mas the sorcerer;</HI> being, as the sacred text expresses it, <HI>astonished at the doctrine of the Lord:</HI> the doctrine just above styled the <HI>word of God.</HI></P>
<P>After this we find St. <HI>Paul</HI> preaching in the <HI>synagogue</HI> of the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Antioch</HI> in <HI>Pi∣sidia</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xiii. 16, &amp;c.</NOTE>Now these <HI>Jews,</HI> though they were
<PB N="94" REF="108"/>
not immediately concerned with them that dwelt at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in the proceedings against our blessed Lord, were yet in all probability <HI>consenting unto his death;</HI> as they could not all this while be unacquainted with his story, or strangers to his pretensions. The Apostle therefore adopts the same mode of argumentation which St. <HI>Peter</HI> had used be∣fore, in his speech to the council, and lays the main stress on the fundamental article of the resurrection of our Lord from the dead. From the admission of this, the truth of the other great points of Christianity must ne∣cessarily follow. And it should seem that this discourse of our Apostle had a conside∣rable effect upon some of his audience; and indeed that others conceived the full force and import of the most striking particulars in it: for we read, that <HI>when the congrega∣tion was broken up,</HI> many of the <HI>Jews</HI> and religious <HI>proselytes followed Paul and Barna∣bas; who speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</HI> And, by the way, this circumstance may well be thought to imply, that the <HI>Spirit of grace</HI> had previ∣ously
<PB N="95" REF="109"/>
operated in their hearts to their entire conversion. But the <HI>next sabbath day,</HI> we are farther told, <HI>almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God;</HI> and the result was, that the <HI>Jews, filled with envy, spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.</HI> I would just ask then, whether this BLASPHEMY does not help us to a very strong presumptive proof of the sense in which these <HI>Jews</HI> un∣derstood <HI>the things which were spoken</HI> by the Apostle?</P>
<P><HI>Let us now attend</HI> Paul <HI>and</HI> Barnabas <HI>to</HI> Iconium; <HI>and see whether we may not rea∣dily infer the nature of their doctrine from the success of it there. In this place, we are informed,</HI> they abode long time, speaking boldly in the <HI>LORD,</HI> which gave testimony to the word of his grace, and granted signs and won∣ders to be done by their hands <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xiv. 3, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>. <HI>I would de∣sire you to compare the last clause of this passage with the conclusion of St.</HI> Mark<HI>'s</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="110"/>
<HI>Gospel;</HI> so then after the <HI>LORD</HI> had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, &amp;c. and they went forth and preached; the <HI>LORD</HI> working with them, and confirming the word with signs following; <HI>and with the twelfth verse of the next chapter;</HI> all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul declaring what miracles and wonders <HI>GOD</HI> had wrought amongst the Gentiles by them; <HI>and with the following passage in the Epistle to the</HI> Hebrews; how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the <HI>LORD,</HI> and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; <HI>GOD</HI> also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the <HI>HOLY GHOST,</HI> according to his own will <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 3, &amp;c.</NOTE>; <HI>I say, I could wish you to com∣pare these several places; and, I believe I might venture to abide by the conclusions you will draw from them.</HI></P>
<P>We find our Apostles next at <HI>Lystra,</HI> where <HI>Paul</HI> cured the man that was <HI>impotent in his</HI>

<HI>feet,</HI> &amp;c: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xiv. 8, &amp;c.</NOTE>on the sight of which miracle, <HI>the people lift up their voices, saying, the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.</HI> Possessed with this notion, the <HI>priests</HI> of <HI>Jupiter brought oxen,</HI> and would <HI>have done sacrifice,</HI> &amp;c. This no sooner came to the ears of <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Paul than they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you, that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven and earth,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. Now this was precisely the expostulation which the occasion demanded. The existence of the one living and true God was to be as∣serted to these idolatrous believers in a plu∣rality of deities. At that time to have op∣posed to their persuasions doctrines peculiarly Christian, would have been altogether pre∣mature and unseasonable. It appears however that our Apostles had, before and after this, preached these doctrines at <HI>Lystra,</HI> and in the neighbourhood, with success; though most probably, for obvious reasons, not in the
<PB N="98" REF="112"/>
hearing of those that <HI>would have done sacrifice.</HI> For we read at the sixth verse of this chapter, that, being <HI>ware</HI> of the design of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> at <HI>Iconium to use them despitefully, &amp;c. they fled unto Lystra and Derbe,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>there they preached the Gospel.</HI> And after the affair of the sacrifice, we are told, that <HI>there came to Lystra certain Jews from Antioch, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city,</HI> &amp;c; that nevertheless he revived, and soon after <HI>preached the Gospel at Derbe, and taught many, and returned again to Lystra, &amp;c, confirming the souls of the Dis∣ciples, and exhorting them to continue in the saith.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvi. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>We meet with nothing now that hath particular connexion with our argument, be∣fore the conversions related in the sixteenth chapter. Let us proceed then to these. At <HI>Troas,</HI> says the history, <HI>a vision appeared to Paul in the night;</HI> from which he and <HI>Silas assuredly gathered that the Lord had called them to preach the Gospel in Macedonia.</HI> Observe
<PB N="99" REF="113"/>
then the account of the conversion of <HI>Lydia</HI> at <HI>Philippi. A certain woman named Lydia, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul. And when she was baptized, she besought us, saying, if ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house,</HI> &amp;c. Now I would ask, whe∣ther we may not reasonably suppose the <HI>Lord opened</HI> this woman's <HI>heart</HI> for the reception of all evangelical truths, almost in an in∣stant? Whether her case is not at least simi∣lar to that of <HI>Cornelius?</HI> And whether we are not as much authorised to take it for granted, that <HI>the things which were spoken of Paul</HI> were <HI>the things pertaining to the kingdom of God,</HI> agreeably to our system, as that this convert was baptized according to the form in St. <HI>Matthew</HI>'s Gospel? I would just re∣mark here, that this system is in no wise pre∣judiced, either by the declaration of the <HI>damsel possessed with a spirit of diviniation,</HI> who <HI>followed Paul</HI> and his companions, <HI>and cried, saying, these men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of Sal∣vation;</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="114"/>
or by the Apostle's exorcism of that spirit in the following words, <HI>I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.</HI></P>
<P>But let us turn to the conversion of the jailor, to whose custody <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> were committed at <HI>Philippi. Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvi. 30.</NOTE>is the question which the former, in a fit of astonishment and terror, put to the latter. <HI>And they said, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, &amp;c. And he was baptized, he and all his. And he rejoiced, believing in God with all his house. To believe in God, and to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> appear here to be convertible expressions. In short, I af∣firm that in this, as well as in preceding in∣stances, we have good reason to suppose the persons preached to were made ac∣quainted by the Apostle and his companion with the capital truths of Christianity, as they are taught in the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="115"/>
Not long after this, our Apostle and his fellow-travellers came to <HI>Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE><HI>And Paul</HI> (as the narrative proceeds) <HI>went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures; opening and alledging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again,</HI> and that <HI>this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ. And some of them believed.</HI> It will be sufficient to observe here, that our Apos∣tle dealt no doubt with these <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Jewish</HI> proselytes, as he had before done with others on like occasions. But the gross misrepresentation, and scandalous calumny of the <HI>unbelieving Jews,</HI> in the city just men∣tioned, is extremely worth notice. They drew <HI>Jason,</HI> as we are informed, and <HI>certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, these men that have turned the world upside down, are come hither also;</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. xvii. 6.</NOTE><HI>and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying, that there is another king, one Jesus.</HI> Now it is perfectly reasonable to suppose, that <HI>Jason</HI> and these <HI>brethren</HI> proclaimed their crucified
<PB N="102" REF="116"/>
master king in a spiritual sense; nay, that they proclaimed him the sovereign of the universe, <HI>king of kings, and lord of lords;</HI> but it is clear, beyond a possibility of doubt, that they asserted no temporal jurisdiction of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> or said or did any thing <HI>con∣trary to the decrees,</HI> or against the government of <HI>Caesar.</HI></P>
<P>We have next an account of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Si∣las</HI>'s preaching the Gospel at <HI>Berea</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 10.</NOTE>; but there is nothing in it which discriminates it from parallel ones already spoken to, except the candid reception the Gospel met with at that place.</P>
<P>We will therefore follow our Apostle to <HI>Athens,</HI> where we find him <HI>disputing in the synagogue with the Jews, and others that met with him.</HI> Among these were <HI>certain philoso∣phers of the Epicureans and the Stoics, who encountered him;</HI> some calling him a <HI>babler;</HI> others, <HI>a setter forth of strange gods, because he preached unto them Jesus and the resurrec∣tion</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="117"/>
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 16, &amp;c.</NOTE>. I mean not to insinuate from this passage, that the Apostle is maintaining the Divinity of <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> as it is evident from the tenor of his ensuing discourse to those heathen philosophers, which is set down at large, that he has here only an eye to the prophetic character, or office of our blessed Lord. If you will turn to the dis∣course, you will find the great points in∣sisted on, to be the unity and the spirituality of the Godhead, together with the doctrine of a future state, and the resurrection of <HI>all</HI> men from the dead, in consequence of <HI>his,</HI> whom God had <HI>ordained</HI> to be the judge of the world. This was a proper beginning with heathens. But what effect had this discourse upon these idolatrous philosophers? <HI>When they heard of the resurrection,</HI> continues the sacred story, <HI>some mocked,</HI> and others said, <HI>we will hear thee again; howbeit certain men clave unto, him, and believed,</HI> &amp;c. Our Apostle appears then to have made converts at <HI>Athens,</HI> though we do not read that they were <HI>baptized,</HI> or indeed believed in the fun∣damental
<PB N="104" REF="118"/>
articles of Christianity, according to our hypothesis. Without doubt, these articles, the great mysteries of faith, were gradually opened to them afterwards, and previously to their admission into the church by baptism. For we shall see presently that these converts are not the only instances of persons who were disciples, or believers in a certain sense, though they were uninstructed in the first principles of Christianity; and this too even since the propagation of it by the Apostles.</P>
<P><HI>After these things, we are told,</HI> Paul <HI>and</HI> Silas—came to Corinth <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Acts xviii. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and Paul reasoned in the synagogue,—and persuaded the Jews and Greeks;—and was pressed in spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ; and when they opposed themselves, and blas∣phemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, your blood be upon your own heads, &amp;c. <HI>You will be pleased to compare this relation with that of the perverse and unbelieving</HI>

Jews at Antioch in Pisidia, <HI>already taken no∣tice of.</HI></P>
<P>We have next an account of the conver∣sion of <HI>Justus,</HI> (though it is not particularly set down,) and of <HI>Crispus,</HI> and of <HI>many of the Corinthians;</HI> which contains nothing mate∣rial to our argument.</P>
<P>But after this we read-of an <HI>insurrection made</HI> by the <HI>Jews against Paul,</HI> and of a charge brought against him before <HI>Gallio;</HI> which has a particular worth our notice. <HI>This fellow,</HI> say they, <HI>persuadeth men to wor∣ship God contrary to the law</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xviii. 13.</NOTE>. Now when we recollect, that our blessed Saviour was <HI>circumcised,</HI> and <Q>obedient to the law for man;</Q> that himself and his Apostles con∣formed to the religion of their country in all points, and attended divine service in the temple, and in the synagogues; that our Apostle circumcised <HI>Timothy</HI> in pure conde∣scension to the <HI>Jews;</HI> that, in vindication of his innocence, he declared to <HI>Festus,</HI> as
<PB N="106" REF="120"/>
he had done before in substance to <HI>Felix,</HI> that <HI>neither against the law of the Jews, nei∣ther against the temple he had offended any thing at all;</HI> that the <HI>Mosaic</HI> oeconomy to∣tally ceased not before the final destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> when all disputes concerning circumcision, and the legal rites and obser∣vances were happily terminated; when we recollect all this, to which more might be subjoined, it will, I conceive, be impossible to make tolerable sense of the accusation just mentioned, without supposing something to have been superadded to the <HI>Jewish</HI> worship by the Apostles, and first Christians, which gave this <HI>great offence;</HI> and what should this be but the worship of Christians, as such; or, in other words, the adoration of Christ, as God?</P>
<P>We will now proceed to the account which the sacred historian gives us of <HI>Apollos</HI> in the same chapter. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xviii. 24.</NOTE><HI>A certain Jew named Apollos, an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus. This man was</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="121"/>
<HI>instructed in the way of the Lord; and, being fervent in the Spirit, he spake and taught dili∣gently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. Whom when Aquila and Pris∣cilla had heard, they expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace; for he mightily con∣vinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the Scriptures that Jesus was Christ.</HI> This portion of Scripture, though a little abstruse, is replete with matter for our observation. <HI>Apollos</HI> is here said to have been <HI>mighty in the Scriptures;</HI> to have been <HI>instructed in</HI> THE WAY OF THE LORD; and to have spoken, and <HI>taught diligently</HI> the THINGS OF THE LORD; i. e. beyond all controversy, the <HI>things of the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Nevertheless he is only called a <HI>Jew;</HI> and why, but be∣cause he was not baptized in the name of <HI>Jesus Christ?</HI> He was not a Christian in the full sense of the term, as we understand it;
<PB N="108" REF="122"/>
he <HI>knew only the baptism of John;</HI> he knew, as we cannot but suppose from this account of him, he knew <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> to be the <HI>pro∣phet,</HI> the <HI>Messiah that was to come,</HI> whose <HI>way John</HI> had <HI>prepared</HI> by <HI>preaching the baptism of repentance,</HI> &amp;c; but he knew not the whole <HI>mystery of godliness,</HI> the grand secret of human redemption by the <HI>Son of God,</HI> coexistent with his <HI>Father, before the foundation of the world.</HI> And accordingly, we may safely con∣clude, that it was with respect to this great mystery, that <HI>Aquila</HI> and <HI>Priscilla expounded to him the</HI> WAY OF GOD <HI>more perfectly.</HI> If we do not infer from hence, that he expressly and directly preached the great mystery in question to those <HI>Jews</HI> whom he <HI>mightily con∣vinced,</HI> &amp;c. every difficulty under this head is fairly solved by preceding considerations.</P>
<P>The case of the disciples whom St. <HI>Paul</HI> found at <HI>Ephesus</HI> is very similar to that we have just dispatched. <HI>Have ye received the Holy Ghost,</HI> says he, <HI>since ye believed? And they said unto him, we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts xix. 2, &amp;c.</NOTE><HI>And</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="123"/>
<HI>he said, unto them what then were ye baptized? And they said, unto John's baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.</HI> The pas∣sage is not wholly free from obscurity; but we cannot do less than collect from it, that these <HI>disciples</HI> knew as much of <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> antecedently to this interview as <HI>Apollos</HI> did before his acquaintance with <HI>Aquila</HI> and <HI>Pris∣cilla;</HI> and consequently, that when <HI>they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus,</HI> they were baptized in the name of a greater per∣son than a prophet; and when the <HI>Holy Ghost came on them, and they spake with tongues and prophesied,</HI> had, like <HI>Cornelius</HI> and his houshold, an immediate insight into the profound mys∣tery of the Christian faith. I just add that, in the chapter before us, the <HI>name of the Lord Jesus</HI> is said to have been <HI>magnified;</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="124"/>
and that the WORD OF THE LORD JESUS, and the WORD OF GOD are different modes of expression which at first sight will be found to import one and the same thing.</P>
<P><HI>But to proceed. I see nothing of conse∣quence enough to our argument to detain us, till we find St.</HI> Paul <HI>at</HI> Miletus, <HI>from whence he</HI> sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the Church. And when they were come to him, <HI>says the history,</HI> he said unto them, ye know from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you; serving the <HI>LORD</HI> with all humility; and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you; testifying both to Jews and Greeks, repentance towards <HI>GOD, and</HI> faith toward our <HI>LORD</HI> Jesus Christ. And now behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me; save that the <HI>HOLY GHOST</HI> witnesseth in every city, saying, that afflictions abide me. But none of these things move me, so that I might finish my course, and the ministry which I have received of the <HI>LORD</HI> <NOTE PLACE="foot">* Acts xx. 17, &amp;c.</NOTE>
<PB N="111" REF="125"/>
Jesus, to testify the Gospel of the grace of <HI>GOD.</HI> And now I know, that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of <HI>GOD,</HI> shall see my face no more. Wherefore I take you to record, that I am pure from the blood of all men; for I have not shunned to declare unto you <HI>ALL THE COUNSEL OF GOD.</HI> Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over which the <HI>HOLY GHOST</HI> hath made you overseers, to feed the Church of <HI>GOD,</HI> which he hath purchased with his <HI>OWN BLOOD.</HI> For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock: also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. <HI>Now if we suppose this Aposto∣lical charge to have been delivered to persons pre-instructed in the mystery of the Gospel, agreeably to our representation of it, i. e. to have been believers in the Holy Trinity, it must be acknowleged to contain words of perspicuity,</HI> truth, and soberness; <HI>but on every other supposition, must not St.</HI> Paul <HI>have been thought by his audience to have been indeed</HI> beside himself? <HI>I would recommend</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="126"/>
<HI>the whole of this passage to every judicious and impartial reader's thorough consideration.</HI></P>
<P>We will now attend this great Apostle to <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> where we find him violently at∣tacked by the <HI>Jews which were of Asia, who stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, crying out, men of Israel help, this is the man that teacheth all men every where against the people and the law,</HI> &amp;c. The accusation brought here against our Apostle is plainly in substance the same with that alledged by the <HI>Jews of Achaia,</HI> who accused him of <HI>persuading men to worship God contrary to the law.</HI> I shall therefore refer you to what was said on that occasion. Only I will add here, that the observation then made is much con∣firmed by the circumstance of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>pu∣rifying</HI> himself at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> with the <HI>four men who had a vow on them,</HI> agreeably to the ad∣vice before given by the judaizing Christians, and in exact conformity to the <HI>Mosaic</HI> con∣stitution. But if we turn to what the Apostle has to say in his own defence, we shall find <NOTE PLACE="foot">* Acts xxi. 27, &amp;c.</NOTE>
<PB N="113" REF="127"/>
his apology to contain an account of his con∣version, and of his Apostolical commission in consequence of it; which strengthens much what has been remarked relative to the charge brought against him. It is observable, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> calls himself here a <HI>Jew</HI> in the very same breath almost in which he avows him∣self a Christian. He admits his hearers to be <HI>zealous towards God, according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts xxii. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>though he plainly intimates all the while that they were erroneously or blindly zealous, or, as he else∣where expresses it, that their <HI>zeal of God was not according to knowlege.</HI> He does not undervalue or vilify the law, and much less pronounce it to be <HI>void,</HI> and of <HI>none effect,</HI> though he professes himself a preacher of the Gospel. Neither the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> nor those of <HI>Asia,</HI> could possibly be strangers to the NEW DOCTRINE which he taught under that character: so that we are not at a loss to know the nature and import of the testimony which he bore concerning his Divine Master. Beside, we are to remember, that he was in∣terrupted
<PB N="114" REF="128"/>
in the course of his harangue, and precluded from enlarging his speech, or ex∣patiating on his doctrine, (which otherwise perhaps he might have done,) by the cla∣mours and outrage of a giddy and incensed multitude.</P>
<P>We see him next before the <HI>chief priests</HI> and <HI>council;</HI> in which situation he politicly takes advantage of the difference of sentiment between them that composed it: the <HI>one part</HI> being <HI>Sadducees,</HI> and <HI>the other Pharisees.</HI> The Apostle openly declares himself a <HI>Pharisee;</HI> in which plea his immediate view was mani∣festly to his own preservation; though ulti∣mately he had doubtless an eye to the con∣version of the most considerable and respec∣table part of his audience, by tacitly at least referring to the resurrection of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and the important consequences necessarily resulting from it.</P>
<P>In much the same light we may regard his apology for himself before <HI>Felix</HI> in the <NOTE PLACE="foot">† Acts xxiii. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>
<PB N="115" REF="129"/>
following Chapter. Under one article of his accusation he is charged with being <HI>a ring∣leader of the sect of the Nazarenes;</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiv. 5, &amp;c.</NOTE>or, as the <HI>Asiatic Jews</HI> had expressed themselves, with <HI>teaching men every where against the law;</HI> or, in the words of the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Achaia,</HI> with <HI>persuading men to worship God contrary to the law;</HI> and under another article he is traduced as a <HI>mover of Sedition,</HI> and a disturber of the public peace. Now there is something ob∣servably dexterous in our Apostle's reply to all this; in which he partly denies the charge, professes his innocence, and defies them to <HI>prove the things whereof they accuse him;</HI> and partly asserts the cause he had espoused, and in general terms acknowleges his Christian principles. In this, as in the preceding case, there is fine address in the Apostle's endeavour to interest his auditors on the side of Christianity, by representing its professors as holding one common tenet with the <HI>straitest</HI> and most popular sect of the <HI>Jewish</HI> religion; while at the same time he was indirectly <HI>preaching through Jesus the</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="130"/>
<HI>resurrection from the dead,</HI> and by necessary implication maintaining the great mystery of the Christian Faith. <HI>Felix,</HI> we find, was far from being unacquainted with at least some of the doctrines of Christianity, and reserved the matter for a farther hearing; but in the interim he, with his wife <HI>Drusilla, which was a Jewess,</HI> sent for <HI>Paul</HI> privately, and <HI>heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiv. 24, &amp;c.</NOTE>It does not appear that our Apostle on this occasion dis∣coursed on any one article of faith, strictly and peculiarly Christian. <HI>He reasoned of righ∣teousness, temperance, and judgment to come,</HI> till this iniquitous governor <HI>trembled;</HI> and pro∣bably had proceeded to the full display of all evangelical truth, had he not been ab∣ruptly dismissed. However, if there be any difficulty here, it is such as affects not our argument in particular; because the very same difficulty will subsist, whether we suppose <HI>that Jesus whom Paul preached</HI> to be "very God of very God," or to be the <HI>Son of God</HI> in a secondary sense only, or indeed barely the <HI>prophet that was to come into the world.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="131"/>
Many of the foregoing remarks may be applied to the defence made afterwards by our Apostle before king <HI>Agrippa and Festus</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts xxvi. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>. I think it unnecessary therefore to cite it. It will suffice to observe, or rather to repeat, that, asserting the doctrine of the resurrection in general, and particularly that of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> at one and the same time in∣sinuates himself into the good graces of such as were pharisaically disposed; and points to a fact, the admission of which, upon full and dispassionate enquiry, must lead all that heard him, all the <HI>Jews</HI> at least into a train of con∣clusions, necessarily comprehending the great truths of the Gospel. And that this was a much more judicious mode of conviction than the direct or positive assertion of all, or any of those truths could have been, I pre∣sume, I need not stay to prove.</P>
<P>When St. <HI>Paul</HI> some time after this <HI>ex∣pounded and testified the kingdom of God to the Jews at Rome, persuading them concerning Je∣sus both out of the law of Moses, and out of the</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="132"/>
<HI>prophets,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts xxviii. 23, 31.</NOTE>we cannot say with any precision how much of the whole scheme of Christia∣nity he laid before them. Most probably his usual discretion directed him to deal tenderly with them at first; though when he declared to the unbelieving part of them that the <HI>salvation of God was sent unto the Gentiles,</HI> the expression has evident reference to that scheme; as, suitably hereto, the history of the <HI>Apostolical Acts</HI> concludes with an ac∣count of his <HI>receiving all that came in unto him for two whole years, and preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>This minute and circumstantial survey of the history of the <HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI> so far as it is connected with our present subject, will, I apprehend, throw much light upon the same. And it will receive additional lustre from the following consideration: that, as in the Holy Scriptures, so in the writings of the Apostolical Fathers, the leading truths of Christianity are incidentally mentioned, or
<PB N="119" REF="133"/>
alluded to, and not systematically, but uni∣formly taught. The doctrine of these Fa∣thers is delivered in the spirit of simplicity; it appears plainly to have been the standing doctrine of the Church; nor is there a single circumstance that will incline us to suspect them of a design to obtrude their own pri∣vate opinions, or conceits, upon the Christian world. This to me seems demonstrable from a very observable particular; which is, that in their writings they do not cite all, or the principal texts which are adduced in main∣tenance of the doctrine of the Trinity, but assert the same in other terms, and in lan∣guage fully equivalent. They evidently con∣sidered it, not as requiring proof, but de∣serving illustration. <HI>Ignatius,</HI> in the intro∣duction to his Epistle to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> salutes them <Q>according to the will of the Father, and <HI>Jesus Christ our</HI> GOD.</Q> The same Fa∣ther wishes the <HI>Romans</HI> to <Q>permit him to imitate the passion of his GOD;</Q> or, of <HI>Christ</HI> his GOD, as it stands in the Original. In the above-mentioned Epistle to the <HI>Ephe∣sians,</HI> he takes occasion thus to express him∣self.

<Q>There is one physician, both fleshly and spiritual; made and not made; GOD INCARNATE; true life in death; both of <HI>Mary</HI> and of God; first passible, then im∣passible; even <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our Lord.</Q> <HI>(n)</HI> In the conclusion of his Epistle to the <HI>Mag∣nesians,</HI> he injoins them to <Q>be subject to their bishop, as <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> to the Father, according to the flesh, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Romans i. 3.</NOTE>and the Apostles both to Christ, and to the Father, and to the Holy Ghost.</Q> This inversion is a very remarkable one. In his Epistle to <HI>Polycarp</HI> he exhorts him <Q>to consider the times, and expect him who is above all time, eternal, invisible, &amp;c.</Q> Were there occasion, much more to the same purpose might be extracted from this venerable Father.</P>
<P><HI>Polycarp</HI> in his Epistle to the <HI>Philipians,</HI> wishes them to be <Q>subject to the Priests, &amp;c. as unto God and Christ.</Q></P>
<P>In St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s first epistle to the <HI>Corinth∣ians</HI> these passages occur. <Q>The sceptre of
<PB N="121" REF="135"/>
the majesty of GOD, our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> came not in the shew of pride,</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c. The second section of the same epistle pro∣ceeds in the terms following. <Q>Ye were all of you humble-minded, &amp;c. desiring rather to be subject than to govern, &amp;c. being content with the portion GOD had dispensed to you, and hearkening dili∣gently to HIS word, ye were enlarged in your bowels, having HIS SUFFERINGS always before your eyes.</Q> This passage is not unsimilar to part of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s discourse at <HI>Miletus</HI> to the elders of the church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> before submitted to your considera∣tion. Let us see now what this Father says in his other epistle to the Corinthians. The exordium of it is this—<Q>Brethren, we ought so to think of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> as of GOD &amp;c.</Q> In the third paragraph he quotes these words of our blessed Saviour; <HI>Whosoever shall con∣fess me before men, him will I confess before my Father.</HI> But, continues he, <Q>Wherein must we confess him? Namely, in doing those things which he saith, &amp;c. by wor∣shipping him, not with our lips only, but
<PB N="122" REF="136"/>
with all our heart, &amp;c. for HE saith in <HI>Isaiah, This people honoureth me with their lips, but</HI> &amp;c.</Q> In conformity with this good Father's idea, we may ask, after the manner of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> is <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> the God of the <HI>New Testament only? Is he not also of the Old? Yea, of the Old also.</HI> In the conclusion of the epistle, St. <HI>Clement</HI> exhorts the <HI>Corinth∣ians</HI> to be vigilant, &amp;c. <Q>because we know not <HI>the day of</HI> GOD<HI>'s</HI> appearing;</Q> <HI>i. e.</HI> un∣doubtedly, the day when we <HI>must appear be∣fore the judgmentseat of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, as the learned translator acknow∣ledges, this second Epistle, was neither held in so much reverence by the ancients, nor is so generally received among the moderns, as the first; and, it is certain, St. <HI>Jerome, Photius,</HI> and <HI>Archbishop Usher</HI> after them, concur in endeavouring to represent it as a spurious production. But I am apt to think every reader will be satisfied with what the learned Prelate has advanced in its defence; though, were the point still really contro∣vertible, as the ground of the objections,
<PB N="123" REF="137"/>
raised by these illustrious personages, does not lie in the doctrine so explicitly contained in it, and at the same time so consonant to the sentiments of the apostolical fathers, I see no manner of necessity for retracting these quotations. Whoever the author might be, we have his clear sense of the matter.</P>
<P>The charge of credulity brought against many of the Fathers by a late celebrated Author, with vehemency of zeal, and in the dialect of virulence, even admitting it to be well founded, cannot justly be thought to affect in the least the validity of these pri∣mitive and plain testimonies to the great truths of the Gospel, as they <HI>are most surely believed among us.</HI> There is not, I am confi∣dent, one circumstance to colour a charge of this nature against the Fathers from whom we have been drawing our evidence, except that of the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> by which, as we shall see, St. <HI>Clement</HI> illustrates the doctrine of the resurrection. And ample satisfaction will be given on that head in its proper place. <HI>(o)</HI></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="138"/>
To these testimonies we might subjoin those of <HI>Justin Martyr, Athenagoras, Ire∣naeus,</HI> and a number of others; the weight of whose collected evidence will be found in∣finitely to preponderate all that has perversely been alledged to its discredit from writers of a subsequent date, and minor authority. <HI>(p)</HI> This in due time will fully appear.</P>
<P>Now, if in all this doctrine we can see nothing like a formulary, or system, we see however from whence <HI>confessions of faith</HI> may reasonably be supposed to have origi∣nated, and by what at this day they may be most justly defended. Supposing the first rule of faith to have been purely the bap∣tismal form; or, agreeing with Dr. <HI>Sykes,</HI> that the <Q>very short Creed which at first was deemed sufficient to entitle men to bap∣tism, was no other than a faith in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and in <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> his Son our Lord, and in the <HI>Holy Ghost;</HI></Q> even admitting this, we cannot surely have recourse to better or sounder authority than that which has been
<PB N="125" REF="139"/>
laid before you, in order to know exactly what <HI>this faith</HI> implies. It will be hard in∣deed if the Apostles, and these Apostolical Fathers, should be all along teaching he∣resy, while they perpetually and earnestly, though not formally or methodically, com∣plain of, and expatiate against it.</P>
<P>But I have yet farther to observe, that the sense of antiquity, and the faith of the primitive Church, may be inferred from such circumstantial evidence as has never, that I know of, been professedly produced, but yet, I trust, will be allowed to come little if at all short of demonstration.</P>
<P>The infamous reproach which was cast upon the whole Christian name by its first enemies, is a circumstance of a particular aspect to our purpose. Christianity was called emphatically THE ATHEISM. <HI>(q)</HI> Now I own I cannot help considering this equally horrid and ridiculous imputation as necessarily im∣porting the primitive Christians to have wor∣shipped <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> as ONE with the Father,
<PB N="126" REF="140"/>
or as "very God of very God" from all eter∣nity. For nothing less than such worship will account for the charge either from <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles.</HI> It might naturally be considered by both as a kind of dethroning of the ONE SUPREME GOD. But every modern unbe∣liever will readily agree with me, that the idea of inferiority and delegation, &amp;c. is far from being irreconcileable with <HI>Jewish</HI> te∣nets, or with known principles of Poly∣theism. <HI>(r)</HI></P>
<P>According to the <HI>Apostolical constitutions,</HI> as we learn from an eminent author, it was customary for the priest, after <HI>amen</HI> solemnly pronounced by the communicants in the holy sacrament, to cry out with a loud voice <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
—<HI>Holy things belong to holy persons;</HI> upon which the people answered, <HI>There is one Holy, one Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>The same writer acquaints us from <HI>Ve∣getius,</HI> an heathen author, who flourished in the time of the younger <HI>Valentinian,</HI> that Christians in a military capacity were used
<PB N="127" REF="141"/>
to swear by <HI>God, Christ,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> and the <HI>Majesty</HI> of the Emperor, which next to God is to be honoured, &amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cave's Prim. Christ. p. 86. Echard's Roman History, Vol. III. p. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>In his <HI>Dissertation on Epictetus, Arrian</HI> (as Bishop <HI>Wilkins</HI> observes) <Q>assures us, that in his time, (which was about an hundred and tweny years after Christ,) it was an usual form in the prayers of the heathen to say <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—<HI>Lord have mercy upon us;</HI> whereby they did acknow∣lege the <HI>unity</HI> of God, says his Lordship; which clause, he adds, is thought to have been from that usage taken into the Li∣turgy of Christians.</Q></P>
<P>Now, if this be admitted, I would re∣mark, that as the title of <HI>Lord</HI> confessedly belongs to our Saviour, the Christians may fairly be supposed, in their triple form of ejaculatory address,—<HI>Lord, have mercy upon us; Christ, have mercy upon us; Lord, have mercy us;</HI> to invoke <HI>Christ</HI> the <HI>Lord,</HI> as su∣preme <HI>God:</HI> or if by <HI>Lord</HI> we are in the first
<PB N="128" REF="142"/>
and third petition to understand <HI>God the Fa∣ther,</HI> still we must be presumed in the inter∣mediate one to address the <HI>Son</HI> as <HI>equal</HI> to the Father; because we shall else be absurd enough to invoke the <HI>supreme God</HI> and a <HI>sub∣ordinate being</HI> with the same fervour, and as it were in the same instant. You will see the argument these pious ejaculations fur∣nish us with, whether we do or do not cre∣dit the account of <HI>Arrian.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Wilkins on Nat. Relig. B. I. ch. 8. p. 42.</NOTE></P>
<P>In confirmation of what has been offered, I desire to add one or two more facts, which, if I mistake not, have more weight in them than is commonly apprehended; as, for in∣stance, the appointment of the <HI>Lord's day;</HI> and the style or title <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> by which churches were in the primitive times distin∣guished. For can we do less in common rea∣son than worship him with the <HI>supreme God,</HI> and as the <HI>supreme God,</HI> to whose particular honour one day in the week is for ever to be <HI>kept holy;</HI> on whose particular account the most sacred observances of religion were trans∣ferred
<PB N="129" REF="143"/>
from the <HI>seventh</HI> day of the week to the <HI>first;</HI> and whose peculiar house is now the only <HI>house of prayer for all people?</HI></P>
<P>I shall conclude this discourse with re∣minding you of a circumstance, if possible, still more decisive: I mean the <HI>Unitarian</HI> doctrine which is so copiously, and so em∣phatically inculcated in the <HI>Koran</HI> of <HI>Ma∣homet.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Passim.</NOTE>Of the person of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> in his prophetical character, this arch impostor speaks in terms the most respectable. <Q>God, says he, gave miracles to <HI>Jesus,</HI> the son of <HI>Mary,</HI> and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit, &amp;c. <HI>Jesus</HI> said in the cradle, verily I am the servant of God. This was <HI>Jesus</HI> the son of <HI>Mary, (s)</HI> the word of truth, &amp;c. Verily God promiseth thee a son, named <HI>John,</HI> (says the angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> to <HI>Zechariah,</HI> according to the <HI>Koran,)</HI> who shall bear witness to the WORD, which cometh from God, an honourable person, chaste, and one of the righteous prophets.</Q> To do honour to the author of
<PB N="130" REF="144"/>
Christianity in this capacity, <HI>Mahomet</HI> posi∣tively asserts, that <Q>they (the <HI>Jews)</HI> slew him not, neither crucified him; but that he was represented by one in his likeness. They did not really kill him, says he, but God took him up unto himself.</Q></P>
<P>But with respect to our Lord's Divinity, or equality with the Father, you have, among a thousand parallel ones, the sentiments fol∣lowing. <Q>They (viz. the Christians) say, God hath begotten children; God forbid. It is not meet for God that he should have any son; God forbid. Blessed be he that hath revealed the <HI>Forkan,</HI> (Koran,) to whom belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth; who hath begotten no issue, and hath no partner in his kingdom, &amp;c. Yet have they taken other Gods besides him, which have created nothing, but are themselves created, &amp;c. <HI>Jesus</HI> is no other than a servant whom we favoured with the gift of prophecy, &amp;c. When <HI>Jesus</HI> came with evident miracles, he said, now am I come unto you with wisdom, and to ex∣plain
<PB N="131" REF="145"/>
unto you part of those things concerning which ye disagree; wherefore fear God, and obey me. Verily God is my Lord, and your Lord; wherefore wor∣ship him. He is God, besides whom there is no God, &amp;c. Far be God exalted above the idols which they associate with him. The 112th. ch. of the <HI>Koran</HI> is entitled <HI>the declaration of God's Unity,</HI> and the whole runs thus: Say God is one God; <HI>(t)</HI> the eternal God; he begetteth not, neither is he begotten; and there is not any like unto him. In the 6th. ch. is the following question: How should he have issue, since he hath no consort?</Q></P>
<P>That these carnal sentiments, this gross language, (the language of infidels and scof∣fers every day,) is directly levelled, not at a <HI>new</HI> or <HI>strange</HI> thing; not at a peculiar tenet of a few enthusiasts; or a particular sect of Christians; but at the leading article, the fundamental principle of our religion, may be affirmed in utter defiance of the united powers of effrontery and equivocation. The
<PB N="132" REF="146"/>
doctrine of the Trinity was most indispu∣tably the standing doctrine of the Christian Church at the time this false prophet broach∣ed his imposture, in the beginning of the seventh century. All these considerations combined, demolish in a moment the several forts of infidelity, in early corruptions, in Monastic superstition, in Gothic barbarism, Scholastic subtilty, and Papal innovation. <HI>(v)</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAVING, I trust, already beyond all reasonable doubt ascertained the abso∣lute Divinity of Jesus Christ, <HI>by many infal∣lible proofs</HI> from holy writ, and by other arguments of a nature little less demonstra∣tive, I scruple not to set the words just read to you in the front of the present discourse, as plainly declarative of this great doctrine, though, singly and separately considered, they may not, on a critical review of the whole verse, be altogether unliable to cavil, or, if
<PB N="134" REF="148"/>
you please, to exception. And I hope very much to strengthen what has been advanced by shewing the repugnancy of anti-trinita∣rian principles to the genius and design of the Christian dispensation; or, in other words, by proving that, if we solely or chiefly regard our blessed Saviour under any character inferior to that of the <HI>true God,</HI> our highest ideas will come infinitely short both of the dignity of his Person, and the nature and end of his Commission.</P>
<P>By affecting the common appellation of <HI>Unitarians,</HI> modern unbelievers, as well the followers of <HI>Socinus</HI> as the disciples of <HI>Arius,</HI> (who again may be ranged under many more classes than one,) appear in some sort to be ashamed of the leaders of their respective heresies, and to desert the captains under whose banners they fight. But be their se∣veral motives hereunto what they may, (tho' indeed they are obvious enough,) it will suf∣fice, without concerning myself with parti∣cular conceits, to take into consideration the two following general persuasions:</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="149"/>
First, that of those who regard our Sa∣viour merely as a Legislator, or teacher of morality by divine commission: and,</P>
<P>Secondly, that of those who profess them∣selves <HI>both almost and altogether such as</HI> we are, his coequality with the Father excepted.</P>
<P>With a view to the confutation of <HI>Socinian</HI> principles, I would observe in the first place, that the title of Legislator, or Lawgiver, is by no means that by which <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is distinguished, or particularly described, either in the <HI>old</HI> or <HI>new Testament.</HI> The great cha∣racters of <HI>Wonderful, Counsellor, Prince of peace, the Sun of righteousness,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal. iv. 2.</NOTE><HI>the Lord our righteousness;</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxiii. 6.</NOTE>the <HI>Messiah,</HI> the <HI>chosen of God,</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke xxiii. 35.</NOTE>the <HI>Christ of God;</HI> of <HI>Mediator</HI> and <HI>Advocate;</HI> of <HI>Saviour, Redeemer,</HI> and <HI>High-Priest;</HI> of <HI>Son of David, Son of God, Son of the Blessed,</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mar. xiv. 61.</NOTE><HI>Lamb of God, Lord of glory,</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 8.</NOTE><HI>Prince of life, Author and Captain of our Salvation;</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 10. v. 9.</NOTE>these characters, and more that might be enume∣rated, import little or nothing of legislation,
<PB N="136" REF="150"/>
but are almost wholly significative of the personal quality of our Saviour, and of his own moral excellence, and of the value and efficacy of his sacrifice. He was, it is true, a <HI>teacher sent from God;</HI> but he was not sent primarily in the capacity of a <HI>teacher.</HI> To in∣struct the world in righteousness was not the grand and ultimate, but merely a subordinate end of his appearance; and indeed a neces∣sary consequence of it.</P>
<P><HI>Let us see then, in the second place, what the Scripture, and he himself declares to have been the more immediate purpose for which he was</HI> made flesh, and dwelt among us. To this end was I born; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xviii. 37.</NOTE><HI>says he,</HI> and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. <HI>Again;</HI> God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. iii. 16.</NOTE><HI>Again;</HI> I must work the work of him that sent me. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Matt. ix. 13.</NOTE>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to re∣pentance. <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">John ix. 4.</NOTE>He hath anointed me to preach the
<PB N="137" REF="151"/>
Gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the cap∣tives, and to set at liberty those that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. <HI>Once more;</HI> I must preach the kingdom of God, for therefore am I sent. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke iv. 18. 43.</NOTE><HI>What the sum and substance of our Saviour's preaching was, will be remembered presently; and mean time we shall find his Apostles delivering themselves in language corresponsive to the above.</HI> The law was given by Moses, <HI>says St.</HI> John, but grace and peace came by Jesus Christ. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John i. 17.</NOTE>In this was manifested the love of God towards us, <HI>says the same Apostle,</HI> be∣cause that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love; not that we loved God, but that he loved us; and sent his Son to be the pro∣pitiation for our sins. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">John iv. 9, 10.</NOTE><HI>Again;</HI> When the ful∣ness of time was come, <HI>says St.</HI> Paul, God sent forth his son, made of a woman, that we might receive the adoption of Sons. <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 4.</NOTE>This is a faithful saying, <HI>says the same Apostle,</HI> and worthy of
<PB N="138" REF="152"/>
all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 15.</NOTE><HI>And to adduce only one passage more,</HI> the grace of God that bringeth salvation, hath appeared to all men; teaching us that denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 11, &amp;c.</NOTE><HI>The question then will be how, or in what manner, we are taught to live thus; or, in other words, what we are to understand by</HI> Christ's <HI>reli∣gion, regarding it as a system of morality.</HI></P>
<P>I must beg leave then, in the third place, to put you in mind, that Christianity is not a <HI>new</HI> law, properly speaking, but a new edition, if I may so say, or promulgation of the <HI>old;</HI> agreeably to the express declaration of its Divine Author, who assures us that he <HI>came not to destroy the</HI> moral <HI>law, or the pro∣phets, but to fulfil both.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Matt. v. 17.</NOTE>The fact is, <HI>Christ blotted out the hand writing of carnal ordi∣nances,</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Col. ii. 14.</NOTE><HI>and took out of the way</HI> the whole ceremonial of Judaism, but left every thing
<PB N="139" REF="153"/>
which was intrinsically <HI>holy,</HI> and <HI>just,</HI> and <HI>good</HI> in the law, in its full force and obliga∣tion. He was the <HI>mediator of a better cove∣nant;</HI> he laid the foundation of a new system of faith, and a purer mode of worship; but he repealed not a single law of <HI>Moses,</HI> that had any thing in it properly of a moral and binding nature. A religion of this sort sup∣posed and required reformation in the lives of its professors; and accordingly our blessed Lord, in his excellent discourse on the mount, and in other places, enforces the import, and explains the obligation of many of the pre∣cepts of the <HI>Jewish</HI> lawgiver; the full sense and genuine meaning of which had been perverted by the false glosses and miscon∣structions of later ages, and particularly of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees.</HI> We find him perpe∣tually upbraiding these with their substitu∣tions of oral tradition in the room of the written word of God; and with absurdly and impiously <HI>teaching for doctrines the com∣mandments of men.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xv. 9.</NOTE>In these instances he nobly rescues the Scripture from human cor∣ruptions;
<PB N="140" REF="154"/>
and faithfully discharges the im∣portant office, not of a maker or prescriber of law, but of a doctor or expounder of it.</P>
<P>Suitably to all this, our Lord cites and refers to the law of <HI>Moses</HI> upon all occasions. <HI>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the command∣ments.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matt. xix. 17.</NOTE><HI>viz.</HI> the commandments contained in the <HI>Mosaic</HI> decalogue, was his answer to the person who had asked him, <HI>what he should do that he might have eternal lise?</HI> When the <HI>lawyer,</HI> by way of <HI>tempting</HI> him, put this question to him, <HI>which is the great commandment in the law?</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. xxii. 35.</NOTE>He mentions those <HI>two</HI> capital ones, which, though not literally to be found among the <HI>ten,</HI> virtually com∣prehended them all, namely, the <HI>love of God and of our neighbour;</HI> at once satisfying and confounding his insidious querist with this apposite and decisive reply. Accordingly when he told his disciples, that he gave them a <HI>new commandment</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">John xiii. 34.</NOTE>in his particular injunction to them to <HI>love one another,</HI> he
<PB N="141" REF="155"/>
was not teaching a <HI>new doctrine, or bringing strange things to their ears,</HI> this duty being evidently implied in the <HI>love</HI> of our <HI>neighbour,</HI> but only injoining a duty, by the practice of which his followers ought to be more espe∣cially distinguished; to which they had in∣ducements of an extraordinary nature; to which they were bound by ties and conside∣rations peculiarly Christian, and by reverence for his astonishingly great example, who so <HI>loved</HI> them, <HI>and washed</HI> them <HI>from</HI> their <HI>sins in his own blood.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. i. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>In perfect consistence with this, the Apostles <HI>preached the Gospel,</HI> after their <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Master</HI> had left the world, and was <HI>gone to his Father.</HI> They taught Gospel truths; they insisted on, (St. <HI>Paul</HI> more especially,) they rejoiced, they gloried in their deliverance from <HI>bondage under weak and beggarly ele∣ments;</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 9.</NOTE>they exulted in the abolition of the ceremonial law, as a mere temporary esta∣blishment, and shadowy institution; but at the same time they regarded the moral law
<PB N="142" REF="156"/>
as of inviolable authority, and a complete standard of conduct still. When the Apostle just now named exposes the extreme folly of such transgressors of the law as stood self∣condemned; or complains of the rigour of its requisitions; or declares the impossibility of yielding meritorious obedience <HI>to it,</HI> and consequently of obtaining Salvation <HI>under it,</HI> its subsistence and obligation are supposed beyond all possible contradiction. That it <HI>could not make the comers thereunto perfect,</HI> was an argument of its own intrinsic perfection. The same great Apostle, pressing upon his <HI>Roman</HI> converts the duties of <HI>brotherly love,</HI> and universal charity, recites almost all the commandments of the second table; and subjoins that comprehensive precept of <HI>Moses</HI> just now mentioned, which he no doubt con∣sidered as inclusive of every evangelical pre∣cept, even that of <HI>loving our enemies, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</HI> St. <HI>James</HI> calls this very precept, this great social prin∣ciple, the <HI>royal law;</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">James ii. 8.</NOTE>and when he argues against the folly and presumption of a partial
<PB N="143" REF="157"/>
obedience to the divine commandments, and a commuting as it were for iniquities, rests his argument wholly in that supreme autho∣rity by which the law of <HI>Moses</HI> was enacted: <HI>he that said, do not commit adultery, said also, do not kill.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">James ii. 11.</NOTE>In short, both our Lord and his Apostles inculcated, and enlarged upon many things of practical importance, as circum∣stances admitted, and occasions required; but they taught nothing of this kind but what was reducible to the <HI>Mosaic</HI> institu∣tions, or to some general head of <HI>Jewish,</HI> or natural morality. I add of natural morality; because the law of nature, the law of <HI>Moses,</HI> and the law of <HI>Christ</HI> are, in point of mo∣rality, one and the same; the latter illustrat∣ing, explaining, enforcing, and recommend∣ing the two former, but neither <HI>adding to,</HI> nor <HI>diminishing from</HI> them. For the <HI>reason</HI> or <HI>fitness</HI> of things is absolutely unalterable; and whatever is in its own nature morally good or evil, has always been so, and will for ever continue so to be.

(u)</HI> To maintain or to imagine other∣wise, is to <HI>charge God foolishly;</HI> and to sup∣pose both the law and the Gospel to prescribe a practice in some instances unnatural and unreasonable.

<P>This is precisely the morality of our Di∣vine Legislator. Forgiveness of enemies, &amp;c. is a great point of morality which the hea∣thens were far from being unacquainted with.

<P>If we regard our Saviour under any cha∣racter inferior to that of the true God; at least if we regard him merely as a man, or as a law-giver, we shall find few or no marks of that originality by which the founders of all persuasions, religious or philosophical, are distinguished. As a prophet, he was <HI>like unto Moses,</HI> according to the express prediction of the latter; as a worker of <HI>mi∣racles,</HI> he stood supereminent, but not single; as a teacher, or instructer, he followed pre∣cedents; his apologues and allegories were agreeable to the oriental mode, and many of his parables were borrowed from the <HI>Jews;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Whitby on Matt. 6. v. 9.—13. v. 10.</NOTE>even that excellent form of prayer which he taught his disciples was almost entirely taken out of the <HI>Jewish</HI> liturgies; and the sacraments which "he ordained in his

<HI>Moses is here.</HI> How does <HI>Socinianism</HI> shrink before such considerations as these!</P>
<P>But it is little material which of two errors may be most plausible, when both are equidistant from the centre of truth. Our blessed Saviour is no more <HI>half-God</HI> than he is <HI>all man,</HI> if I have leave so to express myself; nor will <HI>Arianism</HI> fix a firmer basis of faith by its chimerical expedient of a secondary worship, and a gradation of Deity.

It must be equally idolatrous, equally injurious to the honour of the Supreme Being, to ac∣knowlege <HI>Gods many,</HI> or Gods few, or only one God <HI>besides</HI> him. Infinite almost as the number of subaltern deities was among the Heathens, there is no doubt but the wisest of them at least acted nearly upon <HI>Arian</HI> principles; <HI>viz.</HI> under a persuasion of the existence and properties, and with a reser∣vation of the prerogatives of the one Su∣preme God. According to universal tradi∣tion,
<PB N="154" REF="170"/>
the notion of a supreme power, a self-existent, independent Being, a first cause of all things, prevailed more or less every where in the world. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shuckford's Sac. and Prof. Hist. connec.

set in a very strong light by <HI>Pagan</HI> authors; particularly by <HI>Pythagoras, Plato, Anaxago∣ras, Cicero, Porphyry, Seneca, Homer,</HI> and the <HI>Greek Dramatists. (x)</HI> I have not time or occasion to produce my authorities here. The truth is, many <HI>goodly pearls</HI> of specula∣tive doctrine are to be found amongst the rubbish of <HI>Pagan</HI> antiquity; and they stri∣kingly contrast an enormous <HI>farrago</HI> of tra∣ditionary error, radical prejudice, vulgar folly, and popular superstition. They are the sentiments of minds that seem to have been enlightened beyond the conceptions of the bulk of mankind. If we separate the carnal <HI>dross</HI> from the spiritual <HI>bullion</HI> of hea∣thenism, we shall be able to extract a body of theoretic divinity from the old <HI>Pagans,</HI> little if at all inferior to the finest <HI>unitarian</HI> system.

<P>Surely a <HI>Tully,</HI> or a <HI>Plato,</HI> had as admissible an apology for his conformity to idolatrous

services, in general prepossession, and national establishment, as the modern unbeliever has for his secondary worship, in any distiction he may affect to make between <HI>Pagan</HI> and <HI>Arian</HI> theology. For unless the holy Scrip∣tures direct us in the plainest manner, and with all possible cautiousness of expression, NOT <HI>to honour the Son even as we honour the Father;</HI> if they do not clearly and uni∣formly distinguish between <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> and the <HI>Supreme God,</HI> in point of <HI>nature,</HI> or <HI>essence;</HI> or, in other words, if <HI>Arianism</HI> has not a most firm foun∣dation in the sacred pages, and in apostolical and primitive worship, we cannot honestly resolve it into any thing but the pride of human reason, fabricating its own theory, and <HI>resisting the Holy Ghost.</HI> Now the inva∣lidity of its pretences has, I persuade myself been sufficiently shewn already; and there∣fore we are to reject its hypothesis, together with that of <HI>Socinianism,</HI> as respectively aim∣ing to establish <HI>another doctrine</HI> than <HI>that</HI> we have <HI>received;</HI> as fundamentally erroneous, and absolutely repugnant to the genius and spirit of Christianity.</P>

<Q>There be some that trouble you, and would pervert the Gospel of Christ.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Apostle, as appears from the ar∣gument he prosecutes throughout this epistle, had, in the words just read, an eye to those <HI>Jewish</HI> converts who were so zeal∣ously attached to the <HI>Mosaic</HI> ritual, the <HI>law</HI> of their <HI>fathers,</HI> that they could not endure to see it superseded by the more liberal, the more pure, the more sublime principles of the Gospel. But I shall avail myself of the latitude my text admits; not hesitating to regard as <HI>perverters</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> those here∣tics of different sorts, whose unfairness, or
<PB N="160" REF="175"/>
imbecility of allegation, construction, and exception on the part of infidelity, I stand engaged to make appear in the following discourse.</P>
<P>That pride, or prepossession should be te∣nacious of any opinion however strange, or however extravagant, will be no matter of surprize to us when we recollect, that almost every thing which we see not by immediate intuition, or which is not capable of a strictly mathematical demonstration, may be started, and upheld for a subject of dispute. It is possible indeed, and it sometimes happens, that men shall reason injudiciously and in∣conclusively even in a righteous cause; and truth may suffer, or rather be supposed to suffer by precipitance of passion, or inadver∣tency of zeal. This before now has been the case with the cause before us. A pious wish to confirm the doctrine of the <HI>Trinity</HI> by producing multifarious evidence, and heaping proof upon proof; <HI>(y)</HI> or an earnest endeavour to elucidate a point, the knowlege of which is too wonderful and excellent for
<PB N="161" REF="176"/>
the attainment of human wisdom, by meta∣physical nicety, and the sagacity of abstract speculation; <HI>(z)</HI> or by studied similitudes, and artificial allusions, to bring it nearer to our conceptions; all this has been hurtful to the interest of religion, and <HI>given occasion to the enemy</HI> to ridicule, if not to <HI>blaspheme.</HI> Erroneous constructions, and misapplication of particular passages, betray too often a want of moderation, or of skill in interpreters. But, all this while, a charge of unskilfulness, or of prevarication, or of perverseness, or of presumption, or of insincerity, or of intem∣perance, will come with a very ill grace from our adversaries; and we are to look on the side of infidelity for the most visible signs of weakness, and the surest tokens of conscious distress. I am apt to believe, you will soon be convinced by a few select particulars that this is not arbitarily, or groundlessly said.</P>
<P>I shall hardly be called upon to apologize for freedoms I shall be obliged to take with authors who are no more. It will be ac∣knowleged, with respect to every <HI>Arian</HI> &amp;c.

of note, that, to mischievous purpose, he <HI>being dead yet speaketh.</HI> To proceed then.</P>
<P>That when we are baptized <HI>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,</HI> we are baptized in the name of three Persons, and of three Divine Persons, and of three equally Divine Persons, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lightfoot's Harm. of the N. Test. Sect. 92. p. 273.</NOTE>seems not to be more evident from Scripture than from the reason of the thing. For else we are baptized in the name of <HI>two</HI> Persons and <HI>one</HI> virtue or quality, &amp;c. which is a notion pal∣pably ridiculous; or we are baptized in the name of <HI>three</HI> Persons, betwixt the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>two latter</HI> of which there is an infinite dis∣parity; (there being no medium between God and a creature;) which is a supposition not less ridiculous. And, in fact, the <HI>Bap∣tismal Form</HI> is so strong, that heretics have found themselves under a necessity of chang∣ing it; or of explaining it away; some bap∣tizing into the <HI>death of Christ;</HI> some <HI>in the name of the uncreated God, and in the name of the created Son, and in the name of the sancti∣fying</HI>
<PB N="163" REF="178"/>
<HI>Spirit, created by the created Son.</HI> Dr. <HI>Clarke,</HI> to whom <HI>Arianism</HI> is under great ob∣ligations, writes as follows. <HI>We are baptized,</HI> says he, <HI>into the profession of that belief, and an obligation to the practice of that religion, which God the Father has revealed and taught by the Son, and confirmed and established by the Holy Ghost.</HI> If this is extrication, what is difficulty? <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See a late work entitled An Elucidation of the Unity, &amp;c. p. 59. where this <HI>Form</HI> is treated with equal freedom.</NOTE></P>
<P>The same learned author paraphrases the introduction to St. <HI>John</HI>'s Gospel in the fol∣lowing words: <Q>With God the Father, the FIRST, the SUPREME cause and original of all things, there existed <HI>before all ages</HI> that <HI>Divine Person</HI> whose name is called the <HI>Word of God,</HI> the <HI>only begotten of the Fa∣ther,</HI> the <HI>brightness of his glory,</HI> and by ineffable COMMUNICATION of divine power and perfections, the <HI>express image of his Person.</HI></Q> The fine artifice of this para∣phrase will escape a common, or a cursory reader. I guess, Dr. C—would never have consented to the least alteration in this pas∣sage,
<PB N="164" REF="179"/>
or have permitted us only for <HI>ineffable</HI> to read <HI>eternal.</HI> The phrase—<HI>before all ages</HI>—is designedly ambiguous; and imports merely an acknowlegement of the impossibility of fix∣ing the date of the generation of the <HI>Son of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the beginning was the word,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John i. 1.</NOTE>says St. <HI>John;</HI> i. e. (if we will hearken to the <HI>So∣cinians,) Jesus Christ</HI> existed when the Gos∣pel was first preached by <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist;</HI> or, if you please, by himself. <HI>The word was with God;</HI> i. e. was <HI>known to God, and to God only;</HI> or, <HI>was with God, by</HI> being <HI>taken up into heaven to receive his prophetic commission,</HI> agreeably to a parallel exposition of another passage, which will be presently noticed, and both by the same interpreters. <HI>The word was God, viz.</HI> in a secondary or derivative sense; in a sense implying <HI>Christ's</HI> priority and supe∣riority to all other creatures; so that if we take this whole sentence together, <HI>the word was with God, and the word was God,</HI> the term <HI>God</HI> is to be understood in the proper sense in the first clause, and in an improper and inferior sense in the second: as Dr. C.
<PB N="165" REF="180"/>
and others, according to a judicious writer's remark, <HI>ingeniously</HI> expound this passage!</P>
<P><HI>No man hath ascended into heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii. 13.</NOTE>are the words of our Lord himself in the same Gospel. Perhaps the <HI>Socinian</HI> construction of this text which was just now laid before you is little less ro∣mantic than <HI>Grotius</HI>'s exposition of the words—<HI>he that came down from heaven,</HI> i. e. says this famous commentator, he that <Q>was sent, or given to us by the special Grace of God.</Q></P>
<P>As some interpreters make, or, more pro∣perly, invent a distinction between primary and secondary worship, and would fain have us believe in a created creator, or a deity by delegation, so others of a very different stamp <HI>think</HI> of the <HI>Saviour of the world</HI> as meanly as they can possibly <HI>think,</HI> and divest him of almost every ray of glory. <HI>The word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,</HI> says St. <HI>John.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John i. 14.</NOTE>
<PB N="166" REF="181"/>
<HI>Christ</HI> was born <HI>mortal, subject to infirmities and sufferings,</HI> &amp;c. say some <HI>Socinian</HI> exposi∣tors: the <HI>word</HI> WAS <HI>flesh,</HI> simply and abso∣lutely, say others: the <HI>word</HI> was MADE, or CONVERTED into <HI>flesh,</HI> says the <HI>Flandrian Anabaptist.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI> assures the <HI>Colossians,</HI> that in <HI>Jesus Christ dwelleth all the fulness</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Col. ii. 9.</NOTE><HI>of the Godhead bodily; viz.</HI> all the will of God as we are given to understand by <HI>Socinus. Before Abra∣ham was,</HI> I AM, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John viii. 58.</NOTE>says our Lord expressly to the <HI>Jews;</HI> by which he means only to affirm, according to some interpreters, that he was the <HI>Messiah before Abraham was the father of many nations;</HI> or, as others expound, shall I say? or wrest this scripture, that he existed, or WAS before <HI>Abraham</HI> in the <HI>pur∣pose</HI> and <HI>decree</HI> of God. How far the name of <HI>Grotius</HI> dignifies this exposition, let every intelligent hearer judge. Or, let us see whe∣ther we are like to derive more satisfaction from the following explanation or rather evacuation of this text by the celebrated

author of the <HI>Scripture doctrine of the Trinity.</HI> <Q>Before Abraham was, and before all <HI>gene∣rations,</HI> I had a being with him of whom <HI>Moses</HI> told the <HI>Isralites,</HI> that his name was I AM.</Q></P>
<P>That often justly cited passage in the 9<SUP>th</SUP>. Chapter of the Epistle to the <HI>Romans, of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever,</HI> is a rankling <HI>thorn</HI> in the <HI>eyes</HI> of unbelievers, which Dr. C. wished to <HI>extract</HI> with the <HI>poultice</HI> of a devised ambiguity. He would have us be∣lieve that the original <HI>Greek</HI> is of a doubtful construction, and may signify either, <HI>of whom Christ came; God who is over all be blessed for ever;</HI> or, <HI>of whom Christ came, who is over all; God be blessed for ever.</HI> To this text we shall have occasion to turn again.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arians</HI> in general confess that the Di∣vine Personage who so often, and sometimes so magnificently makes his appearance under the Old Testament, is <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the <HI>Son of God;</HI> yet when this transcendent Being
<PB N="168" REF="183"/>
expressly says,—<HI>I am the God of Bethel,</HI>—we are to understand him as in effect saying only, <HI>my Father, whom I represent, is God of Bethel.</HI> Such is the sense of these exposi∣tors; who however kindly and <HI>logically</HI> grant that <HI>the Word was with God,</HI> or, in plain terms, existed from all eternity, tho' not <HI>actually,</HI> yet <HI>potentially!</HI> One is tempted to speak ludicrously by the extravagance of these conceits. Is not this <HI>making the word of God of none effect</HI> thro' wantonness of interpretation? Is not this turning holy Scripture, which should be the <HI>rule of faith,</HI> into a mere play-thing of fancy?</P>

creation of the world.</Q> But, observe, he was a Creator merely by commission; &amp;c. <Q>it being (according to this author) unfit and impossible for the DIVINE NATURE ITSELF, or at least THAT OF THE FA∣THER, to be so much, and in such a manner concerned with the corporeal world, and the sinful race of mankind, as we every where find this DIVINE PERSON, our blessed Mediator, to have been.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whiston's Solution, &amp;c. p. 254.</NOTE>And so we are obliged to this philosopher for his wonderful discovery, that <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> tho' a DIVINE PERSON with all the attributes &amp;c. and the "incommunicable name of the God of <HI>Israel,"</HI> was yet without the DI∣VINE NATURE, because it is impossible for the DIVINE NATURE to act in the abstract; or at least for THAT of the FATHER to do so, which, it seems, is something <HI>distinct</HI> from, or superior to the <HI>Divine!</HI> If this is not Christianity, it is tolerable Platonism.</P>
<P><HI>But the grand expedient to which a late∣mentioned Divine, and indeed the</HI> Arian
<PB N="170" REF="185"/>
<HI>fraternity have usually recourse, is yet be∣hind. Unable to with stand the united force of the several texts by which the full Divini∣ty of our Saviour is evinced, they contrive to resolve the whole of his Deity into that abso∣lute authority which, they say, he derives from his Father, and exercises jointly with him in the government of the universe. Dr.</HI> Clarke <HI>not unartfully tells us, that</HI> <Q>the reason why the Scripture, tho' it stiles the Father God, and also stiles the Son God, yet at the same time always declares that there is but one God, is, because in the monarchy of the universe there is but one authority, origi∣nal in the Father, derivative in the Son: the power of the Son being not another power opposite to that of the Father, nor another power co-ordinate to that of the Father, but itself the power and authority of the Father, communicated to, manifested in, and exercised by the Son.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Scrip. Doc. of the Trin. Prop. 39. See Stephens's Sermon on the eternal generation, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>But did not, or would not this able writer recollect, that something besides power was communicated, when the <HI>Father gave to the</HI>
<PB N="171" REF="186"/>
<HI>Son to have</HI> LIFE <HI>in himself?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 5. v. 26.</NOTE>From which passage I take occasion to observe, that when an ambiguous word occurs in any passage of Scripture; or a term, which independently considered, appears to denote communication from the Father, and inferiority in the Son, its signification is generally qualified and re∣strained by the plain tenor and importance of the whole sentence. This is eminently the case with the text last quoted. <HI>As the Father hath life himself,</HI> says our Blessed Lord, <HI>so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.</HI> In this phrase—<HI>having life in himself,</HI> (which is a periphrasis of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the first and most essential name of the Deity,) the self-exis∣tence both of Father and Son from all eter∣nity is necessarily implied: because tho' the word <HI>given</HI> imports communication of an incomprehensible kind, yet such communi∣cation must have been from eternity. To assert, that the Father gave self-existence to the Son from all eternity at any supposed period of time, would be neither more nor
<PB N="172" REF="187"/>
less than a contradiction in terms. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See this text miserably distorted in Locke's Reasonab. of Christian. p. 67.</NOTE>It may be worth while to adduce two or three instances more. <HI>By him, viz.</HI> by <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> says St. <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Colossians, were all things created that are in Heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, &amp;c. all things were created by him and for him.</HI> Ch. 1. 16. Does not all this imply <HI>unoriginateness?</HI> Is not <HI>Christ</HI> represented here as absolutely the Creator? Yet in this very chapter reference is had to the Gospel-dispensation, and in that reference terms must necessarily be used importing subordination and inferiority. So in the 1st. chap. of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> where <HI>Christ</HI> is styled <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega, the beginning and the ending,</HI> &amp;c. the same reference is made. <HI>I am he that liveth, and was dead.</HI> So again, <HI>the Word was with God,</HI> says St. <HI>John;</HI> and this expression does not necessarily im∣ply equality, or coexistence. But what fol∣lows?—<HI>The Word was God.</HI></P>
<P>We not unfrequently meet with interpreters who agree in opposition to the catholic sense of a passage, but differ in the mode of
<PB N="173" REF="188"/>
it; who, like contrary qualities in bodies counteracting each other, mutually defeat their respective ends by repugnancy of con∣struction. We will turn to one or two sin∣gular instances of this.—<HI>By whom also</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 1. 2.</NOTE><HI>he made the worlds,</HI> says the Apostle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> speaking of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> One should hardly think these words liable to be misunderstood. But <HI>Grotius,</HI> unwilling, as it should seem, that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> should be supposed to have any concern in the creation, even as an agent or minister, gives us to know, that the <HI>worlds</HI> were <HI>made</HI> not <HI>by</HI> him, but <HI>for</HI> him, or for his sake; agreeably enough to part of a text just now cited, and agreably to the notion of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Rabbins, that the world was made for the <HI>Messiah.</HI> Now, in the first place, not to insist with Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> that this construction manifestly wrests the preposition <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, with a <HI>genitive case</HI> annexed to it, from its proper import, I wish to observe, that there is no admitting this learned writer's exposition of the place before us, and of that other passage of the Epistle
<PB N="174" REF="189"/>
to the <HI>Romans, Christ was raised from the dead</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 6. 4.</NOTE><HI>by the glory of the Father,</HI> (the single one with which he supports his interpreta∣tion,) without obscuring, or confounding our ideas of the divine operations. For, according to our author, <HI>God</HI> the <HI>Father made the worlds</HI> for the <HI>glory</HI> of his <HI>Son,</HI> but raised up that Son from the dead for his own <HI>glory.—Christ was raised from the dead for the glory of the Father,</HI> says our commen∣tator; so that by this interpretation the Apostle in effect affirms, that <HI>Christ was raised from the dead by the Father for the glory of the Father:</HI> which at best is uncouth phraseolo∣gy. But let us see how the passage will fare under the management of <HI>Socinus</HI> and his followers. These gentlemen are sensible of the powers of the preposition in question, but are equally reluctant to believe <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> to have been the Maker of the Uni∣verse.—<HI>By whom he made the Worlds;</HI> i. e. say they, by whose agency, or ministry God established <HI>a spiritual kingdom, and reconciled the world unto himself</HI> by the Gospel dispensa∣tion.
<PB N="175" REF="190"/>
Are not these several expositions as irreconcileable as light and darkness? And have we not reason in abundance rather to reject both, than to subscribe to either? I just observe farther; that <HI>Grotius</HI> had been more consistent, had he done no violence to the preposition aforesaid, and adopted the <HI>Socinian</HI> interpretation. For he is intirely of one mind with the <HI>Socinians</HI> in his explica∣tion of the above-cited parallel in the <HI>first Chapter of the Epistle to the Colossians.</HI></P>
<P>But this is not the only instance of this great writer's inconsistency with others and with himself. Convinced by ocular demon∣stration of the resurrection of his Master, <HI>Thomas answered and said,</HI> that is, say some very gravely, in effect cried out, or exclaimed, <HI>My Lord, and my God.</HI> For, it seems, this is not the language of confession, but of asto∣nishment! <HI>Grotius</HI> however sees this matter in a very different light. <Q>Hic primum, says he, ea vox in narratione Evangelica reperitur ab Apostolis Jesu tributa, post∣quam scilicet sua resurrectione probaverat,
<PB N="176" REF="191"/>
se esse a quo vita et quidem aeterna ex∣pectari deberet. Mansit deinde ille mos in Ecclesia, ut apparet non tantum in scriptis Apostolicis, ut in nono capite Epistolae ad Romanos commate quinto, et veterum Christianorum, ut videre est apud Justinum Martyrem contra Tryphonem, sed et in Plinii ad Trajanum Epistola, ubi ait Chris∣tianos Christo, ut Deo, carmina cecinisse.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Grotius in loc.</NOTE></P>
<P>And yet we are not much obliged to this eminent commentator for an acknowlege∣ment which appears to have been forced from him. In the first place, it is not true that Christ is styled God purely because he is <HI>the resurrection and the life,</HI> as is here more than intimated. It is not true, that he is so called by the Apostles and first Christians, merely on the strength of the passage before us. For though the terms in which St. <HI>Thomas</HI> de∣clares his conviction, <HI>My Lord, and my God,</HI> occur not before, nor possibly could, Christ is not only in effect in many places, but also expressly styled God in this Gospel. In the next place it is worth remarking, that this
<PB N="177" REF="192"/>
author in some sort at least asserts the Divi∣nity of Christ from a text, of which, when he takes it separately in hand, he questions the authenticity. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Grotius on Rom. ix. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>The truth is, we find too many among us perpetually leaning to the side of infidelity, by softening and qualifying as much as pos∣sible the sense of texts which are quoted every day on the part of the orthodox. An eminent commentator supposes the first prayer of the Apostles, <HI>Thou Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,</HI> to be address'd not to <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> but simply to God. <HI>Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved,</HI> says St. <HI>Peter</HI> in his discourse on the <HI>day of Pentecost;</HI> i. e. says Dr. <HI>Pyle,</HI> <Q>Whosoever shall believe and embrace his religion;</Q> which paraphrase plainly reprobates the idea of invocation on <HI>Christ.</HI> The reference of the words <HI>he is Lord of all,</HI> in St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s ad∣dress to <HI>Cornelius,</HI> either to God the Father,
<PB N="178" REF="193"/>
or to <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> is at best perversely sin∣gular; and surely neither just nor natural. <HI>To this end,</HI> says St. <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Romans, Christ both died and rose, &amp;c. that he might be Lord both of the dead and living;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 9.</NOTE>i. e. (ac∣cording to our author's inadequate illustra∣tion,) that <Q>he might be the Saviour and rewarder of all good Christians.</Q> St. <HI>Paul</HI> wishes <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> to the Church at <HI>Co∣rinth, &amp;c; to them that are called to be saints,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i. 2.</NOTE><HI>with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, &amp;c; viz.</HI> (as the same writer interprets the passage,) <Q>to all who worship God through <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the Lord and Saviour of all that profess his religion.</Q> In the second Chapter of this Epistle, the Apostle calls our Saviour <HI>the Lord of glory;</HI> meaning, it seems, thereby simply the <HI>Messiah. God was manifest in the flesh,</HI> says the same Apostle to <HI>Timothy;</HI> which, being interpreted by this writer, is only equi∣valent to <Q>the Son of God took upon him our nature.</Q> In short, our author's notion
<PB N="179" REF="194"/>
of the whole <HI>mystery</HI> of the Gospel seems to be lamentably insufficient, when he tells, and in more places than one tells us, that it sig∣nifies only the admission of <HI>Gentiles</HI> as well as <HI>Jews</HI> into the Christian covenant.</P>
<P>But a very recent instance of perverse in∣terpretation in the work of a sensible and specious author <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Taylor. See his <HI>Key</HI> to the Apostolical Writings.</NOTE>out of our Church is fit to be taken into particular consideration. In his note on that famous passage in the Epistle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> (which the Anti-trinitarians are ever attempting to press into the service of <HI>Arianism,</HI> as has already been in effect seen,) <HI>viz. of whom as concerning the flesh, Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever;</HI> this author admits the justness of the appli∣cation to our blessed Lord, who, says he, <Q>is <HI>God over all,</HI> as he is by the Father AP∣POINTED Lord, King, and Governour of all.</Q> And then he refers to several texts as declarative of such APPOINTMENT.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="195"/>
The Father judgeth no man, but hath com∣mitted all judgment unto the Son; John v. <HI>22.</HI> Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; &amp;c. John. xiii. <HI>3.</HI></P>
<P>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth; Matt. xxviii. <HI>18.</HI></P>
<P>The word which God sent unto the children of Israel preaching peace by Jesus Christ, he is Lord of all; &amp;c. Acts x. <HI>36.</HI></P>
<P><HI>God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; Phil. ii.</HI> 9. <HI>and set him at is own right hand, in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power, &amp;c. and every name that is named not only in this world, but also in that which is to come, &amp;c. Ephes. i.</HI> 21, &amp;c. <HI>He hath put all things under his feet,</HI> &amp;c. 1 <HI>Cor. xv.</HI> 27. <Q>This, says our author, is our Lord's SUPREME GODHEAD. And that he is <HI>blessed for ever,</HI> or the object of ever∣lasting blessing, is evident from Revelation v. 12, 13.</Q> <HI>Worthy is the Lamb, &amp;c. to receive blessing, &amp;c. and every creature,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="181" REF="196"/>
<HI>heard I saying, blessing, and honour, &amp;c. be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever,</HI> &amp;c. Now it is very observable that in some of the places here referred to there is not any intimation of an <HI>appointment.</HI> The annotator seems to be aware of this when it is too late; he grows jealous of the passage he had admitted; and, like one conscious of having allowed more than his hypothesis could conveniently afford, to all intents and purposes revokes his grant by a counter construction, and so at one dash deprives our Lord both of his blessedness and supremacy. For thus he pro∣ceeds. <Q>But what this part of his cha∣racter, in which he is <HI>more nearly related</HI> to believing <HI>Gentiles,</HI> than to infidel <HI>Jews,</HI> has to do with <HI>privileges belonging to the latter,</HI> doth not seem to me very clear; much less can I conceive, why the Apostle in this particular enumeration of <HI>Jewish</HI> privileges, should not mention their rela∣tion to God, <HI>as their God,</HI> in which they particularly gloried, (Chapter ii. 17.) and which was indeed the glory of all their
<PB N="182" REF="197"/>
glories, being the first and grand article in the covenant with <HI>Abraham;</HI> and which he fails not to assert among the singular privileges of <HI>Christians,</HI> (Ch. v. 11.) when he is shewing that the subjects of their glorying were not inferior to those of the <HI>Jews.</HI> How could he overlook the main article of this list? Or what if there should be a transposition of a single letter in the text, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> for <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. This will remove every difficulty. Then the <HI>English</HI> will be, <HI>of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, whose is the God over all, blessed for ever.</HI> Thus the grand privilege will be inserted to advantage, and stand at the top of a lofty <HI>climax</HI> rising from the Father, to Christ, and to God. <HI>We have indeed no copy to justify this reading.</HI> But the afore∣said considerations seem to make it pro∣bable the article (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) might be very easily transposed. This is only my conjecture.</Q></P>
<P>Now I beg leave to ask, whether our an∣notator was under an absolute necessity of conjecturing? Conjectures, I presume, are
<PB N="183" REF="198"/>
never admissible in criticism, but when they clear the sense of an author from obscurity; or when direct absurdities, or considerable difficulties are removed by them. Is either of these cases the case at present? So far from it, that unless we are to sacrifice sense to figure, and real truth to ideal climax, I affirm without ceremony the old and uni∣versal reading to be the only right one; and that this passage, abundantly plain and con∣sistent in itself, is here obscured by elucida∣tion, and marred by amendment. Mr. T. in fact smothers himself in a dust of his own raising. For though, in a spirit of true com∣passion, and in the tenderest affection to his brethren, &amp;c. the Apostle calls to mind their national character, and many of the privi∣leges they had enjoyed, yet at the time of his writing this Epistle, it should be remem∣bered, that their grand privilege of all, as our author justly terms it, that which the <HI>Jews</HI> constantly made their boast of, and <Q>which was indeed the glory of all their glories,</Q> was absolutely lost, and irreco∣verably <HI>done away</HI> for ever. God was no longer
<PB N="184" REF="199"/>
<HI>their</HI> God in any sense favourable to them; they were disowned; they were <HI>cut off</HI> by him, to use St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s words in another place; the believing <HI>Gentiles</HI> were now <Q>more nearly related to him;</Q> <HI>they</HI> were <HI>purified</HI> to be a <HI>peculiar people;</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> as <HI>Jews,</HI> had no manner of interest in the new dispensation: so that, according to this author's construc∣tion, the Apostle falsifies fact, and insults his <HI>kinsmen,</HI> by way of commiseration.</P>
<P>There is another text which the same au∣thor handles not less to his own disadvantage. <HI>Every house is builded by some man,</HI> says the writer of the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> Ch. iii. 4. <HI>but he that built all things is God.</HI> Mr. T's. paraphrase is as follows. <Q>When he saith, <HI>every house is builded by some person, but he who built all things is God,</HI> he evidently distinguishes between a <HI>subordinate</HI> and <HI>Supreme</HI> builder. But this distinction he needed not to have mentioned, had he not spoke of a <HI>subordinate</HI> builder before. For, if in the case under consideration, there be no <HI>subordinate</HI> builder at all, this dis∣tinction
<PB N="185" REF="200"/>
is nothing to his purpose. Then his argument would have been; <HI>Christ</HI> must build the house; because no one could build it but he; seeing no house is built by any but God. Whereas, contra∣riwise, he asserts a <HI>subordinate</HI> builder, and tells us such a one is consistent with God's being the <HI>Supreme</HI> original builder.</Q></P>
<P>Now, I take it, this is a mere fanciful dis∣tinction of Mr. <HI>Taylor</HI>'s own brain. The context runs thus. <HI>This man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house, hath more honour than the house: for every house is builded by some man, but he that built all things is God.</HI> Surely he <HI>that built all things,</HI> he who made the world was the very Person or Being that <HI>built the house,</HI> as the Apostle expresses it; i. e. who founded the whole <HI>Jewish</HI> OEco∣nomy, ecclesiastical and civil; and conse∣quently, though <HI>every house is builded by some man,</HI> though every institution, &amp;c. has some author, and <HI>Moses</HI> in particular may be said to be a founder in a secondary sense, <HI>Jesus</HI>
<PB N="186" REF="201"/>
<HI>Christ</HI> is strictly and properly the Supreme Architect, as we may say, as well in the one as the other of the above instances, to the total exclusion of every idea of <HI>subordination.</HI> And so this very passage in effect plainly asserts our Saviour's Divinity, and confirms the <HI>Supremacy</HI> this Gentleman appears to be extremely forward to destroy by it. It is re∣markable enough that the texts under consi∣deration have been before now a <HI>snare</HI> to un∣believers. For the <HI>Socinian</HI> gloss on them is, <Q>that Christ is as much more excellent than <HI>Moses</HI> as God is more excellent than his own people;</Q> and this superexcellence is on all hands allowed not to come one jot short of absolute infinity.</P>
<P>In consequence of the shifts to which in∣fidelity is reduced, it will add, omit, affirm, and suggest, sometimes arbitrarily, sometimes imprudently, and sometimes on weak and incompetent authority. That passage in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s first Epistle to <HI>Timothy, without con∣troversy great is the mystery of godliness;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iii. 16.</NOTE><HI>God</HI>
<PB N="187" REF="202"/>
<HI>was manifest in the flesh,</HI> &amp;c. makes so clearly for us, that the <HI>Socinians,</HI> and they who pa∣tronise them, struggle to get rid of it at all events. And that they do so purely by the help of a supposititious reading, which can be supported only by a strained, incoherent, and ridiculous construction, (according to which the <HI>mystery of godliness</HI> was <HI>manifest in the flesh,</HI> and <HI>received up into glory,</HI> &amp;c. in∣stead of <HI>Jesus Christ,)</HI> hath been abundantly shewn by many, and especially by the learned Bishop <HI>Pearson</HI> in his <HI>Exposition of the Creed.</HI></P>
<P>With a view to the elusion of certain pas∣sages in the <HI>Revelation</HI> which we have al∣ready produced as plainly expressive of the <HI>Son's</HI> coequal majesty with the <HI>Father, Gro∣tius</HI> has most unwarrantably assigned them their proper and respective <HI>thrones</HI> in heaven. <HI>He that sat on the throne, &amp;c. in primo solio, id est Deus,</HI> says he in his paraphrase of Rev. xxi. 5.</P>
<P>Supposing, for argument's sake, the merit of the <HI>trinitarian</HI> controversy to depend chiefly
<PB N="188" REF="203"/>
on the authenticity of the seventh verse in St. <HI>John</HI>'s 1<SUP>st</SUP> <HI>Epistle, there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Mr. JONES on this verse.</NOTE>I would gladly ask, whether it is not, in the nature of things, at least as reasonable to sup∣pose in general that this text was omitted by the enemies of the doctrine of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> as that it was inserted by its friends? And if so, infidelity would appear at best to stand upon a precarious foundation, as far as it depends on the spuriousness of this text; and we should surely err with more prudence and modesty on the side of the Catholic Church, than against her. But an excellent writer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Travis.</NOTE>has, in his <HI>Letters</HI> to Mr. <HI>Gibbon</HI> on this subject, evinced the genuineness of this text to the intire satisfaction of every candid and impartial inquirer; and particularly makes it appear, that <Q>the context of the Apostle is so far from receiving any injury by the retention of the verse in question, that it would lose all its genuine spirit, would be∣come unapt and feeble in its application,
<PB N="189" REF="204"/>
and therefore could hardly be said to subsist without it.</Q> To this performance I refer you with pleasure.</P>
<P>It has been urged, and with an air of con∣fidence, that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> cannot be an object of divine worship, because in that excellent form of address to the Deity which he re∣commended to his disciples, there is not the least mention made of himself, nor the most distant allusion to his office and character. A circumstance which has been considered as decisive in favour of <HI>Unitarianism.</HI> Some per∣sons have as <HI>little</HI> of <HI>knowledge</HI> as they have of <HI>faith</HI> in these matters. At the time of his dictating this mode of prayer, our blessed Lord was not, properly speaking, either the <HI>mediator between God and man,</HI> or a <HI>sacrifice for the sins of the whole world.</HI> Though there∣fore this form of devotion is used at this day with the greatest propriety imaginable, yet it was originally delivered to the disciples for their own more immediate use; as is mani∣fest from the nature of the thing, and from St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s account of this matter. <HI>It came</HI>
<PB N="190" REF="205"/>
<HI>to pass,</HI> says that Evangelist, <HI>that as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xi. 1.</NOTE><HI>And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father,</HI> &amp;c. It was not till after his Ascen∣sion, and return to his Father, that they could properly pray <HI>to</HI> or <HI>through</HI> him; that they were to <HI>ask</HI> in his <HI>name,</HI> and to <HI>receive;</HI> it was not till after he had <HI>offered one sacrifice for sin,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 12. vii. 25.</NOTE><HI>and sat down at the right hand of God,</HI> that his mediatorial character commenced, <HI>in which he ever liveth to make intercession for us.</HI></P>
<P>There are two remarkable passages in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epistles, which, as they are claimed by our adversaries with more appearance of right than the foregoing, it will be proper to take into consideration. <HI>Who</HI> (i. e. <HI>Jesus Christ) being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made him∣self of no reputation,</HI> &amp;c. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Phil. ii. 6. &amp;c.</NOTE>This text is often quoted as asserting the true Divinity of our Saviour. I am therefore concerned to deliver
<PB N="191" REF="206"/>
it from the construction which the <HI>Arians</HI> with much assurance put upon it; and which many amongst ourselves have, I think, very un∣warily admitted; subjecting themselves there∣by to the necessity of having recourse to a hack∣neyed, and after all mere verbal distinction be∣tween <HI>self-existence and necessary existence,</HI> in or∣der to reconcile their admission with orthodox principles. <HI>Thought it not robbery,</HI> &amp;c. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, i. e. (says <HI>Novatian</HI> and many with him,) he never compared himself with God the Father, <HI>nunquam se Deo Patri aut comparavit aut contulit;</HI> the reason follows, <HI>memor se esse ex suo Patre.</HI> Every <HI>Arian</HI> will abide by this explication; and how do the advocates for <HI>Novatian</HI> get clear of the im∣puted consequences? Why, says <HI>Dr. Water∣land,</HI> <Q>this interpretation of the text (sup∣posing it just) implies no more than this, that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> never pretended to an equality with the Father in respect of his <HI>original,</HI> knowing himself to be second only in order, not the first Person of the ever∣blessed Trinity.</Q> Dr. W. observes, that the whole passage in <HI>Novatian,</HI> rightly un∣derstood,
<PB N="192" REF="207"/>
affords a strong proof of the co∣equality of the two Persons; and that it is quoted accordingly by Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> in his trea∣tise <HI>de vera Christi deitate.</HI> But as this can only be done by help of the above distinction, I must ask, why <HI>Novatian's</HI> sense of this text must be admitted as the true one? He did not <HI>affect,</HI> say some, did not <HI>claim,</HI> did not <HI>take upon him,</HI> &amp;c. to be honoured as God. Notwithstanding the great authorities of <HI>Grotius, Tillotson,</HI> and <HI>Clarke,</HI> &amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Parkhurst's Note at p. 79 of his Treatise on the Divinity and Pre-existence of our Saviour.</NOTE>with which this interpretation is fortified, I can∣not help thinking the reading in use, <HI>thought it not robbery to be equal with God,</HI> not barely to be the more eligible, but indeed the pro∣per reading. For, not to insist on one cir∣cumstance in its favour, which is the non∣agreement of the several interpretations of the learned Gentlemen above-mentioned, it deserves to be noted, that though the phrase <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> would admit the construc∣tion contended for, yet the context will be found absolutely to revolt against it. Grant∣ing the phrase <HI>being in the form of God</HI> to be
<PB N="193" REF="208"/>
in itself of undeterminate signification, yet when predicated of him who is <HI>one</HI> with the <HI>Father,</HI> who <HI>was in the beginning with God,</HI> and really and truly <HI>was God,</HI> it certainly is to be regarded as synonymous with those expres∣sions; and consequently as importing an in∣tire equality with God. But herewith the construction of <HI>Novation,</HI> and of the <HI>Arians,</HI> not to say of Dr. W. himself, is totally in∣compatible. The reading in use therefore must be allowed to be not only natural, but necessary. <HI>He thought it not robbery,</HI> i. e. to be no violation of right, or justice.</P>
<P>The other passage is the following. <HI>There is one body,</HI> says the Apostle to the Ephesians, and <HI>one Spirit; one Lord, one Faith, one Bap∣tism; one God, and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</HI> Chap. iv. 4. &amp;c. The <HI>Socinian</HI> and the <HI>Arian</HI> inference from these texts is obvious; but in proof that it is an unfair one, I would remark, that had St. <HI>Paul</HI> intended here to have distin∣guished the <HI>Father</HI> from the <HI>Son</HI> and the
<PB N="194" REF="209"/>
<HI>Spirit,</HI> by this ascription of Supremacy, he would certainly have named the two latter with their severally discriminating inferior titles; and this without a needless, and I might say, impertinent combination of <HI>uni∣ties,</HI> if I may so call them. Besides, had this been the Apostle's design, how comes it to pass that supremacy is in almost the same terms ascribed in the <HI>New Testament</HI> to <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> whose <HI>throne is for ever and ever,</HI> who is <HI>Lord of all, who is over all, God blessed for ever?</HI> Or how are we to account for its being so frequently said, that both <HI>Christ</HI> and the <HI>Spirit</HI> as well as the <HI>Father</HI> is <HI>in us?</HI> If the manifest attribution of Supremacy in the texts just now cited does not exclude the <HI>Fa∣ther,</HI> why must it be understood in the place under consideration to exclude the <HI>Son?</HI> The same question may be asked with the same propriety, and with the same success, with re∣gard to the following well-known passages in the first Epistle to <HI>Tim.</HI> which, I believe, the Anti-trinitarians in general set with much assurance at the head of their authorities.</P>

Church, &amp;c; or, if the original word had been rendered the <HI>cause,</HI> or the <HI>origin,</HI> instead of the <HI>beginning,</HI> as with very sufficient war∣rant it might have been, this text is so far from affirming <HI>Christ</HI> to be a <HI>creature,</HI> that, in effect, it avers him to be the <HI>Creator;</HI> or, if it be precisely equivalent to the former ex∣pression, it will in course be reducible to the same signification. Now literally, and in his human character, <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> was not the <HI>first-born of every creature;</HI> and in his divine character he was not born or begotten at all, except in a transcendent and incomprehen∣sible sense; but he was, and is styled in a few verses below, the <HI>first-born from the dead,</HI> and in his own resurrection ascertained ours, &amp;c.

<P>So once more: <HI>When all things shall be subdued unto him,</HI> THEN <HI>shall the Son also</HI>

<HI>himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Co. xv. 28.</NOTE>In other words; when the great scheme of man's redemption shall be completed, <HI>Christ</HI> shall resign his commission into his hands from whom he received it, and his media∣torial kingdom be succeeded by the eternal kingdom of God, the <HI>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</HI> with whom the <HI>Saints,</HI> and <HI>Spirits of just men made perfect,</HI> shall live in fulness of bliss and glory. This is the obvious and in∣deed necessary construction.

<PB N="201" REF="216"/>
import. For though his reign over the Church militant shall cease, of his reign over the Church triumphant <HI>there shall be no end.</HI> The truth is, with the Evangelical plan, with the commission of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the idea of subordination, or subjection, is connected; but with regard to absolute per∣fection of essence and attribute, the comple∣ment of the Godhead, the Trinity in Unity, ever was, and for ever will be ALL IN ALL.</P>
<P>Lastly: with respect to such expressions as the following, which appear inconsistent with personality, <HI>be filled with the Spirit;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephes v. 18.</NOTE><HI>quench not the Spirit;</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. v. 19.</NOTE><HI>the Spirit which he hath given us;</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 24.</NOTE><HI>receive ye the Holy Ghost;</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">John xx. 22.</NOTE>&amp;c. it is obvious to remark, that, agreeably to a common figure, the cause and its effects are promiscuously used; and accordingly by the <HI>Spirit</HI> in all these places, and in all pa∣rallel ones, we are to understand the gifts and graces of which the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> or <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> is the dispenser. If this interpretation
<PB N="202" REF="217"/>
be not admitted, we may with equal pro∣priety and justice call in question the perso∣nality of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> in his human character, and even that of God the Father himself.

<P>On the whole then, I may fairly conclude with remarking, that, for the most part, in the arguments of <HI>Socinians</HI> we may be said to have <HI>premisses</HI> without <HI>conclusions,</HI> and in those of <HI>Arians conclusions</HI> without <HI>premisses;</HI> and that there is nothing in the feeble at∣tempts, the bold assertions, or the <HI>perverse disputings</HI> of our adversaries, I do not say to terrify, but in any degree to discourage us from <HI>striving together for the faith of the Gospel,</HI> even that <HI>faith which standeth not in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 5.</NOTE></P>

<Q>If Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT important article of our Creeds, the <HI>Resurrection of the Body,</HI> is the other great <HI>mystery</HI> which has all along been <HI>foolishness</HI> to Infidels, and a <HI>stumbling-block</HI> to many Christians. Under this article then I am to endeavour, agreeably to my engagements, to give all the satisfaction which the sensible, the candid, and the well-disposed can re∣quire.</P>
<P>I might insist that the great doctrine before us is virtually at least contained in my text:
<PB N="204" REF="219"/>
but as there is a strong propensity in human pride to consider what is propounded to our faith as insulting our understandings, it will be necessary to enter into a full and even minute discussion of the subject.</P>
<P>A late ingenious author, Dr. <HI>Sykes,</HI> very confidently asserts, that this doctrine has no manner of warrant from scriptural authority. He observes, as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> has done before him, that <Q>there is not any such expression in the New Testament as the <HI>Resurrection of the flesh;</HI> that the Scriptures often speak of a <HI>Resurrection,</HI> and of the <HI>Resurrection of the dead;</HI> but as to the <HI>Resurrection of the body, or of the flesh,</HI> there is not one word. And therefore that such an article was required <HI>at first</HI> to be professed in order to Baptism, can never be proved.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Enquiry when the Resurrection of the Body was first inserted in the Creeds. sub. init.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have already apologized for freedoms taken with the dead. The names I just now mentioned are of the first authority with unbelievers at this day; and I take a part in the controversy with a hope to con∣duct
<PB N="205" REF="220"/>
it to your content, if not by recency of argument, or reply, at least by the mode of their enforcement.</P>
<P>Now that the above expressions or phrases,—the <HI>Resurrection of the body,</HI> or <HI>the flesh,</HI> never occur in the New Testament; that this article, together with some others which Dr. <HI>S.</HI> mentions, did not make a part of the <HI>Baptismal Creed</HI> before the middle of the fourth century, may without difficulty be admitted; because if it will appear, that the <HI>Resurrection of the body,</HI> or <HI>of the flesh,</HI> is most unquestionably the doctrine of Scrip∣ture, and of the Apostolical and primitive Church, we are bound by all means to retain it; and its insertion into the <HI>Creed</HI> at <HI>any</HI> time was both proper and necessary; the original <HI>Creed,</HI> whatever it precisely was, having been reasonably enlarged, (by Dr. <HI>S</HI>'s own confession), as circumstances de∣manded, and heresies multiplied.</P>
<P>Let us enquire then, whether the doctrine of the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> as it is delivered in our
<PB N="206" REF="221"/>
<HI>Creeds,</HI> be not founded in evidence rational, scriptural, and irresistible.</P>
<P>If we consider this doctrine as a matter of opinion, and not of faith, we shall find it to have countenance in no contemptible autho∣rity. Tho' the heathens saw <HI>spiritual things</HI> in general thro' a dim <HI>glass</HI> indeed; tho' the prospect of futurity was greatly clouded to a world almost wholly corrupt in principle, and abandoned in practice, yet the notion of another state, and even of a <HI>resurrection,</HI> or of a <HI>renovation</HI> of all things, which is a <HI>resurrection</HI> in effect, was far from being universally ex∣ploded, as absolutely ridiculous, or chimeri∣cal. We are assured <HI>Zoroustres</HI> taught the doctrine of the <HI>resurrection</HI> among the antient <HI>Persians,</HI> as he himself derived it most pro∣bably from the <HI>Jews,</HI> with whom he had communications. <HI>Grotius,</HI> who, with res∣pect to this article at least, was not of <HI>doubt∣ful mind,</HI> in proof of the admissible possibi∣lity of the thing, cites the authorities both of historians and philosophers, and affirms it to have been the tenet of almost the whole sect of the Stoics. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Grotius de vent. l. 7. and 10. Le Clerc's Notes. Prideaux Connect. v. 1. p. 103. &amp;c.</NOTE>The Grecian
<PB N="207" REF="222"/>
custom of burying the dead with their faces upwards, and looking toward the rising Sun, which is exactly the Christian mode, has a very strong smatch of this sentiment. <HI>(aa)</HI> 'Tis observable, <HI>Mahomet</HI> speaks in his <HI>Koran</HI> of the <HI>resurrection</HI> as of a doctrine known and received in the world from the beginning, and far antecedently to the <HI>Mosaic</HI> dispensa∣tion. This appears from the following pas∣sage. <Q>That this, i. e. the doctrine of the <HI>re∣surrection,</HI> is no other than fables of the ANTIENTS is, says he, the pretence of unbelievers.</Q> And indeed his learned translator remarks in his <HI>Preliminary Dis∣course,</HI> that some of the <HI>Pagan Arabs</HI> be∣lieved neither a <HI>creation,</HI> nor <HI>resurrection;</HI> but that others believed both. We are given to understand by a sensible writer, that the first <HI>Europeans</HI> who visited <HI>China</HI> found many Christian truths intermingled with the trash of fable, and tradition; that the <HI>Gentiles</HI> of <HI>Indostan</HI> have confused notions of the Trini∣ty; and in particular that the people of <HI>Ceylon</HI> believe the <HI>Resurrection of the Body.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jenkins's Reasonab. &amp;c.

<P><PB N="208" REF="223"/>
In his note at the 19th verse of the 26th chapter of Isaiah,—<HI>Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise,</HI> &amp;c. the learned Bp. <HI>Lowth</HI> observes, that the doctrine of the <HI>resurrection of the dead</HI> must have been "a popular and common doctrine" among the <HI>Jews,</HI> at the time of the delivery of this prophecy; and we may reasonably make the same inference from a parallel passage in <HI>Daniel;—many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake; &amp;c. many,</HI> as I find it noted by the judicious commentator, being here and elsewhere manifestly equivalent to <HI>all.</HI></P>
<P>That the notion of a <HI>Resurrection,</HI> accord∣ing to the common acceptation of the term, prevailed among the <HI>Jews</HI> in our Saviour's time, will be soon manifest from certain occurrences and passages in the evangelical writings. St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in his apology before King <HI>Agrippa,</HI> affirms it to have its founda∣tion in the <HI>hope of the promise made unto the Fathers:</HI> tho' when, where, or in what man∣ner, he mentions not. And certain it is that the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> the <HI>straitest</HI> and most
<PB N="209" REF="224"/>
considerable <HI>Sect</HI> among them, not only en∣tertained this notion with seriousness, but contended for it with vehemency; as ap∣pears from the violence of opposition be∣tween them and the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> who as stre∣nuously denied it. What then did both parties understand by it? Let us, for a resolution of this question, turn first to the account which the evangelists give us of a discourse held by the <HI>Sadducees</HI> with our Saviour, on the subject of the <HI>Resurrection. The same day,</HI> says St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> and much in the same words, St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and St. <HI>Luke</HI> after him, <HI>came to him the Sadducees, who say that there is no Resurrection, and asked him, saying, Master, Moses said, if a man die having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother: now there were with us seven brethren; and the first when he had married a wife, deceased; and having no issue left his wife to his brother; likewise the second also, and the third, to the seventh. And last of all, the woman died also. Therefore in the Resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven, for they all</HI>
<PB N="210" REF="225"/>
<HI>had her.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. 22. 23. &amp;c.</NOTE>The argument herein implied is indeed perfectly ridiculous, and grossly car∣nal; and is exposed accordingly by our blessed Lord in his reply to it: but it unde∣niably supposes the <HI>resurrection</HI> of the <HI>bodies</HI> of these same <HI>brethren</HI> and their <HI>wife,</HI> agre∣ably to the <HI>Pharisaical</HI> hypothesis. Indeed that very reply plainly supposes the same thing. <HI>Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marri∣age, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</HI> All this is abundantly confirmed by our Saviour's own argument immediately follow∣ing. <HI>As touching the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</HI> There is neither connection, nor indeed sense in this portion of scripture∣history, unless we suppose the re-union of the <HI>souls</HI> and <HI>bodies</HI> of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Isaac,</HI> &amp;c. in the <HI>resurrection;</HI> and that our Sa∣viour
<PB N="211" REF="226"/>
meant by implication to assert it. For his argument directly proves nothing more than the immortality of the soul, and its consequential existence in a future state. But had this proof been the sole object of his discourse, he would most assuredly have ex∣pressed himself in a very different manner upon the occasion. Our Lord's meaning is yet more fully discovered by St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s ac∣count of this matter. <HI>Now that the dead are raised,</HI> says he, according to that Evangelist, EVEN <HI>Moses shewed at the bush,</HI> saying, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Again: When our Lord told <HI>Martha,</HI> that her <HI>brother,</HI> newly deceased, should <HI>rise again, she said unto him,</HI> says the sacred text, <HI>I know that he shall rise again in the resurrec∣tion at the last day.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xi. 24.</NOTE>Now that <HI>Martha</HI> be∣lieved her <HI>brother should rise again at the last day</HI> with that <HI>body</HI> which was laid in the grave, and had been <HI>dead four days,</HI> is evi∣dent enough from this consideration; that, though she appears to have been doubtful of the possibility of his resurrection at <HI>that</HI> time,
<PB N="212" REF="227"/>
and in so <HI>extraordinary</HI> a way, <HI>Lord,</HI> says she, <HI>by this time he stinketh,</HI> and this notwith∣standing <HI>her</HI> avowed belief that <HI>whatsoever</HI> our Saviour would <HI>ask of God, God would give it</HI> him, and <HI>his</HI> declaration that he was him∣self <HI>the resurrection and the life,</HI> yet when <HI>Lazarus</HI> actually <HI>came forth,</HI> neither she nor the many <HI>Jews</HI> who were present shewed the least sign of amazement. It does not appear that they were in any degree astonished at this mode of his restoration to life; and there∣fore we may justly presume they were per∣suaded that <HI>in the resurrection at the last day</HI> "all men shall rise again with their bodies," through the operation of that omnipotent power which, <HI>in the twinkling of an eye,</HI> is able to inspire life and vigour into dust and ashes, and animate corruption itself.</P>
<P>The supposed <HI>resurrection</HI> of <HI>John the Baptist</HI> may be considered in the same point of view. <HI>Herod,</HI> hearing of the <HI>fame of Je∣sus, said unto his servants,</HI> as the Evangelist acquaints us, <HI>this is John the Baptist, he is risen from the dead, and therefore mighty</HI>
<PB N="213" REF="228"/>
<HI>works do shew forth themselves in him. Herod</HI> hardly thought these <HI>works</HI> were done by the spirit or apparition of the <HI>Baptist;</HI> and if not, we must conclude that he believed him to be risen indeed, according to the notions entertained by the <HI>Jews.</HI> The sacred his∣tory informs us the <HI>Sadducees</HI> were <HI>grieved</HI> that the Apostles <HI>preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</HI> And is it not as plain as implication can make it, that their doctrine was, that the followers of Jesus, and indeed all men, should be raised in like manner as he was?</P>
<P>The truth is, of this kind of implied evi∣dence we have plenty in the sacred volume. I will only produce one piece more of Gos∣pel-history, in presumptive proof that <HI>Gen∣tiles</HI> as well as <HI>Jews</HI> understood by a <HI>resur∣rection</HI> what we do at this day. St. <HI>Paul</HI> concludes his discourse to the <HI>Athenians</HI> with insisting on the certainty of a future judg∣ment from the <HI>assurance</HI> which God had <HI>given to all men</HI> of it, by his having <HI>raised that man, whom he had ordained to be their judge,</HI>
<PB N="214" REF="229"/>
<HI>from the dead. And when they heard of the re∣surrection of the dead,</HI> says the historian, <HI>some mocked;</HI> but <HI>others said, we will hear thee again of this matter.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 32.</NOTE>Now St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s audi∣ence consisted chiefly of <HI>Stoics</HI> and <HI>Epicu∣reans;</HI> and the latter most undoubtedly were the party that derided the doctrine which the former did not conceive to be altogether ex∣travagant, or ridiculous. But had the Apos∣tle meant only to inculcate the general doc∣trine of a future state, the <HI>Stoics</HI> in all pro∣bability would have been satisfied as to that point without a farther hearing; and the <HI>Epicureans</HI> would have no more <HI>mocked,</HI> or insulted, than if a <HI>Stoic</HI> had preached it.</P>
<P>Indeed there is one circumstance in the evangelical history which at first glance may be thought to militate against what has been laid before you. When our Saviour <HI>came down from the mountain</HI> after his <HI>Transfigura∣tion,</HI> with <HI>Peter, James, and John, and charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen</HI>

<HI>from the dead, they kept that saying with them∣selves, questioning one with another, what the rising from the dead should mean.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mark ix. 10.</NOTE>But that they could not possibly doubt what was to be understood by the expression, or the thing itself, is demonstrable from preceding con∣siderations; and therefore the case must have been this. They were perplexed with the account our Lord had given of himself; they could not conceive how their Master, whom they still regarded as a temporal deliverer, should suffer and be put to an ignominious death, (as he had assured them he should in the 31<SUP>st</SUP> v. of the last Chapter;) or how the expected deliverance would be effected by, or after such resurrection: this was probably the subject of their enquiry; they <HI>questioned one with another,</HI> not what THE, but what HIS <HI>rising from the dead should mean.</HI> All this is perfectly consistent with a parallel passage in St. <HI>Luke. He took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Je∣rusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be ac∣complished.</HI>
<PB N="216" REF="231"/>
<HI>For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully in∣treated and spitted on; and they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again. And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.</HI> Luke xviii. 31.</P>
<P>What has already been advanced will ob∣viate a common assertion, or insinuation, that there is a very material difference between the case of a body which has been dead a few days, or months, or even years, and of one which has been buried in the earth many centuries since; and that the same Power which is able to effect a <HI>resurrection</HI> in the former case, cannot be conceived adequate to the like operation in the latter. And indeed it deserves to be remarked, that to maintain, or to intimate this, is at best to make ex∣tremely free with Omnipotence, and in fact only begs a question instead of satisfying it. Besides, this expedient will appear to be hea∣vily encumbered with strange inconveni∣ences;
<PB N="217" REF="232"/>
to speak much less harshly of it than perhaps in justice I should. When a finite understanding has laid the line which infi∣nite power cannot pass, it will have a fair claim to our attention; although, even were this done, the number of instances we meet with in holy writ of the same identical body's being raised from the grave, or restored to life, which had actually deceased, will how∣ever justify our supposition, that the bodies of such as shall die within a reasonable time before the <HI>last day</HI> shall be raised after this <HI>modus</HI> or manner; and agreeably to the com∣mon and natural ideas of a <HI>resurrection.</HI> It will be hard indeed if our adversaries will not allow us to take this for granted; and if they will, the same understanding which is able to measure infinity can readily inform us how, or whether with a body or without one, the bulk of mankind shall appear at the great day of final retribution.</P>
<P>I come now to revelation more clear and explicit; to plain, intelligible Scripture; with respect to which, it pains one to see so great a man as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> taking refuge
<PB N="218" REF="233"/>
in the above distinction, and indeed in the most pitiful evasions. Observe then how this justly celebrated philosopher expresses himself in the passage following. <Q>In the New Testament (wherein, I think, are contained all the articles of the Christian Faith,) I find our Saviour and his Apos∣tles to preach the <HI>resurrection from the dead,</HI> and the <HI>resurrection of the dead</HI> in many places: but I do not remember any place where the <HI>resurrection of the same body</HI> is so much as mentioned. Nay, which is very remarkable in the case, I do not re∣member in any place of the New Testa∣ment, (where the general <HI>resurrection</HI> at the last day is spoken of,) any such ex∣pression as the <HI>resurrection of the body,</HI> much less of the <HI>same body.</HI> I say, the general <HI>resurrection,</HI> &amp;c. because where the <HI>resur∣rection</HI> of some <HI>particular persons</HI> presently upon our Saviour's resurrection is men∣tioned, the words are, <HI>the graves were opened, and many bodies of saints, which slept, arose, and came out of the graves, after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared to many:</HI> of which peculiar way
<PB N="219" REF="234"/>
of speaking of <HI>this</HI> resurrection, the passage itself gives a reason in these words, <HI>ap∣peared to many;</HI> i. e. those <HI>who slept, ap∣peared,</HI> so as to be risen. But this could not be known, unless they brought with them the evidence, that they were those who had been dead, &amp;c. And it is pro∣bable they were such as were <HI>newly</HI> dead, whose bodies were not <HI>yet</HI> dissolved, &amp;c.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Essay on the Human Underst. and ch. on Identity.</NOTE></P>
<P>There is, I persuade myself, little or no∣thing in this passage but has its answer in the foregoing considerations; unless we should be kind enough to acknowlege for argument the triumphant sneer of that parenthesis, <HI>(wherein, I think, are contained all the Articles of the Christian Faith.)</HI> It might therefore be sufficient to remark, that Mr. L. seems to admit <HI>mysteries</HI> as some people dispense <HI>alms, viz. grudgingly,</HI> or <HI>of necessity;</HI> and at the same time to express our obligations to him for his indulgent concession, that <HI>bodies</HI> have been raised from the dead upon <HI>particular oc∣casions.</HI> But because this great writer may possibly be still thought by some to have hit
<PB N="220" REF="235"/>
upon an expedient, which happily helps him out of embarassment, in the stale distinction between a <HI>particular</HI> and the <HI>general</HI> Resur∣rection, let us see whether this distinction will not vanish before the ensuing argumentation.</P>
<P>I venture to aver then that the <HI>resurrection</HI> of the <HI>body</HI> of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is an especial earnest, or sure token of the <HI>resurrection</HI> of our <HI>bodies</HI> from the dead. I desire your im∣partial judgment of the texts which follow. <HI>Now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits of them that slept.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 20. vi. 14.</NOTE><HI>God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power. If we have been</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 5.</NOTE><HI>planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection. He who raised up the Lord Jesus, shall raise up us also by Jesus.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv. 14.</NOTE><HI>As the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them, even so the Son quick∣eneth whom he will.</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">John v. 21.</NOTE>These texts will be sufficient for my present purpose. Let us consider them separately a little. <HI>Now is</HI>
<PB N="221" REF="236"/>
<HI>Christ risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits of them that slept.</HI> I need not enlarge upon the <HI>Jewish</HI> practice alluded to under this figurative expression; and shall only ob∣serve, that, as the <HI>first-fruits</HI> were offerings of that identical grain of which the harvest was to follow, the <HI>resurrection</HI> of our <HI>bodies,</HI> after that of Christ, could not have been sig∣nified by a finer emblem. <HI>God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power:</HI> i. e. most undoubtedly, he will raise up us in like manner. <HI>If we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrec∣tion.</HI> The former part of this verse has some obscurity in it, which may be liable to va∣rious construction; but the latter ascertains, almost as fully as words can do, the great article before us. <HI>He who raised up the Lord Jesus, shall raise up us also by Jesus.</HI> This text is exactly parallel with that just quoted from the other Epistle to the <HI>Corinthians. As the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</HI> This proof runs rather in another line, but how∣ever
<PB N="222" REF="237"/>
will terminate in the same point. For we may safely conclude, that the Son will <HI>raise the dead, and quicken them</HI> hereafter, in the same manner in which himself and many dead persons have been already raised. We have by this time, I hope, sufficient grounds for this conclusion. And indeed St. <HI>Paul</HI> assures us, that the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ shall change our vile body that</HI> IT <HI>may be fashioned like unto his glorious body.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii. 21.</NOTE>For how, or when shall he do this, if not in the GENERAL <HI>re∣surrection at the last day,</HI> and by a change of THAT <HI>body</HI> which was deposited in the ground? Our <HI>vile body</HI> is not to be <HI>changed</HI> for ANOTHER <HI>body,</HI> but is ITSELF to be <HI>fa∣shioned like unto Christ's glorious body.</HI> Would it not be <HI>prima facie</HI> ridiculous to attempt tor∣turing the passage to any other sense?</P>
<P>Though what has been here offered can, I think, scarcely fall short of bringing convic∣tion to a mind open to it, yet it will be greatly corroborated by other passages and particulars, and especially by the doctrine
<PB N="223" REF="238"/>
contained <HI>in the fifteenth Chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians,</HI> which is almost totally spent upon this subject. In truth, there are more reasons than one for our not passing by that Chapter. If we read this por∣tion of Scripture with due attention, and impartiality, we shall be led, I presume, to this unavoidable conclusion, that the <HI>bodies</HI> of all men shall be raised, if not absolutely, totally, or numerically, yet really and truly the same as they died; or, in other words, that the <HI>bodies</HI> which shall be raised shall, with their respective souls, constitute the same per∣sons that lived before in the world: nor can this doctrine be invalidated by metaphysical subtilties, and <HI>oppositions of science falsly so called;</HI> which are much less calculated to satisfy, than to perplex and confound us. If the import of such passages as the following, <HI>it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory;</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">v. 43, &amp;c. 51, &amp;c.</NOTE><HI>it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body; behold I shew you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a mo∣ment,</HI>
<PB N="224" REF="239"/>
<HI>in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed; for</HI> THIS <HI>corruptible must put on incorruption, and</HI> THIS <HI>mortal must put on im∣mortality;</HI> if the manifest import of these texts can be evaded, so may the most studied paraphrase, or the most careful illustration of them. There will be no such thing as intelligible language to be found. The case is, the human body undergoes many changes in a course of years, e. g. from infancy to old age, which, I suppose, it will be granted, are the changes of the same body, properly speaking, still. For though it may not be easy to say precisely in what the <HI>ratio</HI> of identity consists, we may safely say, than an almost infinite number of changes and mo∣difications, which might be supposed, do not affect it. There are very few names which have a stronger claim to deference than that of Mr. <HI>Boyle;</HI> and it is an observation of his, that <Q>there is no saying what the utmost human art or contrivance may be able to effect; much less what means, even physical
<PB N="225" REF="240"/>
ones, God is able to use for the repro∣duction of bodies; of which the <HI>necessary constituent parts</HI> may be preserved consis∣tently with numberless changes from the cradle to the grave, and after death.</Q> Our great Creator at least knows what pro∣perly constitutes identity much better than we can tell him; and therefore without en∣tering fully into the state of the controversy as maintained long ago by Dr. <HI>Stilling fleet</HI> and Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> (which would be little bet∣ter than continuing a <HI>game of words,)</HI> I shall content myself with pointing out to you one or two instances of cavil, and quibble, and captiousness in the latter, which plainly enough indicate him to have been galled in many places, and are indeed altogether un∣worthy both of himself and his argument.</P>
<P>The Bishop, in vindication of his own and the catholic tenet, cites these words of our blessed Saviour, <HI>all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth.</HI> <Q>From hence, says Mr. L., your Lordship
<PB N="226" REF="241"/>
argues, that these words, <HI>all that are in the graves,</HI> relate to no other substance than what was united to the Soul in life; be∣cause a different substance cannot be said to be in the graves, and to come out of them. Which words of your Lordship, if they prove any thing, prove that the Soul too is lodged in the grave, and raised out of it at the last day. For your Lord∣ship says, <HI>can a different substance be said to be in the graves, and come out of them?</HI> So that according to this interpretation of these words of our Saviour, no other sub∣stance being raised but what hears his voice, but what, being called, comes out of the grave; and no other substance com∣ing out of the grave, but what was in the grave; any one must conclude, that the Soul, unless it be in the grave, will make no part of the person that is raised, unless, as your Lordship argues against me, you can make it out, that a substance which never was in the grave, may come out of it; or that the Soul is no substance.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>But
<PB N="227" REF="242"/>
will not this sophistical bubble burst in an instant before a most simple consideration, pursued through its necessary consequences? By a common figure, and agreeably to the customary license of speech, we talk of the acts, or operations of one of the two con∣stituent parts of man, as of the acts or ope∣rations of the whole. E. G. <HI>No soul sees me;</HI> or <HI>no body sees me; every soul heard him;</HI> or <HI>no body heard him;</HI> are expressions used in∣discriminately, not only in ordinary discourse, but in correct composition. The soul per∣ceives the <HI>voice;</HI> the body is raised by divine power, and reunited to it. <HI>(bb)</HI></P>
<P>Again: The learned prelate quotes the following words of the Apostle, in support of the doctrine of the <HI>resurrection</HI> as it is held in the Church. <HI>We must all appear be∣fore the judgmentseat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, accord∣ing to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</HI> To which his Lordship subjoins this question: CAN THESE WORDS BE UNDER∣STOOD
<PB N="228" REF="243"/>
OF ANY OTHER MATERIAL SUB∣STANCE BUT THAT BODY IN WHICH THESE THINGS WERE DONE? <Q>A man, Mr. L. answers, may suspend his deter∣mining the meaning of the Apostle to be, that a sinner shall suffer for his sins in the <HI>very same body</HI> in which he committed them: because St. <HI>Paul</HI> does not say he shall have the <HI>very same body</HI> when he suf∣fers, that he had when he sinned. The Apostle says indeed, done <HI>in his body.</HI> The body he had, and did things in at five, or fifteen, was, no doubt, <HI>his body,</HI> as much as that which he did things in at fifty was <HI>his body,</HI> though <HI>his body</HI> were not the <HI>very same body</HI> at those different ages: and so will the body, which he shall have AFTER the <HI>resurrection,</HI> be <HI>his body,</HI> though it be not the <HI>very same</HI> with that which he had at five, at fifteen, or fifty.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>Now agreeing with Mr. L. and the admirers of his doctrine upon this head, that <Q>the body which a man shall have <HI>after</HI> the resurrection,</Q> according to their scheme, (for what shall be done <HI>in</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="244"/>
or <HI>at</HI> it, we are left to conjecture,) I say, agreeing with them, that this body will be <HI>his body,</HI> yet we would fain know in what sense he could be said to <HI>receive the things done</HI> IN IT, <HI>or</HI> BY IT, according to another reading. A man has <HI>his body</HI> truly, if not numerically the same through life, under a greater or less variety of changes and modi∣fications; but by Mr. L's train of reasoning, it should seem that a man may have <HI>his body</HI> before he is in possession of it. Had the Apostle said, as a man sins in <HI>a</HI> body, so he shall suffer in <HI>a</HI> body, Mr. L's mode of ar∣guing might have been admitted; but as matters stand at present, it has evidently no logic to support it.</P>
<P>Once more. <Q>The next text of Scripture you bring for the same body, says Mr. L. is, <HI>if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is not Christ raised.</HI> From which your Lordship argues, IT SEEMS THEN OTHER BODIES ARE TO BE RAISED AS HIS WAS. I grant other dead as certainly raised as
<PB N="230" REF="245"/>
Christ was; for else his <HI>resurrection</HI> would be of no use to mankind. But I do not see how it follows, that they shall be raised with the <HI>same</HI> body, as your Lordship in∣fers in these words annexed; AND CAN THERE BE ANY DOUBT, WHETHER HIS BODY WAS THE SAME MATERIAL SUB∣STANCE WHICH WAS UNITED TO HIS SOUL BEFORE? I answer, none at all; nor that it had just the same distinguished lineaments and marks, yea and the same wounds that it had at the time of his death. If therefore your Lordship will argue from other bodies being raised as his was, that they must have proportion with his in SAMENESS, then we must believe, that every man shall be raised with the same lineaments and other notes of distinction he had at the time of his death, even with his wounds yet open, if he had any, be∣cause our Saviour was so raised; which seems to be scarce reconcileable with what your Lordship says, of A FAT MAN FALLING INTO A CONSUMPTION, AND DYING.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="246"/>
The wit here is not worth answering; and the fallacy of the paragraph was obviated in some of the foregoing observations. Suffice it to remark that the addition of one word in its <HI>proper</HI> place would have demolished all this fine fabric of reasoning. Mr. L. should have granted, that other <HI>dead</HI> and BURIED shall "as certainly be raised as Christ was." In short, we affirm, on Scriptural authority, that at the <HI>last day</HI> the <HI>bodies</HI> of men shall really be raised. The article of the <HI>resurrection</HI> in our Creeds requires only this belief. We are neither concerned in niceties of conjecture, nor obliged to adopt Mr. L's. notion of identity. <HI>(cc)</HI></P>
<P>But to return to Dr. S. I admit that this learned writer has speciously enough recon∣ciled a text or two <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See particularly Rom. viii. 11.</NOTE>to his favourite tenet, which have been generally referred to the re∣ceived doctrine. But shall plausibility be ob∣truded upon us for demonstration? Shall it overturn the credit of other interpretations
<PB N="232" REF="247"/>
of the same passages, more solid perhaps, or at least equally ingenious? Shall it supersede the authority of a very great number of texts too clear and explicit to be opposed by any thing but general assertions, bold denials, flat contradictions, and the artifice of subti∣lization? Shall it shake the faith of ages, and nullify the doctrine of the catholic Church?</P>
<P>And, after all, in this, as in the case of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> we are in effect only called upon to exchange one Creed for another. These <HI>squeamish</HI> Gentlemen who know not how to <HI>digest</HI> the <HI>wholsome</HI> doctrines of the Gospel, expect us to <HI>swallow</HI> with <HI>greediness</HI> a kind of spiritual <HI>Nostrum, prepared</HI> by human imagi∣nation. It is true, Dr. S. with all the ef∣frontery of <HI>quackery,</HI> would make us believe his <HI>dose</HI> may be <HI>taken</HI> without any sort of in∣convenience. For he roundly asserts, that <Q>the <HI>resurrection of the dead</HI> is no ways liable to any of the difficulties which the other notion MAY be liable to.</Q> Now whatever
<PB N="233" REF="248"/>
difficulties our notion <HI>may</HI> be liable to, I ask, whether that of the Doctor has not at first sight its <HI>peculiar</HI> difficulties? Indeed it will stand clear of all, if we answer the following queries suitably to the confidence with which he proposes them. <Q>May there not be a <HI>resurrection of the dead,</HI> says he, without the <HI>resurrection of flesh?</HI> May not the dead person be raised to life, and have a <HI>body</HI> given to him, suitable to the place he is to have? May not the <HI>thinking conscious</HI> person be restored, though he has not that restored which has no thought, nor consci∣ousness belonging to it?</Q> To the first of these three questions I answer absolutely—No.—A <HI>resurrection of the dead,</HI> supposes a <HI>resurrection of flesh.</HI> To the second and third I make free to reply with a few questions in my turn; and desire to ask, whether, when the <HI>graves and the sea shall give up the dead,</HI> they will not give up what was <HI>put into them?</HI> Was this the <HI>body,</HI> or was it the <HI>soul?</HI> Or, if by a <HI>resurrection of the dead</HI> we are only to understand our being invested with a <HI>new</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="249"/>
<HI>body,</HI> with what shadow of sense is this styled a <HI>resurrection?</HI> Or, if there is sense and pro∣priety in the term, may we not fairly ask, from whence is <HI>this body</HI> to <HI>come? (dd)</HI> If <HI>thought,</HI> or <HI>consciousness</HI> constitutes person, can <HI>thought or consciousness</HI> die? If not, what are we to understand by <Q>a thinking con∣scious person's being restored?</Q> Restored! From whence? Or to what? <HI>(ee)</HI> In short, whatever becomes of man after death, what∣ever may be the nature of the intermediate state, what notion can we form of <HI>thought's rising from the dead,</HI> or the <HI>resurrection of consciousness?</HI> Men will advance inconsis∣tences, and assert paradoxes sooner than be∣lieve as the Church would have them. <HI>(ff)</HI></P>
<P>This notion of a <HI>thinking person's being re∣stored</HI> does indeed correspond well enough with an opinion maintained with much ear∣nestness some years since by certain Divines, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Law. Mr. Peckard, &amp;c.</NOTE>who held, that during the state between death and the last day, the soul will <HI>sleep,</HI> as
<PB N="235" REF="250"/>
it were, and all the rational powers be sus∣pended. I shall not enter into the merits of their arguments. It will be sufficient to say, that these writers supposed the reunion of the Soul to the body at the day of judgment; and consequently, according to their notion, (for argument's sake admitting it,) the <HI>restora∣tion of the Soul</HI> to its powers, &amp;c. and <HI>the re∣surrection of the dead,</HI> are very different things.</P>
<P>Again: if we believe the Apostle's ac∣count, the instantaneous change which is to be effected in us at the <HI>resurrection</HI> will be from <HI>natural</HI> to <HI>spiritual,</HI> from <HI>corruptible</HI> to <HI>incorruptible;</HI> but we shall look in vain for such a change under any other hypothesis. They who insist, that our souls shall be united to <HI>new bodies</HI> may be allowed to sup∣pose such bodies will be <HI>spiritual,</HI> as St. <HI>Paul</HI> speaks, and <HI>incorruptible;</HI> but will they not be hard put to it to prove that <HI>these</HI> ever were <HI>natural,</HI> or <HI>corruptible?</HI> Or does this Apos∣tle's illustration of the doctrine before us by the similitude of seed sown, which <HI>is not quickened except it die,</HI> convey the least idea
<PB N="236" REF="251"/>
of a soul's awaking from sleep, and in a mo∣ment as it were recovering the use of all its faculties? Surely this cannot be the <HI>mystery</HI> which the inspired writer <HI>shews</HI> us in this chapter. But, according to our sense, the Apostolical comparison is as apt and happy as possible. The <HI>bare grain</HI> is <HI>sown,</HI> dissolves, and appears again under a new modification. <HI>So also is the resurrection of the dead.</HI> The body <HI>is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorrup∣tion. It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body;</HI> a body subtilized and puri∣fied; a body disencumbered from that <HI>flesh and blood which cannot inherit the kingdom of God,</HI> and, to adopt the high figuring of St. <HI>Paul, clothed upon with an house from heaven,</HI> and arrayed with <HI>immortality.</HI> And, all this while, in both cases, <HI>God giveth a body</HI> as it <HI>pleaseth him, and to every seed,</HI> and to every individual, <HI>his own body.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="252"/>
The learned authors we are concerned with, and their numerous admirers, seem to have forgot, or to wish us to forget, that they hold opinions declared to be heretical, and condemned as such by an inspired Apos∣tle. The author of the Epistle to the <HI>He∣brews</HI> numbers the <HI>resurrection of the dead</HI> among the <HI>principles</HI> of the <HI>doctrine of Christ.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 1, 2.</NOTE>What was the precise tenet of <HI>Hymeneus</HI> and <HI>Philetus</HI> who asserted that the <HI>Resurrection is past already,</HI> we cannot learn from the Apos∣tle who so severely censures them. But he describes them to be persons who <HI>concerning the truth</HI> had <HI>erred,</HI> and <HI>overthrown the faith of some.</HI> It is reasonably to be presumed, that they, as well as the old heretics, <HI>Basilides, Carpocrates, Menander, Valentinus,</HI> &amp;c. and the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> and <HI>Libertines</HI> of later ages, (as I find them called,) denied the <HI>resurrection of the body</HI> on much the same grounds as their successors in this heterodoxy. It has been boldly maintained, that by the <HI>resur∣rection of the dead</HI> we are only to understand
<PB N="238" REF="253"/>
a <HI>resurrection</HI> from <HI>sin</HI> to a state of <HI>grace;</HI> or a kind of <HI>resurrection</HI> from <HI>ignorance</HI> to a <HI>knowlege</HI> of truth; or, in general, the im∣mortality of the Soul. <HI>Libertini,</HI> says <HI>Calvin,</HI> as quoted by Arch-bishop <HI>Laud, rident spem omnem quam de resurrectione habemus, idque jam nobis evenisse dicunt, quod adhuc expectamus, &amp;c. ut homo sciat animam suam spiritum immortalem esse viventem in caelis.</HI> And says <HI>Peter Martyr,</HI> as cited by the same prelate, <HI>sunt etiam hodie Libertini qui eam irrident, et resurrectionem quae tractatur in Scripturis tantum ad animas referunt.</HI> The <HI>Gnostics</HI> and <HI>Valentinians</HI> af∣firmed the flesh to be incapable of incorrup∣tion. <HI>Carnis salutem negant,</HI> says <HI>Irenaeus, dicentes non eam esse capacem incorruptibilitatis. Menander</HI> had the impudence to annex the privilege of immortality to his Baptism. And among others, probably the <HI>Corinthian</HI> con∣verts affirmed the <HI>Resurrection of the dead</HI> imported no more than a <HI>renovation of life and manners, a newness of life,</HI> as St. <HI>Paul</HI> expresses it; and thus they absurdly con∣founded figure with letter, or a type with its antitype.</P>

The sower goes forth, and casts it upon the earth; and the seed which when it was sown fell upon the earth dry and naked, in time dissolves; and from the dissolution the great power of the Providence of the Lord raises it again; and of one seed many arise, and bring forth fruit.</Q>
<P>This passage is almost a direct comment on the 36th. and two following verses of the 15th. Chapter of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s first Epistle to the <HI>Corinthians.</HI> St. <HI>Clement,</HI> it must be con∣fessed, is not so happy in his elucidation of the doctrine of the <HI>resurrection of the body</HI> from the supposed death and reviviscence of the <HI>Phoenix</HI> from his own ashes, according to a current opinion in those days; the enlarge∣ment on which fabulous wonder has drawn a charge of ungenuineness on the Epistle it∣self.
<PB N="243" REF="257"/>
But the judicious Editor and Translator in his preliminary discourse vindicates the good <HI>Father,</HI> and rescues the work from this imputation in a most satisfactory manner; so that "with serious and ingenuous minds," (to borrow his own words,) this is a matter which will reflect no discredit on St. <HI>Cle∣ment</HI>'s doctrine, or on the pious zeal with which he maintained it. The reality of the doctrine is in no wise affected by the whim∣sicalness, or the weakness of the illustration.</P>
<P><Q>He that raised up <HI>Christ</HI> from the dead, shall also raise up us in like manner, if we do his will,</Q> says <HI>Polycarp</HI> to the <HI>Philip∣pians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ignatius</HI> assures the <HI>Trallians</HI> in the most positive terms, that <Q>as <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> was truly crucified and dead, so he was also truly raised from the dead by his Father, <HI>after the same manner</HI> as <HI>he</HI> will also raise up <HI>us</HI> who believe in him.</Q> <HI>(gg)</HI></P>
<P>The following extract from St. <HI>Clement's</HI> second Epistle to the <HI>Corinthians</HI> is at least as
<PB N="244" REF="258"/>
full and express as the passage a little above quoted from the first. <Q>Let not any one among you say, that this very flesh is not judged, neither raised up. Consider, in what were ye saved, in what did ye look up, if not whilst you were in this flesh? We must therefore keep our flesh as the temple of God. For in like manner as ye were called in the flesh, ye shall also come to judgment in the flesh.</Q> <HI>(hh)</HI></P>
<P>And yet all this evidence shall shrink into nothing before a little ready confidence, and unceremonious decision. For thus says the Author of the <HI>Inquiry.</HI> <Q>If we pass from the New Testament, <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Clemens</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> mention no more than the <HI>resurrec∣tion;</HI> and not any particular <HI>modus</HI> of it, or the <HI>resurrection of the flesh:</HI> vide <HI>Barna∣bas,</HI> ch. xxi. <HI>Clemens,</HI> ch. xxiv. <HI>Clemens</HI> indeed, in his second Epistle, mentions the <HI>resurrection of the flesh;</HI> but that is allowed not to be genuine. <HI>Ignatius</HI> too speaks as the Scriptures do. <HI>Ep. ad Trall.</HI> And in the larger Epistle to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> he speaks
<PB N="245" REF="259"/>
of the resurrection <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>from the dead;</HI> but he never mentions any thing of a <HI>re∣surrection of the flesh.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now if the passages I produced from St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s first Epistle, and from <HI>Ignatius,</HI> do not to all intents and purposes assert the <HI>re∣surrection of the body,</HI> or <HI>of the flesh;</HI> if St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s second Epistle must absolutely be pronounced spurious, because the learned world is divided in its sentiments relative to it; if the doctrine contained in this Epistle cannot possibly be agreeable to that of the other, or to that of <HI>Ignatius,</HI> or to that of the Apostolical and primitive Church, be∣cause it is a matter of some doubt who the author might be; if these reverend fathers speak in <HI>no</HI> place of the <HI>resurrection</HI> of the <HI>body</HI> because in <HI>some</HI> places they speak of the <HI>resurrection of the dead,</HI> or of the <HI>resurrection</HI> in general, as the holy Scripture itself occa∣sionally does; if this be the case, equivoca∣tion shall hereafter pass for argument, and dogmaticalness for demonstration.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="260"/>
One should be apt to think, that the nearer the fountain, the clearer the stream; or, in plain terms, that the most antient Christians are the most orthodox; that those who lived in, or nearest to the times of the Apostles, and Apostolical men, were like to understand their doctrine with readiness, to embrace it with veneration, and to transmit it in purity. What can be more clear than the language of <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> as it is quoted by Dr. S. himself? <Q><HI>Christ</HI> shall come a second time, when <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>he shall raise the bodies of all men that have been?</HI></Q> Well; but says our author, <Q>this was <HI>Justin</HI>'s opi∣nion, but it was not in any <HI>Baptismal</HI> Creed; he takes no notice of any article of any Creed as containing the notion of the <HI>resurrection of the flesh,</HI> whatsoever his own philosophical notion of the resurrec∣tion might be.</Q></P>
<P>Will it follow then that the doctrine of the <HI>resurrection of the flesh</HI> was purely the personal, or philosophical notion of <HI>Justin</HI>
<PB N="247" REF="261"/>
<HI>Martyr,</HI> because it was not in his time an article in any <HI>Creed?</HI> If so, it will follow, by parity of arguing, that almost all the other articles of our present <HI>Creeds</HI> were the private tenets or opinions of particular per∣sons, and not the common doctrine, or be∣lief of the catholic Church. This must fol∣low upon Dr. S's own principles. For he has himself remarked in his preface, that <Q>it is highly probable these, (referring to doc∣trines he had been mentioning,) and other doctrines were taught, <HI>(viz.</HI> after baptism,) as circumstances arose, either to explain some things inculcated in the Gospels, or to avoid something erroneous. And hence it was that the <HI>original Creed</HI> was enlarged, and more things inserted into it; and in∣deed all that has been added to it seems to have been owing to these causes.</Q> The just now cited declaration of <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> is therefore to be regarded as exactly coincident with a doctrine publickly received, and not as the bare result of his own judgment, for any thing Dr. S. has said, or proved to the contrary. But if so, the doctrine of the
<PB N="248" REF="262"/>
<HI>Resurrection of the body,</HI> or of the <HI>flesh,</HI> was an article of faith from the beginning; and its subsequent date as an article of any <HI>Creed</HI> is a circumstance of very inferior considera∣tion. What matters it to us <HI>when</HI> it was thought necessary to be required of the mem∣bers of the Church of <HI>Christ</HI> openly to pro∣fess they believed as the Apostles and primi∣tive Christians did?</P>
<P>But let me shew you how unfairly the author of the <HI>Enquiry</HI> deals by <HI>Polycarp.</HI> Of the two places in this <HI>father's</HI> epistle to the <HI>Philippians</HI> in which mention is made of the <HI>resurrection,</HI> the principal, I think, is that I not long since quoted, and will here lay again before you. <HI>He that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also raise up us in like man∣ner.</HI> The words <HI>in like manner</HI> are by the no less faithful than judicious translator printed in <HI>Italics,</HI> as not been literally contained, though necessarily implied in the original. This passage then, like many more parallel ones which I have had occasion to produce, I mean, from the Scripture itself, manifestly
<PB N="249" REF="263"/>
imports the <HI>resurrection of the body;</HI> though should any person affect to doubt what the good <HI>father's</HI> meaning may be <HI>here,</HI> they may soon learn what his idea of the <HI>resurrection</HI> was, from a part of the prayer he preferred to God in the hour of his martyrdom, according to the account we have of it in the circular epistle of the Church of <HI>Smyrna.</HI> He <HI>there</HI> makes mention of the <HI>resurrection</HI> both of <HI>soul</HI> and <HI>body.</HI> For though the <HI>soul</HI> cannot, properly speaking, be said to <HI>rise again,</HI> yet as the soul and body constitute the same man, as these constituent parts are separated by death, and reunited at the <HI>resurrection,</HI> this reunion is not unfitly expressed by a term that may be truly predicated of one of the constituent parts.</P>
<P>Dr. S. admits the genuineness of the above-mentioned narrative; and yet will not suffer us to consider the <HI>letter</HI> in one place to be an explanation of the <HI>sense</HI> in the other. There is more of art than honesty in an at∣tempt to slip out of this difficulty by saying, as the <HI>Enquirer</HI> does in the following words,
<PB N="250" REF="264"/>
that <Q>by the time this letter was wrote, the notion seems to have prevailed among Christians, that the <HI>body</HI> was to be raised, though it was not yet got into any of their Creeds.</Q> This is a sort of spiritual juggle which inverts truth, and disguises it in the same instant: it metamorphoses the real sen∣timent of <HI>Polycarp</HI> into a whimsical notion which began to gain ground in the Church!</P>
<P>But this matter may be viewed in another light. The force of truth has drawn from our author an involuntary cession of his own darling point. For immediately after the sentence last cited from him, he acquaints us, that <Q>soon after the middle of the second century disputes arose about the <HI>resurrec∣tion;</HI> the <HI>heathens</HI> objecting to the possibi∣lity of it, and the CHRISTIANS endea∣vouring to answer the objections they met with. The enquiry, says he, was, whe∣ther there was to be a <HI>resurrection</HI> of the <HI>soul</HI> alone, or of the whole man consisting of body and soul? And then a second question was, whether the <HI>flesh,</HI> the <HI>very</HI>
<PB N="251" REF="265"/>
<HI>flesh</HI> which we now bear about us, was to be raised up again? The WRITERS of that time still extant contended for the <HI>re∣surrection of the flesh</HI> together with the soul. But there does not appear to be any <HI>Creed</HI> which established such a doctrine. For whatever PRIVATE PERSONS might ima∣gine to be true, was not instantly to be <HI>professed</HI> as an article of faith, necessary to be believed in order to Baptism.</Q> And af∣terwards he tells us, that <Q>the controversy about the <HI>resurrection of the flesh</HI> did not begin till the middle, or near the end of the second century. And then as philo∣sophers objected to the <HI>resurrection</HI> ITSELF, from the common topics, <HI>how could</HI> FLESH <HI>devoured by beasts or fishes, and thus become</HI> PARTS <HI>of those animals; or perhaps reduced by fire to ashes, or disperst by seas and rivers, be restored? Athenagoras, Theophilus,</HI> and <HI>Tertullian</HI> undertook a defence of this no∣tion; and taught, that it was no ways be∣yond the power of Almighty God to restore to every one the flesh he once had.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry &amp;c. p. 18.</NOTE><HI>(ii)</HI></P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="266"/>
Now I desire to observe, in the first place, that these philosophers objected to the <HI>resur∣rection</HI> from the common topics just men∣tioned because they were the strongest that occurred to them; and because when they objected to the <HI>resurrection of the body,</HI> they most unquestionably meant to object to the <HI>resurrection</HI> ITSELF. In the next place, I would remark, that if by the CHRISTIANS, <HI>who endeavoured to answer the objections of hea∣thens,</HI> and by the WRITERS of <HI>that time,</HI> we are to understand only a few PRIVATE PER∣SONS who maintained an extraordinary opi∣nion; if <HI>Athenagoras,</HI> and <HI>Theophilus,</HI> and <HI>Tertullian</HI> did no more than defend their own personal tenets; it is passing strange these same heathen philosophers should set their <HI>wits</HI> against them at all; and stranger still, that the whole body of Christians had not joined the outcry in their own vindication, and in public disavowal of an enthusiastic and ridiculous principle. Nay this is not all. The doctrine of the <HI>resurrection of the body,</HI> if it was a mere private or personal opinion, was in fact contrary to the Gospel of <HI>Christ,</HI>
<PB N="253" REF="267"/>
and the sense of the Church; and therefore must have been regarded as a most gross, if not dangerous heresy. But as it most un∣doubtedly was never represented so to be, we are to conclude, I presume, that it was true and catholic doctrine, notwithstanding its non-appearance in any Creed, in the early ages, and though the acknowlegement of it was not a qualification for Baptism. We therefore insist, that whenever it became an article of a <HI>baptismal Creed,</HI> it was inserted with the most admissible pretensions.</P>
<P>It is, farther, very observable, that the doctrine of the <HI>resurrection of the body</HI> is most expressly taught in many places of the <HI>Koran</HI> of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> Let us turn to a few. <Q><HI>Man saith,</HI> says <HI>Mahomet, after I have been dead, shall I really be brought forth alive from the grave? Doth not man remember that we created him heretofore when he was nothing? The unbelievers say, when we and our fa∣thers shall have been reduced to dust, shall we be taken from the grave? Man saith, who shall restore bones to life when they are rotten?</HI></Q> <HI>An∣swer, he shall restore them to life, who produced</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="268"/>
<HI>"them the first time." (kk)</HI> The whole system of <HI>Mahometism</HI> is, you well know, a super∣structure raised upon the foundations of <HI>Ju∣daism</HI> and <HI>Christianity.</HI> The grand aim of the impostor seems to have been to concentre both in one faith; with which view, and that no romantic one, he in part adopted, and partly rejected the respective theories. In order to ingratiate himself with the <HI>Jews,</HI> he asserted, as we have seen, even to an ex∣tremity of zeal, the unity of the Godhead; and at the same time not to put the <HI>Chris∣tians</HI> out of all temper, as he frequently takes occasion to speak respectfully of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> so he declares probably in the most explicit terms for the great article we have been discussing. <HI>(ll)</HI> We may therefore fairly conclude from this circumstance only, that the doctrine of the <HI>resurrection of the body</HI> was not the sentiment of a few individuals, but the profession of the universal Church at the beginning of the seventh century. And after all, supposing it to be questionable whether this were really the plan of <HI>Maho∣met,</HI> the least that can be inferred from the
<PB N="255" REF="269"/>
perspicuity with which the doctrine of the <HI>resurrection</HI> is taught and enforced in the <HI>Koran,</HI> is that he conceived it to be suffici∣ently reconcileable with the common reason and apprehension of mankind; at the same time that, from this among other particu∣lars, we must see, and must desire its adver∣saries to take notice, that it is not a doc∣trine peculiar to Christianity.</P>
<P>To come now to the <HI>conclusion of the whole matter.</HI> If <HI>these things are so,</HI> if the great doctrines we have been handling are defensible upon sound principles, and have a most firm foundation in Scripture, and in pri∣mitive authority, abundant reason have we to <HI>hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering;</HI> in nothing dismayed by adver∣saries who trifle with us upon the most se∣rious subjects; who render the word of God of none effect, by perverse interpretation; who cannot, or will not see the plain sense of the plainest expressions; who will not ac∣knowlege <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> to be the Creator of the world though <HI>all things were made by him;</HI>
<PB N="256" REF="270"/>
or that he made satisfaction for sin, though he was <HI>sacrificed for us,</HI> and <HI>gave his life a ran∣som for all.</HI> I know not any thing that can equal this stubbornness and slowness of heart except the insolence of such as gravely tell us, we must not hope to propagate the Gos∣pel among <HI>Jews, Mahometans,</HI> or heathens, while the strange doctrines contained in our Creeds are retained in the Church. Is not this to all intents and purposes saying, we must not hope to eradicate infidelity till we have renounced the capital articles of our be∣lief; or, in other words, must not expect to make converts to Christianity, till we cease to be Christians? And indeed so in∣considerable are the impediments to a spiri∣tual coalition between the followers of <HI>So∣cinus</HI> and the disciples of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> that, ac∣cording to information given us by writers of credit, terms of union and amity were ac∣tually proposed by the former to the latter in the last century. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Jones's Introduc. Disc. p. 4. Note.</NOTE>That men should admit the mysterious truths of holy Writ upon rational grounds, or that they should reject them upon what they call rational grounds,
<PB N="257" REF="271"/>
we may readily enough comprehend; but there seems to be something unaccountably romantic in an attempt to compromise mat∣ters as it were with the author of our faith by accommodating these truths to the human understanding.</P>
<P>But whatever may be the views, or what∣ever the claims, or whatever the pretences of Latitudinarians in general, the notion of a <HI>Creed,</HI> or a system, or an establish∣ment respecting the great doctrines we have been considering, occurs to us in a manner spontaneously. In the Church of <HI>Christ,</HI> the only question ought to be, not whether a <HI>confession,</HI> a <HI>formulary,</HI> or a series of <HI>articles,</HI> be long or short, simple or cir∣cumstantial, antient or modern, but whether it has its grounds in competent authority. <HI>(mm)</HI> If the doctrines of the <HI>Trinity</HI> and of the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> as they are held in the Church, be scriptural doctrines, no more objection can justly lie against the <HI>Nicene,</HI> or the <HI>Atha∣nasian Creed,</HI> than against that of Dr. S. This author not only admits but refers to an <HI>original Creed,</HI> which he observes has been
<PB N="258" REF="272"/>
enlarged "as circumstances arose," or oc∣casions called; though that it has been en∣larged in some instances beyond all reason he strongly insists, with many <HI>others with</HI> him. But be this as it may, and even if <HI>these things</HI> were not <HI>so</HI> as we have represented them, it is abundantly sufficient that they appear to be <HI>so</HI> to us. No rule, no system, no esta∣blishment whatsoever can in any tolerable sense be said to invade the <HI>right of private judgment</HI> in matters of religion; because <HI>Creeds,</HI> formularies, institutions, and ap∣pointments in general must be incompatible with the exercise of this right, at all periods of the Christian Church, or at none. It is pleasant enough to remark how <HI>zealously</HI> some will be <HI>affected in a</HI> ridiculous <HI>thing;</HI> and how vehemently they will <HI>beat the air</HI> in their contention for that <HI>right</HI> of <HI>private judgment,</HI> which is indeed unalienable; and in fact is exercised by those who submit to what may be called <HI>public;</HI> by men of all persuasions; by <HI>Jews, Turks, Infidels,</HI> and <HI>Heretics;</HI> by the Sectaries of all religions; and by peo∣ple of no religion at all. <HI>(nn)</HI> <Q>Not Heretics only, says the great <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> but <HI>Ro∣mish</HI>
<PB N="259" REF="273"/>
Catholics also, set up as many judges, as there are men and women in the Chris∣tian world. For do not your men and wo∣men judge your religion to be true before they believe it, as well as the men and women of other religions? Oh! but you say, <HI>they receive it, not because they think it agreeable to Scripture, but because the Church tells them so.</HI> But then, I hope, they believe the Church, because their own reason tells them they are to do so. So that the difference between a Papist and a Pro∣testant is this, not that the one judges, and the other does not judge, but that the one judges his guide to be infallible, the other his way to be manifest.</Q> The fact is, every man's attachment to any thing, to this or that Church, to this party, or to that principle, &amp;c. is ultimately resolvible into his opinion of its excellence, its truth, its propriety, or its expedience; or of its conduciveness on the whole to his welfare, comfort, and satis∣faction, &amp;c; i. e. it is resolvible into his own private judgment. This judgment, it is true, may be warped by passion, biassed by prejudice, clouded by ignorance, and blinded
<PB N="260" REF="274"/>
by perverseness; it may be intoxicated by voluptuousness, enervated by indolence, or inverted by frenzy; or it may be influenced by wisdom, by folly, or by caprice. But, at the same time, whether we judge well, or ill; or of whatever differences or degrees human judgment may admit; we shall strictly and properly be found in all cases and in∣stances to judge for ourselves. (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>)</P>
<P>It was the concurrence of private judgment which first formed the Christian Church; it was the same concurrence which gradually compounded the enormous mass of popery; it was the same that effected the <HI>Reformation;</HI> and it was the same that constituted the nu∣merous sects and parties into which this <HI>Re∣formation</HI> has been most deplorably split and subdivided. It is to nothing more or less than this that the Church of <HI>England</HI> owes her existence. And upon this ground it is cer∣tain, her requisition of assent to her public offices, and of subscription to her <HI>articles,</HI> the measure of just policy, and common pru∣dence for her security, are no more to be re∣garded
<PB N="261" REF="275"/>
as invasions of the <HI>right of private judgment,</HI> than the open attempts, or the secret machinations of her enemies, for her destruction. Upon this ground, in short, her declarations of faith in what she holds to be evangelical truth; and indeed the whole scheme of her doctrine, discipline, and polity, are perfectly intelligible, and manifestly con∣sistent. But is not the inference drawn from the acknowleged <HI>right of private judgment</HI> by a late famous author, and his associates, al∣together chimerical, and totally incompre∣hensible? Their inference is, that every in∣dividual Christian may, if he thinks fit, with∣draw himself from all the Churches upon the face of the earth, stand absolutely single in the profession of his faith, or, as this au∣thor expresses it, be a <HI>Church to himself.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Confessional. Ch. 2. p. 34. Note.</NOTE>And is not this in effect to assert, that a Church may be formed without a communion, with∣out government, or ministry; without a pos∣sibility of being infected with heresy, or di∣vided by schism? Is it not to all intents and purposes to aver, that a society may subsist without members, without establishment, or
<PB N="262" REF="276"/>
constitution? We deny not that a man may judge he has a claim to this spiritual inde∣pendence; and indeed our principle supposes him so to judge; but then we must beg leave to think in our turn, that he is grossly mis∣taken in that judgment. <HI>(pp)</HI></P>
<P>I wish to remark, that if the capital truths of the Gospel are discoverable any where, they are most indisputably to be found in the Catholic Church; the great repository of Christian doctrine. Our blessed Lord's assu∣rances of superintendency, support, and pro∣tection are out of all question given to his disciples, and to believers in general, as to a body, or society. <HI>Upon this rock,</HI> says he, <HI>I will build my Church, &amp;c. Lo! I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.</HI> When he promised his Apostles that he would send the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> to them, who should <HI>guide them into all truth,</HI> he must ne∣cessarily mean that truth which they were to communicate to their successors, and these to others, and so on, through all generations. When the sacred penmen speak of the <HI>truth,</HI>
<PB N="263" REF="277"/>
or the <HI>faith,</HI> &amp;c. they undoubtedly speak of the truth embraced, and the faith professed by all sound Christians; and when St. <HI>Paul</HI> ex∣horts the <HI>Corinthians</HI> to <HI>examine</HI> themselves, and to <HI>prove</HI> themselves, <HI>whether</HI> they were in the <HI>faith,</HI> he most certainly means the faith of the catholic Church. In a word, we must look for spiritual truth in its native simplicity, though we <HI>search</HI> for it as for <HI>hid treasures;</HI> we must look for it within the pale of some communion or other: which surely will be acknowleged by every man, who does not, in defiance of Scripture, and in contempt of all the world, suppose that the infallibility which he justly denies to appertain to any Church upon earth, is really and truly lodg∣ed in himself.</P>
<P>The principle of the <HI>Confessional</HI> leads, we apprehend, to these absurd consequences; but at the same time we assert no <HI>dominion</HI> over the <HI>faith,</HI> or the consciences of others; we leave every one to <HI>stand or fall to his own master;</HI> we conceive, that, by the immutable constitution of things, every one will think
<PB N="264" REF="278"/>
and act for himself, though we imagine all men to be accountable to God as well for their opinions as for their practices; we nei∣ther do, nor wish to <HI>compel</HI> men to <HI>come in</HI> that our Church <HI>may be filled,</HI> persuaded as we are at the same time that this Church is, in respect of all essentials, an apostolical one; that she <HI>holds fast the things which become sound doctrine,</HI> and teaches the <HI>words of eternal life.</HI></P>
<P>It may with great truth be affirmed, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> asserts the <HI>right of private judgment</HI> in the same sense, and to the same latitude that every party or body of Pro∣testants does. For how does the management of the several leaders and teachers of the Sectaries accord with this universally avowed principle? How do <HI>they</HI> leave men to their own judgments in matters of religion? Do <HI>they</HI> not find ways and means to become mas∣ters of the understandings, and the consci∣ences of their followers; and accomplish that by indirect artifice which they load us with obloquy for doing under the sanction of law∣ful authority? The fact is, in case of supe∣riority,
<PB N="265" REF="279"/>
any sect that you may name would think itself, not barely empowered, but bound to strengthen and secure itself by legal fences and establishments, and by authorita∣tive constitutions; i. e. by those very means and methods against which it now so vehe∣mently exclaims. Experience will justify our supposition that such would be the case; as we know the most considerable branch of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> to have changed its language, and its sentiments, with its situation. The first article of the memorable <HI>solemn League and Covenant</HI> declares the intention of its fra∣mers to be, <HI>to</HI> <Q><HI>bring the Churches of God in the three kingdoms to the nearest conjunction and uniformity in religion,</HI> CONFESSION OF FAITH, FORM OF CHURCH-GOVERN∣MENT, and DIRECTORY FOR WORSHIP and CATECHISING; <HI>that they and their posterity after them might as brethren live in faith and love.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is pleasant enough to observe, that, notwithstanding the fine flourishes and co∣lourings of certain authors, who plausibly
<PB N="266" REF="280"/>
profess themselves to be advocates for the common rights and privileges of Christians, we find them sometimes driven out of their track by the irresistible force of truth, and insensibly advancing▪ or admitting eccle∣siastical notions: we find them after all their efforts and struggles to climb over the pale of the Church, unwarily, or rather unavoid∣ably slipping back, as I may say, into her fold, and undermining their own principles. The words of a late famous prelate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bp. Hoadley.</NOTE>upon this subject will verify the observation. <Q>As it is absurd, says he, to suppose that any man can be saved by the faith of another, or by any belief but what is truly his own; so there is no possible method of having a faith of his own, properly so called, with∣out building it entirely upon what appears right to his own judgment, such as it is, after his best endeavours for INFORMA∣TION.</Q> That is to say, in other words, a man cannot properly be said to judge for <HI>himself</HI> till he has received information, or instruction from <HI>others.</HI> In short, let privi∣leges be as sacred, or consciences as tender
<PB N="267" REF="281"/>
as you please, I affirm that the erection and establishment of a national Church, whether the doctrines she teaches are in themselves orthodox or otherwise, true or false, is as fairly defensible upon rational and protestant grounds, as the institution of any religious sect, or society whatsoever.</P>
<P>True it is that men, inflamed with false zeal, or misled by wrong judgment, may de∣part both from protestant and Christian prin∣ciples; and at their peril it will be. The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> endeavoured to extirpate what she <HI>called heresy</HI> by the very same means which in early days Paganism employed for the overthrow of the Christian faith itself. And what was the consequence? The inhu∣manity of persecution afforded to every think∣ing mind a very strong argument of the cor∣ruption of that Church in which it was countenanced; it frightened men <HI>into</HI> their <HI>Senses;</HI> it helped to open their understand∣ings; and Popery may upon the matter be said to have been burnt out of the kingdom. I undertake not to prove, that in our own
<PB N="268" REF="282"/>
Church zeal has always been sufficiently governed by prudence, or tempered with charity. There is no occasion to recur to a few disagreeable instances, or the transactions of untoward times. But, I trust, I shall be abun∣dantly warranted in asserting, that he who at this day shall charge the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or any considerable number of her members, with a want of due moderation, <HI>knows not of what manner of Spirit we are of.</HI> And yet, if the author of the <HI>Confessional</HI> is to be cre∣dited, we are relapsing gradually into Po∣pery, both in our doctrines and our prac∣tices. We are given to understand, in the seventh Chap. of that work, that <Q>Some competent observers have grounds for more than a suspicion, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> has been, and still is, though by degrees imperceptible to vulgar eyes, edg∣ing back once more towards Popery.</Q> Sure these <HI>observers</HI> are much more <HI>sharp-sighted</HI> than their neighbours! I do not well know what these Gentlemen are afraid of; but I know true Christianity to be most in danger from the diametrically opposite quarter; not
<PB N="269" REF="283"/>
so much from men of too great, as from people of too <HI>little faith;</HI> not so much from the triple-mitre of the <HI>Roman</HI> pontiff, as from the many-headed <HI>hydra</HI> of infidelity. The truth of the matter is, the author before us and his friends do not speak out, as our <HI>open enemies</HI> have done, and as themselves were called upon to do, by every maxim of justice, candor, and generosity. They are in no dread of <HI>fire</HI> and <HI>faggot;</HI> they are offend∣ed, not by the <HI>discipline,</HI> but by certain doc∣trines of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> which we hold in common with her, (even the <HI>doc∣trines</HI> I have been defending,) and which they most insidiously and industriously labour to confound with the absurdities which are justly had in derision, or in abhorrence among us, and of which the credit visibly diminishes every day. Errors may be grafted upon the stock of truth; which in itself is not the less pure, or the less amiable, because it may be <HI>holden</HI> in folly as well as in <HI>unrighteousness.</HI> To an ardent longing to see these common doctrines expunged from our <HI>Articles</HI> and <HI>Creeds,</HI> we are unquestionably to ascribe that
<PB N="270" REF="284"/>
profusion of spleen, malevolence, and ran∣cour with which so many pages, of the <HI>Con∣sessional,</HI> and of other treatises are shamefully defiled. But for these doctrines, I am tho∣roughly persuaded, the reasonableness, and utility, not to say necessity of Church-esta∣blishments, would generally be admitted, and even contended for. That nicety of human wisdom which strains at two or three of our <HI>Articles</HI> could, I am apt to think, well enough digest the remainder of the <HI>thirty nine.</HI> But as matters are circumstanced, the principle I have been combating is far from being an unpopular one. The privilege, or right of private judgment, in the sense of our adversaries, reduces in some sort all men to an equality, and is extremely soothing to vain and to weak minds. The fact is, there is no difficulty in declaiming from standing and specious topics either of eulogy, or in∣vective. An affected zeal for reformation, and an avowed anxiousness for the revival of gospel simplicity, have a verv ingratiating ten∣dency with the bulk of mankind. <HI>Liberty of conscience, Freedom of sentiment, (qq) eccle∣siastical</HI>
<PB N="271" REF="285"/>
<HI>tyranny, violence of bigotry, arbitrary injunctions, spiritual impositions,</HI> &amp;c. are, I grant, expressions sufficiently sonorous and amusing, and may pass with many for argu∣ment; though at the same time, <HI>looseness of principle, stubbornness of schism, rankness of heresy, arrogance of self-sufficiency, perverse∣ness of opposition, and petulance of temper,</HI> &amp;c. are phrases which must be allowed by "competent" judges to sound quite as well, and to mean full as much.</P>
<P>To conclude. That there is nothing in the least exceptionable in our whole eccle∣siastical system; nothing that might reason∣ably be retrenched; nothing that could pos∣sibly be amended even in our <HI>Articles,</HI> as well as worship, rites, and usages, we by no means affirm: but respectfully leaving <HI>these things</HI> to the consideration of them that <HI>are over us in the Lord,</HI> we utterly deny that there is any thing fundamentally wrong, or essentially erroneous in our spiritual constitu∣tion. <HI>(rr)</HI> Men may be, and we find them to be bigots in the cause of infidelity; nor
<PB N="272" REF="286"/>
can it afford the least matter of wonder, if no regard is paid to the complaints, or rather the <HI>railing accusations</HI> of such as under fair shews and pretences have manifestly <HI>evil will at Sion;</HI> and while they profess themselves to be actuated by the <HI>Spirit of liberty,</HI> appear to be really possessed with the <HI>Daemon of li∣centiousness.</HI> I profess I see not what we can do for, or with these determined enemies of our holy faith except praying, in the spirit of <HI>fervent charity,</HI> that God would be pleased "to bring them into the way of truth." <HI>The Spirit speaketh expressly,</HI> says St. <HI>Paul, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing Spirits, and doctrines of devils.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 1.</NOTE>This passage cannot pos∣sibly be considered as a dead letter; and therefore it infinitely concerns ALL persons "diligently to try and examine themselves," in order to their moral assurance that it does not in any sense or degree touch THEIR spiri∣tual state. In general however, under a con∣viction that we are ourselves in the <HI>good and the right way,</HI> it will be our duty, as Mem∣bers
<PB N="273" REF="287"/>
of the Church to wish, and as Christi∣ans to pray, that God would <Q>have mercy upon all Jews, Turks, Infidels, and Here∣tics; that he would take from them all ignorance, hardness of heart, and contempt of his word; and so fetch them home to his flock, that they may be saved among the remnant of the true Israelites, and be made one fold under one Shepherd, Jesus Christ our Lord.</Q></P>

The design of the latter is obvious enough. I do not recollect to whom I am indebted for these particulars. In like manner Dr. <HI>Wa∣terland</HI> acquaints us, that <HI>Franciscus,</HI> abbot of St. <HI>Clare,</HI> contrived to reconcile our <HI>thirty-nine articles</HI> to the doctrine of the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> <Q>by dint of great dexterity, and most amazing sub∣tilty,</Q> as the learned Doctor expresses it.</P>

Hereunto the author subjoins two other similar passages, the first from <HI>Smalcius,</HI> a famous <HI>Soci∣nian;</HI> and the latter from <HI>Socinus</HI> himself. The words of <HI>Socinus</HI> are these. <Q><HI>Usque ad tempora</HI> CON∣CILII NICAENI, <HI>et aliquanto post, ut omnium qui tum extitere scriptis liquet, ille unus verus Deus, quem passim sacra testimonia praedicant, solus Pater Jesu Christi est creditus; et qui contrarium sentiunt, ut</HI> SABELLIANI <HI>et eorum similes, pro haereticis plane sunt habiti.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Let us see then how Bp. <HI>Jewel</HI> manages this matter against his antagonist Mr. <HI>Hardinge,</HI> who, in his pretended confutation of the <HI>Apology for the Church of England,</HI> confidently asserts, that <Q>the Divini∣ty of the Holy Ghost cannot be proved by any express authority from Scripture.</Q> We find that illustrious prelate taking the wisest method of putting his adversary to silence and confusion, by producing testimonies and opinions, and not barely
<PB N="278" REF="291"/>
concessions, but strong asseverations of a directly contrary tendency, from the writers of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church itself.

You have them particularly enumerated by an author just now quoted; and it will be suf∣ficient to select one of them, as it is a flagrant one; I mean that of the Cardinal <HI>Perron,</HI> who, in the last century, in order to render the Scriptures suspected and contemptible, asserted, that <Q>some things in them sound like fables, others are apt to raise in the mind indecent and dishonest imagi∣nations, as some expressions in <HI>Solomon's song;</HI> the history of <HI>Balaam's Ass</HI> which spoke; and the <HI>jaw-bone</HI> of an <HI>Ass,</HI> with which <HI>Sampson</HI> slew a thousand <HI>Philistines.</HI></Q></P>

<P>Page 13. <HI>(c) Errors of integrity.]</HI> One of Mr. <HI>K.</HI>'s arguments, or rather one argument urged by him in the name of his Church, is the following. <Q>He∣retics would arise after the Apostles time, and after the writing of Scriptures: these cannot be discovered, condemned, and avoided, unless the Church be infallible; therefore there must be a Church infallible.</Q> To which Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> replies in these words. <Q>I pray tell me why can∣not heresies besufficiently discovered, condemned, and avoided by them which believe Scripture to be the rule of faith? If Scripture be sufficient to inform us what is the faith, it must of necessity be also sufficient to teach us what is heresy; seeing heresy is nothing but a manifest deviation from, and an opposition to the faith. That which is straight will plainly teach us what is crooked, and one contrary cannot but manifest the other. If any one should deny that there is a God, that this God is omnipotent, omniscient, good, &amp;c, &amp;c; that Jesus Christ is the Saviour of the world, and the Son of God; if any man should deny either his birth, his passion, or resur∣rection, &amp;c; or <HI>sitting at the right hand of God;</HI> his having <HI>all power given him,</HI> &amp;c; that it is he whom God hath appointed to be <HI>Judge of the quick and the dead;</HI> that all men shall rise again at
<PB N="280" REF="293"/>
the last day, &amp;c, &amp;c; if a man should hold, that either the keeping of the <HI>Mosaical</HI> law is necessary to Salvation, or that <HI>good works</HI> are not necessary; in a word, if any man should obstinately contradict the truth of any thing plainly delivered in Scripture, who does not see that every one which believes the Scripture hath sufficient means to discover, and condemn, and avoid that heresy, without any need of an infallible guide? If you say, that the <HI>obscure places of Scripture contain matters of faith,</HI> I an∣swer, that it is a matter of faith to believe that the sense of them, whatever it is, which was in∣tended by God, is true; for he that doth not so, calls God's truth into question. But to believe this or that to be the true sense of them, or to believe the true sense of them, and to avoid the false, is not necessary either to faith, or salvation.</Q></P>
<P>It may be asked, however, whether this gives us satisfaction to the full? Do not our <HI>Creeds</HI> and <HI>Articles</HI> contain particulars which we shall look for in vain in M. <HI>C.</HI>'s list of the objects of faith? Are not many whom we consider as heretics ready to subscribe to this list? Was Mr. <HI>C.</HI> inadvertently, or designedly silent with regard to these particulars? Or are we to consign them to the class of obscurity? Whatever might have been his motive to the word∣ing of his paragraph in this manner, or whatever was his personal persuasion in respect to the fun∣damental articles of the faith professed by the
<PB N="281" REF="294"/>
Church of <HI>England,</HI> the momentous import of the interrogatories I have just put must be visible to every reader.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>C.,</HI> or any body else tells us, that <Q>God does not require any more of any man than this, to believe the Scripture to be God's word, and to endeavour to find the true sense of it, and to live according to it;</Q> or, that <Q>he that believes the Scripture sincerely, and endeavours to believe it in the true sense, cannot possibly be an heretic,</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Relig. of Protest. p. 335; and end of Preface.</NOTE>he must be understood with qualifi∣cation; as asserting, not absolutely that an honest man cannot possibly <HI>err concerning the faith,</HI> but that error, or heresy will not be imputed to invo∣luntary ignorance, or to sincerity of persuasion.</P>
<P><Q>Heresy, says Bp. <HI>Taylor,</HI> is not an error of the understanding, but of the will;</Q> and elsewhere, <Q>it is not the opinion, but the impiety that con∣demns and makes the heretic.</Q> On this princi∣ple this sagacious and moderate writer condemns the <HI>Heresiarch</HI> whose error <Q>commences upon pride and ambition, &amp;c. and excuses those who follow him in simplicity of heart.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Agreably to all this, Dr.</HI> Potter, <HI>(author of the Answer to</HI> Charity Mistaken, <HI>whose cause</HI> Chilling∣worth <HI>espouses,) and after him Dr.</HI> Waterland <HI>quotes the following remarkable passage from</HI> Salvian, <HI>an antient Bishop of</HI> Marseilles, <HI>respecting the truly</HI>
<PB N="282" REF="295"/>
<HI>sincere of the</HI> Arian <HI>persuasion.</HI> They are heretics, but do not know that they are so. In short, they are heretics in our judgment, not so in their own; for they esteem themselves such good Catholics, that they even throw upon us the infamous charge of heresy. Such therefore as they are to us, we are to them. We know assuredly that they are injurious to the divine generation of the Son of God, in making him inferior to the Father. They, on the other hand, think us injurious to the Father, in believing them both equal. How they shall be punished at the day of judgment for this their error, &amp;c. no one can know except the Judge.</P>
<P>It may be proper to take Mr. <HI>K.</HI>'s argument, and Mr. <HI>C.</HI>'s answer into re-consideration. <Q>Heresies, says the former, would arise after the Apostles' time, and after the writing of Scriptures: these cannot be discovered, condemned, and avoided, unless the Church be infallible; therefore there must be a Church infallible.</Q> The substance of Mr. <HI>C.</HI>'s reply is, that <Q>without any need of an infallible guide,</Q> the great truths of the Gospel are discoverable, and consequently heresies avoid∣able, by all such as <Q>believe Scripture to be the rule of faith:</Q> and that with respect to those obscure places of Scripture," which Mr. <HI>K.</HI> tells us "contain matters of faith," we have nothing to do but <Q>believe that the sense of them, whatsoever it is, which was intended by God, is true,</Q> without being solicitous to avoid mistakes concerning them.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="296"/>
By this answer 'tis certain this celebrated dispu∣tant seems to lay his own faith rather open to sus∣picion. For does he not admit what he might, and in fact ought to have contested? Take them in the gross, the <Q>places of Scripture which contain matters of faith,</Q> are not by any means <HI>obscure,</HI> but altogether plain and intelligible. <HI>I speak con∣cerning</HI> the faith of <HI>the Church.</HI> What the sense of these places is, according to the established laws of interpretation, and according to the belief of the Christians of the first ages, is a question, to the determination of which we surely need not have recourse to infallibility. Though therefore, with respect to passages really ambiguous, or <HI>obscure,</HI> it will be a safe and excellent rule, <Q>to believe that the sense of them, whatsoever it is, which was intended by God, is true,</Q> yet it will be unfair, unreasonable, and unsafe to apply this rule to places which are no otherwise ambiguous, or <HI>obscure,</HI> than as they "contain matters of faith;" especially when we remember how frequently, and how ear∣nestly we are required to <HI>strive for the faith,</HI> to <HI>contend for the faith,</HI> and to <HI>examine</HI> and <HI>prove</HI> our <HI>own</HI> selves <HI>whether</HI> we <HI>be in the faith.</HI> Truth is not less truth because it is held in a Church that pre∣tends not to be infallible. God <HI>only knows the hearts of the children of men:</HI> but at the same time it will be no breach of charity to intimate, that <HI>every man</HI> should <HI>be fully persuaded in his own mind,</HI>
<PB N="284" REF="297"/>
that if he errs, his error is an error, not of his <HI>will,</HI> but of his <HI>understanding.</HI></P>

<P>Page 14. <HI>(d) of insanity.]</HI> I cannot bring myself to recall these words by the high respect which on many accounts is due to the names of certain persons, eminent for their ability, and some of them for their piety too, who have advanced notions not a whit less eccentric or extravagant than these. The late worthy Bishop of <HI>Cloyne,</HI> who denied, or at least doubted the existence of matter, is not without his numerous admirers. In fact, he seems to have confounded all, though he has con∣vinced none. But whatever purpose was intended to be served by such a doctrine, surely its real con∣sequences must be detrimental to the cause of Christianity. If all about us is mere mockery and illusion, the very foundations of all evidence, all faith, and all practice are undermined; nor will it be possible to determine which position most con∣tradicts my senses, or offers most violence to my conceptions, <HI>that</HI> which avers the non-existence of matter, or <HI>that</HI> which maintains the <HI>transubstantiation</HI> of it in the holy Sacrament. The followers of Mr. <HI>Hobbes</HI> will be apt to laugh this notion to scorn,
<PB N="285" REF="298"/>
under a persuasion that they deny, or doubt the ex∣istence of Spirit, and consequently of God, with a much better grace. It may be observed, with re∣gard to both extremes, that there is no such thing as demonstrating beyond a possibility of doubt, or contradiction. For, to use the words of an author of the last century, <Q>it is possible that <HI>mathematical evidence</HI> itself may be but a constant undiscovera∣ble delusion, which our nature is necessarily and perpetually obnoxious unto, and that either fatally or fortuitously there has been in the world time out of mind such a being as we call <HI>Man,</HI> whose essential property it is to be then most of all mistaken when he conceives a thing most evidently true.</Q> There is no shutting the door against scepticism. We meet with doubters and disputers of all ages and nations. <HI>Marcus Antoni∣nus</HI> makes mention of one <HI>Monimus,</HI> a <HI>Cynic</HI> philo∣sopher, who averred that all is fancy, and that there is absolutely no such thing as a <HI>criterion</HI> of truth. <HI>Pyrrho,</HI> though not the first sceptic, was famous enough to give an appellation to scepticism. But notwithstanding all this, a man of sense and of common prudence will listen to rational evidence, and yield assent to moral certainty. He will soon be convinced upon enquiry, that both body and spirit exist, and that mind is neither matter nor motion; that if chance, or nature, if you please, made the world, it is that which preserves it too;
<PB N="286" REF="299"/>
and may dissolve it; and, after its dissolution, may restore it to its original state, or reduce it to one infinitely worse than the present. This sure is at best but uncomfortable philosophy. Not that I would hereby insinuate immorality to be necessarily con∣nected with infidelity. <HI>Plato</HI> distinguished long ago between the "ranting" and sober atheist; and ob∣served, that a man whose sentiments are impious may be virtuous from constitution. Accordingly he very justly resolves atheism into not barely depravi∣ty of manners, but sometimes into an affectation of singular wisdom. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letters on Infidelity. p. 35.</NOTE>One source of atheism in his opinion is, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which is almost literally translated in the fol∣lowing words of the Apostle, <HI>professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Cudworth</HI> seems unwarily to give some ad∣vantage to the atheist, where he says, that <Q>when we affirm that God is incomprehensible, we only mean, that our imperfect minds cannot have such a conception of his nature as doth perfectly master, conquer, and subdue that vast object under it, &amp;c.</Q> The case is, we comprehend by our reason <HI>that</HI> God is, though not <HI>what</HI> he is, in respect of his essence in the abstract. But that he is self-existent from all eternity, that he is a <HI>Spirit,</HI> that he is the Creator and Governor of the Uni∣verse, that he is all perfect, are certain truths,
<PB N="287" REF="300"/>
notwithstanding the darkness which surrounds them. <HI>Sophocles</HI> may be imagined to have had these truths in his eye, when speaking of the divine edicts, and the immutable decrees of heaven, he puts this fine sentiment in the mouth of <HI>Antigone,</HI>

<P>And yet we have wits and philosophers of great name and recent date, who seem desirous of re∣viving the old atomical physiology, which, as Dr. <HI>Cudworth</HI> expresses it, <Q>makes all things to be materially and mechanically necessary without a God.</Q> These gentlemen are at least far from pronouncing matter incapable of the privilege of thought. One <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume's Dialogues, p. 60.</NOTE>in direct terms calls thought the <HI>agitation of the brain.</HI> Unhappily Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> so far subscribes to this principle, as to declare his opinion, that <Q>we have not sufficient knowledge to determine, by the light of reason, that God could not grant the gift of thought and sensation to a being which we call material.</Q> Mr. <HI>Voltaire</HI> eagerly catched at this notion of the <Q>sole reason∣able metaphysician,</Q> as he calls him.</P>

It has been asked, whether the Deity be naturally or morally good; or whether he is <Q>necessarily good and just in the same sense as he is eternal and omnis∣cient?</Q> All speculations on such points as these are covered by the general idea of absolute inhe∣rent perfection. Perhaps <HI>Seneca</HI> may be allowed to discharge this difficulty not unhappily, when, speak∣ing of the Deity, he says, <HI>Ipse est necessitas sua.</HI> The ingenious editor of <HI>Puffendorf</HI>'s treatise <HI>De officio hominis et civis</HI> speaks much the same lan∣guage in the following note: <HI>Deus intelligitur ad suarum perfectionum normam actiones componere. Ipse</HI>

<P>To avoid making God the author of evil, the doctrine of <HI>Zoroastres</HI> was, that <Q>God originally and directly created only light, or good; and that darkness, or evil, followed it by consequence, as the shadow doth the person; that light, or good, hath only a real production from God, and the other afterward resulted from it, as the defect thereof.</Q> An ingenious writer gives us the sentiments of <HI>Plato</HI> on this perplexing sub∣ject, in the following translation. <Q>God is good. He is not, as many say, the cause of every thing. The good things we enjoy are to be solely ascribed to him; but we are to search for another cause than God for our evils. Or, if we will say they come from God, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plato</HI> quotes here the famous passage in <HI>Homer,</HI> where mention is made of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s two Vessels, the one containing good, and the other evil, &amp;c.

We may say, God does always what is just and good, and the persons punished receive benefit by it; but the poet must not say the sufferers are miserable, and God inflicts that
<PB N="291" REF="304"/>
misery on them; if indeed he say, the wicked, as miserable, stand in need of punishment, and when punished by God, receive benefit from it, this may be permitted; but we are strenuously to oppose any man, who says God is the author of evil to a good man. Such language is at no rate to be tolerated in a state.</Q> The judicious reader will see how little a way this theory goes to∣wards clearing the difficulty; but he will, I pre∣sume, acknowlege it goes far enough to convince us, that <HI>Plato</HI> had, <Q>to speak modestly, as precise ideas of the Divine nature as any modern philo∣sopher,</Q> according to the translator's expression. But in his <HI>Timaeus,</HI> this famous philosopher imputes the origin of evil to the <Q>necessity of imperfect beings,</Q> as Dr. <HI>Cudworth</HI> expresses it. <Q>Where∣fore, says he, though, according to <HI>Plato,</HI> God be properly and directly the cause of nothing else but good, yet the <HI>necessity of these lower imperfect things</HI> does unavoidably give birth and being to evils.</Q> This is conformable enough to modern notions. <HI>Aristotle</HI> seems to have thought the Deity to have been the cause or principle of all things without exception; tho' in the following sentence he ex∣presses himself in terms general, modest, and un∣peremptory;—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>It is further observable, that not only many hea∣thens, and among others, <HI>Platonists,</HI> but, what is more extraordinary, Christians also have asserted
<PB N="292" REF="305"/>
the self-existence and eternity of matter, in order to account for the origin of evil, and effectually salve the honour of the Deity.

<P><Q>The author of <HI>Deism Revealed</HI> remarks, "that there are two opposite and supreme principles, according to the belief of almost all the Pagans now in the world.</Q> We are further given to un∣derstand by other authors, that God's <HI>absolute de∣crees and predetermination of good and evil</HI> is the doctrine of the <HI>Koran</HI> in general; though the <HI>Mahometans</HI> are divided in their opinions upon this article. The sect of the <HI>Hashemians</HI> were, it seems, so afraid of making God the author of evil, that they would not allow him to have created an infidel; which was adopting something like the old <HI>Magian</HI> theory, according to which there are two prin∣ciples, or a good and evil God, who are in a state of perpetual enmity and opposition. On the other hand, the <HI>Mozdarians</HI> thought it possible for God to be a liar, unjust, &amp;c. as the <HI>Basharians</HI> taught, that <Q>God is not obliged to do what is best; and that, had it pleased him, he might have made all

men true believers.</Q> The <HI>English</HI> translation of a <HI>Latin</HI> version of an <HI>Arabic</HI> manuscript, which contains a short system of <HI>Mahometan</HI> theology, gives us a distinction upon the subject of the divine decrees, as whimsical as it is unsatis∣factory. In the sixth section we have the fol∣lowing passage.—<Q>God hath so decreed good, obedience, and faith, that he ordains and wills them; and that they may be under his decree, his salutary direction, his good pleasure and com∣mand: on the contrary, God has decreed, does ordain, will and determine evil, disobedience, and infidelity; yet without his salutary direction, his good pleasure, or command; it being only by way of seduction, indignation, and prohibi∣tion. But whosoever shall say, that God is not delighted with good, and faith, or that God hath not an indignation against evil and infidelity; or that good and evil are from God, so that God hath decreed and willed both, with complacency in them, he is certainly an infidel.</Q> Then fol∣lows in another character;—<HI>Direct us, O great God, into the right way!</HI>—A petition expressive of the author's perplexity.</P>
<P><HI>The general way both among Jews and Chris∣tians of accounting for the origin of evil, is to derive it from the abuse of human liberty. Let us turn to the sentiments of the learned</HI> Grotius <HI>upon this subject.</HI> <Q>Cum diximus Deum omnium esse
<PB N="294" REF="307"/>

For may it not be asked, who created men and angels, and endowed them with this liberty? Or could</HI> either <HI>have abused a privilege they never enjoyed? Is there nothing of apparent causality in all this? Indeed the learn∣ed author seems to me to be sensible of his distressed situation. He observes very justly, in the words immediately following those just cited, that it would be impious to call God the author of evil.</HI> <Q>Hujus quidem generis malis, quae moraliter mala dicuntur, omnino Deum adscribere auctorem nefas est.</Q> <HI>But what does he say in the leading sentence of this very section?</HI> <Q>Neque ab eo quod diximus, dimove∣re nos debet, quod mala multa evenire cernimus, quorum videtur origo Deo adscribi non posse; ut qui perfectissime, sicut ante dictum est, bonus sit.</Q> <HI>Surely that same</HI> videtur <HI>betrays entanglement.

<P>The very learned and equally pious Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI> expresses himself on this subject in the following words. <Q>As for those real imperfections and evils, (moral evils, habitual distempers, irregular ac∣tions, &amp;c.) we need not seek any one eternal cause for them; (though order and uniformity do, disorder and confusion do not argue any unity of cause whence they should proceed:) the true causes of them are notorious enough: the voluntary declining of men, &amp;c, from the way God doth prescribe them; their abusing their own faculties, &amp;c. &amp;c. As for other evils of griefs and pains incident to the nature, or conse∣quent upon the actions of any being, they are such as God himself, (without any derogation to his goodness,) may in his wisdom, or justice be author of, for ends sometimes apparent to our understanding, sometimes surpassing its reach. It may suffice, that God challengeth to himself the
<PB N="296" REF="309"/>
being the cause of them. <HI>Shall there be any evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it? Doth not evil and good proceed out of the mouth of the Most High? I am the Lord, and there is none else; I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil.</HI></Q> (See Amos. 3. v. 6. Lamen. 3. v. 38. Isa. 45. v. 7.) We derive rather distress than content from all this; nor (to go a step far∣ther) shall we receive more satisfaction from St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> in the following quaint solution,—<HI>mali nulla natura est, sed amissio boni mali nomen accepit;</HI> or from <HI>Wollebius,</HI> (Divin.

<P><HI>Page</HI> 30. <HI>(g) eternal essence itself.]</HI> We cannot possibly be too cautious, too reserved, too general in our doctrines from the pulpit, or the press, respecting the Holy Trinity, or the particular Di∣vinity of our Saviour. Infidelity is always on the watch, and will take advantage in a moment of the least ambiguous, or inaccurate, or obscure expression, which may fall from our lips, or our pens. Some of the Fathers themselves, and indeed of our own most able writers, sometimes speak unguardedly, and inconsistently on these subjects. For the sake of perspicuity and distinction, as it should seem, it has been said, the <HI>Father</HI> is <HI>self-existent,</HI> and the
<PB N="298" REF="311"/>
<HI>Son,</HI> or <HI>Holy Ghost, necessarily existent;</HI> which is in fact a distinction without a difference. The <HI>Three</HI> Persons, as constituting <HI>One God,</HI> are equally <HI>self∣existent.</HI> The <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> are the Deity; and every idea of originality, deri∣vation, &amp;c. evaporates in the consideration of a Trinity in Unity. <Q>Though it has pleased God to represent the relation which the Second Person in the Trinity bears to the First, under the ana∣logy of that of a Son to a Father, yet we must not think that this analogy holds in every respect, or that every circumstance of human paternity and filiation is applicable to the Di∣vine.</Q> These are the words of a late worthy and learned writer, who expresses himself still more happily in the following passage. <Q>It is impossible for God himself to reveal these things to such kind of beings as we are, any other way than by accommodating himself to our conceptions, and using such terms as bear some analogy to things known and understood by us.</Q> <Q>The Father, (says another able advocate for the doctrine of the Trinity,) is first in our conception of God; and therefore when we speak of the Almighty, or the eternal God, and the reason is the same for the only God, we primarily and principally mean the Father, tacitly including the other two Persons.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is well observed by Mr. Parkhurst, that the first, second, and third persons in the Trinity are merely <HI>theological,</HI> not <HI>scriptural</HI> terms. Divin. &amp;c. of Christ. p. 35.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="312"/>
But is the language of the author last quoted of a piece with this sentence, when he talks of self∣existence, or <HI>unoriginateness,</HI> as the peculiar mode of the existence of the <HI>First</HI> Person? Or is the writer first quoted perfectly consistent with himself, when he concurs in sentiment with those whom he calls "the most zealous defenders of the <HI>Nicene</HI> faith;" and agrees with <HI>all</HI> the antient writes, who, he tells us, <Q>hold the Son to be in some sense inferior to the Father, and that even with regard to his divine nature?</Q> <Q>The Father, says he, is the first Person, the Son, the second. The Father they <HI>all</HI> represent as unbegotten, receiving his being and attributes from none but himself; the Son they teach to be God of God; begotten of the Father, and receiving his nature, &amp;c, from the Father, but yet coeternal and coequal with the Father, receiving from him from all eternity the same intire and individed essence.</Q> Is not this language inaccurate, incongruous, and self-con∣tradictory?" Many passages both in antient and modern writers are exceptionable on the same grounds. To select a few. The learned Bp. <HI>Bull</HI> gives, in his own words, the following sentiment of <HI>Petavius. Nam, ut recte Petavius, non potest Filius a Patre gigni, nisi ab eo naturam ac deitatem accipit,</HI> &amp;c. St. <HI>Hillary,</HI> as quoted by the same author, says in <HI>libro de Synodis, Patri subjectus est Filius, ut auctori. Russinus</HI> in his treatise on the
<PB N="300" REF="313"/>
Creed, calls the Father the head of the Son. <HI>Cum ipse Filius sit omnium caput, ipsius tamen caput est Pater.</HI> And <HI>Damascenus</HI> in his tract de <HI>fide orthodoxa</HI> has the following words; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. And St. <HI>Austin, argute pro more suo,</HI> according to Bp. <HI>Bull's</HI> remark, observes, in a discourse on a passage in St. <HI>Matthew</HI>'s gospel, (if I mistake not,) as follows: <HI>Insinuatur nobis in Patre auctoritas, in Filio nativitas, in Spiritu Sancto communitas, in tribus aequalitas.</HI> It is Bp. <HI>Bull</HI>'s own remark, <HI>unicum esse in Trinitate principium, principii expers, nempe Patrem, dogma fuisse in primaeva ecclesia tam fixum,—ut in quadrigesi∣mo nono Canonum, qui dicuntur Apostolorum, damnetur quisquis baptizaverit in tres principii expertes;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Under the same article the learned Prelate observes, that the antient Fathers, and those of the <HI>Nicene</HI> Council, and <HI>Athanasius</HI> himself never scrupled to give the appellation or title of the one only God to the Father. Let the reader take his own words. <HI>Denique veteres Deum Patrem, eo quod prin∣cipium, causa, auctor, et fons Filii sit, unum illum et solum Deum appellare non sunt veriti. Sic enim ipsi Patres Nicaeni exordiuntur suum symbolum;</HI> q. v. <HI>Et magnus Athanasius, quo nemo melius intellexit Synodi Nicaenae mentem, &amp;c, concedit Patrem jure dici</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>quod solus ingeni∣tus sit, &amp;c. Propter Patrem vivit Filius,</HI> says St. <HI>Ambrose,</HI> as quoted by Bishop <HI>Pearson, quod ex Patre Filius est; propter Patrem, quod</HI> ERUCTATUM
<PB N="301" REF="314"/>
<HI>est verbum ex Patris corde, quod a Patre processit, quod ex paterno generatus est</HI> UTERO, &amp;c. Dr. <HI>Fiddes</HI> gives us a passage from St. <HI>Hilary,</HI> in which that Father asserts, that <Q>our making the Son God is no objection against the Father's being the one God. He is the one God, says he, because the only underived God.</Q> Surely Bp. <HI>Pearson</HI> him∣self, who in the main is wonderfully exact, does not speak in the most proper terms, when he tells us, that <Q>the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is originally God, as not receiving his eternal being from any other; that therefore it necessa∣rily followeth, that Jesus Christ, who is certain∣ly not the Father, cannot be a Person subsisting in the Divine Nature originally of himself; and consequently, it having been already proved, that he is truly and properly the eternal God, that he must be understood to have the Godhead communicated to him by the Father, who is not only eternally but originally God; that in him (Christ) is the same fulness of the Godhead, more than which the Father cannot have, but yet that in that perfect and absolute equality there is notwithstanding this disparity, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q> To adduce only one example more; even the judi∣cious <HI>Hooker</HI> is off his guard in the following pas∣sage. <Q>Seeing therefore the Father alone is origi∣nally that Deity which Christ originally is not, (for Christ is God by being of God, light
<PB N="302" REF="315"/>
by issuing out of light,) it followeth hereupon, that whatsoever Christ hath common unto him with his heavenly Father, the same of necessity must be given him, but naturally and eternally given him, not bestowed by way of benevolence &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>The priority implied in the term Father, in its common acceptation, accounts for all this incoherency; but where, I would gladly know, do the terms <HI>auctor, fons, origo, principium,</HI> &amp;c. occur in the Scriptures, or in the writings of the apostolical Fathers, <HI>Clemens, Polycarp,</HI> and <HI>Ig∣natius?</HI> Or where are any terms to be found importing subordination and inferiority, except such as evidently refer to the humanity of <HI>Jesus Christ?</HI> And after all, and all this put together notwithstanding, the common resemblances by which the great mystery has been faintly illustrated by the Fathers, especially by <HI>Justin Martyr, Ter∣tullian,</HI> and <HI>Origen,</HI> as light from the sun, or a stream from a fountain, are produced to no pur∣pose as proofs of a subordination, &amp;c. For let light be supposed to have issued from the sun, or a stream from a fountain, from all eternity; on this supposition it is plain, causality and originality are merely nominal; the fountain necessarily im∣plies the stream, and the sun, light: and in like manner, in the case before us, the existence of the Father necessarily supposes the existence of the Son,
<PB N="303" REF="316"/>
and of the Holy Ghost. The Father can no more exist without the Son than the Son without the Father.</P>
<P>The truth is, the Fathers of the Church, whose sentiments Bp. <HI>Bull</HI> lays before us, apparently grant much, but really yield nothing. If <HI>Athanasius,</HI> e. g., asserting the eternity and Divinity of the Son of God, meant not such an absolute co-equality as en∣tirely excludes all dependence and inferiority, he flatly contradicts the Creed which goes under his name, in which it is expressly said, that in the Trinity, <Q>none is afore or after other, none is greater or less than another;</Q> and if he did mean this, we cannot argue against his faith from the carelessness, or the impropriety, or even the absurdity of his expressions. Elucidation has before now been the parent of entanglement. The <HI>Arians</HI> themselves are sensible they cannot admit the eter∣nity of the Son of God, without acknowleging at the same time his absolute co-equality; and therefore affect to understand every passage or phrase seemingly derogating from the dignity of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as a direct assertion, or tacit concession that he is a creature. Through a most strange in∣advertence, the writers we have been extracting from appear to have confounded the idea of tempo∣ral with that of eternal generation.</P>
<P>It has been frequently and well observed, that most of the Fathers, before the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI>
<PB N="304" REF="317"/>
speak sometimes of a temporal generation of the Son by the operation of the Holy Ghost on the blessed Virgin; and sometimes, by a sort of <HI>cata∣chresis,</HI> give the name of generation to the mission of the Son from the Father, for the purpose of creating the world; and that, by directing our whole attention to the passages relative to both these, the enemies of our faith have artfully attempted to prevent our notice, or acknowlegment of other numberless places in the writings of these Fathers, wherein they plainly and unequivocally assert the eternal generation of the Son of God.</P>
<P>By help of these considerations, and such as these, we shall, for the most part, be enabled to reconcile exceptionable passages in the writings of the Fa∣thers in general with the purest faith, and strictest orthodoxy; and shall have no cause for resentment, or complaint, if in so large a bulk of human com∣position, and amidst such a multiplicity of subjects and circumstances, we are sometimes surprized by inaccurate diction, or unsound sentiment.</P>
<P>The supposed canon referred to by Bp. <HI>Bull,</HI> which forbad the baptizing <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, on pain of damnation, really maintains only the doctrine of the <HI>Athana. Cr. viz.</HI> that <Q>there is one Father, not three Fathers.</Q> <HI>Tertullian</HI> says somewhere, that there was a time <HI>quando Filius Dei non erat;</HI> which is true in the second or third sense of Sonship; as there was a time when God was not a
<PB N="305" REF="318"/>
Creator; <HI>viz. ante mundum conditum.</HI> Nay, there is an expression in <HI>Lactantius</HI> which more than insi∣nuates that there was a time, when even God the Father, or God absolutely considered, was not; for, says he, <HI>Deus ipse se fecit.</HI> And, by the way, they who talk of God the Father's <Q>RECEIVING <HI>his Being from himself alone,</HI></Q> do but paraphrase the words of <HI>Lactantius.</HI> I cannot think the Ca∣tholic faith can be in the least affected by these <HI>early opinions</HI> concerning <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Metaphysical subtleties, technical terms, and un∣scriptural definitions and distinctions have undoubt∣edly done no small disservice to the cause of Christi∣anity. But, as Dr. <HI>Waterland</HI> repeatedly observes, let the blame be laid at the right door. These things were artfully and gradually introduced into the Church by heretics, for the purpose of confounding and perplexing matters. The antient Christians rested solely on the authority of Scrip∣ture, and the concurrent voice of tradition. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Barrow on the Pope's Supremacy. p. 626.</NOTE>The Church believed in the Trinity, believed in the Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost, and worshipped all Three as One God, before the distinction was expressed by the term <HI>Persons,</HI> or the word <HI>substance</HI> was made use of. "It does not ap∣pear," says Dr. <HI>W.</HI> <Q>that the word <HI>Trinity</HI> was yet applied to this case;</Q> <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>Justin Martyr</HI>'s time, in the middle of the second century. The orthodox were necessitated to contend against their
<PB N="306" REF="319"/>
adversaries with their own weapons. And, what is worse, terms of art have been the fuel of strife amongst the orthodox themselves. It was a mere dispute of words which had like to have occasioned an irreparable breach between the Eastern and Western Churches. Take the following account of it in the words of Dr. <HI>Potter.</HI> "The Orientals," says he, <Q>professing to believe three <HI>Hypostases</HI> in the glorious Trinity would not admit three Per∣sons, and were therefore thought to be <HI>Arians.</HI> On the contrary, the Western believing three <HI>Per∣sons,</HI> could not be induced to confess three <HI>Hypos∣tases,</HI> and thereupon were taken to be <HI>Sabellians.</HI> Here was a great jealousy grounded upon a great error; which <HI>Athanasius</HI> easily discovered, and restored again their good amity and intelligence; shewing that they differed not in judgment, all meaning the same thing; and that <HI>Hypostasis</HI> on one side was the very same in effect with <HI>Person</HI> on the other.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Answer to Char.

<P>A writer of the last century, whose name does not appear, speaking of the controversies with which the Church of <HI>England</HI> was agitated in the year 1641, expresses himself in the following manner. <Q>They be not of the highest nature; for they are not touching the high mysteries of faith; such as detained the Churches after their first peace for many years, what time the here∣tics moved curious questions, and made strange
<PB N="307" REF="320"/>
anatomies of the nature and Person of Christ; and the catholic fathers were compelled to fol∣low them with all subtlety of disputations and determinations, to exclude them from their eva∣sions, and to take them in their own labyrinths: so as it is rightly said, <HI>illis temporibus ingeniosa res fuit esse Christianum.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Farther; it is certain the great doctrine of the Trinity hath been sometimes dishonoured, if not weakened, by puerile illustrations, and playfulness of distinction. According to <HI>T. Aquinas, Trinitas est quasi trium unitas.</HI> It is somewhere observed likewise by this famous Doctor, that the Father is the <HI>beginning,</HI> but not the <HI>cause</HI> of the Son. And says a learned systematical writer, I think, with a levity one should not expect in him, <HI>aliud est Trinus, aliud est Triplex.

We are informed by St. <HI>John,</HI> that the <HI>Jews sought the more to kill</HI> our Savi∣our, <HI>not only because he had broken the Sabbath, but said also that God was his Father,</HI> thereby <HI>making himself equal with God.</HI> It is worth observing, that this translation by no means does justice to the ori∣ginal; or any thing like so forcibly imports the equality in question: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; <HI>he called God his</HI> OWN <HI>Father,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> and Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> render it, <HI>his</HI> PROPER <HI>Father, his Father</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (as <HI>Nonnus</HI> explains the words <HI>in the begin∣ning,</HI> John i. 1.) <HI>his Father</HI> in a peculiar sense, in

a sense necessarily implying the same nature in both. The omission here is the more remarkable, as our translators attended to the same emphatical word in the only place besides where it occurs, and where its significance is not so obvious: <HI>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</HI> (Rom. viii. 32.) The <HI>Socinian</HI> evasion of the pas∣sage in St. <HI>John</HI> is inexpressibly ridiculous, and re∣duces it almost to nonsense. <HI>He made himself equal with God,</HI> by asserting, that he did the works of his Father!</P>

Dr. <HI>Gill</HI> without the least hesitation understands by the <HI>seven spirits</HI> the third Person in the blessed Trinity. He has adopted the above idea, and en∣larged upon it. "By these <HI>seven Spirits,"</HI> says this very sensible writer, <Q>are intended the Holy Spirit of God, who is one in his Person, but his gifts and graces are various; and therefore he is sig∣nified by this number because of the fulness and perfection of them; and with respect to the <HI>seven Churches,</HI> over whom he presided, whom he in∣fluenced and sanctified, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Ethiopic <HI>version, this author observes, reads</HI> from the seven Spirits which are before the throne of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>It is farther a remark of the same author, that the second Person is last mentioned in the benedic∣tion before us, <Q>because many things were to be said of him; he is described in all his offices, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Bp. <HI>Newton</HI> says, in effect, the very same thing. According to him, Jesus Christ is mentioned last <Q>because the subsequent discourse more immedi∣ately relates to him.</Q></P>

easily conceive how the production of angels should be so much inferior to our Saviour's temporal generation, supposing he had no other.</Q></P>
<P>It will corroborate what has already been ad∣vanced, to remark farther, that if Jesus Christ be any thing less than very God by eternal genera∣tion, he was abundantly over paid for all he did and suffered for our sakes; he was recompensed be∣yond all measure by his exaltation to the <HI>right hand of the majesty on high,</HI> and by the divine honour and worship which has been universally ascribed and paid to him. Under this view of the matter, the assumption of humanity deserves not the name of a condescension. In his human capa∣city indeed, Jesus Christ <HI>for the joy that was set before him endured the Cross, and despised the shame;</HI> but in his divine, he could have no <HI>respect to the recompense of a reward.</HI> This is a thought which has been started and pursued by several writers. <HI>Equidem rem attentius perpendenti,</HI> says Bp. <HI>Bull, liquebit, ex hypothesi sive Sociniana sive Ariana, Deum in hoc negotio amorem, &amp;c, suum potius in illum ipsum Filium quam erga nos homines ostendisse.</HI></P>

defend the first reading. But both come to the same point. <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> was <HI>made</HI> and <HI>not made, born</HI> and <HI>unborn,</HI> except in a mysterious and tran∣scendent sense; he was the eternal Son of God.

<P>There is another paragraph in this Epistle to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> wherein omniscience, an essential property of the Godhead, appears to be attributed in the fullest terms to Jesus Christ,—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is signified by the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, wherever it occurs in the Epistles of this Father, I believe, without ex∣ception; and the context evidently patronises this application.

<P><HI>I had the satisfaction to find my sentiments ex∣actly coinciding with those of Bp.</HI> Bull <HI>upon this very paragraph. His words are these,</HI> De Christo loqui Ignatium, indubium est, non modo ex voce <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,

except, with the same view, against the eccentricity of some of this Father's tenets, or those of any others in any other respects; as, e. g. that hell∣torments will not be eternal, for which assertion he had certainly <HI>no Scriptural warrant;</HI> or that the <HI>angel</HI> with whom <HI>Jacob wrested</HI> was an <HI>evil</HI> one, which was likewise a notion of <HI>Origen</HI>'s; or that souls after their separation from bodies retain many corporeal properties, as <HI>Irenaeus</HI> and <HI>Tertul∣lian</HI> imagin'd, &amp;c, &amp;c. In truth, orthodoxy may be said to be built <HI>upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone,</HI> and has no concern with these parti∣cularities; and much less with the conceits which the luxuriance of piety itself has sometimes given birth to.

Whether St. <HI>Barnabas,</HI> who was St. <HI>Paul's</HI> com∣panion and fellow-labourer, was the author of the catholic Epistle to which his name is prefixed, is a question undecided at this day. Much has been urged on this subject <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> by learned men; nor am I concerned to inquire, on which side the arguments preponderate. It will suffice to say, that many have thought the allegorical interpre∣tation of Scripture with which the performance abounds, by far too imaginary, or indeed too tri∣fling for the pen of one of the <HI>Minor</HI> Apostles, as <HI>Vossius</HI> calls him. This able critic is however a strong advocate for him, and the primitive fathers in general; and gives it as his clear opinion, that nothing of this kind in him, or in St. <HI>Clement,</HI> (from whom he extracts the particulars above no∣ticed,) ought in reason to be alledged to the dis∣credit of their writings. His words are these. <HI>Quis a primis illis Christianis omnigenam scientiam, et doc∣trinam expostulet?

<P>I would take this opportunity to observe, that the doctrine of types and symbols, as it has been revived by many moderns, so has it by some been upheld with a zeal which, in going beyond the bounds of judgment, has, it may be, done disser∣vice to Christianity. Let me ask the most sanguin advocates for symbols and prefigurations, how they relish this mode of speculation in the <HI>Romanists,</HI> when, among the arguments which they adduce in pretended proof of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s primacy, they tell us his SHIP, out of which the Lord taught the peo∣ple, was an emblem or type of the Christian Church? In short, the doctrine of types in gene∣ral is, in my opinion, too often at best more inge∣nious than solid, and has a stronger foundation in fancy than in fact. Perhaps the reader may be en∣tertained as well as convinced by two or three se∣lect instances.

nature: first, as this was of one stuff with∣out mixture, so that without sin, &amp;c. secondly, as this was put on after an extraordinary manner, so Christ put on humanity by an extraordinary conception; thirdly, as was the edge about the hole to keep it from rending, such was the unseparable union of Christ's two natures; fourthly as were the bells and pomegranates, such were his life and doctrine.</Q> Another learn∣ed writer, Mr. <HI>Mede,</HI> speaking of the <HI>manna</HI> and the <HI>rock</HI> in the <HI>wilderness,</HI> which are mentioned by St. <HI>Paul</HI> as types of Christ, 1 Cor. 10. v. 3, 4. expatiates in the following words. <Q>As <HI>Manna</HI> came from heaven beside the ordinary course of nature, so Christ's birth was wonderful, &amp;c. As <HI>Manna</HI> was of a most sweet taste, so is Christ unto the soul, &amp;c. As <HI>Manna</HI> was of a white co∣lour, so our Saviour was white and pure. As <HI>Manna</HI> before it was eaten was brayed in a mor∣tar, &amp;c. so was Christ our heavenly manna bro∣ken upon the Cross, &amp;c. As the <HI>rock</HI> gave no water before it was smitten with the <HI>rod</HI> of <HI>Mo∣ses,</HI> so was Christ smitten upon the Cross, that out of him might flow that sovereign stream, which he who <HI>drinketh</HI> shall <HI>never thirst.</HI> As the <HI>rock</HI> was smitten with the <HI>rod</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> so was Christ our redeemer with the rod of the Law, &amp;c.

<P>It may be proper to take notice in this place, that the equality we are contending for is not in

the lest disturbed by the disagreement betwixt the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Church, with respect to the <HI>pro∣cession</HI> of the Holy Ghost. The doctrine of the former was, that the <HI>Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father by the Son, and is the Spirit of the Son;</HI> non ex Filio, sed spiritum Filii <HI>esse dicimus, et Patris per Filium.</HI> This doctrine is erroneous indeed, but in∣nocently so. For, as Archbp. <HI>Laud,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Laud against Fisher. p. 24.</NOTE>and many others have observed, the question, whether the Holy Ghost proceeds <HI>a Filio,</HI> or <HI>per Filium,</HI> is but a question <HI>in modo loquendi;</HI> a mere difference in words, and affects not the faith. And therefore I cannot think Bp. <HI>Taylor</HI> argues candidly, or logi∣cally, in the following passage. <Q>The procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son, which is an ar∣ticle the <HI>Greek</HI> Church disavows, derives from the Tradition Apostolical, as it is pretended; and yet before St. <HI>Austin</HI> we hear nothing of it very clearly or certainly, forasmuch as that whole mys∣tery concerning the blessed Spirit was so little explicated in Scripture, and so little derived to them by tradition, that till the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> you shall hardly find any form of worship, or personal address of devotion to the Holy Spirit, as <HI>Erasmus</HI> observes, and I think the contrary will very hardly be verified.</Q> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bp. TAYLOR on Lib. of Pro. Sect. 5. p. 90.</NOTE>The Holy Ghost

is expressly styled by St. <HI>Peter</HI> the <HI>Spirit of Christ</HI> which, in the next sentence, is said to have been <HI>sent down from heaven;</HI> 1 Pet. 1. v. 10, 12. and I take it to be fully as presumeable that the article of the <HI>procession</HI> in question was grounded in the construction which this passage naturally admits, as that it "derived from tradition Apostoli∣cal;" notwithstanding the immaterial disagree∣ment above-mentioned. But whether this differ∣ence with respect to the mode of <HI>procession</HI> took its rise from different construction, or from dif∣erent tradition, the faith both of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Church in the third Person of the Trinity was still built on a sure foundation. Eternity of generation, and procession, and existence, is equally inexplicable; and though nothing was, or, in the nature of things, could be <Q>explicated in Scripture</Q> in respect of the whole mystery, yet, I apprehend, enough was <HI>revealed.</HI> Even if the first Christians had not addressed the blessed Spirit in any form of devotion at all, this could not have been owing to their want of comprehension of the mode of <HI>procession,</HI> but to their disbelief of his per∣sonality, and eternal existence. But that the pri∣mitive Christians, and the <HI>ante-nicene</HI> fathers be∣lieved the personality and eternal existence of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and consequently his coequality with the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> sufficiently, I trust, appears from the testimonies produced; and therefore ad∣mitting
<PB N="326" REF="339"/>
that most of the prayers of the Church were addressed to the <HI>Father,</HI> and few only to the <HI>Son,</HI> and fewer to the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> (which is far from being a matter unaccountable,) we have ample proofs that Christians worshipped <Q>one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity.</Q> <HI>Erasmus</HI> does not venture to assert, that no addresses were made to the Holy Ghost; and, if he had, we might con∣front him with the above cited declaration of <HI>Justin Martyr;</HI> which at least supposes this Divine Person to have been included, and frequently named in the supplications of the first Christians. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But we are by no means destitute of antient tes∣timonies to the same effect. The accounts of the martyrdom of <HI>Ignatius</HI> and <HI>Polycarp</HI> conclude with ascriptions of glory, &amp;c. to the <HI>Father,</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See WAKE<HI>'s</HI> Relation of these Martyrdoms. p. 137, 152.</NOTE>The relation of the suf∣ferings of the former closes with these words; <Q>who trod under foot the Devil, and perfected the course he had piously desired, in Christ Jesus our Lord; by whom, and with whom, all glory and power be to the Father, with the blessed Spirit, for ever and ever.</Q> The Epistle of the Church of <HI>Smyrna</HI> to the Church of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> concern∣ing the Martyrdom of <HI>Polycarp,</HI> concludes as fol∣lows: <Q>We wish you, brethren, all happiness by

living according to the rule of the Gospel of Jesus Christ; with whom glory be to God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, &amp;c.</Q> In <HI>Clemens</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI> there is a prayer and doxology to the Trinity in these words: <Q>Be merciful unto thy children, O Master, O Father, &amp;c; O Son and Father, both one; O Lord, grant that we may pass the waves of this troublesome world, con∣tinually praising and giving thanks to the only Father and Son, to the Son and Father, to the Son our Master and Teacher, together with the Holy Ghost, altogether one, in whom are all things, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q> Add to this, that the doxo∣logies in the antient Liturgies were some of them expressed in fuller and stronger terms than that used in our daily services.</P>
<P>It is affirmed by Mr. <HI>Lindsey</HI> in his <HI>Apology,</HI> that the Fathers of the three first centuries were all what we now call <HI>Arians</HI> or <HI>Socinians.</HI> We might ask this Gentleman in the words of <HI>Dathan,</HI> &amp;c, but on much better grounds, <HI>wilt thou put out the eyes</HI> of Christians? The assertion has hardly its fellow in the whole circle of polemical divinity. Let these venerable Fathers speak for themselves. I take this opportunity to put the reader in mind of the same Gentleman's very disingenuous transla∣tion of that passage in <HI>Justin Martyr</HI>'s dialogue with <HI>Trypho,</HI> where he tells him, that there were those who admitted Christ to be the Messiah, tho'
<PB N="328" REF="341"/>
they believed him to be mere man. The whole passage is perfectly scrutinized, and a shameful omission of Mr. <HI>Lindsey</HI> taken notice of in Mr. BINGHAM<HI>'s Vindication of the Doctrine, &amp;c. of the Church of England,</HI> p. 23, 24, 25. <HI>See also</HI> Dr. RANDOLPH<HI>'s Vindicat. of the Trinity,</HI> part 3, p. 40. and <HI>Bp.</HI> BULL<HI>'s Judic. Eccles. Cathol.</HI> cap. 7mo, where he charges the <HI>Remonstrants</HI> with mutilating and curtailing this very passage. With what face will Mr. L. lay <HI>Socinianism,</HI> or <HI>Arianism</HI> at the door of <HI>Justin Martyr?</HI></P>
<P>The passage quoted from this father in the former part of this note is so strong and explicit, that it probably gave occasion to some <HI>Socinians</HI> to aver, that HE was the first who taught the doctrine of the Trinity. I said, <HI>some Socinians,</HI> be∣cause, as we have already noted, most <HI>Socinians</HI> and <HI>Socinus</HI> himself fathers this doctrine upon the Coun∣cil of <HI>Nice,</HI> with an absurdity which is exposed at large by Bp. <HI>Bull</HI> in his Defence of that Council. This duplicity is no small argument of <HI>Socinian</HI> distress.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Middleton,</HI> in resentment, I presume, of that explicitness with which <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> in the place referred to, and in many other, asserts the doctrine of the Trinity, and with a view to counteract it, takes much pains to represent his interpretation of Scripture as frequently absurd, and his doctrine as neither more nor less than refined <HI>Platonism.</HI> But
<PB N="329" REF="342"/>
the unfairness, or rather the falsity of both impu∣tations has often been shewn. The <HI>triad</HI> of <HI>Plato,</HI> (whose admirer, &amp;c. this holy father, it is well known, before his conversion was,) the <HI>mundane, animative,</HI> and <HI>intelligent</HI> nature of God, although it has been mentioned by some, improperly but ho∣nestly enough, to illustrate the doctrine in question, with an intention to adapt it in some degree to our apprehensions, could not possibly give rise to it. It is as clear as words can make it, that <HI>Justin</HI> the <HI>Martyr</HI> was a <HI>Trinitarian</HI> on principles very dif∣ferent from those of <HI>Justin</HI> the <HI>philosopher.</HI> Dr. M. most uncandidly vilifies the typical and allegorical representations, which occur often in this primitive writer, and in which probably he gratified not so much his own taste as that of those early ages.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> in his treatise entitled, <HI>An Endea∣vour to evince the certainty of Christian faith,</HI> &amp;c, cites historians of credit, who acquaint us, that when <HI>Julian</HI>'s design of falsifying the predictions of our Saviour, by rebuilding the Temple of <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> was defeated by miraculous eruptions of balls of fire, &amp;c, (as the story is told by <HI>Ammianus Mar∣cellinus,</HI> and many others,) almost all the <HI>Jews,</HI> who were eye-witnesses of this wonderful scene, were converted to the Christian Faith, and acknowleged Christ to be God. The writers referred to are <HI>So∣zomen, Nazianzen,</HI> and <HI>Socrates,</HI> and the following passage seems to be as plain and decisive as can be
<PB N="330" REF="343"/>
wished. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>It seems evident enough from these words, that the <HI>Jews</HI> who were converted on this occasion, and consequently Christians in general, at that time acknowledged Jesus Christ to be absolutely God.</P>
<P>Indeed the truth of this great doctrine is in some measure inferrible from the incredibility formerly objected to it by its adversaries. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, says <HI>Celsus;</HI> and <HI>Trypho</HI> speaks rather resentingly in the following words to <HI>Justin;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>Agreably to this, the same <HI>Trypho</HI> declares, that to assert Christ to have been born of a virgin is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Now I desire to ask, whether the doc∣trine of a miraculous birth, and bodily appearance of an <HI>inferior</HI> Deity for any supposable purpose whatever, be not sufficiently reconcileable both with <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Pagan</HI> principles, and with what we know to have been the sentiments of <HI>Julian</HI> himself? Or, whether we are not in all reason to look for the chief ground of difference between <HI>Justin</HI> and <HI>Trypho</HI> in the coequality we are assert∣ing? This will appear yet more clearly in a sub∣sequent note. It is, in short, this equality which
<PB N="331" REF="344"/>
constituted <HI>superstitionis novae genus,</HI> as Christianity is called by <HI>Suetonius</HI> in the life of <HI>Nero.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Willes,</HI> in his first discourse, prefixed to Sir <HI>Rog. L'Estrange</HI>'s translation of <HI>Josephus,</HI> says that <HI>Pilate</HI> wrote to <HI>Tiberius</HI> de Christo Deo. But where does he find this? The Acts of <HI>Pilate,</HI> so called, are confessedly spurious.</P>

<P>The fact was, the primitive Christians, like their immediate predecessors the Apostles, were reviled, defamed, and made as the <HI>filth of the world, and the off-scouring of all things;</HI> they were charged with the most detestable vices; with rebellion, mur∣der, incest, &amp;c; and to free them from these in∣famous reproaches, was one main business of the fathers in general, and especially of <HI>Justin Martyr, Athenagoras,</HI> and <HI>Tertullian.</HI></P>

<P>Page 126. <HI>(r) principles of polytheism.] Hesiod</HI> makes mention of many thousand Deities, and <HI>Varro</HI> of three hundred <HI>Jupiters;</HI> but both with a reservation of the properties and prerogatives of
<PB N="332" REF="345"/>
the Supreme God. These subaltern Deities were supposed to act as his instruments, and under his direction. Some of the wiser heathens however were ashamed of this latitudinarian system; and pretended to resolve their theology into allegory, &amp;c, as <HI>Zeno, Chrysippus,</HI> and other Stoics; and phi∣losophers of later date found it necessary to have recourse to the same expedient to elude the charge brought against the multitude of the heathen Gods by Christians. With respect to the Pagan notion of a subordination of Deities, we may affirm in the words of Dr. <HI>Heylin,</HI> that God is not only <HI>unus,</HI> but <HI>unicus,</HI> or in the phrase of Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> <Q>that our God is one, or rather very <HI>oneness,</HI> in which essential unity, says he, a Trinity personal sub∣sisteth.</Q></P>
<P>It will be well worth remarking, that the doc∣trine of the Trinity has often been represented as having no little colour or countenance both from <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Pagan</HI> principles. A. <HI>Ross,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at No. 38.</NOTE>in his <HI>View of all religions,</HI> &amp;c. undertakes to shew, that <Q>the doctrine of the Trinity was not unknown even by the light of nature to the Gentile philoso∣phers, poets, &amp;c. <HI>Zoroastres,</HI> says he, speaks of the Father, who, having perfected all things, hath delivered them to the second Mind, which Mind hath received from the Father knowlege
<PB N="333" REF="346"/>
and power. Here is a plain testimony of the first and second Person. Concerning the third, <HI>Zoroas∣tres</HI> saith, that the Divine Love proceeded from the Mind or Intellect; and what else is this Di∣vine Love but the Holy Ghost?</Q> He then pro∣ceeds to lay before the reader the principles of the <HI>Chaldean Magi,</HI> who <Q>acknowleged three begin∣nings, to wit, <HI>Ormases, Mitris,</HI> and <HI>Ariminis,</HI> i. e. God, the Mind, and Soul." He observes that <HI>Pythagoras</HI> was not ignorant of this mystery, when he placed all perfection in the number THREE, and made Love the original of all things.</Q> He gives us the sentiments of <HI>Zeno, Socrates, Numenius, Plotinus,</HI> and many others, <Q>who write very plainly of the <HI>Hypostases,</HI> &amp;c, so that <HI>no Christian can write more fully.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Let us hear now what a much better known, and an universally admired author has to offer upon the same argument. From the three divine attri∣butes of infinite Goodness, Wisdom, and Power, the <HI>Pythagoreans</HI> and <HI>Platonists</HI> seem to have framed their <HI>Trinity</HI> of what Dr. <HI>Cudworth</HI> calls <HI>Archichal Hypostases:</HI> to which he supposes <HI>Aristotle</HI> may be thought to allude in the following passage in his book <HI>de caelo.</HI> l. 1. c. 1. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (the Py∣thagoreans) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>In another place, this learned author gives us to understand, that <HI>Zoroastres,</HI> and the ancient <HI>Magi</HI> acknowleged the Supreme Deity under the different
<PB N="334" REF="347"/>
names of <HI>Mithras</HI> and <HI>Oromasius;</HI> which <HI>Mithras</HI> was commonly called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or three-fold. This, it seems, <HI>J. Vossius</HI> would refer to the three <HI>hypos∣tases</HI> in the Deity, agreeably to the Christian theo∣ry: but <HI>Cudworth</HI> thinks it to be more conform∣able to the <HI>Pythagoric</HI> or <HI>Platonic</HI> hypothesis of three distinct substances subordinate to each other. This writer observes elsewhere, that <HI>Pagan</HI> theo∣logy in general maintained a <HI>Trinity</HI> of universal principles, or Divine <HI>hypostases</HI> subordinate; the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> EN called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or intellect, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the second God; and the mun∣dane Soul, or animated world, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the third God. According to the same author, the <HI>Crocodile</HI> was a symbol of the first God of the Aegyp∣tians; <Q>an animal which when in the water sees without being seen:</Q> and among the same people <HI>a winged globe with a serpent springing out of it,</HI> was the <HI>Hieroglyphic</HI> of a triform Deity, or Trinity of Divine <HI>Hypostases.</HI> By the globe was signified the first incomprehensible Deity, without beginning or end, self-existent, &amp;c; by the <HI>Serpent,</HI> the Divine wisdom and creative vir∣tue; and by the <HI>wings,</HI> that active Spirit which quickens, enlivens, and cherishes all things.</P>
<P>Let us see now what was the theology of <HI>Julian,</HI> and the latter <HI>Platonists.</HI> This famous Apostate main∣tained, that the inferior Gods were ministers of a supreme God. He asserted, that this Supreme God, or first Deity, and fountain of all things, produced
<PB N="335" REF="348"/>
from himself, an eternal mind, and a corporeal, or "sensible animated Sun," as a great God in the visible world. The latter <HI>Platonists,</HI> in opposition to Christianity, held, that before the Trinity there was another supreme and highest <HI>Hypostasis,</HI> exist∣ing and remaining in the <HI>solitude of his own unity,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Cudworth</HI> literally translates the words of <HI>Jamblicus.</HI> This must at least be allowed to be language somewhat more intelligible than that of those old <HI>Platonists</HI> who taught, that there is a substance, a principle "in the order of nature su∣perior to intellect." They suppose this first and highest principle of all, to be, by reason of its absolute and transcendent perfection, not only above understanding, knowlege, and reason, but above essence itself; which, by the way, was the heresy of <HI>A. Joachim,</HI> condemned by the fourth <HI>Lateran</HI> Council. Our Author very justly calls this visionary doctrine <HI>mysterious Atheism;</HI> and it seems to have been adopted by that fantastic heretic <HI>Va∣lentinus,</HI> whose thirty Gods, or <HI>Aeons,</HI> were the pro∣duction or offspring of a self-originated Deity, whom he calls <HI>Bythus,</HI> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, i. e. unfathomable <HI>profundity;</HI> or, according to some, of <HI>profundity</HI> and <HI>silence.</HI> Even the theory of <HI>Hesiod,</HI> whether li∣terally, or physiologically understood, is much more agreeable to truth, and the <HI>Mosaic</HI> history. This old bard makes <HI>Chaos,</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> and <HI>Tar∣tarus,</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> the principles of all things. <HI>(Theo∣gon.</HI>
<PB N="336" REF="349"/>
<HI>v.</HI> 116. <HI>and seq.)</HI> In short, the philosophy we have been just speaking of absolutely refines away all religion, and the very belief of a God; because Divinity in the abstract can no more be said to produce, to act, or to govern, &amp;c. than <HI>wisdom</HI> can be said to be <HI>wise,</HI> or <HI>motion</HI> to <HI>move.</HI></P>
<P>At best, little solid or consistent can be extracted from this medley of principles; and if we under∣stand by <HI>a Trinity,</HI> what in reason we ought to un∣derstand by it, <HI>viz. a Trinity of three efficient, living, intelligent Persons, the sovereign causes and rulers of all things,</HI> (to use the words of a learned <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Extract from an anonymous Author quoted by Dr. RANDOLPH in his Vindica. p. 51. &amp;c.</NOTE>writer,) we shall look in vain for such a doctrine properly and precisely taught before the epoch of Christi∣anity. It is certain, the antient Pagan Theology derived partly from tradition, and partly from <HI>Ju∣daism.</HI> In the doctrines of the latter we are to look for the rise and foundation of the principal tenets of the Philosophers whose names have been men∣tioned; of whom some are known to have had communications with the <HI>Jews.</HI> What then were the sentiments of these descendants of <HI>Abraham</HI> heretofore with respect to the great doctrine before us? The question is a material one; and, unless I greatly mistake, the solution of it will terminate in a very satisfactory conclusion.</P>
<P>Christian writers differ but little in what they
<PB N="337" REF="350"/>
have advanced upon this head. To take a few of them as they fall in our way. <HI>Wollebius</HI> lays down the following principle as an indubitable one. <HI>Etsi Veteris Testamenti tempore doctrina S. S. Trinitatis obscurior fuerit, non tamen plane ignota fuit.</HI> He then quotes the first <HI>Chap.</HI> of <HI>Genesis,</HI> and other pas∣sages in the Old Testament, in common with other authors, in support of his position, or his <HI>Canon,</HI> as he calls it, and finishes the paragraph in the fol∣lowing words; <HI>quae testimonia tametsi pertinaces Ju∣daei eludere satagunt, Christianae tamen menti satisfa∣ciunt.</HI> The learned Dr. <HI>Lightfoot</HI>'s sentiments on this subject, which Mr. <HI>Parkhurst</HI> has adopted, or rather with particular warmth espoused, are as follows.</P>
<P><Q>The very first thing, says he, that is taught in all the Bible <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Genesis 1. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</NOTE>is this very mystery.</Q> God <HI>created;</HI> God, i. e. the Word <HI>said;</HI> and the Spirit, i. e. the Holy Ghost <HI>moved.</HI> <Q>So <HI>Moses</HI> also when he is to teach concerning the creation of man, he first teacheth that it was the Trinity that created him. <HI>And God said, Let us make man after our image.</HI> He saith <HI>Let us,</HI> to shew the Trinity of Persons; and he saith <HI>in our image,</HI> not <HI>in our images,</HI> to shew the unity of essence.</Q> The Tri∣nity is supposed by Dr. L. to be declared in many places; even at v. 4. of Deut. 6. <HI>Hear, O Israel, the Lord, our God, the Lord is one.</HI> Dr. L. gives
<PB N="338" REF="351"/>
this as the true reading, which, says he, <Q>teaches the Trinity in Unity and Unity in Trinity. Three words answer the three Persons, and the middle word our God, deciphering fitly the Se∣cond, who assumed our nature.</Q> This learned writer supposes the same mystery to be imported in the following among many other texts. <HI>Exo.</HI> 34. v. 6. <HI>Isa.</HI> 6. v. 3. <HI>Psalms</HI> 50. v. 1. 136. v. 1, 2, 3.</P>
<P>Indeed, Jesus Christ is by the almost unanimous suffrage of writers the <HI>Jehovah</HI> of the Old Testa∣ment. The <HI>Angel of the Covenant,</HI> the <HI>Angel</HI> who appeared to <HI>Moses</HI> at the <HI>bush,</HI> the chief of the <HI>Angels</HI> who were entertained by <HI>Abraham,</HI> &amp;c, is generally supposed to have been the Second Person in the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See particularly ALLIX. BULL. JUSTIN MARTYR. IRENAEUS, and TERTULLIAN.</NOTE>Trinity. A sensible writer endeavours to prove, that the doctrine of the Trinity is contained in the <HI>Law,</HI> and that it is in fact acknowleged and asserted by the <HI>Jewish</HI> Rabbies, by <HI>Philo</HI> and <HI>Mai∣monides,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Jewish Cabalists,</HI> says he, <Q>dis∣tinguish God into three Lights; and some of them call them by the same names, as the Christians, of the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and yet say that this does not at all break the Unity of God. Your famous <HI>Philo,</HI> says he, ex∣presses the same in many places.</Q> And he produ∣ces a considerable number of instances, by which it appears that this celebrated Rabbin at least lays
<PB N="339" REF="352"/>
himself open to the attacks of every Christian adversary.</P>
<P>To the same effect Dr. <HI>Randolph</HI> quotes a re∣markable passage from <HI>Eusebius,</HI> in which it is ob∣served, that, according to the doctrine of the <HI>Jews,</HI> <Q>there is, after the Essence of God, &amp;c, a prin∣ciple begotten of no other but the Father, being first-begotten, &amp;c, being the image of God, the power of God, the wisdom of God, and the word of God; the true light, the <HI>Sun of righteousness,</HI> &amp;c, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>There are two striking passages, the one in the book of</HI> Proverbs, <HI>and the other in the</HI> apocryphal <HI>book entitled the</HI> Wisdom of Solomon, <HI>which have been pretty generally considered as designative of the Second Person in the Christian Trinity.</HI> I was set up from everlasting, or ever the earth was. When he prepared the heavens, I was there; when he ap∣pointed the foundations of the earth, then was I by him, as one brought up with him, &amp;c. <HI>(Prov. 8. v. 22.</HI> &amp;c.) When all things were in quiet silence, thine Almighty Word leapt down from heaven out of thy royal throne, &amp;c, &amp;c. <HI>(Wisd. 18. v. 15.</HI> &amp;c.)</P>
<P>The anonymous Author of the testaments of the twelve Patriarchs, (who, as Dr. <HI>Grabe</HI> supposes, wrote at the latter end of the second century,) makes every one of them foretell the coming of the Messiah, and most of them, in the plainest terms, the incarnation of the Son of God, or ra∣ther simply of God.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="353"/>
All this put together, intricate or incoherent as it may appear, will be thought most clearly to im∣port a Trinity of some kind in the Godhead; and we may accordingly discern in a moment wherein lies the precise difference between the <HI>Pagan,</HI> the <HI>Jewish,</HI> the <HI>Arian,</HI> and the true Christian theory. By the hypothesis of each of the three former, the Supreme God neither is nor can be more than One Person; by that of the latter, the Deity consists of three Persons and one undivided essence. This as manifestly resists the idea of dependence and infe∣riority, as the other is compatible with it, or ra∣ther, under the notion of a Trinity, supposes it. In short, it will, I presume, be no easy matter to say what objection of weight <HI>Jews,</HI> and <HI>Gentiles, Pythagoreans,</HI> and <HI>Platonists,</HI> could have made to the Gospel, what obstacle there was to their <HI>be∣coming obedient to the faith without delay,</HI> except that the universally adopted principle of SUBORDINA∣TION was superseded, and effectually destroyed by the peculiarly Christian doctrine of EQUALITY.</P>
<P>Perhaps I shall be thought to take upon me here the character of Moderator in the dispute be∣tween Mr. <HI>Parkhurst</HI> and Dr. <HI>Priestly.</HI> I had no such intention. But if what has been offered does not exactly coincide with the notions of the for∣mer, it will at least in the result be subversive of the principles of the latter. The Christian doctrine of an equal Trinity will be established by the ac∣knowlegement

<P>Page 129. <HI>(s) Son of Mary.]</HI> Nothing can be more ridiculous than the <HI>Mahometan</HI> notions re∣specting the birth of our Saviour. <HI>Mary</HI> is sup∣posed to have conceived by the breath of <HI>Gabriel.</HI> Yet in the nineteenth Chapter of the <HI>Koran,</HI> the following inconsistent and impious expressions are put into the mouth of the Deity himself. <HI>We sent our Spirit Gabriel to Mary in the shape of a perfect man.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Sale</HI> observes, that <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s account of the delivery of <HI>Mary</HI> is like the fabulous one of <HI>Latona.</HI> Both, it seems, were delivered by a <HI>palm∣tree;</HI> and in the womb of the latter <HI>Apollo</HI> spoke, as in that of the former, say some, did <HI>Jesus.</HI> Pos∣sibly this may be a refinement upon the <HI>Koran</HI> itself; or upon the circumstance of the <HI>babe's leap∣ing in the womb of Elisabeth.</HI> Luke i. 41.</P>
<P>See <HI>Sale</HI>'s Note at Ch. 19. of the <HI>Koran.</HI></P>
<P>Page 131. <HI>(t) God is one God.]</HI> It is the tenet of all true <HI>Mussulmen,</HI> says the author of <HI>Mahometism explained,</HI> that the most abandoned sinners that ever existed shall be saved, <Q>provided they shall once during their lives have testified the Unity of God, by pronouncing that fundamental ar∣ticle of the <HI>Mussulman</HI> belief, <HI>there is no God but</HI> ALLAH, and MAHOMET <HI>is his Apostle.</HI></Q> This,
<PB N="343" REF="356"/>
I conceive, must be understood with some restric∣tion, and supposes no apostacy subsequent to the attestation in question. For the famous <HI>Mahometan</HI> Doctor, <HI>Algazali,</HI> in his comment on these two capital articles of their faith, delivers himself in the following words. <HI>He shall also believe that they that confess one God shall at length go out of the fire, after they have underwent the punishment due to their sins; so that by the favourable mercy of God, no per∣son shall remain in hell who acknowleged the Unity of the Godhead.</HI></P>
<P>The first <HI>Mussulmen</HI> gloried in the title of <HI>Unita∣rians</HI> upon every occasion. Some of them carried their zeal for the grand article of their religion to a degree of savage ferocity. We have a notable example of this in the history of the <HI>Saracens.</HI> At the siege of <HI>Damascus,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Omar,</HI> the second <HI>Caliph</HI> after <HI>Mahomet, Abu-Obeidah,</HI> the com∣mander of the <HI>Saracen</HI> army, had granted quarter to certain citizens; which was a piece of lenity so exasperating to <HI>Derar,</HI> an officer of very high rank, as to draw from him a declaration, seconded by the solemnity of an oath, that, for his part, <HI>he would never have mercy upon any that said that God had a son, and joined a partner with God.</HI></P>
<P>We learn from the anonymous author of <HI>Four Treatises,</HI> &amp;c, (who assures us he derives his au∣thorities from writers of the first class,) that the <HI>Mahometans</HI> carry this <HI>unitarian</HI> principle with them
<PB N="344" REF="357"/>
literally to their graves. His account of their fu∣neral solemnities is entertaining enough; but the following are the only particulars with which we are at all concerned. At the interment of a <HI>Mus∣sulman</HI> the <HI>Muezzin,</HI> or Cryer, must go before the corps, reciting with a loud voice, <HI>there is no God but very God.</HI> At the close of the whole ceremony, the defunct is addressed by the priest in these words. <HI>Be mindful of the covenant with which thou hast gone out of this world; bearing witness that there is no God but very God alone, and that Mahomet is his prophet, and that Paradise is for certain, and fire for certain, and the resurrection for certain;</HI> &amp;c, &amp;c.</P>
<P>How shall we reconcile all this with Mr. <HI>Locke's</HI> assertion, that <Q>to the light which the Messiah brought into the world with him, we must ascribe the owning and profession of one God, which the Mahometan religion hath derived and bor∣rowed from it.</Q> Strange assertion! The <HI>Ma∣hometan</HI> faith is this, that there is one Person in the Godhead; the Catholic faith is this, that there are three Persons in one Godhead. Remove this difference; and you will make a considerable breach in the <HI>middle wall of partition</HI> between the two re∣ligions. <HI>(See Disc.</HI> 4<HI>th. sub fin.)</HI></P>

Bp. <HI>Cumberland</HI> calls the Law of nature immutable, eternal, and universal. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dissertation on the Law of Nature. p. 89.</NOTE>I cannot think Bp. <HI>Taylor</HI> expresses himself with accuracy, and much less with true casuistical precision, in the following passage extracted by Dr. <HI>W. Lowth</HI> from the <HI>Ductor Dubitantium.</HI> <Q>If we be sent to read the laws of nature in the tables of our own hearts, where some things are disordered by passion, many more
<PB N="346" REF="359"/>
are written by interest; some are indited by custom, and others imprinted by education; and amongst several men these are the authors of con∣trary inscriptions; I say, if we have no better director than this, whereby to square our actions, we shall find ourselves at a loss for the managing our behaviour in some of the weightiest concerns of life.</Q> The <HI>inscriptions</HI> of passion, interest, and custom, &amp;c, are not those <HI>original</HI> impressions which are still legible, and sufficiently distinguish∣able by a candid and inquisitive mind. The law of nature, abstractedly considered, is still what Bp. <HI>Cumberland</HI> calls it.</P>
<P>That obnoxiousness to error from which men of the brightest parts, and the greatest professional abilities, are not exempt, is to writers in general at once an encouraging and an humbling circum∣stance.</P>
<P>The corruption of human reason, and the igno∣rance and error incident to our understandings, <Q>has, says a most excellent author, given manifold occasion for the benign interposition of Divine Providence, which in compassion to the frailty, the imperfection, and the blindness of human reason, hath been pleased at sundry times, and in divers manners, to discover and enforce its laws by an immediate and direct Revelation. The doctrines thus delivered we call the revealed or Divine law, and they are to be found only in the
<PB N="347" REF="360"/>
Scriptures. These precepts when revealed are found upon comparison to be really a part of the original law of nature, as they tend in all their consequences to man's felicity. But we are not from hence to conclude, that the knowlege of these truths was attainable by reason in its present corrupted state; since we find that, until they were revealed, they were hid from the wis∣dom of ages. As then the moral precepts of this law are indeed of the same original with those of the law of nature, so their intrinsic ob∣ligation is of equal strength and perpetuity. Yet undoubtedly the revealed law is of infinitely more authenticity than that moral system which is framed by ethical writers, and denominated the natural law. Because one is the law of na∣ture, expressly declared so to be by God him∣self; the other is only what, by the assistance of human reason, we imagine to be that law. If we could be as certain of the latter as we are of the former, both would have an equal authority; but till then they can never be put in any com∣petition. Municipal law is a rule of civil con∣duct. This distinguishes municipal law from the natural, or revealed; the former of which is the rule of moral conduct, and the latter not only the rule of moral conduct, but also the rule of faith.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Commen. on the Laws of England. Sect. 2. p. 42.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="361"/>
These periods seem to have slipped from the pen. The Scriptures are the Revelation of divine or supernatural truths, but of the <Q>original law of nature</Q> they are only the revival, or republica∣tion. THEY plainly declare that to be the will of God which, in <HI>the times of ignorance</HI> and corrup∣tion, might rather be said to have been obtruded upon the world, than recommended to it, as the will of God, by the philosophers; <HI>they</HI> teach that by authority which, before, reason only dictated, or opinion espoused; so that now every species of immorality is totally without excuse. Properly speaking, it is not the Divine Will, but the Divine Nature, "which was <Q>hid from the wisdom of ages.</Q> For though we have in Scripture only the <HI>sure word</HI> of morality, yet <HI>Socrates, Plato,</HI> and <HI>Tully,</HI> as far as they taught truly, taught the mora∣lity of Scripture. In a word, Revelation is neces∣sarily the rule of conduct, but directly and imme∣diately the rule of faith.</P>

<Q>It is allowed on all hands, says Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> that the <HI>world</HI> was reconciled by Christ Jesus to the <HI>one, only, great and supreme God.</HI> But, this very <HI>same God</HI> (for the word is but once used in the whole sentence) was <HI>in</HI> Christ; manifest <HI>in</HI> the flesh, and <HI>reconciling the world to himself.</HI> And were there no other passage of Scripture to be found, this alone is sufficient to overthrow the whole doctrine of <HI>Arianism;</HI> which, as far as the Scripture is concerned, depends upon this one as∣sertion, that <HI>the word</HI> GOD, <HI>in Scripture,</HI> NEVER <HI>signifies a complex notion of more persons than one; but</HI> ALWAYS <HI>means one person only, viz. either the person of the Father singly, or the person of the Son singly.</HI> Which is absolutely false: for here it sig∣nifies <HI>both.</HI> The text considers God as agent and patient at the same time, and upon the same oc∣casion; as the <HI>reconciler</HI> of the world, in the <HI>per∣son</HI> of the <HI>Son;</HI> and the object to whom the <HI>re∣conciliation was made,</HI> in the <HI>person</HI> of the <HI>Father;</HI> yet there is but one word (GOD) to express them
<PB N="357" REF="370"/>
both. So that the word God, though of the <HI>singular</HI> number, is of a <HI>plural</HI> comprehension. And thus I find it to have been taken by some of the most eminent writers before the council of <HI>Nice; Plasmatus in initio homo per manus</HI> DEI, id est, FILII et SPIRITUS, says <HI>Irenaeus;</HI> putting the singular name of God for the <HI>two persons</HI> of the <HI>Son</HI> and <HI>Spirit.</HI> And the same word, in the language of <HI>Origen,</HI> (if we are allowed to take the version of <HI>Ruffinus</HI> as genuine,) includes the whole <HI>three</HI> persons: <HI>igitur de</HI> DEO, <HI>id est,</HI> de PATRE, <HI>et</HI> FILIO, <HI>et</HI> SPIRITU SANCTO. And our excellent church has used the word <HI>God</HI> in the same comprehensive sense; as in the <HI>Blessing</HI> after the communion service, GOD ALMIGHTY, <HI>the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</HI></Q>
<P>I am afraid this is not so full an answer to the above assertion as was to be wished; and that it is not absolutely sufficient for the "overthrow of the whole doctrine of <HI>Arianism."</HI> In the first place, Dr. <HI>Clarke's</HI> proselytes will be apt to insist, that the whole doctrine of <HI>Arianism</HI> does not depend upon this one assertion; and in the next place, that, if it did, Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> has advanced nothing here forci∣ble enough to overthrow it. It is true, they will say, <HI>God was in Christ;</HI> but in what sense? why, by his grace, his influence, and spiritual commu∣nications; as he is likewise said to be <HI>in</HI> us; and as Christ is said to be <HI>in</HI> us; and as we are said to
<PB N="358" REF="371"/>
be <HI>in</HI> God, and to be <HI>in</HI> Christ, by the purity of our hearts and affections. This, they will tell us, is plain simple theory, without any wanton refine∣ment, or imaginary distinction of "agent and pa∣tient, &amp;c." And with regard to the authorities of <HI>Irenaeus, Origen,</HI> and the <HI>Blessing</HI> in the Com∣munion service, they will add, that they cannot admit either a private sentiment, or a public doc∣trine to be the standard of true Chistianity.</P>
<P>As this is specious enough, it may be proper to disencumber ourselves from the weight of this same <HI>Arian</HI> assertion, by other considerations. <HI>Hac non successit, alia progrediamur via.</HI></P>
<P>First then let it be observed, that though the <HI>English</HI> word <HI>God</HI> be "of the <HI>singular</HI> number," yet the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word <HI>Elohim,</HI> of which it is the translation, is confessedly "of a <HI>plural</HI> compre∣hension." Accordingly it has been demonstrated over and over again, that the ancient <HI>Jews</HI> held a plurality of some kind in the Deity. <HI>(Vid. Supr.)</HI></P>
<P>But, secondly, we may recur to considerations still more internal, and indisputable. If it has been abundantly made to appear, that the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, as properly and truly as the Father is God, the term God must unavoid∣ably be acknowleged to include, or to "signify a complex notion of <HI>more persons than one,"</HI> in many places of holy writ. It will suffice to pro∣duce
<PB N="359" REF="372"/>
a few instances. The Father is said to be <HI>in</HI> us, 1 John. 4. 13. or to <HI>dwell in</HI> us, or <HI>abide</HI> with us, and the Son is said to be <HI>in us,</HI> &amp;c, Rom. 8. v. 10. and the Holy Ghost is said to be <HI>in</HI> us; and, in a case which he mentions, St. Paul tells the <HI>Co∣rinthians,</HI> it would be reported, that <HI>God</HI> was <HI>in them of a truth.</HI> 1 Cor. 14. 25. Now can any man assign a tolerable reason why the word <HI>God</HI> in this passage should not be regarded as inclusive of the whole blessed Trinity? <HI>Another Scripture saith, every one of us shall give account of himself to God;</HI> Rom. 14. 12. but if in the term, <HI>God,</HI> Jesus Christ is not comprehended, what will become of the text which assures us <HI>we must all appear before</HI> HIS <HI>judgment-seat?</HI> 2 Cor. 5. 10. The great Apostle of the Gentiles puts the <HI>Elders</HI> of the <HI>Church of Ephe∣sus</HI> in mind, that he had <HI>not shunned to declare unto them all the counsel of God:</HI> and if he who <HI>purchased</HI> this <HI>Church with his own blood,</HI> and he who ap∣pointed <HI>overseers over it,</HI> are to be considered as parties in this <HI>counsel,</HI> (and surely they are to be so considered,) the word, God, has manifestly a <HI>complex</HI> signification here, and <HI>means</HI> more than <HI>one person only.</HI> Acts 20. 27, 28. The <HI>Kingdom of God</HI> is a phrase which, in most places where it occurs, will, I presume, not barely admit but require the same latitude of application. The <HI>Word of God</HI> may be regarded in the same light. Lastly I shall close these examples with one which is the more eligible,
<PB N="360" REF="373"/>
because it is contained in a text which has already undergone examination, and to which our adver∣saries are for ever putting in their claim. I mean v. 28th. of the 15th. Chapter of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s first Epist. to the <HI>Cor.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Disc. 6. sub fin.</NOTE><HI>When all things shall be sub∣dued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God,</HI> i. e. the complement of the Deity, the Trinity in Unity, <HI>may be all in all.</HI> Every critical eye sees clearly that, in this passage, for the complex word—God—we must read the single term Father, before we can with any sort of propriety accom∣modate it to the purpose of the anti-trinitarians. In this case indeed, there would be an obvious sense, and a natural antithesis, and both in their favour.</P>
<P>The other text—<HI>I am in the Father, and the Fa∣ther in me,</HI> John 14. 11., which Mr. J. produces as synonomising with the preceding, may be ex∣plained away by similar means. The <HI>Arian</HI> has the following passages to oppose to them. <HI>That they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us; that they may be one, even as we are one. I in them, and thou in me,</HI> &amp;c. John 17. 21, 22, 23. I am far from saying, or even insinuating, that there is any real difficulty in all this; or that the orthodox construction of
<PB N="361" REF="374"/>
the passages adduced by Mr. J. does not fairly and properly belong to them. I only take leave to observe, and have an obvious view in observing, that, with regard to the defence of Christian doc∣trine in general, and particularly to the confuta∣tion of the assertion above-mentioned, this truly respectable author might have selected texts less equivocal, less liable to prevarication.</P>
<P>It is observable, Dr. <HI>I. Watts</HI> makes the texts <HI>I am in the</HI> FATHER and <HI>the</HI> FATHER IN ME, &amp;c, subservient to his doctrine of the inherency, or <HI>indwelling</HI> of the Father, i. e. of the godhead in the MAN <HI>Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>It has been remarked, that by a small alteration in the punctuation, the 3d. v. of the 17th. Chap. of St. <HI>John, that they might know thee the only true God,</HI> &amp;c, may be thus rendered, <HI>that they might know thee, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent, to be the only true God.</HI> This reading is supported by the authorities of <HI>Novatian,</HI> St. <HI>Austin,</HI> and St. <HI>Ambrose.</HI> But it will be prudent, I believe, to wave these authorities. These Fathers seem to have been <HI>in great fear, where no fear was.</HI> We may safely abide by the sense of the text before us in its pre∣sent state. Were we really in distress, it might be worth our while to appeal to these <HI>early opinions</HI> in our favour.</P>

<P>Page. 161. <HI>(z) abstract speculation.]</HI> Among the many tripartite representations of the Trinity, material and intellectual, <HI>essence, intelligence,</HI> and <HI>will,</HI> have been regarded by some as significant of that great mystery; which seems to be much about as wise a symbolization as that of those who gravely affirm the <HI>moon</HI> to be an emblem of the <HI>Church, birds</HI> emblems of <HI>heretics,</HI> and <HI>fish of anti∣christ.</HI> <Q>We find in our nature, says a celebrated writer, which is said to be made after the image of God, a very near resemblance of the Holy Trinity, and of the different operations of each of the Divine Persons. For example; to know a thing present, and to remember what is past, and to love or hate, are different operations of our mind, and performed by different faculties of it. Of these, the understanding is the <HI>Father</HI> faculty, and gives being to things, as to us; for what we know not, is to us as if it were not: this answers to creation. From this faculty pro∣ceeds the <HI>second,</HI> that of <HI>memory,</HI> which is a pre∣serving of that the understanding has created to us. Then the <HI>third</HI> faculty, that of the will, which loves or hates, proceeds from both the
<PB N="363" REF="376"/>
other; for we cannot love or hate what is not first created by the understanding, and preserved to us by the memory.</Q></P>
<P>The plastic power of a warm imagination, or a sanguine zeal, will form emblems and adumbra∣tions of the Trinity in all countries, and in all ages of the world. We are told the old <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> and modern <HI>Americans,</HI> worshipped the Deity under the picture of a sun with <HI>three heads.</HI></P>
<P>As infidelity will take all advantages of pious whim, and indiscreet attachment, so will it as surely avail itself to its utmost of certain strange notions, which have been advanced, in direct va∣riation from the received doctrine of the primitive Church. It is not easy to say with what propriety, or in what sense, Papists have called the <HI>Virgin</HI> the <HI>complement</HI> of the Trinity. Mr. <HI>Sale</HI> tells us, some of the Christian <HI>Arabs</HI> associate with a Sect that worshipped the <HI>Virgin</HI> as a God. We learn from the same author, and others, that some of the <HI>Ni∣cene</HI> Council maintained there were two Gods be∣sides God the Father, <HI>viz. Christ</HI> and the <HI>Virgin.</HI> Others have affirmed, that the <HI>Spirit</HI> was the <HI>crea∣ture</HI> of the <HI>Son.</HI> The Bp. of <HI>Agen</HI> wrote an expos∣tulatory letter to Father <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who had roundly asserted, that <HI>Mary</HI> was the <HI>fourth</HI> Person in the Godhead.</P>

or heavenly body immediately after his resurrec∣tion; the subtilty and tenuity of which was shewn by his entering into the place where his disciples were assembled when the DOORS WERE SHUT, &amp;c; <Q>however its glory were for the time suspended, partly for the better convincing them of the truth of his resurrection, and partly because they were not then able to bear the splendor of it.</Q></P>
<P>But there are many reasons why we should not humour this child of a fruitful imagination. When our Lord, after his conversation, &amp;c, with the two disciples at <HI>Emmaus,</HI> vanished <HI>out of their sight,</HI> had he not <HI>that</HI> body with which he was crucified? Had he not <HI>that</HI> body when he <HI>shewed</HI> his disciples his <HI>hands</HI> and his <HI>feet;</HI> when he called upon them to <HI>handle</HI> him, &amp;c, and assured them that it was he himself who addressed them? The truth is, he could appear or disappear at pleasure, by virtue of his divine power; and therefore it was by no means necessary he should be invested with a <HI>spi∣ritual</HI> or heavenly body for that purpose. The re∣surrection of <HI>that</HI> body which was crucified, which <HI>rose from the dead,</HI> and with which Jesus Christ con∣versed upon earth <HI>forty days,</HI> is the proper pledge and earnest of <HI>our</HI> resurrection; his <HI>glorious body,</HI> strictly so called, being probably assumed at his <HI>Ascension.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>Ignatius,</HI> in his epistle to the <HI>Smyrnaeans,</HI> ex∣presses himself very emphatically upon this subject.

<P>It has been observed by many, that the good fathers from whom passages are extracted on this subject, together with St. <HI>Paul</HI> before them, in his 15<HI>th. Chap. of the</HI> 1<HI>st. Epis. to the Cor.,</HI> speak only of the <HI>resurrection of the just:</HI> but it is at the same time to be noted, that, with respect to this principle of incorruption, the change in the gene∣ral <HI>resurrection</HI> will undoubtedly be the same both of the <HI>just and the unjust.</HI></P>
<P>Weak reasoning, like a weapon which falls short of its aim, will be returned upon us by our ad∣versary. St. <HI>Chrysostom</HI>'s argument, and that of some other fathers, and of many modern Divines, for the <HI>resurrection of the same body,</HI> drawn from the supposed absurdity of <HI>one</HI> body's sinning and <HI>another's</HI> suffering, is obviously a futile one, and may be rendered serviceable to the interest of the enemy. The body undergoes a great variety of changes in the course of life; and, it might be asked, would not every imaginable purpose of
<PB N="370" REF="383"/>
retribution be fully answered by a future state of happiness, or misery, to soul and body, whence∣soever <HI>that body</HI> might be supposed to <HI>come?

I venture to think this is put out of doubt by what has been submitted to the reader; though luckily Dr. <HI>S.</HI> himself will help us out if we have any how failed in our argumentation upon this subject. For in his account of <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s <HI>third form,</HI> or <HI>rule of faith,</HI> in his book <HI>De Praescriptione Haereticorum,</HI> the Dr. thus expresses himself. <Q>Nor is his <HI>third Form</HI> or <HI>Rule,</HI> &amp;c, any <HI>Creed</HI> of any Church, but only a summary of the doctrines of the Gospel.</Q> This father then intended his <HI>Form</HI> or <HI>Rule,</HI> as a sum∣mary of Christian doctrine, even according to Dr. <HI>S</HI>'s account of the matter; and in <HI>it,</HI> as it is quoted by <HI>himself,</HI> we have mention in plain terms of the <HI>resurrection of the flesh.</HI> The words of <HI>Ter∣tullian</HI>

Some add, that he pounded them in a mortar, and reduced them all to one mass, which he divided into four parts, and car∣ried them to the top of four several mountains; and that then, holding up their heads, which he retained in his hands, he called them severally by their names; and that each came accordingly for his head, and flew away with it.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MORGAN<HI>'s</HI> Mahom. explained.

<P>It is certain <HI>Mahomet</HI> refined much upon the history of <HI>Moses</HI> in general; and my author ob∣serves, that probably this wild story has its foun∣dation in God's command to <HI>Abraham</HI> to offer a sacrifice of a <HI>turtle-dove,</HI> and a <HI>pigeon,</HI> among other animals, as we read in the 15<HI>th Chapter of Gen. v.</HI> 9. <HI>et seq.</HI></P>

<P>We have already exhibited to the reader many strange Pagan notions relative to the nature, &amp;c, of the Deity; but perhaps the most extraordinary, the most eccentric of them all, has not yet been remembered. It is not properly a heresy indeed, but it is an error which may fitly occupy this place. The heathen mystical theologists often call God <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—<HI>male</HI> and <HI>female,</HI> signifying thereby, though grossly, yet not unemphatically, the <HI>creative</HI> power of the Supreme Being. Dr. <HI>Cudworth</HI> cites a passage from a hymn of <HI>Synesius,</HI> (whom he calls a <HI>learned</HI> and <HI>pious</HI> Bishop,) wherein the Almighty is addressed under expressions precisely equiva∣lent:—
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
Agreeably hereunto, <HI>Varro</HI> quotes from <HI>Soranus,</HI> an eminent poet, (according to our author,) the verses following:
<Q><PB N="377" REF="390"/>
<L>Jupiter omnipotens, regum rex ipse Deûmque.</L>
<L>Progenitor genitrixque Deûm; Deus unus et omnis.</L></Q></P>
<P>Methinks this sentiment becomes the heathen theologist, or poet, much better than the Christian Divine.</P>
<P>Far from meaning to rank a late very eminent writer, Dr. <HI>I. Watts,</HI> in the number of notorious heretics, or in the least to detract from the excel∣lence of his character, I think myself bound in duty to my subject to take notice here of the sin∣gularity of his sentiments. <Q>His idea of the Di∣vinity of Christ was, that <HI>the Godhead, the Deity itself, personally distinguished as the</HI> FATHER, <HI>was united to the man Christ Jesus, in consequence of which union, or indwelling of the Godhead, he be∣came properly God.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It seems these were likewise Dr. DODDERIDGE'S senti∣ments.</NOTE>He conceived this union to have subsisted before the Saviour's appearance in the flesh, and that <HI>the human soul of Christ ex∣isted with the Father from before the foundation of the world;</HI> on which ground he maintains the real descent of Christ from heaven to earth, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>In these sentiments there is not so much as a re∣ference to the Holy Ghost. But we are not to consider them as final. We shall find the Dr. to have had more enlarged notions respecting the doc∣trine of the Trinity.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="391"/>
In his SOLEMN ADDRESS TO THE GREAT AND EVER-BLESSED GOD, on a review of what he <HI>had written in the Trinitarian Controversy,</HI> he puts the following questions with all that <HI>humble reverence,</HI> (his own words,) and that <HI>holy awe</HI> WHICH <HI>becomes a creature in the presence of his God.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Hast thou not, O Lord God Almighty, hast thou not transacted thy divine and important af∣fairs among men by thy Son <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and by thy holy Spirit? And hast thou not ordained that men should transact their highest and most momentous concerns with thee, by thy Son, and and by thy Spirit? Hast thou not, by the mouth of thy Son <HI>Jesus,</HI> required all that profess his religion to be washed with water in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost? Is it not my duty then to enquire, who or what are these sacred names,</Q> and what they signify?</P>
<P><Q>Hast thou not ascribed divine names, and titles, and characters to thy Son and thy holy Spirit in thy word, as well as assumed them to thyself? And hast thou not appointed to them such glorious offices as cannot be executed with∣out something of divinity or true Godhead in them? And yet art not thou, and thou alone the true God? How shall a poor weak creature be able to adjust and reconcile these clashing ideas, and to understand this mystery? Or must I be∣lieve and act blindfold,</Q> without understanding?</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="392"/>
<Q>Holy Father, (he proceeds,) thou knowest, how firmly I believe with all my soul, whatso∣ever thou hast plainly written and revealed in thy word. I believe Thee to be the only true God, the supreme of beings, self-sufficient for thine own existence, and for all thy infinite af∣fairs and transactions among creatures. I believe thy only Son <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> to be all-sufficient for the glorious work of mediation between God and man, to which thou hast appointed him. I believe he is a man, in whom dwells all the ful∣ness of the Godhead bodily. I believe he is one with God; he is God manifested in the flesh; and that the man <HI>Jesus</HI> is so closely and insepa∣rably united with the true and eternal Godhead, as to become one person, even as the soul and body make one man.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I believe also thy blessed Spirit hath almighty power and influence to do all thy will, to instruct men effectually in divine truths, &amp;c. I yield up myself joyfully and thankfully to this method of thy salvation, as it is revealed in thy gospel. But I acknowlege my darkness still. I want to have this wonderful doctrine of the all-sufficience of thy Son and Spirit for these divine works made a little plainer.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Hadst thou informed me, gracious Father, in any place of thy word, that this divine doctrine is not to be understood by men, and yet they
<PB N="380" REF="393"/>
were required to believe it, I would have sub∣dued all my curiosity to faith, &amp;c. But I can∣not find thou hast any where forbid me to under∣stand it, or to make these enquiries. My con∣science is the best natural light thou hast put within me, and since thou hast given me the Scriptures, my own conscience bids me search the Scriptures to find out truth, &amp;c. I have, there∣fore, been long searching into this divine doc∣trine, that I may pay thee due honour with un∣derstanding. Surely I ought to know the God whom I worship, whether he be one pure and simple being, or whether thou art a threefold deity, consisting of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Dear and blessed God, hadst thou been pleased, in any one plain Scripture, to have informed me which of the different opinions about the Holy Trinity, among the contending parties of Chris∣tians, had been true, thou knowest with how much zeal, satisfaction, and joy, my unbiassed heart would have opened itself to receive and embrace the discovery. Hadst thou told me plainly in any single text, that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three real distinct persons in thy divine nature, I had never suffered myself to be bewildered in so many doubts, nor embar∣rassed with so many strong fears of assenting to the mere inventions of men, instead of divine
<PB N="381" REF="394"/>
doctrine; but I should have humbly and imme∣diately accepted thy words, so far as it was pos∣sible for me to understand them, as the only rule of my faith. Or hadst thou been pleased so to express and include this proposition in the several scattered parts of thy book, from whence my reason and conscience might with ease find out, and with certainty infer this doctrine, I should have joyfully employed all my reasoning powers, with their utmost skill and activity, to have found out this inference,</Q> and ingrafted it into my soul.</P>
<P><Q>Thou hast called the poor and the ignorant, the mean and foolish things of this world, to the knowlege of thyself and thy Son, and taught them to receive and partake of the Salvation which thou hast provided. But how can such weak creatures ever take in so strange, so diffi∣cult, and so abstruse a doctrine as this; in the explication and defence whereof, multitudes of men, even men of learning and piety, have lost themselves in infinite subtilties of dispute, and endless mazes of darkness? And can this strange and perplexing notion of three real persons going to make up one true God, be so necessary and so important a part of that Christian doctrine, which, in the old Testament and the new, is represented as so plain and so easy, even to the meanest understandings?</Q></P>
<P><Q>O thou searcher of hearts who knowest all
<PB N="382" REF="395"/>
things, I appeal to thee concerning the sincerity of my enquiries into these discoveries of thy word.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I humbly call thee to witness, O my God, what a holy jealousy I ever wear about my heart, lest I should do the slightest dishonour to thy supreme Majesty in any of my enquiries or de∣terminations. Thou seest what a religious fear, and what a tender solicitude I maintain on my soul, lest I should think or speak any thing to di∣minish the grandeurs and honours of thy Son <HI>Jesus,</HI> my dear Mediator, &amp;c. Thou knowest how much I am afraid of speaking one word which may be construed into a neglect of thy blessed Spirit, from whom I hope I am daily receiving happy influences of light and strength. Guard all the motions of my mind, O Almighty God, against every thing that borders upon these dangers. Forbid my thoughts to indulge, and forbid my pen to write one word, that should sink those grand ideas which belong to thyself, or thy Son, or thy Holy Spirit. Forbid it, O my God, that ever I should be so unhappy as to un∣glorify my Father, my Saviour, or my Sanctifier, in any of my sentiments or expressions concern∣ing them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Blessed and faithful God, hast thou not pro∣mised that the meek thou wilt guide in judgment, the meek thou wilt teach thy way? Hath not
<PB N="383" REF="396"/>
thy Son, our Saviour, assured us, that our hea∣venly Father will give his holy Spirit to them who ask him? And is he not appointed to guide us into all truth? Have I not sought the gracious guidance of thy good Spirit continually? Am I not truly sensible of my own darkness and weak∣ness, my dangerous prejudices on every side, and my utter insufficiency for my own conduct? Wilt thou leave such a poor creature bewildered among a thousand perplexities, which are raised by the various opinions and contrivances of men to explain thy divine truth?</Q></P>
<Q>Help me, heavenly Father, for I am quite tired and weary of these human explainings so various and uncertain. When wilt thou explain it to me thyself, O my God, by the secret and certain dictates of thy Spirit, according to the intimations of thy word?</Q>
<P>Now, for truth's sake, I desire to ask any in∣telligent, impartial, and candid reader, whether we have not in these passages strong indications of a wavering, though pious mind? Whether such language as this does not rather tend to encourage specious scepticism, than sound faith? Whether it is not chargeable with inconsistency between reverence and remonstrance, between declarations of acqui∣escence and expostulations of discontent? Whether, according to Dr. <HI>W</HI>—'s ideas, all ecclesiastical au∣thority is not as such altogether odious, or contemp∣tible;
<PB N="384" REF="397"/>
and whether, for what appears to the con∣trary from these periods, Christianity might not flourish without the existence of Church, pastor, or teacher? Whether we have not in this illustrious Dissenter an extraordinary instance of the compati∣bility of radical and invincible prejudice with an <HI>ho∣nest and good heart,</HI> and a solid understanding? Whether Dr. <HI>W.</HI> had any thing like sufficient grounds for his suspicion that the orthodox received doctrines are resolvible into mere <Q>explainings, inventions, or contrivances of men?</Q> Whether he does not appear to be unreasonably, though sin∣cerely anxious to <HI>understand all mysteries,</HI> while at the same time he could not but know, that the capital doctrines of the Gospel are delivered AS mysterious, and that Christians are supposed and required to <HI>walk by faith, and not by sight?</HI> Whe∣ther he does not most erroneously convert a <HI>particu∣lar</HI> promise into a <HI>general</HI> one; not recollecting that, though, for obvious and very important purposes, our <HI>heavenly Father will give his Holy Spirit to them that ask him,</HI> yet that Spirit was by no means <Q>ap∣pointed</Q> to <HI>guide</HI> every individual Christian into <HI>all</HI> spiritual <HI>truth?</HI> Whether, had we been told "plainly;" in so many words, <Q>in any single text, that the Father, Son, and holy Spirit are three real and distinct persons in the divine nature,</Q> it had been possible for D. <HI>W.</HI> to have misunderstood it; or whether he, or any body else, could have
<PB N="385" REF="398"/>
been "bewildered in any doubts," with respect to this doctrine? Whether such a "discovery" of it would not have been received every where with "unbiassed hearts," and with universal <Q>zeal, sa∣faction and joy,</Q> a few instances perhaps of ob∣duracy, &amp;c, excepted? Whether, had it been <Q>so expressed and included in the several scattered parts</Q> of Scripture, that the Doctor's <Q>reason and conscience could with ease have found it out, and with certainty inferred it,</Q> there would have been the least occasion for the "skill and activity of his rational powers?" Whether, after all, the doctrine in question be not expressed, or in∣cluded in the sacred pages sufficiently to warrant any man's firm assent to it; especially when we take into the account the whole weight of that evidence by which we prove its correspondency with the sense of antiquity, and the belief of the primitive Church? Whether the wisest and the weakest are not equally incapable of "taking in so difficult, and so abstruse a doctrine" as that of the Trinity? Whether the Christian doctrine concerning things spiritual and mysterious is really "represented," either in the Old Testament or the New, as <Q>plain and easy even to the meanest understanding?</Q> Whether, granting that <Q>multitudes even of men of learning and piety have lost themselves in in∣finite subtilties of dispute, &amp;c, in the explica∣tion and defence</Q> of the doctrine before us, all
<PB N="386" REF="399"/>
this should not be principally attributed to anti∣trinitarian artifice, and to a gradual departure from that simplicity in which it was originally taught and received in the world? Whether, if this <Q>perplex∣ing notion of three real persons going to make up one true God</Q> be a part of Christian doctrine, it is not <HI>prima facie</HI> the most "necessary and the most important?" Finally, whether the doctrine of the Trinity, as held in the Church, has not at least as much countenance from Scripture, and even from reason, as Dr. <HI>W</HI>—'s notion of the <HI>indwelling of the Deity in the Man Christ Jesus;</HI> and whether this is not in effect acknowleged by himself?</P>
<P>As to the notion itself, it is, I trust, to all in∣tents and purposes refuted in the foregoing pages; and I shall content myself with expressing my astonishment at the force of prejudice in one who so strongly recommends, or more properly inculcates an "indifference for every thing but truth," <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Improvement of the Mind. p. 285.</NOTE>and censures so severely all domestic, national, or party attachments. For with all his gentleness, benevo∣lence, charity, and love of truth, Dr. <HI>W.</HI> appears to me to have been biassed by more than ordinary prepossessions. He who has expressed himself in the manner we have seen; he who has occasionally de∣clared, that he <Q>allowed the greatest distinction pos∣sible between the sacred three in the divine nature, which does not arise to three distinct conscious
<PB N="387" REF="400"/>
minds or spirits;" and that he was fully "es∣tablished in the belief of the <HI>Deity of the blessed Three,</HI> though he knew not the <HI>manner of explica∣tion,</HI></Q> must, to my apprehension, be considered as protesting against the doctrine of a Trinity of <HI>Persons,</HI> chiefly because it was an established one; because it was the doctrine of the Church.</P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer on this case as it is un∣common; as it is the case of a great and good man, whom (to borrow Dr. <HI>Johnson</HI>'s words) <Q>every Christian Church would rejoice to have adopted.</Q></P>

By what means the <HI>Romanists</HI> have since qualified the sense of these pas∣sages, or reconciled the same with principles of a later date, I have no occasion to inquire. But in one of them there is a singularity which, I believe, will pay any man for his trouble in the reading. It is to be found in <HI>Theodoret;</HI> and is translated by the
<PB N="388" REF="401"/>
great prelate as follows. <Q>Ye may commonly see, that our doctrine is known, not only of them that are the doctors of the Church, and the mas∣ters of the people, but also even of the <HI>tailors,</HI> and <HI>smiths,</HI> and <HI>weavers,</HI> and of all artificers: yea, and farther also of <HI>women;</HI> and that not only of them that be learned, but also of <HI>labour∣ing women,</HI> and <HI>sempsters,</HI> and <HI>servants,</HI> and <HI>hand∣maids.</HI> Neither only the <HI>citizens,</HI> but also the <HI>country-folks</HI> do very well understand the same.

<P>Page 262. <HI>(pp) mistaken in that judgment.]</HI> An eminent and learned writer of the last century, whom I have quoted before, observes, (and the observation has been also cited,) that <Q>heresy is not an error of the understanding, but of the will;</Q> and to this doctrine, properly stated, we can readily subscribe. But in the excess of his moderation, this Right Rev. author sometimes questions, in effect at least, the authority, not only of all eccle∣siastical traditions, and councils, but of the Scrip∣ture itself; giving us sentiments wholly incongru∣ous with every idea of faith, system, or establish∣ment.
<PB N="389" REF="402"/>
Witness <HI>those</HI> contained in the following extract, which, to my imagination, nothing but the zeal of adherency to a favourite principle could have drawn from the pen of so able a writer, and so professed a casuist.</P>
<Q>Since, says he, holy Scripture is the repository of divine truths, and the great rule of faith, to which all sects of Christians do appeal for pro∣bation of their several opinions, and since all agree in the articles of the Creed as things clearly and plainly set down, and as containing all that which is of simple and prime necessity; and since on the other side there are in Scripture many other mysteries, and matters of question upon which there is a vail; since there are so many copies with infinite varieties of reading; since a various interpunction, a parenthesis, a letter, an accent may much alter the sense; since some places have divers literal senses, many have spi∣ritual, mystical, and allegorical meanings; since there are so many tropes, metonymies, ironies, hyperboles, proprieties and improprieties of lan∣guage, whose understanding depends upon such circumstances that it is almost impossible to know its proper interpretation, now that the know∣lege of such circumstances and particular stories is irrecoverably lost; since there are some mysteries which, at the best advantage of expression, are not easy to be apprehended, and whose explication,
<PB N="390" REF="403"/>
by reason of our imperfections, must needs be dark, sometimes weak, sometimes unintelligible; and lastly, since those ordinary means of ex∣pounding Scripture, as searching the originals, conference of places, parity of reason, and ana∣logy of faith, are all dubious, uncertain, and very fallible, he that is the wisest and by conse∣quence the likeliest to expound truest in all pro∣bability of reason, will be very far from confi∣dence, because every one of these and many more are like so many degrees of improbability and incertainty, all depressing our certainty of finding out truth in such mysteries, and amidst so many difficulties. And therefore a wise man that considers this, would not willingly be pre∣scribed to by others; and therefore if he also be a just man, he will not impose upon others; for it is best every man should be left in that liberty from which no man can justly take him, unless he could secure him from error. So that here also there is a necessity to conserve the liberty of prophesying, and interpreting Scripture; a ne∣cessity derived from the consideration of the dif∣ficulty of Scripture in questions controverted, and the uncertainty of any internal medium of interpretation.</Q>
<P>Now if this be the case, we are but mocked, when we are told the Scriptures are the "repository of divine truths;" or that <HI>any</HI> articles of faith
<PB N="391" REF="404"/>
can be "clearly and plainly set down" in any Creed whatsoever. Under the above circumstances, in what formulary, or system, shall we look for <Q>all that which is of simple and prime necessity?</Q> Is it not strange too, that there should be <HI>many other mysteries</HI> in Scripture distinct from those <HI>divine truths</HI> of which it is the repository; and stranger still, that matters of <HI>question</HI> should be put under a <HI>vail?</HI> Upon all matters of <HI>faith</HI> there is indeed a vail; I mean, upon all mysterious matters, which cannot possibly be "apprehended at the best ad∣vantage of expression." The explication of <HI>these</HI> is absolutely impracticable; and every attempt for that purpose, <Q>by reason of our imperfections, must needs be dark, sometimes weak, sometimes unintelligible.</Q> Perhaps he will bid as fair as any man to be an expounder of mysteries who shall disentangle the several clauses of this paragraph.

<P>The truth of the matter is, that very sensible and very good men, are apt to run into inconsistencies upon this subject. <Q>It is very meet, says Dr. <HI>Potter</HI> in his answer to <HI>Char. Mistaken,</HI> that the igno∣rant people should <HI>obey their overseers in the Lord,</HI>

To which purpose they are commanded to <HI>search the Scriptures,</HI> that they may <HI>grow and increase in knowlege,</HI> &amp;c, and that they may be able both to <HI>believe with the heart, and confess with their mouth,</HI> and render a <HI>reason</HI> of that <HI>hope</HI> that is in them.</Q></P>

the title of <HI>Free Thoughts on the subject of a farther Reformation,</HI> speaks of our Reformers in the fol∣lowing terms. <Q>One no small disadvantage which they unhappily laboured under, and which from their time to this has been matter of just regret to true friends of <HI>Divine Revelation,</HI> was their <HI>defect</HI> of knowlege in sacred matters, above all in the <HI>true sense of Scripture,</HI> &amp;c. If (says he in another place) we would form our judgments of the abilities of our Reformers to frame for us a system of doctrines which should remain a per∣petual standard of belief and profession in the <HI>English</HI> Church, and by which all our Clergy in all future ages should be summarily concluded, we shall, I suppose, see just reason to wish that they had been more equal than they appear to be, to so weighty an undertaking. Those who are well acquainted with their writings will see, in a variety of instances, evident marks of their insuf∣ficiency for such a task; and be fully convinced of the truth of that observation of a learned and worthy Doctor of our Church, that they were but <HI>bad interpreters</HI> of the Scriptures.</Q></P>
<P>In support of all this derogation, which is oblig∣ingly qualified with a few introductory common∣place compliments, our author has given us a number of extracts, relative to certain religious topics, from Arch-Bishop <HI>Cranmer</HI>'s Catechism, pub∣lished in 1543, and dedicated to King <HI>Edward</HI> VI.
<PB N="394" REF="407"/>
We may see, it seems, from these extracts, how greatly disproportioned the abilities of this famous Prelate and his colleagues were to the work of Re∣formation, &amp;c. To what conclusions this will lead, I need not inform the reader. But I take leave to offer a remark or two upon the occasion. In the first place, if the intellectual weakness of our Re∣formers was really so great as is here represented, Protestants to a man have reason enough to be ashamed of themselves. What answer shall they make to any sensible <HI>Roman-Catholic</HI> who should teaze them with these mortifying truths? To my thinking, as none of the exceptionable contents of the passages cited from the Arch-Bishop's Cate∣chism make a part of the doctrine of our Church, they might, in reverence to <HI>his</HI> memory, and for <HI>her</HI> credit, have much better been suppressed. Had this Gentleman contented himself with observing, that the Reformers of the Church were fallible men; and consequently, that the Forms and Offices they have delivered down to us may be capable, in some instances, of alteration and improvement, he had spoken more agreeably to truth, though less adequately to his purpose. For what he has alledged has a plain tendency to shew the necessity rather of <HI>pulling down</HI> than <HI>repairing</HI> our spiritual <HI>building.</HI> On the whole, as he has conducted mat∣ters, I know not any one person upon earth under so many obligations to him as the Pope of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="408"/>
I shall take this opportunity to animadvert on certain dirty aspersions in a late performance from the hand of a rigid non-conformist, and perhaps an avowed unbeliever, and perhaps both.</P>
<P>The anonymous editor of Dr. <HI>Johnson</HI>'s Life of Dr. <HI>I. Watts</HI> with Notes, sacrifices to the virulence of his diposition every regard to decency, charity, and truth. It will be proper to trace this calumny to it's source. <Q>Happy, says the celebrated Biogra∣pher, will be that reader (viz. of the works of Dr. <HI>W.)</HI> whose mind is disposed by his verses or his prose, to imitate him in all but his Non-con∣formity, to copy his benevolence to man, and his reverence to God.</Q> Is there any thing in this to put a man of candour, or a man of sense out of humour? Yet our Editor asks, <Q>is not this ex∣ception, and even the mention of this circum∣stance, a striking proof of Dr. <HI>Johnson</HI>'s bigotted attachment to the national established mode of worship?</Q> It is really no proof at all. How far Dr. <HI>J.</HI> was in fact a bigot to establishments, I un∣dertake not to determine; but the period just quoted by no means proves him to have been so. The most moderate Churchman breathing has not the better opinion of Dr. <HI>W.</HI> for his Non-conformity. I cannot think such an one could have "mentioned this circumstance" more tenderly, had he mentioned it at all; and with what propriety Dr. <HI>W</HI>—'s Bio∣grapher could have left it unmentioned, I must
<PB N="396" REF="409"/>
leave it to this Gentleman to explain to us. <Q>Re∣verence to God, he proceeds, and benevolence to man, are the two grand essentials of religion. He that possesses these is a true Christian, what∣ever be the external mode of worship which he adopts. Neither his Conformity nor his Non∣conformity will exclude him from the divine fa∣vour, nor ought it to be matter of censure to his fellow-creatures. If a man in uniting with any Christian community, appears to follow the dictates of his own conscience, &amp;c, he deserves the esteem of all parties, and to object to his peculiarity of religious profession is the mark of a little mind.</Q></P>
<P>Now this is partly true, partly false, but, you see, as far as Dr. <HI>Johnson</HI> is concerned, wholly im∣pertinent. There is as little as possible of censure, or of objection in the sentence above quoted from him. As to sincerity of persuasion, no body de∣nies the validity of it's pretensions; but at the same time what will make an honest man will by no means constitute a "true Christian." <Q>Reverence to God and benevolence to man are indeed the two grand essentials of all religion;</Q> and, to bor∣row our author's term, they MAY be <HI>possest</HI> by Jews, Turks, Infidels, and Heretics.</P>
<P>"That Dr. <HI>W.</HI> was conscientious in his Non-con∣formity," will be readily admitted; but surely this will not justify the unfairness, or the duplicity,
<PB N="397" REF="410"/>
or the malignity, or the falshood of the following paragraph. <Q>Considering what the terms of mi∣nisterial conformity are, says our annotator, it may be justly questioned, whether if all the clergy were equally conscientious, one half of them would not be Dissenters. To declare an <HI>assent and consent</HI> to ALL and EVERY THING <HI>contained in the Thirty-nine Articles, the book of Common Prayer,</HI> &amp;c, (which comprehend such a prodigious num∣ber of particulars; many of them very disputable, some of them unintelligible, and others exploded by the wisest and best of men;) is such a requi∣sition as it is hard to be conceived the generality of the clergy can <HI>bona fide</HI> approve. It is indeed WELL KNOWN that MOST of them, and even of the BISHOPS themselves, disbelieve some of the doctrinal articles of the Church, as appears from the general strain of their preaching and of their writings, and that they profess to subscribe them only as articles of peace. If the terms of conformity were a declaration that they <HI>did not believe</HI> "all and every thing, &amp;c," it is unde∣niable that many (not to say the most) of those that conform might very conscientiously make it. Whether therefore their subscription to the pre∣sent terms be consistent with simplicity and godly sincerity, it behoves them seriously to enquire. If others think that such a subscription would, in them, be a gross prevarication, and rather than
<PB N="398" REF="411"/>
be chargeable with it, willingly forego the ad∣vantages of being in the Church, they ought at least to be respected as honest men. And if Dr. <HI>Johnson</HI> had studied the grounds of Non-con∣formity (which he appears not to have done) he might have entertained a better opinion of the understandings of Protestant Dissenters as well as their integrity. But this is not the place for entering into that controversy.</Q></P>
<P>If these representations are just, and these asser∣tions true, the controversy is absolutely decided with a vengeance; and the bulk of the clergy of of the Church of <HI>England</HI> are as great a set of sc—ndr—ls as can be produced in the annals of the human race. I shall not waste a moment in vindicating them from imputations so palpably scandalous; but content myself with declaring my firm belief, that Dr <HI>Johnson</HI> would not <Q>have en∣tertained a better opinion either of the under∣standings or integrity of Protestant Dissenters</Q> from these samples of BOTH; and that were Dr. <HI>W.</HI> restored to life, he would, for visible reasons, think himself under much greater obligations to the Bio∣grapher than to the Annotator.</P>
<P>In short, we are not to wonder at any thing which is advanced by one who maintains, as this writer does in another page of this very perform∣ance, that <Q>in the Scripture-plan no traces of a national Church, or ecclesiastical authority, are to be found.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="412"/>
It may be pertinent to remark farther, that <HI>ex∣ceedingly mad</HI> as the Puritans and their friends in the last century were <HI>against</HI> the governors of the Church, and our whole ecclesiastical polity, THEY appear to have been more than ordinarily solicitous to express their full <HI>assent</HI> and <HI>consent</HI> to the most material articles of our faith. Their <HI>quarrel</HI> was not <HI>against</HI> our doctrine but our discipline. I have by me a just and literal translation of the <HI>Confession of Faith,</HI> together with two <HI>Catechisms,</HI> a larger and a less, drawn up by the <HI>Assembly of Divines at Westminster,</HI> in 1651, under the authority, and with the concurrence and approbation of Parliament, (so called,) and of the Kirk of <HI>Scotland.</HI> The 3d clause in the ch. <HI>de Deo et Sacro-sancta Trinitate</HI> runs <HI>verbatim</HI> as follows. <Q>In Deitatis unitate personae tres sunt unius ejusdemque essentiae, potentiae, ac aeternitatis; Deus Pater, Deus Filius, ac Deus Spiritus Sanc∣tus. Pater quidem a nullo est, nec genitus nempe nec procedens: Filius autem a Patre est aeterne genitus: Spiritus autem Sanctus aeterne procedens a Patre Filioque.</Q> In the 23d ch. <HI>de statu hominum post mortem, deque resurrectione mor∣tuorum,</HI> we find this clause: <Q>Novissimo illo die, qui comperientur in vivis non morientur quidem sed mutabuntur; qui mortui fuerint resuscita∣buntur omnes, ipsissimis iis corporibus quibus viventes aliquando fungebantur, ac non aliis, ut
<PB N="400" REF="413"/>
ut qualitate differentibus; quae denuo animabus quaeque suis aeterno conjugio unientur.</Q></P>
<P>These doctrines are held out almost in the same words in both <HI>Catechisms.</HI></P>
<P>From which circumstances I take occasion to ask, whether, as far as we may reasonably collect from the style and the sentiments of the Editor of Dr. <HI>Johnson</HI>'s Life of Dr. <HI>I. Watts</HI> with Notes, the views and the dispositions of the Protestant Dis∣senters of this age have not a tendency more ini∣mical and destructive, than were those of these same Ancestors of theirs who "triumphed in the ruin" both of Church and State?</P>
<P>But is there not after all an inveterate difficulty, which we have rather met than encountered, and much less overcome, and which furnishes Popery with its shrewdest argument, and Infidelity with its strongest handle? The protestant principle asserts the right of private judgment in matters of reli∣gion. And yet precepts relative to obedience to spiritual authority, &amp;c, are as plain as those direc∣tions which require us to <HI>prove all things, and to hold fast that which is good,</HI> &amp;c. How shall we reconcile these things? In consequence of the ex∣ertion of this personal right, differences arise in the world, and controversies, the natural issue of them. How are these to be decided? Is it not a solecism in religion to suppose a controversy with∣out a judge? Nevertheless we say, and demon∣strate
<PB N="401" REF="414"/>
too, that the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> the only Church which pretends to infallibility, has erred, and that even in fundamentals. Accordingly we refer to no arbitration; we acknowlege no rule of faith, no judge of controversy but Holy Scripture. <HI>Supremus judex</HI> (say the <HI>Westminster</HI> Divines above∣mentioned) <HI>a quo omnes de religione controversiae sunt determinandae, omnia conciliorum decreta, opiniones, &amp;c, nullus alius esse potest praeter Spiritum Sanctum in Scriptura pronunciantem.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Confess Fid. Cap. 1. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>But are not these <HI>vain words?</HI> Doth any man, or any body of men pretend to the <HI>gift of discerning of Spirits</HI> at this day? Or if they do, are their pre∣tensions admissible? Or can Scripture, with any propriety, be said to be the judge of controversy, when it is the whole and sole ground of it? Do not all parties find means to wrench the authority of the sacred pages to their side? Every <HI>Anti-tri∣nitarian</HI> will say, in the words of <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> (whatever the real sentiments of the latter might be,) <Q>Propose me any thing out of this Book, and require whether I believe or no, and seem it never so incomprehensible to human reason, I will subscribe it with hand and heart, as know∣ing no Demonstration can be stronger than this, God hath said so, therefore it is true.</Q> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Religion of Protestants &amp;c. p. 335.</NOTE>But then to the proofs you have to offer, and the texts
<PB N="402" REF="415"/>
you have to produce, he opposes his texts, and his proofs, such as they are; or perhaps one general assertion, which no body can deny, <HI>viz.</HI> that there is but "one living and true God." Where now is the judge of controversy? What is become of ec∣clesiastical authority? Or what have we to say to those who <HI>cast</HI> it <HI>in our teeth,</HI> that the Church of <HI>England</HI> hath erred as well as the Church of <HI>Rome?</HI> In short, where is heresy? And what is schism?</P>
<P>With a view to the solution of this difficulty, and by way of Supplement to the contents of the foregoing sheets, let us see whether a little enquiry will not enable us sufficiently to ascertain what he∣resy of the worst sort was in the days of the Apostles themselves, and according to the conception they must by fair construction be understood to have entertained of it.</P>
<P>In his 2d general Epistle St. <HI>Peter</HI> foretells that there would be <HI>false teachers</HI> among Christians, <HI>who</HI> should <HI>privily bring in damnable heresies,</HI> EVEN <HI>de∣nying the Lord that bought them.</HI> (ch. 2. v. 1.) From which passage we can do no less than infer, that the denial of the <HI>Lord that bought</HI> us is of all <HI>he∣resies</HI> the most <HI>damnable.</HI></P>
<P>Now whether we do, or do not abide by Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI>'s interpretation, who apprehends we are to understand God the Father by the word <HI>Lord</HI> in this passage, <Q>Christ being never styled <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (the original word) in the New Testament,</Q> the in∣ference
<PB N="403" REF="416"/>
will inevitably be one and the same. <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> was confessedly the purchaser of the <HI>Church with his own blood.</HI> In point of nature, or attribute, there can therefore be no difference betwixt these two Persons; the heresy which denies either will be equally damnable, according to Dr. <HI>W</HI>'s senti∣ment. But if we reject it, the Divinity of our Sa∣viour is not less implied in the text before us. For in most evident allusion to this very purchase, <HI>Ye are bought with a price,</HI> says St. <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Corin∣thians; therefore,</HI> continues he, <HI>glorify God,</HI> i. e., out of all question, <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> who <HI>bought</HI> you, <HI>in your body and in your Spirit,</HI> which are God's; i. e., which are Christ's. (1 Cor. 6. 20.) It may be a satisfaction to the reader to compare this passage with the following in the next Chapter. <HI>He that is called being free, is Christ's servant. Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.</HI> (v. 22, &amp;c.)</P>
<P>In his last and farewell address to the <HI>Children of Israel,</HI> which is called his <HI>Song,</HI> their great Legi∣slator puts this question to them, <HI>is not he thy father that hath bought thee?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deutero. Ch. 32. 6.</NOTE>God is said to have <HI>bought</HI> his people by his deliverance of them from the <HI>bondage of Aegypt;</HI> which was only a type, but indisputably a type of the <HI>eternal redemption obtained for us</HI> by the precious blood of <HI>Christ.</HI> And is it
<PB N="404" REF="417"/>
not just to infer the equality of these Divine pur∣chasers from the nature and value of their respec∣tive purchases? The denial of the <HI>Lord that bought</HI> us is therefore in effect the denial of the Divinity of our Saviour.</P>
<P>There is a passage in St. <HI>Jude,</HI> parallel to this which we have had in consideration, that will not be found consistent with it, or with its context, without supposing the same equality. This Apostle complains of certain <HI>ungodly men,</HI> who <HI>denied the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> They <HI>denied our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> as one with the Father, not as in essence distinct from him. I say, the affi∣nity of this passage to the other, and its own con∣text, not barely warrant, but demand this sense. <HI>Jude the Servant of Jesus Christ, &amp;c, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved</HI> BY <HI>Jesus Christ, and called.</HI> We are very sufficiently authorised to read <HI>by</HI> for <HI>in,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hammond, &amp;c, &amp;c.</NOTE>in this passage; and if so, it is most undoubtedly as much the attribute, or property of the Supreme God to <HI>preserve,</HI> and to <HI>call,</HI> as it is to <HI>sanctify;</HI> which indeed is the dis∣criminative office of the Holy Ghost: whose Divi∣nity, by the way, is here plainly asserted by implica∣tion. But we are under no necessity of disturbing the present version. In the 3d verse, the Apostle exhorts Christians to <HI>contend earnestly for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints.</HI> That from the beginning some should <HI>depart from the</HI> faith, or
<PB N="405" REF="418"/>
a belief in <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as the <HI>Son of God</HI> by eternal generation, on principles, and for reasons, by which infidels and sceptics are influenced at this day, is by no means matter of astonishment. But supposing the faith of the primitive Christians, the <HI>faith which was once delivered unto the Saints,</HI> to have been merely a faith in <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> as a <HI>prophet,</HI> or as the <HI>Messiah,</HI> or as a <HI>creature</HI> of a more or less <HI>excellent name,</HI> there would, I presume, have been little room for <HI>contention</HI> about it, or danger of its being <HI>denied.</HI></P>
<P>If we take into examination that impious and strange doctrine of which St. <HI>John</HI> speaks in terms of strong censure and resentment, in his <HI>first</HI> and <HI>second general Epistle,</HI> this research will likewise ter∣minate in an unquestionable proof of our Lord's Divinity; and convince us, that in the denial of it the error consisted. <HI>Every Spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God: and this is that Spirit of anti-christ, whereof ye have heard, &amp;c. Many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an anti-christ.</HI> (1 John. 4. v. 3. 2 John. v. 7.) Or, as some read these passages, <HI>that confess not Jesus Christ which is come in the flesh.</HI> The import of these texts will not be in the least affected by this variation. That the <HI>man Christ Jesus,</HI> the person who was known by the name of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> lived and conversed in the world, did <HI>many won∣derful</HI>
<PB N="406" REF="419"/>
<HI>works,</HI> was contumeliously treated, and at length put to a painful and ignominious death, were facts too recent, and too generally known, to be disputed by any at the time when our Apostle wrote these Epistles. That the <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> of these Epistles was the very identical person whom the Apostle styles in his Gospel the <HI>Son of God,</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> that <HI>was in the beginning with God,</HI> and really and truly <HI>was God,</HI> cannot with the least appear∣ance of reason be questioned. But that <HI>God</HI> was indeed <HI>manifest in the flesh,</HI> took our nature upon him, and <HI>bare our sins in his own body on the tree,</HI> this was a <HI>saying</HI> too <HI>hard</HI> for the acceptation of those <HI>deceivers, false prophets,</HI> and <HI>anti-christs,</HI> as St. <HI>John</HI> calls them, and whom, at the 6th v. of Chap. 4. he represents as possest with the <HI>spirit of error.</HI> Accordingly they were weak, and at the same time bold enough to resolve this great truth into mere semblance and deception; and to affirm that the hu∣man person of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> was a phantom, and lived, and suffered, and died, not really, but in appear∣ance only: which abominably ridiculous notion was, as has been observed, in a great measure adopted afterwards by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who was offended at those indignities and sufferings which he consi∣dered as altogether unworthy of that prophetic character which he acknowleged <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as his predecessor, to have been vested with. This doctrine is delivered in the <HI>Koran</HI> in general terms; but the
<PB N="407" REF="420"/>
followers of <HI>Mahomet</HI> differ in their sentiments re∣specting it. According to some, <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> was not nailed to the Cross, but a malefactor who in person much resembled him. The person crucified, say others, was <Q>a spy that was sent to intrap our Saviour;</Q> and others assert him to have been <HI>Judas;</HI> and others, <HI>Simon the Cyrenian.</HI></P>
<P>Or if we suppose St. <HI>John</HI> to have had in his eye another heretical tenet of a similar nature and ten∣dency, which was very early disseminated in the Church, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the <HI>Carpocratians,</HI> &amp;c, who made a distinction betwixt <HI>Jesus</HI> and <HI>Christ;</HI> and maintained, that the former suffered, and rose again, but that the latter was impassible, as being purely of a spiritual nature; (agreeably to the idea suggested by <HI>Webster</HI>'s translation of Father <HI>Simon,</HI> which for <HI>every Spirit which confesseth not,</HI> &amp;c, reads which <HI>separateth Jesus;)</HI> the result will necessarily be found to be one and the same. For to what can we reasonably attribute the denial of our Lord's humanity, or its separation from the divinity, but to an averseness to acknowlege the union of God and Man in the person of <HI>Jesus Christ?</HI> And if so, it will naturally follow that this union was the doctrine of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and the belief of the pri∣mitive Church.</P>
<P>It is well worth observing, that <HI>Polycarp,</HI> in his Epistle to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> quotes word for word the 3d v. of the 4th Ch. of St. <HI>John</HI>'s first Epistle,
<PB N="408" REF="421"/>
<HI>Whosoever does not confess</HI> &amp;c; and that <HI>Ignatius,</HI> who conversed with the Apostles, and, upon the death of <HI>Evodius</HI> was appointed Bishop of <HI>Antioch</HI> by as many of the sacred College as were then living, not barely mentions, but most expressly censures and condemns this whimsical opinion of the <HI>Phantomists,</HI> if I may take liberty so to call them. <Q>Stop your ears, says he, in his Epistle to the <HI>Trallians,</HI> as often as any one shall speak con∣trary to <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> who was of the race of <HI>David,</HI> &amp;c; who was truly born, and did eat and drink; was truly persecuted under <HI>Pontius Pilate;</HI> was truly crucified, and dead.</Q> And a little after, if, says he, <Q>some who are Atheists, that is to say Infidels, pretend that he only SEEMED to suffer, (they themselves only seeming to exist,) why then am I bound? Why do I desire to fight with beasts?</Q> In the Epistle of the same Father to the <HI>Smyrnaeans,</HI> we have the following passage. <Q>And he suffered truly, as he also truly raised up himself; and not, as some unbelievers say, that he only SEEMED to suffer.</Q></P>
<P>Though therefore neither the Apostles, nor the Apostolical Fathers particularly specify what he∣resy is, it appears by just and natural inference from many passages in their writings originally to have consisted in denying the perfect Godhead, and perfect manhood of our Saviour; and that heresies in general deserve to be considered as so many eva∣sions
<PB N="409" REF="422"/>
of these fundamental truths. There is another passage in the Epistle to the <HI>Trallians</HI> which, simply asserting the Divinity of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> puts this out of all reasonable doubt. <Q>I exhort you, says the venerable Author, or rather not I, but the love of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> that you use none but Christian nourishment; abstaining from pasture which is of another kind, I mean heresy. <HI>For</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the references in the Margin.</NOTE><HI>they that are heretics confound together the doctrine of Jesus Christ</HI> with their own poison, &amp;c. Wherefore guard yourselves against such persons. And that you will do if you are not puffed up, but con∣tinue inseparable from <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our GOD, and from your Bishop, and from the commands of the Apostles.</Q> In short, all these circumstances concur to the establishment of our first Hypothesis. If the Catholic faith of the primitive Christians was the same which is held in the Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> at this day, at and before the publication of the Holy Scriptures of the New Testament, as well as the writings of the Apostolical Fathers, their doc∣trine on the subjects we have been handling is suffi∣ciently uniform and explicit; if otherwise, it is by far too consistent, and too perspicuous.</P>
<P>Agreeably to what has been advanced, we may farther observe the sacred authors frequently refer∣ring to some standing doctrines, some capital arti∣cles
<PB N="410" REF="423"/>
of belief, which had been by them taught, and were by the Church universally received. It will be a hard matter to comprehend the meaning of many passages in the Scriptures, without sup∣posing them to import, or to allude to some such doctrines or principles. The first converts to Chris∣tianity are said to have <HI>continued stedfastly in the Apostles, doctrine and fellowship;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 42.</NOTE>and whatsoever that doctrine might be, it was then no WRITTEN doctrine. St. <HI>Paul</HI> thanks God, that the <HI>Roman</HI> con∣verts had <HI>obeyed from the heart that</HI> FORM OF DOC∣TRINE <HI>which was delivered to them.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 17.</NOTE>He exhorts the <HI>Thessalonians to stand fast, and hold the</HI> TRADI∣TIONS which <HI>they had been taught, whether by word, or by</HI> his <HI>Epistle;</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Thess. ii. 15.</NOTE>and recommends it to <HI>Timothy,</HI> to <HI>keep that which was committed to his trust;</HI> and to <HI>hold fast the</HI> FORM <HI>of sound words which he had heard of</HI> him. <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. i. 13.</NOTE>He injoins <HI>Titus</HI> to <HI>reject a man that is an heretic, after the first and second admoni∣tion.</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Titus iii. 10.</NOTE>It will be sufficient to add to this the ad∣vice of St. <HI>Jude</HI> to Christians in general, which just above fell under notice, <HI>viz.</HI> that they should <HI>earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints.</HI></P>
<P>It was doubtless with an eye to this <HI>faith,</HI> to the preservation of the same in purity, and to the fu∣ture peace and prosperity of the Church, that <HI>Jesus</HI>
<PB N="411" REF="424"/>
<HI>Christ gave some, Apostles;</HI> as St. <HI>Paul</HI> informs us; <HI>and some, Evangelists; and some, Prophets; and some, Pastors and Teachers:</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ephes. iv. 11.</NOTE>nor could the purpose of such appointments have been answered but by a regular succession of some of these characters through all ages.</P>
<P>For the same purpose most unquestionably, <HI>God hath set in the Church, helps, and governments,</HI> &amp;c, as the same Apostle declares to his <HI>Corinthian</HI> con∣verts in the 12th Chapter of his first Epistle to them.</P>
<P>Now how all this could be done; or how either <HI>Evangelist, Prophet,</HI> or <HI>Teacher,</HI> or Governor could at <HI>any</HI> time, or in <HI>any</HI> manner, exercise his function, without invading the right of private judgment, as it has of late days been contended for; or with∣out departing from the <HI>simplicity</HI> of the Gospel in its original state, I pretend not to have sufficient penetration to discover.</P>
<P>Matters appear then to stand thus.—That <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> constituted no arbitrator, no infallible judge, or decider of controversy, &amp;c, in his Church, is demonstrable from the differences, the disputes, and dissentions, relative to <HI>circumcision,</HI> &amp;c, which subsisted in its very infancy. At the same time it is certain the Holy Scriptures speak of a <HI>common faith, and of the common salvation.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Titus i. 4. Jude v. 3.</NOTE>You have seen

what grounds we have for our persuasion that such <HI>common faith</HI> was nothing more or less than a be∣lief in the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, and the other articles contained in our Creeds. Under this persuasion, the Church of England, as a national Church, as a Church reformed from the gross errors, corruptions, and superstitions of <HI>Rome,</HI> has not only "power to decree rites, or ceremonies, but authority in controversies of faith;" <HI>viz.</HI> au∣thority, not to determine, but to declare. Accord∣ingly we do not anathematise, or molest them that renounce our Doctrine, or separate from our Dis∣cipline, upon principles avowed by ourselves. We maintain our own rights without encroaching upon the privileges of others. We "discover, condemn, and avoid" what we call and believe to be heresies, without aiming, or wishing to prevent them by coercion. We conceive spiritual government to be as compatible with religious liberty, as temporal jurisdiction is with civil; and that when the Re∣formers asserted the right of private judgment in matters of religion, the natural right of all men to make use of their own faculties, <Q>they could not possibly mean to invest every individual with the privilege of working out his own salvation by his own understanding and endeavours,</Q> inde∣pendently on any extraneous assistance, or instruc∣tion whatever; and much less to intimate, that he
<PB N="413" REF="428"/>
is under an indispensable obligation so to do. Were this the case, the Apostle's question, <HI>are all Teachers</HI> must be answered in the affirma∣tive; and the necessary consequence would be, that EVERY BODY, and yet NO BODY would be a <HI>Teacher.</HI> Which is absurd. Neither the justest claim, nor the most reasonable exemption can alter the nature of things. If it be true, that this Church derives her existence from the exertions of human reason, emancipating itself from spiritual slavery; it is as true, that she owes her preserva∣tion to decent order, and legal establishment. If it be true, that the bulk of the people naturally wish to act, to think, and to judge for themselves; it is as true, that they naturally take advice or in∣struction from others, submit to controul, and re∣verence authority. In short, to whatever causes we are to ascribe that diversity of opinion which dis∣tracts the world; how perplexing so ever the pre∣sent constitution of things may be; or for what∣ever reasons it has pleased infinite wisdom to place us in a state of trial, infirmity, and imperfection; one general truth must universally be subscribed to; <HI>viz.</HI> that, with respect both to faith and prac∣tice, <HI>the Lord knoweth them that are his,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 19.</NOTE>and will hereafter acknowlege them accordingly.</P>

<P>P. S. It is needless to tell the sensible reader, that I have not been professedly contending with any of the latitudinarian writers whose works are incidentally quoted, or referred to, in the progress of these Discourses and Annotations. If what has herein been offered be sufficiently solid and sa∣tisfactory, they are severally replied to, though not in form, yet in effect.</P>
