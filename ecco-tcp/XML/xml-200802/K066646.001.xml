<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS soon as I had determined to lay before the public the ensuing Sketches, I could not hesitate in choos∣ing whose name I should wish might honour the introduction of them into the world—To whom could a work of this nature, with so much propri∣ety be addressed, as to him who had not only relinquished, for a series of years, all the allurements that a po∣lished nation could display to opu∣lence and early age, but had exposed
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
himself to numberless perils, and the repeated risk of life itself, that he might attain higher degrees of that knowledge, which these sketches are intended to commemorate, in his pre∣decessors and countrymen; and as the result of which, he has enlarged the stock of natural science, beyond all prior example?</P>
<P>That liberality, Sir, with which you impart the fruit of your various labours, and that distinguished pa∣tronage you so amply afford to natu∣ral history at large, and to botanical science in particular, as they demand, so have they justly secured to you, the grateful acknowledgments of all lovers of that science, and of litera∣ture, and philosophy in general.</P>
<P>I have, Sir, on this occasion only to regret, that my distant situation has not allowed me, in the compilation of these pages, those benefits which your most extensive and valuable li∣brary would have held forth to me;
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
and of which, you so generously per∣mit the communication, to such as desire to avail themselves of its advan∣tages.</P>
<P>Permit me then, Sir, to have the honour of inscribing to you the fol∣lowing SKETCHES, as to an eminent, and no less candid judge of the sub∣ject: and, as a public testimony of that most perfect respect and esteem, with which I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your much obliged, and Most obedient humble Servant, RICHARD PULTENEY.</SIGNED>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the enlightened ages of Greece and Rome, and under the most flourishing state of Arabian literature, Botany, as a science, had no existence. Nor was it till some time after the revival of learning, that those combinations and distinctions were effectually discovered, which, in the end, by giving rise to system, have raised the study of plants, to that rank it holds at present in the scale of knowledge.</P>
<P>If in the contemplation of flowers, man∣kind at large, have in every age placed one of their purest pleasures, how greatly must these delights be enhanced to the enamoured votary of Botanical Knowledge! who, whilst he surveys that wonderfully varied elegance and beauty, which charm the eye of all, penetrates still farther, and at the same in∣stant, discerns also, those analogies and dis∣criminations,
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
in the <HI>number, figure, situation,</HI> and <HI>proportion</HI> of parts, on which are laid the foundations of modern Botanical Science; associations and distinctions, which are veil∣ed from the untaught eye of common ob∣servation, howsoever sensible to the general beauties of Nature! And hence, indepen∣dently of its real and ultimate utility, from the accession of knowledge it brings to the Materia Medica, and by its general assistance to the various arts and elegancies of life, the study of the vegetable kingdom, has prov∣ed, to numerous speculative and inquisitive minds, the source of much intellectual en∣joyment.</P>
<P>This Science is, by many, considered as of so easy attainment, that it is not unusual to assign the name of Botanist, to any man whose memory enables him to repeat the nomenclature of perhaps a few hundred plants; howsoever uninformed he may be, of those principles which entitle him, to the real name and character: With equal jus∣tice might any man who knows the names only of the parts of a complex machine, assume to himself that fame which is due
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
solely to the inventor of it. By this de∣grading idea, men of the first learning and talents in this branch of knowledge, have frequently been levelled with the most su∣perficial enquirers, and the most ignorant pretenders. Hence also this Science, which even in a speculative view, holds no mean rank, and, considered practically, is closely connected with medicine, and with the arts and elegancies of life, has been held forth as a trifling and futile employment. In truth, he properly is entitled, in any degree, to the character of the Botanist, whose ac∣quirements enable him to investigate, to de∣scribe, and systematically arrange, any plant which comes under his cognizance. But to these abilities, in order to compleat the character, should be united, an acquaintance with the Philosophy of Vegetables, and with the History of the Science, in all its several relations, both literary and practical, from remote antiquity to his own time: at∣tainments which require a competent share of general learning, and no small degree of painful toil and patient industry, both in the fields and in the closet.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9"/>
If this description of the Botanist be a true one, it manifestly excludes a number of frivolous pretenders; the science itself rises in importance, and admits of great di∣versity of employment, to the taste, the ta∣lents, and learning of those who direct their attention to it. Whilst then it is the pro∣vince of some to investigate new subjects, to ascertain those imperfectly known, and to record the various improvements and dis∣coveries of the day, let it be that of others, to do justice to departed merit, to recall the scattered remembrances of the lives, and hold out the example of those who have labour∣ed in the same field before them.</P>
<P>In tracing the progress of human know∣ledge through its several gradations of im∣provement, it is scarcely possible for an in∣quisitive and liberal mind, of congenial taste, not to feel an ardent wish of information relating to those persons by whom such im∣provements have severally been given: and hence arises that interesting sympathy which almost inseparably connects biography with the history of each respective branch of knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
In this age, when successful advance∣ments in the study of plants, have so far extended its pleasures, as to render Botany almost fashionable; and at a time, when Biographical writings find a reception here∣tofore unknown; it became matter of spe∣culation, that no one should have delineated the <HI>Rise and Progress of Botany in Britain,</HI> in connexion with the lives of those who have contributed to amplify and embellish it.</P>
<P>Among the various enquiries which em∣ploy the pens of the learned, none perhaps afford more general satisfaction, than such as relate to the origin and progress of science and literature. But when these lead to ob∣jects which we love and cherish, they come recommended by a charm that secures a welcome, and thus promise a more peculiar entertainment and gratification: however, disquisitions of this kind are of difficult ex∣ecution, especially when applied to subjects of a scientific nature, as requiring the union of various talents in the writer—an appro∣priate share of learning, an extensive literary as well as practical acquaintance with the subject, united to all those qualifications re∣quisite
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
in a biographer, such as diligence and accuracy in investigating the discoveries of his authors, and impartiality in characteriz∣ing them, and in assigning to each his due degree of merit. To these personal requisites must be added, the adventitious circum∣stances of a situation favourable to his re∣searches, not only from manuscripts, and large libraries, but from actual intercourse with the learned.</P>
<P>Fully sensible in this view of the little claim I have to the character and advan∣tages here spoken of, it becomes necessary, to avoid the censure of temerity, that I should premise some account of the original occasion of this attempt.</P>
<P>The attention I had given to English Bo∣tany in my younger days, had prompted me, at one time, to plan a <HI>Flora</HI> of the plants of this kingdom, on an extensive scale; including, besides the medical and oecono∣mical history of each, a <HI>Pinax,</HI> in which it was my design to have distinguished, as far as I was able, the first discoverer of each species, both among foreign writers and those of our own kingdom; and to have
<PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>
arranged all their synonyms, at large, under each plant, in chronological order. To such a work the following <HI>sketches,</HI> in a somewhat more contracted form, were in∣tended as an introduction. In the mean time, if more important avocations had not, the want of necessary assistance from books, would probably have stopped the progress of a plan of such extent. Although this purpose was relinquished, yet, as the mate∣rials were collected, and this part of the design was independent of the other, I flat∣tered myself, that, having made some al∣terations, and enlarged the whole, under so total a want of any similar work, these anec∣dotes might afford information to young Botanists, and possibly some amusement to those of more advanced knowledge in the science.</P>
<P>Although botanical writings are the prin∣cipal objects of these pages, yet, as several of these authors were conspicuous for their various attainments in different branches of literature, their other pursuits and publica∣tions, where my resources have afforded opportunity, have occasionally been recited;
<PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>
and I have been more particularly solicitous to collect into one view, under each author, those various temporary and occasional pro∣ductions, which, after the establishment of the Royal Society, were communicated to that body, and form a part of the <HI>Philoso∣phical Transactions.</HI></P>
<P>In considering the botanical writings, especially those of the first eminence, I have had recourse, with few exceptions, to the books themselves; but, confined to a pri∣vate collection, have yet too frequently had occasion to regret the want of more exten∣sive assistance; and, although I have not formally quoted my authorities, on every occasion, they will be sufficiently manifest to all such as are conversant in botanical li∣terature. In the historical and biographical parts, the most material and authentic facts, have likewise been derived from the respec∣tive authors in botany: and, not unfrequent∣ly, I have availed myself of several of the older periodical publications. Exclusively of these, besides collateral assistance received from separate works, and from various col∣lections of smaller bulk, I more especially

<P>In a work intended to exhibit the pro∣gress of the science in <HI>England,</HI> and to as∣sign to each writer his respective praise, I could have wished to have subjoined a com∣plete

catalogue of all the English plants, with the names of the first discoverer an∣nexed; or of that author in whose work each first occurs, as an English species. The progress I had made in the intended Pinax above-mentioned, would have enabled me to have made this addition; but, as such a catalogue could have afforded gratification only to the more curious and critical bota∣nists, unless thrown into a form, by the addi∣tion of other matter, which would have in∣creased the bulk of this work to another vo∣lume, it was judged most proper to omit it.</P>
<P>Conscious of the many defects attending these <HI>sketches,</HI> and fully sensible that they merit no higher appellation than what the title imports, it is with much deference, even under that idea, that I submit them to the inspection of the literary world; and, per∣haps, the indulgence they require, is great∣er than ought to be expected: but I am willing to hope, that they will find that reception from learned and candid judges, which such are wont to bestow on a first essay, in any department of literature.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>PRIMAEVAL BOTANY.</HEAD>
<P>THE origin of Botany, considered in the most extensive view, must have been coeval with man. Before the inven∣tion of arts, the discovery of metals, and the use of implements and arms, by which animals were more immediately subjected
<PB N="2" REF="21"/>
to their power, it must be supposed that the human race derived, from the vegetable creation, the chief part of their sustenance, and the primary conveniences of life. Roots, fruits, and herbs, must then have consti∣tuted the food of man. Trials, and experi∣ence, would teach him all that choice and va∣riety, which his different situations allowed. The same faithful directors would insensibly inform him of the various qualities, and the different effects of them on his body. As the sphere of his observations and experi∣ence enlarged, he would derive the know∣ledge, and distinction, of such as were of easy, or of difficult digestion. He would discover the slatulent kinds, and such as corrected slatulency: which opened, or which constipated, the body; which was most nutritive, and probably, by fatal acci∣cidents, which were poisonous. Hence the rudiments of medical science.</P>
<P>This various knowledge would be handed down traditionally, from one generation to another, and with it, the names of such as were happily the first discoverers of new aliments, or medicinal properties, would
<PB N="3" REF="22"/>
descend with increasing reverence, until, in∣volved in obscurity by length of time, su∣perstition raised them to the rank of gods. Thus, in the early ages of mankind, as now among the still unlettered and uncultivated nations of the earth, the administration of simples, for the cure of wounds and diseases, was almost ever accompanied with super∣stitious ceremonies and incantations. Hence too, in process of time, the character of the priest and the physician was united; and the sick resorted to the temples of the gods for relief: and, although investigation and rational science made slow progress, yet, in every nation, from the most cultivated to the most barbarous, the number of simples used for medicinal purposes, became by degrees very considerable. Thus, when at length, physic assumed a more regular form, and was taught in the schools of Greece, the writings of HIPPOCRATES enumerate three hundred vegetables used in physic. Four centuries afterwards they were augmented by DIOSCORIDES to near seven hundred; and to these the Arabians added no inconsiderable number of valuable
<PB N="4" REF="23"/>
articles. There is room to believe, that the antient <HI>Gymnosophists</HI> of the East, pur∣sued the study of plants, with a success equal to that of the Greeks; and the mo∣dern nations of the East, the Japonese, the Chinese, and the Brachmans of India, incon∣testibly excel the enlightened nations of Greece and Rome, in their knowledge of Botany: witness the "Garden of Mala∣bar," which comprehends near eight hun∣dred plants; all which are described, and the virtues recorded, with an accuracy and precision, unexampled in the antient au∣thors of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome.</HI> But to approach nearer home: the Druids of <HI>Gaul,</HI> and of <HI>Britain,</HI> cultivated the knowledge of herbs, with no inconsiderable diligence. Whether these antient <HI>Magi</HI> of the West, who were both priests and physicians, sprung from those of the East, and thus derived their knowledge from a common source, a point which has hitherto divided the learned, or, whether their science was the result of their own investigation, I must leave to the cri∣tical antiquary to determine.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="5" REF="24"/>
<HEAD>DRUIDICAL BOTANY.</HEAD>
<P>In the mean time, in tracing the origin and progress of botanical science in <HI>Britain,</HI> a survey of its state in the druidical times, ought to claim the first attention; but in fact, the little information transmitted to us from the antients, relating to this extraordi∣nary sect, being almost wholly confined to <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> precludes any enlarged view respecting my particular object. It is from <HI>Pliny</HI> we learn, that to the <HI>misseltoe,</HI> the <HI>vervain,</HI> the <HI>selago,</HI> and the <HI>samolus,</HI> these antient fathers of druidism attributed efficacies almost divine; and ordained the collection, and administration of them, with rites and ceremonies, not short of re∣ligious strictness, and such as countenan∣ced the grossest superstition.</P>
<P>The <HI>misseltoe,</HI> for instance, must be cut only with a golden knife; must be gather∣ed when the moon was six days old; the priest cloathed in white; the plant received on a white napkin; and lastly, two white bulls were to be sacrificed; and thus con∣secrated,
<PB N="6" REF="25"/>
misseltoe was an antidote to poison and prevented sterility<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. xvi. c. 44.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>misseltoe</HI> perhaps, is, of these plants, the only one fully ascertained at this time. Its parasitical growth, the preference which the Druids gave to that which grew on the oak, assisted by the descriptions the antients have left of it, will sufficiently jus∣tify the application to the <HI>viscum</HI> of the moderns. May I not add, that probably, amidst the manifold virtues antiently as∣cribed to this plant, its power of curing the falling-sickness, which has accompa∣nied it almost to the present time, is the remnant of druidical use and tradition?</P>
<P>The <HI>vervain,</HI> after previous libations of honey, was to be gathered at the rising of the dog-star; when neither sun nor moon shone; with the left hand only; after de∣scribing a circle round the plant, &amp;c.; and thus prepared, it vanquished fevers, and other distempers; was an antidote to the bite of serpents, and a charm to conciliate friendship<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ib.</HI> lib. xxv. c. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="26"/>
With respect to this herb, the <HI>hierobotane,</HI> the <HI>sacra herba</HI> of DIOSCORIDES, although the modern botanists have now agreed to confine the term to the <HI>verbena,</HI> which PLINY has described, as having narrower and smaller leaves than the oak, it may be remarked, that there has been a diversity of opinions among the commentators, re∣lating to the plant; and it is acknowledged that <HI>verbena</HI> or <HI>verbenacea,</HI> was also applied, as a general term for all plants used about the altar in sacrifices. To this day the Tuscans apply the word <HI>vervena</HI> to slips, shoots, suckers, or bundles of plants of any kind.</P>
<P>The <HI>selago</HI> was not to be cut with iron; nor touched with the naked hand, but with the <HI>sagum;</HI> the Druid cloathed in white, and his feet naked, with other magic ceremo∣nies. Thus collected, and consecrated, it became a remedy for diseased eyes, and a charm against misfortunes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ib.</HI> lib. xxiv. c. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is, nevertheless, equally difficult to determine the <HI>selago</HI> of the Druids; PLINY
<PB N="8" REF="27"/>
having only described it as like the <HI>savin;</HI> a description which will accord with a va∣riety of plants of Europe. Most authors, nevertheless, have agreed, from this resem∣blance, to consider it as a species of <HI>wolfs∣claw moss,</HI> which is now called <HI>lycopodium selago.</HI> CAESALPINUS, however, thinks it was a <HI>sedum;</HI> and GUILANDINUS, an <HI>erica,</HI> or heath, and probably with more reason.</P>
<P>Various, but equally superstitious, were the rites attendant on the <HI>samolus,</HI> which was given to preserve oxen and swine from diseases.</P>
<P>This is a plant of which still greater doubts remain, PLINY having said nothing further of it, than that it grew in moist places. Hence the name is applied to a plant called <HI>round-leav d brooklime;</HI> but, as forming a separate genus in modern arrangements, it has acquired the name given as above, from <HI>Pliny.</HI> Others have thought it a species of <HI>pulsatilla,</HI> or pasque-flower; since one of that kind retains, among the Bolognese, the name of <HI>samiglo.</HI></P>
<P>The same uncertainty attends all disqui∣sitions relating to the <HI>herba Britannica,</HI> of
<PB N="9" REF="28" MS="y"/>
DIOSCORIDES and PLINY, famed for hav∣ing cured the soldiers of <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> on the Rhine, of the <HI>Scelotyrbe,</HI> or the disease supposed to be our sea scurvy. The uses of this herb were thought to have been derived from the Britons; the name suggested this notion; but later etymologists have found a different derivation: i. e. Brit. <HI>conso∣lidare;</HI> Tan. <HI>Deus, Ica</HI> s. Hica, <HI>ejectio;</HI> unde, <HI>Britannica dicitur herba, quae fir∣met et consolidat dentes vacillantes</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">RAY. <HI>Hist. Plant.</HI> i. p. 172.</NOTE>. The commentators have applied the descrip∣tion given by those two antients, to a variety of simples. By some, it has been thought to be the <HI>polygonum persicaria,</HI> or spotted arsmart: by others, the <HI>primula auricula,</HI> or wild auricula: by our own first herbalist, TURNER, who observed it plenti∣fully in <HI>Friesland,</HI> the scene of <HI>Pliny</HI>'s obser∣vations on its effects, the <HI>polygonum bistor∣ta,</HI> or bistort: at length, <HI>Abraham</HI> MUNT∣ING, a Dutch physician, published a treatise in 1681, professedly to prove, that the <HI>Bri∣tannica</HI> was the <HI>hydrolapathum magnum, (ru∣mex</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="29"/>
<HI>aquaticus)</HI> or great water dock. In this opinion RAY, and others, have acquiesced.</P>
<P>I should not have dwelt so long on these circumstances, but to shew the mortifying uncertainty attending the application of the names of plants from the antients, arising from their vague and indecisive descriptions. I add, that Mr. LIGHTFOOT thinks, there are sufficient traces in the highlands, of the high esteem in which the Druids held the quicken-tree, or mountain ash; <HI>sorbus au∣cuparia.</HI> It is, more frequently than any other tree, found planted in the neighbour∣hood of druidical circles of stones, so often seen in Scotland. Possibly this fact may be more equivocal than the superstitious uses to which it is still applied. It is believed, that a small part of this tree carried about them, is a charm against witchcraft and enchant∣ment. The dairy-maid drives the cattle with a switch of the <HI>roan-tree,</HI> for so it is called in the highlands, as a security against the same direful evils; and in one part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the sheep and lambs are, on the first of May, ever made to pass through a hoop of <HI>roan-wood.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="30"/>
Short, and imperfect, as this view of Drui∣dical Botany may be, as delivered to us by PLINY, yet there can be no doubt that the Britons, like all other rude nations, drew their medicinal sources from the sim∣ples growing around them, and were there∣fore well acquainted with common plants. And, although there are not, as far as I know, any herbals extant in the antient British language, or in any translation from it, by which the degree and extent of their knowledge may be precisely ascertained; yet, as far as respects the nomenclature merely, some reasonable estimate may, I apprehend, be formed from the list of <HI>Welch</HI> names of plants, preserved by GERARD, as communicated to him by Mr. <HI>Davies</HI> of <HI>Guissaney,</HI> in <HI>Flintshire:</HI> from the <HI>Irish</HI> names, as we find them in Mr. HEATON's catalogue, printed in THRELKELD's <HI>Synop∣sis;</HI> to which I may add, the <HI>Erse</HI> names communicated by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Stuart,</HI> to the late excellent and much-lamented botanist, the Rev. Mr. LIGHTFOOT. These lists might, without doubt, be greatly am∣plified, by the assiduity of skilful botanists
<PB N="12" REF="31"/>
well versed in the respective languages, THRELKELD's list, which is the most co∣pious, comprehends near four hundred names; and the analogy perceivable be∣tween these and the <HI>Erse</HI> names, suf∣ficiently marks a common origin.

<HEAD>SAXON BOTANY.</HEAD>
<P>The history of <HI>Saxon</HI> Botany must be very short. No nations, however rude, have yet been discovered, who were so re∣gardless of health, as not to have a know∣ledge of, and some dependence upon, the virtues of certain simples. There is suffi∣cient evidence, that our Saxon ancestors did
<PB N="14" REF="33"/>
not wholly disregard this study; since, al∣though rare, there are manuscript Saxon herbals extant in several public libraries. The two following occur in the Bodleian: <LIST>
<ITEM>4123. HERBARIUM. Saxonice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5169. LIBER MEDICINALIS, <HI>conti∣nens virtutes herbarum.</HI> Sax∣onice.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I am unable to determine whether the above are the same with the two following, which Dr. <HI>Ducarel</HI> notices from the Har∣leian collection: <LIST>
<ITEM>5066. Entitled, HERBARIUM. Sax∣onice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>585. <HI>Tractatus, qui ab Anglo-Saxoni∣bus dicebatur</HI> LIBER MEDI∣CINALIS.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The last is said to be an Anglo-Saxon version of APULEIUS, whom I shall have occasion to mention hereafter. The date of this translation is of the tenth century. The Saxons having been converted to Christianity at the latter end of the sixth century, the communication between <HI>Bri∣tain</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> became by degrees very fre∣quent,
<PB N="15" REF="34"/>
and learning was then first intro∣duced into these realms.</P>
<P>The golden age, if I may be allowed that expression, of the Anglo-Saxon learn∣ing, was the reign of ALFRED the Great. That munificent prince not only himself translated Latin authors, but, as historians in∣form us, encouraged in every way, the trans∣fusion of all the knowledge of the times into the common language of the kingdom. To this aera, therefore, may reasonably be refer∣red the Saxon version of APULEIUS; whose book seems to have preserved popularity through all the middle ages, and was found in common use at the aera of printing.</P>
<P>As no publication of any <HI>Saxon</HI> herbal has ever taken place, we are unable to de∣fine the extent of the knowledge of that time: at present, therefore, as in the in∣stance of antient <HI>British</HI> Botany, we can only recur to the nomenclature of the in∣digenous names, by which some of them are yet known; although many others have given way to Greek and Latin terms, and some to other revolutions, occasioned by the
<PB N="16" REF="35"/>
gradual progress of reformation throughout the science in general.</P>
<P>A list of the <HI>Anglo-Saxon</HI> names would be recoverable, in a great degree, by recur∣ring to the old herbals, to SKINNER's Lexi∣con, and other authorities of that kind. It would, I am persuaded, be more extensive than a superficial view might suggest, and would do credit to our Saxon ancestors. I cannot help remarking, that many mis∣takes have probably arisen from the neglect of our first reformers of Botany in <HI>England,</HI> after they had formed scientific names, in not preserving also the old and provincial terms; and that, on the whole, this ne∣glect has retarded the progress of knowledge on this subject.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>MIDDLE AGES.</HEAD>
<P>LEARNING and science follow the fate of empires. On the decline of those of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> and during that period in which the Saxons were establish∣ing themselves in <HI>Britain,</HI> medical know∣ledge passed into the hands of the trium∣phant Saracens. <HI>Bagdat,</HI> under the Eastern Caliphs, became the seat of learning. Much of the Greek physic and philosophy was corruptly translated by the command of Musselmen; among whom at length it
<PB N="18" REF="37"/>
received due reception and encouragement. Schools were established, in which ARIS∣TOTLE, GALEN, DIOSCORIDES, and other writers, were studied; and their doctrines at length pervaded the whole dominion of the Saracens, and finally flourished in the universities of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>DIOSCORIDES, though in a corrupt and mutilated state, formed the basis of know∣ledge in the <HI>Botany</HI> and Materia Medica of the Arabians. The situation of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> and its connection with <HI>India,</HI> allowed them scope to introduce into physic feveral use∣ful simples. Among others, we owe to these Orientals the milder purges of the present day; such as <HI>senna, cassia fistula, manna, tamarinds, rhubarb,</HI> and several drugs of other qualities, of which some retain a place in the present reformed state of the <HI>Materia Medica.</HI> AVICENNA, we are told, had coloured drawings for the instruction of his pupils in Botany; and <HI>Prosper</HI> AL∣PINUS assures us, he saw at <HI>Cairo</HI> a volume of paintings of the plants of <HI>Aegypt, Ara∣bia,</HI> and <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> which had been done for the use of a Sultan.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="38"/>
It is not easy, however, to judge, with precision, of the extent of Arabian know∣ledge on the subject of our work; since, probably, the best book of the Arabian school has yet remained unpublished, that of <HI>Ebn</HI> BEITHAR. It is extant in the Pa∣risian, the Escurial, and other libraries. This learned Arab was particularly attached to the botanical branch of physic. He was born in <HI>Spain;</HI> and after visiting <HI>Africa,</HI> travelled into the Levant, <HI>Asia,</HI> and even as far as the Indies, to improve his know∣ledge. In his return he was patronised by <HI>Saladin,</HI> at <HI>Cairo,</HI> and died in 1248.</P>
<P>HERBELOT informs us, that from the superiority of his learning in this branch, he was styled <HI>Aschard,</HI> or The Botanist. He wrote "A General History of Simples, or of Plants, ranged in alphabetical order;" in which he gives the Greek, Arabic, and vernacular names; with the descriptions of each; and particularly, in a more detailed manner, those not described by DIOSCORI∣DES and PLINY.</P>
<P>There is, notwithstanding, but little room to believe, that more original knowledge
<PB N="20" REF="39"/>
could be derived from the Arabian monu∣ments of science in this, than in the other departments of physic. In their best au∣thors, even the Greek names of plants are so grossly perverted, that they are scarcely to be known.</P>
<P>The Grecian authors having been inac∣curately translated at first, and the language neglected afterwards, physic lost much un∣der the dominion of the Arabians. It was, in the end, a corrupt Galenic theory, with an admixture of <HI>astrology</HI> and superstition. In this state the learned of Europe found it, in the celebrated Moorish universities of <HI>Spain.</HI> In the western parts of Christen∣dom, especially after the lapse of the Latin tongue in <HI>Italy,</HI> it was scarcely less obscured by the ignorance of the Monks, by whom, almost solely, the practice of it was en∣grossed.</P>
<P>Even the first university in Christendom, the renowned school of <HI>Salernum,</HI> founded by <HI>Charlemagne</HI> in the beginning of the ninth century, received its dictates from the cor∣rupt sources of the Arabians; whose works are said to have been at length translated
<PB N="21" REF="40"/>
into Latin by <HI>Constantine</HI> the African. The famous precepts <HI>de Conservanda Valetudine,</HI> issued from that school for the use of <HI>Ro∣bert</HI> duke of Normandy, were, without doubt, well known in England, and proba∣bly excited attention to the study of Vege∣tables; concerning which, numerous rules and cautions occur in that remnant of the learning of those days.</P>
<P>During all these ages, the original sources in the Greek authors were almost wholly forgotten, and the productions of that long night of science were equally rare and un∣improving.</P>
<P>I shall, nevertheless, enumerate briefly a few of those English authors, who were most conspicuous for any attention to the simples used in medicine, which alone bounded the botanical knowledge of those times.</P>
<P>One of our earliest writers, after the Conquest, was the historian HENRY <HI>Arch∣deacon of Huntingdon,</HI> in the time of king Stephen and Henry the IId. <HI>Bishop</HI> TAN∣NER informs us, that he left a MS. in
<PB N="22" REF="41"/>
eight Books, <HI>De</HI> HERBIS, <HI>de Aromatibus, et de Gemmis.</HI> Bib. Bodley. 6353.</P>
<P>Of nearly the same age are said to be, some manuscripts preserved in <HI>Bibl. Regia Lond.</HI> under the following titles, <HI>De Na∣tura Pecudum,</HI> ARBORUM, <HI>et Lapidum:</HI> and one De <HI>Naturis Herbarum.</HI> Bishop <HI>Tan∣ner</HI> mentions an Englishman of the name of <HI>Henry</HI> ARVIEL, who had travelled much, and resided some time at <HI>Bologna,</HI> about the year 1280. He left a manuscript <HI>De Bota∣nica, sive Stirpium Varia Historia.</HI></P>
<P>The same author notices a manuscript, in the Sloanean collection, of <HI>John</HI> BRAY, who lived in the time of Richard the IId. He studied Botany and Physic, and received an annual pension from the king, for his knowledge and skill in these sciences. It is entitled, <HI>Synonyma de nominibus Herba∣rum.</HI> It contains the names, in Latin, French, and English.</P>
<P>Besides the <HI>Compendium Medicinae</HI> of GILBERTUS LEGLE, or GILBERTUS AN∣GLICUS, who also flourished in the thir∣teenth century, a manuscript is recorded of
<PB N="23" REF="42"/>
that author, under the title of <HI>De re Herbaria, lib.</HI> 1. and others, <HI>De Viribus et Medicinis Herbarum, Arborum et Speci∣erum: et de Virtutibus Herbarum, lib.</HI> 1.</P>
<P>The famous English surgeon <HI>John</HI> AR∣DERN of Newark, extolled by Dr. <HI>Friend,</HI> as the reviver of surgery in England, who flourished soon after <HI>John</HI> of GADDESDEN, in the middle of the fourteenth century, left a manuscript, which is in the Sloanean library, under the title of <HI>De re Herbaria, Physica, et Chirurgica.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> DANIEL, a Dominican friar, said to be well skilled in the natural philosophy and physic of his time, left a manuscript inscribed <HI>Aaron Danielis.</HI> He therein treats <HI>De re Herbaria, de Arboribus, Fructicibus,</HI> &amp;c. He flourished about the year 1379.</P>
<P>Appertaining to my subject I also men∣tion, a treatise, written, as is supposed, in the time of Edward the IIId. by WALTER <HI>de</HI> HENLEY, entitled, <HI>De Yconomia five Housbrandia;</HI> in which, Bishop <HI>Tanner</HI> says, he has treated his subject well, according to the usage of the time.</P>
<P>NICOLAS BOLLAR, educated at <HI>Oxford,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="43"/>
whom TANNER represents as eminent for his knowledge in natural philosophy, wrote <HI>De Arborum Plantatione,</HI> lib. 3. <HI>De Gene∣ratione Arborum et modo Generandi et Plan∣tandi,</HI> lib. 2. and other tracts now in ma∣nuscript.</P>
<P>There is a manuscript said to be preserved in Baliol college, written by JOHANNES <HI>de</HI> S. PAULO, <HI>De Virtutibus Simplicium Medi∣cinarum.</HI> The age of these two last is not sufficiently ascertained; neither is that of a manuscript in <HI>Caius</HI> and <HI>Gonville</HI> college, <HI>Cant.</HI> entitled <HI>Cinomia</HI> (Synonymia) <HI>Her∣barum.</HI></P>
<P>The following authors, who wrote, at least prior to the introduction of printing into England, are enumerated, by Bishop <HI>Tanner,</HI> and others.</P>
<P><HI>Henricus</HI> CALCOENSIS, a prior of the Benedictine order, is said, by <HI>Dempster,</HI> to have travelled into <HI>France, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> solely to enjoy the conversation of the learned. He wrote <HI>Synopsis Herba∣ria,</HI> Lib. 1. and translated PALLADIUS <HI>de re Rustica,</HI> into the Scottish tongue, about the year 1493.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="44"/>
<HI>William</HI> HORMAN, a native of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> was educated at Winchester school, and be∣came a perpetual fellow of New College in 1477. In 1485 he was chosen school∣master and fellow of Eton, and at length elected vice-provost of the same college. He was a man of extensive and various eru∣dition. Among numerous productions, he left a book under the title of <HI>Herbarum Synonyma.</HI> He wrote indexes to the an∣tient authors <HI>De re Rustica:</HI> to <HI>Cato, Var∣ro, Columella,</HI> and <HI>Palladius.</HI> After several years of retirement, he died in 1535, and was buried in the chapel of the college.</P>

<P><PB N="27" REF="46"/>
This list, perhaps already too long, might have been considerably extended, but that it would have unnecessarily swelled this article. As none of these manuscripts, however, have been published, the exact state and progress of the science cannot be ascertained; yet enough is seen to convince us, that, although its advancemnet was slow and inconsiderable, it was not wholly lost in the darkness of that night, which, for so many ages, obscured the sources of knowledge. It is highly probable, that
<PB N="28" REF="47"/>
very few of the manuscripts before enume∣rated, exhibit any considerable portion of original matter; but, that they are princi∣pally extracts and compilations, from pre∣ceding writers of the lower age; such as, <HI>Apuleius, Aemilius Macer, S. Sethus, Isi∣dore, Constantinus,</HI> the <HI>Pandects</HI> of <HI>Mat∣thew Sylvaticus, Platearius,</HI> some of the later Arabians, and other writers of that stamp. At the renovation of knowledge just mentioned, these appear to have been the primary sources from which our an∣cestors of that generation derived assistance; since we find many MSS. of the above au∣thors
<PB N="29" REF="48"/>
were in being, at the origin of print∣ing, and were early issued from the press as the manuals of that day, in various parts of Christendom.</P>
<P>It has been observed, that the last-men∣tioned Saxon manuscript, was a translation of <HI>Lucius</HI> APULEIUS <HI>Madaurensis;</HI> whose work, from several other circumstances, there is room to believe, was, at that time, more diffused and popular in <HI>England,</HI> than any other. This author, who lived in the age of the <HI>Antonines,</HI> was born at <HI>Madura</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> at that time a seat of learning. He afterwards studied at <HI>Car∣thage,</HI> and at <HI>Athens,</HI> and for some time ap∣plied himself at <HI>Rome</HI> to jurisprudence, but at length quitted it, and devoted himself wholly to philosophy and physic. He is well known as the author of the <HI>Milesian</HI> Fables, and other works of learning. His book <HI>De Herbis, sive de Nominibus ac Virtutibus Herbarum,</HI> alone comes under our cognizance: In this he recites the names of medicinal herbs, in the Greek, Latin, Egyptian, Punic, Celtic, and Da∣cian, and of some in the oriental languages.
<PB N="30" REF="49"/>
These names form the bulk of the book, which consists of one hundred and thirty chapters. After each name follows a short description of the plant, the place of growth, and the properties. Then the dis∣cases to which each simple is applicable. The work nevertheless abounds with gross errors in the names of plants, and inculcates the most absurd ceremonies and supersti∣tions in the administration of remedies; yet it was in much esteem throughout the dark ages of literature.</P>
<P>It must not however be concealed, that some of the learned have judged, that this work, at least as it now appears, was not written by the author whose name it bears, but at a much later period. JOHNSON, the editor of <HI>Gerard,</HI> imagined it to be a trans∣lation of a Greek writer of the eighth cen∣tury; but his conjecture is not thought probable by <HI>Fabricius</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b. Latin. ab Ernesto.</HI> Lips. 1774, tom. 3. p. 44.</NOTE>. The remarks of <HI>Johnson</HI> prove, that this work was in com∣mon use in the ages I have spoken of; and that the copies had been greatly corrupted and mutilated, by ignorant hands.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="50"/>
I will give one instance from APULEIUS, of that credulity and superstition, which, sanctioned by antiquity, yet prevailed in the administration of remedies; and exhibits a melancholy proof of the wretched state of physic, which, through so many ages, had not broke the shackles of druidical magic and imposition. As a cure for a disease, called by the French <HI>Nouè l'Equillette,</HI> you are directed to take seven stalks of the herb <HI>lions-foot,</HI> separated from the roots; these are to be boiled in water in the wane of the moon. The patient is to be washed with this water, on the approach of night, stand∣ing before the threshold, on the outside of his own house, and the person who per∣forms this office for the sick, is also not to fail to wash himself. This done, the sick person is to be fumigated with the smoke of the herb <HI>Aristolochia,</HI> and both persons are then to enter into the house together, taking strict care not to look behind them while returning; after which, adds the au∣thor, the sick will immediately become well.</P>
<P>A book under the name of MACER's
<PB N="32" REF="51"/>
<HI>Herbal,</HI> seems also to have been in common use in <HI>England,</HI> before the aera of printing. Authors do not allow it to be the production of <HI>Aemilius</HI> MACER quoted by OVID, but of much later date, and by some it is as∣cribed to ODO, or ODOBONUS, a physician of the later times, and probably a French∣man. This barbarous poem is in leonine verse, and is entitled <HI>De Naturis, Qualita∣tibus, &amp; Virtutibus Herbarum.</HI> Divers manuscripts of it are extant in the English libraries; as, at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> in the <HI>Bodleian, Ashmolean,</HI> and <HI>Sloanean</HI> collections.</P>
<P>It was translated into English, as Bishop TANNER informs us, by <HI>John</HI> LELAMAR, master of <HI>Hereford</HI> school, who lived about the year 1373. His manuscript is referred to as in <HI>Sloane</HI>'s library. Even LINACRE did not disdain to employ himself on this work. "MACER's HERBAL practysyd by Doctor Linacro, translated out of Latin into English, London, 12mo." AMES mentions an edition of it printed in 1542; and <HI>Palmer,</HI> one without date, printed by <HI>Wyre.</HI> This jejune performance, which is written wholly on Galenic principles,
<PB N="33" REF="52"/>
treats on the virtues of not more than eighty-eight simples.</P>
<P>I shall not detain the reader by dwelling on other authors of this class, whose names I have before recited; it will be sufficient to observe, that, fettered as were the theories of this time with astrology, and a strange mix∣ture of the Galenic doctrine of the four ele∣ments, it extended its influence, not to the human body alone, but to all the instru∣ments of physic. Not even a plant of me∣dicinal use, but was placed under the do∣minion of some planet, and must neither be gathered, nor applied, but with observances that savoured of the most absurd supersti∣tion.</P>

<P>Manuscripts of the <HI>Patres Botanici</HI> scarce in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>—Restoration of ancient knowledge, by the publications of <HI>Pliny, Dioscorides,</HI> and <HI>Theo∣phrastus</HI>—The aera of commentators—Rise of true investigation by <HI>Brunsfelsius, Tragus, Cor∣dus,</HI> and <HI>Gesner</HI>—Famous MS. of <HI>Dioscorides,</HI> with illuminated figures.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>MIDDLE AGES.</HEAD>
<P>AT this time manuscripts of THEO∣PHRASTUS, DIOSCORIDES, and PLINY, were not only exceedingly rare throughout Europe, but those of the two former were unnoticed through ignorance of the Greek language; otherwise we can∣not suppose our ancestors could have ne∣glected them, for the crude and barbarous works which have been mentioned. It was not till the opening of the fifteenth cen∣tury, that opportunity was given to recur to these repositories of antient lore. The flight of the Greeks into <HI>Italy,</HI> at the subversion of the Eastern Empire, and the subsequent
<PB N="35" REF="54"/>
invention of printing, by bringing to light, and disseminating the purer remains of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> at length broke the chains of barbarism and superstition, which, during so many ages, had tyrannized over the understandings of mankind.</P>
<P>On this happy revolution, Botany, with other sciences, revived, and presently re∣sumed another appearance. The publica∣tion of the <HI>Patres Botanici</HI> raised, at once, a spirit of emulation to investigate the sub∣jects of their works.</P>
<P>PLINY was first printed, if not at <HI>Verona,</HI> in 1468, as is affirmed by some, and doubt∣ed by others, at least in the succeeding year, at <HI>Venice;</HI> and the avidity with which it was received, is manifested by the numerous im∣pressions of it, before the end of that cen∣tury.</P>
<P>DIOSCORIDES came forth first at <HI>Cologn,</HI> in a Latin translation, in 1478; and in the original, by <HI>Aldus,</HI> in 1495. It was after∣wards published in Latin by HERMOLAUS BARBARUS and RUELLIUS, in the year 1516; by VERGILIUS, in 1518; and by CORNARUS in 1529. The learned now
<PB N="36" REF="55"/>
prefer the edition with a translation by SA∣RACENUS, printed at <HI>Lyons</HI> in 1598.</P>
<P>THEOPHRASTUS was first printed in Greek at <HI>Venice,</HI> without date, and by <HI>Al∣dus,</HI> in 1495 and 1498. He was translated into Latin by GAZA in 1483, and this ver∣sion has been preferred by succeeding wri∣ters.</P>
<P>The restoration of these sages of anti∣quity, immediately raised up a numerous set of commentators. Every plant was sought for, and every plant was discovered, in the works of antiquity. No drug used in medicine was esteemed <HI>true,</HI> unless found in DIOSCORIDES. <HI>Scaliger</HI> wrote animad∣versions on THEOPHRASTUS in 1566; in which he has corrected the version of <HI>Gaza</HI> in many places. Robert <HI>Constantine</HI> produ∣ced the parallel places in PLINY; and BO∣DAEUS à STAPEL, in 1644, astonished the world, by a display of erudition on this au∣thor, in which he exhausted all farther dis∣quisition, by the profusion of his remarks, and collations, from all preceding writers.</P>
<P>The commentaries on DIOSCORIDES have been more numerous. The <HI>Corollaria</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="56"/>
of HERMOLAUS BARBARUS was published in 1492. To <HI>Hermolaus</HI> succeeded BRUNS∣FELSIUS, <HI>Petrus Leydensis,</HI> LACUNA, AMA∣TUS LUSITANUS, <HI>Robert</HI> CONSTANTINE, <HI>Val.</HI> CORDUS, and several others; and finally MATTHIOLUS, whose work has su∣perseded the rest. It was first printed in 1554, and passed through seventeen edi∣tions. If we may believe one of the corre∣spondents of this author, thirty-two thou∣sand copies had been sold before the year 1561<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MATTHIOL. <HI>Oper. Omn.</HI> Ed. 1674. <HI>in Epist.</HI> p. 150.</NOTE>. The best edition, with the ac∣cessions of CASPAR BAUHINE in 1598, still finds a reputable place in modern li∣braries.</P>
<P>Among the illustrators of PLINY, <HI>Her∣molaus Barbarus</HI> in 1492 stood foremost. His <HI>Castigationes Plinianae,</HI> were published in 1492, in which he successfully corrected the text; and LEONICENUS, in the same year, was the first who employed critical knowledge on this author. The corrup∣tions of the text afforded great scope after∣wards to GALENIUS, RHENANUS, PIN∣TIANI,
<PB N="38" REF="57"/>
and others. The <HI>Exercitationes Plinianae</HI> of SALMASIUS, are well known. Those of the laborious and paradoxical HARDUIN, are the principal resort of mo∣dern times.</P>
<P>It is a mortifying reflexion in the annals of human knowledge, that the bulk of these learned men, after their immense labours, mistook, in numberless instances, the road to truth, and did but perplex the science they wished to enlighten. The descriptions of plants in the antient authors, were, at best, short, vague, and insufficient; and with this inconvenience, the study of nature herself was neglected. In the mean time, there arose a genuine set of cultivators, who, discovering this error of the commen∣tators, studied plants in the fields, where alone the best comments could be made. As the foremost of these, stands BRUNS∣FELSIUS. He was followed by TRAGUS, FUCHSIUS, <HI>Val.</HI> CORDUS, GESNER, CAE∣SALPINUS, and above all CLUSIUS, to whom must be added our own countryman TURNER. Still, even among these genuine restorers of natural knowledge, many did
<PB N="39" REF="58"/>
not sufficiently recollect, that all the plants of DIOSCORIDES, were not those of <HI>Europe,</HI> but principally those of <HI>Asia;</HI> whilst, in∣stead of traversing the fields of <HI>Greece, Cili∣cia,</HI> and the East, they were straining all the descriptions of this author, to accommo∣date them to the vegetables of <HI>Europe.</HI> It is not strange that their endeavours were but little successful. Even, after the la∣bours of RAUWOLF, who traversed <HI>Syria, Mesopotomia, Palestine,</HI> and <HI>Aegypt,</HI> in the sixteenth century, and those of the enlight∣ened TOURNEFORT in the present, it does not appear, that of the seven hundred plants in the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> of DIOSCORIDES, more than four hundred, at the farthest, are properly ascertained at this time.</P>
<P>We learn from PLINY (lib. 25. c. 2.) that there were paintings of plants in his day; but he complains, that, through the inaccuracy of copiers, they were not to be depended on. SALMASIUS tells us, he inspected a Greek MS. of DIOSCORIDES more than a thousand years old, in which the plants were figured with sufficient ele∣gance indeed, but with little regard to truth
<PB N="40" REF="59"/>
and exact resemblance. There are now existing several manuscripts of DIOSCO∣RIDES, with illuminated figures, particu∣larly the famous one in the imperial library at <HI>Vienna,</HI> of which LAMBECIUS treats largely.</P>
<P>It was procured by <HI>Busbequius,</HI> the em∣peror's resident at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> about 1560; and is said to have been copied at the expence of JULIANA ANICIA, daugh∣ter to the emperor <HI>Flavius Anicius Olyber,</HI> about the year 492. It has been regretted by some of the learned, that this MS. had not been brought earlier into <HI>Europe;</HI> by which means the commentators might have been saved much trouble. Antient, how∣ever, and splendid as this is, it may justly be doubted, whether the publication of it would have much conduced to the restora∣tion of ancient Botany, and <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> since, if we are allowed to judge of the figures, from the specimens copied by DO∣DONAEUS, nothing can exceed the rudeness of them, or more strongly justify the re∣mark of <HI>Salmasius.</HI> And as several of these are copied into GERARD's Herbal, for the
<PB N="41" REF="60"/>
satisfaction of the curious, I refer in the note<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P>In justice, however, to these valuable re∣mains, it must be observed, that, from later information, we find, there is, besides this <HI>Constantinopolitan</HI> MS. which is in folio, an∣other, supposed to be more ancient, in 4to. which is distinguished by the name of <HI>Nea∣politan:</HI> that the figures in both these agree extremely well; and, as <HI>Haller</HI> informs us, are sufficiently exact to enable the bo∣tanical traveller, with such drawings in his hands, to distinguish the plants of DIOS∣CORIDES in the native places of growth. It is particularly specified, that the <HI>pericly∣menum</HI> of these manuscripts evidently ap∣pears
<PB N="42" REF="61"/>
to be the <HI>convolvulus major</HI> of the mo∣derns; and the <HI>telephium,</HI> the <HI>cerinthe minor.</HI> Finally, that if those enumerated in the note so ill express the plants designed, it must be wholly attributed to the fault of the copier or engraver. This intelligence is attended with regret, when we further learn, that after some of these icons were lately engraved, with a view to the publi∣cation of the whole, the design has been laid aside.</P>
<P>I shall be thought, perhaps, in the fore∣going pages, to have digressed too much. I have to allege, that a brief view of the general state and progress of physic, with which my subject is inseparably connected, during the dominion of the Saracens in the East, and in the ages of ignorance preceding the fourteenth century in the West, seemed necessary in order to throw light on the introduction of it into this island. And as <HI>England</HI> shared the improvement arising from the restoration of antient knowledge, a short notice of the three principal botanic authors was deemed not less proper.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="62"/>
At this distance of time, perhaps it may require some warmth of imagination, to picture to the mind that satisfaction, which ingenuous and learned men must have ex∣perienced, who lived when the veil was re∣moved, which for ages had obscured and confined those elegant sources of intellec∣tual enjoyments, which the writings of the antients display; when the means of attain∣ing them were, by the invention of print∣ing, so happily amplified, and the progress, not only of those arts and sciences which embellish, but of those which also dignify human nature by their utility, was no longer retarded.</P>

<HEAD>HORTUS SANITATIS.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not till several years after the aera of printing, that any original work, strictly botanical, made its appearance, even on the continent; and still longer before <HI>England</HI> produced any publication of im∣portance in that way.</P>
<P>Previous to the first dawning of this sci∣ence in <HI>England,</HI> it is almost necessary to mention some of the productions abroad, as they were the basis of what was here first published, although, in fact, there was no original work before the <HI>Herbal</HI> of TUR∣NER.</P>
<P>In the opinion of SEGUIER, the first book on plants, with figures, was printed
<PB N="45" REF="64"/>
at <HI>Augsburgh,</HI> soon after the invention of wooden cuts, or tables, between the years 1475 and 1478, in the German tongue, with the title of "<HI>The Book of Nature.</HI>" It treats of animals and plants; of the lat∣ter, a hundred and seventy-six kinds are no∣ticed, and many of them figured. The work is made up chiefly from PLINY, <HI>Isidore,</HI> and <HI>Platearius.</HI></P>
<P>This book seems to have been soon su∣perseded by the famous Herbal of <HI>Mentz,</HI> in 1484, stiled simply "HERBARIUS;" which gave rise, the next year, to the well-known work ORTUS SANITATIS, ascribed to CUBA, a physician of <HI>Augsburgh,</HI> and after∣wards of <HI>Frankfort;</HI> who, if not the author, was at least the editor of an enlarged and improved edition. This work, under dif∣ferent editors, was the basis of all the <HI>Her∣bals</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> for many years.</P>
<P>Its object is the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> from all nature; but vegetables occupy the greater part. The first edition was comprised in four hundred and thirty-five chapters: in one, printed at Venice in 1511, which is in the black letter, they are extended to a
<PB N="46" REF="65"/>
thousand and sixty-six; of which, one half treat on the vegetable kingdom. The au∣thor professes to have drawn his resources from HIPPOCRATES, GALEN, PLINY, AVICENNA, SERAPION, MESUES, DIOS∣CORIDES, PLATEARIUS, VINCENTIUS, the <HI>Pandects,</HI> PALLADIUS, CONSTANTIN, ALMANSER, and others. At the head of each chapter stands a cut, than which, scarcely any thing can be conceived more rude; and, in some cases, nothing is more puerile or ridiculous. The pages, if printed with numbers, would amount to more than seven hundred. Many copies of this per∣formance are remaining, although the <HI>Her∣barius</HI> is become very scarce.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>GRETE HERBAL.</HEAD>
<P>These books were undoubtedly the foun∣dation of the first printed botanical work of any consequence, or popularity in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> and which appeared under the title of "The GRETE HERBAL, with cuts;" printed for <HI>Peter Treveris,</HI> as <HI>Ames</HI> tells us, in 1516. Before the impression of this book in <HI>England,</HI> some editions of the "Herba∣rius,"
<PB N="47" REF="66"/>
on the continent, had been aug∣mented so far as to contain five hundred figures of plants. The "Grete Herbal" seems to have been well received in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> since there are subsequent copies, which bear the following dates; 1526, 1529, 1539: and in the Continuation of <HI>Ames,</HI> an edition is mentioned of the "Great Herbal," about the year 1550, "without the cuts." There is also an edition of this book so late as the year 1561, which is ten years after the date of TURNER's "Herbal." That of 1526 bears the fol∣lowing title:</P>
<P>"<HI>The</HI> GRETE HERBALL <HI>whiche geveth parfyt knowledge &amp; understandyng of all man∣ner of Herbes and there gracyous vertues which God hath ordeyned for our prosperous welfare &amp; helth, for they hele and cure all manner of dyseases &amp; sekenesses that fall or mis∣fortune to all manner of creatoures of God created, practysed by many expert and wyse masters, as</HI> AVICENNA <HI>and other &amp;c.

<P>This volume is of the small folio form; and if printed with numbered pages, would make three hundred and fifty, exclusive of the Preface and Index. It includes the animal, vegetable, and mineral substances, used in medicine; and is said in the Intro∣duction to be <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"compyled, composed, and auctorysed by divers and many noble Doc∣tours and expert Maysters in Medycynes; as <HI>Avicenna, Pandecta, Constantinus, Wil∣helmus, Platearius, Rabbi Moyses, Johan∣nes Mesue, Haly, Albertus, Bartholomeus,</HI> and more other, &amp;c."</Q></P>
<P>There is no author's name to it; but there are indubitable traces of its being <HI>fa∣bricated</HI> from the <HI>Hortus Sanitatis,</HI> and pro∣bably from the French translation of that work, printed by <HI>Caron,</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> in 1499, with some alterations and additions.</P>
<P>It abounds with the barbarous and mis∣spelt names of the middle ages, and is un∣doubtedly the work which TURNER refers
<PB N="49" REF="68"/>
to in the Preface to his "Herbal," where he observes, that, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as yet there was no English Herbal but one, al full of un∣learned cacographees, and falsely naming of herbs."</Q></P>
<P>The general order is that of the alpha∣bet, according to the Latin names, each subject forming a chapter, in the whole five hundred and five; of which, more than four hundred respect the vegetable productions; and of these one hundred and fifty bear the names of plants which are natives of <HI>Eng∣land:</HI> but the writer remarks no other dis∣tinction, by which they are known from the exotics. The names are given in La∣tin and English, but throughout the whole scarcely any descriptions. The qualities, whether <HI>hot</HI> or <HI>cold, dry</HI> or <HI>moist,</HI> accord∣ing to the Galenic mode of the time, is in∣variably noticed, followed generally by a prolix account of the diseases to which the plant is applicable, and the method of using it.</P>
<P>To each is prefixed a coarse wooden-cut figure, as in the <HI>Hortus Sanitatis,</HI> from
<PB N="50" REF="69"/>
which, on a somewhat smaller scale, they are evidently copied; consisting generally of outlines only. Each block is two inches high, and nearly as wide. Many of these figures are fictitious, and many misplaced. In a variety of instances the same figure is prefixed to different plants, and in very few are they sufficiently expressive of the habit, to discriminate even a well-known subject, if the name applied did not suggest the idea of it. In some, these icons are whimsically absurd, especially in the animals and mine∣rals, being also copies of those in the <HI>Hortus Sanitatis.</HI> Those of the <HI>Mandrake,</HI> for ex∣ample, exhibit two perfectly human figures, with the plant growing from the head of each; though, to do the writer justice, he acknowledges, that no such thing exists in nature. At the end is subjoined, "an ex∣planation of some terms;" and "a tract on urines."</P>

the earliest times renowned for the produc∣tion of medicinal herbs, was the physic-gar∣den of <HI>Rome.</HI> The Emperors, we are told, maintained in that island, herbarists, and gardeners, to provide the physicians of <HI>Rome</HI> with simples. <HI>Castor,</HI> a Greek, praised both by PLINY and GALEN, is said, not only to have written many volumes con∣cerning plants, but to have had a garden at <HI>Rome,</HI> in which, PLINY relates, that CAS∣TOR, at upwards of an hundred years of age, demonstrated plants, and taught him to distinguish several rare and useful spe∣cies.</P>
<P>The utility of these institutions are self∣evident. By public gardens, medicinal plants are at the command of the teacher in every lesson. By private ones, the eye, and the taste of the opulent and scientific owner, is perpetually gratified with the succession of curious, scarce, and exotic luxuries; in comparing the doubtful species, and examining them through all the stages of growth, with those to which they are allied. Add to which, that all these ad∣vantages are accumulated in a thousand ob∣jects
<PB N="54" REF="73"/>
at the same time. The first public institution of this kind, in more modern times, was that of <HI>Padua</HI> by the Venetians, in the year 1533. LUCAS GHINUS, the first public professor of Botany in <HI>Europe,</HI> was a strenuous promoter of the same de∣signs; and by his influence procured the establishment of a garden at <HI>Bologna,</HI> in 1547, where TURNER himself imbibed much of that knowledge, which afterwards gave him such pre-eminence in his own country.</P>
<P>Among the earliest private gardens of the same kind, was that of EURICIUS CORDUS, the disciple of the venerable LEONICENUS, and of MANARDUS, two of the first com∣mentators who displayed true Botanical criticism, on the works of the antients. CORDUS shewed himself afterwards worthy of such masters. In his <HI>Botanologicon,</HI> print∣ed in 1534, he mentions his own garden, and that of NORDECIUS at <HI>Cassel.</HI> About the same time there were several opulent pa∣trons of this science in <HI>Italy, Germany,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> who followed this example. GES∣NER constructed a garden at <HI>Zurich</HI> in
<PB N="55" REF="74"/>
1560; the first of the kind in <HI>Switzerland.</HI> He not only delineated plants himself, but maintained, at his own expence, a draughts∣man and engraver, for the same purposes. TURNER appears to have had a garden for rare plants, even during his residence at <HI>Cologn.</HI> In <HI>England</HI> he records the garden of the duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> at <HI>Sion House,</HI> of which he seems to have had the direc∣tion; and, at a later period, as hath been before observed, mentions also his own at <HI>Wells.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>TURNER.</HEAD>
<P>THE history of English Botany to this period, from its imperfect, and even barbarous state, may perhaps not unaptly be considered as the fabulous age of the science among us. But we are now arrived at the true Era of its birth in <HI>England.</HI> I cannot call it the restoration, since this nation, like <HI>Italy</HI> in the flourishing state of <HI>Rome,</HI> had never been enlightened by the writings of <HI>Greece.</HI> It was much later be∣fore the works of those sages reached this kingdom. Manuscript copies of the PATRES BOTANICI, as hath been before observed,
<PB N="57" REF="76"/>
were exceedingly rare; and the language itself in which they are written, had made small progress in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>On this head, indeed, my sources of in∣formation are very narrow; as far as they reach, I am not able to find, that one ma∣nuscript of THEOPHRASTUS existed at this period, in any of the public libraries of <HI>England.</HI> Of DIOSCORIDES, there are two MSS. in the <HI>Bodleian,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 3637, which bear the title of "<HI>De Herbarum Natura et Vir∣tutibus, cum Iconibus elegantibus.</HI>" And in the same collection, N<SUP>o</SUP> 840, an Arabic version of the five books, <HI>cum Nominibus à Thoma Hyde adjectis.</HI> Of PLINY, there is said to be an entire copy in <HI>Baliol</HI> library, N<SUP>o</SUP> 279; an imperfect one, of eighteen books only, in the <HI>Norfolk</HI> collection, N<SUP>o</SUP> 2996; and an epitome, in Trinity-college, <HI>Cambridge,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 459.</P>
<P>Even of the works of HIPPOCRATES, scarcely any were known except his <HI>Apho∣risms</HI> and <HI>Prognostics;</HI> and <HI>Linacre</HI> first made the English physicians acquainted with GALEN. But to return; the true Era of Botany in <HI>England,</HI> must commence
<PB N="58" REF="77"/>
with Dr. <HI>William</HI> TURNER, who was un∣questionably the earliest writer among us, that discovered learning and critical judg∣ment in the knowledge of plants; and whose "Book of Herbs," as Dr. BUL∣LEYN observes, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"will always grow green, and never wither as long as <HI>Dioscorides</HI> is held in mind by us mortal wights."</Q> But, before I turn my attention to TURNER, I will remark, that, in an interval of thirty-four years between the first edition of "The Grete Herbal," in 1516, and that of TURNER, in 1550, I have it not in my power to refer to any publication on my subject, in the English tongue. That there were translations of several of the writers of the middle ages, has been noticed. Among those, on the continent, there were several by whose means Botany made a rapid pro∣gress. The principal were BRUNSFELSIUS, EURICIUS CORDUS, RUELLIUS, <HI>Valerius</HI> CORDUS, FUCHSIUS, and above all GES∣NER, who, possessing a genius and indus∣try, almost unparalleled in these studies, com∣prehended this rising branch of knowledge, with a more expanded view than any of his
<PB N="59" REF="78"/>
predecessors, and extended its bounds beyond the limits, which, till that time, <HI>Materia Medica</HI> alone, had prescribed to it. But GESNER's talents, though in Botany they were original, were still more conspicuous in his knowledge of the animal kingdom, in which, his writings will long be valued and esteemed, by those especially, who, without painful researches, would see an∣tient literature in a concentrated view. I speak not of his abilities as a philologist and critic, in which characters he held a distinguished place. But to proceed,</P>
<P>WILLIAM TURNER was born at <HI>Mor∣peth</HI> in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and educated at Pembroke college, <HI>Cambridge,</HI> under the patronage and assistance of <HI>Sir Thomas Wentworth.</HI> I find him a student of that college about the year 1538, where he ac∣quired great reputation for his learning. He applied himself to philosophy and physic, and early discovered an inclination to the study of plants, and a wish to be well ac∣quainted with the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> of the antients.</P>
<P>He complains of the little assistance he
<PB N="60" REF="79"/>
could receive in these pursuits. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Being yet a student of Pembroke hall, whereas I could learn never one Greke, neither Latin, nor English name, even amongst the physicians, of any herbe or tree: such was the ignorance at that time; and as yet there was no English Herbal, but one all full of unlearned cacographies and falsely naming of herbes."</Q></P>
<P>At <HI>Cambridge,</HI> TURNER imbibed the principles of the reformers, and afterwards, agreeably to the practice of many others, united, to the character of the physician, that of the divine. He became a preacher, tra∣velling into many parts of <HI>England,</HI> and propagated, with so much zeal, the cause of the reformation, that he excited perse∣cution from Bishop <HI>Gardiner.</HI> He was thrown into prison, and detained a consi∣derable time. On his enlargement, he sub∣mitted to voluntary exile, during the re∣mainder of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.</P>
<P>This banishment proved favourable to his advancement in medical and botanical studies; he resided at <HI>Basil,</HI> at <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> at <HI>Bonn;</HI> but principally at <HI>Cologn,</HI> with
<PB N="61" REF="80"/>
many other English refugees. He dwelt for some time at <HI>Wiessenburgh;</HI> he travelled into <HI>Italy,</HI> and took the degree of Doctor of Physic at <HI>Ferrara.</HI> As, at this period, the learned were applying with great assi∣duity to the illustration of the antients, it was a fortunate circumstance to Dr. TUR∣NER, that he had an opportunity of attend∣ing the lectures of <HI>Lucas</HI> GHINUS, at <HI>Bo∣logna,</HI> of whom he speaks in his "<HI>Herbal</HI>" with great satisfaction; and frequently cites his authority against other commentators. GHINUS was the first who erected a sepa∣rate professorial chair for Botanical science; from whence he gave lectures on DIOSCO∣RIDES, which he continued for twenty-eight years with great applause. He pro∣cured the physic-garden to be founded at <HI>Bologna,</HI> to demonstrate the plants he spoke of. He was the preceptor of CAESALPI∣NUS and ANGUILLARA, who became two of the soundest critics in the knowledge of plants, that the age produced. TURNER resided a considerable time at <HI>Basil,</HI> from which place he dates the dedication of his book "On the Baths of <HI>England</HI> and
<PB N="62" REF="81"/>
<HI>Germany.</HI>" During his residence in <HI>Swit∣zerland,</HI> he contracted a friendship with GESNER, and afterwards kept up a corre∣spondence with him.</P>
<P>GESNER had a high opinion of TUR∣NER, as appears by the following passage in his book <HI>De Herbis Lunariis,</HI> printed in 1555. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ante annos</HI> 15<HI>, aut circiter cum Anglicus ex Italia rediens, me salutaret</HI> (TURNERUS) <HI>is suerit vir excellentis tum in re medica tum aliis plerisque disciplinis doc∣trinae, aut alius quispiam vix satis memini, &amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>At the accession of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. he re∣turned to <HI>England,</HI> was incorporated Doc∣tor of Physic at <HI>Oxford,</HI> appointed Physi∣cian to <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> and, as a divine, was rewarded with a Prebend of <HI>York,</HI> a Canonry of <HI>Windsor,</HI> and the Deane∣ry of <HI>Wells.</HI> He speaks of himself in the third part of his Herbal, when treating on the <HI>herba Britannica,</HI> which he took to be the Bistort, as having been physician to the "Erle of <HI>Embden,</HI> Lord of <HI>East Fries∣land.</HI>" In 1551 he published the first part of his history of plants, which he dedicat∣ed
<PB N="63" REF="82"/>
to the duke, his patron. His zeal in the cause of the reformation, which he had amply testified by several religious tracts, induced him to retreat to the continent, during the whole reign of <HI>Mary.</HI> At her decease, Queen ELIZABETH reinstated him in all his church preferments. In the de∣dication of the compleat edition of his "Herbal" to the queen, in 1568, after complimenting her majesty on account of her skill in the Latin language, and the fluency with which she conversed in it, he acknowledges with gratitude, her favours in restoring him to his benefices, and in other ways protecting him from troubles; hav∣ing, at four several times, granted him the great seal for these purposes. He seems to have divided his time between his deanery, where he had a Botanical garden, of which frequent mention is made in his "Her∣bal," and his house in Crutched Friers, <HI>London.</HI> He also speaks of his garden at <HI>Kew.</HI> From the repeated notices he takes of the plants in <HI>Purbeck,</HI> and about <HI>Port∣land,</HI> I should suppose he must have had some intimate connections in <HI>Dorsetshire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="83"/>
Dr. TURNER died July 7, 1568, a few months after the publication of the last part of his "Herbal." He left several children: his son <HI>Peter</HI> was educated to physic, tra∣velled, and took degrees abroad; was incor∣porated doctor at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and at <HI>Oxford;</HI> and died aged 72, in 1614; but I do not find that he inherited his father's turn to Botany.</P>
<P>TURNER's first work on the subject of plants, if BUMALDUS is not mistaken, was printed at <HI>Cologn,</HI> under the title of "<HI>Historia de Naturis Herbarum Scholiis et Notis vallata.</HI>" <HI>Colon.</HI> apud Gymnicum 1544. 8<SUP>o</SUP>. <HI>Bumaldus</HI> is the only writer, in whom I find any mention of this book; and I suspect, it was not republished in <HI>England.</HI> It was followed by a small volume under the title of "NAMES OF HERBES, in Greek, Latin, English, Dutch, and French." <HI>Lond.</HI> 12<SUP>o</SUP>. 1548. This nomenclator is, I believe, be∣come very scarce; since it has not yet found its way into the copious and magnificent collection of Sir <HI>Joseph</HI> BANKS.</P>
<P>Dr. TURNER's knowledge in natural his∣tory was not confined to Botany; his earliest
<PB N="65" REF="84"/>
publication appears to have been, a treatise on birds, under the following title:</P>
<P>"<HI>Avium praecipuarum quarum apud Plini∣um et Aristotelem mentio est brevis et succinct a historia, ex optimis quibusque scriptoribus con∣texta. Scholio illustrata et aucta. Adjectis nominibus Graecis, Germanicis, et Britannicis.</HI>" Coloniae 1543. 8<SUP>o</SUP>. Not having seen this volume, I can only say, that TURNER is mentioned by his friend GESNER, in re∣spectful terms, as an ornithologist. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Avium quidem nomina et naturas ante nos et pauci et breviter attigerunt ex quibus Gyb. Longolius Germanus, et Gulielmus</HI> TURNER <HI>Anglus viri doctissimi praecipuam merentur laudem.</HI>" <HI>Gesn. Praef. ad Avium Hist.</HI></Q> TURNER also contributed to enrich GESNER's museum (the first collection of that kind,) with na∣tural curiosities, which he sent from <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> To which I add, that Dr. MERRET gives the following testimony to the worth of TURNER, in the Preface to his "Pinax:" <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Consului in quibusdam</HI> TURNERUM <HI>nostra∣tem inter viros suae aetatis exercitatissimum qui librum de avibus edidit mole parvum at judicio majorem.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="85"/>
Prefixed to the third volume of the <HI>Frankfort</HI> edition of GESNER's <HI>Historia Animalium,</HI> in 1620, we find a letter from Dr. TURNER, relating to the English fishes; which sufficiently proves, that he had no inconsiderable degree of knowledge in that part of zoology. He makes an apology for the imperfections of it, as being written from memory, and at a distance from all his notes and observations. It consists of three pages, in which he has briefly described more than fifty species; and it seems to be intended principally to give GESNER information on the English names, which TURNER has carefully noted, and often added the pro∣vincial appellations. He takes in both sea and river fish, and includes also the scal∣lop and the cockle. This letter was writ∣ten from <HI>Weissenburgh,</HI> and is dated Nov. 1, 1557. He undoubtedly pursued this branch of zoology much farther; since it appears from his dedication to the queen, that he intended <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to set out a book of the names and natures of the fishes of her majesty's realms."</Q></P>
<P>But the work which secured his reputa∣tion to posterity, and entitled him to the
<PB N="67" REF="86"/>
character of an original writer on that sub∣ject, in <HI>England,</HI> is his "History of Plants," printed at different times, in three parts, in folio, with cuts. The first at <HI>London,</HI> in 1551, under this title, "A NEW HER∣BALL, wherein are contayned the names of herbes in Greeke, Latin, English, Duch, Frenche, and in the Potecaries and Herba∣ries Latin, with the properties, degrees, and natural places of the same gathered. For Steven Mierdman." <HI>Lond.</HI> 1551. The second part at <HI>Cologn,</HI> 1562, during his exile in the reign of <HI>Mary.</HI> With this was reprinted the first part; and his "Book on the Bathes of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI>"</P>
<P>In 1568 these were reprinted, with the addition of the third part, which bears the following title: "The third part of W<SUP>m</SUP> TURNER's HERBAL, wherein are contain∣ed the herbes, rootes, and fruytes, whereof is no mention made of <HI>Dioscorides, Galene, Plinye,</HI> and other old authors. Imprinted at <HI>Collen,</HI> by Arnold Birckman, in the year of our Lord 1566." The dedication, how∣ever, to the company of surgeons, is dated from <HI>Wells,</HI> June 24, 1564.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="87"/>
Dr. TURNER's "Herbal" is printed in the black letter, agreeably to the general usage of the times, and is embellished with the figures of most of the plants he de∣scribes.</P>
<P>The arrangement is alphabetical, accord∣ing to the Latin names; and, after the de∣scription, he frequently specifies the places of growth. He is ample in his discrimina∣tion of the species, as his great object was, to ascertain the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> of the an∣cients, and of DIOSCORIDES in particular, throughout the vegetable kingdom. To this end he bestows much criticism on the com∣mentaries of FUCHSIUS, TRAGUS, MAT∣THIOLUS, and other of his contemporaries; and professes to have corrected many of their mistakes, in the application of the names of DIOSCORIDES. In all this he has shewn much judgment, and, I may add, much moderation, in avoiding, more than usual, the licence taken by many of the commen∣tators, of applying the names of plants de∣scribed in THEOPHRASTUS, DIOSCORIDES, and PLINY, to those of the western parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> What he says of the virtues of
<PB N="69" REF="88"/>
plants, he has drawn from the ancients; but has, in numberless instances, given his opinion of their qualities, in opposition to those sages, and recorded his own experi∣ence of the virtues. He no where takes any doubtful plants upon trust, but appears to have examined them with all the preci∣sion usually exercised at a time when me∣thod, and principles now established, were unthought of; every where comparing them with the descriptions of the antients and moderns. He first gave names to many English plants; and, allowing for the time when specifical distinctions were not esta∣blished, when almost all the small plants were disregarded, and the <HI>Cryptogamia</HI> almost wholly overlooked, the number he was acquainted with, is much beyond what could easily have been imagined, in an ori∣ginal writer on his subject.</P>
<P>The third part of his "Herbal," dated from <HI>Welles,</HI> June 24, 1564, he dedicates to the company of surgeons; and apologizes for its imperfections: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Being so much vexed with sickness, and occupied with preaching, and the study of divinity, and
<PB N="70" REF="89"/>
exercise of discipline, I have had but small leisure to write Herballes."</Q></P>
<P>In this part, he professes to treat on the plants not known to DIOSCORIDES and the antients. It consists of near an hundred articles, among which we find introduced many of the exotic subjects, which had be∣fore been but little known; such as <HI>cassia fistula, cubebs, guaiacum, nutmegs, myroba∣lans, nux indica, nux vomica, anacardium, rhubarb, sarsaparilla, senna,</HI> and <HI>tamarinds.</HI> For these, many new figures were cut, which are executed in a stile superior to the others. The remainder are principally the productions of our own country.</P>
<P>The compleat edition of TURNER's "Her∣bal," in 1568, was printed at <HI>Cologn,</HI> un∣questionably to receive the advantage of the figures, probably at that time the property of <HI>Birkman</HI> the printer. They are the same with which the octavo edition of FUCHSIUS was first printed in 1545; in all five hun∣dred and twelve. Of these, TURNER has used upwards of four hundred; to which he has added about ninety new, making the whole number five hundred and two.
<PB N="71" REF="90"/>
There are some instances of the wrong ap∣plication of these figures; an error that might readily happen, when the author was at such a distance, and was common in al∣most all similar works of that time. There are also several figures to which no descrip∣tion of the plants can be found; for in∣stance, the six figures of the <HI>Geraniums</HI> from FUCHSIUS occur, with a slight mention of only two species in the text.</P>
<P>TURNER is the first author who has given a figure of the Lucern; which, I ap∣prehend, he first brought into <HI>England,</HI> and named <HI>Horned Clover.</HI> He treats largely of its cultivation, from PLINY, PALLA∣DIUS, and COLUMELLA.</P>
<P>In the dedication to the first edition of his "Herbal," in 1551, Dr. TURNER speaks in very respectful terms of the bo∣tanical knowledge of several of his con∣temporaries; and apologizes for his under∣taking so arduous a matter, while there were learned Englishmen better qualified. He enumerates Dr. CLEMENT, Dr. MERDY, <HI>Owen</HI> WOOTON, and Master FALCONER.
<PB N="72" REF="91"/>
The last-mentioned is several times introdu∣ced in the body of the work. I can scarcely doubt that he was <HI>John</HI> FALCONER, who is recorded as having communicated many English plants to AMATUS LUSITANUS, who taught physic at <HI>Ferrara</HI> and <HI>Ancona,</HI> and made himself known as a commentator on DIOSCORIDES in 1553. In treating on the <HI>Glaux,</HI> of which TURNER gives a new figure, he says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He never saw it in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> except in Master <HI>Falconer</HI>'s book; and that he brought it from <HI>Italy.</HI>"</Q> From this and other like citations, it may reason∣ably be conjectured, that "<HI>Falconer</HI>'s Book" was an <HI>Hortus Siccus;</HI> and if so, must have been among the earliest collections of that kind, that is noticed in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In appreciating the merit of Dr. TUR∣NER as a Botanist, due regard must be had to the time in which he lived; the little assistance he could derive from his contem∣poraries, of whom, BRUNSFELSIUS, RUEL∣LIUS, FUCHSIUS, and TRAGUS, when he published his first part of the "Herbal," were the chief; in which view, he will ap∣pear
<PB N="73" REF="92"/>
to have exhibited uncommon diligence and great erudition, and fully to deserve the character of an original writer.</P>
<P>Our author paid early attention to mine∣ral waters. He was probably the first who wrote on the baths of <HI>Bath,</HI> in <HI>Somerset∣shire.</HI> He visited several of the mineral springs in <HI>Germany, Switzerland,</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> and drew up, whilst abroad, a short account of ten of those waters; to which he pre∣fixed a more enlarged history of the waters of <HI>Bath.</HI> This was written, as it should seem, at <HI>Basil,</HI> and is dedicated to his <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"well∣beloved neighbours of <HI>Bath, Bristow, Wells, Winsam,</HI> and <HI>Charde,</HI>"</Q> March 10, 1557. He adjudged the principle of Bath water to be brimstone, and possibly a little copper, from the vicinity of that metal in the neigh∣bouring mountains. He says, he had been insormed, that, besides brimstone, the King's bath held alum, and the Cross bath salt∣petre; but that he could find neither. He concludes his account of the baths, by a set of general rules for all who drink mineral waters; many of which do him no discre∣dit,
<PB N="74" REF="93"/>
when compared with the injunctions of modern physicians.</P>
<P>Our author also wrote "On the Nature of Wines commonly used in <HI>England,</HI>" in vindication of the use of Rhenish wines. To this was annexed a tract "On the Na∣ture and Vertue of Treacle." But, as I never saw these treatises, I can give no ac∣count of them.</P>
<P>Dr. TURNER was the author of many polemical and religious treatises, chiefly written in defence of the Reformation. Of these, a list is given in the <HI>Athenae Oxonien∣ses,</HI> and a more accurate and enlarged one in Bishop TANNER's <HI>Bibliotheca.</HI> Several of his tracts are yet in manuscript, in vari∣ous libraries. He collated the translation of the Bible with Hebrew, Greek, and La∣tin copies, and corrected it in many places.</P>
<P>He procured to be printed at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> a new and corrected edition of the <HI>Historia Gentis nostrae,</HI> s. <HI>Angliae,</HI> written by <HI>William of Newburgh,</HI> from a manuscript he found in the library of <HI>Wells;</HI> but complains, that the printer not only omitted to insert cer∣tain
<PB N="75" REF="94"/>
articles sent by him, but left out the preface he sent him, substituting one of his own. Our author also translated several works from the Latin, particularly "The Comparison of the Old Learning and the New;" written by <HI>Urbanus Regius.</HI> Southwark. 1537. 8<SUP>o</SUP>; and again 1538 and 1548.</P>
<P>I will not conclude this short memoir of Dr. TURNER, without remarking, that the succeeding Herbalists, GERARD, JOHN∣SON, and PARKINSON, seem not to have paid due honour to his merit and learn∣ing, from the silence they observe rela∣ting to him in their writings. GERARD, indeed, mentions in his Preface, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that ex∣cellent work of master Dr. TURNER;"</Q> and, in another place, stiles him <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that ex∣cellent, painefull, and diligent physition, Mr. Dr. TURNER, of late memorie."</Q> In justice to TURNER, they should have noticed all the plants he has recorded, par∣ticularly the natives of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>RAY, at the distance of near a century, was sensible of his worth, having stiled
<PB N="76" REF="95"/>
him <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a man of solid erudition and judg∣ment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In honour of TURNER, his name has been annex∣ed, by <HI>Plumier,</HI> the French Botanist, to a new genus of plants, well known at this time in the English gardens.

<P>COntemporary with TURNER lived Dr. <HI>William</HI> BULLEYN. Although this writer does not come strictly within my plan; yet, as he lived at a period bar∣ren of interesting materials, and, as we learn from him several curious anecdotes respecting natural history and the state of gardening in England at that period, he cannot be passed over in silence.</P>
<P>Bishop TANNER briefly notices Dr. BUL∣LEYN, and his writings; but his life is amply written in the <HI>Biographia Britannica,</HI> to which I must principally be indebted for my information.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="97"/>
He was born in the Isle of <HI>Ely,</HI> in the early part of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth's reign, and was educated at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> though, as <HI>Wood</HI> says, he afterwards resided some time at <HI>Oxford.</HI> It appears that he had travelled over several parts of <HI>Germany;</HI> that he visit∣ed <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had taken many tours in his native country; in all which, he studied the natural productions with a zeal and success not common in that age. In an early period of his life, he was much con∣versant about the city os <HI>Norwich.</HI> In June 1550, he was instituted to the rectory of <HI>Blaxhall,</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> where his relations re∣sided. This preferment he resigned in 1554. Where he took the degree of doc∣tor in physic, is not ascertained; but, from his prior attachment to physic, his known opposition to the doctrine of Transubstan∣tiation, and the resignation of his living in the beginning of <HI>Mary</HI>'s reign, it may be fairly conjectured, that he did not take his degrees in that faculty till after that period, and probably abroad. Aster this, we find him removed to the city of <HI>Durham,</HI> where he practised physic, and became possessed of
<PB N="79" REF="98"/>
property in the salt-pans, near <HI>Tinmouth Castle.</HI> On the death of his patron, Sir Thomas <HI>Hilton,</HI> he removed to <HI>London,</HI> where he became a member of the college of physicians, and acquired reputation as a physician, and a man of learning. This event took place about the year 1560. He had the misfortune to lose great part of his library, with his manuscript upon "Healthfull Medicines," by shipwreck; and after this disaster, met with most un∣just and malevolent treatment, from a bro∣ther of Sir Thomas <HI>Hilton,</HI> by whom he was accused of having murdered his late patron, who died, in fact, of a malignant fever. And although his innocence was fully manifested, yet his enemy persisting further in his persecution, found means to throw him into prison, for debt, where he wrote a great part of his medical treatises. He died Jan. 7, 1576. He appears to have been much attached to the principles of the reformation. Bishop TANNER says he was a man of acute judgment and true piety.</P>
<P>I am not acquainted with any print of Dr. TURNER. Of Dr. BULLEYN there is
<PB N="80" REF="99"/>
a profile with a long beard, before his "Government of Health," and a whole length of him in wood prefixed to the "Bulwarke of Defence;" which book is a collection of most of his works. He was an ancestor of the late Dr. STUKELY, who, in 1722, was at the expence of having a small head of him engraved.</P>
<P>The part of his works, which has the nearest connection with my subject, is in his "Bulwark of Defence," in fol. 1562.</P>
<P>It is entitled, "A Book of Simples, be∣ing an HERBAL in the form of a dia∣logue, at the end of which are the cuts of some plants in wood." In this piece he observes, that <HI>tormentil,</HI> in pastures, prevents the rot in sheep; and adds, that the fact was confirmed by the shepherds in sundry parts of Norfolk. In his enumera∣tion of the virtues of simples, from other authors, he does not fail to record his own experience on the power of several, in re∣moving severe diseases. Of the effects of Dit∣tander, <HI>calamus aromaticus,</HI> the Daisy, and others, he adduces particular instances. It were to be wished, that succeeding observa∣tions,
<PB N="81" REF="100"/>
had confirmed his representation. His travels, and the great attention he had paid to the native productions of his own country, had given him a comprehensive view of the natural fertility of the soil, and climate of <HI>England;</HI> which, from the te∣nour of his writings, seems to have been, at that time, by some people much depreci∣ated. He opposes this idea with patriotic zeal and concern, and alleges various ex∣amples, to prove, that we had excellent apples, pears, plums, cherries, and hops, of our own growth, before the impor∣tation of these articles into <HI>England</HI> by the <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Kentish</HI> gardeners, but that the culture of them had been greatly ne∣glected. He endeavours to confirm the na∣tural fertility of the land, from the memor∣able instance of the <HI>sea pease,</HI> on the beach, near <HI>Orford</HI> and <HI>Aldborough;</HI> by an im∣mense crop of which the poor were pre∣served in a time of dearth, in the year 1555. Of which see further accounts in <HI>Johnson</HI>'s GERARD, p. 1250; PARKINSON's "<HI>Thea∣tre,</HI>" p. 1060; and LOBEL's <HI>Illustra∣tiones,</HI> p. 164.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="101"/>
To conclude, Dr. Bulleyn's specific knowledge of Botany seems to have been but slender. His zeal for the promotion of the useful arts of gardening, the general culture of the land, and the commercial in∣terests of the kingdom, deserved the highest praise, and for the information he has left of these affairs, in his own time, posterity owe him acknowledgments.</P>
<P>Although the progress of gardening does not enter into my plan, yet I am tempted, in this place, to remark, that, notwith∣standing culinary herbs and roots, and many fruits, are said to have been imported in the reign of HENRY <HI>the Eighth,</HI> from <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> and that the true aera of im∣provement in this art, cannot be carried, at the most remote time, beyond the same reign, yet it may justly be doubted, whether it was then in so low a state as hath been usually represented. With other arts, in its progression westwards, that of Horticul∣ture must be supposed to have reached the <HI>Low Countries</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> before <HI>England;</HI> and a general, and prior superiority to our neighbours may be granted; and that a
<PB N="83" REF="102"/>
fashion, and a too great fondness for ra∣rities of foreign growth, might influence the London market, of which the spirit of commerce would not fail to take advan∣tage, must likewise be admitted. But, to the arguments and proofs alledged by <HI>Dr.</HI> BULLEYN, in defence of the fertility of his native soil, and the perfection of our own products; and, as a proof of the suc∣cessful cultivation of those times, I add, that from an inspection of our old Herbals, and particularly of PARKINSON's <HI>Paradi∣sus,</HI> we find the various species of culinary herbs, roots, and of fruits, multiplied in <HI>England</HI> to such a variety, as implies a pre∣ceding course of culture carried on for a series of time, inconsistent with that po∣verty of produce which hath been sur∣mised.</P>

<HEAD>PENNY.</HEAD>
<P>Having introduced to the reader, the two first respectable writers on Botany in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> I cannot but regret my want of suf∣ficient information, to rescue from an al∣most total obscurity, the name of Dr.
<PB N="84" REF="103"/>
<HI>Thomas</HI> PENNY, an Englishman of the same age; who, although not an author himself, was indubitably a man of great attainments in the natural history, and especially in the Botany, of his time. GERARD stiles him <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A second <HI>Dioscorides,</HI> for his singular knowledge in plants."</Q> I cannot ascertain the date of his birth. It appears that he was a fellow of the royal college of physi∣cians, and that he had travelled into vari∣ous parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> He had resided in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and had visited, if not made some stay in, the island of <HI>Majorca.</HI> That he had diligently searched both the northern and southern parts of <HI>England</HI> is manifest, from the variety of rare plants discovered by him, and communicated to LOBEL and GERARD. He was personally known to GESNER and CAMERARIUS, and after∣wards frequently supplied them with rare plants, for their respective <HI>Herbaria</HI> and gardens.</P>
<P>During his residence in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> he collected many plants of that country, and from the confines of <HI>France.</HI> He assisted GESNER, as appears by his observations
<PB N="85" REF="104"/>
and animadversions on that author's tables, published by SCHMIEDEL from the col∣lections of TREW, in 1753, in which the most honourable testimony is given to his abilities. I suspect he was in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> at the time of GESNER's death, and assist∣ed WOLF in arranging the plants, and me∣morials of their deceased friend.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt that PENNY and CLUSIUS were also personally acquainted. They appear to have had a strict intimacy, and the latter was obliged to PENNY for a variety of curious articles inserted in his <HI>Rariores,</HI> and in the <HI>Exoticae.</HI> Dr. PENNY brought from <HI>Majorca</HI> the <HI>hypericum ba∣learicum,</HI> which CLUSIUS named <HI>myrto∣cistus</HI> PENNAEI after him, as he did a gen∣tian, now the <HI>swertia perennis.</HI> The same of the <HI>geranium tuberosum.</HI> The <HI>cornus her∣bacea,</HI> that beautiful native of the <HI>Cheviot</HI> hills, was first revealed to the curious by this industrious naturalist.</P>
<P>Dr. PENNY's acquirements in natural history extended beyond the knowledge of plants. He is one of the first Englishmen whom I have met with, who had studied
<PB N="86" REF="105"/>
insects. There are letters witten by him to CAMERARIUS, in the year 1585, preserved in TREW's collections, which prove his knowledge in <HI>entomology,</HI> to have been extensive in that day: and it is supposed by SCHMIEDEL, that GESNER's drawings of <HI>Papilio</HI>'s, passed into the hands of PENNY. This supposition is rendered more probable, when it is recollected, that the <HI>Theatrum Insectorum</HI> of MOUFET, was a work begun by <HI>Dr. Edward</HI> WOOTON, <HI>Conraae</HI> GESNER, and Dr. PENNY, and received only the finishing hand from MOU∣FET.</P>
<P>Dr. PENNY died in 1589, and is said by JUNGERMAN to have left his papers to MOUFET and TURNER; but, in this ac∣count there is surely a very striking ana∣chronism, since TURNER himself died in the year 1568.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>LYTE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HENRY</HI> LYTE, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of an ancient fa∣mily, at <HI>Lytes-Carey,</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> was the next after TURNER who published an <HI>English Herbal.</HI> He was born in 1529, and became a student at <HI>Oxford</HI> in the lat∣ter end of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. about the year 1546. He afterwards travelled; and at length re∣tired to his patrimony, where, as <HI>Wood</HI> says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"by the advantage of a good foundation of literature made in the university and abroad, he became a most excellent scho∣lar in several sorts of learning."</Q> He was the author of various publications of the historical kind, which are enumerated in the <HI>Athenae Oxonienses.</HI> He died at the age of 78,
<PB N="89" REF="108"/>
and was buried at <HI>Charlton-Mackerel,</HI> in the same county. He left a son, who drew up a genealogy of <HI>James</HI> I. for which the king rewarded him with his picture in gold, set with diamonds; and the prince, afterwards <HI>Charles</HI> I. gave him also his picture in gold.</P>
<P>Although Mr. LYTE does not rank a∣mong original writers in Botany, his work nevertheless seems to have been well re∣ceived. Even the arrangement alone would instantly give it a great advantage over <HI>Turner</HI>'s book. It is professedly a transla∣tion from the French version of the Dutch Herbal of DODOENS, written by the au∣thor in 1553, and translated by <HI>Clusius</HI> in 1557; being the first of his publications. Of DODOENS, it will be necessary to give some account; but I shall defer it till I speak of GERARD, as the improved editions of DO∣DOENS's book were the basis of that au∣thor's work.</P>
<P>The first edition of LYTE's Herbal was published at <HI>Antwerp.</HI> It is printed in the black letter, and bears the following title:</P>
<P>"A NIEWE HERBALL, or HISTORIE OF
<PB N="90" REF="109"/>
PLANTES, wherein is contayned the whole discourse and perfect description of all sorts of herbs and plantes; their divers and sun∣dry kindes; their straunge figures, fashions, and shapes; their names, natures, and ope∣rations and vertues: and that not only of those which are here growyng in this our countrie of Englande, but of all others also of forayne realmes, commonly used in phy∣sicke. First set forth in the Doutche or Almaigne tongue, by that learned D. <HI>Rem∣bert</HI> DODOENS, physition to the emperor; and now first translated by
"<HI>Henry</HI> LYTE, <HI>Esquyer.</HI>
At London, by me, <HI>Gerard Dewes.</HI> 1578."—The Colophon, "imprinted at <HI>Antwerpe,</HI> by me, <HI>Henry Loe,</HI> book-printer." pp. 779.</P>
<P>Mr. LYTE dedicates his work to queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and has prefixed the preface and appendix in Latin, from DODOENS, or DODONAEUS. The latter of these is a col∣lection from DIOSCORIDES and CATO, but chiefly from PLINY, relating to the rise and progress of botanical and agricultural
<PB N="91" REF="110"/>
knowledge among the Romans; and in commendation of gardens, with rules for laying them out, and managing them to advantage.</P>
<P>He has followed his original in dividing his subjects into six books; and, although the general arrangement is confused, LYTE has the merit of having introduced a parti∣cular order in each chapter, or genus, much superior to that of TURNER; having di∣vided the species, description, place, time, names, nature, and virtues, under these se∣veral titles, into distinct sections. This ar∣rangement was adopted by GERARD and PARKINSON.</P>
<P>LYTE describes one thousand and fifty species, of which eight hundred and seventy are figured. The blocks are, I believe, the same with which CLUSIUS's own transla∣tion was printed; being, as far as those ex∣tend, copies from the octavo edition of FUCHSIUS. Most of TURNER's figures are found in LYTE. The remainder are such as had been cut for the subsequent works of DODOENS, and afterwards embellished the <HI>Pemptades</HI> of that author, and GERARD's
<PB N="92" REF="111"/>
history. The English translator added about thirty new ones. Among these, several are in a style superior to those of CLUSIUS and GERARD; such are particularly, the <HI>Salvia Aethiops;</HI> the <HI>Stratiotes aloides;</HI> the <HI>Rha,</HI> or <HI>Centaurea Rhaponticum;</HI> and others.</P>
<P>Some are original: I cite only the <HI>Erica Tetralix,</HI> of which I find no figure prior to <HI>Lyte</HI>'s; that of GERARD (or, which is the same, of <HI>Clusius</HI>) applied to it by JOHN∣SON, being certainly intended to represent another species, and is accordingly referred to the <HI>Mediterranea</HI> by LINNAEUS.</P>
<P>The first edition of <HI>Lyte</HI> is adorned with a finely-cut impression in wood of DODO∣ENS, in the thirty-fifth year of his age; and a large engraving of Mr. <HI>Lyte</HI>'s coat of arms.</P>
<P>This first edition was undoubtedly printed at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> to receive the advantage of the figures. The subsequent editions, there∣fore, afterwards printed in <HI>England,</HI> are without figures. It was reprinted, as <HI>Ames</HI> informs us, in 1586, and in 1595; and, according to <HI>Wood,</HI> by <HI>Ninion Newton,</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> in 1589, in quarto also, without
<PB N="93" REF="112"/>
cuts. I find editions mentioned, with the dates 1600 and 1619, which, if genuine, and not in the title-page only, is a proof of its popularity; and that it was not super∣seded by the larger work of GERARD in 1597. SEGUIER even quotes one, so late as the year 1678.</P>
<P>As in the interval between the publica∣tion of CLUSIUS's French translation in 1557, and the English version of it by LYTE in 1578, the author had at different times compleated the several parts of his <HI>Historiae Plantarum,</HI> it may be presumed, that LYTE profited by those works. From some of the commendatory verses prefixed, it should seem, that <HI>Dodoens</HI> himself com∣municated additions to LYTE. As I have not had an opportunity of comparing the French version of <HI>Clusius</HI> with LYTE, I cannot notice the nature of his alterations, or the extent of his additions. The intro∣duction of the English names was a neces∣sary augmentation.</P>
<P>In the mean time, there seems to be no ground for the criticism of THRELKELD; who accuses LYTE of having omitted the
<PB N="94" REF="113"/>
<HI>Purgantium Historia</HI> of DODONAEUS, of which LYTE appears unquestionably to have introduced the most material subjects.</P>
<P>English Botany, however, received little or no accession from LYTE himself. It is not in more than about twenty instances, that he has even pointed out the local situ∣ation of any rare English plants; and, in these instances, there is scarcely one, which had not been thus <HI>specifically</HI> recorded by TURNER and LOBEL, before him.</P>
<P>Hence, I am not able to give LYTE the credit, although he lived at so early a pe∣riod, of being the first discoverer of a sin∣gle species of rare growth. Yet, as it is but justice to suppose him well acquainted with all the common plants, so a large number of these, which had been unnoticed by TURNER, or are not easily ascertained in his work, will be found first announced to the English Botanist in LYTE. I con∣fess, however, that it is extremely difficult to determine, in a variety of instances, whe∣ther the general places of growth, as men∣tioned in this author, are inserted from his own knowledge, or whether they stand as
<PB N="95" REF="114"/>
translated by him from CLUSIUS. It is this doubt that has induced me, not unfre∣quently, to ascribe to GERARD, or JOHN∣SON, the first knowledge of many common plants certainly ascertained by them, that occur, nevertheless, in LYTE's work.</P>
<P>This author furnishes very few observa∣tions which tend to illustrate the state of the science, between the time of TURNER and his own. Nor does he mention, in more than one or two instances, any of his contemporaries. Under the article <HI>Verbas∣cum,</HI> he speaks of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the pleasant garden of <HI>James Champaigne,</HI> the deer friende and lover of plantes:"</Q> but without any infor∣mation of his character, or place of abode. And, under that of <HI>Sweet Trefoil,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the garden of maister Rich."</Q></P>

<HEAD>LOBEL.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MATTHIAS de</HI> LOBEL, though not a native of <HI>Britain,</HI> contributed so largely to the emolument of English Bo∣tany, that he justly claims attention in the object of this work. LOBEL was of Fle∣mish extraction, and was born in 1538 at <HI>Lisle,</HI> where his father was in the profes∣sion of the law.</P>
<P>He informs us, that, at the age of six∣teen, he was enamoured with the love of
<PB N="97" REF="116"/>
plants; and had an unconquerable desire to know the names and properties of those used in physic. He studied at <HI>Montpelier,</HI> under the famous RONDELETIUS. Dur∣ing his residence there, he travelled over the south of <HI>France</HI> in search of simples.</P>
<P>At <HI>Narbone</HI> he formed a connection with <HI>Peter</HI> PENA, who was jointly concerned with him in his first work the <HI>Adversaria.</HI> On leaving <HI>France,</HI> he extended his researches by travelling over <HI>Switzerland,</HI> the county of <HI>Tyrol,</HI> some parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> and on his return settled as a physician at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and afterwards at <HI>Delft.</HI> He was then made physician to <HI>William</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and to the States of <HI>Holland.</HI> On what occasion he removed into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> or at what period of his life, I cannot ascertain. From the circumstance how∣ever of the <HI>Adversaria</HI> bearing date at <HI>Lon∣don</HI> in 1570, it should seem to have been before that time, which opinion is some∣what corroborated, by his informing us, that Dr. TURNER had given him, "long before," the seeds of the <HI>sea kale.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>England,</HI> he obtained the patronage of
<PB N="98" REF="117"/>
<HI>Lord Zouch,</HI> whom he attended in 1592, in his embassy to the court of <HI>Denmark.</HI> This tour furnished him with further means of augmenting his knowledge in Botany; and, through the correspondence he formed there, of introducing into <HI>England</HI> several exotic rarities, before that time un∣known to this country. He had the superin∣tendance of a garden at <HI>Hackney,</HI> which he calls a physic-garden, cultivated at the ex∣pence of his patron. He was afterwards stiled Botanist to King <HI>James,</HI> as appears by the <HI>imprimatur</HI> to the second edition of the <HI>Adversaria;</HI> and by his own letter prefixed to GERARD's "Herbal." Whether any emolument was annexed to this title, I am unable to decide. He had a daughter married to a Mr. <HI>James</HI> COEL, who lived at <HI>Highgate,</HI> near <HI>London;</HI> and it is pro∣bable, from the very frequent mention that LOBEL makes of that place in his last work, the <HI>Illustrationes,</HI> that he resided in the latter years of his life with his son-in-law.</P>
<P>He died in 1616, aged 78. There was a print of LOBEL, but it is very scarce, I have
<PB N="99" REF="118"/>
only seen it in the collection of the late Mr. <HI>Gulston.</HI></P>
<P>The first of LOBEL's publications, and which more eminently agrees with the de∣sign of this work, as it brought a large ac∣cession to English Botany, was the <HI>Stirpium Adversaria.</HI> The professed intention of this work was to investigate the Botany and <HI>materia medica</HI> of the antients, and parti∣cularly of DIOSCORIDES; and LOBEL is judged to have corrected the errors of MATTHIOLUS, upon that author, in many instances.</P>
<P>As PENA was jointly concerned with LOBEL in this work, it is become impos∣sible, at this time, to assign to each their separate share. The first edition of the <HI>Adversaria,</HI> dated at <HI>London</HI> 1570, was dedicated to the queen. This dedication was omitted in an edition printed at <HI>Ant∣werp</HI> in 1576. Editions bearing date 1571, 1572, are recorded, but it may be doubted whether these were more than title-page alterations. To that of the whole <HI>Adver∣saria,</HI> which bears date London 1605, by <HI>Purfoot</HI> also, is prefixed LOBEL's <HI>Animad∣versiones</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="119"/>
<HI>in Rondeletii methodicam Pharma∣ceuticam officinam;</HI> containing 156 pages. After this, the title, and a dedication to the professors at <HI>Montpelier,</HI> printed by <HI>Pur∣foot;</HI> but the succeeding first part of the <HI>Ad∣versaria,</HI> is on a much better paper, and in a finer type, and evidently printed by <HI>Plantin</HI> as far as to page 450; to which succeeds one leaf, added in <HI>Purfoot</HI>'s type, contain∣ing the account of the <HI>Plocamos</HI> of <HI>Port∣land,</HI> and of the <HI>Barnacle,</HI> the fabulous history of which he relates, without wholly denying it. Then follows, (the pages being continued,) the second part of the <HI>Adver∣saria,</HI> now first printed by the <HI>London</HI> printer. To which is annexed, LOBEL's "Tract on the Balsams, Cinnamon, Cas∣sia," and various other matters; with a small treatise on the dropsy, and the <HI>ele∣phantiasis,</HI> written by his much reverenced master RONDELETIUS.</P>
<P>The second edition bears the following title, "<HI>Dilucidae Simplicium Medicamentorum explicationes, et</HI> STIRPIUM ADVERSARIA, <HI>perfacilis vestigatio, luculentaque accessio ad priscorum, praesertim Dioscoridis et recentiorum</HI>

<P>Reprinted at Frankfort in 1651.</P>
<P>In the execution of this work, there is exhibited, I believe, the first sketch, rude as it is, of a natural method of arrange∣ment; which, however, extends no far∣ther than throwing the plants into large tribes, families, or orders, according to the external appearance, or habit of the whole plant or flower; without establish∣ing any definitions or characters. The whole forms forty-four tribes. Some con∣tain
<PB N="102" REF="121"/>
the plants of one, or two modern <HI>ge∣nera:</HI> others many; and some, it must be confessed, very incongruous to each other. On the whole, they are much superior to DODOENS's divisions; and sufficiently tes∣tify, that the author was sensible of the want of a better arrangement than the mere alphabetic order, or that formed from the supposed qualities, and uses in medicine.</P>
<P>At the head of each tribe, or family, he prefixes a synoptical view of all the species to be described under it. His method, then, is to give the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> name; and, wherever he can, the name of the genus and species, in <HI>German, Dutch, French,</HI> and <HI>English.</HI> Then the description of the plant, the time of flowering, the country in which it grows spontaneously; and, in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> he points out the particular spot, where some of the more rare are found: Mr. RAY, however, has remarked, that in this respect LOBEL has been inaccurate, or trusted too much to his memory; since many have been sought for in vain, in the situations he specified. Frequent reference is made in the margin to the figures in
<PB N="103" REF="122"/>
FUCHSIUS, MATTHIOLUS, DODONAEUS, as far as p. 200; after which, this assistance is wanting. LOBEL's own figures are small, and insufficient in many cases to express the habit of the plant, the delineation of which, was almost the extent of the efforts of those days.</P>
<P>LOBEL having carefully studied the an∣tients, on the <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> having tra∣velled much, and seen plants in various countries, was enabled to exercise critical skill, and to detect numerous errors in the dispensation of simples, which he does not fail to point out. His strong attachment to the study interested him powerfully in the investigation of new plants, and enabled him to make large accessions to knowledge. He travelled over various parts of <HI>England,</HI> and discovered many vegetables before unnoticed. He added to the <HI>grasses</HI> a number of new species; and, although his stile is univer∣sally condemned as harsh and incorrect, and his descriptions frequently obscure and in∣sufficient, the <HI>Adversaria</HI> has, on the whole, great merit, abounding with much curious intelligence, and some new discoveries.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="123"/>
The second part of the <HI>Adversaria</HI> is but a small part of the whole. It presents us with a list of one hundred and thirty spe∣cies of grasses, known to the author: this is followed by the figures and descriptions of some new and rare kinds, of the same tribe. A number of new plants of the liliaceous and bulbous-rooted order; a copious ac∣count, with a figure, of the <HI>yucca,</HI> lately introduced; concluding with a catalogue from CLUSIUS, of thirty-eight varieties of <HI>Anemone</HI>—a proof of the flourishing state of the Florist's art, in the beginning of the last century; at which time it is certain, from LOBEL's book, that many people were very assiduous in the cultivation of exotics.</P>
<P>In 1576, LOBEL published a book, well known, and much quoted since, by the name of "OBSERVATIONES; <HI>sive Stirpium Historiae, cui annexum est Adversariorum Vo∣lumen. In fol. cum Iconibus.</HI>"</P>
<P>By the assistance of <HI>Plantin,</HI> this volume was accompanied with 1486 figures, which had been cut for the works of CLUSIUS, MATTHIOLUS, and DODONAEUS.</P>
<P>In 1581 it was translated into Dutch, to∣gether
<PB N="105" REF="124"/>
with the <HI>Adversaria,</HI> and the figures augmented to the number of 2116. The same year the <HI>icons</HI> were separately cast off, on paper of the oblong form; the figures amounting to 2191. Some of these im∣pressions were accompanied with an index, in seven languages, which rendered it a very popular book for many years. It preserves some value to this day, as being the edi∣tion that LINNAEUS quotes throughout his works.</P>
<P>LOBEL had meditated a very large work, which was to have borne the title of "IL∣LUSTRATIONES PLANTARUM;" but he lived not to finish it. Some of his papers fell into the hands of PARKINSON, and were incorporated into his <HI>Theatrum.</HI> A frag∣ment of the above-mentioned work was published by Dr. How, in 1655; which contains the descriptions of many grasses, and other plants newly discovered, or lately introduced. Of the grasses, many here re∣corded were first discovered by LOBEL. The preface contains some severe censures on GERARD, and reflexions on the treatment LOBEL had received from booksellers; all
<PB N="106" REF="125"/>
written in a stile very reprehensible in a man of letters. He may be justly accused of uncandid and disingenuous conduct to∣wards GERARD, whom, while living, he had treated with the appearance of friend∣ship and esteem, and of whose abilities, and zeal, he had spoken in the highest terms; as is manifest in various parts of the <HI>Ad∣versaria,</HI> in the attestation to the catalogue of GERARD's Garden, and by the recom∣mendatory letter prefixed to his Herbal.</P>

<P>There is "an Herbal to the Bible," said to be written by <HI>Thomas</HI> NEWTON, and printed in 1587. 8<SUP>o</SUP>. This author, after having practised physic, became a divine and schoolmaster, at <HI>Ilford,</HI> in <HI>Essex;</HI> where he died in 1607.

<HEAD>GERARD.</HEAD>
<P>LOBEL's writings, howsoever esteem∣ed by the learned, having never been translated into English, could not become popular; and, at the conclusion of the six∣teenth century, TURNER's book was, pro∣bably no less obsolete, than LYTE's was imperfect. These circumstances, conspiring with the growing taste of the times for gar∣dening, it may be presumed, incited GE∣RARD to undertake his Herbal: a work which maintained its credit and esteem for more than a century; and, pleasing as it is to reflect on the rapid progress and im∣provement of Botany, within the last half century, yet there are many now living who
<PB N="111" REF="130"/>
can recollect, that when they were young in science, there was no better source of Bota∣nical intelligence, in the <HI>English</HI> tongue, than the Herbals of GERARD and PARK∣INSON.</P>
<P>It has been observed, that the early edi∣tion of DODOENS's book, as translated by CLUSIUS, had been the basis of LYTE's Herbal; and, as the last edition of the same author became the foundation of GE∣RARD's, this circumstance renders it not unsuitable here to take some notice of an author, although a foreigner, to whom he owed so much of that credit, which has preserved his memory to the present times.</P>
<P><HI>Rembert</HI> DODOENS, or DODONAEUS, was born in 1517, near <HI>Mechlin</HI> in <HI>Flanders.</HI> He became conspicuous for his various eru∣dition when young; was physician for some time to the Emperor <HI>Maximilian,</HI> and his son <HI>Rodolph</HI> II. The importunity of his friends procured his dismission from the Emperor's service, and he settled at <HI>Ant∣werp;</HI> was afterwards professor at <HI>Leyden,</HI> and died in 1586. He wrote on astronomy, geography, and physic; but is remembered
<PB N="112" REF="131"/>
now, principally, by his botanical works. His attachment to this study, and the op∣portunities he enjoyed of gratifying it, en∣abled him to turn it to the most advantage∣ous purposes. He began to publish in 1552, and continued his accessions and improve∣ments to the year 1583, when he collected all his writings, on this subject, into one volume, under the following title, "STIR∣PIUM HISTORIAE PEMPTADES <HI>Sex, sive Libri</HI> XXX. <HI>Ant. ex officin. Plant.</HI>" <HI>in folio. cum icon.</HI> 1341. <HI>pp.</HI> 872. Each Pemptade is divided into five books.</P>
<P>The 1st comprehends a number of dis∣similar plants in alphabetic order.</P>
<P N="2">2. Flower-garden plants; and the um∣belliferous tribe.</P>
<P N="3">3. Medicinal roots: purgative plants: climbing and poisonous plants: ferns, mosses, and fungi.</P>
<P N="4">4. Grain: pulse: grasses: water and marsh plants.</P>
<P N="5">5. Edible plants: gourd plants: esculent roots: oleraceous: thistles and spinose plants.</P>
<P N="6">6. Shrubs and trees.</P>
<P>It was reprinted in 1612 and 1616, with
<PB N="113" REF="132"/>
some small additions, and being translated also into Dutch, with great enlargement, became a popular book in that language.</P>
<P>The judicious selection of all that was useful, relating to the supposed plants of the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> of DIOSCORIDES, and of the Arabians, the introduction of all the new species from CLUSIUS, and other dis∣coveries of the time, added to the instruction and embellishment derived from the figures, which exceeded in number those of any preceding author, rendered <HI>Dodoens</HI>'s book useful to the medical profession throughout the world. It still preserves some value, as being referred to by LINNAEUS, for the illustration of the European plants.</P>
<P>As GERARD could not attempt an entire new work, there was then extant no other to which he could give the preference, as a basis to his design; for as such only it must be considered, since the interval of time between the publication of DODO∣NAEUS's work in 1583, and the printing of his own "Herbal," had given him opportuni∣ties to intersperse large additions, both in exotic, and indigenous Botany. In this in∣terval
<PB N="114" REF="133"/>
the science had been augmented, and not less enriched, by the writings of CAE∣SALPINUS, in 1583; by the <HI>Epitomé</HI> of CAMERARIUS, in 1586; by the <HI>Historia Lugdunensis</HI> of DALECHAMP, in 1587; by the <HI>Sylva Harcynia</HI> of THALIUS; and es∣pecially by the <HI>Historia</HI> and <HI>Icones</HI> of TA∣BERNAEMONTANUS, in 1588 and 1590.</P>
<P>To these may be added, a number of collateral resources, which the growing commerce and spirit of the times rendered favourable to his purposes. I will briefly mention the following: the <HI>Materia Me∣dica</HI> had, for a series of years, been per∣petually augmenting, by a variety of new drugs, which were eagerly sought after, the origin of which, notwithstanding, was in many instances obscure, and in others as yet unknown. At length the publication of GARCIAS <HI>ab</HI> HORTO on the simples of the East Indies, of MONARDES on those of the West, and afterwards of <HI>Christopher à</HI> COSTA's book, satisfied, for a time, the impatience of the public.</P>
<P>These authors were translated into Eng∣lish. <HI>James</HI> FRAMPTON, a merchant of
<PB N="115" REF="134"/>
London, who had resided long at <HI>Seville,</HI> from whence he returned in 1576, trans∣lated MONARDES into English the next year, under the title of "Joyful News out of the New Founde World, from the Spa∣nish of <HI>Monardus,</HI>" in 4<SUP>o</SUP>. CLUSIUS put GARCIAS <HI>ab</HI> HORTO into Latin, in 1567; and <HI>James</HI> GARET had also translated from the Spanish the work of <HI>à</HI> COSTA. These books were incentives to curiosity; and the thousand novelties which were brought into <HI>England</HI> by our circumnavigators, RA∣LEIGH and CAVENDISH, in 1580 and 1588, excited a degree of attention, which at this day cannot, without the aid of con∣siderable recollection, be easily conceived. RALEIGH himself appears to have pos∣sessed a larger share of taste for the curious productions of nature, than was common to the seafaring adventurers of that period. And posterity will rank these voyagers among the greatest benefactors to this kingdom, in having been the means, if tradition may be credited, of introducing the most useful root that Providence has held forth for the ser∣vice of man. A voyage round the globe, how∣soever
<PB N="116" REF="135"/>
familiarized in ours, was in that age a most interesting and fruitful occasion of enquiry.</P>
<P>The return of RALEIGH, and the fame of his manifold discoveries and collections, brought over from the continent the cele∣brated CLUSIUS, then in the 55th year of his age. He, who added more to the stock of Botany in his day, than all his contem∣poraries united, visited ENGLAND, for the third time, to partake, at this critical junc∣ture, in the general gratification.</P>
<P>At this eventful period, GERARD was in the vigour of life, and without doubt felt the influence, and reaped the advantage of all the circumstances I have enumerated.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> GERARD was born at <HI>Nantwich,</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> in the year 1545, and was edu∣cated a surgeon. He removed to <HI>London,</HI> where he obtained the patronage of the great <HI>Lord Burleigh,</HI> who was himself a lover of plants, and had the best collection in his garden of any nobleman in the king∣dom. GERARD had the superintendance of this fine garden, and retained his em∣ployment, as he tells us himself, for twenty
<PB N="117" REF="136"/>
years. He lived in <HI>Holborn,</HI> where also he had a large <HI>physic</HI> garden of his own; which was probably the first of the kind in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> for the number and variety of its pro∣ductions. It should seem, that in his younger days he had taken a voyage into the Baltic, since he mentions having seen the wild pines growing about <HI>Narva.</HI></P>
<P>GERARD appears also to have been fa∣voured by the college of physicians, and is highly extolled by Dr. BULLEYN. Both LOBEL, and Dr. BROWNE, physician to the queen, wrote, in Latin, commendatory letters to him, on the publication of his Herbal. He attained to such eminence in his profession, as to be chosen master of the company. He died about the year 1607.</P>
<P>There is a half sheet print of GERARD prefixed to his own edition of the "Her∣bal," done in the 53d year of his age, and a small oval one at the bottom of a full half sheet frontispiece, before JOHNSON's edi∣tion.</P>
<P>The earliest publication of GERARD was the list of his own garden in Holborn,
<PB N="118" REF="137"/>
under the following title, "<HI>Catalogus Ar∣borum, Fruticum, ac Plantarum, tam indige∣narum quam exoticarum, in horto</HI> JOHANNIS GERARDI, <HI>civis ac chirurgi Londinensis nas∣centium.</HI> Impensis J. Norton, 1596." 4<SUP>o</SUP>. and again in 1599.</P>
<P>The first edition was dedicated to Lord BURLEIGH; but that nobleman dying be∣fore the publication of the second, it was inscribed to his patron, <HI>Sir Walter</HI> RA∣LEIGH.</P>
<P>This little piece, from the nature of the publication, is become very scarce. I be∣lieve there is only a manuscript copy of it in the collection of <HI>Sir</HI> JOSEPH BANKS.</P>
<P>We are informed, in the life of Dr. BUL∣LEYN, that GERARD's Garden contained near eleven hundred sorts of plants, of fo∣reign and domestic growth; from whence, says Mr. <HI>Oldys,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it may appear, that our ground would produce other fruits be∣sides hips and haws, acorns and pignuts;"</Q> for at this time, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"kitchen-garden wares were imported from Holland, and fruits from France."</Q> There are one thousand
<PB N="119" REF="138"/>
and thirty-three species in this Catalogue, and the following attestation, written by LOBEL, is annexed.</P>
<P>"<HI>Herbas, stirpes, frutices, suffrutices, et ar∣busculas hoc catalogo recensitas, quamplurimas ac fere omnes me vidisse Londini in horto Jo∣hanni</HI> GERARDI, <HI>chirurgi et botanici per∣optimi (non enim omnes eodem sed variis tem∣poribus anni pullulascunt, enascuntur et flo∣rent). Attestor Matthias De</HI> LOBELL, <HI>ipsis calendis Junii</HI> 1596."</P>
<P>In 1597, came out his "HERBAL, or GENERAL HISTORY OF PLANTS;" printed by John Norton, in folio; and some authors mention another impression in 1599.</P>
<P>That the foundation of this work was a translation of DODOENS's Herbal, a compa∣rison of the two ascertains beyond a doubt. LOBEL, both in his animadversions on RON∣DELETIUS, and in his <HI>Stirpium Illustratio∣nes,</HI> informs us, that Dr. PRIEST, at the expence of Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> had been engaged to make a translation of DODONAEUS's <HI>Pemp∣tades;</HI> and, dying soon after he had finished it, the manuscript came into GERARD's
<PB N="120" REF="139"/>
hands; who has been censured for having endeavoured to conceal his possessing these papers, and for assuming to himself the me∣rit of the translation, when it is generally agreed, that his knowledge of the Latin language was not equal to such an under∣taking. LOBEL, indeed, judged the same of Dr. PRIEST, and points out instances of his insufficiency. It must, however, be al∣lowed, that GERARD is not backward in confessing his want of skill in the learned languages. LOBEL farther informs us, that when the work was in the press, and that part of the first book printed relating to grasses, his friend, <HI>James</HI> GARET, a person eminently skilled in flowers and exotics, ad∣monished <HI>Norton</HI> of some gross errors; on which, the printer engaged LOBEL to su∣perintend the work; that he actually did correct it "in a thousand places;" and that there were many other mistakes, which GERARD would not allow him to alter, alleging that it was sufficiently correct, and that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"LOBEL had forgotten the English language."</Q></P>
<P>In order further to conceal his plagiarism,
<PB N="121" REF="140"/>
LOBEL adds, that he has inverted the distri∣bution of the chapters in DODOENS's book, and adopted that of the <HI>Adversaria.</HI> This may be considered as a futile objection, and even turned into an approbation of LOBEL's method; but he charges him also with largely plundering the <HI>Adversaria,</HI> without any acknowledgment.</P>
<P>GERARD comprises the whole vegetable kingdom in three books. The <HI>first</HI> con∣tains the grasses, grain, rushes, reeds, flags, and bulbous-rooted plants. The <HI>second,</HI> all herbs used in diet, physic, or for ornament and pleasure. The <HI>third,</HI> trees, shrubs, fruit∣bearing plants, rosins, gums, roses, heaths, mosses, mushrooms, and sea plants. The whole divided into upwards of eight hun∣dred chapters, which, in the arrangement of that time, may, if the expression is al∣lowable, be considered as so many genera.</P>
<P>In each chapter the several species are described; then follow the place, time of flowering, names, and virtues.</P>
<P>The figures Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> procured from <HI>Frankfort,</HI> being the same blocks which had been used for the Dutch Herbal of TABER∣NAEMONTANUS
<PB N="122" REF="141"/>
in 1588. In this manner, GERARD, with DODOENS for his founda∣tion, by taking in also many plants from CLUSIUS, and from LOBEL, by the addition of some from his own stock, published a volume, which, from its being well timed, from its comprehending almost the whole of the subjects then known, by being writ∣ten in English, and ornamented with a more numerous set of figures than had ever ac∣companied any work of the kind in this kingdom, obtained great repute. To this we must add the fortunate circumstance of its acquiring afterwards so learned an edi∣tor as JOHNSON, which established the cha∣racter of it, and gave it precedence as a po∣pular book, for more than a century. And notwithstanding his manifest inferiority to LOBEL in point of learning, it must yet be owned, that GERARD contributed greatly to bring forward the knowledge of plants in <HI>England.</HI> His connection with the great, and his situation in <HI>London,</HI> favoured an ex∣tensive correspondence, both with foreigners and his own countrymen; and his success in procuring new exotics, as well as scarce
<PB N="123" REF="142"/>
indigenous plants, was equal to his diligence and assiduity. In fact, we owe to GERARD and his friends the discovery of many new English plants; and his name will be re∣membered by botanists with esteem, when the utility of his Herbal is superseded. That he was considered as possessing a very extensive share of this science, we are justified in believing, on the testimony of Mr. <HI>George</HI> BAKER, chief surgeon to the queen, who assures us, that he saw him <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"tried with one of the best strangers that ever came into <HI>England,</HI> and was ac∣counted in <HI>Paris</HI> the only man, being recommended to me," says BAKER, "by that famous man, AMBROSE PAREY; and he being here, was desirous to go abroad with some of our herbarists, for the which I was the mean to bring them together, and one whole day we spent therein, searching the rarest simples: but when it came to the trial, my French∣man did not know one to his four<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PLUMIER gave the name GERARDIA to a plant of the <HI>didynamous</HI> class, discovered in thetropical regions of America; to which LINNAEUS has since added five spe∣cies.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="143"/>
Among the many who promoted GE∣RARD's work by their communications, I must not omit the names of <HI>Thomas</HI> HES∣KETH, of <HI>Lancashire; Thomas</HI> EDWARDS, apothecary, at <HI>Exeter;</HI> both skilled in the knowledge of English plants.</P>
<P><HI>James</HI> GARET, of <HI>London,</HI> apothecary, "a curious searcher of simples." He was the correspondent of CLUSIUS, to whom he communicated a great number of natu∣ral curiosities, particularly of exotic growth, and is mentioned with great respect by that learned foreigner, in numerous places of his <HI>Libri Exoticorum.</HI> He seems to have been one of the principal cultivators of tulips, which he propagated by seeds and bulbs for twenty years, every season bringing forth, as GERARD observes, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"new plants of sun∣dry colours not before seen, all which to describe particularly, were to roll <HI>Sisi∣phus</HI>'s stone, or number the sands."</Q></P>
<P>I find three persons of the same name, <HI>James</HI> GARET the father, and <HI>James</HI> the son, and <HI>Peter,</HI> as I suppose, the brother of <HI>James</HI> the elder. PARKINSON, speaking probably of the last, informs us, that he was originally a druggist in Lime-street.
<PB N="125" REF="144"/>
He was, I believe, the translator of <HI>à</HI> COS∣TA, as hath been before noted.</P>
<P>Mr. Bredwell, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"practitioner in physic, a learned and diligent searcher of simples,"</Q> in the west of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nicholas</HI> LETE, a merchant of Lon∣don, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"greatly in love with rare and faire flowers, for which he doth carefully send into <HI>Syria,</HI> having a servant there at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and in many other countries; for which myself and the whole land are much bound unto him."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>John</HI> MERSHE, of <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>James</HI> COLE, a merchant of <HI>London,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a lover of plants, and very skilful in the knowledge of them."</Q></P>
<P>Among those of eminent station, who patronised the science, GERARD does due honour to Sir <HI>Walter</HI> RALEIGH; Lord <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> ZOUCH, the patron of LOBEL, who brought plants and seeds with him from <HI>Constantinople;</HI> and to Lord HUNSDON, Lord High Chamberlain of <HI>England,</HI> who, he says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is worthy of triple honour for his care in getting, as also for his curi∣ous keeping, such rare and strange things from the farthest parts of the world."</Q></P>

<P>In the army, he had the rank of lieute∣nant colonel to Sir <HI>Marmaduke</HI> RAWDON, governor of <HI>Basinghouse.</HI> Mr. <HI>Granger</HI> in∣forms us, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he set fire to the <HI>Grange,</HI> near that fortress, which consisted of twenty houses, and killed and burnt about three hundred of Sir William <HI>Waller</HI>'s men, wounded five hundred more, and took arms, ammunition, and provisions from the enemy."</Q> Wood adds, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that going with a party on the 14th of Sep∣tember, 1644, to succour certain of the forces belonging to that house, which went to the town of <HI>Basing</HI> to fetch pro∣visions thence, but beaten back by the
<PB N="128" REF="147"/>
enemy, headed by that notorious rebel, Colonel <HI>Richard Norton,</HI> he received a shot in the shoulder, of which he died in a fortnight after. At which time his worth did justly challenge funeral tears; being then no less eminent in the garri∣son for his valour and conduct as a sol∣dier, than famous through the kingdom for his excellency as an herbalist and physician."</Q></P>
<P>I have mentioned Johnson's <HI>Iter Can∣tianum,</HI> and <HI>Ericetum Hamstedianum;</HI> but not having seen either, I can give no ac∣count of them.</P>
<P>In 1633, he published his improved edi∣tion of GERARD, under the title of "The HERBAL, <HI>or</HI> GENERAL HISTORY <HI>of</HI> PLANTS, gathered by <HI>John</HI> GERARD, of <HI>London,</HI> very much enlarged and a∣mended by <HI>Thomas</HI> JOHNSON, citizen and apothecary of <HI>London,</HI> for Islip and Nor∣ton." 1633. fol.; and again 1636. pp. 1630.</P>
<P>An interval of thirty-six years, from the date of <HI>Gerard's</HI> work, had effected a great change in the state of botanical knowledge;
<PB N="129" REF="148"/>
many new plants had been introduced, and many valuable works published on the con∣tinent, particularly the <HI>Hortus Eystetten∣sis</HI> in 1613, and the <HI>Prodromus</HI> of Bau∣hine in 1620. No publications had ap∣peared at home, except such as were adapted to the Florist and Gardener; <HI>Gas∣par Bauhine</HI>'s invaluable <HI>Pinax</HI> had facili∣tated and shortened the labour of consulting preceding authors. All these circumstances were favourable to JOHNSON; and his ac∣knowledged superiority to GERARD in the learned languages, might justly raise the ex∣pectation of the public; insomuch that it becomes a matter of speculation, why JOHN∣SON acquiesced in the character of an editor only. It may indeed be converted into a strong presumption of the value set by the public on GERARD; which probably pre∣vented the risk of a new title.</P>
<P>The general expectation was not disap∣pointed. The advantages above noted en∣abled JOHNSON to amplify and improve his author to such a degree, that his book eminently deserves the <HI>encomium</HI> that HAL∣LER has bestowed upon it, when he calls
<PB N="130" REF="149"/>
it <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>dignum opus, et totius rei herbariae eo aevo notae, compendium.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>After what has been said of the plan, as it stands in GERARD, it remains only to shew briefly what JOHNSON has done. In about twelve pages, he has prefixed a con∣cise, candid, and judicious account of the most material writers on the subject, from the earliest ages to the time in which he wrote; concluding with a particular account of his own work, from its origin in Dr. PRIEST's translation. After this follows a table, pointing out, with great precision, all his additions; by which we learn, that he enriched the work with more than eight hundred plants not in GERARD, and up∣wards of seven hundred figures, besides in∣numerable corrections. By procuring the same cuts that GERARD used, (to which collection a considerable accession had been made) and by having some new blocks cut, his work contained a greater number of figures than any Herbal extant; the whole amounting to 2717. He informs us, in an apology he makes for not inserting his additional matter in the edition of 1636,
<PB N="131" REF="150"/>
that he intended to travel throughout the kingdom in search of the more rare plants, and afterwards to comprise all his discove∣ries in an appendix.</P>
<P>In 1634, he published "MERCURIUS BOTANICUS; <HI>sive</HI> PLANTARUM <HI>gratia sus∣cepti Itineris, anno</HI> 1634, DESCRIPTIO; <HI>cum earum Nominibus Latinis et Anglicis.</HI>" <HI>Lond.</HI> 8vo. pp. 78.</P>
<P>It is dedicated to <HI>Sir Theodore</HI> MAYERNE, and others of the college, in his own, and the names of his associates in the excursion, who were all of the company of the Apo∣thecaries. It was the result of a journey, through <HI>Oxford,</HI> to <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Bristol,</HI> and back by <HI>Southampton,</HI> the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> and <HI>Guildford,</HI> made with the professed design to investigate rare plants. He has described, in not inelegant Latin, their rout, which took up only twelve days, and the agree∣able reception they met with among their medical acquaintance. We meet with a list of exotics, amounting to 117, cultivated by Mr. <HI>George</HI> GIBBS, a surgeon at <HI>Bath,</HI> who had made a voyage to <HI>Virginia,</HI> from whence he brought many new plants; which, as it exhibits the advanced state of
<PB N="132" REF="151"/>
gardening in this country at that time, is now a matter of curiosity.</P>
<P>The plants of spontaneous growth enu∣merated in this short tour, varieties being excluded. exceed six hundred, which, at a time when the <HI>cryptogamiae</HI> were scarcely noticed, and in the season when neither the very early nor late plants could be seen, is no inconsiderable number. In this ca∣talogue are several not discovered in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> before. With this tour JOHNSON gave his small tract, "<HI>De Thermis Bathonicis, sive earum descriptio, vires, utendi tempus, modus,</HI> &amp;c." Lond. 1634. pp. 19. There are three small plans of the baths, and one of the city, which seem to be copied from Speed's map. These are now pleasing curiosities to the lovers of antiquity, and to all who contemplate the astonishing increase of the city since that time.</P>
<P>This was followed by "PARS ALTERA, <HI>sive</HI> PLANTARUM <HI>gratia suscepti Itineris in Cambriam seu Walliam</HI> DESCRIPTIO." Lond. 1641. 8<SUP>o</SUP>.</P>
<P>JOHNSON, if not the first, was among the earliest Botanists who visited <HI>Wales,</HI> and <HI>Snowdon,</HI> with the sole intention of
<PB N="133" REF="152"/>
discovering the rarities of that country in the vegetable kingdom. The journey seems to have answered his purpose, and afford∣ed him a rich harvest. In this expedition he first found the yellow poppy, <HI>papaver cambricum:</HI> mountain saw-wort, <HI>serratula alpina:</HI> rose-root, <HI>rhodiola rosea;</HI> and several other plants.</P>
<P>I cannot ascertain the age of JOHNSON at his death, but there is reason to think he could not be far advanced in life, if indeed he was arrived at the meridian of it. I ground my opinion on the circumstance of LOBEL's total silence relating to him, in his <HI>Adversaria,</HI> printed in 1605. En∣gaged as JOHNSON was, in the exercise of a profession, which, independent of the calls of duty, demands much sacrifice of time, to the forms and civilities of life, his HERBAL is an ample testimony of zeal and industry. I do not find that he was the author of any other publications, than those, of which I have given some account; but, he translated the works of <HI>Ambrose</HI> PAREY, which he published at <HI>London</HI> in 1643. They were reprinted, if I mistake not,
<PB N="134" REF="153"/>
for the last time in 1678. This excellent man, who in the character of surgeon, succes∣sively served four sovereigns of <HI>France,</HI> was attached to the protestant cause; and for his extraordinary merit, and his having cured <HI>Charles</HI> IX. of a tendon wounded in bleeding, was saved from the massacre of St. <HI>Bartholomew.</HI> He survived this event 19 years, and died in 1590. His works were collected by himself, in 1582, in folio, and ran through nine or ten editions on the continent. PAREY's improvements in his profession had been singularly important; there can be no doubt, therefore, that our author performed a very acceptable service to his countrymen, by putting his writings into an English dress<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MILLER consecrated the name of JOHNSON by as∣signing it to a berry-bearing shrub of <HI>Carolina,</HI> belonging to the <HI>tetrandrous</HI> class; first figured by PLUKENET, <HI>tab.</HI> 136. f. 3. and since by CATESBY, <HI>vol.</HI> 2. <HI>tab.</HI> 47. The English Botanists, who must consider JOHNSON as entitled to so honourable a distinction among their worthies, will regret that his name should not be re∣tained in the Linnaean system, in preference to <HI>Callicarpa,</HI> by which term this shrub is now well known in the English gardens.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="154"/>
Before JOHNSON is dismissed, it would be unjust not to notice some of those, to whom the author was especially indebted for assistance, and for the communication of English plants. Among these, the first place is due to Mr. <HI>John</HI> GOODYER, of <HI>Maple Durham,</HI> in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> whose name occurs repeatedly in GERARD's "Herbal," and very frequently in PARKINSON's, in which he is stiled <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a great lover and curious searcher of plants; who, besides this" (speaking of the <HI>geranium saxa∣tile</HI>) "hath found in our country many other plants, not imagined to grow in our land."</Q> He seems not only to have been what may be called a <HI>practical</HI> Bota∣nist, but learned, and critically versed in the history of the science. This may be fairly inferred from his curious communi∣cation, relating to the manuscripts under the name of APULEIUS <HI>Madaurensis,</HI> and from his observations on the <HI>saxifrage</HI> of the ancients, inserted at p. 604. The great number of rare English plants, which Mr. GOODYER first brought to light, entitles
<PB N="136" REF="155"/>
him to the most reputable rank among those who have advanced the botanical knowledge of this kingdom.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>George</HI> BOWLES, of <HI>Chisselhurst,</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> also distinguished himself by his suc∣cessful investigation of many new plants. He spent some time in <HI>Wales,</HI> where his discoveries were very ample; and he is mentioned with particular attention, in numerous instances, by our author.</P>
<P>The names of JOHNSON's associates in his Kentish, and other simpling excursions, occur in the preface; and in the body of the work we meet also with the following:</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> TRADESCANT the elder, who be∣came famous afterwards for his fine garden, and museum of natural curiosities.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John</HI> TUNSTAL, gentleman usher to the queen, is recorded as possessing a garden at <HI>Edgcome</HI> in Surrey, stored with plants, which are said to have belonged to the queen.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI> GLYN, who first found that elegant plant the <HI>gnaphalium marinum,</HI> on the coast of Wales.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="156"/>
Mr. <HI>Hugh</HI> MORGAN, apothecary to the queen, before mentioned under the article of LOBEL.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Robert</HI> ABBOT, of <HI>Hatfield,</HI> near St. <HI>Albans,</HI> a learned preacher, and an ex∣cellent and diligent herbarist.</P>
<P>BOELIUS or BOEL, of whom further no∣tice more properly comes under the article of PARKINSON.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>John</HI> REDMAN, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a skilful herba∣rist,"</Q> an inhabitant of the northern part of England.</P>
<P>Frequent and respectable notice is also taken of Mr. <HI>John</HI> PARKINSON, the sub∣ject of the succeeding article. His <HI>Paradisus Terrestris</HI> is much commended, and his garden referred to as abounding in choice plants.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>PARKINSON.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JOHN</HI> PARKINSON was born in 1567. I regret that I am not enabled to sup∣ply a more ample account of this laborious man, whose learning and abilities appear to me not to have been justly appreciated. He was bred an apothecary, and lived in <HI>London.</HI> He was contemporary with GE∣RARD and LOBEL, during the latter part of their lives; and survived JOHNSON seve∣ral years. LOBEL, in the second part of his <HI>Adversaria,</HI> and JOHNSON, in his <HI>Gerardus Emaculatus,</HI> speak of him as a man of emi∣nence in his profession, and as possessed of
<PB N="139" REF="158"/>
a garden well stored with rarities. In fact, he rose to such a degree of reputation as to be appointed apothecary to King <HI>James;</HI> and at the publication of his "Theatre of Plants," he obtained, as we learn by Sir <HI>Theodore</HI> MAYERNE's commendatory letter prefixed to it, the title from <HI>Charles</HI> the First of <HI>Botanicus Regius Primarius.</HI> The time of his death I cannot ascertain; but, as his "Herbal" was published in 1640, and he appears to be living at that time, he must have attained his 73d year. There is a print of him prefixed to his <HI>Paradisus,</HI> in the 62d year of his age, and a small oval one, in the title of his "Herbal," or "Theatre of Plants."</P>
<P>His first publication was the "PARA∣DISI IN SOLE PARADISUS TERRESTRIS; or, a garden of all sorts of pleasant flowers, which our English ayre will permit to be nursed up: with a kitchen garden of all manner of herbs, roots, and fruits, for meat or sause, used with us, and an or∣chard of all sorte of fruit-bearing trees and shrubbes fit for our land; together with the right ordering, planting, and preserv∣ing
<PB N="140" REF="159"/>
of them, and their uses and vertues. Collected by <HI>John</HI> PARKINSON, apothe∣cary of London 1629." Folio. pp. 612.</P>
<P>There was a second edition published after the author's death, corrected and en∣larged, in 1656.</P>
<P>As the subject of this book interests the florist and gardener merely, it comes less within the scope of this work than his "Herbal." It is dedicated to Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and, agreeably to the panegyri∣cal custom of the times, is set off with re∣commendatory verses; among which we meet with some in Latin from <HI>Thomas</HI> JOHNSON, doubtless the editor of GERARD, and a Latin letter, in a high strain of eu∣logy, from Sir <HI>Theodore</HI> MAYERNE.</P>
<P>The plants are arranged without any other order than that expressed in the title page. Garden flowers are divided into 134 chapters, according to the generical names of the time; kitchen plants into 63 chapters; fruit trees and shrubs into 24 chapters; and a corollary of 22 species. Nearly one thousand plants are separately described; of which seven hundred and eighty are figur∣ed
<PB N="141" REF="160"/>
on one hundred and nine tables, which appear to have been cut on purpose for this work. Many are copied from CLUSIUS and LOBEL. The figures are less com∣mendable for the design than the execution, and are much inferior, on the whole, to those of GERARD's "Herbal." In the Latin names, the author has made use prin∣cipally of <HI>Casper</HI> BAUHINE; some are taken from LOBEL. The mode of arrange∣ment in each chapter is similar to that of GERARD. After the description of all the species, follow the place, time of flowering, synonyms, and virtues. Less is spoken of the culture than seems to be requisite.</P>
<P>Several Englishmen had written on gar∣dening and agriculture in the sixteenth century, of whom the first on husbandry, as far as I can find, was <HI>Antony</HI> FITZHER∣BERT, a famous lawyer and justice of the King's Bench, whose "Booke of Hus∣bandrie" was printed first in 1534. One of the earliest, if not the first on gardening, is <HI>Thomas</HI> HILL, "His profytable Art of Gardening," printed in 1574. The next was, "The new Orchard and Garden," by
<PB N="142" REF="161"/>
William LAWSON, in 1597. In 1600, Sir <HI>Hugh</HI> PLATT, the author of many other useful tracts, put forth his "Garden of Eden;" a book of great merit in its time. All these passed through numerous editions, and the last preserved credit to the end of the century.</P>
<P>PARKINSON however, as I apprehend, was the first author, who separately describ∣ed and figured the subjects of the <HI>Flower Garden.</HI> The <HI>Paradisus Terrestris</HI> is there∣fore, at this time, a valuable curiosity, as exhibiting the most compleat view of the extent of the English garden at the begin∣ning of the last century. Intertropical productions had been but sparingly import∣ed. The real stove plants are very rare throughout the book. There are some American species, and particularly from <HI>Virginia,</HI> as being a part of that continent with which <HI>England</HI> had the most frequent intercourse. But the principal productions of the English gardens were exotic Euro∣pean, and Grecian plants, some Asiatic, and a few from the northern coasts of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>A modern florist, wholly unacquainted
<PB N="143" REF="162"/>
with the state of the art at the time PAR∣KINSON wrote, would perhaps be surprized to find that his predecessors could enume∣rate, besides sixteen described as distinct species, one hundred and twenty varieties of the <HI>tulip,</HI> sixty <HI>anemonies,</HI> more than nine∣ty of the <HI>narcissus</HI> tribe, fifty <HI>hyacinths,</HI> fifty <HI>carnations,</HI> twenty <HI>pinks,</HI> thirty <HI>cro∣cuses,</HI> and above forty of the <HI>iris</HI> genus. In the orchard we find above sixty kinds of <HI>plums,</HI> as many <HI>apples</HI> and <HI>pears,</HI> thirty <HI>cherries,</HI> and more than twenty <HI>peaches.</HI></P>
<P>In 1640, PARKINSON published his "THEATRUM BOTANICUM; or, Theatre of Plants, or an Herbal of a large extent: containing therein a more ample and ex∣act history and declaration of the physical herbs and plants that are in other au∣thors; encreased by the access of many hundreds of new, rare, and strange plants from all the parts of the world; with sundry gummes, and other physical materials, than hath been hitherto pub∣lished by any before: and a most large demonstration of their nature and virtues. Shewing withal, the many errors, differ∣ences,
<PB N="144" REF="163" MS="y"/>
and oversights of sundry authors that have formerly written of them, and a certain confidence, or most probable conjecture of the true and genuine herbs and plants: distributed into sundry classes or tribes, for the more easy knowledge of the many herbs of one nature and property, with the chief notes of Dr. <HI>Lobel,</HI> Dr. <HI>Bonham,</HI> and others, inserted therein." London. Folio. pp. 1746. SEGUIER mentions and edition in 1656, which I never saw, and suspect it was not a new impression.</P>
<P>This work was the labour of PARKIN∣SON's life, and was not published until he was arrived at a very advanced period. He tells us, in the preface, that, owing <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to the dis∣astrous times,"</Q> and other impediments, the printing of it was long retarded. Ori∣ginally it was intended to have contained only the medicinal herbs, under the title of "A physical Garden of Simples," but he enlarged his plan, and endeavoured to comprehend all the Botany of his time. It is manifest, even from a cursory view of it, that it is a work of much more originality
<PB N="145" REF="164"/>
than that of GERARD; and it contains abundantly more matter than the last edi∣tion of that author, with all JOHNSON's augmentations. In the general disposition of the subject, the order is chiefly founded on the known, or supposed qualities, and virtues of the plants; being divided into seventeen tribes, as follow:<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Plantae odoratoe.</HI> Sweet-smelling plants.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Catharticae.</HI> Purging plants.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Venenatae, narcoticae, nocivae, et alexi∣pharmicae.</HI> Venemous, sleepy, and hurtful plants, and their counter∣poisons.</ITEM>

<ITEM>9. <HI>Cardui, et spinosae.</HI> Thistles, and thorny plants.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="146" REF="165"/>
10. <HI>Filices, et herbae capillares.</HI> Ferns, and capillary herbes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. <HI>Legumina.</HI> Pulses.</ITEM>
<ITEM>12. <HI>Cerealia.</HI> Corn.</ITEM>
<ITEM>13. <HI>Gramina, junci, arundines.</HI> Grasses, rushes, and reeds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>14. <HI>Paludosae, aquaticae, marinae, musci, et fungi.</HI> Marsh, water, and sea plants, mosses, and mushrooms.</ITEM>
<ITEM>15. <HI>Miscellaneae.</HI> The unordered tribe.</ITEM>
<ITEM>16. <HI>Arbores, et frutices.</HI> Trees, and shrubbes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>17. <HI>Exoticae, et peregrinae.</HI> Outlandish plants.</ITEM>
<ITEM>18. <HI>Appendix.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This heterogeneous classification, which seems to be founded on that of <HI>Dodoens,</HI> sometimes on the medicinal qualities, some∣times on the habit, and on the place of growth, shews the small advances that had been made towards any truly scientific dis∣tribution. On the contrary, both GE∣RARD, JOHNSON, and PARKINSON, had rather gone back, by not sufficiently pursu∣ing the example of LOBEL.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="166"/>
In the particular disposition of the sub∣jects, under each chapter or genus, PAR∣KINSON follows the rules of GERARD, and JOHNSON, by giving, after the Latin and English name, the descriptions at large; then the place of growth, and time of flowering; the synonyms, and lastly, the virtues and uses.</P>
<P>Nice discrimination of species from each other, or from varieties, must not be ex∣pected in this work, more than in GE∣RARD, or his <HI>Emaculator.</HI> Almost every Botanist was then a Florist too. CLUSIUS himself, who had enlarged the science, by his own discoveries, beyond any other man, continued to raise tulips from seed, for more than 35 years. PARKINSON's "<HI>Paradisus</HI>" proves his attachment to the Flower Gar∣den, in the early part of his life; and this bias influenced him throughout the "Thea∣tre of Plants." As yet, no line had been drawn with sufficient accuracy, between species and variety, between nature and the effect of culture, or of soil and situation, nor was this brought about till the essential parts of vegetables, the flower, and the fruit, became
<PB N="148" REF="167"/>
objects of classification, instead of the vague distinctions hitherto observed; of which it may be sufficient to adduce one example, out of hundreds equally futile. The sea cabbage, <HI>(brassica orientalis)</HI> a <HI>siliquose</HI> plant, is ranked by GERARD and JOHNSON, as well as by PARKINSON, even contrary to the examples of CLUSIUS and DODONAEUS, under the same generical name with the thorow wax, <HI>(bupleurum)</HI> an <HI>umbelliferous</HI> plant, merely because the leaf is of the <HI>persoliate</HI> kind.</P>
<P>These are defects common to the age, and PARKINSON must not be appreciated by modern improvement, but by comparison with his contemporaries. In this view, if I am not mistaken, he will appear more of an original author than GERARD, or JOHNSON, independent of the advantages he might derive from being posterior to them. His "<HI>Theatre</HI>" was carried on thro' a long series of years, and he profited by the works of some late authors, which, though equal∣ly in JOHNSON's power, he had neglected to use. PARKINSON's descriptions, in many instances, appear to be new. He is
<PB N="149" REF="168"/>
more particular in pointing out the places of growth. In the enumeration of the synonyms, he has not only given nearly the whole of BAUHINE's "<HI>Pinax,</HI>" but, very fre∣quently, has himself consulted the original authors, and enters minutely into a discus∣sion of their doubts. In the account of the virtues, and uses, PARKINSON is diffuse. It was his professed design to make his work a <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> and if, in him, we meet with the qualities of plants estimated on Galenical principles, by the degrees of hot and cold, moist and dry, &amp;c. it was the theory os the day, from which authors of higher eminence were not emancipated. He not only gives the opinions of the Greek and Roman physicians, but of the Arabi∣ans, and has translated from the moderns, and his contemporaries, whatever could il∣lustrate his subject, and render it as perfect as the intelligence of the times would al∣low. To this end he has extracted largely from CLUSIUS's "Exotics," from D'A∣COSTA, MONARDES, and GARCIAS <HI>ab</HI> HORTO on the drugs and simples of the East and West Indies; of which, at that
<PB N="150" REF="169"/>
time, many were newly introduced, and imperfectly known.</P>
<P>PARKINSON's work is much more ex∣tensive than JOHNSON's, in the number of subjects described, he having taken, as be∣fore observed, advantages which the <HI>Ema∣culator</HI> of GERARD neglected. Many of the plants of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> from <HI>Prosper</HI> ALPI∣NUS, many of the North American, or Ca∣nadian plants, from CORNUTUS, and some from COLUMNA's work, are introduced. He neglected no opportunities of procuring new plants from abroad. The nature of his profession did not allow him to make distant or frequent excursions in <HI>England;</HI> but, by the assistance of his correspondents, and some of LOBEL's posthumous writings, which he purchased, he was enabled to en∣large, not only the catalogue of British plants, but to introduce many exotics be∣fore unknown.</P>
<P>JOHNSON had described about 2850 plants, PARKINSON has near 3800. These accumulations rendered the "THEA∣TRUM BOTANICUM" the most copious book on the subject in the English lan∣guage;
<PB N="151" REF="170"/>
and it may be presumed, that it gained equally the approbation of medical people, and of all those who were curious and inquisitive in this kind of knowledge. Both this work, and GERARD's afterwards, acquired consequence by the references of Mr. RAY, who may be said, in the lan∣guage of the <HI>Catalogus Oxoniensis,</HI> to have raised them to classical eminence in En∣glish Botany, and preserved them from ob∣livion as long as his own works remain. Without any design of depriving JOHNSON of his due praise, yet it is obvious, from the recollection of certain circumstances, that PARKINSON laboured under disadvan∣tages and impediments, which probably tended to depress his work at the time, al∣though it had undoubtedly been carrying on through a longer series of years than <HI>John∣son</HI>'s, and was more copious in its design.</P>
<P>JOHNSON had the opportunity that GE∣RARD himself obtained, of procuring all the cuts from abroad. PARKINSON's, on the other hand, though copied from the same figures, appear to have been cut anew, purposely for his work. The delay occa∣sioned
<PB N="152" REF="171"/>
by this circumstance, besides the great expence, was, probably, among the obstacles the author complains of, which so long retarded the publication of his work. Add to this, that the figures were after all inferior to the old tables, both in number and execution. JOHNSON's exceed those of PARKINSON, by more than an hundred. Both these works may be considered as <HI>Di∣gests</HI> of the Botany of the age, in the Eng∣lish tongue; but it is to be feared the same censure lies against them which <HI>Caspar</HI> BAUHINE lodged against DALECHAMP's history, published in 1588, in which he de∣monstrated, that more than 400 plants were twice described.</P>
<P>Nor is it wonderful that the attempt to comprehend, and discriminate the whole vegetable kingdom, was a plan too exten∣sive for one man, especially in the aug∣mented state in which PARKINSON found it. The magnitude of the design neces∣sarily involved a multitude of errors, and exposed both GERARD and PARKINSON to the censures of malignant critics. Had the candour of LOBEL been equal to his
<PB N="153" REF="172"/>
learning and knowledge, he had spared much of his acrimony against these indus∣trious writers, whose laudable endeavours rather merited his applause.</P>
<P>Among those contemporaries, whose col∣lateral assistance is acknowledged by PAR∣KINSON, Mr. (or, as he is stiled in some parts of the work, <HI>Dr.</HI>) <HI>William</HI> BOEL claims particular notice. He was a native of the Low Countries, and had travelled into various parts of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> had been in <HI>Barbary,</HI> resided at <HI>Tunis,</HI> and, at the publication of "the Herbal," lived at <HI>Lisbon.</HI> From all these countries he sent seeds of many plants before unknown in <HI>England.</HI> He was the correspondent of CLUSIUS, and seems to have been very zealous for the improvement of natural knowledge.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>John</HI> GORDIER, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a great lover and curious searcher of plants, who, be∣sides this," (speaking of the <HI>Geranium lucidum</HI>) "hath found in our country other plants, not imagined to grow in our land."</Q></P>

name of Mrs. <HI>Thomazin</HI> TUNSTAL, a lady whom he celebrates, not only for her taste in cultivating a garden which was well stored with exotics, but for her knowledge of <HI>English</HI> botany, and her discoveries of se∣veral curious vegetables found about <HI>Ingle∣borough Hill,</HI> in <HI>Lancashire;</HI> which were not known before to grow in <HI>England.</HI> Whe∣ther she was allied to Sir <HI>John</HI> TUNSTAL, noticed in the account of JOHNSON, I can∣not ascertain.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>WOODEN CUTS.</HEAD>
<P>AS we are now arrived at the period, when wooden cuts were about to be superseded by engravings on metal, PAR∣KINSON's "Herbal" being the last of any importance in which they were used in <HI>England,</HI> it may not be incongruous to our plan to notice the origin and progress of that art, which contributed not a little to facilitate the knowledge of plants. Rude as these representations were, compared with the elegance of modern times, yet, in an age when specific distinctions were not fixed, and the diagnostic of the plant de∣pended
<PB N="156" REF="175"/>
so much on habit, they spoke to the eye, and often discriminated the subject, when the laboured description failed.</P>
<P>It has been before observed, that SE∣GUIER is of opinion the first Herbal with wooden cuts was the "<HI>Buch der Natur,</HI>" "The Book of Nature," printed at <HI>Augs∣burgh,</HI> in 1478, if not three years earlier. These are thought to have passed into the HERBARIUS, printed at <HI>Mentz</HI> in 1484; from which book was compiled the ORTUS SANITATIS, printed at the same place in 1485; with improvements in the work in general, and better figures, by CUBA. Of this work some notice has before been taken, as the foundation of the English "Grete Herbal," first printed here in 1516.</P>
<P>The HORTUS SANITATIS was translated into various languages, and in some new∣modelled, without concealing its origin, according to the fancy of different editors and printers; and passed through innume∣rable editions on the Continent; having been the popular book on the subject, as the "<HI>Grete Herbal</HI>" was in England, for fisty or sixty years.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="176"/>
It does not appear that CUBA was pub∣licly known as the author of the HORTUS SANITATIS, until EGENOLF, a bookseller of <HI>Frankfort,</HI> gave an improved edition, with an entirely new set of figures, under the care of EUCHARIUS RHODION or RO∣ESLIN, a physician of the same city, in 1533. <HI>Egenolf</HI>'s book passed through va∣rious editions, until a better work was com∣posed by DORSTEN, under the title of "<HI>Bo∣tanicon,</HI>" in 1540, at <HI>Frankfort;</HI> in which the same figures were employed. They were used also in the "<HI>Encyclopaedia Medica</HI>" of J. DRYANDER, in 1542; and in the succeeding year, in an edition of DIOSCO∣RIDES, by <HI>Hermann Ryff,</HI> printed by <HI>Ege∣nolf.</HI> Finally, ADAM LONICER, the son-in-law of <HI>Egenolf,</HI> having totally reformed the work of CUBA, employed them in his <HI>Herbal,</HI> printed in 1546. In succeeding editions, he introduced new figures, took others from TRAGUS to the number in the whole of 880, and composed a work, which passed through a great number of editions, and was not superseded in the present century, as appears by an edition
<PB N="158" REF="177"/>
printed so lately as in 1723, and even in 1737.</P>
<P>We are informed by TRAGUS, that <HI>Ege∣nolf</HI> spared no expence in the encourage∣ment of artists to procure these icons, rude and imperfect as they appear to us. He se∣cured to himself, by this means, the mo∣nopoly of printing <HI>Herbals,</HI> for a succession of years; and acquired both fame and riches.</P>
<P>At length, these were all superseded by those of BRUNSFELSIUS to his Herbal, printed in 1532; which were drawn from nature, and appear to have been the first that were worthy of notice. These were, however, greatly excelled by FUCHSIUS, in 1542; whose figures, although only out∣lines, are uncommonly beautiful, and not less just. They consist of five hundred figures in folio, of the most common and useful plants; and were copied, in a smaller scale, by many succeeding authors. TRA∣GUS took most of them into his "History of German Plants," to which he added many new ones, to the amount in all of 567. Those of TRAGUS are little more
<PB N="159" REF="178"/>
than outlines; and, allowing for the time, they sufficiently well express the habit of most of the subjects.</P>
<P><HI>Egenolf</HI> having set the example, printers, after this time, themselves bore the expence of cutting the blocks; by which means, certain printers monopolised the printing of <HI>Herbals;</HI> and a kind of commerce between them and authors took place, and mutual exchanges were made for the use of each other's books. Among these, no one pos∣sessed at length a greater collection than the famous PLANTIN, of <HI>Antwerp;</HI> who recommended himself so highly by the excellency of his types, and mode of exe∣cuting his works. Hence he became the common printer to several of the celebrated botanic writers of the sixteenth century. When CLUSIUS published his French trans∣lation of DODOENS, with <HI>Loe,</HI> at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> he gave figures copied from FUCHSIUS; all which <HI>Plantin</HI> bought. He afterwards acquired the figures cut for CLUSIUS's own works, and those of LOBEL. DODONAEUS, besides some new blocks, had the use of all the above in the "<HI>Pemptades,</HI>" in 1584, which work contains 1300 figures. TABERNAE∣MONTANUS
<PB N="160" REF="179"/>
obtained the use of this col∣lection, namely, those of FUCHSIUS, CLU∣SIUS, LOBEL, and DODONAEUS; to which he added those of MATTHIOLUS; inso∣much that his Herbal, printed at <HI>Frankfort</HI> in 1588, comprehends more than two thou∣sand figures. DALECHAMP, in his "Ge∣neral History of Plants," printed about the same time, augmented them to near two thousand seven hundred.</P>
<P>The fate of GESNER's excellent figures I can but briefly mention; it forms a mor∣tifying, but curious anecdote, in the literary history of the science. Of the fifteen hun∣dred figures left by GESNER, prepared for his "History of Plants," at his death, in 1565, a large share passed into the "<HI>Epi∣tome Matthioli,</HI>" published by CAMERA∣RIUS in 1586, which contained in the whole 1003 figures; and in the same year, as also into a second edition in 1590, they embel∣lished an abridged translation of MAT∣THIOLUS, printed under the name of the "German Herbal." In 1609, the same blocks were used by <HI>Uffenbach</HI> for the Her∣bal of CASTOR DURANTES, printed at <HI>Frankfort.</HI> This publication, however,
<PB N="161" REF="180"/>
comprehends only 948 of these icons, nearly another hundred being introduced of very in∣ferior merit. After this period, CAMERA∣RIUS the younger being dead, these blocks were purchased by <HI>Goerlin,</HI> a bookseller of <HI>Ulm;</HI> and next served for the "<HI>Parnassus Medicinalis illustratus</HI>" of BECHER, printed at that city in 1663; the second part of which work contains all those of the "<HI>Epi∣tome,</HI>" except six figures. In 1678, they were taken into a German Herbal, made up from MATTHIOLUS, by <HI>Bernard</HI> VER∣ZASCHA, printed at <HI>Basil;</HI> and such was the excellency of the materials and work∣manship of these blocks, that they were exhibited a sixth time in the "<HI>Theatrum Botanicum,</HI>" or Kräuterbuch of ZWINGER, being an amended edition of VERZASCHA, printed also at <HI>Basil</HI> in 1696, with the addi∣tion of more than one hundred new blocks, copied from C. BAUHINE and TABERNAE∣MONTANUS; and finally, into a new edition of the same work, so late as the year 1744.</P>
<P>Thus did the genius and labours of GES∣NER add dignity and ornament to the works of other men, and even of some whose en∣mity he had experienced during his life-time.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="181"/>
Besides the above mentioned, GESNER left five volumes, consisting entirely of figures, which, after various vicissitudes, became the property of TREW, of <HI>Norim∣berg.</HI> Sensible that whether we view the extent of GESNER's knowledge and learn∣ing, or his singular industry, such must be the veneration for his character, that any of his remains must claim the attention of the curious, the possessor gratified the pub∣lic, by the pen of Dr. SCHMIEDEL, with an ample specimen, published in 1753.</P>
<P>Thus far for foreigners. The rude icons of the "Grete Herbal," it has been ob∣served, were evidently copied from those in the HORTUS SANITATIS; for that they were not the same tables, appears from the diminished size. Of the figures in TURNER's History, which amount to upwards of 500; the greater part are those of FUCHSIUS's octavo set; and the remainder, nearly 100, were new. LYTE printed his translation of DODOENS with <HI>Loe,</HI> at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> for the conveniency of his figures, which are also borrowed from FUCHSIUS; to which LYTE added about thirty new ones.</P>
<P>GERARD, in 1597, and JOHNSON, his
<PB N="163" REF="182"/>
"<HI>Emaculator</HI>" afterwards, in 1633 and 1636, procured all the blocks from <HI>Frank∣fort,</HI> with which the Herbal of TABERNAE∣MONTANUS had been illustrated. JOHN∣SON by this means accumulated upwards of 2700 cuts.</P>
<P>The blocks for PARKINSON's "<HI>Thea∣trum,</HI>" and his "<HI>Paradisus,</HI>" were, I appre∣hend, cut in <HI>England;</HI> and those for the first seem to be copies from GERARD, though much inferior in execution. The last of the kind used in <HI>England,</HI> were a new set cut for SALMON's "Herbal," in 1710; except, I believe, those for a very indifferent per∣formance, under the name of "An Herbal," published since that time, in quarto.</P>
<P>The earliest copper-plates of plants on the Continent, are said to be those of <HI>Co∣lumna</HI> in his "<HI>Phytobasanos,</HI>" in 1592. In <HI>England,</HI> except some single figures, and the few plates in the first edition of PLOT's "Oxfordshire" in 1677, those of the "<HI>His∣toria Oxoniensis</HI>" are the first exhibition of any great work; and of these, the grasses are, to this time, perhaps unparalleled in the neatness and accuracy of the execution.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>HORTUS OXONIENSIS.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO Botany, however suc∣cessfully it might have been culti∣vated by individuals in <HI>England,</HI> had re∣ceived no encouragement from any public institutions; but the time was now ar∣rived, when it acquired additional vigour and improvement from the foundation of a physic-garden at <HI>Oxford.</HI> These elegant and necessary aids to science had considera∣bly multiplied since the first foundations of
<PB N="165" REF="184"/>
the kind, before noticed, in <HI>Italy</HI> and else∣where. Several universities in the more northern and western parts of <HI>Europe</HI> had procured the establishment of gardens: <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> in 1570; <HI>Leyden,</HI> in 1577; <HI>Leipsic,</HI> in 1580; <HI>Montpelier,</HI> in 1598; <HI>Jena,</HI> in 1628; and <HI>Oxford,</HI> in the year 1632. This last was owing to the munificence of HENRY <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Danby,</HI> who gave for this purpose five acres of ground, built green-houses and stoves, and an house for the accommodation of the gardener; endowed the establishment, and placed in it, as the supervisor, <HI>Jacob</HI> BOBART, a German from <HI>Brunswick,</HI> who lived, as WOOD tells us, in the garden∣house, and died there on February 4, 1679. A list of the plants was published, under the title of "CATALOGUS PLANTARUM <HI>Horti medici</HI> OXONIENSIS <HI>Latino-anglicus et Anglico-latinus: alphabetico ordine.</HI>" Oxon. 1648. 12<SUP>o</SUP>. pp. 54 and 51. DILLENIUS informs us, that BOBART drew up this catalogue. In the preface we are told the garden contained 1600 species, by which must be understood both exotic and indi∣genous, including varieties of each. The
<PB N="166" REF="185"/>
plants are barely enumerated, without any synonyms, or references to any author. The number of English species recited, extends to 600, or nearly. The copiousness of this catalogue sets the zeal and diligence of BOBART in a favourable light. Under his care, and that of his son, the garden of <HI>Oxford</HI> continued to flourish for many years.</P>
<P>The CATALOGUS OXONIENSIS was re∣published in the year 1658, in a much im∣proved state, by the joint assistance of Dr. STEPHENS, Mr. <HI>William</HI> BROWNE, and the two BOBARTS, father and son, under the following title, "CATALOGUS HORTI BOTANICI OXONIENSIS, <HI>alphabetice diges∣tus, duas praeterpropter, plantarum chilia∣das complectens, priore duplo auctior, idemque elimatior, nec non etymologiis, qua Graecis, qua Latinis, hinc inde petitis, enucleatior: in quo nomina Latina pariter et Graeca vernaculis; et in ejus sequiore parte, vernacula Latinis praeponuntur. Cui accessere plantae minimum sexaginta suis nominibus insignitae, quae nullibi nisi in hoc opusculo memorantur. Curâ et operâ sociâ Philippi</HI> STEPHANI, <HI>M.D. et</HI>

<P>Of Dr. <HI>Philip</HI> STEPHENS, whose name stands first among the authors of this cata∣logue, we find little mention elsewhere, as eminent in botanical science. He was born at the <HI>Devizes</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and was first of St. Alban's Hall, <HI>Oxon;</HI> afterwards made Fellow of New College by the visitors, and became Principal of <HI>Magdalen Hall.</HI> He died at <HI>London</HI> after the Restoration.</P>
<P>MERRET, without any notice of Dr. STEPHENS, expressly calls Mr. BROWNE the author of this <HI>Catalogue;</HI> and <HI>Wood</HI> says, that he had the chief hand in it. <HI>William</HI> BROWNE was a native of <HI>Oxsord,</HI> became Bachelor of Divinity, and Senior Fellow of Magdalen College. He died in March 1678, aged about 50, and was bu∣ried in the outer chapel of his college.</P>
<P>In this enlarged edition, the authors have, in every instance where it was possible, not only adopted the specifical appellations giv∣en by GERARD and PARKINSON to each
<PB N="168" REF="187"/>
plant, but quoted the page of their works. This is the first book, as far as I know, on the subject, printed in <HI>England,</HI> in which the latter of these circumstances takes place. It is remarkable, that so obvious an assistance, after having been introduced by <HI>Caspar</HI> BAU∣HINE in his "<HI>Phytopinax,</HI>" should be want∣ing in the "<HI>Pinax</HI>" itself. Had GERARD and PARKINSON retained, throughout their works, the exact synonyms of the authors from whom they transferred their plants, and quoted the pages, they would unquestionably have rendered their writings much more useful to posterity, and have preserved them from disuse and oblivion, for a much longer period. The same may be observed of Mr. RAY, who has totally neglected this valu∣able improvement. So novel was the prac∣tice, that the authors of the HORTUS OXO∣NIENSIS thought it necessary to apologise for it, and shield themselves under the au∣thority of the "<HI>Hortus Eystettensis.</HI>"</P>
<P>There are many dubious and ill-ascer∣tained plants in this Catalogue; and those marked as new, are almost wholly varieties. English Botany seems to have received little
<PB N="169" REF="188"/>
or no accession by it; and I am not aware of one indigenous plant first mentioned in this list.</P>
<P>The second part, or alphabetical list of English names, is intended only to lead to the Latin generical term in the first part.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>HOW.</HEAD>
<P>Until this period, no attempts had been made in <HI>England</HI> to separate the indigenous from exotic botany. It is true, Dr. JOHN∣SON, as before mentioned, had published local catalogues of the plants of certain dis∣tricts; but no one had essayed a general list or description of the English plants alone, in the way of what is now called a <HI>Flora:</HI> a term, which, as far as I can find, was first adopted by <HI>Simon</HI> PAULI, for a catalogue of the plants of <HI>Denmark,</HI> published in 1648. It is to Dr. How that we owe the first sketch of a work of this kind; and, though he does not entitle his book <HI>Flora,</HI> he yet mentions that term in his preface.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> How was born in <HI>London</HI> in the year 1619, and educated at Merchant Tay∣lors school. He became a commoner of St. John's college, <HI>Oxford,</HI> at eighteen: he
<PB N="170" REF="189"/>
took his bachelor's degree in 1641, and that of master of arts in 1645; and entered on the physical line. It does not appear that he ever took his doctor's degree, though he was commonly called Dr. How. With many other scholars of that time, he en∣tered into the king's army, and for his loy∣alty was promoted to the rank of captain, in a troop of horse. Upon the decline of the royal cause, he prosecuted his studies in physic, and practised in that faculty. He lived first in St. Lawrence Lane, and after∣wards in Milk Street. He died about the beginning of September 1656, and was bu∣ried by the grave of his mother, in St. Mar∣garet's church, <HI>Westminster;</HI> leaving behind him, as Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> says, <Q REND="inline">"a choice library of books of his faculty, and the character of a noted herbalist."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. How's principal publication, and for which he is here recorded, bears the following title:</P>
<P>"PHYTOLOGIA BRITANNICA, <HI>natales exhibens indigenarum Stirpium sponte emer∣gentium.</HI>" Lond. 1650. 12<SUP>o</SUP>. pp. 133.</P>
<P>The plants are arranged in the alphabe∣tical order of the <HI>Latin</HI> names, with one or
<PB N="171" REF="190"/>
two synonyms, taken, as best pleased the author, from various writers on the conti∣nent, as well as from GERARD, PARKIN∣SON, and LOBEL. The place of growth to each plant is noticed, and the particular spots where the rare ones grow, are specified. The list contains 1220 plants, which (as few mosses and fungi are enumerated) is a copious catalogue for that time, even ad∣mitting the varieties, which the present state of botany would reject.</P>
<P>The author of this little volume was unquestionably a man of very considerable learning, and had a strong passion for the knowledge of plants; but his situation in life does not seem to have allowed him the opportunity of travelling into the various parts of <HI>England,</HI> to gratify his taste in <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> botany, with which he was not criti∣cally and extensively acquainted. Mr. RAY, in the preface to his "<HI>Catalogus Plantarum Angliae,</HI>" has given a list of more than thirty species in the "<HI>Phytologia,</HI>" which have no title to a place as indigenous plants of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> Some of these being inhabitants of
<PB N="172" REF="191"/>
Southern Europe; others evidently the ac∣cidental outcasts of gardens; and some, as certainly, mistaken for other plants, as ap∣peared from the impossibility of finding them in the spots which How had pointed out.</P>
<P>The rare plants were almost wholly com∣municated by his friends, Mr. STONE∣HOUSE, Dr. BOWLES, Mr. HEATON, Mr. LOGGINS, Mr. GOODYER, and others. He drew some from a manuscript of Dr. JOHNSON, the editor of GERARD. I wish it were in my power to commemorate these persons in a more ample manner, who, at an early period, contributed to extend and illustrate English botany. Mr. STONE∣HOUSE, in particular, has deserved highly of the lovers of this science. He appears to have travelled much in <HI>England,</HI> from his recording the plants discovered by him in many counties. In <HI>Yorkshire</HI> he was particularly conversant; and, I conjecture, he lived at a place called <HI>Darfield,</HI> near <HI>Barnsley,</HI> in that county.</P>
<P>Dr. BOWLES, and Mr. GOODYER, are, I believe, the same persons mentioned under
<PB N="173" REF="192"/>
the article of JOHNSON. Of Mr. HEA∣TON, I shall take further notice in the se∣quel of these anecdotes.</P>
<P>It has been observed, that some of LO∣BEL's papers fell into the hands of PAR∣KINSON, and some into Dr. How's posses∣sion. These were the fragment of LOBEL's great work, which How published in 1655, under the subsequent title:</P>
<P>"<HI>Matthiae de</HI> LOBEL, <HI>M.D. botanographi regii eximii,</HI> STIRPIUM ILLUSTRATIONES, <HI>plurimas elaborantes inauditas plantas sub∣reptitiis Joh.</HI> PARKINSONI <HI>rapsodiis (ex co∣dice M.S. insalutato) sparsim gravatae, ejus∣dem adjecta sunt ad calcem Theatri Botanici</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Accurante Guil.</HI> How, <HI>Anglo.</HI>" Lond. 1655. 4<SUP>o</SUP>. pp. 170.</P>
<P>This work has been noticed under the article of LOBEL. It is sufficient to observe here, that the notes which the editor has affixed, would almost persuade the reader that he had published the work with a view to take an invidious retrospect of PARKIN∣SON's "Theatre." In the preface to the "<HI>Phytologia,</HI>" and in that of this work, both written in a flowery and bombast stile, as well
<PB N="174" REF="193"/>
as throughout the notes, he speaks of PAR∣KINSON in very contemptuous language, and represents him as having made LOBEL's observations his own, without acknow∣ledgment. Whatever may have been the case in particular instances, the attack, on the whole, was uncandid; since PARKIN∣SON, in the very title of his "<HI>Theatre,</HI>" pro∣fesses to have made use of, and inserted, Dr. LOBEL's notes, together with those of Dr. BONHAM and others. In fact, there is a pe∣tulance and an acrimony in the stile, both of the author and of the editor of this work, which, howsoever exampled in the last age, is, happily, much less frequently the lan∣guage of literature in the present.</P>

<HEAD>TRADESCANT.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH it does not appear that the TRADESCANTS contributed materially to amplify what is more especi∣ally meant by English Botany, or the disco∣very and illustration of the plants sponta∣neously growing in <HI>England:</HI> yet, in a work devoted to the commemoration of Botanists, their name stands too high not to demand an honourable notice; since they contributed, at an early period, by their
<PB N="176" REF="195"/>
garden and museum, to raise a curiosity that was eminently useful to the progress and improvement of natural history in general.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> TRADESCANT was by birth a Dutch man, as we are informed by A. <HI>Wood.</HI> On what occasion, and at what period, he came into <HI>England,</HI> is not precise∣ly ascertained. He is said to have been, for a considerable time, in the service of Lord Treasurer SALISBURY and Lord WOOTON. He travelled several years, and into various parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> as far eastward as into <HI>Russia.</HI> He was in a fleet that was sent against the <HI>Algerines</HI> in 1620, and mention is made of his collecting plants in <HI>Barbary,</HI> and in the isles of the Mediterranean. He is said to have brought the <HI>trifolium stella∣tum Lin.</HI> from the isle of <HI>Fermentera;</HI> and his name frequently occurs in the second edition of GERARD by JOHNSON; in PAR∣KINSON's "Theatre of Plants," and in his "Garden of Flowers," printed in 1656. But I conjecture that TRADESCANT was not resident in <HI>England</HI> in the time of GE∣RARD himself, or known to him.</P>
<P>He appears however to have been esta∣blished

in <HI>England,</HI> and his garden founded at <HI>Lambeth;</HI> about the year 1629 he ob∣tained the title of gardener to <HI>Charles</HI> I. TRADESCANT was a man of extraordinary curiosity, and the first in this country, who made any considerable collection of the sub∣jects of natural history. He had a son of the same name, who took a voyage to <HI>Virginia,</HI> from whence he returned with many new plants. They were the means of introduc∣ing a variety of curious species into this kingdom; several of which bore their name. <HI>Tradescant's Spiderwort, Tradescant's Aster,</HI> are well known to this day; and LINNAEUS has immortalized them among the Bota∣nists, by making a new genus, under their name, of the <HI>Spiderwort,</HI> which had before been called <HI>Ephemeron.</HI> His Museum, called <HI>Tradescant</HI>'s Ark, attracted the curiosity of the age, and was much frequented by the great, by whose means it was also much enlarged, as appears by the list of his bene∣factors, printed at the end of "his MUSEUM TRADESCANTIANUM;" among whom, after the names of the king and queen, are found those of many of the first nobility.</P>
<P>This small volume, the author entitled

"MUSEUM TRADESCANTIANUM; or, a Collection of Rarities preserved at South <HI>Lambeth,</HI> near <HI>London.</HI> By <HI>John</HI> TRA∣DESCANT." 1656, 12<SUP>o</SUP>. It contains lists of his birds, quadrupeds, fish, shells, insects, minerals, fruits, artificial and miscellaneous curiosities, war instruments, habits, utensils, coins, and medals. These are followed by a catalogue, in English and Latin, of the plants of his garden, and a list of his be∣nefactors. The reader may see a curious account of the remains of this garden, drawn up in the year 1749, by the late Sir <HI>William</HI> WATSON, and printed in the 46th volume of the Philosophical Transactions. Prefixed to this volume were the prints of both father and son; which, from the cir∣cumstance of being engraved by HOLLAR, has rendered the book well known to the collectors of prints, by whom most of the copies have been plundered of the impres∣sions.</P>

<HEAD>R. TURNER, CULPEPPER, and LOVELL.</HEAD>
<P>The influence of Astrology in Physic and Botany, was far from being worn out in the middle of this age. By the credulity and superstition of some, and the dishonesty of others, it still maintained its ground. Se∣veral
<PB N="180" REF="199"/>
physicians, and other men of learning, shewed some bias towards it. Many prac∣titioners of an inferior class, and numerous empirics, were still advocates for astrological influence in the preparation and application of simples.</P>
<P>There is an Herbal written by <HI>Robert</HI> TURNER, who calls himself <HI>Botanologiae Studiosus,</HI> under the title of "BOTANO∣LOGIA, the British Physician; or, The Nature and Vertues of English Plants; exactly describing such as grow naturally in the land, with their several names, Greek, Latin, or English; natures, places where they flourish, and are most proper to be gathered; their degrees of tempera∣ture, applications, and vertues, physical and astrological uses treated of, &amp;c." London, 1664, 12<SUP>o</SUP>. But, of the astro∣logical herbalists, <HI>Nicholas</HI> CULPEPPER stands eminently forward. His "Herbal," first printed in 1652, which c ontinued for more than a century, to be the manual of good ladies in the country, is well known; and, to do the author justice, his descriptions of common plants were drawn up with a
<PB N="181" REF="200"/>
clearness and distinction that would not have disgraced a better pen.</P>
<P>Yet there is one author of this order, whose respectability might exempt him from to∣tal oblivion. <HI>Robert</HI> LOVELL's "compleat Herbal," although said to be written by him whilst a young man, is of so singular a complexion, as to merit notice in a work of this kind, were it only to regret the mis∣application of talents, which demonstrate an extensive knowledge of books, a won∣derful industry in the collection of his ma∣terials, and not less judgment in the ar∣rangement. The first edition was printed in 1659; the second in 1665, in 8<SUP>o</SUP>. at <HI>Ox∣sord,</HI> pp. 672, exclusive of the introduc∣tion of 84 pages, and bears the following title, "PAMBOTANOLOGIA: <HI>sive Enchi∣ridion Botanicum;</HI> or, A compleat Her∣bal; containing the sum of antient and modern authors, both Galenical and Chymical, touching trees, shrubs, plants, fruits, flowers, &amp;c. in an alphabetical order, wherein all that are not in the physic garden in <HI>Oxford</HI> are noted with asterisks. Shewing their place, time,
<PB N="182" REF="201"/>
names, kinds, temperature, virtues, use, dose, danger, and antidotes; together with an introduction to herbarisme, &amp;c. an appendix of exotics, and an universal index of plants, shewing what grow wild in <HI>England;</HI> 2d edition with additions." <HI>Oxford,</HI> 1665, 12<SUP>o</SUP>.</P>
<P>To those whose curiosity leans that way, it may not be easy to direct them to a more concise, or more perfectly methodical ar∣rangement of simples, according to the Ga∣lenical principles of the four elements, tem∣peraments, and qualities, than may be met with in the introduction to this book.</P>
<P>The arrangement of the matter in the work itself is according to the alphabet of the English names; to which is subjoined the place of growth, the time of flowering, then the name in Greek, and the Latin of∣ficinal term. There are no descriptions of the plants; but the qualities and uses of each are collected from a profusion of au∣thors, and applied to all the species under each generical term; the form in which the medicine should be given, the authority for each carefully cited, and the officinal
<PB N="183" REF="202"/>
compounds into which they enter assidu∣ously noticed. The author includes simples, both of exotic and of indigenous growth.</P>
<P>He professes to have cited near two hun∣dred and fifty authors, of which he gives the list. At p. 482 begins an appendix on the drugs of the East and West Indies, ex∣tracted from the Arabians, and from HER∣NANDEZ. A copious index of names to all the plants of his "Herbal," with the synonyms; especially of the older au∣thors; of such as are mentioned in TRA∣DESCANT; BAUHINE's <HI>Pinax;</HI> of those which are in the foreign botanical gardens, and not in that of <HI>Oxford;</HI> and lastly, of those in the PHYTOLOGIA BRITANNICA. The work concludes with a large index of diseases, with the appropriate remedies from the simples of his work. In his catalogue of authors, he gives the number of figures contained in their works, which I transcribe as a matter of curiosity, that cannot fail to gratify the botanical reader<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<HEAD>SALMON.</HEAD>
<P>If my readers will excuse the anachronism, I am here tempted to anticipate the name of an author, the complexion of whose
<PB N="186" REF="205"/>
writings renders it not improper to notice him after CULPEPPER and LOVELL; al∣though in the time he lived, the influence of astrology had lost still more of its power. To the fastidious critic in Botany, it might need some apology, that I introduce into these anecdotes the name of SALMON; well known as a multifarious writer, and author of numerous publications in physic, all of the empirical cast. I confess, however, I could not pass over, in total silence, a writer to whom, although no praise can be due as a botanist, yet the commendation of industry ought not to be withheld from a man who could bestow twenty years labour, in the compilation of "an Herbal" of 1296 pages, in folio. I will recite the title, which will sufficiently shew the nature of his work.</P>
<P>"The ENGLISH HERBAL; or, His∣tory of Plants; containing, 1. Their names, <HI>Greek, Latin,</HI> and <HI>English.</HI> 2. Species, or various kinds. 3. Descrip∣tions. 4. Places of growth. 5. Times of flowering and feeding. 6. Qualities or properties. 7. Their specifications. 8. Preparations, Galenic and Chymic.

9. Virtues and uses. 10. A compleat <HI>florilegium</HI> of all the choice flowers culti∣vated by our florists, interspersed through the work, in their proper places, where you have their culture, choice, increase, and way of management, as well for pro∣fit as delectation, adorned with exquisite icons, or figures of the most considerable species. By <HI>William</HI> SALMON, M.D." <HI>London,</HI> fol. 2 vol. 1711.</P>
<P>The order of SALMON's book is alphabe∣tical, and, as it is a work of mere compila∣tion, he professes to have consulted all the botanical authors of repute, and enumerates the names of such. His design was to treat on medicinal herbs principally. As a bo∣tanical work it is beneath all criticism; the errors in this way being enormous, both in multitude and degree. In detailing the powers of simples, he follows the Galenic terms of expression ufed by the writers of the preceding century, and distributes, with a lavish hand, extraordinary and numerous powers to almost every herb he describes. Exclusive of his industry, some merit is due to SALMON for the regular arrangement of
<PB N="188" REF="207"/>
his subjects, subordinate to his method; qualities which, under the direction of more skill in Botany, and a sounder judge∣ment in discriminating the properties of simples, might have enabled him to have executed more effectually what seems to have been his purpose, that of superseding the Herbals of GERARD and PARKINSON, in which he totally failed. His tables, I have noticed heretofore, in speaking on wooden cuts. But from these authors I return to writers of dignity and importance; and, with peculiar satisfaction, to the view, especially, of a character, from whose pene∣trating genius, and persevering industry, not Botany alone, but Zoology, may date a new aera. On this occasion I singularly lament, that I am not furnished with any new ma∣terials to illustrate the life of RAY; of whom it may with truth be maintained, that in these branches of natural history, he became, without the patronage of an <HI>Alexander,</HI> the <HI>Aristotle</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Linnaeus</HI> of the time.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>RAY.</HEAD>
<P>IF we here take a retrospective view of the progress of botany during the first period of the seventeenth century, we find that, however particular individuals, both in <HI>England</HI> and on the continent, might have laboured in its advancement, it was not, on the whole, in a flourishing state, either here, or in any other part of <HI>Europe.</HI> From the time of the BAUHINES, even to that of RAY, its progress as a science was slow. The Remains of <HI>John</HI> BAU∣HINE, his "<HI>Historia Plantarum Univer∣salis,</HI>" printed in 1650, in three large
<PB N="190" REF="209"/>
folio volumes, at the expence of 40,000 florins, defrayed by F. L. <HI>à Graffenreid,</HI> was the principal performance on the con∣tinent, and that indeed was invaluable. It is a monument of learning and industry, of which few examples can be expected in any one age. That which GESNER performed for zoology. <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE effected in botany. It is, in reality, a repository of all that was valuable in the ancients, in his immediate predecessors, and in the discove∣ries of his own time, relating to the history of vegetables, and is executed with that accuracy and critical judgment which can only be exhibited by superior talents.</P>
<P>The obstacles to the improvement of botany were various. <HI>Europe</HI> had been in∣volved in war, the perpetual enemy to free intercourse among the learned; and to commerce, which is ever friendly to natural science. Simples were neglected in physic, for medicines drawn from chymistry. Even alchymy yet employed the industry of many in every nation of <HI>Europe.</HI> Botanical gar∣dens, although several, both public and pri∣vate, had been established, did not, however,
<PB N="191" REF="210"/>
flourish. The <HI>Indies</HI> had not yet poured in their treasures with that liberal hand which was soon after experienced. Even the pas∣sion of the florist for varieties assisted in depressing the genuine spirit of the bota∣nist. But the time was now approaching, when botany was about to receive a capi∣tal advantage and embellishment, by the introduction and establishment of <HI>system;</HI> of the rise and progress of which, it will not be incongruous to my plan to give a short account, since this great revolution formed a new aera in the history of the science. As the revival of it, however, did not take place till the time of Mr. RAY and Dr. MORISON, I will postpone what I have to say on this subject, till I have given some account of the writings of those justly celebrated naturalists, by whose la∣bours system itself was restored and im∣proved.</P>
<P>The earliest anecdotes of Mr. RAY, to which I can refer, are some brief outlines of his life, in the "Compleat History of Eu∣rope for the year 1705." A more con∣nected account of this learned and excellent man may be seen in the "General Dictio∣nary,"
<PB N="192" REF="211"/>
and the "Biographia Britannica;" but the most detailed relation is that of Dr. SCOTT, published in 1760, from ma∣terials collected by Dr. DERHAM. This is well abridged in the <HI>Biographical Dictio∣nary.</HI> It is much to be regretted, that our curiosity has not been more amply grati∣fied than by these short and imperfect me∣moirs.</P>
<P>A more circumstantial narrative of the life of Mr. RAY would, even at this distance of time, be a valuable accession to biography, and highly grateful to those, who are sensible of the great improvements which he gave to the science of natural history in general; nor could sufficient justice be done to his manifold talents, discoveries, and writings, but by a pen of the first eminence in bio∣graphical literature.</P>
<P>The limits of my plan will not allow of more than a general detail of the principal events of his life, as connected in chrono∣logical order with his writings.</P>
<P>John <HI>Wray,</HI> or, as he always spelt his name after the year 1669, RAY, was born at <HI>Black Notley,</HI> near <HI>Braintree,</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> Nov. 29,
<PB N="193" REF="212"/>
1628. His father, though in so humble a situation as that of a blacksmith, sent his son to the grammar-school at <HI>Braintree;</HI> and in 1644, entered him at Catherine Hall, in <HI>Cambridge;</HI> from whence he removed, in less than two years, to Trinity College, where the politer sciences were more culti∣vated. Dr. BARROW was his fellow pupil, and intimate friend, and, on account of their early proficiencies, both were the fa∣vourites of their learned tutor, Dr. DU∣PORT. He was chosen minor-fellow of Trinity, in 1649; in 1651, was made Greek lecturer of the college; in 1653, mathe∣matical lecturer; and in 1655, humanity reader. These appointments were sufficient testimonies of his talents and abilities at this early period. He afterwards passed through the offices of the college, and be∣came tutor to many gentlemen of honour∣able birth and attainments, who gave him due praise and acknowledgments for his watchful care of them. He also distin∣guished himself, while in college, as a sen∣sible and rational preacher, and a sound divine. As his favourite study was the
<PB N="194" REF="213"/>
works of God, he laid, at this time, in his college lectures, the foundation of his "Wisdom of God in the Creation," and of his "Three Physico-theological Dis∣courses;" which were afterwards so well received by the public.</P>
<P>At the period when Mr. RAY turned his attention to the study of nature, the know∣ledge of plants was not highly superior to the state in which TURNER had found it, in the same place, more than a century be∣fore. In this study RAY could find no master. I am not able to say, that a single publication, of a scientific nature, on the subject of plants, had ever appeared at <HI>Cam∣bridge;</HI> for <HI>Maplet</HI>'s "Green Forest" will scarcely be thought worthy of that appella∣tion. <HI>Oxford</HI> had, indeed, not only experi∣enced the benefit of private encouragement, but of public munificence, in the establish∣ment of a Garden. But at the sister uni∣versity Mr. RAY stood alone, himself indeed an host! Self-taught as he was, and full of ardour, he so forcibly displayed the uti∣lity of botanical knowledge, and its inti∣mate connection with the arts, and conve∣niences
<PB N="195" REF="214"/>
of life, independent even of those charms, which the views of nature ever af∣ford to contemplative minds, that he soon made it an object of attention; and num∣bered among his associates in these studies, Mr. NID, a senior fellow of his own col∣lege, Mr. <HI>Francis</HI> WILLUGHBY, and Mr. <HI>Peter</HI> COURTHOPE. The first of these gentlemen became his inseparable compa∣nion; but he had the misfortune to deplore his death, a little time before the publica∣tion of his first work, which came out under the title of "CATALOGUS PLANTARUM CIRCA CANTABRIGIAM NASCENTIUM." <HI>Cantab.</HI> 1660." pp. 182. <HI>cum Indicibus,</HI> &amp;c. pp. 103. 12<SUP>o</SUP>.</P>
<P>This little volume contains all the plants which the author had observed spontane∣ously growing in the neighbourhood of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> amounting to 626, all varieties and dubious plants excluded. The num∣ber is small, when compared with many modern catalogues; but not so, when it is recollected, that, at that period, a very few of the <HI>Cryptogamia</HI> class, and not many of
<PB N="196" REF="215"/>
the <HI>Graminaceous</HI> tribe, had been investi∣gated.</P>
<P>The plants are disposed in the alphabeti∣cal order of the <HI>Latin</HI> names; and the syno∣nyms of the four principal authors then in use given at length. These are GERARD and PARKINSON, and the two BAUHINES; nor are others wanting, when characteristic of the plant. Prefixed is a list of the au∣thors, so accurately and instructively drawn up, as not to have lost its utility to this day. Mr. RAY has interspersed many se∣lect observations, on the medicinal and oeco∣nomical uses of the plants; on the struc∣ture of the flower; on varieties: and has not only described some new plants, disco∣vered by himself, but given accurate dis∣tinctions of many, before imperfectly known. Subjoined, the reader finds an index of the <HI>English</HI> names, preceding the <HI>Latin;</HI> an in∣dex, specifying the particular places of the more rare plants; then, a copious etymo∣logy of the names, and an explanation of the terms used in the science. In fine, he has done every thing to facilitate the labour
<PB N="197" REF="216"/>
of the student in this part, as in the for∣mer to instruct and entertain the more erudite reader.</P>
<P>I have been the more diffuse on this small volume, as the author has observed nearly the same plan, in his subsequent catalogues, and SYNOPSIS. <HI>Moles parva, Vis magna.</HI> When the time in which this publication was made, and the meagre structure of pre∣ceding catalogues is considered, I may safely appeal to modern judges, whether this was not an extraordinary production. Few lo∣cal catalogues had been published at home; and, I believe, not one abroad, that dis∣played any thing like a comparable share of science and erudition, so aptly united.</P>
<P>Among the variety of notes in this cata∣logue, there is one, possibly not of public notoriety. Mr. RAY informs us, that the people of <HI>Norwich</HI> had long excelled in the culture and production of fine flowers; and that in those days, the florists held their annual feasts, and crowned the best flower with a premium, as at present.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt that this volume met with the most favourable reception
<PB N="198" REF="217"/>
from the learned in this way; that it pro∣moted the study of plants; and, by raising the reputation of its author, encouraged him to prosecute his studies with vigour.</P>
<P>These occupations, however, did not di∣vert Mr. RAY from his object of entering into the ministry. He was, in Dec. 1660, ordained both deacon and priest, by Dr. <HI>Sanderson,</HI> bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and conti∣nued fellow of <HI>Trinity College</HI> till the Bar∣tholomew act; which, as he did not sub∣scribe, necessarily superseded him. This event took place Sept. 18, 1662.</P>
<P>The desire Mr. RAY had to extend his knowledge of <HI>English</HI> botany, had induced him, in the autumn of 1658, to take a jour∣ney, which he performed alone, through the midland counties of <HI>England,</HI> and the nor∣thern part of <HI>Wales,</HI> in search of plants. This tour held him from August 9, to September 18. Of this, and of two other tours, Mr. RAY preserved some short me∣morandums, in which he has noticed his daily progress, some remarkable facts that occur∣red, some observations on the antiquities that he met with, and some of the rare
<PB N="199" REF="218"/>
plants. Dr. SCOTT has published these <HI>Itineraries,</HI> with his life.</P>
<P>In his subsequent journies, he was com∣monly accompanied by some friends of a congenial taste; thus, in his second tour, in the autumn of 1661, Mr. WILLUGHBY, and some other gentlemen, travelled with Mr. RAY into <HI>Scotland,</HI> through the coun∣ties of <HI>Durham</HI> and <HI>Northumberland,</HI> to <HI>Edin∣burgh, Glasgow,</HI> and back through <HI>Cumber∣land</HI> and <HI>Westmorland.</HI> This journey held six weeks, from July 26, to August 30. In 1662, Mr. RAY, accompanied by Mr. WILLUGHBY, took his third and most ex∣tensive <HI>English</HI> tour; through the middle counties of <HI>England,</HI> into <HI>Cheshire;</HI> thence into <HI>North Wales,</HI> and through the middle <HI>Welch</HI> counties, into <HI>Pembrokeshire,</HI> coasting the southern part, to <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Bristol;</HI> thence to the <HI>Land's End,</HI> through <HI>Somerset</HI> and <HI>De∣von;</HI> returning through <HI>Dorsetshire, Wilt∣shire,</HI> and <HI>Hampshire.</HI> They were absent in this excursion, from May 8, to July 18; and Mr. RAY gathered a plentiful harvest, which afterwards enabled him to enrich his general "Catalogue of <HI>English</HI> Plants,"
<PB N="200" REF="219"/>
then in meditation; nor did he omit to avail himself of every opportunity, particularly at <HI>Tenby,</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> and in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> of de∣scribing such birds and fishes as were less frequent in other parts, preparatory to his intended publications in the zoological way.</P>
<P>In 1663 he published an <HI>Appendix</HI> to the "Cambridge Catalogue," containing emen∣dations, and the addition of forty-two plants. And in 1685, came out another <HI>Appendix,</HI> with the addition of sixty more, not noticed before; which were principally communicated by Mr. DENT, of <HI>Cambridge.</HI> These little tracts are become very scarce. Those who are curious to see what these additional plants were, may find them dis∣tinguished from the others in Professor MARTYN's "<HI>Plantae Cantabrigienses.</HI>"</P>
<P>Being now at liberty from the constraints and business of a college life, he was led to accompany Mr. WILLUGHBY, Mr. SKIP∣PON, and Mr. <HI>Nathaniel</HI> BACON, two of them his pupils, to the continent. Mr. RAY was absent from April 18, 1663, to March 1665-6; during which time, they
<PB N="201" REF="220"/>
visited <HI>France, Holland, Germany, Switzer∣land, Italy;</HI> and extended their journey to <HI>Sicily</HI> and to <HI>Malta.</HI> The fruit of this ex∣pedition will afterwards appear.</P>
<P>On his return from the continent, he spent the summer of 1666 between his friends in <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> and in reading the publications which had appeared in <HI>England</HI> during the three years of his ab∣sence. The winter passed in reviewing and arranging the museum of his friend and pu∣pil, Mr. WILLUGHBY, rich in animal and fossil productions; in arranging his own catalogues for his general list of <HI>English</HI> vegetables; and in framing the tables for Dr. WILKINS's "Real, or Universal Cha∣racter."</P>
<P>In the summer of 1667, Mr. RAY, ac∣companied by his much-honoured friend, Mr. WILLUGHBY, made his fourth excur∣sion into the distant counties. They left <HI>Middleton Park</HI> on June 25, and took their route to the <HI>Land's End,</HI> through the coun∣ties of <HI>Worcester, Gloucester,</HI> and <HI>Somerset;</HI> and returned through <HI>Hants</HI> to <HI>London</HI> on September 13. In this journey, besides the
<PB N="202" REF="221"/>
pointed objects of their pursuit, they took notes on the mines, and smelting, and on the method of making salt; and Mr. RAY did not omit to make, as he had done be∣fore, ample additions for his collections of proverbs and of local <HI>English</HI> words.</P>
<P>On Nov. 7, of this year, he was chosen fellow of the Royal Society, and was pre∣vailed on by Bishop WILKINS to translate his "Real Character" into <HI>Latin.</HI> This he performed, though it was never pub∣lished; and the manuscript is extant in the library of the Royal Society. The latter end of the year, and the beginning of 1668, he spent with gentlemen who had all been his pupils at Trinity; Mr. BURREL, and Mr. COURTHOPE, at <HI>Danny,</HI> in <HI>Sussex;</HI> Sir <HI>Ro∣bert</HI> BARNHAM, at <HI>Bocton,</HI> in <HI>Kent;</HI> and with Mr. WILLUGHBY, in <HI>Warwickshire.</HI> In the autumn of this year, he took his fifth journey, alone, into <HI>Yorkshire</HI> and <HI>West∣morland,</HI> returning in September to <HI>Middle∣ton Hall;</HI> and spent the winter with Mr. WILLUGHBY, then lately married.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>RAY.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT this time Dr. TONGE, Dr. BEAL, and some other philosophical gentlemen, in <HI>England,</HI> were busied in ex∣periments relating to the motion of the sap in trees. Among these also, in the spring of 1669, Mr. RAY and Mr. WILLUGHBY entered upon a set of the like experiments, and induced Mr. (afterwards Dr.) LISTER, to prosecute the same. These experiments were made on the birch, the sycamore or greater maple, the alder, the ash, the hasel, chesnut, walnut, and willow; of which the two first
<PB N="204" REF="223"/>
were found to be the best adapted to the purpose, from their bleeding most freely.</P>
<P>The experiments of Mr. RAY and Mr. WILLUGHBY, which were printed in the fourth volume of the <HI>Philosophical Trans∣actions,</HI> proved the ascent and descent, as well as the lateral course, of the sap; but these gentlemen declined giving any deci∣sive opinion, as to a real circulation up∣wards by the vessels of the wood, and downwards by those between the wood and the bark; which was the doctrine main∣tained soon after this time by GREW and MALPHIGI, and indeed afterwards adopt∣ed by Mr. RAY himself.</P>
<P>This doctrine of the circulation of the sap, I need scarcely remark, gave way to the experiments of Dr. HALES and others; which teaches, that the sap rises and falls, in the same system of vessels, as it is affected by the joint operations of air and warmth. Yet there have not been wanting ingenious men of late years, also, who, conceiving the analogy between animals and vegetables to be greater than is usually imagined, and even that plants not only live, but feel, have
<PB N="205" REF="224"/>
advanced it as still probable, that there is a real circulation of the juices; the <HI>succus com∣munis</HI> rising from the roots, and the <HI>succus proprius</HI> descending towards them. Whe∣ther these physiologies will yield to the <HI>pro∣lepsis plantarum</HI> of the LINNAEAN school, time must evince.</P>
<P>When Mr. RAY was at <HI>Chester,</HI> in 1669, he availed himself of an opportunity of viewing a young porpess, and of attend∣ing the dissection of it. Of the anato∣mical structure of this animal, he com∣municated a circumstantial account to the R. S. in 1671; and it was printed in the <HI>Philosophical Transactions,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 74 and 76.</P>
<P>In 1671, Mr. RAY wrote a paper, print∣ed in the <HI>Philosophical Transactions,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 74, on the subject of "Spontaneous Genera∣tion," a point of philosophy which had been much discussed, and to which some among the learned were yet attached. It appears from this paper, that he very early rejected this doctrine, and was confirmed in his opinion by the experiments of REDI.</P>
<P>We are now to reap the fruit of Mr. RAY's repeated journies into the various
<PB N="206" REF="225"/>
parts of <HI>England,</HI> taken with a professed view, to ascertain the <HI>loci natales</HI> of all the native plants, more accurately than had yet been done; to investigate the more rare, and perchance to discover new ones. In each of these departments he had proved success∣ful, and in this year drew up his "Cata∣logue," and dedicated it to his friend and Maecenas Mr. WILLUGHBY, under the fol∣lowing title, "CATALOGUS PLANTARUM ANGLIAE <HI>et insularum adjacentium tum indigenas tum in agris passim cultas com∣plectens.</HI>" <HI>Lond.</HI> 1670, pp. 358. 8<SUP>o</SUP>.</P>
<P>This work is modelled after the <HI>Cam∣bridge</HI> Catalogue in general, as to the order of the subject, except that the author has been much more sparing of the synonyms, from all authors but the four classial wri∣ters, GERARD, PARKINSON, and the two BAUHINES. Several new plants are de∣scribed in this volume, and many doubtful ones discriminated, with that critical accu∣racy which so singularly marked his pen; and which had not before been seen in any <HI>English</HI> writer.</P>
<P>Hitherto the <HI>cryptogamous</HI> and <HI>gramina∣ceous</HI>
<PB N="207" REF="226"/>
tribe, had engaged but little atten∣tion; and in this volume, these classes do not far exceed the number registered in the <HI>Cambridge</HI> Catalogue. The whole number of plants in this list, amount to about 1050 only. This small number had been owing to the extreme caution of Mr. RAY, not to admit any varieties to hold the place of species; and to exclude all others on doubt∣ful authority. How, in his "<HI>Phytologia,</HI>" has upwards of 1200; and MERRETT, in his "<HI>Pinax,</HI>" upwards of 1400; certain proofs that the authors had not sufficiently studied the nicer distinctions, which guided the judgment of Mr. RAY; and as a proof, it may be observed, that many of their plants are to this day undiscovered. Sensible as Mr. RAY was of the errors of MERRETT's "<HI>Pinax,</HI>" he purposely omitted quoting it, as he writes to Dr. LISTER, that he might avoid that censure of it, which could not properly have been withheld, had he given his impartial opinion of that performance.</P>
<P>In this year, he informs Dr. LISTER, that he had, what he thought, a most libe∣ral offer, of one hundred pounds a year, and
<PB N="208" REF="227"/>
all his expences defrayed, to accompany three young gentlemen abroad. But he declined it, although he much wished to have taken a review of the alpine plants. Indisposi∣tion had some share in this refusal, and we find that in the next spring, 1671, he suf∣fered much from a jaundice. He was so far recovered, however, before <HI>July,</HI> as to be able to set off on his sixth journey, in which he took with him <HI>Thomas</HI> WILLISEL, an unlettered man, but one, whose love for plants, and his zeal and assiduity in collect∣ing them, merits commemoration. They travelled through <HI>Derbyshire, Yorkshire,</HI> and all the northern counties, as far as to <HI>Ber∣wick,</HI> and back through the bishoprick of <HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>In the same year died, to the unspeakable loss and grief of Mr. RAY, his most valua∣ble friend <HI>Francis</HI> WILLUGHBY, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> on <HI>July</HI> 3d, in the 37th year of his age. The strictest intimacy had subsisted between them, from the time of their being fellow collegians; and it was cemented by a con∣geniality of taste, which not unfrequently forms a stronger bond of union, than the
<PB N="209" REF="228"/>
ties of blood. Mr. WILLUGHBY had im∣bibed, very early, a strong taste for the study of the animal kingdom, and had made extraordinary collections for compleating the "History of Birds and Fishes;" in which he had ever been assisted by his friend Mr. RAY; who experienced his high attachment and confidence, in being left one of his executors, and charged with the education of his two sons, the eldest of whom, was not four years of age. To this care he liberally annexed an annuity of sixty pounds per annum for life, which was ever regularly paid.</P>
<P>Immediately after this melancholy event, he desisted from journeying again into the western counties, as he had intended; and refused an invitation from Dr. LISTER, to live with him at <HI>York;</HI> in order to give himself up to the faithful discharge of his trust.</P>
<P>For the use of these young gentlemen, Mr. RAY drew up, in 1672, his <HI>Nomen∣clator Classicus,</HI> induced thereto by observ∣ing the multitude of errors in the names of plants and animals, in the manuals of daily use. This compilation had authority
<PB N="210" REF="229"/>
enough to recommend itself to subsequent writers of dictionaries and lexicons, and has been reprinted several times.</P>
<P>On <HI>November</HI> 19th, 1672, he sustained, in the death of Bishop WILKINS, the loss of another of his best friends. For this candid, ingenious, and learned man, he had a sincere esteem and veneration.</P>
<P>In the lot of human life, such chasms are not easily filled up after the age of forty-five. It is however not unreasonable to con∣jecture, that these privations added strength to his motives for domestic retirement, and accelerated at least, that connexion he made the next year, when he married Mar∣garet the daughter of Mr. <HI>John Oakely,</HI> of <HI>Launton,</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire.</HI> They were mar∣ried in the church of <HI>Middleton,</HI> on <HI>June</HI> the 5th, 1673.</P>
<P>In the same year Mr. RAY gave to the public the fruit of his foreign travels, under the title of, "Observations, topographical, moral, and physiological, made in a jour∣ney through part of the Low Countries, <HI>Germany, Italy,</HI> and <HI>France.</HI>" <HI>London,</HI> 1673. 8<SUP>o</SUP>. pp. 499.</P>
<P>The great object of accompanying his
<PB N="211" REF="230"/>
three associates in this tour, was, the en∣largement of his knowledge in natural his∣tory, and particularly in the vegetable king∣dom; and the great number of plants ob∣served and collected by him, exceeded, as he informs us, his expectation: not that any opportunities escaped him of describing the birds and fishes of the several countries they passed through, in aid of Mr. WIL∣LUGHBY's plans. His notes concerning those of <HI>Germany,</HI> were unfortunately lost. The volume before us, however, is by no means confined to natural history. Mr. RAY treats on the manners of the people, and expatiates often on the excellencies and defects of the several governments, particu∣larly of the cities on the continent, and on the state of the academies and universities. He does not omit to notice the antiquities that occurred and of those at <HI>Rome,</HI> he gives a very methodical account. Besides many miscellaneous remarks on various other parts of natural history, he has taken occa∣sion to make a digression, which, at that time, must have been of a very interesting nature, on the most remarkable places,
<PB N="212" REF="231"/>
where petrified shells and figured fossils are found, both in <HI>England</HI> and elsewhere; and on the various opinions of authors, re∣lating to the origin of these bodies. He freely declares his sentiments, that they are the remains of once-organized bodies, in opposition to those who imagined them to be the product of what they called a <HI>plastic</HI> power. He afterwards confirms his posi∣tions, by additional arguments recited in a letter to Dr. ROBINSON. See <HI>Letters,</HI> p. 165.</P>
<P>In the course of their journey, he every where notices those plants that are not na∣tives of <HI>England,</HI> and gives copious cata∣logues of them. They spent in the whole, six months at <HI>Geneva,</HI> which gave Mr. RAY an opportunity of informing himself largely, relating to the plants of <HI>Switzer∣land,</HI> particularly those of Mount <HI>Sa∣leve,</HI> the <HI>Dole,</HI> and of Mount <HI>Jura.</HI> He even discovered some that were unknown to the preceding botanists, although these were the regions of GESNER, and the BAUHINES.</P>
<P>The celebrated HALLER, even ranks
<PB N="213" REF="232"/>
him among those who made large accessions to the Botany of that country, and gives the strongest testimony of his skill, fidelity, and judgment, in discriminating, describing, and extricating the plants of that fruitful region.</P>
<P>To the end of these "Observations," is affixed an alphabetical list of the plants mentioned in the body of the book, under the title of "CATALOGUS STIRPIUM IN EXTERIS REGIONIBUS, <HI>à nobis observata∣rum, quae vel omnino vel parcè admodum in Anglia sponte proveniunt.</HI>" pp. 115.</P>
<P>In the arrangement he cites the same au∣thors for synonyms as in his preceding ca∣talogues, and occasionally introduces obser∣vations on the qualities and uses.</P>

<HEAD>RAY.</HEAD>
<P>THE talents of Mr. RAY were not confined to natural history. He had a relish, among other departments of litera∣ture, for philological enquiries, and the ge∣nius of the <HI>English</HI> language had engaged much of his attention. Of his pursuits in this way, he has left memorials, which have extended his reputation beyond the sphere of natural history, and made him known to the learned world in general.</P>
<P>I refer to his "Collection of <HI>English</HI> Proverbs," and to his "Collection of
<PB N="215" REF="234"/>
<HI>English</HI> Words." The foundation of these publications was laid in his various tours through the different parts of <HI>England.</HI> His "Proverbs" were finished for the press in 1669, but not published till 1672, and a second edition, much enlarged, in 1678, under the following title: "A COLLEC∣TION OF ENGLISH PROVERBS, digested into a convenient method for the speedy finding one upon occasion; with short annotations. Whereunto are added local proverbs, with their explications, old pro∣verbial rhythmes, less known, or exotic proverbial sentences and <HI>Scottish</HI> pro∣verbs. Enlarged by the addition of many hundred <HI>English,</HI> and an appendix of <HI>He∣brew</HI> proverbs, with annotations and pa∣rallels." <HI>Cambridge.</HI> 8<SUP>o</SUP>. pp. 414.</P>
<P>It has been reprinted many times, and, I think, so lately as in the year 1768.</P>
<P>To collect these sententious maxims of knowledge, both of a moral, prudential, and even a jocular nature, has not been deemed unworthy employment, by men of eminent learning and intelligence. The Adagies of ERASMUS furnish a sufficient
<PB N="216" REF="235"/>
example of the estimation he gave them. They were an oral and traditionary kind of didactics, which bore a greater value before the diffusion of knowledge by the use of printing; and, in oriental countries, are still a favourite and usual mode of instruction.</P>
<P>Of such as have been handed down in <HI>Britain,</HI> from father to son, through nu∣merous generations, Mr. RAY's collection contains an ample store. It is, I believe, the principal in its way; and the author has interspersed many notes, which illustrate the origin and sense of these aphoristic les∣sons, and throw no small light on the manners and customs of various people.</P>
<P>In 1674, was published, his "COLLEC∣TION OF ENGLISH WORDS not gene∣rally used, with their significations, and original, in two alphabetical catalogues, one of the northern, and the other of the southern counties. To which is added, an account of the preparing and refining such metals and minerals as are gotten in <HI>England.</HI>" <HI>London,</HI> 12<SUP>o</SUP>.</P>
<P>This little volume is dedicated to his friend Mr. COURTHOPE, at whose sugges∣tion,
<PB N="217" REF="236"/>
he tells us, it was undertaken, and who contributed largely to augment it. In the first edition was a catalogue of the <HI>English</HI> birds and fishes; but this was omitted in a subsequent improved and enlarged edition, in 1691, Mr. RAY having then projected his "<HI>Synopsis Animalium.</HI>"</P>
<P>This is one of those philological collec∣tions, which tends to amuse and gratify gene∣ral curiosity, is of use, not only to strangers and those who travel, but to those who stay much at home; while it contributes to en∣large the extent, and illustrate the construc∣tion of the <HI>English</HI> tongue. Mr. <HI>Thoresby,</HI> of <HI>Leeds,</HI> sent to Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> a large addition to this list in the year 1703, which was printed in his "Philosophical Letters," by Dr. <HI>Derham.</HI></P>
<P>In 1675, he communicated to the <HI>Royal Society</HI> some experiments, made, I believe, by Mr. WILLUGHBY, accompanied with his own observations, tending to ascertain the true use of the <HI>air-bladder</HI> in fishes. They are such as the present physiology of fishes have confirmed; and were printed in the Philosophical Transactions, N<SUP>o</SUP> 115.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="237"/>
In the year 1677, his "Catalogue of <HI>English</HI> plants" being out of print, he gave another edition, augmented with new observations, and the addition of 30 species of the more perfect plants, and 16 <HI>funguses;</HI> several of these were new discoveries. He here also gives the figures of the <HI>pentaphylloides fruticosa, (potentilla fruticosa Lin.)</HI> and the <HI>fungus phalloides (phallus impudicus Lin.)</HI></P>
<P>Mr. RAY continued, after his marriage, to reside at <HI>Middleton Hall,</HI> where his engage∣ments at this period of his life, were such as called forth all the talents of his literary abilities, and demanded all his care as a faithful guardian. He was employed in a double duty, that of his trust to the sons of his late estimable friend, and of editor to the remains of their father, "On the His∣tory of Birds and Fishes." The <HI>Ornitho∣logy</HI> was first published, to which, as it consisted of loose papers, written in <HI>Latin,</HI> and in an undigested state, Mr. RAY gave method, and supplied, from his own obser∣vations, a large share of valuable materials. It was published under the following title: "ORNITHOLOGIAE LIBRI TRES: <HI>in quibus,</HI>
<PB N="219" REF="238"/>
<HI>Aves omnes hactenus cognitae, in methodum na∣turis suis convenientem redactae accuratè descri∣buntur. Iconibus elegantissimis et vivarum avium simillimis aeri incisis illustrantur. Totum opus recognovit, digessit, supplevit Johannes</HI> RAIUS." <HI>Lond.</HI> 1676, fol. pp. 307, t. 77, f. 353.</P>
<P>Mr. RAY translated this work into <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> and published it, with large additions, in 1678, with figures engraved at the ex∣pence of Mrs. WILLUGHBY. The exe∣cution of the figures was wholly inadequate to the merit of the work. These occupa∣tions, however, did not prevent him from renewing a correspondence with Mr. OL∣DENBURGH, secretary of the Royal Society, a learned German, who, after having re∣sided some time at <HI>Oxford,</HI> had been chosen into that office at the first establishment of the society. Mr. RAY, in the year 1674, was induced to engage, at the request of the society, with other distant members, to furnish observations on the subjects of na∣tural history, to be read at their meetings; the society notwithstanding the extreme di∣ligence of the secretary, and some few
<PB N="220" REF="239"/>
others, being, at this juncture, rather in a languishing state.</P>
<P>On this occasion he wrote several papers, of which some were afterwards printed in the <HI>Philosophical Transactions.</HI> Among those, which were not published, as we find by his letters, were the following. "On the Acid of Ants: On a Fossil of the figured Kind, found in <HI>Malta,</HI> and known by the name of St. <HI>Paul's Bastoons Letters,</HI> p. 120: On the <HI>Trochites:</HI> On Mushrooms: On the Darting of Spiders: On the Seeds of Plants; and on the specific Differences of Plants."</P>
<P>On the death of the mother of his friend, the Dowager Lady WILLUGHBY, and the removal of his sons from under Mr. RAY's tuition, he retired, some time in the year 1676, to <HI>Sutton Cofield,</HI> about four miles distant from <HI>Middleton Hall,</HI> where he remained till Michaelmas 1677. He then made a second removal to <HI>Falkborne Hall,</HI> near <HI>Black Notley;</HI> at which last place he built a house, and finally settled <HI>June</HI> 24, 1679.</P>
<P>Mr. WILLUGHBY's <HI>Icthyology</HI> remaining
<PB N="221" REF="240"/>
yet unpublished, Mr. RAY, in 1684, ar∣ranged the materials, which had been left in a very imperfect and indigested state. Perhaps no one but Mr. RAY could have fulfilled this posthumous office; certainly no man so effectually, since Mr. RAY had not only himself entirely furnished Mr. WILLUGHBY with many, but even the remainder had chiefly been collected during their almost daily intercourse, and whilst travelling together.</P>
<P>He wrote the two first books himself; revised, methodised, and enlarged the whole; and sent it to the Royal Society; the mem∣bers of which contributed to furnish the plates; and, by the assistance of Bishop FELL, it was printed at <HI>Oxford;</HI> the Royal Society being at the whole expence. It came out under the following title:</P>
<P>"<HI>Francisci</HI> WILLOUGHBEII, <HI>Armig. De</HI> HISTORIA PISCIUM, LIBRI <HI>quatuor, jussu et sumptu</HI> S. RAY. <HI>Lond. editi. Totum opus recognovit, coaptavit, supplevit, librum etiam primum et secundum integros adjecit</HI> J. RAIUS." Oxon. 1686. fol. pp. 343.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>RAY.</HEAD>
<P>MR. RAY being settled at <HI>Black Not∣ley,</HI> and delivered from that anxiety which had attended him since Mr. WIL∣LUGHBY's death, resumed with great vigour his wonted study of plants; and, having al∣ready acquired a reputation that justified any expectation his friends might have formed, he, in compliance with their wishes, at∣tached himself seriously to write "A Gene∣ral History of Plants."</P>
<P>Preparatory to this great work, which he intended to arrange systematically, he put forth, in 1682, his "METHODUS PLAN∣TARUM," enlarged, and improved, from the
<PB N="223" REF="242"/>
synoptical tables, which he had printed in Bishop WILKINS's "Real Character," in 1668. It bears the following title:</P>
<P>"METHODUS PLANTARUM NOVA <HI>bre∣vitatis et perspicuitatis causâ synoptice in ta∣bulis exhibita: cum notis Generum tum sum∣morum tum subalternorum characteristicis. Observationibus nonnullis de seminibus Plan∣tarum et indice copioso.</HI>" Lond. 1682. 8<SUP>o</SUP>. pp. 166.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS, on what authority I know not, mentions an edition of this work, with the date of 1665, totally separate from that of 1682; but as that is earlier than Bishop WILKINS's Table, it is probably a mis∣take.</P>
<P>The first principle of Mr. RAY, in this work, is to preserve all plants together, as far as possible, in the natural characters, arising from conformity in the fructifica∣tion, and in the general habit. Hence arose, with him, in common as with others, too great a neglect of the flower, and too much attention to the leaves. He adheres to the ancient division of the vegetable kingdom, into trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants;
<PB N="224" REF="243"/>
ranking, however, with the latter, such as had been called <HI>Suffrutices,</HI> or shrubby. <HI>Trees</HI> he divides into nine classes, account∣ing the last anomalous; <HI>Shrubs</HI> into six; and <HI>Herbs</HI> into forty-seven.</P>
<P>In the progress of his improvements after∣wards, he reduced these classes to thirty-three. His method, which is indeed ex∣tremely elaborate, will best be seen by a view of the classes. It will, however, be but justice to refer the account to the last edition, that it may appear in the greatest perfection which he gave it.</P>
<P>To this book Mr. RAY has subjoined a clear, concise view, and a synoptical table, of the system of CAESALPINE, and gives his reasons for not adopting it; although he candidly confesses his obligations to the author, whom he acknowledges to be the parent of system.</P>
<P>In 1683 and 1684, Mr. RAY and Dr. <HI>Tancred</HI> ROBINSON exchanged several let∣ters, while the latter was on a foreign tour, relating to various undetermined facts in natural history; among which, it had been difficult to settle the exact species of the
<PB N="225" REF="244"/>
<HI>Macruse,</HI> a bird allowed by the Roman Catholics to be eaten in Lent. Their ob∣servations relating to this particular were published in the <HI>Phil. Trans.</HI> for 1685, in No. 172. It proved to be the <HI>Scoter,</HI> or <HI>Anas nigra Linnaei.</HI></P>
<P>We are now come to that performance, which LINNAEUS and HALLER so justly stile <HI>Opus immensi laboris;</HI> and which, con∣sidered as the work of one man, has per∣haps been exceeded by none, unless indeed by that of <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE, who, however, did not live to put the finishing hand to his labour.</P>
<P>Mr. RAY informs us, that it was at the persuasion of his friend, Mr. WILLUGHBY, that he began to collect materials, with a view to a General History of Plants. But that, after the loss of his friend in 1672, he relaxed; and, on hearing that Dr. MO∣RISON was employed on a similar design, from which considerable expectations were formed, at length gave up his purpose. On the decease of Dr. MORISON in 1683, who left the much greater part of his work un∣finished, by the persuasion of his friends,
<PB N="226" REF="245"/>
and particularly of Mr. HOTTON, to whom it was dedicated, he resumed his design, and prosecuted the work with vigour. We can∣not sufficiently admire the wonderful assi∣duity and address of this great man, which enabled him, in four years, to collect such a stock of matter, as to furnish two folio volumes, of near one thousand pages each. It even does not appear that he had the assistance of an amanuensis in this labour; which he effected, however, with a skill and judgment that gained him the applause of all succeeding masters in the science.</P>
<P>This important undertaking was intended by the author to comprehend the whole botany of the age, by describing separately, and reducing to his own system, all the plants of the BAUHINES, and of those who had enlarged the stock by subsequent dis∣coveries. These, at the publication of RAY's first volume, were, the plants of <HI>Mexico,</HI> from HERNANDEZ; those of <HI>Brasil,</HI> from PISO and MARCGRAAVE; and of the <HI>East Indies,</HI> from BONTIUS. The rare plants of <HI>Italy,</HI> from ZANONI; the new plants of MORISON, BREYNIUS, and MENTZEL.

The <HI>Sicilian</HI> plants of BOCCONE; but above all, the vast treasure of the six first volumes of the HORTUS MALABARICUS; with many from works of lesser note.</P>
<P>After prefixing an instructive list of the writings of near an hundred botanical au∣thors, quoted by him in the body of the book, and giving an explanation of terms, there follows a very comprehensive account of the philosophy of vegetables; in which the anatomy and physiology of plants, from MALPHIGI, from GREW, and from his own experiments; the differences of the parts of vegetables, from JUNGIUS and others, are explained and illustrated, with that judg∣ment and knowledge of the subject, and with that conciseness and methodical accu∣racy, which, I believe, had rarely, if ever, been equalled by preceding writers. This has rendered the introduction to his His∣tory, a choice compendium of all that was valuable in the science of his day; nor is the information it conveys so far superseded by any subsequent discoveries, as to render it, even now, an uninteresting tract. It is not easy to refer the modern student to a
<PB N="228" REF="247"/>
more perfect view of the state of this sci∣ence near the close of the last century, than will here be found; while the work itself exhibits the great improvement it had re∣ceived, since the beginning of the same pe∣riod, and to which the author had himself contributed in an eminent degree.</P>
<P>The first volume was published in the year 1686, under the following title: "HIS∣TORIA PLANTARUM GENERALIS: <HI>species hactenus editas aliasque insuper multas noviter inventas et descriptas complectens; in qua agi∣tur primò de plantis in genere, earumque par∣tibus, accidentibus, et differentiis▪ deinde gene∣ra omnia tum summa tum subalterna ad species usque infimas, notis suis certis et characteris∣ticis definita, methodo naturae vestigiis insistente disponuntur; species singulae accuratae descri∣buntur, obscura illustrantur, omissa suppleatur superflua resecantur, synonyma necessaria adji∣ciuntur: vires denique et usus recepti compen∣diò traduntur.

Vol. II. pp. 985-1944. <HI>preter indices.</HI> 1688.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="248"/>
In the general arrangement of the sub∣ject, according to his own system, he has in various instances improved the classes. At the head of each book or class is prefixed a synoptical table of all the chapters or <HI>ge∣nera.</HI></P>
<P>In the particular disposition, after prefix∣ing to each chapter the etymology of the generical name, he gives the character of the <HI>genus;</HI> and in the enumeration of the species, quotes at length the synonyms of <HI>Caspar</HI> BAUHINE, from his "<HI>Pinax,</HI>" and those of <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE, GERARD, and PARKINSON, from their respective histories; seldom introducing others, where the plant was known to any of these writers.</P>
<P>His descriptions of the old plants are taken from the above-mentioned authors. They are commonly abridged, however; and in numberless instances amended, from his own knowledge of the plants. He fails not to notice from whom they are taken, and has every where distinguished the <HI>British</HI> plants from the exotics. He has carefully marked all such as he had not had an opportunity of inspecting himself. He adds the places of
<PB N="230" REF="249"/>
growth, and times of flowering, and sub∣joins select observations, from the most re∣spectable authorities, relating to the quali∣ties and various uses of them.</P>
<P>In the "History of Trees," the no∣bler and more capital parts of the vegetable kingdom, as being dignified by the variety of their uses in human oeconomy, he has extended his researches, and collected, with much assiduity, a greater variety of interest∣ing particulars. Mr. RAY has purposely avoided entering into nice and critical dis∣quisitions relating to the species; for, besides that this would have swelled his work to an enormous bulk, it was become less ne∣cessary, after the descriptions given by <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE, CLUSIUS, and others, so much superior to those of their predecessors; and the more curious and critical examiner might be referred to these authors, for ample scope to his curiosity.</P>
<P>Mr. RAY has described, in these vo∣lumes, about 6900 plants; including, how∣ever, in this number, many which modern botanists have since considered as varie∣ties.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="250"/>
The <HI>Addenda</HI> to the second volume con∣tain several interesting catalogues; such are those of ZANONI's History, consisting of new <HI>Italian, Swiss,</HI> and <HI>Milanese</HI> plants; those of BREYNIUS; a catalogue of the plants of <HI>Virginia,</HI> observed by Mr. BANIS∣TER; and a compend of those of <HI>Mexico,</HI> from HERNANDEZ, who, at the expence of sixty thousand ducats, had procured the paintings of 1200 species, which pe∣rished in a fire of the Escurial.</P>
<P>In the preface to the first volume, Mr. RAY acknowledges his obligations for as∣sistance received from many of his friends. Among those who had more essentially contributed to enrich his work, were, Sir <HI>Edward</HI> HULSE, Dr. <HI>Tancred</HI> ROBINSON, Dr. SLOANE, and his near neighbour, Mr. DALE. To these he adds, in the second volume, the names of <HI>William</HI> COURTINE, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of the Middle Temple, Dr. PLUKE∣NET, Mr. DOODY, and Mr. PETIVER.</P>
<P>There are copies of RAY's History, with the date of 1693; but I believe the title-page only to be new, the remaining
<PB N="232" REF="251"/>
copies of the impression by <HI>Faithorne,</HI> fal∣ling into the hands of <HI>Smith</HI> and <HI>Walford</HI> about that time. Foreign writers mention an edition so late as 1716; but this I sus∣pect to be a mistake, or owing to another transfer of the copies.</P>
<P>After the first edition of the "<HI>Catalogus Plantarum Angliae</HI>" was out of print, Mr. RAY had been exhorted by his friend, Dr. <HI>Ralph</HI> JOHNSON, to arrange the second ac∣cording to system; but not having suffi∣ciently elaborated his method, at that time, he declined it; and it came out in 1677, in the alphabetical order.</P>
<P>A third edition being wanted, however, after the publication of the "History of Plants," he meditated throwing it into the systematic sorm; and, in the mean time, put forth, in 1688, "FASCICULUS STIR∣PIUM BRITANNICARUM, <HI>posl editum Plan∣tarum Angliae Catalogum observatarum.</HI>" Lond. 8<SUP>o</SUP>. By this little volume, a con∣siderable accession was made to <HI>English</HI> botany: several very rare mountainous or <HI>Alpine</HI> plants, from <HI>Wales;</HI> some scarce ones
<PB N="233" REF="252"/>
from <HI>Cornwall;</HI> sea plants; new fungi; mosses, and grasses, make their first ap∣pearance in this little catalogue.</P>
<P>The "SYNOPSIS," although finished for the press soon after this "<HI>Fasciculus,</HI>" was not published, owing to the delay of the printer, till 1690, when it appeared under this title, "SYNOPSIS METHODICA STIR∣PIUM BRITANNICARUM, <HI>in qua tum notae generum characteristicae traduntur, tum spe∣cies singulae breviter describuntur:</HI> 250 <HI>plus minus novae species, partim suis locis inseran∣tur, partim in appendice seorsim exhibentur; cum indice et virium epitome.</HI>" 8<SUP>o</SUP>. pp. 317.</P>
<P>As Mr. RAY had dedicated the "<HI>Alpha∣betical Catalogue</HI>" to his great friend and <HI>Mecaenas, Francis</HI> WILLUGHBY, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> so he now shews the same respect to <HI>Thomas,</HI> the only surviving son of his much-ho∣noured patron; whom he exhorts to pursue the example of his excellent father, and for whom he pours forth, in the most energe∣tic language, all those ardent wishes which gratitude and respect for the memory of the father, and love for the pupil, could alone inspire.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="253"/>
In the preface, Mr. RAY acknowledges the assistance he received from Mr. BO∣BART, superintendant of the garden at <HI>Ox∣ford;</HI> Mr. DALE, his neighbour, a learned and ingenious apothecary at <HI>Braintree;</HI> Mr. <HI>Matthew</HI> DODSWORTH; Mr. <HI>Samuel</HI> DOO∣DY, an apothecary in <HI>London,</HI> memorable for having been the first who extended the <HI>Cryptogamous</HI> class; Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI> LAWSON, of <HI>Strickland,</HI> in <HI>Westmorland;</HI> Mr. <HI>James</HI> NEWTON, a diligent and skilful botanist; Dr. <HI>Edward</HI> LLOYD, of <HI>Oxford;</HI> Mr. <HI>James</HI> PETIVER; Dr. <HI>Robert</HI> PLOTT; Dr. PLUKE∣NET; Dr. <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE; Mr. <HI>William</HI> SHERARD, at that time fellow of St. <HI>John</HI>'s College, <HI>Oxford;</HI> and Dr. <HI>Tancred</HI> ROBIN∣SON, to whom Mr. RAY communicated his manuscript of this work, and for whose corrections and additions, he held himself eminently obliged.</P>
<P>The <HI>Appendix</HI> contains a list of scarce plants, communicated by Mr. BOBART; some new plants by Mr. SHERARD; a list of those of <HI>Jersey,</HI> by the same; new and rare species, with critical observations, from Dr. PLUKENET; <HI>musci</HI> and rare plants, by
<PB N="235" REF="254"/>
Mr. DOODY; emendations and additions, by Dr. <HI>Tancred</HI> ROBINSON; and a cata∣logue of thirty-four species, common both to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> communicated by Dr. SLOANE. In this work, Mr. RAY has thrown the observations on the qualities and uses into the index.</P>
<P>From this time the "SYNOPSIS" became the pocket companion of every <HI>English</HI> bo∣tanist. It contributed not a little, both to facilitate and improve the science. It dif∣fused the knowledge of system; and, by ob∣liging those who wished for improvement, to attend more minutely to generical cha∣racters, led to a nicer discrimination of both <HI>genera</HI> and <HI>species.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>RAY.</HEAD>
<P>TO this period Mr. RAY had appear∣ed to the public principally as a na∣turalist; but he now united to this charac∣ter that of the theologist. It is needless to say, that he succeeded in this department, perhaps beyond most of those who had be∣fore written on the same subject. His first publication of this kind, we are told, was
<PB N="237" REF="256"/>
originally, and in its outlines, <HI>College Exer∣cises</HI> only, or <HI>Common Places.</HI> These he now wrought up, and enlarged into a con∣venient volume, and trusted it to the care of his friend, Dr. <HI>Tancred</HI> ROBINSON, who procured five hundred copies to be printed, under the following title: "THE WIS∣DOM OF GOD MANIFESTED IN THE WORKS OF THE CREATION." 8<SUP>o</SUP>. 1691. It was reprinted the next year. The ele∣venth edition was published in 1743; and a twelfth in 1758; and, I believe, several times since: and it has been translated into foreign languages. These are sufficient tes∣timonies of the esteem with which it was received by the public.</P>
<P>It is not immediately within my plan to enlarge on this work, or to determine whe∣ther the arguments <HI>à priori,</HI> or <HI>à posteriori,</HI> are best calculated to obtain the object of it, "Demonstration of the Being of a God." "<HI>Qui historiam naturae, naturae etiam Creato∣rem colit.</HI>" I may be allowed to observe, that Mr. RAY, from that comprehensive view of nature which his mind embraced, was singu∣larly well qualified to display the manifold
<PB N="238" REF="257"/>
wonders of the creation, and the wisdom of its omnipotent Author. And thus, while his penetrating views enabled him to unfold the various oeconomy and evolutions of na∣ture to the greatest advantage, his piety and humility give a force to his reasonings and deductions, that carries with it a conviction of that great truth he so sincerely wished to inculcate.</P>
<P>The favourable acceptance the public gave to the "Demonstration," encouraged Mr. RAY to publish, the next year, his "THREE PHYSICO-THEOLOGICAL DIS∣COURSES concerning the primitive Chaos, and Creation of the World. The general Deluge, its causes and effects. The Dis∣solution of the World, and future Confla∣gration." 8<SUP>o</SUP>. 1692. and 1693. 1713. pp. 456. 1721. 1732. It is embellished with a plate of the <HI>Apamaean</HI> medal, and three tables of figured fossils; and is dedi∣cated to Archbishop TILLOTSON.</P>
<P>This work is a convincing proof of the extensive reading, the various erudition, and multifarious knowledge, of this great and good man. Independent of all the theories
<PB N="239" REF="258"/>
it contains, this volume exhibits such an assemblage of facts, relating to the struc∣ture of this globe, to the changes it has undergone, and to the history of figured fossils, that it may be read to advantage, even in this age of advanced curiosity, and knowledge in the professed object of this book. Even the fastidious critic, who is versed in all the more modern theories, down to the "Epochas of Nature," and those of <HI>M. De</HI> LUC, and <HI>De</HI> SOULAVIE, will allow that this volume, when respect is had to the time of its publication, must have conveyed a large share of intelligence to those who were capable of gratification from disquisitions of this nature; and that, with a deference to the opinions of the day, there is yet a freedom of enquiry that dis∣tinguishes the author, as a friend to true philosophy, and as a modest and candid en∣quirer after truth, in those points of natural history, which still continue, and probably long will, to be involved in great obscurity.</P>
<P>In this year, Mr. RAY wrote some "Observations on the Planting of <HI>Maize</HI> instead of <HI>Pease,</HI>" occasioned by a pro∣posal
<PB N="240" REF="259"/>
of Sir <HI>Richard</HI> BULKLEY, in which he says, that he had found the greatest yield of pease to be twenty barrels reaped for one sown; whereas, from one grain of <HI>Indian wheat,</HI> he had calculated the pro∣duce would be upwards of 2000 grains for one. These Observations were printed in the <HI>Phil. Trans.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 205. Mr. RAY was not sanguine in his expectations from the culture of that grain; neither have subse∣quent trials proved the utility of it in this climate.</P>
<P>The botanical labours of this eminent man were now remitted, at least for some time; and we find, that after the publica∣tion of his "<HI>History,</HI>" and the "<HI>Synopsis,</HI>" his exertions were turned into another channel, in which he also stood unrivalled in his day. It was not botany alone that he raised from a drooping state; to zoo∣logy, considered as a science, he might be said to have given birth, in these kingdoms; since, except what himself and Mr. WIL∣LUGHBY had performed, nothing of im∣portance on the history of animals existed.</P>
<P>TOPSELL's "Abridgment of GESNER,"
<PB N="241" REF="260"/>
MOFFAT's "Book on Insects;" and the short and imperfect essays of CHARLETON, in his "<HI>Onomasticon,</HI>" and of MERRET, in his "<HI>Pinax,</HI>" were almost the only <HI>English</HI> writers to be consulted. To assert that better helps were wanted, is not to injure, or to degrade those authors. Mr. RAY had been urged by his friends, and particularly by Dr. ROBINSON, to undertake an entire FAUNA ANGLICA, and a history of <HI>Fos∣sils</HI> also; but age and infirmities began now to oppress him, and he thought himself in∣adequate to the attempt. He lived, how∣ever, to perform more than his fears, or his humility permitted him to hope.</P>
<P>In 1693, he published his "SYNOPSIS METHODICA ANIMALIUM, QUADRUPE∣DUM, <HI>et</HI> SERPENTINI GENERIS; <HI>vulgarium notas characteristicas, rariorum descriptiones integras, exhibens: cum historiis et observationi∣bus anatomicis, perquam curiosis. Praemittun∣tur nonnulla de animalium in genere, sensu, gene∣ratione, divisione, &amp;c.</HI>" Lond. 8<SUP>o</SUP>. pp. 336.</P>
<P>In this volume we see the first truly sys∣tematic arrangement of animals, since the days of ARISTOTLE; an arrangement which
<PB N="242" REF="261"/>
his successors in the same line have equally applauded, and availed themselves of. It is professedly the basis of that method, by which the present eminent zoologist of this nation, has chosen to convey his learned publications, and by which he has not less happily diffused a taste for this science, than he has successfully improved its store.</P>
<P>In treating on animals in general, intro∣ductory to his work, he discusses some im∣portant questions, which had not then ceased to agitate the philosophical world. He controverts, with extreme force of rea∣soning, the ideas of equivocal or sponta∣neous generation; the <HI>Lewenhoekian</HI> hypo∣thesis; and that of all animals being created from eternity, and only latent in an in∣volved state. I know not where the reader can see these questions discussed with equal conciseness and judgment united.</P>
<P>Mr. RAY's Distribution of Animals is not wholly founded, as to the grand divisions, on the <HI>Aristotelian</HI> distinctions; though he admits many of them. It is not within my plan to enter on this subject; it is sufficient to observe, that <HI>Quadrupeds</HI> here form two great
<PB N="243" REF="262"/>
divisions, as they are <HI>boofed</HI> or <HI>digitated;</HI> the former, as they are <HI>whole</HI> or cloven; the latter, as they are <HI>divided</HI> into more, or fewer claws; admitting also of subdivisions or <HI>genera,</HI> from the number of the claws, and in some, from the consideration of the teeth.</P>
<P>At the time when Mr. RAY lived, few people had acquired a taste for this kind of knowledge, and commerce had not lent her friendly aid, as in later times. What ani∣mals came under his own inspection, he has described with his accustomed accu∣racy; from GESNER and ALDROVAND he borrows his descriptions of others; and many later discovered subjects he drew from PISO and MARCGRAAVE, from CLU∣SIUS, HERNANDEZ, LAET, and NIEREM∣BERG.</P>
<P>In the course of this work, he has, in va∣rious instances, given the anatomical struc∣ture, from Dr. TYSON, from the "<HI>Parisian</HI> Dissections," and other works. Through∣out the whole, he has shewn how intimately he was acquainted with the learning of the ancients, and particularly with ARISTOTLE,
<PB N="244" REF="263"/>
whom, as the parent of zoological know∣ledge, he failed not to consult on all oc∣casions, but by no means implicitly to fol∣low, in his subtleties and obscurities.</P>
<P>On finishing the "Synopsis of Quadru∣peds," Mr. RAY immediately drew up that of the <HI>Birds</HI> and <HI>Fishes.</HI> This was an easier task at this time, since they are to be considered as compends of his preceding labours with his friend, Mr. WILLUGHBY; although there were many things new in both, and that of the Fishes was very greatly improved as to the arrangement and method. He informs us, that the addi∣tions were, the <HI>Mexican</HI> birds, from HER∣NANDEZ; some descriptions of new species, out of NIEUHOFF; MARTIN's Birds and Fishes of <HI>Greenland;</HI> SIBBALD's Whales; SLOANE's <HI>Jamaica</HI> Birds and Fishes; and some from the <HI>Leyden</HI> Catalogue, by Dr. ROBINSON.</P>
<P>In these branches of nature, Mr. RAY again appears as the parent of method. The accurate BRISSON regards RAY and WILLUGHBY, as the first true systematic writers on birds. These works were finished
<PB N="245" REF="264"/>
in the year 1693 or 1694, as we learn from Mr. RAY's letters, and from the testimony of his friend and neighbour, Mr. DALE. Yet, excellent as they were, so scanty was the taste for natural history at this period, that the manuscripts lay unpublished in the booksellers hands, till they were purchased by Mr. INNYS, and prepared for the press by Dr. DERHAM, who added the figures, and inserted Mr. BUCKLEY's Birds from <HI>Madrass,</HI> and Mr. JAGO's <HI>Cornish</HI> Fishes. They were published in 1713, under the titles of "SYNOPSIS METHODICA AVI∣UM." 8<SUP>o</SUP>. pp. 198. t. 2; and "SYNOP∣SIS METHODICA PISCIUM." 8<SUP>o</SUP>. pp. 162. t. 1.</P>
<P>In the same year, 1693, Mr. RAY became the editor of a translation of "Dr. RAU∣WOLF's Travels." This physician, who was the next after BELON, whom the love of natural history alone, led to travel into the east, spent the years 1573-4-5 in tra∣versing <HI>Syria, Mesopotamia, Palestine,</HI> and <HI>Aegypt,</HI> induced, as he tells us, by his desire to behold, in the native places, the plants of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> physicians.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="265"/>
His "Travels" having been published in 1583, in the <HI>German</HI> language, had hi∣therto been locked up from the <HI>English</HI> reader. Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE having, how∣ever, read them, was induced, in concert with Capt. HATTON, to procure a transla∣tion of them, which was done by <HI>Nicholas</HI> STAPHORST. This version was put into Mr. RAY's hands, to revise and correct. He did more; he made a choice selection from other authors, who had made the same tour, BELON, ALPINUS, Sir <HI>George</HI> WHELER, &amp;c. and he drew up a Cata∣logue of the more rare Plants of those countries through which RAUWOLF tra∣velled; and added lists of those of <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Crete.</HI> From this circumstance, the book has gone by the name of "RAY's COLLECTION OF TRAVELS;" and it was reprinted with his own "Observa∣tions," in 1738. RAUWOLF made an "<HI>Herbarium,</HI>" while in the east; which, with his <HI>European</HI> plants, constituted four large volumes. These became the property of Queen <HI>Christina,</HI> and afterwards, by her means probably, of <HI>Isaac</HI> VOSSIUS, who in∣formed
<PB N="247" REF="266"/>
Capt. HATTON, that 400 <HI>l.</HI> ster∣ling had been offered for them. They were purchased of his heirs by the university of <HI>Leyden;</HI> and the late Dr. <HI>Frederick</HI> GRO∣NOVIUS constructed from them an elegant and learned "<HI>Flora Orientalis;</HI>" of which he much enhanced the value, by prefixing to it <HI>Melchier</HI> ADAMS's "Life of RAU∣WOLF," with large additions of his own.</P>
<P>The "CATALOGUS STIRPIUM IN EX∣TERIS REGIONIBUS OBSERVATARUM" being out of print, Mr. RAY was induced to give a new edition of it, with such large augmentations, as to make it a new work. He added from CLUSIUS, from the BAU∣HINES, and other authors, a number of plants growing in those regions through which he passed in his tour; and so many catalogues from other authors, as to render it a tolerably complete list of all the <HI>Euro∣pean</HI> plants, not natives of <HI>England.</HI> As it does not immediately respect <HI>English</HI> botany, it will be sufficient to recite the title-page, from which its scope may be understood:</P>
<P>"STIRPIUM EUROPAEARUM <HI>extra Bri∣tannias</HI>
<PB N="248" REF="267"/>
<HI>nascentium</HI> SYLLOGE. <HI>Quas partim observavit ipse, partim à C. Clusii Historia; C. Bauhini Prodromo, et Catalogo Basiliensi; F. Columnae Ecphrasi; Catalogis Hollandi∣carum A. Commelini; Allorfinarum M. Hoff∣manni; Sicularum P. Bocconi; Monspelien∣sium P. Magnoli; collegit J.</HI> RAIUS. <HI>Adji∣ciuntur Catalogi rariorum Alpinarum et Py∣renaicarum, Baldensium, Hispanicarum Gris∣leii, Graecarum et Orientalium, Creticarum, Aegyptiacarum, aliique: ab eodem.</HI>" Lond. 1694. 8<SUP>o</SUP>. pp. 445.</P>
<P>In the preface to this work, Mr. RAY, for the first time, entered into controversy; having taken occasion to throw out some strictures on the method of botany pub∣lished by RIVINUS in 1690. It is not enough interesting at this day to dwell on the nature of it. It is sufficient to observe, that our veteran in science was dissatisfied with the <HI>German,</HI> for throwing the trees promiscuously into the classes with other plants, and for breaking into the natural orders, for the sake of agreement in the flower alone. In fact, RIVINUS's method being founded wholly on the flower, to
<PB N="249" REF="268"/>
which part RAY had paid but small regard, the sources of controversy were endless; since the fundamental principles of each were totally irreconcileable.</P>
<P>About this time Mr. RAY communica∣ted "The Provincial Catalogues of Plants," printed at the end of each county, in the edition of "CAMBDEN's <HI>Britannia,</HI>" pub∣lished in 1695 by Mr. GIBSON. His re∣peated travels throughout most parts of <HI>England,</HI> for the sole purpose of investigat∣ing the subjects of nature, had enabled him to accomplish more than had been done by any man before his time; and his unquestionable skill and accuracy, added an authenticity to these lists, which could not easily have been derived from any other hand.</P>
<P>To the county of <HI>Cornwall</HI> Mr. RAY added many other particulars; which, how∣ever, were not printed, probably because the corresponding circumstances could not be procured from other counties. These were, "Catalogues of the Sea Fish, and Sea Fowl, with the synonyms;" some account of two or three sorts of stone dug there; of sea sand, as manure; an account of the
<PB N="250" REF="269"/>
<HI>hurlers,</HI> and other stones; and notices re∣specting the manners and language of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Such as are conversant with that science, which was the favourite object of Mr. RAY, must be sensible that nothing could have happened more conducive to the revival and improvement of it at this juncture, than the circumstance of its having been taken up by a man of such patient industry, capable at the same time of giving it all the em∣bellishments, and advantages that learning could afford. They will readily grant that his writings and example alone, added more vigour, and brought more disciples to this school of natural science in <HI>England,</HI> than all the exertions of foregoing writers.</P>
<P>I cannot confirm and illustrate the truth of this position more effectually, than by calling to the attention of the curious in this kind of knowledge, the vast augmenta∣tion it acquired, in the interval between the publication of Mr. RAY's "<HI>Catalogus Plantarum Angliae,</HI>" and that of the "<HI>Sy∣nopsis;</HI>" and more especially between the time of the first and second edition of the
<PB N="251" REF="270"/>
latter work; during which, exclusive of the discovery of many subjects, among what were called the <HI>more perfect</HI> plants, a new and very extensive field had been opened, by exciting attention to the <HI>less perfect</HI> (as they were then accounted) and minuter kinds of vegetables, the <HI>Fungi, Fuci, Musci,</HI> and <HI>Algae,</HI> known now by the name of <HI>Cryptogamiae.</HI> During the first of these periods, 250 species had been added to the <HI>English Flora;</HI> and the accession in the last exceeded that number.</P>
<P>In no part of <HI>Europe</HI> had the same pro∣gress been made in the investigation of these hitherto much-neglected subjects, as in <HI>England,</HI> during the period above men∣tioned. This is sufficiently evinced by comparing the second edition of the "SY∣NOPSIS" with the contemporary writings of foreign botanists.</P>
<P>This second edition of the "SYNOPSIS" was printed in 1696. 8<SUP>o</SUP>. pp. 346. Mr. RAY himself had but a small share in the augmentations that were made to this edi∣tion. His advancing years and infirmities prevented him from making excursions. His
<PB N="252" REF="271"/>
principal auxiliaries are mentioned in the preface; in which, additional to the names in the former "SYNOPSIS," we meet with those of Mr. <HI>Edward</HI> LLHWYD, <HI>Walter</HI> MOYLE, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and Mr. <HI>William</HI> VERNON, fellow of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s College, <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>To those who are sensible of the obliga∣tions which the science owes to Mr. RAY, it cannot but be grateful to read, with what satisfaction the good man records, in this preface, the progress he had lived to see his favourite study make in his own country, and with what delight he augurs and con∣templates its future improvement. In the space of little more than twenty years, and under his own pen, he had seen the <HI>English Flora</HI> acquire an accession of up∣wards of 500 new subjects. The "CA∣TALOGUS PLANTARUM ANGLIAE" of 1670, containing about 1050, and the second edition of the "SYNOPSIS" in 1696, full 1600 species; and, notwith∣standing these have not all stood the test of the discriminating character of the present age, yet, in justice to this great man, and his associates, it must be acknowledged,
<PB N="253" REF="272"/>
that the retrenchments are comparatively few.</P>
<P>With this edition of the "SYNOPSIS," was published the "DISSERTATIO DE VARIIS PLANTARUM METHODIS BRE∣VIS;" in which Mr. RAY shews, that the separation of plants into classes and <HI>genera</HI> from the fructification alone, must be a very gradual and progressive affair; that it was not easy to exclude the habit from having a share in this distribution, since there were many plants that were sel∣dom or never seen in flower by the early botanists. He also observes, that number∣less plants, which agree in the structure of the flower; differ materially in habit, and others <HI>vice versa.</HI> And although his own method is principally founded on the fruit, yet he freely acknowledges its imperfections; but thinks the same objections hold against the flower; which he illustrates by shewing, in TOURNEFORT's system, the uncertainty of the bounds between the <HI>Flores infundi∣buliformes, hypocrateriformes,</HI> and the <HI>caryo∣phyllei.</HI> If Mr. RAY paid less regard to the flower than its importance seemed to de∣mand, it seems rather to have arisen from
<PB N="254" REF="273"/>
the principles of his method, than from his want of opportunities of examination, ow∣ing to his distance from botanical gardens, as was alledged by his opponents; a cir∣cumstance, however, which he very feeling∣ly laments in the preface to his "METHO∣DUS," and elsewhere.</P>
<P>To this is annexed, "EPISTOLA <HI>de</HI> METHODO PLANTARUM <HI>viri clarissimi D. A. Q. Rivini ad Raium, cum ejusdem respon∣soria, in qua D. Jos. Pitton Tournefortii, M. D. Elementa Botanica tanguntur.</HI>"</P>
<P>On the method of RIVINUS, Mr. RAY, as was before noticed, had thrown out some strictures in the preface to his "<HI>Sylloge,</HI>" which drew from that author the answer here published, and Mr. RAY's reply; in which our author takes occasion also to defend his method from the objections of TOURNEFORT, who had been unbecom∣ingly severe in some animadversions made in the "<HI>Elements of Botany,</HI>" published in 1694. TOURNEFORT, however, afterwards did ample justice to the merits of our au∣thor.</P>
<P>The modern botanist sees that all these controversies are become too little interest∣ing
<PB N="255" REF="274"/>
to dwell upon at this time. The prin∣ciples of the <HI>Corollistae,</HI> and the <HI>Fructistae,</HI> as LINNAEUS styles them, can never be assimilated, and all attempts to reduce the whole vegetable kingdom into natural classes have hitherto failed.</P>
<P>In 1697, he wrote "Some Observations on the Poisonous Effects of a Root eaten instead of Parsneps," supposed to have been that of the Hemlock; but of which Mr. RAY had some doubt, alledging, that it was more probably the <HI>Cicutaria vulgaris, (Chaerophyllum sylvestre,</HI> Lin.) See <HI>Phil. Trans.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 231. In N<SUP>o</SUP> 238, he communi∣cated "Remarks on the Poisonous Effects of the <HI>Oenanthe crocata,</HI>" too fatally confirmed by later mistakes of the same kind.</P>
<P>In the year 1700, Mr. RAY published "A PERSUASIVE TO A HOLY LIFE, from the Happiness which attends it both in this World and in the World to come." Lond. 8<SUP>o</SUP>. Reprinted in 1719. pp. 126. He tells us it was drawn up at the request of his friend, Mr. <HI>Edmund Elys,</HI> and that it is composed on the model of Bishop WIL∣KINS's
<PB N="256" REF="275"/>
"Treatise on Natural Religion." It is wholly of a moral and practical nature, written in a plain, but forcible and argu∣mentative style, and is entirely destitute of any of those enthusiastic or mystical opi∣nions, which so highly tinctured the writ∣ings of many divines of the last century. On the contrary, Mr. RAY, ever consistent and rational, although he deduces his prin∣cipal motives to the practice of virtue, as conducive to happiness, even in this life, from the precepts of Christianity; yet does not disdain, particularly in treating on plea∣sure, on riches, and the advantages of tem∣perance, to enforce his arguments by opi∣nions and apophthegms from the writings of the philosophers and moralists of ancient <HI>Greece,</HI> and <HI>Rome.</HI></P>

<HEAD>RAY.</HEAD>
<P>THE peaceable mind of Mr. RAY could not delight in the contentious field of controversy; on the contrary, he regretted the occasions that drew him into it: yet were they not without use, since they unquestionably stimulated him to pu∣rify and correct his own <HI>Methodus.</HI> This he effected in the year 1698, although at this time much declined in his health, being afflicted with ulcers of the lower extremi∣ties, the pain of which rendered his nights frequently sleepless, and wholly prevented him from making excursions to <HI>London,</HI> as he much desired, to examine the gardens and <HI>herbaria</HI> of the curious.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="277"/>
So small, however, was the demand for books in this science, at the entrance of this century, that the <HI>London</HI> booksellers were unwilling to risk the printing of it: and it was finally sent to <HI>Holland,</HI> and printed at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> under the care of Dr. HOT∣TON, the botanical professor at <HI>Leyden,</HI> who supervised the press, and procured 1100 copies to be thrown off, under the title of "METHODUS PLANTARUM EMENDATA ET AUCTA: <HI>accedit Methodus Graminum, Juncorum, et Cyperorum specialis.</HI>" 8<SUP>o</SUP>. pp. 202. 1703. Dr. HOTTON gave a further sanction to the system of his friend; he taught it in his lectures to the pupils of that university, and informed Mr. RAY of the good acceptance it met with on the continent, particularly in <HI>Italy.</HI> This vo∣lume was reprinted at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> in 1710, and at <HI>Tubingen</HI> in 1733.</P>
<P>In the preface he recapitulates his own progress in the formation of his system, and dates it from the tables drawn up in 1667 for the use of Bishop WILKINS. He very justly reprehends Dr. MORISON, for affect∣ing to have formed his method entirely
<PB N="259" REF="278"/>
from his own observations, without acknow∣ledging the smallest aid from former wri∣ters; briefly recites his objections to the methods of RIVINUS, TOURNEFORT, and HERMAN; and defends his own. He estab∣lishes some axioms, to be observed in fram∣ing a system of botany. In fact, Mr. RAY's method, though he assumes the fruit as the foundation, is an elaborate attempt, for that time, to fix natural classes. He establishes it as a rule, that no plant is to be separated from its tribe for a single note of difference; but that all are to be assimilated, as far as habit will allow. The characters of the <HI>genera</HI> are, however, highly incongruous; they are taken from vague principles, such as the shape of the leaf, colour of the flower, taste, smell, and sometimes from the size of the plant, and other as unstable distinctions.</P>
<P>In this amended edition, Mr. RAY still adheres to the ancient division into trees and herbaceous plants, having dropped the distinction of shrubs, preserved in the first edition. Here, all herbaceous, and shrubby∣stalked plants are divided into twenty-five <HI>genera</HI> or classes; as follow: <LIST>

<P>At this time, the consideration of Mr. RAY's method is a matter of mere curio∣sity; yet, in justice to this great man, it must be remarked, that his system, though less artificial than that of CAESALPINE, is
<PB N="262" REF="281"/>
much more highly elaborated than that of MORISON: and, though Mr. RAY must have taken infinite pains with it, yet is it difficult in practice; since the bases of the classes are not uniform. Of the thirty∣three, however, twelve are nearly com∣posed of natural orders. Such are the fol∣lowing:<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Fungi,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Musci,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Capillares,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Planipetalae,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Umbelliferae,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Stellatae,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Asperifoliae,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Verticillatae,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Pomiferae,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Siliquosae,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Leguminosae,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Culmiferae.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The remaining classes are combined of subjects less connected by habit and struc∣ture; and are therefore subject to more ar∣bitrary rules, drawn from the consideration of some one, or more parts, in the fructifi∣tion.</P>
<P>In the "METHODUS <HI>Graminum, Junco∣rum, et Cyperorum specialis,</HI>" annexed to this book, Mr. RAY's distribution rests princi∣pally on what may be called the habit of the fructification; all those <HI>genera,</HI> which
<PB N="263" REF="282"/>
in the <HI>Linnaean</HI> system are known by the names of <HI>Phalaris, Alopecurus, Dactylis, Agrostis, Aia, Poa, Briza,</HI> &amp;c. being called <HI>Gramen</HI> simply, with the epithets of the old authors annexed, expressive of the mode of bearing the parts of the fructification, whe∣ther in spikes, or panicles; as, <HI>Gramen tri∣ticeum; Gramen loliaceum; typhinum; Gra∣men paniculatum; miliaceum,</HI> &amp;c. In this <HI>Conspectus,</HI> however, all the species are introduced, to the amount of two hun∣dred.</P>
<P>Sixteen years had now elapsed since the publication of his "History of Plants;" in which interval botany had assumed a new face, and experienced a much greater revo∣lution and accession, than had ever taken place before. System had been studied, and in some measure established, both at home and abroad. An incredible number of new plants had been introduced, from all parts of the world, and cultivated with extreme care in the gardens of <HI>Europe.</HI> In the mean time, these circumstances had given rise to a great number of valuable publi∣cations. The remaining six volumes of
<PB N="264" REF="283"/>
that inestimable work, the "HORTUS MALABARICUS," had appeared: BREY∣NIUS, HERMAN, TOURNEFORT, PLU∣MIER, PLUKENET, BOCCONE, COMME∣LINE, BOBART, CUPANI, VOLKAMER, and RIVINUS, had enriched botany with valuable performances. These large aug∣mentations to the science induced Mr. RAY, notwithstanding his advanced years and ill health, to attempt a collection of these scattered materials, in order to form a supplemental volume to his "His∣tory;" and his industry enabled him to effect his purpose. Additional to the assist∣ances derived from all these printed works, he had access, by the favour of Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, to the MS. of his "History of <HI>Jamaica</HI> Plants" (of which the "<HI>Pro∣dromus</HI>" had been published in 1696) with liberty to select what he thought proper to his design.</P>
<P>From the same gentleman he enjoyed the benefit of an <HI>Herbarium</HI> of several hundred new and undescribed plants, collected in <HI>Ma∣ryland,</HI> by Mr. VERNON and Mr. KREIG, who had made a voyage thither for the
<PB N="265" REF="284"/>
sole purpose of gratifying their taste in bo∣tany. Mr. PETIVER freely communicated his stores, at that time very ample, though afterwards abundantly more so; and Dr. SHERARD engaged, besides supplying more than a thousand species himself, to take the trouble of inspecting the whole work before it went to the press, and of making such cor∣rections and additions as he judged proper.</P>
<P>It was the last of his works published in his life-time, and came out in 1704, with the following title:</P>
<P>"HISTORIAE PLANTARUM TOMUS TERTIUS, <HI>qui est</HI> SUPPLEMENTUM <HI>duorum praecedentium; species omnes, vel omissas, vel post volumina illa evulgata editas, praeter in∣numeras fere novas et indictas ab amicis com∣municatas, complectens: cum synonymis necessa∣riis, et usibus in cibo, medicina, et mechanicis.</HI>" Lond. folio, pp. 666; and the "<HI>Dendro∣logia,</HI>" pp. 135. App. pp. 137.</P>
<P>The distribution is the same as that of the two former volumes. In a compilation of this kind, collected from so numerous a set of authors, and in many instances from dried and imperfect specimens, there must
<PB N="266" REF="285"/>
necessarily arise a multitude of repeti∣tions. The author was sufficiently aware of this; but it was unavoidable. In this volume there are upwards of 11,700 plants enumerated.</P>
<P>The Appendix contains several catalogues, which must have been interesting to the curious at that time. Father CAMELL, a learned Jesuit of <HI>Manila,</HI> who had not only described, but delineated, a great number of the plants of <HI>Luzone,</HI> transmitted his work to Mr. RAY; and it forms an extensive part of this Appendix. It must have been much regretted, that the Rev. Father had not been furnished with books to have en∣abled him to adapt the synonyms; since there are few instances in which any other names occur, than the <HI>Spanish,</HI> and the in∣digenous appellations of the natives and <HI>Malays.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. RAY then gives a list of TOURNE∣FORT's oriental discoveries, from the "<HI>Co∣rollarium;</HI>" those of DAMPIER, from <HI>New Holland</HI> and elsewhere, and of MARTENS's <HI>Greenland</HI> Plants; of COMMELINE's Rare Exotics; a copious Catalogue of <HI>Chinese,</HI>
<PB N="267" REF="286"/>
<HI>Madrass,</HI> and <HI>African</HI> Plants, communicated by Mr. PETIVER, of which, those from <HI>Ma∣drass</HI> had been collected by Mr. BROWNE, a surgeon at that settlement; and lastly, a list of the new, or hitherto very imperfectly described species, contained in Mr. PETI∣VER's <HI>Hortus Siccus,</HI> amounting to upwards of 800.</P>
<P>An advertisement had been printed at the end of the first volume of Mr. RAY's "His∣tory," in 1688, inviting to a subscription for a set of figures to the work; and it was proposed, that those belonging to each tribe or class, should be published in regular suc∣cession; but it did not succeed. The scheme was again revived, while the Supplement was printing; and, among other of Mr. RAY's friends, Dr. COMPTON, bishop of <HI>London,</HI> had given his patronage, and strongly re∣commended it. Conferences were held with Dr. SHERARD, Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, Dr. RO∣BINSON, and Mr. PETIVER, relating to it; but it was relinquished as impracticable.</P>
<P>Mr. RAY's infirmities were very pressing upon him during the later years of his life.
<PB N="268" REF="287"/>
In a letter, written in the spring of 1702, he informs Mr. DERHAM that he had not been half a mile from his own house for four years. Yet, under these circumstances, he wrote his supplemental volume to his "History of Plants," which, he says, had engrossed almost his whole time for two years.</P>
<P>We have now brought Mr. RAY's bo∣tanical works to a conclusion; but his la∣bours did not cease here. His active and indefatigable mind prompted him, at the age of seventy-five, to begin a work on <HI>In∣sects;</HI> to which he had been encouraged by Dr. DERHAM; and for which he had been accumulating materials during many years. This was intended to comprehend only the <HI>English</HI> species; although, at the same time, his friends were wishing to engage him to describe the exotics of the <HI>London Musea,</HI> which were then beginning to abound in these subjects.</P>
<P>He had paid some attention to the his∣tory of <HI>Spiders,</HI> indeed, many years be∣fore, when intimately connected with Dr.
<PB N="269" REF="288"/>
LISTER; but the greater part of his work was drawn up from his own actual descriptions, and partly from Mr. WIL∣LUGHBY's papers, and the contributions of friends, Mr. PETIVER, Mr. DAN∣DRIDGE, Dr. SLOANE, Mr. MORTON, and Mr. STONEFLEET.</P>
<P>He tells us, that in the later years of his life he had discovered 300 kinds of <HI>Papilios,</HI> diurnal and nocturnal; and knew there were many more. The <HI>Beetles,</HI> he observes, were as numerous, and the <HI>Flies</HI> not less so. I mention these circumstances to prove the extensive knowledge of nature which this extraordinary man possessed, at an aera when he stood so nearly alone in these branches of science. He did not live to finish this work. It was published by Dr. DERHAM in 1710, in 4<SUP>o</SUP>. pp. 398.</P>
<P>I believe Mr. RAY was the first who gave to these minuter animals a real and scientific distribution. He had drawn up a short "METHODUS INSECTORUM," which was published the year after his death. Of the history itself, it is sufficient to say, that it bears all the characters of that accurate,
<PB N="270" REF="289"/>
discriminating, and systematic genius, which guided him in all his researches in the field of nature; and that it is every where quoted by the eminent <HI>Swede</HI> with the highest commendations, for the faithful descriptions it contains.</P>
<P>Mr. RAY's infirmities and afflictions, painful and grievous as they were, did not, we are told, prevent him from prosecuting his studies till within about three months before his death; which event took place on Jan. 17, 1704-5.</P>
<P>He died at <HI>Black Notley,</HI> and was buried, as Dr. DERHAM says, according to his own desire, in the church of that parish. The writers of the "General Dictionary," in the mean time, inform us, that, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"although the rector of the parish offered him a place of interment in the chancel of the church, yet he modestly refused it, choosing rather to be buried in the church-yard with his ancestors, where a monument was erected to him,"</Q> as Dr. DERHAM relates, at the charge of some of his friends, with a <HI>Latin</HI> inscription; which may be seen in the "Ge∣neral Dictionary," and in Mr. SCOTT's
<PB N="271" REF="290"/>
"Remains;" and of which I insert a copy below<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Inscription on Mr. RAY's Monument. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">

<PB N="275" REF="294"/>
more interesting manner than by historical detail.</P>
<P>As the general subject of these letters is natural history, so botany bears a prevail∣ing portion. Besides numberless critical observations that occur on particular spe∣cies, we meet with a long catalogue of the rare plants of the north of <HI>England,</HI> by Mr. LAWSON; Dr. PLUKENET's Observations on the first edition of the "<HI>Synopsis;</HI>" those of Dr. PRESTON on various <HI>British</HI> Plants; a paper of <HI>Thomas</HI> WILLISEL's specifying the different kinds of trees, on which, in his travels, he had seen the <HI>Mis∣seltoe</HI> growing; and a list of such exotics as were thought rare at that time in the <HI>Chel∣sea</HI> Garden, and at <HI>Fulham.</HI></P>
<P>There is, moreover, among these letters, an interesting paper, written by Mr. RAY himself, in answer to the question, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What number of plants there are in the world?"</Q> in which he discusses the difficulty, or im∣possibility, of gaining satisfaction on this point, arising from the want of sufficient bounds between species and variety. He communicated to the Royal Society some
<PB N="276" REF="295"/>
remarks on this head, which were printed by Dr. BIRCH, in the third volume of the "History of the Royal Society."</P>
<P>Dr. DERHAM meditated writing the life of Mr. RAY; but he appears not to have fully executed his plan. His papers, how∣ever, were published by Mr. SCOTT, in 1760, under the title of "Select Remains of the learned <HI>John</HI> RAY." 8<SUP>o</SUP>. pp. 336. To these are annexed three of the <HI>Itinera∣ries,</HI> which constitute the greater part of the book. They are evidently short notes only, never intended for the public eye. Some of Mr. RAY's devotional pieces ac∣company this collection; and three letters to Dr. DERHAM; with a <HI>Latin</HI> letter of advice and instructions to his pupils, the Mr. WILLUGHBYS.</P>
<P>There is said to be still extant a manu∣script of Mr. RAY's, under the title of "<HI>Catalogus Plantarum domesticarum quae aluntur Catabrigiae in hortis academicorum et oppidanorum.</HI>" In this, he chiefly makes use of the <HI>synonyma</HI> of the two BAUHINES, and of GERARD and PARKINSON.</P>
<P>Mr. RAY had the singular happiness of
<PB N="277" REF="296"/>
devoting fifty years of his life to the culti∣vation of the sciences he loved. Incited by the most ardent genius, which overcame in∣numerable difficulties and discouragements, his labours were, in the end, crowned with a success, before almost unequalled. He totally reformed the studies of botany and zoology; he raised them to the dignity of a science, and placed them in an advan∣tageous point of view; and, by his own investigations, added more real improve∣ment to them in <HI>England,</HI> than any of his predecessors.</P>
<P>He invented and defined many terms, ex∣pressive of ideas before unknown to the na∣turalists of <HI>England;</HI> and introduced many others, from writers of the best note. As he wrote <HI>Latin</HI> in great purity, and with great facility, he gave his subjects all the embellish∣ments that learning could bestow; and his extensive erudition, and knowledge of phi∣losophy at large, enabled him to add many collateral ornaments, and useful observa∣tions, with an aptitude and judgment that has been much applauded.</P>
<P>The extent of his improvements in sci∣ence procured him the admiration of his
<PB N="278" REF="297"/>
contemporaries, and have justly transmitted his name to posterity, among those who have done honour to their age and country. Even learned foreigners have been eloquent in his praise. <HI>French</HI> writers have stiled him the "<HI>English</HI> TOURNEFORT;" an eulogy that sufficiently evinced the high opinion they had of his merit. And the late eminent HALLER not only attributes to RAY the merit of improving and eleva∣ting botanical knowledge, but from his life dates a new aera in the records of the sci∣ence.</P>
<P>But Mr. RAY's enquiries were not limit∣ed to natural knowledge. His Foreign Tra∣vels and his Itineraries prove, that antiqui∣ties, polity, government, and legislation, at∣tracted a share of his regard; as his philo∣logical books are evidences of his attention to language, and of his desire to improve and illustrate his native tongue.</P>
<P>To all these endowments he joined an unremitting industry and perseverance in the prosecution of his studies; and, what marks a fortitude of mind as uncommon as it is enviable, his assiduity seemed to strengthen
<PB N="279" REF="298"/>
with his age, and to bid a defiance to the encroachments of infirmity, and the pros∣pect of dissolution. I call to witness the magnitude of the attempt, and successful issue of his exertions, in writing the supple∣mental volume to his "History of Plants," and in beginning the "<HI>Historia Insectorum</HI>" at so late a period of his life.</P>
<P>His singular modesty, affability, and com∣municative disposition, secured to him the esteem of all who knew him; and his emi∣nent talents as a naturalist and a philoso∣pher procured him many patrons and friends, and preserved him from that obscurity, which would otherwise probably have been his lot: for, notwithstanding his learning and probity, as his principles did not accord with those of the times, they were adverse to his fortune, and he gained no emoluments in the church. He had relinquished his fellowship at the commencement of the <HI>Bar∣tholomew</HI> act, not, as some imagined, from his having taken the <HI>Solemn League and Co∣venant</HI> (for that he never did, and often de∣clared, that he ever thought it an unlawful oath), but because he could not declare,
<PB N="280" REF="299"/>
agreeably to the terms of the act, that the oath was not binding on those who had taken it. Hence too, his constant refusal of preferment afterwards, occasioned him to be ranked, by many, among the nonconfor∣mists, although he lived and died in the communion of the church of <HI>England.</HI> He had seen, with deep regret, the disorders of the commonwealth and the usurpation, and afterwards, not less, the threatening aspect of the reign of <HI>James</HI> II.</P>
<P>His strong attachment to the principles of civil and religious liberty, is manifested by his animated stile, in the preface to his "<HI>Synopsis;</HI>" where he expresses, in glowing terms, his joy and gratitude, for having lived to see those blessings established by the Revolution.</P>
<P>The character of Mr. RAY cannot be contemplated by those who have a true re∣lish for the studies of nature, without a high sentiment of respect and gratitude; nor by those who consider the exemplari∣ness of his life as a man, and his qualifica∣tions as a divine, without veneration.</P>
<P>There are two engraved portraits of Mr.
<PB N="281" REF="300"/>
RAY prefixed to his works, both from a painting by <HI>Faithorne;</HI> one by <HI>W. Elder,</HI> before his "SYLLOGE," in 1693, which seems to have been copied for the "ME∣THODUS EMENDATA," in 1703; and the other by <HI>Vertue,</HI> in 1713, prefixed to the "Physico-theological Discourses." In both these, he is represented, as Mr. AMES de∣scribes it, in <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"an oval frame, with hair, whiskers, band, and canonical habit."</Q> These engravings represent Mr. RAY in the latter stage of his life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In dedicating plants to the worthies of botanical sci∣ence, the name of RAY challenged a dignified place; and the liberal-minded foreigner, whose name has before occurred on these occasions, forgot not so just a tribute. PLUMIER called a new plant of the <HI>dioecious</HI> class, which bears the habit of <HI>bryony,</HI> and is nearly allied to the <HI>yams,</HI> which he first discovered in the isle of <HI>Domingo,</HI> by the name of JAN-RAJA, in honour of our illustrious country∣man. LINNAEUS, who had comparatively few opportuni∣ties of correcting PLUMIER, established the <HI>genus,</HI> but more aptly changed it to RAJANIA, and enumerates three species. He could not adopt the still more analogous term of RAIA, since it had long been preoccupied in the animal kingdom; and it had been justly constituted an axiom, by the <HI>Fundamenta Botanica,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 230, not to form, in the vegetable kingdom, any generical terms, synonymous to such as were employed in zoology or mineralogy.</NOTE>.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Poetical botanists—<HI>Cowley</HI>—Account of his poems on plants—Not deeply versed in the botany of his time—Intimate knowledge of natural history necessary to accomplish <Q REND="inline">"the poet of nature."</Q></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>COWLEY.</HEAD>
<P>IN all times, from VIRGIL and AEMI∣LIUS MACER of the Augustan age, from the spurious MACER, and STRABUS the monk of <HI>St. Gall,</HI> in the twelfth cen∣tury, to modern times, the beauties of flowers, and the virtues of plants, have been celebrated in verse. <HI>Marcus</HI> NAEVIANUS, first a physician, and then a priest, of <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> sung the qualities of plants in his "<HI>Poemation</HI>" of 1563; and THUANUS, the great historian, amused himself with praising the <HI>violet</HI> and the <HI>lily</HI> in metre. In our own country, in 1723, <HI>George</HI> KNOWLES de∣scribed 400 plants of the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> in <HI>Latin</HI> verse, and didactically applied them to their uses in medicine.</P>
<P>But to proceed: That <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI>
<PB N="283" REF="302"/>
in the same age, might not want their bo∣tanical laureats, COWLEY in the one, and RAPIN in the other, arose to celebrate this theme.</P>
<P>COWLEY, after having found reasons for studying physic, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"considering botany," as we are told by his late eminent biographer, "as necessary to a physician, retired into <HI>Kent,</HI> to gather plants."</Q></P>
<P>Here, he wrote, before the Restoration, his "Two first Books on Plants;" although they were not published till the year 1662. The remaining four were added in the edi∣tion of 1668; and the whole were repub∣lished, with other poems, in 1678. 8<SUP>o</SUP>. pp. 343.</P>
<P>In the <HI>first</HI> book, he celebrates the powers of various medicinal herbs, more especially of those which gave ampler scope to his muse, from antient renown of their virtue, and were yet in frequent use, and high esteem. Such were betony, wormwood, wa∣ter lily, misseltoe, and various others.</P>
<P>In the <HI>second,</HI> he invokes the goddesses <HI>Luna, Lucina, Jana,</HI> and <HI>Mena;</HI> and sings the praises of simples appropriated to the
<PB N="284" REF="303"/>
diseases of the sex: in which, both antient superstition, and modern belief, supplied his muse with exuberant sources of grati∣fication.</P>
<P>In the <HI>third, Flora</HI> calls forth all his powers, in the narcissus, the anemone, the violet, and the tulip, with a variety of other ornaments of the parterre, from the <HI>coro∣nary</HI> tribe.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fourth,</HI> a more numerous set of the subordinate embellishments of the gar∣den are recorded, in various measure; among which, the attributes of the moly, the lily, poppy, sunflower, saffron, and amaranth, attract his muse with more than ordinary attention.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fifth,</HI> he celebrates, in heroic mea∣sure, the gifts of <HI>Pomona,</HI> from the native products of <HI>England,</HI> to the date of the east, and the <HI>tuna</HI> of the west; terminating his poem with near two hundred lines on <HI>Columbus,</HI> on the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> on the new continent, and in expressing his hopes that, to the devastations of conquest, will soon succeed peace, religion, arts, and science.</P>
<P>In the <HI>last,</HI> he displays the sylvan scene,
<PB N="285" REF="304"/>
from the oak of <HI>Boscobel,</HI> to the lowly juni∣per; and, having constituted his druidical monarch the sovereign of the forest, he makes him the oracle for a train of reflec∣tions, on the usurpation; the exile of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, his restoration; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> war.</P>
<P>His poems are accompanied by notes, illustrating the etymology, the names, syno∣nyms, descriptions, faculties, and uses of the plants, confirmed by authorities drawn from classical, botanical, and medical wri∣ters. Of these, he professes in his preface, that PLINY among the antients, and FER∣NELIUS among the moderns, have been his chief resources. Of botanical authors, GE∣RARD and PARKINSON are sparingly men∣tioned, and they are the principal of that class.</P>
<P>Great eminence in science is seldom at∣tainable, unless its foundation be laid in a devotedness of mind to its object, in the early scene of life. COWLEY did not enter on the study of physic, till the middle age of man; and then, as is probable, not with interested views towards practice. Hence
<PB N="286" REF="305"/>
it may fairly be presumed, that he satisfied himself with moderate acquisition. What was true of the whole, may by fair analogy be applicable to a particular branch of it. He had doubtless that portion of knowledge in the <HI>materia medica</HI> of plants, which may be considered as adequate to the usual de∣mand.</P>
<P>But, that COWLEY, in his retirement, should obtain an extensive and critical know∣ledge of botany, as it stood as a science, even in his day, could not be expected. His fervid genius could scarcely stoop to that patient investigation of nature, by which alone it could be acquired. Neither do the text, nor the notes, manifest sufficient proof of his intimate acquaintance with those au∣thors of true same, among the moderns, through whose assistance the want of that information might, in some measure, have been supplied.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, as, in the language of Dr. JOHNSON, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Botany, in the mind of COW∣LEY, turned into poetry,"</Q> to those who are alike enamoured with the charms of both, the poems of COWLEY must yield
<PB N="287" REF="306"/>
delight; since his fertile imagination has adorned his subject with all the beautiful allusions that antient poets and mythologists could supply; and even the fancies of the modern <HI>Signatores,</HI> of BAPTISTA PORTA, CROLLIUS, and their disciples, who saw the virtues of plants in the physiognomy, or agreement in colour or external forms, with the parts of the human body, assisted to embellish his verse. Nor did he fail, by these elegant productions, to honour his subject, his name, and his country.</P>
<P>I close these observations by remarking, that poetry, as it ever hath, so it ever must derive from nature some of its most pleasing scenes of entertainment. In the vegetable world, the most expanded imagination of poetic genius will, even without the aid of fiction, so emphatically stiled the soul of poetry, find a field sufficiently ample for the display of the brightest talents. THOM∣SON witnesses this truth, while in him we lament the want of that botanical know∣ledge, without which, the poet must ever be deprived of numberless sources of the
<PB N="288" REF="307"/>
most beautiful imagery, and such as would add peculiar grace, and the most instructive power to his muse.</P>
<P>And, although the talent of the poet hath not often been united to that of the really scientific botanist, there are not want∣ing instances of this union. I might men∣tion, since the discovery of the sexes of plants, the ode, dedicated to CAMERARIUS, and printed in his "<HI>Epistola de Sexu Plan∣tarum;</HI>" of which, a translation by Dr. MARTYN, when a young man, may be seen in BLAIR's "Botanick Essays." Professor <HI>Van</HI> ROYEN, in 1732, published an elegant poem "<HI>De Plantarum Amoribus, et Connu∣biis.</HI>" And CUNO, an ingenious merchant of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> in a volume of 256 pages, described, in 1750, the plants of his own garden in verse; for which he received the laurel from LINNAEUS, by a new genus in∣scribed to his name.</P>
<P>Whilst I am now writing, I have the pleasure of congratulating all those, whose love of poetry is aided by a taste for botani∣cal science, on a most elegant production in
<PB N="289" REF="308"/>
our own country. The beautiful display of the principles of the <HI>Linnaean</HI> system in the "Botanic Garden," under the delicate analogy of the "Loves of the Plants," in which the didactic design of the author, is so happily embellished by <HI>Ovidian</HI> imagery, as to have given that energy and ornament to the subject, which has been hitherto wanting to all similar productions in the <HI>English</HI> language.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Merret,</HI> brief anecdotes of—His <HI>Pinax Rerum Naturalium,</HI> intended to supply the deficiencies of <HI>How</HI>'s <HI>Phytologia</HI>—Assisted by <HI>Willisel: Goodyer's</HI> manuscripts—<HI>Merret</HI>'s other wri∣tings—His papers in the <HI>Philosophical Trans∣actions.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>MERRET.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>CHRISTOPHER,</HI> the son of <HI>Chris∣topher</HI> MERRET, was born at <HI>Winchcombe,</HI> in <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> Feb. 16, 1614. He became a student in <HI>Glou∣cester</HI> Hall, in the beginning of the year 1631; two years after which time, he translated himself to <HI>Oriel</HI> College, and took the degree of B.A. in 1634. Af∣terwards, retiring again to <HI>Gloucester</HI> Hall, he applied to the study of physic, and was created doctor in that faculty in 1642. About this time he settled in <HI>London,</HI> and came into considerable prac∣tice, was a fellow of the College of Physicians, and of the Royal Society.
<PB N="291" REF="310"/>
He died at his house, near the chapel in <HI>Hatton Garden,</HI> in <HI>Holborne,</HI> near <HI>London,</HI> Aug. 19, 1695; and was buried twelve feet deep in the church of <HI>St. Andrew's, Holborne.</HI>"</Q> Thus far Mr. <HI>Wood.</HI></P>
<P>The publication which entitles Dr. <HI>Mer∣ret</HI> to a place in these anecdotes, is, his "PINAX RERUM NATURALIUM BRI∣TANNICARUM, <HI>continens</HI> VEGETABILIA, <HI>Animalia, et Fossilia, in hac Insula reperta.</HI>" 8<SUP>o</SUP>. 1667. pp. 223.</P>
<P>This is not noticed in the title as a se∣cond edition, although there is one recorded by authors, with the date of 1665. How∣ever, I suspect it to be a mistake, as no such edition is quoted by RAY. He dates his book from the College of Physicians, and is mentioned by MORISON under the title of "<HI>Musei Herbiani Custos.</HI>"</P>
<P>Dr. MERRET informs us, that he under∣took this work at the request of a book∣seller, to supply the deficiencies of How's "<HI>Phytologia,</HI>" after that work was out of print; and that it was intended to have been done jointly with Dr. DALE, whose death, soon after the design was formed,
<PB N="292" REF="311"/>
threw the whole into his own hands. He says, he had purchased 800 figures, which JOHNSON had caused to be engraved, with which the work was to have been embel∣lished. Why they did not appear, no cause is assigned; nor do I find any further no∣tices of them. Dr. MERRET, though un∣questionably a man of learning, taste, and considerable information in natural history, seems to have engaged in it too late in life, to admit of his making that proficiency, which the design required. Add to this, that being fixed in <HI>London,</HI> and closely en∣gaged in the practice of his profession, he was rendered incapable of investigating plants, in the distant parts of the kingdom. He however engaged <HI>Thomas</HI> WILLISEL to travel for him; and he tells us, that WIL∣LISEL was employed by him for five suc∣cessive summers. His son, <HI>Christopher</HI> MER∣RET, also made excursions for the same purpose; and Mr. <HI>Yauldon</HI> GOODYER fur∣nished him with the manuscripts of his grandfather. By these assistances Dr. MER∣RET procured a large number of <HI>English</HI> plants, and a knowledge of the <HI>Loci Natales.</HI>
<PB N="293" REF="312"/>
Nevertheless, he was not possessed of that critical and intimate acquaintance with the subject, which might have enabled him to distinguish, with sufficient accuracy, the species from varieties. He ranges the plants alphabetically, according to the <HI>Latin</HI> names, and has given few synonyms, except those of GERARD and PARKINSON; to which, after the example of the writers of the "<HI>Hortus Oxoniensis,</HI>" he has very commen∣dably annexed the page. He gives the ge∣neral places of growth, and specifies the particular spots, where the rare plants are found.</P>
<P>At the end of the Catalogue, is subjoined, a rude disposition of vegetables into classes, somewhat like that of <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE. This he hoped to have improved, against the time of a second edition, which, pro∣bably, Mr. RAY's publications superseded. Then follows a brief <HI>Synopsis Etymologica,</HI> and a useful list of the plants as they flower in each month, pointing out the duration of the time. Dr. MERRET has, in this <HI>Pi∣nax,</HI> introduced many plants as new, which, on subsequent examination, proved to be
<PB N="294" REF="313"/>
only varieties; a number of exotics, evidently the accidental offspring of gardens, and many that could never be met with by succeeding botanists, in the places specified by him. He enumerates upwards of 1400 species of <HI>English</HI> plants; whilst the accu∣rate Mr. RAY, only three years afterwards, confines the number to 1050. Neverthe∣less, several <HI>British</HI> plants make their first appearance in this <HI>Pinax;</HI> and Dr. MER∣RET would probably have secured his title to some others, if he had not totally omitted to give descriptions of those which he in∣troduces as new.</P>
<P>The zoological part of this <HI>Pinax</HI> is ex∣extremely superficial; consisting merely of the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>English</HI> name, with a refer∣ence to ALDROVANDUS, GESNER, JOHN∣STON, and MOUFFETT. The mineralogy is not less brief, and imperfect.</P>
<P>Before the publication of this work, Dr. MERRET had printed "A Collection of Acts of Parliament, Charters, Trials at Law, and Judges Opinions, concerning those Grants to the College of Physi∣cians." 4<SUP>o</SUP>. 1660. This became the ba∣sis,
<PB N="295" REF="314"/>
as Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> says, of Dr. GOODALL's book, printed in 1684.</P>
<P>In 1669, he wrote "A short View of the Frauds and Abuses committed by Apothecaries, in relation to Patients, and Physicians." 4<SUP>o</SUP>. This treatise engaged him in a controversy with the famous <HI>Henry</HI> STUBBE. It may be presumed, that all discussions of this kind, howsoever well meant, can have but little effect in reform∣ing the abuses hinted at, while the custo∣mary and legal constitution, and polity of physic, remain in the present state in <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>In 1662, he translated into <HI>English,</HI> "The Art of Glass; how to colour Glass, Ena∣mels, Lakes, &amp;c." 8<SUP>o</SUP>. written by <HI>Ant.</HI> NE∣RI, accompanied with an account of the Glass Dross. And, in 1686, the same work was published in <HI>Latin,</HI> with Dr. MERRET's "Observations and Notes," equal in extent to the work itself. <HI>Amst.</HI> 12<SUP>o</SUP>.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> informs us, that he also print∣ed, in one sheet, 4<SUP>o</SUP>. "The Character of a compleat Physician or Naturalist."</P>
<P>Dr. MERRET was among the earliest
<PB N="296" REF="315"/>
members of the Royal Society, after its in∣corporation; and contributed several papers, which were printed in the "<HI>Philosophical Transactions.</HI>"</P>
<P>He made experiments on vegetation, in the year 1664; by which he found, that square sections of the bark, from ash, and maple, whether separated on three sides only, or wholly, would firmly unite, if tightly secured by plaister and packthread.</P>
<P>Experiments on the loss of weight, which a plant of the <HI>Aloe Americana,</HI> with eleven leaves, suffered by hanging up in the kitchen for five years. In the first year it lost near two ounces and an half; the second upwards of three ounces; de∣creasing afterwards nearly in the same pro∣portion. It lost two of the larger leaves every year, and put forth two new ones every spring; from which circumstance, the Doctor inferred a circulation of the juice.</P>
<P>Experiments on cherry-trees, that, hav∣ing withered fruit, occasioned by the sun being admitted too suddenly upon them in March, recovered, by daily watering the roots.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="316"/>
Observations on the <HI>London</HI> granaries. These four papers were all printed in N<SUP>o</SUP> 25, in the second volume of the "<HI>Trans∣actions.</HI>"</P>
<P>In N<SUP>o</SUP> 138, an account of the tin-mines in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> mundic, spar, and <HI>Cornish</HI> crys∣tals.</P>
<P>In N<SUP>o</SUP> 142, an account of the art of re∣fining, in the several methods, by parting, by the test, the almond furnace, and by mercury.</P>
<P>In N<SUP>o</SUP> 223, some curious observations on the fens of <HI>Lincolnshire;</HI> on the animal and vegetable produce: a description of <HI>Boston</HI> church, the incroachments of the sea, and other particulars, which must have rendered this paper a very interesting morsel of natu∣ral history. He gives a list of several of the more rare plants growing in the fens.</P>
<P>In N<SUP>o</SUP> 224, a table of the washes called <HI>Fosdyke</HI> and <HI>Crosskeys,</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> speci∣fying the times of high water, and safe pas∣sage over the sands.</P>

<P><HI>ROBERT</HI> MORISON was born at <HI>Aber∣deen,</HI> in 1620; was educated in the same university; and, in 1638, took the de∣gree of doctor in philosophy, equivalent to that of M.A. He first applied to mathe∣matics, and was designed by his parents for the theological line; but his taste for bo∣tany and physic superseded their intentions. His attachment to the royal cause, led him into the army; and he received a dangerous wound in the head, in the battle at <HI>Brigg,</HI>
<PB N="299" REF="318"/>
near <HI>Aberdeen.</HI> Upon his recovery, he went to <HI>Paris,</HI> the asylum of his countrymen. Here he was first employed as a tutor to the son of a counsellor, <HI>Bizet;</HI> and, in the mean time, assiduously applied to the study of anatomy, botany, and zoology. In 1648, he took the doctor's degree in physic at <HI>Angers.</HI> He became so much distinguished by his skill in botany, that at the recom∣mendation of M. ROBINS, the king's bota∣nist, he was taken into the patronage of the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> uncle to <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. and appointed intendant of his fine garden at <HI>Blois,</HI> with a handsome salary. This estab∣lishment took place in 1650, and he held it until the death of the Duke, in 1660. Here, we are told, MORISON laid open to the Duke his method of botany; and was liberally encouraged by him to prosecute it. The Duke also sent him into various pro∣vinces of <HI>France,</HI> to search for new plants. He travelled into <HI>Burgundy,</HI> the <HI>Lyonnois,</HI> and <HI>Languedoc;</HI> and into <HI>Britanny,</HI> the coasts and isles of which he carefully investigated; and, by these journies, enriched the garden with many rare, and some new plants.</P>

It was in this situation that he became known to <HI>Charles</HI> II. who, in 1660, on the death of his uncle the Duke, invited MO∣RISON into <HI>England;</HI> and, although solicited by the treasurer <HI>Fouquet,</HI> on the most ho∣nourable and ample conditions, to remain in <HI>France,</HI> the love of his country overcame all temptations, and he returned to <HI>Eng∣land. Charles</HI> II. gave him the title of king's physician, and royal professor of bo∣tany, with an appointment of 200 l. a year, and a house, as superintendant of the royal gardens. He was elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, and acquired much fame for his knowledge of botany. In this situation he remained till the year 1669, when, having made an acquaintance with Mr. <HI>Obadiah</HI> WALKER, of University College, with the Dean of Christ Church, and other leading men of the university, he was, by their interest, elected botanic professor at Oxford, Dec. 16, 1669, and incorporated doctor of physic the day fol∣lowing. He read his first lecture in the physic school in September 1670, and then removed to the physic garden, where he
<PB N="301" REF="320"/>
lectured three times a week, to a consider∣able audience. In this occupation, and in conducting his great work, the "<HI>Historia Plantarum Oxoniensis,</HI>" he laboured to the time of his death, which was thought to have been occasioned by a bruise, received by the pole of a coach, in crossing the street, Nov. 9, 1683. He died at his house in <HI>Green-street, Leicester Fields,</HI> the next day, and was buried in the church of <HI>St. Mar∣tin's in the Fields, Westminster.</HI></P>
<P>SEGUIER seems to have placed impro∣perly among MORISON's works the first edition of the "<HI>Hortus Blesensis,</HI>" which he gives as published in the year 1635, when MORISON must have been only fifteen years of age. This may have been a typographi∣cal error; but the book, in fact, was the work of <HI>Abel</HI> BRUYNER, physician to the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and was not published till 1653. MORISON's first publication was a second edition of this catalogue, under the following title: "HORTUS REGIUS BLE∣SENSIS <HI>auctus: accessit Index Plantarum in Horto contentarum nemini Scriptarum et</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="321"/>
<HI>Observationes generaliores, seu Praeludiorum pars prior.</HI>" Lond. 1669. 12<SUP>o</SUP>.</P>
<P>The "HORTUS BLESENSIS" raised the author's character, and contributed, as the writer of his life observes, to recommend him to the station he afterwards held at <HI>Oxford.</HI> It contains the rudiments of his method of classification. He professes to give a list of 260 new plants; but many of them proved to be only varieties, and others, such as were well known before. There were, nevertheless, some new and rare plants, of exotic, as well as indigenous origin; the latter, such as he had himself first disco∣vered in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>In this work is also given his "HALLU∣CINATIONES <HI>in</HI> CASPARI BAUHINI <HI>Pina∣cem, tam in digerendis quam denominandis Plantis; et his Animadversiones, in tres To∣mos, Historiae Plantarum</HI> JOHANNIS BAU∣HINI;" a work which <HI>Haller</HI> calls "<HI>Invi∣diosum Opus;</HI>" and which, while it proves both the accuracy and diligence of the au∣thor, must be confessed to be unbecomingly severe on these two illustrious writers; who,
<PB N="303" REF="322"/>
as they did not profess to write a system, are here too rigidly tried by rules, not in∣vented when they wrote, and of conse∣quence the validity of which they could not have acknowledged.</P>
<P>In a dialogue at the end of the "<HI>Hortus Blesensis,</HI>" MORISON teaches, that the ge∣nera of plants should be established on cha∣racters drawn from the fruit, and not on any sensible qualities, or supposed medicinal virtue. He also learnedly defends the doc∣trine, that all vegetables arise from seed; a proposition not universally allowed; the doctrine of equivocal, or spontaneous gene∣ration, having, at that time, many advo∣cates among the learned.</P>
<P>Dr. MORISON, during his residence in <HI>France,</HI> in his occasional journies to <HI>Paris,</HI> about the year 1658, became familiar in the family of Lord HATTON, then resident at <HI>St. Germains,</HI> and whose second son <HI>Charles</HI> was much attached to natural history, and became a voluntary and zealous disciple of our author. Sixteen years afterwards, Mr. <HI>Charles</HI> HATTON sent over, at the author's request, a treatise, with the plates already en∣graved,
<PB N="304" REF="323"/>
written by <HI>Paul</HI> BOCCONE, on plants, discovered by him in the southern parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> principally in <HI>Sicily,</HI> of which some were rare, and some new. BOCCONE was ori∣ginally of <HI>Savona,</HI> in the <HI>Genoese</HI> district; and was born in 1633. He became a <HI>Cistertian</HI> monk of <HI>Palermo,</HI> and was a man of singu∣lar and various erudition in natural history. He visited <HI>Corsica</HI> and <HI>Malta;</HI> travelled into <HI>England, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Germany;</HI> and was for some time botanist to the Duke of <HI>Tus∣cany.</HI> He was the author of several very curious works; and died in 1704. He wrote on fossils; but his botanical writings have greater originality, and were of high value. MORISON, after having caused the seven last plates to be re-engraved, pub∣lished the work alluded to above, under the following title:</P>
<P>"ICONES <HI>et</HI> DESCRIPTIONES RARIO∣RUM PLANTARUM <HI>Melitae, Galliae, et Ita∣liae. Auctore Paulo</HI> BOCCONE, <HI>panormitano siculo, serenissimi magni Etruriae Ducis olim Botanico.</HI>" Oxon. 1674. 4<SUP>o</SUP>. pp. 96. t. 52. fig. 119.</P>
<P>MORISON prefixed to this work a dedi∣cation
<PB N="305" REF="324"/>
to Mr. HATTON, in which he de∣fends, not only the doctrine in general, that all plants spring from seed, but particularly, against DIOSCORIDES, and some of the re∣storers of science, among whom were CAE∣SALPINUS, that all the ferns are furnished with flowers and seed.</P>
<P>The plants described and figured in this book, are, most of them, such as had not been noticed by foregoing authors. A few of these are common to <HI>Britain.</HI> The figures are small, and neither well deline∣ated, nor well engraven: but the work had its use, as containing some plants of Sou∣thern <HI>Europe,</HI> not to be met with in any other author; and on this account derives some value, to those who are curious in pursuing the history of plants in the sexual system, as being quoted by LINNAEUS.</P>
<P>As a specimen of his great work, medi∣tated under the name of "<HI>Historia Planta∣rum Universalis Oxoniensis,</HI>" MORISON next published, "PLANTARUM UMBELLIFE∣RARUM DISTRIBUTIO NOVA, <HI>per tabulas cognationis et affinitatis, ex libro Naturae observata et detecta.</HI>" Oxon. 1672. fol.
<PB N="306" REF="325"/>
pp. 91. t. 12. The umbelliferous tribe is here divided into nine orders, the genera of which are distinguished by the figure of the seed, assisted, in some of the subdivisions, by the form of the leaf. They are illustra∣ted by figures of 150 different seeds.</P>
<P>The author has subjoined what he names <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Umbelliferous Plants, improperly so cal∣led."</Q> Such are <HI>Valeriana, Thalictrum, Filipendula, Valeriana graeca, Pimpinella San∣guisorba;</HI> all which are very different, both in character and habit, except the <HI>Valerian,</HI> from the natural class of which he treats.</P>
<P>This specimen excited the attention of the learned, augmented MORISON's patro∣nage, both abroad and at home; and en∣couraged him to prosecute with vigour his great work, of which the first volume came out under the following title: "PLANTA∣RUM HISTORIAE UNIVERSALIS OXONI∣ENSIS, <HI>Pars secunda; seu Herbarum Distri∣butio nova, per tabulas cognationis et affinita∣tis, ex libro Naturae observata et detecta.</HI>" Fol. 1680. pp. 617. The first part of the History, on Trees and Shrubs, was never printed. Some have doubted, whether it
<PB N="307" REF="326"/>
was ever written; but SCHELHAMMER<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In additamentis ad CONRINGIUM.</NOTE> tells us, that he saw the whole work perfect in the hands of the author. MORISON him∣self assigns, as a reason for publishing the Herbaceous Division first, the greater mag∣nitude of the undertaking, arising from the vast number, and consequent difficulty of finding proper distinctions and characters; and because he was unwilling to leave the most difficult and abstruse part of his work behind him unfinished, as happened to DE∣LECHAMP, and <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE. Unhap∣pily, however, MORISON's untimely death subjected his work to the same lot, and did not allow him to finish more than nine, out of the fifteen classes of his own system.</P>
<P>He divides all herbaceous plants into fif∣teen classes, under the following titles:<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Scandentes.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Leguminosae.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Siliquosae.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>Tricapsulares Hexa∣petalae.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>Tricapsulares, aliae.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. <HI>Corymbiferae.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. <HI>Papposae Lactescen∣tes.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>8. <HI>Culmiferae.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>9. <HI>Umbelliferae.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>10. <HI>Tricoccae Purgatri∣ces.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="308" REF="327"/>
11. <HI>Galeatae, et Verti∣cillatae.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>12. <HI>Multisiliquae, et Multicapsulares.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>13. <HI>Bacciferae.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>14. <HI>Capillares.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>15. <HI>Anomalae.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>From an inspection of this table, it ap∣pears, that his method is not uniformly founded on the fruit; in fact, much less so than that of CAESALPINUS; but on the fruit and the habit conjointly; since the <HI>Corymbiferae, Umbelliferae,</HI> and <HI>Galeatae,</HI> with the <HI>Verticillatae,</HI> arise from the disposition of the flower; the <HI>Scandentes, Culmiferae,</HI> and <HI>Capillares,</HI> from the habit: the seventh class from the qualities partly, and partly from the seed. Hence we see, that only half the classes are founded on the fruit; the fifteenth being truly an heteroclite assemblage. His method would have ap∣proached much nearer to perfection, on his own principles, had he enlarged the num∣ber of his classes; since, in several instances, they embrace natural orders, much too dis∣tinct to be ranged together. The orders, or subdivisions of the classes, are, in some instances, grounded on differences in the
<PB N="309" REF="328"/>
seed-vessel; in others, on the root, habit, and frequently on less scientific discrimina∣tions. In the conduct of the work itself, MORISON makes a separate chapter for each genus. He begins by referring to the antients under each plant; frequently sub∣joining the etymology. The generical cha∣racters, if indeed they can be so called, are very vague; and though taken from the parts of fructification, are, too often, assisted by distinctions from the root, leaves, and mode of growth. After the generical note, follows a synoptical table of the species, re∣ferring to the plates. The descriptions are sometimes borrowed from <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE and others. To most of the plants, he af∣fixes new specific characters, and subjoins the <HI>synonyma</HI> of several authors. He intro∣duces, at the end of the chapters, the ani∣madversions on the BAUHINES, and an ac∣count of the virtues and uses of the plants.</P>
<P>The five first classes only, were published by the author, who left the four succeeding ones finished. These, with the remaining classes, were finished and published, after an interval of nineteen years, by <HI>Jacob</HI> BO∣BART.
<PB N="310" REF="329"/>
MORISON had the advantage of powerful patronage. He was liberally en∣couraged by the university, and enabled to embellish his work with a numerous set of tables, on which are engraven about 3384 plants. The figures are chiefly co∣pied from other authors. The new figures occur principally in the latter part of this work, and are therefore to be attributed to the care of BOBART. The six tables of <HI>Mosses, Fuci, Corallines,</HI> and <HI>Corals,</HI> at the end, are, except the few wooden cuts of GE∣RARD, the first of the kind graved in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and have great merit as the produc∣tions of that time. All those of COLUMNA and CORNUTUS are copied in this work. Those engraved by <HI>Burghers</HI> excel the rest; and the figures of the grasses and mosses are incomparably beyond any other that are to be met with, on the same scale; the habit being admirably well expressed. The re∣publication of these tables, with references to LINNAEUS's writings, would, even at this period, be a benefit to the science.</P>
<P>The third part, or, more properly, the second volume of the "Oxford History of
<PB N="311" REF="330"/>
Plants," was published by <HI>Jacob</HI> BO∣BART, in fol. 1699. pp. 655. A life of MORISON is prefixed to this volume, and an engraving of him done by <HI>White,</HI> with Dr. PITCAIRN's Tetrastic underneath. In the preface, which is signed <HI>Jacob</HI> BO∣BART, the reader is presented with a gene∣ral view of the writers on botany, from THEOPHRASTUS, to the time of MORI∣SON; enumerating throughout the several nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> in a chronological order, the most learned authors on the subject. The writer then informs us of the patronage and encouragement which MORISON received from the university, to undertake this work; and, after lamenting the untimely death of the author, and expressing his grateful sense of the honour he received in being ap∣pointed to continue the undertaking, he lays before the reader the assistances he received in the prosecution of it. An interval of near twenty years had given BOBART an opportunity of inserting a great number of plants unknown to MORISON, from the works of RAY, HERMAN, PLUKENET, the "<HI>Hortus Malabaricus,</HI>" and other works.
<PB N="312" REF="331"/>
With respect to <HI>English</HI> botany, great com∣munications had been made by SLOANE, PETIVER, DOODY, SHERARD, and others. By these means, this volume contains near∣ly double the number of the former; but the latter part of it proves, too evidently, that it did not receive the finishing hand of the original author; since it appears in a very abridged form, compared with what MORISON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name of MORISON is perpetuated by PLUMIER, in the application of it to a West Indian tree of the <HI>mona∣delphous</HI> class, hitherto described only by himself and JAC∣QUIN.</NOTE> himself had done.</P>

<P><HI>Jacob</HI> BOBART, the continuator of MO∣RISON's History, was the son of <HI>Jacob,</HI> the first superintendant of the Garden, upon its foundation in 1632. Both the father and son filled their station with great credit to themselves, and no less emolument to the Garden. The elder is said to have been the author of the first edition of the "<HI>Hortus Oxoniensis,</HI>" 1648; and his name is joined in the second edition, 1658, as an associate in the work, with Dr. STEPHENS and Mr.

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>METHOD.</HEAD>
<P>AGREEABLY to my purpose, I now proceed to give a concise ac∣count of the rise and progress of what is understood by <HI>method, system,</HI> or <HI>classification</HI> of plants, arising from agreement in the parts of fructification, independent of any association from the <HI>sacies externa,</HI> or habit of the plant. To this, I shall add as brief an history of another important discovery, that of the <HI>sexes of plants;</HI> in consequence of which, system itself has been carried to a much higher degree of perfection.</P>
<P>There are no traces of what the moderns
<PB N="315" REF="334"/>
call <HI>system,</HI> in the writings of the antients; by whom are pre-eminently signified, THEO∣PHRASTUS, DIOSCORIDES, and PLINY. Their knowledge of vegetables was con∣fined to a few that were used in medicine, and in the arts and conveniences of life; and in treating on them, their subjects are placed in great and inordinate divisions, without the smallest approach to what is now meant by <HI>classisication.</HI></P>
<P>THEOPHRASTUS treats his subject, in general, philosophically. In his book "<HI>De Causis Plantarum,</HI>" he considers the propa∣gation, culture, qualities, and uses of Plants in general; but describes very few. In his "<HI>Historia Plantarum,</HI>" in which are de∣scribed, or enumerated, about 500 species, he begins with the organization, the gene∣ration, and propagation of Vegetables. He then treats largely, in his <HI>third</HI> and <HI>fourth</HI> books, on Trees. In the <HI>fifth,</HI> on Timber, and the choice of the best. In the <HI>sixth,</HI> on Shrubs, thorny Plants, Roses, and other ornaments of gardens. In the <HI>seventh,</HI> on oleraceous Plants, and wild Plants. In the <HI>eighth,</HI> copiously on Grain of all kinds.
<PB N="316" REF="335"/>
And in the <HI>last,</HI> on Gums, Exudations, and the methods of obtaining them.</P>
<P>The object of DIOSCORIDES being solely the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> he discusses each sub∣ject specifically, and in a separate chapter, dividing the whole into five books; in which, as far as any order takes place, they arrange into aromatic, alimentary, and medicinal plants. His descriptions are taken chiefly from colour, size, mode of growing, com∣parison of the leaves and roots, with other plants well known, and therefore left unde∣scribed. In general they are short, and fre∣quently insufficient to determine the species. Hence arose the endless, and irreconcileable contentions, among the commentators. In this manner he has described near 700 plants; to which he subjoins the virtues and uses. To DIOSCORIDES all posterity have appealed as decisive on the subject.</P>
<P>PLINY, who treats of plants from the twelfth to the twenty-seventh book, inclu∣sive, of his "History," has drawn his re∣sources principally from Grecian authors. He is the historian of antient botany, and recites the names of several hundreds, not
<PB N="317" REF="336"/>
mentioned by foregoing writers; but many of these are unknown. There is no scien∣tific order in the disposition of his sub∣ject; and the great value of PLINY's work consists in having preserved to us the re∣mains of antient knowledge on the subject; and in particular, the application of it to the arts of life, in those remote times.</P>
<P>After the revival of learning in the fif∣teenth century, the first cultivators of bo∣tany studied plants more in the writings of these fathers, than in the book of nature; and were solely anxious about extricating the plants of the <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> scarcely adverting to those striking discriminations in the general port, mein, or habit, the mode of growing, and other obvious rela∣tions, which mark the great natural fami∣lies in the vegetable kingdom: but were con∣tent to arrange them, some, according to the alphabetical nomenclature, others, from the structure of the root, the time of flowering, the places of growth, the supposed qualities, and uses in medicine; or from other as un∣stable distinctions. With them, as with the antients, there were nearly as many <HI>ge∣nera</HI>
<PB N="318" REF="337"/>
as <HI>species;</HI> and if they gave the same common appellation to two, or more plants, they were led to it by some rude, external resemblance; such as, size, form of the root, agreement in the colour of the flower; and, in the description of the species, were fre∣quently satisfied with comparing it to an∣other plant well known to themselves, and therefore left undescribed in their writings.</P>
<P>This mode of arrangement, though in a somewhat improved state, is exemplified above, in the order observed by DODONAEUS; and is seen in our old <HI>English</HI> herbalists, GERARD and PARKINSON.</P>
<P>LOBEL, in his <HI>Adversaria,</HI> 1570, seems to have been the first, who attempted to dis∣tribute plants into large families, or classes, from the general consent of habit, or exter∣nal form, and mode of growing. This he has done in an imperfect synoptical way; and several of his families contain natural orders, or classes, nearly entire; but fre∣quently interrupted by great anomalies. His arrangement was not sufficiently attended to at the time: it was then excellent, and was gradually improved, until we see it in
<PB N="319" REF="338"/>
its last, and best form, as exhibited by <HI>Caspar</HI> BAUHINE, in his <HI>Pinax,</HI> 1623; and especially by <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE, in his <HI>Histo∣ria Plantarum Universalis,</HI> 1650.</P>
<P>As natural characters arose from simila∣rity in the general port, or habit of the plant, and from an obvious agreement in the disposition of the stalk, leaves, stems, and from that of the flower, fruit, and seed; so, they at length forced themselves to ob∣servation. Thus, the general habit of all <HI>grasses;</HI> the plants with a <HI>papilionaceous</HI> flower, such as pease and vetches; the <HI>sili∣quose</HI> plants, such as mustard, cresses, tur∣neps, &amp;c.; the <HI>verticillated,</HI> as mint, baum, hyssop, germander, &amp;c.; the <HI>umbellated</HI> tribe, parsley, carrots, hemlock, angelica; the <HI>cone-bearing trees;</HI> and several other tribes, were too striking, not to be seen even by a superficial observer. But, as these constitute only a part of the whole, so no characters were formed for those plants, which the eye could not immediately refer to some of these classes. Still less had any generical agreement, arising from uniformity in the fructification, been detected. Had all the species of plants arranged themselves under
<PB N="320" REF="339"/>
natural classes, a natural method would easily have followed; but the intermediate links, notwithstanding the efforts of the most skilful, are yet unknown. Hence arose the necessity of artificial systems, which are now become but too numerous. Some have imagined, that the more pure any artificial system preserves the natural classes, the greater is its excellence; but experience does not confirm this idea. Those arrange∣ments are found to lead more immediately to the plant sought for, the classes and subdivisions of which are simple, and drawn each uniformly from the same parts of the fructification.</P>
<P><HI>Conrad</HI> GESNER, the LINNAEUS of the age in which he lived, is universally agreed to have been the first who suggested this true principle of classical distinction, and generical character, as is manifest from va∣rious passages in the <HI>Epistles</HI> of that great man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epist. Medicinal. à <HI>Wolphio</HI> ed. p. 113, et passim.</NOTE>. He instances the agreement of the <HI>Staphisagria,</HI> with the <HI>Consolida;</HI> the <HI>Scor∣zonera,</HI> with the <HI>Tragopogon;</HI> the <HI>Molucca,</HI> with the <HI>Lamium;</HI> the <HI>Dulcamara,</HI> with
<PB N="321" REF="340"/>
the <HI>Solanum;</HI> the <HI>Calceolus,</HI> with the <HI>Orchi∣des:</HI> and he expressly says, that the charac∣ter should be formed from the flower, and the seed, rather than from the leaves. This was in the year 1565. Other passages occur, by which it appears, he had the same ideas so early as 1559. But, perhaps, there is no proof of the importance he gave to these parts, more indubitable, than his having been the first who delineated them sepa∣rately, with the figures of his plants; of which numerous instances may be seen in the tables published by SCHMIEDEL.</P>
<P>But GESNER did not live to improve the hints he thus drew from nature; and, what is wonderful, they were neglected by those great luminaries of the science, CLUSIUS, and the BAUHINES. It was reserved for CAESALPINUS, a man in whom was united an exquisite knowledge of plants, with a truly philosophical genius. He had been the disciple of GHINUS, and was afterwards physician to Pope <HI>Clement</HI> VIII. He de∣scribed, with exquisite skill, the plants of his own country, and left an <HI>Herbarium</HI> of
<PB N="322" REF="341"/>
768 species. He extended GESNER's idea, and commenced the period of systematic arrangement. In his "<HI>Libri xvi de Plan∣tis,</HI>" published 1583, he has arranged up∣wards of 800 plants into <HI>classes,</HI> founded, after the general division of the trees from herbs, on characters drawn from the fruit particularly, from the number of the cap∣sules and cells; the number, shape, and dis∣position of the seeds; and from the situation of the <HI>corculum, radicle,</HI> or eye of the seed, which he raised to great estimation. The <HI>orders,</HI> or subdivisions, are formed on still more various relations.</P>
<P><HI>Fabius</HI> COLUMNA improved this doctrine of <HI>classification,</HI> in 1616, by extending it to the formation of <HI>genera,</HI> which CAESALPI∣NUS had not effected; all his species being separately described. COLUMNA, indeed, did not exhibit a system; but he shewed the way to complete it, by the union of species under one common name, from similarity in the flower, and fruit; and he invented several of the terms, now in use, to deno∣minate those parts. This noble invention,
<PB N="323" REF="342"/>
nevertheless, lay dormant for near a cen∣tury; and the glory of reviving, and im∣proving it, was reserved for <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>RAY, and MORISON, both laboured in it at the same time; and with them must commence the aera of systematic botany in <HI>England.</HI> It was an object thought worth contending for, and each of these writers had their partizans, who respectively be∣stowed the laurel, as they were led by their various motives, or attachments. I shall not enter into the merits of their claims, further than to observe, that both seem to have turned their attention to the subject, nearly about the same time, and that Mr. RAY had certainly priority in point of publication, if it may be allowed, that the tables which he drew up for Bishop WIL∣KINS's "Real or Universal Character," which was published in 1668, contain the outlines of a system. And, certainly, these rudiments, though hastily done, as Mr. RAY confesses, sufficiently prove that he had be∣stowed no small attention on the subject. That foreign writers have more commonly attributed to MORISON the revival of me∣thod,
<PB N="324" REF="343"/>
may have arisen from their being less acquainted with Bishop WILKINS's work, which was extant only in the <HI>English</HI> tongue. Mr. RAY informs us, in the second edition of his <HI>Catalogus Plantarum Angliae,</HI> that Dr. WILKINS meditated a translation of his "Universal Character" into <HI>Latin,</HI> with figures, for the use of foreigners; and Mr. RAY himself performed it: but the death of this good prelate, in 1672, prevented the completion of the design. He adds, that his Method, in a more elaborate state, had been delivered into the Bishop's hands, for the above-mentioned work.</P>
<P>Dr. MORISON exhibited the outlines of his scheme in the "<HI>Hortus Blesensis,</HI>" the year after the publication of the Bishop's book, and exemplified it in his "History of Plants," in 1680. Mr. RAY did not de∣tail his till the year 1682, in the "<HI>Metho∣dus,</HI>" in which he freely acknowledges the assistance he received from CAESALPINUS, COLUMNA, JUNGIUS, and even from MO∣RISON's work. On the contrary, Dr. MORISON assumes to himself the merit of having drawn all his resources, in the fa∣brication
<PB N="325" REF="344"/>
of his system, wholly from na∣ture, and his own observations; preserving every where the utmost silence, respecting any assistance derived from former writers. Assumptions, which could with difficulty be acceded to, and which drew upon him the censures of TOURNEFORT, and other masters of the science; who were well ac∣quainted with the fountains of knowledge that were then open to him, and the assist∣ances he must have drawn from GESNER, CAESALPINUS, and others.</P>
<P>At this distance of time, and under the present enlightened state of science, the sys∣tems of RAY, and of MORISON, must not be scrupulously examined. CAESALPINUS laid a foundation-stone, on which, if our <HI>British</HI> architects raised a <HI>Gothic</HI> structure, their successors have improved it to a style of greater symmetry, and elegance.</P>
<P>The introduction of <HI>system</HI> was fortunate for science, as it brought with it, by de∣grees, the establishment of generical cha∣racters, on a like assemblage of essential parts in several species. As new plants
<PB N="326" REF="345"/>
were daily discovered in the old continent, and were pouring in from the new, the nomenclature of botany was in danger of being again overwhelmed, with that chaos in which <HI>Caspar</HI> BAUHINE found it, when he reduced it into some order, by his la∣borious and incomparable <HI>Pinax.</HI></P>
<P><HI>System</HI> enabled botanists to refer new spe∣cies to <HI>genera</HI> already formed, and restrained that licence before taken, of giving a new generical appellation to each new plant: for, although in the multitude of methods which followed this discovery, plants of the same genus, in one system, were frequently referable to a different genus in another; yet, with this inconvenience annexed, they were more readily investigated, than under the vague distinctions of the older writers.</P>
<P>The restoration of <HI>system,</HI> was, in the words of LINNAEUS, the beginning of the golden age of botany; and the revival of it having taken place in <HI>England,</HI> presently raised up several learned men among us, who gave new life and vigour to the whole sci∣ence. The names of SLOANE, PLUKE∣NET,
<PB N="327" REF="346"/>
SHERARD, and PETIVER, will ever remain illustrious in the annals of botanic knowledge.</P>
<P>It also turned the attention of the learned on the continent to the subject. Rival sys∣tems were soon constructed; some on the <HI>fruit,</HI> as the basis of the classes, in confor∣mity to the systems of CAESALPINUS, RAY, and MORISON; and others, on the <HI>flower.</HI> Thus, <HI>Christopher</HI> KNAUT, in 1687, and HERMAN, in 1690, fixed on the <HI>fruit;</HI> whose systems were improved by BOER∣HAAVE, in 1710.</P>
<P>RIVINUS, in 1690, chose the <HI>flower</HI> alone; considering the <HI>number</HI> and <HI>regula∣rity</HI> of the <HI>petals,</HI> as the base of his classical characters; and was followed by RUPPIUS in 1718, and LUDWIG in 1737. TOURNE∣FORT, who elaborated his <HI>method</HI> beyond his predecessors, in 1694, chose the <HI>figure</HI> of the <HI>corolla,</HI> as the principle of <HI>classifica∣tion;</HI> and MAGNOL, in 1720, took the <HI>ca∣lyx</HI> alone.</P>
<P>If it should be enquired on this occasion, in what the <HI>methods</HI> of CAESALPINUS, RAY, and MORISON, differ from the ar∣rangements
<PB N="328" REF="347"/>
used before their time, by DO∣DONAEUS, LOBEL, and <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE, since those also are established on the habit, and in which many of the natural classes are tolerably well preserved; it may be an∣swered in a summary way, that habit, even in BAUHINE's order, the most perfect of them, is the prevailing principle, without regard to agreement in the parts of fructifi∣cation, except in those classes, where na∣ture has joined both together: this is a difference much more essential than may at first be apprehended: and, what is still less accurate than a regard to habit alone, some of their classes (if they are worthy of that appellation, no definitions of them being prefixed,) take their name merely from the mode of growing, as, <HI>Scandentes;</HI> from the structure of the leaf, <HI>Nervifoliae; Rotundi∣foliae; Crassifoliae;</HI> place of growth, <HI>Aqua∣ticae;</HI> and what is still less eligible, the aspect, and supposed agreement in the qua∣lities, such are, <HI>Malignae; Mollientes; Pa∣pavera;</HI> under all of which, are promiscu∣ously collected, plants as dissimilar as pos∣sible, in the structure of the flower and fruit.</P>

<HEAD>SEX OF PLANTS.</HEAD>
<P>TO the revival and establishment of <HI>method,</HI> succeeded a discovery of the highest importance to botanical science; I mean, what is, with great justice, called analogically, The doctrine of the <HI>sexes</HI> of plants; or, the knowledge that, throughout the vegetable kingdom, the influence of the dust of the <HI>antherae,</HI> upon the <HI>stigma,</HI> was necessary in order to produce fertile seed. By the establishment of this fact, not only the physiology of vegetables was greatly advanced, but, in the end, practical botany equally improved; since, on this foundation has been built that system of the great
<PB N="330" REF="349"/>
<HI>Swede,</HI> which is now so universally followed. Of the rise and progress of this investigation, I proceed to give a concise account, before I pursue the sketch of <HI>British</HI> authors.</P>
<P>A vague and indecisive opinion concern∣ing the <HI>sexes</HI> of plants, prevailed among the antient philosophers of <HI>Greece.</HI> We are in∣formed by ARISTOTLE, that EMPEDO∣CLES particularly taught, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the sexes were united in plants."</Q> This opinion was a natural consequence of the doctrine which this philosopher, in common with ANAXAGORAS, DEMOCRITUS, and PLA∣TO taught, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that plants were sentient and animated beings."</Q> This idea has met with ingenious advocates among the mo∣derns, who have been induced to favour it, not only from the general analogy existing between animals and vegetables, and the difficulty of fixing the limits between them, but from the more striking instances of ap∣parent irritability, and obedience to the action of certain <HI>stimuli:</HI> such are, the gene∣ral affection plants have for light; the rota∣tory motion of many towards the sun; the faculty of others in closing the leaves
<PB N="331" REF="350"/>
at night, called, not unaptly, the <HI>sleep of plants;</HI> and the opening and shutting of many flowers, at stated times, with equal propriety denominated <HI>vigiliae florum;</HI> the rising of the flower of aquatic plants out of the water, every morning during the state of florescence, as instanced in the <HI>Nym∣phaea,</HI> and still more signally in the <HI>Vallis∣neria.</HI> To these may be added the more remarkable examples in the <HI>Mimosa,</HI> and <HI>Oxalis sensitiva,</HI> in the <HI>Dionaea muscipula,</HI> the <HI>Drosera</HI> and the <HI>Hedysarum gyrans,</HI> and finally, in the exquisite irritability of the <HI>stamina,</HI> and <HI>antherae,</HI> in various species. EMPEDOCLES, nevertherless, though he maintained the doctrine of the <HI>sexes,</HI> does not attempt to confirm it by any facts, or reasonings deduced from the knowledge of the uses of the separate parts in flowers, but from analogical deduction, founded merely on his general doctrine.</P>
<P>ARISTOTLE, or rather the author of the <HI>Books on Plants,</HI> which bear his name, com∣bats the opinions of EMPEDOCLES, and his followers, respecting the sentient and ani∣mated principle in vegetables; yet it is evi∣dent
<PB N="332" REF="351"/>
he had himself no decisive ideas, or specific knowledge, drawn from nature, re∣lating to the <HI>sex</HI> of plants. He placed it, in some instances, in the different habit alone, or in other discriminations foreign to the consideration of the flower; and, though he shews an inaccurate knowledge of the particular circumstances of the palm, and the fig-tree, yet he denies, in another place, that either of them produce flowers.</P>
<P>This imperfect idea of the <HI>sex</HI> of flowers, in the <HI>Date,</HI> and even in the <HI>Fig-tree,</HI> is of high antiquity; being recorded by HERO∣DOTUS, THEOPHRASTUS, and PLINY. The necessity which the antient cultiva∣tors of the <HI>Date-tree</HI> were under, of pro∣moting the action of the male-flowers on the female, which operation held also in some measure in the <HI>Fig-tree,</HI> the <HI>Pistachia,</HI> and the <HI>Mastic,</HI> would almost necessarily suggest the application of this analogy with the animal kingdom. Nevertheless, although the fact was thus obtruded on their senses, inatten∣tive to the structure of flowers, and igno∣rant of the offices of the several parts, they remained unacquainted with the true ope∣rations
<PB N="333" REF="352"/>
of nature in this phaenomenon, though daily present to their observation.</P>
<P>The antient fathers of botany, and par∣ticularly DIOSCORIDES, it is true, applied the distinction of male and female to many other plants; but it was entirely without regard to true analogy, or discrimination of functions in the flower. It was frequently applied to such as carry all the parts of the flower within the same <HI>calyx,</HI> or on the same stalk; on account of stature; greater de∣gree of fertility; or other marks uncon∣nected with the fructification. In the <HI>diae∣cious,</HI> or such as have the <HI>stamina,</HI> and <HI>pis∣tils,</HI> on separate plants of the same species, the real male plant was, in some cases, de∣nominated the female; of which the <HI>Mer∣curialis</HI> may be mentioned as one instance, among several others.</P>
<P>Exclusive of a numerous set of plants, in which the <HI>stamina</HI> and <HI>pistils</HI> are sepa∣rately placed, either on different parts of the same individual, or on different plants of the same species, constituting the <HI>Monae∣cious</HI> and <HI>Dioecious</HI> classes of LINNAEUS, the

<P>This doctrine of the sexual analogy be∣tween plants and animals, made but little progress with the <HI>literati</HI> in botany, upon the revival of science; since the first of those who mention it, is CAESALPINUS. This critical and learned author notices male and female plants in the <HI>Oxycedrus,</HI>
<PB N="335" REF="354"/>
<HI>Taxus, Mercurialis, Urtica,</HI> and <HI>Cannabis;</HI> of which he says, the barren plants are males, and the fertile females; adding, that the latter, as is observed in the <HI>Date-tree,</HI> becomes more fruitful by being planted near the males; from thence receiving a genial <HI>effluvium,</HI> which excites a stronger fertility. From this observation, it may almost be inferred, that he had instituted experiments on some of these kinds; but we do not find that he carried the idea be∣yond the above-mentioned species, to vege∣tables in general.</P>
<P><HI>Adam</HI> ZALUZIANSKY, a <HI>Polish</HI> writer in 1592, is said, by some, to have distin∣guished the <HI>sexes</HI> of plants. I have not seen his book; but, from what is found relating to his opinion in other writers, I conjecture that his observations, if not wholly taken from CAESALPINUS, do not exhibit any original matter on this subject. In fact, no further progress was made for near an hundred years after this time; and the ho∣nour of the discovery, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that this sexual pro∣cess was universal in the vegetable king∣dom, and that the dust of the <HI>antherae</HI>
<PB N="336" REF="355"/>
was endowed with an impregnating power,"</Q> is due to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Whether the true idea of this process originated with Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> MILLINGTON, to whom it has been ascribed, may justly admit of a doubt; since Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> has left no written testimony on the subject; and Dr. GREW's mention of him does not im∣ply that he actually received the idea from him. Add to this, that Mr. RAY, in the summary view of all GREW's discoveries, which he has prefixed to his "History of Plants," does not once mention Sir <HI>Tho∣mas</HI> MILLINGTON's name. Interested as we must suppose Mr. RAY to have been, in every discovery relating to vegetables, and candid as he was in his general con∣duct to the learned, it is not likely that he should have failed, in this instance, to ren∣der praise where it was so justly due. When we further recollect, that Dr. GREW had been some years engaged in those micro∣scopical experiments, on the anatomy of plants, which have rendered his name esti∣mable with all posterity, that whilst he was thus employed in studying so intimately
<PB N="337" REF="356"/>
the organization of vegetables, and had ob∣served, that in whatsoever parts the flower might be deficient, the attire, (or <HI>stamina,</HI> and <HI>apices</HI>) is ever present, it is not strange that the true idea of its use should have been suggested to him.</P>
<P>Dr. GREW laid his opinion before the Royal Society, in a lecture on the anatomy of flowers, read Nov. 6, 1676; in which he maintained, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the primary and chief use (of the dust of the <HI>apices</HI>) is such as has respect to the plant itself, and so appears to be very great and ne∣cessary: because even those plants which have no flower, or foliature, are yet some way or other <HI>attired,</HI> so that it seems to perform its service to the seed as the fo∣liature to the fruit. In discourse hereof with our learned <HI>Savilian</HI> professor, Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> MILLINGTON, he told me, that he conceived that the <HI>attire</HI> doth serve as the male for the generation of the seed. I immediately replied, that I was of the same opinion, gave him some rea∣sons for it, and answered some objections that might oppose them."</Q> He then ex∣plains
<PB N="338" REF="357"/>
himself farther, and advances, that this foecundating power was not effected by the actual admission of the <HI>farina</HI> into the seed-vessel, but by means <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of subtle and vivific effluvia."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. RAY admitted the opinion of Dr. GREW, but, at first, with all that caution which becomes a philosopher; as appears in his "<HI>Historia Plantarum,</HI>" vol. i. p. 18. <HI>Nos ut verisimilem tantum admittimus.</HI> He assents to it with less reserve in his "<HI>Synopsis Stir∣pium Britannicarum,</HI>" edit. 1. 1690, p. 28; and in the preface to his "<HI>Sylloge Stirpium Europaearum,</HI>" published in 1694, we find him producing his reasons for the truth of it, and yielding his full approbation to it.</P>
<P>In 1695, <HI>Rudolph Jacob</HI> CAMERARIUS, professor of botany and physic at <HI>Tubingen,</HI> in his "<HI>Epistola de Sexu Plantarum,</HI>" ap∣pears among the early advocates for this analogy; and, being convinced by the argu∣ments of GREW and RAY, seems to have been the first who gave stability to the whole by experiments. These he made on <HI>Maize,</HI> the <HI>Mulberry,</HI> the <HI>Ricinus,</HI> and the <HI>Mercurialis;</HI> the three first of which he
<PB N="339" REF="358"/>
deprived of the staminiferous flowers, and the last he separated far from the female, and found, in all, that the fruit did not ri∣pen. CAMERARIUS, however, very fairly produces also, some objections against the doctrine, founded on experiments, which at this day have little weight, since they were made on plants of the <HI>Cryptogamous,</HI> or <HI>Di∣oecious</HI> classes; in the last of which, it is now known, that sometimes a flower or two of a different sex, may be found intermixed with others.</P>
<P>In 1703, Mr. <HI>Samuel</HI> MORLAND, de∣sirous, as it should seem, of extending the <HI>Lewenhoekian</HI> system of generation into the vegetable kingdom, produced a paper before the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> in which he advances—that the <HI>farina</HI> is a <HI>congeries</HI> of seminal plants, one of which must be conveyed through the style into every <HI>ovum,</HI> or seed, before it can become prolific. Mr. MOR∣LAND's hypothesis tended to confirm the general doctrine by exciting curiosity on the subject, at a time when <HI>Lewenhoek</HI>'s theory was popular; but was not admissible in itself, since few styles are hollow, or, if
<PB N="340" REF="359"/>
perceptibly tubular, not pervious enough to admit particles of the usual magnitude of the <HI>farina.</HI></P>
<P>After this time, several of the learned on the continent entered into researches on this subject. <HI>M.</HI> GEOFFROY, in 1711, in a paper read before the <HI>Royal Academy of Sci∣ences,</HI> after having formed a theory by con∣ciliating GREW's and MORLAND's into one, concludes by asserting—that the germ is never to be seen in the seed, till the <HI>fa∣rina</HI> is shed; and that if the plant is de∣prived of the <HI>stamina,</HI> before this dust is fallen, the seed will either not ripen, or will not prove fertile.</P>
<P>It is matter of surprize, that the illus∣trious TOURNEFORT should wholly reject the doctrine of the <HI>sexes</HI> of plants. So far even from acknowledging this function of the <HI>farina,</HI> that he held it to be excremen∣titious. See <HI>Isagoge in Rem Herbariam,</HI> p. 70.</P>
<P><HI>Julius</HI> PONTEDERA, a strenuous fol∣lower of TOURNEFORT, a noble <HI>Italian</HI> of <HI>Pisa,</HI> illustrious for his knowledge of the an∣tient languages, and antiquities of <HI>Italy,</HI> and not less celebrated for botanical knowledge
<PB N="341" REF="360"/>
and literature, combats also the notion of this analogy, and uses of the <HI>stamina,</HI> through the whole second book of his "<HI>Anthologia.</HI>" In the end he rejects the sexual analogy, and considers it as entirely chimerical. But finding all flowers furnished with a style, or tube, he advances, that it serves to con∣vey the air to the fruit, by which, an intes∣tine and fertilizing motion is excited in the seed, or ovary.</P>
<P>In 1718, Mons. VAILLANT published "<HI>Sermo de Structura Florum, horum Diffe∣rentia, usuque Partium;</HI>" which had been read the year before, at the opening of the Royal Garden. In this discourse, he de∣scribes the bursting of the <HI>antherae,</HI> in a style too florid for philosophical narration. He relates several of his own discoveries on the nature of the <HI>farina,</HI> and the exploding power of the <HI>antherae,</HI> and concludes with assenting entirely to Dr. GREW's sentiment, (though without naming him), that im∣pregnation is performed by means of a subtle <HI>aura,</HI> and not by the transmission of the dust through the style, alledging against it those
<PB N="342" REF="361"/>
reasons I have mentioned, in speaking of MORLAND's opinion.</P>
<P>In <HI>England,</HI> about the same time, Dr. <HI>Patrick</HI> BLAIR, by his "Botanick Essays," contributed greatly to extend the know∣ledge, and confirm the truth of this subject. BRADLEY, FAIRCHILD, MILLER, and others, assisted in the same design; and, since that period, I believe it has met with few opposers. One of the most formidable was the late learned Dr. <HI>Alston,</HI> professor of botany at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> from whose laboured disquisition, the adversaries to this opinion of the <HI>sex</HI> of flowers, may furnish them∣selves with the most cogent arguments, that an intimate knowledge of the subject hath enabled a very diligent and learned writer to produce.</P>
<P>The more recent experiments made by the Abbe SPALANZANI, with a direct view to impugn this doctrine, do not appear to have been conducted with that degree of skill, and accuracy, which is sufficient to outweigh the numerous train that may be thrown into the opposite scale. Even
<PB N="343" REF="362"/>
some of the Abbe's own experiments seem rather to strengthen the opinion he means to overthrow.</P>
<P>Having traced the history of this impor∣tant process in the economy of vegetables, to the time of LINNAEUS, I judge it will be unnecessary, to accompany the reader through a particular detail of authors below this period. In 1732, LINNAEUS founded his system on this doctrine; and the addi∣tional arguments, and experiments, produced by himself, his pupils, and followers, have established the truth of it, to the compleat satisfaction of impartial enquirers. Those, however, who wish to peruse the most per∣fect summary of all the arguments, and ex∣periments, in favour of this analogy, are referred to the "<HI>Sponsalia Plantarum,</HI>" writ∣ten in the year 1746, and printed in the first volume of the "<HI>Amoenitates Academi∣cae,</HI>" and to the "Dissertation on the Sexes of Plants," written by LINNAEUS in 1760, which obtained the premium of the Academy of <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> and has lately been translated into <HI>English</HI> by the ingenious and learned possessor of the <HI>Linnaean</HI> collec∣tion.
<PB N="344" REF="363"/>
To which may be added, the wri∣tings of KOELRUTER, in the succeeding year, which have not a little tended to confirm the subject in question.</P>
<P>It would be unjust to the memory of Dr. GREW, to conclude this history, without remarking, that the result of the latest, and best experiments, have confirmed his idea, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the <HI>farina</HI> itself is not carried to the <HI>rudiment</HI> of the seed,"</Q> but, that foecun∣dation is effected by the effluvia. This will appear, by citing the summary view of the doctrine, as exhibited by LINNAEUS himself, in the Dissertation above men∣tioned.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"While plants are in flower, the <HI>pollen</HI> falls from the <HI>antherae,</HI> and is dispersed abroad. At the same time that the <HI>pollen</HI> is scattered, the <HI>stigma</HI> is then in its highest vigour, and for a portion of the day at least is moistened with a fine dew. The <HI>pollen</HI> easily finds access to the <HI>stig∣ma,</HI> where it not only adheres by means of the dew of the part, but the moisture occasions its bursting, by which means its contents are discharged. What issued
<PB N="345" REF="364"/>
from it being mixed with the <HI>fluid</HI> of the <HI>stigma,</HI> is conveyed to the <HI>rudiments</HI> of the <HI>seed.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>I remark before I conclude, that, how just soever it may have been in a philoso∣phical view, to consider the <HI>stamina</HI> and <HI>pistils,</HI> as answering to the respective func∣tions of <HI>sex</HI> in the animal kingdom, it should not have been forgotten, that in ani∣mals, this process is voluntary; but that in vegetables, notwithstanding all that the ingenuity of the antients and moderns have urged in defence of the sentient principle, we are not <HI>yet</HI> justified in referring this pro∣cess to any other than what we are accus∣tomed to call a mechanical cause.</P>
<P>The principle of this it will not be ex∣pected that I should explain. It may be conjectured, that after a perfect elaboration of the juices in the <HI>antherae</HI> and <HI>stigmata,</HI> some species of attraction takes place be∣tween them, perhaps of the electrical kind, somewhat like this having been manifested in the flashings observable in some flowers in the evenings. The reader will easily perceive, that I refer to the appearance first
<PB N="346" REF="365"/>
seen in the <HI>Indian Cresses, (Tropaeolum ma∣jus)</HI> by <HI>Elizabeth Christina,</HI> the daughter of LINNAEUS, as related in the <HI>Swedish Acts</HI> in 1762, and since confirmed in the <HI>Garden Marigold (Calendela Officinalis),</HI> the <HI>Orange,</HI> or <HI>bulbiserous Lily (Lilium bulbiferum),</HI> and the <HI>African Marigold (Tagetes patula et erecta),</HI> by the observations of <HI>M.</HI> HAG∣GREN. And, as in the universe at large, the phaenomena of electricity are sensibly manifested to us by particular modifications of the principle occasionally excited, al∣though unquestionably ever active, so, pos∣sibly, the same principle may prevail through the whole vegetable creation in the process above mentioned, though un∣observed hitherto, except in these instances. Be this as it may, that general decorum, which is due to philosophical subjects, ought to have restrained that reprehensible language used by <HI>Vaillant,</HI> and some other writers on this subject, and even by LIN∣NAEUS himself, which has justly disgusted many readers, and prejudiced the instruction they meant to convey.</P>

<P>IT is not to the sons of erudition alone, that botany is indebted for all its disco∣veries, and improvements. The love of plants has, not unfrequently, seized, with uncommon ardour, the minds of many, on whom the light of learning had not shed its influence; and spurred them on, in the pursuit of this knowledge, to attainments that have been highly beneficial to the sci∣ence.
<PB N="348" REF="367"/>
From such, let not the pride of learning withhold that praise which is so justly due. One of the most remarkable instances of this kind, is well known to those who are conversant with the writings of MERRET, RAY, and MORISON; and I feel regret at not being able to commemo∣rate the name of <HI>Thomas</HI> WILLISEL, with some of the circumstances of his life; since I am uninformed of the time, and place, both of his birth, and of his death. This industrious man seems to have devoted much of his life to the investigation of <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> plants; and, as he lived at a time when <HI>British</HI> botany was yet imperfect, he added largely to the stock of new discoveries. He was employed by Dr. MORISON, soon after his establishment at <HI>Oxford,</HI> to collect rare <HI>English</HI> plants; and Dr. MERRET informs us, as hath been noticed, that he travelled five summers at his expence, into the dif∣ferent parts of <HI>England,</HI> to make collections for his "<HI>Pinax;</HI>" which appears to have been greatly enriched with many of the most rare species, by the labours of WILLISEL.
<PB N="349" REF="368"/>
I believe he was once sent into <HI>Ireland</HI> by Dr. SHERARD. Mr. RAY was benefited by his researches; and, if I do not mistake, he accompanied that celebrated naturalist in one of his tours. The emolument arising from these employments was probably a∣mong the principal means of his subsist∣ence.</P>
<P>His knowledge was not confined to the vegetable kingdom; since Mr. RAY in∣forms us, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he was employed by the <HI>Royal Society</HI> in the search of natural ra∣rities, both animals, plants, and mine∣rals; for which purposes he was the fit∣test man in <HI>England,</HI> both for his skill and industry."</Q></P>
<P>In the letters of Mr. RAY, there occurs an observation made by WILLISEL, of the various trees on which he had found the <HI>Misseltoe</HI> growing. I enumerate them be∣low<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<HEAD>PLOTT.</HEAD>
<P>Dr. <HI>Robert</HI> PLOTT, eminent for being the first who sketched out a plan for a na∣tural history of <HI>England,</HI> by exemplifying it in that of <HI>Oxfordshire</HI> and <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> although not professedly a writer in the botanic line, cannot be omitted in a work of this kind.</P>
<P>He was born at <HI>Borden,</HI> near <HI>Sitting∣borne,</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and educated at <HI>Wye,</HI> in the same county; entered a student in <HI>Magda∣len Hall,</HI> in 1657; and, in 1671, took the degree of doctor of laws. He became fel∣low of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> and was made one of the secretaries in 1682. In the same year he was constituted the first keeper of the <HI>Ashmolean</HI> Museum, and professor of chymis∣try: all which places he kept till 1690; having also, in 1687, been appointed <HI>Mow∣bray</HI> herald extraordinary, and register to the earl marshal, or court of honour, then newly revived, after having lain dormant from the year 1641. He died April 30, 1696. There is a whole length portrait of
<PB N="351" REF="370"/>
him, the last of the right hand group, in the <HI>Oxsord</HI> Almanack for the year 1749.</P>
<P>Dr. PLOTT was a man of various erudi∣tion, but is at this time best known for his natural histories of <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> and of <HI>Staf∣fordshire.</HI> The first of these was published in 1677, in folio; and again in 1705, with the author's corrections and additions, by his son-in-law, Mr. <HI>Burman,</HI> vicar of <HI>New∣ington,</HI> in <HI>Kent.</HI> The natural history of <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> in 1679, in folio, and re∣printed in 1686. In each of these volumes, he records the rare plants of the county, describes the dubious ones, and such as he took sor nondescripts, and figures several of them. To these works the <HI>English</HI> botanist owes the first knowledge of some <HI>English</HI> plants; and this circumstance justly entitles him to a place in this work<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is amusing to remark the price of literature a century ago The subscription for PLOTT's <HI>Stafford∣shire</HI> was, a penny a sheet, a penny a plate, and six pence the map.</NOTE>. He con∣ducted the publication of the <HI>Philosophical Transactions</HI> during part of his secretary∣ship to the Society, and wrote the follow∣ing papers:</P>

<HEAD>NATURAL HISTORY OF COUNTIES.</HEAD>
<P>I have before observed, that Dr. PLOTT was the first author of a separate volume on Provincial Natural History; in which, it is but justice to add, that, with due allowance for the time when he wrote, he has not
<PB N="353" REF="372"/>
been excelled by any subsequent writer. It were to be wished, that more examples of the like kind might be adduced; but there are few exactly of the same scope. After Bishop GIBSON, in his edition of CAM∣DEN, printed in 1695, had inserted the provincial lists of plants drawn up by Mr. RAY, several writers of county histories have, either from their own knowledge of the subject, or by the aid of friends, inserted catalogues of the <HI>more rare</HI> plants in their respective works. As these form, in an especial manner, a part of <HI>English</HI> botany, it is incumbent upon me to enumerate them.</P>
<P>The first after CAMDEN, is "The Na∣tural History of <HI>Lancashire, Cheshire,</HI> and the Peak in <HI>Derbyshire.</HI>" Oxford, 1700. fol. By <HI>Charles</HI> LEIGH, M.D. The au∣thor takes into his catalogue the maritime plants, with the others, and briefly recites the virtues, and the medicinal classes, to which the subjects belong. He subjoins his conjectures on the food of vegetables, and contests the opinion of Dr. WOOD∣WARD,
<PB N="354" REF="373"/>
that plants are nourished by the earthy principle alone.</P>
<P>"An Essay towards a Natural History of <HI>Westmorland</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> wherein an account is given of their several mi∣neral and surface productions." By <HI>Tho∣mas</HI> ROBINSON, rector of <HI>Ousby,</HI> in <HI>Cum∣berland.</HI> 1709. 8<SUP>o</SUP>. The scope of this vo∣lume principally takes in the fossils of these northern counties. The author has been mentioned before, as a correspondent of Mr. RAY. He here enumerates profes∣sedly the plants not mentioned in the <HI>Sy∣nopsis</HI> of that author, amounting to about twenty; of which, however, some were only varieties.</P>
<P>"The Natural History of <HI>Northampton∣shire,</HI> with some account of the Antiqui∣ties." By <HI>John</HI> MORETON, A.M. F.R.S. rector of <HI>Oxendon,</HI> in the same county. Lond. 1712. fol. This is a work of me∣rit. In the list of plants, several occur ad∣ditional to those noticed by RAY; even some of the mosses are not forgotten. The author treats largely on figured fossils, of
<PB N="355" REF="374"/>
which his book contains many elegant plates.</P>
<P>Of "the Natural History and Antiqui∣ties of <HI>Surrey,</HI> begun in the year 1673, by <HI>John</HI> AUBREY, Esq. F.R.S.; pub∣lished by Dr. RAWLINSON, in 5 vol. 8<SUP>o</SUP>. Lond. 1719;" I can only recite the title.</P>
<P>In the "Natural History of <HI>Cornwall,</HI>" by <HI>William</HI> BORLACE, A.M. F.R.S. Ox∣ford, 1758, we meet with a very brief list, containing about thirty-eight land plants, and twenty <HI>fuci,</HI> with some scattered remarks on the qualities and uses. Among the rare plants are the Verticillate Knotgrass, the Roman Nettle, the Gunhilly Heath, and the Cornish Pennywort; of which last there is a very indifferent figure in tab. 29. f. 6. Under the article Sun-dew, <HI>(Drosera)</HI> there is a curious and interesting observation made by Dr. BORLACE, in which he asserts, that the well-known pernicious quality of that vegetable, in producing the rot among sheep, where it abounds, does not arise from any caustic power in the vegetable, but from an insect, which lays its eggs, and feeds on the
<PB N="356" REF="375"/>
plant. From his account, this insect ap∣pears to be the <HI>Dropsy Worm</HI> of Dr. TY∣SON, or the <HI>Hydra Hydatula</HI> of LIN∣NAEUS.</P>
<P>"The Natural History and Antiquities of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and of the North Bi∣shopric of <HI>Durham,</HI> lying between the <HI>Tyne</HI> and <HI>Tweed.</HI>" By <HI>John</HI> WALLIS, M.A. 2 vol. 4<SUP>o</SUP>. Lond. 1769. The eighth chapter of the first volume treats on the vegetable productions of this tract, with the various medicinal and oeconomi∣cal uses.</P>
<P>In the "History and Antiquities of the Counties of <HI>Westmorland</HI> and <HI>Cumber∣land,</HI>" by <HI>Joseph</HI> NICHOLSON, Esq. and <HI>Richard</HI> BURN, LL.D. 2 vol. 4<SUP>o</SUP>. 1777, the reader will meet with some observations on the natural history interspersed; but the botanist will find but little interesting in his way.</P>
<P>From CAMDEN, from these histories, and other resources, Professor MARTYN has compiled an abridged list of all the rare plants, digested in the order of the coun∣ties, which is intended for the use of the

<HEAD>WHELER.</HEAD>
<P>As I do not strictly confine myself to such writers, as have distinguished them∣selves by their discoveries in the indigenous botany of <HI>Britain,</HI> alone, I cannot therefore omit to mention so eminent a man as Sir <HI>George</HI> WHELER. He was the son of Col. WHELER, of <HI>Charing,</HI> in <HI>Kent;</HI> and was born in 1650, at <HI>Breda,</HI> his parents being there in exile with the royal family. At the age of seventeen, he became a com∣moner of <HI>Lincoln College, Oxford;</HI> and, be∣fore he took any degree, went on his tra∣vels. He spent near two years in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> and, in 1675, travelled into <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Asia Minor;</HI> from whence he returned in <HI>November</HI> 1676. He was knighted before he took his master of arts degree, which was conferred upon him in 1683, in consideration of his learning, and in return for a present of antiquities col∣lected in his travels. He afterwards took
<PB N="358" REF="377"/>
some valuable preferments in the church; was created doctor of divinity in 1702; and died Feb. 18, 1724.</P>
<P>In 1682, was published, "A Journey into <HI>Greece,</HI> by <HI>George</HI> WHELER, Esq. in company of Dr. SPON, of <HI>Lyons;</HI> in six books; with four tables of coins, and many other sculptures." Fol. pp. 483.</P>
<P>These gentlemen travelled with PAUSA∣NIAS in their hands, by whose means they corrected, and explained, several of the an∣tiquities and traditions of <HI>Greece.</HI> The pri∣mary objects of these learned travellers were, to copy the inscriptions, and describe the antiquities and coins of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Asia Mi∣nor,</HI> and particularly of <HI>Athens,</HI> where they sojourned a month. These travels are highly valued for their authenticity, and are replete with sound and instructive erudition to the medallist and antiquary.</P>
<P>Mr. WHELER appears, on all occasions, to have been attentive to the natural history of <HI>Greece,</HI> and particularly to the plants, of which he enumerates several hundreds in this volume, and giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the engravings of some. These catalogues sufficiently evince
<PB N="359" REF="378"/>
his knowledge of the botany of his time. He brought from the East several which had not been cultivated in <HI>Britain</HI> before. Among these, the <HI>Hypericum olympicum</HI> (St. John's Wort of Olympus) is a well-known plant, introduced by this learned traveller. RAY, MORISON, and PLUKENET, all ac∣knowledge their obligations for curious plants received from him.</P>
<P>After Sir <HI>George</HI> WHELER entered into the church, he published "An Account of the Churches and Places of Assembly of the Primitive Christians; from the Churches of <HI>Tyre, Jerusalem,</HI> and <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI> described by <HI>Eusebius,</HI> and ocular Observations of several very an∣tient Edifices yet extant in those Parts: with a seasonable Application." Lond. 1689.</P>
<P>The Rev. <HI>Granville</HI> WHELER, of <HI>Otter∣den Place, Kent,</HI> and rector of <HI>Leak,</HI> in <HI>Not∣tinghamshire,</HI> who died in 1770, was the third son of Sir <HI>George</HI> WHELER, and be∣came his heir. He distinguished himself as a gentleman of science, and a polite scholar. He was the friend and patron of Mr. <HI>Stephen</HI>
<PB N="360" REF="379"/>
GRAY; who, jointly with him, contributed to revive the study of electricity in <HI>England.</HI> Let me be allowed to add, that I wish to mention the name of this gentleman with gratitude, from the recollection of that en∣couragement which I personally received from him in my pursuits of natural history, at a very early period of life; and which was of such a nature, as seldom fails to ani∣mate the minds of the young, to exertion and improvement.</P>
