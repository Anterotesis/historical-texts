<L>HIS Country's hope, when now the bloo∣ming Heir</L>
<L>Has left the parent's, or the guardian's care;</L>
<L>Fond to possess, yet eager to destroy,</L>

<L>So poor the wretch of current coin, you'd laugh—</L>

<L>Tho' drunk alike with CIRCE's poisonous bowl,</L>
<L>In seperate sties the mimic monsters roll.</L>

<L>But would ye learn, ye leisure-loving 'Squires</L>

By hands of Grooms ambitious to be crown'd,</L>

<L>Forfeit, forget friends, honour, and estate,</L>

Behold the youth with new-felt rapture mark</L>
<L>Each pleasing prospect of the spacious Park:</L>
<L>That Park, where beauties undisguis'd engage,</L>
<L>Those beauties less the work of art than age;</L>
<L>In simple state, where genuine Nature wears</L>
<L>Her venerable dress of ancient years;</L>
<L>Where all the charms of chance with order meet,</L>
<L>The rude the gay, the graceful and the great.</L>
<L>Here aged oaks uprear their branches hoar,</L>
<L>And form dark groves, which <HI>Druids</HI> might adore;</L>
<L>Pride and support of <HI>Britain</HI>'s conquering cross,</L>
<L>Which distant ancestors saw crown'd with moss:</L>
<L>With meeting boughs, and deepening to the view,</L>
<L>Here shoots the broad umbrageous avenue:</L>
<L>Here various trees compose a chequer'd scene,</L>
<L>Glowing in gay diversities of Green:</L>
<L>There the full stream thro' intermingling glades</L>
<L>Shines a broad lake, or falls in deep cascades.</L>
<L>Nor wants there hazle copse, or beechen lawn,</L>
<L>To chear with sun or shade the bounding fawn.</L>

<L>And see the good old seat, whose <HI>Gothic</HI> tow'rs</L>
<L>Awful emerge from yonder tufted bow'rs;</L>

<L>And dealt to Age and Want their daily bread.</L>
<L>Where garter'd knights with peerless beauties joyn'd,</L>

With antique armour hung, his trophied rooms</L>
<L>Descend to Gamesters, Prostitutes, and Grooms.</L>
<L>He sees his steel-clad Sires, and Mothers mild,</L>

<L>Whose pictur'd forms the stately gallery grace;</L>

<L>The parish wonders at th' unopening door,</L>
<L>The chimnies blaze, the tables groan no more.</L>
<L>Thick weeds around th' untrodden courts arise,</L>
<L>And all the social scene in silence lies.</L>

<L>And seem'd to soar in visionary skies.</L>
<L>Nor less, I ween, precarious is the meed,</L>

<L>For Poets have, like you, their destin'd round,</L>

<L>Long time, soft son of patrimonial ease,</L>
<L>HIPPOLITUS had ate sirloins in peace:</L>

<L>The mild <HI>October</HI> of a rural life:</L>

Like a new bruiser on BROUGHTONIC sand,</L>
<L>Amid the lists our hero takes his stand;</L>
<L>Suck'd by the Sharper, to the Peer a prey,</L>
<L>He rolls his eyes that witness huge dismay;</L>
<L>When lo! the chance of one unlucky heat,</L>
<L>Strips him of game, strong beer, and sweet retreat.</L>
<L>How awkward now he bears disgrace and dirt,</L>
<L>Nor knows the <HI>Poor's</HI> last refuge, to be <HI>pert.—</HI></L>
<L>The shiftless beggar bears of ills the worst,</L>
<L>At once with dulness, and with hunger curst.</L>

Mere modern PHAETON's, usurp the reins,</L>

<L>See side by side, the Jockey and Sir JOHN,</L>
<L>Discuss th' important point—of <HI>six to one.</HI></L>
<L>For oh, my Muse, the deep-felt bliss how dear,</L>

<L>Such noise and nonsense, betting, damning, sinking,</L>
<L>Such emphasis of oaths, and claret-drinking!</L>
<L>Like school-boys freed, they run as chance directs,</L>
<L>Proud from a <HI>well-bred thing</HI> to risque their necks.</L>
<L>The warrior's scar not half so graceful seems,</L>
