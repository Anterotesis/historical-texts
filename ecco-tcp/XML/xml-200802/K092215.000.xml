<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO whom can I address these few Sheets, with so much Pleasure and Satisfaction, as to your beauteous Self, who has at once taken the sole Possession of my Heart; and whose Charms and amiable Qualities, have so often filled my Soul with Love and A∣doration. Therefore, dear Charmer, deign to accept of this Trifle, (which was wrote with the greatest Pleasure and Delight, solely at your Request,
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
and for your kind Perusal;) nor think me prone to Flattery. I could wish it was more worthy your Attention; but am convinced, if not from its intrinsic Merit, at least for its Author's Sake, you will condescend to look upon it with some little Candour and Respect. With these flattering Hopes, I take Leave to subscribe myself,</P>

<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE following pages are the first efforts of a youthful mind, and was wrote purely for the Au∣thor's amusement, and now first collected and revised, (with such alterations, additions, and improvements, as he thought
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
necessary to make,) at the par∣ticular request of the young Lady, to whom the book is addressed; though he thinks it but justice to inform the readers, that many of the articles contained in this work, he has at different times inserted in Magazines and other periodical publications; parti∣cularly what he then called, Remarks on the Principal Per∣formers; but as they were too precipitately written, he has wrote the following Observa∣tions on a more judicious and extensive plan, by selecting what useful matter he thought necessary from the former, and having interspersed it with what he has now written, by which,
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
he flatters himself, this underta∣king, (trifling as he is sensible it must appear) wlll be thought far superior to the former; as he has given an account of all the Principal Performers that have appeared at either of the Thea∣tres from the time he formerly set out to the present Period. He has likewise added a CON∣CLUSION, wherein the Me∣rits and Demerits of most of the inferior Performers are set forth. Therefore, after saying thus much, he has nothing more to plead to his courteous Readers, (nor to judge Criticism, and his critical Court of Inquest) than by declaring his sole Motive for giving Birth to this Production,
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
was entirely to oblige the afore∣said young Lady; with that View he humbly submits it to Perusal of the indulgent Public; at the same time hoping, the sew auxiliary Forces he has been obliged to call in from other Au∣thors, will be deemed Venial, and with humble Dependence on Candour and generous Cri∣ticism, he launches his little Pinnance, trembling from the Shore.</P>

<P><PB N="2" REF="25"/>
So many pens of almost all ranks and de∣nominations in literature, for these thirty years past, have been employed in treating of Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> both as an actor and a wri∣ter; that I must confess I find it a difficult task to collect untouched materials; as such I shall not at this time presume to enter into the merit, or demerit, of this first-rate ornament of the British Stage, for fear I should become a vile encroacher, and con∣sequently make use of another man's pro∣perty as my own: therefore, in order to a∣void as much as possible this observation, I shall only give my courteous readers a de∣scription of his person; though at the same time, I must beg leave to intersperse a little borowed matter, in order to speak of him with more precision than I probably might without these materials. But to his person, Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> though low in stature, is regu∣larly made, and well proportioned; his face is strongly and finely featured, but on the whole not handsome; and yet, much less cannot be said to the contrary. His eyes have
<PB N="3" REF="26"/>
been ever and universally admired; their cut is what a painter would call bold and perfect, their size is big, the pupil large, strong, lively, active, and variable; their colour dark, surrounded and set off with a due proportion of white, that gives to their every motion, a brilliancy, a distinctness, a life that speaks in every glance. His com∣plexion is dark; and lastly his voice, which, from its harmony, sweetness, and moreover from it's pliancy, and extensive variety, has ever been admired. Having given a brief and just account of Mr. <HI>Garrick's</HI> person, I shall proceed to relate the names of some of the most celebrated characters this great actor shines in; without attempting to en∣ter into his excellence in any particular, for fear I should suffer for my presumption, and run my account of this gentleman into a pro∣lixity of useless and unmeaning matter; as such my intention is to touch upon Mr. <HI>Gar∣rick,</HI> (as well as the following performers in general) in as true and concise manner as possible.

<HEAD>Mr. SMITH.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. SMITH is a very pleasing and judi∣cious actor; and in the parts of the unaffected well-bred gentleman, he irreproachably claims the foremost rank on the stage, for uniform elegance, ease, and suitable viva∣city. His person is likewise one of the genteelest that I know; and his whole de∣portment admirably polite and affable. What a pity it is, that this actor should so often mistake his abilities, by straying out of that road which nature has so happily placed him in; did he retain less thoughts of his unfavourable muse Melpomene, and confine himself more to his best friend Thalia, I would insure his success to be much greater than it is, as not one upon
<PB N="6" REF="29"/>
the stage would have a chance to equal him in his walk: not but I must allow Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> to have many capital requisites for a trage∣dian, but he is apt to wade out of his depth; and were it not for his agility and good sense, I am persuaded he would sometimes be in danger of drowning: wherefore I greatly prefer in him the comedian to the tragedian; he is more self-bred, and has a greater variety in the former than in the latter; in tragedy he has too much levity, and wants expression, and his voice though clear and sonorous, wants variation; as he scarce ever speaks but in one continual tone: yet he possesses great fervour and manly spirit; particularly in his Richard, his Alexander, and the like; his Jachimo, his Phocyas in the siege of Damascus, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are inimitable; and his late attempt in Orestes in the Distress'd Mother, has de∣servedly gained him no small share of ap∣plause, being chaste and respectable through∣out the whole. And were there not quite such a repeated sameness in Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s
<PB N="7" REF="30"/>
action and voice, there would be no doubt of his becoming a very accomplished actor.</P>
<Q><L>Smith is at once the manly and genteel,</L>

<HEAD>Mr. REDDISH.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. REDDISH possesses some strokes of very conspicuous merit, though many de∣grees inferior to a gentleman he assumes to equal, I mean Mr. Barry; yet vanity (I am told) has often prompted him to declare himself second to none but Mr. <HI>Garrick▪</HI> O! man, man, why art thou so vain!—Till Mr. <HI>Reddish</HI> can divest himself of a stiff, heavy figure, a set face, and a broken mo∣notony of voice, he may assure himself the seeing and sagacious public will rate him far

inferior to the above gentleman. Mr. <HI>Red∣dish</HI> without doubt has a tolerable good share of judgment in his profession, whereby it renders him very useful in the various parts he performs; but with all the vanity he may possess himself with, he never will be able to fill a first form, at least not at such a theatre as Drury-Lane; for in many characters he wants variety, likewise ex∣pression, and a pliancy of features to exert his exterior powers: were he endowed with Mr. <HI>Barry</HI>'s features and voice, no doubt but he'd fall very little short of that gentle∣man's abilities; but as dame Nature has not been so favourable in adapting him with Mr. <HI>Barry</HI>'s theatrical requisites, I would advise him to content himself as he is, and not let ambition reign in his breast, for fear it should prove hurtful to him, as he never can prefume to reach capital excellence, except in a few particular parts, as Edgar, in Lear; Moneses, in Tamerlain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> wherefore I am under the indespensable ne∣cessity

<P>This actor's forte seems to lie mostly in the impassioned declamatory parts of tra∣gedy, in which he without doubt deserves notice. He has of late made some few at∣tempts in comedy; but I cannot by any means admire him in the sock; although his person and voice are both agreeable, yet he wants that natural ease and vivacity in his manner, so peculiarly necessary for the comedian, without which he never can render himself considerable in this; though there are some few parts wherein he makes a tolerable and decent appearance; as Stockwell in the West Indian, and Sir John Flowerdale in the School for Fathers; these being best suited to his manner of acting;

<HEAD>Mr. KING.</HEAD>
<P>This favourite gentleman's outset was in some of the country companies. After being tired with his country pursuits, he came to London, and engaged himself at Drury-Lane Theatre, and what is very re∣markable, Mr. <HI>King</HI> during the whole time of his engagement at this theatre, never was known once to fill a character that seemed suitable to his talents; this probably was the motive that induced him at that time to quit Drury-Lane, and engage himself
<PB N="11" REF="34"/>
under the banners of Mr. Sheridan in Ire∣land; it being here where he broke out a co∣median of the first rank. He remained in Ireland for several years, but from a fracas happening among the principal performers of that theatre he quitted his service like a valiant soldier, and came over once more to general Garrick, where ever since he has continued to be one of the greatest favou∣rites on the stage, by giving such repeated proofs of his excellent performance, as rank him (Mr. Garrick excepted) the best come∣dian on the English stage; take all in all, perhaps the best. And as a prologue speaker in the comic style, I would ask where is his equal? (the above gentleman once more ex∣cepted); he possesses in an eminent degree, that lively, spirited, and quick sensation in his manner, which is so admirably adapted for speaking this kind of writing. But a∣bove all, is that sly knowledge of the world, which is so excellently blended in Mr. <HI>King's</HI> features, and in his action, that it oftimes

Though I have seen him with equal merit in some parts of low co∣medy; as such, I should imagine Mr. <HI>Dodd</HI> has it in his power to be as much the Sir Gravity as the Sir Fopling: for instance,
<PB N="14" REF="37"/>
his Andrew Ague Cheek, in the Twelfth Night; his Crispn, in the Anatomist; and Old Kicksy, in the Irish Widow; are laugh∣able in the highest degree.

<HEAD>SPRANGER BARRY, ESQ;</HEAD>
<P>FEW people in the theatrical province, I believe, are ignorant that we are in∣debted to Ireland for the birth of this gentle∣man, and likewise to his early misfortunes that occasioned him to make an attempt on the stage; a profession he certainly by na∣ture was designed for, and where he has shone for upwards of thirty years past, with so much profit to himself, and pleasure to the public, as only to be rivalled by our English Roscius.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="56"/>
Mr. BARRY's first outset in this sphere of life was in the part of Othello, to the surprizing satisfaction and amazement of the general audience; for sure never did young actor shew such judgment in the choice of his first part; he seemed a finished Othello (as Chetwood terms it) dropt from the clouds, which has ever since continued to be his favourite character; and if we take a slight survey of Mr. <HI>Barry</HI>'s features, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we need not wonder at his success in this part. First, the graces of manly beau∣ty which are so favourably blended in his person; secondly, the prodigious flexibility and harmony of his voice, which is so ex∣cellently adapted for the exhibition of Othello; in short, in this part and others I shall mention, he is beyond critical excep∣tion. For example, where is his equal in Jaffier, Romeo, and Castalio, he is not even surpassed by the mighty chief Mr. <HI>Garrick;</HI> though I am extremely partial to that gentleman's abilities, yet justice obliges me to make this observation, notwithstand∣ing
<PB N="34" REF="57"/>
there are many scenes in the two first parts, in which Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> eminently ex∣cells: but upon critical examination, I be∣lieve it will be generally allowed, through the whole course of those characters, Mr. <HI>Barry</HI> takes the lead: though to draw any sort of parallel between those two gentle∣men would be beyond my judgment, and consequently presumptive, therefore I shall content myself with only making mention of a circumstance of this sort, and leave the rest for some more able critic to pursue. As to Castalio, I don't at this time recollect an instance of Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>'s performing it; Mr. <HI>Barry</HI>'s superiority over any other actor in the lover's part, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> must undoubtedly render him in this character matchless, from his amorous harmony of features, melting eyes, and unequalled plaintiveness of voice, which are requisites so peculiarly happy for forming the lover, that it is no wonder Mr. <HI>Barry</HI> should excell so far be∣yond any other performer in this province.
<PB N="35" REF="58"/>
I remember once to have seen this gentle∣man in Romeo, particularly in the garden scene of this favourite play, (where Juliet appears at the window) I thought he spoke the following lines incomparably fine, with a syrenic sweetness of voice.</P>
<Q><L>See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.</L>
<L>Oh! that I were a glove upon that hand,</L>
<L>That I might touch that cheek.</L></Q>
<P>And afterwards when Juliet replies, "Ah! me," then with what extacy he immediate∣ly spoke these words:</P>
<Q><L>—She speaks! she speaks!</L>
<L>Oh! speak again, bright angel, for thou art</L>
<L>As glorious to this sight, being o'er my head,</L>
<L>As is a winged messenger from Heaven.</L></Q>
<P>In the parting scene in the third act of this play, I likewise thought him exceeding picturesque and affecting, where he takes
<PB N="36" REF="59"/>
leave of Juliet in a short sentence, ending as follows:</P>

<P>He seemed to penetrate the foregoing line into the hearts of the most distant spec∣tators: but what I mostly admired in Mr. <HI>Barry</HI>'s performance of this part, was the beginning of the tomb scene, where Juliet wakes; here a transport of joy, love, and tenderness flows within him; with what acclamation and rapture he delivered this sentence:</P>

There are many more beauties and ex∣cellencies I could remark in Mr. <HI>Barry</HI>'s performances, in the pathetic and amor∣ous; but being too long for the limits of my design, they would appear tedious: all the imperfections I can discover about Mr. <HI>Barry</HI> is in his action, which is sometimes rather flat and unmeaning to the true sense of his words, and likewise a stoop in his shoulders, and a bend in his knees, as if he was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hamed of his superior stature, (as a critic observes) and desirous to level it to the common standard: but I forget that he is bordering on the vale of years, conse∣quently such blemishes as those must now be pardoned and forgiven.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. LEE.</HEAD>
<P>This established veteran from Ireland, made his appearance this winter at Covent Garden, in the part of Bayes in the Re∣hearsal, though I was not so fortunate as to be present at this exhibition, I cannot therefore pretend to be a competent judge of his merit in that part: but by what I have seen of him since in Benedict, Richard the third, and Osman in Zara, I think he has great abilities: he has numberless beau∣ties which are entirely his own, as he ap∣pears to be free from imitation, and built upon nature for his guide; wherefore his performances shew themselves rather in a new dress; but how far it may be requisite I will not presume to say, though I must confess he gave pleasure to me, yet might not to others. In regard to this actor's fi∣gure, I can't speak much in its praise, I think him too corpulent and masculine;
<PB N="39" REF="62"/>
notwithstanding his features are expressive, his voice articulate and powerful, his action just and graceful, and his deportment tole∣rable easy and refined, and what is more observable, free from that stiffness, (consi∣dering his part) many actors are subject to; these requisites, joined to a true understand∣ing of his merit, must render Mr. <HI>Lee</HI> a va∣luable addition to the above stage.</P>

<P>What can I say of this gentleman, whose very conspicuous abilities are so well known and admired in the sock, by every fre∣quenter of the theatre. The public I be∣lieve, need not be told that this veteran's
<PB N="42" REF="65"/>
outset on the stage, was at first as an harle∣quin; he being articled to the late Mr. Rich, the celebrated harlequin, and mana∣ger of Covent-garden theatre; after being instructed in all the requisites of pantomime, he acquired so extensive a knowledge of the sock, that at the expiration of his term, he was engaged by his pantomical master, as a comedian, at a very considerable salary; and soon after acquired a first-rate reputation in his cast of parts. Few are the walks of co∣medy Mr. <HI>Woodward</HI> has not attempted, and not any wherein he has not met with great and merited applause. His figure is genteel, his voice smart, agreeable, and pli∣ant; and both seem to point out the politer cast; yet is somewhat odd, that this actor never pleases his audience more, than when he is necessitated, from his characters, to distort that genteel figure into the aukward deportment of a country looby; or to swell his voice out of its natural tone, into the hectoring accents of a bully, or a blusterer; and he never receives the first blow from any
<PB N="43" REF="66"/>

<P>This Lady made her first appearance on the stage in one of the county towns of

England, but in what character, or where for a certainty, I will not presume to say; however, be this as it will, it is now two seasons since she first appeared at Covent-Garden theatre, in the character of Jane Shore, in which she was received with re∣spectable marks of applause by a very bril∣liant audience.—This Lady is an exceeding good sigure; in her person she is tall and elegant, her face is likewise remarkably handsome, and her whole deportment gen∣teel and easy; in short, she is the finest figure on the London stage: therefore it is not to be wondered, a lady endued with such requisites for this profession should gain great applause, had she absolutely little or no merit. But this is not Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI>'s case, her excellent performance of the above, and many other parts she has since appeared in, has fully convinced us to the contrary. Her performance of Elfrida, Sta∣tira, and Rosamond in Mr. Hull's new play of King Henry the Second, I believe has given the public incontestable proofs of her

rising genius. The only fault I can discover in this Lady, is, her voice is somewhat harsh, and she is sometimes apt to wind it beyond the bounds of harmony: did Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI> take a little more pains in modulat∣ing her accents, it would add greatly to her praise.

<HEAD>The CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>Having given an account of all the prin∣cipal actors and actresses, that have appear∣ed on the stage for upwards of two years back, I shall now favour the reader with some remarks on the inferior performers,
<PB N="64" REF="87"/>
such as are not destitute of merit, although annot be deemed as capitals; the first of those gentry stands Mr. Lee Lewes, this per∣son is a thriving and pleasing comedian; there is a smartness in his manner that must one time render him considerable. The next are Mr. J. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ckin and Mr Wroughton, two respectable performers where nothing great is wanting; the first much superior to the latter in critical estimation, being a just and decent performer; the other is too much guilty of mouthing, as Shakespeare terms it, and is not totally engaging in his manner, and wants expression, &amp;c. Mr. Dunstall is a good low comedian, but like the preceding gentleman, too much of a mou∣ther: notwithstanding, his Hodge, and Sir Jealous Traffick, are inimitable, such cha∣racters being happily suited to his manner. Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Packer are useful men, the first considerably the be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in trage∣dy, and pretty equal in comedy, though both bordering on the palm of insipidity.—Mr. Hull is a gentleman who understands
<PB N="65" REF="88"/>
his author, and the drama, exceeding well, is very capable of supporting paternal cha∣racters, but for want of powers in other views, he is no ways important as an actor, though a very chaste and respectable dra∣matic writer. Mr Clinch and Mr Diamond, these two gentlemen started the same sea∣son at Drury-lane theatre, <HI>(i. e.)</HI> in October 1772, the one in Alexander the Great, the other in Romeo; Mr. Clinch has since pro∣ved to be a Clinch, for he clinches so voci∣ferously, that if he is not less violent, he will inevitably tear himself, and his parts to rags; therefore I would advise him not to be so lavish with his superfluous fire and action, as by observing this observation, he would bustle through his cast of characters with much more decency and applause than he usually does. Mr Diamond displayed on his first appearance, very conspicuous me∣rit in some scenes of Romeo; in others, he was totally insufficient, in judgment, voice, and expression, particularly in the frantic scenes; but on the whole, he supported
<PB N="66" REF="89"/>
that character (considering his age, which was then but nineteen,) with tolerable ease and propriety: Mr. Diamond has left Drury-lane, but in what quarter of the globe he is at present, I will not presume to fay. Mr Lacy; this gentleman made his appearance last winter in Alexander, but not meeting (in his attempt) with so much pu∣blic indulgence as was literally expected, he has, I believe, cordially relinquished all thoughts of any future trial on the stage. Mr. Melmoth; this ingenious person came out last benefit time, in the part of Cyrus, which character he went through with candid applause; he has since played Hamlet, and is far from being contempti∣ble in it, having a very good knowledge of his author, and a just conception of the part, and with a little cultivation of his talents, he may be enabled to make no inconsidera∣ble stand as a tragedian. Mess. Bannister, Reinhold, and Du-Bellamy; nothing of speakers, but well esteemed singers; the

two first have excellent base voices, the last an inimitable counter, though greatly inju∣red by a defective ear to music. There are many more I could thrust into my account, such as Mr. Waldron, Mr. Young, Mr. Booth, Mr. Brereton, &amp;c. &amp;c. but are not worthy our attention; as such I shall pro∣ceed to the ladies in this circle of action; among which stands foremost, Mrs. Pitt; this is a truly great actress in her walk, which is in the parts of superannuated old maids, without her equal on the stage. The next stands Mrs. Lessingham and Mrs. Melmoth, the former is very agreeable in some parts of comedy, but wretchedly hor∣rible in tragedy; being destitute of voice, manner, expression, and in short, almost every requisite; the latter has not yet at∣tempted comedy, but has continued (since her first appearance in Calista, in the Fair Penitent) to be very respectable in several parts of tragedy, and seems to be a promi∣sing lady. Mrs. Greville and Miss Jarratt; two very pretty women, and thriving ac∣resses;

Miss Jar∣ratt is so very agreable in all she undertakes, and gives such repeated prooss of her grow∣ing merit, that it is neeedless for me to say more on the subject, than by adding, that she is a pretty, decent, and promising actress.

<HEAD>STRICTURES On the much admired TRAGEDY of the ORPHAN.</HEAD>
<HEAD>In a LETTER to a Young LADY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Miss,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE this opportunity to fulfil your request, as it is unbounded happiness to me at all times to devote myself to your service, but I am excessive bad at compli∣ments, I therefore shall leave these to nove∣lists, &amp;c. and proceed to the subject of the play; which is a very affecting circum∣stance. The story on which this tragedy is founded, is that of Iphigenia, which is wrought up with such masterly elocution by Mr. Otway the author, that those audi∣tors who are not excited at the representa∣tion
<PB N="70" REF="93"/>
of this play, must be void of common feeling; and more especially when a Barry appears in Castalio, or a Mrs. Barry in Mo∣nimia, or the excellent performance of a Garrick in Chamont, which I remember to have seen; and when thus supported by three such inimitable ornaments, together with the enraptured stile of the author, who then I say, but the dullest, unfeeling auditor, but what must be excited at such an exhibi∣tion; for who can behold the distressful si∣tuations of Castalio, and the injured Moni∣mia, without sharing in their affliction.—The first scene in this play that should raise our passions, is in the second act, where Monimia upbraids Castalio for his leaving her alone to the intreaties of his brother Po∣lidore; which he, like an equivocating friend, does, in order to calm his brother's rage; seeing the ardour of his passion for her, and not willing to offend him, imagining at the same time, all Polidore's solicitations to Monimia would be in vain, being sensible Monimia's affections were entirely to him∣self.
<PB N="71" REF="94"/>
Therefore what auditor would not be affected at Castalio's griefs, when the ob∣ject of his heart upbraids him, and vows ne∣ver to listen to him more. What distress the poor crying Castalio appears to be in, when he speaks the following sentence to her.</P>
<Q><L>Who can hear this, and bear an equal mind,</L>
<L>Since you will drive me from you, I must go;</L>
<L>But Oh! Monimia, when thou hast banished me▪</L>
<L>No creeping slave, though tractable and dull</L>
<L>As artful woman, for her end would chuse,</L>
<L>Shall ever dote as I have done, for Oh!</L>
<L>No tongue my pleasure nor my pains, can tell,</L>
<L>Tis Heav'n to have thee, and without thee Hell.</L></Q>
<P>Then after he has spoken the foregoing sentence, when his beloved Monimia is so charmed with the music of his tongue, that she forgives and pities him. Then what extatic joy flows immediate within him; with what rapture does the following speech come from his mouth. But never
<PB N="72" REF="95"/>
more so, than when it is delivered by the sweet, melodious, and expressive voice, and manner of a Barry.</P>
<Q><L>Where am I, surely paradise is round me,</L>
<L>Sweets planted by the hand of Heav'n grow here,</L>
<L>And ev'ry sense is full of thy perfection;</L>
<L>To hear thee speak, might calm a madman's frenzy,</L>
<L>Till by attention he forgot his sorrows.</L>
<L>But to behold thy eyes, the amazing beauties,</L>
<L>Might make him rage again with love, as I do.</L>
<L>To touch thee's Heaven, but to enjoy thee, Oh!</L>
<L>Thou nature's whole perfection in one piece;</L>
<L>Sure framing thee, Heav'n took unusual care,</L>
<L>As it's own beauty, it design'd thee fair,</L>
<L>And form'd thee by the best lov'd Angel there.</L></Q>
<P>The next and most affecting circumstance in this play is in the third act, after Casta∣lio's marriage with Monimia, when they confer together concerning enjoying at night their nuptial happiness; <Q>which, after some intreaty, Monimia condescends, when
<PB N="73" REF="96"/>
all the family are at rest, to let him into her chamber, when he, Castalio, by order of Monimia is to make a certain signal, (<Q>which is three soft taps at the chamber∣door</Q>)</Q> at which he is to gain admit∣tance: but, alas! unhappily his brother Polidore listens, and over-hears the whole tenor of their appointment; therefore, not knowing of their marriage, Polidore is much chagrined at the thoughts of Casta∣lio's happiness, he was going to reap with the fair Monimia. In consequence, he contrives a plot to enjoy her if possible him∣self: accordingly he gets his little page Cordelia to go and trifle with Castalio in order to delay the time; in the mean while, he counterfeits his brother, and with the aforesaid signal gains entrance, and enjoys Monimia; she at the same time mistaking him for her lord Castalio.—Unfortunately, the poor fond adorer comes, according to his appointment made, glowing with rap∣ture at the thoughts of his blissful night to come with his dear Monimia; but unhap∣pily
<PB N="74" REF="97"/>
he is refused admittance by the maid servant, being conscious (as she thought) she let Castalio in before, and imagining the real husband to be the counterfeit Po∣lidore. Who can behold such a scene as this, without sharing in the distresses of Castalio? and more especially, when he lay down at the door almost distracted, think∣ing it is Monimia's cruelty that has used him thus.</P>
<P>In the fourth act, we see Castalio up∣braid Monimia in the most fervent manner possible, for her severe treatment, as he supposed, which she is greatly surprised at, and well she may be, when at the sight of him she flies with energy to his arms, ima∣gining how happy she was in his embraces the preceding night; at the same time, as I have observed, it was the profligate Poli∣dore. What should most excite our feeling in this act, is to see the injured Monimia dragged like a dog by her beloved Castalio to the door, when he cruelly breaks from
<PB N="75" REF="98"/>
her with all the fierceness of a fiend; and afterwards when she acquaints her brother Chamont, of the severe and unexpected treatment which she has received from her lord; at which, how chagrined and exas∣perated is Chamont for the injury done to his sister, and vows vengeance on Castalio: with what exclamation he speaks the fol∣lowing lines to old Acasto Castalio's father.</P>
<Q><L>—I say my sister's wrong'd,</L>
<L>Monimia my sister, born as high,</L>
<L>And noble as Castalio,—do her justice,</L>
<L>Or, by the Gods, I'll lay a scene of blood,</L>
<L>Shall make this dwelling horrible to nature;</L>
<L>I'll do't—hark you, my lord, your son Castalio,</L>
<L>Take him to your closet, and there teach him manners.</L></Q>
<P>With what unbounded excellence Mr. Garrick speaks the above sentence; what contempt he shews when he utters the last two lines, that so elegantly discovers how much he is displeased at the cruel usage done
<PB N="76" REF="99"/>
to Monimia; that in short, this last scene is exceeding natural and affecting.—The last act, at the rising of the curtain, disco∣vers the unhappy Castalio lying on the ground in a state of lunacy, cursing Moni∣mia, and all the inconstant sex of women, till a servant enters, and acquaints him, how wild and intemperate Monimia is for to behold her lord; at which he relinquish∣es all of a sudden into love and tenderness for her. <Q>Soon after, Monimia enters, and after some conference together, she tells him, <Q>She is resolved from that day never more to see his face again</Q>:</Q> in what dis∣tressful accents he immediately after speaks this sentence:</P>
<Q><L>Where am I! sure I wander 'midst enchant∣ment,</L>
<L>And never more shall find the way to rest;</L>
<L>But, Oh! Monimia, art thou indeed resolv'd</L>
<L>To punish me with everlasting absence;</L>
<L>Why turn'st thou from me, I am alone al∣ready;</L>
<L>Methinks I stand upon a naked beach,</L>
<L><PB N="77" REF="100"/>
Sighing to winds, and to the seas complain∣ing,</L>
<L>Whilst afar off, the vessel s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ils away,</L>
<L>Where all the treasure of my soul's embark'd:</L>
<L>Wilt thou not turn—Oh! could those eyes but speak,</L>
<L>I should know all, for love is pregnant in 'em;</L>
<L>They swell, they press their beams upon me still;</L>
<L>Wilt thou not speak, if we must part for ever,</L>
<L>Give me but one kind word to think upon,</L>
<L>And please myself withal, whilst my heart's breaking.</L></Q>
<P>Mrs. Barry, the original Monimia, I am told, always shed tears at this beautiful, or rather bewitching passage, as it may pro∣perly be so called; and afterwards when she replied and exits, "Ah! poor Castalio," I have heard, in speaking these three words she has been so much affected, seeing at that instant the distressed situation Castalio appeared to be in, that it was always some
<PB N="78" REF="101"/>
time before she rightly could recover her∣self; and dull must be the apprehension of the auditor that is not affected with such a scene: notwithstanding what we see is only feigned to us; yet, in all probability, the story from whence the origin of this tra∣gedy was founded was true, wherefore, such an instance represented should most certainly excite our feelings. But, to pro∣ceed, the catastrophe of this play is very judiciously wound up by the author, and abounds with a variety of incidents; for here we see the fall of Monimia, Castalio, and Polidore, and Chamont vowing de∣struction on Acasto and all his house, for the injury done his sister. The conclusion is prodigiously affecting, though our pity should only be reserved for the good old father Acasto, the injured Monimia, and the poor unfortunate son Castalio; as the fall of Polidore should not in the least affect us, he being nothing more than a mere proselyte of vice.—The author of this play (I believe it will be generally allowed by all
<PB N="79" REF="102"/>
impartial judges) wrote more immediately to the heart in painting the tender passions than any of his predecessors; or, in short, any of his cotemporaries, excepting Rowe' who in his productions comes the nearest to Otway of any other dramatic author, either ancient or modern, particularly in his favourite tragedy of the Fair Penitent; where all the characters in this play are supported with so much judgment, and the language so extremely elegant, as is the Orphan, that by the great resemblance there is in the style of these two plays, we might almost imagine them to be the pro∣duction of one man: though it must be confessed, Rowe in his dialogues is more chaste and praise worthy than Otway; for the latter is in many instances indecent, and deficient of moral tendency, which the former strictly confined himself to; for ex∣ample, in the Orphan, Polidore's allusion of the bull is contemptible and absurd in the highest degree; and in the little page's cha∣racter there are many indecencies, especially
<PB N="80" REF="103"/>
for a child to speak, (it being mostly per∣formed by one) but we must impute them to the licentiousness of the age he wrote in. But I may as well drop the curtain, as Cib∣ber says, at the same time, hoping to have your opinion as soon as convenient, on the little matter I have here sent you, and with humble submission,</P>

<HEAD>STRICTURES On the favourite TRAGEDY of the FAIR PENITENT, In a LETTER to the same.</HEAD>
<HEAD>LETTER THE SECOND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mifs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEING ever (as I told you in my last) devoted to your service; I therefore, in compliance with your request, a second time, and in order to fulfil my promise, have sent you a few thoughts on the <HI>Fair Penitent</HI> accordingly.—The subject of this play is an excellent moral; it shews in an eminent degree, the dangerous consequence of parents forcing their children into mar∣riage against their own inclinations; and
<PB N="82" REF="105"/>
paints nature in a very conspicuous manner. Mr. Wilkes in his general review of the stage, remarks on this tragedy, that there is not one character in the whole play de∣serves compassion; yet, I must confess, I am of a different opinion: and he further observes, the heroine of this play has no manner of right to the above title; <Q>that gentleman says, <Q>her grief does not spring from compunction, but from a variety of passions which she is prevented from gra∣tifying:</Q></Q> probably he would have the play termed "The Penitent Prostitute," which I think is far too gross a title, notwithstand∣ing she yields to Lothario before her mar∣riage with Altamont. In my poor opinion, I think her rather to be pitied, as many of her sex, that would be strictly virtuous, are liable to the same failing in the heat of blood, (as I please thus vulgarly to term it) and especially with a man she sincerely loved. Is not Sciolto her father in the wrong, when he knows she loves Lothario, to force her into marriage with another
<PB N="83" REF="106"/>
man whom she has not the least veneration for: though her husband is passionately doating of her, what is this▪ to the purpose, when it is quite the reverse with Calista; for if both hearts do not mutually agree in the conjugal state, how is it possible the parties can be happy? How many, like Calista, have been deluded by the soothing tales of the male sex, and by their proffer∣ing marriage, as Lothario did to Calista, and afterwards deceived them. To be sure, Lothario is a rakish young gentleman, and like many more of the present age, when he has gained his ends, in enjoying the fair flame, he afterwards has no further regard; as Foote says, "When they are gratified, then they are satisfied."</P>
<P>Therefore, dear Miss, (though my own sex) be cautious how you listen to their al∣luring enticements, for it is exceeding pre∣earious trusting men, there being so many seducers, that your sex cannot have too great a guard over themselves; and they
<PB N="84" REF="107"/>
have so many wheedling and trepanning ways to decoy poor harmless and unthinking maids, by telling them (as Mackheath says) a hundred things which they never mean to perform, things that your sex are apt to put too much confidence in: through which means, they sometimes render themselves a common prey to their lewd and abandoned desires, and then inevitable ruin conse∣quently ensues: and at the same time, they not only reflect dishonour upon themselves, but likewise bring much trouble and afflic∣tion on their aged parents, that have taken great care and diligence in bringing them up to an age of discretion, and in hopes of seeing them tread in the paths of virtue▪ in∣stead of that, they too, too often fall a sa∣crifice to their spotless virginity, (like the heroine of the foregoing play) by building their hopes on such a sandy foundation as perfidious men; as such they become the scoff and ridicule of all their former ac∣quaintance, and are despised by those who before were their most ardent friends, I
<PB N="85" REF="108"/>
could dwell with energy much longer on this subject, but being rather obliged to proceed with the few remarks I have to make on the play, it will be inconsistent and intruding on your patience: but before I proceed, I must beg to be excused for the little I have said on the above topic, as my motive for interspersing this matter, is en∣tirely for the love of your future welfare▪ as such, and for no other reason, was it wrote. But to the play. Though, does not Calista after her marriage with Alta∣mont reject all Lothario's offers with the utmost contempt, when he wants to enjoy her a second time, with those words:</P>
<Q><L>How didst thou dare to think that I would live,</L>
<L>A slave to base desires, and brutal pleasures;</L>
<L>To be a wretched wanton for thy leisures,</L>
<L>To toy, and waste an hour of idle time with,</L>
<L>My soul disdains thee for so mean a thought.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="86" REF="109"/>
In short, I think her all through the play, an object fully deserving pity. As for the poor fond and gentle Altamont, I likewise pity his case much, although the ill usage he treats his friend Horatio with; for it is naturally to be supposed, he would put more confidence in the story the object of his heart related, than that which his friend told him, and especially at a time he be∣lieves her spotless. How often do we see a circumstance of this kind among the lower class of people, a man and his wife shall quarrel, or what not, a friend comes and in∣terferes in behalf of the parties: then af∣terwards gets most infamously abused for his civility. As for Sciolto the father, claims scarce any compassion; as he may partly thank himself for all the sorrow and shame he has brought on his old age; and I sincerely wish that every parent whom pro∣vidence has endued with a family of chil∣dren, would take warning by Sciolto's mis∣conduct,
<PB N="87" REF="110"/>
and not force them into marriage against their own consent; but as sir Jea∣lous Traffic, in the Busy Body says,</P>
<Q><L>By my example let all parents move,</L>
<L>And never strive to cross their children's love;</L>
<L>They should submit that care to providence above.</L></Q>

<HEAD><HI>A</HI> Prologue, <HI>intended to be spoken on the</HI> Au∣thor's <HI>first appearance on the Stage, in the Character of</HI> George Barnwell.</HEAD>
<L>BEfore this awful court, to-night appears,</L>
<L>A youth of tragic parts, yet full of fears;</L>
<L>Bashful and young, he ventures on the stage,</L>
<L>Hoping your kind attention to engage;</L>
<L>Barnwell's the theme, wherein he means to shew</L>
<L>That youth's misfortunes, and excessive woe;</L>
<L><PB N="130" REF="153"/>
By which he hopes to draw a tender tear</L>
<L>From you kind auditors that's fitting here;</L>
<L>But ah! he fears that some stern wag will say,</L>
<L>"That stripling sure can never Barnwell play;</L>
<L>"He has not courage, wants a bolder face</L>
<L>"To act young Barnwell with a decent grace."</L>
<L>But soft, <HI>(pauses)</HI> I think he told me, if I'm right,</L>
<L>He dreamt a dream most wonderful last night;</L>
<L>He thought that he was acting on the stage,</L>
<L>And in an instant burst into a rage;</L>
<L>On hearing of a critic in the pit,</L>
<L>Exclaim against him with his nauseous wit;</L>
<L>But presently he thought he was appeas'd,</L>
<L>By gen'rous friendship, which to him in∣creas'd;</L>
<L>'Twas Lady Dorothea that stood his friend</L>
<L>And with this critic did herself contend;</L>
<L><PB N="131" REF="154"/>
For she quite vex'd, he thought, rose up at last,</L>
<L>And cry'd, "Sir Critic, you condemn too fast;</L>
<L>"For know that I'm a judge, and sure can tell,</L>
<L>"That he's the very thing for young Barn∣well;</L>
<L>"Behold his figure, action, voice and mien,</L>
<L>"God! was there ever such a Barnwell seen;</L>
<L>"By Heavens for the lad I'm all on fire,</L>
<L>"For his success my heart glows with de∣fire;</L>
<L>"Then t' oblige me, Critic, I prithee stop,</L>
<L>"And o'er your censures let the curtain drop."</L>
<L>On these imagin'd things the youth relies,</L>
<L>And your indulgence in this enterprize;</L>
<L>And he his utmost efforts means to try,</L>
<L>For reasons many,—and I'll tell you why,</L>
<L>First, then, your praises, which he hopes t' obtain;</L>
<L>Secondly for honor, if he's not too vain;</L>
<L>And lastly, for pleasure, and some little gain.</L>
