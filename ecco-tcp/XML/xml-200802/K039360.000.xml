<HEAD>TO His Royal Highness WILLIAM, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Royal Highness,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I presumed to solicit the honour of laying the subsequent trifle at your Royal Highness's feet; it was not without a thorough con∣sciousness of the little value of the offering I was going to make; but I considered, mean as it was, it would serve as a testi∣mony of my devotion; and to a Prince happy in a love of the arts, nothing could be unacceptable, which bore the remotest analogy to them.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="3"/>How far the Comic Opera, under proper regulations, has a right to be acknowledg∣ed for a junior offspring of the Drama, and as such become candidate for a share of public encouragement, I shall not pre∣tend to determine; but if it can be ren∣dered an agreeable amusement, the English Theatre has never scrupled to adopt, what was capable of pleasing there; and though as a work of genius, it is by no means to be set in competition with good Tragedies and Comedies, it may, I apprehend, be permitted as an occasional relief to them, without bringing either our taste or un∣derstanding into question.</P>
<P>I need not inform your Royal Highness, that in France, where the stage has been cultivated with more care, and success, than in any other country; this species of entertainment is received with very great applause; nor is it thought any injury to Corneille, and Moliere, that the pieces of Anseaume and Favart, meet with success.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="4"/>It is true, among the French, Comic Operas have very often the advantage of being extremely well written; of which, On ne S'avise jamais de tout, Le Roy, et le Fermier, and some others are an in∣stance; nor would the best composition of the greatest master, make a very con∣temptible poem pass on an audience: I wish I could assert with truth, that in this respect, we fall nothing behind our neigh∣bours, and that what I here present to your Royal Highness, might lay claim to some degree of merit, even in the writ∣ing: but though I cannot do this, permit me to say, I have attempted to render it a little interesting, and not wholly undivert∣ing, as far as the music, my principal care, would give me leave.</P>
<P>But I humbly beg your Royal High∣ness's pardon; in applying to the con∣noisseur, I forget that I am at the same time addressing a Great Prince: indeed, there is a subject, on which I could dwell with the truest pleasure; but I
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
am too well instructed in your Royal Highness's character, to dare to offend you, with a language, which forms and custom, too often impose upon princes, a necessity of hearing; I mean their own praise; to those who are most deserving, ever least welcome.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I, therefore, subscribe myself, With the profoundest respect, May it please your Royal Highness, Your Royal Highness's, Most obedient, Most devoted, and Most humble servant, THE AUTHOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is scarce a language in Europe, in which there is not a play taken from our romance of Pamela; in Italian and French, particularly, several writers of the first eminence, have chosen it for the subject of different dramas.</P>
<P>The little piece now ventured into the world, owes its origin to the same source, not only the general subject is drawn from Pamela, but almost every circumstance in it. The reader will immediately recollect —the courtship of Parson Williams—the Squire's jealousy and behaviour in conse∣quence of it, and the difficulty he had to prevail with himself to marry the girl, notwithstanding his passion for her—the miller is a close copy of Goodman An∣drews
<PB N="ii" REF="7"/>
—Ralph is imagined, from the wild son which he is mentioned to have had— Theodosia, from the young lady of quality, with whom Mr. B. through his sister's persuasion, is said to have been in treaty before his marriage with Pamela—even the gipsies, are borrowed from a trifling incident in the latter part of the work.</P>
<P>In prosecuting this plan, which he has varied from the original, as far as he thought convenient, the author has made simplicity his principal aim. His scenes, on account of the music, which could not be perfect without such a mixture, neces∣sarily consist of serious and buffoon. He knows grossness and insipidity lay in his way; whether he has had art enough to avoid stumbling upon them, the candid Public is left to determine.</P>

<P>Well done, well done, 'tis a sure sign work goes on merrily when folks sing at it. Stop the mill there; and dost hear, son Ralph! hoist yon sacks of

flour upon this cart lad, and drive it up to lord Aim∣worth's; coming from London last night with strange company, no doubt there are calls enough for it by this time.</P>

<P>Ay Feyther, whether or not; there's no fear but you'll find enow for a body to do.</P>
</SP>

<P>What dost mutter? is't not a strange plague that thou can'st never go about any thing with a good will; murrain take it what's come o'er the boy? so then thou wilt not set a hand to what I have de∣sired thee?</P>

<SPEAKER>Ral.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why don't you speak to Suster Pat to do something then? I thought when she come home to us after my old lady's death, she was to have been of some use in the house; but instead of that, she sits there all day, reading outlandish books, dressed like a fine madumasel, and the never a word you says to she.</P>

<P>Sirrah don't speak so disrespectfully of thy sister; thou will't ne'er have the tyth of her deserts.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Ral.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I'll read and write with her for what she dares; and as for playing on the hapsicols, I thinks her rich good mother might have learn'd her something more properer, seeing she did not remember to leave her a legacy at last.</P>

<P>Yes, a gentleman that's come piping hot from London: he is below at the Cat and Bagpipes; I cod he rides a choice bit of a nag; I dares to say she'd fetch as good as forty pound at ever a fair in all England.</P>

<P>A figgs end for what she'd fetch; mind thy business, or by the lord Harry—</P>

<P>Thou wilt not—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ral.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why no I won't, so what argufies your putting yourself in a passion, Feyther; I've promis'd to go back to the gentleman; and I don't know but what he's a lord too, and mayhap he may do more for me than you thinks of.</P>

<P>Dear heart, dear heart! I protest this ungra∣cious boy puts me quite beside myself. Patty my dear, come down into the yard a little, and keep me com∣pany—and you thieves, vagabonds, gipsies, out here, 'tis you debauch my son.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fairf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Patty, Master Goodman my lord's steward has been with me just now, and I find we are like to have great doings, his lordship has brought down sir Harry Sycamore, and his family; and there is more company expected in a few days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know sir Harry very well, he is by marriage a distant relation of my lord's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fairf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what sort of a young body is the daugh∣ter there? I think she us'd to be with you at the castle, three or four summers ago, when my young lord was out upon his travels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh very often, she was a great favourite of my lady's; pray father is she come down?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fairf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you know the report last night, about my lord's going to be married; by what I can learn she is, and there is likely to be a nearer relationship be∣tween
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
the families, e're long. It seems, his lordship was not over willing for the match, but the friends on both sides in London pressed it so hard: then there's a swinging fortune, master Goodman tells me, a matter of twenty or thirty thousand pounds!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it was a million, father, it would not be more than my lord Aimworth deserves; I suppose the wedding will be celebrated here, at the mansion-house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fairf.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is thought, as soon as things can be properly prepared—And now, Patty, if I could but see thee a little merry—Come, bless thee, pluck up thy spirits—To be sure thou has sustained, in the death of thy lady, a heavy loss; she was a parent to thee, nay, and better, inasmuch as she took thee when thou wert but a babe, and gave thee an education which thy na∣tural parents could not afford to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! dear father, don't mention, what per∣haps, has been my greatest misfortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fairf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay then, Patty, what's become of all thy sense, that people talk so much about? —But I have something to say to thee which I would have thee con∣sider seriously.—I believe I need not tell thee, my child, that a young maiden, after she is marriageable, especially if she has any thing about her to draw people's notice, is liable to ill tongues, and a many cross accidents; so that the sooner she is out of harm's way the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly, father, there are people enough who watch every opportunity to gratify their own ma∣lice; but when a young woman's conduct is un∣blameable—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fairf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Patty, there may be something in that; but you know slander will leave spots where malice finds none: I say, then, a young woman's best safeguard is a good husband. Now there is our neigh∣bour, farmer Giles; he is a sober, honest, industrious young fellow, and one of the wealthiest in these parts; he is greatly taken with thee; and it is not the first time I have told thee I should be glad to have him for a son-in-law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I have told you as often, father, I would submit myself entirely to your direction; whatever you think proper for me, is so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fairf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's spoken like a dutiful, sensible girl; get thee in, then, and leave me to manage it— Perhaps our neighbour Giles is not a gentleman; but what are the greatest part of our country gentlemen good for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, father. The sentiments, indeed, have frequently little correspondence with the condi∣tion; and it is according to them alone we ought to regulate our esteem.</P>

<P>Well, master Fairfield, you and Miss Pat have had a long discourse together; did you tell her that I was come down?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fairf.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, in truth, friend Giles, I did not even tell her I had sent for thee, but I mentioned our affair at a distance; and I think there is no fear but what it will go as agreeably, of her side, as we could wish.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fairf.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I promise thee my daughter will make thee a choice wife.—But there is one thing to be considered.—Thou know'st, friend Giles, that I, and all belongs to me, have great obligations to lord Aimworth's family; Patty, in particular, would be one of the most ungrateful wretches this day breathing, if she was to do the smallest thing contrary to their con∣sent and approbation.—I need not tell thee what she owes them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Giles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, 'tis well enough known to all the country, she was the old lady's darling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fairf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, master Giles, I'll assure thee she is not one whit less obliged to my lord himself.—When his mother was taken off so suddenly, and his affairs called him up to London, if Patty would have re∣mained at the castle, she might have had the command of all; or if she would have gone any where else, he would have paid for her fixing, let the cost be what it would.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Giles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, for that matter, folks did not spare to say, that my lord had a kind of a sneaking kindness for her himself: and I remember, at one time, it was rise all about the neighbourhood, that she was actually to be our lady.</P>

Alas! who could live in the house with lord Aimworth, see him, converse with him, and not love him? I have this consolation how∣ever, my folly is yet undiscover'd to any; else, how should I be ridiculed and despised; nay would not my lord himself despise me, especially, if he knew that I have more than once construed his natural affability and politeness, into sentiments as unworthy of him, as mine are bold and extravagant. Unexampled va∣nity! did I possess any thing capable of attracting such a notice, to what purpose could a man of his distinc∣tion cast his eyes on a girl, poor, meanly born; and indebted for every thing to the ill-placed bounty of his family.</P>

<P>Well but Theodosia, child, you are quite unreasonable.</P>

<P>Pardon me papa, it is not I am unreasonable; when I gave way to my inclinations for Mr. Mervin, he did not seem less agreeable to you and my mama, than he was acceptable to me. It is therefore you have been unreasonable; in first encouraging his addresses, and afterwards forbidding him your house, in order to bring me down here, to force me on a gentleman—</P>

<P>Force you Dossy, what do you mean? by the la! I would not force you on the Czar of Muscovy.</P>

<P>And yet papa, what else can I call it? for though lord Aimworth is extremely attentive, and ob∣liging, I assure you he is by no means one of the most ardent of lovers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ardent, ah! there it is; you girls never think there is any love, without kissing and hug∣ging; but you shou'd consider child, my lord Aim∣worth is a polite man; and has been abroad in France and Italy, where these things are not the fashion; I remember when I was on my travels, among the ma∣dames, and signoras, we never saluted more than the tip of the ear.</P>

<P>Well come, my poor Dossy, I see you are chagrin'd, but you know it is not my fault; on the contrary I assure you, I had always a great regard for young Mervin, and should have been very glad—</P>

<P>Ay, but hold Dossy, your mama convinced me that he was not so proper a son-in-law for us as lord Aimworth.</P>

<P>Well, but Dossy, don't you see how your mama loves me; if my finger does but ach, she's like a bewitched woman; and if I was to die, I don't be∣lieve she wou'd outlive the burying of me: nay she has told me as much herself.</P>

To what does the pride of condition and the cen∣sure of the world force me! Must I then renounce the only person that can make me happy; because, be∣cause what? because she's a miller's daughter. Vain pride and unjust censure: has she not all the graces that education can give her sex, improved by a genius seldom found among the highest? Has she not modesty, sweetness of temper, and beauty of person, capable of adorning a rank the most exalted? But it is too late to think of these things now; my hand is promised, my honour engaged; and if it was not so, she has engaged herself, the farmer is a person to her mind, and I have authorised their union by my approbation.</P>

<P>Oh! as for that sir, I don't look for any thing; I can easily get you a bundle of their rags; but I don't know whether you'll prevail on them to go up to my lord's, because they're afraid of a big dog that's in the yard; but I'll tell you what I can do, I can go up be∣fore you and have the dog fastened, for I know his ken∣nel.</P>

<P>IN how contemptible a light would the situation I am now in, shew me to most of the fine men of the present age? in love with a country girl, rivaled by a poor fellow, one of my meanest tenants, and uneasy at it; if I had a mind to her, I know they would tell me, I ought to have taken care to make myself easy long ago, when I had her in my power. But I have the testimony of my own heart in my favour; and I think was it to do again, I should act as I have done. Let's see what have we here? perhaps a book may com∣pose my thoughts;

<P>Patty Fairfield!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I humbly beg pardon my lord, for pressing so abruptly into your presence; but I was told I might walk this way; and I am come by my father's commands, to thank your lordship for all your favours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Favours Patty! what favours? I have done you none; but why this metamorphosis? I protest if you had not spoke, I should not have known you; I never saw you wear such cloaths as these in my mother's life time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>No my lord, it was her ladyship's pleasure I should wear better, and therefore I obey'd; but it is now my duty to dress in a manner more suitable to my station, and future prospects in life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid Patty you are too humble— come sit down—nay I will have it so—what is it I have been told to day Patty, it seems you are going to be married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and don't you think you could have made a better choice than farmer Giles? I should ima∣gine your person, your accomplishments, might have intitled you to look higher.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your lordship is pleased to over-rate my little merit; the education I received in your family, does not intitle me to forget my origin; and the farmer is my equal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what respect? the degrees of rank and fortune, my dear Patty, are arbitrary distinctions, unwor∣thy the regard of those who consider justly; the true
<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
standard of equality is seated in the mind; those who think nobly are noble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>The farmer my lord, is a very honest man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>So he may, I don't suppose he would break into a house, or commit a robbery on the highway; what do you tell me of his honesty for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not mean to offend your lordship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Offend! I am not offended Patty, not at all offended—but is there any great merit in a man's being honest?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't say there is, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>The farmer is an ill bred illiterate booby, and what happiness can you propose to yourself in such a society. Then as to his person I am sure—But perhaps Patty you like him, and if so I am doing a wrong thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, my lord—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay I see you do, he has had the good for∣tune to please you, and in that case you are certainly in the right to follow your inclinations—I must tell you one thing Patty, however—I hope you won't think it unfriendly of me—But I am determined farmer Giles shall not stay a moment on my estate, after next quarter day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope my lord, he has not incurred your displeasure—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's of no signification—Could I find as many good qualities in him as you do, perhaps—but 'tis enough, he's a fellow I don't like; and as you have a regard for him, I would have you advise him to provide himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord I am very unfortunate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>She loves him 'tis plain—Come Patty, don't cry, I would not willingly do any thing to make you uneasy—Have you seen Miss Sycamore yet? I suppose you know she and I are going to be married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I hear my lord; Heaven make you both happy.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rise Patty, rise; say no more—I sup∣pose you'll wait upon Miss Sycamore before you go away—at present I have a little business—as I said, Patty, don't afflict yourself, I have been some∣what hasty with regard to the farmer, but since I see how deeply you are interested in his affairs, I may, possibly, alter my designs with regard to him—You know—you know Patty, your marriage with him is no concern of mine—I only speak—</P>

<P>Oh infinite, infinite! to see the chearful healthy looking creatures, toil with such a good will, to me there were more genuine charms, in their awk∣ward stumping and jumping about; their rude mea∣sures, and homespun finery; than in all the dress, splendor, and studied graces, of a birth-night ball∣room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a very uncommon declaration to be made by a fine lady, Madam; but certainly, however the artful delicacies of high life may dazzle and surprise, nature has particular attractions, even in a cottage, her most

<P>Why my lord, I thought we had pretty well ordered all things concerning this marriage, but all on a sudden, the girl has taken it into her head, not to have the farmer, and declares she will never marry at all—but I know my lord, she'll pay great respect to any thing you say; and if you'll but lay your com∣mands on her to marry him, I am sure she'll do it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet another conflict! well, 'tis the last, and I must go through it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I came hither, Patty, in consequence of our conversation this morning, to render your change of state as agreeable and happy as I could; but your father tells me, you have fallen out with the farmer; has any thing happened since I saw you last, to alter your good opinion of him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>No my lord, I am in the same opinion with regard to the farmer now, that I always was.</P>

<P>I thought, Patty, you loved him, you told me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, no matter—It seems I have been mis∣taken in that particular—Possibly your affections are engaged elsewhere; let me but know the man that can make you happy, and I swear—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my lord, you take too much trouble upon my account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps Patty, you love somebody so much beneath you, you are ashamed to own it; but your esteem confers a value wheresoever it is placed—I was too harsh with you this morning; our inclinations are not in our own power; they master the wisest of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, pray my lord, talk not to me in this stile; consider me as one destined by birth and fortune to the meanest condition and offices; who has unhap∣pily been too apt to imbibe sentiments contrary to them; let me conquer a heart where pride and vanity have usurped an improper rule, and learn to know my∣self, of whom I have been too long ignorant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, Patty, you love some one so much above you, you are afraid to own it.—If so, be his rank what it will, he is to be envied; for the love of a woman of virtue, beauty, and sentiment, does
<PB N="49" REF="58"/>
honour to a monarch — What means that downcast look, those tears, those blushes? Dare you not confide in me—Do you think Patty, you have a friend in the world would sympathize with you more sincerely than I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>What shall I answer? No my lord, you have ever treated me with a kindness, a generosity of which none but minds like your's are capable; you have been my instructor, my adviser; my protector: but, my lord, you have been too good; when our superiors for∣get the distance between us, we are sometimes led to forget it too; had you been less condescending, per∣haps I had been happier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have I, Patty, have I made you un∣happy; I, who would sacrifice my own felicity to secure yours?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg my lord, you will suffer me to be gone; only believe me sensible of all your favours, tho' un∣worthy of the smallest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>How unworthy! you merit every thing, my respect, my esteem, my friendship, and my love! yes I repeat, I avow it; your beauty, your modesty, your understanding, has made a conquest of my heart; but what a world do we live in? that while I own this, while I own a passion for you, founded on the justest, the noblest basis; I must at the same time con∣fess, the fear of that world, its taunts, its reproaches—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah Sir, think better of the creature you have raised, than to suppose I ever entertained a hope tending to your dishonour: would that be a return for the favours I have received? would that be a grateful reverence for the memory of her—pity and pardon the disturbance of a mind that fears to enquire too minutely into its own sensations—I am unfor∣tunate my lord, but not criminal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Patty, we are both unfortunate; for my own part, I know not what to say to you, or what to propose to myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then my lord, 'tis mine to act as I ought: yet while I am honoured with a place in your esteem,
<PB N="50" REF="59"/>
imagine me not insensible of so high a distinction, or capable of lightly turning my thoughts towards ano∣ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>How cruel is my situation! I am here Patty, to command you to marry the man who has given us so much uneasiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, I am convinced it is for your credit and my safety, it should be so; I hope I have not so ill profited by the lessons of your noble mother, but I shall be able to do my duty wherever I am call'd to it; this will be my first support, time and reflection will compleat the work.</P>

<P>A Wretch, a vile inconsiderate wretch, com∣ing of such a race as mine, and having an example like me before her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg madam you will not disquiet yourself; you are told here, that a gentleman lately arrived from London, has been about the place to-day; that he has disguis'd himself like a gipsey, came hither, and had some conversation with your daughter; you are even told, that there is a design formed for their going off to∣ther; but possibly there may be some mistake in all this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; but my lord the lad tells us the gen∣tleman's name; we have seen the gipsies and we know she has had a hankering—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Syc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Harry my dear, why will you put in your word, when you hear others speaking—I protest my lord I'm in such confusion, I know not what to say, I can hardly support myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>This gentleman it seems is at a little inn at the bottom of the hill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir. Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish it was possible to have a file of mus∣queteers my lord; I could head them myself, being in the militia, and we would go and seize him directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Softly my dear sir; let us proceed with a little less violence in this matter, I beseech you. We
<PB N="54" REF="63"/>
should first see the young lady—Where is Miss Sy∣camore, madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Syc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really my lord I don't know; I saw her go into the garden about a quarter of an hour ago, from our chamber window.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Into the garden! perhaps she has got an inkling of our being informed of this affair; and is gone to throw herself into the pond. Despair, my lord, makes girls do terrible things. 'Twas but the Wed∣nesday before we left London, that I saw, taken out of Rosamond's pond in Saint James's Park, as likely a young woman as ever you would desire to set your eyes on; in a new calamancoe petticoat, and a pair of silver buckles in her shoes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope there is no danger of any such fatal accident happening at present: but will you oblige me, sir Harry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely my lord—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you commit the whole direction of this affair to my prudence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, you hear what his lordship says.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Syc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed my lord I am so much asham'd, I don't know what to answer; the fault of my daugh∣ter—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't mention it, madam; the fault has been mine; who have been innocently the occasion of a young lady's transgressing a point of duty and deco∣rum, which, otherwise, she would never have violated. But if you, and sir Harry, will walk in and repose yourselves, I hope to settle every thing to the general satisfaction—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Syc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come in sir Harry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure my good friend, had I known that I was doing a violence to Miss Sycamore's inclinations, in the happiness I proposed to myself—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord 'tis all a case.—My grandfather by the mother's side, was a very sensible man—he was elected knight of the shire, in five successive parliaments; and died high sheriff of his county—a man of fine parts, fine talents, and the curioest docker of horses in all

England, but that he did only now and then, for his amusement) And he used to say, my lord, that the female sex were good for nothing but to bring forth children, and breed disturbance.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>The ladies were very little oblig'd to your ancestor, sir Harry; but for my part, I have a more favourable opinion—</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay—why what's the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fairf.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know my lord; it seems your gene∣rosity to my poor girl, has been noised about the neigh∣bourhood; and some evil minded people have put it into the young man's head, that was to marry her, that you would never have made her a present so much above her deserts, and expectations, if it had not been upon some naughty account: now my lord, I am a poor man, 'tis true, and a mean one; but I and my father, and my father's father, have liv'd tenants upon your lord∣ship's estate, where we have always been known for honest men; and it shall never be said, that Fairfield, the miller, became rich in his old days, by the wages of his child's shame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, master Fairfield, do you be∣lieve—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fairf.</SPEAKER>
<P>No my lord, no, Heaven forbid; but when I consider the sum, it is too much for us; it is indeed my lord, and enough to make bad folks talk: besides, my poor girl is greatly alter'd; she us'd to be the life of every place she came into; but since her being at home, I have seen nothing from her, but sadness and watry eyes.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="57" REF="66"/>
<SPEAKER>Fairf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes my lord, he does indeed; and has made a wicked noise, and used us in a very base manner: I did not think farmer Giles would have been so ready to believe such a thing of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well master Fairfield, I will not press on you a donation, the rejection of which does you so much credit; you may take my word, however, that your fears upon this occasion are entirely groundless; but this is not enough, as I have been the means of losing your daughter one husband, it is but just I should get her another; and, since the farmer is so scrupulous, there is a young man in the house here, whom I have some influence over, and I dare say, he will be less squeamish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fairf.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure my lord, you have in all honest ways, a right to dispose of me and mine, as you think proper.</P>

I'll be shot if it bean't little Bob. —Icod, I'll take the way to the castle, as well as the rest; for I'd fain see how the nail do drive. It is well I had wit enough to discern things, and a friend to advise with, or else she would have fallen to my lot —but I have got a surfeit of going a courting, and burn me, if I won't live a batchelor; for, when all comes to all, I see nothing but ill blood and quarrels, among folk, when they be married.</P>

<P>I know very well the ridicule that may be thrown on a lord's marrying a miller's daughter; and I own with blushes, it has for some time had too great weight with me; but we should marry to please our∣selves, not other people: and on mature consideration, I can see no reproach justly merited, by raising a deserv∣ing woman to a station she is capable of adorning, let her birth be what it will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why 'tis very true my lord: I once knew a gentleman that married his cook maid; he was a relation of my own—you remember fat Margery, my lady! She was a very good sort of a woman, in∣deed she was, and made the best suet dumplings that ever I tasted.</P>

<P>One of them I suppose is, that I, a peer, should be obliged to call this good old miller, father-in-law; but where's the shame in that? he is as good as any lord, in being a man; and if we dare suppose a lord that is not an honest man, he is, in my opinion, the more respectable character.

<L>Yield who will, to forms a martyr,</L>
<L>While unaw'd by idle shame;</L>
<L>Pride for happiness, I barter,</L>
<L>Heedless of the millions blame.</L>
<L>Thus with love, my arms I quarter:</L>
<L>Women graced in nature's frame;</L>
<L>Ev'ry privilege by charter,</L>
<L>Have a right from man to claim.</L>

<L>So long storms and tempests raging,</L>
<L>When the blust'ring fury dies;</L>
<L>Ah how lovely, how engaging,</L>
<L>Prospects fair, and cloudless skies.</L>
