<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following productions have already experienced so much indulgence from the Public, that in sending them thus collected into the world, I should feel, perhaps, more of confidence than apprehension, were I not perfectly convinced that temporary favour is no decisive proof of real de∣sert.</P>
<P>Whatever the future fate of these performances may be, I am aware that it must depend upon themselves alone; and I shall not trouble my reader with
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
any vain attempt to enhance their merits, or palliate their defects.</P>
<P>Yet concerning one class of poems in the collection, it may be proper to say a few words, as some critics have expected to find in them much more than their author intended—I mean the essays on different arts. In these it was by no means my design to as∣sume the office of a legislator; not only from a just diffidence in my own power of framing such laws, but from a persuasion that in poetry they seldom prove either pleasing or useful.</P>
<P>It may be said, I believe, of all di∣dactic poems, that the parts of them which do not pretend to teach, are the most productive of pleasure, and per∣haps of utility.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
Paradoxical as this may appear, I am convinced, that in compositions relating to the fine arts it is strictly true. A collection of precepts, tho' expressed in the most elegant verse, can never make either a Painter or a Poet; whose productions, to use the words of a great historian, would ex∣cite less admiration, if they could be created by the lessons of a preceptor.</P>
<P>Rules of art are in general so trite or fallacious, that they rather tend to tire and mislead than to animate and direct.—Let us consider, for instance, the Art of Poetry by Boileau, which is justly said to be superior to its ri∣vals.—If we examine the mere pre∣cepts contained in this admirable Poem, some of them are such as a
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
Poet would certainly be neglected for observing, and others only such as must occur to every writer of a sound understanding.—They are indeed em∣bellished with all the graces of for∣cible and highly-polished expression; yet surely the most engaging and use∣ful parts of this celebrated work, are its lively images and characters; which, by animating the composition, in∣spire an enthusiastic esteem for the art and its professors.</P>
<P>Concerning the real use of rules, opinions have been very different.—Some have even imputed the decline of art to the accumulation of pre∣cepts; while others have thought so highly of their power, as to imagine that no one can produce a good Poem,
<PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>
without being acquainted with the Poetics of Aristotle; which is, in truth, like imagining that no one can be∣come a parent without perusing a trea∣tise of anatomy.</P>
<P>Tho' I confess myself inclined to doubt the efficacy of precepts towards forming a great artist of any kind, I am far from intending to condemn the poems, that have appeared on a preceptive plan.—Many of these are written in a manner so sprightly, and with such an elegant felicity of ex∣pression, that if they do not afford to young students that new and solid in∣struction which they profess to de∣liver, they are at least highly pleasing; and certainly very serviceable to that more numerous class of readers, the critics and connoisseurs.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>
It was, however, my wish to render my own Poems, on different arts, more <HI>historical</HI> than <HI>preceptive.</HI></P>
<P>My principal design was to pre∣sent a general view of the art in ques∣tion, with a just and animating cha∣racter of its most eminent professors. There is, I believe, a season of life, in which Poems of this nature may be read with the happiest effect.—The first, and perhaps the most important step towards forming a great Artist in any line, is to inspire a youth of quick feelings with an enthusiastic passion for some particular art, and with an ingenuous delight, in the glory of its Heroes.</P>
<P>Such was the end that I proposed to myself in these essays; for, as de∣licate
<PB N="xv" REF="14"/>
or inconstant health, and the love of literary retirement, have pre∣vented me from serving the commu∣nity in scenes of active life, I have considered it as particularly incum∣bent on me to endeavour at least, in my poetical pursuits, to promote the interest of society.</P>
<P>I am aware that such an idea is open to much raillery, as vain and romantic; but Poetry is an art, which conduces so little to the private emo∣lument and advantage of those who devote even a life to it, that they ought, I think, to be indulged in such prospects, however chimerical, as arise only from a benevolent vanity.</P>
<P>In closing this Preface, it may be proper to say, that the collection con∣tains
<PB N="xvi" REF="15"/>
nothing which has not appeared before, except an Ode to that elegant and instructive female author the Countess of Genlis, with a few short and occasional compositions, inserted at the end of the first volume.</P>

<HEAD>EPISTLE I.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BLEST be the hour, when fav'ring gales restore</L>
<L>The travell'd Artist to his native shore!</L>
<L>His mind enlighten'd, and his fancy fraught</L>
<L>With finest forms by ancient genius wrought;</L>
<L N="5">Whose magic beauty charm'd, with spell sublime,</L>
<L>The scythe of Ruin from the hand of Time,</L>
<L>And mov'd the mighty leveller to spare</L>
<L>Models of grace so exquisitely fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While you, whom Painting thus inspir'd to roam,</L>
<L N="10">Bring these rich stores of ripen'd judgment home;</L>
<L>While now, attending my accomplish'd friend,</L>
<L>Science and Taste his soften'd colours blend;</L>
<L>Let the fond Muse, tho' with a transient view,</L>
<L>The progress of her sister art pursue;</L>
<L N="15"><PB N="4" REF="19"/>Eager in tracing from remotest time</L>
<L>The steps of Painting through each favour'd clime,</L>
<L>To praise her dearest sons, whose daring aim</L>
<L>Gain'd their bright stations on the heights of fame,</L>
<L>And mark the paths by which her partial hand</L>
<L N="20">Conducts her ROMNEY to this radiant band.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Painting, sweet Nymph! now leaves in lifeless trance</L>
<L>Exhausted Italy and tinfel France,</L>
<L>And sees in Britain, with exulting eyes,</L>
<L>Her vot'ries prosper, and her glories rise.</L>
<L N="25">Yet tho', my friend, thy art is thus carest,</L>
<L>And with the homage of the public blest,</L>
<L>And flourishes with growing beauty fair,</L>
<L>The child of Majesty's adoptive care,</L>
<L>The youthful artist still is doom'd to feel</L>
<L N="30">Obstruction's chilling hand, that damps his zeal:</L>
<L>Th' imperious voice of Vanity and Pride</L>
<L>Bids him from Fancy's region turn aside,</L>
<L>And quit the magic of her scene, to trace</L>
<L>The vacant lines of some unmeaning face:</L>
<L N="35">E'en in this work his wishes still are crost,</L>
<L>And all the efforts of his art are lost;</L>
<L>For when the canvas, with the mirror's truth,</L>
<L>Reflects the perfect form of age or youth,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="20"/>
The fond affections of the partial mind</L>
<L N="40">The eye of judgment with delusion blind:</L>
<L>Each mother bids him brighter tints employ,</L>
<L>And give new spirit to her booby boy;</L>
<L>Nor can the painter, with his utmost art,</L>
<L>Express the image in the lover's heart:</L>
<L N="45">Unconscious of the change the seasons bring,</L>
<L>Autumnal beauty asks the rose of spring,</L>
<L>And vain self-love, in every age the same,</L>
<L>Will fondly urge some visionary claim.</L>
<L>The luckless painter, destin'd to submit,</L>
<L N="50">Mourns the lost likeness which he once had hit,</L>
<L>And, doom'd to groundless censure, bears alone</L>
<L>The grievous load of errors not his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor is it Pride, or Folly's vain command,</L>
<L>That only fetters his creative hand;</L>
<L N="55">At Fashion's nod he copies as they pass</L>
<L>Each quaint reflection from her crowded glass.</L>
<L>The formal coat, with intersecting line,</L>
<L>Mars the free graces of his fair design;</L>
<L>The towering cap he marks with like distress,</L>
<L N="60">And all the motley mass of female dress.</L>
<L>The hoop extended with enormous size,</L>
<L>The corks that like a promontory rise;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="21"/>
The stays of deadly steel, in whose embrace</L>
<L>The tyrant Fashion tortures injur'd Grace.</L>
<L N="65">But Art, despairing over shapes like these</L>
<L>To cast an air of elegance and ease,</L>
<L>Invokes kind Fancy's aid—she comes to spread</L>
<L>Her magic spells—the Gothic forms are fled;</L>
<L>And see, to crown the painter's just desire,</L>
<L N="70">Her free positions, and her light attire!</L>
<L>Th' ambitious artist wishes to pursue</L>
<L>This brilliant plan with more extensive view,</L>
<L>And with adopted character to give</L>
<L>A lasting charm to make the portrait live;</L>
<L N="75">All points of art by one nice effort gain,</L>
<L>Delight the learned, and content the vain;</L>
<L>Make history to life new value lend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 77. See NOTE 1.</NOTE>,</L>
<L>And in the comprehensive picture blend</L>
<L>The ancient hero with the living friend.</L>
<L N="80">Most fair device! "but, ah! what foes to sense,</L>
<L>What broods of motley monsters rise from hence!"</L>
<L>The strange pretensions of each age and sex</L>
<L>These plans of fancy and of taste perplex;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="22"/>
For male and female, to themselves unknown,</L>
<L N="85">Demand a character unlike their own,</L>
<L>Till oft the painter to this quaint distress</L>
<L>Prefers the awkward shapes of common dress.</L>
<L>Sweet girls, of mild and pensive softness, choose</L>
<L>The sportive emblems of the comic Muse;</L>
<L N="90">And sprightly damsels are inclin'd to borrow</L>
<L>The garb of penitence, and tears of sorrow:</L>
<L>While awkward pride, tho' safe from war's alarms,</L>
<L>Round his plump body buckles ancient arms,</L>
<L>And, from an honest justice of the peace,</L>
<L N="95">Starts up at once a demi-god of Greece;</L>
<L>Too firm of heart by ridicule to fall,</L>
<L>The finish'd hero crowns his country hall,</L>
<L>Ordain'd to fill, if fire his glory spare,</L>
<L>The lumber-garret of his wiser heir.</L>
<L N="100">Not less absurd to flatter NERO's eyes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 100. See NOTE II.</NOTE></L>
<L>Arose the portrait of colossal size:</L>
<L>Twice fifty feet th' enormous sheet was spread,</L>
<L>To lift o'er gazing slaves the monster's head,</L>
<L>When impious Folly sway'd Oppression's rod,</L>
<L N="105">And servile Rome ador'd the mimic God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="23"/>
<L>Think not, my friend, with supercilious air,</L>
<L>I rank the portrait as beneath thy care.</L>
<L>Blest be the pencil! which from death can save<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 108. See NOTE III.</NOTE></L>
<L>The semblance of the virtuous, wise, and brave;</L>
<L N="110">That youth and emulation still may gaze</L>
<L>On those inspiring forms of ancient days,</L>
<L>And, from the force of bright example bold,</L>
<L>Rival their worth, "and be what they behold."</L>
<L>Blest be the pencil! whose consoling pow'r,</L>
<L N="115">Soothing soft Friendship in her pensive hour,</L>
<L>Dispels the cloud, with melancholy fraught,</L>
<L>That absence throws upon her tender thought.</L>
<L>Blest be the pencil! whose enchantment gives</L>
<L>To wounded Love the food on which he lives.</L>
<L N="120">Rich in this gift, tho' cruel ocean bear</L>
<L>The youth to exile from his faithful fair,</L>
<L>He in fond dreams hangs o'er her glowing cheek,</L>
<L>Still owns her present, and still hears her speak;</L>
<L>Oh! LOVE, it was thy glory to impart</L>
<L N="125">Its infant being to this magic art!</L>
<L>Inspir'd by thee, the soft Corinthian maid<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ver. 126. See NOTE IV.</NOTE></L>
<L>Her graceful lover's sleeping form portray'd:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="24"/>
Her boding heart his near departure knew,</L>
<L>Yet long'd to keep his image in her view:</L>
<L N="130">Pleas'd she beheld the steady shadow fall,</L>
<L>By the clear lamp upon the even wall:</L>
<L>The line she trac'd with fond precision true,</L>
<L>And, drawing, doated on the form she drew;</L>
<L>Nor, as she glow'd with no forbidden fire,</L>
<L N="135">Conceal'd the simple picture from her sire:</L>
<L>His kindred fancy, still to nature just,</L>
<L>Copied her line, and form'd the mimic bust.</L>
<L>Thus from thy power, inspiring LOVE, we trace</L>
<L>The modell'd image, and the pencil'd face!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="140">We pity Genius, when, by interest led,</L>
<L>His toils but reach the semblance of a head;</L>
<L>Yet are those censures too severe and vain,</L>
<L>That scorn the Portrait as the Painter's bane.</L>
<L>Tho' up the mountain winds the arduous road</L>
<L N="145">That leads to pure Perfection's bright abode,</L>
<L>In humbler walks some tempting laurels grow,</L>
<L>Some flowers are gather'd in the vale below:</L>
<L>Youth on the plain collects increasing force,</L>
<L>To climb the steep in his meridian course.</L>
<L N="150">While Nature sees her living models share</L>
<L>The rising artist's unremitting care,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="25"/>
She on his mind her every charm imprints,</L>
<L>Her easy postures, and her perfect tints,</L>
<L>Till his quick pencil, in maturer hour,</L>
<L N="155">Becomes her rival in creative power.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet in these paths disdain a long delay,</L>
<L>While eager Genius points a nobler way:</L>
<L>For see! expanding to thy raptur'd gaze,</L>
<L>The epic field a brighter scene displays!</L>
<L N="160">Here stands the temple, where, to merit true,</L>
<L>Fame gives her laurel to the favour'd few:</L>
<L>Whose minds, illumin'd with coelestial fire,</L>
<L>Direct the pencil, or awake the lyre;</L>
<L>Who trace the springs of nature to their source,</L>
<L N="165">And by her guidance, with resistless force,</L>
<L>The tides of error and of transport roll</L>
<L>Thro' every channel of the human soul!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How few, my friend, tho' millions boast the aim,</L>
<L>Leave in this temple an unclouded name!</L>
<L N="170">Vain the attempt, in every age and clime,</L>
<L>Without the slow conductors toil and time;</L>
<L>Without that secret, soul-impelling power,</L>
<L>Infus'd by genius in the natal hour;</L>
<L>And vain with these, if bright occasion's ray</L>

<L N="190">First taught by thee, the Grecian pencil wrought</L>

But as the beauties and advantages of this plan struck forcibly on the imagination of this amiable Author, the infinite difficulties attend∣ing its execution were likewise fully open to his discernment. The success must depend on the choice of subject: where that is not very happily adapted, the picture will probably contain some most ridiculous absurdities—Perhaps the Reader may recollect an unfortunate instance or two of this kind.</P>

<P>The sweet illusion of this enchanting art is prettily expressed in a Letter of Raphael's to his friend Francesco, Raifolini, a Bolognese painter. The two artists had agreed to exchange their own por∣traits, and Raphael, on receiving his friend's pic∣ture, addresses him in the following words:</P>

<P>The charm of Portrait-painting is still more beautifully described in verse by a friend of Ra∣phael's, the amiable and accomplished Count Bal∣thasor Castiglione.<Q><L>Sola tuos Vultus referens Raphaelis imago</L>

<L><HI>Inspir'd by thee, the soft Corinthian Maid.</HI>]</L>
<P>Pliny has transmitted to us the History of the Maid of Corinth and her father. <Q REND="inline">"Dibutades, a potter of Sicyon, first formed likenesses in clay at Corinth, but was indebted to his daughter for the invention; the girl being in love with a young man who was soon going from her into some remote country, traced out the lines of his face from his shadow upon the wall by candle-light. Her father, filling up the lines with clay, formed a bust, and hardened it in the fire with the rest of his earthen ware."</Q> <BIBL>Plin. Lib. 35.</BIBL></P>
<P>Athenagoras, the Athenian philosopher, gives a similar account of this curious and entertaining anecdote, adding the circumstance that the youth was sleeping when the likeness was taken from his shadow. <Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q></P>
<P>The same writer, who lived in the second cen∣tury

of the Christian aera, informs us that this mo∣nument of ancient art was extant at Corinth in his time, though Pliny seems to intimate that it did not survive the taking of that city by Mummius.</P>
<P>In the Poesies de Fontenelle there is an epistle from the Maid of Corinth, whom the author calls Dibutadis, to her imaginary lover Polemon. She describes her own work in the following stanzas:
<Q><LG>

<L><HI>'Twas then Panaeus drew, with freedom's train.</HI>]</L>
<P>Panaeus was the brother of Phidias, the celebrated Sculptor, whom he is said to have assisted in his noblest works. Pausanias, in his Fifth Book, gives an account of several pictures by this early Artist, and particularly of the picture here alluded to. It was painted in the celebrated portico called <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Poecile.</P>
<P>Besides a general representation of the conflict, the flight of the barbarians, and a distant view of their ships, Theseus, Minerva, and Hercules were, according to this author, exhibited in the piece. The most conspicuous figures among the persons engaged were Callimachus, and Miltiades, and a hero called Echetlus: he mentions also another hero, who is introduced into the picture, called Ma∣rathon, from whom, he says, the field had its name.<BIBL>Pausanias, fol. Lip. 1696. p. 37.</BIBL></P>
<P>From Pliny's account of the same picture we learn that the heads of the generals were portraits—<Q REND="inline">adeo jam colorum usus percrebuerat, adeoque ars perfecta erat ut in eo Praelio ICONICOS duces pinxisse tradatur.</Q><BIBL>—Plin. lib. xxxv. c. 8.</BIBL></P>

<P>Of the talents of Polygnotus much honourable mention is made by many of the best authors of antiquity, as Aristotle and Plutarch, Dionysius Halicarnas∣sensis, &amp;c. Pausanias speaks of the pictures here alluded to, and in his Tenth Book introduces a very long description of other pictures by the same artist, painted also from Homer, in the Temple at Delphos. The passage however gives but a confused and imperfect idea of the painter's per∣formance. How much the art is indebted to this ancient master, what grace and softness he gave to the human countenance, what embellish∣ments he added to the female figure and dress, are much more happily described by Pliny:—<Q REND="inline">Primus Mulieres lucidâ veste pinxit, capita earum mitris versicoloribus operuit, plurimumque picturae primus contulit: siquidem instituit os adaperire, dentes ostendere, vultum ab antiquo rigore variare.</Q>—The same author likewise bears honourable testimony to the liberal spirit of this great artist, who refused any reward for his ingenious labours in the porti∣co:—<Q REND="inline">Porticum gratuito, cum partem ejus Mycon mercede pingeret.</Q> <BIBL>Plin.

<L><HI>Thy tragic pencil, Aristides, caught.</HI>]</L>
<P>The city of Thebes had the honour of giving birth to this celebrated Artist. He was the first, according to Pliny, who expressed Character and Passion, the Human Mind, and its several emotions; but he was not remarkable for softness of colouring. <Q REND="inline">"His most celebrated picture was of an infant (on the taking of a town) at the mother's breast, who is wounded and expiring. The sensations of the mother were clearly marked, and her fear least the child, upon failure of the milk, should suck her blood."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Alexander the Great,"</Q> continues the same author, <Q REND="inline">"took this picture with him to Pella."</Q></P>
<P>It his highly probable, according to the con∣jecture of Junius, (in his learned Treatise de Pic∣turâ Veterum̄) that the following beautiful epigram of Aemilianus was written on this exquisite pic∣ture:<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>

But this is far inferior, and so perhaps is the original itself, to the very elegant English version of it, which Mr. Webb has given us in his ingenious and animated "Inquiry into the Beauties of Paint∣ing."<Q><L>Suck, little wretch, while yet thy mother lives,</L>

<L><HI>Correct Parrhasius first to rich design.</HI>]</L>
<P>The name of Parrhasius is immortalized by many of the most celebrated ancient authors; and his peculiar talents are thus recorded in Pliny: <Q REND="inline">Primus sym∣metriam picturae dedit, primus argutias vultus, elegantiam capilli, venustatem oris: confessione artificum in lineis extremis palmam adeptus.</Q>—He is one of the four ancient painters, whose lives are written by Carlo Dati.—This ingenious Italian very justly questions the truth of the singular story concerning Parrhasius, preserved in Seneca, where he is accused of purchasing an old Olynthian cap∣tive, and exposing him to a most wretched death, that he might paint from his agony the tortures of Prometheus. The same author contradicts on this occasion a similar falsehood concerning the great Michael Angelo, which was first circulated

<L><HI>The gay, the warm, licentious Zeuxis drew.</HI>]</L>
<P>The Helen of Zeuxis is become almost proverbial: the story of the Artist's having executed the picture from an assemblage of the most beautiful females is mentioned (though with some variation as to the place) by authors of great credit, Pliny, Diony∣sius of Halicarnassus, and Cicero. The last gives a very long and circumstantial account of it. <BIBL>De Inventione, Lib. 2.</BIBL></P>
<P>If the story is true, it is perhaps one of the strong∣est examples we can find of that enthusiastic passion for the fine arts which animated the ancients. Notwithstanding her praeeminence in beauty, it seems somewhat singular that the painter should have chosen such a character as Helen, as a proper decoration for the Temple of Juno. A most cele∣brated Spanish Poet, though not in other respects famous for his judgment, has, I think, not injudi∣ciously metamorphosed this Helen of Zeuxis into Juno herself:<Q><L>Zeusis, Pintor famoso, retratando</L>

The fine arts necessarily languish without pub∣lic protection or encouragement: but public ho∣nours at Rome flowed in a very different channel.

<P>Lio∣nardo da Vinci was born near Florence in 1445. He was perhaps a man as universally accomplished as ever existed. Not only admirable beyond his predecessors in his own profession of Painting, but an excellent Architect and Musician, and of great skill as an Anatomist. Besides all these talents, he was, according to Vasari, the best extempore rimer of his time.—His History and Works are well known.—The singular circumstance of his dying in the arms of Francis the First, king of France, is mentioned by a French poet of the present age,

And the particulars of his death are thus curiously recorded by Vasari, who speaks in raptures of his various and exalted talents:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Finalmente venuto vecchio, stette molti mesi ammalato, et vedendosi vicino alla morte, si volse diligentemente informare de le cose catoliche, &amp; della via buona, et santa religione christiana, et poi con molti pianti confesso e contrito, se bene e' non poteva reggersi in piedi, soste nendosi nelle braccie di suoi amici, e servi, volse divotamente pigliare il santissimo sacramento, fuor del letto: sopragiunseli il Rè che spesso e amerevolmente le soleva visitare: per il che egli per riverenza rizzatosi a sedere sul letto, contando il mal suo &amp; gli accidenti di quello mostrava tuttavia quanto aveva offeso dio, et gli huomini del mendo, non avendo operato nel arte come si conveniva: onde gli venne un parosismo messagiero della morte.

<P>Having taken a journey on foot, in extremely hot weather, he imprudently drank cold water, which brought on a fever, of which he died at about the age of forty.</P>
<P>His colouring was most exquisitely adapted to the delicate softness of female beauty. To form a per∣fect picture of Adam and Eve (says an Italian wri∣ter on Painting) Adam should be designed by Michael Angelo, and coloured by Titain; Eve de∣signed by Raphael, and coloured by Corregio.—</P>

<P>Titian is said to have resided in Spain from the year 1548 to 1553, and seems to have raised a strong passion for Art in that country.—His most eminent disciple was Juan Fernandez Ximenes de Navarrete, who is called by his Spanish Biographer, The Titian of Spain.—Though born deaf and dumb, from whence he derives his common title <HI>el Mudo,</HI> he rose to great reputation as a Painter; and was warmly patronized by his Sovereign, as appears from the following incident—In painting the martyrdom of a Saint, he had introduced the figure of his personal enemy, who happened to be the King's Secretary, in the character of the Executioner: the Secretary complained to his master, and petitioned that his features might be effaced; but his Majesty defended the Painter, and ordered the figure to remain.—In praising this singular genius, I have ventured to borrow something like a conceit from the famous Spanish Poet Lope de Vega, who has celebrated his talents in the following verses:<Q><P><LABEL>Del Mudo Pintor famosissimo.</LABEL></P>

<L><HI>And thou, Velasquez, share the honour due.</HI>]</L>
<P>Don Diego Velasquez de Silva, the most accomplished of the Spanish Painters, was born at Seville, 1594, and clos'd his honourable and splendid life at Madrid in 1660.—His master was Pacheco, a Spaniard, who united the sister arts of Painting and Poetry.—Velas∣quez was patronized by the famous Olivarez, and had the honour of painting our Charles the First, during his visit at Madrid: perhaps he contributed not a lit∣tle to form the taste and passion for art, by which that Prince was so eminently distinguished. The Spanish Painter rose to great honours in his own country, and had, like Rubens, the singular fortune to unite the cha∣racter of an Ambassador with that of an Artist, being sent on an extraordinary commission, in 1648, to Pope Innocent X.</P>
<P>One of his most striking historical pictures, was the expulsion of the Moors from Spain; a noble, national subject, which he painted for Philip the Third, in com∣petition
<PB N="76" REF="91"/>
with three Artists of reputation, and obtained the preference.</P>
<P>But he is particularly celebrated for the spirit and energy of his Portraits; concerning which there are two singular ancedotes related by his Spanish Biogra∣pher; and the following may possibly amuse the reader:</P>
<P>In 1639, he executed a portrait of Don Adrian Pulido Pareja, Commander in chief of an armament appointed to New Spain; and pleased himself so well in the execution, that he affixed his name to the pic∣ture; a circumstance not usual with him. He had painted with pencils of uncommon length, for the sake of working at a greater distance, and with peculiar force; so that the picture (says my Spanish author) when near, is not to be distinguished, and at a distance, is a miracle. As Velasquez, after this portrait was fi∣nished, was at work in the palace, the King, as usual, went privately to his apartment to see him paint; when observing the figure of Pareja, and taking it for the real person, he exclaimed with surprize, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What! are you still here? have you not your dispatches? and why are you not gone?"</Q> But soon perceiving his mistake, he turn'd to Velasquez (who modestly doubt∣ed the reality of the deception) and said, <Q REND="inline">"I protest to you it deceived me."</Q>—For this story, such as it is, I am indebted to the author whom I have quoted in the preced ng Note. The celebrated Murillo, whose pictures are much better known in England than those of his master, was a disciple of Velasquez.</P>

of Seville, in 1613. His first master was Juan de Castillo; but he soon settled in Madrid, under the pro∣tection of Velasquez, who contributed to his improve∣ment in the most generous manner. The Spaniards boast that Murillo became a great Painter, without ever travelling out of Spain. He is said to have refused the offer of an establishment in England from Charles the Second, and to have pleaded his age as an excuse for not quitting his own country; where he died, and was buried with great marks of honour, in 1685.</P>
<P>Those who wish for more information on the Artists of Spain, may be amply gratified by the amusing work which Mr. Cumberland has lately published on the Painters of that country:—they will find in it a very spirited account of the famous Mengs, who died in the service of the Spanish court, at the age of fifty-one, in 1779.—If we could trust to the praises bestowed on this celebrated Artist, by his friend and biographer Azara, we might revere him as the restorer of perfect art; but the elegant writer of our country, who has surveyed his capital productions with an impartial eye, gives us to understand, that they all betray a great poverty of ge∣nius. Indeed the personal history of Mengs may tend to confirm this idea. He was originally made a painter and a drudge, by the tyranny of a cruel father; and though he applied himself intensely through life to the practice and theory of his art, he seems never to have attained that felicity of performance, which can per∣haps belong only to those, who devote themselves to a favorite art in the happy ardour of unconstrained af∣fection. The professional writings of Mengs will

<P>The Low Countries, though little celebrated for inventive genius, have given to mankind the two signal discoveries, which have imparted, as it were, a new vital spirit both to Literature and to Paint∣ing. This honour however has been brought into question—Germany made a strong, but unsuccess∣ful effort to rob Holland of the glory which she derives from the first invention of Printing: and Painting in oil (it has been said) was known in Italy before the time of John Van Eyck, or John of Bruges, as he is commonly called; to whom that discovery is generally ascribed, about the year 1410.—But Vasari, in his Life of Anto∣nello da Messina, relates very particularly the cir∣cumstances of Van Eyck's invention, and the sub∣sequent introduction of the secret into Italy. A most learned antiquarian and entertaining writer of our own time has supposed that Van Eyck might possibly <Q REND="inline">"learn the secret of using oil in England, and take the honour of the invention to himself, as we were then a country little known to the world of arts, nor at leisure, from the confusion of the times, to claim the discovery of such a secret."</Q>—

But, though I have perused it with the attention it deserves, it does not lead me to retract what I had said; because, after all his researches on this subject, it appears that although Oil-painting was not absolutely the invention of Van Eyck, it was yet indebted to him for those improvements which made it of real value to his profession.—The ingenious Fleming seems there∣sore to be still entitled to those honours that have been lavished on his name, as improvement in such cases is often more useful and more meritorious than invention itself, which is frequently the effect of chance, while the former arises from well-directed study.</P>

After having illustrated the subject from the writings of Aristotle and Xenophon, he concludes his remarks with the following reflec∣tion:—<Q REND="inline">"Yet, considering its vast power in morals, one cannot enough lament the ill destiny of this di∣vine art, which, from the chaste handmaid of Vir∣tue, hath been debauched, in violence of her na∣ture, to a shameless prostitute of Vice, and pro∣curess of Pleasure."</Q>—Hurd's Note on the follow∣ing line of Horace:
<Q>"<HI>Suspendit picta vultum mentemque tabella.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>To this let me add one observation for the ho∣nour of our English artists!—The prostitution of the pencil, so justly lamented by this amiable wri∣ter, is perhaps less frequent in this kingdom, than in any country whatever, in which Painting has been known to rise to an equal degree of perfec∣tion.</P>

<P>Sir
<PB N="92" REF="107"/>
Godfrey Kneller, born at Lubec 1646, settled in England 1674, was knighted by King William, created a Baronet by George the First, and died 1723.—No Painter was ever more flattered by the Muses; who gave him credit for talents which he never displayed. Dryden says, in his enchanting Epistle to Kneller:
<Q><L>Thy genius, bounded by the times, like mine,</L>
<L>Drudges on petty draughts, nor dares design</L>
<L>A more exalted work, and more divine.</L></Q>
But the drudgery of the Poet arose from the most cruel necessity; that of the Painter, from avarice, the bane of excellence in every profession!—If Sir Godfrey had any talents for history, which is sure∣ly very doubtful, we have, as Mr. Walpole well observes, no reason to regret that he was confined to portraits, as his pencil has faithfully transmitted to us <Q REND="inline">"<HI>so many ornaments of an illustrious age.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q>Though I have partly subscribed to the general idea, that William, in whose reign this Painter prin∣cipally flourished, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"contributed nothing to the advancement of arts,"</Q> yet I must observe, that his employing Kneller to paint the Beauties at Hamp∣ton Court, his rewarding him with knighthood, and the additional present of a gold medal and chain, weighing £.300, may justify those lines of Pope, which describe <Q REND="inline">"The Hero, William,"</Q> as an encourager of Painting.</Q></P>

<P>About twenty years ago, the present Duke of Richmond opened, in his house at Whitehall, a gallery for artists, completely filled with a small but well-chosen col∣lection of casts from the antique, and engaged two eminent artists to superintend and direct the stu∣dents.—This noble encouragement of art, though superseded by a royal establishment, is still entitled to remembrance and honour: it not only served as a prelude to more extensive institutions, but con∣tributed much towards forming some capital artists of the present time. The name of Mortimer is alone sufficient to reflect a considerable lustre on this early school.</P>

<L><HI>Teach but thy transient tints no more to fly.</HI>]</L>
<P>Al∣though the superior excellencies of this admirable artist make us peculiarly regret the want of durabi∣lity in his exquisite productions; yet he is far from being the only artist, whose pictures soon discover an appearance of precipitate decay. Fugitive co∣louring seems indeed to be the chief defect among our present painters in oil; and it must be the most ardent wish of every lover of art, that so great an evil may be effectually remedied. As the Royal Academy is a society of enlightened artists, esta∣blished
<PB N="95" REF="110"/>
for the improvement of every branch of Painting, it may be hoped that they will pay atten∣tion to this mechanical point, as well as to the no∣bler acquirements of art, and employ some person, who has patience and abilities for such an office, to discover, by a course of experiments, to what cause this important evil is owing. If it be found to arise from the adulteration of colours, oils, and varnishes, might it not be eligible for the Academy to follow the example of another profession, who, where health and life are concerned, obviate the difficulty of getting their articles genuine from the individual trader, by opening a shop at the expence of the So∣ciety, to prepare and sell the various ingredients, free from those adulterations which private interest might otherwise produce?</P>
<P>But there may be no just ground of complaint against the integrity of the colourman, and this failure may perhaps arise from the artist's mixing his colours, and their vehicles, in improper propor∣tions to each other; that is, instead of painting with oil properly thickened with colour, using oil only fully stained with it, to which a proper consistence (or body, as the painters call it) is given by strong gum varnishes; in short, using more vehicle than colour; by which, although most brilliant and transparent effects may be produced, yet the particles of colour are too much attenuated, and divided from each other, and consequently less able to with∣stand the destructive action of light. If the defici∣ency
<PB N="96" REF="111"/>
complained of originates from this source, the Academy, by a careful course of experiments, may be able clearly to ascertain what preparations of the more delicate colours are most durable; what oils and varnishes will best preserve the original brilliancy of the paint; what are the best propor∣tions for this purpose in which they can be used; and how far glazing (that almost irresistible temptation to oil-painters) may or may not be depended on. All these points are at present so far from being known with certainty, that perhaps there are not two Painters, who think perfectly alike on any one of them. The author hopes, that the gentlemen of the pencil will pardon his presuming to offer a hint on this delicate subject, with which he does not pretend to be intimately acquainted. The ideas, which he has thus ventured to address to them, arise only from the most ardent wish, that future ages may have a just and adequate sense of the flourishing state of Painting in England in the reign of George the Third, and that our present ex∣cellent artists may not be reduced to depend on the uncertain hand of the engraver for the esteem of posterity.</P>
<P>A very liberal Critic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Gentleman's Magazine for November 1778, p. 526.</NOTE>, in his flattering remarks on the Poem, seems, in speaking of this Note, to mistake a little the meaning of its author, who al∣luded only to that defect in colouring, where the finer tints are so managed, for the sake of an imme∣diate
<PB N="97" REF="112"/>
and short-lived brilliancy, that they sink very soon into no colour at all. He did not mean to touch on those changes in Painting, where the colours all grow darker, the lights become brown, and the shadows one mass of black. This is like∣wise a great evil, and calls aloud for redress. Per∣haps the Critic above mentioned has pointed out the true cause of this defect, <HI>viz.</HI> the indiscriminate blending of the colours, and the not using pure, simple, uncompounded tints.</P>

A young and noble author, now living, has obliged the world with a translation of it in rhyme.—As to the picture, no artist could express more happily the wild and sublime spirit of the poet from whom he drew.

<L><HI>Now Art exults, with annual Triumphs gay.</HI>]</L>
<P>While we are delighted with the increasing splen∣dor of these annual entertainments, it is but just to remember, that we are indebted to the Society of Arts and Sciences for our first public exhibition of Paintings. The different societies of artists soon followed so excellent an example; and our rapid and various improvements in this lovely art reflect the highest honour on this happy institution. Our exhibitions at once afford both the best nursery for the protection of infant genius, and the noblest field for the display of accomplished merit: nor do they only administer to the benefit of the artist, and the pleasure of the public: they have still a more exalted tendency; and when national subjects are painted with dignity and force, our exhibitions may
<PB N="99" REF="114"/>
justly be regarded as schools of public virtue. Per∣haps the young soldier can never be more warmly animated to the service of his country, than by gazing, with the delighted public, on a sublime picture of the expiring hero, who died with glory in her defence. But, not to dwell on their power of inspiring martial enthusiasm, our exhibitions may be said to have a happy influence on the manners and morals of those, who fill the different depart∣ments of more tranquil life. In support of this sen∣timent, I beg leave to transcribe the following judi∣cious remark from an author, who has lately obliged the public with two little volumes of elegant and spirited Essays. <Q REND="inline">"They, whose natural feelings have been properly improved by culture, nor have yet become callous by attrition with the world, know from experience, how the heart is mollified, the manners polished, and the temper sweetened, by a well-directed study of the arts of imitation. The same sensibility of artificial excellence, extends it∣self to the perception of natural and moral beauty; and the student returns from the artist's gallery to his station in society, with a breast more disposed to feel and to reverberate the endearments of social life, and of reciprocal benevolence."</Q><BIBL>—KNOX's Essays Moral and Literary, 1778, p. 264, on Sculp∣ture.</BIBL></P>

<L><HI>Whose needy Titian calls for ill-paid gold.</HI>]</L>
<P>Richardson has fallen into a mistake concerning the famous Danaë, and other pictures of Titian, which he says (in quoting a letter of Titian's without considering its address) were painted for Henry the VIIIth of England; a tyrant, indeed, vo∣luptuous and cruel, but still less detestable than the sullen and unnatural Philip the IId of Spain, who filled up the measure of his superior guilt by the horrid assassination of his son. Philip, on his mar∣riage with Mary, assumed the title of King of Eng∣land; and to him Titian addressed the letter, which speaks of the pictures in question: the painter frequently mentions his attachment to his unworthy patron.</P>
<P>His solicitude to ensure his protection and favour, is strongly marked in the following short passage of
<PB N="101" REF="116"/>
a letter which he addressed to one of Philip's at∣tendants. <Q REND="inline">"Mando ora la poesia di Venere e Adone, nella quale V. S. vedrà, quanto spirito e amore so mettere nell' opere di sua Maestà."</Q> <BIBL>Raccolta, tom. ii. p. 21.</BIBL></P>
<P>How poorly this great artist was rewarded for his ill-directed labour, appears very forcibly in a long letter of complaint, which he had spirit enough to address to the king, on the many hardships he suffered in being unable to obtain the payment of the pension which had been granted to him by the emperor Charles the Vth. <BIBL>Raccolta, tom. ii. p. 379.</BIBL></P>

<PB N="102" REF="117"/>
whose glory has of late received new lustre from the pen of Robertson and the pencil of West. The striking scene here alluded to, which preceded the death of Sidney, has not yet, I believe, ap∣peared upon canvass, but is forcibly described by the noble and enthusiastic friend of Sidney, the Lord Brooke.—See Biograph. Britan. Art. SIDNEY.</P>
<P>The particulars also are minutely described, and with great feeling, in a letter from his uncle Lei∣cester to Sir Thomas Heneage, quoted in Collins's Memoirs of the Sidneys. The tide of national ad∣miration flowed very strong in favour of Sidney, when Mr. Walpole, in speaking of Lord Brooke, appeared to check the current; but the merits of Sidney are sufficient to bear down all opposition.—Instead of joining the elegant author I have men∣tioned, in considering Sir Philip Sidney as <Q REND="inline">"an astonishing object of temporary admiration,"</Q> I am surprised that so judicious an author should ever question so fair a title to universal regard. The learning and munificence, the courage and courtesy, of Sidney endeared him to every rank; and he justly challenges the lasting affection of his country from the closing scene of his life, in which heroism and humanity are so beautifully blended. I never can think this accomplished character any ways de∣graded by his having written a tedious romance (in which however there are many touches of exqui∣site beauty and spirit) to amuse a most amiable sister, whom he tenderly loved; or by his having
<PB N="103" REF="118"/>

<L><HI>Th' heroic Daughter of the virtuous More.</HI>]</L>
<P>Mar∣garet, eldest daughter of the celebrated Sir Thomas More. The scene which I have proposed for the subject of a picture, is taken from the following passage in Ballard:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"After Sir Thomas More was beheaded, she took care for the burial of his body in the chapel of St. Peter's ad Vincula, within the precincts of the Tower; and afterwards she procured his corpse to be removed, and buried in the chancel of the church at Chelsea, as Sir Thomas More, in his life-time, had appointed. His head having remained about fourteen days upon London Bridge, and being to be cast into the Thames to make room for others, she bought it. For this she was summoned before the council, as the same author relates, and be∣haved with the greatest firmness, justifying her conduct upon principles of humanity and filial piety. She was, however, imprisoned, but soon released; and dying nine years after her father, at the age of thirty-six, was buried at St. Dunstan's, in Canterbury. The head of her father, which she had preserved, with religious veneration, in a box of
<PB N="104" REF="119"/>
lead, was, at her particular request, committed with her to the grave. It was seen standing on her coffin in the year 1715, when the vault of the Roper (her husband's family) was opened."</Q><BIBL>—See Ballard's Memoirs of Learned Ladies, p. 36.</BIBL></P>
<P>The character of this amiable woman is happily drawn both by Addison and Walpole.—She mar∣ried, at the age of twenty, William Roper, Esquire, of Kent, to the infinite satisfaction of her father; for she seems to have been the dearest object of his parental affection, which is very strongly marked in his letters addressed to her. She was indeed most eminently distinguished by her learning, in an age when the graces of the mind were regarded as an essential article in female education: but the beauty and force of her filial piety reflects a still superior lustre on this accomplished woman.—There is more than one passage in her life, which would fur∣nish an admirable subject for the pencil. Her in∣terviw with her father, on his return to the Tower, is mentioned as such by Mr. Walpole.</P>

<P>It is remarkable, that the greatest painters have failed in this particular. Raphael, Guido, and West, are all deficient in the figure of Satan. Richardson observes, in his description of the pictures of Italy,—<Q REND="inline">"Je n'ai jamais vu d'aucun Maître une repre∣sentation
<PB N="105" REF="120"/>
du Diable, prince des Diables, qui me satisfit."</Q> Page 500.</P>
<P>In recommending this subject to the pencil, it may be proper to observe, that it is not only ex∣tremely difficult, but even attended with danger, if we credit the following curious anecdote, in a medi∣cal writer of great reputation:—<Q REND="inline">"Spinello, fameux Peintre Toscan, ayant peint la chute des anges rebelles, donna des traits si terribles à Lucifer, qu'il en fut lui-meme saisi d'horreur, &amp; tout le reste de sa vie il crut voir continuellement ce Demon lui repro∣cher de l'avoir representé sous une figure si hidieuse.</Q> <BIBL>Tissot de la Santé des Gens de Lettres."</BIBL></P>
<P>As this story is so singular, it may amuse some readers to see it in the words of Vasari, from whom Tissot seems to have taken it.—The Italian Bio∣grapher says, in describing a picture by Spinello Aretino, who flourished in the close of the 14th century, <Q REND="inline">"Si vede un Lucifero gia mutato in bestia bruttissima. E si compiacque tanto Spinello di farlo orribile, e contraffatto, che si dice (tanto puo alcuna fiata l'immaginazione) che la detta figura da lui dipinta gl'apparue in sogno domandandolo, doue egli l'hauvesse veduta si brutta e per che fattole tale scorno con i suoi pennelli: E che egli svegliatosi dal sonno, per la paura, non potendo gridare, con tremito grandissimo si scosse di maniera che la moglie destatasi lo soccorse: ma niente di manco fu per cio a rischio, stringendogli il cuore, di morirsi per cotale accidente, subitamente.

<L>AN English Sparrow, pert and free,</L>
<L>Who chirps beneath his native tree,</L>

<L>"HOW idle are mortals!" (said Wisdom to Youth)</L>
<L>"They slight the clear dictates of Reason and Truth;</L>
<L>"They worship Ambition, to Pleasure they bend,</L>
<L>"Yet blindly o'erlook a more excellent friend:</L>
<L>"And hence their vain hopes are eternally crost,</L>
<L>"Their life in a tempest of wishes is lost;</L>
<L>"Still destin'd to toil, and of toil to repent,</L>
<L>"For neglect of just vows to the Goddess Content;</L>
<L>"That Goddess from whom all felicity flows,</L>
<L>"Who unites every good in the gift she bestows;</L>
<L>"So free of her bounty to all who confess it,</L>
<L>"To solicit her smile is almost to possess it."</L>
<L>When I heard this fine speech, my fond passion was rais'd,</L>
<L>And I set forth in quest of the Being so prais'd;</L>
<L><PB N="192" REF="200"/>
At the mansion of Grandeur my search I begin,</L>
<L>And ask if the Goddess Content is within:</L>
<L>But Pride, who as centinel guarded the door,</L>
<L>Said bluntly he ne'er heard her title before;</L>
<L>He told me I wanted a poor rustic slut,</L>
<L>And bade me go look in some little thatch'd hut.</L>
<L>I march'd to the Villager's lowly abode,</L>
<L>'Twas a snug pretty cottage, and stood near the road:</L>
<L>And here a good woman, possessing, tho' humble,</L>
<L>A face that could frown, and a tongue that would grumble,</L>
<L>Said—the person I ask'd for had lodg'd in her cot,</L>
<L>But, alas! such good luck was no longer her lot;</L>
<L>For she quitted her roof, where she oft had repos'd,</L>
<L>When yon great house was built, and the common inclos'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I conceiv'd, as I now bade the village farewell,</L>
<L>With the mild sons of Science this Goddess must dwell;</L>
<L>But those, where I sought some obliging instructor,</L>
<L>Were squabbling about an electric conductor.</L>
<L><PB N="193" REF="201"/>
Some cry'd up the point; some commended the ball;</L>
<L>The soft breath of Science was turn'd to a squall:</L>
<L>The Sages no mental conductor could find</L>
<L>To draw off the flame that now flash'd on their mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In haste I exclaim'd, to the Learned adieu!</L>
<L>For e'en Science offends, when she talks like a shrew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Having wander'd so wide of the object I sought,</L>
<L>I was now led to think, and rejoic'd at the thought,</L>
<L>This Goddess (herself for her charms so renown'd)</L>
<L>With the daughters of Beauty must surely be found:</L>
<L>With this hope I approach'd (unperceiv'd by them all)</L>
<L>Three lovely young girls just array'd for the ball;</L>
<L>In each, whose bright eyes on a mirror were bent,</L>
<L>I thought I discover'd a spark of Content;</L>
<L>But watching them more, in their beautiful faces,</L>
<L>Of the goddess I sought I no more saw the traces;</L>
<L>For as they survey'd, with a critical glance,</L>
<L>The elegant MONTAGU move in the dance,</L>
<L>In her exquisite figure such graces were shewn,</L>
<L>That viewing her charms they distrusted their own.</L>
<L><PB N="194" REF="202"/>
Thou gentlest of nymphs! while thy triumphs in∣crease,</L>
<L>Unconscious of beauty, so fatal to peace!</L>
<L>Tho' the sparks of Content in one sex thou may'st smother,</L>
<L>Bright Ecstasy's flame thou wilt raise in the other.</L>
<L>If in bosom parental Content could reside,</L>
<L>The heart of thy parent this treasure must hide;</L>
<L>But, alas! 'tis a truth which all parents lament,</L>
<L>Their tender anxiety stifles Content.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O tell me, while vainly to find thee I pant,</L>
<L>Dear latent Divinity! where is thy haunt?</L>
<L>"Away to Batheaston," Good-nature replies,</L>
<L>"Behold she there weaves the poetical prize."</L>
<L>With thy Myrtle, kind MILLER! O let me be crown'd,</L>
<L>Then my search is repaid, and the Goddess is found:</L>
<L>Nay, if to another your wreath you assign,</L>
<L>And give it to verse far superior to mine,</L>
<L>My search's dear object I still must attain,</L>
<L>And the proof of this wonder's exceedingly plain,</L>
<L><PB N="195" REF="203"/>
It rests on this maxim, by Horace invented,</L>
<L>The Bard who writes worst is the Bard most con∣tented.</L>
<L>My claim to this blessing thus made very clear,</L>
<L>If I've nothing to hope, I have nothing to fear;</L>
<L>For MILLER can please while the mind she amuses,</L>
<L>Both when she bestows, and e'en when she refuses;</L>
<L>In truth I suspect, from her singular aim,</L>
<L>The Goddess I seek is conceal'd by her name:</L>
<L>She herself is Content, and her house is the fane,</L>
<L>Where Spleen and Ill-nature no favours obtain:</L>
