In another more forward, ornamented with silver, are Venus and the Graces, taking Ice, Jellies, &amp;c.—Close in the front is a table, a twhich are seated Jupiter, Mercury, Plutus, Momus, and some others playing hazard; and in the back ground are small figures in groupes.—Iris, Cupid and Ganymede are waiting.</STAGE>
