<LG>
<L>IMMORTAL Shade! of each immortal Name!</L>
<L>That shines recorded in the Lists of <HI>Fame;</HI></L>
<L>Not those who from hereditary Light,</L>
<L>With the false Glare of borrow'd Beams are bright;</L>
<L>But such as Merit with rich Blood combine,</L>
<L>Reflecting Honour on a Noble Line;</L>
<L>That like the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> with peculiar Grace,</L>
<L>Unstain'd preserve the Beauties of their Race.</L>
<L>If the frail Bustle of this transient State</L>
<L>With immaterial Spirits can have Weight,</L>
<L>From those <HI>Aetherial</HI> Mansions where you rest,</L>
<L>Star-crown'd, in Pomp of virtuous Glory blest,</L>

Propitious come—an honest Muse inspire—</L>
<L>Nerve her weak Wing—lend <HI>your</HI> heroic Fire—</L>
<L>With your undaunted Ardour lead her on,</L>
<L>And teach her, <HI>Eagle-like,</HI> to view the Sun:</L>
<L>None but the Bird of JOVE should tempt a Flight,</L>
<L>That rushes on a Blaze of cloudless Light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First, JUSTICE come with thy impartial Scale,</L>
<L>Lest <HI>Prejudice</HI> or <HI>Int'rest</HI> should prevail;</L>
<L>Take from <HI>Reflection</HI> ev'ry Power of Thought,</L>
<L>Ere that a single Compliment be <HI>bought;</HI></L>
<L>Shield <HI>Reason</HI>'s Eye with thy protecting Hand,</L>
<L>From the dread Influence of PACTOLIAN Sand;</L>
<L>Which, scatter'd by <HI>Corruption</HI> as she flies,</L>
<L>Pretending Patriots choaks—or dims their Eyes;</L>
<L><HI>Corruption,</HI> who, as MIDAS could of old,</L>
<L>With magic Touch turns any Thing to Gold,</L>
<L>Locks up the Senses, or inverts their Power,</L>
<L>Melting the hardest Heart with DANAE'S Show'r.</L>
<L>Nor yet let pois'nous Rage her Venom spit,</L>
<L><HI>Satire</HI> run mad is the <HI>Buffoon</HI> of Wit;</L>
<L>From whose foul Mouth no Character's secure,</L>
<L>That lays the Bastard Vice at any Door;</L>

<L>Beneath the Influence of such churlish Skies;</L>
<L>Where no mild Gleams of Summer cheer the Plain,</L>
<L>But Storms and everlasting Winter reign;</L>
<L><HI>Bays</HI> which, like <HI>Nightshade,</HI> scatter Poison round,</L>

<L>Honest may CHURCHILL be, for ought I know,</L>
<L>Some Lines depict him, and I wish him so:</L>
<L>Let him enjoy his Profit and his Praise,</L>
<L>In these so politic and gen'rous Days;</L>
<L>Let him successfully pursue his Plan,</L>
<L>And prey upon the tend'rest Part of Man;</L>
<L>Blushless, remorseless, and without Control,</L>
<L><HI>Plunder</HI> th' immediate Jewel of the Soul:</L>
<L>Let him, <HI>Humanity</HI> thrown quite aside,</L>
<L>Indulge his Spleen, his Int'rest, or his Pride;</L>
<L>Let him in <HI>Scandal</HI> wade thro' Thick and Thin,</L>
<L>To praise each <HI>Out</HI>—and censure ev'ry <HI>In:</HI></L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="7"/>
Let him, to please a Crowd of Knaves and Fools,</L>
<L>Paint MONARCHS, or their MINISTERS, as Tools:</L>
<L>Let him, still more to prostitute the MUSE,</L>
<L>A neighb'ring Nation by the <HI>Lump</HI> abuse:</L>
<L>Let him, in boundless Rage, pronounce the Lot</L>
<L>Of blackest Infamy to ev'ry SCOT:</L>
<L>Let him, like Humankind's imperial <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Caligula.</NOTE>Foe,</L>
<L>Wish to behead them at a single Blow:</L>
<L>Let him, if not content to rail at home,</L>
<L>O'er the submissive World's wide Limits roam;</L>

<L>Ready to fight a NABOB or a <HI>Ghost:</HI></L>

<L>Behold a Monster! without Heart or Head,</L>

That GOD whose Service to become a <HI>Wit,</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Rev'rend</HI> BARD most piously hath quit;</L>
<L>And why? Because—Oh Reason most divine—</L>
<L>His narrow Income could not purchase <HI>Wine.</HI></L>
<L>That GOD, who, were he cruel to this Earth,</L>
<L>As <HI>Men</HI> to <HI>Men</HI> for Profit are or Mirth,</L>
<L>With sportive Thunder would confound the whole,</L>
<L>Nor spare e'en mighty CHURCHILL'S <HI>Patriot</HI> Soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Think not, mistaken Bard, I am thy Foe,</L>
<L>I neither know thee, nor can wish to know:</L>
<L>Reflected in thy Works thy Mind I view,</L>
<L>And grieve to find it of a Sable Hue:</L>
<L>Strong Beams of <HI>Genius</HI> gild the STYGIAN Gloom,</L>
<L>And <HI>fancy</HI> Webs there in her finest Loom;</L>
<L><HI>Expression</HI> well arrays her verbal Band,</L>
<L>And <HI>Judgment</HI> leads them with a Master Hand;</L>
<L>While JANUS-fronted Int'rest slily waves</L>
<L>A flaming Banner to all Party Slaves;</L>
<L>Whose gaudy Hieroglyphics catch the Eye,</L>
<L>A poor fantastic Shade of <HI>Liberty.</HI></L>
<L>This Patch-work Medley, blending Right and Wrong,</L>
<L>An impious, moral, soothing, sneering Song,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="9"/>
That shows the tortur'd <HI>Muse</HI> in various State,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>For my poor Part, by various Passions wrought,</L>
<L>I praise the Numbers while I damn the Thought;</L>
<L>I weep to see such Flights of Golden Darts,</L>
<L>With deadly Poison tipp'd, to rankle Hearts;</L>
<L>And, while the lovely Snake-like Verse I scan,</L>
<L>Praise crowns the <HI>Bard</HI>—while Censure marks the <HI>Man.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What has provok'd this unknown Scribe, you'll say,</L>
<L>This feeble, nameless Mushroom of a Day;</L>
<L>This unfledg'd Rhimer to attempt a Flight,</L>
<L>When such a <HI>Falcon Muse</HI> appears in Sight?</L>
<L>What could induce the unimpassion'd Elf,</L>
<L>Who wishes me unfeeling as himself;</L>
<L>What Motives have arous'd the slumb'ring Drone,</L>
<L>Thus to assault me on <HI>Satiric</HI> Throne?</L>
<L>ME! ME! a Monosyllable of Weight,</L>
<L>To give a thousand grov'ling Reptiles Fate;</L>
<L>Can such a lifeless and insipid Thing</L>
<L>E'er hope to pierce me with his feeble Sting?</L>

As well a Bee, that hunts the flow'ry Field,</L>
<L>Might strive to wound thro' AJAX' seven-fold Shield:</L>

<L>Some Water-drinking Sprite—for gen'rous <HI>Wine</HI></L>

<L>To please no <HI>Patron,</HI> nor to grasp at <HI>Pelf,</HI></L>
<L>Slave to no <HI>Party</HI>—I oppose myself:</L>

Free by my Birth, still freer by my Heart,</L>
<L>Of injur'd Humankind I take the Part;</L>
<L>Boldly I stand 'gainst <HI>Passion</HI>'s dang'rous Sway,</L>
<L>And with cool <HI>Wisdom</HI> take the Middle Way;</L>

To say his Counsels gave a Nation Weight,</L>
<L>The Thunderbolt of <HI>Eloquence</HI> and State?</L>
<L>Reason cries no, <HI>Intention</HI> is the Base</L>

<L>Should we reverse the Medal, and portray</L>
<L>Those who prevail in Ministerial Sway,</L>

<L>Possess'd of shining Talents, upright Hearts,</L>
<L>Would REASON and BRITANNIA cry out Shame,</L>
<L>Branding our Numbers with a venal Name?</L>
<L>Let us hope not—the Number is but small</L>
<L>That Councils guide, and cannot take in all:</L>
<L>This we may say beyond the Reach of Doubt,</L>
<L>Some <HI>Honest</HI> and some <HI>Able</HI> must be <HI>out;</HI></L>

<L>May <HI>Commerce</HI> ever sail thro' fav'ring Skies,</L>
<L>Free from th' Incumbrance of <HI>Monopolies;</HI></L>
<L>Ne'er may her Sons, insatiate after Gold,</L>
<L>War's Crimson Banner hastily unfold;</L>
<L>Yet if again (as, Oh, too sure, I fear,</L>
<L>While faithless and insidious Foes are near)</L>
<L>Her hostile Blast should hurricane our <HI>Isle,</HI></L>
<L>And all our present golden Hopes beguile;</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="39"/>
If fire-breath'd <HI>Até</HI> should successful prove,</L>
<L>And hungry <HI>Vultures</HI> chace the peaceful <HI>Dove,</HI></L>
<L>May Resolution BRITISH Councils wait,</L>
<L>May Probity and Wisdom guide the State</L>
<L>Where <HI>Ministers</HI> preside—nor factious Spleen,</L>
<L>Incumb'ring clog the complicate Machine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet wish we not, with HERMES' slumb'rous Wand,</L>
<L>To close such ARGUS Eyes as watch the Land;</L>
<L>No, may they ever, for BRITANNIA'S Sake,</L>
<L>Keep clearly independently awake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When to War's <HI>flinty Couch,</HI> from Beds of Down,</L>
<L>Our Heroes haste for Honour's deathless Crown,</L>
<L>May Zeal unshaken brace each martial Heart,</L>
<L>Well to perform the executive Part;</L>
<L>Still may a HAWKE be found to sweep the Main,</L>
<L>A GRANBY to adorn th' embattled Plain.</L>
