<HEAD>MARCELLUS: A MONODY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>YE virgin-train, that whilom wak'd your lyres,</L>
<L>Fast by the chrystal springs of <HI>Helicon,</HI></L>
<L>To heav'nly strains of joy those dulcet Notes</L>
<L>Ill suit a Nation's universal moan,</L>
<L>When ev'ry hope with their lost Prince is gone.</L>
<L>The thrilling voice of joy no longer floats</L>
<L>O'er pale <HI>Britannia's</HI> sadly-silent shore;</L>
<L>MARCELLUS is no more!</L>
<L>But oh, the doleful change! the plaintive muse,</L>
<L>In cypress crown'd, must pour her piteous loan</L>
<L>Of sigh, and tear, and heart-empiercing groan!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="3"/>
<L>Come then, <HI>Melpomene,</HI> begin the Lay,</L>
<L>With rueful Tears your sorrowing Dirges steep,</L>
<L>Such tears as erst your sister-muse did weep</L>
<L>For her dear twin<HI>-Palici:</HI> every stream</L>
<L>Shall stop to hear your theme,</L>
<L>Then sadly murmur to the plaintive shore</L>
<L>MARCELLUS is no more!</L>
<L>And feeble Echo from her aery cave</L>
<L>Shall back return the note, and ev'ry vale,</L>
<L>With all its flow'rs shall droop to hear the tale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How can he lie unwept who knew to raise</L>
<L>Esteem and love in every loyal heart.</L>
<L>He was the pride of ev'ry Shepherd's praise,</L>
<L>Grac'd with each decent and each princely part.</L>
<L>Nor did the muse ungrateful pour her lays;</L>
<L>He oft wou'd listen to the poet's art:</L>
<L>And oft alone, beneath the muse's grot,</L>
<L>Hid from a nation's eye, he sat and thought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
<L>Full many an hour, his Offspring pratling round,</L>
<L>In gentle dalliance has he fondly smil'd;</L>
<L>Full many an hour, sequester'd from annoys,</L>
<L>In tender amorous talk, has he beguil'd,</L>
<L>With the dear Partner of his dearest joys.</L>
<L>Mean while the foe of Life, with treacherous art,</L>
<L>In sly destruction prey'd upon his heart;</L>
<L>And yet no fatal symptom did appear;</L>
<L>The blood still mantled on his rosy cheek.</L>
<L>As <HI>Phaebus</HI> oft the clouds with gold doth streak,</L>
<L>While brooding storms engender in the air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where was your knowledge then, you sapient Tribe,</L>
<L>That boast commandment o'er the pulse of life?</L>
<L>Was not a Princess' tears sufficient bribe,</L>
<L>Cou'd not a King's, a Nation's pray'rs prevail</L>
<L>To make your nicest skill explore his ail?</L>
<L>Some few more Years the breath of Life supply,</L>
<L>And keep him from the Sky—</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="5"/>
Ah me, what boots your skill?—Not all the pray'rs</L>
<L>That pale <HI>Britannia,</HI> and her King might pour;</L>
<L>Not all <HI>Augusta</HI>'s sadly-flowing Tears,</L>
<L>Not <HI>Aesculapius'</HI> Sons with all their care,</L>
<L>Might ward the black inevitable hour.</L>
<L>Or could their Prince's vital Band repair,</L>
<L>Which in their mood the fatal Sisters tore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alass, he droop'd in life's maturest age,</L>
<L>While <HI>Albion</HI>'s sceptre hung before his view;</L>
<L>And thrice the wise <HI>Machaon</HI> did presage</L>
<L>That <HI>Febris</HI> her inflaming rage withdrew;</L>
<L>Yet then renewing her malignant strife,</L>
<L>The deadly Fiend unhous'd his tender Life.</L>
<L>Then stream'd the tear from ev'ry <HI>British</HI> eye.</L>
<L>But chief th' unhappy sire, in dismal plight,</L>
<L>Detests the odious light,</L>
<L>And with loud wailings tears the arched sky.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="6"/>
And calls on death to bring a kind reprieve,</L>
<L>And lay his cruel sorrows in the grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But ah! my Muse, how may thy voice record,</L>
<L>Tho' well I ween thou shar'st her piteous state,</L>
<L>The tender unimaginable woe,</L>
<L>Of his dear Consort for her ravish'd Lord,</L>
<L>Torn by the hand of unrelenting Fate!</L>
<L>Then hide the tears thou canst not give to flow.</L>
<L>Enough, that when reviving life did chase</L>
<L>Death's dismal image from her pallid face;</L>
<L>With manly shew she mask'd her sorrows dread;</L>
<L>And greatly strove to chear with kind relief</L>
<L>Her tender Offspring's sympathetic grief,</L>
<L>Who at their Mother's wretched plight grew sad.</L>
<L>What heart so stony but did melt in tears?</L>
<L>See pale <HI>Britannia</HI> wears,</L>
<L>Thro' all her Sons, one dismal face of woe.</L>
<L>Nor <HI>British</HI> eyes alone do overflow;</L>
<L>See even the <HI>Orcades</HI> and frozen Realms</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="7"/>
By Ocean's wat'ry barrier sunder'd far,</L>
<L>Pay their full tribute of a tender tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mean while the awful tongue of death doth pierce</L>
<L>Night's drowzy ear, with tollings, deep and slow;</L>
<L>And now the solemn pealing Organs blow.</L>
<L>The winking Lamps a dusky lustre shed</L>
<L>Along the Mansions of the Dead,</L>
<L>Where mould'ring Kings in silent dust repose.</L>
<L>And now with often interrupted sighs,</L>
<L>The Lawn-rob'd Prelate his last duty pays,</L>
<L>And dust to dust conveys:</L>
<L>And now entomb'd his sacred body lies,</L>
<L>Free from the cares, that this vain life enclose.</L>
<L>Up to yon regions of eternal day,</L>
<L>The free, unbodied spirit wings its way;</L>
<L>There in the bosom of its god doth bide</L>
<L>In pure, immaculate, unshaken bliss;</L>
<L>Nor recks the loss of earthly Kingdom's pride,</L>
<L>Enthron'd for aye in heavenly paradise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
<L>And thou, sad Consort of a Prince too good</L>
<L>Longer to visit this forsaken clime;</L>
<L>Ah! cease to weary the relentless sky,</L>
<L>With bitter penance and with bootless tears.</L>
<L>Nor deem with vainly-pious pray'rs</L>
<L>To draw him from his blissful dear abode;</L>
<L>Where now he never more may fear to die,</L>
<L>Nor grieve, save when your plaints wou'd him recall,</L>
<L>Not lent for aye to your fond hopes, I ween!</L>
<L>And oh! forgive the muse, whose daring lays</L>
<L>Wou'd grateful pour her artless loyal teen;</L>
<L>Reckless that true to draw a Prince's praise,</L>
<L>Asks the nice touches of a master-hand,</L>
<L>Since she may see in your fair Offspring plann'd</L>
<L>The graceful dowries of their Father's mind;</L>
<L>See Mercy, Truth, Religion, Liberty,</L>
<L>Beneath the shine of your enliv'ning eye,</L>
<L>And ev'ry virtue that may bless mankind.</L>
