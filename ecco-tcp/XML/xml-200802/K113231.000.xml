<L>YOUR kind indulgence I am come to ask,</L>
<L>Whilst I pursue my arduous mimic task,—</L>
<L>The path's contracted which I've sought to tread,</L>
<L>Chance pops each fancy'd figure in my head;</L>
<L>No dint of labour gather'd by degrees;</L>
<L>I can't assume an object when I please,</L>
<L>But just when Nature throws it in my way,</L>
<L>I take the hint, and bear the form away.</L>
<L>I would not by this mimic trade offend,</L>
<L>My only motive is a private end,</L>
<STAGE>chinking the pocket.</STAGE>
<L>And who is here will say, that I'm to blame,</L>
<L>Since all mankind are apt to do the same.</L>
<L>Yet some there are, methinks, I hear 'em too,</L>
<L>Who cry "this fellow's plan can never do,</L>

<L>"And then like me you'll <HI>hobble</HI> to renown;</L>
<L>"Live by your wits, sir, that's the way to thrive,</L>
<L>"Why how the devil do you think I live?"</L>
<L>I'll take the hint, and, on myself depend,</L>
<L>I never yet found Manager my friend,</L>
<L><PB N="iii" REF="5"/>By you supported, boldly I'll oppose</L>
<L>My mimic powers against a host of foes;</L>
<L>Roscius shall wake, and strut about the stage</L>
<L>And limping Proteus grin with comic rage,</L>
<L>Feeble <HI>Othello</HI> shall the state address,</L>
<L>And toothless <HI>Shylock</HI> lisp in <HI>Macbeth</HI>'s dress,</L>
<L>Declaiming <HI>Richard</HI> in short accents breathe,</L>
<L>And bind his brows with a victorious wreathe.</L>
<L>The silken sons of <HI>Italy</HI> shall squall,</L>
<L>And John roast-beef, in vulgar accents bawl;</L>
<L>In fine—as far as mimickry can go,</L>
<L>At least as far as I can make it do,</L>
<L>These and some others of the changeful crew,</L>
<L>Shall rise for judgment to your candid view,</L>
<L>And if some merit you shall chance to find,</L>

<P>A SUDDEN transition, from the gloomy shades of oblivion, to the sunshine of pro∣sperity, has different effects on different objects; the man of sense shews it in a modest reserve; a coxcomb in a superficial glare of ostentation, which renders him the laughing-stock of all mankind. A tom-boy is always pleas'd with a new coat, let it fit him ever so ill; and when he should rather hide himself, his vanity leads him into the great world; hence he is proud of esta∣blishing a character, though a ridiculous one.</P>

<P>Damn your tragedies and your comedies,— I wish they were at the bottom of the sea, with all my heart;—'Tis a great pity they were ever in∣troduced upon the stage;—there is more <HI>sound</HI> sense in a good solo, or a concerto, than all the tragedies and comedies in the world.

<P>It will be acknowledged, I believe, that some, the most ingenious of mankind, who now stand dignified in the court of Fame, have been often more indebted to chance than industry.</P>
<P>Painters have drawn conversation pieces from the figures they have fancied to have seen in a fire; beautiful landscapes from the broken plaister in a wall;—formidable caverns, and terrifick mountains from the inside of a rotten cheese.</P>
<P>Musicians have composed fav'rite airs, from the creaking hinges of a door, the gurgling in
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
the neck of a bottle, or the wind whistling through some little cranny.</P>
<P>Famous actors too have often formed their mode of speaking from the howling of a wolf, the roaring of a lion, or the braying of an ass.</P>
<P>There is a modern theatrical hero, "whom I have heard many praise, and highly too" as Hamlet says, who fell in love with the mono∣tony of a chimney sweeper.</P>

<L>While we on the Thames were so snug and so quiet,</L>
<L>Amidst all the rain, all the racket and riot;</L>
<L>There were courtiers and cits, and the gay savage-weavers,</L>
<L>With fifes and with drums, with bones and with cleavers,</L>
<L>The men were all red, and the women all white,</L>
<L>Oh, what a beautiful, wonderful sight,</L>
<L>The like I ne'er saw since born of my mother,</L>
<L>Should I live 'till I die, I should ne'er see another,</L>
<L>For should I have been drowned again and again,</L>
<L>I'd have gone every day such a sight to have seen;</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="47"/>There's nothing in drowning you know now-a-days,</L>
<L>They've found out such wonderful comical ways,</L>
<L>Were you dead as a stone, you've no reason to fear,</L>
<L>They'll bring you to life with a flea in your ear;</L>
<L>The barges, some look'd like a body of gold,</L>
<L>Some new ones were made—<HI>out of those that were old,</HI></L>
<L>With awnings of silk; with some figure or trinket,</L>
<L>And many were covered—with nought but a blanket,</L>
<L>With white-lead and black-lead, with paint and with pitch,</L>
<L>Some large and some small, some ragged, some rich;</L>
<L>Such a sight, such a noise, and such a sweet smell,</L>
<L>Was never yet equal'd on earth, or in hell;</L>
<L>But we got to the gardens, and landed at last,</L>
<L>In hopes to partake of the princely repast,</L>
<L>The tables were cover'd with many a thing,</L>
<L>You'd have thought they'd set out a fine feast for a king;</L>
<L>The aldermen fix'd 'em each man to his plate,</L>
<L>One took off his wig, and then rubbing his pate,</L>
<L><PB N="48" REF="48"/>Look'd eagerly round with a face of despair,</L>
<L>For fear that he should not come in for his share,</L>
<L>Then stuck his knife greedily into a ham,</L>
<L>Unbutton'd his waistcoat his stomach to cram,</L>
<L>Laid bones of fat capons in many a heap,</L>
<L>That he eat and he drank till he fell fast asleep.</L>
<L>I was hungry too, for as I am a sinner,</L>
<L>I'd ne'er a spare minute to get me a dinner,</L>
<L>So took me a plate, and then slily sate down,</L>
<L>Determin'd to get me <HI>a bit of the brown,</HI></L>
<L>Was resolv'd to have it the risque of my life,</L>
<L>In spight of that termagant teazer, my wife,</L>
<L>But I'd scarcely got down a good mouthful or two,</L>
<L>Before she came up, and made such ado,</L>
<L>Cry'd I never should more go with her to a feast,</L>
<L>Said I look'd like a hog, that I eat like a beast,</L>
<L>I'd have look'd if I could still more like a swine,</L>
<L>Would have swill'd all the night, but could get me no wine;</L>
<L>And mine was the fate too, often out of twenty,</L>
<L>There was nought but the artful appearance of plenty;</L>
<L>To canal next I went, and there dipp'd in my hat</L>
<L>To get me some water—there was plenty of that,</L>
<L><PB N="49" REF="49"/>I heard some of the people most bitterly curse,</L>
<L>But I took it like marriage, the better for worse;</L>
<L>The people all round seem'd in wonderful po∣ther,</L>
<L>Did nothing but grumble, and look at each other.</L>
<L>To me it appear'd like a scene of confusion,</L>
<L>Without a beginning, or without a conclusion.</L>
<L>All the folks that were,—Turk, Christian, or Jew,</L>
<L>Seem'd plaguely puzzl'd to know what to do.</L>
<L>By the fate of St. Peter, and well too they might,</L>
<L>'Twas the very first time they had seen such a sight,</L>
<L>'Twas a kind of rehearsal, where none knew his part,</L>
<L>To act a Regatta's a wonderful part!</L>
<L>There was none of them perfect, to be sure, it was plain,</L>
<L>'Twill be much better done when they play it again;</L>
<L>But they all from that day have been fond of the water,</L>
<L>Not a father or mother, not a son or a daughter,</L>
<L>But what have sate off for a draught or a dip,</L>
<L>To get themselves cur'd of the scurvy and hyp.</L>
<L>Oh, were you at Margate, Southampton, or Brighton,</L>
<L>To see them all sous'd—'tis enough to delight one;</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="50"/>'Tis sheep-sheering time, so they go there to feast,</L>
<L>The first to be wash'd well, and then to be fleec'd.</L>
<L>The townsmen have all got a wonderful knack</L>
<L>Of touching your pocket, and stroking your back,</L>
<L>But give them a chance, once, of taking a pull,</L>
<L>At a fat golden fleece, and they'll have all his wool.</L>
<L>If you would not be apt now to think it too long,</L>
<L>I'd finish my story good folks with a song.</L>

<HEAD>A LECTURE ON LECTURES, By LANCELOT LAST; As delivered with Applause in the COMIC MIRROUR. Written by G. S. CAREY.</HEAD>
<P>LADIES and Gemmen, I am going pre∣sently, as you will presently find, to give you a Lecture on Lectures; but first and fore∣mast, I think it necessary that I should give some account of myself, because why, a man who can give no account of himself, is to all intents and purposes a <HI>vagram.</HI></P>
<P>First, as to my name, Lancelot Last, at your service, by trade, when I used to follow it, a Shoe-maker; but happening to see one of your lectures in our town, I was inspired, as it were;
<PB N="54" REF="53"/>
and knowing him to be no better a <HI>schollard</HI> than myself, I took off my <HI>apron,</HI> threw down my <HI>lap-stone,</HI> kick'd up my <HI>last,</HI> gave up my <HI>awl,</HI> and so sate off to lecture.</P>
<P>I was a long time before I could determine with myself what subject to begin upon, at last <HI>Stronomy</HI> came into my head, but I found the stars were out of my reach, and whenever I dipp'd into that science, I was presently lost as it were, in a cloud.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Ottamy</HI> came into my head, I was at home to a peg in <HI>Ottomy,</HI> for as to plucking out a tooth, picking out a corn, or curing the gripes, nobody is more skilful than myself; but when I came to the <HI>imputation</HI> of a leg, and as I am na∣turally tender-hearted, I found it too <HI>cutting</HI> a business for me.</P>
<P>Then says I to myself, what think'st thou Lancelot Last of Chymistry, I thought as how that business was something in my way, for as to your <HI>consalves</HI> and <HI>presarves,</HI> nobody is more <HI>larned</HI> in that way than myself, but then <HI>thinks</HI> I again, some of my auditors may have an objection to the name of physic, and physic now-a-days is nothing but a <HI>drug.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="54"/>Then Heraldry came into my head, but hap∣pening to see the king's arms on a hackney-coach, I thought the dignity of that science was gone to the dogs.</P>
<P>I was advised by a friend to set about Mid∣wifery. But my mind was big with a thousand apprehensions whenever I thought on midwifery, so I gave it up because I thought I should never be able to <HI>deliver</HI> myself on that subject.</P>
<P>I would have set about a Lecture on Heads, but my friend, Alexander Stevens, had dissected every head in the kingdom so well, that I should have been set down as one of his <HI>block-heads,</HI> if I had meddled with ever a one.</P>
<P>I thought the <HI>Heart</HI> would be no bad subject, but I could find so very few good ones, that I had not a heart to set about it.</P>
<P>Thinking of bad hearts put the <HI>Law</HI> into my head, and I thought a Lecture on the Law would be no bad thing; then says I to myself, the Law is no good thing in itself, but would it not be better if I could make a good subject out of it. I thought and I ponder'd about it 'till I found
<PB N="56" REF="55"/>
myself like a poor fly in a cobweb. The law always puts me in mind of a coffin—once in, your never out again.</P>
<P>If none of these subjects will do, what in the name of Lucifer will do,—Lucifer! who the devil is Lucifer?—A great orator mayhap.— Odds-bobbs, an orator.—It directly came into my head that a lecture on oratory would be the best thing I could set about, and so I begins my lecture on oratory.</P>
<P>Ladies and gemmen, now according to the learned, and I am something of a <HI>schollard</HI> myself. Oratory means jawing, because why, why be∣cause no orator can speak without his jaws; perhaps you'll think I can't give you a Latin <HI>devination</HI> for it, now you'll find yourselves mistaken, what is English for <HI>Os?</HI> why bon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> to be sure, and the jaws being full of bones▪ they are <HI>fix'd</HI> proofs that the word oratory comes from <HI>Os.</HI></P>
<P>Now I think it is necessary that you should know what an orator is——and what is it you will say; I answer, it is a man—and what is he to do?—I answer, to speak words——and
<PB N="57" REF="56"/>
what are words?—I answer, letters put together, but there can be no word without a <HI>wowel</HI>;— because why; why do you see, because they can't.</P>
<P>What are the necessary qualities of an ora∣tor——The first, he must spit, then wipe his mouth, then lay his hand upon his heart, then turn up his eyes, then out comes a word, then another follows it, and then, like a post horse, let him get on as fast as he can.</P>
<P>An orator should be a good mimic too— Odds-bobbs, now I talk of mimics, I must take care what I am about, for I am surrounded by mimics here, and they will be for taking me off, perhaps, now you shall see I will save them the trouble, and take off myself.</P>
