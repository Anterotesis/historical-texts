<HEAD>TO THE QUEEN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the following Comedy, my purpose was, to draw a FEMALE CHARACTER, which with the most lively Sensibility, fine Un∣derstanding, and elegant Accomplishments, should unite that beautiful Reserve and Delicacy which, whilst they veil those charms, render them still more interesting. In delineating such a Character, my heart naturally dedicated it to YOUR MAJESTY; and nothing remained, but permission to lay it at Your feet. Your Majesty's graciously allowing me this high Honour, is the point to which my hopes aspired, and a reward, of which without censure I may be proud.</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>With the warmest wishes for the continuance of your Majesty's felicity, I am YOUR MAJESTY's Most devoted and most dutiful Servant, <HI>H. Cowley.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD><HI>SCENE I.</HI>—Lincoln's-Inn.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Saville,</HI> followed by a Servant, at the top of the stage, looking round, as if at a loss.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>LINCOLN's-INN!—Well, but where to find him, now I am in Lincoln's-Inn?—Where did he say his Master was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>He only said in Lincoln's-Inn, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's pretty! And your wisdom never enquired at whose chambers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you spoke to the servant yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I was too impatient to ask questions, you ought to have taken directions, blockhead!
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Courtall <HI>singing.</HI></STAGE>
Ha, Courtall!—Bid him keep the horses in motion, and then enquire at all the chambers round.
<STAGE>Exit servant.</STAGE>
What the devil brings you to this part of the town?— Have any of the Long Robes, handsome wives, sisters or chambermaids?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps they have;—but I came on a different errand; and, had thy good fortune brought thee here half
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
an hour sooner, I'd have given thee such a treat, ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sorry I miss'd it: what was it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was informed a few days since, that my cousins Fallow were come to town, and desired earnestly to see me at their lodgings in Warwick-Court, Holborn. Away drove I, painting them all the way as so many Hebes. They came from the farthest part of Northumber∣land, had never been in town, and in course were made up of rusticity, innocence, and beauty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>After waiting thirty minutes, during which there was a violent bustle, in bounced five sallow dam∣sels, four of them maypoles;—the fifth, Nature, by way of variety, had bent in the Aesop style.—But they all opened at once, like hounds on a fresh scent:—<Q>Oh, cousin Courtall!—How do you do, cousin Courtall! Lord, cousin, I am glad you are come! We want you to go with us to the Park, and the Plays, and the Opera, and Almack's, and all the fine places!</Q>— The devil, thought I, my dears, may attend you, for I am sure I won't.—However, I heroically stayed an hour with them, and discovered, the virgins were all come to town with the hopes of leaving it—Wives:—their heads full of Knight-Baronights, Fops, and adventures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, how did you get off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, pleaded a million engagements.—How∣ever, conscience twitched me; so I breakfasted with them this morning, and afterwards 'squired them to the gardens here, as the most private place in town; and then took a sorrowful leave, complaining of my hard, hard fortune, that obliged me to set off immediately for Dor∣setshire, ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I congratulate your escape!—Courtall at Al∣mack's, with five aukward country cousins! ha! ha! ha!—Why, your existence, as a Man of Gallantry, could never have survived it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Death, and fire! had they come to town, like the rustics of the last age, to see Paul's, the Lions, and the Wax-work—at their service;—but the cousins of our days come up Ladies—and, with the knowledge they glean from magazines and pocket-books, Fine Ladies; laugh at the bashfulness of their grandmothers, and boldly de∣mand their <HI>entrées</HI> in the first circles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where can this fellow be!—Come, give me some news—I have been at war with woodcocks and par∣tridges these two months, and am a stranger to all that has passed out of their region.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! enough for three Gazettes. The Ladies are going to petition for a bill, that, during the war, every man may be allowed Two Wives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis impossible they should succeed, for the ma∣jority of both Houses know what it is to have one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gallantry was black-ball'd at the <HI>Coterie</HI> last Thursday, and Prudence and Chastity voted in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that may hold 'till the Camps break up.— But have ye no elopements? no divorces?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Divorces are absolutely out, and the Commons-Doctors starving; so they are publishing trials of <HI>Crim. Con.</HI> with all the separate evidences at large; which they find has always a wonderful effect on their trade, actions tumbling in upon them afterwards, like mackarel at Gravesend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>What more?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing—for weddings, deaths, and politics, I never talk of, but whilst my hair is dressing. But prithee, Saville, how came you in town, whilst all the qualified gentry are playing at pop-gun on Coxheath, and the country over-run with hares and foxes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I came to meet my friend Doricourt, who, you know, is lately arrived from Rome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Arrived! Yes, faith, and has cut us all out! —His carriage, his liveries, his dress, himself, are the
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
rage of the day! His first appearance set the whole <HI>Ton</HI> in a ferment, and his valet is besieged by <HI>levées</HI> of tay∣lors, habit-makers, and other Ministers of Fashion, to gratify the impatience of their customers for becoming <HI>à la mode de Doricourt.</HI> Nay, the beautiful Lady Fro∣lic, t'other night, with two sister Countesses, insisted upon his waistcoat for muffs; and their snowy arms now bear it in triumph about town, to the heart-rending af∣fliction of all our <HI>Beaux Gorçons.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! Well, those little gallantries will soon be over; he's on the point of marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marriage! Doricourt on the point of marriage! 'Tis the happiest tidings you could have given, next to his being hanged—Who is the Bride elect?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never saw her; but 'tis Miss Hardy, the rich heiress—the match was made by the parents, and the courtship begun on their nurses knees; Master used to crow at Miss, and Miss used to chuckle at Master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! then by this time they care no more for each other, than I do for my country cousins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know that; they have never met since thus high, and so, probably, have some regard for each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never met! Odd!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>A whim of Mr. Hardy's; he thought his daugh∣ter's charms would make a more forcible impression, if her lover remained in ignorance of them 'till his return from the Continent.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Saville's <HI>Servant.</HI></STAGE>

<P>Mr. Doricourt, Sir, has been at Counsellor Pleadwell's, and gone about five minutes.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can't promise; perhaps I may.—See there, there's a bevy of female Patagonians, coming down upon us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the Lord, then, it must be my strapping cousins.—I dare not look behind me—Run, man, run.</P>

<P>Oh, oh!—What, you are the fellow that ties folks together, in your sixpenny cuts, that never meet any where else?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crowq.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, dear Sir, excuse me!—we always go on <HI>foundation</HI>; and if you can help me to a few anecdotes of your master, such as what Marchioness he lost money to, in Paris—who is his favourite Lady in town—or the name of the Girl he first made love to at College—or any incidents that happened to his Grandmother, or Great aunts—a couple will do, by way of supporters—I'll weave a web of intrigues, losses, and gallantries, between them, that shall fill four pages, procure me a dozen dinners, and you, Sir, a bottle of wine for your trouble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Port.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, oh! I heard the butler talk of you, when
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
I lived at Lord Tinket's. But what the devil do you mean by a bottle of wine! — You gave him a crown for a retaining fee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crowq.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir, that was for a Lord's amours; a Commoner's are never but half. Why, I have had a Ba∣ronet's for five shillings, though he was a married man, and changed his mistress every six weeks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Port.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't tell me! What signifies a Baronet, or a bit of a Lord, who, may be, was never further than sun and sun round London? <HI>We</HI> have travelled, man! My master has been in Italy, and over the whole island of Spain; talked to the Queen of France, and danced with her at a masquerade. Ay, and such folks don't go to masquerades for nothing; but mum—not a word more—Unless you'll rank my master with a Lord, I'll not be guilty of blab∣bing his secrets, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crowq.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, perhaps you'll throw in a hint or two of other families, where you've lived, that may be worked up into something; and so, Sir, here is one, two, three, four, five shillings.</P>

<P>Well, that's honest, <STAGE>pocketing the money.</STAGE> To tell you the truth, I don't know much of my master's concerns yet;—but here comes Monsieur and his gang: I'll pump them: they have trotted after him all round Europe, from the Canaries to the Isle of Wight.</P>

<P>Most fortunate! My dear Saville, let the warmth of this embrace speak the pleasure of my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, this is some comfort, after the scurvy re∣ception I met with in your hall.—I prepared my mind, as I came up stairs, for a <HI>bon jour,</HI> a grimace, and an <HI>adieu.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Judging of the master from the rest of the family. What the devil is the meaning of that flock of foreigners below, with their parchment faces and snuffy whiskers? What! can't an Englishman stand behind your carriage, buckle your shoe, or brush your coat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stale, my dear Saville, stale! Englishmen make the best Soldiers, Citizens, Artizans, and Philosophers in the world; but the very worst Footmen. I keep French
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
fellows and Germans, as the Romans kept slaves; be∣cause their own countrymen had minds too enlarged and haughty to descend with a grace to the duties of such a station.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>A good excuse for a bad practice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>On my honour, experience will convince you of its truth. A Frenchman neither hears, sees, nor breathes, but as his master directs; and his whole system of conduct is compris'd in one short word, <HI>Obedience!</HI> An Englishman reasons, forms opinions, cogitates, and disputes; he is the mere creature of your will: the other, a being, conscious of equal importance in the universal scale with yourself, and is therefore your judge, whilst he wears your livery, and decides on your actions with the freedom of a censor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>And this in defence of a custom I have heard you execrate, together with all the adventitious manners imported by our Travell'd Gentry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but that was at eighteen; we are always <HI>very</HI> wise at eighteen. But consider this point: we go into Italy, where the sole business of the people is to study and improve the powers of Music: we yield to the fascination, and grow enthusiasts in the charming science: we travel over France, and see the whole kingdom composing or∣naments, and inventing Fashions: we condescend to avail ourselves of their industry, and adopt their modes: we return to England, and find the nation intent on the most important objects; Polity, Commerce, War, with all the Liberal Arts, employ her sons; the latent sparks glow afresh within our bosoms; the sweet follies of the Continent im∣perceptibly slide away, whilst Senators, Statesmen, Patri∣ots and Heroes, emerge from the <HI>virtû</HI> of Italy, and the frippery of France.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I may as well give it up! You had always the art of placing your faults in the best light; and I can't
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
help loving you, faults and all: so, to start a subject which must please you, When do you expect Miss Hardy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the hour of expectation is past. She is ar∣rived, and I this morning had the honour of an interview at Pleadwell's. The writings were ready; and, in obedi∣ence to the will of Mr. Hardy, we met to sign and seal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has the event answered? Did your heart leap, or sink, when you beheld your Mistress?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, neither one nor t'other; shes a fine girl, as far as mere flesh and blood goes.——But—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, she's <HI>only</HI> a fine girl; complexion, shape, and features; nothing more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not that enough?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! she should have spirit! fire! <HI>l'air enjoué!</HI> that something, that nothing, which every body feels, and which no body can describe, in the resistless charmers of Italy and France.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thanks to the parsimony of my father, that kept me from travel! I would not have lost my relish for true unaffected English beauty, to have been quarrell'd for by all the Belles of Versailles and Florence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho! thou hast no taste. <HI>English</HI> beauty! 'Tis insipidity; it wants the zest, it wants poignancy, Frank! Why, I have known a Frenchwoman, indebted to nature for no one thing but a pair of decent eyes, reckon in her suite as many Counts, Marquisses, and <HI>Petits Maî∣tres,</HI> as would satisfy three dozen of our first-rate toasts. I have known an Italian <HI>Marquizina</HI> make ten conquests in stepping from her carriage, and carry her slaves from one city to another, whose real intrinsic beauty would have yielded to half the little <HI>Grisettes</HI> that pace your Mall on a Sunday.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>And has Miss Hardy nothing of this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>If she has, she was pleased to keep it to herself. I was in the room half an hour before I could catch the
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
colour of her eyes; and every attempt to draw her into conversation occasioned so cruel an embarrassment, that I was reduced to the necessity of news, French fleets, and Spanish captures, with her father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>So Miss Hardy, with only beauty, modesty, and merit, is doom'd to the arms of a husband who will despise her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are unjust. Though she has not inspir'd me with violent passion, my honour secures her felicity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Doricourt, you know very well that when the honour of a husband is <HI>locum-tenens</HI> for his heart, his wife must be as indifferent as himself, if she is not unhappy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho! never moralise without spectacles. But, as we are upon the tender subject, how did you bear Touch∣wood's carrying Lady Frances?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know I never look'd up to her with hope, and Sir George is every way worthy of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>A la mode Angloise,</HI> a philosopher even in love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, I detain you—you seem dress'd at all points, and of course have an engagement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>To St. James's. I dine at Hardy's, and accom∣pany them to the masquerade in the evening: but break∣fast with me to-morrow, and we'll talk of our old com∣panions; for I swear to you, Saville, the air of the Con∣tinent has not effaced one youthful prejudice or attach∣ment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>—With an exception to the case of Ladies and Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; there I plead guilty:—but I have never yet found any man whom I could cordially take to my heart, and call Friend, who was not born beneath a British sky, and whose heart and manners were not truly English.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Flutter.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah, Villers, have you seen Mrs. Racket?— Miss Hardy, I find, is out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vill.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not seen her yet. I have made a voyage to Lapland since I came in. <STAGE>flinging away the book.</STAGE> A Lady at her toilette is as difficult to be moved, as a Qua∣ker, <STAGE>yawning</STAGE>. What events have happened in the world since yesterday? have you heard?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes; I stopt at Tattersall's as I came by, and there I found Lord James Jessamy, Sir William Wilding, and Mr. —. But, now I think of it, you sha'n't know a syllable of the matter; for I have been informed you never believe above one half of what I say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vill.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear fellow, somebody has imposed upon you most egregiously!—Half! Why, I never believe one tenth part of what you say; that is, according to the plain and literal expression: but, as I understand you, your intelli∣gence is amusing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very hard now, very hard. I never re∣lated a falsity in my life, unless I stumbled on it by mis∣take; and if it were otherwise, your dull matter-of-fact people are infinitely oblig'd to those warm imaginations which soar into fiction to amuse you; for, positively, the common events of this little dirty world are not worth talking about, unless you embellish 'em!—Hah! here comes Mrs. Rackett: Adieu to weeds, I see! All life!
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mrs.</HI> Rackett.</STAGE>
Enter, Madam, in all your charms! Villers has been abu∣sing your toilette for keeping you so long; but I think we are much oblig'd to it, and so are you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rack.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How so, pray? Good-morning t'ye both. Here, here's a hand a-piece for you. <STAGE>They kiss her hands.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so! Because it has given you so many beauties.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rack.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Delightful compliment! What do your think of that, Villers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vill.</SPEAKER>
<P>That he and his Compliments are alike—shewy, but won't bear examining.—So you brought Miss Hardy to town last night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rack.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I should have brought her before, but I had a fall from my horse, that confined me a week. —I suppose in her heart she wished me hanged a dozen times an hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rack.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Had she not an expecting Lover in town all the time? She meets him this morning at the Lawyer's. —I hope she'll charm him; she's the sweetest girl in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vill.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vanity, like murder, will out.—You have con∣vinced me you think yourself more charming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rack.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How can that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vill.</SPEAKER>
<P>No woman ever praises another, unless she thinks herself superior in the very perfections she allows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor no man ever rails at the sex, unless he is conscious he deserves their hatred.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rack.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Thank ye, Flutter—I'll owe ye a <HI>bou∣quet</HI> for that. I am going to visit the new-married Lady Frances Touchwood.—Who knows her husband?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rack.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Is there not something odd in his cha∣racter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vill.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, but that he is passionately fond of his wife;—and so petulant is his love, that he open'd the cage of a favourite Bullfinch, and sent it to catch Butterflies, because she rewarded its song with her kisses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rack.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Intolerable monster! Such a brute de∣serves—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vill.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, nay, nay, this is your sex now — Give a woman but one stroke of character, off she goes, like a ball from a racket; sees the whole man, marks
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
him down for an angel or a devil, and so exhibits him to her acquaintance.—This monster! this brute! is one of the worthiest fellows upon earth; sound sense, and a liberal mind; but doats on his wife to such excess, that he quarrels with every thing she admires, and is jealous of her tippet and nosegay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rack.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, less love for me, kind Cupid! I can see no difference between the torment of such an affec∣tion, and hatred.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, pardon me, inconceivable difference, incon∣ceivable; I see it as clearly as your bracelet. In the one case the husband would say, as Mr. Snapper said t'other day, Zounds! Madam, do you suppose that <HI>my</HI> table, and <HI>my</HI> house, and <HI>my</HI> pictures!—<HI>A-propos, des Bottes.</HI> There was the divinest Plague of Athens sold yesterday at Lang∣ford's! the dead figures so natural, you would have sworn they had been alive! Lord Primrose bid Five hundred— Six, said Lady Carmine.—A thousand, said Ingot the Na∣bob.—Down went the hammer.—A <HI>rouleau</HI> for your bar∣gain, said Sir Jeremy Jingle. And what answer do you think Ingot made him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Racket.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, took the offer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I would oblige you, but I buy this picture to place in the nursery: the children have already got Whittington and his Cat; 'tis just this size, and they'll make good companions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rack.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! Well, I protest that's just the way now—the Nabobs and their wives outbid one at every sale, and the creatures have no more taste—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vill.</SPEAKER>
<P>There again! You forget this story is told by Flutter, who always remembers every thing but the circumstances and the person he talks about: — 'twas Ingot who offer'd a <HI>rouleau</HI> for the bargain, and Sir Jeremy Jingle who made the reply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, I believe you are right. — Well, the story is as good one way as t'other, you know. Good morning.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you be so provoking? If I do not look this morning worse than ever I look'd in my life, I am naturally a fright. You shall have it which way you will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rack.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Just as you please; but pray what is the meaning of all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>rising.</STAGE> Men are all dissemblers! flatterers! deceivers! Have I not heard a thousand times of my air, my eyes, my shape — all made for victory! and to-day, when I bent my whole heart on one poor cooquest, I have proved that all those imputed charms amount to no∣thing;—for Doricourt saw them unmov'd.—A husband of fifteen months could not have examin'd me with more cutting indifference.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rack.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then you return it like a wife of fifteen months, and be as indifferent as he.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, there's the sting! The blooming boy, who left his image in my young heart, is at four and twenty improv'd in every grace that fix'd him there. It is the same face that my memory, and my dreams, con∣stantly painted to me; but its graces are finished, and every beauty heightened. How mortifying, to feel my∣self at the same moment his slave, and an object of per∣fect indifference to him!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rack.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How are you certain that was the case? Did you expect him to kneel down before the lawyer, his clerks, and your father, to make oath of your beauty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but he should have look'd as if a sudden ray had pierced him! he should have been breathless! speechless! for, oh! Caroline, all this was I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rack.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry you was such a fool. Can you expect a man, who has courted and been courted by half the fine women in Europe, to feel like a girl from a boarding-school? He is the prettiest fellow you have seen, and in course bewilders your imagination; but he has seen a million of pretty women, child, before he saw you; and his first feelings have been over long ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your raillery distresses me; but I will touch his heart, or never be his wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Absurd, and romantic! If you have no reason to believe his heart pre-engaged, be satisfied; if he is a man of honour, you'll have nothing to com∣plain of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing to complain of! Heav'ns! shall I marry the man I adore, with such an expectation as that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when you have fretted yourself pale, my dear, you'll have mended your expectation greatly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>pausing.</STAGE> Yet I have one hope. If there is any power whose peculiar care is faithful love, that power I invoke to aid me.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mr.</HI> Hardy.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hardy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, now; wasn't I right? Aye, Letty! Aye, Cousin Racket! wasn't I right? I knew 'twould be so. He was all agog to see her before he went abroad; and, if he had, he'd have thought no more of her face, may be, than his own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be, not half so much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hardy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, may be so:—but I see into things; ex∣actly as I foresaw, to-day he fell desperately in love with the wench, he! he! he!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir! how did you perceive it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hardy.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a pretty question! How do I perceive every thing? How did I foresee the fall of corn, and the rise of taxes? How did I know, that if we quarrelled with America, Norway deals would be dearer? How did I foretell that a war would sink the funds? How did I forewarn Parson Homily, that if he didn't some way or other contrive to get more votes than Rubrick, he'd lose the lectureship? How did I—But what the devil makes you so dull, Letitia? I thought to have found you popping about as brisk as the jacks of your harpfi∣chord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, Sir, 'tis a very serious occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hardy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho, pho! girls should never be grave be∣fore marriage. How did you feel, Cousin, beforehand? Aye!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Feel! why exceedingly full of cares.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hardy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could not sleep for thinking of my coach, my liveries, and my chairmen; the taste of clothes I should be presented in, distracted me for a week; and whether I should be married in white or lilac, gave me the most cruel anxiety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is it possible that you felt no other care?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hardy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, of what sort may your cares be, Mrs. Letitia? I begin to foresee now that you have taken a dislike to Doricourt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I have not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hardy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then what's all this melancholy about? A'n't you going to be married? and, what's more, to a sensible man? and, what's more to a young girl, to a handsome man? And what's all this melancholy for, I say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, because he <HI>is</HI> handsome and sen∣sible, and because she's over head and ears in love with him; all which, it seems, your foreknowledge had not told you a word of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fye, Caroline!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hardy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, come, do you tell me what's the mat∣ter then? If you don't like him, hang the signing and sealing, he sha'n't have ye:—and yet I can't say that neither; for you know that estate, that cost his father and me upwards of fourscore thousand pounds, must go all to him if you won't have him: if he won't have you, in∣deed, 'twill be all yours. All that's clear, engross'd upon parchment, and the poor dear man set his hand to it whilst he was a dying.—"Ah!" said I, <Q REND="inline">I foresee you'll never live to see 'em come together; but their first son
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>
shall be christened Jeremiah after you, that I promise you."</Q>—But come, I say, what is the matter? Don't you like him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear, Sir—if I must speak—I fear I was less agreeable in Mr. Doricourt's eyes, than he appeared in mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hardy.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you are mistaken; for I asked him, and he told me he liked you vastly. Don't you think he must have taken a fancy to her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really I think so, as I was not by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Sir, I am convinced he has not; but if there is spirit or invention in woman, he shall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hardy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Girl; go to your toilette—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not my toilette that can serve me: but a plan has struck me, if you will not oppose it, which flat∣ters me with brilliant success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hardy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oppose it! not I indeed! What is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir—it may seem a little paradoxical; but, as he does not like me enough, I want him to like me still less, and will at our next interview endeavour to heighten his indifference into dislike.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hardy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who the devil could have foreseen that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven and earth! Letitia, are you se∣rious?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>As serious as the most important business of my life demands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why endeavour to make him dislike you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because 'tis much easier to convert a sentiment into its opposite, than to transform indifference into tender passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be good philosophy, but I am afraid you'll find it a bad maxim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have the strongest confidence in it. I am in∣spired with unusual spirits, and on this hazard willingly

stake my chance for happiness. I am impatient to begin my measures. <STAGE><HI>Exit</HI> Letitia.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Hardy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you foresee the end of this, Cousin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, Sir; nothing less than your pene∣tration can do that, I am sure; and I can't stay now to consider it. I am going to call on the Ogles, and then to Lady Frances Touchwood's, and then to an Auction, and then—I don't know where—but I shall be at home time enough to witness this extraordinary interview.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was there ever such a provoking wretch! But, to be plain with you, Doricourt, I and my house are at your service: but you are a damn'd agreeable fel∣low, and ten years younger than I am; and the women, I observe, always simper when you appear. For these reasons, I had rather, when Lady Frances and I are to∣gether, that you should forget we are acquainted, further than a nod, a smile, or a how-d'ye.</P>

<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not merely yourself <HI>in propriâ persanâ</HI> that I object to; but, if you are intimate here, you'll make my house still more the fashion than it is; and it is already so much so, that my doors are of no use to me.

<SPEAKER>Miss Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall hardly know Lady Frances, 'tis so long since I was in Shropshire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I'll be sworn you never saw her <HI>out</HI> of Shropshire.—Her father kept her locked up with his Caterpillars and Shells; and loved her beyond any thing —but a blue Butterfly, and a petrified Frog!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha!—Well, 'twas a cheap way of breeding her:—you know he was very poor, though a Lord; and very high-spirited, though a Virtuoso.— In town, her Pantheons, Operas, and Robes de Cour, would have swallowed his Sea-Weeds, Moths, and Mon∣sters, in six weeks!—Sir George, I find, thinks his Wife a most extraordinary creature: he has taught her to despise every thing like Fashionable Life, and boasts that example will have no effect on her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's a great degree of impertinence in all that—I'll try to make her a Fine Lady, to humble him.</P>

<P>I beg ten thousand pardons, my dear Mrs. Racket.—Miss Ogle, I rejoice to see you: I should have come to you sooner, but I was detained in conver∣sation by Mr. Doricourt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray make no apology; I am quite happy that we have your Ladyship in town at last.—What stay do you make?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>A short one! Sir George talks with regret of the scenes we have left; and as the ceremony of pre∣sentation is over, will, I believe, soon return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure he can't be so cruel! Does your La∣dyship wish to return so soon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not the habit of consulting my own wishes; but, I think, if they decide, we shall not return immediately. I have yet hardly form'd an idea of Lon∣don.</P>

<P>Sir George is going with me this morning to the mercer's, to chuse a silk; and then—</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Miss Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very young, my Lady, and have been brought up in solitude. The maxims you learnt among the Wood-Nymphs in Shropshire, won't pass current here, I assure you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my dear creature, you look quite frighten'd!—Come, you shall go with us to an Exhibi∣tion,

and an Auction.—Afterwards, we'll take a turn in the Park, and then drive to Kensington;—so we shall be at home by four, to dress; and in the evening I'll at∣tend you to Lady Brilliant's masquerade.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be very happy to be of your party, if Sir George has no engagements.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! Do you stand so low in your own opinion, that you dare not trust yourself without Sir George! If you chuse to play Darby and Joan, my dear, you should have stay'd in the country;—'tis an Exhibi∣tion not calculated for London, I assure you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>What I suppose, my Lady, you and Sir George, will be seen pacing it comfortably round the Canal, arm and arm, and then go lovingly into the same carriage;—dine <HI>tête-à-tête</HI> spend the evening at Pic∣quet, and so go soberly to bed at Eleven!—Such a snug plan may do for an Attorney and his Wife; but, for Lady Frances Touchwood, 'tis as unsuitable as linfey-woolfey, or a black bonnet at the <HI>Festino!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are rather new doctrines to me!— But, my dear Mrs. Rackett, you and Miss Ogle must judge of these things better than I can. As you observe, I am but young, and may have caught absurd opinions.— Here is Sir George!</P>

<P>No; heaven forbid she should!—If she had, Madam, she would never have been my Wife!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Are you serious?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly so.—I should never have had the courage to have married a well-bred Fine Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, what do you take a Fine Lady to be, that you express such fear of her?<STAGE>sneeringly.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>A being easily described, Madam, as she is seen every where, but in her own house. She sleeps at home, but she lives all over the town. In her mind, every senti∣ment gives place to the Lust of Conquest, and the va∣nity of being particular. The feelings of Wife, and Mother, are lost in the whirl of dissipation. If she con∣tinues virtuous, 'tis by chance—and if she preserves h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Hushand from ruin, 'tis by her dexterity at the Card-Table!—Such a Woman I take to be a perfect Fine Lady!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you I take to be a slanderous Cynic of two-and-thirty.—Twenty years hence, one might have forgiven such a libel!—Now, Sir, hear my defini∣tion of a Fine Lady:—She is a creature for whom Na∣ture has done much, and Education more; she has Taste, Elegance, Spirit, Understanding. In her manner she is free, in her morals nice. Her behaviour is undistin∣guishingly polite to her Husband, and all mankind;—her sentiments are for their hours of retirement. In a word, a Fine Lady is the life of conversation, the spirit of society, the joy of the public!—Pleasure follows where ever she appears, and the kindest wishes attend her slum∣bers.
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>
—Make haste, then, my dear Lady Frances, com∣mence Fine Lady, and force your Husband to acknow∣ledge the justness of my picture!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure 'tis a delightful one. How can you dislike it, Sir George? You painted Fashionable Life in colours so disgusting, that I thought I hated it; but, on a nearer view, it seems charming. I have hitherto lived in obscurity; 'tis time that I should be a Woman of the World. I long to begin;—my heart pants with expectation and delight!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, then; let us begin directly. I am impatient to introduce you to that Society, which you were born to ornament and charm.</P>

<P>Will you go without me!—ha! ha! ha! what a pathetic address! Why, sure you would not always be seen side by side, like two beans upon a stalk. Are you afraid to trust Lady Frances with me, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven and earth! with whom can a man trust his wife, in the present state of society? Formerly there were distinctions of character amongst ye: every class of females had its particular description; Grand∣mothers were pious, Aunts discreet, Old Maids censorious! but now aunts, grandmothers, girls, and maiden gentle∣women, are all the same creature;—a wrinkle more or less is the sole difference between ye.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Maiden Gentlewomen have lost their censoriousness, is surely not in your catalogue of grie∣vances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed it is—and ranked amongst the most serious grievances.—Things went well, Madam, when the tongues at three or four old Virgins kept all the Wives
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>
and Daughters of a parish in awe. They were the Dragons that guarded the Hesperian fruit; and I wonder they have not been oblig'd, by act of parliament, to resume their function.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! and pension'd, I suppose, for making strict enquiries into the lives and conversations of their neighbours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, and impowered to oblige every woman to conform her conduct to her real situation. You, for instance, are a Widow: your air should be se∣date, your dress grave, your deportment matronly, and in all things an example to the young women growing up about you!—instead of which, you are dress'd for con∣quest, think of nothing but ensnaring hearts; are a Coquette, a Wit, and a Fine Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bear witness to what he says! A Coquette! a Wit! and a Fine Lady! Who would have expected an eulogy from such an ill-natur'd mortal!—Valour to a Soldier, Wisdom to a Judge, or glory to a Prince, is not more than such a character to a Woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir George, I see, languishes for the charm∣ing society of a century and a half ago; when a grave 'Squire, and a still graver Dame, surrounded by a sober family, form'd a stiff groupe in a mouldy old house in the corner of a Park.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Delightful serenity! Undisturb'd by any noise but the cawing of rooks, and the quarterly rumbling of an old family-coach on a state-visit; with the happy intervention of a friendly call from the Parish Apothecary, or the Curate's Wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is the society of which you boast? —a meer chaos, in which all distinction of rank is lost in a ridiculous affectation of ease, and every different order of beings huddled together, as they were before the crea∣tion. In the same <HI>select party,</HI> you will often find the wife of a Bishop and a Sharper, of an Earl and a Fidler. In short, 'tis one universal masquerade, all disguised in the same habits and manners.</P>

<P>Why, what harm can there be in compliments? Sure they are not infectious; and, if they were, you, Sir George, of all people breathing, have reason to be satis∣fied about your Lady's attachment; every body talks of it: that little Bird there, that she killed out of jealousy, the most extraordinary instance of affection, that ever was given.</P>

<P>Mr. Flutter, you are one of those busy, idle, meddling people, who, from mere vacuity of mind, are, the most dangerous inmates in a family.

<P>Certainly. I know the design is a rash one, and the event important;—it either makes Doricourt mine by all the tenderest ties of passion, or deprives me of him for ever; and never to be his wife will afflict me less, than to be his wife and not be belov'd.</P>

<P>As readily as I would venture my last guinea, that good fortune might follow.

<P>Yielded herself up to the World! Why did you not bring her to town in a Cage? Then she might have taken a peep at the World!—But, after all, what has the World done? A twelvemonth since you was the gayest fellow in it:—If any body ask'd who dresses best?—Sir George Touchwood.—Who is the most gallant Man? Sir George Touchwood.—Who is the most wedded to Amusement and Dissipation?

<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>The moment I became possessed of such a jewel as Lady Frances, every thing wore a different complex∣ion: that Society in which I liv'd with so much <HI>éclat,</HI> be∣came the object of my terror; and I think of the man∣ners of Polite Life, as I do of the atmosphere of a Pest-house.—My Wife is already infected; she was set upon this morning by Maids, Widows, and Bachelors, who carried her off in triumph, in spite of my displeasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vill.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, to be sure; there would have been no triumph in the case, if you had not oppos'd it:—but I have heard the whole story from Mrs. Rackett; and I assure you, Lady Frances didn't enjoy the morning at all;—she wish'd for you fifty times.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, to tell you the truth, I could wish it was the fashion for married people to be inseparable; for I have more heart-felt satisfaction in fifteen minutes with you at my side, than fifteen days of amusement could give me without you.</P>

<P>O, impossible! We should not gain a single proselyte; and you can't conceive what spiteful things would be said of us.—At Kensington to-day a Lady met us, whom we saw at Court, when we were presented; she
<PB N="48" REF="53"/>
lifted up her hands in amazement!—Bless me! said she to her companion, here's Lady Francis without Sir Hurlo Thrumbo!—My dear Mrs. Racket, consider what an im∣portant charge you have! for Heaven's sake take her home again, or some Enchanter on a flying Dragon will descend and carry her off. — Oh, said another, I dare say Lady Frances has a clue at her heel, like the peerless Rosamond:—her tender swain would never have trusted her so far without such a precaution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heav'n and Earth!—How shall Innocence preserve its lustre amidst manners so corrupt! — My dear Fanny, I feel a sentiment for thee at this moment, tenderer than Love — more animated than Passion.——I could weep over that purity, expos'd to the sullying breath of Fashion, and the <HI>Ton,</HI> in whose latitudinary vortex Chastity herself can scarcely move unspotted.</P>

<P>Oh, there can be no doubt of it. Flut∣ter told us the whole history. Some Italian Princess gave him a drug, in a box of sweetmeats, sent to him by her own page; and it renders him lunatic every month. Poor Miss Hardy! I never felt so much on any occasion in my life.</P>

<P>Hold, my dear Doricourt! be not so rash. What will the world say to such —</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Damn the world! What will the world give me for the loss of happiness? Must I sacrifice my peace, to please the world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, every thing, rather than be branded with dishonour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though <HI>our</HI> arguments should fail, there <HI>is</HI> a Pleader, whom you surely cannot withstand—the dying Mr. Hardy supplicates you not to forsake his Child.</P>

<SPEAKER>Vill.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Hardy requests you to grant him a moment's

conversation, Mr. Doricourt, though you should persist so send him miserable to the grave. Let me conduct you to his chamber.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, aye, any where; to the Antipodes—to the Moon—Carry me—Do with me what you will.</P>

<P>Mortification and disappointment, then, are specifics in a case of stubbornness.—I'll follow, and let you know what passes.</P>

<P>Sir George, you don't know Mr. Saville.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exit Lady</HI> Frances.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ten thousand pardons—but I will not pardon myself, for not observing you. I have been with the ut∣most impatience at your door twice to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am concerned you had so much trouble, Sir George.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Trouble! what a word!—I hardly know how to address you; I am distressed beyond measure; and it is the highest proof of my opinion of your honour, and the delicacy of your mind, that I open my heart to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>What has disturbed you, Sir George?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your having preserved Lady Frances, in so imminent a danger. Start not, Saville; to protect Lady Frances, was my right. You have wrested from me my dearest privilege.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hardly know how to answer such a reproach. I cannot apologize for what I have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not mean to reproach you; I hardly know what I mean. There is one method by which you may restore peace to me; I cannot endure that my Wife should be so infinitely indebted to any man who is less than my Brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="77" REF="82"/>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray explain yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a Sister, Saville, who is amiable; and you are worthy of her, I shall give her a commission to steal your heart, out of revenge for what you have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am infinitely honoured, Sir George; but —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot listen to a sentence which begins with so unpromising a word. You must go with us into Hampshire; and, if you see each other with the eyes I do, your felicity will be complete. I know no one, to whose heart I would so readily commit the care of my Sister's happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will attend you to Hampshire, with pleasure; but not on the plan of retirement. Society has claims on Lady Frances, that forbid it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Claims, Saville!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, claims; Lady Frances was born to be the ornament of Courts. She is sufficiently alarmed, not to wander beyond the reach of her Protector;—and, from the British Court, the most tenderly-anxious Husband could not wish to banish his Wife. Bid her keep in her eye the bright Example who presides there; the splendour of whose rank yields to the superior lustre of her Virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I allow the force of your argument. Now for intelligence!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mrs.</HI> Racket, <HI>Lady</HI> Frances, <HI>and</HI> Flutter.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Heav'ns! do you know —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me tell the story—As soon as Doricourt—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I protest you sha'n't—said Mr. Hardy—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, 'twas Doricourt spoke first—says he—No, 'twas the Parson—says he —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stop his mouth, Sir George—he'll spoil the tale.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never heed circumstances—the result—the result.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; you shall have it in form.—Mr. Hardy performed the Sick Man like an Angel—He sat
<PB N="78" REF="83"/>
up in his bed, and talked so pathetically, that the tears stood in Doricourt's eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, stood—they did not drop, but stood.—I shall, in future, be very exact. The Parson seized the moment; you know, they never miss an opportunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Make haste, said Doricourt; if I have time to reflect, poor Hardy will die unhappy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were got as far as the Day of Judgement, when we slipt out of the room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, by this time, they must have reached <HI>Amazement,</HI> which, every body knows, is the end of Ma∣trimony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, the Reverend Fathers ended the ser∣vice with that word, Prophetically—to teach the Bride what a capricious Monster a Husband is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rather think it was Sarcastically—to prepare the Bridegroom for the unreasonable humours and vaga∣ries of his Help-mate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here comes the Bridegroom of to-night.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Doricourt <HI>and</HI> Villers.—Villers <HI>whispers</HI> Saville, <HI>who goes out.</HI></STAGE>

<P>Joy! joy! joy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>If <HI>he</HI>'s a sample of Bridegrooms, keep me single!—A younger Brother, from the Funeral of his Fa∣ther, could not carry a more fretful countenance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh!—Now, he's melancholy mad, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do not consider the importance of the occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vill.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; nor how shocking a thing it is for a Man to be forced to marry one Woman, whilst his heart is de∣voted to another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, now 'tis over, I confess to you, Mr. Doricourt, I think 'twas a most ridiculous piece of Quixotism, to give up the happiness of a whole life to a Man who perhaps has but a few moments to be sensi∣ble of the sacrifice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="79" REF="84"/>
<SPEAKER>Flut.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it appeared to me.—But, thought I, Mr. Doricourt has travelled—he knows best.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! Confusion!—Did ye not all set upon me?—Didn't ye talk to me of Honour—Compassion— Justice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true—You have acted according to their dictates, and I hope the utmost felicity of the Married State will reward you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never, Sir George! To Felicity I bid adieu— but I will endeavour to be content. Where is my—I must speak it—where is my <HI>Wife?</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Vill.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whoever you are, Madam, you could not have arrived at a happier moment.—Mr. Doricourt is just mar∣ried.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Let.</SPEAKER>
<P>Married! Impossible! 'Tis but a few hours since he swore to me eternal Love: I believ'd him, gave him up my Virgin heart—and now!—Ungrateful Sex!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Virgin heart! No, Lady—my fate, thank Heaven! yet wants that torture. Nothing but the conviction that you was another's, could have made me think one moment of Marriage, to have saved the lives of half Mankind. But this visit, Madam, is as barbarous as unexpected. It is now my duty to forget you, which, spite of your situation, I found difficult enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Let.</SPEAKER>
<P>My situation!—What situation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must apologise for explaining it in this company —but, Madam, I am not ignorant, that you are the com∣panion of Lord George Jennet—and this is the only cir∣cumstance that can give me peace.</P>

<P>Who, she? O Lard! no—'Twas quite a different person that I meant.—I never saw that Lady before.</P>

<P>Murder him! Yes, you, myself, and all Man∣kind. Sir George—Saville—Villers—'twas you who push'd me on this precipice;—'tis you who have snatch'd from me joy, felicity, and life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>There! Now, how well he acts the Mad∣man!—This is something like! I knew he would do it well enough, when the time came.</P>

<P>Hard-hearted Woman! enjoy my ruin—riot in my wretchedness. <STAGE>Hardy <HI>bursts in.</HI></STAGE></P>

<P>This is too much. You are now the Husband of my Daughter; and how dare you shew all this passion about another Woman?</P>

<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alive again!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alive! aye, and merry. Here, wipe off the flour from my face. I was never in better health and spirits in my life.—I foresaw t'would do—.Why, my illness was only a fetch, Man! to make you marry Letty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was! Base and ungenerous! Well, Sir, you shall be gratified. The possession of my heart was no ob∣ject either with You, or your Daughter. My fortune and name was all you desired, and these—I leave ye. My native England I shall quit, nor ever behold you more. But, Lady, that in my exile I may have one consolation, grant me the favour you denied last night;—let me behold
<PB N="81" REF="86"/>
all that mask conceals, that your whole image may be im∣press'd on my heart, and chear my distant solitary hours.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vill.</SPEAKER>
<P>This scheme was mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Let.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not allow that. This little stratagem arose from my disappointment, in not having made the impres∣sion on you I wish'd. The timidity of the English cha∣racter threw a veil over me, you could not penetrate. You have forced me to emerge in some measure from my natural reserve, and to throw off the veil that hid me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am yet in a state of intoxication—I cannot an∣swer you.—Speak on, sweet Angel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Let.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see I <HI>can</HI> be any thing; chuse then my cha∣racter—your Taste shall fix it. Shall I be an <HI>English</HI> Wife?—or, breaking from the bonds of Nature and Edu∣cation, step forth to the world in all the captivating glare of Foreign Manners?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall be nothing but yourself—nothing can be captivating that you are not. I will not wrong your penetration, by pretending that you won my heart at the first interview; but you have now my whole soul—your person, your face, your mind, I would not exchange for those of any other Woman breathing.</P>

<P>No, congratulate me, that I have escaped with life, and give me some sticking plaster—this wild cat has torn the skin from my throat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I expect to be among the first who are con∣gratulated—for I have recovered one Angel, while Dori∣court has gained another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho! pho! Don't talk of Angels, we shall be happier by half as Mortals. Come into the next room; I have order'd out every drop of my Forty-eight, and I'll invite the whole parish of St. George's, but what we'll drink it out—except one dozen, which I shall keep under three double locks, for a certain Christening, that I fore∣see will happen within this twelvemonth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>My charming Bride! It was a strange perver∣sion of Taste, that led me to consider the delicate timidity of your deportment, as the mark of an uninform'd mind, or inelegant manners. I feel now it is to that innate modesty, <HI>English</HI> Husbands owe a felicity the Married Men of other nations are strangers to: it is a sacred veil to your own charms; it is the surest bulwark to your Husband's honour; and cursed be the hour—should it ever arrive— in which <HI>British</HI> Ladies shall sacrifice to <HI>foreign Graces</HI> the Grace of Modesty!</P>

<L>NAY cease, and hear me—I am come to scold—</L>
<L>Whence this night's plaudits, to a thought so old?</L>
<L>To gain a Lover, hid behind a Mask!</L>
<L>What's new in that? or where's the mighty task?</L>
<L>For instance, now—What Lady Bab, or Grace,</L>
<L>E'er won a Lover—in her <HI>natural</HI> Face?</L>
<L>Mistake me not—French red, or blanching creams,</L>
<L>I stoop not to—for those are hackney'd themes;</L>

<L>Easier put on, and worn to more effect;—</L>

<L>Do Pride and Envy, with their horrid lines,</L>
<L>Destroy th' effect of Nature's sweet designs?</L>
<L>The Mask of Softness is at once applied,</L>

<L>Do thoughts too free inform the Vestal's eye,</L>
