<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following memoir is nei∣ther calculated to enflame the reader's passions with descriptions of gallantry, nor to gratify his malevo∣lence with details of scandal. The amours of coxcombs, and the pur∣suits of debauchees, are as destitute of novelty to attract us as they are of va∣riety to entertain, they still present us but the same picture, a picture we have seen a thousand times repeated. The life of Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> is incapable of sup∣plying any entertainment of this na∣ture to a prurient curiosity. Tho' it was past in the very midst of de∣bauchery, he practised but few of those vices he was often obliged to
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
assent to. Tho' he lived where gal∣lantry was the capital pursuit, he was never known to favour it by his ex∣ample, and what authority he had was set to oppose it. Instead therefore of a romantic history filled with warm pictures and fanciful adventures, the reader of the following account must rest satisfied with a genuine and can∣did recital compiled from the papers he left behind, and others equally au∣thentic; a recital neither written with a spirit of satire nor panegyric, and with scarce any other art, than that of arranging the materials in their natural order.</P>
<P>But tho' little art has been used, it is hoped that some entertainment may be collected from the life of a person so much talked of, and yet so little
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
known as Mr. <HI>Nash.</HI> The history of a man, who for more than fifty years presided over the pleasures of a polite kingdom, and whose life, tho' without any thing to surprise, was ever marked with singularity, de∣serves the attention of the present age; the pains he took in pur∣suing pleasure, and the solemnity he assumed in adjusting trifles, may one day claim the smile of posterity. At least such an history is well e∣nough calculated to supply a vacant hour with innocent amusement, how∣ever it may fail to open the heart, or improve the understanding.</P>
<P>Yet his life, how trifling soever it may appear to the inattentive, was not without its real advantages to the public. He was the first who dif∣fused a desire of society, and an easi∣ness
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
of address among a whole peo∣ple who were formerly censured by foreigners for a reservedness of beha∣viour, and an aukward timidity in their first approaches. He first taught a familiar intercourse among strangers at <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> which still subsists among them. That ease and open acccess first ac∣quired there, our gentry brought back to the metropolis, and thus the whole kingdom by degrees became more refined by lessons originally de∣rived from him.</P>
<P>Had it been my design to have made this history more pleasing at the expence of truth, it had been easily performed, but I chose to de∣scribe the man as he was, not such as imagination could have helped
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>
in compleating his picture; he will be found to be a weak man, governing weaker subjects, and may be considered as resembling a mo∣narch of <HI>Cappadocia,</HI> whom <HI>Cicero</HI> somewhere calls, <HI>the little king of a little people.</HI></P>
<P>But while I have been careful in describing the monarch, his domini∣ons have claimed no small share of my attention; I have given an exact account of the rise, regulation, and nature of the amusements of the city of <HI>Bath,</HI> how far Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> contribu∣ted to establish and refine them, and what pleasure a stranger may expect there upon his arrival. Such anec∣dotes as are at once true and worth preserving are produced in their or∣der, and some stories are added,
<PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
which, tho' commonly known, more necessarily belong to this history, than to the places from whence they have been extracted. But it is needless to point out the pains that have been taken, or the entertainment that may be expected from the perusal of this performance. It is but an indiffer∣ent way to gain the reader's esteem, to be my own panegyrist, nor is this preface so much designed to lead him to beauties, as to demand par∣don for defects.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF RICHARD NASH, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>ISTORY owes its excellence more to the writer's manner than the materials of which it is composed. The intrigues of courts, or the devastation of armies are re∣garded by the remote spectator with as little attention as the squabbles of a village, or the fate of a malefactor, that fall under his own observation. The great and the little, as they have the same senses, and
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
the same affections, generally present the same picture to the hand of the draughts∣man; and whether the heroe or the clown be the subject of the memoir, it is only man that appears with all his native mi∣nuteness about him, for nothing very great was ever yet formed from the little ma∣terials of humanity.</P>
<P>Thus none can properly be said to write history, but he who understands the hu∣man heart, and its whole train of affec∣tions and follies. Those affections and follies are properly the materials he has to work upon. The relations of great events may surprize indeed; they may be cal∣culated to instruct those very few, who govern the million beneath, but the ge∣nerality of mankind find the most real improvement from relations which are levelled to the general surface of life; which tell, not how men learned to con∣quer, but how they endeavoured to live; not how they gained the shout of the admiring croud, but how they acquired
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
the esteem of their friends and acquaint∣ance.</P>
<P>Every man's own life would perhaps furnish the most pleasing materials for history, if he only had candour enough to be sincere, and skill enough to select such parts as once making him more prudent, might serve to render his readers more cautious. There are few who do not prefer a page of <HI>Montaigne</HI> or <HI>Colley Cibber,</HI> who candidly tells us what they thought of the world, and the world thought of them, to the more stately memoirs and trans∣actions of <HI>Europe,</HI> where we see Kings pretending to immortality, that are now almost forgotten, and statesmen planning frivolous negociations, that scarce outlive the signing.</P>
<P>It were to be wished that ministers and Kings were left to write their own histo∣ries; they are truly useful to few but them∣selves; but for men who are contented with more humble stations, I fancy such truths only are serviceable as may conduct
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
them safely through life. That know∣ledge which we can turn to our real benefit should be most eagerly pursued. Treasures which we cannot use but little encrease the happiness or even the pride of the possessor.</P>
<P>I profess to write the history of a man placed in the middle ranks of life; of one, whose vices and virtues were open to the eye of the most undiscerning spectator, who was placed in public view without power to repress censure, or command adulation, who had too much merit not to become remarkable, yet too much folly to arrive at greatness. I attempt the character of one, who was just such a man as probably you or I may be, but with this difference, that he never performed an action which the world did not know, or ever formed a wish which he did not take pains to divulge. In short I have chosen to write the life of the noted Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> as it will be the delineation of a mind without disguise, of a man ever assiduous without industry, and pleasing
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
to his superiors without any superiority of genius or understanding.</P>
<P>Yet if there be any who think the sub∣ject of too little importance to command attention, and had rather gaze at the ac∣tions of the great, than be directed in guiding their own, I have one undeniable claim to their attention. Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> was himself a King. In this particular, per∣haps no Biographer has been so happy as I. They who are for a delineation of men and manners may find some satisfac∣tion that way, and those who delight in adventures of Kings and Queens, may perhaps find their hopes satisfied in ano∣ther.</P>
<P>It is a matter of very little importance who were the parents, or what was the edu∣cation of a man who owed so little of his advancement to either. He seldom boasted of family or learning, and his father's name and circumstances were so little known, that Doctor <HI>Cheyne</HI> used frequently to affirm that <HI>Nash</HI> had no father. The
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
Dutchess of <HI>Marlborough</HI> one day rallying him in public company upon the obscu∣rity of his birth, compared him to <HI>Gil-Blas,</HI> who was ashamed of his father: No, Madam, replied <HI>Nash,</HI> I seldom mention my father in company, not because I have any reason to be ashamed of him; but because he has some reason to be ashamed of me.</P>
<P>However, though such anecdotes be immaterial, to go on in the usual course of history, it may be proper to observe that <HI>Richard Nash</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>; the subject of this memoir, was born in the town of <HI>Swan-sea,</HI> in <HI>Glamorganshire,</HI> on the 18th of <HI>October,</HI> in the year 1674. His father was a gentleman, whose principal income arose from a partnership in a glass-house; his mother was niece to Colonel <HI>Poyer,</HI> who was killed by <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> for defending <HI>Pembroke</HI> castle against the re∣bels. He was educated under Mr. <HI>Mad∣docks</HI> at <HI>Carmarthan</HI> school, and from thence sent to <HI>Jesus</HI> college, in <HI>Oxford,</HI> in order to prepare him for the study
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
of the law. His father had strained his little income to give his son such an education, but from the boy's natural vivacity, he hoped a recompence from his future preferment. In college, how∣ever, he soon shewed that though much might be expected from his genius, no∣thing could be hoped from his industry. A mind strongly turned to pleasure, al∣ways is first seen at the university, there the youth first finds himself freed from the restraint of tutors, and being treated by his friends in some measure as a man, assumes the passions and desires of riper age, and discovers in the boy, what are likely to be the affections of his matu∣rity.</P>
<P>The first method Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> took to dis∣tinguish himself at college was not by ap∣plication to study, but by his assiduity in intrigue. In the neighbourhood of every university there are girls who with some beauty, some coquettry, and little fortune, lie upon the watch for every raw amorous youth, more inclined to make love than
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
to study. Our Heroe was quickly caught, and went through all the mazes and ad∣ventures of a college intrigue, before he was seventeen; he offered marriage, the offer was accepted, but the whole affair com∣ing to the knowledge of his tutors, his happiness, or perhaps his future misery, was prevented, and he was sent home from college, with necessary advice to him, and proper instructions to his father.</P>
<P>When a man knows his power over the fair sex, he generally commences their admirer for the rest of life. That tri∣umph which he obtains over one, only makes him the slave of another, and thus he proceeds conquering and conquered, to the closing of the scene. The army seemed the most likely profession in which to display this inclination for gallantry; he therefore purchased a pair of colours, commenced a professed admirer of the sex, and dressed to the very edge of his finances. But the life of a soldier is more pleasing to the spectator at a distance than to the person who makes the experiment.
<PB N="9" REF="17"/>
Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> soon found that a red coat alone would never succeed, that the company of the fair sex is not to be procured without expence, and that his scanty commission could never procure him the proper re∣imbursements. He found too that the profession of arms required attendance and duty, and often encroached upon those hours he could have wished to dedicate to softer purposes. In short, he soon be∣came disgusted with the life of a soldier, quitted the army, entered his name as a student in the temple books, and here went to the very summit of second-rate luxury. Though very poor he was very fine; he spread the little gold he had, in the most ostentatious manner, and though the gild∣ing was but thin, he laid it on as far as it would go. They who know the town, cannot be unacquainted with such a cha∣racter as I describe; one, who though he may have dined in private upon a banquet served cold from a cook's shop, shall dress at six for the side box; one of those, whose wants are only known to their laundress, and tradesmen, and their fine
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
cloaths to half the nobility; who spend more in chair hire, than housekeeping; and prefer a bow from a Lord, to a din∣ner from a Commoner.</P>
<P>In this manner Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> spent some years about town, till at last his genteel appearance, his constant civility, and still more, his assiduity, gained him the ac∣quaintance of several persons qualified to lead the fashion both by birth and fortune. To gain the friendship of the young no∣bility little more is requisite than much submission and very fine cloaths; dress has a mechanical influence upon the mind, and we naturally are awed into respect and esteem at the elegance of those, whom even our reason would teach us to contemn. He seemed early sensible of human weak∣ness in this respect, he brought a person genteely dressed to every assembly, he always made one of those who are called very good company, and assurance gave him an air of elegance and ease.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="19"/>When King <HI>William</HI> was upon the throne, Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> was a member of the <HI>Middle Temple.</HI> It had been long customary for the Inns of court to entertain our Monarchs upon their accession to the crown, or some such remarkable occasion, with a revel and pageant. In the earlier periods of our history, Poets were the conductors of these entertainments; plays were exhibited, and complimentary verses were then written; but by degrees the pageant alone was con∣tinued, Sir <HI>John Davis</HI> being the last poet that wrote verses upon such an occasion in the reign of <HI>James</HI> I.</P>
<P>This ceremony which has been at length totally discontinued, was last exhibited in honour of King <HI>William,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> was chosen to conduct the whole with proper decorum. He was then but a very young man, but we see at how early an age he was thought proper to guide the amusements of his country, and be the <HI>Arbiter Elegantiarum</HI> of his time; we see how early he gave proofs of that spirit of regularity, for which he afterwards became
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
famous, and shewed an attention to those little circumstances, of which tho' the ob∣servance be trifling, the neglect has often interrupted men of the greatest abilities in the progress of their fortunes.</P>
<P>In conducting this entertainment, <HI>Nash</HI> had an opportunity of exhibiting all his abilities, and King <HI>William</HI> was so well satisfied with his performance, that he made him an offer of knighthood. This, however, he thought proper to refuse, which in a person of his disposition seems strange. <HI>Please your Majesty,</HI> replied he, when the offer was made him, <HI>if you intend to make me a Knight, I wish it may be one of your poor Knights of</HI> Windsor, <HI>and then I shall have a fortune, at least able to support my title.</HI> Yet we do not find, that the King took the hint of encreasing his fortune, perhaps he could not, he had at that time numbers to oblige, and he never cared to give money without important services.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="21"/>But though <HI>Nash</HI> acquired no riches by his late office, yet he gained many friends, or what is more easily obtained, many acquaintance, who often answer the end as well. In the populous city where he resided, to be known was almost synoni∣mous with being in the road to fortune. How many little Things do we see, with∣out merit, or without friends, push them∣selves forward into public notice, and by self-advertizing, attract the attention of the day. The wise despise them, but the public are not all wise. Thus they succeed, rise upon the wing of folly, or of fashion, and by their success give a new sanction to effrontery.</P>
<P>But beside his assurance, Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> had in reality some merit and some virtues. He was, if not a brilliant, at least an easy companion. He never forgot good man∣ners, even in the highest warmth of fa∣miliarity, and as I hinted before, never went in a dirty shirt to disgrace the table of his patron or his friend. These qua∣lifications might make the furniture of his
<PB N="14" REF="22"/>
head; but for his heart, that seemed an assemblage of the virtues which display an honest benevolent mind; with the vices which spring from too much good nature. He had pity for every creature's distress, but wanted prudence in the application of his benefits. He had generosity for the wretched in the highest degree, at a time when his creditors complained of his jus∣tice. He often spoke falshoods, but never had any of his harmless tales tinctured with malice.</P>
<P>An instance of his humanity is told us in the Spectator, though his name is not mentioned. When he was to give in his accompts to the masters of the tem∣ple, among other articles, he charged <HI>For making one man happy</HI> 10<HI>l.</HI> Being questioned about the meaning of so strange an item, he frankly declared, that hap∣pening to over-hear a poor man declare to his wife and a large family of children, that 10<HI>l.</HI> would make him happy, he could not avoid trying the experiment. He added, that if they did not chuse to
<PB N="15" REF="23"/>
acquiesce in his charge, he was ready to refund the money. The masters struck with such an uncommon instance of good nature, publicly thanked him for his be∣nevolence, and desired that the sum might be doubled as a proof of their satisfaction.</P>
<P>Another instance of his unaccountable generosity, and I shall proceed. In some transactions with one of his friends, Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> was brought in debtor twenty pounds. His friend frequently asked for the money, and was as often denied. He found at last, that assiduity was likely to have no effect, and therefore contrived an ho∣nourable method of getting back his mo∣ney without dissolving the friendship that subsisted between them. One day, re∣turning from <HI>Nash</HI>'s chamber with the usual assurance of being paid to morrow, he went to one of their mutual acquaint∣ance, and related the frequent disappoint∣ments he had received, and the little hopes he had of being ever paid.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My design, continues he, is that you should go, and try to borrow twenty pounds from <HI>Nash,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="24"/>
and bring me the money. I am apt to think, he will lend to you, tho' he will not pay me. Perhaps we may extort from his generosity, what I have failed to receive from his justice."</Q>
His friend obeys, and going to Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> assured him, that, unless relieved by his friendship, he should certainly be undone; he wanted to borrow twenty pounds; and had tried all his acquaintance without success. Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> who had but some minutes before, refused to pay a just debt, was in raptures at thus giving an instance of his friendship, and instantly lent what was required. Im∣mediately upon the receipt, the pretended borrower goes to the real creditor, and gives him the money, who met Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> the day after: our heroe upon seeing him, immediately began his usual excuses, that the billiard room had stript him, that he was never so damnably out of cash, but that in a few days—My dear Sir, be under no uneasiness, replied the other, I would not interrupt your tranquillity for the world, you lent twenty pounds yester∣day to our friend of the back stairs, and
<PB N="17" REF="25"/>
he lent it to me, give him your receipt, and you shall have mine.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"perdition seize <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e, cried <HI>Nash,</HI> thou hast been too many for me. You demanded a debt, he asked a favour; to pay thee, would not encrease our friendship, but to lend him, was procuring a new friend, by conferring a new obligation.</Q></P>
<P>Whether men at the time I am now talking of, had more wit than at present, I will not take upon me to determine; but certain it is, they took more pains to shew what they had. In that age, a fel∣low of high humour would drink no wine, but what was strained through his mis∣tresses smock. He would eat a pair of her shoes tossed up in a fricasee. He would swallow tallow-candles instead of toasted cheese, and even run naked about town, as it was then said, to divert the ladies. In short, that was the age of such kind of wit as is the most distant of all others from wisdom.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="26"/>Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> as he sometimes played tricks with others, upon certain occa∣sions, received very severe retaliations. Be∣ing at <HI>York,</HI> and having lost all his mo∣ney; some of his companions agreed to equip him with fifty guineas, upon this proviso, that he would stand at the great door of the Minster, in a blanket, as the people were coming out of church. To this proposal he readily agreed, but the Dean passing by unfortunately knew him. What, cried the Divine, Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> in masquerade? <HI>Only a</HI> Yorkshire <HI>penance, Mr. Dean, for keeping bad company,</HI> says <HI>Nash,</HI> pointing to his companions.</P>
<P>Some time after this, he won a wager of still greater consequence, by riding naked through a village upon a cow. This was then thought an harmless frolic, at present it would be looked upon with detestation.</P>
<P>He was once invited by some gen∣tlemen of the navy, on board a man of war, that had sailing orders for the medi∣terranean.
<PB N="19" REF="27"/>
This was soon after the affair of the revels, and being ignorant of any design against him, he took his bottle with freedom. But he soon found, to use the expression then in fashion, that he was absolutely <HI>bitten.</HI> The ship sailed away before he was aware of his situation, and he was obliged to make the voyage in the company where he had spent the night.</P>
<P>Many lives are often passed without a single adventure, and I do not know of any in the life of our hero, that can be called such, except what we are now re∣lating. During this voyage, he was in an engagement, in which his particular friend was killed by his side, and he himself wounded in the leg. For the anecdote of his being wounded, we are solely to trust to his own veracity; but most of his acquaintance were not much inclined to believe him, when he boasted on those occasions. Telling one day of the wound he had received for his country, in one of the public rooms at <HI>Bath,</HI> (<HI>Wiltshire</HI>'s
<PB N="20" REF="28"/>
if I don't forget) a lady of distinction, that sat by, said it was all false. I protest, Madam, replied he, it is true, and if I cannot be believed, your Ladyship may, if you please, receive farther information and feel the ball in my leg.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> was now fairly for life en∣tered into a new course of gaiety and dissi∣pation, and steady in nothing but in pur∣suit of variety. He was thirty years old, without fortune, or useful talents to ac∣quire one. He had hitherto only led a life of expedients, he thanked chance alone for his support, and having been long precariously supported, he became, at length, totally a stranger to prudence, or precaution. Not to disguise any part of his character, he was now, by profession, a gamester, and went on from day to day, feeling the vicissitudes of rapture and an∣guish, in proportion to the fluctuations of fortune.</P>
<P>At this time, <HI>London</HI> was the only the∣atre in <HI>England,</HI> for pleasure, or intrigue.
<PB N="21" REF="29"/>
A spirit of gaming, had been introduced in the licentious age of <HI>Charles</HI> II. and had by this time thriven surprizingly. Yet all its devastations were confined to <HI>London</HI> alone. To this great mart of every folly, sharpers from every country daily arrived, for the winter, but were obliged to leave the kingdom at the approach of summer, in order to open a new cam∣paign at <HI>Aix, Spaw,</HI> or the <HI>Hague. Bath, Tunbridge, Scarborough,</HI> and other places of the same kind here, were then fre∣quented only by such as really went for relief; the pleasures they afforded were merely rural, the company splenetic, rus∣tic, and vulgar. In this situation of things, people of fashion had no agreeable sum∣mer retreat from the town, and usually spent that season amidst a solitude of coun∣try squires, parsons wives, and visiting te∣nants, or farmers; they wanted some place where they might have each others com∣pany, and win each others money, as they had done during the winter in town.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="30"/>To a person, who does not thus calmly trace things to their source, nothing will appear more strange, than how the healthy could ever consent to follow the sick to those places of spleen, and live with those, whose disorders are ever apt to excite a gloom in the spectator. The truth is, the gaming table was properly the salutary font, to which such numbers flocked. Gaming will ever be the pleasure of the rich, while men continue to be men, while they fancy more happiness in being possessed of what they want, than they experience pleasure in the fruition of what they have. The wealthy only stake those riches, which give no real content, for an expectation of riches, in which they hope for satisfaction. By this calculation, they cannot lose happiness, as they begin with none; and they hope to gain it, by being possessed of something they have not had already.</P>
<P>Probably upon this principle; and by the arrival of Queen <HI>Anne</HI> there for her health, About the year 1703, the city of
<PB N="23" REF="31"/>
<HI>Bath</HI> became in some measure frequented by people of distinction. The company was numerous enough to form a country dance upon the bowling green; they were amused with a fiddle and hautboy, and diverted with the romantic walks round the city. They usually sauntered in fine wea∣ther in the grove, between two rows of sycamore trees. Several learned Physici∣ans, Doctor <HI>Jordan,</HI> and others had even then praised the salubrity of the wells, and the amusements were put under the direction of a master of the ceremonies.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Webster</HI> was the predecessor of Mr. <HI>Nash:</HI> This I take to be the same gentleman, whom Mr. <HI>Lucas</HI> describes in his history of the lives of the gamesters, by which it appears, that <HI>Bath,</HI> even be∣fore the arrival of Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> was found a proper retreat for men of that profes∣sion. This gentleman, in the year 1704, carried the balls to the town hall, each man paying half a guinea each ball.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="32"/>Still however, the amusements of this place were neither elegant, nor conducted with delicacy. General society among people of rank or fortune was by no means established. The nobility still pre∣served a tincture of <HI>Gothic</HI> haughtiness, and refused to keep company with the gentry at any of the public entertainments of the place. Smoaking in the rooms was per∣mitted; gentlemen and ladies appeared in a disrespectful manner at public en∣tertainments in aprons and boots. With an eagerness common to those, whose pleasures come but seldom, they generally continued them too long, and thus they were rendered disgusting by too free an enjoyment. If the company liked each other they danced till morning, if any person lost at cards, he insisted on conti∣nuing the game till luck should turn. The lodgings for visitants were paltry, though expensive, the dining rooms and other chambers were floored with boards coloured brown with foot and small beer, to hide the dirt; the walls were covered with unpainted wainscot, the furniture
<PB N="25" REF="33"/>
corresponded with the meanness of the architecture; a few oak chairs, a small looking glass, with a fender and tongs, composed the magnificence of these tem∣porary habitations. The city was in itself mean and contemptible, no elegant build∣ings, no open streets, nor uniform squares. The Pump-house was without any di∣rector; the chairmen permitted no gen∣tlemen or ladies to walk home by night without insulting them; and to add to all this, one of the greatest Phy∣sicians of his age conceived a design of ruining the city, by writing against the efficacy of the waters. It was from a resentment of some affronts he had re∣ceived there, that he took this resolution; and accordingly published a pamphlet, by which he said, <HI>he would cast a toad into the spring.</HI></P>
<P>In this situation of things it was, that Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> first came into that city, and hearing the threat of this Physician, he humorously assured the people that if they would give him leave, he would
<PB N="26" REF="34"/>
charm away the poison of the Doctor's toad, as they usually charmed the venom of the Tarantula, by music. He therefore was immediately empowered to set up the force of a band of music, against the poison of the Doctor's reptile; the company very sensibly encreased, <HI>Nash</HI> triumphed, and the sovereignty of the city was de∣creed to him by every rank of people.</P>
<P>We are now to behold this gentleman as arrived at a new dignity for which na∣ture seemed to have formed him; we are to see him directing pleasures, which none had better learned to share; placed over rebellious and refractory subjects that were to be ruled only by the force of his address, and governing such as had been long ac∣customed to govern others. We see a kingdom begining with him, and sending off <HI>Tunbridge</HI> as one of its colonies.</P>
<P>But to talk more simply, when we talk at best of trifles. None could possibly conceive a person more fit to fill this em∣ployment than <HI>Nash</HI>: He had some wit,
<PB N="27" REF="35"/>
as I have said once or twice before; but it was of that sort which is rather happy than permanent. Once a week he might say a good thing, this the little ones about him took care to divulge; or if they hap∣pened to forget the joke, he usually re∣membered to repeat it himself: In a long intercourse with the world he had ac∣quired an impenetrable assurance; and the freedom with which he was received by the Great, furnished him with vicacity which could be commanded at any time, and which some mistook for wit. His former intercourse among people of fashion in town, had let him into most of the characters of the nobility; and he was ac∣quainted with many of their private in∣trigues. He understood rank and prece∣dence, with the utmost exactness, was fond of shew and finery himself, and generally set a pattern of it to others. These were his favourite talents, and he was the fa∣vourite of such as had no other.</P>
<P>But to balance these which some may consider as foibles, he was charitable him∣self,
<PB N="28" REF="36"/>
and generally shamed his betters in∣to a similitude of sentiment, if they were not naturally so before. He was fond of advising those young men, who, by youth and too much money, are taught to look upon extravagance as a virtue. He was an enemy to rudeness in others, though in the latter part of his life he did not much seem to encourage a dislike of it by his own example. None talked with more humanity of the foibles of others, when absent, than he, nor kept those secrets with which he was entrusted more inviolably. But above all (if mora∣lists will allow it among the number of his virtues) tho' he gamed high, he always play∣ed very fairly. These were his qualifications. Some of the nobility regarded him as an inoffensive, useful companion, the size of whose understanding was, in general, level with their own; but their little imitators admired him as a person of fine sense, and great good breeding. Thus people became fond of ranking him in the number of their acquaintance, told over his jests, and Beau
<PB N="29" REF="37"/>
<HI>Nash</HI> at length became the fashionable companion.</P>
<P>His first care when made master of the ceremonies, or king of <HI>Bath,</HI> as it is called, was to promote a music subscription, of one guinea each, for a band which was to consist of six performers, who were to receive a guinea a week each for their trouble. He allowed also two guineas a week for lighting and sweeping the rooms, for which he accounted to the subscribers by receipt.</P>
<P>The Pump-house was immediately put under the care of an officer, by the name of the <HI>Pumper</HI>; for which he paid the corporation an annual rent. A row of new houses was begun on the south side of the gravel walks, before which a hand∣some pavement was then made for the company to walk on. Not less than seven∣teen or eighteen hundred pounds was raised this year, and in the beginning of 1706, by subscription, and laid out in repairing the roads near the city. The
<PB N="30" REF="38"/>
streets began to be better paved, cleaned and lighted, the licenses of the Chair∣men were repressed, and by an act of par∣liament procured on this occasion, the in∣valids, who came to drink or bathe, were exempted from all manner of toll, as often as they should go out of the city for recreation.</P>
<P>The houses and streets now began to improve, and ornaments were lavished upon them even to profusion. But in the midst of this splendor the company still were obliged to assemble in a booth to drink tea and chocolate, or to game. Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> undertook to remedy this incon∣venience. By his direction, one <HI>Thomas Harrison</HI> erected a handsome Assembly-house for these purposes. A better band of music was also procured, and the for∣mer subscription of one guinea, was raised to two. <HI>Harrison</HI> had three guineas a week for the room and candles, and the music two guineas a man. The money Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> received and accounted for with the utmost exactness and punctuality.
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>
To this house were also added gardens for people of rank and fashion to walk in; and the beauty of the suburbs continued to encrease, notwithstanding the opposition that was made by the corporation, who at that time, looked upon every useful improvement particularly without the walls, as dangerous to the inhabitants within.</P>
<P>His dominion was now extensive and secure, and he determined to support it with the strictest attention. But in order to proceed in every thing like a king, he was resolved to give his subjects a law, and the following rules were accordingly put up in the Pump-room.<Q><LIST>
<HEAD>RULES to be observ'd at BATH.</HEAD>
<ITEM>1. THAT a visit of ceremony at first coming and another at go∣ing away, are all that are expected or de∣sired, by ladies of quality and fashion,—except impertinents.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="32" REF="40"/>2. That ladies coming to the ball ap∣point a time for their footmen coming to wait on them home, to prevent distur∣bance and inconveniencies to themselves and others.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That gentlemen of fashion never appearing in a morning before the ladies in gowns and caps, shew breeding and respect.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That no person take it ill that any one goes to another's play, or breakfast, and not theirs;—except captious by nature.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That no gentleman give his ticket for the balls, to any but gentlewomen.—N.B. Unless he has none of his acquain∣tance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That gentlemen crowding before the ladies at the ball, shew ill manners; and that none do so for the future,—except such as respect nobody but themselves.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="33" REF="41"/>7. That no gentleman or lady takes it ill that another dances before them;—ex∣cept such as have no pretence to dance at all.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. That the elder ladies and children be content with a second bench at the ball, as being past or not come to perfection.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. That the younger ladies take notice how many eyes observe them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>N. B. This does not extend to the <HI>Have-at-alls.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>10. That all whisperers of lies and scandal, be taken for their authors.</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. That all repeaters of such lies, and scandal be shun'd by all company;—ex∣cept such as have been guilty of the same crime.</ITEM>
</LIST><P><HI>N. B. Several men of no character, old women and young ones, of question'd reputa∣tion, are great authors of lies in these places, being of the sect of levellers.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>These laws were written by Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> himself, and by the manner in which they are drawn up, he undoubtedly de∣signed them for wit. The reader, how∣ever,
<PB N="34" REF="42"/>
it is feared, will think them dull. Poor <HI>Nash</HI> was not born a writer; for whatever humour he might have in con∣versation, he used to call a pen his tor∣pedo, whenever he grasped it, it numb∣ed all his faculties.</P>
<P>But were we to give laws to a nursery, we should make them childish laws; his statutes, tho' stupid, were addressed to fine gentlemen and ladies, and were pro∣bably received with sympathetic approba∣tion. It is certain, they were in general religiously observed by his subjects, and executed by him with impartiality, nei∣ther rank nor fortune shielded the refractory from his resentment.</P>
<P>The balls by his directions were to be∣gin at six, and to end at eleven. Nor would he suffer them to continue a moment longer, lest invalids might commit irregu∣larities, to counteract the benefit of the waters. Every thing was to be perform∣ed in proper order. Each ball was to open with a minuet, danced by two per∣sons
<PB N="35" REF="43"/>
of the highest distinction present. When the minuet concluded, the lady was to return to her seat, and Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> was to bring the gentleman a new partner. This ceremony was to be observed by every succeeding couple, every gentleman being obliged to dance with two ladies till the minuets were over, which generally continued two hours. At eight the coun∣try dances were to begin, ladies of quality, according to their rank, standing up first. About nine o' clock a short interval was allowed for rest, and for the gentlemen to help their partners to tea. That over, the company were to pursue their amuse∣ments till the clock struck eleven. Then the master of the ceremonies entering the ball-room, ordered the music to desist by lifting up his finger. The dances discon∣tinued, and some time allowed for be∣coming cool, the ladies were handed to their chairs.</P>
<P>Even the royal family themselves had not influence enough to make him deviate from any of these rules. The princess
<PB N="36" REF="44"/>
<HI>Amelia</HI> once applying to him for one dance more, after he had given the signal to withdraw, he assured her royal highness, that the established rules of <HI>Bath</HI> resembled the laws of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> which would admit of no alteration, without an utter subver∣sion of all his authority.</P>
<P>He was not less strict with regard to the dresses, in which ladies and gentlemen were to appear. He had the strongest aver∣sion to a white apron, and absolutely ex∣cluded all who ventured to appear at the assembly dressed in that manner. I have known him on a ball night strip even the dutchess of <HI>Q—,</HI> and throw her apron at one of the hinder benches among the ladies women; observing, that none but <HI>Abigails</HI> appeared in white aprons. This from another would be insult, in him it was considered as a just reprimand; and the good-natured dutchess acquiesced in his censure.</P>
<P>But he found more difficulty in attack∣ing the gentlemens irregularities; and for
<PB N="37" REF="45"/>
some time strove, but in vain, to prohibit the use of swords. Disputes arising from love or play, were sometimes attended with fatal effects. To use his own expres∣sion, he was resolved to hinder people from doing, <HI>what they had no mind to,</HI> but for some time without effect. However, there happened about that time, a duel between two gamesters, whose names were <HI>Taylor</HI> and <HI>Clarke,</HI> which helped to pro∣mote his peaceable intentions. They fought by torch-light in the grove; <HI>Tay∣lor</HI> was run through the body, but lived seven years after, at which time his wound breaking out afresh, it caused his death. <HI>Clarke</HI> from that time pretended to be a Quaker, but the orthodox brethren never cordially received him among their num∣ber; and he died at <HI>London,</HI> about eigh∣teen years after, in poverty and contrition. From that time it was thought necessary to forbid the wearing of swords at <HI>Bath,</HI> as they often tore the ladies cloaths, and fright∣ed them, by sometimes appearing upon tri∣fling occasions. Whenever therefore <HI>Nash</HI> heard of a challenge given, or accepted, he
<PB N="38" REF="46"/>
instantly had both parties arrested. The gentlemen's boots also made a very desperate stand against him, the country 'squires were by no means submissive to his usurpations; and probably his authority alone would never have carried him thro', had he not re∣inforced it with ridicule. He wrote a song upon the occasion, which, for the honour of his poetical talents, the world shall see.<Q><LG>
<HEAD>FRONTINELLA's invitation to the Assembly.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Come, one and all, to <HI>Hoyden</HI> Hall,</L>
<L>For there's the assembly this night;</L>
<L>None but prude fools,</L>
<L>Mind manners and rules;</L>
<L>We <HI>Hoydens</HI> do decency slight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come Trollops and Slatterns,</L>
<L>Cockt hats and white aprons,</L>
<L>This best our modesty suits;</L>
<L>For why should not we,</L>
<L>In dress be as free,</L>
<L>As <HI>Hogs-Norton</HI> 'squires in boots.</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>The keenness, severity and particularly the good rhymes of this little <HI>morçeau,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="47"/>
which was at that time highly relished by many of the nobility at <HI>Bath,</HI> gained him a temporary triumph. But to push his victories, he got up a puppet shew, in which punch came in booted and spurred, in the character of a country 'squire. He was introduced as courting his mistress, and having obtained her consent to comply with his wishes, upon going to bed, he is desired to pull off his boots. My boots, replies punch, why, madam, you may as well bid me pull off my legs. I never go without boots, I never ride, I never dance without them; and this piece of politeness is quite the thing at <HI>Bath.</HI> We always dance at our town in boots, and the ladies often move mi∣nuets in riding-hoods. Thus he goes on, till his mistress, grown impatient, kicks him off the stage.</P>
<P>From that time few ventured to appear at the assemblies in <HI>Bath</HI> in a riding-dress; and whenever any gentleman, thro' igno∣rance, or haste, appeared in the rooms in boots, <HI>Nash</HI> would make up to him, and
<PB N="40" REF="48"/>
bowing in an arch manner, would tell him, that he had forgot his horse. Thus he was at last completely victorious.<Q><L><HI>Dolis{que} ccacti</HI></L>
<L><HI>Quos neque Tydides nec Larissaeus Achilles</HI></L>
<L><HI>Non anni domuere decem.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>He began therefore to reign without a rival, and like other kings had his mis∣tresses, flatterers, enemies and calumniators; the amusements of the place however wore a very different aspect from what they did formerly. Regularity repressed pride, and that lessened, people of fortune became fit for society. Let the morose and grave censure an attention to forms and ceremo∣nies, and rail at those, whose only business it is to regulate them; but tho' ceremony is very different from politeness, no coun∣try was ever yet polite, that was not first ceremonious. The natural gradation of breeding begins in savage disgust, pro∣ceeds to indifference, improves into atten∣tion, by degrees refines into ceremonious observance, and the trouble of being cere∣monious at length produces politeness,
<PB N="41" REF="49"/>
elegance and ease. There is therefore some merit in mending society, even in one of the inferior steps of this gradation; and no man was more happy in this respect than Mr. <HI>Nash.</HI> In every nation there are enough who have no other business or care but that of buying pleasure; and he taught them, who bid at such an auction, the art of procuring what they sought without diminishing the pleasure of others.</P>
<P>The city of <HI>Bath,</HI> by such assiduity, soon became the theatre of summer amuse∣ments for all people of fashion; and the manner of spending the day there must amuse any, but such as disease or spleen had made uneasy to themselves. The follow∣ing is a faint picture of the pleasures that scene affords. Upon a stranger's arrival at <HI>Bath</HI> he is welcomed by a peal of the Abbey bells, and in the next place, by the voice and music of the city waits. For these civilities the ringers have gene∣rally a present made them of half a guinea, and the waits of half a crown, or more, in proportion to the person's fortune, genero∣sity
<PB N="42" REF="50"/>
or ostentation. These customs, tho' disagreeable, are however genarally liked, or they would not continue. The greatest incommodity attending them is the distur∣bance the bells must give the sick. But the pleasure of knowing the name of every family that comes to town recom∣pences the inconvenience. Invalids are fond of news, and upon the first sound of the bells, every body sends out to en∣quire for whom they ring.</P>
<P>After the family is thus welcomed to <HI>Bath,</HI> it is the custom for the master of it to go to the public places, and subscribe two gui∣neas at the assembly-houses towards the balls and music in the pump-house, for which he is entitled to three tickets every ball night. His next subscription is a crown, half a guinea, or a guinea, according to his rank and quality, for the liberty of walking in the private walks be∣longing to <HI>Simpson</HI>'s assembly-house; a crown or half a guinea is also given to the booksellers, for which the gentleman is to have what books he pleases to read at his
<PB N="43" REF="51"/>
lodgings. And at the coffee-house another subscription is taken for pen, ink and paper, for such letters as the subscriber shall write at it during his stay. The ladies too may subscribe to the booksellers, and to an house by the pump-room, for the advan∣tage of reading the news, and for enjoying each other's conversation.</P>
<P>Things being thus adjusted, the amuse∣ments of the day are generally begun by bathing, which is no unpleasing method of passing away an hour, or so.</P>
<P>The baths are five in number. On the south-west side of the abbey church is the King's Bath; which is an oblong square, the walls are full of niches, and at every corner are steps to descend into it: this bath is said to contain 427 tons and 50 gallons of water; and on its rising out of the ground over the springs, it is some∣times too hot to be endured by those who bathe therein. Adjoining to the King's Bath there is another, called the Queen's Bath; this is of more temperate warmth, as borrowing its water from the other.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="52"/>In the south-west part of the city are three other baths, viz. The Hot Bath, which is not much inferior in heat to the King's Bath, and contains 53 tons 2 hogsheads, and 11 gallons of water. The Cross Bath, which contains 52 tons 3 hogsheads, and 11 gallons; and the Leper's Bath, which is not so much frequented as the rest.</P>
<P>The King's Bath (according to the best observations) will fill in about nine hours and a half; the Hot Bath in about eleven hours and a half; and the Cross Bath in about the same time.</P>
<P>The hours for bathing are commonly be∣tween six and nine in the morning; and the Baths are every morning supplied with fresh water; for when the people have done bathing, the sluices in each Bath are pulled up, and the water is carried off by drains into the river Avon.</P>
<P>In the morning the lady is brought in a close chair, dressed in her bathing cloaths, to the Bath; and, being in the water,
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>
the woman who attends, presents her with a little floating dish like a bason; into which the lady puts an handkerchief, a snuff-box, and a nosegay. She then traverses the Bath; if a novice with a guide, if otherwise by herself; and hav∣ing amused herself thus while she thinks proper, calls for her chair, and returns to her lodgings.</P>
<P>The amusement of bathing is immedi∣ately succeeded by a general assembly of people at the pump-house, some for plea∣sure, and some to drink the hot waters. Three glasses, at three different times, is the usual portion for every drinker; and the intervals between every glass are enli∣vened by the harmony of a small band of music, as well as by the conversation of the gay, the witty, or the forward.</P>
<P>From the pump-house the ladies, from time to time, withdraw to a female coffee-house, and from thence return to their lodgings to breakfast. The gentlemen withdraw to their coffee-houses,
<PB N="46" REF="54"/>
to read the papers, or converse on the news of the day, with a freedom and ease not to be found in the metropolis.</P>
<P>People of fashion make public break∣fasts at the assembly-houses, to which they invite their acquaintances, and they sometimes order private concerts; or when so disposed, attend lectures upon the arts and sciences, which are frequently taught there in a pretty superficial man∣ner, so as not to teize the understanding, while they afford the imagination some amusement. The private concerts are performed in the ball-rooms, the tickets a crown each.</P>
<P>Concert breakfasts at the assembly-house, sometimes make also a part of the morning's amusement here, the expen∣ces of which are defrayed by a subscripti∣on among the men. Persons of rank and fortune who can perform are admit∣ted into the orchestra, and find a pleasure in joining with the performers.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="55"/>Thus we have the tedious morning fairly over. When noon approaches, and church (if any please to go there) is done, some of the company appear upon the parade, and other public walks, where they continue to chat and amuse each other, 'till they have formed parties for the play, cards, or dancing for the eve∣ning. Another part of the company divert themselves with reading in the booksellers shops, or are generally seen taking the air and exercise, some on horseback, some in coaches. Some walk in the meadows round the town, winding along the side of the river Avon, and the neighbouring canal; while others are seen scaling some of those ro∣mantic precipices that over-hang the city.</P>
<P>When the hour of dinner draws nigh, and the company is returned from their different recreations, the provisions are generally served with the utmost elegance and plenty. Their mutton, butter, fish, and fowl, are all allowed to be excellent, and their cookery still exceeds their meat.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="56"/>After dinner is over, and evening pray∣ers ended, the company meet a second time at the pump-house. From this they retire to the walks, and from thence go to drink tea at the assembly-houses, and the rest of the evenings are concluded either with balls, plays or visits. A theatre was erected in the year 1705 by subscription, by people of the highest rank, who per∣mitted their arms to be engraven on the inside of the house, as a public testimony of their liberality towards it. Every tuesday and friday evening is concluded with a public ball, the contributions to which are so numerous, that the price of each ticket is trifling. Thus Bath yields a continued rotation of diversions, and peo∣ple of all ways of thinking, even from the libertine to the methodist, have it in their power to complete the day with employ∣ments suited to their inclinations.</P>
<P>In this manner every amusement soon improved under Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>'s administra∣tion.
<PB N="49" REF="57"/>
The magistrates of the city found, that he was necessary and useful, and took every opportunity of paying the same re∣spect to his fictitious royalty, that is gene∣rally extorted by real power. The same satisfaction a young lady finds upon be∣ing singled out at her first appearance; or an applauded poet, on the success of his first tragedy, influenced him. All admir∣ed him as an extraordinary character; and some who knew no better, as a very fine gentleman; he was perfectly happy in their little applause, and affected at length something particular in his dress, behavi∣our and conversation.</P>
<P>His equipage was sumptuous, and he usually travelled to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> in a post chariot and six greys, with out-riders, foot∣men, <HI>French</HI> horns, and every other appen∣dage of expensive parade. He always wore a white hat, and, to apologize for this singularity, said, he did it purely to secure it from being stolen; his dress was tawdry, tho' not perfectly genteel; he might be considered as a beau of several generations,
<PB N="50" REF="58"/>
and in his appearance he, in some measure, mixed the fashions of the last age with those of the present. He perfectly under∣stood elegant expence, and generally passed his time in the very best company, if persons of the first distinction deserve that title.</P>
<P>But I hear the reader now demand, what finances were to support all this finery, or where the treasures, that gave him such frequent opportunities of displaying his benevolence, or his vanity? To answer this, we must now enter upon another part of his character, his talents as a gamester; for by gaming alone at that period, of which I speak, he kept up so very genteel an appearance. When he first figured at <HI>Bath,</HI> there were few laws against this de∣structive amusement. The gaming-table was the constant resource of despair and indigence, and the frequent ruin of opulent fortunes. Wherever people of fashion came, needy adventurers were gene∣rally found in waiting. With such <HI>Bath</HI> swarmed, and among this class Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="59"/>
was certainly to be numbered in the be∣ginning, only with this difference, that he wanted the corrupt heart, too common∣ly attending a life of expedients; for he was generous, humane and honourable, even tho' by profession a gamester.</P>
<P>A thousand instances might be given of his integrity, even in this infamous pro∣fession; where his generosity often im∣pelled him to act in contradiction to his interest. Wherever he found a novice in the hands of a sharper, he generally fore∣warned him of the danger; whenever he found any inclined to play, yet ignorant of the game, he would offer his ser∣vices, and play for them. I remember an instance to this effect, tho' too nearly concerned in the affair to publish the gentleman's name of whom it is re∣lated. In the year 1725, there came to <HI>Bath</HI> a giddy youth, who had just resigned his fellowship at <HI>Oxford.</HI> He brought his whole fortune with him there, it was but a trifle, however he was resolved to venture it all. Good fortune seemed kind∣er
<PB N="52" REF="60"/>
than could be expected. Without the smallest skill in play, he won a sum suffi∣cient to make any unambitious man happy. His desire of gain encreasing with his gains, in the <HI>October</HI> following he was <HI>at all,</HI> and added four thousand pounds to his former capital. Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> one night, after losing a considerable sum to this un∣deserving son of fortune, invited him to supper. Sir, cried this honest, tho' vete∣ran gamester, perhaps you may ima∣gine I have invited you, in order to have my revenge at home; but, sir! I scorn so inhospitable an action. I desired the fa∣vour of your company to give you some advice, which you will pardon me, Sir, you seem to stand in need of. You are now high in spirits, and drawn away by a torrent of success. But there will come a time, when you will repent having left the calm of a college life for the turbulent profession of a gamester. Ill runs, will come, as sure as day and night succeed each other. Be therefore advised, remain content with your present gains; for be persuaded, that had you the bank of <HI>England,</HI> with
<PB N="53" REF="61"/>
your present ignorance of gaming, it would vanish like a fairy dream. You are a stranger to me, but to convince you of the part I take in your welfare, I'll give you fifty guineas, to forfeit twenty, every time you lose two hundred at one sitting. The young gentleman refused his offer, and was at last undone!</P>
<P>The late duke of <HI>B.</HI> being chagrined at losing a considerable sum, pressed Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> to tie him up for the future from play∣ing deep. Accordingly, the beau gave his grace an hundred guineas to forfeit ten thousand, whenever he lost a sum to the same amount at play, in one sitting. The duke loved play to distraction, and soon after at hazard lost eight thousand guineas, and was going to throw for three thousand more; when <HI>Nash,</HI> catching hold of the dice∣box, entreated his Grace to reflect upon the penalty if he lost; the Duke for that time desisted; but so strong was the furor of play upon him, that soon after, losing a considerable sum at <HI>New-market,</HI> he was contented to pay the penalty.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="62"/>When the late earl of <HI>T—d</HI> was a youth, he was passionately fond of play, and never better pleased than with having Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> for his antagonist. <HI>Nash</HI> saw with concern his lordship's foible, and undertook to cure him, tho' by a very dis∣agreeable remedy. Conscious of his own superior skill, he determined to en∣gage him in single play for a very con∣siderable sum. His lordship, in propor∣tion as he lost his game, lost his temper too; and as he approached the gulph, seemed still more eager for ruin. He lost his estate; some writings were put into the winner's possession; his very equipage was deposited as a last stake, and he lost that also. But, when our generous game∣ster had found his lordship sufficiently punished for his temerity, he returned all; only stipulating, that he should be paid five thousand pound whenever he should think proper to make the demand. However, he never made any such demand during his lordship's life; but some time after his de∣cease, Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>'s affairs, being in the
<PB N="55" REF="63"/>
wane, he demanded the money of his lordship's heirs, who honourably paid it without any hesitation.</P>
<P>But whatever skill <HI>Nash</HI> might have acquired by long practice in play, he was never formed by nature for a successful gamester. He was constitutionally passion∣ate and generous. To acquire a perfection in that art, a man must be naturally phleg∣matic, reserved and cool; every passion must learn to obey controul; but he fre∣quently was unable to restrain the violence of his, and was often betrayed by this means into unbecoming rudeness, or childish impertinence; was sometimes a minion of fortune, and as often deprest by adversity. While others made consider∣able fortunes at the gaming-table, he was ever in the power of chance; nor did even the intimacy with which he was received by the great, place him in a state of inde∣pendance.</P>
<P>The considerable inconveniencies that were found to result from a permission of
<PB N="56" REF="64"/>
gaming, at length attracted the attention of the legislature, and in the twelfth year of his late majesty, the most prevalent games at that time were declared fraudu∣lent and unlawful. Every age has had its peculiar modes of gaming. The games of Gleek, Primero, In and In, and several others now exploded, employed our sharping ancestors; to these succeeded the Ace of hearts, Pharaoh, Basset, and Hazard, all games of chance like the former. But tho' in these the chances seemed equal to the novice; in general those who kept the bank were considerable winners. The act therefore, passed upon this occasion, declared all such games and lotteries illicit, and directed, that all who should set up such games, should forfeit two hundred pounds, to be levied by distress on the offender's goods; one third to go to the informer, the resi∣due to the poor.</P>
<P>The act further declared, that every person who played in any place, ex∣cept in the royal palace where his majesty
<PB N="57" REF="65"/>
resided, should forfeit fifty pounds, and should be condemned to pay treble costs in case of an appeal.</P>
<P>This law was scarcely made, before it was eluded by the invention of divers fraudulent and deceitful games; and a particular game, called Passage, was daily practised, and contributed to the ruin of thousands. To prevent this, the ensuing year it was enacted, that this and every other game invented, or to be invented with one die, or more, or any other instrument of the same nature, with numbers thereon, should be subject to a similar penalty; and at the same time, the persons playing with such instru∣ments should be punished as above.</P>
<P>This amendment of the law soon gave birth to new evasions; the game of Rolly Polly, Marlborough's Battles, but particu∣larly the E O, were set up; and strange to observe! several of those very noblemen, who had given their voices to suppress gaming, were the most ready to encourage
<PB N="58" REF="66"/>
it. This game was at first set up at <HI>Tunbridge.</HI> It was invented by one <HI>C—k,</HI> and carried on between him and one Mr. <HI>A—e,</HI> proprietor of the assembly-room at that place; and was reckoned extremely profitable to the bank, as it gained two and an half per cent. on all that was lost or won.</P>
<P>As all gaming was suppressed but this, Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> was now utterly destitute of any resource that he could expect from his su∣perior skill, and long experience in the art. The money to be gained in private gaming is at best but trifling, and the opportunity precarious. The minds of the generality of mankind shrink with their circumstances; and <HI>Nash,</HI> upon the immediate prospect of poverty, was now mean enough (I will call it no worse) to enter into a base confederacy with those low creatures to evade the law, and to share the plunder. The occasion was as follows. The profits of the table were, as I observed, divided between <HI>C—k</HI> the inventor, and <HI>A—e</HI> the room-keeper.
<PB N="59" REF="67"/>
The first year's profits were extraordinary, and <HI>A—e</HI> the room-keeper now began to wish himself sole proprietor. The com∣binations of the worthless are ever of short duration. The next year therefore <HI>A—e</HI> turned <HI>C—k</HI> out of his room, and set up the game for himself. The gentlemen and ladies who frequented the wells, unmind∣ful of the immense profit gained by these reptiles, still continued to game as before; and <HI>A—e</HI> was triumphing in the success of his politics, when he was informed, that <HI>C—k</HI> and his friends hired the crier to cry the game down. The consequences of this would have been fatal to <HI>A—e</HI>'s interest, for by this means frauds might have been discovered, which would deter even the most ardent lovers of play. Immediately, therefore, while the crier was yet upon the walks, he applied to Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> to stop these proceedings, and at the same time offered him a fourth share of the bank, which Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> was mean enough to ac∣cept. This is the greatest blot in his life, and this it is hoped will find pardon.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="68"/>The day after, the inventor offered an half of the bank; but this Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> thought proper to refuse, being pre-en∣gaded to <HI>A—e.</HI> Upon which, being dis∣appointed, he applied to one Mr. <HI>J—e,</HI> and under his protection another table was set up, and the company seemed to be divided equally between them. I cannot reflect, without surprize, at the wisdom of the gentlemen and ladies, to suffer themselves to be thus parcelled out between a pack of sharpers, and permit themselves to be defrauded, without even the shew of opposition. The company thus divided, Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> once more availed himself of their parties, and prevailed upon them to unite their banks, and to divide the gains into three shares, of which he reserved one to himself.</P>
<P><HI>Nash</HI> had hitherto enjoyed a fluctuating fortune; and had he taken the advantage of the present opportunity, he might have been for the future not only above want, but even in circumstances of opulence. Had he cautiously employed himself in
<PB N="61" REF="69"/>
computing the benefits of the table, and ex∣acting his stipulated share, he might have soon grown rich; but he entirely left the management of it to the people of the rooms; he took them (as he says in one of his memorials upon this occasion) to be ho∣nest, and never enquired what was won or lost; and, it is probable, they were seldom assiduous in informing him. I find a secret pleasure in thus displaying the insecurity of friendships among the base. They pre∣tended to pay him regularly at first, but he soon discovered, as he says, that at <HI>Tun∣bridge</HI> he had suffered to the amount of two thousand guineas.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as the E O table thus succeeded at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> was resolved to introduce it at <HI>Bath,</HI> and previously asked the opinion of several law∣yers, who declared it no way illegal. In consequence of this, he wrote to Mrs. <HI>A—,</HI> who kept one of the great rooms at <HI>Bath,</HI> acquainting her with the profits attend∣ing such a scheme, and proposing to have a fourth share with her, and Mr. <HI>W—,</HI> the pro∣prietor of the other room, for his authority,
<PB N="62" REF="70"/>
and protection. To this Mr. <HI>W—</HI> and she returned him for answer, that they would grant him a fifth share; which he consented to accept. Accordingly he made a journey to <HI>London,</HI> and bespoke two tables, one for each room, at the rate of fifteen pounds each table.</P>
<P>The tables were no sooner set up at <HI>Bath,</HI> than they were frequented with a greater concourse of gamesters than those at <HI>Tunbridge.</HI> Men of that infamous pro∣fession, from every part of the kingdom, and even other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> flocked here to feed on the ruins of each other's for∣tune. This afforded another opportunity for Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> to become rich; but, as at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> he thought the people here also would take care of him, and therefore he employed none to look after his interest. The first year they paid him what he thought just; the next, the woman of the room dying, her son paid him, and shewed his books. Sometime after the people of the rooms offered him one hundred pounds a year each for his share; which he refused;
<PB N="63" REF="71"/>
every succeeding year they continued to pay him less and less; 'till at length he found, as he pretends, that he had thus lost not less than twenty thousand pounds.</P>
<P>Thus they proceeded, deceiving the public and each other, 'till the legislature thought proper to suppress these seminaries of vice. It was enacted, that after the 24th of <HI>June,</HI> 1745, none should be per∣mitted to keep an house, room or place, for playing, upon pain of such forfeitures, as were declared in former acts instituted for that purpose.</P>
<P>The legislature likewise amended a law, made in the reign of queen <HI>Anne,</HI> for recover∣ing money lost at play, on the oath of the winner. By this act no person was rendered incapable of being a witness; and every person present at a gaming-table might be summoned by the magistrate, who took cognizance of the affair. No privilege of parliament was allowed, to those con∣victed of having gaming-tables in their
<PB N="64" REF="72"/>
houses. Those who lost ten pounds at one time, were liable to be indicted within six months after the offence was committed; and being convicted, were to be fined five times the value of the sum won or lost, for the use of the poor. Any offender be∣fore conviction, discovering another, so as to be convicted, was to be discharged from the penalties incurred by his own offences.</P>
<P>By this wise and just act, all <HI>Nash</HI>'s fu∣ture hopes of succeeding by the tables were blown up. He had now only the justice and generosity of his confederates to trust to; but that he soon found to be a vain expectation; for, if we can depend on his own memorials, what at one time they confessed, they would at another deny; and tho' upon some occasions they seemed at variance with each other, yet when they were to oppose him, whom they considered as a common enemy, they generally united with confidence and suc∣cess. He now therefore had nothing but a law-suit to confide in for redress; and this is ever the last expedient to retrieve a
<PB N="65" REF="73"/>
desperate fortune, He accordingly threw his suit into Chancery, and by this means the public became acquainted with what he had long endeavoured to conceal. They now found that he was himself concern∣ed in the gaming-tables, of which he only seemed the conductor; and that he had shared part of the spoil, tho' he com∣plained of having been defrauded of a just share.</P>
<P>The success of his suit was what might have been naturally expected; he had but at best a bad cause, and as the oaths of the defendants were alone sufficient to cast him in Chancery, it was not surpri∣zing that he was nonsuited. But the con∣sequence of this affair was much more fa∣tal than he had imagined, it lessened him in the esteem of the public, it drew several enemies against him, and in some measure diminished the authority of any defence he could make. From that time (about the year 1745) I find this poor, good-natured, but misguided man involved in continual disputes, every day calumniated with some
<PB N="66" REF="74"/>
new slander, and continually endeavour∣ing to obviate its effects.</P>
<P>Upon these occasions his usual method was, by printed bills handed about among his acquaintance, to inform the public of his most private transactions with some of those creatures, with whom he had former∣ly associated; but these apologies served rather to blacken his antagonists, than to vindicate him. They were in general ex∣tremely ill written, confused, obscure, and sometimes unintelligible. By these however it appeard, that <HI>W—</HI> was ori∣ginally obliged to him for the resort of company to his room; that lady <HI>H—,</HI> who had all the company before <HI>W—</HI>'s room was built, offered Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> an hundred pound for his protection; which he refused, having previously promised to support Mrs. <HI>W—.</HI> It appears by these apologies, that the persons concerned in the rooms made large fortunes, while he still continued in pristine indigence; and that his nephew, for whom he had at first
<PB N="67" REF="75"/>
secured one of the rooms, was left in as great distress as he.</P>
<P>His enemies were not upon this occasion contented with aspersing him, as a confe∣derate with sharpers, they even asserted, that he spent, and embezzled the subscrip∣tions of gentlemen and ladies, which were given for useful or charitable purposes. But to such aspersions he answered, by declaring, to use his own expression, be∣fore God and man, that he never divert∣ed one shilling of the said subscriptions to his own use; nor was he ever thought to have done it, till new enemies started up against him. Perhaps the reader may be curious to see one of these memorials, written by himself; and I will indulge his curiosity, merely to shew a specimen of the stile and manner of a man, whose whole life was past in a round of gaiety and conversation, whose jests were a thou∣sand times repeated, and whose company was courted by every son and daughter of fashion. The following is particularly levelled against those, who, in the latter

part of his life, took every opportunity to traduce his character.<Q><TEXT>

<P>This gentleman's simplicity, in trusting persons whom he had no previous reasons to place confidence in, seems to be one of those lights into his character, which, while they impeach his understanding, do honour to his benevolence. The low and timid are ever suspicious; but a heart im∣pressed
<PB N="72" REF="80"/>
with honourable sentiments, ex∣pects from others sympathetic sincerity.</P>
<P>But now that we have viewed his con∣duct as a gamester, and seen him on that side of his character, which is by far the most unfavourable, seen him declining from his former favour and esteem, the just consequence of his quitting, tho' but ever so little, the paths of honour; let me turn to those brighter parts of his life and character, which gained the affec∣tion of his friends, the esteem of the cor∣poration which he assisted, and may possibly attract the attention of posterity. By his successes we shall find, that figuring in life, proceeds less from the possession of great talents, than from the proper application of moderate ones. Some great minds are only fitted to put forth their powers in the storm; and the occasion is often wanting during a whole life for a great exertion: but trifling opportuni∣ties of shining, are almost every hour offered to the little sedulous mind; and a person thus employed, is not only more
<PB N="73" REF="81"/>
pleasing, but more useful in a state of tran∣quil society.</P>
<P>Tho' gaming first introduced him into polite company, this alone could hardly have carried him forward, without the assistance of a genteel address, much viva∣city, some humour, and some wit. But once admitted into the circle of the Beau Monde, he then laid claim to all the pri∣vileges by which it is distinguished. A∣mong others, in the early part of his life, he entered himself professedly into the ser∣vice of the fair sex; he set up for a man of gallantry and intrigue; and if we can credit the boasts of his old age, he often succeeded. In fact, the business of love somewhat resembles the business of physic; no matter for qualifications, he that makes vigorous pretensions to either is surest of success. Nature had by no means formed Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> for a Beau Garçon; his person was clumsey, too large and aukward, and his features harsh, strong, and peculiarly irregular; yet even, with those disadvan∣tages, he made love, became an univer∣sal
<PB N="74" REF="82"/>
admirer of the sex, and was universally admired. He was possessed, at least, of some requisites of a lover. He had assidui∣ty, flattery, fine cloaths, and as much wit as the ladies he addressed. Wit, flattery, and fine cloaths, he used to say, were enough to debauch a nunnery. But my fair readers of the present day are exempt from this scandal; and it is no matter now, what he said of their grandmothers.</P>
<P>As <HI>Nestor</HI> was a man of three ages, so <HI>Nash</HI> sometimes humorously called him∣self a beau of three generations. He had seen flaxen bobs succeeded by majors, which in their turn gave way to negli∣gents, which were at last totally routed by bags and ramilees. The manner in which gentlemen managed their amours, in these different ages of fashion, were not more different than their perriwigs. The lover in the reign of king <HI>Charles</HI> was solemn, majestic and formal. He visit∣ed his mistress in state. Languished for the favour, kneeled when he toasted his
<PB N="75" REF="83"/>
goddess, walked with solemnity, per∣formed the most trifling things with de∣corum, and even took snuff with a flourish. The beau of the latter part of queen <HI>Ann</HI>'s reign was disgusted with so much forma∣lity, he was pert, smart and lively; his billet-doux were written in a quite differ∣ent stile from that of his antiquated prede∣cessor; he was ever laughing at his own ridiculous situation; till at last, he per∣suaded the lady to become as ridiculous as himself. The beau of the third age, in which Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> died, was still more extra∣ordinary than either; his whole secret in intrigue consisted in perfect indifference. The only way to make love now, I have heard Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> say, was to take no man∣ner of notice of the lady, which method was found the surest way to secure her affections.</P>
<P>However these things be, this gentle∣man's successes in amour were in reality very much confined in the second and third age of intrigue; his character was too public for a lady to consign her repu∣tation
<PB N="76" REF="84"/>
to his keeping. But in the begin∣ning of life it is said, he knew the secret history of the times, and contributed himself to swell the page of scandal. Were I upon the present occasion to hold the pen of a novelist, I could recount some amours, in which he was successful. I could fill a volume with little anecdotes, which contain neither pleasure nor instruc∣tion; with histories of professing lovers, and poor believing girls deceived by such professions. But such adventures are easily written, and as easily atchieved. The plan even of fictitious novel is quite exhausted; but truth, which I have fol∣lowed here, and ever design to follow, presents in the affair of love scarce any variety. The manner in which one re∣putation is lost, exactly resembles that by which another is taken away. The gentleman begins at timid distance, grows more bold, becomes rude, till the lady is married or undone; such is the substance of every modern novel; nor will I gratify the pruriency of folly,
<PB N="77" REF="85"/>
at the expence of every other pleasure my narration may afford.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> did not long continue an uni∣versal gallant; but in the earlier years of his reign, entirely gave up his endeavours to deceive the sex, in order to become the honest protector of their innocence, the guardian of their reputation, and a friend to their virtue.</P>
<P>This was a character he bore for many years, and supported it with integrity, assiduity and success. It was his constant practice to do every thing in his power to prevent the fatal consequences of rash and inconsiderate love; and there are many persons now alive, who owe their present happiness to his having interrupted the progress of an amour, that threatened to become unhappy, or even criminal, by privately making their guardians or pa∣rents acquainted with what he could dis∣cover</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="86"/>I shall beg leave to give some instances of Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>'s good-nature on these oc∣casions, as I have had the accounts from himself. At the conclusion of the treaty of peace at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> colonel <HI>M—</HI> was one of the thoughtless, agreeable, gay creatures, that drew the attention of the company at <HI>Bath.</HI> He danced and talk∣ed with great vivacity; and when he gamed among the ladies, he shewed, that his attention was employed rather upon their hearts than their fortunes. His own fortune however was a trifle, when compared to the elegance of his expence; and his imprudence at last was so great, that it obliged him to sell an annuity, ari∣sing from his commission, to keep up his splendor a little longer.</P>
<P>However thoughtless he might be, he had the happiness of gaining the affections of Miss <HI>L—,</HI> whose father designed her a very large fortune. This lady was courted by a nobleman of distinction, but she refused his addresses, resolved upon
<PB N="79" REF="87"/>
gratifying rather her inclinations than her avarice. The intrigue went on success∣fully between her and the colonel, and they both would certainly have been mar∣ried, and been undone, had not Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> apprized her father of their intentions. The old gentleman recalled his daughter from <HI>Bath,</HI> and offered Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> a very considerable present, for the care he had taken, which he refused.</P>
<P>In the mean time colonel <HI>M—</HI> had an intimation how his intrigue came to be discovered; and by taxing Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> sound that his suspicions were not without foundation. A challenge was the imme∣diate consequence, which the king of <HI>Bath,</HI> conscious of having only done his duty, thought proper to decline. As none are permitted to wear swords at <HI>Bath,</HI> the colonel found no opportunity of gratify∣ing his resentment, and waited with im∣patience to find Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> in town, to re∣quire proper satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="88"/>During this interval, however, he found his creditors become too importunate for him to remain longer at <HI>Bath</HI>; and his finances and credit being quite exhausted, he took the desperate resolution of going over to the <HI>Dutch</HI> army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he enlisted himself a volunteer. Here he underwent all the fatigues of a private cen∣tinel, with the additional misery of receiv∣ing no pay, and his friends in <HI>England</HI> gave out, that he was shot at the battle of —</P>
<P>In the mean time the nobleman pressed his passion with ardour, but during the progress of his amour, the young lady's father died, and left her heiress to a for∣tune of fifteen hundred a year. She thought herself now disengaged from her former passion. An absence of two years had in some measure abated her love for the colonel; and the assiduity, the merit, and real regard of the gentleman who still continued to solicit her, were almost too powerful for her constancy. Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="89"/>
in the mean time, took every opportunity of enquiring after colonel <HI>M—,</HI> and found, that he had for some time been returned to <HI>England,</HI> but changed his name, in order to avoid the fury of his creditors; and that he was entered into a company of strolling players, who were at that time exhibiting at <HI>Peterborough.</HI></P>
<P>He now therefore thought he owed the colonel, in justice, an opportunity of pro∣moting his fortune, as he had once de∣prived him of an occasion of satisfying his love. Our Beau therefore invited the lady to be of a party to <HI>Peterborough,</HI> and offered his own equipage, which was then one of the most elegant in <HI>England,</HI> to conduct her there. The proposal being accepted, the lady, the nobleman, and Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> arrived in town just as the players were going to begin.</P>
<P>Colonel <HI>M—,</HI> who used every means of remaining <HI>incognito,</HI> and who was too proud to make his distresses known to any of his former acquaintance, was now de∣graded
<PB N="82" REF="90"/>
into the character of <HI>Tom</HI> in the <HI>Conscious Lovers.</HI> Miss <HI>L—</HI> was placed in the foremost row of the spectators, her lord on one side, and the impatient <HI>Nash</HI> on the other; when the unhappy youth appeared in that despicable situation upon the stage. The moment he came on, his former mistress struck his view, but his amazement was encreased, when he saw her fainting away in the arms of those who sate behind her. He was incapable of proceeding, and scarce knowing what he did, he flew and caught her in his arms.</P>
<P>Colonel, cried <HI>Nash,</HI> when they were in some measure recovered, you once thought me your enemy, because I endea∣voured to prevent you both from ruining each other, you were then wrong, and you have long had my forgiveness. If you love well enough now for matrimony, you fairly have my consent, and d—n him, say I, that attempts to part you. Their nuptials were solemnized soon after, and affluence added a zest to all their fu∣ture enjoyments. Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> had the
<PB N="83" REF="91"/>
thanks of each, and he afterwards spent several agreeable days in that society, which he had contributed to render happy.</P>
<P>I shall beg the reader's patience, while I give another instance, in which he in∣effectually offered his assistance and advice. This story is not from himself; but told us partly by Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> the architect of <HI>Bath,</HI> as it fell particularly within his own knowledge; and partly from another memoir, to which he refers.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Sylvia S—</HI> was descended from one of the best families in the kingdom, and was left a large fortune upon her Sister's decease. She had early in life been intro∣duced into the best company, and con∣tracted a passion for elegance and expence. It is usual to make the heroine of a story very witty, and very beautiful, and such circumstances are so surely expected, that they are scarce attended to. But what∣ever the finest poet could conceive of wit, or the most celebrated painter imagine of beauty, were excelled in the perfections
<PB N="84" REF="92"/>
of this young lady. Her superiority in both was allowed by all, who either heard, or had seen her. She was natu∣rally gay, generous to a fault, good-na∣tured to the highest degree, affable in conversation, and some of her letters, and other writings, as well in verse as prose, would have shone amongst those of the most celebrated wits of this, or any other age, had they been published.</P>
<P>But these great qualifications were mark∣ed by another, which lessened the value of them all. She was imprudent! But let it not be imagined, that her reputation or honour suffered by her imprudence; I only mean, she had no knowledge of the use of money, she relieved distress, by putting herself into the circumstances of the object whose wants she supplied.</P>
<P>She was arrived at the age of nineteen, when the croud of her lovers, and the continual repetition of new flattery, had taught her to think she could never be forsaken, and never poor. Young ladies
<PB N="85" REF="93"/>
are apt to expect a certainty of success, from a number of lovers; and yet I have seldom seen a girl courted by an hundred lovers, that found an husband in any. Before the choice is fixed, she has either lost her reputation, or her good sense; and the loss of either is sufficient to con∣sign her to perpetual virginity.</P>
<P>Among the number of this young lady's lovers was the celebrated <HI>S—,</HI> who, at that time, went by the name of <HI>the good-natured man.</HI> This gentleman, with talents that might have done honour to humanity, suffered himself to fall at length into the lowest state of debasement. He followed the dictates of every newest passion, his love, his pity, his genero∣sity, and even his friendships were all in excess; he was unable to make head a∣gainst any of his sensations or desires, but they were in general worthy wishes and desires; for he was constitutionally virtu∣ous. This gentleman, who at last died in a goal, was at that time this lady's en∣vied favourite.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="94"/>It is probable that he, thoughtless crea∣ture, had no other prospect from this amour, but that of passing the present mo∣ments agreeably. He only courted dissipa∣tion, but the lady's thoughts were fixed on happiness. At length, however, his debts amounting to a considerable sum, he was arrested, and thrown into prison. He en∣deavoured at first to conceal his situation from his beautiful mistress; but she soon came to a knowledge of his distress, and took a fatal resolution of freeing him from confinement by discharging all the demands of his creditors.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> was at that time in <HI>London,</HI> and represented to the thoughtless young lady, that such a measure would effectual∣ly ruin both; that so warm a concern for the interests of Mr. <HI>S—,</HI> would in the first place quite impair her fortune, in the eyes of our sex; and what was worse, lessen her reputation in those of her own. He added, that thus bringing Mr. <HI>S—</HI> from prison, would be only a temporary
<PB N="87" REF="95"/>
relief; that a mind so generous as his, would become bankrupt under the load of gratitude; and instead of improving in friendship or affection, he would only study to avoid a creditor he could never repay; that tho' small favours produce good-will, great ones destroy friendship. These admonitions however were disre∣garded, and she too late found the pru∣dence and truth of her adviser. In short, her fortune was by this means exhausted, and, with all her attractions, she found her acquaintance began to disesteem her, in proportion as she became poor.</P>
<P>In this situation she accepted Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>'s invitation of returning to <HI>Bath</HI>; he promis∣ed to introduce her to the best company there, and he was assured that her merit would do the rest; upon her very first appearance, ladies of the highest distinction courted her friendship and esteem; but a settled melancholy had taken possession of her mind, and no amusements that they could propose were sufficient to divert it. Yet still, as if from habit, she followed the
<PB N="88" REF="96"/>
crowd in its levities, and frequented those places, where all persons endeavour to forget themselves in the bustle of ceremo∣ny and shew.</P>
<P>Her beauty, her simplicity, and her un∣guarded situation, soon drew the attention of a designing wretch, who at that time kept one of the rooms at <HI>Bath,</HI> and who thought, that this lady's merit, properly managed, might turn to good account. This woman's name was dame <HI>Lindsey,</HI> a creature who, though vicious, was in ap∣pearance sanctified; and though designing, had some wit and humour. She began by the humblest assiduity to ingratiate herself with miss <HI>S—</HI>; shewed, that she could be amusing as a companion, and by frequent offers of money, proved, that she could be useful as a friend. Thus by degrees she gained an entire ascendant over this poor, thoughtless, deserted girl; and in less than one year, namely about 1727, Miss <HI>S,</HI> with∣out ever transgressing the laws of virtue, had entirely lost her reputation. When∣ever a person was wanting to make up a
<PB N="89" REF="97"/>
party for play at dame <HI>Lindsey</HI>'s, <HI>Sylvia,</HI> as she was then familiarly called, was sent for, and was obliged to suffer all those slights, which the rich but too often let fall upon their inferiors in point of for∣tune.</P>
<P>In most, even the greatest minds, the heart at last becomes level with the mean∣ness of its condition; but in this charm∣ing girl, it struggled hard with adversity, and yielded to every encroachment of contempt with sullen reluctance.</P>
<P>But tho' in the course of three years she was in the very eye of public inspection, yet, Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> the architect, avers, that he could never, by the strictest observa∣tions, perceive her to be tainted with any other vice, than that of suffering herself to be decoyed to the gaming-table, and at her own hazard, playing for the amuse∣ment and advantage of others. Her friend Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> therefore, thought proper to induce her to break off all connections with dame <HI>Lindsey,</HI> and to rent part of Mr.
<PB N="90" REF="98"/>
<HI>Wood</HI>'s house, in <HI>Queen square,</HI> where she behaved with the utmost complaisance, regularity and virtue.</P>
<P>In this situation her detestation of life still continued; she found, that time would infallibly deprive her of part of her attrac∣tions, and that continual solicitude would impair the rest. With these reflections she would frequently entertain herself, and an old faithful maid in the vales of <HI>Bath,</HI> when ever the weather would permit them to walk out. She would even sometimes start questions in company, with seeming unconcern, in order to know what act of suicide was easiest, and which was at∣tended with the smallest pain. When tired with exercise, she generally retired to medi∣tation, and she became habituated to early hours of sleep and rest. But when the wea∣ther prevented her usual exercise, and her sleep was thus more difficult, she made it a rule to rise from her bed, and walk about her chamber, till she began to find an in∣clination for repose.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="99"/>This custom made it necessary for her to order a burning candle to be kept all night in her room. And the maid usu∣ally, when she withdrew, locked the chamber door, and pushing the key under it beyond reach, her mistress by that constant method lay undisturbed till seven o' clock in the morning, then she arose, unlocked the door, and rang the bell, as a signal for the maid to return.</P>
<P>This state of seeming piety, regularity, and prudence continued for some time, till the gay, celebrated toasted miss <HI>Silvia</HI> was sunk into an housekeeper to the gentleman at whose house she lived. She was unable to keep company for want of the elegancies of dress, that are the usual passport among the polite, and she was too haughty to seem to want them. The fashionable, the amu∣sing, and the polite in society now seldom visited her, and from being once the object of every eye, she was now deserted by all, and preyed upon by the bitter reflections of her own imprudence.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="100"/>Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> and part of his family, were gone to <HI>London.</HI> Miss <HI>Silvia</HI> was left with the rest as a governess at <HI>Bath.</HI> She some∣times saw Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> and acknowledged the friendship of his admonitions, tho' she refused to accept any other marks of his generosity than that of advice. Upon the close of the day, in which Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> was expected to return from <HI>London,</HI> she ex∣pressed some uneasiness at the disappoint∣ment of not seeing him; took particular care to settle the affairs of his family, and then as usual sate down to meditation. She now cast a retrospect over her past misconduct, and her approaching misery; she saw, that even affluence gave her no real happiness, and from indigence she thought nothing could be hoped but linger∣ing calamity. She at length conceived the fatal resolution of leaving a life, in which she could see no corner for comfort, and terminating a scene of imprudence in sui∣cide.</P>
<P>Thus resolved, she sate down at her di∣ning-room window, and with cool intre∣pidity,
<PB N="93" REF="101"/>
wrote the following elegant lines on one of the panes of the window.<Q><L>O death; thou pleasing end of human woe!</L>
<L>Thou cure for life! Thou greatest good be∣low!</L>
<L>Still may'st thou fly the coward, and the slave,</L>
<L>And thy soft slumbers only bless the brave.</L></Q></P>
<P>She then went into company with the most chearful serenity; talked of in∣different subjects till supper, which she ordered to be got ready in a little library belonging to the family. There she spent the remaining hours, preceding bed-time, in dandling two of Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s children on her knees. In retiring from thence to her chamber she went into the nursery, to take her leave of another child, as it lay sleeping in the cradle. Struck with the innocence of the little babe's looks, and the consciousness of her meditated guilt, she could not avoid bursting into tears, and hugging it in her arms; she then bid her old servant a good night, for the first
<PB N="94" REF="102"/>
time she had ever done so, and went to bed as usual.</P>
<P>It is probable she soon quitted her bed, and was seized with an alternation of pas∣sions, before she yielded to the impulse of despair. She dressed herself in clean lin∣nen, and white garments of every kind, like a bride-maid. Her gown was pinned over her breast, just as a nurse pins the swaddling cloaths of an infant. A pink silk girdle was the instrument with which she resolved to terminate her misery, and this was lengthened by another made of gold thread. The end of the for∣mer was tied with a noose, and the lat∣ter with three knots, at a small distance from one another.</P>
<P>Thus prepared, she sate down again, and read; for she left the book open at that place, in the story of <HI>Olympia,</HI> in the <HI>Orlando Furioso</HI> of <HI>Ariosto,</HI> where, by the perfidy and ingratitude of her bosom friend, she was ruined, and left to the mercy of an unpitying world. This tragical event
<PB N="95" REF="103"/>
gave her fresh spirits to go through her fatal purpose; so standing upon a stool, and flinging the girdle, which was tied round her neck, over a closet-door that opened into her chamber, she remained suspended. Her weight however broke the girdle, and the poor despairer fell upon the floor with such violence, that her fall awakened a workman that lay in the house about half an hour after two o'clock.</P>
<P>Recovering herself, she began to walk about the room, as her usual custom was when she wanted sleep; and the workman imagining it to be only some ordinary ac∣cident, again went to sleep. She once more, therefore, had recourse to a strong∣er girdle made of silver thread, and this kept her suspended till she died.</P>
<P>Her old maid continued in the morning to wait as usual for the ringing of the bell, and protracted her patience, hour after hour, till two o' clock in the after∣noon; when the workmen at length en∣tering
<PB N="96" REF="104"/>
the room through the window, found their unfortunate mistress still hang∣ing, and quite cold. The coroner's jury being impanelled, brought in their verdict lunacy; and her corpse was next night decently buried in her father's grave, at the charge of a female companion, with whom she had for many years an insepara∣ble intimacy.</P>
<P>Thus ended a female wit, a toast, and a gamester; loved, admired, and forsaken. Formed for the delight of society, fallen by imprudence into an object of pity. Hun∣dreds in high life lamented her fate, and wished, when too late, to redress her in∣juries. They who once had helped to im∣pair her fortune, now regretted that they had assisted in so mean a pursuit. The little effects she had left behind were bought up with the greatest avidity, by those who desired to preserve some token of a companion, that once had given them such delight. The remembrance of every vir∣tue she was possessed of was now improv∣ed by pity. Her former follies were few,
<PB N="97" REF="105"/>
but the last swelled them to a large amount. And she remains the strongest instance to posterity, that want of prudence alone, almost cancels every other virtue.</P>
<P>In all this unfortunate lady's affairs Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> took a peculiar concern, he directed her when they played, advised her when she deviated from the rules of caution, and performed the last offices of friendship after her decease, by raising the auction of her little effects.</P>
<P>But he was not only the assistant and the friend of the fair sex, but also their defen∣der. He secured their persons from insult, and their reputations from scandal. No∣thing offended him more, than a young fellow's pretending to receive favours from ladies he probably never saw; nothing pleased him so much, as seeing such a piece of deliberate mischief punished. Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> and one of his friends, being newly ar∣rived at <HI>Tunbridge</HI> from <HI>Bath,</HI> were one day on the walks, and seeing a young fel∣low of fortune, with whom they had some
<PB N="98" REF="106"/>
slight acquaintance, joined him. After the usual chat and news of the day was over, Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> asked him, how long he had been at the wells, and what company was there? The other replied, he had been at <HI>Tunbridge</HI> a month; but as for company, he could find as good at a <HI>Tyburn</HI> ball. Not a soul was to be seen, except a parcel of gamesters and whores, who would grant the last favour, for a single stake at the Pharaoh bank. <Q REND="inline">"Look you there, con∣tinued he, that Goddess of midnight, so fine, at t'other end of the walks, by Jove, she was mine this morning for half a guinea. And she there, who brings up the rear with powdered hair and dirty ruffles, she's pretty enough, but cheap, perfectly cheap; why, my boys, to my own knowledge, you may have her for a crown, and a dish of chocolate into the bargain. Last <HI>Wednesday</HI> night we were happy."</Q> Hold there, sir, cried the gen∣tleman; as for your having the first lady, it is possible it may be true, and I intend to ask her about it, for she is my sister; but as to your lying with the other last
<PB N="99" REF="107"/>
<HI>Wednesday,</HI> I am sure you are a lying ras∣cal—she is my wife, and we came here but last night. The Buck vainly asked pardon; the gentleman was going to give him proper chastisement; when Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> interposed in his behalf, and obtained his pardon, upon condition that he quitted <HI>Tunbridge</HI> immediately.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> not only took care, during his administration, to protect the ladies from the insults of our sex, but to guard them from the slanders of each other. He, in the first place, prevented any animosi∣ties that might arise from place and prece∣dence, by being previously acquainted with the rank and quality of almost every family in the <HI>British</HI> dominions. He en∣deavoured to render scandal odious, by marking it as the result of envy and folly united. Not even <HI>Solon</HI> could have enac∣ted a wiser law in such a society as <HI>Bath.</HI> The gay, the heedless, and the idle, which mostly compose the groupe of water-drink∣ers, seldom are at the pains of talking upon universal topics, which require com∣prehensive
<PB N="100" REF="108"/>
thought, or abstract reasoning. The adventures of the little circle of their own acquaintance, or of some names of quality and fashion, make up their whole conversation. But it is too likely, that when we mention those, we wish to de∣press them, in order to render ourselves more conspicuous; scandal must therefore have fixed her throne at <HI>Bath,</HI> preferable to any other part of the kingdom. How∣ever, tho' these endeavours could not to∣tally suppress this custom among the fair, yet they gained him the friendship of seve∣ral ladies of distinction, who had smarted pretty severely under the lash of censure. Among this number was the old duchess of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> who conceived a particu∣lar friendship for him, and which conti∣nued during her life. She frequently consulted him in several concerns of a pri∣vate nature. Her letting leases, building bridges, or forming canals, were often carried on under his guidance; but she ad∣vised with him particularly in purchasing liveries for the footmen; a business to which she thought his genius best a∣dapted.
<PB N="101" REF="109"/>
As any thing relative to her may please the curiosity of such as de∣light in the anecdotes and letters of the great, however dull and insipid, I shall beg leave to present them with one or two of her letters, collected at a venture from several others to the same purpose.<LETTER>

<P>MR. <HI>Jennens</HI> will give you an account how little time I have in my power, and that will make my excuse for not thanking you sooner for the favour of your letter, and for the trouble you have given yourself in bespeaking the cloth, which I am sure will be good, since you have un∣dertaken to order it. Pray ask Mrs. <HI>Jen∣nens</HI> concerning the cascade, which will satisfy all your doubts in that matter; she saw it play, which it will do in great beau∣ty, for at least six hours together, and it runs enough to cover all the stones con∣stantly, and is a hundred feet broad, which I am told is a much greater breadth than any cascade is in <HI>England</HI>; and this will
<PB N="102" REF="110"/>
be yet better than it is, when it is quite finished; this water is a great addition to this place, and the lake being thirty acres, out of which the cascade comes and falls into the canal that goes through the bridge, it makes that look as if it was necessary, which before seemed so otherwise.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have received the favour of yours of the tenth of <HI>May,</HI> with that from Mr. <HI>Harvey.</HI> And by last post I received a letter from Mr. <HI>Overton,</HI> a sort of a bailiff and a surveyor, whom I have employed a great while upon the estates in <HI>Wiltshire.</HI> He is a very active and very useful man of his sort. He writes to me, that Mr. <HI>Har∣vey</HI> has been with him, and brought him
<PB N="103" REF="111"/>
a paper, which I sent you. He says, that finding he was a man that was desirous to serve me, he had assisted him all he could, by informations which he has given; and that he should continue to assist him. I have writ to him that he did mighty well. There is likewise a considerable tenant of my lord <HI>Bruce</HI>'s, his name is <HI>Cannons,</HI> who has promised me his assistance towards recommending tenants for these farms. And if Mr. <HI>Harvey</HI> happens to know such a man, he may put him in mind of it. I am sure you will do me all the good you can. And I hope you are sure that I shall always be sensible of the obligations I have to you, and ever be</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your most thankful and obliged humble Servant, S. MARLBOROUGH.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Harvey</HI> may conclude to take any prices that were given you in the paper. But as I know that we have been scan∣dalously cheated, if he finds that any thing can be let better than it has been let, I do not doubt but he will do it.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="112"/>The duchess of <HI>Marlborough</HI> seems to not a much better writer than Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>; but she was worth many hundred thousands pounds, and that might console her. It may give splenetic philosophy, how∣ever, some scope for meditation, when it considers, what a parcel of stupid trifles the world is ready to admire.</P>
<P>Whatever might have been Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>'s other excellencies, there was one in which few exceeded him; I mean his extensive humanity. None felt pity more strongly, and none made greater efforts to relieve distress. If I were to name any reigning and fashionable virtue in the present age, I th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should be charity. The numberless benefactions privately given, the various public solicitations for charity, and the suc∣cess they meet with, serve to prove, that tho' we may fall short of our ancestors in other respects, yet in this instance we greatly excel them. I know not whether it may not be spreading the influence of Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> too widely to say, that he was
<PB N="105" REF="113"/>
one of the principal causes of introducing this noble emulation among the rich; but certain it is, no private man ever re∣lieved the distresses of so many as he.</P>
<P>Before gaming was suppressed, and in the meridian of his life and for∣tune, his benefactions were generally found to equal his other expences. The money he got without pain, he gave away without reluctance; and whenever unable to relieve a wretch, who sued for assistance, he has been often seen to shed tears. A gentleman of broken fortune, one day standing behind his chair, as he was play∣ing a game of picquet for two hundred pounds, and observing with what indiffer∣ence he won the money, could not avoid whispering these words to another who stood by; <Q REND="inline">"heavens! how happy would all that money make me!"</Q> <HI>Nash,</HI> over∣hearing him, clapp'd the money into his hand; and cried, <HI>go and be happy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="114"/>About six and thirty years ago, a cler∣gyman brought his family to <HI>Bath</HI> for the benefit of the waters. His wife laboured under a lingering disorder, which it was thought nothing but the Hot Wells could remove. The expences of living there soon lessened the poor man's finances; his cloaths were sold, piece by piece, to pro∣vide a temporary relief for his little family; and his appearance was at last so shabby, that, from the number of holes in his coat and stockings, <HI>Nash</HI> gave him the name of doctor <HI>Cullender.</HI> Our beau, it seems, was rude enough to make a jest of poverty, tho' he had sensibility enough to relieve it. The poor clergyman combated his distresses with fortitude; and, instead of attempting to solicit relief, endeavour∣ed to conceal them. Upon a living of thirty pounds a year he endeavoured to maintain his wife and six children; but all his resources at last failed him, and nothing but famine was seen in the wretched family. The poor man's cir∣cumstances were at last communicated to
<PB N="107" REF="115"/>
<HI>Nash</HI>; who, with his usual chearfulness, undertook to relieve him. On a sunday evening, at a public tea-drinking at <HI>Har∣rison</HI>'s, he went about to collect a subscrip∣tion, and began it himself, by giving five guineas. By this means two hundred guineas were collected in less than two hours, and the poor family raised from the lowest despondence into affluence and felicity. A bounty so unexpected, had a better influence even upon the woman's constitution, than all that either the phy∣sicians or the waters of <HI>Bath</HI> could produce, and she recovered. But his good offices did not rest here. He prevailed upon a no∣bleman of his acquaintance, to present the Doctor with a living of an hundred and sixty pounds a year, which made that hap∣piness, he had before produced, in some measure permanent.</P>
<P>In the severe winter, which happened in the year 1739 his charity was great, useful, and extensive. He frequently, at that season of calamity, entered the houses of the poor, whom he thought too proud to beg, and generously relieved
<PB N="108" REF="116"/>
them. The colliers were at this time pe∣culiarly distressed; and in order to excite compassion, a number of them yoak∣ed themselves to a waggon loaded with coals, and drew it into <HI>Bath,</HI> and present∣ed it to Mr. <HI>Nash.</HI> Their scheme had the proper effect. Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> procured them a subscription, and gave ten guineas to∣wards it himself. The weavers also shared his bounty at that season. They came begging in a body into <HI>Bath,</HI> and he pro∣vided a plentiful dinner for their entertain∣ment, and gave each a week's subsistence at going away.</P>
<P>There are few public charities to which he was not a subscriber, and many he prin∣cipally contributed to support. Among others, Mr. <HI>Annesly,</HI> that strange exam∣ple of the mutability of fortune, and the inefficacy of our Laws, shared his interest and bounty. I have now before me a well written letter, addressed to Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> in order to obtain his interest for that un∣happy gentleman; it comes from Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a quaker, who was Mr. <HI>An∣nesly</HI>'s

<SALUTE>My Good Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the honour of con∣versing with thee at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> in <HI>September</HI> last, concerning that most sin∣gular striking case of Mr. <HI>Annesley,</HI> whom I have known since he was about six years old, I being then employed by the late Lord Baron of <HI>Altham,</HI> his father, as his agent. From what I know of the affairs of that family, I am well assured, that Mr. <HI>Annesley</HI> is the legitimate son of the late Lord Baron of <HI>Altham,</HI> and in consequence thereof, is intitled to the ho∣nours and estates of <HI>Anglesey.</HI> Were I not well assured of his right to those honours and estates, I would not give countenance to his claim.—I well remember, that thou then madest me a promise to assist him in soliciting a subscription, that was then be∣gun at <HI>Tunbridge</HI>; but as that place was not within the limits of thy province, thou
<PB N="110" REF="118"/>
couldest not promise to do much there. But thou saidst, that in case he would go to <HI>Bath</HI> in the season, thou wouldest then and there shew how much thou wouldest be his friend.</P>
<P>And now, my good friend, as the season is come on, and Mr. <HI>Annesley</HI> now at <HI>Bath,</HI> I beg leave to remind thee of that promise; and that thou wilt keep in full view the honour, the everlasting honour, that will naturally redound to thee from thy bene∣volence, and crown all the good actions of thy life.—I say, now in the vale of life, to relieve a distressed young nobleman, to extricate so immense an estate, from the hands of oppression; to do this, will fix such a ray of glory on thy memory, as will speak forth thy praise to future ages.—This with great respect is the needful,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>from thy assured Friend, WILLIAM HENDERSON.</SIGNED> <POSTSCRIPT>
<P>Be pleased to give my respects to Mr. <HI>Annesley</HI> and his spouse.</P>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="119"/>Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> punctually kept his word with this gentleman; he began the subscrip∣tion himself with the utmost liberality, and procured such a list of encouragers, as at once did honour to Mr. <HI>Annesly</HI>'s cause, and their own generosity. What a pity it was, that this money, which was given for the relief of indigence only, went to feed a set of reptiles, who batten upon our weakness, miseries and vice.</P>
<P>It may not be known to the generality of my readers, that the last act of the co∣medy, called <HI>Esop,</HI> which was added to the <HI>French</HI> plot of <HI>Boursault,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Van∣burgh,</HI> was taken from a story told of Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> upon a similar occasion. He had in the early part of life made pro∣posals of marriage to miss <HI>V—,</HI> of <HI>D—</HI>; his affluence at that time, and the favour which he was in with the nobility, readi∣ly induced the young lady's father to fa∣vour his addresses. However, upon open∣ing the affair to herself, she candidly told him, her affections were placed upon ano∣ther,
<PB N="112" REF="120"/>
and that she could not possibly com∣ply. Tho' this answer satisfied Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> it was by no means sufficient to appease the father; and he peremptorily insisted upon her obedience. Things were carri∣ed to the last extremity; when Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> undertook to settle the affair; and desiring his favoured rival to be sent for, with his own hand presented his mistress to him, together with a fortune equal to what her father intended to give her. Such an un∣common instance of generosity had an in∣stant effect upon the severe parent; he con∣sidered such disinterestedness as a just re∣proach to his own mercenary disposition, and took his daughter once more into fa∣vour. I wish, for the dignity of history, that the sequel could be concealed, but the young lady ran away with her foot∣man, before half a year was expired; and her husband died of grief.</P>
<P>In general, the benefactions of a gene∣rous man are but ill bestowed. His heart seldom gives him leave to examine the real distress of the object which sues for pity;
<PB N="113" REF="121"/>
his good-nature takes the alarm too soon, and he bestows his fortune on only appa∣rent wretchedness. The man naturally frugal, on the other hand, seldom relieves, but when he does, his reason, and not his sensations, generally find out the object. Every instance of his bounty is therefore permanent, and bears witness to his bene∣volence.</P>
<P>Of all the immense sums which <HI>Nash</HI> lavished upon real or apparent wretched∣ness, the effects, after a few years, seem∣ed to disappear. His money was gene∣rally given to support immediate want, or to relieve improvident indolence, and there∣fore it vanished in an hour. Perhaps to∣wards the close of life, were he to look round on the thousands he had reliev∣ed, he would find but few made hap∣py, or fixed by his bounty in a state of thriving industry; it was enough for him, that he gave to those that wanted; he never considered, that charity to some might impoverish himself without relieving them; he seldom considered the merit or the in∣dustry
<PB N="114" REF="122"/>
of the petitioner; or he rather fancied, that misery was an excuse for in∣dolence and guilt. It was an usual saying of his, when he went to beg for any per∣son in distress, that they who could stoop to the meanness of solicitation, must certain∣ly <HI>want</HI> the favour for which they peti∣tioned.</P>
<P>In this manner therefore he gave away immense sums of his own, and still greater, which he procured from others. His way was, when any person was proposed to him as an object of charity, to go round with his hat first among the nobility, ac∣cording to their rank, and so on, till he left scarce a single person unsolicited. They who go thus about to beg for others, gene∣rally find a pleasure in the task. They con∣sider, in some measure, every benefaction they procure, as given by themselves, and have at once the pleasure of being liberal, without the self reproach of being profuse.</P>
<P>But of all the instances of Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>'s bounty, none does him more real honour,
<PB N="115" REF="123"/>
than the pains he took in establishing an hospital at <HI>Bath,</HI> in which benefaction, however, Doctor <HI>Oliver</HI> had a great share. This was one of those well guided charities, dictated by reason, and supported by pru∣dence. By this institution the diseased poor might recover health, when incapa∣ble of receiving it in any other part of the kingdom. As the disorders of the poor, who could expect to find relief at <HI>Bath,</HI> were mostly chronical, the expence of maintaining them there was found more than their parishes thought proper to afford. They therefore chose to support them in a continual state of infirmity, by a small allowance at home, rather than be at the charge of an expensive cure. An hospital therefore at <HI>Bath</HI> it was thought would be an assylum, and a place of relief to those disa∣bled creatures, and would, at the same time, give the physician more thorough insight into the efficacy of the waters, from the regularity, with which such patients would be obliged to take them. These induce∣ments therefore influenced Doctor <HI>Oliver,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> to promote a subscription
<PB N="116" REF="124"/>
towards such a benefaction. The design was set on foot so early as the year 1711, but not completed till the year 1742. This delay, which seems surprizing, was in fact owing to the want of a proper fund for carrying the work into execution. What I said above, of charity being the characteristic virtue of the present age, will be more fully evinced, by comparing the old and new subscriptions for this hos∣pital. These will shew the difference be∣tween ancient and modern benevolence. When I run my eye over the list of those who subscribed in the year 1723, I find the subscription in general seldom rise above a guinea each person; so that, at that time, with all their efforts, they were una∣ble to raise four hundred pounds; but in a∣bout twenty years after, each particular sub∣scription was greatly encreased, ten, twen∣ty, thirty pounds, being the most ordina∣ry sums then subscribed, and they soon raised above two thousand pounds for the purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="125"/>Thus chiefly by the means of Doctor <HI>Oliver</HI> and Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> but not without the assistance of the good Mr. <HI>Allen,</HI> who gave them the stone for building and other benefactions, this hospital was erect∣ed, and it is at present fitted up for the re∣ception of one hundred and ten patients, the cases mostly paralytic or leprous. The following conditions are observed previous to admittance.<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>"I. The case of the patient must be de∣scribed by some physician, or person of skill, in the neighbourhood of the place where the patient has resided for some time; and this description, together with a certificate of the poverty of the patient, attested by some persons of credit, must be sent in a letter post-paid, directed to the register of the <HI>General Hospital</HI> at <HI>Bath.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. After the patient's case has been thus described, and sent, he must remain in his usual place or residence 'till he has notice of a vacancy, signified by a letter from the register.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="118" REF="126"/>III. Upon the receipt of such a letter, the patient must set forward for <HI>Bath,</HI> bringing with him this letter, the parish certificate duly executed, and allowed by two justices, and three pounds caution-mo∣ney, if from any part of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Wales</HI>; but if the patient comes from <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> then the caution-money, to be deposited before admission, is the sum of five pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Soldiers may, instead of parish cer∣tificates, bring a certificate from their commanding officers, signifying to what corps they belong, and that they shall be received into the same corps, when dis∣charged from the Hospital, in whatever condition they are. But it is necessary, that their cases be described, and sent pre∣viously, and that they bring with them three pounds caution-money.</ITEM>
</LIST><P><HI>Note,</HI> The intention of the caution-mo∣ney is to defray the expences of returning the patients after they are discharged from
<PB N="119" REF="127"/>
the Hospital, or of their burial in case they die there. The remainder of the caution-money, after these expences are defrayed, will be returned to the person who made the deposit."</P></Q></P>
<P>I am unwilling to leave this subject of his benevolence, because it is a virtue in his character, which must stand almost sin∣gle against an hundred follies; and it de∣serves the more to be insisted on, because it was large enough to outweigh them all. A man may be an hypocrite safely in every other instance, but in charity; there are few who will buy the character of benevo∣lence at the rate for which it must be ac∣quired. In short, the sums he gave away were immense; and in old age, when at last grown too poor to give relief, <HI>he gave,</HI> as the poet has it, <HI>all he had, a tear</HI>; when incapable of relieving the agonies of the wretched, he attempted to relieve his own by a flood of sorrow.</P>
<P>From the hospital erected for the benefit of the poor, it is an easy transition to the
<PB N="120" REF="128"/>
monuments erected by him in honour of the great. Upon the recovery of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> by drinking the <HI>Bath</HI> waters, Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> caused a small obelisk, thirty feet high, to be erected in a grove near the Abbey church, since called <HI>Orange Grove.</HI> This Prince's arms adorn the west side of the body of the pedestal. The in∣scription is on the opposite side, in the following words:
<Q><P><HI>In memoriam<LB/>Sanitatis<LB/>Principi Auriaco<LB/>Aquarum th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>malium potu.<LB/>Favente Deo,<LB/>Ovante Britannia,<LB/>Feliciter restitutae,</HI><LB/>M.DCC.XXXIV.</P></Q></P>
<P>In English thus.<Q><P>In memory<LB/>Of the happy restoration<LB/>Of the health of the<LB/>Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI><LB/>Through the favour of God,<LB/>And to the great joy of Britain,<LB/>By drinking the <HI>Bath</HI> waters.<LB/>1734.</P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="129"/>I find it a general custom, at all Baths and Spaws, to erect monuments of this kind to the memory of every Prince, who has received benefit from the waters. <HI>Aix, Spau,</HI> and <HI>Pisa,</HI> abound with inscriptions of this nature, apparently doing honour to the Prince, but in reality celebrating the efficacy of their springs. It is wrong, therefore, to call such monuments instances of gratitude, tho' they may wear that ap∣pearance.</P>
<P>In the year 1738, the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> came to <HI>Bath,</HI> who presented Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> with a large gold enamelled snuff-box; and upon his departure, <HI>Nash,</HI> as king of <HI>Bath,</HI> erected an obelisk in honour of this Prince, as he had before done for the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> This handsome memorial in ho∣nour of that good-natured Prince is erected in <HI>Queen square.</HI> It is enclosed with a stone balustrade, and in the middle of every side there are large iron gates. In the cen∣ter is the obelisk, seventy feet high, and terminating in a point. The expences of this were eighty pounds; and Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="130"/>
was determined, that the inscription should answer the magnificence of the pile. With this view he wrote to Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> requesting an inscription. I should have been glad to have given Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>'s letter upon this occasion; the reader, however, must be satisfied with <HI>Pope</HI>'s reply; which is as follows.<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have received yours, and thank your partiality in my favour. You say words cannot express the gratitude you feel for the favour of his R. H. and yet you would have me express what you feel, and in a few words. I own myself une∣qual to the task; for even, granting it possi∣ble to express an inexpressible idea, I am the worst person you could have pitched upon for this purpose, who have received so few favours from the great myself, that I am utterly unacquainted with what kind of thanks they like best. Whether the P— most loves poetry or prose, I protest I do not know; but this I dare ven∣ture
<PB N="123" REF="131"/>
to affirm, that you can give him as much satisfaction in either as I can.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, SIR, Your affectionate Servant, A. POPE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>What Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>'s answer to this billet was, I cannot take upon me to ascertain, but it was probably a perseverance in his former request. The following is the copy of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s reply to his second letter.<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I had sooner answered yours, but in the hope of procuring a properer hand than mine; and then in consulting with some, whose office about the P— might make them the best judges, what sort of inscription to set up? Nothing can be plainer than the inclosed; it is nearly the common sense of the thing, and I do not know how to flourish upon it. But this
<PB N="124" REF="132"/>
you would do as well, or better yourself, and I dare say may mend the expression. I am truly,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your affectionate Servant, A. POPE.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>I think I need not tell you my name should not be mentioned.</P>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Such a letter as this was what might naturally be expected from Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI> Not∣withstanding the seeming modesty towards the conclusion, the vanity of an applaud∣ed writer bursts through every line of it. The difficulty of concealing his hand from the clerks at the Post-office, and the so∣licitude to have his name concealed, were marks of the consciousness of his own im∣portance. It is probable, his hand was not so very well known, nor his letters so eagerly opened by the clerks of the Office, as he seems always to think. But in all
<PB N="125" REF="133"/>
his letters, as well as those of <HI>Swift,</HI> there runs a strain of pride, as if the world talked of nothing but themseves. <HI>Alass,</HI> says he, in one of them, <HI>the day after I am dead, the sun will shine as bright as the day before, and the world will be as merry as usual!</HI> Very strange, that nei∣ther an eclipse nor an earthquake should follow the loss of a Poet!</P>
<P>The inscription referred to in this letter, was the same which was afterwards en∣graved on the obelisk; and is as follows.<Q><P>In memory of honours bestow'd,<LB/>And in gratitude for benefits conferred in this city,<LB/>By his Royal Highness<LB/><HI>Frederick,</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI><LB/>And his Royal Consort,<LB/>In the Year 1738,<LB/>This obelisk is erected by<LB/><HI>Richard Nash,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></P></Q></P>
<P>I dare venture to say, there was scarce a common-council-man in the corporation of
<PB N="126" REF="134"/>
<HI>Bath,</HI> but could have done this as well. No∣thing can be more frigid; though the subject was worthy of the utmost exer∣tions of Genius.</P>
<P>About this period every season brought some new accession of honour to Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>; and the corporation now universally found, that he was absolutely necessary for promot∣ing the welfare of the city; so that this year seems to have been the meridian of his glory. About this time he arrived at such a pitch of authority, that I really believe <HI>Alex∣ander</HI> was not greater at <HI>Persepolis.</HI> The countenance he received from the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> the favour he was in with the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and the caresses of the nobility, all conspired to lift him to the utmost pitch of vanity. The exultation of a little mind, upon being admitted to the familiarity of the Great is inexpressible. The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had made him a a present of a very fine snuff-box. Upon this some of the nobility thought it would be proper to give snuff-boxes too;
<PB N="127" REF="135"/>
they were quickly imitated by the mid∣dling gentry, and it soon became the fashion to give Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> snuff-boxes.</P>
<P>To add to his honours, the corporation of <HI>Bath</HI> placed a full length statue of him, in the pump-room, between the busts of <HI>Newton</HI> and <HI>Pope.</HI> It was upon this occa∣sion that the Earl of <HI>Chesterfield</HI> wrote that severe, but witty epigram; the last lines, of which were so deservedly admired, and ran thus;
<Q><L>The statue placed, the busts between,</L>
<L>Adds to the satire strength;</L>
<L><HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Wit</HI> are little seen,</L>
<L>But <HI>Folly</HI> at full length.</L></Q></P>
<P>The example of the corporation was followed by all his acquaintance, of infe∣rior rank: He was treated in every respect like a great man; he had his levee, his flatterers, his buffoons, his good-natured creatures, and even his dedicators. A trifling ill supported vanity was his foible, and while he received the homage of the
<PB N="128" REF="136"/>
vulgar, and enjoyed the familiarity of the great, he felt no pain for the unpromi∣sing view of poverty that lay before him; he enjoyed the world as it went, and drew upon content for the deficiencies of fortune. If a cringing wretch called him his Honour, he was pleased; internally conscious, that he had the justest pretensions to the title. If a beggar called him my Lord, he was happy, and generally sent the flatterer off happy too. I have known him, in <HI>London,</HI> wait a whole day at a window in the <HI>Smyrna</HI> coffee-house, in order to receive a bow from the Prince, or the Dutchess of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> as they passed by where he was standing; and he would then look round upon the company for admiration and respect.</P>
<P>But perhaps the reader desires to know, who could be low enough to flatter a man, who himself lived in some measure by de∣pendance. Hundreds are ready upon those occasions. The very needy are almost ever flatterers. A man in wretched circum∣stances forgets his own value, and feels no
<PB N="129" REF="137"/>
pain in giving up superiority to every clai∣mant. The very vain are ever flatterers; as they find it necessary to make use of all their arts, to keep company with such as are superior to themselves. But particu∣larly the prodigal are prone to adulation, in order to open new supplies for their ex∣travagance. The poor, the vain, and the extravagant, are chiefly addicted to this vice; and such hung upon his good nature. When these three characters are found united in one person, the composition ge∣nerally becomes a great man's favourite. It was not difficult to collect such a groupe in a city, that was the center of pleasure. <HI>Nash</HI> had them of all sizes, from the half pay captain in laced cloaths, to the humble boot-catcher at the <HI>Bear.</HI></P>
<P>I have before me a bundle of letters, all addressed from a pack of flattering reptiles, to his <HI>Honour</HI>; and even some printed dedications, in the same servile strain. In these <HI>his Honour</HI> is compliment∣ed as the great encourager of the polite arts, as a gentleman of the most accomplished
<PB N="130" REF="138"/>
taste, of the most extensive learning, and in short of every thing in the world. But perhaps it will be thought wrong in me, to unveil the blushing muse, to brand learning with the meanness of its profes∣sors, or to expose scholars in a state of con∣tempt.—For the honour of letters, the dedications to Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> are not written by scholars or poets, but by people of a dif∣ferent stamp.</P>
<P>Among this number was the highwayman, who was taken after attempting to rob and murder Doctor <HI>Handcock.</HI> He was called <HI>Poulter,</HI> alias <HI>Baxter,</HI> and published a book, exposing the tricks of gamblers, thieves and pick-pockets. This he intend∣ed to have dedicated to Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> but the generous patron, tho' no man loved praise more, was too modest to have it printed. However, he took care to preserve the ma∣nuscript, among the rest of his papers. The book was entitled, <HI>The discoveries of John Poulter, alias Baxter, who was appre∣hended for robbing Doctor Handcock, of Sa∣lisbury, on Clarken Down near Bath; and</HI>
<PB N="131" REF="139"/>
<HI>who has since been admitted king's evidence, and discovered a most numerous gang of villains. Being a full account of all the robberies he committed, and the surprizing tricks and frauds he has practised for the space of five years last past, in different parts of England, particularly in the West. Written wholly by himself.</HI> The dedication intended to be prefixed is as follows, and will give a spe∣cimen of the stile of an highwayman and a gambler.<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Honourable <HI>Richard Nash,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Honour,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH humblest submission, I make bold to present the following sheets to your Honour's consideration, and well known humanity. As I am in∣dustriously careful, in respect to his Majesty, and good subjects, to put an end to the unfortunate misconducts of all I know, by bringing them to the gallows.

As your Honour's wis∣dom, humanity and interest are the friend of the virtuous, I make bold to lay, at your Honour's feet, the following lines, which will put every honest man upon his defence against the snares of the mischie∣vous; and am, with greatest gratitude, honoured Sir,</P>

with it, he loved to be called your Honour, and Honourable; and the highwayman more than once experienced his generosity.</P>
<P>But since I have mentioned this fel∣low's book, I cannot repress an impulse to give an extract from it, however fo∣reign from my subject. I take the follow∣ing picture to be a perfectly humorous description of artful knavery affecting ig∣norance on one hand, and rustic simpli∣city pretending to great wisdom and sa∣gacity on the other. It is an account of the manner in which countrymen are de∣ceived by gamblers, at a game called Pricking in the Belt, or the Old Nob. This is a leathern strop, folded up double, and then laid upon a table; if the person who plays with a bodkin pricks into the loop of the belt he wins; if otherwise, he loses. However, by slipping one end of the strop, the sharper can win at pleasure.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"THERE are generally four persons concerned in this fraud, one to personate a <HI>Sailor,</HI> called a <HI>Legg Cull,</HI> ano∣ther
<PB N="134" REF="142"/>
called the <HI>Capper,</HI> who always keeps with the <HI>Sailor</HI>; and two pickers up, or <HI>Money-Droppers,</HI> to bring in <HI>Flats</HI> or <HI>Bub∣bles.</HI> The first thing they do at a fair, is to look for a room clear of company, which the <HI>Sailor</HI> and <HI>Capper</HI> immediately take, while the <HI>Money-Droppers</HI> go out to look for a <HI>Flat.</HI> If they see a country∣man, whose looks they like, one drops a shilling, or half a crown, just before him, and picking it up again, looks the man in the face, and says, I have found a piece of money, friend, did you see me pick it up? The man says, yes: Then says the sharp∣er, if you had found it, I would have had half, so I will do as I would be done unto; come honest friend, we will not part with dry lips. Then taking him into the room where the other two are, he cries, By your leave gentlemen, I hope we don't disturb the company. No, cries the <HI>Sailor</HI>; no brothers; Will you drink a glass of brandy, I don't like your weak liquors; and then begins a discourse, by asking the <HI>Capper</HI> how far it is to <HI>London</HI>; who re∣plies, I dont know; perhaps the gentle∣man
<PB N="135" REF="143"/>
there can tell you, directing his dis∣course to the <HI>Flat</HI>; perhaps the <HI>Flat</HI> will answer, a hundred miles; the <HI>Sailor</HI> cries, I can ride that in a day, ay, in four or five hours; for, says he, my horse will run twenty nots an hour for twenty-four hours together: <HI>Capper,</HI> or the <HI>Sailor</HI>'s supposed companion, says, I believe <HI>Farmer</HI> you have not got such a horse as the <HI>Sailor</HI> has; the <HI>Farmer</HI> cries No, and laughs; and then the <HI>Sailor</HI> says, I must go and get half a pint of brandy, for I am griped, and so leaves them. The <HI>Capper,</HI> affecting a look of wisdom in his absence observes, that it is an old saying, and a true one, <HI>that Sai∣lors get their money like horses, and spend it like asses</HI>; as for that there <HI>Sailor</HI> I never saw him till now, buying a horse of my man; he tells me he has been at <HI>Sea,</HI> and has got about four hundred pounds prize-money, but I belive he will squander it all away, for he was gaming just now with a sharping fellow, and lost forty shil∣lings, at a strange game of pricking in a string. Did either of you ever see it, gen∣tlemen? continued the <HI>Capper</HI>; if you
<PB N="136" REF="144"/>
two are willing, I will ask him to shew it, for we may as well win some of his money as any body else: The <HI>Flat</HI> and the <HI>Drop∣per</HI> cry, Do. Then in comes the <HI>Sailor,</HI> staggering as if drunk, and cries, What cheer, brothers? I have just seen a pret∣ty girl in the fair, and went in to drink with her, we made a bargain, and I gave her a six and thirty shilling piece, but an old b—h her mother came and called her away, but I hope she will come back to me presently; then the <HI>Capper</HI> laughs, and says, Have you got your money of her a∣gain? The <HI>Sailor</HI> says, No; but she will come to me I'm sure; then they all laugh. This is done to deceive the <HI>Flat</HI>: then says the <HI>Capper,</HI> What have you done with the stick and the string, <HI>Sailor?</HI> he answers, What, that which I bought of the boys; I have got it here, but will not sell it, and then he pulls out the Old Nobb, saying, What do you think I gave for it? I gave but six-pence, and as much brandy as the two boys could drink; it is made out of a monkey's hide, as the boys told me, and they told me, there is a game to be
<PB N="137" REF="145"/>
played at it, which no body can do twice together; I will go down aboard ship, and play with my Captain, and I do not fear but I shall win his ship and cargo: then they all laugh, and the <HI>Sailor</HI> makes up the Old Nobb, and the <HI>Capper</HI> lays a shilling, and pricks himself and wins; the <HI>Sailor</HI> cries, You are a dab, I will not lay with you, but if you will call a stranger, I will lay again; why if you think me a dab, as you call it, I will get this strange gen∣tleman, or this (pointing to the <HI>Flat</HI>) Done, cries the <HI>Sailor,</HI> but you shall not tell him; then he makes up the Nob, and <HI>Capper</HI> lays a shilling, <HI>Flat</HI> pricks, be∣ing permitted to go six-pence; to which he agreeing, wins; and <HI>Capper</HI> says to the <HI>Flat,</HI> Can you change me half a crown? This is done to find the depth of his poc∣ket; if they see a good deal of gold, <HI>Flat</HI> must win three or four times; if no gold, but twice. Sometimes, if the <HI>Flat</HI> has no money, the <HI>Sailor</HI> cries, I have more mo∣ney than any man in the fair, and pulls out his purse of gold, and saith, Not one of you can beg, borrow or steal half this

sum in an hour for a guinea. <HI>Capper</HI> cries, I have laid out all mine; <HI>Farmer,</HI> Can you? I'll go your halves, if you think you can do it. The <HI>Sailor</HI> saith, you must not bring any body with you; then the <HI>Dropper</HI> goes with the <HI>Flat,</HI> and saith, you must not tell your friend it is for a wager; if you do, he will not lend it you. <HI>Flat</HI> goes and borrows it, and brings it to the <HI>Sailor,</HI> shews it him, and wins the wa∣ger; then the <HI>Sailor</HI> pinches the Nob again, and the <HI>Capper</HI> whispers to the <HI>Flat,</HI> to prick out purposely this time, saying, it will make the <HI>Sailor</HI> more eager to lay on; we may as well win his money as not, for he will spend it upon whores: <HI>Flat,</HI> with all the wisdom in the world, loses on purpose; upon which the <HI>Sailor</HI> swears, pulls out all his money, throws it about the room, and cries, I know no man can win for ever, and then lays a guinea, but wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l not let him prick, but throws down five guineas; and the <HI>Capper</HI> urging the <HI>Flat,</HI> and going his halves, the <HI>Sailor</HI> saith, my cabbin, boy will lay as much as that, I'll lay no less than twenty gui∣neas;
<PB N="139" REF="147"/>
the <HI>Capper</HI> cries, lay <HI>Farmer</HI> and take up forty; which, being certain of winning, he instantly complies with, and loses the whole. When he has lost, in order to advise him, the <HI>Dropper</HI> takes him by the arm, and hauls him out of doors; and the reckoning being in the mean time paid within, the <HI>Capper</HI> and <HI>Sailor</HI> follow after, and run another way. When they are out of sight, the <HI>Dropper</HI> faith to the <HI>Flat,</HI> go you back, and play with the <HI>Sailor</HI> for a shilling, whilst I go and borrow mo∣ney; but when the <HI>Flat</HI> goes to the house, he finds them gone, and then he knows that he is bit, but not till he has dearly paid for it."</Q></P>
<P>By this fellow's discoveries Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> was enabled to serve many of the nobility and gentry of his acquaintance; he receiv∣ed a list of all those houses of ill fame which harboured or assisted rogues, and took care to furnish travellers with proper precautions to avoid them.

<P>I fancy I have almost fatigued the reader, and I am almost fatigued myself, with the efforts of those elegant panegyrists; however, I can't finish this run of quota∣tion,

<HEAD>On his sickness at <HI>Tunbridge.</HI></HEAD>
<L>SAY, must the friend of human kind,</L>
<L>Of most refin'd—of most diffusive mind;</L>
<L>Must <HI>Nash</HI> himself beneath these ailments grieve?</L>
<L>He felt for all—He felt—but to relieve,</L>
<L>To heal the sick—the wounded to restore,</L>
<L>And bid desponding nature mourn no more.</L>
<L>Thy quickning warmth, O let thy patron feel,</L>
<L>Improve thy springs with double power to heal:</L>
<L>Quick, hither all inspiring health, repair,</L>
<L>And save the gay—and wretched from despair;</L>
<L>Thou only Esra's drooping sons can'st chear,</L>
<L>And stop the soft-ey'd virgin's trickling tear;</L>
<L>In murmurs who their monarch's pains deplore;</L>
<L>While sickness faints—and pleasure is no more;</L>
<L>O let not death, with hasty strides advance,</L>

<L><PB N="145" REF="153"/>His threatning power, coelestial maid! defeat;</L>
<L>Nor take him with thee, to thy well known seat;</L>

<L>Come then kind health, O quickly come away,</L>

</LG></Q></P>
<P>Such addresses as these were daily offer∣ed to our titular King. When in the me∣ridian of power, scarce a morning passed, that did not encrease the number of his humble admirers, and enlarge the sphere of his vanity.</P>
<P>The man who is constantly served up with adulation, must be a first-rate philosopher, if he can listen without contracting new affectations. The opinion we form of ourselves, is generally measured by what we hear from others; and when they conspire to deceive, we too readily concur in the de∣lusion. Among the number of much ap∣plauded men in the circle of our own friends, we can recollect but few that have heads quite strong enough to bear a loud acclamation of public praise in their favour;
<PB N="146" REF="154"/>
among the whole list, we shall scarce find one, that has not thus been made, on some side of his character, a coxcomb.</P>
<P>When the best head turns and grows giddy with praise, is it to be wondered that poor <HI>Nash,</HI> should be driven by it al∣most into a phrenzy of affectation? To∣wards the close of life he became affected. He chiefly laboured to be thought a sayer of good things; and by frequent attempts was now and then successful, for he ever lay upon the lurch.</P>
<P>There never perhaps was a more silly passion, than this desire of having a man's jests recorded. For this purpose, it is ne∣cessary to keep ignorant or ill-bred com∣pany, who are only fond of repeating such stories; in the next place, a person must tell his own jokes, in order to make them more universal; but what is worst of all, scarce a joke of this kind succeeds, but at the expence of a man's good nature; and he who exchanges the character of being thought agreeable, for that of being
<PB N="147" REF="155"/>
thought witty, makes but a very bad bar∣gain.</P>
<P>The success <HI>Nash</HI> sometimes met with led him on, when late in life, to mistake his true character. He was really agreeable, but he chose to be thought a wit. He therefore indulged his inclination, and never mattered how rude he was, provi∣ded he was thought comical. He thus got the applause he sought for, but too often found enemies, where he least expec∣ted to find them. Of all the jests record∣ed of him, I scarce find one that is not marked with petulance; he said whatever came uppermost, and in the number of his remarks it might naturally be expected that some were worth repeating; he threw of∣ten, and sometimes had a lucky cast.</P>
<P>In a life of almost ninety years, spent in the very point of public view, it is not strange, that five or six sprightly things of his have been collected, particularly as he took every opportunity of repeating them himself. His usual way, when he thought
<PB N="148" REF="156"/>
he said any thing clever, was to strengthen it with an oath, and to make up its want of sentiment by asseveration and grimace. For many years he thus entertained the company at the coffee-house with old stories, in which he always made himself the prin∣cipal character. Strangers liked this well enough; but they who were used to his conversation found it insupportable. One story brought on another, and each came in the same order that it had the day pre∣ceding. But this custom may be rather ascribed to the peculiarity of age, than a peculiarity of character; it seldom happens, that old men allure, at least by novelty; age that shrivels the body contracts the understanding; instead of exploring new regions, they rest satisfied in the old, and walk round the circle of their former discoveries. His manner of telling a story, however, was not displeasing, but few of those he told are worth transcribing. In∣deed it is the manner, which places the the whole difference between the wit of the vulgar, and of those who assume the name of the polite; one, has in general as much
<PB N="149" REF="157"/>
good sense as the other; a story transcri∣bed from the one, will be as entertaining as that copied from the other; but in con∣versation, the manner will give charms even to stupidity. The following is the story which he most frequently told, and pretty much in these words. Suppose the company to be talking of a <HI>German</HI> war, or <HI>Elizabeth Canning,</HI> he would begin thus.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I'll tell you something to that purpose, that I fancy will make you laugh. A covetous old parson, as rich as the De∣vil, scraped a fresh acquaintance with me several years ago at <HI>Bath.</HI> I knew him when he and I were students at <HI>Oxford,</HI> where we both studied damnationly hard, but that's neither here nor there. Well. Very well. I entertained him at my house in <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Court.</HI> (No, my house in <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Court</HI> was not built then) but I entertained him with all that the city could afford; the rooms, the music, and every thing in the world. Upon his leav∣ing <HI>Bath,</HI> he pressed me very hard to re∣turn the visit; and desired me to let him
<PB N="150" REF="158"/>
have the pleasure of seeing me at his house in <HI>Devonshire.</HI> About six months after, I happened to be in that neigh∣bourhood, and was resolved to see my old friend, from whom I expected a very warm reception. Well: I knocks at his door, when an old queer crea∣ture of a maid, came to the door, and denied him. I suspected, how∣ever, that he was at home; and going into the parlour, what should I see, but the Parson's legs up the chim∣ney, where he had thrust himself to a∣void entertaining me. This was very well. My dear, says I to the maid, it is very cold, extreme cold indeed, and I am afraid I have got a touch of my ague, light me the fire, if you please. La, sir, says the maid, who was a modest creature to be sure, the chimney smokes monstrously; you could not bear the room for three minutes together. By the greatest good luck there was a bun∣dle of straw in the hearth, and I called for a candle. The candle came. Well,
<PB N="151" REF="159"/>
good woman, says I, since you won't light me a fire, I'll light one for myself, and in a moment the straw was all in a blaze. This quickly unkennelled the old fox; there he stood in an old rusty night gown, blessing himself, and looking like—a—hem—egad."</Q></P>
<P>He used to tell surprizing stories of his activity when young.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here I stand, gentlemen, that could once leap forty two feet upon level ground, at three standing jumps, backward or forward. One, two, three, dart like an arrow out of a bow. But I am old now. I remember I once leaped for three hundred guineas with Count <HI>Klopstock,</HI> the great leaper, leaping-master to the Prince of <HI>Passau</HI>; you must all have heard of him. First he began with the running jump, and a most dam∣nable bounce it was, that's certain: Every body concluded that he had the match hollow; when only taking off my hat, stripping off neither coat, shoes,
<PB N="152" REF="160"/>
nor stockings, mind me, I fetches a run, and went beyond him one foot, three inches and three quarters measured, upon my soul, by Captain <HI>Pately</HI>'s own stand∣ard."</Q></P>
<P>But in this torrent of insipidity, there sometimes were found very severe satire, strokes of true wit, and lines of humour, <HI>cum fluerent lutulentus, &amp;c.</HI> He rallied very successfully, for he never felt another's joke; and drove home his own without pity. With his superiors he was familiar and blunt, the inferiority of his station secured him from their resentment; but the same bluntness which they laughed at, was by his equals regarded as insolence. Something like a familiar boot-catcher at an inn, a gentleman would bear that joke from him, for which a brother boot-catcher would knock him down.</P>
<P>Among other stories of <HI>Nash</HI>'s telling, I remember one, which I the more chear∣fully repeat, as it tends to correct a piece of impertinence that reigns in almost
<PB N="153" REF="161"/>
every country assembly. The principal inhabitants of a market-town, at a great distance from the capital, in order to en∣courage that harmony which ought to subsist in society, and to promote a mu∣tual intercourse between the sexes, so de∣sirable to both, and so necessary for all, had established a monthly assembly in the Town Hall, which was conducted with such decency, decorum and politeness, that it drew the attention of the gentlemen and ladies in the neighbourhood; and a noble∣man and his family continually honour∣ed them with their presence. This natu∣rally drew others, and in time the room was crouded with, what the world calls, good company, and the assembly prosper∣ed, till some of the new admitted ladies took it into their heads, that the trades∣mens daughters were unworthy of their notice, and therefore refus'd to join hands with them in the dance. This was com∣plained of by the town ladies, and that complaint was resented by the country gentlemen, who, more pert than wise, publickly advertised, that they would not
<PB N="154" REF="162"/>
dance with tradesmens daughters. This the most eminent tradesmen considered as an insult on themselves, and being men of worth, and able to live independently, they in return advertised that they would give no credit out of their town, and desired all others to discharge their accounts. A general uneasiness ensued; some writs were actually issued out, and much distress would have happened, had not my Lord, who sided with no party, kindly interfe∣red and composed the difference. The assembly however was ruined, and the families I am told are not friends yet, tho' this affair happened thirty years ago.</P>
<P><HI>Nothing debases human nature so much as pride.</HI>—This <HI>Nash</HI> knew, and endeavour∣ed to stifle every emotion of it at <HI>Bath.</HI> When he observed any ladies so extremely delicate and proud of a pedigree, as to only touch the back of an inferior's hand in the dance, he always called to order, and desired them to leave the room, or behave with common decency; and when any Ladies and Gentlemen drew off, after
<PB N="155" REF="163"/>
they had gone down a dance, without standing up till the dance was finished, he made up to them, and after asking whe∣ther they had done dancing, told them, they should dance no more unless they stood up for the rest; and on these occa∣sions he always was as good as his word.</P>
<P><HI>Nash,</HI> tho' no great wit, had the art of sometimes saying rude things with decen∣cy, and rendering them pleasing by an uncommon turn.—But most of the good things attributed to him, which have found their way into the jest books, are no better than puns; the smartest things I have seen are against him. One day in the grove, he joined some ladies, and asking one of them, who was crooked, whence she came? She replied, strait from <HI>London.</HI> Confound me, madam, said he, then you must have been damnably warpt by the way.</P>
<P>She soon, however, had ample revenge. Sitting the following evening in one of the rooms, he once more joined her company,
<PB N="156" REF="164"/>
and with a sneer and a bow, asked her, if she knew her Catechism, and could tell the name of <HI>Tobit</HI>'s dog? His name, Sir, was <HI>Nash,</HI> replied the lady, and an impu∣dent dog be was. This story is told in a celebrated romance; I only repeat it here to have an opportunity of observing, that it actually happened.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Anne</HI> once asked him, why he would not accept of knighthood? To which he replied, lest Sir <HI>William Read,</HI> the mountebank, who had been just knighted, should call him brother.</P>
<P>An house in <HI>Bath</HI> was said to be haunted by the Devil, and a great noise was made about it, when <HI>Nash</HI> going to the Minister of St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s, intreated him to drive the Devil out of <HI>Bath</HI> for ever, if it were only to oblige the ladies.</P>
<P><HI>Nash</HI> used sometimes to visit the great Doctor <HI>Clarke.</HI> The Doctor was one day conversing with <HI>Locke,</HI> and two or three more of his learned and intimate compa∣nions,
<PB N="157" REF="165"/>
with that freedom, gaiety and chear∣fulness, which is ever the result of inno∣cence. In the midst of their mirth and laughter, the Doctor, looking from the window, saw <HI>Nash</HI>'s chariot stop at the door. Boys, boys, cried the philosopher, to his friends, let us now be wise, for here is a fool coming.</P>
<P><HI>Nash</HI> was one day complaining in the following manner to the Earl of <HI>Chesterfield</HI> of his bad luck at play. Would you think it, my Lord, that damned bitch fortune, no later than last night, tricked me out of 500. Is it not surprizing, continued he, that my luck should never turn, that I should thus eternally be mauled? I don't wonder at your losing money <HI>Nash,</HI> says his lordship, but all the world is surprized where you get it to lose.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Cheney</HI> once, when <HI>Nash</HI> was ill, drew up a prescription for him, which was sent in accordingly. The next day the Doctor coming to see his patient, found him up and well; upon which he asked,
<PB N="158" REF="166"/>
if he had followed his prescription? Fol∣lowed your prescription, cried <HI>Nash,</HI> No.—Egad, if I had, I should have broke my neck, for I flung it out of the two pair of stairs window.</P>
<P>It would have been well, had he confined himself to such sallies; but as he grew old he grew insolent, and seemed, in some mea∣sure, insensible of the pain his attempts to be a wit gave others. Upon asking a lady to dance a minuet; if she refused, he would often demand, if she had got bandy legs. He would attempt to ridicule natural de∣fects; he forgot the deference due to birth and quality, and mistook the manner of settling rank and precedence upon many occasions. He now seemed no longer fashionable among the present race of gentry, he grew peevish and fretful, and they who only saw the remnant of a man, severely returned that laughter upon him, which he had once lavished upon others.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="167"/>Poor <HI>Nash</HI> was no longer the gay, thoughtless, idly industrious creature he once was; he now forgot how to supply new modes of entertainment, and became too rigid, to wind with ease through the vi∣cissitudes of fashion. The evening of his life began to grow cloudy. His for∣tune was gone, and nothing but poverty lay in prospect. To embitter his hopes, he found himself abandoned by the great, whom he had long endeavoured to serve; and was obliged to fly to those of humbler stations for protection, whom he once af∣fected to despise. He now began to want that charity, which he had never refused to any; and to find, that a life of dissipa∣tion and gaiety, is ever terminated by mi∣sery and regret.</P>
<P>Even his place of master of the cere∣monies (if I can trust the papers he has left behind him) was sought after. I would willingly be tender of any living reputati∣on; but these papers accuse Mr. <HI>Quin</HI> of endeavouring to supplant him. He has
<PB N="160" REF="168"/>
even left us a letter, which he supposed was written by that gentleman, soliciting a Lord for his interest upon the occasion. As I chuse to give Mr. <HI>Quin</HI> an opportu∣nity of disproving this, I will insert the letter, and, to shew the improbability of its being his, with all its faults, both of style and spelling. I am the less apt to believe it written by Mr. <HI>Quin,</HI> as a gentle∣man, who has mended <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s plays so often, would surely be capable of some∣thing more correct than the following. It was sent, as it should seem, from Mr. <HI>Quin</HI> to a nobleman, but left open for the perusal of an intermediate friend. It was this friend who sent a copy of it to Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> who caused it to be instantly print∣ed, and left among his other papers.<LETTER>

<P>N. B. There were some other private matters and offers in <HI>Quin</HI>'s letter to my Lord, which do not relate to you.</P>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="172"/>Here <HI>Nash,</HI> if I may be permitted the use of a polite and fashionable phrase, was humm'd; but he experienced such rubs as these, and a thousand other mortifications every day. He found po∣verty now denied him the indulgence not only of his favourite follies, but of his favourite virtues. The poor now solicited him in vain; he was him∣self a more pitiable object than they. The child of the public seldom has a friend, and he who once exercised his wit at the expence of others, must naturally have ene∣mies. Exasperated at last to the highest degree, an unaccountable whim struck him; poor <HI>Nash</HI> was resolved to become an au∣thor; he, who in the vigour of manhood, was incapable of the task, now at the im∣potent age of eighty-six, was determined to write his own history! from the many specimens already given of his style, the reader will not much regret that the histo∣rian was interrupted in his design. Yet as <HI>Montaigne</HI> observes, as the adventures
<PB N="165" REF="173"/>
of an infant, if an infant could inform us of them, would be pleasing; so the life of a Beau, if a beau could write, would certainly serve to regale curiosity.</P>
<P>Whether he really intended to put this design in execution, or did it only to alarm the nobility, I will not take upon me to determine; but certain it is, that his friends went about collecting subscriptions for the work, and he received several en∣couragements from such as were willing to be politely charitable. It was thought by many, that this history would reveal the intrigues of a whole age; that he had numberless secrets to disclose; but they ne∣ver considered, that persons of public cha∣racter, like him, were the most unlikely in the world to be made partakers of those secrets which people desired the public should not know. In fact, he had few se∣crets to discover, and those he had, are now buried with him in the grave.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="174"/>He was now past the power of giving or receiving pleasure, for he was poor, old and peevish; yet still he was incapable of turning from his former manner of life to pursue happiness. The old man endea∣voured to practise the follies of the boy, he spurred on his jaded passions after every trifle of the day; tottering with age he would be ever an unwelcome guest in the assemblies of the youthful and gay; and he seemed willing to find lost appetite among those scenes where he was once young.</P>
<P>An old man thus striving after pleasure is indeed an object of pity; but a man at once old and poor, running on in this pur∣suit, might excite astonishment. To see a Being both by fortune and constituti∣on rendered incapable of enjoyment, still haunting those pleasures he was no longer to share in; to see one of almost ninety set∣tling the fashion of a lady's cap, or assign∣ing her place in a country dance; to see him unmindful of his own reverend
<PB N="167" REF="175"/>
figure, or the respect he should have for himself, toasting demireps, or attempting to entertain the lewd and idle; a sight like this might well serve as a satire on huma∣nity; might shew that man is the only preposterous creature alive, who pursues the shadow of pleasure without temptation.</P>
<P>But he was not permitted to run on thus without severe and repeated reproof. The clergy sent him frequent calls to reforma∣tion; but the asperity of their advice in general abated its intended effects; they threatened him with fire and brimstone, for what he had long been taught to con∣sider as foibles, and not vices; so like a desperated debtor, he did not care to settle an account, that, upon the first inspection, he found himself utterly unable to pay. Thus begins one of his monitors.<Q REND="inline"><P>"THIS admonition comes from your friend, and one that has your inte∣rest deeply at heart: It comes on a design altogether important, and of no less con∣sequence
<PB N="168" REF="176"/>
than your everlasting happiness: so that it may justly challenge your care∣ful regard. It is not to upbraid or re∣proach, much less to triumph and insult over your misconduct or misery; no, 'tis pure benevolence, it is disinterested good∣will prompts me to write; I hope there∣fore I shall not raise your resentment. Yet be the consequence what it will, I cannot bear to see you walk in the paths that lead to death, without warning you of the danger, without sounding in your ear the lawful admonition,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Return and live! Why do you such things? I hear of your evil dealings by all this people?"</Q>
I have long observed and pitied you; and must tell you plainly, Sir, that your pre∣sent behaviour is not the way to reconcile yourself to God. You are so far from mak∣ing atonement to offended justice, that each moment you are aggravating the future ac∣count, and heaping up an increase of his anger. As long as you roll on in a continu∣ed circle of sensual delights and vain enter∣tainments, you are dead to all the purposes of piety and virtue. You are as odious to
<PB N="169" REF="177"/>
God as a corrupt carcase that lies putrefy∣ing in the church-yard. You are as far from doing your duty, or endeavouring after salvation, or restoring yourself to the divine favour, as a heap of dry bones nail∣ed up in a coffin is from vigour and acti∣vity.—Think, Sir, I conjure you, think upon this, if you have any inclination to escape the fire that will never be quench∣ed. Would you be rescued from the fury and fierce anger of God? Would you be delivered from weeping and wailing, and incessant gnashing of teeth? sure you would! But be certain, that this will never be done by amusements, which at best are trifling and impertinent; and for that, if for no other reason, foolish and sinful. 'Tis by seri∣ousness; 'tis by retirement and mourning, you must accomplish this great and desira∣ble deliverance. You must not appear at the head of every silly diversion, you must enter into your closet, and shut the door; commune with your own heart, and search out its defects. The pride of life, and all its superfluity of follies must be put away. You must make haste, and delay not to
<PB N="170" REF="178"/>
keep every injunction of heaven. You must always remember, that mighty sinners must be mightily penitent; or else mighti∣ly tormented. Your example, and your projects have been extremely <HI>prejudicial</HI>; I wish I could not say, <HI>fatal</HI> and <HI>destructive</HI> to many: For this there is no amends but an alteration of your conduct, as signal and remarkable as your <HI>person</HI> and <HI>name.</HI>"</P>
<P>"If you do not by this method remedy in some degree the evils that you have sent abroad, and prevent the mischievous con∣sequences that may ensue—wretched will you be, wretched above all men, to eternity. The blood of souls will be laid to your charge; God's jealousy, like a consuming flame, will smoke against you; as you your∣self will see in that day, when the moun∣tains shall quake, and the hills melt, and the earth be burnt up at his presence."</P>
<P>"Once more then I exhort you as a friend; I beseech you as a brother; I charge you as a messenger from God, in his own most solemn words;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Cast away from you your
<PB N="171" REF="179"/>
transgressions; make you a new heart, and a new spirit; so iniquity shall not be your ruin."</Q></P>
<P>"Perhaps you may be disposed to con∣temn this, and its serious purport; or to recommend it to your companions as a subject for raillery—Yet let me tell you be∣fore-hand, that for this, as well as for other things, God will bring you to judg∣ment. He sees me now I write: He will observe you while you read. He notes down my words; he will also note down your consequent procedure. Not then upon me, not upon me; but upon your own soul, will the neglecting or despising my sayings turn.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself; if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it."</Q></P></Q></P>
<P>Such repeated admonitions as these served to sting, without reforming him; they made him morose, but not pious. The dose was too strong for the patient to bear. He should have been met with smiles, and allured into reformation, if indeed he was
<PB N="172" REF="180"/>
criminal. But in the name of piety, what was there criminal in his conduct; he had long been taught to consider his trifling profession as a very serious and important business. He went through his office with great gravity, solemnity, and care; why then denounce peculiar torments against a poor harmless creature, who did a thousand good things, and whose greatest vice was vanity. He deserved ridicule, indeed, and he found it, but scarce a single action of his life, except one, deserves the asperity of reproach.</P>
<P>Thus we see a variety of causes concurred to embitter his departing life. The weakness and infirmities of exhausted nature, the ad∣monitions of the grave, who aggravated his follies into vices; the ingratitude of his dependants, who formerly flattered his for∣tunes; but particularly the contempt of the great, who quite forgot him in his wants; all these hung upon his spirits and soured his temper, and the poor man of pleasure might have terminated his life very tragically, had not the corporation of
<PB N="173" REF="181"/>
<HI>Bath</HI> charitably resolved to grant him ten guineas the first <HI>Monday</HI> of every month. This bounty served to keep him from ac∣tual necessity, tho' far too trifling, to enable him to support the character of a gentle∣man. Habit, and not nature, makes al∣most all our wants; and he who had been accustomed in the early parts of life to af∣fluence and prodigality, when reduced to an hundred and twenty-six pounds a year, must pine in actual indigence.</P>
<P>In this variety of uneasiness his health began to fail. He had received from na∣ture a robust and happy constitution, that was scarce even to be impaired by intem∣perance. He even pretended, among his friends, that he never followed a single pre∣scription in his life; however, in this he was one day detected on the parade; for boasting there of his contempt and utter difuse of medicine, unluckily the water of two blisters, which Dr. <HI>Oliver</HI> had pre∣scribed, and which he then had upon each leg, ouzed through his stockings, and be∣trayed him. His aversion to physic, how∣ever,
<PB N="174" REF="182"/>
was frequently a topic of raillery be∣tween him and Doctor <HI>Cheney,</HI> who was a man of some wit and breeding. When <HI>Cheney</HI> recommended his vegetable diet, <HI>Nash</HI> would swear, that his design was to send half the world grazing like <HI>Ne∣buchadnezzar.</HI> Ay, <HI>Cheney</HI> would reply, <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> was never such an infidel as thou art. It was but last week, gentle∣men, that I attended this fellow in a fit of sickness; there I found him rolling up his eyes to heaven, and crying for mercy; he would then swallow my drugs like breast-milk, yet you now hear him, how the old dog blasphemes the faculty. What <HI>Cheney</HI> said in jest was true, he feared the approaches of death more than the genera∣lity of mankind, and was generally very de∣vout while it threatened him. Tho' he was somewhat the libertine in action, none believed or trembled more than he; for a mind neither schooled by philosophy, nor encouraged by conscious innocence, is ever timid at the appearance of dan∣ger.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="183"/>For some time before his decease nature gave warning of his approaching dissolu∣tion. The worn machine had run itself down to an utter impossibility of repair; he saw, that he must die, and shuddered at the thought. His virtues were not of the great, but the amiable kind; so that for∣titude was not among the number. Anxi∣ous, timid, his thoughts still hanging on a receding world, he desired to enjoy a little longer that life, the miseries of which he had experienced so long. The poor unsuccessful gamester husbanded the wast∣ing moments, with an encreased desire to-continue the game, and to the last eagerly wished for one yet more happy throw. He died at his house in St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>court, Bath,</HI> on the 3d of <HI>February,</HI> 1761, aged eighty-seven years, three months, and some days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account of his age, which contradicts that given us by Doctor <HI>Oliver,</HI> was copied from Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>'s own hand-writing, by <HI>George Scott,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> from a book in the possession of Mr. <HI>Charles Morgan,</HI> at his coffee-house at <HI>Bath.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="184"/>His death was sincerely regretted by the city, to which he had been so long, and so great a benefactor. The day after he died, the Mayor of <HI>Bath</HI> called the corporation together, where they granted fifty pounds towards burying their Sovereign with pro∣per respect. After the corpse had lain four days, it was conveyed to the abbey church in that city, with a solemnity somewhat pe∣culiar to his character. About five the pro∣cession moved from his house; the charity girls two and two preceded, next the boys of the charity school singing a solemn oc∣casional hymn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><LG TYPE="hymn">

music, and his own band sounding at pro∣per intervals a dirge. Three clergymen immediately preceded the coffin, which was adorned with sable plumes, and the pall supported by the six senior Aldermen. The masters of the assembly-rooms fol∣lowed as chief mourners; the beadles of that hospital, which he had contribu∣ted so largely to endow, went next, and last of all, the poor patients themselves,
<PB N="178" REF="186"/>
the lame, the emaciated, and the feeble, followed their old benefactor to his grave, shedding unfeigned tears, and lamenting themselves in him.</P>
<P>The crowd was so great, that not only the streets were filled, but, as one of the journals in a <HI>Rant</HI> expresses it,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"even the tops of the houses were covered with spectators, each thought the occasion af∣fected themselves most; as when a real King dies, they asked each other, <HI>where shall we find such another</HI>; sorrow sate up∣on every face, and even children lisped that their Sovereign was no more. The awfulness of the solemnity made the deepest impression on the minds of the distressed inhabitants. The peasant dis∣continued his toil, the ox rested from the plough, all nature seemed to sym∣pathize with their loss, and the muffled bells rung a peal of Bob Major."</Q></P>
<P>Our deepest solemnities have something truly ridiculous in them: there is some∣what ludicrous in the folly of historians, who thus declaim upon the death of
<PB N="179" REF="187"/>
Kings and Princes, as if there was any thing dismal, or any thing unusual in it. <Q REND="inline">"For my part, says Poggi the Florentine, I can no more grieve for another's death than I could for my own. I have ever regarded death as a very trifling affair; nor can black staves, long cloaks, or mourning coaches, in the least influence my spirits. Let us live here as long, and as merrily as we can, and when we must die, why let us die merrily too, but die so as to be happy."</Q></P>
<P>The few things he was possessed of were left to his relations. A small li∣brary of well chosen books, some trinkets and pictures, were his only inheritance. Among the latter were a gold box, given by the late Countess of <HI>Burlington,</HI> with Lady <HI>Euston</HI>'s picture in the lid. An agate etui, with a diamond on the top, by the Princess Dowager of <HI>Wales,</HI> and some other things of no great value. The rings, watches, and pictures, which he former∣ly received from others, would have come to a considerable amount; but these his ne∣cessities had obliged him to dispose of: Some
<PB N="180" REF="188"/>
family pictures, however, remained, which were sold by advertisement, for five gui∣neas each, after Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>'s decease.</P>
<P>It was natural to expect, that the death of a person so long in the eye of the pub∣lic, must have produced a desire in several to delineate his character, or deplore his loss. He was scarce dead, when the pub∣lic papers were filled with elegies, groans and characters; and before he was buried, there were epitaphs ready made to inscribe on his stone. I remember one of those character writers, and a very grave one too, after observing, alass! that <HI>Richard Nash,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was no more, went on to assure us, that he was <HI>sagacious, debonair, and comode</HI>; and concluded with gravely de∣claring, <HI>that impotent posterity would in vain fumble to produce his fellow.</HI> Another, e∣qually sorrowful, gave us to know, <HI>that he was indeed a man</HI>; an assertion, which I fancy none will be so hardy as to contra∣dict. But the merriest of all the lamen∣tations made upon this occasion was, that where he is called, <HI>A constellation of the heavenly sphere.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="189"/>One thing, however, is common almost with each of them, and that is, that <HI>Venus, Cupid,</HI> and the <HI>Graces,</HI> are commanded to weep; and that <HI>Bath</HI> shall never find such another.</P>
<P>But tho' he was satirized with the praises of those, yet there were some of real abilities, who undertook to do justice to his character, to praise him for his virtues, and acknowledge his faults. I need scarcely mention, that Doctor <HI>Oliver,</HI> and Doctor <HI>King</HI> are of this number. They had honoured him with their friendship while living, and undertook to honour his me∣mory when dead. As the reader may chuse to compare their efforts upon the same sub∣ject, I have subjoined them, and perhaps many will find in either enough, upon so unimportant a subject as Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>'s life, to satisfy curiosity. The first published. was that by Doctor <HI>Oliver,</HI> written with much good sense, and still more good na∣ture. But the reader will consider that he, has assumed in his motto the character of
<PB N="182" REF="190"/>
a panegyrist, and spares his friend's faults, tho' he was too candid entirely to pass them over in silence.<Q><TEXT>

<P><PB N="198" REF="206"/>Whatever might have been justly ob∣served of Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>'s superiority as a go∣vernor, at least it may be said, that few contemporary kings have met with such able panegyrists. The former enumerates all his good qualities with tenderness; and the latter enforces them with impetuosity. They both seem to have loved him, and honourably paid his remains the last debt of friendship. But a cool biographer, un∣biassed by resentment or regard, will pro∣bably find nothing in the man either truly great, or strongly vicious. His virtues were all amiable, and more adapted to procure friends than admirers, they were more ca∣pable of raising love than esteem. He was naturally endued with good sense; but by having been long accustomed to pursue tri∣fles, his mind shrunk to the size of the little objects on which it was employed. His generosity was boundless, because his tenderness and his vanity were in equal pro∣portion; the one impelling him to relieve misery, and the other to make his bene∣factions known. In all his actions, how∣ever
<PB N="199" REF="207"/>
virtuous, he was guided by sensation, and not by reason; so that the uppermost passion was ever sure to prevail. His be∣ing constantly in company had made him an easy tho' not a polite companion. He chose to be thought rather an odd fellow, than a well-bred man; perhaps that mix∣ture of respect and ridicule, with which his mock royalty was treated, first inspired him with this resolution. The founda∣tions of his empire were laid in vicious compliance, the continuance of his reign was supported by a virtuous impartiality. In the beginning of his authority, he in reality obeyed those whom he pretended to govern; towards the end, he attempted to extort a real obedience from his sub∣jects, and supported his right by prescrip∣tion. Like a monarch <HI>Tacitus</HI> talks of; they complied with him at first because they loved, they obeyed at last because they feared him. He often led the rich into new follies, in order to promote the happiness of the poor, and served the one at the expence of the other. Whatever his vices were, they were of use to society;
<PB N="200" REF="208"/>
and this neither Petronius, nor Apicius, nor Tigellius, nor any other professed vo∣luptuary, could say. To set him up, as some do, for a pattern of imitation, is wrong, since all his virtues received a tinc∣ture from the neighbouring folly; to de∣nounce peculiar judgments against him, is equally unjust, as his faults raise rather our mirth than our detestation. He was fitted for the station in which fortune placed him. It required no great abilities to fill it, and few of great abilities, but would have disdained the employment. He led a life of vanity, and long mistook it for happiness. Unfortunately he was taught at last to know, that a man of pleasure leads the most unpleasant life in the world.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A Letter from Mr.</HI> *** <HI>in</HI> Tunbridge, <HI>to Lord — in</HI> London; <HI>found among the Papers of Mr.</HI> Nash, <HI>and prepared by him for the press.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT I foresaw has arrived, poor <HI>Jenners,</HI> after losing all his fortune, has shot himself through the head. His losses to <HI>Bland</HI> were considerable, and his playing soon after with <HI>Spedding</HI> contri∣buted to hasten his ruin. No man was ever more enamour'd of play, or under∣stood it less. At whatever game he ven∣tured his money, he was most usually the dupe, and still foolishly attributed to his bad luck, those misfortunes that entirely proceeded from his want of judgment.</P>
<P>After finding that he had brought on himself irreparable indigence and contempt, his temper, formerly so sprightly, began to grow gloomy and unequal; he grew more fond of solitude, and more liable to
<PB N="202" REF="210"/>
take offence at supposed injuries; in short, for a week before he shot himself, his friends were of opinion, that he medita∣ted some such horrid design. He was found in his chamber fallen on the floor, the bullet having glanced on the bone, and lodged behind his right eye.</P>
<P>You remember my Lord, what a charm∣ing fellow this deluded man was once. How benevolent, just, temperate, and every way virtuous; the only faults of his mind arose from motives of humanity; he was too easy, credulous, and good-natured, and unable to resist temptation, when re∣commended by the voice of friendship. These foibles the vicious and the needy soon perceived, and what was at first a weakness they soon perverted into guilt; he became a gamester, and continued the infamous profession, 'till he could support the miseries it brought with it no longer.</P>
<P>I have often been not a little concerned to see the first introduction of a young man of fortune to the gaming-table. With
<PB N="203" REF="211"/>
what eagerness his company is courted by the whole fraternity of sharpers, how they find out his most latent wishes, in order to make way to his affections by gratifying them; and continue to hang upon him with the meanest degree of condescension. The youthful dupe no way suspecting, imagines himself surrounded by friends and gentlemen, and incapable of even suspect∣ing that men of such seeming good sense, and so genteel an appearance, should devi∣ate from the laws of honour, walks into the snare, nor is he undeceived till schooled by the severity of experience.</P>
<P>As I suppose no man would be a gamester unless he hoped to win, so I fancy it would be easy to reclaim him, if he was once effectually convinced, that by continuing to play he must certainly lose. Permit me, my Lord, to attempt this task, and to shew, that no young gentleman by a year's run of play, and in a mixed company, can pos∣sibly be a gainer.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="212"/>Let me suppose in the first place, that the chances on both sides are equal, that there are no marked cards, no pinching, shuff∣ling, nor hiding; let me suppose that the players also have no advantage of each other in point of judgment, and still fur∣ther let me grant, that the party is only formed at home, without going to the usual expensive places of resort frequented by gamesters. Even with all these cir∣cumstances in the young gamester's fa∣vour, it is evident he cannot be a gainer. With equal players after a year's continu∣ance of any particular game it will be found, that, whatever has been played for, the winnings on either side are very incon∣siderable, and most commonly nothing at all. Here then is a year's anxiety, pain, jarring, and suspense, and nothing gained; were the parties to sit down and professed∣ly play for nothing, they would contemn the proposal, they would call it trifling away time, and one of the most insipid amusements in nature; yet in fact, how do equal players differ; it is allowed that little or nothing can be gained; but much is lost; our youth, our time, those moments that may be laid
<PB N="205" REF="213"/>
out in pleasure or improvement are foolish∣ly squandered away, in tossing cards, fret∣ting at ill luck, or, even with a run of luck in our favour, fretting that our winnings are so small.</P>
<P>I have now stated gaming in that point of view in which it is alone defensible, as a commerce carried on with equal advantage and loss to either party, and it appears, that the loss is great, and the advantage but small. But let me suppose the players not to be equal, but the superiority of judgment in our own favour. A person who plays under this conviction, however, must give up all pretensions to the approbation of his own mind, and is guilty of as much injustice, as the thief who robbed a blind man, because he knew he could not swear to his person.</P>
<P>But in fact, when I allowed the superi∣ority of skill on the young beginner's side, I only granted an impossibility. Skill in gaming, like skill in making a watch, can only be acquired by long and painful in∣dustry. The most sagacious youth alive
<PB N="206" REF="214"/>
was never taught at once all the arts, and all the niceties of gaming. Every passion must be schooled by long habit into cau∣tion, and phlegm; the very countenance must be taught proper discipline; and he who would practice this art with success, must practice on his own constitution, all the severities of a martyr, without any ex∣pectation of the reward. It is evident therefore every beginner must be a dupe, and can only be expected to learn his trade by losses, disappointments, and dishonour.</P>
<P>If a young gentleman therefore begins to game, the commencements are sure to be to his disadvantage; and all that he can promise himself is, that the company he keeps, tho' superior in skill, are above taking advantage of his ignorance, and un∣acquainted with any sinister arts to correct fortune. But this however is but a poor hope at best, and what is worse, most fre∣quently a false one. In general, I might almost have said always, those who live by gaming, are not beholding to chance alone for their support, but take every ad∣vantage
<PB N="207" REF="215"/>
which they can practise without danger of detection. I know many are apt to say, and I have once said so myself, that after I have shuffled the cards, it is not in the power of a sharper to pack them; but at present I can confidently assure your Lord∣ship, that such reasoners are deceived. I have seen men both in <HI>Paris,</HI> the <HI>Hague,</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> who, after three deals, could give whatever hands they pleased to all the company. However, the usual way with sharpers is to correct fortune thus but once in a night, and to play in other respects without blunder or mistake, and a perse∣verance in this practice always balances the year in their favour.</P>
<P>It is impossible to enumerate all the tricks and arts practised upon cards; few but have seen those bungling poor fellows who go about at coffee-houses perform their clumsy feats, and yet, indifferently as they are versed in the trade, they often deceive us; when such as these are possess∣ed of so much art, what must not those be, who have been bred up to gaming from
<PB N="208" REF="216"/>
their infancy, whose hands are not like those mentioned above, rendered callous by labour, who have continual practice in the trade of deceiving, and where the eye of the spectator is less upon its guard.</P>
<P>Let the young beginner only reflect, by what a variety of methods it is possible to cheat him, and perhaps it will check his confidence. His antagonists may act by signs and confederacy, and this he can never detect; they may cut to a particular card after three or four hands have gone about, either by having that card pinch∣ed, or broader than the rest, or by having an exceeding fine wire thrust between the folds of the paper, and just peeping out at the edge. Or the cards may be chalk∣ed with particular marks, which none but the sharper can understand, or a new pack may be slipped in at a proper oppor∣tunity. I have known myself in <HI>Paris,</HI> a fellow thus detected with a tin case, con∣taining two packs of cards concealed with∣in his shirt sleeve, and which, by means of a spring, threw the cards ready packed
<PB N="209" REF="217"/>
into his hands. These and an hundred other arts may be practised with impunity, and escape detection.</P>
<P>The great error lies in imagining every fellow with a laced coat to be a gentleman. The address and transient behaviour of a man of breeding are easily acquired, and none are better qualified than gamesters in this respect. At first, their complaisance, civility, and appa∣rent honour is pleasing, but upon examina∣tion, few of them will be found to have their minds sufficiently stored with any of the more refined accomplishments, which truly characterize the man of breed∣ing. This will commonly serve as a cri∣terion to distinguish them, tho' there are other marks which every young gen∣tleman of fortune should be apprized of. A sharper, when he plays, generally hand∣les and deals the cards aukwardly like a bungler; he advances his bets by de∣grees, and keeps his antagonist in spirits by small advantages and alternate success at the beginning; to shew all his force
<PB N="210" REF="218"/>
at once, would but fright the bird he in∣tends to decoy; he talks of honour and virtue, and his being a gentleman, and that he knows great men, and mentions his coal mines, and his estate in the coun∣try; he is totally divested of that mascu∣line confidence, which is the attendant of real fortune; he turns, yields, assents, smiles, as he hopes will be most pleasing to his destined prey; he is afraid of meet∣ing a shabby acquaintance, particularly if in better company; as he grows richer, he wears finer cloaths; and if ever he is seen in an undress, it is most probable he is without money; so that seeing a game∣ster growing finer each day, is a certain symptom of his success.</P>
<P>The young gentleman who plays with such men for considerable sums, is sure to be undone, and yet we seldom see, even the rook himself make a fortune. A life of gaming must necessarily be a life of ex∣travagance, parties of this kind are form∣ed in houses, where the whole profits are consumed, and while those who play,
<PB N="211" REF="219"/>
mutually ruin each other, they only who keep the house or the table acquire fortunes. Thus gaming may readily ruin a fortune, but has seldom been found to retrieve it. The wealth which has been acquired with industry and hazard, and preserved for a∣ges by prudence and foresight, is swept away on a sudden; and when a be∣sieging sharper sits down before an estate, the property is often transferred in less time, than the writings can be drawn to secure the possession. The neglect of bu∣siness, and the extravagance of a mind which has been taught to covet precarious pos∣session, brings on premature destruction; tho' poverty may fetch a compass and go somewhat about, yet will it reach the gamester at last; and tho' his ruin be slow, yet it is certain.</P>
<P>A thousand instances could be given of the fatal tendency of this passion, which first impoverishes the mind, and then per∣verts the understanding. Permit me to mention one, not caught from report, or dressed up by fancy, but such as has
<PB N="212" REF="220"/>
actually fallen under my own observation, and of the truth of which, I beg your Lordship may rest satisfied.</P>
<P>At <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> in the year 1715, Mr. <HI>J. Hedges</HI> made a very brilliant appear∣ance; he had been married about two years to a young lady of great beauty and large fortune; they had one child, a boy, on whom they bestowed all that affection, which they could spare from each other. He knew nothing of gaming, nor seemed to have the least passion for play; but he was unacquainted with his own heart; he began by degrees to bett at the tables for trifling sums, and his soul took fire at the prospect of immediate gain; he was soon surrounded with sharpers, who with calm∣ness lay in ambush for his fortune, and cooly took advantage of the precipitancy of his passions.</P>
<P>His lady perceived the ruin of her fa∣mily approaching, but at first, without being able to form any scheme to prevent it. She advised with his brother, who at
<PB N="213" REF="221"/>
that time was possessed of a small fellow∣ship in <HI>Cambridge.</HI> It was easily seen, that whatever passion took the lead in her husband's mind, seemed to be there fixed unalterably; it was determined therefore, to let him pursue fortune, but previously take measures, to prevent the pursuits be∣ing fatal.</P>
<P>Accordingly every night this gentleman was a constant attender at the hazard ta∣bles; he understood neither the arts of sharpers, nor even the allowed strokes of a connoisseur, yet still he played. The consequence is obvious; he lost his estate, his equipage, his wife's jewels, and every other moveable that could be parted with, except a repeating watch. His agony upon this occasion was inexpressible; he was even mean enough to ask a gentleman, who sate near, to lend him a few pieces, in order to turn his fortune; but this prudent gamester, who plainly saw there were no expectations of being repaid, refused to lend a farthing, alledging a former reso∣lution against lending. <HI>Hedges</HI> was at last
<PB N="214" REF="222"/>
furious with the continuance of ill success, and pulling out his watch, asked if any person in company, would set him sixty guineas upon it: the company were si∣lent; he then demanded fifty; still no an∣swer; he sunk to forty, thirty, twenty; finding the company still without answer∣ing, he cried out by <HI>G—d</HI> it shall never go for less, and dashed it against the floor, at the same time, attempting to dash out his brains against the marble chimney-piece.</P>
<P>This last act of desperation, immedi∣diately excited the attention of the whole company; they instantly gathered round, and prevented the effects of his passion; and after he again became cool, he was permitted to return home, with sullen dis∣content, to his wife. Upon his entering her apartment, she received him with her usual tenderness and satisfaction; while he answered her caresses with contempt and severity; his disposition being quite altered with his misfortunes. But my dear <HI>Jemmy,</HI> says his wife, perhaps you don't
<PB N="215" REF="223"/>
know the news I have to tell; <HI>My Mam∣ma's old uncle is dead, the messenger is now in the house, and you know his estate is settled upon you.</HI> This account seemed only to en∣crease his agony, and looking angrily at her, he cried, there you lie, my dear, his estate it not settled upon me. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I beg your pardon, says she, I really thought it was, at least you have always told me so.</HI>"</Q> No, returned he, as sure as you and I are to be miserable here, and our children beggars hereafter, I have sold the reversion of it this day, and have lost every farthing I got for it at the hazard table. <Q REND="inline">"What, all",</Q> replied the Lady. Yes every farthing, returned he, and I owe a thousand pounds more than I have to pay. Thus speaking, he took a few frantic steps across the room. When the Lady had a little enjoyed his perplexity. <HI>No my dear, cried she, you have lost but a trifle, and you owe nothing, our brother and I have taken care to pre∣vent the effects of your rashness, and are actu∣ally the persons, who have won your fortune; we employed proper persons for this purpose, who brought their winnings to me; your mo∣ney,
<PB N="216" REF="224"/>
your equipage, are in my possession, and here I return them to you, from whom they were unjustly taken, I only ask permission to keep my jewels, and to keep you, my greatest jewel, from such dangers for the future.</HI> Her prudence had the proper effect, he ever after retained a sense of his former follies, and never played for the smallest sums, e∣ven for amusement.</P>
<P>Not less than three persons in one day, fell a sacrifice at <HI>Bath</HI> to this destructive passion. Two gentlemen fought a duel, in which one was killed, and the other desperately wounded, and a youth of great expectation, and excellent disposition, at the same time ended his own life by a pistol. If there be any state that deserves pity, it must be that of a gamester; but the state of a dying gamester, is of all situations the most deplorable.</P>
<P>There is another argument which your lordship, I fancy, will not entirely despise; beauty, my lord, I own is at best but a trifle, but such as it is, I fancy few would wil∣lingly
<PB N="217" REF="225"/>
part with what little they have. A man with an healthful complexion, how great a philosopher soever he be, would not willingly exchange it for a sallow hectic phyz, pale eyes, and a sharp wrinkled vis∣age. I entreat you only to examine the faces of all the noted gamblers round one of our public tables; have you ever seen any thing more haggard, pinched, and mi∣serable? and it is but natural that it should be so. The succession of passions flush the cheek with red, and all such flushings are ever succeeded by consequent paleness; so that a gamester contracts the sickly hue of a student, while he is only acquiring the stupidity of a fool.</P>
<P>Your good sense, my lord, I have often had an occasion of knowing, yet how mi∣serable it is to be in a set of company where the most sensible is ever the least skilful; your footman with a little instruction, would, I dare venture to affirm, make a better and more successful gamester than you; want of passions, and low cunning, are the two great arts; and it is peculiar
<PB N="218" REF="226"/>
to this science alone, that they who have the greatest passion for it, are of all others the most unfit to practise it.</P>
<P>Of all the men I ever knew, <HI>Spedding</HI> was the greatest blockhead, and yet the best gamester, he saw almost intuitively the advantage on either side, and ever took it; he could calculate the odds in a moment, and decide upon the merits of a cock or an horse, better than any man in <HI>England</HI>; in short he was such an adept in gaming, that he brought it up to a pitch of sublimity it had never attained before; yet with all this, <HI>Spedding</HI> could not write his own name. What he died worth I cannot tell, but of this I am certain, he might have possest a ministerial estate, and that won from men, famed for their sense, literature and patri∣otism.</P>
<P>If after this description, your Lordship is yet resolved to hazard your fortune at gaming, I beg you would avert to the si∣tuation of an old and luckless gamester. Perhaps there is not in nature a more de∣plorable being, his character is too well
<PB N="219" REF="227"/>
marked, he is too well known to be trust∣ed. A man that has been often a bank∣rupt, and renewed trade upon low com∣positions, may as well expect extensive cre∣dit as such a man. His reputation is blast∣ed, his constitution worn, by the extrava∣gance and ill hours of his profession, he is now incapable of alluring his dupes, and like a superannuated savage of the forest, he is starved for want of vigour to hunt after prey.</P>
<P>Thus gaming is the source of poverty, and still worse, the parent of infamy and vice. It is an inlet to debauchery, for the money thus acquired is but little valued. Every gamester is a rake, and his morals worse than his mystery. It is his inte∣rest to be exemplary in every scene of de∣bauchery, his prey is to be courted with every guilty pleasure; but these are to be changed, repeated, and embellished, in order to employ his imagination, while his reason is kept asleep; a young mind is apt to shrink at the prospect of ruin, care must be taken to harden his courage, and make
<PB N="220" REF="228"/>
him keep his rank; he must be either found a libertine, or he must be made one. And when a man has parted with his money like a fool, he generally sends his consci∣ence after it like a villain, and the nearer he is to the brink of destruction, the fonder does he grow of ruin.</P>
<P>Your friend and mine, my Lord, had been thus driven to the last reserve, he found it impossible to disentangle his af∣fairs, and look the world in the face; im∣patience at length threw him into the abyss he feared, and life became a burthen, because he feared to die. But I own that play is not always attended with such tra∣gical circumstances, some have had cou∣rage to survive their losses, and go on content with beggary; and sure those misfortunes, which are of our own production, are of all others most pungent. To see such a poor disbanded being an unwelcome guest at every table, and often flapped off like a fly, is affecting; in this case the closest al∣liance is forgotten, and contempt is too strong for the ties of blood to unbind.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="229"/>But however fatal this passion may be in its consequence, none allures so much in the beginning, the person once listed as a gamester, if not soon reclaimed, pursues it strough his whole life; no loss can re∣tard, no danger awaken him to com∣mon sense; nothing can terminate his ca∣reer but want of money to play, or of ho∣nour to be trusted.</P>
<P>Among the number of my acquaintance, I knew but of two who succeeded by gaming; the one a phlegmatic heavy man, who would have made a fortune in what∣ever way of life he happened to be placed; the other who had lost a fine estate in his youth by play, and retrieved a greater at the age of sixty five, when he might be justly said, to be past the power of enjoying it. One or two successful gamesters are thus set up in an age to al∣lure the young beginner; we all regard such, as the highest prize in a lottery, unmind∣ful of the numerous losses that go to the accumulation of such infrequent success.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="230"/>Yet I would not be so morose, as to re∣fuse your youth all kinds of play, the inno∣cent amusements of a family must often be indulged, and cards allowed to supply the intervals of more real pleasure; but the sum played for in such cases should always be a trifle; something to call up attention, but not engage the passions. The usual ex∣cuse for laying large sums is, to make the players attend to their game; but in fact, he that plays only for shillings, will mind his cards equally well, with him that betts guineas; for the mind, habi∣tuated to stake large sums, will consider them as trifles at last; and if one shilling could not exclude indifference at first, neither will an hundred in the end.</P>
<P>I have often asked myself, how it is pos∣sible that he who is possessed of compe∣tence, can ever be induced to make it precarious, by beginning play with the odds against him; for wherever he goes to sport his money, he will find himself over matched and cheated. Either at
<PB N="223" REF="231"/>
<HI>White</HI>'s, <HI>New-market,</HI> the <HI>Tennis Court,</HI> the <HI>Cock Pit,</HI> or the <HI>Billiard Table,</HI> he will find numbers who have no other re∣source, but their acquisitions there; and if such men live like gentlemen, he may readily conclude it must be on the spoils of his fortune, or the for∣tunes of ill judging men like himself. Was he to attend but a moment to their manner of betting at those places he would readily find the gamester seldom proposing betts, but with the advantage in his own favour. A man of honour continues to lay on the side on which he first won; but gamesters shift, change, lie upon the lurch, and take every advantage, either of our ignorance or neglect.</P>
<P>In short, my Lord, if a man designs to lay out his fortune in quest of pleasure, the gaming table is, of all other places, that where he can have least for his money. The company are superficial, extravagant, and unentertaining; the conversation flat, debauched, and absurd; the hours unna∣tural, and fatiguing; the anxiety of losing,
<PB N="224" REF="232"/>
is greater than the pleasure of winning; friendship must be banished from that so∣ciety, the members of which are intent only on ruining each other; every other improvement, either in knowledge or vir∣tue, can scarce find room in that breast, which is possessed by the spirit of play; the spirits become vapid, the constitution is enfeebled, the complexion grows pale, till, in the end, the mind, body, friends, fortune, and even the hopes of futurity sink together! Happy, if nature terminates the scene, and neither justice nor suicide are called in to accelerate her tardy approach.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>To</HI> Richard Nash, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>King of</HI> Bath.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIRE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Must desire your Majesty to order the inclosed to be read to the great Mr. <HI>Hoyle,</HI> if he be found in any part of your dominions. You will perceive, that it is a panegyrick on his manifold virtues, and that he is thanked more particularly for spending his time so much to the emolu∣ment of the public, and for obliging the world with a book more read than the Bible, and which so eminently tends to promote christian knowledge, sound mo∣rality, and the happiness of mankind.</P>
<P>(<HI>The inclosed we have omitted, as it contains a satire on gaming, and may probably give of∣fence to our betters.</HI>)</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="234"/>This author, however (continues the letter writer) has not set forth half the merits of the piece under consideration, nor is the great care which he has taken to prevent our reading any other book, in∣stead of this, been sufficiently taken notice of: <HI>beware of counterfeits, these books are not to be depended on, unless signed by</HI> E. Hoyle, is a charitable admonition. As you have so much power at <HI>Bath,</HI> and are absolute, I think you should imitate other great monarchs, by rewarding those with honours who have been serviceable in your state; and I beg that a new order may be established for that purpose. Let him who has done nothing but game all his life, and has reduced the most families to ruin and beggary, be made a <HI>Marshal of the Black Ace</HI>; and those who are every day making proselytes to the tables, have the honour of knighthood conferred on them, and be distinguished by the style and title of <HI>Knights of the four Knaves.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="235"/>The moment I came into <HI>Bath,</HI> my ears were saluted with the news of a gentle∣man's being plundered at the gaming ta∣ble, and having lost his senses on the occa∣sion. The same day a duel was fought be∣tween two gentlemen gamesters on the Downs, and in the evening another hanged himself at the <HI>Bear</HI>; but first wrote a note, which was found near him, importing that he had injured the best of friends. These are the atchievements of your <HI>Knights of the four Knaves.</HI> The Devil will pick the bones of all gamesters, that's cer∣tain!—Ay! and of duellers too! but in the mean time let none think that duelling is a mark of courage; for I know it is not. A person served under me in <HI>Flanders</HI> who had fought four duels, and depended so much on his skill, the strength of his arm, and the length of his sword, that he would take up a Quarrel for any body; yet, in the field, I never saw one behave so like a poltroon. If a few of these gamesters and duellers were gibbeted, it might per∣haps help to amend the rest. I have often
<PB N="228" REF="236"/>
thought, that the only way, or at least, the most effectual way, to prevent duelling, would be to hang both parties, the living and the dead, on the same tree<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A scheme to prevent duelling, similar to this, was attempted by <HI>Gustavus Adolphus</HI>; and is thus recorded by the writer of his life.<Q REND="inline"><P>"In one of the <HI>Prussian</HI> Campaigns, when the ir∣rational practice of duelling arose to a considerable height in the <HI>Swedish</HI> army, not only amongst persons of rank and fashion, but even amongst common sol∣diers. This prince published a severe edict, and de∣nounced death against every delinquent. Soon after, a quarrel arose between two officers of very high com∣mand, and as they knew the king's firmness in pre∣serving his word inviolable, they agreed to request an audience, and besought his permission to decide the affair like men of honour. His Majesty took fire in a moment, but repressed his passion with such art, that they easily mistook him; of course with some reluct∣ance, but under the appearance of pitying brave men, who thought their reputation injured, he told them, that he blamed them much for their mistaken notions, concerning Fame and Glory; yet as this unreasonable determination appeared to be the result of deliberate re∣flection, to the best of their deluded capacity, he would allow them to decide the affair at the time and place specified: and, gentlemen, said he, I will be an eye witness myself of your extraordinary valour and prowess."</P></Q></P>

<P>At the hour appointed <HI>Gustavus</HI> arrived, accompa∣nied by a small body of infantry, whom he formed into a circle round the combatants. <Q REND="inline">"Now, says he, fight till one man dies;"</Q> and calling the executioner of the army to him (or the provost-marshal, as the lan∣guage then ran) <Q REND="inline">"Friend, added he, the instant one is killed, behead the other before my eyes."</Q></P>
<P>Astonished with such inflexible firmness, the two generals, after pausing a moment, fell down on their knees, and asked the king's forgiveness, who made them embrace each other, and give their promise to continue faithful friends to their last moments; as they did with sincerity and thankfulness.</P></NOTE>; and if
<PB N="229" REF="237"/>
the winner and the loser were treated in the same manner, it would be better for the publick; since the tucking up of a few R—ls might be a warning to others, and save many a worthy family from destruc∣tion.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The author of this letter appears to have been very angry, and not without reason; for if I am rightly informed, his only son was ruined at <HI>Bath,</HI> and by sharpers.
<PB N="230" REF="238"/>
But why is <HI>Nash</HI> to be blamed for this? It must be acknowledged, that he al∣ways took pains to prevent the ruin of the youth of both sexes, and had so guarded against duelling, that he would not permit a sword to be worn in <HI>Bath.</HI></P>
<P>As the heart of a man is better known by his private than public actions, let us take a view of <HI>Nash</HI> in domestick life; among his servants and dependants where no gloss was required to colour his senti∣ments and disposition, nor any mask ne∣cessary to conceal his foibles. Here we shall find him the same open-hearted, ge∣nerous, good-natured man we have already described; one who was ever fond of pro∣moting the interests of his friends, his ser∣vants and dependants, and making them happy. In his own house no man per∣haps was more regular, chearful, and be∣neficent than Mr. <HI>Nash.</HI> His table was always free to those who sought his friend∣ship, or wanted a dinner; and after grace was said, he usually accosted the company in the following extraordinary manner, to
<PB N="231" REF="239"/>
take off all restraint and ceremony. <Q REND="inline">"Come, gentlemen, eat and welcome, spare, and the Devil choak you."</Q> I mention this circumstance for no other reason but be∣cause it is well known, and is consistent with the singularity of his character and behaviour.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>'s thoughts were entirely em∣ployed in the affairs of his government, he was seldom at home but at the time of eating or of rest. His table was well serv∣ed, but his entertainment consisted princi∣pally of plain dishes. Boiled chicken and roast mutton were his favourite meats, and he was so fond of the small sort of pota∣toes, that he called them <HI>English</HI> pine∣apples, and generally eat them as others do fruit, after dinner. In drinking he was altogether as regular and abstemious. Both in this and in eating, he seemed to consult nature, and obey only her dictates. Good small beer, with or without a glass of wine in it, and sometimes wine and water, was his drink at meals, and after dinner he generally drank one glass of wine. He
<PB N="232" REF="240"/>
seemed fond of hot suppers, usually supped about nine or ten o'clock, upon roast breast of mutton and his potatoes, and soon af∣ter supper went to bed; which induced Dr. <HI>Cheney</HI> to tell him jestingly, <HI>that he be∣haved like other brutes, and lay down as soon as he had filled his belly. Very true,</HI> replied Nash, <HI>and this prescription I had from my neighbour's Cow, who is a better physician than you, and a superior judge of plants, notwith∣standing you have written so learnedly on the ve∣getable diet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nash</HI> generally arose early in the morn∣ing, being seldom in bed after five: and to avoid disturbing the family, and depriving his servants of their rest, he had the fire laid after he was in bed, and in the morn∣ing lighted it himself, and sat down to read some of his few, but well chosen books. After reading some time, he usually went to the pump-room and drank the wa∣ters; then took a walk on the parade, and went to the coffee-house to breakfast; af∣ter which, till two o'clock (his usual time of dinner) his hours were spent in arbi∣trating
<PB N="233" REF="241"/>
differences amongst his neighbours, or the company resorting to the wells; di∣recting the diversions of the day, in visit∣ing the new comers, or receiving friends at his own house, of which there were a great concourse till within six or eight years before his death.</P>
<P>His generosity and charity in private life, tho' not so conspicuous, was as great as that in publick, and indeed far more con∣siderable than his little income would ad∣mit of. He could not stifle the natural impulse which he had to do good, but frequently borrowed money to relieve the distressed; and when he knew not con∣veniently where to borrow, he has been often observed to shed tears, as he passed through the wretched supplicants who at∣tended his gate.</P>
<P>This sensibility, this power of feeling the misfortunes of the miserable, and his address and earnestness in relieving their wants, exalts the character of Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> and draws an impenetrable veil over his
<PB N="234" REF="242"/>
foibles. His singularities are forgotten when we behold his virtues, and he who laughed at the whimsical character and be∣haviour of this Monarch of <HI>Bath,</HI> now laments that he is no more.</P>

<P>Biography has, ever since the Days of <HI>Plu∣tarch,</HI> been considered as the most useful man∣ner of Writing, not only from the Pleasure it affords the Imagination, but from the Instruction it artfully and unexpectedly conveys to the Under∣standing, It furnishes us with an Opportunity of giving Advice freely, and without Offence. It not only removes the Dryness and dogmatical Air of Precept, but sets Persons, Actions, and their Consequences before us in the most striking Man∣ner; and by that Means turns even Precept into Example: Whence arises the Propriety of placing these Volumes in the Hands of Youth.</P>
<P>A Gentleman of uncommon Understanding, be∣ing asked what was the best Lesson for Youth? answered, <HI>The Life of a good Man:</HI> And being ask∣ed, what was the next best? replied, <HI>The Life of a bad one:</HI> For, that the first would make him in love with Virtue, and teach him how to conduct himself through Life, so as to become an Orna∣ment to Society, and a Blessing to his Family and Friends; and the last would point out the hateful Consequences of Vice, and make him careful to avoid those Actions himself which appeared so de∣testable in others.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What Histories can be found (says the Mar∣quis <HI>De Montesquieu</HI>) that please and instruct like the Lives of <HI>Plutarch</HI>? He paints the Man whose Life he relates; he makes him known such as he was at the Head of the Armies, in the
<PB REF="246"/>
Government of the People, in his own Family, and in his Pleasures. In short, I am of the same Opinion with that Author, who said, that if he was constrained to fling all the Books of the Antients into the Sea, PLUTARCH <HI>should be the last drowned.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>In the Course of this Work, all those Actions which are usually called Great and Glorious, but which are productive of the most mischievous Ef∣fects, will be particularly considered, stript of their captivating Glare, and reduced to the Standard of Reason and of Justice.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. The WORLD DISPLAYED! Or, a curious Collection of Voyages and Travels, from the Writers of all Nations. In which the Con∣jectures and Interpolations of several vain Editors and Translators are expunged; every Relation is made concise and plain, and the Divisions of Coun∣tries and Kingdoms are clearly and distinctly noted. In 20 Volumes, Price 1 l. 10 s. sewed, or 2 l. bound in Calf.
<P>Curiosity is seldom so powerfully excited, or so amply gratified, as by faithful Relations of Voy∣ages and Travels. The different Appearances of Nature, and the various Customs of Men, the gradual Discovery of the World, and the Acci∣dents and Hardships of a naval Life, all concur to fill the Mind with Expection and with Won∣der; and as Science, when it can be connected with Events, is always more easily learned, and more certainly remembered, the History of a Voyage may be considered as the most useful Treatise on Geography, since the Student follows the Travellers from Country to Country, and re∣tains the Situation of Places by recounting his Adventures. It is hoped that this Collection wil be favourably received, as no one has hitherto been offered so cheap, or so commodious.</P></ITEM>
