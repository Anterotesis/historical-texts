<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF TATE WILKINSON.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE been told I could prevent riotous proceed∣ings.—But I must beg leave to observe, that the∣atrical opinions are so variable, unsettled, and pre∣judiced, that I fear my reasons will have as little effect as if I were to entreat that all metho∣dists would follow the playhouse, or that metho∣dists could persuade all play attendants to become devotees at the tabernacle.</P>
<P>The good government that prevails in general at Drury Lane and Covent Garden theatres is owing to uniformity; decorum begets decorum. Consequently the strict order to be found in the London audiences does not owe its happy pre∣servation entirely to three or four constables in waiting, or to ten or twelve of the King's guards.
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
Witness the great riot on the Chinese Festival at Drury Lane, in spite of the sanction of his Majesty King George the Second, who was there in person.</P>
<P>Another instance.—When the French actors were to have performed at the Haymarket theatre, Justice Du <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eil, attended by constables, and re∣inforced with the King's guards, were defeated by numbers and determined phrenzy; then, truly, might overcame right.</P>
<P>Nay, yearly at Christmas holidays in London, on retrospection, the plays are indistinctly and with difficulty got through.</P>
<P>On an uproar, when Lady Coventry and seve∣ral other persons of quality were obliged to quit the stage-box, on account of a supposed affront given to Miss Bellamy in Juliet, it was the audi∣ence and not any other force compelled those di∣sturbers to leave the theatre.</P>
<P>In 1754, when Captain Smith of the guards gave offence on the first night Mr Murphy ap∣peared in Jaffier, and only his second character on the stage, it was the general voice that would not permit the play to pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d till the cause of inter∣ruption was re <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oved.</P>
<P>At York formerly, on a Shrove Tuesday, mere∣ly from a savage custom, the upper gallery was so noisy from num ers, that it could not be con∣quered but by raising the price on that night, and
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
which has by the experiment in a great measure removed the evil.</P>
<P>I beg leave to be here understood as speaking of theatres in general; but when the propriety of London is singled out, let it be well recollected that <HI>the audiences there preserve their own respect;</HI> for the instant the curtain draws up all noise subsides, and every person sits down; nor will they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uffer the actors to proceed if a hat remains on a head: but in most country theatres, when the perform∣ance begins, the vgazers in the galleries stand up, and with their hats on; nay hats are too often seen on in the pit.</P>
<P>If at London a rioter is vociferous in the gal∣lery, they are from custom and good regulation so habituated to order and necessary attention, that the offender is by <HI>universal</HI> consent delivered over to the constables, who not only conducts the cul∣prit out of the gallery, but if guilty of throwing bottles, &amp;c. on the stage, or into the pit or boxes, he is conveyed before a justice to be properly punish∣ed. A disturbance there, even of a short dura∣tion, seldom happens in the pit; for the instant of interruption the person is removed by force, and turned out with disgrace and ignominy.</P>
<P>To repeat more as to myself concerning the winter at Edinburgh in 1765 would not only be fulsome and impertinent, but is far from being
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
necessary, nor would it be entertaining. I acted a variety of characters, and suffice it to say I was well received, and met with great civilities and in∣dulgences: Richard, Bayes, and Foote's pieces were repeated. My first benefit, on Friday, March 22, was a fine house: Alexander was revived, with a triumph, &amp;c. at the managers' expence, and a farce written by Mr. Chaigneau, of Dublin, called Harlequin Soldier, taken from the French. My se∣cond benefit was the last night in the season, Sa∣turday, April 13, another play, never acted there, called Coriolanus, with a new burlesque farce in two acts, wrote by Dr. Schombergh of Bath, called Bucephalus: The play pleased much—the farce not at all—though after playing Co∣riolanus I produced myself as Princess Statira. In a few days I engaged to proceed with the ma∣nagers and company to Glasgow, where my bar∣gain was chiefly dependent on two clear benefits, and full of hopes that a second fire would not be wickedly put into practice, or even attempted, as had been the year before. Most of the same plays acted at Edinburgh were ready, and repeated at Glasgow. My first benefit was upwards of 62 l. The play was Henry the Fourth; Falstaff, Mr. Lancaster; Prince of Wales, Mr. Aickin; Hotspur, Mr. Wilkinson: The farce I have forgot.—Lan∣caster was a great favourite at Edinburgh.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7"/>
My second benefit was only 30l.—The Play was Essex: Essex, Mr. Wilkinson; with Tra∣gedy A-la-Mode, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The sensible, the friendly, the spirited, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vivacious Mr. Sinclair (of whom York boasts as an honourable acquisition to its inhabitants) was that year at Glasgow college: I have had the plea∣sure of hearing him declare the first play he ever saw acted was the night I appeared in the difficult character of King Lear at the Glasgow theatre; and whether the performance was super-excellent or the contrary is not for me to determine: But I dare affirm (being the first impression made on his youthful mind) that he was highly delighted, and will never forget Wilkinson's Lear, let any ac∣tor's merit, how great soever, interfere on his sight and more enlightened judgment.</P>
<P>I do not recollect any circumstance worth re∣lating in that trip to Glasgow, except my having the pleasure of being on a degree of intimacy with the worthy Mr. John Moore, known better by be∣ing called the good <HI>Johnny Moore;</HI> he was a gentleman (very extraordinary to say) that every body loved and respected. At his house I was often most agreeably entertained, and particularly whenever Mr. Nicholson Stewart and others paid him a visit, and came on a trip to se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the play from Edinburgh. That said good character Mr.
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
Moore, is mentioned, not only by Mrs. Bellamy, but also by Doctor Smollet in his novel of Hum∣phrey Clinker; all praised and loved him: and surely what every one said must be true. I returned from Glasgow to Newcastle, where my old friend Mr. Baker, manager of the York company, was stationed at the races at that town. It was their usual yearly service at that time for the summer season, till York meeting the latter end of August.</P>
<P>I acted Cadwalladar on the Saturday in the New∣castle race-week, and Major Sturgeon the Mon∣day following,—I had indeed been secretly en∣gaged by Mr. Baker for Newcastle (where I had never played till that time) before my departure from Glasgow. I continued at Newcastle (to the finishing of the season in August) at Mr. Parker's, the Turk's-Head in the Big Market, which house Mr. Baker for many years made his constant place of residence. All went smoothly on—we had a good race-week, a good assize-week, and several very good benefits.—Sir Francis Delaval cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> down that summer from the south to his seat of Seaton Delaval, built as I have been told under Sir John Vanbrugh's direction:—Mr. David Ross came there at the same time by the invitation of Sir Francis:—Sir John (now Lord) Delaval and his Lady were there; also Thomas Delaval, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the younger brother; (and sorry am I to add, wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
is well known, that when Sir Francis died I lost a valuable and honourable friend; the younger brother is also dead). So that with engagements at Sir Francis Delaval's, many invitations at Newcastle, where they are particularly hospitable, my time passed agreeably and profitably. I set myself a hard task preparatory to my own benefit, which was to finish the season, by getting up Mr. Macklin's favourite farce of Love A-la-Mode: With patience and assiduity it was a possible work, and promised much credit and cash:—To tell the truth I had by luck obtained the parts by the following method:—The part of Sir Archy I had to prepare myself in; Mr. Garrick sent it to me at Winchester in the year 1760; Squire Groom from my friend Ned Shuter; Mordecai from Mr. Creswick, who had acted the part at Covent Garden; the lady's part from Mrs. Burden's copy, who played it at the same theatre: So I had only to make the Irish character of Sir Callaghan, which by the fre∣quency of seeing the farce, and the help of the first act being printed in a magazine, made it with a little trouble more than half ready to my hands; Sir Theodore, a part from remembrance; the rest of my own manufacture.</P>
<P>Mr. Macklin, it is true, was justifiably angry; but mine, for his credit, was better acted, and
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
more like his farce than the stuff given in every country town with pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oined lines only: And Mr. Shylock to me proved himself no Jew, but a friend and a good Christian; he forgot and for∣gave, and occasionally favoured me with his per∣mission to act the farce of Love A-la-Mode; though he after, jokingly, called me a great rogue. I could not but allow the justice of his accusation; I have often invited him to visit York; but he was always better pleased by my visiting him, and accepting his cheer, good-will, and kindness, than trying the experiment of my Yorkshire board.</P>
<P>I concluded at Newcastle with Love A-la-Mode. As the farce was got up with the care and the austerity almost of Mr. Macklin himself, had he been the inspector, it was received with an universal effect, almost equal to a London repre∣sentation when that piece was in its highest esti∣mation.—At Newcastle it was cast as follows: Sir Archy, Mr. Wilkinson; Sir Callaghan, Mr. Frodsham; Squire Groom, Mr. Creswick, &amp;c. A crowded house, and from the flattering recep∣tion it was honoured with at that town, and in∣deed from the compliments I received there at that time, my vanity suggested I should be a lasting fa∣vourite; though I aftewards experienced a con∣trary
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
temper, like the saying of friends, who are soon hot and as soon cold.</P>
<P>The York races (which in the year 1765 were in their great glory) made me imagine Love A-la-Mode would prove of the highest consequence there:—Good old Mr. Baker said, he could not be happy unless his adopted son Tate Wilkinson would oblige him by being at York that race∣week; and he really treated me as a son, with one fault attending a partial father, which was, <Q REND="inline">"All I did was right."</Q> Mr. Baker's liberality I had not the least occasion to doubt; and if without any emolument whatever my services could have plea∣sed or served so worthy and kind a friend, they were sincerely at his command.—We came as fa∣ther and son to his house at-York, where in fact I was the <HI>major <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omo;</HI> and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid to I by itself I, <HI>I</HI> should do great things at the theatre from Love A-la-Mode, which would go down more plea∣santly than my tea which they had not approved; and expected to be applauded as a Garrick, a Foote, and a Macklin, in the different characters: And here, good reader, you will observe a lesson for vanity, and as efficacious and as good a cure as are Spilsbury's drops for the scurvy, or Godbold's for a consumption.—I was so assured of success with Love A-la-Mode, &amp;c. though when in May 1764 I had not thought of ever visiting York
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
again, notwithstanding I had left that city in to∣lerable favour that trip;—and mark, good reader, that to Love A-la-Mode—thereby hangs a tale and eventful history.</P>
<P>The Monday in the race week I fixed on Cad∣wallader in the farce, as a part I was certain the York audience were partial to me in, and judged I was established in their opinions. (That year, 1765, was the second of the new theatre.) When at rehearsal that noon a message was sent to me, while on the stage, that several gentlemen desired to speak with me in Mr. Baker's dining-room; I instantly obeyed the summons, (first desiring the performers to wait) and in imagination assuring myself it must certainly be a complimentary in∣tended bespoke play, for my performing in some shining character the night following. When I made my entrance into the room, in high mirth and glee, where the gentlemen were, and was singing aloud— <Q><L>York races are just now beginning,</L>
<L>The lads and their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uses are coming,</L></Q>
after my bow, and on the survey of features not recolle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing one individual face there assembled, I naturally requested to be acquainted with the ho∣nour of their comman is, as I was at that time busily engaged with my attention to the rehearsal
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
of the Author, a farce of Mr. Foote's, which was intended for that very evening; when a young gentleman quickly replied, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is that very rehearsal and farce I came to put an immediate stop to;"</Q> then turning to Mr. Baker, said, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you need not be informed the York theatre is not licensed; and if you are not acquainted with ano∣ther circumstance, I beg you will understand you are guilty of a double offence, by a flagrant breach of law and flying in the face of authority, as the impudent libel called the Author, written by that scoundrel Foote, was stopped from any future performance six years ago, in December 1758, and has not been permitted since.—My name, Mr. Wilkinson, is Aprice, and the character of Cadwallader, you mean to perform, is an affront to the memory of my father (who is now dead): As his son, by G—d, I will not suffer such inso∣lence to pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s either unnoticed or unpunished—therefore if at night you dare attempt or pre∣sume to play that farce, myself and friends are determined, one and all, not to leave a bench or scene in your theatre; so, Mr. Wilkinson your immediate and determinate answer."</Q>—I could only reply, refer to Mr. Baker, who was the manager and the proprietor; I was only on an engagement with that gentleman for the race week, and I should be guided by his opi∣nion
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
and direction.—<Q REND="inline">"Well, Mr. Baker," said Mr. Aprice, "we wait your decision."</Q>—The old gentleman spoke thus: <Q REND="inline">"Why look ye, d'ye see, gentlemen, if so be that is the case, why as to the matter of that, Mr. Wilkinson, d'ye see me, must not act Cadwallader this evening."</Q>—That, Mr. Aprice said, was all he requested, and added, that himself and friends would all attend the theatre that night, but expected no infringement to be made on the treaty, either by secret or offensive means, to cause an opposition after the manager's word was given, then wished a good race week, and Aprice and his numerous association de∣parted.</P>
<P>For some minutes Mr. Baker and I stood and gazed at each other like Gayless and Sharp after Kitty Pry's departure—where one says, <Q REND="inline">"O Sharp! Sharp!"</Q>—the other answers, <Q REND="inline">"O master! master!"</Q>—But when recovered a little from the dilemma, what was to be done? that was the question!—To be or not to be? for I could not advance forward (the Author being a favou∣rite farce) and say, <Q REND="inline">"A party of gentlemen would not suffer it to be acted, for if it was t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey threat∣ened a dangerous riot."</Q>—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or could we give out hand-bills and inform the public a performer was dangerously ill, who might immediately contra∣dict it and assert his being in perfect health: So in
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
council it was agreed to be naturally stupid, say nothing, but substitute the Mayor of Garratt, and proceed with the farce, so changed, without any apology whatever.—It certainly was the strangest mode that ever was adopted, or that ever was suf∣fered without momentous consequences, attended with strict inquiring and investigation.</P>
<P>The first scene between Sir Jacob Jollup and Mr. Lint the apothecary, the <HI>astonished</HI> audience sat, each staring in his fellow's face, like Shak∣speare's blacksmith with his hammer up and swal∣lowing a tailor's news, and concluded it was some∣thing new by Wilkinson foisted into the Author; but when I was announced as the Major, and made my entrance, the reader will not be surprised when informed I was received with an universal hiss.—I took no notice, but went on—The disap∣probation continued, but not so virulently as to occasion a stand still; and the reader may be as∣sured we lost no time in getting our work over, but wished for bed-time, and that all were well: for though I owed Heaven a debt, it is clearly evident it was not then due; and I was, like Fal∣staff, loath to pay before the day. At last the death of that day's life came on, the curtain drop∣peo, and the poor Major Sturgeon sneaked away with marks of anger following at his heels, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>unk to bed to cover himself and his dishonour.
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
So ended the first lesson of the week, where I ex∣pected to have outdone my usual outdoings; but the greatest generals have met with disgraces and misfortunes.</P>
<P>Tuesday I acted the Lyar, which went off wonderfully well; I breathed better than in the morning, and felt once more a little elated. I had fixed on the Apprentice as the entertainment, which the summer before had done much for me in London; but unfortunately it happened to be a favourite part of Mr. Frodsham's, (who in truth did not play it well, but quite the contrary) and in that character I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed again, without a single hand to assist; I laboured through a part which in London I had been much flattered by applause in the extreme; my imitations were not known in Yorkshire, therefore naturally passed without the least effect:—The reader will smile at the pleasant week I had promised myself, but I fed on thin diet, that of hope, which I doubted not would give a brilliant and good ending after the bad be∣ginning.</P>
<P>Wednesday, for my third performance, I in∣tended Sir John Brute in the Provoked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife—a favourite part in which I had been honoured with much approbation at Newcastle that summer.—The farce was the Upholsterer.—And as I had stood remarkably well in Dublin, in opposition even to that excellent actor Mr. Woodward, repeatedly in the
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
Tonsor, I judged my success could not be doubted; and indeed I was so like in voice, dress, and manner, it was a moot point which was which; but the cracking of nuts were the only tokens of appro∣bation; and my <HI>nerves</HI> are irritated at the sound from that hour to the present. I was particularly attached to Sir John Brute, and think it was not improper for me as a comedian, as I had paid the stricte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t attention to Mr. Garrick in that part, and it might have been termed a lucky performance of mine. I had not studied it from my own sug∣gestion, but first at the particular desire of Mr. <HI>Johnny Moore</HI> of Glasgow.</P>
<P>About twelve on the Wednesday, when I had finished the rehearsal of the Provoked Wife, a deputation of gentlemen were sent as ambassadors from the ladies assembled then at Giordani's con∣cert.—York races were then in their high glory. Giordani was at that time under the patronage of Lady Bingley, who had great sway in that town and county, and was really enthusiastically musical: she settled 200l. a year on him; which annuity he en∣joys to this day, and will to the end of his life.</P>
<P>The gentlemen who came from the rooms in∣formed me and Mr. Baker, that Lady Bingley, and all the ladies assembled, sent their compliments; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y wished that night to make a point of visiting the theatre before they went to the rooms, in or∣der
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
to shew every encouragement to the manager, but it was with the proviso that so indecent a play as the Provoked Wife (which the ladies could not by any means countenance, and desired if their protection and patronage was worth consideration) might be changed to another comedy; but if their request was not complied with, they should not on any account enter the theatre, as they would not by any means think of setting out so im∣proper a representation.—(Here was another bar against my rise to greatness at York, and from that fatal day my favourite part and play was al∣most exploded, and truly to my loss by its being expunged; for ladies to the boxes I never by any means could get to that well-wrote, entertaining piece, though I confess it has its blemishes.)—The ladies added, that as to the farce of the Uphol∣sterer being altered it was very immaterial, as very few would continue after the play, but go to the rooms.—More comfort still for unfortunate Wilkinson!</P>
<P>Well! the command, as it might be termed, from the boxes, was likely and necessary to be obeyed, however mortifying it was to me; fresh bills were issuedforth with every ne∣cessary information of the play being altered, at the universal desire of persons of distinction to Love in a Village, in which a lady of inimitable
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
talents and great musical abilities performed the part of Rosetta: She is now in a superior rank of life, by being united to a person distinguishable for his indefatigable talents, whose understanding has greatly added to the advantage of the commer∣cial interest of the three kingdoms, and who is uni∣versally respected.—It is almost needless to add, the gentleman's name is Palmer, Comptroller of the General Post-Office. At that time York races were remarkable for attracting the first fa∣milies, not only of that immense county, but the kingdom at large; and York was then honoured with as many ladies of the first distinction as gen∣tlemen.—But O what a falling off is there! O woe is me to have seen what I have seen, and seeing what I see.—The house was full, and the boxes were much crowded; and my only care for the evening was to prepare for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Barber—though most of the ladies and gentlemen would not wait to be SHAVED; but to those who did I was not much indebted for the compliment of their attendance, as too sure I had Pilgarlick's ill luck again; for as to my resemblance of Wood∣ward it did not occur to one in a hundred, but it struck the fancy of the million that it was a part that appertained to their favourite Robertson, their darling, (and deservedly so for he was a come∣dian of true merit). But in regard to my playing
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
the Barber, it was not that night fortunate for me that I interfered with the Edwin or the Parsons of York stage on that occasion; and my dressing like Woodward, I was afterwards informed, was in every article of it contrary to the dress of Mr. Robertson; and as they pinned their faith upon his sleeve, why he was right, and I was judged wrong in every particular; therefore absurd and assuming in Wilkinson to attempt Mr. Robert∣son's part of the Barber; he would spoil it, and was impudent, ignorant, and deserved chastise∣ment, and I quitted the stage the third night with an universal hiss and general marks of disapproba∣tion:—It was to me a week of perplexity and woe! not pleasure, to so great a man as <HI>I</HI> had fancied myself.</P>
<P>The next day I accidentally stepped into a mil∣lener's shop, where a little elderly lady sat knitting in the corner, and without once looking at me on my entrance (or if she had she would <HI>not</HI> have known me) said, <Q REND="inline">"Well, I am sure, Nanny, you never shall persuade me to go to the play again to see that hunch-backed Barber: Give me the Mourn∣ing Bride, and Mr. Frodsham, and then there is some sense in it: But for that man, that Wilkin∣son, as you call him, from London, pray let him go back and stay there, for he is the ugliest man I ever saw in my life; and so thought Jenny. I
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>
am sure if he was worth his weight in gold he should never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arry a daughter of mine."</Q>—Miss Priestley, who knew me, looked con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid, <Q REND="inline">"My dear aunt, you would alter the se∣vere opinion you are delivering to Nanny i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou were to see Mr. Wilkinson in some of his princi∣pal characters; therefore, dear aunt Doughty, go some other night, and that gentleman will make a convert of you."—"No, that he never will," replied the old la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y hastily, "for I shall never bear the si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht of him again." I turned round to her, and said, "Dear madam, do not be so very hard∣hearted—try the theatre once more when <HI>I play,</HI> and I will exert my best abilities to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou amends and deserve your better sentiments."</Q>—The old lady stared, down dropped the spectacles, the knitted garters followed, (which had busily employed her attention while speaking) and with∣out a single word she took to her heels (which were nimble) and ran away out of the back door into New-street: I laughed immoderately: but with Miss Priestley the odd circumstance had not such a whimsical effect: She appeared much hurt, and genteelly apologized for Mrs. Doughty as not being a competent judge of plays, though a wor∣thy woman, which indeed was her true cha∣racter.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="22"/>
It is strange to mention (requesting an excuse for the being tedious on so trifling and unenter∣taining a subject) the contrary effect my acting the Barber in the Upholsterer had on the same audience at a distant period from this unfortunate week in 1765.—Mr. Woodward, late in April 1771, played four nights at York; and on Sa∣turday the 27th fixed for his benefit the part of Razor, and of course was applauded and ap∣proved. The season following I acted the Bar∣ber, and was received <HI>as well</HI> as, and pronounced not only like, but equal to, Woodward; which plainly proves the difference of being an esta∣blished favourite or the contrary; and let the reader only ruminate how many actors in Lon∣don, have voices that give a shock and seem discordant to the ear on first reception; yet if any one of those performers are blessed with sterling merit, (without which he will never suc∣ceed) and the tones become customary to the ears of the audience, the very voice, which at first gave disgust, from custom will in a few years become not only familiar but even agreeable, and rejoice the good he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rers on the first distinguishable sound, even so distant as from behind the scenes; which little hint will be sufficient for a certain prepara∣tion to give shouts of welcome and applause, not
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>
only from the gods, but every part of a charmed and a resounding theatre.</P>
<P>I must not forget to mention a very particular circumstance, which was the cause of my having related the foregoing accident, and shews how strangely things occur. Know then reader, that in October 1768 (only three years after Mrs. Doughty's unfavourable opinion of me) with that said lady's own consent I actually was mar∣ried to her daughter Jane, and have this year, 1790, still the honour and happiness to call that truly good woman my wife, and the Miss Priest∣ley's I am proud to call my cousins.</P>
<P>Not having finished the career of that me∣morable race week, I must here register that For∣tune had not ceased plaguing me with my per∣formance of the Barber; for on the night following Mrs. Centlivre's play of the Busy Body was acted; Marplot, Mr. Frodsham: to which was added my highly-valued tower of strength, my Ville de Paris, called Love A-la-Mode.—Thundering ap∣plause and shouts of expectation had pleasingly di∣sturbed my sleep the night before, with glorious vast ideas, such as expecting thanks, and being the topic of admiring conversation, for the <HI>favour</HI> Mr. Wilkinson had conferred on the town by so good and unexpected a feast as Mr. Macklin's Love A-la-Mode:—Indeed one material point was gained, for the theatre was crowded in every part.
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
The York audience then were particularly luke-warm as to applause, when compared to any other established theatre; for Mr. Wood∣ward was so hurt the first night he acted at his reception, that I was under the necessity of calling on all my acquaintance the next day to as∣sure them Mr. Woodward was so chagrined by their coolne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s as to reception and expressing admi∣ration, he could not act so well as if on the Lon∣don, Dublin, or Edinburgh stages:—They took the hint, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the next night he acted Bobadil and the Apprentice, and from the different mode was so surprised and elated, that he sat up till past two, after all his fatigue (aged 57) in the highest spirits. But that serenity is now altered, as if the children of another soil, and that sometimes even to the overdoing: More than three plaudits, however their admiration may be raised, in my humble opin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, destro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s their own dignity, and three is full sufficient for any performer's greediness; beyond, enfeebles instead of strengthening the in∣tended effect: For though I well know and feel that true applause is the life and soul that gives v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gour to the player, and equal pleasure to the au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tors, and is the cordial of all cordials, the true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ramati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> elixir, yet when too often repeated from mistaken zeal it becomes faint, and the in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
compliment sinks into a joke, and is rather a sarcastic than an honoured intention to a cool, tho' highly entertained, observer. A man may be wondered at for his swiftness in running a mile, which may occasion his trying to run two <HI>swifter still,</HI> but in the trial his reputation is lost, and the strict wary eyes become weary with looking on the same object so long.</P>
<P>But to return to Love A-la-Mode, in which the first scene being merely introductory, not any applause could have been extorted from any au∣dience; silence and attention was all that could be required, and that was granted. The scene of the Jew (Beau Mordecai) followed next:—Not a smile; as I stood behind the scenes on the very tenter hooks of expectation my vanity attributed that only to the want of a little rousing and my desired appearance.—A rat-a-tat at the stage door, and now for it says I.—When I entered as Sir Archy, scarcely a hand!—My heart sunk some∣where—no matter where. I said to myself, for comfort, assume courage— <Q><L>'Tis not in mortals to command success:</L>
<L>I will do more—I will deserve it.</L></Q>
I tried and tried, but all in vain; the scene drag∣ged, and grew more and more dull: Next came Sir Callaghan, whom I was truly glad to see, as
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
it relieved me from a heavy tedious courtship with the lady which did not promise much better suc∣cess—any change, I trusted, would be for the bet∣ter.—They gave applause on seeing Frodsham, and a few simpering smiles gave me a cheerer, and I judged all would be for the better. But when I as Sir Archy, and he as Sir Callaghan were left to our∣selves in the quarrelling scene, which is truly well executed by the author, and very entertaining, in∣stead of peals of laughter, which I had assured my∣self would follow, and to my speeches in particu∣lar, the full assemblage before us seemed as if by magnetism charmed into an evening's nap—all was hush—they appeared perfectly willing to grant leave for our departure—we ended the act, but not with any honours to grace the remembrance—and indeed by the turn of faces in the boxes, and al∣most in every other part, it was very perceptible the actors or the piece were by no means ap∣proved. It was plain by its effect how dull it ap∣peared to them; and the coo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> treatment I met with was sufficiently grating to prevent a possibi∣lity of my being good company—a striking in∣stance how much depends upon a first night's re∣ception—for had they by general consent wished to have been pleased, laughed, and applaud∣ed, we should have acted better, and they would have relished and approved; but they were chilled
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
and disappointed from having expected too much, felt chagrined, and were slow as to giving the least encouragement; and it might truly be term∣ed not Love A-la-Mode that night, but the farce of Cross Purposes. I for my own part, as an actor, never felt so severe a disappointment, and wished for the week over, as I could then take my leave of York for ever.</P>
<P>While the music was playing, preparatory to the second act, Frodsham flew eagerly to get relief from his fatal and false friend, the brandy bottle. I was not quite so rash, but was contented with sending for a bottle of Madeira, of which I took large and eager libations.— <Q><L>If thus a man can die</L>
<L>Much bolder with brandy.</L> <L>So I drink off this bumper, and now I can stand the test,</L>
<L>And my comrades shall see that I die as brave as the best.</L></Q>
Thus armed (after a tedious music) by the in∣spiration of the invincible spirit of wine, I felt bold, and sallied forth once more to take the field. I had to Frodsham confessed myself disappointed and hurt, however submissive resignation to the decrees of the Fates was indispensable; and as an honest witness on a trial often gives weight to the jury, so did I rest hopes on my Squire Groom's set∣ting
<PB N="28" REF="28"/>
all matters right; and I predicted, that when the curtain dropped I should be envious of his receiving all the honours and praises that would, from the part being so applicable to the week, in∣sure good fortune. When Squire Groom made his <HI>entrée</HI> in his new dress and <HI>aw</HI> his potificalibus, exactly as Mr. King had accoutred himself at London when he acted that part; why even there my hopes were frustrated, for his being dressed as a gentleman who had been riding his own match, gave offence instead of being pleasing to the gentlemen of the turf; it was sneered at as impertinently taking too great a liberty in the race week to have any freedom of character, or even to be permitted to pass, at a time when the whole dependence of the theatre rested on the resort of company that attended York races.—Squire Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om's scene was permitted to get through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith difficulty—at the end of which, apparent dis∣gust and we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riness lessened the audience every minute, and then vanished all my pleasing pro∣spect of profit and applause from my fancied trea∣sure in possessing the celebrated farce of Love A-la-Mode; and as the people from all parts hastily retired, we w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re equally quick in bringing about the catastrophe, and were not under much terror or apprehension for the conclusion, as none were left except a few harmless gazers, that nei∣ther
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>
cared for the audience, the farce, nor the actors, but found themselves in the theatre they scarce knew how, and as peaceably departed they hardly knew why. Now let me speak in my own defence as to my merit in acting the part of Sir Archy: First, In the Scotch dialect I was very happy, having naturally a nice ear, and also repeated opportunities of improvement by having resided two winters in Scotland.—In that point I certainly had the advantage even of Mr. Macklin, yet not too Scotch for an English audience (for that may be possible), as an actor may pronounce Scotch too well for a London audience, and yet that would be exactly right at Edinburgh. I could speak Sir Archy without fear at Covent Garden theatre, but would not by any means at∣tempt a Scotch character at Edinburgh, though I have been much honoured by their partiality; but at Newcastle, one hundred miles south of Edinburgh, I was accounted a good actor, as to the dialect, and would have seemed still better at York, and superior to York again if I acted the part in London; as the purity of the language is naturally less understood the more di∣stant from the country, than in or on the borders of Scotland; and the performers in London, not acquainted with Yorkshire, substitute the Wilt∣shire dialect instead of the northern, which is
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
quite opposite: but to the London galleries the substitute answers full as well; as, <HI>ise zure,</HI> &amp;c. fulfils every idea of a Cockney's common com∣prehension. As to my playing the character, I was perfect to a letter, and knew every other part, and had fully comprehended and executed Sir Archy in Mr. Macklin's manner—to do which I was competent: So the fault I may say, as to its being so unfavourably received, did not originate entirely from bad acting; in short, it was no more t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an a chain of ill-luck that at one time or another, in a greater or less degree, pervades nearly all, who in the catalogue of life's calen∣dar pass for men; and I may venture to assert, without offence, that the public every where at times is a ticklish and dangerous dependence, and there is no standing on such reliance with firmness, as the soil is but a sandy foundation at the best.</P>
<P>I have seen Mr. Mossop, when in Dublin, have a crowded house, with his name the only one thought of in the whole play-bill; yet by the pub∣lic being there glutted with too many good per∣formers, and from the frequency of feasting at the temple of Parnassus, they grew surfeited; and after that, Mr. Mossop, aided by Mrs. Fitzhenry, and the well-known and admired Miss Catly, with an additional band, all combined, have performed to 5l.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="31"/>
Before I had acted the farce of Love A-la-Mode at York, I assured myself it would be called for, and draw great houses on the Friday and Sa∣turday following; but the theatrical atmosphere continued dark, gloomy, and tempestuous, and I, after the storm was over, retired to bed, where I sulked most part of the following day.—I begged to be excused from any duty on the Friday: The Maid of the Mill was acted by Mrs. Mahon to a full house; Mr. Robertson performed the Mock Doctor, and I had not seen the audience so truly entertained in the course of the week.</P>
<P>The Saturday we concluded with the Won∣der: Felix, Mr. Frodsham; to which I tacked the Minor, which was well received, and there I got much credit, as well as in the Lyar, that week; and though I loved applause (for who does not), the medicine came too late.—I made my bow, the curtain dropped, and, as I judged, for positively the last time with Tate Wilkinson as a performer on that stage.—But, ah me! our resolutions too much resemble April weather, and are a mere shadowy mixture of sunshine, clouds, and showers, and what we do determine oft we break. <HI>And so and so</HI> (as foolish Becky says) there ended my York race-week 1765, but not without a scourge for my vanity.—I inwardly said (and solemnly) <Q REND="inline">"Farewell, Old York, on
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
thee I turn my back, <HI>there is a world elsewhere.</HI>"</Q> I might truly say I had undergone a severe pe∣nance, although I had not lacked plenty of the good things of this world.</P>
<P>The York company set off on the Monday for Beverley, its usual place of residence at that time, for four or five weeks before the Hull season.—Mr. Baker (as he was fully convinced I had no temptation to allure me again into Yorkshire) behaved most liberally for my trouble during the race-week, and he wished, as I was in the coun∣try, that I would try a short season at Hull, which he augured would answer mutually for our advan∣tage, and be much more profitable than at any other time, if I made a journey on purpose for Hull only.—Mr. Baker's arguments were feasible: Hull was a new spot, and I yielded to the tempta∣tion, and liked it better, as that place had the charms of inticing novelty to allure me.</P>
<P>We will here imagine the York company solacing themselves at pleasant Beverley, and my∣self idle, sulky, and full of chagrin at York, rumi∣nating on the late disappointments, with all my vain glories tarni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hed, and fancied laurels wi∣thered.</P>
<P>Having des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anted so long on theatrical subjects, I apprehend that many persons in Yorkshire, whether the old who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave seen Mr. Fredsham,
<PB N="33" REF="33"/>
or the young who have heard much of that gen∣tleman, will be pleased with a description of him, I have therefore in this niche placed him; and that the almost surfeited reader, after patiently poring over so much playhouse matter, may either sit still and proceed with inspecting this poor monument, or lay down the book and seek a more pleasing or profitable recreation, I shall here give (accord∣ing to my best recollection) a concise sketch of the once much-talked-of, and the now almost for∣gotten Frodsham, who was thirty years ago term∣ed the York Garrick.</P>
<P>The abilities of that performer were unquestion∣able:—He was naturally a good actor in spite of himself; for tho' London improves and matures, and is the most enviable theatrical situation, yet genius will be found in every rank, soil, and sta∣tion. Mr. Frodsham had a quick genius, aided by a liberal education: He was son of an ancient family in Cheshire, of the town of Frodsham, ten miles from Chester, being the half way be∣tween Wigan and Chester:—But his mind, his understanding, and superabundant good qualities, were all warped and undermined by nocturnal ha∣bits; which failings unfortunately were supplied by refreshing pulls at the brandy-bottle in the morning, to take off all qualms from the sto∣mach, till the certain consequence ensued of be∣ing
<PB N="34" REF="34"/>
enfeebled, disordered, mad, dropsical, and dead at the age of thiry-five.—With proper cultiva∣tion he would have been a good substitute for Barry—I do not say that would have done in his latter state, but it would have been the case had he encountered London some years before he fell into such poisonous conduct to himself; and then he was the idol, which the remem∣brance of was the support of his fame on his latter years' performance.—He was awkward merely from the want of modelling, and worse, by being told, from his drunken inferiors, off the stage, that all he did was right: But had he been caught at a proper time, while wild, by such a man as Mr. Garrick, and that Mr. G. would have really taken pains with him, the York hero would have done honour to London. In my experi∣ence and best observation his Hamlet (and Jaffier still better) with all his eccentricity, I never saw equalled but by Mr. Garrick and Mr. Barry at that time; (and of that period I am speaking, not of the present day;) though Mr. Kembel's judgment may challenge what I say; as, be∣sides <HI>his</HI> various excellencies in that character, where the play is performed in the third act, the execution is not only spirited, and possesses great feeling and fire, but the manner of conceiving those passage, and conveying them to the audi∣ence,
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>
is superior by Mr. Kemble to that of any other actor's whatever in my remembrance.—But I am now speaking of an exuberant rude flower of the drama, possessed of voice, with melody and merit, all considered to an eminent degree: He had strong feelings, and tears at will; and had he been a few years under the correction of a Lon∣don audience, and attentive to his good advisers, he would in all probability, long before this, have been in his meridian, and at this time a setting∣sun. There is a coarse picture at York in the print-shops, of which portrait I cannot say the same of more expensive ones; for it not only is very like his person, attitude, &amp;c. but is what a picture of real worth should be—it is a strong conveyance without giving elegance, which he by no means ever attained, though his admirers al∣lowed him certainly what he had not; and the said trifling print does not make him <HI>outré</HI> as to awkwardness, but it just conveys him in Frod∣sham's manner and mode as an actor. One of the strongest likenesses I ever was surprised with was when favoured with a sight of Mr. Garrick's picture, at full length, in the character of Richard the Third, at Sir Watkin William Wynn's, St. James's-Square:—I turned suddenly round, and was actually astonished—for there I saw my old master just as I had seen him in his life-time.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="36"/>
Mr. Powell of London, who the stage had cause to lament, is the nearest assimilation I can give of Frodsham. Mr. Powell had the opportunity of strictly observing real artists, Garrick, and Barry, in all their modes and shapes of grief—Inattentive Frodsham unhappily was his own master, and a careless one; for though he set himself difficult tasks, he only now and then pursued the trump of fame with ardency or alacrity, but lagged, and never reached the goal, though a very little spur∣ring and jockeyship would have made him come in first, and won many a theatrical plate. The public were so infatuated (and indeed he was so superior) that he cast all others at a distance in his York situation; and the audience too blindly and too partially (for his good) approved all he did beyond comparison; and when in full pride, be∣fore he wilfully sunk himself, I do not think any actor but Garrick would have been liked so well; and even Garrick, not without some old maids' opinions at a secret cabal, where Frodsham would have been voted superior, and under the rose ap∣pointed the man for the ladies: Nor would that decision in favour of Frodsham have been from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lderly ladies only, as he had often melted the youthful fair ones of the tenderest moulds, whose he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ts have been susceptible whenever Frodsham was the lover. It was by no means a fortunate
<PB N="37" REF="37"/>
circumstance for that young gentleman to be so much superior to all the rest of the York com∣pany: No actors of high degree were at that time ever known those boards to tread, nor was he ever more than ten days in London. Thus situated at 1l. 1s. per week salary, Frodsham had not any opportunity for observation or improvement:—no infringement was suffered, or change of characters. Nay, so tenacious was old Mr. Crisp<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An old actor at York.</NOTE>, that it was some time, I believe, before he could be pre∣vailed upon to resign Hamlet to Frodsham and act the ghost. Crisp kept Richard, Frodsham acted Richmond—Crisp, Sir John Brute, Frod∣sham merely Colonel Balby. Frodsham, besides his tragic abilities, acted some such parts as Lord Hardy, Young Bevil, Lord Townly, Sir George Airy, sung very tolerably, and was a very decent Macheath. About thirty-two years ago he ob∣tained a fortnight for holidays, which occasioned great lamentations at York, for they were certain if Mr. Garrick saw Frodsham it would be a woe∣ful day for the York stage. He not only was young and vain, but self-opinionated to a super∣abundant degree. When in London he left a card at Mr. Garrick's house, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Frodsham of York,"</Q> with the same ease and facility as if it had
<PB N="38" REF="38"/>
been the first gentleman from Yorkshire. Mr. Garrick judged this card of a <HI>country stroller</HI> very easy and very extraordinary, and from the sample wished to see the York actor, who had according∣ly admittance the ensuing day; and after a slight conversation, during which Garrick was astonished at the young man's being so very free and affable, particularly on any subject pertaining to Shak∣speare's plays, &amp;c. and still with a procrastination that Garrick was not accustomed to, or by any means relished a compliance with, he delayed, every minute expecting that Frodsham would present his petition to be heard, and receive his <HI>commendation</HI> from Garrick's eye of favour: But this obsequious request not being made, Garrick urged present business, and presented the York Romeo with an order for the pit, desiring him that night to favour him with attendance to see him perform Sir John Brute, accompanied with an invitation to breakfast the en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uing morn∣ing—at the same time asking him, <Q REND="inline">"Pray now, have you seen a play since your arrival in Lon∣don?"—"O yes," quickly answered Mr. Frod∣sham, "I saw you play Hamlet two nights ago;" to which he added it was his own favourite cha∣racter.—"Well," s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ys Garrick, "pray now, how did you approve, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I hope I pleased you:"</Q> for that night he had judged his performance a
<PB N="39" REF="39"/>
lucky hit.—Frodsham replied, <Q REND="inline">"O yes, certainly, my dear Sir, vastly clever in several passages; but I cannot so far subjoin mine to the public opinion of London, as to say, I was equally struck with your whole performance in that part."</Q>—I do not conjecture that any actor who spoke to Gar∣rick ever so amazed him.—Garrick stammered and said, <Q REND="inline">"Why—why now, to be sure now, why I suppose you in the country—Pray now, Mr. Frodsham, what sort of a place do you act in at York? Is it in a room, or riding-house, occa∣sionally fitted up?"—"O no, Sir, a theatre upon my honour."—"O sure, why my Lord Burling∣ton has said that; why will—will you breakfast to-morrow, and we will have a trial of skill, and Mrs. Garrick shall judge between us, ha, ha, ha, now, I say.—Good day, Mr. York, for I must be at the theatre, so now pray remember breakfast."</Q> Frodsham promised he would, and made his exit. And though Garrick himself told me the circum∣stance, and truly laughed then, yet I am certain at the time he had been greatly piqued, astonish∣ed, and surprised at so strange a visit from a coun∣try ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or; yet wishing to satisfy his curiosity, had done it for once at the expence of his pride and dignity. The following day arrived the York hero at <HI>Palais Royale</HI> in Southampton-street, accord∣ing to appointment—breakfast finished with Ma∣dam
<PB N="40" REF="40"/>
Garrick as good superintendant, waiting with impatience, and full of various conjectures why the <HI>poor</HI> man from the country did not take courage and prostrate before the foot of majesty, humbly requesting a trial, engagement, &amp;c.; but as Frodsham did not, as expected, break the ice, Garrick did.—<Q REND="inline">"Well, Mr. Frodsham, why now, well, that is, I suppose you saw my Brute last night?—Now no compliment, but tell Mrs. Gar∣rick; well now, was it right?—Do you think it would have pleased at York? Now speak what you think!"—"O!" says Frodsham, "certain∣ly, certainly; and, upon my honour, without com∣pliment, I never was so highly delighted and en∣tertained—it was beyond my comprehension: But having seen you play Hamlet first, your Sir John Brute exceeded my belief; for I have been told, Hamlet, Mr. Garrick, is one of your first characters; but I must say, I flatter myself I play it almost as well; for comedy, my good Sir, is your <HI>forte.</HI>—But your Brute, d—n it, Mr. Gar∣rick, your Brute was excellence itself! You stood on the stage in the drunken scene flourishing your sword; you placed yourself in an attitude—I am sure you saw me in the pit at the same time, and with your eyes you seemed to say, "Damn it, Frodsham, did you ever see any thing like that at York? Could you do that, Frodsham?"</Q> (and it
<PB N="41" REF="41"/>
is possible that last remark was a just one.) The latter part of this harangue of Frodsham's possibly went not so glibly down as the tea at breakfast; and the ease and familiarity with which it was ac∣companied and delivered, not only surprised, but mortified Garrick, who expected adulation and the bended knee— <Q><L>Where thrift might follow fawning.</L></Q>
Mr. Garrick not only loved, but eagerly swallowed flattery with a conjurer's avidity, with, hey! pass and be gone; and had it daily served up not only by inferiors, equals, and dependents, but by per∣sons of higher rank: Therefore to hear a country actor speak slightly <Q REND="inline">"touching his Lord Hamlet,"</Q> was too much to bear, and, as Sir Archy says, <Q REND="inline">"was vary new."</Q> After much affectation of laughter, and seemingly approving all Frodsham had uttered—<Q REND="inline">"Well now, hey! for a taste of your quality—now a speech, Mr. Frodsham, from Hamlet; and, Mrs. Garrick, "bear a wary eye."</Q> Frodsham, with the utmost composure, spoke Hamlet's first soliloquy without any idea of fear or terror, or indeed allowing Garrick, as a trage∣dian, a better Hamlet, or superior to himself, Gar∣rick all the while darting his fiery eyes into the soul of Frodsham, a custom of Garrick's to all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hom he deemed subservient, as if he meant to
<PB N="42" REF="42"/>
alarm and convey from those eyes an idea of in∣telligence to the beholder of his own amazing in∣tellects. Garrick certainly possessed most extra∣ordinary powers of eye, as they contained not only the fire and austerity he meant to convey, but his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mplicity in Scrub, and archness of eye in Don John, was equally excellent and as various:—On Frodsham, the eye of terror had no such effect; for if he had noticed and thought Mr. Garrick's eyes were penetrating, he would inwardly have comforted himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his own were equally brilliant, if not superiorly so. When Frodsham had finish∣ed Hamlet's first speech, and without stop, <HI>To be or not to be,</HI> &amp;c. Garrick said, <Q REND="inline">"Well, hey now! hey! you have a smattering, but you want a little of my forming; and really in some passages you have acquired tones I do not by any means ap∣prove." Frodsham tartly replied, "Tones, Mr. Garrick! to be sure I have tones, but you are not familiarized to them. I have seen you act twice, Hamlet the first, and I thought you had odd tones, and Mrs. Cibber strange tones, and they were not quite agreeable to me on the first hearing, but I dare say I should soon be reconciled to them."—"Why now," says the much astonished wonder∣ing Garrick, "nay, now that is—why now really Frodsham, you are a d—d queer fellow—but for a fair and full trial of your genius my stage
<PB N="43" REF="43"/>
shall be open, and you shall act any part you please, and if you succeed we will then talk of terms." "O!" says Frodsham, in the same flighty flow of spirits, "you are mistaken, my dear Mr. Gar∣rick, if you think I came here to solicit an en∣gagement; I am a Roscius at my own quarters! I came to London purposely to see a few plays, and looking on myself as a man not destitute of ta∣lents, I judged it a proper compliment to wait on a brother genius: I thought it indispensable to see you, and have half an hour's conversation with you—I neither want nor wish for an engagement; for I would not abandon or relinquish the happi∣ness I enjoy in Yorkshire for the first terms your great and grand city of London could afford;"</Q> and with a negligent wild bow made his exit, and left the gazing Garrick following his shade, like Shakspeare's ghost, himself standing in an attitude of surprise, to ruminate and reflect, and to relate this account of the strangest mad actor he had ever seen, or ever after did see. Mr. Garrick told me these particulars himself, and a narrative much of the same purpose I had from Mr. Frod∣sham when I became acquainted with him in Yorkshire. Mr. Garrick declared he never be∣held such a strange mixture of merit and genius, as in that <HI>eccentric</HI> Frodsham; and Frodsham, without any idea of offence, weakly judged that
<PB N="44" REF="44"/>
his fame was equally known with the other great man's; and he was determined such an establish∣ed actor as the York idol should not be deemed rude by being in London and not visiting his bro∣ther Hamlet's altar. Frodsham's remarks were rude, and not true, relative to tones; for Mr. Gar∣rick spoke Hamlet as naturally and void of particu∣lar tones as ever was heard, his voice being remark∣ably harmonious, strong, and pleasing, though in his hesitation and repetition, off the stage, he threw it into an affected manner, which habit had form∣ed into nature. As to Mrs. Cibber's Ophelia, though I have seen many good ones I have not seen her like, nor ever expect it, as her singing, voice, figure, and features, all combined, will ne∣ver let me bury in oblivion her remembrance.—<Q><L>They all wither'd when my poor father died.</L>
<L>Methinks I see her now!</L>
<L>Where?</L>
<L>In my mind's eye, Horatio.</L></Q> But tones, until familiarized, may prevent favou∣rite comedians, till their merit is established, from having their voice relished and approved. When I first heard Mr. Quick his voice did not much please me: Now I never hear the sound of it, even from behind the scenes, but I am as eager as any other attendant involuntarily to laugh, it
<PB N="45" REF="45"/>
has to me so whimsical and very agreeable an ef∣fect. With the tragedian this apparent difficulty is n t so easily got over: Ryan's voice was bad to a degree, so was Mrs. Woffington's: Ryan, by having merit and worth, was sanctioned; and Mrs. Woffington, by the aid of beauty and merit, was a great favourite in Jane Shore, Lady Jane Gray, &amp;c. &amp;c.; but these are wonderful hazards to encounter.</P>
<P>Before I quit Mr. Frodsham's mode of be∣haviour at London, I must inform the reader, that the said harum-scarum young gentleman, un∣less he waited on Johnny Rich of Covent Garden theatre, that manager he feared would arraign him of being deficient in point of good-breeding, o∣therwise he had not the least inclination to bestow an hour on that gentleman; as he had been in∣formed Mr. Rich's genius was superficial, and supposing he neither understood plays, Greek, nor Latin, but encouraged pantomime only, he held him in the greatest contempt.—Indeed the applause at York he commanded, and received from every alehouse, had intoxicated his brain as much as the plentiful potations of <HI>York burgun∣dy,</HI> with which, and other pleasant spirited draughts, he too soon finished his early days of life and fame: He had by the lower people been so loaded with more fancied honours than he could carry, that he had not a serious after-reflection or
<PB N="46" REF="46"/>
thought to inform him he had acted wrong in his deportment, manners, and behaviour to Mr. Gar∣rick: He knew Garrick's great fortune, and his own <HI>no fortune at all,</HI> but allowed no professional superiority in talents, &amp;c.; and when he spoke to Mr. Garrick, he said, he of course supposed that Mr. Garrick knew he was speaking to as good a gentleman as himself, and an actor on much the same footing of merit: For the bravos and encou∣ragement he received in his best days at York were certainly flattering; and from those causes, combined with his own self-opinion, had con∣firmed to him that he was secure of the highest opinion from all the nobility of England, because a few saw him in a York race-week. With Rich he met with a very different reception from that of the Drury Lane patentee: He found him teach∣ing a young lady to act, with three or four cats about him. After his being some time in the room, when announced, Rich viewed him through a very large reading-glass, took his snuff, and said, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Mr. Frogsmire, I suppose you are come from York to be taught, and that I should give you an engagement: Did you ever act Richard, Mr. Frogsmire?"—"Yes, Sir."—"Why then you shall hear me act,"</Q> says Rich:—when he spoke a speech in a most ridiculous manner: And on its being concluded, Frodsham pettishly told him he
<PB N="47" REF="47"/>
did not visit him nor come from York to be taught nor to hear him act; he came (like Lord Chalkstone) merely for a little conversation, and to view his Elysian fields. But as Mr. Rich loved leisure, and had little curiosity, he replied, that un∣less <HI>Muster</HI> Frogsmire would with humble atten∣tion hear his Richard, he would not hear Mr. Frogsmire at all. Frodsham was preparing to make an exit, while Rich was ruminating and proceeding with— <Q><L>'Twas an excuse to avoid me!</L>
<L>Alas she keeps no bed!</L></Q>
When he was suddenly interrupted by Mr. Frod∣sham with, <Q REND="inline">"I wish you good morning!"</Q> and so ended unthinking Frodsham's second managerial visit.—He returned to Ebor's plains, and was joyfully received there.—He was not forgot by Garrick, as he often, to his performers, related the story of that <HI>mad York actor,</HI> as he termed him: And Rich, without thinking of any such trifling occurrence, continued teaching young pupils to act, stroked his cats, and the York Roscius was never more by him remembered.</P>
<P>The last night Frodsham, ever spoke on the stage was in October 1768. After playing Lord Townly, and though in apparent great spirits, he died with∣in three days after.—<Q REND="inline">"Ladies and gentlemen,

<P>I will here take it for granted, that the reader has ruminated on giddy Frodsham's exit from the world's stage, and once more resume my discourse to inform the peruser, that during my few days retire∣ment at Mr. Baker's, after the races, I received the fa∣vour of an invitation from Mr. Whitely, director of the Doncaster theatre, requesting I would per∣form a few nights there after the races, as him∣self and troop were to attend that meeting, and continue some weeks afterwards. The offer exactly tallied with my plan for convenience, as it filled up the space until I should be wanted at Hull, and also would add grist to my mill. I conti∣nued with good Mr. Baker at my house (or rather his) at York, till I went to Doncaster, and he stayed with me till then, out of compliment, for he usually was with the company. I went, and Mr. Whitely gave bills with a long puff of <Q REND="inline">"Walk in and see the wonderful great actor he had engaged
<PB N="49" REF="49"/>
from London, Dublin, Edinburgh, &amp;c."</Q> I acted there three weeks. Miss Whitely was the young heroine, a very pretty and handsome young lady; she promised well as an actress, but thank her stars she is much better provided for than being obliged to rely on the stage. She married Mr. Goslin of Stamford, where she is happily situated, and is just as irresistible a woman now as she was a girl then. During my continuance at Donca∣ster I lived entirely with Mr. Stanuel, who at that time kept the Green Dragon, and to whose civi∣lities I was greatly indebted and have never for∣got; and I am glad of this public opportunity to ac∣knowledge them, and present my thanks to him. Mr. Stanuel now moves on a larger scale, and in a more exalted sphere, as he is master of an ele∣gant and much improved inn, well known (and genteelly supported) under the name of the Red Lion.</P>
<P>My benefit play there was the Merchant of Ve∣nice; my Tea, and Duke and no Duke. It was particularly honoured, with not only being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry full, but all the genteel families came on that occa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on to our little theatre; and no wonder, for besides the compliment paid to me, Sir George Cooke's mother (who was much beloved by all the families in Doncaster and its neighbourhood) did me the honour unasked to patronize my play. Sir George Cooke lives at Wheatly, near Donca∣ster:

<P>I returned back to York, and then posted next day for Beverley, where my friend Mr. Baker waited for me, and after that ceremony escorted me to Hull, which was early in the month of No∣vember, 1765.—My first appearance was in King Lear. I had every reason to be pleased, not only from the attention and warm applause of the au∣dience, but from the civilities paid me by several of the leading inhabitants. I studied Zanga; which character was not only there, but after that at <HI>York,</HI> generally looked on as my master piece in trage∣dy; and notwithstanding the variety of principal performers, it is equally spoken of, and flatter∣ingly allowed to be, more than a performance of mediocrity at this day.</P>
<P>As I have mentioned civilities at that time with which I was favoured at Hull, Mr. Melling I am sure will pardon the liberty I presume on, when I beg leave to mention his name with that respect, esteem, and gratitude, which from me, and every one who knows him, is truly his due. He is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gentleman whom all must revere, and the com∣mon enemy of man cannot be so devilish as to hate, though he cannot but envy.

relate; (tho' not strictly according with the time of what occurred near the period I am recording of Hull, as my misfortune happened in 1771, when all my theatres were greatly supported.)—At that time my lease at Beverley was nearly expired:—I was up to the ears in building a new theatre at Leeds, and in the interim, for experiment, tried Beverley and Hull races while the Leeds mansion was finishing; when, to my astonish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, and every person's equal surprise, I was ordered by Colonel Appleton, then mayor, (notwithstanding strong application from ladies, and the officers of the East Riding militia then assembled) to march bag and baggage out of the town—an insult and disgrace, I believe, never offered to any regular company in this world, and in a place where certainly so well established, and good a company of comedians was a feather of honour rather than the contrary; as from its situation they never can have a company of fixed or superior estimation.—However, my royalty of patents, with York in one hand, and that of Hull in the other, could not melt nor soften an obdurate rock, or prevail with that upright judge to deviate so far as to wink at a breach of law by suffering a naughty play at Beverley, tho' he had evidently gone nine miles from Beverley to Hull for the purpose of seeing one, at which time Hull was not a patent theatre.—But as lawless as

its neighbour, where he exercised his supreme autho∣rity; the result w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, maintained the company for three weeks without their being permitted to act in my own theatre, which of course amounted to a considerable sum. Why a gentleman, whom I never to my knowledge offended, but held in re∣spectful esteem, sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld have used me thus op∣pressively, and trampled on a sufferer, as it ex∣acted from me an enormous expence, bordering on <HI>one hundred pounds,</HI> (perhaps, indeed, had I urged that sensitive point, <HI>my money,</HI> some feel∣ing might have found passage for the strolling plaintiff,) has been from that time to this inexplicable, unless the following circumstance was his grand motive and reason for such ungen∣tleman-like, and, indeed, such cruel behaviour, which surely can only be accounted for as owing to that strange turn, too often seen, felt, and ex∣perienced, from a desp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tic and proud disposition.</P>
<P>Two years before, the said Colonel had desired to have a row in a stage box for my benefit at Hull—the places were set down, but the Colonel had not, as was, and is the usage, sent a ser∣vant to secure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem; and it was, and is also, the custom, that at the end of the first act of a play none <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an be kept for any rank or degree whatever.

and though the ladies and gentlemen in the boxes offered to make him every convenience he would not accept it, but was highly enraged and offend∣ed at what in fact was entirely his own fault:—He declared he would not continue a minute longer in the theatre, and departed instantly, swelling with dignity almost even to the bursting, and vow∣ing vengeance on the Wilkinson—the which he put in execution in the manner I have related—and it has often brought good Shakspeare's lines as applicable to that powerful magistrate—<Q><L>—Oh!

After my safe escape from Colonel Appleton's magisterial authority, with my baggage-waggons, &amp;c. to Hull races, without capture, where I was received with welcome, I have looked upon it as a duty for the Beverley residents to be here made acquainted with the true motives which compelled me to abandon that spot; as I have for several years been much indebted to the inhabitants of that town, of every degree, for their frequent vi∣sitations to the Hull theatre, particularly on my own benefit night; for let the weather prove ever so discouraging, there always has been several per∣sons of every description on that occasion.</P>
<P>My benefit at Hull on my <HI>first visit</HI> in Decem∣ber 1765 was flattering to a degree; not a place in the boxes to be purchased but with as much difficulty as if Mr. Garrick was to have acted; so I may vaunt of <Q REND="inline">"O the days when I was young."</Q> My play was The Orphan of China, which had never been acted there: My dish of Tea, at which there were no qualms, misconceptions, or abuse—all went down glibly—The farce was Love A-la-Mode—But the difference of representation, and the opinion of the Hull audience, was so indulgent <HI>that night,</HI> as made me feel overpaid for the vex∣ations and mishaps that attended my performing Sir Archy at York. I made my best bow, my best speech, and from the front of the house to
<PB N="57" REF="57"/>
the performers behind the curtain, there was an instance of mutual harmony; and not one amongst them was more pleased than my good ge∣nius Mr. Baker, with whom I went accidentally to York, meaning to pass one week, and bid, in all probability, that place an eternal adieu as an actor.</P>
<P>I had engaged on my own terms with Mr. Ivory, the proprietor, for the whole season at Norwich, till the benefits commenced at that town. My quarters were secured in the London coach, my baggage all packed, and I was near the eve of my departure from York city that January 1766, being the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st place of wishing to stay at, or even to deign visiting in future. On the Thursday se∣veral gentlemen waited on Mr. Baker, hearing I was in York, and informed him that many ladies and gentlemen would esteem themselves much in∣debted to Mr. Wilkinson's politeness if he would assist the charity for the boys and girls, play on the following Saturday, and favour them so far on that night as to oblige them with the farce of Love A-la-Mode, and perform Mr. Macklin's character of Sir Archy Mac Sarcasm.—Reader, are you not thunder-struck!—but rest satisfied it is no more strange than true. Mr. Baker referred the gentlemen to me, very properly observing he had no right to make any request of the kind—the which ceremony they paid me. I was then
<PB N="58" REF="58"/>
traversing the stage as a noon walk—there they repeated their pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ition. In answer I urged the in∣convenience, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y journey, &amp;c. would not permit, my time for being at Norwich being fix∣ed; and in particu ar mentioned, had that not been so urgent, I had a particular aversion ever to think o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> acting in Love A-la-Mode in future at York, as the treatment I had sustained, during the representation of that excellent farce in the last race-week, was such as would deter me from atte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pting Sir Archy on that stage again, and from that per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance begged to be excused; but added, if my acting any other part either in play or farce, or both, could p ssibly contribute to their entertain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent and assist the charity, my services, such as they were, the public might freely com∣mand. Mr. Tasker of York was with the gen∣tlemen, and he immediately replied, that several leading families were then at York for the winter season who were not there in the race-week; and those persons who were so anxious to have Love A-la-Mode had seen it often acted in London; that it could not be denied but a strange miscon∣ception had prevailed the night it had been pre∣sented in the race-week; but the ladies, one and all, who had been at the last concert night, assured Mr. Wilkinson they should be highly entertained if he would treat them with Love A-la-Mode.

began to relax in my sulkiness, and with a little more persuasion, added to my own good opinion of the piece, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to regain my honour in Sir Archy, complied with their solicit tions, but told them I expected applause, not insult, which was readily promis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; it was a debt of honour, and was just∣ly paid, as they kept their words even to over-ba∣lance with added interest; for the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arce was a continued roar of approbation and laughter.—O reader! how is this jumble of events to be ac∣counted fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? as Hamlet says, <Q REND="inline">"There is some∣thing in this more than natural, if Philosophy coul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> find it out."</Q>—And what is more worthy observation, that very farce of Love A-la-Mode, which had four months before grieved my heart in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugust, should in cold January not only render ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpensation with excess <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f warm joy, but was actually the sole cause of rendering York ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y years my agreeable place of residence, with a cheerful happy home, as the circumstance evidences, from J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nuary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>766 to this dav June 4, 1790, his Majesty's birth-day.—God bless the King, send him a long and prosperous reign—and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I live with health and happiness to repeat my yearly petition.</P>

<P>The leading persons were so pleased with their entertainment and my acquiescence, that they called a consultation the day following the charity∣play; at which meeting they mentioned, that the York theatre was in a very declining state, even to the disgrace of the city:—dirty scenes, dirty clothes, all dark and dismal.—As to the scenes being so tattered it must be granted as inexcu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able, as Mr. Baker was a painte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of eminence; his knowledge and taste in drawing will ever speak for him while one of his remaining prints of York or Lincoln minster is to be seen:—But in defence of laziness I must mention his advanced age, with two bad servants attending him as natural enemies—the gout and the rheumatism. The gentlemen urged to Mr. Tasker, that as Mr. Wilkinson was universally acquainted with theatrical matters, and having been in London, here, there, and every where, it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld be greatly for the advantage of Mr. Baker, and also for the public, if he would make Mr. Wilkinson such an offer as might render it worth his while, on reflection, to tempt him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix his residence at York; as Mr. Wilkinson cer∣tainlv must b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that time have satisfied himself with a life of rambling (But in that point they were mistaken.) Mr. Tasker was desired to consider
<PB N="61" REF="61"/>
that proposal, and wait on Mr. Baker with what they partially termed—<HI>the general opinion of the town.</HI> Mr. Tasker lost no time, (as he loved bu∣siness) but instantly waited on Mr. Baker, and in∣formed him of the particulars of those gentlemen's opinions: Mr. Baker, though really attached to me, yet hesitated on that sudden intelligence, as it seemed to threaten a blow on his own conse∣quence, arbitrary sway, and love of power, which few have philosophy sufficient to adopt and ap∣prove: He told Mr. Tasker, that his friend Tate got a great deal of money at various places, and that York theatre could not, by any means, afford to pay Mr. Wilkinson such a sufficient compensa∣tion as would induce him to give up his yearly excursions, and be plagued with the never-ceasing troubles that daily attend the attempt of guiding a company of comedians, whose various tempers, van<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ties, and self expectations, were to the full as difficu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to satisfy as the public; and concluded wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> flatly pronouncing that the matter was impracticable.—Mr. Tasker an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wered him, that it was not impra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icable—it might be easily ac∣complished;—and without some essential assistance at this juncture to the theatre, he told Mr. Baker he must be ruined; and Providence had thrown Mr. Wilkinson there at that time, perhaps for the preservation of both:—He persisted with hintin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="62" REF="62"/>
to Mr. Baker, that by having built a new theatre at York from his own pocket, he had run into a debt that would involve him much; <Q REND="inline">"and you say," added Mr. Tasker, "that you esteem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ate Wilkinson as your son, why then, in God's name, make him your adopted heir, and act as his fa∣ther:—you have neither children nor relations, make Wilkinson survivor to all your theatrical property—let your dwelling-house be his home—give his benefits at York, Hull, and Newcastle, clear from all charges—appoint him a competent sa∣lary—and as Mr. Wilkinson has accumulated some few hundreds, borrow such sums on bond—allow him interest for his money, and your property be∣ing assigned to him will be more than a sufficient secur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty."</Q>—The money (which Baker wanted) had with him the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atest weight in the argument, as it generally has with all the human race. He told Mr. Tasker that he had a sincere regard for the young gentleman; and af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er a short silence, and sighing woefully, he said, if Mr. Tasker would make such a proposal to Mr. Wilkinson, he would agree to it, and hoped it would be for the com∣fort and happiness of both, declaring, had he pos∣sessed a fortune, he could not have bequeathed it to any one with more satisfaction than to his adopted Tate; for he had proved himself a good son, and he had for that worthy point of character

looked on himself as Mr. Wilkinson's parental guardian from the time of his mother's death.—The dialogue thus finished, Mr. Tasker called on me to walk half an hour in the Minster, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd soon broached, related, and explained all the particu∣lars just now inserted.

<P>AS in my elbow (though not always my easy) chair, I love to prattle and tell old tales, and re∣member with advantage what feats were done, I must here entreat the patience a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d attention of such young persons who fix their present thoughts on stage pageantry, and their views on future greatness, wherein they image to their pleasing warm ideas how far they shall surpass those whom they now look up to and admire; for there are many actors and actresses of the present age, not yet arrived at mediocrity as professors, yet are advanced in years, and far on their journey to the world's end, who boldly affirm, that were the ac∣tors of the old school now in being, they would not please if they were to dress their characters as they did forty or sixty years ago. There, cer∣tainly,
<PB N="78" REF="77"/>
the present actors' observations would be right, but in point of sterling acting surely in an error.</P>
<P>That there are gentlemen and ladies of infinite merit in most stage departments I rejoice at, as their emolument is a reward to their merits, as well as for the honour and credit of the pro∣fession.</P>
<P>As to dress I draw this conclusion, that was Mr. Garrick existing, with the vigour and appearance of thirty, yet, if he was to act Ranger now, he cer∣tainly would not dress that agreeable rake as he did forty-three years before this time, but as Mr. Lewis, or any other competent judge does dress that character. And as to the acting, I must persist, (and there are thousands living to back my assertion) that Mr. Garrick would have been a natural performer one hundred years ago▪ he was the most shining, general player I have yet seen; and were he to act Ranger an hundred years hence he would be a natural Ranger then▪ and for a very simple rule: (Mr. Macklin was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the old, and is now of the new school, yet I ne∣ver heard of his deviating from Nature as an in∣structor or an actor)—for Nature ever will be Na¦ture.—Mr. King's and Mr. Yates's excellencies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the old school prove this.—Shakspeare wrote two
<PB N="79" REF="78"/>
hundred years ago, and could he write in the pre∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt aera, he could not make the characters better in boldness or expression of language than those he wrote before.—I do not impertinently, or like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n old stager say,—Could Mr. Quin and Mr. Ryan act now, they would give the same satisfac∣tion as they did then.—The reason is evident, though they pleased the audiences of that age, yet the mode and manner not being natural in many characters, the present good discriminating taste that pervades would not relish or suffer it. Mr. Quin's tragedy was strutting, pompous, languid, tiresome, and wanted spirit. But the same idea of one hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dred years given just now as a supposition for Mr. Garrick's Ranger, would have an equal claim at present with Mr. Quin's Falstaff; for he was much the best any living person has seen, as he had every requisite from Nature: And though Henderson had great merit, his Falstaff was much inferior, as all he did was the effect of study and art, having neither the person, the voice, nor the eye, in particular, for that part;—in each of these material points Henderson was deficient. Now Quin, with a bottle of claret and a full house, the instant he was on the stage was Sir John Falstaff himself.—<Q><PB N="80" REF="79"/>
<L>As the well-teaming earth,</L>
<L>With rivers and show'rs,</L>

<L>So Faistaff will never decline;</L>
<L>Still fruitful and gay,</L>
<L>He moistens his clay,</L>
<L>And his rain and his rivers are wine.</L>
<L>Of the world he has all but its care;</L>
<L>No load, but of flesh, will he bear;</L>
<L>He laughs off his pack,</L>
<L>Takes a cup of old sack,</L>
<L>And away with all sorrow and care.</L></Q></P>
<P>Quin's Harry the Eighth, Sir John Brute, all the Falstaffs, Old Bachelor, Volpone, Ape mantus, Brutus, Ventidius, Bishop Gardiner, Clause, Glo∣ster, were all, with several others, all his own; nor have those characters already mentioned ever truly flourished as when inspired by him. But out of his particular walk he was ever bordering on the ridiculous:—His Richard was very heavy, labo∣rious, and unnatural, and it was <HI>then</HI> thought so; as I recollect reading a list of plays in a magazine for the year 1750, where, in the catalogue of tra∣gedies and comedies there inserted, was the fol∣lowing line:—<Q><L>King RICHARD, by Quin. <HI>Much hissed.</HI></L></Q> His Othello, Macbeth, Lear, &amp;c. all as bad: He
<PB N="81" REF="80"/>
played Chamont.—What would our modern beaux think of young Chamont, as I have seen Mr. Quin act it at the age of sixty? He was equipped in a long, grisly, half-powdered p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>iwig, hanging low down on each side the breast and down the back, a heavy scarlet coat and waistcoat trimmed with broad gold lace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k velvet breeches, a black silk neckcloth, black s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ockings, a pair of square-toed shoes, with an old-fashioned pair of stone buckles;—and the youthful, the fiery Chamont adorned himself with a pair of stiff high-top'd white gloves, with a broad ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> scollop'd laced hat, which when taken off the head, and having pressed the old wig, and vie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng his fair round belly with fat capon lined, he lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked like Sir John Brute in the drunken scene.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick brought to the world's light the spirited Chamont; old Ryan was the strong and lusty Polydore, with a red face, and voice truly horrible, which, like Portia, you might quickly have distinguished, <Q REND="inline">"He knows me, as the bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd man does the cuckoo, by my bad voice."</Q>—Ryan also added bad deportment, and was not near so well dressed as Quin's Chamont, though in much the same extraordinary manner; and by them stood Mr. Barry in Castalio, in a neat bag wig, then of the newest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ashion, in his bloom and prime of li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; and was cer∣tainly

one of the handsomest men ever seen on or off the stage, with Mrs. Cibber, all-elegance and neatness by his side as Monimia. The sight of the two ancient heroes of antiquity made such a contrast in the Quartetto, that it struck even my features at the age of eleven with risibility. If so, what a whimsical feeling of tragi-comedy must it have diffused on the muscles of the pit critics, who then decided all disputes, damnations, &amp;c. which at present, to save the audience trou∣ble, the morning papers have taken most of the grand articles of setting up or knocking down into their own custody.</P>
<P>It is incumbent to remember, though Ryan's figure for Phocyas, Frankley, Sir George Airy, &amp;c. would now appear extravagantly ridiculous, yet on the London boards no actor for a course of years could have stood more esteemed and re∣spectable; and be it observed, that in despite of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l these deficiencies of voice, manner, person, dress, years, &amp;c. his Edgar, mad scene of Orestes, fourth-act scene of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cduff, Ford, Dumont in Jane Shore, nay even Lord Townly, (though very likely p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rformed the same week by Mr. Bar∣ry, who was in every point most excellent in that character) yet he never repeated the last scene of that part, or the mad scenes of Edgar, without evincing such a strong sense and feeling, accom∣panied
<PB N="83" REF="82"/>
with judgment, as removed for the time all sight or sense of his defects and oddities. Mr. Woodward assured me, that when Mr. Garrick went with him to see Ryan's Richard the Third, meaning to be inwardly merry, that Garrick, on the contrary, was astonished at what he saw work∣ing in the mind of the ungraceful, slovenly, and ill-dressed figure, which told him more than he before knew, and which caused Garrick's bring∣ing to light that unknown excellence as his own, which in Ryan had remained unnoticed and bu∣ried.</P>
<P>There are confessedly more than five to one actors of merit now to what there were in 1747; for their Cloughs, Vaughans, Dagger Mars, Mo∣ze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, Ackmans, Andersons, Pagets, Oats's, Red∣mans, Wignals, &amp;c. &amp;c. would not now (were they living) be permitted to act at the York or Hull theatres, so nice are they grown, and there is such decent acting in general throughout the kingdom: Yet we must not suppose Mr. Cibber did not understand polite life and good breeding when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e wrote the characters of Lord and Lady Townly; they were judged so then, and are so still—and prove that the author knew full as well what a lady of quality should be as the modern writers do. Indeed our fine ladies at present on the stage are tri∣fling
<PB N="84" REF="83"/>
when compared with Lady Townly, Lady Betty Modish, Millamant, Maria (now Charlotte in the Hypocrite), and several others. As a proof, those old written characters are what every young female fashionable candidate wishes to play; ask Mrs. Abington and Miss Farren what characters they choose to give the first impression in? they will quickly answer, Charlotte in the Hypocrite, Shakspeare's Beatrice, Lady Betty, &amp;c.—Now if Cibber wrote his ladies characters and his fops well, he at that time knew how to play them; but that was, according to the particular mode of his own, which pleased: But his manner would not please <HI>now</HI> I guess, because that of another age: His Foppington was a coxcomb of that time, and Sir Fopling Flutter, with Sir Courtley Nice:—Now there are no such characters extant, and therefore Lord Foppington is not so pleasing a re∣presentative of quality as he was forty years ago: And I not only think, but venture to affirm, a∣gainst many judgments of stage opinions of a mo∣dern green-room, that the celebrated Mrs. Old∣field's Lady Townly, &amp;c. would be now pronounced excellent. My imagination leads me to pin faith on this opinion, because my brethren will remark her tragedy did not suit with the bombastic taste of those actors who devoted themselves at the tragic shrine; and the true cause has been, that
<PB N="85" REF="84"/>
she was more natural than her predecessors, and her conversation and manners were universally ad∣mired as a lady, which must have been the result of observation, and her being admitted on a familiar and respectable footing with persons of the first distinction, who admired the elegance of the ac∣tress, and saw themselves in her:—And persons of true taste and distinction, however the dress of the times may differ, will ever be easy, affable, attrac∣tive, and engaging.—Nay, it can be easily ex∣plained to young observers, almost to a certainty; for look back a very few years, and they will find once a year that the <HI>ton</HI> for being seen in public, in the month of January, was naked and bare; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd another year the neck and bosom all muffled and barricaded, in July and August: Yet to a Duchess of Devonshire or Rutland, both natives and foreigners bow with admiration, in the same manner, whether the behind is swelled or dimi∣nished; as whatever they do, ease and elegance must be attendants: therefore the habiliment to such persons matters very little to a critical obser∣ver, whether they are seen decked simply in an Irish poplin, or accoutred in all the gaudy plumes of the most extravagant chan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of prevailing Paris fashions: And if Mrs. Oldfield's dress for Lady Townly, or Lady Betty, with Mrs. Abington's or any other fine lady's dress, were now put
<PB N="86" REF="85"/>
into a fire, the latter would be consumed to ashes that might help a hot-house, but I fear not pro∣duce intrinsic worth—but the Oldfield's would prove
<Q><L>Like purest gold that's tortur'd in the furnance,</L>
<L>Comes out more bright, and brings forth all its weight.</L></Q></P>
<P>The expence for the necessary profusion of stage-dresses is enormous, but there is nothing real: Taste may be discerned. That this is the period for taste in dress will be readily admit∣ted; but the money expended, and all the true value, rests in the word <HI>taste.</HI> I know this my∣self perfectly, by having had, about twenty years ago, an old wardrobe I found in the ruins of my theatrical Herculaneum, and which was of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> antiquity, and had appertained to Roman emperors, kings, &amp;c. when not a performer, lady or gentle∣man of the London theatres, but would have invol∣untarily laughed at the old broad seams of gold and silver lace, and have cast piteous and contemptu∣ous looks on the country performers thus loaded with trumpery: Yet those despicable clothes had, at different periods of time, bedecked real lords and dukes, and were bought at much less price than now; and would produce, by one day's labour of stripping merely the old materials, forty or fifty pounds to provide a supper if the stomach required. And I can assert and prove, that my present ward∣robe
<PB N="87" REF="86"/>
is far superior to any out of London, with∣out excepting Dublin or Edinburgh, and has been attended with considerable expence, far beyond the bounds of prudence or common-sense. It is true, as a purchaser of the theatre, the wardrobe is of great cost and value, and would shew a play without fear or disgrace to any audience whatever, as numbers can testify; but would not, in a state of bankruptcy, pay INTRINSICALLY, as the old despised King Lear's suit almost singly would have done; as all now consists of foil, spangles, beads, interwoven fast embroidery, silks, satins, &amp;c. which soon wear: An old petticoat, made for a large hoop of the Duchess of Northumberland, thirty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears ago, would have served a queen in the theatre <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>everal years, then descended to a duchess of Suffolk, afterwards made two handsome tragedy shapes for an old rich Spaniard, and ten years after that burn and produce money to purchase thirty yards of lustring for a modern stage lady. Thirty years ago not a Templar, or decent-dressed young man, but wore a rich gold laced hat, and scar∣let waistcoat with a broad gold lace;—as the miser says, <Q REND="inline">"he carried an estate upon his back;"</Q>—also laced frocks for morning dress. I have now worn, occasionally, by comedians (for old characters of wealth) a suit of purple <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth, with gold vellum holes, that I frequent∣ly
<PB N="88" REF="87"/>
wore when a young man as a fashionable dress, and spoke the prologue to the Author, gave Tea, &amp;c. on the London stage, and after that used it as my common dress to parade the streets at noon: But I must justly coincide with the point of truth, and declare, the characteristic dressing of plays forty years ago was very inferior indeed to what is seen in these riper years, particularly the come∣dians. At that time, no more than two or three principal characters, (at Covent Garden in parti∣cular) were well dressed, and those not with any va∣riety as now. Mrs. Woffington's wardrobe had only the increase of one tragedy-suit, in the course of the season, in addition to the clothes allotted to her, unless she indulged herself; and she had a new suit for Sir Harry Wildair, in which charac∣ter Mrs. Woffington looked the man of fashion; and Mrs. Jordan sports now in Sir Harry one of the best legs in the kingdom. Sir Joshua Rey∣nolds is a judge of legs, and has, like Paris with his apple, given his decree on that said leg.</P>
<P>But the gentlemen and ladies in modern-dressed tragedies, forty years ago, at Covent Garden the∣atre, wore the old laced clothes which had done many years service at Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, be∣sides having graced the original wearers; and the ladies were in large hoops, and the velvet petti∣coats, heavily embossed, proved extremely incon∣venient
<PB N="89" REF="88"/>
and troublesome, and always a page be∣hind to hear the lover's secrets, and keep the train in graceful decorum. If two princesses met on the stage, with the frequent stage-crossing, then practised, it would now seem truly entertaining to behold a page dangling at the tail of each heroine; and I have seen a young lady, not of the most de∣licate form, who sustained that office frequently—a Miss Mullart;—they are now dismissed, as judged unnecessary and superfluous—but luckily they were pages of honour, and as truly to be de∣pended upon as Edinburgh caddies, as I have ne∣ver heard of any misdemeanor brought into court by their impeachment:—Yet theatrical l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs and queens, like their brethren mortals, sometimes have been frail; but they were family secrets, and ought not to be mentioned again. I have seen Mrs. Woffington dressed in high taste for Mrs. Phillis, for then all ladies' com∣panions or gentlewomens' gentlewomen, actually appeared in that style of dress; nay, even the co∣mical Clive dressed her Chambermaids, Lappet, Lettice, &amp;c. in the same manner, authorised from what custom had warranted when they were in their younger days; and in my remembrance, not a first servant maid, or unfortunate female, that usurped a right of Strand walk, which she termed her own trodden ground, from St. Mary-le-Strand
<PB N="90" REF="89"/>
to Exeter Change, but what swaggered in her large banging hoop, to the terror of any young novice who dared usurp a footing of those terri∣tories:—In short, a large hoop was a requisite and indispensable mode of dress. Strict propriety of habiliment not any manager has yet arrived at, even in London; and though it is so highly im∣proved these last twenty years, yet the achievement not even money will ever be able to obtain, that is, while the stage is honoured with pretty women, as I sincerely hope it ever will be;—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or common sense, reason, persuasion, nor intreaty, will ever persuade handsome women to appear in a farmer's daughter, or a witch, or a servant maid, but with the head dressed in full fashion, and the feet deck∣in satin shoes; yet I think they would be gainers by trying dear variety: For what will attract more than the simple Quaker, or the truly neat chamber∣maid? and it is not every m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n that wishes for a du∣chess: besides what an advantage to be seen in a gaudy attire one night, and another arrayed in pure simplicity, and be viewed with propriety in a green stuff gown, &amp;c. and not as Madge in Love in a Village, or Betsy Blossom, with a French head, white silk stockings, and white satin shoes; by such contradictions Nature is as distant from the stage now as she was an hundred years ago; and stuff
<PB N="91" REF="90"/>
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oes and clean cotton stockings would look not only as well, but better, by the preservation of character:—Nay, the plain woman (if such there be) would not be behind hand, as she would, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear, keep equal pace in absurdity, and relinquish all pretensions to propriety, by being as fantastical as the most beautiful young one. And these con∣tradictions of dress and manner of behaviour are often beheld off the stage by chance observers, and are very properly introduced and ridiculed on, and receive the rod of correction from the comic Muse, as proper objects for the poet's satire and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he public mirth. Not any plays throughout were ever dressed as they are now—there the pub∣lic enjoy a splendor indeed superior to their fore∣fathers. Also in the magnificence of theatres, the scenery and lighting are now beyond compare; but it is evident our grannies had an idea of what they did not possess, as may be proved by the or∣ders for scenery in Sir William Davenant's plays, Dryden's. Tempest, King Arthur, Lee's Constan∣tine, Cyrus the Great, &amp;c. &amp;c. Except in Mr. Rich's pantomimes, the public then had seldom any scenery that proved of advantage, so as to allure the eye:—But now frequently we have new scenery to almost every piece. It was very uncommon formerly for new plays to
<PB N="92" REF="91"/>
have more than what we term stock scenery:—There is one scene at Covent Garden used from 1747 to this day in the Fop's Fortune, &amp;c. which has wings and flat, of Spanish figures at full length, and two folding doors in the mid∣dle:—I never see those wings slide on but I feel as if seeing my very old acquaintance unexpected∣ly. The advantage of the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w established theatres is another useful alteration for these times; tho' the Opera House, when first finished, must have been noble, as we are told by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ley Cibber it was so large they could not be heard till the cieling was lowered and the house lessened. The Little Theatre in the Hay Market, as it was called twenty-six years ago, till it was beautified and put into its present form b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mr. Foote and Mr. Colman, would <HI>now</HI> cut a very <HI>contemptible figure</HI> in most towns of England, and not fit to enter, after seeing Bath, Edinburgh, Bristol, Liverpool, York, and many other theatres. By this pro∣gress and embel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ishment of regular, handsome, well-ornamented theatres, with good scenery, wardrobe, and band, (at York in particular the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>er) we may be assured that these theatres are superior to those wherein Booth, Betterton, and Cibber acted; for though Drury Lane was larger than the most of our present country theatres, yet forty years ago the audience part
<PB N="93" REF="92"/>
of those London theatres were very crazy, in∣convenient, and not pleasing to the eye: and at present the stair-case to the <HI>upper boxes</HI> at Drury Lane is so narrow, that should an alarm of fire happen, the persons in the two upper tier of boxes would be thrown into such confusion, should they open at the same time the different doors, the passage is so strait and they would so effectually block up each other, that not one sin∣gle soul could escape, and their increasing fears would cause the situation to be alarming and dreadful to a degree. Indeed Covent Garden is not so complete in that department (at least it was not so when I saw that theatre before the late alter∣ations). The upper boxes at Edinburgh are far preferable to those at London for seeing, and in∣deed, in that respect, are better than any theatre I know; and it has an advantage (like Smock-Alley) by the audience part being formed in a well-finished circle. Drury Lane, like London-Bridge, has been much frittered and patched at very great expence; and, after all, the only way to repair will be to pull it down, and erect a new one:—which I understand is to be done, and I wish for health to see it finished. In proper-built con∣venient theatres, I am told, Paris has within these few years taken the lead, though some time ago <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was greatly inferior: If they are like the plates
<PB N="94" REF="93"/>
which I have of those theatres, they appear very noble and spacious, and not surrounded by build∣ings, but good open road for carriages round:—However, as a print is not always to be depended on, I cannot say more in praise of those struc∣tures, but, by what I guess, and what I have heard concerning those in Paris; and from the pictures sent to me from thence by Mr. Maude of York, who judged I should like a peep at those theatres, being at such a distance—Veu de Theatre Italien—Veu de Theatre Francois—L'Opera Proche la Porte Saint Martin.—The Opera House is far superior, particularly the stage, as two hundred soldiers, I am informed, at times appear thereon in tragic pieces when it is necessary. These alterations of theatres in the country I am not clear, on mature deliberation, have been done for the better—so much additional finery and splendor was not re∣quisite, as tolerable decent drapery may do very well for a house near Temple-Bar, that would look despicable in Grosvenor-Square:—Besides, while those inconveniences remained, the first actors and actresses would not have deigned to visit the provincial playhouses; for even when the theatres were closed sixty years ago, no principal performer ever played, as now, at Liverpool, Birmingham, &amp;c. as we may conclude from Mrs. Centlivre's Prologue to her Busy Body—<Q><PB N="95" REF="94"/>
<L>This season must things bear a smiling face,</L>
<L>But play'rs in summer have a dismal case,</L>
<L>Since your appearance only is our act of grace.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thirty years ago Mr. Barry or Mrs. Cibber would not have disgraced (as they at that time judged) their current London stamp for being paid in July in Birmingham coin on any account: In∣deed such would have been thought by their London patrons a most disagreeable and dis∣graceful exploit: And the Londoners will be asto∣nished to be truly informed, that <HI>now</HI> Mrs. Sid∣dons, Mrs. Jordan, and others, make their true golden harvest on their summer excursions out of the metropolis. Bath, from its great fashionable resort and consequence, has of course an impro∣ving theatre; and though only one hundred miles distant from London, causes in the Londoners many a wishful look to honour Bath with five or six nights in the course of a season, and thereby secure a couple of hundred pounds: But those Bath managers act more prudently, as they never permit London, or any other actors, however the voice of fame may have exalted them, to perform a few nights only:—Mrs. Crawford, for instance, lived there all the last winter, but she was not of∣fered any terms of engagement, only such as the theatre would afford as expenditure for the whole season; but no acting there for a short period to
<PB N="96" REF="95"/>
take the cream and leave the skimmed milk fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the managers and performers to exist on. Con∣sequently Bath not being capable to pay enormou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> salaries, the receipts being by no means adequate or proportionable, as London must secure the principal performers for the winter; and in case of disagreement, Dublin and Edinburgh are equal to reward their labours, by holding out a lucra∣tive and happy asylum. Great theatrical per∣sonages, who formerly used to look upon a city or town as a <HI>bore,</HI> now, on the contrary, in the sum∣mer grant they are commodious, respectable, and even alluring; and with great good manners, compliance, and condescension, will consent to tri∣fle away a few nights at such insignificant places: Even the Jordan herself, who at present reigns as our modern Thalia, has deigned to visit Chel∣tenham, Reading, Margate, Richmond, and Har∣rowgate, which places yielded great profits, sil∣ver medals and subscriptions falling at her feet in plentiful showers, and she (as greatness knows it∣self) acts naturally on such occasions:—Being <HI>earnest in her demands,</HI> I wish her every prospe∣rity, and hope she will accumulate—</P>
<P>London performers, when in the country, have only the trouble to repeat their tasks like young scholars sent for a six weeks vacation, who for the credit and pride of their papas and masters are ex∣pected
<PB N="97" REF="96"/>
to return perfect, and repeat when sent back to school. The consequence of these visitors, though it gratifies the pride of the audiences, (not forgetting also the manager's own <HI>ostentation,</HI> in the principal theatres remote from the great city) is not always productive, though it gives a glare to enterprise; therefore every ma∣nager out of London should watch his farm with as much fear and observance as a West Indian planter does a hurricane, which destroys his fine prospect, and he bestows three quarters of the year in hopes the fourth quarter's produce may make amends for devastation:—So the manager, with the little overplus gained, should never lay out what is so dearly bought in too lavish improve∣ments in a theatre; for the absence of the reign∣ing London favourite leaves a cold chill and om∣nious ill-fated blast on all theatrical culture for the year to come. Indeed there are always people and money, where fashion and inclination prompt them to attend a playhouse, which, when not so, the theatre only obtains contempt, false pity, and less attendance. It is true, by these advantages which I have taken the liberty to mention, plays are wonderfully altered for the better: but was I asked, <Q REND="inline">"If in consequence of such good fare, are not the audiences altered for the better also?"</Q> I should be compelled to answer, <Q REND="inline">"Indeed they are not,
<PB N="98" REF="97"/>
but far the contrary."</Q> Frequently seeing the best acting, has destroyed all theatrical <HI>regular</HI> relish. I was lead formerly to believe, when I first began the mode of procuring principal performers from London, it would have given information to the people in general, and made more and more con∣verts to my conventicles; but there I was egregi∣ously mistaken, for people who are not blessed with affluent fortunes in the middling class of life, with proud minds and little souls, have but as much for pleasures as they can prudently spare; therefore if they expend in one week what would serve for a month for themselves and their fami∣lies' purposes, there is likely to be a drawback—besides its being <HI>unfashionable,</HI> and then all is over with a theatre:—For many go to a play (as the fine lady says) sometimes, because—Because why? Because all the world is there;—not to see the play, but to be seen. And it is surprising my own appetite did not inform me this; for if I feed one week on pine-apples, grapes, nectarines, and peaches, I would rather go without fruit the week following than eat common pears, plums, or blackberries. Indeed patents have not only been a security for theatrical property, but have put the country ac∣tors on a more decent level, which was highly necessary; for though there are exceptions from all well-bred persons, yet an actor in London is
<PB N="99" REF="98"/>
very differently respected to what he is in the country. It is so in common life;—we are con∣nected with, or behaved to by, a dependent or in∣dependent acquaintance as interest, caprice, or the humour hits. A Cockney, merely confined to London, and who thinks it a journey from Wapping to Covent Garden to see the play, is certainly of all critics one of the worst; for he was born in London and lives in London, and any brother mechanic from a distant county is looked on as ignorant, and told how to <HI>comport</HI> himself. On retrospect I recollect an instance of this kind in myself; for, till the age of seventeen, I judged every man and woman I saw ignorant and stupid who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ived two miles beyond Richmond and Hamp∣ton Court: A stronger instance I remember of Mr. Townsend, whose respectable family I have so fre∣quently before-mentioned; he honoured me with be ng my cashier, and when I mentioned wanting it as the York manager, he said, <Q REND="inline">"What a fool must you be, Tate, to trust your money with Yorkshire people, for they think of nothing but to over-reach us here in the south?"</Q> Another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vulgar Cockney wisdom I was shewn a few years ago, when I was relating in London an history <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with every respect, and indeed blazoning ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ern f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes, races, &amp;c. and concluding my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the ladies going to the assembly-rooms

<P>One disadvantage more to the managers of country theatres arises from the roads being so excellent to what they were formerly, and the va∣rious conveniences for those in middling life as well as the affluent, the increase of fashionable dissipation, &amp;c. are all combined causes for the ruin of country theatres.</P>

I know not one instance at present where any manager and actor makes a fortune:—Garrick did, but Colley Cibber merely retired with a competency—Wilkes and Booth no more—Betterton died very poor; a man it is said ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> body loved, in and out of the theatre; and known by courtier and peasant by the appella∣tion of <HI>honest Tom</HI>—that was honour indeed as an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or and manager—it is so written down in stage history: and I cannot contradict it:—it is true he had the appellation from all who knew him of <HI>honest Tom,</HI> but neither his genius, his labour, his excellence, same, goodness, nor even his honesty had pro∣cure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him gentleman-like existence, as he had a ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ty-benefit at the age of seventy-five, when he was supported on one side by Mrs. Barry, a fa ous actress at that time, and the celebrated Mrs. Bracegirdle on the other, who had quitted the theatre for many years in her bloom of youth with unsullied reputation, and was the admira∣tion
<PB N="108" REF="107"/>
of all who beheld her, on or off the stage.—Mrs. Bracegirdle, I believe, has not been dead above twenty-five years—her age must have been remarkable.—She was well born, and brought on the stage by Mr. Betterton; was, I believe, the original Statira, and in most of Rowe's tragedies: Mrs. Pritchard shewed me her part of Clarissa in the Confederacy, which was written out by Mrs. Bracegirdle's own hand; they were acquainted, and Mrs. Pritchard told me, that venerable actress came there on purpose to see her act Mrs. Oakley in the Jealous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife during its first run.</P>
<P>The advantages I have mentioned the London theatres flourish with at present are not all con∣fined to what I have asserted as to the theatres, dresses, scenery, and many accommodations; but there is no alteration better, than the stage in these days not being infested with persons behind the scenes in common, but particularly on benefit nights.—As a proof of the force of absurdity I have often wondered, and so have others, why new stage boxes (placed where the useful stage doors used to be) were frequented; but, in short, there are persons always who would prefer such a box, were it much higher on the stage, so few want really to see the piece attentively:—Wit∣ness ladies of fashion in London, thirty years ago, sitting at the very backs of the performers.—

When I had the honour at York to wait upon his Royal Highness the late Duke of York, he said, <Q REND="inline">"Wilkinson! where am I to sit?"—I replied, "In the stage box." At which he smiled, and said, "So because I am the Duke of York I must sit in the worst box in the theatre for seeing the play!"</Q></P>
<P>The theatres formerly were not large enough on such occasions, as frequently, on the benefit of a Woodward, a Mrs. Cibber, a Shuter, and others, was the case; therefore the following ad∣vertisement appeared at the bottom of each play∣bill on any benefit of consequence:—<Q REND="inline">"Part of the pit will be railed into the boxes; and for the better accommodation of the ladies, the stage will be formed into an amphitheatre, where servants will be allowed to keep places."</Q> When a great house was not sufficiently ascertained (as the per∣fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged) for the places taken and the tickets sold, at the bottom of the bill was, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>N.

the supposed tomb, which was no more than a screen on those nights set up, and Mrs. Cibber prostrating herself on an old couch, covered with black cloth, as the tomb of the Capulets, with at least (on a great benefit night) two hundred per∣sons behind her, which for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the back ground, as an unfrequented hallowed place of <HI>chaplels</HI> skulls, which was to convey the idea of where the heads of all her buried ancestors were packed.</P>

Nay, the stage, which was not thirty years ago near so wide as at present, also the stage∣doors, (which must be well remembered) and the stage-boxes, before which there were false canvas, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nclosed fronts on each side of two or three seats, on to the lamps, for ladies of distinction, which ren∣dered it next to impossible for those ladies in the stage-boxes to see at all; but still it was the fashion,
<PB N="112" REF="111"/>
and therefore of course charming and delightful.—and whenever a Don Choleric in the Fop's For∣tune, or Sir Amorous Varnict, in Woman's a Riddle, or Charles in the Busy Body, tried to find out secrets or plot an escape from a balcony, they always bowed and thrust themselves into the boxes over the stage-door amidst the company, who were greatly disturbed, and obliged to give up their seats.</P>
<P>The actor talked of being alone amongst hun∣dreds; and Sir Amorous hung in a sling, with Mrs. Betty adding to the inconvenience. These were faults indeed, and almost beyond belief, within these forty years, even with all the knowledge of the Bettertons, Cibbers, Booths, and Wilks to have cleared the way, and not have left such passages of the Drama to be corrected; which their own honour and common sense might so easily have removed and expunged from their journals of disgrace: as they must now remain a lasting stigma on their taste a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d judgment.</P>

I can well remember, when I was thirteen years of age, viewing Mr. Quin, on Monday, March 19, 1753, for the benefit of Mr. Ryan, play the cha∣racter of Falstaff. He was thus announced in the play-bill: <Q>"The part of Falstaff WILL be performed by Mr. QUIN"—</Q>Which was his last night of performing.—The Stage was at 5s.—Pit and Boxes all joined together at 5s. There was only one en∣trance on each side the stage, which was always particularly crowded. First, they sported their own figures to gratify self consequence, and impede and interfere with the performers who had to come on and go off the stage.

<P>At the time this bear-garden flourished in our th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tres, whenever on the managers' nights the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> overflowed in the winter season; not only their acquaintance, but persons of distinction and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were indiscriminately admitted behind the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, particularly at Drury-Lane on the nights Mr. Garrick acted his first esteemed characters of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lear, Bayes, &amp;c. but I have often seen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> distre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed on such nights.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"N. B. There will not be any building on the stage."</Q></P>
<P>When Rich, after two or three years' promise and delay, brought forth one of these long-wished-for pantomimes, it was a rage, a madness incre∣dible seized all the Londoners: On such fortunate occurrences Mr. Rich was strongly attached and tenderly tenacious of his harlequin jacket being prophaned or infringed upon; and kept his holy rites and mysteries of serpents, lions, druids, &amp;c. sacred from the inspection of all curious

p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying inspectors. Nor would he have had his magical sword interrupted, or his fountains and cascades stopped in their munificent flow to the admiring and astonished crowds in front, to have pleased all the nobility in the kingdom. And in∣deed the difference of performing pantomimes under Mr. Rich's direction and skill was as much superior at that time, as was Mr. Garrick's Hamlet at Drury-Lane compared to old Ryan's at Covent-Garden.</P>

<P>This is a proof that Garrick saw and felt the evil in his younger days; and he at last mustered courage by one bold stroke to put the hatchet to the tree, and thereby annihilate the grievance; and tho' he had undergone these hardships and inconveniences for many years, with the utmost severity and patience, yet he judged it a reformation due to his future name and fame. And I may observe it is not always seen that much-wished-for alterations, even in affairs of the utmost moment, are in general ap∣proved or willingly submitted to by the million; with whom no reason or argument will or can convince, or wear off ancient customs and pre∣ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ices.</P>
<P>As Mr. Garrick had three parties to encounter, and each formidab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, when bundled they were truly alarming. First, to banish the young beaux from behind the scene was judged a daring attempt; (though Mr. Sheridan had proved it was to be done in Dublin, where the behaviour sometimes had been mentioned as <HI>most savage</HI>;) as the manager's right to rule, where young men of ton
<PB N="121" REF="120"/>
we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e concerned, was looked upon as a vulgar law, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h none but the mean spirited obeyed. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r order were attached to it; as going behind the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cenes on benefit nights pleased young clerks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd others, who liked to see the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>resses nearer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey were accustomed to; also most of the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ipal, and several of the middling class of the per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormers would not choose to pay Mr. Garrick's ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rges for their benefit nights, and be abridged o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l or a 150l. advantage, accruing from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uilding and general admittance on the stage.</P>
<P>Garrick did not like the obstacles he had to encounter, till a lucky thought burst in upon his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> concerning that business. He reflected t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at the theatre was but in an indifferent state; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that by enlarging it to the now present fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, 1790, it would not only immediately an∣swe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for his pecuniary advantages, but also for a pub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> c theatrical property, which he meant in four or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive years after that to part with to the best <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as was the case when Doctor Ford, Mr. Sheridan, and Mr. Linley, were the purchasers, a he grew harassed, and had secured affluence in an o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er abundance. Which makes it lamentable to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sider how short a time he enjoyed a private <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for he was snatched from his friends and all h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rldly wealth, in about two years after his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>age farewell.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="121"/>
However his projected plan he put in practice; altered the Old Drury-Lane into its present form, which now holds considerably above 100l. in front more than it did thirty years ago: and, after this beneficial alteration was accomplished, by degrees all parties were pleased and convinced of its propriety. The comedians had particular rea∣sons to jump for joy, as they received the same be∣nefit emoluments, without those degrading and irk∣some situations, which interest had made them sub∣mit to. The Covent-Garden managers adopted the same change of measures, and from that time general admittance and stage building, on bene∣fits, has ever been prohibited.</P>
<P>These stage remarks have carried my me∣mory back to recollect that the same evils ex∣isted in provincial theatres, and in a worse de∣gree; as those stages (not being formed into an amphitheatre) were without any order or decen∣cy, merely rows of forms, one level with the other: for the audience part of those theatres were full large for their usual seasons of acting; yet on particular benefits, London furnished a plea for what might be attempted to render the bad playhouses worse than they were before. And the alterations in this respect, from Mr. Garrick's reformation of abuses in London, I should ap∣prehend
<PB N="123" REF="122"/>
led into the sudden wonderful improve∣ments, enlargements, and aggrandizing of most of our theatres in every principal town and city.</P>
<P>And as to the article of being freed from beaux behind the scenes, a greater blessing could not be wished or more devoutly prayed for; as it cannot be conceived how dreadful in the country that would sometimes prove, (my own situation in my history mentioned at Shrewsbury, is one instance) the hauteur and dignity of such visitants being often so insulting and imperious as not to be de∣scribed.</P>
<P>The receipts of the theatres, it is true, should be mentioned. In 1750, two hundred pounds be∣fore the curtain, at Covent-Garden, was judged an amazing sum. Now, we hear of upwards of four hundred pounds; but the profits of the sea∣son I dare pronounce are not equal to Mr. Gar∣rick's reign, the expences are grown so enormous.</P>
<P>At Dublin, in 1757, one hundred and fifty pounds was a great house indeed. In 1763, one hundred and eighty pounds at Crow-Street was ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged a wonder: but with the late alterations, Mr. Daly had, in July 179<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, three hundred and twenty-four pounds; and he mentions hundreds that could not obtain admittance.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="123"/>
Mr. Garrick was certainly formed to obtain fa∣vour:—and the public, in general, willingly sub∣scribed to his proposals (though like man and wife they sometimes did not agree):—His coffers were always full, and he was too great an oeconomist <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver to empty them by the hand of extravagance:—he locked on his Majesty's picture with love and reverence, and never parted with his King's likene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s but with the greatest relu ance.—The expences of the house were not then so great as at present; for when I had a benefit at Covent Garden, 1760, I only paid 60l.; now I believe performers pay 120l.; and if Mrs. Jordan acts on that benefit, it is ten guineas more.</P>
<P>It is worthy remark, that with all the boasted im∣provements, certainly the goings out are immense in proportion to the comings in; and where there was one place open against the theatres then, now there are double—such as various new-established con∣certs at Hanover-Square, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ottenham-Court, Pan∣theon, besides Astley's, the Circus, &amp;c. therefore, with the London managers being at double the expence of their predecessors, I can never coin∣cide with the opinions started by dissatisfied per∣formers, or as o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten hinted at in the news papers. But let us ask, is there a superfluity of principal actors? Certainly no. Are the managers in great
<PB N="125" REF="124"/>
circumstances? Certainly no. One play got up now will cost more than three would, fifty years ago. I have heard great arguments of what encourage∣ment would be given by a third theatre instead of the present, termed monopoly. Were it possible to create three industrious Mr. Sheridans to write for the stage, something might be said and done, but I fear not otherwise; and if people in general find their plays not all perfection with two com∣panies, I cannot conceive that, divided into three, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would be acted better—Nay, is not Mr. Harris reduced (I say reduced, or he certainly w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld not do it) to cut plays into farces, and give farces instead of plays, and sometimes all farce and no play, with different <HI>boxers,</HI> Mendoza and Humphreys, on the stage, for the entertainment of the first audience in the world? in which he has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulfilled Garrick's prophecy; for the theatre royal at Covent Garden gives a dish of all sorts: And were they twenty years since to have seen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> medley play-bills at a third theatre, or from York or Edinburgh, such stuff would have ser∣ved the whole green-room in London for a week's laugh at the country strollers' expence:—B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, such productions, if to be tolerated and approved at all, should certainly be permitted only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a summer theatre, when the wine and the wea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her is hot.</P>

<P>As to gentlemen writers of genius being ex∣cluded from having their works produced, I can∣not think the injustice alledged is by any means founded on truth or equit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; for I never can be∣lieve, even tho' many good plays were to be sunk in oblivion, but that some of them would again visit the world in print, to gratify the au∣thor's pride and reputation, and by such means prove how indifferent managers were to merit:—I do not mean to insinuate that there are not good authors at present capable of affording the highest and most improving additions to the stage cata∣logue; I only wish to be understood, that the stage is not overstocked with such offers; and it is too probable that authors may have occasion perhaps to complain of indifferent and improper treatment, as a London manager is not, like the Pope, a ways infallible. I am only speaking by guess, not being a quainted with the facts. It is certain the new pieces brought out, in a general
<PB N="127" REF="126"/>
way, do not please; and as money is always wel∣come, I cannot think any projector existing would be at great expence to produce a piece that creates confusion in the theatre, damnation to the author, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d if persisted in, he excludes the possibility of crowded houses, besides being well abused in every public print into the bargain. I cannot t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ink Mr. Harris would lavish money on the Prophetess if he had as good a new opera to produce as the Duenna; (the very run of such a piece as the latter would supply him for half the seas n) or that Mr. Kemble would produce a co∣medy, only acted three nights, if he had been pre∣sented with one equal to the School for Scandal. And, indeed, how few plays of late seasons reach the ninth night! What a quantity of plays, farces, and pantomimes, do the three theatres ex∣hibit in the course of the year, and how few succeed! What perpetual labour and anxiety mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the performers undergo, and all end in vex∣ation of spirit,—all for nothing—some few pieces excepted, which need not be enumerated; as those that live, and are the oftenest acted, prove their public estimation. One great fault has crept into the benefit bills in London, filling them up with such a quantity of interludes, &amp;c.—I am sorry to observe Mr. Garrick was the introducer—he led
<PB N="128" REF="127"/>
the way to what has grown to an enormous height, but I am certain he never meant the ill effects it has established. But his Farmer's Re∣turn, Linco's Travels, &amp;c. wrote as interludes, have considerably lessened the dignity of the drama. It was the practice at my own theatres: I at first, on benefit nights, insisted on all inter∣ludes being done as afterludes, but nothing would do, so as to keep the play-bills <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to be seen, they were so loaded with trumpe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y: so for some years past I have not had any preludes, interludes, or afterludes at all. Mr. Kemble wished, on his night in August 1788, at York, to introduce the Toy Shop as an interlude, (which he had for∣merly done, and which gave great satisfaction on account of his excellent performance of the Ma∣ster); but unless he took it as a farce I was com∣pelled not to suffer it, on account of my establish∣ed law, which Mr. Kemble, at the head of the profession, breaking through, would have set aside <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> law by the example from his high authority and judgment. I remember his reply was, <Q REND="inline">"That the act was good, it kept in force; but," added he jokingly, "Mr. Wilkinson, the first be∣nefit bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your own night I shall find it full of interludes!"</Q> However, it has not hap∣pened yet, and I dare say never will to any bene∣fit of mine.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="128"/>
London opinion, though its stamp passes cur∣rent in provincial towns as to first-rate performers, yet has so fallen in reputation as to pieces, that it is not a recommendation in advertising a new play, but the contrary; and many are never at∣tempted: So that there is no wish to see a new production unless much spoken of, and it has fortunately had a very considerable run; but even that was not always secure its footing. I have great obligations to acknowledge to the School for Scandal, the Poor Soldier, and the Farmer, of modern date.</P>
<P>As I have given an account of the amazing al∣terations as to the manners practised in the theatres, not much longer ago than our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prime, yet so quick is the transition, that a few only remain now who can affirm or contradict what I have inserted: A proof how we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣ceived by the apparent slowness of the running sand in the hour-glass, which in reality <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> astonishing rapidity, and wafts us dreaming from life to <HI>dusty</HI> death!

<P>THIS Repository or Journal, is offered not only to young stage candidates, but at the same time to the attention of all amateurs of the Drama; as it will be a guide, and a more regular information to them, and indeed to the public in general, than any thing of the kind yet attempted—though I fear presented in a bungling manner: Still this account of old sta∣gers must be in some degree venerable, as an old coin is in higher esteem with antiquarians than the new, though of less intrinsic worth.—I wish it had the advantage of a better head, but that is past praying for; yet it will be a kind of guide, and convey information by no means pub∣licly known, wherein the reader will find almost an exact list of every theatrical event, with the date of most of the new or revived plays and far∣ces produced—the performers' engagements and
<PB N="131" REF="130"/>
desertions to and from Ireland to the London Theatres—their re-engagements, and the account of singers, dancers, burlettas, incidents, &amp;c. from the year 1747, to the conclusion of 1757.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick's establishment, as joint manager with Mr. Lacey, was in 1747, and few persons who have been readers of theatrical anecdotes have y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, since the time of Colley Cibber, had any accurate or regular account of those years more than in a general view, though there certainly has been able writers and men of genius who have treated on more important theatrical subjects.</P>
<P>I will here give a list of the companies at Drury-Lane and Covent-Garden in 1747, that the observant reader, unprejudiced, may see what a number of established actors were at that period in one company, and whether there are the same number of <HI>equal eminence</HI> to be called so at present at either Theatre.</P>
<P>The modern critic and actor will undoubtedly admit that every fifty years will make havock and considerable alteration, and what is approved and applauded now, 1790, may not be sanctioned in 184<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.—When Mr. Garrick undertook the ma∣na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ement, the company collected, was perhaps, take it for all in all, the most powerful ever mustered in the present century.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="131"/>
I will first give as correct a list as I can recol∣lect, then present the cast of two or three plays, and then instance the cast of the same plays in 1789; by which means the unprejudiced reflector may draw a fair conclusion; and perhaps allow it not quite improbable but the play so acted might have been seen with equal pleasure then as now.</P>

<P>A set of very capital dancers was this year at Drury-Lane:—Mr. Cooke, Monsieur Grand∣champs, Madam Auretti, (in the serious style) in great estimation, and Madamoiselle Janeton Au∣retti.</P>
<P>A favorite pantomime dance was served up often, called the Savoyard Travellers.</P>
<P>Madame Auretti continued only the season fol∣lowing, when her benefit was commanded by his Majesty George the Second.—Play, the Strata∣gem.—Mr. Garrick acted Archer.—After which she retired from the stage, and Mr. Cooke went over to Covent-Garden the season follow∣ing.</P>

<P>ALBUMAZER was revived in 1747, by Mr. Garrick, and did not succeed.—From which play the circumstance of the robbery is evidently stolen, and converted into Tony Lumpkin's principal scene of Dr. Goldsmith's very entertaining Co∣medy of "She Stoops to Conquer."</P>
<P>COVENT-GARDEN, 1747.</P>
<P>The Company was very weak indeed.—Mr. Rich, more from laziness than lack of genius, had not any pantomime in force, but the then very stale one of Merlin's Cave, or Harlequin Skeleton. They played in general only three or four times in the week in January, and often dis∣missed even in the month of February; for Gar∣rick had swept most of the actors of merit from Covent-Garden to Drury-Lane, for his trium∣phal entry as manager—Quin had retired to Bath in disgust at Garrick's unparalleled success, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here remained with Mr. Rich only as follows:<Q><PB N="136" REF="135"/><LIST>

<P>The season was so bad, that in February the benefits commenced; and late in March 1748, Mr. Rich brought forward APOLLO and DAPHNE, which drew good houses.—Harle∣quin, Mr. PHILLIPS, (who supplied that charac∣ter as Mr. Rich's substitute, when he did not choose to perform, as Mr. Lun.)

The same year the Emperor of the Moon, written by Mrs. Behn, was revived at Drury-lane as a second piece.—Harlequin was tossed in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lanket with a good effect—he had two long slips <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y which he held—they were imperceptible to the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ience: So that Harlequin seemed to the eye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> violently tumbled; and the galleries, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the appearance of mischief, were vastly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

<P>COVENT-GARDEN, 1748-9.</P>
<P>Several theatrical alterations took place—Mr. Rich was roused from his slumber—Mr. Quin returned to the stage; and Mr. Delane, Mr. Sparks, Mr. Arthur, Mrs. Woffington, and Miss Pitt were engaged from Drury-Lane; also Miss Bellamy, (by Mr. Victor and others falsely related to have been drawn from her lucrative and splendid s tuation in Dublin, by Garrick) was actually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣gaged by Mr. Rich.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bellamy's first appearance was in Belvi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ra; which proves Mr. Victor's account of Co∣vent Garden very erroneous.—<Q REND="inline">"Mr. Garrick, (says Mr. Victor and Mr. Hitchcock) from the many opportunities he had of seeing Miss Bella∣my's abilities, when they performed together in
<PB N="144" REF="143"/>
Dublin, 1746, was too well convinced of her merit, not to use every means to engage her.—Accordingly he made her proposals, which she immediately accepted; and she returned to Lon∣don, where she remained some years in high estimation."</Q></P>
<P>That Mrs. Bellamy remained for some time in high estimation is well known—but her first ap∣pearance, after her departure from Dublin, was not at Mr. Garrick's theatre, but at Covent-garden, as before mentioned: a true and particular account of which, with Mr. Garrick's <HI>refusal</HI> to engage her, is given in her Memoirs.</P>
<P>Mrs. Ward was also engaged—she was a hand∣some woman, and a good actress.</P>
<P>Coriolanus, by Thompson, was produced that season; in which Mr. Quin, Mr. Ryan, Mr. Delane, Mr. Sparks, Mr. Ridout, Mrs. Bellamy, and Mrs. Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ington acted.</P>
<P>Perseus and Andromeda was also produced, and brought several houses—so that Mr. Rich then had three pantomimes on the stocks: the Skele∣ton, Apollo and Daphne and Perseus. The bu∣siness of the <HI>petit maitre</HI> in the last mentioned was inimitably done by Mr. Lalmaze; palpably stolen by Mr. Woodward, and placed in Queen Mab, at Drury Lane, in the year 1750. The scene of the
<PB N="145" REF="144"/>
Dragon, and Perseus on his flying horse, with Andro∣meda chained to the rock, the rising Dome, and the Lion, were the principal parts of that entertain∣ment; and all done well, as was all pantomime business under the direction of Mr. Rich.</P>
<P>Mr. Arthur did the clown in that pantomime, in which department he was unrivalled; and well understood all the <HI>mechanical</HI> parts of those kind of productions.—Mr. Lowe was Perseus; Mr. Miles, Harlequin; Miss Falkener, Andromeda.—Mr. Quin's Falstaff, and several of his characters drew great audiences—Mrs. Bellamy was much esteemed—Mrs. Woffington was attractive in Sir Harry Wildair, &amp;c.—and though Drury-Lane was fashionable, yet Covent-Garden was respectable as to entertainment, and in general well attended.</P>

<P>The Provoked Wife was acted with approba∣tion that season at Covent-garden; for though Garrick was then performing Sir John Brute, yet there were many obstinate critics of opinion, that the character was better conducted by Mr. Quin. Indeed there cannot be any one part acted more dif∣ferently than that character was by Mr. Garrick and Mr. Quin Yet had the author been then living I may venture to pronounce he would have allowed both right. Even the petticoat scene was as op∣posite in dress and manner as Othello and Desde¦mona.

A tapestry scene of figures was very well executed—Doctor Bellardo, by Mr. Sparks; Harlequin, Mr. Cushing; Sca∣ramouch, Mr. Dunstall:—Miss Bellamy, Mrs. Woffington, and Mrs. Ward were in it, but the piece did not succeed; and Harlequin is the fiddle of the piece, Mr. Woodward must have been excellent, and Mr. Cushing contemptible.

<P>Mrs. Cibber did not play. That season Mr. Garrick (shameful to relate) encouraged Mrs. Ward to break articles with Mr Rich, which she was the easier tempted to do, as Miss Bellamy was in possession of most of the characters she wished to play. Edward the Black Prince was acted that season—Barry gained great ground and honour in Ribemont. Master Mattocks appeared that year in the Chaplet, a very pretty enter∣tainment at that time.—Musical pieces then
<PB N="150" REF="149"/>
(King Arthur and the Tempest excepted) were, on our English stage, confined to the common ballad farces.—Mr. Beard was, as a vocal per∣former, the best actor of SONGS I ever remem∣ber—Miss Norris was a charming singer—and Pastora cannot be known but by those who had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Clive.</P>
<P>Mrs. Cibber having withdrawn was a severe stroke upon the Drury Lane tragedies, Mrs. Ward being but a cold and inanimate substitute; and it fell heavier on Mr. Barry's plays than Mr. Garrick's, as Lear, Macbeth, Richard, with Mrs. Pritchard's Lady Macbeth, &amp;c. would do without Mrs. Cibber; but Castalio, Romeo, Varanes, &amp;c. were ruined without her helping hand: Indeed Barry refused acting Romeo with Mrs. Ward. The Roman Father was brought out that season, where Barry in Publius by no means could appear as an actor (though it shewed his fine figure) in competition with Garrick. Gil Blas was produced that year and damned, and some other pieces, but none of note. Rich not having any thing new, and only repeating the old plays, Lady Jane Gray excepted and the pantomime of the Fair, Drury Lane, unless on particular nights, bore the beil. Garrick's comedy characters, as well as his tragedy, (such as Ranger, Benedick,
<PB N="151" REF="150"/>
Archer, Bayes, Lear, Hamlet, &amp;c.) were sure cards, and all those plays were thoroughly well acted.</P>
<P>COVENT GARDEN, 1749-50.</P>
<P>The company much the same as the year be∣fore, unless the loss of Mr. Theophilus Cibber: Mr. Dyer from Ireland was his substitute, a very good actor in sprightly comedy; not striking as to abilities, but sure to please, and never to offend. He played several parts of Mr. Garrick's, such as Ranger, &amp;c. and in Tom was truly excellent;—that was his first part at Covent. Garden. Mr. Dyer's figure was very neat, not unlike that of Mr. Lewis's of Covent Garden; but it would be paying Mr. Lewis a very bad complement to draw a comparison in any other respect, as that gentleman's vivacity, neatness, spirit, and energy of expression, is so superior as to cast Mr. Dyer's abilities at a distance, were he now living; as wherever Mr. Lewis's Vapid, Twineall, Mercutio, &amp;c. are men∣t oned, which he supports with a peculiar whim and vivacity, he by that means sends hundreds joyful to their respective homes: In truth he needs no eulogium, as the truest praise is deservedly thus, that whether Mr. Lewis had pleased the audience in 1700, 1790, or in 1810, he would have an equal claim to the generosity, pro∣tection,
<PB N="152" REF="151"/>
and approbation of a sensible, generous, and discerning public.</P>
<P>Garrick's reasoning in verse will explain that idea when perhaps I should only perplex—<Q><L>Your children cannot feel what you have known,</L>

<P>Lady Jane Gray was revived by command of his Royal Highness Frederick Prince of Wales, as a second performance by the Royal Family, un∣der the direction of Mr. Quin, at Leicester House. It added much to Mrs. Woffington's reputation. The parts were thus disposed of:— <Q><LIST>

used to strike my young imagination so forcibly at ten years old, that I remember it <HI>perfectly</HI> to this very minute.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="152"/>
That year Mr. Rich produced a little sketch of a pantomime called the Fair, in which Mr. Lun (Rich) did Harlequin. Lun had been the name of the famous man who represented Harlequin at Paris; therefore whenever Mr. Rich appeared as Harlequin, the name of Lun was inserted in the bil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. Mr. Garrick paid a compliment to Mr. Rich's Harlequin in the following lines:—<Q><L>But why a speaking Harlequin? 'tis wrong,</L>
<L>The wits will say, to give the fool a tongue!</L>
<L>When LUN appear'd with matchless art and whim,</L>
<L>He gave the pow'r of speech to ev'ry limb;</L>
<L>Tho' mask'd, and mute, convey'd his quick intent▪</L>
<L>And told in frolic gestures all he meant—</L>
<L>But now the motley coat and sword of wood</L>
<L>Requires a tongue to make them understood.</L></Q></P>
<P>The famous Turk on the wire was at that time introduced by Mr. Rich in the pantomime of the Fair; and indeed that was the sole motive of his patching up that entertainment. Mr. Quin and Mrs. Woffington would not play during the re∣presentation of that piece, as they thought it de∣grading to the theatre to have wire-dancers, &amp;c. but as it did not interfere with their plays, and they were paid, and as that trifle brought several good houses, by which means they would have appeared to advantage, they certainly acted wrong
<PB N="154" REF="153"/>
in duty to the manager, the public, and their own intere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t:—The public were the only proper judges to decide on the propriety or impropriety; and if THEY suffered the Grand Turk to exhibit, they should have acquiesced and not withdrawn and pointed out the fault; which might have worked up a fury against the theatre that would have fallen upon themselves.</P>
<P>Romeo and Juliet was revived in the interim between Quin and Woffington's playing—Romeo, Mr. Lee; Juliet, Miss Bellamy. Mr. Lee had broke his article and fled to Covent Garden.—Mr. Lee's very peculiar oddity of temper pre∣vented him ever rising to any fixed public esti∣mation.</P>
<P>DRURY LANE, 1750-1.</P>
<P>Miss Bellamy was engaged from Covent Gar∣den, and trained as the Juliet—Woodward was the Mercutio. Mr. Garrick divided the opinion of the town as to his performance in Romeo—Mr. Rich's procession was very grand, and in those spectacles he never had been equalled, nor can be surpassed; but Garrick did not promise any procession or dirge in his bills, tho' they gave a striking effect and an agreeable surprise.—Mr. Woodward assisted Mr. Garrick with Queen Mab
<PB N="155" REF="154"/>
that season, which eased Garrick much; and the comedies were so well sustained, where Mr. Woodward, Mr. Yates, Mr. Taswell, Mrs. Pritchard, and Mrs. Clive, were capital, that the fairy wand sailed with the old Drury hulk before the wind. A whimsical print was then produced, called the Steel Yards, in in which were placed Quin, Barry, Woffington, and Cibber; and in opposition Woodward and Queen Mab, which exultingly bore down all the greater load with the small. This season Mr. Shuter was coming forward greatly as a low comedian at Drury Lane—also Mr. Palmer in the gentlemen in comedy, who afterwards sustained a very consi∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rable cast of the celebrated Mr. Wilkes's co∣medy-gentlemen, as Sir George Airy, &amp;c.—He some years afterwards married Miss Pritchard.</P>
<P>COVENT GARDEN, 1750-1.</P>
<P>Barry deserted to Covent Garden—Mrs. Cib∣ber also, after a year's retirement, engaged at the same theatre—Macklin and wife came from Dub∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> (also Mrs. Elmy) to that theatre—Quin and Woffington remained—Consequently Garrick f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und the coalition so strong, that he wished to bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> over Quin to his interest; but Quin having had the command at Covent Garden, did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh to be controuled by Mr. Garrick; he there∣fore
<PB N="156" REF="155"/>
stuck to his old master, Rich, but not without stipulating for one thousand pounds a year—the greatest salary ever then known to be complied with, or I believe since, except in the case of Mrs. Billington.</P>
<P>This collected body of Imperial forces might strike the boldest with dismay.—The whole con∣versation was, that Garrick would be ruined by such a powerful opposition; but they did not, or would not, comprehend that Garrick was really, as he expressed himself— <Q><L>Arm'd cap-a-pee in self-sufficient merit.</L></Q>
His Macbeth, Lear, Hamlet, Richard, Bayes, &amp;c. stood alone, nor, as he foretold, did his Lear or Hamlet lose their force:—Besides, he had industry, and his troops were under excellent discipline:—Woodward assisted him too in a material point—that of attacking Rich in his deemed invulnerable part—the harlequin department:—for tho' Rich despised actors, he for once in his life, in this season, relied on them, and had nothing to produce as to novelty in the pantomime way of any kind whatever.—Added to that, the performers at Co∣vent Garden were not under any controul: they despised their master—he despised them—and they heartily hated each other.—Quin disliked Barry,
<PB N="157" REF="156"/>
and Barry Quin—and Mrs. Cibber and Mrs. Woffington held each other in the highest con∣tempt.—Mrs. Cibber, when called upon by the manager, was often feignedly or really ill; and though Mrs. Woffington was ever ready for any undertaking for the general welfare, yet that year her pride was touched and irritated so much, that by a refusal one night a great riot ensued, as be∣fore mentioned in Vol. III.</P>
<P>Quin and Barry were also averse to assist each other.—King John was called to rehearsal, and Barry was not there. Quin would not attend the next rehearsal; and what Barry settled, Quin was sure, when he came, to contradict.</P>

<P>Two very odd incidents happened during th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> run of that play. They are in Mr. Davies's Miscellanies; but as I related them to Mr. Davies, I claim a right to insert them here.—For he was not in London at the time, as he played some seasons at York, Edinburgh, and Dublin; they were as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>"On Mr. Barry's endeavouring to repeat the following words in the first act of the play:—
<Q><L>"Well now I can make any Joan a lady—</L></Q></P>
<P>"He was so embarrassed in the delivery of this single line, that not being able to repeat the words he was obliged to quit the stage amidst the genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="159" REF="158"/>
applause of the audience, who saw and felt his uneasiness. But what is still more surprising, af∣ter going off, and returning three several times, with the same kind encouragement of the specta∣tors, he was forced to give it up; and I believe he did not recover himself till he was relieved by the entrance of Lady Falconbridge.</P>
<P>"Mrs. Cibber, during the representation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat Tragedy at Covent-garden theatre, the year 1750, was suddenly taken ill.—The play was however announced in the bills.—Mrs. Wof∣fington, who was ever ready to shew her respect to the public, and her willingness to promote the in∣terest of her employer, came forward to the front of the pit ready dressed for the character of Con∣stance, and offered, with permission of the audi∣ence, to supply Mrs. Cibber's place for that night. The spectators, instead of meeting her address with approbation, seemed to be entirely lost in sur∣prise. This unexpected reception so embarrassed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er that she was preparing to retire; when Ryan, who thought they only wanted a hint to rouse them from their insensibility, asked them bluntly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f they would give Mrs. Woffington leave to act had Constance?—The audience, as if at once awakened from a fit of lethargy, by repeated plau∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> strove to make amends for their inattention to
<PB N="160" REF="159"/>
the most beautiful woman that ever adorned a theatre."</P></Q></P>
<P>The Refusal was revived by Macklin that win∣ter. Mr. Lee played Granger; but Mr. Gar∣rick put the law in force for breach of his article, and he was obliged to return to Drury-Lane, where Garrick from that day held a rod of iron over him.</P>
<P>She Would if she Could was revived—a vile play indeed—not relished <HI>then</HI> by any means—<HI>now,</HI> to the credit of the audience, would not be tolerated.—The principal characters were per∣formed by Mr. and Mrs. Macklin, and Mrs. Elmy.</P>
<P>Mrs. Cibber was ill great part of the season. It was the last year of Mr. Quin's playing.—His benefit was about the twelfth of March—Othello the play.—The Moor was ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed alternately by him and Barry. When Barry acted Othello, Macklin played Iago: And when Quin acted Othello, Ryan was the Iago.—I wonder Quin's understanding would let him persist in acting Othello, where he was so inferior in every respect to Mr. Barry. Indeed for his last benefit the Prince of Wales commanded Othello.—Quin acted Iago to Barry's Othello; but strange to relate, with the change of characters, and the command, the house
<PB N="161" REF="160"/>
to that old favorite was very bad. There was not any farce that night; nor any new play at Co∣vent-garden from the year 1748 till 1753.</P>
<P>The last character Mr. Quin acted, as a regular engaged performer, was on the conclusive night but two in the season, May 20, 1751, Horatio, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air Penitent—Lothario, Barry; and Calista Mrs. Cibber: the best Calista I ever saw, and most likely, at my time of life, that I ever shall.—Barry not happy in Lothario.</P>
<P>In March 1751—His Royal Highness Frederick Prince of Wales died; when the theatres wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shut up for three weeks; which proves Miss Bella∣my's assertion wrong as to her being at Leicester-House, and the Princess of Wales patronizing her benefit, &amp;c.—the play to be the Siege of Damas∣cus, wishing to see their favourite veteran Quin, in his character of Caled; which if the reader will observe must be erroneous, for that year Miss Bel∣lamy was at Drury-lane theatre; and Mr. Davies must be wrong in his date; for this was the year of the run of Romeo and Juliet, when Mrs. Cibber was at Covent Garden.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bill of Romeo and Juliet, vol. 1. page 31.</NOTE></P>

And that might certainly be admitted as tolerable.</P>
<P>So different was the practice between then and now, relative to the principal performers acting on benefit nights in London, that Mr. Garrick acted every year from the first to the middling class of performers in general.</P>
<P>Mrs Woffi gton the season following quitted Covent-garden for Dublin; where she was held in such high estimation as to have her salary of four hundred pounds doubled the second and third winter; which the manager, from an acknow∣ledged sense of her value, judged a debt due to her merit and his own interest. She had also two benefits each season in Dublin. Mr. Victor gives the following description of that lady.—<Q REND="inline">"So generous was her conduct, though she seldom acted less than four nights a week, that she never disappointed one audience in three winters either by real or affected illness, and yet I have often seen her on the stage when she ought to have been in her bed."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Hitchcock adds the following:—</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="162"/>
<Q REND="inline">"To her honour be it ever remembered, that whilst thus in the zenith of her glory, courted and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ressed by all ranks and degrees, it made no al∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ation in her behaviour; she remained the same g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, affable, obliging, good-natured Woffington to every one around her.

<P>Mr. Quin took Othello, as before-mentioned. Mr. Barry, Romeo and Juliet—Mrs. Woffington, the Constant Couple.—Mr. Cooke's benefit
<PB N="164" REF="163"/>
was on Friday (previous to Prince Frederick's bu∣rial), when a capital blunder occurred.—as Mr. Quin's name was printed in capitals for the part of Young Bevil—but Mr Barry acted the part.—Indiana, by Mrs. Cibber, who hitherto has not been, and in all probability never will be matched in that character. Her manner of saying to Mr. Sea∣land, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, if you will pay the money to a servant it will do as well"</Q>—and the whole of her last scene in that play, was so truly affecting, expres∣sive, and natural, that she really caught the ball which all other Indiana's have been running after in vain.</P>
<P>I kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w it is said that first impressions do a great deal; but I can also assert that from Mr. Garrick, Mr. Quin, Mrs. Bellamy, Mrs. Crawford, and others, I could convey to any hearer a strong idea of their manners, tones, &amp;c. which would be ac∣knowledged and allowed as real traits by the most rigid observer now existing. But Mrs. Cibber's excellence was of that superior kind, that I can only retain her in my mind's eye. Not that all her characters were equally astonishing; for Mrs. Cibber was but a mere mortal: yet, her Alicia, Constance, Ophelia, Indiana, Juliet, &amp;c. were truly her own. Neat simplicity of manners in comedy was equally so. But her fine Ladies, and
<PB N="165" REF="164"/>
parts of striking humour, had better be (as they are) forgotten. This is a great character, but a just one.</P>
<P>The season concluded the two last nights with Romeo and Juliet, without any Farce, or Dance, &amp;c.</P>
<P>DRURY-LANE, 1751-2.</P>
<P>Its worthy observation that what leads historical reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sters perpetually into error, is the confounding the seasons: For as the theatres always open in September, and do not close till early in the fol∣lowing summer, not only the public, but the per∣formers themselves, are too apt to mistake one year for the other, from two dates being unavoid∣a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly connected with one season. Many particu∣lars of these times are related in my first volume.</P>
<P>The company remained much as the year be∣fore, as I do not remember any particular deser∣tions. Mr. Mossop and Mr. Ross were added, and of great additional strength; for they promi∣sed greatly from their first appearances.—Mr. Mossop's <HI>entrée</HI> was in Richard, then in Zanga—and much applauded. Mr. Ross in Young Bevil.—Mr. Dexter also made his appearance that year, and astonished every one in the character of

Oroonoko. His merit had such an effect at first as to promise wonders; and he was prognostica∣ted a powerful adversary to Barry in the Lovers: but when he left his honest black, his white pro∣mised nothing; it was a vacuum, and he sunk into oblivion. He went to Dublin, from whence he came. He had been educated in the College there: was in high esteem as a gentleman; and though not an actor of the first class, was gentle∣manlike in his deportment, had a pleasing voice, and played second to Mr. Sheridan; but he did not live many years. He was rather dejected at not succeeding on the stage in a more elevated style.</P>
<P>Mr. Wilder removed this year to Drury-Lane: did very little at either theatre; but was much applauded when he sung

Mr. Garrick was the only gentleman I ever saw make the character of Lothario truly conspicuous.</P>

<P>Every Man in his Humour was next revived, and with great success. That comedy increased in public estimation for some seasons. Indeed every part in that production of old Den's was so well acted, it was hard to point out how any one in that very difficult composition could be amend∣ed. It was a lucky stroke for Woodward's ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ancement with the town. His performance of Captain Bobadil was wonderful.</P>
<P>The Shepherd's Lottery, was a very pretty mu∣sical piece—Master Vernon (late Mr. Vernon) made his first appearance in that little Opera. The Duet of "By the pale light of the moon," was always encored at that time, when sung by Mr. Vernon and Miss Norris in that piece.—Harle∣quin Ranger also was much admired.—Wood∣ward was an excellent Harlequin. In his youth he had been taught that motley character by Mr. Rich, and had well observed that gentleman's in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ructions.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="167"/>COVENT-GARDEN, 1751-2.</P>
<P>Mr. Quin had retired from the stage May 1751; in March 1752, and March 1753, he came from Bath purposely to play Falstaff in the first part of King Henry IV. for his friend Mr. Ryan's bene∣fit: He after that left him a legacy, and made him a present; declaring he grew infirm, and would not <HI>whistle</HI> Falstaff.</P>
<P>Mrs. Woffington continued in Ireland; so Mr. Barry and Mrs. Cibber had all their own sway.—The Siege of Damascus was revived—Barry, Phocyas; and Mrs. Cibber, Eudocia. Mrs. Cibber also played Lady Townly, (not much to her credit). Venice Preserved was likewise acted, when Barry made his appearance as Jaf∣fier. He had usually played Pierre, and his figure was pleasing and commanding beyond de∣scription in that character. Mrs. Cibber's Bel∣videra was a non-such.—Mr. Rich revived that year the Necromancer, or Harlequin Doctor Faustus; the galleries liked such a dismal sight then, but I do not think it would be now tole∣rated. It was not pleasing to me at that time, who thought no paradise could exceed a playhouse.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="168"/>
Woodward revived Dr. Faustus, with new sce∣nery and more liveliness several years after at Co∣vent-garden, when it answered to the amusement of the public and the coffers of Covent-garden treasury.—In February, after several years' pro∣mise, out came Harlequin Sorcerer, which made old Drury tremble; for any thing like the rage after that pantomime I never remember.</P>
<P>In November 4, 1751, when Mr. Barry and Mr. Sparks were performing Bajazet and I amerlane, Arpasia, Mrs. Cibber, one of the gentlemen was so suddenly out in his part that the play could not proceed. After a considerable pause, Mrs. Cibber said, <Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen, it is not my turn to speak."</Q> After which the play proceeded without anv other blunder.

<P>Miss Macklin that season played Lady Townly for her father's benefit; also Jane Shore twice, early in the season.</P>
<P>Mrs Cibber played Lady Macbeth the first time, for her own benefit.</P>
<P>The season closed with Romeo and Juliet, and the Sorcerer.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="169"/>DRURY-LANE, 1752-3.</P>
<P>The Company much as before; only the los of Mrs. Ward, who was neither wanted nor re∣gretted; as Miss Bellamy's youth, fashion, dress &amp;c. aided with Mr. Garrick's powerful assistance enabled her to make a tolerable stand in tragedy against Mrs. Cibber, which Mrs. Ward was by no means equal to. Eugenia was acted, but did not succeed on the English stage, notwithstanding its being in great reputation then at Paris; and the Rev. Mr. Frances, the author, (or rather transla∣tor) was in high rank and esteem in London.</P>
<P>Mr. Foote's farce of Taste was produced that season—Lady Pentweazle, by Mr. Worsendale, a genius of much wit and humour, but it met with a similar fate to Gil Blas.—Mr. Garrick's speak∣ing the prologue, (which he wrote for that farce of Taste) was judged a master-piece; and the pro∣logue now speaks for itself, though alas! Gar∣rick <HI>cannot.</HI></P>
<P>The Gamester was acted—Mr. Garrick won∣derful—ay, most wonderful, in Beverley!—Boa∣dicia—revived by Mr. Glover.—Also the Genii, a pantomime, the Silent Woman, and the Bro∣thers, a tragedy, by Dr. Young; who gave the profits of his three nights, as an author, to a pub∣lic
<PB N="173" REF="170"/>
charity—but the amount not answering his wishes and expectations, he generously made up the sum to one thousand pounds.</P>
<P>COVENT-GARDEN, 1752-3.</P>
<P>Mr. Barry and Mrs. Cibber were in high esti∣mation, and to particular plays drew good houses. But, unless to a pantomime, or something of par∣ticular attraction, the boxes were often very thin at the early part of the season; whereas Drury-Lane was constantly attended.—Thin boxes on any night was seldom seen there; as a neatness, deco∣rum, and regularity, pervaded the whole. How∣ever Mr. Rich was very industrious that season.—Mrs. Bland was engaged from Ireland, who had made great progress on the Dublin stage. Mr. Giffard, junior, made his appearance in Lear, a very improper character; the play was wretchedly acted, when compared with the performance of the same piece at the rival theatre;—or indeed with∣out any comparison at all.—Signor Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anesi, and Signora Bugiani, were that season engaged; two inimitable dancers: the lady's countenance was the most expressive and strong that can be imagined. Their burletta manner, gave strong and neat con∣veyance
<PB N="174" REF="171"/>
to whatever they attempted. They drew a great deal of money; and indeed that luck was not to be wondered at. I have never seen such good <HI>comic</HI> dancers before or since.—Mr. Cooke, and Miss Hilliard, who were excellent as dancers in their way, were also continued. The dances were in such estimation as often to supply the want of a Farce.—The Fair was again revived that year, to introduce Mr. Madox, the famous man on the wire; who was in the year 1758 drowned on his passage to Ireland; as was Theophilus Cibber, and several performers.</P>
<P>Besides the dancers mentioned at Covent-Gar∣den that season, there were several good ones, above mediocrity; Monsieur Grandchamps, and Madame Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>argo.—Saturday, January the thirteenth, the Sorcerer was again produced, and continued, with almost equal effect, to the finish∣ing of the season.

<P>Mr. Barry was at that time in the prime of life, as to health and vigour; and Mrs. Cibber also at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er best. No wonder such a pair of lovers ob∣ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the triumph they were entitled to: Indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a pity they were ever separated; for no two persons were so calculated to assist each other by

voice, manner, and real feeling, as Mr. Barry, and Mrs. Cibber.</P>
<P>Mr. Smith's second part on the stage was Southampton, in the play of Essex.—Mrs. Cib∣ber's benefit that year was All for Love, with her neat little piece of the Oracle.</P>
<P>On Saturday, May 26, 1753, the season closed with Romeo and Juliet, by Mr. Barry, and Mrs. Cibber; which proved a separation of two lovers, doomed never—no, never to meet again!</P>
<P>I here publish a bill of that season, to shew how difficult it must have been to satisfy eager claim∣ants for being distinguished.—It occasioned much murmuring. Sometimes a lady took the lead, and her rival was bottomed; and the hero placed in the middle; but all would not do: And in the year 1757, the line of <HI>performed</HI> was obliterated, and the great letters for the principal were conti∣nued; which Mr. Kemble, for his own ease, and quiet of the theatre, has entirely banished.</P>

<P><PB N="178" REF="175"/>DRURY LANE, 1753-4.</P>
<P>Mrs. Cibber, at high terms, was engaged a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Drury Lane:—Her first appearance was in Mo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imia—Chamont, Mr. Garrick: Castalio, Mr. Ross; and it is certain in love characters Mrs. Cibber never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppeared to such advantage as when with Mr. Marry. Romeo a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Juliet was attractive when she and Mr. Garrick acted in those parts; but still in the love scenes she wanted her former Romeo. Mr. Garrick, indeed, in the scenes of fire, had the superiority; but as the lover, Barry was then, and is, unrivalled, and will be till such another starts up; but think I may prophecy that will not happen in my time, were I to double my years with renovated youth.—Indeed, let a thea∣trical historian look back, and he will not find an actor so excellent, as a lover, from the days of Bet∣terton, as Mr. Barry, to the present stage-strut hour.</P>
<P>Miss Macklin was then engaged, and (her mo∣ther from Covent Garden:) Miss M. at that time was a v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry fashionable actress, accomplished, and seemed to promise well; but having acquired a sufficiency, and grown tired of the profession, she retired several years ago from the stage, and died in some degree of affluence.</P>
<P>That season Virginia was produced in Febru∣ary—Mr. Garrick did Virginius; Mossop, Ap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us;
<PB N="179" REF="176"/>
Mrs. Cibber, Virginia; and Marcia was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t appearance of Mrs. Graham (the late Mrs. Yates) who afterwards stood forth as an honour to the British stage:—Her beautiful figure and merits are too well remembered to need enco∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m or repetition here. Mrs. Graham was not considered of much promise by Mr. Garrick, as s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was not retained:—But Mrs. Cibber's ill∣ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Mr. Murphy's incessant pains, with Mr. Gar∣rick's necessities from Mrs. Cibber's indisposition, was a lucky circumstance for that lady and the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>blic, and produced that charming and beautiful a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tress, who otherwise had pined unknown from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e first season, and never been more remembered, but, like a lily drooping, pined and died.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick wrote the following introductory lines for her in February 1754.<Q><L>If novelties can please, to night we've two—</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>English</HI> both, yet spare 'em as they're new—</L>

<L>She hopes some merit to deserve such friends.</L></Q></P>
<P>Creusa was produced that season with a double epilogue—the one by Mrs. Pritchard, the other by Miss Haughton; the Knights, by Mr. Foote; and Fortunatus, a very pleasing pantomime, by Mr. Woodward—Madame Marriot was the Colom∣bine <HI>that</HI> and for several seasons—a beautiful and pleasing figure.</P>
<P>COVENT GARDEN, 1753-4.</P>
<P>Mr. Barry having lost Mrs. Cibber as his Ju∣liet, lamented thus in his prologue:—<Q><L>In such sad plight what could poor Romeo do?</L>
<L>Why faith, like modern lovers, seek a new;</L>
<L>And happy shall I think me in my choice,</L>
<L>If she's approv'd of by the public voice.</L></Q></P>
<P>Miss Nossiter, on Wednesday, October 10, made her first appearance; she was not much more than the age of Juliet; was possessed of a hand∣some fortune and genteel education, strong sen∣sibility and feeling, and what added to the per∣formance, Romeo and Juliet were really in love, and well known to be so. She threw strokes in many passages that were not only genuine but forcible, and bad fair in time to supply the place of a Cibber;
<PB N="181" REF="178"/>
but notwithstanding the advantages of youth, and meeting wonderful encouragement, Nature had not endowed her with voice and powers sufficient for the arduous task to stand against her rival, and they appeared weakened, the more she was seen, in∣stead of gaining ground.—Indeed I think I never saw her play so well as the first season; neither was her voice musical, and her mouth was re∣markably wide, but she drew to all her characters. She acted Juliet a number of nights. Her se∣cond part was Belvidera, and in the mad scene did wonders from tuition, attention, and strong understanding: Rutland the third; and Philoclea, brought forward and wrote purposely to shew her to advantage by Macnamara Morgan.—Mr. Barry took infinite pains with Pyrocles; Mr. Smith did Musidorus; but the tragedy was a strange, lame, sick play, and with difficulty languished till the ninth day, when poor Philoclea died a natural death, and was not basely and cruelly murdered, as Mrs. Bellamy falsely and invidiously relates, as Mr. Smith can testify; for, on the contrary, the ap∣plause was so violent the first night of representa∣tion, and the Irish gentlemen's party so strong in its support, that Mrs. Bland was obliged to repeat a coarse epilogue, which was as coarsely spoken.</P>
<P>Constantine was also produced at Covent-Garden that year, and shared an unhappy fate.
<PB N="182" REF="179"/>
Miss Bellamy returned here from Drury Lane; but the relation in her book, relative to that matter, being far from authentic, for the sake of theatrical truth and history I give the following accounts: Thus far indeed she acknowledges, viz. <Q REND="inline">"The frequent mistakes which I find I have made in the chronology of my Theatrical Anecdotes, will, I hope, be imputed to my reciting them, as I have already observed, entirely from memory; and the deviation, I trust, will be excused by my readers, as the incidents themselves, though perhaps er∣roneous in point of time, are real facts. And was I now to set about co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>recting the error by an alteration of the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes, I fear, as many of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> happened at so distant a period, such a step would only be productive of greater m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stakes.<P>"I have received some corrections on this head from Mr. Wilkinson, manager of the York com∣pany, for which I acknowledge myself much obliged to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, though I cannot, for the reason just given, avail <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yself of them."</P></Q></P>
<P>As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate Wilkinson I here note, that Constantine was acted that season, and shared an unhappy fate. Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Bellamy's situation was, as she has de∣scribed, in Fluvia, TRUTH; but the play was acted to a fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e house on its first night of re∣presentation, and the third act received loud ap∣plauses, particularly from Barry's conclusion of it;
<PB N="183" REF="180"/>
he also received three plaudits from his manner of pronouncing these two lines in the prologue— <Q><L>Their heroes seem of a superior state,</L>
<L>Great in their virtues, in <HI>their vices</HI> GREAT.</L></Q>
After the third act it grew very languid, and the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtain dropped, with the audience more fatigued than enraged.</P>
<P>Miss Bellamy must have been determinably wrong as to her account of Constantine being damned the first night of representation: It was first acted on Saturday, February 23, 1754; also on the Monday and Tuesday following: The third <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght, as usual, for the benefit of the author; but the play was unfortunately so ill attended and dis∣approved, that it was again put up on Thursday, February 28, the fourth night, for the benefit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the author.—The following insertion was at the bottom of the bill:—.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P><HI>N. B.</HI> The receipt of last night not answer∣ing, Mr. Rich has taken it to himself.</P> <P>On Saturday next (by his Majesty's com∣mand) <LB/>VENICE PRESERVED.</P></Q> 
Which significantly insinuated Constantine was in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> decline. Had the play met a better fate, Miss Bel∣lamy's situation was such as must have precluded it
<PB N="184" REF="181"/>
some time, as that tragedy was with difficulty hur∣ried thro', the Empress Fulvia being brought to bed that very fourth night, and like a woman of spirit she appeared soon after in the penitent Jane Shore for her own benefit: Mr. Foote acted in the Knights that said evening, and gave an imitation of Mr. Garrick in the prologue, who had wrote and spoke that season the following lines:— <Q><L>I read no Greek, Sir—When I was at school</L>
<L>Terence wrote prologues—Terence was no fool.</L></Q>
Which lines Foote thus ridiculed, and in manner very like the Garrick, and with effect:—<Q><L>I read no Greek, Sir—When I was at school</L>
<L>The usher wrote prologues—the usher was no fool.</L></Q></P>
<P>Miss Bellamy mentions also the great expence Mr. Rich was at in reviving Busirus, which is a dream of her own invention, as Mr. Barry revived that play Monday, March 22, 1756, for his own benefit, two years LATER than her account, and was acted to a very indifferent house. The stage was built, but the seats were empty. Mr. Foote acted Hartop in the Knights that evening, to oblige and serve Mr Barry.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bellamy also relates, that on her return to Covent Garden, on her appearing in Juliet with Barry, that the tragedy had a run exceeding
<PB N="185" REF="182"/>
that of opposition 1750. It is so little connected with truth, and is so very erroneous, that on the contrary, when she returned to Covent Garden on the season's opening in the autumn 1754, Miss Nossiter was, as before-mentioned in my Memoirs, the Juliet; which character Miss Bel∣lamy at that time never had acted with Mr. Bar∣ry, nor ever did till so late as the 26th of Decem∣ber 1755. Her first appearance in 1753, on her return, was on Tuesday the 20th of November, in a very improper character; as was her second on Thursday, November 22 (her situation con∣sidered): She was thus announced in the bills, <Q REND="inline">"Athenais, by Miss Bellamy, her first appearance this stage these three years."</Q> After the chaste Athenais, the pure Monimia followed, which led to strange ideas that Castalio most certainly had been acquainted with that lady long before the third act. After that season (and not before it was necessary) she wisely changed the appellation of <HI>Miss</HI> to <HI>Mrs.</HI> Bellamy.</P>
<P>That lady's life being published, my own re∣marks, and intimacy with her as an acquaint∣ance, friend, and actress, will not, I hope, make the following genuine letters unexceptionable, as it draws as near to the finish of that once admired
<PB N="186" REF="183"/>
character as the feeling heart or eye would wish to penetrate.</P>

<P>I WROTE some months ago to thank you for your ham, but have had no answer. After having parted with my last guinea, and even my necessaries, to avert my present unpleasing residence, in order to obtain the rules, I was obliged to draw upon my son, and my lovely patroness, the Duchess of Devonshire, up to Michaelmas quarter. The impositions are in∣credible, as the people live by the distresses of others. I am obliged to give sixteen shillings a week for an apartment—a chandler's shop in front, backwards a carpenter's; and what with the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wing of boards, the screaming of three ill-natured brats, the sweet voice of the lady of the mansion, who is particularly vociferous with all the gossips who owe her a penny, with a coffee-mill which is often in use, and is as noisy as London-bridge when the tide is coming in, makes such unpleasing sounds, it is impossible to think of any thing; added to this, I have not a place for a servant. Could I raise sufficient

<P>I have the pleasure to inform you Mr. Wood∣ward gained his cause the twenty-fourth of last month; by which I have not got any thing but the credit of confuting Willet. If you read the Morning Chronicle of the fourth of August, you will find my letter to the Rev. Mr. Gaboll, which will explain the affair. I have wrote an answer to Willet's pamphlet, but am advised not to publish it till winter. I was in hopes to have been able to furnish an apartment, which would have enabled me to have lived cheap, and enjoy quiet, which is impossible in my pre∣sent residence: But nothing but disappointment and vexation attends me; nor can I settle to any thing of consequence where I am. I am greatly afraid I have some how offended Mr. — which would give me more pain, than his with∣drawing his assistance. In almost the certainty of money, I took a small house, and disposed of her

<P>You need not enforce my error; I am too sensible of it: For though the debts I have given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resh security for were such as would not have oppressed me, yet with the unexpected ideas I had

<P>When I parted from you at Doncaster, I ima∣gined, long before this, to have met with some oddities worth acquainting you with. It is grown a fashion of late to write lives:—I have now, and for a long time have had, leisure enough to undertake mine—but want materials for the latter part of it: For my existence now cannot properly be called living, but what the painters term <HI>still life;</HI> having, ever since February 13, been confined in this town gaol for a London debt.</P>
<P>As a hunted deer is always shunned by the happier herd, so am I deserted by the company<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Norwich Company.</NOTE>, my share taken off, and no support left me, save what my wife can spare me out of hers.</P>

my little garrison; but then it has been with the aid of my good friends and allies—my clothes—This week's eating finishes my last waistcoat; and next I must atone for my errors on bread and water.</P>
<P><HI>Themistocles</HI> had so many towns to furnish his table; and a whole city bore the charge of his meals. In some respects I am like him; for I am furnished by the labours of a multitude.—A wig has fed me two days—the trimmings of a waistcoat as long—a pair of velvet breeches paid my washer woman, and a ruffled shirt has found me in shaving.—My coats I swallowed by degrees: The sleeves I breakfasted upon for weeks—the body, skirts, &amp;c. served me for din∣ner two months.—My silk stockings have paid my lodgings, and two pair of new pumps ena∣bled me to smoke several pipes. It is incredi∣ble how my appetite (barometer like) rises in proportion as my necessities make their terrible advances. I here could say something droll about a good stomach; but it is ill jesting with edge tools, and I am sure that's the sharpest thing about me.—You may think I can have no sense of my condition, that while I am thus wretched, I should offer at ridicule: But, Sir, people constitutioned like me, with a dispropor∣tionate levity of spirits, are always most merry,

when they are most miserable; and quicken like the eyes of the consumptive; which are always brightest the nearer a patient approaches to dissolution.—However, Sir, to shew you I am not entirely lost to all reflection, I think myself poor enough to want a favour, and humble enough to ask it here.—Sir, I might make an encomium on your good-nature and humanity, &amp;c.—but I shall not pay so bad a compliment to your understanding, as to endeavour, by a parade of phrases, to win it over to my interest. If you could, any night at a concert, make a small collection for me, it might be a means of obtaining my li∣berty; and you well know, Sir, the first people of rank abroad will perform the most friendly offices for the sick: Be not, therefore, offended at the request of a poor (though a deservedly punished) debtor.</P>

<P>From this facetious letter of George Stevens's, and Mrs. Bellamy's latter account, we must re∣member in this stage-journal I was busily em∣ployed a few pages back, with an account of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> season 1753-4; where I still am supposing mysel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> giving an account, though I have been wandering on matters not relative thereto: But from Mrs.
<PB N="199" REF="196"/>
Bellamy, and the other personages mentioned of at that time, I must add, that Mrs. Gregory also made her first appearance on any stage, in the cha∣racter of Hermione, Thursday, January 10, 1754. It was falsely reported, that Mr. Barry refused playing Orestes, fearing her success should inter∣fere with Miss Nossiter's.—The story gained such credit, that he judged it necessary to publish an ad∣vertisement in all the papers, contradicting the malicious propagation. That lady grew into the highest fashion afterwards at the Dublin theatre: She married a gentleman bred to the bar in Ire∣land; a Mr. Fitzhenry, a gentleman of family and abilities; and took leave of the public at Dublin, within these four or five seasons; having wisely provided, from her gains on the stage, to live decently and comfortably off.—After all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he storms of a theatrical life, I ever cast a wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hful eye, whenever I read success accompanied with such comfortable finishings.</P>
<P>This was the first winter also for Italian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at Covent-Garden theatre.—Signora Ni∣colina (better known and remembered from the character of Spilletta, which she inimitably per∣formed, in the opera of Gli Amanti Gelosi) wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> particularly admired in the Italian song <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the hat, which some years since has been translated, introduced, and sung by Diana, in the pleasing
<PB N="200" REF="197"/>
opera of Lionel and Clarissa. The burlettas that year brought Mr. Rich a great deal of money.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick thus alludes to their success:<Q><L>I, as your cat'rer, would provide you dishes,</L>
<L>Dress'd to your palates, season'd to your wishes—</L>
<L>Say but you're tir'd with boil'd and roast at home,</L>
<L>We too can send for <HI>niceties</HI> from Rome:</L>
<L>To please your taste will spare not pains nor money,</L>
<L>Discard <HI>Sirloins,</HI> and get you <HI>Maccaroni.</HI></L>
<L>Whate'er new <HI>Gusto</HI> for a time may reign,</L>
<L>Shakspeare and beef will have their turn again.</L></Q></P>
<P>The season again closed at Covent-Garden, Wednesday, the twenty-second of May, with Ro∣meo and Juliet, and Harlequin Sorcerer.</P>
<P>Mr. Shuter had quitted Drury-Lane for Co∣vent-Garden; where he grew weekly, ay nightly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, favour with the public. Mrs. Bland was become Mrs. Hamilton.—It is very strange, but true, that Shuter was only looked upon as a young man of tolerable merit at Drury-Lane, (the Old Man, in Lethe, his principal part)—but at Co∣vent-Garden he seemed a sudden blaze of light.—This certainly must be allowed an instance, that, with genius, opportunity is every thing; but the misfortune is, without talents and genius, actor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will be cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ming the same right of ascending th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

throne of merit; but the ladder suddenly breaks, and down drops Dido.</P>
<P>DRURY-LANE, 1754-5.</P>
<P>The company remained much as the year be∣fore. Mr. Garrick was truly inimitable in Don John.—Mrs. Clive was equal in the Mother. Mr. Yates in the old whimsical character of Don Antonio—and the whole comedy was supported, as it might be wished every play should be.</P>
<P>Barbarossa was produced that year, and was much followed.—The Chances, revived and al∣tered by Mr. Garrick, at the command of his late Majesty, had a great run;—and Coriolanus was g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t up; in which character Mr. Mossop raised his reputation. Mr. Garrick was a quick gene∣ral, and it is most probable Mr. Mossop would not have had the luck of that play being produced at such expence, but that Mr. Garrick was eager to get the start of the rival theatre, where it was prepa∣ring with infinite pomp and splendour. The very idea of a triumphal procession at Covent-Garden, struck terror to the whole host of Drury, howe∣ver big they looked and strutted on common oc∣casions.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="199"/>
The Sabatinis were engaged this year at a great expence, as dancers. They appeared in two new Ballads, the one called the Pandours, the other, the Italian Fishermen; but they were both utterly disapproved, and did not appear six nights during the whole winter.—The Drummer also was re∣vived; and tolerably well received and followed.</P>
<P>The Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ries, an opera, from Shakspeare's Mid∣summer Night's Dream, was that year introduced. It was well performed, and with good success; aided not a little by an excellent prologue, and as excellently spoken by Mr. Garrick.—Giordani and Passerini were of great additional service, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lysander and Hermia.</P>

<P>Barry was invited to Dublin, on a salary of 800l. and two benefits. Mr. Victor and Mr. Sowden,
<PB N="203" REF="200"/>
were the desperate undertakers after Sheridan's abdication.—Miss Nossiter, (Mr. Barry's favourite Juliet) made a point of having five hundred pounds; and Mrs. Gregory (who had only appeared in two characters the winter before, at Covent-Garden; once in Hermione, and in Alicia twice; once for Mr. Sparks, and another night for Mrs. Bellamy), at three hundred pounds.—Barry on his departure from England denounced ruin on Mr. Rich by his desertion; but such threats were weak in the extreme: It is true, Mr. Sheridan's Romeo was vain and ridiculous, immediately af∣ter Barry's; but Barry forgot that with the aid and n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>velty of new performers, and Mr. Rich's never∣failing support, pantomime, and with a theatre in London, (where the metropolis can pour in such incredible numbers) it must be the manager's own fault indeed, if he be ruined by the loss of any per∣former whatever.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan, by the great riot in Dublin, be∣ing obliged to leave that city, occasioned by the representation of Mahomet in February 1754; in which perturbation Mrs. Woffington was suppo∣sed to have aided, as a party concerned in <HI>real</HI> state politics, which certainly has not any con∣nection or business within the walls of a theatre, that lady was also obliged to retire from Ireland, at the same time, with Mr. Sheridan.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="201"/>
It is one of the most remarkable riots that ever occurred in any theatre, and well worthy of being read by every admirer of theatrical history. It would be impertinent to introduce it here, as it must be well known, or should be, to all theatrical persons. Those who have not been made ac∣quainted with that period of the early part of the established Irish stage, will find it all fully ex∣plained in a modern volume lately printed, by Mr. Hitchcock; a gentleman of great ability and integrity of the Dublin theatre:—It gives a general view of the Irish theatre, from its commencement, down to the year 1757, and will well repay the trouble of a little attention. I can answer, as for myself, that I often take Mr. Hitch∣cock's book up for information.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan this year came over, and was en∣gaged by Mr. Rich in the autumn 1754. The season opened with some of Mr. Rich's stock co∣medies, very ill acted indeed, and as dingily dressed.</P>
<P>October 11, 1754, Mrs. Green made her ap∣pearance from Dublin, in the character of Lappet; a good comic actress—much the best in chamber∣maids, Mrs. Heidelbergs, &amp;c. since the time of Mrs. Clive.</P>
<P>On Friday, October 18, 1754, Othello was announced, with an occasional prologue, spoke by Mrs. Hamilton, for the introducing Mr. Mur∣phy.
<PB N="205" REF="202"/>
(A gentleman well known and admired for his talents as an author, and many very respectable qualities; and often mentioned in the course of my Memoirs.) He was to appear in the difficult and dangerous part of Othello; rendered at that time more hazardous than the present, by the well known excellence of Mr. Barry in that cha∣racter. Mr. Murphy had many other reasons to be alarmed; as he had long waged his pen of war as author of the Gray's-Inn Journal, and had been the terror of poets, and the scourge of players.</P>
<P>The novelty held out was a charm irresistible to attend Covent-Garden theatre.—Mr. Murphy's judgment, then or now, would be absurd to call in question; and I hold that gentleman in true regard; but on the stage, he certainly wanted, what we behind the scenes call powers, &amp;c. <HI>for great effect.</HI></P>
<P>After that gentleman's novelty of three nights, on Tuesday, October the twenty-first, the Nonjuror was advertised.—Doctor Wolf, Mr. Cibber (his first appearance for four years); and Maria, Mrs. Woffington (her first appearance for three years); which drew a great house.—So favourite an actress, and so well acquainted with persons in higher life, will easily gain credit to my account. She was of course greatly received, and played that character as well as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could be played.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="203"/>
On Wednesday the 23d of October, Mr. She∣ridan made his first appearance in his esteemed character of Hamlet: Judicious without doubt; but when compared to the combined excellencies of a Garrick, and the pleasing powers of the win∣ning Barry, he was not by any means established from that night's performance as a darling of the London audience—Tho' in Dublin not any one performer whatever, even the Garrick, at that time would not have been universally crowned with lau∣rel, as to preference, or perhaps equality; but (as Mr. Macklin has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d) that opinion had been jerked into the Irish audience from his father Dr. She∣ridan the schoolmaster. He next appeared in Ri∣chard, without any remarkable applause till the dying scene, where he was equal to any actor, if not superior to any I had then, or have since seen, without the aid of a flounder-like flouncing, as the modern Richard's practice, to the great plea∣sure, approbation, and universal plaudits from the <HI>galleries.</HI> Till I broke my leg I was much at∣tached to that tumb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing exhibition and surprising feat-like agility.</P>
<P>In November, 1754, Phaedra and Hippolitus was revived:—Theseus, Sheridan; Hippolitus, Smith; Phaedra, Mrs. Woffington; and had not any farce ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, though a play consisting of five characters only. It was the custom on re∣vived
<PB N="207" REF="204"/>
plays, and invariable with new ones, not to have any entertainment for the first nine or twelve nights—it would have been judged disgraceful: nor did any play whatever intervene, unless from illness or an unforeseen cause. Phaedra had not any success that year. Indeed, though the poetry is elegant, it is too learned and too languid. The performers and audience seemed half asleep, and the candles burned dim, unless at the following passage; which, with the advantage of Mrs. Wof∣fington's figure and new dress, prepared them for the chace—<Q><L>Come, let us hunt the stag and chace the foaming boar▪</L>
<L>Come rouse up all the horrid monsters of the wood,</L>
<L>For there, even there Hippolitus will guard me.</L></Q> After which rouse all parties on and off the stage, as by mutual consent, unanimously returned to their evening's nap.</P>
<P>Mr. Moncrife's Appius was acted that season, on the same story of Virginia, produced the year before by the Rev. Mr. Crofts at Drury-Lane, but destitute of every comparative merit, either as to plot, incident, writing, or any other claim to preference, and as to acting lamentably deficient. One speech of Mr. Sheridan's (though I never saw the play but the first night out of the six i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="208" REF="205"/>
was acted) I never can forget, he delivered the fol∣lowing lines so energetic:—<Q><L>O! by the gods! I hunger for revenge,</L>
<L>I thirst, I thirst for blood—for blood of Appius.</L></Q></P>
<P>Coriolanus was revived with great pomp:—Mr. Sheridan conveyed a masterly knowledge of the character and his immortal author, old Shak∣speare. That play drew several houses; but his OEdipus, Romeo, Zanga, Lord Townly, Sir Charles Easy, Osmyn, &amp;c. did not bear equal credit. Italian burlettas were attempted by a new set of Italians, but met with very little attraction or applause:—The first was L'Arcadia in Brenta, on Monday the 18th of November 1754; the second, entitled, La Famiglia de Bertoldi. Mr. Murphy performed Jaffier only between his first appearance and the benefits in March, when he acted Archer, Young Bevil, Hamlet, Macbeth, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. Clarke made his first appearance that sea∣son in Osman in Zara, on Thursday the 30th of October; an actor that must be at this time well remembered by his brethren and the public, tho' his talents were not strong enough to let him live long after death.</P>
<P>A Mrs. Glen also made her appearance that year in Rutland, Monday, February 24, 1756.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am right as to the dates of the month, &amp;c. but Mr. Clarke and Mrs. Glen's appearances were in Octo∣ber, 1755; Mrs. Glen's in February, 1756.</NOTE>—
<PB N="209" REF="206"/>
That lady I can only remember being apt to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>its on the stage—Indeed strange fits off the stage, ladies and gentlemen are often subject to—I have sometimes been so affected myself.</P>
<P>Mr. Rich revived Orpheus and Eurydice, that season, Wednesday, January 29, which drew crowds, but not equal to the Sorcerer, nor held in great estimation. That pantomime has been tried twice or thrice since then, but without success.</P>
<P>Mr. Poitier (an excellent dancer indeed) wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> introduced that year, and greatly admired: He came from the Opera House at Paris; his first ap∣pearance was on Tuesday, Dec. 3, 1754.—I do not recollect any very particular incidents that season.—Mrs Bellamy revived Alzira for her benefit—Za∣mor, Mr. Murphy: and the season concluded on Thursday, May 22, with the Constant Couple; Sir Harry, of course, by Mrs. Woffington; the entertainment was Orpheus and Eurydice.</P>
<P>DRURY-LANE, 1755-6.</P>
<P>Mr. Mossop was this year enticed (partly ow∣ing to an affront mentioned in my Memoirs) over to Dublin, by Mr. Victor and Mr. Sowden, to play on shares and two benefits; where he only
<PB N="210" REF="207"/>
acted twenty-four nights, finding he could obtain more profit for himself by acting twenty than forty nights for his employers:—So in fact Mr. Mos∣sop's great drawings <HI>in,</HI> was on the other nights the inevitable occasion of great drawings <HI>out</HI> from the treasury of that theatre. Mr. Garrick, from the unexpected loss of Mossop, engaged Mr. Murphy to supply that bulwark the other's absence had oc∣casioned to give way. Mr. Murphy's first ap∣pearance was on Tuesday the 30th of September, 1756, in Osmyn in the Mourning Bride. Mr. Holland started forth in the month of October, (Monday the 13th, 1755) in the character of Oroonoko, supported by Mrs. Cibber in Imoinda. He was a shining ornament, and an honest, truly agreeable man, was universally beloved, but death snatched him in the bloom of life and improve∣ment, and deprived the stage of an actor of merit and a worthy character.—He was too apt to <HI>out-herod</HI> Herod—by which false judg∣ment (mistaking it for genuine fire) the big man∣ly voice became too often harsh and unpleasing. In consequence, when Powell came in view, (tho' a suckling) he soon threw Holland at a distance, by keeping within the bounds of Nature and <HI>true spirit.</HI> This sacrifice of sense and sound (which I glaringly gave way to for the sake of catching momentary applause) would be less practised than

it is, would we once consider, that the opinions of the principal leaders of fashion in every place will influence the million in a great measure, and by them will be allowed, followed, and adopted. The following lines on this subject were wrote on Holland:—<Q><LG>
<L>When GARRICK, by whatever motive led,</L>
<L>Fatal to taste, took travel in his head,</L>
<L>Griev'd, for I knew the players of the age,</L>
<L>Griev'd, I foresaw the ruin of the stage!</L>
<L>No more, said I, o'erleaping vulgar awe,</L>
<L>Shall Shakspeare terror raise, or pity draw.</L>
<L>Catching the spirit with the poet caught,</L>
<L>The very pith and marrow of his thought,</L>
<L>Our GARRICK acted as our Shakspeare wrote;</L>
<L>But now scarce understood without a note,</L>
<L>Of all his more than manly vigour gelt,</L>
<L><HI>Holland</HI> must rant and whine where GARRICK felt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, anxious for the widow'd stage, my mind</L>
<L>With much too perfect augury divin'd:</L>
<L><HI>Holland,</HI> poor man! in Hamlet makes appear</L>
<L>What cause, what mighty cause we had to fear.</L>
<L>But though no acting-merit he displays,</L>
<L>His modesty must sure deserve our praise;</L>
<L>Which, that the piece in all points should agree,</L>
<L>Desir'd that <HI>Hopkins</HI> might Ophelia be.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Athelstan was produced that year, written by Doctor Brown. Mr. Garrick did his very best to support it, and the play certainly had merit,
<PB N="212" REF="209"/>
and was well acted; but it never recovered the chilness of the spring, nor has ever taken root, budded or flowered, from that time to this.</P>
<P>The Winter's Tale, introduced with an excel∣lent prologue by Mr. Garrick, had a very consi∣derable run. Mrs. Cibber's neat simplicity in singing the song wrote by Mr. Garrick—
<Q><L>Come, come, my good shepherds, our flocks we must shear, &amp;c.</L></Q>
made little Perditta appear of the greatest conse∣quence.—It was well cast, and the performance justified Mr. Garrick's judgment in so ordering the characters. Catherine and Petrucio was altered into three acts on the same occasion: Petrucio, Mr. Woodward; Catherine, Mrs. Clive.—He threw her down on the exit of the second act, which had very near convinced the audience that Petrucio was not so lordly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s he assumed; for Mrs. Clive was s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enraged at her fall, that her talons, tongue, and passion, wer every expressive to the eyes of all beholders, and it was with the utmost difficulty Kate suppressed her indignation.—The first re∣presentation of these pieces was on the 21st of January 1756.</P>
<P>The Apprentice was introduced that year, Ja∣nuary, 2d by Mr. Murphy; who spoke a pro∣logue to that farce, which was afterwards inimi∣tably
<PB N="213" REF="210"/>
and constantly repeated by Mr. Woodward in the character of Dick, in which part he was excellent. The farce had a great run, and still continues in full effect, and ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill, while a cle∣ver spirited comedian like Mr. Lewis or Mr. Banister, jun. has the Apprentice intrusted to his care and guardianship.</P>
<P>The Tempest as an opera in three acts, with recitative, &amp;c. was introduced that season, with a paltry dialogue, as may be seen in the magazine, of Feb. 1756: Signora Curioni, an Italian singer, performed in it, but it was dreadfully heavy.—It went through with great labour eight nights, but not without the aid of the garland dance, well performed by sixty children, at the end of the se∣cond act, and the pantomine of Fortunatus, or the Genii, after that.</P>
<P>All's Well that Ends Well was revived—I imagine to please Woodward, who was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond of acting Parolies.—He revived that play at Dub∣lin, and also when last at Covent Garden; but I never remember any remarkable success or plea∣sure received from the representation of that play; though here and there, it must be confessed, there are scenes of merit, whimsicality, and genius: but it never will be like the master productions of Shakspeare, a standing dish or an alluring spec∣tacle to the public eye.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="211"/>
The Fair Quaker was also revived that winter, and was well acted, but the comedy of itself has not much sterling merit, and its humour and the characters are too coarse for the nice discrimination of the present age. However, Mr. Garrick made the play stand its ground from the good acting of Woodward, and Mr. Yates in Beau Mizen and Flip, and the parts in general not a little reinforced by the good and popular pieces the manager added as a support, and the new song of <Q REND="inline">"Hearts of oak are our ships,"</Q> by Mr. Beard.</P>
<P>The CHINESE FESTIVAL, at an immense ex∣pence, was produced on Saturday, November 8, 1755, <HI>(by command of his Majesty King George the Second).</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. I. page 73, for bill of the <HI>first</HI> night.</NOTE>—It was in the time of the war with France.—The multitude conceived it was pur∣posely got up by Mr. Garrick to introduce French∣men to eat up all the bread, the beef, and the pud∣ding from the Englishmen; and they were, by artful incendiaries, (which are never wanting to do evil) so inflamed, and the hydra-headed monster was so powerful, as not to let the presence even of ma∣jesty secure a decent representation: It was again attempted, and strongly supported, on Wednesday, Nov. 12, after the comedy of the Inconstant; but the fatal night of the Great Riot, and entire over∣throw of the FESTIVAL, was on the <HI>Tuesday</HI> follow∣ing
<PB N="215" REF="212"/>
Nov. 18.—Essex was the play that night, the Earl by Mr. Murphy:—The nobility mustered all their forces, drawn swords, &amp;c.; but the <HI>mobility,</HI> against reason and their own rational entertainment, like a torrent bore down all before them; Mr. Gar∣rick's house had nearly been torn to pieces; infinite mischief was done the theatre; and John Bull was exulting with triumph. Some nights after Mr. Gar∣rick advertised his performance in Archer, when, on his entrance, something murmured like—Pardon! pardon! on which he advanced with great respect, and as great firmness, explained how ill he had been treated by the wanton and malignant con∣duct of wicked individuals, both in his property, fame, and character.—He acknowledged all fa∣vours received, but unless he was that night per∣mitted to perform his duty to the best of his abi∣lities, he was above want, superior to insult, and would never, <HI>never</HI> appear on the stage again.—While he was speaking all tumult ceased:—It was indeed a calm after a storm:—They seemed so struck with the truth which he asserted and ad∣dressed to them, the propriety of his conduct, and the injury from illiberality and wicked wantonness he had actually sustained, that from the idea of censuring Mr. Garrick unmeritedly, they felt the reproach deservedly on themselves, and, like true-hearted Britons, burst into such an universal accord∣ing
<PB N="216" REF="213"/>
applause, as for several minutes shook the fabric of Old Drury.—Harmony was settled before and behind the curtain to the mutual gain and credit of all parties, as Mr. Garrick after that for years en∣joyed deservedly the well-earned smiles and un∣bounded favours of the public; and that pub∣lic in return had the happiness of seeing him in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onstant round of characters three times in the week on an average—the first actor that ever did so variously and excellently perform such a con∣trast of capital chara ters, who but for this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ucky accident, perhaps might have been lost, to the great regret of his admirers, who never did, or will, take him for all in all, lock upon his like again.—Wherever there are many enemies, there will always be merit to create such envy.</P>
<P>The particulars of the riot, relative to the Chi∣nese Festival, may be seen in Mr Victor's second volume, page. 131 to 135.</P>
<P>I do not remember any other remarkable oc∣currence that year at Drury Lane theatre, except that on Saturday, March 27, Mr. Garrick gave his first performance of Lord Chalkstone (for Mrs. Clive's benefit), which had a great run, and kept the house open later than usual. The season concluded with Mr. Garrick's Benedick and Lethe.</P>

COVENT-GARDEN, 1755-6.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan's success at Covent-Garden the preceding winter, (where he had not taken any benefit-night) did not occasion inducement from Mr. Rich to propose, or Mr. Sheridan to offer, his services.—Mr. Barry returned from Ireland, after the harvest of a well-fought field—and in his hand, Miss Nossiter. Mrs. Bellamy, then in re∣putation as an actress, continued still with Mr. Rich—also Mrs. Woffington.—She and Bellamy were imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acable enemies.—Negotiations were off and on between Barry and Rich, till Novem∣ber, before any thing definitive occurred; and Mr. Rich, as usual, went dreaming on with Vol∣pone, Way of the World, Country Lasses, &amp;c. while Drury-Lane seemed as secure as if only one theatre was permitted in the capital of London.—However, on Wednesday, November the twelfth, Mr. Barry acted Hamlet, to a numerous audi∣ence, and was deservedly received with rapture.—But the loss sustained by Mrs. Vincent being the Ophelia, (a useful, but an affected actress) in lieu of Mrs. Cibber, made a woeful comparative play to that of Mr. Garrick's at Drury-Lane, with Ostrick, Mr. Woodward, and Ophelia and the Queen, by Mrs. Cibber and Mrs. Pritchard. In∣deed,
<PB N="219" REF="216"/>
the only person of sterling abilities, I can re∣member, in that highly finished character of Ophe∣ha, since Mrs. Cibber, is Mrs. S. Kemble. That lady has infinite merit in a variety of playing; but where the artless, the feeling, and the impressive, to reach the soul is requisite, she, need not in such departments fear the most Critical Review; for her natural representations must live on stage record, and may fearless bid defiance to satire or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>—If Sterne's Maria was properly intro∣duced (as an opera character) I think it would prove lucky for the author to have Mrs. S. Kem∣ble for her representative.</P>
<P>Mr. Barry, on the Friday following his Hamlet, acted Jaffier; and strange to relate, with so won∣derful and so deserved a favourite, and in a cha∣racter where he was so truly excellent, there actu∣ally were only twenty persons in the upper gallery; a bad pit, (and I may suppose many orders) and only two ladies in the side-boxes on one hand, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot three gentlemen on the other side. However, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he season on the whole was great, as was Mr. Barry's success; though I now recollect his acting Henry the Fifth, Wednesday, December the third, (where his performance was enchanting) to much the same kind of house as I have mentioned to his Jaffier.</P>
<P>Miss Nossiter did not make her appearance till
<PB N="220" REF="217"/>
late in the season; on Friday, December the twelfth, in the character of Monimia, which she performed to a crowded audience. Barry acted Cas∣talio, so excellently, that he was the only one I wish to remember.—Some aspiring youth will smilingly observe, that when folks grow ancient they pronounce excellencies, and paint beauties of their <HI>old</HI> favorites which never existed, because those of the present day cannot contradict them; but I have proved myself far from being insensible of the high merits of the present race of performers, in many instances; and wish not, because I praise <HI>Barry's Castalio,</HI> to see him, were he now living, in the <HI>Count of Narbonne;</HI> as Mr. Kemble there is himself <HI>alone,</HI> and shews <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw, and pleasing those that eye him."</Q></P>
<P>Alexander was revived with very great pomp, of which Mrs. Bellamy's books give a very full account, and also of her quarrel with Woffington.—It drew crowded audien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es for many nights; was first acted on Thursday, January the fifteenth; where Barry really appeared himself the leading God.—</P>
<P>King Lear was revived also that year; in which he was highly received: and a critic pronounced, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To Barry they gave loud huzzas,"—"To Garrick only tears."—</Q></P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="218"/>
Barry, in the pathetic scenes, had infinite me∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, and acted all well.—But the character, taken in general, was never seen, in my opinion, truly depicted with that fire, neatness, energy, quick∣ness, and every various requisite, as by the inimi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able Garrick. In tragedy, King Lear was his master-piece, (his Macbeth excepted.)</P>
<P>Italian Burlettas were tried a third season, but did not meet with success after the first year.—They had then the same set of comic s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers, viz. Signora Nicolina, <HI>(alias</HI> Spiletta) her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp;c. as the two years preceding. Spiletta drew money it must be granted; but her first year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been universally allowed the inimitable, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rming, the expressive SHE. Be it observed, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rlettas had not been introduced at the King's Theatre in the Hay-Market; the entertainments co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sisted only of the serious opera, and the grand da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ng; not any comic performers whatever, ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her as singers or dancers.—The first comic opera, was on Monday the 12th of January, La Co∣mediante Fatta Cantatrice; the second, (and the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>) was Gli Amanti Gelosi.</P>
<P>Mr Foote, on Tuesday, February the second, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter the play of Lady Jane Gray—(Lady Jane, Mrs. Woffington) produced his new farce of the Englishman returned from Paris.—It was well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed; was much followed; and filed the pockets
<PB N="222" REF="219"/>
of manager and performer.—Mr. Rich did so well with Barry, Foote, and the revived plays, that he had less dependence on pantomime that season than usual. Mr. Foote shared the nights of his farce as Author and Actor. He performed Sir Charles Buck, and acted Sir Paul Pliant, in the Double Dealer, and other characters to help his farce.—His benefit, as the author of the English∣man Returned, was on the 8th of March Ham∣let was the play—Hamlet, Mr. Barry;—Queen, Mrs. Woffington;—Polonius, Mr. Foote;—and was by every one thought a man of talents, but a very bad statesman. He was so convinced of his error, that the day before his benefit he resigned his place at court; and Mr. Arthur was his substi∣tute for Lord Chamberlain.</P>
<P>Mr. Barry's benefit that year was on Monday, March the 22;—Busiris; with the Knights:—Hartop, Mr. Foote.—Mrs. Woffington's was Ulysses; and the Frenchified Lady. Mr. Smith, on Saturday, April 3, again chose the Siege of Damascus, and acted Abudah.—That performer was known then and now by the appellation of <HI>Gentleman</HI> Smith, from that upright conduct with which he set forward, and has stedfastly walked in the same path to this day; by which perseverance he has reached the snug retreat of content: He was at that time rising rapidly into fame as an actor;
<PB N="223" REF="220"/>
therefore possessed a double claim to applause and encouragement. He had supported most of Mr. Barry's characters the winter preceding; and his long continued good reception and deservings are so well known, that my panegyric would be futile and impertinent.</P>
<P>Wednesday, May 26, 1756, the season con∣cluded with the usual old bill of fare—Woffing∣ton's Sir Harry; and Orpheus.</P>
<P>DRURY-LANE, 1756-7.</P>
<P>Mr. Mossop returned to his allegiance, and Mr. Sheridan was reinstated in his Irish government; not without numerous spies, and lurking enemies; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Barry and Mossop, on their trips, during his absence, had infused different seeds of discord, which rankled and kept up the smothered flames of party, and ended in mutual ruin: For (as mentioned in my Memoirs) Sheridan was defeated, and obliged for a time to seek refuge in England.</P>
<P>Barry at Covent-Garden, was sinking for want of variety of characters; he playing only in tra∣gedy: (Young Bevil, and Lord Townly ex∣cepted.) And though he may be equalled in judg∣ment, or inferior to some performers in 1790; yet his voice and countenance can neither be pur∣chased, surpassed, nor acquired, <HI>for the lovers.</HI>—Garrick being reinforced with Mossop, gave his
<PB N="224" REF="221"/>
company the undoubted superiority; and the little tyrant—<Q><L>"Look'd, spoke, fought, and was himself a war."</L></Q></P>
<P>Barry's novelty, was worn out in some degree, and though a darling of the public's, (and next to impossible he should be otherwise) yet Garrick carried all before him.</P>
<P>Harlequin Proteus, or Harlequin in China, was the pantomime of that year.</P>
<P>Miss Pritchard's promised appearance, 1756, caused much conversation and expectation this season; her features fixed the eye of every beholder off the stage, the face was so exquisitely handsome. She was not much older than a young lady <HI>now</HI> a candidate for stage favour 1790: I mean Miss Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s. Her public merits, cannot, with any pr priety, be here introduced; as it would be out o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all ti e and place, and subversive to the plan I have adopted and observed relative to others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the present publication. Yet I cannot refrain, for the credit of the stag, to be her herald; and with th trumpet of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound forth, that her purity and good conduct may challenge the breath of Slander, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nvy, or Detraction; and her undenia∣bly good character is such, that the more it is investigate—<Q><L>Like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in open air,</L>

<P><PB N="225" REF="222"/>
Mr. Garrick's Lear seemed to have gained addi∣tional strength, lustre, and fashion.—Mr. Shuter had the year preceding, revived the Wonder<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at Covent-Garden theatre, for his benefit, which became in consequence a stock comedy. Gibby, by Mr. Shuter; who was there the leading cha∣r <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.—Don Felix, the hero, was execrably per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated by a Mr. Gibson. Mr. Garrick revived r eal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in the season, Saturday, Nov. 6, 1756; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the play was so well conducted, (Gibby ex∣cepted, by Johnson, who could speak the dialect, but not act) that the play was perpetually called f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and relished as a perfect performance, parti∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly Mr. Garrick's Don Felix; and it was equ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ly attractive every year, when he performed that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aracte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, (which had never before been no∣ticed in the list of <HI>capital</HI> parts.)

<P><PB N="226" REF="223"/>
The Male Coquette (written by Garrick) was also well received. The Reprisal, and Proteus, or Harlequin in China, (by Woodward) were both well approved, but not very attractive.</P>
<P>Miss Pritchard's was a most remarkable first ap∣pearance, Saturday, Oct. 9, 1756:—The partiality for her mother, from the most respectable and in∣dulgent audience in the world, Mr. Garrick's patro∣nage and tuition, and her own beautiful face, which was fascinating to a degree, occasioned curiosity in shoals.—The mother, (Mrs. Pritchard,) lead∣ing her daughter on in Juliet, as <HI>Lady Capulet</HI>—the tears of the young lady—the good wishes and tenderness of the town, all combined, made an affecting and pleasing scene.—But that partiality dwindled away in the early part of the season.</P>
<P>Her second appearance was on the 25th of Octo∣ber, 1756, in the character of Lady Betty Mo∣dish, where Mrs. Pritchard had been often seen, and was incomparable, in spite of person;—but the daughter wanted the mother's soul, her feeling, her fire, her whim, her imagination: which here plainly shews, that teaching and teaching will never do, unless Providence has given genius and nature to be moulded.—In that case the master may justly claim credit, and perhaps more than is his due; but without that precious gift, <HI>talents,</HI> which must come from the universal Ma¦ker
<PB N="227" REF="224"/>
alone, no master can bring a pupil, (however learned) beyond a dull languid mediocrity, to public view with eclat.</P>
<P>I do not recollect more particulars that year, except Mr. Foote's producing the Author, which had a great run indeed; not only from the good acting of Mr. Foote, in Cadwallader, (the out∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of which character he had taken from a pri∣vate family) in which he gave great proof of hu∣mour, satire, &amp;c. but from Mrs. Clive being not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ver in Mrs. Cadwallader. The piece had great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ss: And wherever it is perfectly acted, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e parts of Mr. and Mrs Cadwallader are done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to in the performance, that farce will ever be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and of entertainment to all who are susceptible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>true comic <HI>force.</HI>—It is not so local and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as many of Mr. Foote's pieces; but is so near Nature, (though extravagantly drawn) that the piece whenever done justice to, and a favourite actor and actress in the two parts, it will live on the stage for an age to come.</P>
<P>Near this period, or indeed, two years later, the stage was favoured with a new candidate for fame; the eldest son of the late Mr. Fleetwood, formerly proprietor of Drury-Lane theatre.—His person was elegant and handsome: To his under∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tanding and education he also possessed intrepidity with coolness; and never, on any occasion, was
<PB N="228" REF="225"/>
thrown off his guard, so as for any opponent whatever to look or speak to him but as a gentle∣man.—This was of infinite service to Mr. Fleet∣wood as a billiard player; at which amusement, he was by all allowed so excellent, that few would venture to hazard with him.—His well-known abilities were so highly rated by all who knew him, that great expectations were formed of his stage success. He performed Romeo, at Drury-Lane, 1758, as I recollect, on his first appearance; and had a grace and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase, that seemed not only to ob∣tain, but command applause: Yet with all these advantage, his voice seemed consumptive, and his powers deficient, and the more he played, the less he pleased either the audience or himself, except in Young Bevil: however, tho' little accustomed to the stage, there was an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase, accompanied with elegance and native dignity in his deportment, that, take it from the first rising of the curtain to its f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, he displayed more merit, and gentleman∣like judgment, than any first rate performer I either had at that time seen, or since, in that difficult first rate, and accomplished character.—Being ambitious, and of strong discernment, he soon found the <HI>drama</HI> would not answer in that style of lucrative superiority, at which he only aimed; he therefore in less than two years' experiment of stage enterprise, retired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the theatre, and engaged, (I have been informed) in an underta∣king

in the West-Indies, where he has rapidly made a considerable fortune, and is, I believe, at this time living in that climate, enjoying the fruits of ingenuity and industry; points, which con∣joined, seldom fail eing the reward of talents and strong genius.—The Ambitious Step Mo∣ther was revived for him at Drury-Lane, in 1758, to perform Artaxerxes, but without approbation.</P>
<P>Not having collected this work from notes, but merely from memory, Mr. Fleetwood had not occurred to my remembrance, but from hav∣ing lately seen a ridiculous situation on the stage at the York <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heatre, from beholding Romeo's hav∣ing a real sword, instead of a foil, to grace his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>gh.

Ano∣ther instance, was when Mr. Fleetwood, just men∣tioned, was acting Romeo, at Drury-Lane: He had forgot his foil; Mr. Austin was the Paris, and not knowing his danger, was determined to be courageous, and fought like a lion; till Mr. Romeo, who fenced well and elegantly, being de∣termined to conquer, (in reality) whipped Mr. Austin through the guts <HI>sans ceremonie:</HI> Swords were <HI>then</HI> prohibited in consequence, and a severe penalty inflicted for wearing one on any account. Accidents of that sort were more likely then to happen than at present; as not any gentleman of the <HI>London</HI> theatres, when dressed, was ever seen without a sword by his side.</P>
<P>A misfortune of a similar kind to that lately mentioned, is that of the late celebrated Mr. Far∣quhar, who after being on the stage as an actor, ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ained a commission in the army, in which situation he wrote several well known and enter∣taining comedies; the Beaux Stratagem, Con∣stant Couple, the Recruiting Officer, and several others, which at that time, and the present, are in deserved high estimation: but an unlucky acci∣dent, in the year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>697, put a period to his per∣forming.—Being to play Guyamor, in the In∣dian Emperor, who kills Vasquez; and having
<PB N="231" REF="228"/>
forgot to change his sword for a foil, he wounded a Mr. Price, who acted Vasquez, dangerously, though not fatally. The impression which this accident made on a mind so sensible, and the re∣flecting on what might have been the consequen∣ces, determined him to relinquish a profession, which might, perhaps, expose him to like mistakes in future.—I have merely introduced this matter here, for every performer seriously to consider, that it is no reason, but that what has not yet befallen him, may, unhappily, at some future period, en∣sue; and not trusting to the hazard, is a certain preventive to the danger.</P>
<P>From the peril of swords, <HI>permit</HI> me to return to my stage calendar, and relate, that Miss Bar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n (now Mrs. Abington)'s first appearance at Drury-Lane, was on Friday, the twenty-ninth of October, 1756, in Lady Pliant.—Sir Paul Pliant, Mr. Foote.—Her second appearance was on the third night of the Wonder, in the Vir∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Unmasked.—Lilliput, a Satire, written by Mr. Garrick, was excellently acted by children: And the season concluded with Mr. Garrick's performance of Lord Chalkstone.—After the play of Essex, Mrs. Pritchard's Queen Elizabeth, (from indisposition) was read by Mrs. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>net (now living.) That night was appropriated for
<PB N="232" REF="229"/>
the benefit of a Mrs. Horton, a celebrated actress, for some seasons after the decease of Mrs. Old∣field; but I am sorry to relate, though it was on a charitable occasion, and Mr. Garrick aided the performance with his powerful assistance, that neither first nor half price gave any appearance of help or spirit to support the once admired Mrs. Horton.—It was no more than <HI>sans box—sans pit—sans gallery—sans every thing.</HI>—</P>
<P>COVENT GARDEN, 1756-7.</P>
<P>This season opened rather languid.—Mr. Barry's Lear was not attractive.—Alexander did something. Nossiter was the Statira; as Bel∣lamy was ill, and had broke her arm. Woffington was on the decline; but she never neglected her business, tho' her health, spirits, and beauty, were visibly de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aying.—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wo plays of Beaumont and Fletcher's, (W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t without Money; and the Humorous Lieutenant) were revived at a great expence; they were well conducted and met with some success:—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Humourous Lieutenant was performed at the command of his pre∣sent Majesty, then Prince of Wales, on Fri∣day the 10th of December:—Also Mrs. Centlivre's comedy of the Rover was produced, and commanded by his Majesty—A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tered this year, 1790, by Mr. Kemble; which alterations
<PB N="233" REF="230"/>
were requisite: as in 1757, Ned Blunt actually undressed to his drawers.—The London Cuck∣olds was acted, (for the last time, I believe) on the lord mayor's day.—The Englishman re∣turned from Paris being published, (as was ever the custom in those days—not locked up as at pre∣sent, as if afraid to see the light) was acted, and stood its ground tolerably; assisted by Mr. Dyer, in Sir Charles Buck; Miss Nossiter the Lucinda. Bellamy did not play that season, except Almeria, for the benefit of Mr. Sparks, in March.—Mrs. Woffington that year acted Lothario and the Frenchified Lady for her own benefit.</P>
<P>That winter Mrs. Gregory's fame had increased <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o much in Ireland, that she ventured over to play on shares a few nights at Covent-Garden.—Her Calista did the most for her. She had great me∣rit, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much fire.—Her Hermione was in some scenes very capital.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gregory, (now Mrs. Fitzhenry) some years after, tried Drury-Lane boards, and was in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nded as a curb on Mrs. Yates. This was sus∣pected by Mrs. Yates's friends and the public, and Mrs. Fitzhenry's person stood no chance a∣gainst the beautiful Mrs. Yates's: The Irish gen∣tlemen were too sanguine—In consequence, a vio∣lent opposition took place; and Mrs. Fitzhenry, (notwithstanding her good character and great
<PB N="234" REF="231"/>
abilities) was severely and cruelly treated: A cir∣cumstance seldom happening from a London au∣dience.—But what will not spleen effect?—This had nearly proved of fatal consequence to her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame as an actress in Dublin; the ill report being <HI>tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bled</HI> to greet her return. But real worth, and the high esteem she was held in by the worthy, baffled her enemies—She was soon reinstated in her former enviable situation of public applause and private esteem; and for years her emoluments were such, as to make happy the remainder of her days by a laudable and well-earned independence; and she now lives beloved, and feels the rapture of daily testimonies of regard paid to her unfullied reputation.</P>
<P>Performers of the old and new school may here take a hint respe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting Mrs. <HI>Fitzhenry</HI>'s good and ill treatment, as it plainly shews how little the stability of the best audience is to be depended upon: For in my space of memory I do not re∣collect a more favourable reception than was that lady's in Hermione; and though of their own London planting, yet malevolence, party, and spleen, wished to cast her public merit and her private worth, <HI>like a loathsome weed, away.</HI> Hence we may gather and surmise, it is highly needful we should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urb our vanities, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or every one has more or less) so as to prevent the over-powering

our wits: For the <HI>entire</HI> reliance on pub∣lic favour, it is plainly evident, too much resembles trusting to what we judge the fast gripe of a strong s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ppery eel, which is vanished when we fondly imagine it is most secure. Audiences, I fear, re∣semble each other, in a more or less degree, all the world over; and have, like actors on the expanded stage of life, their different change of opinions, their caprices, and their contradictions. If that be really the case, and that they do not know their own minds, but are unsteady, patronize one year, and abandon the next, what a flaming <HI>pru∣dent</HI> beacon should it exhibit to theatrical reflection to warn against trusting too implicitly to public ap∣plause, or of depending too far on our fancied or real abilities, as too surely the breaths that raise can sink us; and we who hold the mirror should recollect, that in the wide world's drama the ring of fickle changes are wholly comprised in that established ever-running play called <HI>The Follies of a Day;</HI> wherein all act their parts with applause, approbation, disgrace, or sink into <HI>oblivion.</HI> The stage, with all its attractive brilliancies, which at a certain time of life renders it improving and be∣witching, (for in youth even its vexations are re∣conciled and connected with its pleasures yet in its highest meridian, had I a dozen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns, it would be the last profession I should advise or wish

Besides, good actors and actresses are not to be picked or gathered as easy as hops; for very good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es are much scarcer than pine apples:—Nor should a piece, condemned by one snarler, <HI>(as murdering his precious time)</HI> be admitted as a reason that others must think like him, and nei∣ther approve nor applaud because such a play or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arce is condemned, and labours unfortunately
<PB N="238" REF="235"/>
under the disapprobation of one or more over∣bearing and dissatisfied critic. And surely no great condescension even for the advantage o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> untwisting the features, if such flinty hearts were to yield, and sometimes approve and shew a benevolent face, as if actuated by <HI>charitable mo∣tives.</HI> I am aware (and sorry to say) that it is next to impossible to avoid creating enemies; and real judgment freely investigated, I fear, is more apt to err, and be warped in the wisest understand∣ings, than will be readily allowed or admitted as to matters of opinion. But my experience leads me to suggest, that it is enforcedly implanted in our natures to be swayed by our interests and par∣tial<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, our likings and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>likings, and too oft we know not why. As for my own part, I have frequently found it next to impossible, when per∣chance, on beholding t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o entire strangers boxing in the street, or two game cocks fighting, but that I, impulsively, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as it were, inconceivably, have felt a pity and a strong pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilection in favour of one in preference to the other.</P>
<P>Ruminating on theatric usage has, however, produced one good effect, and affords comfort to my peace of mind, when I consider that (after a toilsome task of thirty-three years hard duty in the theatric field, with many hair-breadth scapes) I have been inured and reconciled to the
<PB N="239" REF="236"/>
sufferings I have undergone from my fracture and severe illness, which threatened dissolution; as its consequences has relieved me from the <HI>constant</HI> stage acting before the period it would probably (with consistency) otherwise have happened: And now I rehearse <HI>solus,</HI> like Major Sturgeon, and cry, 
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is all over with me.—Farewell the plumed steeds and neighing troops, (as the black man in the play says) for, like the Roman <HI>Censurer,</HI> I shall retire to my <HI>Savine</HI> field and cultivate cab∣bages;"</Q> and can say with Foote— 
<Q><L>Not but there are who merit all my care,</L>
<L>Pleas'd to applaud, benevolent to spare.</L></Q>
And of such noble minds, (which are as nice in their judgments, as in their censures they are light and right) I of my audiences with truth can boast. Now like a truant (which I often was in my youth) and old boy like, I have stretch∣ed far beyond my bounds, and justly fear the rod of deserved correction due on coming back to my proper place, where I must, as in duty bound, repeat my task as well as I am able, and turn back from my fault of digression, to my account of the season at Covent Garden in 1756-7.</P>
<P>Mr. Barry, in the month of January, attempted to encounter with the difficult character of Ri∣chard

The story is simple, natural, and affecting, its language elegant and beautiful; and the lessons that may be observed from many passages are worthy the attention and retention of the learned, the gay, the giddy, and the wise.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. TO TATE WILKINSON, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE been reflecting this <HI>half hour</HI> (and let me tell you that half an hour is a great while for a woman to reflect) on the predomi∣nance of <HI>self-love:</HI>—The eloquence of De∣mosthenes, the orations of Cicero, would never have been known, had they not been actuated by this <HI>all-ruling principle.</HI> When the uncle of the younger Pliny fastened his pillows to his head and ascended the burning mountain, did he risque his life for <HI>curiosity</HI> alone?—No—the <HI>universal passion</HI> caused his death: And what is love of <HI>fame</HI> but <HI>self-love?</HI> When the be∣neficent man rescues merit from obscurity, or old age from the stings of poverty, what is his motive? Why, <HI>self-love</HI>—If he did not find his passions more fully gratified by <HI>dispensing</HI> ric es than by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oarding</HI> them, the beneficent man had been a miser.—Why did Cato fall on his sword while Utica was fr e? Did he die to save or serve his country? No:—But to submit to Caesar, or to death, was the humbling alterna∣tive—his pride chose the latter. When Vir∣gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius murd red his daughter, was it from his love of Virtue? No▪—his hatred of Appius, and his opposition to the Decemvirate power,
<PB N="245" REF="242"/>
were his darling passions. When pretty Miss confines the goldfinch, in an embellished cage, and feeds it with her own dainty hand, is it her love for the <HI>bird</HI> that prevails upon her to give herself this trouble? No: If she did not find her own amusements in its warblings, the <Q REND="inline">"happy commoner"</Q> would be left to seek its sustenance at large.</P>
<P>I think Shaftesbury, in his <HI>Moral Inquiry into Virtue,</HI> has almost proved that there is no virtue at all; that there is very little independ∣ent of <HI>self-gratification</HI>—And does not that de∣stroy its essence? I half believe, and till I see a miser part with his money, merely because it would make another happy, or a coquette cease to adorn her person, that her rival may for once have an opportunity of eclipsing her, I shall hardly be inclined to alter my opinion. And pray, Mrs. Baker, to <HI>what motive</HI> am I to at∣tribute young having favoured me with the crude indigested sentiments I have just received? Why to <HI>self-love</HI> to be sure: I like to hear myself talk; (writing whatever occurs to one's mind <HI>is</HI> but talking you know); the thoughts were natu∣rally produced by a chain of ideas with which they were connected. I am alone, and throw∣ing them on paper has diverted me:—Besides, I had a mind to let you see I am not quite such a trifler as my last might bespeak me; it began
<PB N="246" REF="243"/>
with a <HI>loud laugh,</HI> and ended with a <HI>poole at qua∣drille,</HI> if I am not mistaken, for I seldom <HI>read</HI> what I write—it is enough for other people to do that—Ay, and Heaven knows a great deal <HI>too much</HI> you say.—Thank you, Sir, that's gene∣rous—I love my friend should be candid with me.—The postman's tap—a letter from Lon∣don—one from Mr. Wilkinson.—I I kiss the seals.</P>

<P>I AM extremely glad I did not answer your last letter but one, because if I had, it would have deprived me of the satisfaction of knowing that my seeming neglect had vexed you; but it was occasioned by my going to Aberdeen, where I staid three weeks, saw a fine country, made se∣veral agreeable acquaintances, amongst whom were the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arl of Aberdeen, and the Governor of Fort Augustus,—<Q REND="inline">"though last not least,"</Q>—and brought home enough to make the pot boil.</P>

<P>I have had a very extraordinary letter from a
<PB N="248" REF="245"/>
cousin of mine, who keeps a shop about ten miles from London; where he sells every thing, has saved a good purse, bought land, and built houses. What could the odd soul mean by such a proposal! Perhaps he thought it would be doing his <HI>noble</HI> family an acceptable service if he transplanted one of its branches from the stage to the counter! But it will not do: I had rather be a primrose in the wilderness, than a polyanthus in a hot-bed. A counter is by no means my natural soil; though to be sure I might find some pretty amusements in his fa∣mily, and almost as many employments as Scrub had: I might scold the maids, dun the tenants, and serve in the shop. Do not you see me with Fontenelle in one hand, and a cheese-taster in the other? Then how comfort∣able to be seated on an excellent new pillion am∣bling to London in a holiday-week, buttoned up close in a warm Joseph, and upon arriving at a friend's house, pull off this dainty garment, let down my cherry-derry gown, (my cousin sells cherriderries) and my cambric apron, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> equipping myself with a cardinal three-quarters of a yard too long for the fashion, and a rich handsome black satin bonnet, be stuffed into the gallery at the playhouse, my own pockets replete with gingerbread, shrimps, and oranges▪ and my little husband's provided with a bott<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

of charming rum punch: If we can but get a front seat how delightfully will the time pass away till the play begins, surrounded by such substantial blessings. The honest man does not know what a favour I have done him in refu∣sing him. I suppose I shall have a few remon∣strances from some of my wise uncles and aunts, (for I can guess who put such a project into the man's head, I am sure it was not his own, for in the first place I know his ideas could never reach from Surry to Edinburgh, though all the cousins upon earth lived there; and besides this, he repeatedly assures me, <HI>that no mortal soul knows of his writing)</HI>; but they may say what they please, let me alone to answer them. Now you are grumbling at me for plaguing you with such nonsense; but what can I do? You will not give me a subject, and therefore you must be contented with such as I can find.—O! by the way—what took you to York?—You are horridly provoking, Mr. Wilkinson! but per∣haps I may find a way to be even with you.—Yet, hang it, men have not half the curiosity that women have; at least they say so. You see I have had patience a great while. Dowson is at Newcastle; he sent for the inimitable Rob∣son thither, and gave a very notable reason for so doing:—he could not live without her.

<P>Why do you get up Salisbury? It is a hor∣rid play—the Novel is worth fifty of it. Have you done Cymon?

<P>WHEN I thought that you had quite forgot us, behold I received a letter, and a letter of a very comic kind. Do you seriously believe that a man of my age and <HI>great gravity</HI> will turn pimp, and <HI>procure</HI> a young girl for exportation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Wilkinson had wrote to Mrs. Chaigneau to engage a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> actress.</NOTE>?

In short, I must shift you from friend to friend. I spoke to Mr. Alderman Forbes, (who is the Lord Mayor once more) and he sent his bell-man about, but he played me a devilish trick, for next morning I had four thousand one hun∣dred and eighteen wenches at my door, to the great terror of all my neighbours.

<P>BE assured it was very far from my inten∣tions to <HI>half</HI> vex you, or to give you the least reason to suspect that I imagined you wanted de∣licacy.

<P>You know my <HI>forcible</HI> characters as well as I do;—you know the taste of the public where you preside, and therefore make choice of plays and characters that seem most advantageous in your own judgment.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM sorry it is not in my power to comply with your request, to send you the corrections lately made in Hamlet; but no such favour can be granted to any one, as I presume the play will never be printed so altered, as the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are far from being universally approved; nay, in ge∣neral, greatly disliked by the million;—there∣fore,
<PB N="261" REF="258"/>
no doubt, your country 'squires would be for horsewhipping the actor that had struck out that natural scene of the grave-diggers.</P>
<P>As to alterations there are few or none, at least <HI>additions,</HI> which alone make material alterations. I can therefore tell you, the first act being remarkably long, great part of it is carried into the second:—and the sending Ham∣let to England, and the grave-digging scene, is by that means cut out; and the introducing the scene that has been long omitted, where Ham∣let intercepts the officer at the head of a party going to engage the enemy for a bit of land.—<HI>That</HI> scene restored, and the division of the first act, makes ample amends for what is cut out.</P>
<P>No doubt Hamlet's consenting to go to Eng∣land, and being prevented and brought back by a miracle, is altogether absurd, when his so∣lemn engagement with his father's ghost is duly considered.

<HEAD>LETTER IX. TO TATE WILKINSON, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR TATE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now a considerable time since I wrote to my good friend Sir John O'Carroll, and in∣formed him of all the misfortunes that have happened to my family, and requested that he would be so good to let you know of them. As I have received no answer, I am really very uneasy, particularly as I mentioned something that nearly concerned his interest: I must there∣fore request that you will inquire about it, and inform me.</P>
<P>I was in France near a year with my wife and Mrs. Forbes, whom I left at Montauban, and got home in June 1775. My poor ne∣phew Jack had been a long time ill, and was then at Mallow Waters. Alderman Forbes went to visit his wife in October last, but the ship was dashed to pieces in Wales, and he and many others were lost. In March last my dear Jack exchanged this life for a better, and was soon followed by his broken-hearted mother, and your good friend my poor brother Ache∣son. You may easily conceive the distraction of our family. My brother John has been much affected, and my niece Hannah is, I fear; in a dangerous situation from the immense fa∣tigue she had with her brother and mother.
<PB N="263" REF="260"/>
My dear sister Forbes, could not support her loss, and last June she followed her husband. This is too melancholy a subject to dwell on. I know you feel for us all. Mrs. Chaigneau and Mrs. Acheson, (who lives with me) and all the remainder of your old friends, desire to be remembered to you in the kindest manner, and believe me,</P>

<P>IF I had not a pretty shrewd knack at guess∣ing, it would not be quite so easy a matter to answer your favour from Hull.</P>
<P>You desire to know if I had commissioned Giordini to give a particular sum (but whether to a horse, a man, or a woman, does not ap∣pear) for this or the next summer.</P>
<P>Your old friend Shuter is locked up in the playhouse, and is soliciting a letter of licence from his creditors, in which number I find Jewel is included for ten guineas borrowed du∣ring the last season: Fye upon him! I am glad to hear that your affairs prosper. I have a piece of three acts, not my own, which I shall give

It is a parody of the best passages in the most favourite plays conveyed with great gravity in blank verse:—I think you will appear in it to advantage, and I shall be glad of your assistance. I cannot say I am quite so well as I had reason to expect: I thought myself obliged to give Barry a lift two critical nights, which injured me extremely; but I am now better, and, except the trifle of a leg, as much yours as ever,</P>

<P>I thank you for the florid beginning of your last letter but one, though I can neither admire the delicacy of the sentiment, nor subscribe to the truth of the observation. For Heaven's sake, why should not women be as desirous of sincere professions as men are? Or why should not even an indirect falsity, told to the former, be held as scandalous as it is acknowledged to be, when offered to the latter?—Would not that man be thought the veriest <HI>poltroon</HI> in nature, who should draw his sword upon one who had
<PB N="265" REF="262"/>
lost the use of his hands?—What then can we say of him, who by arguments equally <HI>specious</HI> and <HI>false,</HI> shall endeavour to impose upon a de∣fenceless <HI>woman,</HI> who has neither understanding enough to repel his attacks, nor a possibility of revenging them?—So much for <HI>sincerity,</HI> my dear Wilkinson: And be assured, I have at least sense enough to prefer it, (when it is attended neither by ill-nature nor rudeness) to all the re∣finements which the most subtile politeness (di∣vested of it) can dictate.</P>
<P>I have had a miserable cold, or I should have wrote to you <HI>before;</HI> do not grumble at this, for I am so horridly out of spirits, you may thank me for writing to you <HI>now.</HI>—Beatt has taken himself to his brother's in Fifeshire, and lives secured from duns, upon the fat of a lean land. The magnanimous Staley was left be∣hind us in Edinburgh; where he is employed in writing madrigals to his own praise: <HI>sad</HI> ones they are indeed!—Mr. — is gone to Aberdeen to paint miniatures, which the ori∣ginals may <HI>fancy</HI> copies of <HI>themselves;</HI> and Lan∣cashire draws beer opposite St. Mary's Wynd. So that you see our company is but thin; yet we have found our quarters here extremely good, indeed much better than could have been expected.—I am sorry to hear you are inclined

to gallop—depend upon it, my friend, you are got upon a sober demure beast, that will not bear to be pranced with; take care then how you put him out of his pace, for fear he should throw you out of the saddle.—I have no in∣clination to make this letter longer; take it therefore by way of <HI>bon bouche,</HI> you shall have a full meal presently.—The conclusion of a let∣ter often occasions more trouble than all the rest of it; therefore as I am vastly inclined to be idle, you must take for granted, all the esteem, regard, friendship, and affection, which are usu∣ally <HI>expressed,</HI> when you read the name of</P>

<P>You tell me if I come to York I must have many disagreeable things to encounter.

<P>Do you know that our correspondence begins to grow extremely critical?—The people here wonder what we can write about so constantly, and really make some remarks which are pretty enough.—Your last letter but one was directed to Glasgow, and returned to me from thence on the same day that I received your mad one—both at the playhouse too—then what an uproar! <Q REND="inline">"Good God, Mrs. Baker!

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>A Considerable mistake having taken place in this Work, my duty calls on me to explain it in this conclusive page:</P>
<P>It is relating to the <HI>rank</HI> I have affixed to the name of Thornton, and dubbing him Colonel of the <HI>Yorkshire Blues,</HI> where it was not right to do so. My being an entire stranger to the county of York, at the time I was honoured with the acquaintance of the gentleman alluded to, in my early pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe, gave rise to the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>regious blunder, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut tho' I have unfortunately lost my patron General St. Leger, who could have prevented my being so wrong, yet I am so lucky as to be set right by the favour of a letter, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> undoubted authenti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty, from a gentleman of rank and fortune, to whom I am highly indebted for his infinite politeness: it is as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO TATE WILKINSON, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I should be happy if I could give you the least assistance relative to the matter you have wrote to me about. I can only speak from me∣mory, and my then knowledge of the army.
<PB N="272" REF="269"/>
I was at that time at Portsmouth. Sir Robert Rich's regiment of dragoons, to which I then be∣longed, was all 1758 in Scotland, except the light troop, which marched into England on Thurot with his fleet appearing off our northern coast, and I marched with it, as Lieutenant, in Septem. 1758. I knew Capt. Anthony St. Leger, in the 3d, or King's own regiment of dragoons, who was then at Portsmouth with the light troop of that regiment. I am confident there then was not a colonel or lieutenant colonel Thornton belong∣ing the horse at Portsmouth, or in the English service at that time. If I recollect right there was only one field officer appointed to command the light troops upon the expedition that went out that summer against Cherbourg, which was Ma∣jor George Warde, of the 11th dragoons, now Lieutenant General Warde. In 1758 every re∣giment of heavy dragoons had a light troop be∣longing to it, which were detached corps in order to be sent upon those expeditions; so that each troop had only a captain, lieutenant, and cornet sent with it.</P>
<P>You are mistaken with regard to the rank of the gentleman you mention. There was at that time a <HI>Lieut. William Thornton</HI> of the 7th dragoons, who was there, and went upon the expedition; he was a man universally known and beloved by
<PB N="273" REF="270"/>
every body who knew him: He had lived much in the world, was very much of a gentleman, and very sensible, but was rather partial to his bottle.—I wish to be as particular as possible, as I think he was the person you mean. He was about thirty years of age, about five feet eight inches high, handsome face, and well made.—There was a circumstance happened upon that expedition. Captain Lindsay of the 11th dragoons was killed; and General Bligh, who commanded upon the expedition, and had power given him by his Majesty to fill all va∣cancies that should happen in the army, ap∣pointed <HI>Lieutenant William Thornton</HI> to a troop in the 10th dragoons, which he commanded till they returned to Portsmouth, where Lord New∣bottle, now Marquis of Lothian, came to com∣mand the troop, being appointed to it by his Majesty; the 10th dragoons being then his fa∣ther's, Lord Ancram's, regiment.—The cir∣cumstance was much talked of in the army, as Thornton would not return to his former regi∣ment or rank.—The latter end of that year we had in our regiment a captain who died, and Thornton was appointed captain in his room. Thornton died in London in 1765. I remember Captain St. Leger, (afterwards Major General St. Leger), was very intimate with Thornton.—
<PB N="274" REF="271"/>
