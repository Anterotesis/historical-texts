<P>THIS Piece, however singular it may ap∣pear, was actually written, and delivered to the Manager, long before any of the late Distur∣bances.</P>
<P>The flattering Reception which this little Opera, so trifling, and so temporary, has met with from the Public, must chiefly be attributed to the friendly Care and Attention of <HI>Mr. Coleman,</HI> and the exerted Abilities of all the Performers.</P>

<P><STAGE>(to some of the workmen who advance)</STAGE>
That's right, my boys, always sing while you work; a song, in my mind, makes labour easy, <HI>in spite of</HI> mine <HI>and his Majesty's enemies.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1<HI>st Workman.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So it had need, master Launch; for we have enough of it: these cursed French Monsieurs find us constant employment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Launch.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but the harder you are drove now, the faster we shall drive them by-and-by.—
<STAGE>(Bell rings)</STAGE>
Come, come, get to your dinners: I fancy your sto∣machs have struck twelve. You must recollect too, my lads, that you are hereby insuring the defence of your country against mine and his <HI>Majesty's enemies.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2<HI>d Workman.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Damn your and his Majesty's enemies—for my part I don't care a chip for 'em, and I dare say we shall give them such a welcome if they do come, as will make them wish they had staid in their own country—tho'f I'm told it's a bitter bad one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Launch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's the reason they are so desirous to visit ours. But lose no time, my lads; I expect our chief lord down every instant, and as he is a great friend to harmony, I beg we may have no discord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1<HI>st Work.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How can we help it, master Launch, when our wives are always complaining?—it's <HI>un∣possible</HI> to keep them in tune, for we hav'n't time to wind them up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Launch.</SPEAKER>
<P>But consider, I'm a man of consequence, principal store-keeper to his Majesty's yard, here at Portsmouth, and know all the King's secrets; and let me tell you, if the French should come, they'll take your wives away from you: think of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>1<HI>st Work.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why if that's all they'll take away, there's no such great matter; because why, we know the worst of it; and I am told as how the French are civil enough to every body's wives but their own.</P>
<STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> 1<HI>st Workman.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2<HI>d Workman.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, if that's the worst, there's no harm done; but damn 'em, I was afraid for my religion; I was afraid they would have taken away our religion and left us their own, and be damned to them.</P>

Come here, Nancy, you look gloomy, child. I hope you are not afraid of the French taking <HI>you</HI> away?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(advancing)</STAGE>
No, papa, I have no such fears, I assure you; but can you wonder at my being pensive, when one I hold so dear is now encount'ring the dangers of the sea, or the attacks of the enemy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Launch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you what, child; I'm a man of consequence, and I could wish you to think no more of that midshipman, that Frederick; so mark my words, I'm a man of consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear papa, what objection can you possibly have? Isn't he son to his worship the Mayor; and of equal consequence with ourselves?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Launch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why there now is one part of my objec∣tion—quaking, tottering, neighbour Tremor, equal to a man of my consequence, who am the King's Officer for life, and respected by all his Majesty's workmen! whereas the Mayor, as you call him, is only worshipped by vagrants, and loses his honour in a twelvemonth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Launch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, isn't he a republican tallow∣chandler, who sells candles to the mob, and forces us to light up for liberty? and am not I on the other side the question? and don't wish to have any hand in such stuff.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stuff, papa!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Launch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, child, kitchen-stuff, fit only for such fellows to deal in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But sure, sir, my Frederick is not to an∣swer for his father's folly; he is himself a slave to no party; and is he not bravely venturing his life in the service of his King?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Launch.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what would you think if he should return from that service with only half an eye, and a couple of wooden legs peeping through his pocket∣holes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nancy</SPEAKER>
<P>Why love him the better, for preferring his country's welfare to his own safety—What would the world say if the daughters of England withheld their tenderness from those who most deserved it?</P>
<LG TYPE="song">
<HEAD>SONG.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><HI>Sure 'twould make a dismal story,</HI></L>
<L><HI>If, when honour leads him on,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Love should slight the cause of glory,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Or disdain its wounded son.</HI></L>
</LG>

<L><HI>If, his country's rights defending,</HI></L>

</LG>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Launch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, child, I like your spirit; but you know I have somebody else in my eye, who agrees to every thing I say, and thinks just as I do about mine and his Majesty's enemies—my friend Ambuscade I mean, a man after my own heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>He may be after your heart, papa, but he's very opposite to mine—a capering, strutting, impu∣dent fencing master, always teizing one to death with scraps of old songs—I neither like his looks nor his manners—in short, sir, I wish you don't find him im∣pose upon you very materially.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Launch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impose upon me, child—a man of my consequence! Yes, I should like that amazingly—upon me, indeed, who have the care of his Majesty's Royal Dock, and know all the state secrets!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sir, and that I take it is the reason of his seeming attachment, that he may get some know∣ledge of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Launch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Get knowledge out of me! No, damn me, I defy him to get knowledge out of me!—nobody would ever imagine that I knew any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But let me beg of you to listen to my Fre∣derick; consider, sir, good men are scarce.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Launch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, learn to be content, girl—you have got one good man already for your father, hav'n't you? would you have a couple to your own share, you unconscionable baggage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear sir, you are entirely out of the ques∣tion; but isn't it very natural for a young girl to wish to be settled? and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Launch.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure it is, and so you shall; but the men have something else to think of now; the country's up in arms at present, therefore let me intreat you to keep your's quiet for a time.</P>

<SP>
<P>All's safe, I think—yes—Icod, this French invasion puts one into such a panic, that one hardly dare to peep one's head out—one's functions are all in a quake—scarce eat and drink as we used to do—not a feast in the town hall these two months—dripping will be very scarce. What noise is that!
<STAGE>(starts)</STAGE>
oh! nobody—then, as I'm his Right Worshipful the Mayor, the French would be very glad to catch me, no doubt; well, what a dangerous thing it is to be in power! I should certainly be thrown into the Bastile, they would take no ransom for such a precious captive—no—zounds! what noise is that?</P>

<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>In an open boat, sir; and just landed this instant.</P>

<P>Why, you hav'nt deserted from the ship's crew, have you? I hope you were not afraid, for I hate fear as much as I do the French; don't disgrace your family, Frederick; I hope you'll shine as much as your father has done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never doubt it, sir; I, like the rest of my countrymen, only wish the French would lay aside their running fights, and try a few broadsides with us; and we'll convince them an Englishman's heart, like his climate, though often overcast, will soon clear again, and shew the world a glorious day.</P>

<P>Dear me! dear me! and I shall be laid hold of first for being in power; and who knows but my very friends may turn against me—attacked in my own mansion house, I may be knocked down by my own mace-bearer, or run through the body with my-own sword of state.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be so alarm'd, sir; you should think of putting the place in a state of defence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I will—O gracious, what a situation! Well, I will put the town in a state of defence—Zounds! I'll embody the whole corporation—and, to encourage them, order them two gallons of porter with an allowance of bread and cheese, and a pint of wine for the officers.—Don't you think they will make a good stand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtless, sir, if you don't go to fisly-cuffs yourselves—you should never smite one another, be∣cause it gives the public an opportunity of having so many strokes at <HI>you.</HI></P>

<P>Ha! ha! ha! a good hit i'faith—but mum—you know we must not touch up the great, whate∣ver we think. However, if some folks above, had done some things below, why some things would not have been so middling.</P>

<P>O that fellow is a man of my own kidney, fire is his element; a perfect salamander.

<P>That will be a bright prospect, indeed! but have you secured the families in our interest, whose consciences you manage?</P>

<P>Well done, father, that was securing their <HI>interest,</HI> by encouraging their <HI>principle</HI>; but, could you not have prevail'd upon them to poison the bread? that would have done the business at once.</P>
