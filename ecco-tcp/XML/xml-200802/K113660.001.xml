<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are an hundred faults in this Thing, and an hundred things might be said to prove them beauties. But it is needless. A book may be amusing with numerous errors, or it may be very dull without a single absurdity. The hero of this piece unites in himself the three greatest characters upon earth; he is a priest, an husbandman, and the father of a family. He is drawn as ready to teach, and ready to obey, as simple in affluence, and majestic in adversity. In this age of opulence and refinement whom can such a character please? Such as are fond of high life, will turn with disdain from the simplicity of his country fire-side. Such as mistake ribaldry for humour, will find no wit in his harmless conversation; and such
<PB REF="3"/>
as have been taught to deride religion, will laugh at one whose chief stores of comfort are drawn from futurity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The description of the family of Wake∣field; in which a kindred likeness pre∣vails as well of minds as of persons.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> WAS ever of opinion, that the honest man who married and brought up a large family, did more service than he who continued sin∣gle, and only talked of population. From this motive, I had scarce taken orders a year before I began to think seriously of matri∣mony, chose my wife as she did her wed∣ding gown, not for a fine glossy surface, but such qualities as would wear well. To do her justice, she was a good-natured no∣table woman; and as for breeding, there were few country ladies who at that time could shew more. She could read any English book without much spelling, and for pickling, preserving, and cookery,
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
none could excel her. She prided her∣self much also upon being an excellent contriver in house-keeping; yet I could never find that we grew richer with all her contrivances.</P>
<P>However, we loved each other tenderly, and our fondness encreased with age. There was in fact nothing that could make us angry with the world or each other. We had an elegant house, situated in a fine country, and a good neighbourhood. The year was spent in moral or rural amuse∣ments; in visiting our rich neighbours, or relieving such as were poor. We had no revolutions to fear, nor fatigues to un∣dergo; all our adventures were by the fire-side, and all our migrations from the blue bed to the brown.</P>
<P>As we lived near the road, we often had the traveller or stranger come to taste our gooseberry wine, for which we had great reputation; and I profess with the veracity of an historian, that I never knew one of them find fault with it. Our cou∣sins
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
too, even to the fortieth remove, all remembered their affinity, without any help from the Herald's office, and came very frequently to see us. Some of them did us no great honour by these claims of kindred; for literally speaking, we had the blind, the maimed, and the halt amongst the number. However, my wife always insisted that as they were the same <HI>flesh and blood</HI> with us, they should sit with us at the same table. So that if we had not very rich, we generally had very happy friends about us; for this remark will hold good thro' life, that the poorer the guest, the better pleased he ever is with being treated: and as some men gaze with admiration at the colours of a tulip, and others are smit∣ten with the wing of a butterfly, so I was by nature an admirer of happy human faces. However, when any one of our re∣lations was found to be a person of very bad character, a troublesome guest, or one we desired to get rid of, upon his leaving my house for the first time, I ever took care to lend him a riding coat, or a pair of
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
boots, or sometimes an horse of small va∣lue, and I always had the satisfaction of finding he never came back to return them. By this the house was cleared of such as we did not like; but never was the family of Wakefield known to turn the traveller or the poor dependant out of doors.</P>
<P>Thus we lived several years in a state of much happiness, not but that we some∣times had those little rubs which Providence sends to enhance the value of its other favours. My orchard was often robbed by school-boys, and my wife's custards plun∣dered by the cats or the children. The 'Squire would sometimes fall asleep in the most pathetic parts of my sermon, or his lady return my wife's civilities at church with a mutilated curtesy. But we soon got over the uneasiness caused by such accidents, and usually in three or four days we be∣gan to wonder how they vext us.</P>
<P>My children, the offspring of tempe∣rance, as they were educated without soft∣ness,
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
so they were at once well formed and healthy; my sons hardy and active, my daughters dutiful and blooming. When I stood in the midst of the little circle, which promised to be the supports of my declining age, I could not avoid repeating the famous story of Count Abensberg, who, in Henry II's progress through Ger∣many, when other courtiers came with their treasures, brought his thirty-two children, and presented them to his sovereign as the most valuable offering he had to bestow. In this manner, though I had but six, I con∣sidered them as a very valuable present made to my country, and consequently looked upon it as my debtor. Our eldest son was named George, after his uncle, who left us ten thousand pounds. Our second child, a girl, I intended to call after her aunt Grissel; but my wife, who during her pregnancy had been reading romances, in∣sisted upon her being called Olivia. In less than another year we had a daughter again, and now I was determined that Gris∣sel should be her name; but a rich relation
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
taking a fancy to stand godmother, the girl was, by her directions, called Sophia; so that we had two romantic names in the family; but I solemnly protest I had no hand in it. Moses was our next, and after an interval of twelve years, we had two sons more.</P>
<P>It would be fruitless to deny my exulta∣tion when I saw my little ones about me; but the vanity and the satisfaction of my wife were even greater than mine. When our visitors would usually say, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, upon my word, Mrs. Primrose, you have the finest children in the whole country."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, neighbour,"</Q> she would answer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they are as heaven made them, handsome enough, if they be good enough; for handsome is that handsome does."</Q> And then she would bid the girls hold up their heads; who, to con∣ceal nothing, were certainly very hand∣some. Mere outside is so very trifling a cir∣cumstance with me, that I should scarce have remembered to mention it, had it not
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
been a general topic of conversation in the country. Olivia, now about eighteen, had that luxuriancy of beauty with which pain∣ters generally draw Hebe; open, sprightly, and commanding. Sophia's features were not so striking at first; but often did more certain execution; for they were soft, mo∣dest, and alluring. The one vanquished by a single blow, the other by efforts successfully repeated.</P>
<P>The temper of a woman is generally formed from the turn of her features, at least it was so with my daughters. Olivia wished for many lovers, Sophia to secure one. Olivia was often affected from too great a desire to please. Sophia even re∣prest excellence from her fears to offend. The one entertained me with her vivacity when I was gay, the other with her sense when I was serious. But these qualities were never carried to excess in either, and I have often seen them exchange charac∣ters for a whole day together. A suit of mourning has transformed my coquet into
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
a prude, and a new set of ribbands given her younger sister more than natural viva∣city. My eldest son George was bred at Oxford, as I intended him for one of the learned professions. My second boy Moses, whom I designed for business, received a sort of a miscellaneous education at home. But it would be needless to attempt de∣scribing the particular characters of young people that had seen but very little of the world. In short, a family likeness pre∣vailed through all, and properly speaking, they had but one character, that of being all equally generous, credulous, simple, and inoffensive.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Family misfortunes. The loss of fortune only serves to encrease the pride of the worthy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE temporal concerns of our family were chiefly committed to my wife's management, as to the spiritual I took them entirely under my own direction. The pro∣fits of my living, which amounted to but thirty-five pounds a year, I gave to the or∣phans and widows of the clergy of our diocese; for having a sufficient fortune of my own, I was careless of temporalities, and felt a secret pleasure in doing my duty without reward. I also set a resolution of keeping no curate, and of being ac∣quainted with every man in the parish, ex∣horting the married men to temperance and the bachelors to matrimony; so that in a few years it was a common saying, that there
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
were three strange wants at Wakefield, a parson wanting pride, young men wanting wives, and ale-houses wanting customers.</P>
<P>Matrimony was always one of my fa∣vourite topics, and I wrote several ser∣mons to prove its utility and happiness: but there was a peculiar tenet which I made a point of supporting; for I main∣tained with Whiston, that it was unlawful for a priest of the church of England, af∣ter the death of his first wife, to take a second, or to express it in one word, I valued myself upon being a strict mono∣gamist.</P>
<P>I was early innitiated into this important dispute, on which so many laborious vo∣lumes have been written. I published some tracts upon the subject myself, which, as they never sold, I have the consolation of thinking are read only by the happy <HI>Few.</HI> Some of my friends called this my weak side; but alas! they had not like me made it the subject of long contemplation. The more I reflected upon it, the more
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
important it appeared. I even went a step beyond Whiston in displaying my principles: as he had engraven upon his wife's tomb that she was the <HI>only</HI> wife of William Whiston; so I wrote a similar epi∣taph for my wife, though still living, in which I extolled her prudence, oeconomy, and obedience till death; and having got it copied fair, with an elegant frame, it was placed over the chimney-piece, where it answered several very useful purposes. It admonished my wife of her duty to me, and my fidelity to her; it inspired her with a passion for fame, and constantly put her in mind of her end.</P>
<P>It was thus, perhaps, from hearing mar∣riage so often recommended, that my eldest son, just upon leaving college, fix∣ed his affections upon the daughter of a neighbouring clergyman, who was a dig∣nitary in the church, and in circumstances to give her a large fortune: but fortune was her smallest accomplishment. Miss Arabella Wilmot was allowed by all, ex∣cept my two daughters, to be completely
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
pretty. Her youth, health, and innocence, were still heightened by a complexion so transparent, and such an happy sensibility of look, that even age could not gaze with in∣difference. As Mr. Wilmot knew that I could make a very handsome settlement on my son, he was not averse to the match; so both families lived together in all that harmony which generally precedes an expected alliance. Being convinced by experience that the days of courtship are the most happy of our lives, I was willing enough to lengthen the period; and the various amusements which the young cou∣ple every day shared in each other's com∣pany, seemed to encrease their passion. We were generally awaked in the morning by music, and on fine days rode a hunting. The hours between breakfast and dinner the ladies devoted to dress and study: they usually read a page, and then gazed at themselves in the glass, which even phi∣losophers might own often presented the page of greatest beauty. At dinner my wife took the lead; for as she always in∣sisted upon carving every thing herself, it
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
being her mother's way, she gave us upon these occasions the history of every dish. When we had dined, to prevent the ladies leaving us, I generally ordered the table to be removed; and sometimes, with the music master's assistance, the girls would give us a very agreeable concert. Walking out, drinking tea, country dances, and forfeits, shortened the rest of the day, with∣out the assistance of cards, as I hated all manner of gaming, except backgammon, at which my old friend and I sometimes took a two-penny hit. Nor can I here pass over an ominous circumstance that hap∣pened the last time we played together: I only wanted to fling a quatre, and yet I threw deuce ace five times running.</P>
<P>Some months were elapsed in this man∣ner, till at last it was thought convenient to fix a day for the nuptials of the young cou∣ple, who seemed earnestly to desire it. During the preparations for the wedding, I need not describe the busy importance of my wife, nor the sly looks of my daugh∣ters: in fact, my attention was fixed on
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
another object, the completing a tract which I intended shortly to publish in de∣fence of monogamy. As I looked upon this as a master-piece both for argument and style, I could not in the pride of my heart avoid shewing it to my old friend Mr. Wilmot, as I made no doubt of receiv∣ing his approbation; but too late I disco∣vered that he was most violently attached to the contrary opinion, and with good reason; for he was at that time actually courting a fourth wife. This, as may be expected, produced a dispute attended with some acrimony, which threatened to interrupt our intended alliance: but on the day before that appointed for the ceremony, we agreed to discuss the subject at large.</P>
<P>It was managed with proper spirit on both sides: he asserted that I was heterodox, I retorted the charge: he replied, and I rejoined. In the mean time, while the controversy was hottest, I was called out by one of my relations, who, with a face of concern, advised me to give up the dis∣pute, and allow the old gentleman to be a <GAP DESC="missing" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ pages" DISP="〈1+ pages missing〉"/>
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
if he could, at least till my son's wedding was over. <Q REND="inline">"How,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"relinquish the cause of truth, and let him be an hus∣band, already driven to the very verge of absurdity. You might as well advise me to give up my fortune as my argument."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That fortune,"</Q> returned my friend, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am now sorry to inform you, is almost no∣thing. Your merchant in town, in whose hands your money was lodged, has gone off, to avoid a statute of bank∣ruptcy, and it is thought has not left a shilling in the pound. I was unwilling to shock you or the family with the account till after the wedding: but now it may serve to moderate your warmth in the argument; for, I suppose, your own prudence will enforce the necessity of dis∣sembling at least till your son has the young lady's fortune secure."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> reurned I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if what you tell me be true, and if I am to be a beggar, it shall ne∣ver make me a rascal, or induce me to disavow my principles. I'll go this moment and inform the company of my circumstaces; and as for the argu∣ment,
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
I even here retract my former con∣cessions in the old gentleman's favour, nor will I allow him now to be an hus∣band either dejure, de facto, or in any sense of the expression."</Q></P>
<P>It would be endless to describe the diffe∣rent sensations of both families when I divulged the news of my misfortunes; but what others felt was slight to what the young lovers appeared to endure. Mr. Wilmot, who seemed before sufficiently in∣clined to break off the match, was by this blow soon determined: one virtue he had in perfection, which was prudence, too often the only virtue that is left us unimpaired at seventy-two.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A migration. The fortunate circumstances of our lives are generally found at last to be of our own procuring.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE only hope of our family now was, that the report of our mis∣fortunes might be malicious or premature: but a letter from my agent in town soon came with a confirmation of every particu∣lar. The loss of fortune to myself alone would have been trifling; the only uneasi∣ness I felt was for my family, who were to be humble without such an education as could render them callous to contempt.</P>
<P>Near a fortnight passed away before I attempted to restrain their affliction; for premature consolation is but the remem∣brancer of sorrow. During this interval,
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
my thoughts were employed on some future means of supporting them; and at last a small Cure of fifteen pounds a year was of∣fered me in a distant neighbourhood, where I could still enjoy my principles without molestation. With this proposal I joyfully closed, having determined to encrease my salary by managing a little farm.</P>
<P>Having taken this resolution, my next care was to get together the wrecks of my fortune; and all debts collected and paid, out of fourteen thousand pounds we had now but four hundred remaining. My chief attention therefore was next to bring down the pride of my family to their cir∣cumstances; for I well knew that aspiring beggary is wretchedness itself. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You can't be ignorant, my children,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that no prudence of ours could have prevented our late misfortune; but prudence may do much in disappointing its effects. We are now poor, my fondlings, and wisdom bids us conform to our humble situation. Let us then, without repining,
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
give up those splendours with which numbers are wretched, and seek in hum∣bler circumstances that peace with which all may be happy. The poor live plea∣santly without our help, and we are not so imperfectly formed as to be incapable of living without theirs. No, my chil∣dren, let us from this moment give up all pretensions to gentility; we have still enough left for happiness if we are wise, and let us draw upon content for the deficiencies of fortune."</Q></P>
<P>As my eldest son was bred a scholar, I determined to send him to town, where his abilities might contribute to our support and his own. The separation of friends and families is, perhaps, one of the most distressful circumstances attendant on pe∣nury. The day soon arrived on which we were to disperse for the first time. My son, after taking leave of his mother and the rest, who mingled their tears with their kisses, came to ask a blessing from me. This I gave him from my heart, and which,
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
added to five guineas, was all the patrimony I had now to bestow. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You are going, my boy,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to London on foot, in the manner Hooker, your great an∣cestor, travelled there before you. Take from me the same horse that was given him by the good bishop Jewel, this staff, and take this book too, it will be your comfort on the way: these two lines in it are worth a million, <HI>I have been young, and now am old; yet never saw I the righteous man forsaken, or his seed beg∣ging their bread.</HI> Let this be your con∣solation as you travel on. Go, my boy, whatever be thy fortune let me see thee once a year; still keep a good heart, and farewell."</Q> As he was possest of inte∣grity and honour, I was under no appre∣hensions from throwing him naked into the amphitheatre of life; for I knew he would act a good part whether he rose or fell.</P>
<P>His departure only prepared the way for our own, which arrived a few days after∣wards.
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
The leaving a neighbourhood in which we had enjoyed so many hours of tranquility, was not without a tear, which scarce fortitude itself could suppress. Be∣sides, a journey of seventy miles to a family that had hitherto never been above ten from home, filled us with apprehension, and the cries of the poor, who followed us for some miles, contributed to encrease it. The first day's journey brought us in safety within thirty miles of our future re∣treat, and we put up for the night at an obscure inn in a village by the way. When we were shewn a room, I desired the land∣lord, in my usual way, to let us have his company, with which he complied, as what he drank would encrease the bill next morning. He knew, however, the whole neighbourhood to which I was re∣moving, particularly 'Squire Thornhill, who was to be my landlord, and who lived within a few miles of the place. This gentleman he described as one who desired to know little more of the world than the pleasures it afforded, being particularly re∣markable
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
for his attachment to the fair sex. He observed that no virtue was able to resist his arts and assiduity, and that scarce a farmer's daughter within ten miles round but what had found him successful and faithless. Though this account gave me some pain, it had a very a different ef∣fect upon my daughters, whose features seemed to brighten with the expectation of an approaching triumph, nor was my wife less pleased and confident of their allure∣ments and virtue. While our thoughts were thus employed, the hostess entered the room to inform her husband, that the strange gentleman, who had been two days in the house, wanted money, and could not satisfy them for his reckoning. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Want money!"</Q> replied the host, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that must be impossible; for it was no later than yesterday he paid three guineas to our beadle to spare an old broken sol∣dier that was to be whipped through the town for dog-stealing."</Q> The hostess, however, still persisting in her first assertion, he was preparing to leave the room, swear∣ing
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
that he would be satisfied one way or another, when I begged the landlord would introduce me to a stranger of so much cha∣rity as he described. With this he com∣plied, shewing in a gentleman who seemed to be about thirty, drest in cloaths that once were laced. His person was well formed, though his face was marked with the lines of thinking. He had something short and dry in his address, and seemed not to understand ceremony, or to despise it. Upon the landlord's leaving the room, I could not avoid expressing my concern to the stranger at seeing a gentleman in such circumstances, and offered him my purse to satisfy the present demand. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I take it with all my heart, Sir,"</Q> replied he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and am glad that a late oversight in giv∣ing what money I had about me, has shewn me that there is still some benevo∣lence left among us. I must, however, previously entreat being informed of the name and residence of my benefactor, in order to remit it as soon as possible."</Q> In this I satisfied him fully, not only men∣tioning
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
my name and late misfortunes, but the place to which I was going to remove. <Q REND="inline">"This,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"happens still more luckily than I hoped for, as I am going the same way myself, having been de∣tained here two days by the floods, which, I hope, by to-morrow will be found passable."</Q> I testified the pleasure I should have in his company, and my wife and daughters joining in entreaty, he was prevailed upon to stay supper. The stran∣ger's conversation, which was at once pleas∣sing and instructive, induced me to wish for a continuance of it; but it was now high time to retire and take refreshment against the fatigues of the following day.</P>
<P>The next morning we all set forward to∣gether: my family on horseback, while Mr. Burchell, our new companion, walked along the foot-path by the road-side, ob∣serving, with a smile, that as we were ill mounted, he would be too generous to at∣tempt leaving us behind. As the floods were not yet subsided, we were obliged to
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
hire a guide, who trotted on before, Mr. Burchell and I bringing up the rear. We lightened the fatigues of the road with philosophical disputes, which he seemed perfectly to understand. But what sur∣prised me most was, that though he was a money-borrower, he defended his opini∣ons with as much obstinacy as if he had been my patron. He now and then also informed me to whom the different seats belonged that lay in our view as we tra∣velled the road. <Q REND="inline">"That,"</Q> cried he, point∣ing to a very magnificent house which stood at some distance, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"belongs to Mr. Thornhill, a young gentleman who enjoys a large fortune, though entirely depen∣dant on the will of his uncle, Sir Willam Thornhill, a gentleman, who content with a little himself, permits his nephew to en∣joy the rest, and chiefly resides in town."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What!"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is my young landlord then the nephew of a man whose vir∣tues, generosity, and singularities are so universally known? I have heard
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
Sir William Thornhill represented as one of the most generous, yet whim∣sical, men in the kingdom; a man of consummate benevolence"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Something, perhaps, too much so,"</Q> re∣plied Mr. Burchell, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"at least he carried be∣nevolence to an excess when young; for his passions were then strong, and as they all were upon the side of vir∣tue, they led it up to a romantic ex∣treme. He early began to aim at the qualifications of the soldier and scho∣lar; was soon distinguished in the army, and had some reputation among men of learning. Adulation ever follows the ambitious; for such alone receive most pleasure from flattery. He was sur∣rounded with crowds, who shewed him only one side of their character; so that he began to lose a regard for private interest in universal sympathy. He loved all mankind; for fortune prevented him from knowing that there were rascals. Physicians tell us of a disorder in which
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
the whole body is so exquisitely sensible, that the slightest touch gives pain: what some have thus suffered in their per∣sons, this gentleman felt in his mind. The slightest distress, whether real or fic∣titious, touched him to the quick, and his soul laboured under a sickly sensibi∣lity of the miseries of others. Thus dis∣posed to relieve, it will be easily conjec∣tured, he found numbers disposed to so∣licit: his profusions began to impair his fortune, but not his good-nature; that, indeed, was seen to encrease as the other seemed to decay: he grew improvident as he grew poor; and though he talked like a man of sense, his actions were those of a fool. Still, however, being sur∣rounded with importunity, and no lon∣ger able to satisfy every request that was made him, instead of <HI>money</HI> he gave <HI>pro∣mises.</HI> They were all he had to bestow, and he had not resolution enough to give any man pain by a denial. By this means he drew round him crowds of de∣pendants,
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
whom he was sure to disap∣point; yet wished to relieve. These hung upon him for a time, and left him with merited reproaches and contempt. But in proportion as he became contemptible to others, he became despicable to him∣self. His mind had leaned upon their adulation, and that support taken away, he could find no pleasure in the ap∣plause of his heart, which he had never learnt to reverence itself. The world now began to wear a different aspect; the flat∣tery of his friends began to dwindle into simple approbation, that soon took the more friendly form of advice, and ad∣vice when rejected ever begets reproaches. He now found that such friends as bene∣fits had gathered round him, were by no means the most estimable: it was now found that a man's own heart must be ever given to gain that of another. I now found, that—but I forget what I was going to observe: in short, sir, he resolved to respect him∣self,
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
and laid down a plan of restoring his shattered fortune. For this pur∣pose, in his own whimsical man∣ner he travelled through Europe on foot, and before he attained the age of thirty, his circumstances were more afflu∣ent than ever. At present, therefore, his bounties are more rational and mo∣derate than before; but still he preserves the character of an humourist, and finds most pleasure in eccentric virtues."</Q></P>
<P>My attention was so much taken up by Mr. Burchell's account, that I scarce looked forward as we went along, till we were alarmed by the cries of my fami∣ly, when turning, I perceived my young∣est daughter in the midst of a rapid stream, thrown from her horse, and strug∣gling with the torrent. She had sunk twice, nor was it in my power to disen∣gage myself in time to bring her relief. My sensations were even too violent to
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
permit my attempting her rescue: she would have certainly perished had not my companion, percieving her danger, instantly plunged in to her relief, and, with some difficulty, brought her in safety to the oppo∣site shore. By taking the current a little farther up, the rest of the family got safely over; where we had an opportunity of joining our acknowledgments to her's. Her gratitude may be more readily imagined than described: she thanked her deliverer more with looks than words, and conti∣nued to lean upon his arm, as if still willing to receive assistance. My wife also hoped one day to have the pleasure of returning his kindness at her own house. Thus, after we were all refreshed at the next inn, and had dined together, as he was going to a different part of the country, he took leave; and we pursued our journey. My wife observ∣ing as we went, that she liked Mr. Bur∣chell extremely, and protesting, that if he had birth and fortune to entitle him to match into such a family as our's, she knew

no man she would sooner fix upon. I could not but smile to hear her talk in this strain: one almost at the verge of beggary thus to assume language of the most insulting affluence, might excite the ridicule of ill-nature; but I was never much displeased with those innocent delu∣sions that tend to make us more happy.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A proof that even the humblest for∣tune may grant happiness and delight, which depend not on circumstance, but constitution.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE place of our new retreat was in a little neighbourhood, consisting of farmers, who tilled their own grounds, and were equal strangers to opulence and poverty. As they had almost all the con∣veniencies of life within themselves, they seldom visited towns or cities in search of superfluity. Remote from the polite, they still retained a primaeval simplicity of man∣ners, and frugal by long habit, scarce knew that temperance was a virtue. They wrought with chearfulness on days of la∣bour; but observed festivals as intervals of idleness and pleasure. They kept up the
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
Christmas carol, sent true love-knots on Valentine morning, eat pancakes on Shrove∣tide, shewed their wit on the first of April, and religiously cracked nuts on Michael∣mas eve. Being apprized of our approach, the whole neighbourhood came out to meet their minister, drest in their finest cloaths, and preceded by a pipe and tabor: also a feast was provided for our reception, at which we sat chearfully down; and what the conversation wanted in wit, we made up in laughter.</P>
<P>Our little habitation was situated at the foot of a sloping hill, sheltered with a beautiful underwood behind, and a prat∣ling river before; on one side a meadow, on the other a green. My farm consisted of about twenty acres of excellent land, having given an hundred pound for my predecessor's good-will. Nothing could ex∣ceed the neatness of my little enclosures: the elms and hedge rows appearing with inexpressible beauty. My house consisted of but one story, and was covered with thatch, which gave it an air of great snug∣ness;
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
the walls on the inside were nicely white-washed, and my daughters undertook to adorn them with pictures of their own designing. Though the same room served us for parlour and kitchen, that only made it the warmer. Besides, as it was kept with the utmost neatness, the dishes, plates, and coppers, being well scoured, and all dis∣posed in bright rows on the shelves, the eye was agreeably relieved, and did not seem to want rich furniture. There were three other apartments, one for my wife and me, another for our two daughters, within our own, and the third, with two beds, for the rest of my children.</P>
<P>The little republic to which I gave laws, was regulated in the following manner: by sun-rise we all assembled in our common appartment; the fire being previously kindled by the servant. After we had sa∣luted each other with proper ceremony, for I always thought fit to keep up some mechanical forms of good breeding, with∣out which freedom ever destroys friendship,
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
we all bent in gratitude to that Being who gave us another day. This duty being performed, my son and I went to pursue our usual industry abroad, while my wife and daughters employed themselves in pro∣viding breakfast, which was always ready at a certain time. I allowed half an hour for this meal, and an hour for dinner; which time was taken up in innocent mirth be∣tween my wife and daughters, and in phi∣losophical arguments between my son and me.</P>
<P>As we rose with the sun, so we never pursued our labours after it was gone down, but returned home to the expecting family; where smiling looks, a neat hearth, and pleasant fire, were prepared for our recep∣tion. Nor were we without other guests: sometimes farmer Flamborough, our talk∣ative neighbour, and often the blind piper, would pay us a visit, and taste our goose∣berry wine; for the making of which we had lost neither the receipt nor the reputa∣tion. These harmless people had several
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
ways of being good company, while one played the pipes, another would sing some soothing ballad, Johnny Armstrong's last good-night, or the cruelty of Barbara Al∣len. The night was concluded in the man∣ner we began the morning, my youngest boys being appointed to read the lessons of the day, and he that read loudest, distinct∣est, and best, was to have an halfpenny on Sunday to put in the poor's box.</P>
<P>When Sunday came, it was indeed a day of finery, which all my sumptuary edicts could not restrain. How well so ever I fancied my lectures against pride had con∣quered the vanity of my daughters; yet I still found them secretly attached to all their former finery: they still loved laces, ribbands, bugles and catgut; my wife her∣self retained a passion for her crimson pa∣duasoy, because I formerly happened to say it became her.</P>
<P>The first Sunday in particular their beha∣viour served to mortify me: I had desired my
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
girls the preceding night to be drest early the next day; for I always loved to be at church a good while before the rest of the congregation. They punctually obeyed my directions; but when we were to as∣semble in the morning at breakfast, down came my wife and daughters, drest out in all their former splendour: their hair plais∣tered up with pomatum, their faces patched to taste, their trains bundled up into an heap behind, and rustling at every mo∣tion. I could not help smiling at their va∣nity, particularly that of my wife, from whom I expected more discretion. In this exigence, therefore, my only resource was to order my son, with an important air, to call our coach. The girls were amazed at the command; but I repeated it with more solemnity than before.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Surely, my dear, you jest,"</Q> cried my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we can walk it perfectly well: we want no coach to carry us now."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You mis∣take, child,"</Q> returned I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we do want a coach; for if we walk to church in this trim, the very children in the parish
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
will hoot after us for a show."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"In∣deed,"</Q> replied my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I always ima∣gined that my Charles was fond of see∣ing his children neat and handsome about him."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You may be as neat as you please,"</Q> interrupted I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and I shall love you the better for it; but all this is not neatness, but frippery. These rufflings, and pinkings, and patch∣ings, will only make us hated by all the wives of all our neighbours. No, my children,"</Q> continued I, more gravely, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"those gowns may be altered into some∣thing of a plainer cut; for finery is very unbecoming in us, who want the means of decency. I don't know whe∣ther such flouncing and shredding is be∣coming even in the rich, if we consider, upon a moderate calculation, that the nakedness of the indigent world may be cloathed from the trimmings of the vain."</Q></P>
<P>This remonstrance had the proper ef∣fect; they went with great composure,
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
that very instant, to change their dress; and the next day I had the satisfaction of finding my daughters, at their own request employed in cutting up their trains into Sunday waistcoats for Dick and Bill, the two little ones, and what was still more sa∣tisfactory, the gowns seemed improved by being thus curtailed.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A new and great acquaintance intro∣duced. <HI>What we place most hopes upon, generally proves most fatal.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT a small distance from the house my predecessor had made a seat, over∣shaded by an hedge of hawthorn and ho∣neysuckle. Here, when the weather was fine, and our labour soon finished, we usu∣ally all sate together, to enjoy an exten∣sive landschape, in the calm of the evening. Here too we drank tea, which now was become an occasional banquet; and as we had it but seldom, it diffused a new joy, the preparations for it being made with no small share of bustle and ceremony. On these occasions, our two little ones al∣ways read for us, and they were regularly served after we had done. Sometimes, to give a variety to our amusements, the girls
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
sung to the guitar; and while they thus formed a little concert, my wife and I would stroll down the sloping field, that was embellished with blue bells and cen∣taury, talk of our children with rapture, and enjoy the breeze that wafted both health and harmony.</P>
<P>In this manner we began to find that every situation in life might bring its own peculiar pleasures: every morning waked us to a repetition of toil; but the evening repaid it with vacant hilarity.</P>
<P>It was about the beginning of autumn, on a holiday, for I kept such as intervals of relaxation from labour, that I had drawn out my family to our usual place of amuse∣ment, and our young musicians began their usual concert. As we were thus engaged, we saw a stag bound nimbly by, within about twenty paces of where we were sit∣ting, and by its panting, it seemed prest by the hunters. We had not much time to reflect upon the poor animal's distress,
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
when we perceived the dogs and horsemen come sweeping along at some distance be∣hind, and making the very path it had taken. I was instantly for returning in with my family; but either curiosity or surprize, or some more hidden motive, held my wife and daughters to their seats. The hunts∣man, who rode foremost, past us with great swiftness, followed by four or five persons more, who seemed in equal haste. At last, a young gentleman of a more genteel ap∣pearance than the rest, came forward, and for a while regarding us, instead of pursu∣ing the chace, stopt short, and giving his horse to a servant who attended, approach∣ed us with a careless superior air. He seemed to want no introduction, but was going to salute my daughters as one cer∣tain of a kind reception; but they had early learnt the lesson of looking presump∣tion out of countenance. Upon which he let us know that his name was Thorn∣hill, and that he was owner of the estate that lay for some extent round us. He again, therefore, offered to salute the fe∣male
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
part of the family, and such was the power of fortune and fine cloaths, that he found no second repulse. As his address, though confident, was easy, we soon be∣came more familiar; and perceiving mu∣sical instruments lying near, he begged to be favoured with a song. As I did not ap∣prove of such disproportioned acquain∣tances, I winked upon my daughters in order to prevent their compliance; but my hint was counteracted by one from their mo∣ther; so that with a chearful air they gave us a favourite song of Dryden's. Mr. Thornhill seemed highly delighted with their per∣formance and choice, and then took up the guitar himself. He played but very indif∣ferently; however, my eldest daughter re∣paid his former applause with interest, and assured him that his tones were louder than even those of her master. At this com∣pliment he bowed, which she returned with a curtesy. He praised her taste, and she commended his understanding: an age could not have made them better acquaint∣ed. While the fond mother too, equally
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
happy, insisted upon her landlord's stepping in, and tasting a glass of her gooseberry. The whole family seemed earnest to please him: my girls attempted to entertain him with topics they thought most modern, while Moses, on the contrary, gave him a question or two from the ancients, for which he had the satisfaction of being laughed at; for he always ascribed to his wit that laughter which was lavished at his simplicity: my little ones were no less bu∣sy, and fondly stuck close to the stranger. All my endeavours could scarce keep their dirty fingers from handling and tarnishing the lace on his cloaths, and lifting up the flaps of his pocket holes, to see what was there. At the approach of evening he took leave; but not till he had requested permission to renew his visit, which, as he was our landlord, we most readily agreed to.</P>
<P>As soon as he was gone, my wife called a council on the conduct of the day. She was of opinion, that it was a most fortu∣nate
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
hit; for that she had known even stranger things at last brought to bear. She hoped again to see the day in which we might hold up our heads with the best of them; and concluded, she protested she could see no reason why the two Miss Wrinklers should marry great fortunes, and her children get none. As this last argu∣ment was directed to me, I protested I could see no reason for it neither, nor why one got the ten thousand pound prize in the lottery, and another sate down with a blank. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But those,"</Q> added I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"who either aim at husbands greater than themselves, or at the ten thousand pound prize, have been fools for their ridiculous claims, whether successful or not."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I protest, Charles,"</Q> cried my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this is the way you always damp my girls and me when we are in Spirits. Tell me, Sophy, my dear, what do you think of our new visitor? Don't you think he seemed to be good-natured?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Immensely so, indeed, Mamma,"</Q> replied she. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I think he has a great deal to say upon every
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
thing, and is never at a loss; and the more trifling the subject, the more he has to say; and what is more, I protest he is very handsome."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> cried Olivia, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he is well enough for a man; but for my part, I don't much like him, he is so extremely impudent and fami∣liar; but on the guitar he is shocking."</Q> These two last speeches I interpreted by contraries. I found by this, that Sophia internally despised, as much as Olivia se∣cretly admired him.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whatever may be your opinions of him, my children,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to confess a truth, he has not prepossest me in his favour. Dispropor∣tioned friendships ever terminate in dis∣gust; and I thought, notwithstanding all his ease, that he seemed perfectly sensible of the distance between us. Let us keep to companions of our own rank. There is no character among men more contemptible than that of a fortune-hunter, and I can see no reason why fortune-hunting women should not be contemptible too. Thus, at best, it will
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
be contempt if his views are honoura∣ble; but if they are otherwise! I should shudder but to think of that; for though I have no apprehensions from the con∣duct of my children, I think there are some from his character."</Q>—I would have proceeded, but for the interruption of a servant from the 'Squire, who, with his compliments, sent us a side of venison, and a promise to dine with us some days after. This well-timed present pleaded more powerfully in his favour, than any thing I had to say could obviate. I there∣fore continued silent, satisfied with just hav∣ing pointed out danger, and leaving it to their own discretion to avoid it. That vir∣tue which requires to be ever guarded, is scarce worth the centinel.</P>

<P>The happiness of a country fire-side.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS we carried on the former dispute with some degree of warmth, in or∣der to accommodate matters, it was univer∣sally concluded upon, that we should have a part of the venison for supper, and the girls undertook the task with alacrity. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am sorry,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that we have no neighbour or stranger to take a part in this good cheer: feasts of this kind ac∣quire a double relish from hospitality."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Bless me,"</Q> cried my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"here comes our good friend Mr. Burchell, that saved our Sophia, and that run you down fairly in the argument."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Confute me in argument, child!"</Q> cried I. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You mistake there, my dear. I believe there are but few that can do that: I never dispute
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
your abilities at making a goose-pye, and I beg you'll leave argument to me."</Q>—As I spoke, poor Mr. Burchell entered the house, and was welcomed by the family, who shook him heartily by the hand, while little Dick officiously reached him a chair.</P>
<P>I was pleased with the poor man's friend∣ship for two reasons; because I knew that he wanted mine, and I knew him to be friendly as far as he was able. He was known in our neighbourhood by the cha∣racter of the poor Gentleman that would do no good when he was young, though he was not yet above thirty. He would at intervals talk with great good sense; but in general he was fondest of the company of children, whom he used to call harmless little men. He was famous, I found, for singing them ballads, and telling them sto∣ries; and seldom went without something in his pockets for them, a piece of ginger∣bread, or a halfpenny whistle. He gene∣rally came into our neighbourhood once a
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
year, and lived upon the neighbours hos∣pitality. He sate down to supper among us, and my wife was not sparing of her gooseberry wine. The tale went round; he sung us old songs, and gave the chil∣dren the story of the Buck of Beverland, with the history of Patient Grissel. The adventures of Catskin next entertained them, and then Fair Rosamond's bower. Our cock, which always crew at eleven, now told us it was time for repose; but an unforeseen difficulty started about lod∣ging the stranger: all our beds were al∣ready taken up, and it was too late to send him to the next alehouse. In this dilemma, little Dick offered him his part of the bed, if his brother Moses would let him lie with him; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And I,"</Q> cried Bill, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"will give Mr. Burchell my part, if my sisters will take me to theirs."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well done, my good children,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"hospitality is one of the first christian duties. The beast retires to its shelter, and the bird flies to its nest; but helpless man can only find refuge from his fellow creature. The
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
greatest stranger in this world, was he that came to save it. He never had an house, as if willing to see what hospita∣lity was left remaining amongst us. Deborah, my dear,"</Q> cried I, to my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"give those boys a lump of sugar each, and let Dick's be the largest, because he spoke first."</Q></P>
<P>In the morning early I called out my whole family to help at saving an after-growth of hay, and our guest offering his assistance, he was accepted among the number. Our labours went on lightly, we turned the swath to the wind, I went foremost, and the rest followed in due succession. I could not avoid, however, observing the assidu∣ity of Mr. Burchell in assisting my daugh∣ter Sophia in her part of the task. When he had finished his own, he would join in her's, and enter into a close conversation: but I had too good an opinion of Sophia's understanding, and was too well convinced of her ambition, to be under any uneasi∣ness from a man of broken fortune.
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
When we were finished for the day, Mr. Burchell was invited as on the night before; but he refused, as he was to lie that night at a neighbour's, to whose child he was carrying a whistle. When gone, our con∣versation at supper turned upon our late un∣fortunate guest. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What a strong in∣stance,"</Q> said I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is that poor man of the miseries attending a youth of levity and extravagance. He by no means wants sense, which only serves to aggravate his former folly. Poor forlorn creature, where are now the revellers, the flatterers, that he could once inspire and com∣mand! Gone, perhaps, to attend the bagnio pander, grown rich by his extra∣vagance. They once praised him, and now they applaud the pander: their for∣mer raptures at his wit, are now convert∣ed into sarcasms at his folly: he is poor, and perhaps deserves poverty; for he has neither the ambition to be in∣dependent, nor the skill to be useful."</Q> Prompted, perhaps, by some secret reasons,
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
I delivered this observation with too much acrimony, which my Sophia gently reprov∣ed. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whatsoever his former conduct may be, pappa, his circumstances should ex∣empt him from censure now. His pre∣sent indigence is a sufficient punishment for former folly; and I have heard my pappa himself say, that we should never strike our unnecessary blow at a victim over whom providence already holds the scourge of its resentment."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You are right, Sophy,"</Q> cried my son Moses, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and one of the ancients finely represents so malicious a conduct, by the attempts of a rustic to flay Marsyas, whose skin, the fable tells us, had been wholly stript off by another. Besides, I don't know if this poor man's situation be so bad as my father would represent it. We are not to judge of the feelings of others by what we might feel if in their place. However dark the habitation of the mole to our eyes, yet the animal itself finds the apartment sufficiently lightsome. And
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
to confess a truth, this man's mind seems fitted to his station; for I never heard any one more sprightly than he was to-day, when he conversed with you."</Q>—This was said without the least design, how∣ever it excited a blush, which she strove to cover by an affected laugh, assuring him, that she scarce took any notice of what he said to her; but that she believed he might once have been a very fine gentleman. The readiness with which she undertook to vindicate herself, and her blushing, were symptoms I did not internally approve; but I represt my suspicions.</P>
<P>As we expected our landlord the next day, my wife went to make the venison pas∣ty; Moses sate reading, while I taught the little ones: my daughters seemed equally busy with the rest; and I observed them for a good while cooking something over the fire. I at first supposed they were assisting their mo∣ther; but little Dick informed me in a whis∣per, that they were making a <HI>wash</HI> for the face.
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
Washes of all kinds I had a natural antipa∣thy to; for I knew that instead of mending the complexion they spoiled it. I therefore approached my chair by sly degrees to the fire, and grasping the poker, as if it wanted mending, seemingly by accident, over∣turned the whole composition, and it was too late to begin another.</P>

<P>A town wit described. The dullest fellows may learn to be comical for a night or two.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN the morning arrived on which we were to entertain our young landlord, it may be easily supposed what provisions were exhausted to make an ap∣pearance. It may also be conjectured that my wife and daughters expanded their gay∣est plumage upon this occasion. Mr. Thorn∣hill came with a couple of friends, his chaplain and feeder. The servants, who were numerous, he politely ordered to the next ale-house: but my wife, in the tri∣umph of her heart, insisted on entertaining them all; for which, by the bye, the family was pinched for three weeks after. As Mr. Burchell had hinted to us the day be∣fore,
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
that he was making some proposals of marriage to Miss Wilmot, my son George's former mistress, this a good deal damped the heartiness of his reception: but acci∣dent, in some measure, relieved our em∣barrasment; for one of the company hap∣pening to mention her name, Mr. Thorn∣hill observed with an oath, that he never knew any thing more absurd than calling such a fright a beauty: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For strike me ugly,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if I should not find as much pleasure in choosing my mistress by the information of a lamp under the clock at St. Dunstan's."</Q> At this he laugh∣ed, and so did we:—the jests of the rich are ever successful. Olivia too could not avoid whispering, loud enough to be heard, that he had an infinite fund of humour.</P>
<P>After dinner, I began with my usual toast, the Church; for this I was thanked by the chaplain, as he said the church was the only mistress of his affections.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Come tell us honestly, Frank,"</Q> said the
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
'Squire, with his usual archness, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"suppose the church, your present mistress, drest in lawn sleeves, on one hand, and Miss Sophia, with no lawn about her, on the other, which would you be for?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For both, to be sure,"</Q> cried the chap∣lain.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Right Frank,"</Q> cried the 'Squire; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for may this glass suffocate me but a fine girl is worth all the priestcraft in the na∣tion. For what are tythes and tricks but an imposition, all a confounded impos∣ture, and I can prove it."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I wish you would,"</Q> cried my son Moses, and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I think,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I should be able to combat in the opposition."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Very well, Sir,"</Q> cried the 'Squire, who immediately smoaked him, and winking on the rest of the company, to prepare us for the sport, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if you are for a cool argument upon that subject, I am ready to accept the challenge. And first, whether are you for managing it analogically, or di∣alogically?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am for managing it rationally,"</Q> cried Moses, quite happy at being permited to dispute. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Good
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
again,"</Q> cried the 'Squire, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and firstly, of the first. I hope you'll not deny that whatever is is. If you don't grant me that, I can go no further."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">Why,"</Q> returned Moses, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I think I may grant that, and make the best of it."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I hope too,"</Q> returned the other, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you'll grant that a part is less than the whole."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I grant that too,"</Q> cried Moses, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is but just and reasonable."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I hope,"</Q> cried the 'Squire, you will not deny, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the two angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nothing can be plainer,"</Q> returned t'other, and looked round with his usual importance.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Very well,"</Q> cri∣ed the 'Squire, speaking very quick, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the premises being thus settled, I proceed to observe, that the concatanation of self existences, proceeding in a reciprocal duplicate ratio, naturally produce a pro∣blematical dialogism, which in some measure proves that the essence of spiri∣tuality may be referred to the second predicable"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hold, hold,"</Q> cried the other, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I deny that: Do you think I can
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
thus tamely submit to such heterodox doctrines?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"What,"</Q> replied the 'Squire, as if in a passion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not submit! Answer me one plain question: Do you think Aristotle right when he says, that relatives are related?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Undoubtedly,"</Q> replied the other.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If so then,"</Q> cried the 'Squire, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"answer me directly to what I propose: Whether do you judge the analytical investigation of the first part of my enthymem deficient secundum quoad, or quoad minus, and give me your reasons too: give me your reasons, I say, directly."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I protest,"</Q> cried Moses, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I don't rightly comprehend the force of your reasoning; but if it be reduced to one simple proposition, I fancy it may then have an answer,"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O, sir,"</Q> cried the 'Squire, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am your most humble ser∣vant, I find you want me to furnish you with argument and intellects both. No, sir, there I protest you are too hard for me."</Q> This effectually raised the laugh against poor Moses, who sate the only dis∣mal
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
figure in a groupe of merry faces: nor did he offer a single syllable more during the whole entertainment.</P>
<P>But though all this gave me no pleasure, it had a very different effect upon Olivia, who mistook this humour, which was a mere act of the memory, for real wit. She thought him therefore a very fine gentle∣man; and such as consider what powerful ingredients a good figure, fine cloaths, and fortune, are in that character, will easily forgive her. Mr. Thornhill, notwith∣standing his real ignorance, talked with ease, and could expatiate upon the common topics of conversation with fluency. It is not surprising then that such talents should win the affections of a girl, who by educa∣tion was taught to value an appearance in herself, and consequently to set a value up∣on it when found in another.</P>
<P>Upon his departure, we again entered into a debate upon the merits of our young landlord. As he directed his looks and
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
conversation to Olivia, it was no longer doubted but that she was the object that induced him to be our visitor. Nor did she seem to be much displeased at the in∣nocent raillery of her brother and sister up∣on this occasion. Even Deborah herself seemed to share the glory of the day, and exulted in her daughter's victory as if it were her own. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And now, my dear,"</Q> cried she to me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I'll fairly own, that it was I that instructed my girls to encou∣rage our landlord's addresses. I had al∣ways some ambition, and you now see that I was right; for who knows how this may end?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, who knows that indeed,"</Q> answered I, with a groan: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for my part I don't much like it; and I could have been better pleased with one that was poor and honest, than this fine gen∣tleman with his fortune and infidelity; for depend on't, if he be what I suspect him, no free-thinker shall ever have a child of mine."</Q></P>

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sure, father,"</Q> cried Moses, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you are too severe in this; for heaven will never arraign him for what he thinks, but for what he does. Every man has a thou∣sand vicious thoughts, which arise with∣out his power to suppress. Thinking freely of religion, may be involuntary with this gentleman: so that allowing his sentiments to be wrong, yet as he is purely passive in their reception, he is no more to be blamed for their incur∣sions than the governor of a city without walls for the shelter he is obliged to af∣ford an invading enemy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"True, my son,"</Q> cried I; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but if the governor invites the enemy, there he is justly culpable. And such is always the case with those who embrace error. The vice does not lie in assenting to the proofs they see; but in being blind to many of the proofs that offer. Like corrupt judges on a bench, they deter∣mine right on that part of the evidence they hear; but they will not hear all the
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
evidence. Thus, my son, though our erroneous opinions be involuntary when formed, yet as we have been wilfully corrupt, or very negligent in forming them, we deserve punishment for our vice, or contempt for our folly."</Q></P>
<P>My wife now kept up the conversation, though not the argument: she observed, that several very prudent men of our ac∣quaintance were free-thinkers, and made very good husbands; and she knew some sensible girls that had skill enough to make converts of their spouses: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And who knows, my dear,"</Q> continued she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what Olivia may be able to do. The girl has a great deal to say upon every subject, and to my knowledge is very well skilled in controversy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, my dear, what controversy can she have read?"</Q> cried I. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It does not occur to my memory that I ever put such books into her hands: you certainly over-rate her merit."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, pappa,"</Q>
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
replied Olivia, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"she does not: I have read a great deal of controversy. I have read the disputes between Thwackum and Square; the controversy between Robin∣son Crusoe and Friday the savage, and I am now employed in reading the contro∣versy in Religious courtship."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Very well,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that's a good girl, I find you are perfectly qualified for making converts, and so go help your mother to make the gooseberry-pye."</Q></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>An amour, which promises little good for∣tune, yet may be productive of much.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE next morning we were again vi∣sited by Mr. Burchell, though I be∣gan, for certain reasons, to be displeased with the frequency of his return; but I could not refuse him my company and fire-side. It is true his labour more than requited his entertainment; sor he wrought among us with vigour, and either in the meadow or at the hay-rick put himself foremost. Besides, he had always some∣thing amusing to say that lessened our toil, and was at once so out of the way, and yet so sensible, that I loved, laughed at, and pitied him. My only dislike arose from an attachment he discovered to my daughter: he would, in a jesting manner,
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
call her his little mistress, and when he bought each of the girls a set of ribbands, hers was the finest. I knew not how, but he every day seemed to become more ami∣able, his wit to improve, and his simplicity to assume the superior airs of wisdom.</P>
<P>Our family dined in the field, and we sate, or rather reclined, round a temperate repast, our cloth spread upon the hay, while Mr. Burchell seemed to give chear∣fulness to the feast. To heighten our satis∣faction two blackbirds answered each other from opposite hedges, the familiar red∣breast came and pecked the crumbs from our hands, and every sound seemed but the echo of tranquillity. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I never sit thus,"</Q> says Sophia, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but I think of the two lovers, so sweetly described by Mr. Gay, who were struck dead in each other's arms under a barley mow. There is something so pathetic in the descrip∣tion, that I have read it an hundred times with new rapture."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In my opinion,"</Q> cried my son, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the finest
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
strokes in that description are much below those in the Acis and Galatea of Ovid. The Roman poet understands the use of <HI>contrast</HI> better, and upon that figure artfully managed all strength in the pathe∣tic depends."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is remarkable,"</Q> cried Mr. Burchell, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that both the poets you mention have equally contributed to in∣troduce a false taste into their respective countries, by loading all their lines with epithet. Men of little genius found them most easily imitated in their defects, and English poetry, like that in the latter empire of Rome, is nothing at present but a combination of luxuriant images, with∣out plot or connexion; a string of epithets that improve the sound, without carrying on the sense. But perhaps, madam, while I thus reprehend others, you'll think it just that I should give them an opportu∣nity to retaliate, and indeed I have made this remark only to have an opportunity of introducing to the company a ballad, which, whatever be its other
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
defects, is I think at least free from those I have mentioned."<LG TYPE="ballad">
<HEAD>A BALLAD.</HEAD>

While this ballad was reading, Sophia seemed to mix an air of tenderness with her approbation. But our tranquillity was soon disturbed by the report of a gun just by us, and immediately after a man was seen bursting through the hedge, to take up the game he had killed. This sportsman was the 'Squire's chaplain, who had shot one of the blackbirds that so agreeably entertained us. So loud a re∣port, and so near, startled my daughters; and I could perceive that Sophia in the fright had thrown herself into Mr. Burchell's arms for protection. The gentleman came up, and asked pardon for having disturbed us, affirming that he was ignorant of our being so near. He therefore sate down by my youngest daughter, and, sportsman like, offered her what he had killed that morn∣ing. She was going to refuse, but a pri∣vate look from her mother soon induced her to correct the mistake, and accept his present, though with some reluctance. My wife, as usual, discovered her pride in a whisper, observing, that Sophy had
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
made a conquest of the chaplain, as well as her sister had of the 'Squire. I suspected, however, with more proba∣bility, that her affections were placed upon a different object. The chap∣lain's errand was to inform us, that Mr. Thornhill had provided music and refreshments, and intended that night giving the young ladies a ball by moon∣light, on the grass-plot before our door. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nor can I deny,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but I have an interest in being first to deliver this message, as I expect for my reward to be honoured with miss Sophy's hand as a partner."</Q> To this my girl re∣plied, that she should have no objection, if she could do it with honour: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But here,"</Q> continued she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is a gentleman,"</Q> looking at Mr. Burchell, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"who has been my com∣panion in the task for the day, and it is fit he should share in its amusements."</Q> Mr. Burchell returned her a compliment for her intentions; but resigned her up to the chaplain, adding that he was to go that night five miles, being invited
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
to an harvest supper. His refusal appeared to me a little extraordinary, nor could I con∣ceive how so sensible a girl as my youngest, could thus prefer a middle aged man of broken fortune to a sprightly young fellow of twenty-two. But as men are most capable of distin∣guishing merit in women, so the ladies often form the truest judgments upon us. The two sexes seem placed as spies upon each other, and are furnished with different abi∣lities, adapted for mutual inspection.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Two ladies of great distinction introduced. Superior finery ever seems to confer su∣perior breeding.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. Burchell had scarce taken leave, and Sophia consented to dance with the chaplain, when my little ones came running out to tell us that the 'Squire was come, with a crowd of company. Upon our return, we found our landlord, with a couple of under gentlemen and two young ladies richly drest, whom he introduced as women of very great distinction and fashi∣on from town. We happened not to have chairs enough for the whole company; but Mr. Thornhill immediately proposed that every gentleman should sit in a lady's lap.
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
This I positively objected to, notwithstand∣ing a look of disapprobation from my wife. Moses was therefore dispatched to borrow a couple of chairs; and as we were in want of ladies also to make up a set at country dances, the two gentlemen went with him in quest of a couple of partners. Chairs and partners were soon provided. The gentlemen returned with my neigh∣bour Flamborough's rosy daughters, flaunt∣ing with red top-knots. But there was an unlucky circumstance which was not adverted to; though the Miss Flambo∣roughs were reckoned the very best dan∣cers in the parish, and understood the jig and the round-about to perfection; yet they were totally unacquainted with country dances. This at first discomposed us: however, after a little shoving and drag∣ging, they began to go merrily on. Our music consisted of two fiddles, with a pipe and tabor. The moon shone bright, Mr. Thornhill and my eldest daughter led up the ball, to the great delight of the
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
spectators; for the neighbours hearing what was going forward, came flocking about us. My girl moved with so much grace and vi∣vacity, that my wife could not avoid disco∣vering the pride of her heart, by assuring me, that though the little chit did it so cle∣verly, all the steps were stolen from herself. The ladies of the town strove hard to be equally easy, but without success. They swam, sprawled, languished, and frisked; but all would not do: the gazers in∣deed owned that it was fine; but neighbour Flamborough observed, that Miss Livy's feet seemed as pat to the music as its echo. After the dance had continued about an hour, the two ladies, who were apprehen∣sive of catching cold, moved to break up the ball. One of them, I thought, expres∣sed her sentiments upon this occasion in a very coarse manner, when she observed, that by the <HI>living jingo,</HI> she was all of a muck of sweat. Upon our return to the house, we found a very elegant cold supper, which Mr. Thornhill had ordered to be brought
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
with him. The conversation at this time was more reserved than before. The two ladies threw my girls quite into the shade; for they would talk of nothing but high life, and high lived company; with other fashionable to∣pics, such as pictures, taste, Shakespear, and the musical glasses. 'Tis true they once or twice mortified us sensibly by slipping out an oath; but that appeared to me as the surest symptom of their distinction, (tho' I am since informed swearing is now perfectly unfashi∣onable.) Their finery, however, threw a veil over any grossness in their conversation. My daughters seemed to regard their superior ac∣complishments with envy; and what appeared amiss was ascribed to tip-top quality breed∣ing. But the condescension of the ladies was still superior to their other accomplishments. One of them observed, that had miss Oli∣via seen a little more of the world, it would greatly improve her. To which the other added, that a single winter in town would make her little Sophia quite another thing. My wife warmly assented to both; adding,
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
that there was nothing she more ardently wished than to give her girls a single win∣ter's polishing. To this I could not help replying, that their breeding was already superior to their fortune; and that greater refinement would only serve to make their poverty ridiculous, and give them a taste for pleasures they had no right to possess.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And what pleasures,"</Q> cried Mr. Thornhill, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"do they not deserve, who have so much in their power to bestow? As for my part,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"my fortune is pretty large, love, liberty, and pleasure, are my maxims; but curse me if a settlement of half my estate could give my charming Olivia pleasure, it should be hers; and the only favour I would ask in return would be to add myself to the benefit."</Q> I was not such a stranger to the world as to be ignorant that this was the fashionable cant to disguise the inso∣lence of the basest proposal; but I made an effort to suppress my resentment. <Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the family which you now con∣descend
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
to favour with your company, has been bred with as nice a sense of honour as you. Any attempts to injure that, may be attended with very dange∣rous consequences. Honour, Sir, is our only possession at present, and of that last treasure we must be particularly careful."</Q>—I was soon sorry for the warmth with which I had spoken this, when the young gentleman, grasping my hand, swore he commended my spirit, though he disapproved my suspicions. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As to your present hint,"</Q> continued he, I protest <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"nothing was farther from my heart than such a thought. No, by all that's tempt∣ing, the virtue that will stand a regular siege was never to my taste; for all my amours are carried by a coup de main."</Q></P>
<P>The two ladies, who affected to be ig∣norant of the rest, seemed highly displeased with this last stroke of freedom, and be∣gan a very discreet and serious dialogue
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
upon virtue: in this my wife, the chaplain, and I, soon joined; and the 'Squire him∣self was at last brought to confess a sense of sorrow for his former excesses. We talked of the pleasures of temperance, and the sun-shine in the mind unpolluted with guilt. I was well pleased that my little ones were kept up beyond the usual time to be edified by such good conversation. Mr. Thornhill even went beyond me, and demanded if I had any objection to giv∣ing prayers. I joyfully embraced the pro∣posal, and in this manner the night was passed in a most comfortable way, till at last the company began to think of return∣ing. The ladies seemed very unwilling to part from my daughters; for whom they had conceived a particular affection, and joined in a request to have the pleasure of their company home. The 'Squire second∣ed the proposal, and my wife added her entreaties: the girls too looked upon me as if they wished to go. In this perplexity I
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
made two or three excuses, which my daughters as readily removed; so that at last I was obliged to give a peremptory re∣fusal; for which we had nothing but sullen looks and short answers the whole day en∣suing.</P>

<P>The family endeavours to cope with their betters. The miseries of the poor when they attempt to appear above their cir∣cumstances.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Now began to find that all my long and painful lectures upon temperance, sim∣plicity, and contentment, were entirely dis∣regarded. The distinctions lately paid us by our betters awaked that pride which I had laid asleep, but not removed. Our windows now again, as formerly, were filled with washes for the neck and face. The sun was dreaded as an enemy to the skin without doors, and the fire as a spoiler of the complexion within. My wife observed, that rising too early would hurt her daugh∣ter's eyes, that working after dinner would redden their noses, and convinced me that
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
the hands never looked so white as when they did nothing. Instead therefore of fi∣nishing George's shirts, we now had them new modelling their old gauzes, or flourish∣ing upon catgut. The poor Miss Flambo∣roughs, their former gay companions, were cast off as mean acquaintance, and the whole conversation ran upon high life and high lived company, with pictures, taste, Shakespear, and the musical glasses.</P>
<P>But we could have borne all this, had not a fortune-telling gypsey come to raise us into perfect sublimity. The tawny sybil no sooner appeared, than my girls came running to me for a shilling a piece to cross her hand with silver. To say the truth, I was tired of being always wise, and could not help gratifying their request, because I loved to see them happy. I gave each of them a shilling; though, for the honour of the fa∣mily, it must be observed, that they never went without money themselves, as my wife always generously let them have a guinea each, to keep in their pockets; but with strict
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
injunctions never to change it. After they had been closetted up with the fortune-teller for some time, I knew by their looks, upon their returning, that they had been promised something great.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, my girls, how have you sped? Tell me, Livy, has the fortune-teller given thee a pennyworth?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I protest, pappa,"</Q> says the girl, with a serious face, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I be∣lieve she deals with some body that's not right; for she positively declared, that I am to be married to a great 'Squire in less than a twelvemonth?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well now, Sophy, my child,"</Q> said I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and what sort of a husband are you to have?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> replied she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am to have a Lord soon after my sister has been married to the 'Squire."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">How,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is that all you are to have for your two shil∣lings! Only a Lord and a 'Squire for two shillings! You fools, I could have promised you a Prince and a Nabob for half the money."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94"/>
This curiosity of theirs, however, was at∣tended with very serious effects: we now began to think ourselves designed by the stars for something exalted, and already an∣ticipated our future grandeur.</P>
<P>It has been a thousand times observed, and I must observe it once more, that the hours we pass with happy prospects in view, are more pleasing than those crowned with fruition. In the first case we cook the dish to our own appetite; in the latter nature cooks it for us. It is impossible to repeat the train of agreeable reveries we called up for our entertainment. We looked upon our fortunes as once more rising; and as the whole parish asserted that the 'Squire was in love with my daughter, she was ac∣tually so with him; for they persuaded her into passion. In this agreeable interval, my wife had the most lucky dreams in the world, which she took care to tell us every morning, with great solemnity and exact∣ness. It was one night a coffin and cross
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
bones, the sign of an approaching wedding: at another time she imagined her daugh∣ter's pockets filled with farthings, a certain sign of their being one day stuffed with gold. The girls had their omens too: they felt strange kisses on their lips; they saw rings in the candle, purses bounced from the fire, and true love-knots lurked at the bottom of every tea-cup.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the week we receiv∣ed a card from the town ladies; in which, with their compliments, they hoped to see all our family at church the Sunday follow∣ing. All Saturday morning I could per∣ceive, in consequence of this, my wife and daughters in close conference together, and now and then glancing at me with looks that betrayed a latent plot. To be sincere, I had strong suspicions that some absurd proposal was preparing for appearing with splendor the next day. In the evening they began their operations in a very regular man∣ner, and my wife undertook to conduct the
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
siege. After tea, when I seemed in spirits, she began thus.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I fancy, Charles, my dear, we shall have a great deal of good compa∣ny at our church to-morrow."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Perhaps we may, my dear,"</Q> returned I; though <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you need be under no uneasiness about that, you shall have a sermon whether there be or not."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That is what I expect,"</Q> returned she; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but I think, my dear, we ought to appear there as decently as pos∣sible, for who knows what may happen?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your precautions,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"are high∣ly commendable. A decent behaviour and appearance in church is what charms me. We should be devout and humble, chearful and serene."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> cried she <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I know that; but I mean we should go there in as proper a manner as possible; not altogether like the scrubs about us."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You are quite right, my dear,"</Q> returned I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and I was going to make the very same proposal. The proper manner of going is, to go there as early as possible, to have time for meditation before the
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
service begins."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Phoo, Charles,"</Q> interrupted she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"all that is very true; but not what I would be at. I mean, we should go there genteelly. You know the church is two miles off, and I protest I don't like to see my daughters trudging up to their pew all blowzed and red with walking, and looking for all the world as if they had been winners at a smock race. Now, my dear, my proposal is this: there are our two plow horses, the Colt that has been in our family these nine years, and his companion Black∣berry, that have scarce done an earthly thing for this month past, and are both grown fat and lazy. Why should not they do something as well as we? And let me tell you, when Moses has trimmed them a little, they will not be so con∣temptible."</Q></P>
<P>To this proposal I objected, that walk∣ing would be twenty times more genteel than such a paltry conveyance, as Black∣berry was wall-eyed, and the Colt wanted a
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
tail: that they had never been broke to the rein; but had an hundred vicious tricks; and that we had but one saddle and pillion in the whole house. All these objections, however, were over-ruled; so that I was obliged to comply. The next morning I perceived them not a little busy in collecting such materials as might be ne∣cessary for the expedition; but as I found it would be a business of much time, I walked on to the church before, and they promised speedily to follow. I waited near an hour in the reading desk for their arrival; but not finding them come as expected, I was obliged to begin, and went through the ser∣vice, not without some uneasiness at find∣ing them absent. This was encreased when all was finished, and no appearance of the family. I therefore walked back by the horse-way, which was five miles round, tho' the foot-way was but two, and when got about half way home, perceived the proces∣sion marching slowly forward towards the church; my son, my wife, and the two
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
little ones exalted upon one horse, and my two daughters upon the other. I demand∣ed the cause of their delay; but I soon found by their looks they had met with a thousand misfortunes on the road. The horses had at first refused to move from the door, till Mr. Burchell was kind enough to beat them forward for about two hundred yards with his cudgel. Next the straps of my wife's pillion broke down, and they were obliged to stop to repair them before they could proceed. After that, one of the horses took it into his head to stand still, and neither blows nor entreaties could pre∣vail with him to proceed. It was just re∣covering from this dismal situation that I found them; but perceiving every thing safe, I own their present mortification did not much displease me, as it might give me many opportunities of future triumph, and teach my daughters more humility.</P>

<P>The family still resolve to hold up their heads.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MICHAELMAS eve happening on the next day, we were invited to burn nuts and play tricks at neighbour Flamborough's. Our late mortifications had humbled us a little, or it is probable we might have rejected such an invitation with contempt: however, we suffered our∣selves to be happy. Our honest neigh∣bour's goose and dumplings were fine, and the lamb's-wool, even in the opinion of my wife, who was a connoiseur, was thought excellent. It is true, his man∣ner of telling stories was not quite so well. They were very long, and very dull, and all about himself, and we had laughed at
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>
them ten times before: however, we were kind enough to laugh at them once more.</P>
<P>Mr. Burchell, who was of the party, was always fond of seeing some innocent amuse∣ment going forward, and set the boys and girls to blind man's buff. My wife too was persuaded to join in the diversion, and it gave me pleasure to think she was not yet too old. In the mean time, my neighbour and I looked on, laughed at every feat, and prais∣ed our own dexterity when we were young. Hot cockles succeeded next, questions and commands followed that, and last of all, they sate down to hunt the slipper. As every per∣son may not be acquainted with this primaeval pastime, it may be necessary to observe, that the company at this play plant themselves in a ring upon the ground, all, except one who stands in the middle, whose business it is to catch a shoe, which the company shove about under their hams from one to another, something like a weaver's shuttle. As it is impossible, in this case, for the lady who
<PB N="101" REF="102"/>
is up to face all the company at once, the great beauty of the play lies in hitting her a thump with the heel of the shoe on that side least capable of making a defence. It was in this manner that my eldest daughter was hemmed in, and thumped about, all blowzed, in spirits, and bawling for fair play, fair play, with a voice that might deafen a ballad singer, when confusion on confusion, who should enter the room but our two great acquaintances from town, Lady Blarney and Miss Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs! Description would but beggar, therefore it is unnecessary to de∣scribe this new mortification Death! To be seen by ladies of such high breeding in such vulgar attitudes!. Nothing better could ensue from such a vulgar play of Mr. Flamborough's proposing. We seemed stuck to the ground for some time, as if actually petrified with amazement.</P>
<P>The two ladies had been at our house to see us, and finding us from home, came after us hither, as they were uneasy to know
<PB N="102" REF="103"/>
what accident could have kept us from church the day before. Olivia undertook to be our prolocutor, and delivered the whole in a summary way, only saying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We were thrown from our horses."</Q> At which ac∣count the ladies were greatly concerned; but being told the family received no hurt, they were extremely glad: but being in∣formed that we were almost killed by the fright, they were vastly sorry; but hearing that we had a very good night, they were extremely glad again. Nothing could ex∣ceed their complaisance to my daughters; their professions the last evening were warm, but now they were ardent. They protested a desire of having a more lasting acquain∣tance. Lady Blarney was particularly at∣tached to Olivia; Miss Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs (I love to give the whole name) took a greater fancy to her sister. They supported the conversation between themselves, while my daughters sate silent, admiring their exalted breeding. But as every reader, however beggarly himself, is
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
fond of high-lived dialogues, with anecdotes of Lords, Ladies, and Knights of the Gar∣ter, I must beg leave to give him the con∣cluding part of the present conversation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All that I know of the matter,"</Q> cried Miss Skeggs, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is this, that it may be true, or it may not be true: but this I can as∣sure your Ladyship, that the whole rout was in amaze; his Lordship turned all manner of colours, my Lady fell into a swoon; but Sir Tomkyn, drawing his sword, swore he was her's to the last drop of his blood."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> replied our Peeress, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this I can say, that the Dutchess never told me a syllable of the matter, and I be∣lieve her Grace would keep nothing a se∣cret from me. But this you may de∣pend upon as fact, that the next morn∣ing my Lord Duke cried out three times to his valet de chambre, Jerni∣gan, Jernigan, Jernigan, bring me my garters."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="105"/>
But previously I should have mentioned the very impolite behaviour of Mr. Bur∣chell, who, during this discourse, sate with his face turned to the fire, and at the con∣clusion of every sentence would cry out <HI>fudge,</HI> an expression which displeased us all, and in some measure damped the rising spirit of the conversation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Besides, my dear Skeggs,"</Q> continued our Peeress, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">there is nothing of this in the copy of verses that Dr. Burdock made upon the occasion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am surprised at that,"</Q> cried Miss Skeggs;" <Q REND="inline margQuotes">for he seldom leaves any thing out, as he writes only for his own amuse∣ment. But can your Ladyship favour me with a sight of them?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear creature,"</Q> replied our Peeress, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"do you think I carry such things about me? Though they are very fine to be sure, and I think myself something of a judge; at least I know what pleases my∣self.
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
Indeed I was ever an admirer of all Doctor Burdock's little pieces; for except what he does, and our dear Coun∣tess at Hanover-Square, there's nothing comes out but the most lowest stuff in nature; not a bit of high life among them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your Ladyship should except,"</Q> says t'other, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"your own things in the Lady's Magazine. I hope you'll say there's no∣thing low lived there? But I suppose we are to have no more from that quar∣ter?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, my dear,"</Q> says the Lady, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you know my reader and companion has left me, to be married to Captain Roach, and as my poor eyes won't suffer me to write myself, I have been for some time looking out for another. A proper per∣son is no easy matter to find, and to be sure thirty pounds a year is a small sti∣pend for a well-bred girl of character,

that can read, write, and behave in company; as for the chits about town, there is no bearing them about one."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That I know,"</Q> cried Miss Skeggs, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"by experience. For of the three com∣panions I had this last half year, one of them refused to do plain-work an hour in the day, another thought twenty-five guineas a year too small a sa∣lary, and I was obliged to send away the third, because I suspected an intrigue with the chaplain. Virtue, my dear La∣dy Blarney, virtue is worth any price; but where is that to be found?"</Q></P>
<P>My wife had been for a long time all attention to this discourse; but was particu∣larly struck with the latter part of it. Thirty pounds and twenty-five guineas a year made fifty-six pounds five shillings English money, all which was in a manner going a-begging, and might easily be secured in
<PB N="107" REF="110"/>
the family. She for a moment studied my looks for approbation; and, to own a truth, I was of opinion, that two such places would fit our two daughters ex∣actly. Besides, if the 'Squire had any real affection for my eldest daughter, this would be the way to make her every way qualified for her fortune. My wife there∣fore was resolved that we should not be de∣prived of such advantages for want of assu∣rance, and undertook to harangue for the family. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I hope,"</Q> cried she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"your Lady∣ships will pardon my present presump∣tion. It is true, we have no right to pretend to such favours; but yet it is na∣tural for me to wish putting my children forward in the world. And I will be bold to say my two girls have had a pret∣ty good education, and capacity, at least the country can't shew better. They can read, write, and cast accompts; they un∣derstand their needle, breadstitch, cross and change, and all manner of plain-work; they can pink, point, and frill;
<PB N="108" REF="111"/>
and know something of music; they can do up small cloaths, work upon catgut; my eldest can cut paper, and my youngest has a very pretty manner of telling fortunes upon the cards."</Q></P>
<P>When she had delivered this pretty piece of eloquence, the two ladies looked at each other a few minutes in silence, with an air of doubt and importance. At last, Miss Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs condescended to observe, that the young ladies, from the opinion she could form of them from so slight an acquaintance, seem∣ed very fit for such employments: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But a thing of this kind, Madam,"</Q> cried she, addressing my spouse, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"requires a thorough examination into characters, and a more perfect knowledge of each other. Not, Madam,"</Q> continued she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I in the least suspect the young ladies virtue, pru∣dence and discretion; but there is a form in these things, Madam, there is a form."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="112"/>
My wife approved her suspicions very much, observing, that she was very apt to be suspicious herself; but referred her to all the neighbours for a character: but this our Peeress declined as unnecessary, alledg∣ing that her cousin Thornhill's recommen∣dation would be sufficient, and upon this we rested our petition.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Fortune seems resolved to humble the fa∣mily of Wakefield. Mortifications are often more painful than real calamities.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN we were returned home, the night was dedicated to schemes of future conquest. Deborah exerted much sagacity in conjecturing which of the two girls was likely to have the best place, and most opportunities of seeing good compa∣ny. The only obstacle to our preferment was in obtaining the 'Squire's recommenda∣tion; but he had already shewn us too many instances of his friendship to doubt of it now. Even in bed my wife kept up the usual theme: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, faith, my dear Charles, between ourselves, I think we have made an excellent day's work of
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
it."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pretty well,"</Q> cried I, not knowing what to say.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What only pretty well?"</Q> returned she. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I think it is very well. Suppose the girls should come to make acquaintances of taste in town! And this I am assured of, that London is the only place in the world for all man∣ner of husbands. Besides, my dear, stranger things happen every day: and as ladies of quality are so taken with my daughters, what will not men of quality be! Entre nous, I protest I like my Lady Blarney vastly, so very obliging. However, Miss Carolina Wilelmina Ame∣lia Skeggs has my warm heart. But yet, when they came to talk of places in town, you saw at once how I nailed them. Tell me, my dear, don't you think I did for my children there?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Ay,"</Q> re∣turned I, not knowing well what to think of the matter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"heaven grant they may be both the better for it this day three months!"</Q> This was one of those obser∣vations I usually made to impress my wife with an opinion of my sagacity; for if the
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
girls succeeded, then it was a pious wish fulfilled; but if any thing unfortunate en∣sued, then it might be looked upon as a prophecy. All this conversation, however, was only preparatory to another scheme, and indeed I dreaded as much. This was nothing less than, that as we were now to hold up our heads a little higher in the world, it would be proper to sell the Colt, which was grown old, at a neighbour∣ing fair, and buy us an horse that would carry single or double upon an occasion, and make a pretty appearance at church or upon a visit. This at first I opposed stout∣ly; but it was as stoutly defended. How∣ever, as I weakened, my antagonist gained strength, till at last it was resolved to 'part with him.</P>
<P>As the fair happened on the following day, I had intentions of going myself; but my wife persuaded me that I had got a cold, and nothing could prevail upon her to permit me from home. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, my dear,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"our son Moses is a discreet boy,
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
and can buy and sell to very good ad∣vantage; you know all our great bar∣gains are of his purchasing. He always stands out and higgles, and actually tires them till he gets a bargain."</Q></P>
<P>As I had some opinion of my son's pru∣dence, I was willing enough to entrust him with this commission; and the next morning I perceived his sisters mighty busy in fitting out Moses for the fair; trimming his hair, brushing his buckles, and cocking his hat with pins. The business of the toilet be∣ing over, we had at last the satisfaction of seeing him mounted upon the Colt, with a deal box before him to bring home gro∣ceries in. He had on a coat made of that cloth they call thunder and lightning, which, though grown too short, was much too good to be thrown away. His waistcoat was of gosling green, and his sis∣ters had tied his hair with a broad black ribband. We all followed him several paces from the door, bawling after him
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
good luck, good luck, till we could see him no longer.</P>
<P>He was scarce gone, when Mr. Thorn∣hill's butler came to congratulate us upon our good fortune, saying, that he over∣heard his young master mention our names with great commendations.</P>
<P>Good fortune seemed resolved not to come alone. Another footman from the same family followed, with a card for my daughters, importing, that the two ladies had received such a pleasing account from Mr. Thornhill of us all, that, after a few previous enquiries more, they hoped to be perfectly satisfied. <Q REND="inline">"Ay,"</Q> cried my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I now see it is no easy matter to get into the families of the great; but when one once gets in, then, as Moses says, they may go sleep."</Q> To this piece of humour, for she intended it for wit, my daughters assented with a loud laugh of pleasure. In short, such was her satisfaction at this mes∣sage, that she actually put her hand to her
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
pocket, and gave the messenger seven-pence halfpenny.</P>
<P>This was to be our visiting-day. The next that came was Mr. Burchell, who had been at the fair. He brought my little ones a pennyworth of gingerbread each, which my wife undertook to keep for them, and give them by letters at a time. He brought my daughters also a couple of boxes, in which they might keep wafers, snuff, patches, or even money, when they got it. My wife was usually fond of a weesel skin purse, as being the most lucky; but this by the bye. We had still a regard for Mr. Burchell, though his late rude be∣haviour was in some measure displeasing; nor could we now avoid communicating our happiness to him, and asking his ad∣vice: although we seldom followed ad∣vice, we were all ready enough to ask it. When he read the note from the two ladies, he shook his head, and observed, that an af∣fair of this sort demanded the utmost cir∣cumspection.—This air of diffidence
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
highly displeased my wife. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I never doubted, Sir,"</Q> cried she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"your readi∣ness to be against my daughters and me. You have more circumspection than is wanted. However, I fancy when we come to ask advice, we will apply to per∣sons who seem to have made use of it themselves."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whatever my own conduct may have been, madam,"</Q> re∣plied he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is not the present question; tho' as I have made no use of advice myself, I should in conscience give it to those that will."</Q>—As I was apprehen∣sive this answer might draw on a repartee, making up by abuse what it wanted in wit, I changed the subject, by seeming to won∣der what could keep our son so long at the fair, as it was now almost night-fall.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Never mind our son,"</Q> cried my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"depend upon it he knows what he is about. I'll warrant we'll never see him sell his hen of a rainy day. I have seen him buy such bargains as would amaze one. I'll tell you a good story about that, that will make you split your sides
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
with laughing—But as I live, yonder comes Moses, without an horse, and the box at his back."</Q></P>
<P>As she spoke, Moses came slowly on foot, and sweating under the deal box, which he had strapt round his shoulders.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Welcome, welcome, Moses; well, my boy, what have you brought us from the fair?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have brought you myself,"</Q> cried Moses, with a sly look, and resting the box on the dresser.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, Moses,"</Q> cried my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that we know, but where is the horse?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have sold him,"</Q> cried Moses, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for three pounds five shillings and two-pence."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well done, my good boy,"</Q> returned she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I knew you would touch them off. Between our∣selves, three pounds five shillings and two-pence is no bad day's work. Come, let us have it then."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have brought back no money,"</Q> cried Moses again. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">I have laid it all out in a bargain, and here it is,"</Q> pulling out a bundle from his breast: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"here they are; a groce of
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
green spectacles, with silver rims and shagreen cases."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A groce of green spectacles!"</Q> repeated my wife in a faint voice. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And you have parted with the Colt, and brought us back nothing but a groce of green paltry spectacles!"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dear mother,"</Q> cried the boy, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"why won't you listen to reason? I had them a dead bargain, or I should not have bought them. The silver rims alone will sell for double the mo∣ney."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A fig for the silver rims,"</Q> cried my wife, in a passion: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I dare swear they won't sell for above half the money at the rate of broken silver, five shillings an ounce."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You need be under no uneasiness,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"about selling the rims; for I perceive they are only copper varnished over."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"What,"</Q> cried my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not silver, the rims not silver!"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"no more silver than your sauce-pan."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And so,"</Q> returned she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we have parted with the Colt, and have only got a groce of green spectacles, with copper rims
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
and shagreen cases! A murrain take such trumpery. The blockhead has been imposed upon, and should have known his company better."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There, my dear,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you are wrong, he should not have known them at all."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Marry, hang the ideot,"</Q> returned she again, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to bring me such stuff, if I had them, I would throw them in the fire."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There again you are wrong, my dear,"</Q> cried I; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for though they be copper, we will keep them by us, as copper specta∣cles, you know, are better than no∣thing."</Q></P>
<P>By this time the unfortunate Moses was undeceived. He now saw that he had in∣deed been imposed upon by a prowling sharper, who, observing his figure, had marked him for an easy prey. I therefore asked the circumstances of his deception. He sold the horse, it seems, and walked the fair in search of another. A reverend looking man brought him to a tent, under
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
a pretence of having one to sell. <Q REND="inline">"Here,"</Q> continued Moses, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we met another man, very well drest, who desired to borrow twenty pounds upon these, saying, that he wanted money, and would dispose of them for a third of the value. The first gentleman, who pretended to be my friend, whispered me to buy them, and cautioned me not to let so good an offer pass. I sent for Mr. Flamborough, and they talked him up as finely as they did me, and so at last we were persuaded to buy the two groce between us."</Q></P>

<P>OUR family had now made several at∣tempts to be fine; but some unforeseen disaster demolished each as soon as project∣ed. I endeavoured to take the advantage of every disappointment, to improve their good sense in proportion as they were frus∣trated in ambition. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You see, my chil∣dren,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"how little is to be got by attempts to impose upon the world, in coping with our betters.

to the weaker side: the rich having the pleasure, and the poor the inconveniencies that result from them. But come, Dick, my boy, and repeat the fable that you were reading to-day, for the good of the company."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Once upon a time,"</Q> cried the child, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a Giant and a Dwarf were friends, and kept together. They made a bar∣gain that they would never forsake each other, but go seek adventures. The first battle they fought was with two Saracens, and the Dwarf, who was very courageous, dealt one of the champions a most angry blow. It did the Saracen but very little injury, who lifting up his sword, fairly struck off the poor Dwarf's arm. He was now in a woeful plight; but the Giant coming to his assistance, in a short time left the two Saracens dead on the plain, and the Dwarf cut off the dead man's head out of spite. They then travelled on to another adventure. This was against three bloody-minded
<PB N="125" REF="126"/>
Satyrs, who were carrying away a dam∣sel in distress. The Dwarf was not quite so fierce now as before; but for all that, struck the first blow, which was returned by another, that knocked out his eye: but the Giant was soon up with them, and had they not fled, would certainly have killed them every one. They were all very joyful for this victo∣ry, and the damsel who was relieved fell in love with the Giant, and married him. They now travelled far, and farther than I can tell, till they met with a company of robbers. The Giant, for the first time, was foremost now; but the Dwarf was not far behind. The battle was stout and long. Wherever the Giant came all fell before him; but the Dwarf had like to have been killed more than once. At last the victory declared for the two adventurers; but the Dwarf lost his leg. The Dwarf was now without an arm, a leg, and an eye, while the Giant, who was without a sin∣gle wound, cried out to him, Come
<PB N="126" REF="127"/>
on, my little heroe; this is glorious sport; let us get one victory more, and then we shall have honour for ever. No, cries the Dwarf, who was by this time grown wiser, no, I declare off; I'll fight no more: for I find in every battle that you get all the honour and rewards, but all the blows fall upon me."</Q></P>
<P>I was going to moralize this fable, when our attention was called off to a warm dis∣pute between my wife and Mr. Burchell, upon my daughters intended expedition to town. My wife very strenuously insisted upon the advantages that would result from it. Mr. Burchell, on the contrary, dis∣suaded her with great ardor, and I stood neuter. His present dissuasions seemed but the second part of those which were re∣ceived with so ill a grace in the morning. The dispute grew high, while poor De∣borah, instead of reasoning stronger, talked louder, and at last was obliged to take shelter from a defeat in clamour. The
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
conclusion of her harangue, however, was highly displeasing to us all: she knew, she said, of some who had their own secret reasons for what they advised; but, for her part, she wished such to stay away from her house for the future.—<Q REND="inline">"Madam,"</Q> cried Burchell, with looks of great compo∣sure, which tended to enflame her the more, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as for secret reasons, you are right: I have secret reasons, which I forbear to mention, because you are not able to an∣swer those of which I make no secret: but I find my visits here are become trouble∣some; I'll take my leave therefore now, and perhaps come once more to take a final farewell when I am quitting the coun∣try."</Q> Thus saying, he took up his hat, nor could the attempts of Sophia, whose looks seemed to upbraid his preci∣pitancy, prevent his going.</P>
<P>When gone, we all regarded each other for some minutes with confusion. My wife, who knew herself to be the cause, strove to hide her concern with a forced smile,
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
and an air of assurance, which I was willing to reprove: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How, woman,"</Q> cried I to her, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is it thus we treat strangers? Is it thus we return their kindness? Be assured, my dear, that these were the harshest words, and to me the most unpleasing that ever escaped your lips!"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why would he provoke me then,"</Q> replied she; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but I know the motives of his advice per∣fectly well. He would prevent my girls from going to town, that he may have the pleasure of my youngest daughter's company here at home. But whatever hap∣pens, she shall chuse better company than such low-lived fellows as he."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Low-lived, my dear, do you call him,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is very possible we may mistake this man's character: for he seems upon some occasions the most finished gentleman I ever knew.—Tell me, Sophia, my girl, has he ever given you any secret instances of his attachment?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"His conversation with me, sir,"</Q> replied my daughter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"has ever been sensible, mo∣dest,
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>
and pleasing. As to aught else, no, never. Once, indeed, I remember to have heard him say he never knew a wo∣man who could find merit in a man that seemed poor."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Such, my dear,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is the common cant of all the unfortunate or idle. But I hope you have been taught to judge properly of such men, and that it would be even madness to expect happiness from one who has been so very bad an oeconomist of his own. Your mother and I have now better prospects for you. The next winter, which you will probably spend in town, will give you opportunities of making a more prudent choice."</Q></P>
<P>What Sophia's reflections were upon this occasion, I can't pretend to determine; but I was not displeased at the bottom that we were rid of a guest from whom I had much to fear. Our breach of hospitality went to my conscience a little: but I quickly silenced that monitor by two or three specious reasons, which served to
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
satisfy and reconcile me to myself. The pain which conscience gives the man who has already done wrong, is soon got over. Conscience is a coward, and those faults it has not strength enough to prevent, it seldom has justice enough to punish by accusing.</P>

<P>Fresh mortifications, or a demonstration that seeming calamities may be real blessings.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE journey of my daughters to town was now resolved upon, Mr. Thorn∣hill having kindly promised to inspect their conduct himself, and inform us by letter of their behaviour. But it was thought indis∣pensably necessary that their appearance should equal the greatness of their expec∣tations, which could not be done without some expence. We debated therefore in full council what were the easiest methods of raising money, or, more properly speaking, what we could most conve∣niently sell. The deliberation was soon finished, it was found that our remaining
<PB N="132" REF="133"/>
horse was utterly useless for the plow, with∣out his companion, and equally unfit for the road, as wanting an eye, it was there∣fore determined that we should dispose of him for the purposes above-mentioned, at the neighbouring fair, and, to prevent im∣position, that I should go with him myself. Though this was one of the first mercan∣tile transactions of my life, yet I had no doubt about acquitting myself with reputa∣tion. The opinion a man forms of his own prudence is measured by that of the company he keeps, and as mine was most∣ly in the family way, I had conceived no unfavourable sentiments of my worldly wis∣dom. My wife, however, next morning, at parting, after I had got some paces from the door, called me back, to advise me, in a whisper, to have all my eyes about me.</P>
<P>I had, in the usual forms, when I came to the fair, put my horse through all his paces; but for some time had no bidders. At last a
<PB N="133" REF="134"/>
chapman approached, and, after he had for a good while examined the horse round, finding him blind of one eye, would have nothing to say to him: a second came up; but observing he had a spavin, de∣clared he would not take him for the driv∣ing home: a third perceived he had a windgall, and would bid no money: a fourth knew by his eye that he had the botts: a fifth, more impertinent than all the rest, wondered what a plague I could do to the fair with a blind, spavined, galled hack, that was only fit to be cut up for a dog kennel. By this time I began to have a most hearty contempt for the poor animal myself, and was almost ashamed at the approach of every new customer; for though I did not entirely believe all the fellows told me; yet I reflected that the number of witnesses was a strong presump∣tion they were right, and St. Gregory, up∣on good works, professes himself to be of the same opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="135"/>
I was in this mortifying situation, when a brother clergyman, an old acquain∣tance, who had also business to the fair, came up, and shaking me by the hand, proposed adjourning to a public-house and taking a glass of whatever we could get. I readily closed with the offer, and entering an ale-house, we were shewn into a little back room, where there was only a venera∣ble old man, who sat wholly intent over a large book, which he was reading. I ne∣ver in my life saw a figure that pre∣possed me more favourably. His locks of silver grey venerably shaded his temples, and his green old age seemed to be the result of health and benevolence. However, his pre∣sence did not interrupt our conversation; my friend and I discoursed on the various turns of fortune we had met: the Whistonean con∣troversy, my last pamphlet, the archdea∣con's reply, and the hard measure that was dealt me. But our attention was in a short time taken off by the appearance of a youth, who, entering the room, respectfully said some∣thing
<PB N="135" REF="136"/>
softly to the old stranger. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Make no apoligies, my child,"</Q> said the old man, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to do good is a duty we owe to all our fellow creatures: take this, I wish it were more; but five pounds will relieve your distress, and you are welcome."</Q> The modest youth shed tears of gratitude, and yet his gratitude was scarce equal to mine. I could have hugged the good old man in my arms, his benevolence pleased me so. He conti∣nued to read, and we resumed our conver∣sation, until my companion, after some time, recollecting that he had business to transact in the fair, promised to be soon back; adding, that he always desired to have as much of Dr. Primrose's company as possible. The old gentleman, hearing my name mentioned, seemed to look at me with attention, and when my friend was gone, most respectfully demanded if I was any way related to the great Primrose, that couragious monogamist, who had been the bulwark of the church. Never did my heart feel sincerer rapture than at that mo∣ment,
<PB N="136" REF="137"/>
<Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the applause of so good a man, as I am sure you are, adds to that happiness in my breast which your benevolence has already excited. You behold before you, Sir, that Doctor Primrose, the monogamist, whom you have been pleased to call great. You here see that unfortunate Divine, who has so long, and it would ill become me to say, successfully, fought against the deuterogamy of the age."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> cried the stranger, struck with awe, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I fear I have been too familiar; but you'll for∣give my curiosity, Sir: I beg pardon."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> cried I, grasping his hand, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you are so far from displeasing me by your familiarity, that I must beg you'll accept my friendship, as you already have all my esteem."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then with gratitude I accept the offer,"</Q> cried he, squeezing me by the hand, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"thou glorious pillar of unshaken orthodoxy;"</Q> and do I behold—I here interrupted what he was going to say; for tho', as an author, I could digest
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
no small share of flattery, yet now my mo∣desty would permit no more. However, no lovers in romance ever cemented a more instantaneous friendship. We talked upon several subjects: at first I thought he seemed rather devout than learned, and began to think he despised all human doctrines as dross. Yet this no way lessened him in my esteem; for I had for some time be∣gun privately to harbour such an opinion myself. I therefore took occasion to observe, that the world in general began to be blamebly indifferent as to doctrinal matters, and followed human speculations too much—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, Sir,"</Q> replied he, as if he had reserved all his learning to that moment, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, Sir, the world is in its dotage, and yet the cosmogony or creation of the world has puzzled philosophers of all ages. What a medly of opinions have they not broached upon the creation of the world? Sanconiathon, Manetho, Be∣rosus, and Ocellus Lucanus, have all at∣tempted it in vain. The latter has these
<PB N="138" REF="139"/>
words, <HI>Anarchon ara kai atelutaion to pan,</HI> which imply that all things have neither beginning nor end. Manetho also, who lived about the time of Ne∣buchadon-Asser, Asser being a Syriac word usually applied as a sirname to the kings of that country, as Teglat Phael-Asser, Nabon-Asser, he, I say, formed a conjecture equally absurd; for as we usually say <HI>ek to biblion kubernetes,</HI> which implies that books will never teach the world; so he attempted to investigate—But, Sir, I ask pardon, I am straying from the question."</Q>—That he actually was; nor could I for my life see how the creation of the world had any thing to do with the business I was talking of; but it was sufficient to shew me that he was a man of letters, and I now reverenced him the more. I was resolved therefore to bring him to the touch-stone; but he was too mild and too gentle to contend for vic∣tory. Whenever I made any observation that looked like a challenge to controversy, he would smile, shake his head, and say
<PB N="139" REF="140"/>
nothing; by which I understood he could say much, if he thought proper. The sub∣ject therefore insensibly changed from the business of antiquity to that which brought us both to the fair; mine I told him was to sell an horse, and very luckily, indeed, his was to buy one for one of his tenants. My horse was soon produced, and in fine we struck a bargain. Nothing now remained but to pay me, and he accordingly pulled out a thirty pound note, and bid me change it. Not being in a capacity of complying with his demand, he ordered the landlady to call up his footman, who made his appearance in a very genteel livery. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here, Abra∣ham,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"go and get gold for this; you'll do it at neighbour Jackson's, or any where."</Q> While the fellow was gone, he entertained me with a pathetic harangue on the great scarcity of silver, which I undertook to improve, by deplor∣ing also the great scarcity of gold; and by the time Abraham returned, we had both agreed that money was never so hard
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
to be come at as now. Abraham returned to inform us, that he had been over the whole fair and could not get change, tho' he had offered half a crown for doing it. This was a very great disappointment to us all; but the old gentleman having paused a little, asked me if I knew one Solomon Flamborough in my part of the country: upon replying that he was my next door neighbour, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If that be the case then,"</Q> re∣turned he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I believe we shall deal. You shall have a draught upon him, payable at sight; and let me tell you he is as warm a man as any within five miles round him. Honest Solomon and I have been acquainted for many years together. I remember I always beat him at three jumps; but he could hop upon one leg farther than I."</Q> A draught upon my neighbour was to me the same as money; for I was sufficiently convinced of his abi∣lity: the draught was signed and put into my hands, and Mr. Jenkinson, the old gentleman, his man Abraham, and my
<PB N="141" REF="142"/>
horse, old Blackberry, trotted off very well pleased with each other.</P>
<P>Being now left to reflection, I began to recollect that I had done wrong in taking a draught from a stranger, and so prudently resolved upon having back my horse, and following the purchaser. But this was now too late: I therefore made directly homewards, resolving to get the draught changed into money at my friend's as fast as possible. I found my honest neighbour smoking his pipe at his own door, and informing him that I had a small bill upon him, he read it twice over. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You can read the name, I suppose,"</Q> cried I," <Q REND="inline margQuotes">Ephraim Jenkinson."</Q> <Q REND="inline">Yes,"</Q> re∣turned he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the name is written plain enough, and I know the gentleman too, the greatest rascal under the canopy of heaven. This is the very same rogue who sold us the spectacles. Was he not, a venerable looking man, with grey hair, and no flaps to his pocket-holes? And did he not talk a long string of learning about Greek and
<PB N="142" REF="143"/>
cosmogony, and the world?"</Q> To this I replied with a groan. <Q REND="inline">"Aye,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he has but that one piece of learning in the world, and he always talks it away whenever he finds a scholar in compa∣ny: but I know the rogue, and will catch him yet."</Q></P>
<P>Though I was already sufficiently mor∣tified, my greatest struggle was to come, in facing my wife and daughters. No tru∣ant was ever more afraid of returning to school, there to behold the master's sweet visage, than I was of going home. I was determined, however, to anticipate their fury, by first falling into a passion myself.</P>
<P>But, alas! upon entering, I found the family no way disposed for battle. My wife and girls were all in tears, Mr. Thornhill having been there that day to inform them, that their journey to town was entirely over. The two ladies having heard reports of us from some malicious person about us, were that day set out for London. He could
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>
neither discover the tendency, nor the au∣thor of these. but whatever they might be, or whoever might have broached them, he continued to assure our family of his friendship and protection. I found, there∣fore, that they bore my disappointment with great resignation, as it was eclipsed in the greatness of their own. But what per∣plexed us most was to think who could be so base as to asperse the character of a fa∣mily so harmless as ours, too humble to ex∣cite envy, and too inoffensive to create dis∣gust.</P>

<P>All Mr. Burchell's villainy at once detected. The folly of being over-wise.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THAT evening and a part of the fol∣lowing day was employed in fruitless attempts to discover our enemies: scarce a family in the neighbourhood but incurred our suspicions, and each of us had reasons for our opinion best known to ourselves. As we were in this perplexity, one of our little boys, who had been playing abroad, brought in a letter-case, which he found on the green. It was quickly known to be∣long to Mr. Burchell, with whom it had been seen, and, upon examination, con∣tained some hints upon different subjects; but what particularly engaged our attention was a sealed note, superscribed, <HI>the copy of</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="146"/>
<HI>a letter to be sent to the two ladies at Thornhill-castle.</HI> It instantly occurred that he was the base informer, and we delibe∣rated whether the note should not be broke open. I was against it; but Sophia, who said she was sure that of all men he would be the last to be guilty of so much base∣ness, insisted upon its being read. In this she was seconded by the rest of the family, and, at their joint solicitation, I read as follows:<Q REND="inline"><P>LADIES,</P>
<P>"THE bearer will sufficiently satisfy you as to the person from whom this comes: one at least the friend of innocence, and ready to prevent its being seduced. I am informed for a truth, that you have some intentions of bringing two young ladies to town, whom I have some knowledge of, under the character of companions. As I would neither have simplicity imposed up∣on, nor virtue contaminated, I must offer it as my opinion, that the impropriety of such
<PB N="147" REF="147"/>
a step will be attended with dangerous con∣sequences. It has never been my way to treat the infamous or the lewd with severi∣ty; nor should I now have taken this me∣thod of explaining myself, or reproving folly, did it not aim at guilt. Take there∣fore the admonition of a friend, and seri∣ously reflect on the consequences of intro∣ducing infamy and vice into retreats where peace and innocence have hitherto resided."</P></Q></P>
<P>Our doubts were now at an end. There seemed indeed something applicable to both sides in this letter, and its censures might as well be referred to those to whom it was written, as to us; but the malicious meaning was obvious, and we went no farther. My wife had scarce patience to hear me to the end, but railed at the wri∣ter with unrestrained resentment. Olivia was equally severe, and Sophia seemed per∣fectly amazed at his baseness. As for my part, it appeared to me one of the vilest instances of unprovoked ingratitude I had
<PB N="148" REF="148"/>
met with. Nor could I account for it in any other manner than by imputing it to his desire of detaining my youngest daugh∣ter in the country, to have the more fre∣quent opportunities of an interview. In this manner we all sate ruminating upon schemes of vengeance, when our other little boy came runing in to tell us that Mr. Bur∣chell was approaching at the other end of the field. It is easier to conceive than de∣scribe the complicated sensations which are felt from the pain of a recent injury, and the pleasure of approaching revenge. Tho' our intentions were only to upbraid him with his ingratitude; yet it was resolved to do it in a manner that would be perfectly cutting. For this purpose we agreed to meet him with our usual smiles, to chat in the beginning with more than ordinary kindness, to amuse him a little; but then in the midst of the flattering calm to burst upon him like an earthquake, and over∣whelm him with the sense of his own base∣ness. This being resolved upon, my wife undertook to manage the business herself,
<PB N="149" REF="149"/>
as she really had some talents for such an un∣dertaking. We saw him approach, he enter∣ed, drew a chair, and sate down.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A fine day, Mr. Burchell."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A very fine day, Doctor; though I fancy we shall have some rain by the shooting of my corns."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The shooting of your horns,"</Q> cried my wife, in a loud fit of laughter, and then asked pardon for being fond of a joke.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dear madam,"</Q> re∣plied he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I pardon you with all my heart; for I protest I should not have thought it a joke till you told me."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Perhaps not, Sir,"</Q> cried my wife, winking at us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and yet I dare say you can tell us how many jokes go to an ounce."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I fancy, madam,"</Q> returned Burchell, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you have been reading a jest book this morning, that ounce of jokes is so very good a con∣ceit; and yet, madam, I had rather see half an ounce of understanding."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I believe you might,"</Q> cried my wife, still smiling at us, though the laugh was against her; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and yet I have seen some men pretend to understanding that have
<PB N="150" REF="150"/>
very little."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And no doubt,"</Q> re∣plied her antagonist, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you have known la∣dies set up for wit that had none."</Q>—I quickly began to find that my wife was likely to gain but little at this business; so I resolved to treat him in a stile of more se∣verity myself. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Both wit and understand∣ing,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"are trifles, without in∣tegrity: it is that which gives value to every character. The ignorant peasant, without fault, is greater than the philo∣sopher with many; for what is genius or courage without an heart? <HI>An honest man is the noblest work of God.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I always held that favourite maxim of Pope,"</Q> returned Mr. Burchell, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as very unworthy a man of genius, and a base desertion of his own superiority. As the reputation of books is raised not by their freedom from defect, but the greatness of their beauties; so should that of men be prized not for their ex∣emption from fault, but the size of those virtues they are possessed of. The scho∣lar
<PB N="151" REF="151"/>
may want prudence, the statesman may have pride, and the champion fero∣city; but shall we prefer to these men the low mechanic, who laboriously plods on through life, without censure or ap∣plause? We might as well prefer the tame correct paintings of the Flemish school to the erroneous, but sublime ani∣mations of the Roman pencil."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"your present obser∣vation is just, when there are shining vir∣tues and minute defects; but when it ap∣pears that great vices are opposed in the same mind to as extraordinary virtues, such a character deserves contempt.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"there may be some such monsters as you describe, of great vices joined to great virtues; yet in my progress through life, I never yet found one instance of their existence: on the contrary, I have ever perceived, that where the mind was capacious, the
<PB N="152" REF="152"/>
affections were good. And indeed Pro∣vidence seems kindly our friend in this particular, thus to debilitate the under∣standing where the heart is corrupt, and diminish the power where there is the will to do mischief. This rule seems to ex∣tend even to other animals: the little vermin race are ever treacherous, cruel, and cowardly, whilst those endowed with strength and power are generous, brave, and gentle."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"These observations sound well,"</Q> re∣turned I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and yet it would be easy this moment to point out a man,"</Q> and I fixed my eye stedfastly upon him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"whose head and heart form a most detestable contrast. Ay, Sir,"</Q> continued I, raising my voice, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and I am glad to have this opportunity of detecting him in the midst of his fan∣cied securiry. Do you know this, Sir, this pocket-book?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, Sir,"</Q> returned he, with a face of impenetrable assurance, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that pocket-book is mine, and I am glad you have found it."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And
<PB N="153" REF="153"/>
do you know,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this letter? Nay, never falter man; but look me full in the face: I say, do you know this let∣ter?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That letter,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"yes, it was I that wrote that letter."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And how could you,"</Q> said I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"so basely, so ungratefully presume to write this letter?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And how came you,"</Q> re∣plied he, with looks of unparallelled ef∣frontery, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"so basely to presume to break open this letter? Don't you know, now, I could hang you all for this? All that I have to do, is to swear at the next jus∣tice's, that you have been guilty of breaking open the lock of my pocket-book, and so hang you all up at his door."</Q> This piece of unexpected inso∣lence raised me to such a pitch, that I could scare govern my passion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ungrate∣ful wretch, begone, and no longer pol∣lute my dwelling with thy baseness. Begone, and never let me see thee again: go from my doors, and the only punish∣ment I wish thee is an allarmed consci∣ence, which will be a sufficient tormen∣tor!"</Q>
<PB N="154" REF="154"/>
So saying, I threw him his pocket-book, which he took up with a smile, and shutting the clasps with the utmost compo∣sure, left us, quite astonished at the serenity of his assurance. My wife was particularly enraged that nothing could make him an∣gry, or make him seem ashamed of his villainies, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear,"</Q> cried I, willing to calm those passions that had been raised too high among us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we are not to be surprised that bad men want shame; they only blush at being detected in doing good, but glory in their vices."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Guilt and shame, says the allegory, were at first companions, and in the be∣ginning of their journey inseparably kept together. But their union was soon found to be disagreeable and in∣convenient to both; guilt gave shame frequent uneasiness, and shame often be∣trayed the secret conspiracies of guilt. After long disagreement, therefore, they at length consented to part for ever.
<PB N="155" REF="155"/>
Guilt boldly walked forward alone, to overtake fate, that went before in the shape of an executioner: but shame be∣ing naturally timorous, returned back to keep company with virtue, which, in the beginning of their journey, they had left behind. Thus, my children, after men have travelled through a few stages in vice, they no longer continue to have shame at do∣ing evil, and shame attends only upon their virtues."</Q></P>

<P>The family use art, which is opposed with still greater.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHATEVER might have been Sophia's sensations, the rest of the family was easily consoled for Mr. Bur∣chell's absence by the company of our landlord, whose visits now became more fre∣quent and longer. Though he had been disappointed in procuring my daughters the amusements of the town, as he designed, he took every opportunity of supplying them with those little recreations which our retirement would admit of. He usually came in the morning, and while my son and I followed our occupations abroad, he sat with the family at home, and amused them by describing the town, with every part
<PB N="158" REF="157"/>
of which he was particularly acquainted. He could repeat all the observations that were retailed in the atmosphere of the play-houses, and had all the good things of the high wits by rote long before they made way into the jest-books. The intervals be∣tween coversation were employed in teach∣ing my daughters piquet, or sometimes in setting my two little ones to box to make them <HI>sharp,</HI> as he called it: but the hopes of having him for a son-in-law, in some mea∣sure blinded us to all his defects. It must be owned that my wife laid a thousand schemes to entrap him, or, to speak it more tenderly, used every art to magnify the me∣rit of her daughter. If the cakes at tea eat short and crisp, they were made by Oli∣via: if the gooseberry wine was well knit, the gooseberries were of her gathering: it was her fingers gave the pickles their pecu∣liar green; and in the composition of a pudding, her judgment was infallible. Then the poor woman would sometimes tell the 'Squire, that she thought him and Oli∣via
<PB N="159" REF="158"/>
extremely like each other, and would bid both stand up to see which was tallest. These instances of cunning, which she thought impenetrable, yet which every bo∣dy saw through, were very pleasing to our benefactor, who gave every day some new proofs of his passion, which though they had not arisen to proposals of marriage, yet we thought fell but little short of it; and his slowness was attributed sometimes to native bashfulness, and sometimes to his fear of of∣fending a rich uncle. An occurrence, how∣ever, which happened soon after, put it beyond a doubt that he designed to become one of the family, my wife even regarded it as an absolute promise.</P>
<P>My wife and daughters happening to re∣turn a visit to neighbour Flamborough's, found that family had lately got their pic∣tures drawn by a limner, who travelled the country, and did them for fifteen shillings a head. As this family and ours had long a sort of rivalry in point of taste, our spirit took the alarm at this stolen march upon us,
<PB N="160" REF="159"/>
and notwithstanding all I could say, and I said much, it was resolved that we should have our pictures done too. Having, therefore, engaged the limner, for what could I do? our next deliberation was to shew the superiority of our taste in the attitudes. As for our neighbour's fa∣mily, there were seven of them, and they were drawn with seven oranges, a thing quite out of taste, no variety in life, no composition in the world. We desired to have something done in a brighter style, and, after many debates, at length came to an unanimous resolution to be drawn to∣gether, in one large historical family piece. This would be cheaper, since one frame would serve for all, and it would be infi∣nitely more genteel; for all families of any taste were now drawn in the same manner. As we did not immediately recollect an his∣torical subject to hit us, we were contented each with being drawn as independent historical figures. My wife desired to be represented as Venus, with a stomacher richly set with diamonds, and her two lit∣tle
<PB N="161" REF="160"/>
ones as Cupids by her side, while I, in my gown and band, was to present her with my books on the Bangorean contro∣versy. Olivia would be drawn as an Ama∣zon, sitting upon a bank of flowers, drest in a green joseph, laced with gold, and a whip in her hand. Sophia was to be a shepherdess, with as many sheep as the pain∣ter could spare; and Moses was to be drest out with an hat and white feather. Our taste so much pleased the 'Squire, that he insisted on being put in as one of the family in the character of Alexander the great, at Olivia's feet. This was considered by us all as an indication of his desire to be in∣troduced into the family in reality, nor could we refuse his request. The painter was therefore set to work, and as he wrought with assiduity and expedition, in less than four days the whole was compleated. The piece was large, and it must be owned he did not spare his colours; for which my wife gave him great encomiums. We were all perfectly satisfied with his performance;
<PB N="162" REF="161"/>
but an unfortunate circumstance had not occurred till the picture was finished, which now struck us with dismay. It was so very large that we had no place in the house to fix it. How we all came to disregard so material a point is inconceivable; but cer∣tain it is, we were this time all greatly over∣seen. Instead therefore of gratifying our vanity, as we hoped, there it leaned, in a most mortifying manner, against the kitchen wall, where the canvas was stretched and painted, much too large to be got through any of the doors, and the jest of all our neighbours. One compared it to Robinson Crusoe's long-boat, too large to be remov∣ed; another thought it more resembled a reel in a bottle; some wondered how it should be got out, and still more were amazed how it ever got in.</P>
<P>But though it excited the ridicule of some, it effectually raised more ill-natured sugges∣tions in many. The 'Squire's portrait be∣ing found united with ours, was an honour too great to escape envy. Malicious whis∣pers
<PB N="163" REF="162"/>
began to circulate at our expence, and our tranquility continually to be disturbed by persons who came as friends to tell us what was said of us by enemies. These reports we always resented with becoming spirit; but scandal ever improves by oppo∣sition. We again therefore entered into a consultation upon obviating the malice of our enemies, and at last came to a resolu∣tion which had too much cunning to give me entire satisfaction. It was this: as our prin∣cipal object was to discover the honour of Mr. Thornhill's addresses, my wife under∣took to sound him, by pretending to ask his advice in the choice of an husband for her eldest daughter. If this was not found suf∣ficient to induce him to a declaration, it was then fixed upon to terrify him with a rival, which it was thought would compel him, though never so refractory. To this last step, however, I would by no means give my consent, till Olivia gave me the most solemn assurances that she would marry the person provided to rival him upon this occasion, if Mr. Thornhill did not prevent it,
<PB N="164" REF="163"/>
by taking her himself. Such was the scheme laid, which though I did not strenuously oppose, I did not entirely approve.</P>
<P>The next time, therefore, that Mr. Thornhill came to see us, my girls took care to be out of the way, in order to give their mamma an opportunity of putting her scheme in execution; but they only re∣tired to the next room, from whence they could over-hear the whole conversation; which my wife artfully introduced, by ob∣serving, that one of the Miss Flamboroughs was like to have a very good match of it in Mr. Spanker. To this the 'Squire assent∣ing, she proceeded to remark, that they who had warm fortunes were always sure of getting good husbands: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But heaven help,"</Q> continued she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the girls that have none. What signifies beauty, Mr. Thornhill? or what signifies all the virtue, and all the qualifications in the world, in this age of self-interest? It is not, what is she? but what has she? is all the cry."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="164"/>
<Q REND="inline">"Madam,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I highly ap∣prove the justice, as well as the novelty, of your remarks, and if I were a king, it should be otherwise. It would then, indeed, be fine times with the girls with∣out fortunes: our two young ladies should be the first for whom I would provide."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah, Sir!"</Q> returned my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you are pleased to be facetious: but I wish I were a queen, and then I know where they should look for an husband. But now, that you have put it into my head, seriously Mr. Thornhill, can't you re∣commend me a proper husband for my eldest girl? She is now nineteen years old, well grown and well educated, and, in my humble opinion, does not want for parts."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Madam,"</Q> replied he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if I were to chuse, I would find out a person possessed of every accomplishment that can make an angel happy. One with prudence, for∣tune,
<PB N="166" REF="165"/>
taste, and sincerity, such, madam, would be, in my opinion, the proper hus∣band."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, Sir,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but do you know of any such person?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, madam,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is impossible to know any person that deserves to be her husband: she's too great a treasure for one man's possession: she's a goddess. Upon my soul, I speak what I think, she's an angel."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah, Mr. Thornhill, you only flatter my poor girl: but we have been thinking of marrying her to one of your tenants, whose mother is lately dead, and who wants a manager: you know whom I mean, farmer Williams; a warm man, Mr. Thornhill, able to give her good bread; ay, and who has several times made her proposals:"</Q> (which was actually the case) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">but, Sir,"</Q> concluded she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I should be glad to have your approba∣tion of our choice."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How, ma∣dam,"</Q> replied he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"my approbation! My approbation of such a choice! Never. What! Sacrifice so much beauty, and
<PB N="167" REF="166"/>
sense, and goodness, to a creature insen∣sible of the blessing! Excuse me, I can never approve of such a piece of injus∣tice! And I have my reasons!"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, Sir,"</Q> cried Deborah, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if you have your reasons, that's another affair; but I should be glad to know those rea∣sons."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Excuse me, madam,"</Q> re∣turned he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they lie too deep for discovery:</Q> (laying his hand upon his bosom) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">they re∣main buried, rivetted here."</Q></P>
<P>After he was gone, upon general con∣sultation, we could not tell what to make of these fine sentiments. Olivia considered them as instances of the most exalted pas∣sion; but I was not quite so sanguine: it seemed to me pretty plain, that they had more of love than matrimony in them: yet, whatever they might portend, it was re∣solved to prosecute the scheme of farmer Williams, who, since my daughter's first ap∣pearance in the country, had paid her his addresses.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Scarce any virtue found to resist the power of long and pleasing temptation.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS I only studied my child's real hap∣piness, the assiduity of Mr. Williams pleased me, as he was in easy circumstances, prudent, and sincere. It required but very little encouragement to revive his former passion; so that in an evening or two after he and Mr. Thornhill met at our house, and surveyed each other for some time with looks of anger: but Williams owed his landlord no rent, and little re∣garded his indignation. Olivia, on her side, acted the coquet to perfection, if that might be called acting which was her real character, pretending to lavish all her ten∣derness on her new lover. Mr. Thornhill
<PB N="170" REF="168"/>
appeared quite dejected at this prefe∣rence, and with a pensive air took leave, though I own it puzzled me to find him so much in pain as he appeared to be, when he had it in his power so easily to remove the cause, by declaring an honourable pas∣sion. But whatever uneasiness he seemed to endure, it could easily be perceived that Olivia's anguish was still greater. After any of these interviews between her lovers, of which there were several, she usually re∣tired to solitude, and there indulged her grief. It was in such a situation I found her one evening, after she had been for some time supporting a fictitious gayety.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You now see, my child,"</Q> said I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that your confidence in Mr. Thornhill's pas∣sion was all a dream: he permits the ri∣valry of another, every way his inferior, though he knows it lies in his power to secure you by a candid declaration him∣self."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, pappa,"</Q> returned she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but he has his reasons for this delay: I know he has. The sincerity of his looks and words convince me of his real esteem.
<PB N="171" REF="169"/>
A short time, I hope, will discover the ge∣nerosity of his sentiments, and convince you that my opinion of him has been more just than yours."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Olivia, my dar∣ling,"</Q> returned I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"every scheme that has been hitherto pursued to compel him to a declaration, has been proposed and plan∣ned by yourself, nor can you in the least say that I have constrained you. But you must not suppose, my dear, that I will be ever instrumental in suffering his ho∣nest rival to be the dupe of your ill-placed passion. Whatever time you re∣quire to bring your fancied admirer to an explanation shall be granted; but at the expiration of that term, if he is still regardless, I must absolutely insist that honest Mr. Williams shall be rewarded for his fidelity. The character which I have hitherto supported in life demands this from me, and my tenderness, as a parent, shall never influence my in∣tegrity as a man. Name then your day, let it be as distant as you think proper, and in the mean time take care to let
<PB N="172" REF="170"/>
Mr. Thornhill know the exact time on which I design delivering you up to an∣other. If he really loves you, his own good sense will readily suggest that there is but one method alone to prevent his losing you for ever."</Q>—This propo∣sal, which she could not avoid considering as perfectly just, was readily agreed to. She again renewed her most positive promise of marrying Mr. Williams, in case of the other's insensibility; and at the next oppor∣tunity, in Mr. Thornhill's presence, that day month was fixed upon for her nuptials with his rival.</P>
<P>Such vigorous proceedings seemed to re∣double Mr. Thornhill's anxiety: but what Olivia really felt gave me some uneasiness. In this struggle between prudence and passion, her vivacity quite forsook her, and every op∣portunity of solitude was sought, and spent in tears. One week passed away; but her lover made no efforts to restrain her nuptials. The succeeding week he was still assiduous; but not more open. On the
<PB N="173" REF="171"/>
third he discontinued his visits entirely, and instead of my daughter testifying any im∣patience, as I expected, she seemed to re∣tain a pensive tranquillity, which I looked upon as resignation. For my own part, I was now sincerely pleased with thinking that my child was going to be secured in a continuance of competence and peace, and frequently applauded her resolution, It was within about four days of her in∣tended nuptials, that my little family at night were gathered round a charming fire, telling stories of the past, and laying schemes for the future. Busied in forming a thousand projects, and laughing at what∣ever folly came uppermost, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, Mo∣ses,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we shall soon, my boy, have a wedding in the family, what is your opinion of matters and things in general?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My opinion, father, is, that all things go on very well; and I was just now thinking, that when sister Livy is married to farmer Williams, we shall then have the loan of his cyder∣press and brewing tubs for nothing."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That
<PB N="174" REF="172"/>
we shall, Moses,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and he will sing us Death and the Lady, to raise our spirits into the bargain."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He has taught that song to our Dick,"</Q> cried Moses; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and I think he goes thro' it very prettily."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Does he so,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"then let us have it: where's little Dick? let him up with it boldly."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My brother Dick,"</Q> cried Bill my youngest, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is just gone out with sister Livy; but Mr. Williams has taught me two songs, and I'll sing them for you, pappa. Which song do you chuse, <HI>the Dying Swan,</HI> or the <HI>Elegy on the death of a mad dog?</HI>"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The elegy, child, by all means,"</Q> said I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I never heard that yet; and Deborah, my life, grief you know is dry, let us have a bottle of the best gooseberry wine, to keep up our spirits.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And very good advice too,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and I am told there is not a place in the world where advice can be given with so much propriety as there; for, as it per∣suades us to marry, it also furnishes us with a wife; and surely that must be an excellent market, my boy, where we are told what we want, and supplied with it when wanting."</Q></P>

he was, and reproach his baseness. The next morning we missed our wretched child at breakfast, where she used to give life and chearfulness to us all.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The pursuit of a father to reclaim a lost child to virtue.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THO' the child could not describe the gentleman's person who handed his sis∣ter into the post-chaise, yet my suspicions fell entirely upon our young landlord, whose cha∣racter for such intrigues was but too well known. I therefore directed my steps towards Thornhill-castle, resolving to upbraid him, and, if possible, to bring back my daughter: but before I had reached his seat, I was met by one of my parishioners, who said he saw a young lady resembling my daughter in a post-chaise with a gentleman, whom, by the description, I could only guess to be Mr. Burchell, and that they drove very fast. This information, however, did by no
<PB N="188" REF="185"/>
means satisfy me. I therefore went to the young 'Squire's, and though it was yet ear∣ly, insisted upon seeing him immediately: he soon appeared with the most open fami∣liar air, and seemed perfectly amazed at my daughter's elopement, protesting upon his honour that he was quite a stranger to it. I now therefore condemned my former suspicions, and could turn them only on Mr. Burchell, who I recollected had of late several private conferences with her: but the appearance of another witness left me no room to doubt of his villainy, who averred, that he and my daughter were ac∣tually gone towards the wells, about thirty miles off, where there was a great deal of company. Hearing this, I resolved to pur∣sue them there. I walked along with ear∣nestness, and enquired of several by the way; but received no accounts, till enter∣ing the town, I was met by a person on horseback, whom I remembered to have seen at the 'Squire's, and he assured me that if I followed them to the races, which were but thirty miles farther, I might de∣pend
<PB N="189" REF="186"/>
upon overtaking them; for he had seen them dance there the night before, and the whole assembly seemed charmed with my daughter's performance. Early the next day I walked forward to the races, and about four in the afternoon I came upon the course. The company made a very brilliant appearance, all earnestly employed in one pursuit, that of plea∣sure; how different from mine, that of reclaiming a lost child to virtue! I thought I perceived Mr. Burchell at some distance from me; but, as if he dreaded an inter∣view, upon my approaching him, he mixed among a crowd, and I saw him no more. I now reflected that it would be to no pur∣pose to continue my pursuit farther, and resolved to return home to an innocent fa∣mily, who wanted my assistance. But the agitations of my mind, and the fatigues I had undergone, threw me into a fever, the symptoms of which I perceived before I came off the course. This was another un∣expected stroke, as I was more than seventy miles distant from home: however, I re∣tired
<PB N="190" REF="187"/>
to a little ale-house by the road-side, and in this place, the usual retreat of indi∣gence and frugality, I laid me down pati∣ently to wait the issue of my disorder. I languished here for near three weeks; but at last my constitution prevailed, though I was unprovided with money to defray the expences of my entertainment. It is possi∣ble the anxiety from this last circumstance alone might have brought on a relapse, had I not been supplied by a traveller, who stopt to take a cursory refreshment. This per∣son was no other than the philanthropic bookseller in St. Paul's church-yard, who has written so many little books for children: he called himself their friend; but he was the friend of all mankind. He was no sooner alighted, but he was in haste to be gone; for he was ever on busi∣ness of the utmost importance, and was at that time actually compiling materials for the history of one Mr. Thomas Trip. I immediately recollected this good-natured man's red pimpled face; for he had pub∣lished for me against the Deuterogamists of
<PB N="191" REF="188"/>
the age, and from him I borrowed a few pieces, to be paid at my return. Leaving the inn, therefore, as I was yet but weak, I resolved to return home by easy journies of ten miles a day. My health and usual tranquillity were almost restored, and I now condemned that pride which had made me refractory to the hand of correction. Man little knows what calamities are beyond his patience to bear till he tries them; as in ascending the heights of ambition, which look bright from below, every step we rise shews us some new prospect of hidden dis∣appointment; so in our descent to the vale of wretchedness, which, from the summits of pleasure appears dark and gloomy, the busy mind, still attentive to its own amuse∣ment, finds something to flatter and sur∣prise it. Still as we descend, the objects appear to brighten, unexpected prospects amuse, and the mental eye becomes adapt∣ed to its gloomy situation.</P>
<P>I now proceeded forwards, and had walked about two hours, when I perceived
<PB N="192" REF="189"/>
what appeared at a distance like the wag∣gon, which I was resolved to overtake; but when I came up with it, found it to be a strolling company's cart, that was carrying their scenes and other theatrical furniture to the next village, where they were to exhibit. The cart was attended only by the person who drove it, and one of the company, as the rest of the players were to follow the ensuing day. Good company upon the road, says the proverb, is always the shortest cut, I therefore entered into conversation with the poor player; and as I once had some theatrical powers myself, I disserted on such topics with my usual freedom: but as I was pretty much unacquainted with the present state of the stage, I demanded who were the present theatrical writers in vogue, who the Drydens and Otways of the day.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I fancy, Sir,"</Q> cried the player, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"few of our modern dramatists would think them∣selves much honoured by being com∣pared to the writers you mention. Dry∣den and Row's manner, Sir, are quite out of fashion; our taste has gone back a
<PB N="193" REF="190"/>
whole century, Fletcher, Ben Johnson, and all the plays of Shakespear, are the only things that go down."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"How,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is it possible the present age can be pleased with that antiquated dialect, that obsolete humour, those over-charged characters, which abound in the works you mention?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> returned my companion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the public think no∣thing about dialect, or humour, or cha∣racter; for that is none of their busi∣ness, they only go to be amused, and find themselves happy when they can en∣joy a pantomime, under the sanction of Johnson's or Shakespear's name."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"So then, I suppose"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that our mo∣dern dramatists are rather imitators of Shakespear than of nature."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To say the truth,"</Q> returned my companion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I don't know that they imitate any thing at all; nor indeed does the public require it of them: it is not the composition of the piece, but the num∣ber of starts and attitudes that may be introduced into it that elicits applause. I
<PB N="194" REF="191"/>
have known a piece, with not one jest in the whole, shrugged into popularity, and another saved by the poet's throwing in a fit of the gripes. No, Sir, the works of Congreve and Farquhar have too much wit in them for the present taste; our modern dialogue is much more na∣tural."</Q></P>
<P>By this time the equipage of the strolling company was arrived at the village, which, it seems, had been apprised of our approach, and was come out to gaze at us; for my compa∣nion observed, that strollers always have more spectators without doors than within. I did not consider the impropriety of my being in such company till I saw a mob ga∣thered about me. I therefore took shel∣ter, as fast as possible, in the first ale-house that offered, and being shewn into the common room, was accosted by a very well-drest gentleman, who demanded whether I was the real chaplain of the company, or whether it was only to be my masquerade character in the play. Upon informing him
<PB N="195" REF="192"/>
of the truth, and that I did not belong to the company, he was condescending e∣nough to desire me and the player to par∣take in a bowl of punch, over which he discussed modern politics with great earnest∣ness and seeming interest. I set him down in my own mind for nothing less than a par∣liament-man at least; but was almost confirm∣ed in my conjectures, when upon my asking what there was in the house for supper, he insisted that the player and I should sup with him at his house, with which request, after some entreaties, I was prevailed on to comply.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The description of a person discontented with the present government, and ap∣prehensive of the loss of our liberties.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE house where we were to be enter∣tained, lying at a small distance from the village, our inviter observed, that as the coach was not ready, he would conduct us on foot, and we soon arrived at one of the most magnificent mansions I had seen in the country. The apartment into which we were shewn was perfectly elegant and mo∣dern; he went to give orders for sup∣per, while the player, with a wink, ob∣served that we were perfectly in luck. Our entertainer soon returned, an elegant supper was brought in, two or three ladies, in an
<PB N="198" REF="194"/>
easy deshabille, were introduced, and the con∣versation began with some sprightliness. Po∣litics, however, was the subject on which our entertainer chiefly expatiated; for he asserted that liberty was at once his boast and his terror. After the cloth was remov∣ed, he asked me if I had seen the last Mo∣nitor, to which replying in the negative, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What, nor the Auditor, I suppose?"</Q> cried he. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Neither, Sir,"</Q> returned I. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That's strange, very strange,"</Q> replied my entertainer. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Now, I read all the politics that come out. The Daily, the Public, the Ledger, the Chronicle, the London Evening, the Whitehall Evening, the seventeen magazines, and the two re∣views; and though they hate each other, I love them all. Liberty, Sir, liberty is the Briton's boast, and by all my coal mines in Cornwall, I reverence its guardians."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then it is to be hoped,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you reverence the king."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> returned my entertainer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"when he does what we would have him; but if he goes on as he has done of late,
<PB N="199" REF="195"/>
I'll never trouble myself more with his matters. I say nothing. I think only. I could have directed some things better. I don't think there has been a sufficient number of advisers: he should advise with every person willing to give him advice, and then we should have things done in another manner."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I wish,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that such intrud∣ing advisers were fixed in the pillory. It should be the duty of honest men to assist the weaker side of our con∣stitution, that sacred power that has for some years been every day declining, and losing its due share of influence in the state. But these ignorants still continue the cry of liberty, and if they have any weight basely throw it into the subsiding scale."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How,"</Q> cried one of the ladies, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"do I live to see one so base, so sordid, as to be an enemy to liberty, and a defender of tyrants? Liberty, that sacred gift of
<PB N="200" REF="196"/>
heaven, that glorious privilege of Bri∣tons!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Can it be possible,"</Q> cried our enter∣tainer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that there should be any found at present advocates for slavery? Any who are for meanly giving up the privileges of Britons? Can any, Sir, be so ab∣ject?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, Sir,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am for liberty, that attribute of Gods! Glorious liberty! that theme of modern declamation. I would have all men kings. I would be a king myself. We have all naturally an equal right to the throne: we are all originally equal. This is my opinion, and was once the opinion of a set of honest men who were called Levellers. They tried to erect themselves into a com∣munity, where all should be equally free. But, alas! it would never answer; for there were some among them stronger, and some more cunning than others, and these became masters of the rest; for as
<PB N="201" REF="197"/>
sure as your groom rides your horses, be∣cause he is a cunninger animal than they, so surely will the animal that is cunninger or stronger than he, sit upon his shoul∣ders in turn. Since then it is entailed upon humanity to submit, and some are born to command, and others to obey, the question is, as there must be ty∣rants, whether it is better to have them in the same house with us, or in the same village, or still farther off, in the metropolis. Now, Sir, for my own part, as I naturally hate the face of a tyrant, the farther off he is removed from me, the better pleased am I. The generality of mankind also are of my way of thinking, and have unanimously created one king, whose election at once diminishes the number of tyrants, and puts tyranny at the greatest distance from the greatest number of people. Now those who were tyrants themselves before the elec∣tion of one tyrant, are naturally averse to a power raised over them, and whose
<PB N="202" REF="198"/>
weight must ever lean heaviest on the su∣bordinate orders. It is the interest of the great, therefore, to diminish kingly power as much as possible; because whatever they take from it is naturally restored to them∣selves; and all they have to do in a state, is to undermine the single tyrant, by which they resume their primaeval authority. Now, a state may be so constitutionally cir∣cumstanced, its laws may be so disposed, and its men of opulence so minded, as all to conspire to carry on this business of undermining monarchy. If the circum∣stances of the state be such, for instance, as to favour the accumulation of wealth, and make the opulent still more rich, this will encrease their strength and their am∣bition. But an accumulation of wealth must necessarily be the consequence in a state when more riches flow in from ex∣ternal commerce, than arise from inter∣nal industry: for external commerce can only be managed to advantage by the rich, and they have also at the same
<PB N="203" REF="199"/>
time all the emoluments arising from in∣ternal industry: so that the rich, in such a state, have two sources of wealth, where∣as the poor have but one. Thus wealth in all commercial states is found to accu∣mulate, and such have hitherto in time become aristocratical. Besides this, the very laws of a country may contribute to the accumulation of wealth; as when those natural ties that bind the rich and poor together are broken, and it is or∣dained that the rich shall only marry a∣mong each other; or when the learned are held unqualified to serve their coun∣try as counsellors merely from a defect of opulence, and wealth is thus made the object of a wise man's ambition; by these means I say, and such means as these, riches will accumulate. The pos∣sessor of accumulated wealth, when fur∣nished with the necessaries and pleasures of life, can employ the superfluity of for∣tune only in purchasing power. That is, differently speaking, in making de∣pendants,
<PB N="204" REF="200"/>
in purchasing the liberty of the needy or the venal, of men who are willing to bear the mortification of contiguous ty∣ranny for bread. Thus each very opulent man generally gathers round him a circle of the poorest of the people; and the po∣lity abounding in accumulated wealth, may be compared to a Cartesian system, each orb with a vortex of its own. Those, however, who are willing to move in a great man's vortex, are only such as must be slaves, the rabble of mankind, whose souls and whose education are adapted to servitude, and who know nothing of liberty except the name. But there must still be a large number of the people without the sphere of the opulent man's influence, namely, that order of men which subsists between the very rich and the very rabble; those men who are pos∣sest of too large fortunes to submit to the neighbouring man in power, and yet are too poor to set up for tyranny themselves. In this middle order of mankind are ge∣nerally
<PB N="205" REF="201"/>
to be found all the arts, wisdom, and virtues of society. This order alone is known to be the true preserver of freedom, and may be called the People. Now it may happen that this middle or∣der of mankind may lose all its influence in a state, and its voice be in a manner drowned in that of the rabble: for if the fortune sufficient for qualifying a per∣son at present to give his voice in state affairs, be ten times less than was judged sufficient upon forming the constitution, it is evident that greater numbers of the rabble will thus be introduced into the political system, and they ever moving in the vortex of the great, will follow where greatness shall direct. In such a state, therefore, all that the middle order has left, is to preserve the prerogative and privileges of the one principal tyrant with the most sacred circumspection. For he divides the power of the rich, and calls off the great from falling with tenfold weight on the midle order placed beneath them. The middle order may be com∣pared
<PB N="206" REF="202"/>
to a town of which the opulent are forming the siege, and which the tyrant is hastening to relieve. While the be∣siegers are in dread of the external ene∣my, it is but natural to offer the towns∣men the most specious terms; to flatter them with sounds, and amuse them with privileges: but if they once defeat the tyrant, the walls of the town will be but a small defence to its inhabitants. What they may then expect, may be seen by turning our eyes to Holland, Genoa, or Venice, where the laws govern the poor, and the rich govern the law. I am then for, and would die for, monarchy, sa∣cred monarchy; for if there be any thing sacred amongst men, it must be the anointed sovereign of his people, and every diminution of his power in war, or in peace, is an infringemet upon the real liberties of the subject. The sounds of liberty, patriotism, and Britons, have al∣ready done <HI>much,</HI> it is to be hoped that the true sons of freedom will prevent their ever doing more. I have known
<PB N="207" REF="203"/>
many of those bold champions for liber∣ty in my time, yet do I not remember one that was not in his heart and in his family a tyrant."</Q></P>
<P>My warmth I found had lengthened this harangue beyond the rules of good breeding: but the impatience of my en∣tertainer, who often strove to interrupt it, could be restrained no longer. <Q REND="inline">"What,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"then I have been all this while entertaining a Jesuit in parson's cloaths; but by all the coal mines of Cornwall, out he shall pack, if my name be Wil∣kinson."</Q> I now found I had gone too far, and asked pardon for the warmth with which I had spoken. <Q REND="inline">"Pardon,"</Q> returned he in a fury: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I think such principles de∣mand ten thousand pardons. What, give up liberty, property, and, as the Ga∣zetteer says, lie down to be faddled with wooden shoes! Sir, I insist upon your marching out of this house immediately, to prevent worse consequences, Sir, I in∣sist upon it."</Q> I was going to repeat my
<PB N="208" REF="204"/>
remonstrances; but just then we heard a footman's rap at the door, and the two la∣dies cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As sure as death there is our master and mistress come home."</Q> It seems my entertainer was all this while only the butler, who, in his master's absence, had a mind to cut a figure, and be for a while the gentleman himself; and, to say the truth, he talked politics as well as most country gentlemen do. But nothing could now exceed my confusion upon seeing the gentleman, with his lady, enter, nor was their surprize, at finding such company and good cheer, less than ours. <Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen,"</Q> cried the real master of the house, to me and my companion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am your most hum∣ble servant; but I protest this is so unex∣pected a favour, that I almost sink under the obligation."</Q> However unexpected our company might be to him, his, I am sure, was still more so to us, and I was struck dumb with the apprehensions of my own absurdity, when whom should I next see enter the room but my dear miss Ara∣bella
<PB N="209" REF="205"/>
Wilmot, who was formerly designed to be married to my son George; but whose match was broken off, as already related. As soon as she saw me, she flew to my arms with the utmost joy. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear sir,"</Q> cried she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to what happy accident is it that we owe so unexpected a visit? I am sure my uncle and aunt will be in raptures when they find they have the good Dr. Prim∣rose for their guest."</Q> Upon hearing my name, the old gentleman and lady very po∣litely stept up, and welcomed me with most cordial hospitality. Nor could they forbear smiling upon being informed of the nature of my present visit: but the unfortunate butler, whom they at first seemed disposed to turn away, was, at my intercession, forgiven.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold and his lady, to whom the house belonged now, insisted upon having the pleasure of my stay for some days, and as their niece, my charming pupil, whose mind, in some measure, had been formed
<PB N="210" REF="206"/>
under my own instructions, joined in their entreaties, I complied. That night I was shewn to a magnificent chamber, and the next morning early Miss Wilmot desired to walk with me in the garden, which was deco∣rated in the modern manner. After some time spent in pointing out the beauties of the place, she enquired with seeming unconcern, when last I had heard from my son George. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Alas! Madam,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he has now been near three years absent, without ever writing to his friends or me. Where he is I know not; perhaps I shall never see him or happiness more. No, my dear Madam, we shall never more see such pleasing hours as were once spent by our fire-side at Wakefield. My little family are now dispersing very fast, and poverty has brought not only want, but infamy upon us."</Q> The good-natured girl let fall a tear at this account; but as I saw her possessed of too much sensibility, I forbore a more minute detail of our sufferings. It
<PB N="211" REF="207"/>
was, however, some consolation to me to find that time had made no alteration in her affections, and that she had rejected several matches that had been made her since our leaving her part of the country. She led me round all the extensive improvements of the place, pointing to the several walks and arbours, and at the same time catch∣ing from every object a hint for some new question relative to my son. In this manner we spent the forenoon, till the bell summoned us in to dinner, where we found the manager of the strolling compa∣ny, who was come to dispose of tickets for the Fair Penitent, which was to be acted that evening, the part of Horatio by a young gentleman who had never appeared on any stage before. He seemed to be very warm in the praises of the new performer, and averred, that he never saw any who bid so fair for excellence. Acting, he ob∣served, was not learned in a day; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But this gentleman,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"seems born to tread the stage. His voice, his
<PB N="212" REF="208"/>
figure, and attitudes, are all admirable. We caught him up accidentally in our jour∣ney down."</Q> This account, in some mea∣sure, excited our curiosity, and, at the entreaty of the ladies, I was prevailed upon to ac∣company them to the play-house, which was no other than a barn. As the company with which I went was incontestably the chief of the place, we were received with the greatest respect, and placed in the front seat of the theatre; where we sate for some time with no small impatience to see Horatio make his appearance. The new performer advanced at last, and I found it was my unfortunate son. He was go∣ing to begin, when, turning his eyes upon the audience, he perceived us, and stood at once speechless and immoveable. The actors behind the scene, who ascribed this pause to his natural timidity, attempted to encourage him; but instead of going on, he burst into a flood of tears, and retired off the stage. I don't know what were the sensations I felt; for they succeeded with
<PB N="213" REF="209"/>
too much rapidity for description: but I was soon awaked from this disagreeable re∣verie by Miss Wilmot, who, pale and with a trembling voice, desired me to conduct her back to her uncle's. When got home, Mr. Arnold, who was as yet a stranger to our extraordinary behaviour, being informed that the new performer was my son, sent his coach, and an invitation, for him; and as he persisted in his refusal to appear again upon the stage, the players put another in his place, and we soon had him with us. Mr. Arnold gave him the kindest reception, and I received him with my usual transport; for I could never counterfeit false resentment. Miss Wilmot's reception was mixed with seeming neglect, and yet I could perceive she acted a studied part. The tumult in her mind seemed not yet abated; she said twenty giddy things that looked like joy, and then laughed loud at her own want of meaning. At intervals she would take a sly peep at the glass, as
<PB N="214" REF="210"/>
if happy in the consciousness of unresist∣ing beauty, and often would ask questions, without giving any manner of attention to the answers.</P>
