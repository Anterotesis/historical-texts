<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH I look upon this Poem, in point of ele∣vation of diction and sublimity of sentiment, to be as highly heroical, as my Epistle to Sir William Chambers, yet I have not thought proper to add that epithet to it on the title-page. I am willing to wish that first production of my muse may preserve the di∣stinction which it now possesses, of being called <HI>The</HI> He∣roic Epistle, <HI>par excellence.</HI> Besides this consideration, the different ranks of the two persons, to whom these two works are addressed, require a difference to be made in this matter; and it would be unpardonable in me not to discriminate between a Comptroller of his Majesty's Works, and the Hackney Scribbler of a Newspaper; between a Placeman and a Pensioner, a Knight of the Polar Star, and a broken Apothecary.</P>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO DR. SHEBBEARE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>O For a thousand tongues! and every tongue</L>
<L>Like Johnson's, arm'd with words of six feet long,</L>
<L>In multitudinous vociferation</L>
<L>To panegyricize this glorious nation,</L>
<L>Whose liberty results from her taxation.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Ver. 2. <HI>Words of six feet long.]</HI> Sesquipedalia verba. HOR.</P></NOTE></L>

O, for that passive, pensionary spirit,</L>
<L>That by its prostitution proves its merit!</L>
<L>That rests on RIGHT DIVINE, all regal claims,</L>
<L>And gives to George, what<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'er it gave to James:</L>
<L N="10">Then should my Tory numbers, old Shebbeare,</L>
<L>Tickle the tatter'd fragment of thy ear!</L>
<L>Then all that once was virtuous, wise, or brave,</L>
<L>That quell'd a tyrant, that abhorr'd a slave,</L>
<L>Then Sydney's, Russel's patriot fame should fall,</L>
<L N="15">Besmear'd with mire, like black Dalrymple's gall,</L>
<L>Then, like thy prose, should my felonious verse</L>
<L>Tear each immortal plume from Nassau's hearse,</L>
<L>That modern monarchs, in that plumage gay,</L>
<L>Might stare and strut, the peacocks of a day.</L>
<L N="20">But I, like Ansty, feel myself unfit</L>
<L>To run, with hollow speed, two heats of wit.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Ver. 11. <HI>Tickle the tatter'd fragment.]</HI> Churchill, in alluding to this <HI>capital</HI> anecdote in our Doctor's life, says, in his poem called The Author,</P>
<P>The whole intent</P>
<P>Of that parade, was fame, not punishment.</P>
<P>Intimating that his ears received no detriment in the pillory. My line inti∣mates, that they did. However, if my intimation be false, it is easily refuted: the Doctor has only to expose his ears again to the public, and the real fact will be flagrant.</P></NOTE></L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="5"/>
He, at first starting, won both fame and money,</L>
<L>The betts ran high on Bladud's Ciceronè;</L>
<L>Since distanc'd quite, like a gall'd jade he winces,</L>
<L N="25">And lashes unknown priests, and praises well-known princes.</L>
<L>So I, when first I tun'd th' heroic lay,</L>
<L>Gain'd Pownall's praise, as well as Almon's pay.</L>
<L>In me the nation plac'd its tuneful hope,</L>
<L>Its second Churchill, or at least its Pope:</L>
<L N="30">Proudly I prick'd along, Sir William's squire,</L>
<L>Bade kings recite my strains and queens admire;</L>
<L>Chaste maids of honour prais'd my stout endeavour,</L>
<L>Sir Thomas swore "The fellow was damn'd clever."<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Ver. 23. <HI>Bladud's Ciceronè.]</HI> Anglice, Bath Guide.</P>
<P>Ver. 25. <HI>Lashes unknown priests.]</HI> Without a note posterity will never under∣stand this line. Two or three years ago this gentleman found himself libelled in a newspaper; and on suspecting a certain clergyman to be the author, he wrote a first canto of a poem, called The Priest Dissected, in which he prepared all chirurgical matters previous to the operation. In the mean time the parson proved an <HI>alibi,</HI> and saved his bacon. To this first and unique canto the author prefixed a something in which he exculpated himself from being the author of the Heroic Epistle, which it seems had been laid to his charge during the time the clan of Macgreggors continued without a name, and which, as the world well knows, was the only reason which prevented me from claiming the merit of that production. It is to this something, that the latter part of the line alludes. For in it he had told the public, that his Majesty had ten children, which it knew very well before. Hence the epithet <HI>well-known.</HI></P>
<P>Ver. 33. <HI>Sir Thomas.]</HI> The Petronius of the present age needs not the ad∣dition of a sirname to make the world certain who is meant by this appellative.</P></NOTE></L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="6"/>
But popularity, alas! has wings,</L>
<L N="35">And flits as soon from poets as from kings.</L>
<L>My pompous Posiscript found itself disdain'd</L>
<L>As much as Milton's Paradise regain'd—</L>
<L>And when I dar'd the Patent Snuffers handle,</L>
<L>To trim, with Pinchy's aid, Old England's candle,</L>
<L N="40">The lyric muse, so lame was her condition,</L>
<L>Could hardly hop beyond a third edition.</L>
<L>Yes, 'tis a general truth, and strange as true,</L>
<L>(Kenrick shall prove it in his next Review)</L>
<L>That no one bard, in these degenerate days,</L>
<L N="45">Can write two works deserving equal praise.</L>
<L>Whether the matter of which minds are made</L>
<L>Be grown of late mephitic and decay'd,</L>
<L>Or wants phlogiston, I forbear to say,</L>
<L>The problem's more in Doctor Priestley's way.</L>
<L N="50">He knows of spirit the material whole,</L>
<L>For Priestley has the cure of Sh-lb—e's soul.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Ver. 51. <HI>The cure of Sh-lb—e's soul.]</HI> It is not here insinuated, that the soul in question wants curing. The word <HI>cure</HI> is here put for <HI>care,</HI> in the sense in which ecclesiastical lawyers use <HI>cura animarum.</HI></P></NOTE></L>

<L>Enough of souls, unless we waste a line,</L>
<L>Shebbeare! to pay a compliment to thine:</L>
<L>Which forg'd, of old, of strong Hibernian brass,</L>
<L N="55">Shines through the Paris plaister of thy face,</L>
<L>And bronzes it, secure from shame, or sense,</L>

<L>When pilloried, or pension'd by a King.</L>
<L>Old as thou art, methinks, 'twere sage advice,</L>
<L>That N—th should call thee off from hunting Price.</L>
<L>Some younger blood-hound of his bawling pack</L>
<L N="65">Might sorer gall his presbyterian back.</L>
<L>Thy toothless jaws should free thee from the fight;</L>
<L>Thou canst but mumble, when thou mean'st to bite.</L>
<L>Say, then, to give a <HI>requiem</HI> to thy toils,</L>
<L>What if my muse array'd her in thy spoils?</L>
<L N="70">And took the field for thee, thro' pure good-nature;</L>
<L>Courts prais'd by thee, are curs'd beyond her satire.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Ver. 63. <HI>From hunting Price.]</HI> See a series of wretched letters, written by Shebbeare, in the Public Advertiser, and other papers.</P></NOTE></L>

Yet, when she pleases, she can deal in praise:</L>
<L><HI>Exempli gratia,</HI> hear her fluent lays</L>
<L>Extol the present, the propitious hour,</L>
<L N="75">When Europe, trembling at Britannia's power,</L>
<L>Bids all her princes, with pacific care,</L>
<L>Keep neutral distance, while she wings the war</L>
<L>Cross the Atlantic vast; in dread array,</L>
<L>Herself to vanquish in America.</L>
<L N="80">Where soon, we trust, the brother chiefs shall see</L>
<L>The Congress pledge them in a cup of tea,</L>
<L>Toast peace and plenty to their mother nation,</L>
<L>Give three huzzas to George and to taxation,</L>
<L>And beg, to make their loyal hearts the lighter,</L>
<L N="85">He'd send them o'er Dean T—k-r, with a mitre.</L>
<L>In Fancy's eye, I ken them from afar</L>
<L>Circled with feather wreaths, unstain'd by tar:</L>
<L>In place of laurels, these shall bind their brow,</L>
<L>Fame, honour, virtue, all are feathers now.</L>
<L N="90">Ev'n beauty's self, unfeather'd, if we spy,</L>
<L>Is hideous to our Macaroni eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Foolish the bard, who, in such flimsy times,</L>
<L>Would load with satire or with sense his rhymes:</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="9"/>
No, let my numbers flutter light in air,</L>
<L N="95">As careless as the silken Goffimer.</L>
<L>Or should I, playful, lift the muse's scourge,</L>
<L>Thy cocks should lend their tails, my Cocking G—,</L>
<L>To make the rod. So fear not thou the song;</L>
<L>To whip a post, I ne'er will waste a thong.</L>
<L N="100">Were I inclin'd to punish courtly tools,</L>
<L>I'd lash the knaves before I slapt the fools▪</L>
<L>Gigantic vice should on my ordeal burn,</L>
<L>Long ere it came to thy poor pigmy turn.</L>

<L>But sure 'tis best, whate'er rash Whigs may say,</L>
<L N="105">To sleep within a whole skin, while one may;</L>

<L>If credence in A—hb—ps may be had.</L>
<L>Therefore I'll keep within discretion's rule,</L>
<L>And turn true Tory of the M—d school.</L>

<L N="175">Irradiate vestal Majesty at Zell?<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Ver. 168. <HI>Earl N—t sung.]</HI> The intellect not only of posterity, but of the present reader, must here again be enlightened by a note: for this song was sung above two years ago, and is consequently forgotten. Yet if the reader will please to recollect how easily I brought to life Sir William Chambers's prose dissertation which had been dead half that time, he will, I hope, give me cre∣dit for being able to recover this dead poem from oblivion also. It was sent to her Majesty on her birth-day, with a present of Irish grogram; and the newspaper of the day said (but I know not how truly) that the Queen was gra∣ciously pleased to thank the noble author for both his pieces of <HI>stuff:</HI> The po∣et's exordium seemed to have been taken from that very Ode in Horace which I have also attempted to imitate in this pamphlet. It began by assuring her Majesty, that Ireland was too poor to present her with a piece of gold plate.</P>
<L>Could poor Iërne gifts afford,</L>
<L>Worthy the consort of her lord,</L>
<L>Of purest gold a sculpter'd frame</L>
<L>Just emblem of her zeal should flame.</L>
<P>This supposed poverty of his native country struck me at the time as a mere <HI>gratis-dictum.</HI> I have therefore, from verse 180 to verse 186 of this epistle, endeavoured to refute it, for the honour of Ireland.</P></NOTE></L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="14"/>
Sure then she might afford, to my poor thinking,</L>
<L>One golden tumbler, for Queen Charlotte's drinking.</L>
<L>I care not, if her hinds on fens and rocks,</L>
<L>Ne'er roast one shoulder of their fatted flocks,</L>
<L N="180">Shall Irish binds to mutton make pretensions?</L>
<L>Be theirs potatoes, and be ours their pensions.</L>
<L>If they refuse, great North, by me advis'd,</L>
<L>Enact, that each potatoe be excis'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! hadst thou, North, adopted this sage plan,</L>
<L N="185">And scorn'd to tax each British serving-man,</L>
<L>Thy friend Macgreggor, when he came to town,</L>
<L>(As poets should do) in his chaise and one,</L>
<L>Had seen his foot-boy Sawney, once his pride,</L>
<L>On stunt Scotch poney trotting by his side,</L>
<L N="190">With frock of fustian, and with cape of red,</L>
<L>Nor grudg'd the guinea tax'd upon his head.</L>
<L>But tush, I heed not—for my country's good</L>
<L>I'll pay it—it will purchase Yankee blood—<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Ver. 178.] <HI>I care not,</HI> &amp;c.] Alluding to these lines in the same poem:
<Q><L>Where starving hinds from fens and rocks,</L>
<L>View pastures rich with herds and flocks.</L>
<L>And only view—forbid to taste, &amp;c.</L></Q>
And in a note on the passage, he tells us that these hinds never eat animal food; but says not one word about potatoes, that most nutritious of all aliments, which is surely very disingenuous.</P></NOTE></L>

And well I ween, for this heroic lay,</L>

<L>Tax then, ye greedy ministers, your fill:</L>
<L>No matter, if with ignorance or skill.</L>
<L>Be ours to pay, and that's an easy task,</L>
<L>In these blest times to have is but to ask.</L>
<L N="200">Ye know, whate'er is from the public prest,</L>
<L>Will sevenfold sink into your private chest.</L>
<L>For he, the nursing father, that receives,</L>
<L>Full freely tho' he takes, as freely gives.</L>

<L N="205">Bids orient pearls from golden dragons fall,</L>
<L>Each little dragonet, with brazen grin,</L>
<L>Gapes for the precious prize, and gulps it in.</L>
<L>Yet when we peep behind the magic scene,</L>
<L>One master-wheel directs the whole machine:</L>
<L N="210">The self-same pearls, in nice gradation, all</L>
<L>Around one common centre, rise and fall.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Ver. 211. <HI>Around one common centre.]</HI> I was let into this secret by my late patron, Sir William Chambers; who, as Mr. Cox's automata were very much in the Chinese taste, was very curious to discover their mechanism. I must do the Knight the justice to own that some of my best things are borrowed from him.</P></NOTE></L>

Thus may our state-museum long surprise;</L>
<L>And what is sunk by votes in bribes arise;</L>
<L>Till mock'd and jaded with the puppet-play,</L>
<L N="215">Old England's genius turns with scorn away,</L>
<L>Ascends his sacred bark, the sails unfurl'd,</L>
<L>And steers his state to the wide western world:</L>
<L>High on the helm majestic Freedom stands,</L>
<L>In act of cold contempt she waves her hands.</L>
<L N="220">Take, slaves, she cries, the realms that I disown,</L>
<L>Renounce your birth-right, and destroy my throne.</L>

<HEAD>HORACE, ODE VIII. BOOK IV. IMITATED.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MUSE! were we rich in land, or stocks,</L>
<L>We'd send Sir Fletcher a <SUP>a</SUP> gold box;</L>
<L>Who lately, to the world's surprize,</L>
<L>Advis'd his Sovereign to be wise.</L>
<L N="5">The zeal of cits shou'd ne'er surpass us,</L>
<L>We'd make him speaker of Parnassus.</L>
<L>Or could I boast the mimic eye</L>
<L>Of <SUP>b</SUP> Townshend, or of Bunbury,</L>
<L>Whose art can catch, in comic guise,</L>
<L N="10">"The manners living as they rise,"</L>
<L>And find it the same easy thing</L>
<L>To <SUP>c</SUP> hit a Jollux or a king;</L>
<L>I'd hangings weave, in fancy's loom,</L>
<L>For Lady Norton's dressing room.
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Line 12. <HI>A Jollux.]</HI> A phrase used by the <HI>bon ton</HI> for a fat parson. See a set of excellent Caricatures published by Bretherton, in New Bond-Street.</P></NOTE></L>

<L N="15">But <SUP>d</SUP> arts like these I don't pursue,</L>
<L>Nor <SUP>e</SUP> does Sir Fletcher heed virtù.</L>
<L>Enough for me in these hard times,</L>
<L>When ev'ry thing is tax'd but rhymes,</L>
<L>To <SUP>f</SUP> tag a few of these together:</L>
<L N="20">Tho' I am quite uncertain, whether</L>
<L>My verse will much rejoice the knight,</L>
<L>As <SUP>g</SUP> great a store as I set by't.</L>
<L>For verse, (I'd have Sir Fletcher know it)</L>
<L>When written by a genuine poet,</L>
<L N="25">Has more of meaning and intent,</L>
<L>Than <SUP>h</SUP> modern acts of Parliament.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis <SUP>i</SUP> fit and right, when heroes die,</L>
<L>The nation should a tomb supply;</L>
<L>Yet, not the votes of both the houses,</L>
<L N="30">Without th' assistance of the muses,</L>
<L>Can give that permanence of fame</L>
<L>That heroes from their country claim.</L>
<L>And tell me pray, to our good King,</L>
<L>What fame our present broils can bring,</L>
<L N="35">Ev'n <SUB>k</SUB> should the Howes (which some folks doubt)</L>
<L>Put Washington to total rout,</L>

<L>A man, I know, may get a pension</L>
<L N="40">Without the muse's intervention?</L>
<L>Yet what are pensions to the praise</L>
<L>Wrapt up in <SUP>l</SUP> Caledonian lays?</L>
<L>Say, Johnson! where had been <SUP>m</SUP> Fingal,</L>
<L>But for Macpherson's great assistance?</L>
<L N="45">The chieftain had been nought at all,</L>
<L>A non-existing non-existence.</L>
<L>Mac, like a <SUP>n</SUP> poet stout and good,</L>
<L>First <SUP>o</SUP> plung'd, then pluck'd him from oblivion's flood,</L>
<L>And bad him bluster at his ease,</L>
<L N="50">Among the fruitful Hebrides.</L>
<L>A <SUP>p</SUP> common poet can revive</L>
<L>The man who once had been alive:</L>
<L>But Mac revives, by magic power,</L>
<L>The man who never liv'd before.
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Ver. 37. <HI>Unless his treasurer.]</HI> The late promotion of a poet to the treasu∣rership of the houshold, must necessarily give to all true votaries of the muses (as it does to me) great delectation. 'Tis whispered, by some people in the secret, that the very pacific cast of the Laureat's birth-day ode, occasioned the noble bard's exaltation; as it was thought expedient to have another poetical placeman in readiness to celebrate the final overthrow of the American rebels. Nay, it is assured, that a reversionary grant of the office of laureat has in this instance been superadded to the treasurership, yet with the defalcation of the annual butt of sack, which the Lord Steward calculates will be a considerable saving to the nation.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>Dub them immortal from their birth,</L>

<P>The following are printed in the same size and manner as the New Foundling for Wit, and being collections of Fugitive Pieces upon the same plan, may be had bound uniform with that work, price 1l. 10s. or sepa∣rate, at the prices undermentioned.</P>

<ITEM>The Fugitive Miscellany; being a col∣lection of such Fugitive Pieces, in prose and verse, as are not in any other collection; with many pieces never before published. By several Noblemen and Gentle∣men. In two volumes, price 5s. sewed, or 6s. bound.</ITEM>

<ITEM>{inverted ⁂} The New Foundling Hospital for Wit, &amp;c. being completed, it has been desired to continue the plan of collecting such fugitive pieces of merit, as are either circulated in MS. or occasionally printed in the temporary publications of the day, under the title of <HI>The Asylum.</HI> Though this work may be called a continuation of the former, being printed in the same size and manner; yet the publication being more fre∣quent, affords a greater variety, and therefore it is hoped, will prove as agreeable to the public.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Those gentlemen who wish to see any of their pieces pre∣served it this collection, may be assuted, that their favours will, at all times, be most gratefully re∣ceived.</ITEM>
