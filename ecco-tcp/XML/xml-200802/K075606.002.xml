<BYLINE>BY MR. JOHN CARYLL<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John Caryll, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was probably a Sussex man, and wrote two plays,
"The English Princess, or the Death of Richard III, 1667," quarto;
and
"Sir Salomon, or the Cautious Coxcomb, 1671," quarto.
It may be conjectured that he was of the Roman Catholic persuasion, being secre∣tary to Queen Mary the wife of James the Second, and one who followed the fortunes of his abdicating master. How long he continued in this service is unknown, but he was in England in the reign of Queen Anne, and recommended the subject of Mr. Pope's "Rape of the Lock" to that au∣thor, who on its publication addressed it to him. He was alive in 1717, and at that time must have been a very old man. See three of his Letters in "Additions to Pope," vol. II. p. 114. R.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<L>IN peaceful shades, which aged oaks diffuse,</L>
<L>You, Tityrus, enjoy your royal Muse.</L>
<L>We leave our home, and (once) our pleasant fields,</L>
<L>The native swain to rude intruders yields;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="5"/>While you in songs your happy love proclaim,</L>
<L>And every grove learns Amaryllis name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader may be pleased to observe, that Virgil, un∣der the name of Tityrus, personates himself, newly saved by the favour of Augustus Caesar, from the general calamity of his Mantuan neighbours; whose lands were taken from them, and divided amongst the veteran soldiers, for having been dipt (as may be presumed) in the same guilt with their borderers of Cremo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a; who, in the civil wars, joined with Cassius and Brutus. These Mantuans are likewise personated by Meliboeus; as also by Amaryllis the city of Rome, by Galatea that of Mantua, are represented. The drift of this E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>logue is to celebrate the munificence of Augustus towards Virgil, whom he makes his tutelar God; and the better to set this off, he brings in Meliboeus, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Mantuan neigh∣bours, pathetically relating their own deplorable condition, and at the same time magnifying the felicity of Tityrus. This his exemption from the common calamity of his coun∣trymen, Virgil shadows over with the allegory of a slave re∣covering his liberty. And because slaves did not commonly use to be infranchised till age had made them useless for la∣bour; to follow the trope, he makes himself an old man, as by the Candidior Barba, and the Fortunate Senex, suffici∣ently appears; though, in reality, Virgil at that time was young, and then first made known to Augustus by the re∣commendation of his verses, and of his friends Varus and Maecenas.

<SPEAKER>TITYRUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>A God (to me he always shall be so)</L>
<L>O Meliboeus! did this grace bestow.</L>
<L>The choicest lamb which in my flock does feed</L>
<L>Shall each new moon upon his altar bleed:</L>
<L>He every blessing on his creatures brings;</L>
<L>By him the herd does graze; by him the herdsman sings.</L>

<L>I envy not, but I admire your fate,</L>

<L>Look on my goats that browze, my kids that play,</L>
<L>Driven hence myself, these I must drive away,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="6"/>And this poor mother of a new-fall'n pair</L>
<L>(The herd's chief hope, alas! but my despair!)</L>
<L>Has left them in yon brakes, beside the way,</L>
<L>Expos'd to every beast and bird of prey.</L>
<L>Had not some angry planet struck me blind,</L>
<L>This dire calamity I had divin'd.</L>
<L>'Twas oft foretold me by heaven's loudest voice,</L>
<L>Rending our tallest oaks with dismal noise:</L>
<L>Ravens spoke too, though in a lower tone,</L>
<L>And long from hollow trees were heard to groan.</L>

<SPEAKER>TITYRUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>The place call'd Rome, I foolishly believ'd</L>
<L>Was like our Mantua, where, on market-days,</L>
<L>We drive our well-fed lambs (the shepherd's praise);</L>

<L>Freedom, which came at last, though slow to come:</L>
<L>She came not till cold Winter did begin,</L>
<L>And age some snow had sprinkled on my chin,</L>
<L>Nor then, till Galatea I forsook,</L>
<L>For Amaryllis deign'd on me to look.</L>
<L>No hope for liberty, I must confess,</L>
<L>No hope, nor care of wealth, did me possess,</L>
<L>Whilst I with Galatea did remain:</L>
<L>For though my flock her altars did maintain,</L>
<L>Though often I had made my cheese-press groan,</L>
<L>Largely to furnish our ungrateful town,</L>
<L>Yet still with empty hands I trotted home.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MELIBOEUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>I wonder'd, Galatea! whence should come</L>
<L>Thy sad complaints to heaven, and why so long</L>
<L>Ungather'd on their trees thy apples hung!</L>
<L>Absent was Tityrus! thee every dale,</L>
<L>Mountain and spring, thee every tree did call!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TITYRUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>What should I do? I could not here be free,</L>
<L>And only in that place could hope to see</L>
<L>A God propitious to my liberty.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="8"/>There I the heavenly youth did first behold,</L>
<L>Whose monthly feast while solemnly I hold,</L>
<L>My loaded altars never shall be cold.</L>
<L>He heard my prayers; go home, he cry'd, and feed</L>
<L>In peace your herd, let forth your bulls for breed.</L>

<SPEAKER>MELIBOEUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Happy old man! thy farm untouch'd remains,</L>
<L>And large enough: though it may ask thy pains,</L>
<L>To clear the stones, and rushes cure by drains.</L>
<L>Thy teeming ewes will no strange pastures try,</L>
<L>No murrain fear from tainted company.</L>
<L>Thrice happy swain! guarded from Syrian beams,</L>
<L>By sacred springs, and long-acquainted streams.</L>
<L>Look on that bordering fence, whose osier trees</L>
<L>Are fraught with flowers, whose flowers are fraught with bees:</L>
<L>How, with their drowsy tone, the whistling air</L>
<L>(Your sleep to tempt) a concert does prepare!</L>
<L>At farther distance, but with stronger lungs,</L>
<L>The wood-man joins with these his rustic songs:</L>
<L>Stock-doves and murmuring turtles tune their throat,</L>
<L>Those in a hoarser, these a softer note.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TITYRUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Therefore the land and sea shall dwellers change:</L>
<L>Fish on dry ground, stags shall on water range:</L>
<L>The Parthians shall commute their bounds with Francs,</L>
<L>Those shall on Soane, these drink on Tygris' banks,</L>
<L>Ere I his god-like image from my heart</L>
<L>Suffer with black ingratitude to part.</L>
</SP>

<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>MELIBOEUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>But we must roam to parts remote, unknown,</L>
<L>Under the Torrid and the Frigid Zone:</L>
<L>These frozen Scythia, and parch'd Africk those,</L>
<L>Cretan Oaxis others must inclose:</L>
<L>Some 'mongst the utmost Britains are confin'd,</L>
<L>Doom'd to an isle from all the world disjoin'd.</L>
<L>Ah! must I never more my country see,</L>
<L>But in strange lands an endless exile be?</L>
<L>Is my eternal banishment decreed,</L>
<L>From my poor cottage, rear'd with turf and reed?</L>
<L>Must impious soldiers all these grounds possess,</L>
<L>My fields of standing corn, my fertile leyes?</L>
<L>Did I for these barbarians plow and sow?</L>
<L>What dire effects from civil discord flow!</L>
<L>Graft pears, O Meliboeus! plant the vine!</L>
<L>The fruit shall others be, the labour thine.</L>
<L>Farewell my goats! a happy herd, when mine!</L>
<L>No more shall I, in the refreshing shade</L>
<L>Of verdant grottoes, by kind nature made,</L>
<L>Behold you climbing on the mountain top,</L>
<L>The flowery thyme and fragrant shrubs to crop.</L>
<L>I part with every joy, parting from you;</L>
<L>Then farewell all the world! verses and pipe, adieu!</L>

<HEAD>ECLOGUE II.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. NAHUM TATE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Born about the middle of the reign of king Charles II. in the kingdom of Ireland, where he received his education. He was made poet laureat to king William, upon the death of Shadwell, and held that place till the accession of George I. on whom he lived to write the first birth-day ode, which is executed with unusual spirit. He was a man of good-nature, great probity, and competent learning; but so extremely modest, that he was never able to make his fortune, or to raise himself above necessity. The earl of Dorset was his patron; but the chief use he made of him was, to screen himself from the persecution of his creditors. He died in the Mint, August 12, 1716; and was succeeded in the laurel by Mr. Eusden. He was the author of nine dramatic per∣formances, a great number of poems, and of a version of the Psalms in conjunction with Dr. Nicholas Brady. He was a man of wit and parts, yet not thought to possess any very great genius, as being deficient in what is its first character∣istic, namely, invention. Thus far the Biographical Dicti∣onary.—His miscellaneous poems are enumerated by Jacob, who says, Tate's poem on the Death of Queen Anne, which was one of the last, is
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"one of the best poems he ever wrote."</Q>
His share in the
"Second Part of Absalom and Achitophel"
is far from inconsiderable; and may be seen in the English Poets, vol. XIII. p. 160.
He published also "Memorials for the Learned, collected out of eminent Au∣thors in History, &amp;c. 1686,"
8vo. and his
"Proposal for regulating of the Stage and Stage Plays, Feb. 6, 1698,"
is among Bishop Gibson's MSS. in the Lambeth Library. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>
<L>A HOPELESS flame did Corydon destroy,</L>
<L>The lov'd Alexis was his master's joy.</L>
<L>No respite from his grief the shepherd knew,</L>
<L>But daily walk'd where shady beeches grew:</L>
<L>Where, stretch'd on earth, alone he thus complains,</L>
<L>And in these accents tells the groves his pains.</L>
<L>Cruel Alexis! hast thou no remorse?</L>
<L>Must I expire? and have my songs no force?</L>
<L>'Tis now high noon, when herds to coverts run,</L>
<L>The very lizards hide, that love the sun.</L>
<L>The reapers home to dinner now repair,</L>
<L>While busy Thestylis provides both sauce and fare.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="11"/>Yet in the raging heat I search for thee,</L>

<L>And still be subject to Menalcas' sway,</L>
<L>Though he more black than night, and thou more fair than day?</L>
<L>O lovely boy, presume not on thy form;</L>
<L>The fairest flowers are subject to a storm:</L>
<L>Thou both disdain'st my person and my flame,</L>
<L>Without so much as asking who I am!</L>
<L>How rich in he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fers, all as white as snow,</L>
<L>Or cream, with which they make my dairies flow.</L>
<L>A thousand ewes within my pastures breed,</L>
<L>And all the year upon new milk I feed.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="12"/>Besides, the fam'd Amphion's songs I sing,</L>
<L>That into Theban walls the stones did bring,</L>
<L>Nor am I so deform'd; for t'other day,</L>
<L>When all the dreadful storm was blown away,</L>
<L>As on the cliffs above the sea I stood,</L>
<L>I view'd my image in the sea-green flood;</L>
<L>And if I look as handsome all the year,</L>
<L>To vie with Daphnis' self I would not fear.</L>
<L>Ah! would'st thou once in cottages delight,</L>
<L>And love, like me, to wound the stag in flight!</L>
<L>Where wholesome mallows grow our kids to drive,</L>
<L>And in our songs with Pan himself to strive!</L>
<L>From Pan the reed's first use the shepherd knew,</L>
<L>'Tis Pan preserves the sheep and shepherd too.</L>
<L>Disdain not then the tuneful reed to ply,</L>
<L>Nor scorn the pastime of a deity.</L>

<L>With streaks of lovely white enamel'd o'er;</L>
<L>Who drain the bagging udder twice a-day,</L>
<L>And both at home for thy acceptance stay.</L>
<L>Oft Thestylis for them has pin'd, and she</L>
<L>Shall have them, since thou scorn'st my gifts and me.</L>
<L>Come to my arms, thou lovely boy, and take</L>
<L>The richest presents that the spring can make.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="13"/>See how the nymphs with lilies wait on thee:</L>
<L>Fair Naïs, scarce thyself so fair as she,</L>
<L>With poppies, daffadils, and violets join'd,</L>
<L>A garland for thy softer brow has twin'd.</L>
<L>Myself with downy peaches will appear,</L>
<L>And chesnuts, Amaryllis' dainty cheer:</L>
<L>I'll crop my laurel, and my myrtle tree,</L>
<L>Together bound, because their sweets agree.</L>
<L>Unbred thou art, and homely, Corydon,</L>
<L>Nor will Alexis with thy gifts be won:</L>
<L>Nor canst thou hope, if gifts his mind could sway,</L>
<L>That rich Iölas would to thee give way.</L>
<L>Ah me! while I fond wretch indulge my dreams,</L>
<L>Winds blast my flowers, and boars bemire my streams.</L>
<L>Whom fly'st thou? Gods themselves have had abode</L>

<L>Lions chace wolves, those wolves a kid in prime,</L>
<L>That very kid seeks heaths of flowering thyme,</L>
<L>While Corydon pursues with equal flame,</L>
<L>Alexis, thee; each has his several game.</L>
<L>See how the ox unyok'd brings home the plough,</L>
<L>The shades increasing as the sun goes low.</L>
<L>Blest fields reliev'd by night's approach so soon,</L>
<L>Love has no night! 'tis always raging noon!</L>
<L>Ah Corydon! what frenzy fills thy breast?</L>
<L>Thy vineyard lies half prun'd and half undrest.</L>

<SPEAKER>ALEXIS.</SPEAKER>
<L>YOUNG Corydon, hard fate! an humble swain,</L>
<L>Alexis lov'd, the joy of all the plain;</L>
<L>He lov'd, but could not hope for love again;</L>
<L>Yet every day through groves he walk'd alone,</L>
<L>And vainly told the hills and woods his moan:</L>
<L>Cruel Alexis! can't my verses move?</L>
<L>Hast thou no pity? must I die for love?</L>
<L>Just now the flocks pursue the shades and cool,</L>
<L>And every lizard creeps into his hole:</L>
<L>Brown Thestylis the weary reapers seeks,</L>
<L>And brings their meat, their onions, and their leeks:</L>
<L>And whilst I trace thy steps, in every tree</L>
<L>And every bush, poor insects sigh with me:</L>
<L>Ah! had it not been better to have borne</L>
<L>The peevish Amaryllis' frown and scorn,</L>
<L>Or else Menalcas, than this deep despair?</L>
<L>Though he was black, and thou art lovely fair!</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="15"/>Ah, charming beauty! 'tis a fading grace,</L>
<L>Trust not too much, sweet youth, to that fair face:</L>
<L>Things are not always us'd that please the sight,</L>
<L>We gather black-berries when we scorn the white.</L>
<L>Thou dost despise me, thou dost scorn my flame,</L>
<L>Yet dost not know me, nor how rich I am:</L>
<L>A thousand tender lambs, a thousand kine,</L>
<L>A thousand goats I feed, and all are mine:</L>
<L>My dairy's full, and my large herd affords,</L>
<L>Summer and winter, cream, and milk, and curds,</L>
<L>I pipe as well, as when through Theban plains</L>
<L>Amphion fed his flocks, or charm'd the swains.</L>
<L>Nor is my face so mean; I lately stood,</L>
<L>And view'd my figure in the quiet flood,</L>
<L>And think myself, though it were judg'd by you,</L>
<L>As fair as Daphnis, if that glass be true.</L>
<L>Oh that, with me, thee humble plains would please,</L>
<L>The quiet fields and lowly cottages!</L>
<L>Oh that with me you'd live, and hunt the hare,</L>
<L>Or drive the kids, or spread the fowling snare!</L>
<L>Then we would sing like Pan in shady groves;</L>
<L>Pan taught us pipes, and Pan our art approves:</L>
<L>Pan both the sheep and harmless shepherd loves.</L>
<L>Nor must you think the pipe too mean for you;</L>
<L>To learn to pipe, what won't Amyntas do?</L>
<L>I have a pipe, well-season'd, brown, and try'd;</L>
<L>Which good Damaetas left me when he died:</L>
<L>He said, Here, take it for a legacy,</L>
<L>Thou art my second, it belongs to thee;</L>
<L>He said, and dull Amyntas envy'd me.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="16"/>Besides, I found two wanton kids at play</L>
<L>In yonder vale, and those I brought away,</L>
<L>Young sportive creatures, and of spotted hue,</L>
<L>Which suckle twice a-day, I keep for you:</L>
<L>These Thestylis hath begg'd, and begg'd in vain,</L>
<L>But now they 're hers, since you my gifts disdain:</L>
<L>Come, lovely boy, the nymphs their baskets fill,</L>
<L>With poppy, violet, and daffadil,</L>
<L>The rose and thousand other fragrant flowers,</L>
<L>To please thy senses in thy softest hours;</L>
<L>These Naïs gathers to delight my boy,</L>
<L>Come, dear Alexis, be no longer coy.</L>
<L>I'll seek for chesnuts too in every grove,</L>
<L>Such as my Amaryllis us'd to love.</L>
<L>The glossy plumbs and juicy pears I'll bring,</L>
<L>Delightful all, and many a pretty thing:</L>
<L>The laurel and the neighbouring myrtle tree,</L>
<L>Confus'dly planted 'cause they both agree</L>
<L>And prove more sweet, shall send their boughs to thee.</L>
<L>Ah, Corydon! thou art a foolish swain,</L>
<L>And coy Alexis doth thy gifts disdain;</L>
<L>Or if gifts could prevail, if gifts could woo,</L>
<L>Iölas can present him more than you.</L>
<L>What doth the madman mean? he idly brings</L>
<L>Storms on his flowers, and boars into his springs.</L>
<L>Ah! whom dost thou avoid? whom fly? the Gods,</L>
<L>And charming Paris too, have liv'd in woods:</L>
<L>Let Pallas, she whose art first rais'd a town,</L>
<L>Live there, let us delight in woods alone:</L>
<L>The boar the wolf, the wolf the kid pursues,</L>
<L>The kid her thyme, as fast as t' other does,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="17"/>Alexis Corydon, and him alone,</L>
<L>Each hath his game, and each pursues his own:</L>
<L>Look how the wearied ox brings home the plough,</L>
<L>The sun declines, and shades are doubled now:</L>
<L>And yet my passion nor my cares remove,</L>
<L>Love burns me still, what flame so fierce as Love!</L>
<L>Ah Corydon! what fury's this of thine!</L>
<L>On yonder elm there hangs thy half-prun'd vine:</L>
<L>Come, rather mind thy useful work, prepare</L>
<L>Thy harvest baskets, and make those thy care;</L>

"Fifteen Discourses occasionally delivered before the University of Oxford. By William Adams, M.A. late student of Christ Church, and rector of Staunton upon Wye in Here∣fordshire. Published by Henry Sacheverell, D.D. 1716."
This volume, of which a second edition was published the same year, is inscribed to Richard Hopton, esq. knight of the shire for the county of Hereford, to whom Mr. Adams had been tutor at Christ Church; an employment be appears to have been well qualified for discharging. In his younger years he gave many admirable specimens of his polite genius, in his accurate performances in Poetry and Oratory; and had afterwards the honour to be chosen his master Dr. Busby's first Catachetical Lecturer in Oxford. To answer the pious and charitable design of that great founder of learning, he bent the whole course of his studies to Divinity, of which he is said to have drawn out a comprehensive and useful plan which at his death he directed his executors to destroy, with all his MSS. except the volume of Discourses, which appeared by his express injunction.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>This Eclogue is wholly pastoral, and consists of the contention of two shepherds, Thyrsis and Corydon; to the hearing of which Mcliboeus was invited by Daphnis, and thus relates it.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<L>WHILE Daphnis sate beneath a whispering shade,</L>
<L>Thyrsis and Corydon together fed</L>
<L>Their mingling flocks; his sheep with softest wool</L>
<L>Were cloath'd, his goats of sweetest milk were full.</L>
<L>Both in the beauteous spring of blooming youth,</L>
<L>The worthy pride of blest Arcadia both;</L>
<L>Each with like art his tuneful voice could raise,</L>
<L>Each answer readily in rural lays;</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="25"/>Hither the father of my flock had stray'd,</L>
<L>While shelters I for my young myrtles made;</L>
<L>Here I fair Daphnis saw; when me he spy'd,</L>
<L>Come hither quickly, gentle youth! he cry'd.</L>
<L>Your goat and kids are safe, O seek not those,</L>
<L>But, if you've leisure, in this shade repose:</L>
<L>Hither to water the full heifers tend,</L>
<L>When lengthening shadows from the hills descend,</L>
<L>Mincius with reeds here interweaves his bounds,</L>
<L>And from that sacred oak a busy swarm resounds.</L>
<L>What should I do? Nor was Alcippe there,</L>
<L>Nor Phyllis, who might of my lambs take care;</L>
<L>Yet to my business I their sports prefer.</L>
<L>For the two swains with great ambition strove,</L>
<L>Who best could tune his reed, or best could sing his love;</L>
<L>Alternate verse their ready Muses chose,</L>
<L>In verse alternate each quick fancy flows;</L>
<L>These sang young Corydon, young Thyrsis those.</L>

<L>Begin my Gallus' love and hapless vows;</L>
<L>While on the tender twigs the cattle browze:</L>

<L>And echoing groves resound, and mountains ring.</L>
<L>Ye Naiades, what held you from his aid,</L>
<L>When to unpitied flames he was betray'd?</L>
<L>Nor Aganippe tempted you away,</L>
<L>Nor was Parnassus guilty of your stay:</L>
<L>The bays, whose honours he so long had kept,</L>
<L>The lofty bays and humble herbage wept.</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="33"/>When, stretch'd beneath a rock, he sigh'd alone,</L>
<L>The mountain pines and Maenalus did groan,</L>
<L>And cold Lycaeus wept from every stone.</L>
<L>His flock surrounded him: nor think thy fame</L>
<L>Impair'd, great poet! by a shepherd's name;</L>
<L>Ere thou and I our sheep to pastures led,</L>
<L>His flocks the Goddess-lov'd Adonis fed.</L>
<L>The shepherds came; the sluggish neat-herd swains,</L>
<L>And swine-herds reeking from their mast and grains.</L>
<L>All ask'd, from whence this frenzy? Phoebus came</L>
<L>To see his poet, Phoebus ask'd the same:</L>
<L>And is (he cry'd) that cruel nymph thy care,</L>
<L>Who, flying thee, can for thy rival dare</L>
<L>The frosts and snow, and all the frightful forms of war?</L>
<L>Sylvanus came, thy fortune to deplore;</L>
<L>A wreath of lilies on his head he wore.</L>
<L>Pan came, and wondering we beheld him too,</L>
<L>His skin all dy'd of a vermilion hue:</L>
<L>He cry'd, What mad designs dost thou pursue?</L>
<L>Nor satisfy'd with dew the grass appears,</L>
<L>With browze the kids, nor cruel love with tears,</L>
<L>When thus (and sorrow melted in his eyes)</L>
<L>Gallus to his Arcadian friends replies:</L>
<L>Ye gentle swains, sing to the rocks my moan</L>
<L>(For you, Arcadian swains, should sing alone):</L>
<L>How calm a rest my wearied ghost would have,</L>
<L>If you adorn'd my love, and mourn'd my grave!</L>
<L>O that your birth and business had been mine,</L>
<L>To feed a flock, or press the swelling vine!</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="34"/>Had Phyllis or had Galatea been</L>
<L>My love, or any maid upon the green,</L>
<L>(What if her face the nut-brown livery wear,</L>
<L>Are violets not sweet, because not fair?)</L>
<L>Secure in that unenvied state, among</L>
<L>The poplars, I my careless limbs had flung;</L>
<L>Phyllis had made me wreaths, and Galatea sung.</L>
<L>Behold, fair nymph what bliss the country yields,</L>
<L>The flowery meads, the purling streams, the laugh∣ing fields.</L>
<L>Next, all the pleasures of the forest see,</L>
<L>Where I could melt away my years with thee.</L>
<L>But furious Love denies me soft repose,</L>
<L>And hurls me on the pointed spears of foes.</L>
<L>While thou (but ah! that I should find it so!)</L>
<L>Without thy Gallus for thy guide dost go</L>
<L>Through all the German colds and Alpine snow.</L>
<L>Yet, flying me, no hardship may'st thou meet;</L>
<L>Nor snow nor ice offend those tender feet.</L>
<L>But let me run to desarts, and rehearse</L>
<L>On my Sicilian reeds Euphorion's verse:</L>
<L>Ev'n in the dens of monsters let me lie;</L>
<L>Those I can tame, but not your cruelty.</L>
<L>On smoothest rinds of trees I'll carve my woe;</L>
<L>And as the rinds increase, the love shall grow.</L>
<L>Then, mixt with nymphs, on Maenalus resort;</L>
<L>I'll make the boar my danger and my sport.</L>
<L>When from the vales the jolly cry resounds,</L>
<L>What rain or cold shall keep me from my hounds?</L>
<L>Methinks my ears the sprightly concert fills;</L>
<L>I seem to bound through woods and mount o'er hills.</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="35"/>My arm of a Cydonian javelin seiz'd,</L>
<L>As if by this my madness could be eas'd;</L>
<L>Or, by our mortal woes, the cruel God appeas'd:</L>
<L>My frenzy changes now; and nymphs and verse I hate,</L>
<L>And woods; for ah, what toil can stubborn love abate!</L>
<L>Should we to drink the frozen Hebrus go,</L>
<L>And shiver in the cold Sithonian snow,</L>
<L>Or to the swarthy Ethiops clime remove,</L>
<L>Parch'd all below, and burning all above,</L>
<L>Ev'n there would Love o'ercome; then let us yield to Love.</L>
<L>Let this sad lay suffice, by sorrow breath'd,</L>
<L>While bending twigs I into baskets wreath'd:</L>
<L>My rural numbers, in their homely guise,</L>
<L>Gallus, because they came from me, will prize:</L>
<L>Gallus, whose growing love my breast does rend,</L>
<L>As shooting trees the bursting bark distend.</L>
<L>Now rise, for night and dew the fields invade;</L>
<L>And juniper is an unwholsome shade:</L>
<L>Blasts kill the corn by night, and flowers with mildew fade.</L>
<L>Bright Hesper twinkles from afar; away</L>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">TRANSLATED, OR RATHER IMITATED, AT THE DESIRE OF LADY GIFFARD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir William's favourite sister, a lady of uncommon merit and goodness, and companion to him in all his foreign embassies. She was addressed by Sir W. Giffard; who dying during the courtship, he begged the young lady to bear his name; and, to enable him to leave her his estate as a proof of his affection, she was married to him on his death-bed; by which means she became entitled to his large estate; and, that she might not shew herself unworthy of his esteem, she made a vow (though in her tender youth) never to marry any other man, but to live his widow: and this she faithfully performed. She died in 1722, at the age of 84. An old-fashioned monument with an epitaph, which seems to have been designed by Sir W. Temple in his life-time, is erected in Westminster Abbey,

<BYLINE>BY SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE, BART.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Sir William Temple was descended from a younger branch of a family of that name, seated at Temple Hall in Leicestershire. His grandfather was secretary to the unfor∣tunate earl of Essex, favourite of queen Elizabeth, and his father was Sir John Temple, master of the rolls in Ireland. He was as much above the common level of politicians, as he was above the herd of authors. He displayed his great abi∣lities in several important treaties and negotiations, the most considerable of which was the bringing to a happy conclusion the famous triple league betwixt England, Sweden, and Hol∣land. This alliance, though the most prudent step ever taken by Charles II. was soon defeated by the Cabal, a set of men who were as great a disgrace to their country, as Sir William Temple was an honour to it. He was strongly soli∣cited to go over to Holland, in order to break that league which he had a little before concluded: but he was too much a patriot to yield to any solicitations of that kind; and chose to retire into the country, where he was much better employed in writing his excellent
"Observations on the Uni∣ted Provinces,"
and other elegant works. Few authors have been more read, or more justly admired, than Sir Wil∣liam Temple. He displays his great knowledge of book<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and men in an elegant, easy, and negligent style, much like the language of genteel conversation. His vanity ofter prompts him to speak of himself; but he and Montaigne a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> never more pleasing than when they dwell on that difficul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> subject. It is a happy circumstance for his readers, that s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> polite and learned a writer was also a vain one: they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great gainers by his foible. He is sometimes inaccurate but his inaccuracies escape us unseen, or are very little at∣tended to. We can easily forgive a little incorrectness o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> drawing in the paintings of a Correggio, when there is so m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch beauty and grace t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> atone for it. He died in January 1691, in his seventieth year."</Q> Thus far from Granger.—Sir William's Posthumous Works were published by Dr. Swift; who is supposed to have written the Life. A good edition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them was printed in 1770, in four volumes 8vo.

I have by accident a thin volume, in 8vo. without title or date, with MS. corrections, formerly belonging to Lady Giffard, which there is great reason to believe was printed only for private use and never published, whence the reader will be gratified with some poems which may not improperly be called original.

<L>ONE labour more, O Arethusa, yield,</L>
<L>Before I leave the shepherds and the field:</L>
<L>Some verses to my Gallus ere we part,</L>
<L>Such as may one day break Lycoris' heart,</L>
<L>As she did his; who can refuse a song,</L>
<L>To one that lov'd so well, and dy'd so young!</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="37"/>So may'st thou thy belov'd Alpheus please,</L>
<L>When thou creep'st under the Sicanian seas.</L>
<L>Begin, and sing Gallus' unhappy fires,</L>
<L>Whilst yonder goat to yonder branch aspires</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="38"/>Out of his reach. We sing not to the deaf;</L>
<L>An answer comes from every trembling leaf.</L>
<L>What woods, what forests, had intic'd your stay?</L>
<L>Ye Naiades, why came ye not away!</L>
<L>When Gallus dy'd by an unworthy flame,</L>
<L>Parnassus knew, and lov'd too well his name</L>
<L>To stop your course; nor could your hasty flight</L>
<L>Be stay'd by Pindus, which was his delight.</L>
<L>Him the fresh laurels, him the lowly heath,</L>
<L>Bewail'd with dewy tears; his parting breath</L>
<L>Made lofty Maenalus hang his piny head;</L>
<L>Lycaean marbles wept when he was dead.</L>
<L>Under a lonely tree he lay and pin'd,</L>
<L>His flock about him feeding on the wind,</L>
<L>As he on love; such kind and gentle sheep,</L>
<L>Ev'n fair Adonis would be proud to keep.</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="39"/>There came the shepherds, there the weary hinds,</L>
<L>Thither Menalcas parch'd with frosts and winds.</L>
<L>All ask him whence, for whom this fatal love?</L>
<L>Apollo came, his arts and herbs to prove:</L>
<L>Why, Gallus! why so fond? he says; thy flame,</L>
<L>Thy care. Lycoris, is another's game;</L>
<L>For him she sighs and raves, him she pursues</L>
<L>Thorough the mid-day heats and morning dews;</L>
<L>Over the snowy cliffs and frozen streams,</L>
<L>Through noisy camps. Up, Gallus, leave thy dreams.</L>
<L>She has left thee. Still lay the drooping swain</L>
<L>Hanging his mournful head; Phoebus in vain</L>
<L>Offers his herbs, employs his counsel here;</L>
<L>'Tis all refus'd, or answer'd with a tear.</L>
<L>What shakes the branches! what makes all the trees</L>
<L>Begin to bow their heads, the goats their knees!</L>
<L>Oh! 'tis Sylvanus, with his mossy beard</L>
<L>And leafy crown, attended by a herd</L>
<L>Of wood-born fatyrs; see! he shakes his spear,</L>
<L>A green young oak, the tallest of the year.</L>
<L>Pan, the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cadian God, forsook the plains,</L>
<L>Mov'd with the story of his Gallus' pains.</L>
<L>We saw him come with oaten-pipe in hand,</L>
<L>Painted with berries juice; we saw him stand</L>
<L>And gaze upon his shepherd's bathing eyes;</L>
<L>And what! no end, no end of grief, he cries!</L>
<L>Love little minds all thy consuming care,</L>
<L>Or restless thoughts; they are his daily fare.</L>
<L>Nor cruel Love with tears, nor grass with showers,</L>
<L>Nor goats with tender sprouts, nor bees with flowers</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="40"/>Are ever satisfy'd. Thus spoke the God,</L>
<L>And touch'd the shepherd with his hazle rod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>He, sorrow-slain, seem'd to revive, and said,</L>
<L>But yet, Arcadians, is my grief allay'd,</L>
<L>To think that in these woods, and hills, and plains,</L>
<L>When I am silent in the grave, your swains</L>
<L>Shall sing my loves, Arcadian swains inspir'd</L>
<L>By Phoebus! Oh! how gently shall these tir'd</L>
<L>And fainting limbs repose in endless sleep,</L>
<L>While your sweet notes my love immortal keep!</L>
<L>Would it had pleas'd the Gods I had been born</L>
<L>Just one of you, and taught to wind a horn,</L>
<L>Or wield a hook, or prune a branching vine,</L>
<L>And known no other love but, Phyllis, thine;</L>
<L>Or thine, Amyntas; what though both are brown,</L>
<L>So are the nuts and berries on the down;</L>
<L>Amongst the vines, the willows, and the springs,</L>
<L>Phyllis makes garlands, and Amyntas sings.</L>
<L>No cruel absence calls my love away,</L>
<L>Farther than bleating sheep can go astray:</L>
<L>Here, my Lycoris, here are shady groves,</L>
<L>Here fountains cool, and meadows soft; our loves</L>
<L>And lives may here together wear, and end:</L>
<L>O the true joys of such a fate and friend!</L>
<L>I now am hurried by severe commands</L>
<L>Into remotest parts, among the bands</L>
<L>Of armed troops; there by my foes pursued,</L>
<L>Here by my friends; but still by Love subdued.</L>
<L>Thou, far from home and me, art wandering o'er</L>
<L>The Alpine snows, the farthest western shore,</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="41"/>The frozen Rhine. When are we like to meet?</L>
<L>Ah, gently, gently, lest thy tender feet</L>
<L>Be cut with ice. Cover thy lovely arms;</L>
<L>The northern cold relents not at their charms:</L>
<L>Away, I 'll go into some shady bowers,</L>
<L>And sing the songs I made in happier hours,</L>
<L>And charm my woes. How can I better chuse,</L>
<L>Than among wildest woods myself to lose,</L>
<L>And carve our loves upon the tender trees;</L>
<L>There they will thrive. See how my love agrees</L>
<L>With the young plants: look how they grow together,</L>
<L>In spight of absence, and in spight of weather.</L>
<L>Meanwhile I 'll climb that rock, and ramble o'er</L>
<L>Yon woody hill; I'll chace the grizly boar,</L>
<L>I 'll find Diana's and her nymphs resort;</L>
<L>No frosts, no storms, shall slack my eager sport.</L>
<L>Methinks I 'm wandering all about the rocks</L>
<L>And hollow-sounding woods: look how my locks</L>
<L>Are torn with boughs and thorns; my shafts are gone,</L>
<L>My legs are tir'd; and all my sport is done.</L>
<L>Alas! this is no cure for my disease;</L>
<L>Nor can our toils that cruel God appease.</L>
<L>Now neither nymphs, nor songs can please me more,</L>
<L>Nor hollow woods, nor yet the chaf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d boar:</L>
<L>No sport, no labour, can divert my grief:</L>
<L>Without Lycoris there is no relief.</L>
<L>Though I should drink up Heber's icy streams,</L>
<L>Or Scythian snows, yet still her fiery beams</L>
<L>Would scorch me up. Whatever we can prove,</L>
<L>Love conquers all, and we must yield to Love.</L>

<HEAD>ON MRS. PHILIPPS'S DEATH<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Catharine Philipps, better known by the poetical name of Orinda, was the daughter of John Fowler, merchant▪ and born in London, 1631, as Wood and Ballard (in 1633 ac∣cording to Jacob); was married to James Philipps, of the Priory of Cardigan, esq. about the year 1647; and died in Fleet-street, in the month of June, 1664. Her poems, in∣cluding two tragedies, "Horace" and "Pompey," both trans∣lated from Corneille, were collected in a folio volume, and afterwards reprinted in octavo. She was also the writer of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> volume of Letters (published many years after her death) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sir Charles Cotterel, intituled,
"Letters from Orinda to P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦liarchus;" which have been much admired.
<Q><L>" Orinda's works, with courtly graces stor'd,</L>
<L>" True sense in nice expressions will afford."</L>
<BIBL>Dr. King, vol. III. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/></BIBL></Q>
Mrs. Philipps was as much famed for her friendship, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her poetry; and had the good fortune to be equally esteem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the best poet and the best divine of her age. Dr. Jeremy Taylor addressed his discourse
"on the nature and effects of friendship" to this lady; and Mr. Cowley has celebrated her memory, in an Ode particularly distinguished by the very learned and sagacious editor of his "Select Works."—The industrious Mr. Langbaine says,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"she was one that equalled the Lesbian Sappho, and Roman Sulpicia: as they were praised by Horace, Martial, Ausonius, and other antient poets; so was this lady commended by the earls of Orrery and Roscommon, by Cowley, Flatman, and other eminent poets."</Q>
Sir John Denham added a fifth act to her tragedy of "Horace," which was performed at court by per∣sons of quality, in 1678. In the prologue, spoken by the duke of Monmouth, it was observed, that
<Q><L>" While a woman Horace did translate,</L>
<L>" Horace did rise above a Roman state."</L></Q>
The commendation she received from Lord Roscommon is thus handsomely returned by Mrs. Philipps:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lord Roscommon is certainly one of the most promising young noblemen in Ire∣land. He has paraphrased a Psalm admirably; and a scene of Pastor Fido very finely, in some places much better than Sir Richard Fanshaw. This was undertaken merely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> compliment to me, who happened to say that it was the be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> scene in Italian, and the worst in English. He was only two hours about it.</Q>
It begins thus:
<Q><L>" Dear happy groves, and you the dark retreat</L>
<L>" Of silent horrour, Rest's eternal seat."</L></Q>
From these lines, which are since somewhat mended, it ap∣pears that he did not think a work of two hours fit to en∣dure the eye of criticism without revisal. When Mrs. Phi∣lipps was in Ireland, some ladies, that had seen her translation of Pompey, resolved to bring it on the stage at Dublin; and, to promote their design, Lord Roscommon gave them a prologue, and Sir Edward Dering an epilogue; "which," says she,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"are the best performances of those kinds I eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saw."</Q>
If this is not criticism, it is at least gratitude▪ The thought of bringing Caesar and Pompey into Ireland▪ the only country over which Caesar never had any power▪ is lucky.—I need not point out the part of these remarks for which I am indebted to Lord Roscommon's incomparab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Biographer.

<HEAD>ARISTAEUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristaeus was son of Cyrene, daughter to one of the an∣cient kings of Arcadia; and by Apollo as was believed or at least reported. His birth was concealed, and he was sent to be privately brought up among the shepherds of Arcadia; where, grown a man, he applied himself wholly to the cares and stores of a country life, in all which he succeeded, so as to grow renowned for his knowledge and wealth. He was esteemed the first inventor of cheese, oil, and honey, or rather of the art of hiving bees, which before were wild, and their stocks found only by chance and in hollow trees. For this he was worshiped among the Arcadians as son of Apollo, and as other inventors of things necessary or most useful to hu∣man life. He fell in love with Eurydice newly espoused to Or∣pheus; and by his pursuit of her was the occasion of her death, being bitten by a snake as she fled from him. This was followed by the death of Orpheus after a long and incu∣rable grief, whereupon Aristaeus was by the nymphs, com∣panions of Eurydice, plagued in all his stores, but most of all in his bees, of which he was fondest, till he lost them all, and was in despair ever to recover them: but, by the advice of his mother and of Proteus, to whom she sent him, he came to find out both the true cause of his loss, and means of retrieving it.

<L>The angry Nymphs that haunt the shady groves,</L>
<L>Where Orpheus and his bride began their loves;</L>
<L>And many a dance had taught her in their rings</L>
<L>Whilst he so sweetly to their measures sings;</L>

<L>Four lovely heifers yet unhandled take,</L>
<L>Then just as many unhewn altars make</L>
<L>Within the grove, where ancient use allows</L>
<L>Arcadian swains to pay their holy vows</L>
<L>Unto the Nymphs. There, as the day shall rise,</L>
<L>Of all these offerings make one sacrifice;</L>
<L>Upon the altars pour the reeking blood,</L>
<L>And leave the bodies in the shady wood,</L>
<L>First strowed over with fresh oaken boughs;</L>
<L>But, when the ninth Aurora thee shall rouse</L>
<L>From thy soft sleep, Lethaean poppies bring,</L>
<L>And unto Orpheus solemn dirgies sing;</L>
<L>With a black sheep his angry ghost appease,</L>
<L>And a white calf Eurydice to please;</L>
<L>Then to the grove return with humble gait</L>
<L>And heart devout, and there expect thy fate.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="75" REF="78"/>
<L>The swain instructed makes no long delay;</L>
<L>Unto the shrine he straight begins his way,</L>
<L>Raises the altars, all the bullocks slays,</L>
<L>Offers his humblest prayers and his praise</L>
<L>Unto the angry nymphs, then home retires</L>
<L>And lays sweet incense on his houshold fires</L>
<L>Full eight long days; but when the dawning light</L>
<L>Upon the ninth restor'd the morning bright,</L>
<L>He to the grove returns, and there he sees</L>
<L>(Stupendous sight!) a thousand thousand bees</L>
<L>Out of the melted bowels of each steer,</L>
<L>As from a mighty swarming hive appear,</L>
<L>Bursting from out the sides with vital heat,</L>
<L>From whence in clouds they rise, then take their seat</L>
<L>Upon the leaning boughs, till all the trees</L>
<L>Are hung with bunches of the clustering bees.</L>

<L>Thus have I sung poor nymphs' and shepherds' dreams;</L>

<HEAD>SONG, FROM TYRANNIC LOVE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE SAME; NOT AMONG HIS POEMS.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>AH, how sweet it is to love!</L>
<L>Ah, how gay is young desire!</L>
<L>And what pleasing pains we prove</L>
<L>When we first approach love's fire!</L>
<L>Pains of love be sweeter far</L>
<L>Than all other pleasures are.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sighs which are from lovers blown</L>
<L>Do but gently heave the heart:</L>
<L>E'en the tears they shed alone</L>
<L>Cure, like trickling balm, their smart.</L>
<L>Lovers, when they lose their breath,</L>
<L>Bleed away in easy death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Love and Time with reverence use,</L>
<L>Treat them like a parting friend:</L>
<L>Nor the golden gifts refuse</L>
<L>Which in youth sincere they send:</L>
<L>For each year their price is more,</L>
<L>And they less simple than before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Love, like spring-tides full and high,</L>
<L>Swells in every youthful vein:</L>
<L>But each tide does less supply,</L>
<L>Till they quite shrink-in again:</L>
<L>If a flow in age appear,</L>
<L>'Tis but rain, and runs not clear.</L>

<HEAD>ON THE DEATH OF PRINCE HENRY AND PRINCESS MARY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From
"Threni Cantabrigienses in Funere duorum Prin∣cipum, Henrici Glocestrensis, &amp; Mariae Arausionensis, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣renissimi Regis Caroli II. Fratris &amp; Sororis. Cantab. 1661."
For copies of this and the following poem I am indebted to a volume in the Lambeth Library, 39. 6. 13. fol. most ob∣ligingly communicated by Dr. Ducarel.—The Reader will not be displeased at being presented with two Latin poems (though perhaps of no superior excellence) by so capital a writer. By the second of them it appears that in 1662 he had the degree of B.A. and had obtained a fellowship; though neither of those academical honours attended has name in 1661. One of his earliest productions (written in 1650, the year he went to College) is already printed in vol. I. p. 181. with a prologue and two epilogues to "The Duke of Guise," none of which are in any edition of his works. If these poems had come to light before the publication of Dr. Johnson's excellent Life of Dryden, that judicious Biographer would certainly have made some alteration in the following paragraph:—<Q REND="inline">"At the university he does not appear to have been eager of <HI>poetical</HI> distinction, or to have lavished his <HI>early wit</HI> either on fictitious subjects or publick occasions. He pro∣bably considered that he who purposed to be an author, ought first to be a student. He obtained, whatever was the reason, <HI>no fellowship</HI> in the College. Why he was excluded, cannot now be known, and it is vain to guess; had he thought him∣self injured, he knew how to complain. In the Life of Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tarch he mentions his education in the College with gra∣titude; but in a prologue at Oxford, he has these lines:
<Q><L>Oxford to him a dearer name shall be</L>
<L>Than his own mother-university;</L>
<L>Thebes did his rude unknowing youth engage:</L>
<L>He chooses Athens in his riper age.</L></Q>
It was not till the death of Cromwell, in 1658, that he became a <HI>publick</HI> candidate for fame, by publishing <HI>Heroick Stanza<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the late Lord Protector</HI>; which, compared with the verses of Sprat and Waller on the same occasion, were suf∣ficient to raise great expectations of the rising poet."</Q> I had not seen these poems when the note in vol.

<HEAD>THE DEATH OF CAMILLA.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>BY THE SAME.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>ON death and wounds Camilla looks with joy,</L>
<L>Freed from a breast, the siercer to destroy.</L>
<L>Now, thick as hail, her fatal darts she ssings;</L>
<L>The two-edg'd ax now on their helmets rings.</L>
<L>Her shoulders bore Diana's arms and bow:</L>
<L>And if, too strongly prest, she sled before a foe,</L>
<L>Her shafts, revers'd, did death and horror bear,</L>
<L>And found the rash, who durst pursue the fair.</L>
<L>Near her fierce Tulla and Tarpeia ride,</L>
<L>And bold Larina conquering by her side.</L>
<L>These above all Camilla's breast did share,</L>
<L>For faith in peace, and gallantry in war.</L>
<L>Such were the Thracian, Amazonian bands,</L>
<L>When first they dy'd with blood Thermodoon's sands.</L>
<L>Such troops Hippolyta herself did head,</L>
<L>And such the bold Penthesilca led,</L>
<L>When female shouts alarm'd the trembling fields,</L>
<L>And glaring beams shot bright from maiden shields.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who, gallant virgin, who by thee were slain?</L>
<L>What gasping numbers strew'd upon the plain?</L>
<L>Thy spear first through Eumenius passage found;</L>
<L>Whole torents gush'd out of his mouth and wound;</L>
<L>With gnashing teeth, in pangs, the earth he tore,</L>

<L>Then hapless Pegasus and Lyris bleed:</L>

<L>Her arm Amastrus next, and Tereas feel;</L>
<L>Then follows Chromis with her lifted steel:</L>

<L>Strong Orphitus (in arms unknown before)</L>
<L>In battle an Apulian courser bore;</L>
<L>His brawny back wrapt in a bullock's skin,</L>
<L>Upon his head a wolf did fiercely grin,</L>
<L>Above the rest his mighty shoulders show,</L>
<L>And he looks down upon the troops below:</L>
<L>Aim (and 'twas easy, while his fellows fled)</L>
<L>She struck along, and thus she triumph'd while he bled:</L>
<L>Some coward game thou didst believe to chace;</L>

<L>Yet to requiring ghosts this glory bear,</L>
<L>Thy soul was yielded to Camilla's spear.</L>

<L>And brings herself up to the chacer's heels.</L>
<L>Her ax, regardless of his prayers and groans,</L>

<L>Of all to whom Liguria fraud imparts,</L>
<L>While Fate allow'd that fraud, he was of subtlest arts;</L>

<L>So brav'd, fierce indignation fires her breast;</L>
<L>Dismounted from her horse, in open field,</L>

<L>He, thinking that his cunning did succeed,</L>
<L>Reins round his horse, and urges all his speed,</L>

<L>Poor wretch, that swell'st with a deluding pride,</L>
<L>In vain thy country's little arts are try'd.</L>
<L>No more the coward shall behold his fire;</L>

<L>Who breaks his lance, and views his armour round,</L>

<L>When here and there a piercing beam</L>
<L>Scatters faint spangled sun-shine on the ground,</L>
<L>And casts about a melancholy gleam;</L>
<L>But so obscure, I could not see</L>
<L>The charming eyes that wounded thee;</L>

<HEAD>A PROLOGUE TO SATYR.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>TO that prodigious height of vice we're grown,</L>
<L>Both in the court, the theatre, and town,</L>
<L>That 'tis of late believ'd, nay fix'd a rule,</L>
<L>Whoever is not vicious, is a fool:</L>
<L>Hiss'd at by old and young, despis'd, opprest,</L>
<L>If he be not a villain like the rest.</L>
<L>Virtue and Truth are lost: search for good men,</L>
<L>Among ten thousand you will scarce find ten.</L>
<L>Half wits, conceited coxcombs, cowards, braves.</L>
<L>Base flatterers, and the endless fry of knaves,</L>
<L>Pops, fools, and pimps, we every where may find;</L>
<L>And not to meet them is to shun mankind.</L>
<L>The other sex too, whom we all adore,</L>
<L>When search'd, we still find rotten at the core,</L>
<L>An old dry bawd, or a young juicy whore:</L>
<L>Their love all false, their virtue but a name,</L>
<L>And nothing in them constant but their shame.</L>
<L>What satyrist then that's honest can sit still,</L>
<L>And unconcern'd see such tide of ill</L>
<L>With an impetuous force o'erflow the age,</L>
<L>And not strive to restrain it with his rage;</L>
<L>On Sin's vast army seize, wing, rear, and van,</L>
<L>And, like impartial Death, not spare a man?</L>
<L>For where, alas! where is that mighty he,</L>
<L>That is from pride, deceit, and envy free,</L>
<L>Or rather is not tainted with all three?</L>
<L><PB N="110" REF="113"/>Mankind is criminal, their acts, their thoughts;</L>
<L>'Tis charity to tell them of their faults,</L>
<L>And shew their failings in a faithful glass:</L>
<L>For who won't mend who sees himself an ass?</L>
<L>And this design 'tis that employs my Muse,</L>
<L>That for her daily theme she 's proud to chuse,</L>
<L>A theme that she 'll have daily need to use.</L>
<L>Let other poets flatter, fawn, and write,</L>
<L>To get some guineas and a dinner by 't:</L>
<L>Such mercenary wretches, should they starve,</L>
<L>They meet a kinder fate than they deserve.</L>
<L>But she could ne'er cringe to a lord for meat,</L>
<L>Or praise a prosperous villain, though he's great:</L>
<L>Quite contrary her practice shall appear,</L>
<L>Unbrib'd, impartial, pointed, and severe:</L>
<L>That way my nature leads, compos'd of gall,</L>
<L>I must write sharply, or not write at all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Though Thyrsis wings the air in towering slights,</L>
<L>And to a wonder panegyrick writes,</L>
<L>Though he is still exalted and sublime,</L>
<L>Scarce to be match'd by past or present time;</L>
<L>Though smooth and lofty all his lines appear,</L>
<L>The thoughts all noble, the expression clear,</L>
<L>With judgement, wit, and sancy, shining every where;</L>
<L>Yet what instruction can from hence accrue?</L>
<L>'Tis flattery all; too fulsome to be true.</L>
<L>Urge not, for 'tis to vindicate the wrong,</L>
<L>It causes emulation in the young,</L>
<L>A thirst to fame, while some high act they read,</L>
<L>That prompts them to the same romantic deed.</L>
<L><PB N="111" REF="114"/>As if some powerful magick lay in rhimes,</L>
<L>That made them braver than at other times.</L>
<L>'Tis false and fond; heroes may huff and fight;</L>
<L>But who can merit so as he can write?</L>
<L>To say a glow-worm is the morning-star,</L>
<L>And that it may with ease be seen as far,</L>
<L>Were most ridiculous; so far from truth,</L>
<L>It justly would deserve a sharp reproof.</L>
<L>That slave is more to blame, whose hireling pen</L>
<L>Calls knaves and coxcombs wise deserving men;</L>
<L>Says the rank bawds are all with sweetness grac'd,</L>
<L>Courtiers all just, and all court-strumpets chaste.</L>
<L>If to be prais'd does give a man pretence</L>
<L>To glory, learning, honesty, and sense,</L>
<L>Cromwell had much to say in his defence:</L>
<L>Who, though a tyrant, which all ills comprize,</L>
<L>Has been extoll'd and lifted to the skies.</L>
<L>Whilst living, such was the applause he gave,</L>
<L>Counted high, princely, pious, just, and brave;</L>
<L>And with encomiums waited to his grave.</L>
<L>Who then would give this for a poet's praise,</L>
<L>Which rightly understood does but debase,</L>
<L>And blast the reputation it would raise?</L>
<L>Hence 'tis, and 'tis a punishment that 's fit,</L>
<L>They are contemn'd and scorn'd by men of wit.</L>
<L>'Tis true some Scots may nibble at their praise,</L>
<L>And think it great to stand i' th' front of plays;</L>
<L>Though most to that stupidity are grown,</L>
<L>They waive their patron's praise to write their own:</L>
<L><PB N="112" REF="115"/>And yet they never fail of their rewards;</L>
<L>And faith in that I cannot blame the bards.</L>
<L>If coxcombs will be coxcombs, let them rue;</L>
<L>If they love flattery, let them pay for 't too.</L>
<L>'Tis one sure method to convince the elves,</L>
<L>They spare my pains, and satirize themselves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In short, nought helps like Satyr to amend.</L>
<L>While in huge volumes motley priests contend,</L>
<L>And let their vain disputes ne'er have an end:</L>
<L>They plunge us in those snares we else should shun;</L>
<L>Like tinkers, make ten holes in mending one.</L>
<L>Our dearest friends too, though they know our faults,</L>
<L>For pity, or for shame, conceal their thoughts;</L>
<L>While we, who see our failings, not forbid,</L>
<L>Loosely run on in the vain paths we did.</L>
<L>'Tis Satyr then that is our truest friend;</L>
<L>For none, before they know their faults, can mend:</L>
<L>That tells us boldly of our foulest crimes,</L>
<L>Reproves ill-manners, and reforms the times,</L>
<L>How am I then to blame, when all I write</L>
<L>Is honest rage, not prejudice or spite?</L>
<L>Truth is my aim, with truth I shall impeach;</L>
<L>And I'll spare none that comes within its reach.</L>
<L>On then, my Muse—the world before thee lies—</L>
<L>And lash the knaves and fools that I despise.</L>

<HEAD>TO THE EARL OF MIDDLETON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charles Middleton, the second earl of that title, and baron Clairmont, was secretary of state for Scotland from the year 1684 to the Revolution; when he followed king James into France, and was attainted by the Scots parliament in 1695. He married lady Catharine daughter of Robert earl of Cardigan, by whom he had two sons, John lord Clair∣mont, and Charles Middleton, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> who were both taken at sea by admiral Byng, in the descent which the French in∣tended upon Scotland in 1708; but, by the queen's orders, they were soon released, and died in France without issue.

<HEAD>THE CUP, FROM ANACREON,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. JOHN OLDHAM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">John Oldham (son of a Nonconsorming minister, who, at the time of the Usurpation, was rector of Shipton in Glou∣cest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rshire) born Aug. 9, 1653, was a bachelor of Ed∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Hall, Oxford; A.B. in 1674, and soon after usher to the free school at Croydon. In this situation, some of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s poetry having been handed about, he was honoured with a visit by the earls of Rochester and Dorset, Sir Charles Sedley, and other persons of distinction. In 1678 he was tutor to the son of Judge Thurland, and in 1681 to a son of Sir Wil∣liam Hickes. By the advice of Sir William and the assis∣tance of Dr. Lower, he applied, for about a year, to the study of physic; but, poetry being predominant, he hastened to London, and became a perfect votary to the bottle, yet without sinking into the debauchery of his contemporary wits. As he was of a very different turn from his father, the character of the old parson, at the end of his works, is supposed to have been designed for him. It is perhaps the most extravagant caricature that ever was drawn. He was patronized by the earl of Kingston, who would have made him his chaplain if he would have qualified himself. He lived with the earl, however, till his death, which was oc∣casioned by the small-pox, Dec. 9, 1683. He was parti∣cularly esteemed by Mr. Dryden; who has done him great justice in "Verses to his Memory," (English Poets, vol. XIV. p. 161.) His works have been frequently printed in one volum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 8vo; in 1722 in two volumes 12mo. with the Author's Life; and very lately, under the inspection of Captain Thompson, in three volumes, 12mo.

<HEAD>REMEDY OF LOVE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JOHN EVELYN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son of the great natural philosopher, and born at Sayes-Court near Deptford, upon the 14th of January 1654, and was there educated with great care. He was sent to Oxford in the year 1666, where he remained in the house of Dr. Bathurst, then president of Trinity-college, before he was admitted a gentleman-commoner, which was in Easter-term 1688. It is not clear at what time he left Oxford; but Mr. Wood seems to be positive that he took no degree there, but returned to his father's house, and prosecuted his studies under his directions. It is supposed, however, that, during his residence in Trinity-college, he wrote that elegant Greek poem, which is prefixed to the second edition of the Sylva; and is a noble proof of the strength of his genius and won∣derful progress in learning in the early part of his life. He discovered his proficiency soon afterwards, both in the ancient and modern languages, by his elegant translations; as well as his intimate acquaintance with the Muses, in some original poems, which were much admired. His works will be mentioned presently. He married Martha, daugh∣ter and co-heiress of Richard Spencer, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> and, having a head as well turned for business as study, became one of the commissioners of the revenue in Ireland. He would pro∣bably have been advanced to higher employments, if he had lived; but he died at his house in London, upon the 24th of March 1698, in the 45th year of his age. He was father of the late sir John Evelyn, who was born at Sayes-Court upon the 2d of March 1681, and created a baronet by letters patent, bearing date July 30th, 1713. This gentleman's productions in the literary way were, 1.
"Of Gardens, four books, first written in Latin verse by Renatus Ra∣pinus, and now made English by John Evelyn, <ABBR>esq</ABBR>"
1673, 8vo. Considering how much he must have been obliged to hear of gardens and plantations, we need not wonder that he should employ himself upon this subject. His father an∣nexed the second book of this translation to his Sylva. 2.
"The life of Alexander the Great, translated from the Greek of Plutarch."
This was printed in the fourth volume of Plutarch's Lives by several hands. 3.
"The history of the grand visiers, Mahomet and Achmet Co∣progli; of the three last grand seigniors, their sultanas, and chief favourites; with the most secret intrigues of the seraglio."
1677, 8vo. This was a translation from the French, and has been esteemed an entertaining and in∣structive history. He was also author of several occasional poems, the best of which are here preserved. N.</NOTE>, ESQ.</BYLINE>

<BYLINE>BY MR. JOSEPH HALL<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The reader is here presented with a beautiful poem, at present entirely unknown, by the ingenious and learned di∣vine who early in life distinguished himself by his
"Virgi∣demiarum, Satires in six books, 1597" (reprinted at Oxford 1753, 8vo).
He was born and educated at Ashby-de-la-Zouch; and at 15 was sent to Emanuel College, Cambridge, where he regularly obtained his degrees and a fellowship, and read the rhetoric lecture in the public schools for two years with great applause. In the prologue to the
"Virgi∣demiarum," he calls himself the first satyrist in the Eng∣lish language;
<Q><L>" I first adventure; follow me who list,</L>
<L>" And be the second English satyrist."</L></Q>
About 1596 he was presented to the rectory of Halsted in Suffolk, and soon after married a wise with whom he lived happily 49 years. In 1605, he accompanied sir Edward Bacon to the Spa, where he composed his second
"Century of Meditations."
In 1612, he took the degree of D.D. obtained the donative of Waltham Holy Cross in Essex, and a little before had been made chaplain to prince Henry; was made a prebendary of the collegiate church of Wolve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hamp∣ton; dean of Worcester, whilst absent in France on an em∣bassy with lord Hay, in 1616; attended the king into Scot∣land as chaplain in 1617; and was sent to the synod of Dort in 1618, where he preached an admired Latin sermon. He re∣fused the bishoprick of Gloucester in 1624; accepted that of E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eter in 1627; and in November 1641 was translated to Norwich. He was committed to the Tower on the 30th of Ja∣nuary, whence in June 1642 he was released on giving 5000l. bail. Withdrawing to Norwich, he lived there in tolerable quiet till April 1643. But then, the order for sequestering no∣torious delinquents being passed, in which he was included by name, all his rents were stopped, and he had nothing to live on but what the parliament allowed him; all the while suffering the greatest inconveniences, which he has given an account of in a piece, intitled his "Hard Measure." In the year 1647, he retired to a little estate, which he rented at Higham near Norwich; and in this retirement he ended his life on the 8th of September 1656, in the 82d year of his age. He was buried in the church-yard of that parish with∣out any memorial: for in his will he has this passage,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I do not hold God's house a meet repository for the dead bodies of the greatest faints."</Q>
He is universally allowed to have been a man of great wit and learning, and of as great meekness, modesty, and piety. He was so great a lover of study, that he earnestly wished his health would have al∣lowed him to do it even to excess. His works, besides the Satires above-mentioned, make in all five volumes in folio and quarto; and
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"are filled, says Mr. Bayle, with fine thoughts, excellent morality, and a great deal of piety."</Q>
His writings shew, that he was very zealous against popery; neither was he more favourable to those who separated from the mother-church without an extreme necessity. He la∣mented the divisions of protestants, and wrote something with a view of putting an end to them. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>TRANSLATED BY MR. SAM. BOYSE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son of Joseph Boyse, a Dissenting minister of great eminence in Dublin (who was one of the 16 children of Mr. Matthew Boyse of Leeds) well known by his controversial writings against Abp. King.—Samuel was born in 1708, and received his education at Dublin; at 18, he was sent to the university of Glasgow; and, marrying before he was 20, returned to Dublin with his wife, where the conduct of neither was commendable. The husband, who had no graces of person and fewer still of conversation, passed his time in abject trifling; the wife, in intrigue: and their extrava∣gance reduced his father to indigence. In 1731 young Boyse resided at Edinburgh, where he published a volume of poems, addressed to the countess of Egleton, the patroness of all men of wit. Here also Mr. Boyse particularly distinguished him∣self by an elegy, called "The Tears of the Muses," on the death of the viscountess Stormont; which introduced him to the noble viscount; and also to the dutchess of Gordon, who had engaged for him an office in the customs, which he lost by an unpardonable remissness. The dutchess sent him to London with recommendations to Mr. Pope and the lord chancellor King. He went to Twickenham; but, the po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not being at home, he never repeated the visit; by the peer he was most graciously received. From this period he wrote many poems; but those, though excellent in their kind (and suf∣ficient, it is said, to have filled at least six volumes) were lost to the world, by being introduced with no advantage. He had so strong a propensity to groveling, that his acquaintance were generally of such a cast as could be of no service to him; and those in higher life he addressed by letters, not having sufficient confidence or politeness to converse familiarly with them; a freedom to which he was intitled by the power of his genius. His genius was not confined to poetry only; but he had a taste for painting, music, and heraldry, with the latter of which he was well acquainted. Many of his poems are in the Gent. Mag. signed Y. and Alceus. In 1743 he published his "Albion's Triumph," an ode on the battle of Dettingen; and in or about 1745 wrote an admirable poem called "The Deity," which Mr. Pope declared, on its publication, contained many lines of which he should not be ashamed. It was also commended by the late Henry Field∣ing, who gave a quotation from it, (see Tom Jones, B. vii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1.) and at the same time very justly styled it <HI>a noble on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> This unfortunate man, by addicting himself to low vices, among which were gluttony and extravagance, rendered him∣self so contemptible and wretched, that he frequently was without the least subsistence for days together. After squan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ring away in a dirty manner any money which he acquired, he has been known to pawn all his apparel; and in that state was frequently confined to his bed, sitting up with his arms through holes in a blanket, writing verses in order to procure the means of existence. It seems hardly credible, but it is cer∣tainly true, that he was more than once in that deplorable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ituation, and to the end of his life never derived any advan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge from the experience of his past sufferings. A late col∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ector of poems (Mr. Giles) says, he was informed by Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>by the bookseller, that this unhappy man at last was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd dead in his bed, with a pen in his hand, and in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of writing, in the same manner as above described.

<HEAD>ON THE KING'S HOUSE, BUILDING AT WINCHESTER<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On or near the scite of King Arthur's Castle, king Charles II. in 1683 laid the foundation of a magnificent royal palace, only the shell of which was finished. A cupola was designed 30 feet higher than the roof, which would have been seen at sea; and a street was intended leading from the West end of the chathedral to the centre of the front. The length of the whole is 328 feet. A park was also projected ten miles in circumference; but the death of the king pre∣vented the progress and execution of this noble plan. The palace is at present converted into a commodious prison for French prisoners of war. See Warton's Description of Win∣chester, p. 11. N.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<L>AS soon as mild Augustus could assuage</L>
<L>A bloody civil war's licentious rage,</L>
<L>He made the blessing that he gave increase,</L>
<L>By teaching Rome the softer arts of peace.</L>
<L><PB N="177" REF="180"/>The sacred temples, wanting due repair,</L>
<L>Had first their wounds heal'd with a pious care;</L>
<L>Nor ceas'd his labour till proud Rome outvy'd</L>

<L>Thus Charles, in peace returning to our isle,</L>
<L>With building did his regal cares beguile.</L>
<L>London, almost consum'd but to a name,</L>
<L>He rescues from the fierce devouring flame;</L>
<L>Its hostile rage the burning town enjoy'd,</L>
<L>For he restor'd as fast as that destroy'd:</L>
<L>'Twas quickly burnt, and quickly built again,</L>

<L>And all kings since have always been obey'd.</L>
<L>Rebellion here could ne'er erect a throne,</L>
<L>For Charles that blessing was reserv'd alone.</L>
<L>Let not the stately fabric you decree,</L>
<L>An immature, abortive palace be,</L>
<L>But may it grow the mistress of your heart,</L>
<L>And the full heir of Wren's stupendous art!</L>

<L>The graceful Temple that delights his eye</L>
<L>(Luxurious toil of former piety)</L>
<L>Has vanquish'd envious Time's devouring rage,</L>
<L>And, like Religion, stronger grows by age:</L>
<L>It stems the torrent of the flowing years,</L>
<L>Yet gay as youth the sacred pile appears.</L>
<L>Of its great rise we no records have known,</L>
<L>It has out-liv'd all memory but its own<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About the year 1079, bishop Walkelyne began the pre∣sent edifice, on the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite of an older; and finished the tower, the choir, the transept, and probably the West end.

<L>And hawks (the swift-wing'd coursers of the air)</L>
<L>The trembling bird with fatal haste pursue,</L>

<L>Caught the swift arrow as it flew,</L>

<L>Flora, the bounteous goddess of the plains,</L>
<L>Who in fresh groves and sweetest meadows reigns,</L>
<L>Hearing the fair Melantha dead,</L>

<L>Tell me, what Beauty is, whose force controls</L>
<L>Reason and power, and over mankind rules:</L>
<L>Kings stoop to Beauty, and the crowns they wear</L>
<L>Shine not with so much lustre as the Fair.</L>
<L>Beauty a larger empire does command</L>
<L>Than the great monarch of the seas and land.</L>
<L><PB N="182" REF="185"/>She can the coldest anchorites inflame,</L>
<L>Cool tyrants' rage, and stroke their passions tame.</L>
<L>She can call youth to her forsaken seat</L>

<L>She can subdue the fierce, the proud, and strong,</L>
<L>Give courage to the weak, the fearful, and the young.</L>
<L>Beauty, the only deity we know,</L>
<L>With fear and awe we to her altars go,</L>
<L>And there our purest zeal of prayers and vows bestow.</L>
<L>Sure then it only seems to die,</L>
<L>And, when it leaves us, mounts above</L>
<L>To the eternal roof of Jove,</L>
<L>To be a constellation, and inrich the sky.</L>
<L>But, should I search the spangled sphere</L>
<L>For metamorphos'd beauty there,</L>
<L>Nothing of Helen now is seen,</L>
<L>Nor the fair Egyptian queen;</L>
<L>Or thou, whose eyes were constellations here:</L>
<L>Oh then thy fate we can't enough deplore,</L>
<L>With thee thy beauty dy'd, and 'tis no more.</L>
<L>Then let us give Melantha's fate its due;</L>
<L>Strew cypress on her hearse, and wreaths of yew,</L>
<L>For fair Melantha, poor Melantha 's dead,</L>
<L>Her sighing soul to Death's eternal empire 's fled.</L>

<HEAD>THE COURT-PROSPECT.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. CHARLES HOPKINS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Son of Ezekiel bishop of Londonderry (who married the lady Araminta one of the 4 daughters of John lord Robartes of Truro afterwards earl of Radnor). He was born at Exeter; but, his father being taken chaplain to Ireland by lord Ro∣bartes when lord lieutenant in 1669, our poet received the early part of his education at Trinity College, Dublin; and afterwards was a student at Cambridge. On the rebellion in Ireland in 1688, he returned thither, and exerted his early valour in the cause of his country, religion, and liberty. When public tranquillity was restored, he came again into England, and fell into an acquaintance with gentlemen of the best wit, whose age and genius were most agreeable to his own. In 1694 he published some
"Epistolary Poems and Translations," which will all be inserted in this volume; and in 1695 he shewed his genius as a dramatic writer by "Pyrrhus king of Egypt," a tragedy, to which Mr. Con∣greve wrote the epilogue (see English Poets, vol. XXIX. p. 84).
He published that year "The History of Love," a connexion of select fables from Ovid's Metamorphoses, 1695; which, by the sweetness of his numbers and easiness of his thoughts, procured him considerable reputation. With Mr. Dryden in particular he became a great favourite. He after∣wards published the "Art of Love," which, Jacob says,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"added to his fame, and happily brought him acquainted with the earl of Dorset and other persons of distinction, who were fond of his company, through the agreeableness of his temper and the pleasantry of his conversation. It was in his power to have made his fortune in any scene of life; but he was always more ready to serve others than mindful of his own affairs; and, by the excesses of hard drinking, and a too passionate fondness for the fair sex, he died a martyr to the cause in the 36th year of his age."</Q>
I shall preserve in this collection an admirable Hymn
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"writ∣ten about an hour before his death, when in great pain."</Q>
His "Court-Prospect," in which many of the principal no∣bility are very handsomely complimented, is called by Jacob <Q REND="inline">"an excellent piece;"</Q> and of his other poems he adds,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that they are all remarkable for the purity of their diction, and the harmony of their numbers."</Q>
Mr. Hopkins was also the author of two other tragedies;
"Boadicea Queen of Britain," 1697;
and
"Friendship improved, or the Female Warrior," with a humorous prologue, comparing a poet to a merchant, a comparison which will hold in most part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>culars except that of accumulating wealth.
Our author, who was at Londonderry when this tragedy came out, in∣scribed it to Edward Coke of Norfolk, esquire, in a dedica∣tion, dated Nov. 1. 1699, so modest and pathetic that I am persuaded I shall stand excused if I print it at full length:<Q REND="inline"><P>"The greatest, and indeed almost the only, advantage a poet reaps from what he writes, is the opportunities he meets with of making himself known to the best and greatest men of his age. A play is first made public in the theatre; and when it comes to the press, if any one has spoken kindly and favourably of it in the representation, the poet chooses him for his patron, he having before (according to the author's construction) chosen him for his poet. The distance I am at from the city, and even from the kingdom too, will keep me ignorant for some time what success this play (which I humbly offer to your patronage) may meet with. If the town is pleased with it, I shall be pleased with myself for pleasing them; if they condemn it, I shall be apt to conclude so many in the right, rather than my single self. You saw it in manuscript; and I have this early and auspicious advantage, that you approve of it. Boadicea pleased them; and I received a very great additional satisfaction, when I understood how particularly it pleased you. I will not go to compare that play and this together, nor follow the custom of reckoning the last per∣formance best, and shewing the greatest fondness of the youngest brat. The rhyme was the only thing that recom∣mended that; and, for aught I know, the only thing too that can recommend this. I could wish for something distin∣guishing in it, because it is sacred to you, and I should de∣sire to be known to you at advantage. If the pains in writ∣ing will endear it to you, it cost me much more than the former. It has some sort of design besides (such as it is); but I was never very guilty of plotting. I can hardly keep the characters in my play from being as honest and sincere as I would be myself in a dedication. A vicious character disturbs me while I draw it, and it grates me to delineate a villain. 'Tis certain no poet can excite any passion in ano∣ther, if he does not feel it first in himself. Who then will choose to describe discontent, envy, or revenge, when they may have such fair fields as honour and virtue to range in? All there is bright before them, and the flight the Muse takes the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s heavenwards. Such characters, artfully and justly drawn, will excite the good and great to be patrons; and such patrons as you, Sir, will soon teach poets to draw such characters. You are endowed with all the blessings of Nature and Fortune; and you are as liberal of the gifts of the latter to others, as she has been to you. So great is your estate, it would be unwieldy to have it more; and such good use is made of it, that Envy does not wish it less. It is not consumed in vain and superfluous equipage; but laid out in maintaining the old, open English hospitality. Desert in want is sup∣plied; and Honesty in distress is succoured and sustained; great without titles, and good above greatness; rich, rather to others than yourself; and seeming only as your own stew∣ard. Your inclinations and endeavours are the general good of mankind; and none ever went from you dissatisfied; delighted in obliging others, and pleased to see them pleased with your bounty. Wishing the welfare of all men, and speaking well of all men, is a sure way to meet with an uni∣versal return of good will and good wishes. He doubly en∣joys his fortune, who has it wished double by all that know him. Among the prayers of others, accept of the praises of the poet; humbly and heartily, though feebly, offered. I now begin to experience how much the mind may be influenced by the body. My Muse is confined, at present, to a weak and sickly tenement; and the winter season will go near to over-bear her, together with her houshold. There are storms and tempests to beat her down, or frosts to bind her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and kill her; and she has no friend on her side but youth to bear her through; if that can sustain the attack, and hold out till spring comes to relieve me, one use I shall make of farther life shall be to shew how much I am, Sir, your most devoted humble servant, CHARLES HOPKINS."</P></Q> His feelings were prophetic; he died, I believe, in the course of that winter.

He was afterwards elected preacher at one of the city churches; but the bishop of London refused to admit him, as he was a popular preacher among the Fanatics. He then obtained St. Mary's church at Exeter, was countenanced by bishop Ward, and much admired for the comeliness of his person and ele∣gance of preaching. The lord Robartes in particular was so pleased with him that he gave him one of his daughters in marriage, took him chaplain to Ireland in 1669, gave him the deanry of Raphoe, and recommended him so effectually to his successor lord Berkeley, that he was consecrated bishop of Raphoe October 27, 1671, and translated to Londonderry in 1681. Driven thence by the forces under the earl of Tyrconnel in 1688, he retired into England, and was elected minister of Aldermanbury in September 1689, where he died on the 19th of June 1690. He published expositions on the Lord's Prayer and Ten Commandments, and five single Sermons. N.</NOTE>. Thus the thanks for past favours are only petitions for more; as some men

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>SOME writers perhaps may expect the thanks and favour of the nobility, after attempting their praise; but I am rather afraid of having incurred their dis∣pleasure; they whom I have mentioned, I doubt, may with more reason find fault with me, than they whom I have omitted; for it is better not to be drawn at all, than to be drawn imperfectly and lamely. The poet, however, has the same excuse with the painter; that art cannot equal nature; nor the pencil, nor the pen, pre∣sent a copy that comes up to her original. The business of a poet is to please; and he is very unhappy who gives offence where he designs acknowledgments or respects. The whole body of the nobility of England would be a boundless subject; painters own they find it more difficult to give a true and lively air and posture to a picture; to place the legs, and duly proportion all the parts, than to draw the face, and take the likeness: but this piece was only intended for an half-length, and that too is only a rough draught, and in miniature. Though the following lines may want an excuse with the cri∣ticks,
<PB N="189" REF="192"/>
I will not despair of pardon from the nobles to whom it was designed; and if I have failed in describing their greatness, I have at the same time given them an opportunity of shewing their goodness.</P>

<HEAD>TO ANTHONY HAMMOND<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To this gentleman Mr. Hopkins inscribed his
"Episto∣lary Poems and Translations," in a dedication worth pre∣serving:
<Q REND="inline">"The following verses ought in justice to be yours, since not only the best part of them were made at your house, but they were made designedly for you, so that this is not a de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ication written to a book, but a book written to a dedication; which, however, is the nicest part a writer has to manage; for the most deserving men are the most averse to be told so, and what would please all their friends and acquaintance would displease themselves; which makes the poet at a loss whether to dissatisfy one or many, his readers or his patron. But, since I have already found it easier to you to oblige, than to receive thanks for an obligation; to do no violence to your modesty, I must do one to my own justice, and desist from a theme which I could so willingly enlarge upon, but you so unwillingly read. I shall say little of the following essays, either of the originals I translated them from, or the translations: one thing in general I find from my own experi∣ence; that where there is most life and spirit in the author, the translator is carried on with the greater vigour and vi∣vacity, as a man swims faster in a stream than a standing water; but where the original is flat and low, the translator must be at the pains to raise him; so that the best things are the easiest to be done, and the dullest the most difficult. It were presumption in one of my years, to pretend to give an account of the authors whom I have chosen, or their works; to commend their excellences, or condemn their faults: and of the two, I dare venture to say the least of Ovid; when he himself, and all that he has written, have been already so well and so fully treated of in Mr. Dryden's preface before his epistles. But I cannot choose but wonder, that a book so extremely delightful, so soft and sweet, as Tibullus, has lain so long unattempted; but there is a friend of ours, whom I hope he has been all along reserved for, and then he will be in the best hands he could have fallen into. Of the three ele∣gies that I have ventured on, the first, from toward the middle to the end, and the whole third, pleased me infinitely; the second I did merely for the sake of the last ten or twelve lines. Tibullus most, certainly, have felt all he wrote, for he could never have feigned so much passion so well; and I am apt to believe it was not his poetry made him so fond and tender a lover, but rather his love that made him so sweet and excellent a poet. Were it not that I should take him out of better hands, I would have attempted to have englished him all; for I flatter myself with a fancy, that, in some things, I am somewhat of his temper; and how far short so∣ever I come or him in his poetry, I resemble him but too nearly in some other circumstances. I was almost running into a complaint, that would have been both unjust and in∣grateful; for, since I knew you, all occasion of complaint has been taken from me. Your acquaintance would have been of itself sufficient to endear you to any man; but your favours to me began with, and even out-ran, your acquaintance. I dare not proceed, though on a subject which I am very loth to leave; permit me to add only this, that since most who ever wrote have sometimes stood in need of favours from other men, and since the same fortune has attended me, I am glad, however, that it threw me on you to receive them, than whom I know none I could have been more willingly ob∣liged to for them. I am, Sir, your most affectionate, obliged, humble servant, CHARLES HOPKINS."</Q></P>

<L>LET other poets other patrons chuse,</L>

<L>Some trifling present by my lord is made,</L>

<L>On you, my surer, nobler hopes depend,</L>

<DIV2 TYPE="dedication">
<P>MADAM, Beauty, as it is both the theme and inspirer of Poetry, so it ought to be the patroness too; and a poem of Love should in justice be sacred to none but the Loveliest: it would therefore be adoring a false Deity, should I offer up this at any shrine but yours. As it is the best I can do, and written on the most pleasing subject, I was resolved to lay it at the feet of the most beautiful; and had I been myself at a loss where to fix, the universal opinion of the world would have directed me, and pointed out your Grace for the patroness; while the poem shall last (and a poem of Love ought to last longer than any other) succeeding ages shall read that your Grace was the ornament of this age. It is an innocent and harmless ambition in poets, whose only design in all they do is the pleasing others, and in doing that please themselves best; and, as Beauty is the chief object they bend their studies to delight, all poets ought to aspire to please your Grace in particular. That ambition is the best excuse I can make for my presumption in this dedication; since I am unknown to
<PB N="223" REF="226"/>
your Grace, and perhaps even unheard-of yet; but what is my crime is at the same time my plea for pardon; or rather it is my merit. The Athenians, when they dedicated an altar to the Unknown God, shewed more devotion, and directed their devotion to a truer deity, than when they adored the many they knew. That I might be sure of something acceptable in this offering, and not fail to delight in a poem of Love, where all ought to be delightful, I have taken all the most moving tender things that Ovid and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibullus said to their mistresses, to say to mine; nor will I allow it to be a theft, since I doubt not, as it was their love that inspir'd them with those thoughts, mine would have infused the same into me; and no man that thinks naturally of love can avoid running into the same thoughts with them. I have borrowed the examples to every passion from those stories which I thought the most pleasing in Ovid, where certainly the most pleasing were to be met with: some few places in every story I have translated, but for the most part I have only kept him in view; I have gone on with him and left him where I thought it proper, and by that means have avoided the absurdities of his Metamorphoses; save only that of Pigmalion's statue, but that was a Meta∣morphosis that pleased me. It was a delightful sur∣prize to see life breathed into an inanimate beauty, as it would be a killing affliction to see it taken away from one already animated: it would occasion as much joy and wonder to have a Dutchess of GRAFTON made by Art (if Art could do it) as it would cause consternation to have the Gods unmake one. But those miracles of
<PB N="224" REF="227"/>
Art are now ceased; and none but the Heavenly Artist could have drawn you, who has drawn you so that he has left the painter and the poet at a loss to copy you. As to the success of this poem, I hope I am secure, since it is sacred in general to the Fair Sex, and committed in particular to the protection of the Fairest. If they are once pleased, who will dare to find fault? or disoblige them by disliking what they approve? Under the shel∣ter of your Grace's patronage I shall stand, like Aeneas, guarded by the Goddess of Love; and no Diomedes shall be found as desperate as the first to wound me through you. Thus, as all dedicating poets, who write more to raise their own reputation than their patrons, I have taken the most effectual means to esta∣blish mine; and doubt not to make a strong party, since every Lover will defend what is sacred to the Lovely. Your Grace's most devoted, most humble servant,</P>

<L>Her youth and beauty kindled anxious cares,</L>

<L>I thought her faith too firmly fix'd to fall,</L>

<L>I knew not what to think; but straight I go,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to cure, or to compleat my woe:</L>
<L>An habit different from my own I took,</L>
<L>While with curst aid Aurora chang'd my look.</L>
<L>To Athens straight, unknown by all, I came;</L>
<L>Ev'n to myself I scarce could seem the same.</L>
<L>Hardly I got admission to my house,</L>
<L>But far, far harder, to my weeping spouse.</L>
<L>The house itself from aught of blame was free,</L>
<L>And every place express'd its grief for me.</L>
<L>A dismal silence reign'd through every room,</L>
<L>To mourn my loss, already safe at home.</L>
<L><PB N="240" REF="243"/>Ev'n that sad pomp of woe some charms could boast,</L>
<L>But, when my Procris c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me, she charm'd me most.</L>
<L>Black were her robes, her solemn pace was slow;</L>
<L>Her dress was careless, yet becoming too.</L>
<L>A virtuous grief dwelt deeply in her face,</L>
<L>But matchless beauty gave that grief a grace.</L>
<L>Whole showers of tears her streaming eyes let fall,</L>
<L>Yet something wondrous lovely shone through all.</L>
<L>Scarce could I at the charming sight forbear</L>
<L>From running to embrace my mournful fair,</L>
<L>Scarce hold, from telling whom she saw (though alter'd) there.</L>
<L>But yet at length my first design pursued,</L>
<L>With words I flatter'd, and with gifts I woo'd.</L>
<L>All the most moving arguments I us'd,</L>
<L>Oft pray'd and press'd, but was as oft refus'd.</L>
<L>She said, another had before engross'd</L>
<L>All her affection, and my suit was lost.</L>
<L>Would any but a mad-man farther try?</L>
<L>But ah! that mad, that desperate fool was I.</L>
<L>I grew the more industrious to destroy</L>
<L>Her matchless truth, and ruin all my joy.</L>
<L>Redoubled presents and redoubled vows</L>
<L>I made and offer'd, to betray my spouse.</L>
</LG>

<L>At last, her staggering faith began to yield,</L>
<L>And I 'ad just won the long disputed field.</L>
<L>" Thy falsehood, straight I cried, too late I see,</L>
<L>False to thy Cephalus, for I am he.</L>

<L>Forsworn and false, what woman can be true?"</L>

<L>She at these words, almost of sense bereav'd,</L>
<L>With sad confusion found herself deceiv'd.</L>
<L>Fix'd on the ground she kept her downcast eye,</L>
<L>And, silent with her shame, made no reply.</L>
<L>But to the mountains like an huntress hies,</L>
<L>And for my sake from all mankind she slies.</L>
<L>Which when I found, abandon'd and alone,</L>
<L>My dearer half through my own folly gone,</L>

<L>My prayers, dispatch'd with eagerness and haste,</L>
<L>That she would pardon all offences past,</L>
<L>Found her as kind as she was truly chaste.</L>
<L>She came, and crown'd my joys a second time.</L>
<L>Forgot my jealousy, forgave my crime.</L>
<L>'Twas then I thought my greatest miseries o'er.</L>
<L>But Fate, it seems, had worse, far worse in store.</L>
<L>Soon as each early sun began to rise,</L>
<L>To glad th' enlighten'd earth, and gild the skies,</L>
<L>I with his first appearance rise, and trace</L>
<L>The woods and hills, that yielded game to chace.</L>
<L>Alone I hunt a long and tedious way,</L>
<L>And seldom fail to kill sufficient prey;</L>
<L>Then, spent with toil, to cooler shades retreat,</L>
<L>And seek a refuge from the scorching heat.</L>
<L>Where pleasant valleys breathe a freer air,</L>
<L>For my refreshment I address this prayer:</L>

<L>While this I sung, some one who chanc'd to hear</L>

<L>And I was to my lov'd diversion gone,</L>
<L>She rose, and sought the solitary shade,</L>
<L>Where after hunting I was daily laid.</L>
<L>Close in a thicket undiscern'd she stood,</L>
<L>When I took shelter in the shady wood.</L>
<L>Then, stretching on the grass my fainting weight,</L>

<L>At this a sudden noise invades my ear,</L>

<L>I, rashly thinking it some savage beast,</L>
<L>Threw my unerring dart with heedless haste,</L>
<L>Which pierc'd, oh Gods! my Procris through the breast.</L>
<L>She at the wound with fearful shriekings fell;</L>
<L>And I, alas! knew the dear voice too well.</L>
<L>Thither, distracted with my grief, I flew,</L>
<L>To give my dying Love a sad adieu.</L>
<L>All bloody was her lately snowy breast,</L>

<L>With rage I tore my robe, which close I bound,</L>
<L>To stop the blood about the gaping wound.</L>
<L>What pardons did I beg! what curses frame,</L>
<L>For my damn'd fate, that was alone in blame!</L>
<L>When, weakly raising up her dying head,</L>
<L>With a faint voice these few sad words she said:</L>
<L>" Draw nearer yet, dear author of my death,</L>
<L>Hear my last<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>signs, and snatch my parting breath.</L>

<L>Of tears, which nothing else but love could force,</L>
<L>To the dear maid he turns his watery eyes,</L>
<L>And to her sad discourse as sad replies:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Thou late best blessing of my joyful heart,</L>
<L>Now grown my grief, since I must now depart:</L>
<L>Behold the pangs I bear, look up and see</L>
<L>How much I grieve to go; and comfort me.</L>
<L>Curse on that cunning traitor's smooth deceit,</L>
<L>Whose craft has made me, to my ruin, great!</L>
<L>Curse on that artifice by which I fell!</L>
<L>Curse on these hands for wielding swords so well!</L>
<L>Though I should ne'er so fit for battle prove,</L>
<L>All my ambition 's to be fit for love.</L>
<L>In his soft wars I would my life beguile,</L>
<L>With thee contend in the transporting toil,</L>
<L>Ravish'd to read my triumph in thy smile.</L>
<L>Boldly I'd strive, yet ev'n when conquering yield</L>
<L>To thee the glory of the bloodless field;</L>
<L>With liquid fires melt thy rich beauties down,</L>
<L>Rifle thy wealth, yet give thee all my own.</L>
<L>So should our wars be rapture and delight,</L>
<L>But now I'm summon'd to another fight.</L>
<L>'Tis not my fault that I am forc'd away,</L>
<L>But, when my honour calls, I must obey.</L>
<L>Durst I not death and every danger brave,</L>
<L>I were not worthy of the bliss I have.</L>
<L>More hazards than another would I meet,</L>
<L>Only to lay more laurels at your feet.</L>
<L><PB N="255" REF="258"/>Oh! do not fear that I should faithless prove,</L>
<L>For you, my only life, have all my love.</L>
<L>The thought of you shall help me to subdue,</L>
<L>I'll conquer faster to return to you.</L>
<L>But, if my honours should be laid in dust,</L>
<L>And I must fall, as Heaven has said I must;</L>
<L>Ev'n in my death my only grief will be,</L>
<L>That I for ever shall be snatch'd from thee.</L>
<L>That, that alone, occasions all my fears,</L>
<L>Shakes my resolves, and melts me into tears.</L>
<L>My beating heart pants to thee as I speak,</L>
<L>And wishes, rather than depart, to break.</L>
<L>Feel how it trembles with a panic fright,</L>
<L>Sure it will never fail me thus in fight.</L>
<L>I cannot longer hold this fond discourse,</L>
<L>For now the trumpets sound our sad divorce.</L>
<L>Sound every trumpet there, beat every drum.</L>
<L>Use all your charms to make Achilles come.</L>
<L>Farewell, alas! I have not time to tell</L>
<L>How wondrous loth I part; once more, farewell.</L>
<L>Remember me as I'll remember you,</L>
<L>Like me be constant, and like me be true;</L>

<L>Would he himself contribute to his rest;</L>
<L>Would he resolve to struggle through the net,</L>
<L>And but a while endeavour to forget.</L>
<L>But his mad thoughts run every passage o'er,</L>
<L>And anxious memory makes his passion more;</L>
<L>Perplexing memory, that renews the scene</L>
<L>Of his past cares, and keeps him still in pain;</L>
<L>Keeps a poor wretch perpetually oppress'd,</L>
<L>And never lets unhappy lovers rest;</L>
<L>Lets them no pangs, no cruel sufferings lose,</L>
<L>But heaps their past upon their present woes.</L>
<L>Such was Leander's memory when remov'd</L>
<L>And sunder'd by the seas from all he lov'd.</L>
<L>The gather'd winds had wrought the tempest high,</L>
<L>Toss'd up the ocean, and obscur'd the sky;</L>
<L>And at this time, with an impetuous sway,</L>
<L>Pour'd sorth their forces, and possess'd the sea.</L>
<L>When the bold youth stood raging on the beach,</L>
<L>To view the much-lov'd coast he could not reach;</L>
<L>His restless eyes ran all the distance o'er,</L>
<L>And from afar discern'd his Hero's tower.</L>
<L>Thrice naked in the waves his skill he try'd,</L>
<L>And strove, as he was us'd, to stem the tide;</L>
<L>But tumbling billows threaten'd present wreck,</L>
<L>And, rising up against him, dash'd him back.</L>
<L>Then, like a gallant soldier, forc'd to go</L>
<L>Full of brave wrath from a prevailing foe,</L>
<L>Again to town he makes his sad resort,</L>
<L>To see what ships would loosen from the port;</L>
<L><PB N="257" REF="260"/>Finding but one durst launch into the seas,</L>
<L>He writes a letter, fill'd with words like these:</L>

<L>And only this bold bark durst put to sea.</L>
<L>I too had come, had not my parents' spies</L>
<L>Stood by, to watch me with suspicious eyes.</L>
<L>How many tedious days and nights are past</L>

<L>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spightful Gods and Goddesses, who keep</L>
<L>Your watery courts within the spacious deep,</L>
<L>Why at this time are all the winds broke forth,</L>
<L>Why swell the seas beneath the furious north?</L>
<L>'Tis summer now, when all should be serene,</L>
<L>The sky's unclouded, undisturb'd the main;</L>
<L>Winter is yet unwilling to appear;</L>
<L>But you invert the seasons of the year.</L>
<L>Yet let me once attain the wish'd-for beach,</L>
<L>Out of the now malicious Neptune's reach.</L>
<L>Then blow, ye winds; ye troubled billows, roar,</L>
<L>Roll on your angry waves, and lash the shore;</L>
<L>Ruffle the seas, drive the tempestuous air,</L>
<L>Be one continued storm to keep me there.</L>
<L>Ah! Hero, when to you my course is bent,</L>
<L>I seem to slide along a smooth descent.</L>
<L><PB N="258" REF="261"/>But, in returning thence, I clamber up,</L>
<L>And scale, methinks, some lofty mountain's top.</L>
<L>Why, when our souls by mutual love are join'd,</L>
<L>Why are we sunder'd by the sea and wind?</L>
<L>Either make my Abydos your retreat,</L>
<L>Or let your Sestos be my much-lov'd seat.</L>
<L>This plague of absence I can bear no more;</L>

<L>Mean while the vessel from the land withdrew,</L>
<L>When Heaven took pity on a love so true.</L>
<L>The winds to blow, the waves to toss forbore,</L>
<L>In leaps the ravish'd youth, and ventures o'er,</L>
<L>With a smooth passage to the farther shore.</L>
<L>Now to the port the prosperous lover drives,</L>
<L>And safely after all his toils arrives.</L>
<L>Dissolv'd in bliss, he lies the live-long night,</L>
<L>Melts, languishes, and dies in vast delight.</L>
<L>But that delight my Muse forbears to sing,</L>
<L>She knows the weakness of her infant wing.</L>
<L>As when the painter strove to draw the chief</L>
<L>Of all the Grecians, in his height of grief;</L>
<L><PB N="259" REF="262"/>In every limb the well-shap'd piece excell'd,</L>

<L>He should not reach the woe he fancied there;</L>
<L>But round the mournful head a veil he threw,</L>
<L>That men might guess at what he could not shew.</L>
<L>So when our pleasure rises to excess,</L>
<L>No tongue can tell it, and no pen express.</L>
<L>Love will not have his mysteries reveal'd,</L>
<L>And Beauty keeps the joys it gives conceal'd;</L>
<L>And till those joys my Delia lets me know,</L>
<L>To me they shall continue ever so.</L>
</LG>

<L>Ah! Delia, would indulgent Love decree,</L>
<L>Thy faithful slave that heaven of bliss with thee;</L>
<L>What then should be my verse! what daring flights</L>
<L>Should my Muse take! reach what coelestial heights!</L>
<L>Now in despair with drooping notes she sings,</L>
<L>No dawn of hope to raise her on her wings.</L>

<L>STAY, wretched swain, lie here, and here lament;</L>
<L>Press not too far your strength already spent.</L>

<L>And bend o'erburdened with their load of woe.</L>
<L>Stay, and this melancholy grotto choose,</L>
<L>A proper mansion for a mourning Muse.</L>
<L>Lay your tir'd limbs extended on the moss,</L>
<L>And tell the listening woods of Delia's loss:</L>
<L>Here the sad Muse need no disturbance fear,</L>

<L>What musick now can my sad numbers boast!</L>
<L>What Muse invoke! alas! my Muse is lost.</L>
<L>Long since my useless pipe was thrown aside,</L>
<L>My reeds were broke that hour that Delia died.</L>
<L><PB N="265" REF="268"/>From her alone their inspiration came,</L>
<L>She gave the verse, and was the verse's theme.</L>
<L>For ever should my sorrows keep me dumb,</L>
<L>Silent as death, and hush'd as Delia's tomb,</L>
<L>Did not the force of Love unlock my tongue,</L>
<L>Lest her dear beauties should remain unsung.</L>
<L>Her charms let every Muse conspire to tell,</L>
<L>And, that once done, let every Muse farewell.</L>
<L>This the last tribute of my verse I bring,</L>
<L>To sing her death, and then no more to sing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be still, ye winds, or in soft whispers blow;</L>
<L>Ye purling streams, with gentler murmurs flow;</L>
<L>Let lambs forbear to bleat, and herds to low.</L>
<L>Let all in easy mournful numbers move,</L>
<L>Let all be soft, and artless as my Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! she was every way divinely fair,</L>
<L>Charming in person, and in soul sincere.</L>
<L>She was, alas! more than the Muse can tell,</L>
<L>Well worthy love, and was belov'd as well.</L>
<L>She was—alas! these tears that saying draws,</L>
<L>Oh! 'tis a cruel, killing word—<HI>She was!</HI></L>
<L>Now she no more must tread the flowery plains,</L>
<L>No more be gaz'd at by admiring swains.</L>
<L>No more the choicest flowers and daisies choose,</L>
<L>Or pluck the pasture for her tender ewes.</L>
<L>Say, ye poor flocks, how often have ye stood,</L>
<L>And from her lovely hands receiv'd your food!</L>
<L>Now ye no more from those fair hands must feast,</L>
<L>Those hands which gave the flowers a sweeter taste.</L>
<L>Mourn her, by whom ye were so often fed,</L>
<L>And cry with me, the shepherdess is dead.</L>
<L><PB N="266" REF="269"/>This the last tribute of my verse I bring,</L>
<L>To sing her death, and then no more to sing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Weep for her loss, relenting Heaven, and keep</L>
<L>Time with our tears! Heaven seems apace to weep.</L>
<L>In murmuring drops the mournful rain distills,</L>
<L>And fable clouds wrap round the sides of hills.</L>
<L>The goat forbears to browze, the tender ewe</L>
<L>Will drink no longer of the falling dew.</L>
<L>No morning larks their mounting wings display,</L>
<L>Or chear with warbling airs the dusky day.</L>
<L>On dropping boughs sad nightingales complain,</L>
<L>Join in my songs, but sing like me in vain.</L>
<L>In doleful notes the murmuring turtles coo,</L>
<L>Each of them seems t' have lost a Delia too.</L>
<L>The melting air in mists its sorrows shews,</L>
<L>And cold damp sweat the face of earth bedews.</L>
<L>With tears the River-gods enlarge their spring,</L>
<L>Swans in sad strains on swelling waters sing.</L>
<L>In sighs the God of Winds his passion vents,</L>
<L>And all, all Nature for her loss laments.</L>

<L>How often, on the banks of silver Thames,</L>
<L>My eyes on hers, and hers upon the streams,</L>
<L>Has she stood listening when I told my flames!</L>
<L>How often has a sudden, sidelong look,</L>
<L>Seem'd to confess her pity when I spoke!</L>
<L>Pity I had, though I could never move</L>
<L>In her cold breast the least return of love.</L>
<L><PB N="267" REF="270"/>Pity from her more welcome did receive,</L>
<L>Than all the love another fair could give.</L>
<L>And it was some, some small relief to see</L>
<L>She lov'd not others, though she lov'd not me.</L>
<L>Say, gentle Thames, how often have I stood,</L>
<L>Viewing her dear reflection in your flood!</L>
<L>When on her face I durst not gaze for fear,</L>
<L>How often have I look'd, and found it there!</L>
<L>How often have I wish d my verse might prove</L>
<L>Smooth as your stream, whene'er I writ of Love!</L>
<L>Say, how your courteous waves would never flow</L>
<L>O'er any path where she was us'd to go.</L>
<L>Now let your river, like my eyes, run o'er,</L>
<L>Insult with fuller tides the desart shore,</L>

<L>Blue violets and blushing roses, fade,</L>
<L>Fold your silk leaves, and hang your drooping head,</L>

<L>Let constant showers lay all the country waste;</L>
<L>Let flames unto the centre downwards tend,</L>
<L>And let the floods, untoss'd by winds, ascend;</L>
<L>Let all things change, and wear another face,</L>
<L>Let Nature not appear the same she was;</L>
<L>Let fowl to dwell beneath the waters try,</L>

<L>See, where the God of Love all sad appears,</L>
<L>His smoaking torch extinguish'd with his tears.</L>
<L>Well may he weep for his declining power,</L>
<L>His charm is done since Delia is no more.</L>
<L>Through her he conquer'd, and through her he reign'd;</L>
<L>Her beauties his decaying sway sustain'd,</L>
<L>And, she now gone, his empire is disdain'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See, where Diana, with a stately train</L>
<L>Of goodly nymphs, descends upon the plain;</L>
<L>Each of them weeps, and leans upon her bow,</L>
<L>And mourns her fellow Delia wanting now.</L>
<L>The Goddess grieves, to see her train decreas'd,</L>
<L>And swelling sighs shake every virgin breast.</L>
<L>Unhurt they let the stags beside them pass,</L>

<BYLINE>BY THE SAME.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>NO beauteous nymph could youthful Phoebus move,</L>
<L>Till Daphne's charms inspir'd him first with love;</L>
<L>A virgin, sprung from Peneus' silver stream,</L>
<L>Fair as the crystal waters whence she came.</L>
<L><PB N="270" REF="273"/>No blind effects of chance subdued the god,</L>
<L>But just revenge which injur'd Cupid ow'd;</L>
<L>For Phoebus saw him as his bow he drew,</L>
<L>And, scoffing, cry'd, "Those are not arms for you!</L>
<L>To me your quiver and your shafts resign,</L>
<L>They load your shoulders, but sit well on mine;</L>
<L>Your arrows drop from your enervate arm,</L>
<L>And are not sent with force enough to harm;</L>
<L>But, when I shoot, with my unerring hands,</L>
<L>On the fleet shaft as fleet a death attends.</L>
<L>Witness the monstrous Python lately slain,</L>
<L>Against whose scales your darts had been in vain,</L>
<L>He still had liv'd, and ravag'd all the plain.</L>
<L>In yonder vale by me behold him kill'd,</L>
<L>Shedding his poisonous gore o'er all the field.</L>
<L>Be you content to kindle amorous fires,</L>
<L>Inspiring childish loves and soft desires;</L>
<L>Attempt not things beyond your feeble powers,</L>
<L>Hold your own empire, and usurp not ours.</L>
<L>The slighted God, in short, replies, by thee,</L>
<L>Let other breasts be pierc'd, but thine by me.</L>
<L>As human force is conquer'd by divine,</L>
<L>So shalt thou find my powers excelling thine."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He spoke, and spread his wings, and mounted up,</L>
<L>Nor rested till he reach'd Parnassus' top.</L>
<L>From his full quiver all his darts he drew,</L>
<L>And from them all he made his choice of two.</L>
<L>Differing the passions which their points create,</L>
<L>The one producing love, the other hate:</L>
<L><PB N="271" REF="274"/>With this the beauteous virgin's breast he pierc'd;</L>
<L>But he wounds Phoebus deeper with the first.</L>
<L>High on the mountain's utmost cliff he stood,</L>
<L>And took his fatal aim, and shot the god:</L>
<L>Swiftly it flies through his envenom'd reins;</L>
<L>Fires all his blood, and poisons all his veins.</L>
<L>The deadly shafts their purpos'd ends obtain;</L>
<L>Work love in him, in her as fierce disdain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her only joy was ranging through the grove,</L>
<L>To shun her lovers, and their tales of love.</L>
<L>There the wild boars were wounded with her spear;</L>
<L>Her only passion was to conquer there.</L>
<L>All her attire was like Diana's train,</L>
<L>Alike her humour in avoiding men.</L>
<L>Her numerous courtiers met with numerous slights,</L>
<L>She fled from Hymen and his hated rites:</L>
<L>Oft had her father prompted her to wed,</L>
<L>By fond desires of future grandsons led:</L>
<L>Oft had he told her, that she ow'd a debt</L>
<L>Of smiling nephews, which he hop'd-for yet.</L>
<L>She starts, and thinks she understands him wrong,</L>
<L>Nor would have heard it from another tongue.</L>
<L>Then, hanging on her father, thus she pray'd,</L>
<L>" Oh! only lov'd of all your sex, she said,</L>
<L>Oh! give me leave to live and die a maid!"</L>
<L>He, too indulgent, yields, but yields in vain,</L>
<L>To what she cannot from herself obtain;</L>
<L>That matchless form was made to be admir'd,</L>
<L>And she is, in her own despight, desir'd:</L>
<L><PB N="272" REF="275"/>The youthful Phoebus courts her for his bride,</L>
<L>And loves too fiercely to be long deny'd.</L>
<L>With hopes, he would not for his godhead lose,</L>
<L>By his own oracles deceiv'd, he wooes.</L>
<L>As fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es in spacious fields of stubble thrown,</L>
<L>When the first blaze of flame is once begun,</L>
<L>The winds with fury drive the torrent on:</L>
<L>So burns the god, and so receives the fires,</L>
<L>And sooths with flattering hopes his fond desires.</L>
<L>He sees her hair dishevel'd on her back,</L>
<L>And part in circles twining round her neck.</L>
<L>" If such their charms disorder'd thus, he cry'd,</L>
<L>Ah! what if Nature were with Art supply'd!"</L>
<L>He sees her sparkling eyes, that shine like stars,</L>
<L>But with an influence far more strong than theirs.</L>
<L>He sees her balmy lips, and longs to kiss;</L>
<L>For, oh! he is not satisfy'd he sees.</L>
<L>Her hands and arms fill his unwearied sight;</L>
<L>He looks on all with wonder and delight.</L>
<L>He sees her snowy thighs, her swelling breast;</L>
<L>If aught lay hid, he still concludes it best:</L>
<L>And yet in vain is all the God can say,</L>
<L>The dear, disdainful virgin will not stay,</L>
<L>But flies the swifter, as she hears him pray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Stay Daphne, stay, it is no foe pursues,</L>
<L>I follow not as lustful Satyrs use:</L>
<L>The trembling deer fly from the lion so,</L>
<L>The lambs from wolves, each from his mortal foe.</L>
<L>They by their swift pursuit their prey design;</L>
<L>But love, the tenderest love, occasions mine.</L>
<L><PB N="273" REF="276"/>Beware, dear maid, lest any barbarous thorn</L>
<L>Tear those soft limbs, too beauteous to be torn.</L>
<L>Rough are the ways you follow with such speed,</L>
<L>Ah! yet beware, be cautious how you tread!</L>
<L>Or stay, or do not make such dangerous haste;</L>
<L>I too will stay, or not pursue so fast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Stay, Daphne, stay, ah! whither do you run?</L>
<L>Alas! fond nymph, you know not whom you shun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>No rustic labouring hind, no savage swain;</L>
<L>I keep no lowing herds upon the plain:</L>
<L>Delphos and Tenedos my rule obey,</L>
<L>In several isles I several sceptres sway;</L>
<L>All nations offer incense at my shrine,</L>
<L>And all those beams that light the world are mine:</L>
<L>Jove does acknowledge me his darling son,</L>
<L>And gives me power the greatest next his own:</L>
<L>I know what Time bears in her teeming womb,</L>
<L>And all that was, and is, and is to come:</L>
<L>I teach soft numbers to the mighty Nine,</L>
<L>The wondrous harmony they make is mine:</L>
<L>Sure are the wounds I send from every dart,</L>
<L>But Love made surer when he pierc'd my heart:</L>
<L>To the sick earth safe remedies I give,</L>
<L>Allotting man a longer time to live;</L>
<L>To me the use of every herb is known,</L>
<L>Vain art, alas! since Love is cur'd by none!</L>
<L>To all besides, they do their aid afford,</L>
<L>Unable only to relieve their Lord."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Much more he would have told the flying fair,</L>
<L>But the regardless virgin would not hear.</L>
<L><PB N="274" REF="277"/>With doubled swiftness she out-runs the wind,</L>
<L>And leaves his yet unfinish'd speech behind.</L>
<L>The winds, that toss'd her flowing robes abroad,</L>
<L>Shew'd a whole Heaven of beauty to the God.</L>
<L>Her naked limbs to his full view display'd;</L>
<L>The God, the ravish'd God, saw all the maid.</L>
<L>Her every step inflames his fierce desires,</L>
<L>Her every motion fans the raging fires.</L>
<L>Still the fair nymph grew lovelier as she fled,</L>
<L>Loose in the air her golden locks were spread,</L>
<L>And her cheeks glow'd with an unusual red.</L>
<L>Th' impatient God admits no more delay,</L>
<L>And throws no more unheeded words away:</L>
<L>Stronger his pliant limbs he strives to move,</L>
<L>Love urges on, he takes new force from love.</L>
<L>So the swift greyhound, when his game he views,</L>
<L>With eager stretch o'er all the plain pursues;</L>
<L>Now comes so near, that he is forc'd to stoop,</L>
<L>With the false hopes he has to snatch her up:</L>
<L>The trembling hare runs on with dreadful doubt,</L>
<L>Whether she is already seiz'd or not;</L>
<L>She uses all her art to help her flight;</L>
<L>And doubles just enough to scape the bite.</L>
<L>So Daphne flies, wing'd with, her mortal fear;</L>
<L>Wing'd with his love, so Phoebus follows her.</L>
<L>But he still gains advantage in the race,</L>
<L>For Love redoubles his impetuous pace.</L>
<L>With arms expanded, he pursues the fair,</L>
<L>And plies his eager feet so very near,</L>
<L>She feels his breath warm through her flying hair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="275" REF="278"/>
<L>Now, as her utmost force was well-nigh spent,</L>
<L>And her o'er-labour'd legs began to faint;</L>
<L>Her course to that delightful stream she bends,</L>
<L>Which from her father's silver urn descends:</L>
<L>With moving looks the water she surveys,</L>
<L>And thus the sad and lovely suppliant prays:</L>
<L>Oh! save me yet, ere I am quite betray'd,</L>
<L>Exert your godhead, and preserve a maid:</L>
<L>To some new form change my too charming shape,</L>
<L>Or let me lose my being, to escape!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Immediate grant was given her as she pray'd,</L>
<L>And sudden numbness through her limbs was spread;</L>
<L>Thin films o'er all her lovely frame are cast,</L>
<L>And with close folds they compass-in her waist;</L>
<L>Her hair to leaves, her arms to branches shoot,</L>
<L>Her feet, depriv'd of swiftness, form the root;</L>
<L>Her beauteous head chang'd to the leafy top,</L>
<L>And yet not wholly, ere the God came up:</L>
<L>For now he ran with more immoderate speed,</L>
<L>But not with haste enough t' embrace the maid;</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>till lovely, though of human shape bereft,</L>
<L>And he still loves her in the shape she 'as left.</L>
<L>He lays his hand upon the new-made plant,</L>
<L>While yet her heart beneath the rind did pant;</L>
<L>He clasp'd her, with the thought of what she 'ad been,</L>
<L>And, oh! he wish'd her still the same as then;</L>
<L>With the same scorn his kisses she disdain'd,</L>
<L>Her scorn, alas! was all she still retain'd.</L>
<L>" I have thee now, such as thou art, he cry'd,</L>
<L>And thou shalt be my tree, though not my bride.</L>
<L><PB N="276" REF="279"/>My quiver shall be hung upon thy boughs,</L>
<L>And thy dear leaves be wreath'd about my brows.</L>
<L>Thou shalt the heads of demi gods adorn,</L>
<L>And be by poets and their heroes worn.</L>
<L>When Caesar shall from vanquish'd nations come,</L>
<L>Drawn in his chariot through the streets of Rome;</L>
<L>When to the capitol their spoils they bring,</L>
<L>And Io Paeans make th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> temple ring:</L>
<L>Then, planted at Augustus' gilded doors,</L>
<L>Thou, like an houshold god, shalt guard his floors.</L>
<L>And as the tresses on my youthful head</L>
<L>Keep their first lustre still, and never fade;</L>
<L>The verdant beauty of thy leaves shall last,</L>
<L>Not to be wither'd by the Winter's blast."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus the God finish'd; and the Laurel bow'd</L>
<L>Her branches down, to thank the bounteous God.</L>

<L>THE vocal nymph this lovely huntsman view'd,</L>
<L>As he into the toils his prey pursued.</L>
<L>Though of the power of speaking first debarr'd,</L>
<L>She could not hold from answering what she heard.</L>
<L>The jealous Juno, by her wiles betray'd,</L>
<L>Took this revenge on the deceitful maid:</L>
<L>For, when she might have seiz'd her faithless Jove,</L>
<L>Often in amorous thefts of lawless love,</L>
<L>Her tedious talk would make the Goddess stay,</L>
<L>And give her rivals time to run away;</L>
<L>Which when she found, she cried, "For such a wrong,</L>
<L>Small be the power of that deluding tongue!"</L>
<L>Immediately the deed confirm'd the threats,</L>
<L>For Echo only what she hears repeats.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="279" REF="282"/>
<L>Now at the sight of the fair youth she glows,</L>
<L>And follows silently where-e'er he goes.</L>
<L>The nearer she pursued, the more she mov'd</L>
<L>Through the dear track he trod, the more she lov'd:</L>
<L>Still her approach inflam'd her fierce desile;</L>
<L>As sulphurous torches catch the neighbouring fire.</L>
<L>How often would she strive, but strive in vain,</L>
<L>To tell her passion, and confess her pain!</L>
<L>A thousand tender things her thoughts suggest,</L>
<L>With which she would have woo'd, but they, supprest</L>
<L>For want of speech, lay bury'd in her breast.</L>
<L>Begin she could not, but she stay'd to wait</L>
<L>Till he should speak, and she his speech repeat.</L>
<L>Now several ways his young companions gone,</L>
<L>And for some time Narcissus left alone.</L>
<L>" Where are you all?" at last she hears him call,</L>
<L>And she strait answers him, <HI>Where are you all?</HI></L>
<L>Around he lets his wandering eye-sight roam,</L>
<L>But sees no creature whence the voice should come:</L>
<L>" Speak yet again, he cries, is any nigh?"</L>
<L>Again the mournful Echo answers, <HI>I.</HI></L>
<L>" Why come not you?" says he; appear in view,</L>
<L>She hastily returns, <HI>Why come not you?</HI></L>
<L>Once more the voice th' astonish'd huntsman try'd,</L>
<L>Louder he call'd, and louder she reply'd.</L>
<L>" Then let us join," at last Narcissus said:</L>
<L><HI>Then let us join,</HI> replied the ravish'd maid.</L>
<L>Scarce had she spoke, when from the woods she sprung,</L>
<L>And on his neck with close embraces hung.</L>
<L><PB N="280" REF="283"/>But he with all his strength unlocks her fold,</L>
<L>And breaks unkindly from her feeble hold.</L>
<L>Then proudly cries, "Life shall this breast forsake,</L>

<L><HI>On me your pleasure take,</HI> the Nymph replies,</L>
<L>While from her the disdainful huntsman flies.</L>

<L>Repuls'd, with speed she seeks the gloomiest groves,</L>
<L>And pines to think on her rejected loves;</L>
<L>Alone laments her ill-required flame,</L>
<L>And in the closest thickets shrouds her shame.</L>
<L>Her rage to be refus'd yields no relief,</L>
<L>But her fond passion is increas'd by grief;</L>
<L>The thoughts of such a slight all sleep suppress'd,</L>
<L>And kept her languishing for want of rest:</L>

<L>Her skin contracts, her blood dissolves to air;</L>
<L>Nothing but voice and bones she now retains,</L>
<L>These turn to stones, but still the voice remains:</L>
<L>In woods, caves hills, for ever hid she lies,</L>
<L>Heard by all ears, but never seen by eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus her and other nymphs his proud disdain</L>
<L>With an unheard-of cruelty h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d slain:</L>
<L>Many, on mountains and in rivers borne,</L>
<L>Thus perish'd underneath his haughty scorn:</L>

<L>Nature had plac'd a crystal fountain near,</L>
<L>The water deep, but to the bottom clear;</L>
<L>Whose silver spring ascended gently up,</L>
<L>And bubbled softly to the silent top.</L>
<L>The surface smooth as icy lakes-appear'd,</L>

<L>No bending tree above its surface grows,</L>

<L>Down on his face, to drink the spring, he lies;</L>
<L>But, as his image in that glass he spies,</L>
<L>He drinks-in passion deeper at his eyes.</L>
<L>His own reflection works his wild desire;</L>
<L>And he himself sets his own self on fire.</L>
<L>Fix'd as some statue, he preserves his place,</L>
<L>Intent his looks, and motionless his face.</L>
<L>Deep through the spring his eye-balls dart their beams,</L>
<L>Like midnight stars that twinkle in the streams.</L>
<L>His ivory neck the crystal mirror shows,</L>
<L>His waving hair above the surface flows,</L>
<L>His cheeks reflect the lily and the rose:</L>

<L>He loves himself, who for himself was lov'd;</L>
<L>Who seeks, is sought; who kindles the desires,</L>
<L>Is scorch'd himself; who is admir'd, admires:</L>
<L><PB N="282" REF="285"/>Oft would he the deceitful spring embrace,</L>
<L>And seek to fasten on that lovely face;</L>
<L>Oft with his down-thrust arms he thought to fold</L>
<L>About that neck that still deludes his hold.</L>
<L>He gets no kisses from those cozening lips;</L>
<L>His arms grasp nothing, from himself he slips;</L>
<L>He knows not what he views, and yet pursues</L>
<L>His desperate love, and burns for what he views.</L>
<L>Catch not so fondly at a fleeting shade,</L>
<L>And be no longer by yourself betray'd;</L>
<L>It borrows all it has from you alone,</L>
<L>And it can boast of nothing of its own:</L>
<L>With you it comes, with you it stays, and so</L>
<L>Would go away, had you the power to go!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Neither for sleep nor hunger would he move,</L>
<L>But, gazing, still augments his hopeless love:</L>
<L>Still o'er the spring he keeps his bending head,</L>
<L>Still with that flattering form his eyes he fed,</L>
<L>And silently surveys the treacherous shade.</L>
<L>To the deaf-woods at length his grief he vents,</L>
<L>And in these words the wretched youth laments:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Tell me; ye hills and dales and neighbouring groves,</L>

<L>But, when he looks, and sees the wounds he made</L>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">

<L>" HOW are you chang'd of late, my Love! how grown</L>
<L>So tir'd of me, so pressing to be gone!</L>
<L>What have I done, to make my lord remove</L>
<L>So far from her, who once had all his love?</L>
<L>Is your Halcyone no longer dear?</L>
<L>Or, to whatever place your course you steer,</L>
<L>Can you enjoy yourself, and she not there?</L>
<L>Yet if you went by land 't were some relief,</L>
<L>For all that would torment me then were grief.</L>
<L>But now, at once with grief and fear opprest,</L>

<L><PB N="291" REF="294"/>The faithless seas are what, alas! I fear</L>
<L>I must not let my Ceyx venture there.</L>
<L>Oft have I heard their troubled waters roar,</L>
<L>And seen their foaming waves surmount the shore;</L>
<L>Oft seen the wreck come floating to the coast,</L>
<L>And venturous wretches by their folly lost.</L>
<L>Nor have I seldom sad inscriptions read</L>
<L>On marble tombs, which yet inclos'd no dead.</L>
<L>Let me alone, my Ceyx be believ'd,</L>
<L>And be not by your flattering hopes deceiv'd.</L>
<L>Trust not the seas, although my father binds</L>
<L>Within his rocky caves the struggling winds.</L>
<L>If once broke loose, nought can their rage restrain,</L>
<L>They sweep o'er all the earth, swell all the main;</L>
<L>Drive clouds on clouds by an abortive birth,</L>
<L>From their dark wombs flashing the thunder forth;</L>
<L>More, more than what my feeble words express,</L>
<L>Which only represent their fury less.</L>
<L>Let me persuade, for I have seen them rage,</L>
<L>Seen all the wars the fighting winds could wage.</L>
<L>Did you, like me, their stern encounters know,</L>
<L>As daring as you are, you would not go.</L>
<L>If all this fail to move your stubborn mind,</L>
<L>And you will go, oh! leave not me behind;</L>
<L>Take me along, let me your fortunes share,</L>
<L>There's nought too hard for love like mine to bear.</L>
<L>In storms and calms together let us keep,</L>
<L>Together brave the dangers of the deep;</L>
<L>The grant of this my flattering love assures,</L>

<L>Thus spoke the lovely queen, all drown'd in tears,</L>
<L>Nor was her husband's passion less than hers;</L>
<L>Yet would he not his first resolves recall,</L>

<L>He said whate'er he fancy'd might abate</L>
<L>Her griefs, although his own were full as great.</L>
<L>Yet all in vain he labour'd to remove</L>
<L>The tender fears of her prophetic love.</L>
<L>Still the same sighs from her heav'd heart arise,</L>
<L>And the same streams still bubble at her eyes.</L>
<L>All this succeeding not, "My love, he cry'd,</L>
<L>(The last best speech that could be then apply'd)</L>
<L>To you should Ceyx' absence tedious seem,</L>
<L>Believe that yours is not less so to him;</L>

<L>And, mix'd with sighs, forc'd-out a faint adieu.</L>
<L>Then, as he left her hold, too feeble grown</L>

<L>The last sad pangs, at parting, sunk her down.</L>
<L><PB N="293" REF="296"/>Th' impatient seamen call upon their lord,</L>

<L>Then, having fix'd their oars, begin to sweep,</L>

<L>Faintly her opening eyes the ship survey,</L>

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF THE GOD OF SLEEP, AND HIS PALACE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Near the Cimmerians, hid from human sight,</L>
<L>Lies a vast hollow cave, all void of light;</L>
<L><PB N="300" REF="303"/>Where, deep in earth, the God his court maintains,</L>
<L>And, undisturb'd, in ease and silence reigns;</L>
<L>Not seen by Phoebus at his morning rise,</L>
<L>Nor at mid-day with his most piercing eyes,</L>
<L>Nor when at evening he descends the skies.</L>
<L>Thick gloomy mists come steaming from the ground,</L>
<L>And the fog spreads a dusky twilight round;</L>
<L>No crested fowls foretell the day's return,</L>
<L>Nor with shrill notes call forth the springing morn;</L>
<L>No watchful dogs the secret entry keep,</L>
<L>Nor geese more watchful guard the court of Sleep;</L>
<L>No tame nor savage beast dwells there, no breeze</L>
<L>Shakes the still boughs, or whispers through the trees;</L>
<L>No voice of man is heard, no human call</L>
<L>Sounds through the cave; deep silence reigns o'er all.</L>
<L>Yet from the rock a silver spring flows down,</L>
<L>Which, purling o'er the stones, glides gently on;</L>
<L>Her easy streams with pleasing murmurs creep,</L>
<L>At once inviting and assisting Sleep.</L>
<L>At the cave's mouth spring pregnant poppies up,</L>
<L>And hide the entrance with their baleful top;</L>
<L>Whose drowsy juice affords the nightly birth</L>
<L>Of all the Sleep diffus'd and shed on earth.</L>
<L>No guards the passage to this court secure,</L>
<L>No jarring hinge sustains a creaking door:</L>
<L>Yet in the midst, with fable coverings spread,</L>
<L>High, but unshaken, stands a downy bed.</L>
<L>Where his soft limbs the slothful Monarch lays,</L>
<L>Dissolv'd in endless luxury and ease.</L>
<L><PB N="301" REF="304"/>Fantastic dreams lie scatter'd on the ground,</L>
<L>And compass him in various figures round;</L>
<L>More numerous than the sands that bind the seas,</L>
<L>Or ears of standing corn, or leaves on trees.</L>
<L>But Iris, now arriv'd, divinely bright;</L>
<L>Fills all the palace with unusual light.</L>
<L>Her garments, flowing with diffusive beams,</L>
<L>Gild the dark cell, and chace the frighted Dreams:</L>
<L>Away they fly, to leave her passage clear,</L>
<L>And shun the glories which they cannot bear.</L>
<L>The God, his eye-lids struggling to unloose,</L>
<L>Seal'd by his deep unbroken slumbers close,</L>
<L>Half way his head uprears with sluggish pain,</L>
<L>Which heavily anon sinks down again.</L>
<L>Frequent attempts without success he makes,</L>
<L>But, at the last, with long endeavour, wakes.</L>
<L>Half rais'd, and half reclining in his bed,</L>
<L>And leaning on his hands his nodding head,</L>
<L>With faultering words, he asks the heavenly fair,</L>
<L>What message from her Goddess brought her there?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At once the God and Goddess she obeys,</L>
<L>Delivering her commands in words like these:</L>
<L>" Thou Peace of mind, thou most propitious Power,</L>
<L>Thou meekest Deity that men adore!</L>
<L>Thou, who giv'st ease to every troubled breast,</L>
<L>And set'st tir'd limbs and feverish souls at rest!</L>
<L>Thou, at whose presence cares and sorrows flee,</L>
<L>Under whose guard the fetter'd slave is free,</L>
<L>Lovers, the worst of slaves, still finding ease in thee!</L>
<L><PB N="302" REF="305"/>Send thou a Dream, assuming Ceyx' form,</L>
<L>Like him appearing shipwreck'd in a storm;</L>
<L>From whose pale lips his widow'd queen may know</L>
<L>His certain loss, and her as certain woe."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here ends the shining Nymph, who dares not stay</L>
<L>For farther words, but flies in haste away.</L>
<L>She feels the thickening mists begin to rise,</L>
<L>And conquering Sleep steal o'er her yielding eyes.</L>
<L>Thence by her painted bow her course she bends,</L>
<L>And the same way she came again aseends.</L>
<L>Around his drowsy offspring goes the God,</L>
<L>And chuses Morpheus from among the crowd.</L>
<L>None can like him a perfect man express,</L>
<L>His speech and mien, his a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion and his dress:</L>
<L>For he alone in human shape appears;</L>
<L>While the less noble forms a second wears,</L>
<L>Of snakes, or birds, of lions, or of bears.</L>
<L>Still there's a third, still meaner in degree,</L>
<L>Which shews a field, a river, or a tree;</L>
<L>Of things inanimate presents the scene,</L>
<L>Hills, valleys, ships or houses, earth or main.</L>
<L>These three to generals, kings, or courts belong;</L>
<L>More vulgar Dreams wait the more vulgar throng.</L>
<L>The f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rst of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se their monarch sets at large,</L>
<L>Dispatch'd to Trach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, on Thaumantia's charge;</L>
<L>Then staggering he returns, and seeks his bed,</L>
<L>In whose soft down he sinks his drooping head;</L>
<L>Again, his eye-lids are with sleep opprest,</L>
<L>And the whole God dissolves again to rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="303" REF="306"/>
<L>Swift as a thought, and secret as the night,</L>
<L>Morpheus on noiseless pinions takes his flight;</L>
<L>His sleeting wings their silent course pursue,</L>
<L>Soft as the liquid air they travel'd through;</L>
<L>Who, now arriv'd, lays-by his useless plumes,</L>
<L>And Ceyx' form in his own court assumes:</L>
<L>Naked he stood, as late bereav'd of life,</L>
<L>Close by the bed of his unhappy wife;</L>
<L>His hair still dropping seem'd, still wet his beard,</L>
<L>Still shivering with the cold all his pale frame appear'd;</L>
<L>When, with a mournful gesture, o'er the bed</L>
<L>Pensively hanging his dejected head,</L>
<L>All drown'd in well-dissembling tears, he said:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Is not your Ceyx, wretched woman, known?</L>
<L>Is he so alter'd, or forgot so soon?</L>
<L>Turn here, Halcyone, behold him lost,</L>
<L>Or, in your Ceyx' stead, behold his ghost.</L>
<L>To the relentless Gods in vain you pray'd,</L>
<L>You are deceiv'd, alas! and I am dead.</L>
<L>Surpriz'd by storms in the Aegean sea,</L>
<L>Which cast my life and all my hopes away;</L>
<L>Where, as I call'd on thy lov'd name, my breath,</L>
<L>With half thy name pronounc'd, was stopt in death.</L>
<L>This from no doubtful messenger you hear,</L>
<L>'Tis I who tell it, I who perish'd there.</L>
<L>Arise and weep, now let your eyes run o'er,</L>
<L>Your once-lov'd Ceyx is, alas! no more!</L>
<L>Let a few tears be to my memory paid,</L>
<L>And, as you lov'd me living, mourn she dead."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="304" REF="307"/>
<L>He speaks, and adds to these his doleful words</L>
<L>A voice, she too well knew, express'd her lord's.</L>
<L>The same the gesture of his hands appears,</L>
<L>Unforc'd his action, and unfeign'd his tears.</L>
<L>She, frighted with the vision, sighs and weeps,</L>
<L>Torn with most mortal anguish as she sleeps;</L>
<L>Then stretches out her arms to hold him there,</L>
<L>Which came back empty through the yielding air.</L>
<L>" Stay, stay, she cries, ah! whither would you now?</L>
<L>We 'll go together, if again you go."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With her own voice, and her dead husband's sight,</L>
<L>Starting, she leaves her dream, but not her fright.</L>
<L>Awak'd, she turns her fearful eyes around,</L>
<L>And looks for him who could no more be found.</L>
<L>For now her maids, rais'd with her shrieks, were come,</L>
<L>And with their lamps enlighten'd all the room.</L>
<L>Not seeing what she sought, enrag'd, she tare</L>
<L>At once her face, her habit, and her hair.</L>
<L>When ask'd the cause whence such despair should spring,</L>
<L>And what sad loss could such distraction bring;</L>
<L>She wrings her hands, and beats her panting breast,</L>
<L>Long silent, with a load of sorrow prest,</L>
<L>But thus, at last, her cruel loss confest:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" There's no Halcyone, ah! none, she cry'd;</L>
<L>With Ceyx, dearer than herself, she died.</L>
<L>Now let no sounds of comfort reach my car,</L>
<L>All mention of a future hope forbear,</L>
<L>Leave me, oh! leave me to my just despair.</L>
<L>Ah! these, these eyes, my shipwreck'd lord did see</L>
<L>And knew too well it could be none but he.</L>
<L><PB N="305" REF="308"/>These hands I stretch'd, in hopes to make him stay,</L>
<L>But from these hands he slid unfelt away;</L>
<L>No mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tal grasp could hold his fleeting ghost,</L>
<L>And I a second time my Ceyx lost.</L>
<L>He look'd not with the same majestic grace</L>
<L>As when he liv'd, nor shone his awful face</L>
<L>With the peculiar glories of his heavenly race.</L>
<L>His eyes were fix'd, and all their fires gone out,</L>
<L>No longer roll'd their sparkling beams about;</L>
<L>The colour from his faded cheek was fled,</L>
<L>And all his beauty with himself lay dead,</L>
<L>Retaining nought of all, except the shade;</L>
<L>Retaining still, though all the rest was gone,</L>
<L>Too much, alas! to make his shadow known.</L>
<L>Pale, wan, and meagre, by the bed he stood,</L>
<L>His hair still dropping with the briny flood.</L>
<L>Here, here in this, ah! this unhappy place,</L>
<L>'Twas here he stood"—she cry'd, and sought to trace,</L>
<L>But found no footsteps of his airy pace.—</L>
<L>" Oh! this my too presaging soul divin'd,</L>
<L>When you forsook me to pursue the wind.</L>
<L>But, since compell'd by rigorous Fate you went,</L>
<L>And this was destin'd for the sad event;</L>
<L>Oh! that together we had put to sea,</L>
<L>That so with you it might have swallow'd me!</L>
<L>Absent, I'm lost; and ah! though not with you,</L>
<L>Yet am I wreck'd, yet am I ruin'd too.</L>
<L>Oh! I were sprung from a most savage kind,</L>
<L>My soul as barbarous as the seas or wind,</L>
<L>If I, now you are gone, should wish to stay behind.</L>
<L><PB N="306" REF="309"/>No, Ceyx, no; my much-lov'd lord, I come;</L>
<L>And though not laid together in a tomb,</L>
<L>Though far from mine your floating corse is borne,</L>
<L>Nor with my ashes mingled in an urn;</L>
<L>Yet on one marble shall our names be told,</L>
<L>And the same stone shall both our stories hold,</L>
<L>Where ages yet unborn with praise shall read</L>
<L>How I disdain'd to live when you were dead."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here, choak'd with grief, she the sad tale gave o'er,</L>
<L>Her swelling sorrows would permit no more;</L>
<L>Sobs, mingling with her words, their accents part,</L>
<L>And sighs fly faster from her throbbing heart.</L>
<L>Now dawns the day, when she with fearful haste</L>
<L>Goes to that shore where she had seen him last.</L>
<L>There while she stood, reflecting on her loss,</L>
<L>Forgetting nought that might augment her woes.</L>
<L>" Here he took leave, she cry'd; and here, she said,</L>
<L>Unwilling to be gone, again he staid;</L>
<L>He gave me here, alas! the last embrace;</L>
<L>Then launch'd from this, ah! this unhappy place."</L>
<L>While all that past she labour'd to recall,</L>
<L>Severely for herself remembering all;</L>
<L>And, while around her watery eyes survey</L>
<L>The wave-beat coast and the still-troubled sea,</L>
<L>Something she spies from far come floating on,</L>
<L>Though at the first too distant to be known;</L>
<L>Which, as the tide drove nearer to the coast,</L>
<L>Presents a man in a late shipwreck lost.</L>
<L>She pities him, whom yet she does not know,</L>
<L>And mourns his fate, since Ceyx perish'd so;</L>
<L><PB N="307" REF="310"/>Pities his wife, if he a wife had left,</L>
<L>Like her of all she reckon'd dear bereft.</L>
<L>Now floating nearer to the fatal shore,</L>
<L>She eyes him more distinctly than before,</L>
<L>While all her hopes diminish, all her fears grow more.</L>
<L>Apace her beating heart begins to pant,</L>
<L>And all at once her sinking spirits faint.</L>
<L>Now on the beach by tossing billows thrown,</L>
<L>The corse was to her sad confusion known,</L>
<L>Herself the wife she mourn'd, the man her own.</L>
<L>" 'Tis he, she cry'd, my dear, my shipwreck'd lord,</L>
<L>Whom I but too, too justly, have deplor'd!"</L>
<L>Then, with her hands stretch'd to him where he lay,</L>
<L>She said what grief would give her leave to say:</L>
<L>" Fed with false hopes, have I your absence borne!</L>
<L>And is it thus, ah! thus, that you return?</L>
<L>And do I live, and you bereav'd of life?</L>
<L>Ah! wretched man, but more, more wretched wife!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far in the sea a pier erected stood,</L>
<L>To break the rapid fury of the flood.</L>
<L>Thither (almost beyond belief) she springs,</L>
<L>Borne through the yielding air on new-grown wings;</L>
<L>Along the surface of the sea she flies,</L>
<L>And wonders at her own unusual cries;</L>
<L>Now, hovering o'er his pale and bloodless corse,</L>

<L>Now, stooping, perches on his watery face,</L>

<L><PB N="308" REF="311"/>Yet he took sense from her transporting touch</L>
<L>(Ev'n on the dead the force of love is such).</L>

<L>Seven days she sits upon her floating nest,</L>
<L>While each rude blast, imprison'd and supprest</L>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND;</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. JOHN HOPKINS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Another son of the good bishop of Londonderry; born Jan. 1, 1675. Like his elder brother, his poetry was princi∣pally on subjects of Love; like him too, his prospects in life appear to have terminated unfortunately. He published in 1698
"The Triumphs of Peace, or the Glories of Nassau; a pindarie poem occasioned by the conclusion of the peace between the Confederacy and France; written at the time of his grace the duke of Ormond's entrance into Dublin."
<Q REND="inline">"The design of this poem, the author says in his preface, begins, after the method of Pindar, to one great man, and rises to another; first touches the duke, then celebrates the actions of the king, and so returns to the praises of the duke again."</Q>—But the principal performance of Mr. J. Hopkins was
"Amasia, or the Works of the Muses, a collection of poems in three volumes, 1700."
Each of these little vo∣lumes is divided into three books, and each book is inscribed to some beautiful patroness; amongst whom the dutchess of Grafton stands foremost. The last book is inscribed
"To the memory of Amasia," whom he addresses throughout these volumes in the character of Sylvius.
There is a vein of seriousness, if not of poetry, runs through the whole perform∣ance. Many of Ovid's stories are very decently imitated; <Q REND="inline">"most of them, he says, have been very well performed by my brother, and published some years since; mine were written in another kingdom before I knew of his."</Q> In one of his dedi∣cations he tells the lady Olimpia Robartes, <Q REND="inline">"Your ladyship's father, the late earl of Radnor, when governor of Ireland, was the kind patron to mine: he raised him to the first steps by which he afterwards ascended to the dignities he bore; to those, which rendered his labours more conspi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uous, and set in a more advantageous light those living merits, which now make his memory beloved. These, and yet greater temporal honours, your family heaped on him, by making even me in some sort related and allied to you, by his inter-marriage with your sister the lady Araminta. How imprudent a vanity is it in me to boast a father so meritorious! how may I be ashamed to prove myself his son, by poetry, that only qualification he so much excelled in, but yet esteemed no excellence. I bring but a bad proof of birth, laying my claim in that only thing he would not own. These are, however, Madam, but the products of immaturer years; and riper age may, I hope, bring forth more solid works."</Q>—I have never seen any other of his writings; nor have been able to collect any farther particulars of his life, but have a portrait of him under his poetical name of Sylvius.

<HEAD>SONG,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY LORD CUTTS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A soldier of most hardy bravery in king William's wars. He was son of Richard Cutts, esq. of Matching in Essex, where the family were settled about the time of Henry the sixth, and had a great estate. He entered early into the ser∣vice of the duke of Monmouth, was aid-de-camp to the Duke of Lorrain in Hungary, and signalized himself in a very extraordinary manner at the taking of Buda by the Im∣perialists in 1686; which important place had been for near a century and a half in the hands of the Turks. Mr. Ad∣dison, in a Latin poem worthy of the Augustan age, (Musae Anglicanae, Vol. II. p. 2,) plainly hints at Mr. Cutts's dis∣tinguished bravery at that siege. Returning to England at the Revolution, he had a regiment of foot; was created Baron of Gowran in Ireland, Dec. 6, 1699; appointed Governor of the Isle of Wight, April 14, 1693; was made a Major-ge∣neral; and, when the assassination project was discovered, 1695-6, was captain of the King's guard. He was Colonel of the Coldstream, or second regiment of guards, in 1701; when Mr. Steele, who was indebted to his interest for a mili∣tary commission, inscribed to him his first work,
"The Christian Hero."
On the Accession of Queen Anne, he was made a Lieutenant-general of the forces in Holland; Commander in Chief of the forces in Ireland, under the Duke of Ormond, March 23, 1704-5; and afterwards one of the Lords Justices of that kingdom, to keep him out of the way of action, a circumstance which broke his heart. He died at Dublin, Jan. 26, 1706-7, and is buried there in the cathedral of Christ Church. He wrote a poem on the Death of Q. Mary (which is printed among the Court Poems); and published, in 1687, "Poetical Exercises, written upon several occasions, and dedicated to her royal highness Mary princess of Orange; licensed March 23, 1686-7, Roger L'Estrange." It contains, besides the dedi∣cation signed J. Cutts, verses to that princess; a poem on wisdom, another to Mr Waller on his commending it; seven more copies of verses (one of them called
"La Muse Cava∣lier,"
which has been ascribed to Lord Peterborough, and as such mentioned by Mr. Walpole in the list of that nobleman's writings) and eleven songs; the whole composing but a very thin volume; which is by no means so scarce as Mr. Wal∣pole supposes it to be. The author speaks of having more pieces by him. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>ELEGY ON THE EARL OF ROCHESTER.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MRS. WHARTON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See some particular of this lady, vol. I. p. 51. And see, in the English Poets, vol. VIII. p. 183, Mr. Waller's verses on the Elegy here printed; and in p. 229, another copy on Mrs. Wharton's "Paraphrase on the Lord's Prayer." His two cantos of Divine Poesy, p. 223, were "occasioned upon sight of the 53d chapter of Isaiah, turned into verse "by Mrs. Wharton." Her "Verses to Mr. Waller" are mentioned by Ballard; and her translation of "Penelope to Ulysses" is printed in Tonson's edition of Ovid's Epistles. In 1681, she was in France on account of her health, as appears from several letters to her husband; about 1682, she held a correspondence by letters with Dr. Gilbert Burnet, many of which are made public. Dr. Burnet wrote several poems, which he sent her. She died at Adderbury, Oct. 29, 1685; and was buried at Winchenden. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<L>DEEP waters silent roll; so grief like mine</L>
<L>Tears never can relieve, nor words define.</L>
<L>Stop then, stop your vain source, weak springs of grief,</L>
<L>Let tears flow from their eyes whom tears relieve.</L>
<L>They from their heads shew the light trouble there,</L>
<L>Could my heart weep, its sorrows 'twould declare:</L>
<L>When drops of blood, my heart, thou'st lost; thy pride,</L>
<L>The cause of all thy hopes and fears, thy guide!</L>
<L>He would have led thee right in Wisdom's way,</L>
<L>And 'twas thy fault whene'er thou went'st astray:</L>
<L>And since thou stray'd'st when guided and led on,</L>
<L>Thou wilt be surely lost now left alone.</L>
<L>It is thy Elegy I write, not his;</L>
<L>He lives immortal and in highest bliss.</L>

<L>He lives, that lovely soul for ever fled,</L>
<L>But thou 'mongst crowds on earth art buried.</L>
<L>Great was thy loss, which thou canst ne'er express,</L>
<L>Nor was th' insensible dull nation's less;</L>
<L>He civiliz'd the rude, and taught the young,</L>
<L>Made fools grow wise; such artful magic hung</L>
<L>Upon his useful kind instructing tongue.</L>
<L>His lively wit was of himself a part,</L>
<L>Not, as in other men, the work of art;</L>
<L>For, though his learning like his wit was great,</L>
<L>Yet sure all learning came below his wit;</L>
<L>As God's immediate gifts are better far</L>
<L>Than those we borrow from our likeness here,</L>
<L>He was—but I want words, and ne'er can tell,</L>
<L>Yet this I know, he did mankind excell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He was what no man ever was before,</L>
<L>Nor can indulgent nature give us more,</L>
<L>For, to make him, she exhausted all her store.</L>

<HEAD>AGAINST THE FEAR OF DEATH.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY SIR ROBERT HOWARD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of whom, see vol. I. p. 154. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>SINCE all must certainly to death resign,</L>
<L>Why should we make it dreadful, or repine?</L>
<L>How vain is fear, where nothing can prevent</L>
<L>The loss, which he that loses can't lament?</L>
<L>The fear of Death is by our folly brought,</L>
<L>We fly th' acquaintance of it in a thought;</L>
<L>From something into nothing is a change</L>
<L>Grown terrible, by making it so strange.</L>
<L><PB N="331" REF="334"/>We always should remember, Death is sure;</L>
<L>What grows familiar most, we best endure:</L>
<L>For life and death succeed like night and day,</L>
<L>And neither gives increase, nor brings decay.</L>
<L>No more or less by what takes birth or dies,</L>
<L>And the same mass the teeming world supplies.</L>
<L>From death we rose to life; 'tis but the same,</L>
<L>Through life again to pass from whence we came.</L>
<L>With shame we see our passions can prevail,</L>
<L>Where reason, certainty, and virtue fail.</L>
<L>Honour, that empty name, can death despise,</L>
<L>Scorn'd Love to Death as to a refuge flies,</L>
<L>And sorrow waits for death with longing eyes.</L>
<L>Hope triumphs o'er the thought of Death and Fate,</L>
<L>Cheats fools, and flatters the unfortunate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps, deceiv'd by lust-supplying wealth,</L>
<L>Now-enjoy'd pleasures, and a present health,</L>
<L>We fear to lose what a small time must waste,</L>
<L>Till life itself grows the disease at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast:</L>
<L>Begging for life, we beg for more decay,</L>
<L>And to be long a dying only pray.</L>
</LG>

<L>No just and temperate thought can tell us why</L>
<L>We should fear death, or grieve for them that die;</L>
<L>The time we leave behind is ours no more,</L>
<L>Nor our concern, than time that was before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twere a fond sight, if those that stay behind</L>
<L>For the same passage, waiting for a wind</L>
<L>To drive them to their port; should on the shore</L>
<L>Lamenting stand, for those that went before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We all must pass through Death's dead sea of night,</L>
<L>To reach the haven of eternal light.</L>

<L>IN grey-hair'd Celia's wither'd arms</L>
<L>As mighty Lewis lay,</L>
<L>She cry'd, "If I have any charms,</L>

<L>For you, my love, is all my fear,</L>
<L>Hark how the drums do rattle;</L>
<L>Alas, sir! what should you do here</L>
<L>In dreadful day of battle?</L>
<L>Let little Orange stay and fight,</L>
<L>For danger's his diversion;</L>
<L>The wise will think you in the right,</L>
<L>Not to expose your person:</L>
<L>Nor vex your thoughts how to repair</L>
<L>The ruins of your glory:</L>
<L>You ought to leave so mean a care</L>
<L>To those who pen your story.</L>
<L>Are not Boileau and Corneille paid</L>
<L>For panegyric writing?</L>
<L>They know how heroes may be made</L>
<L>Without the help of fighting.</L>
<L>When foes too saucily approach</L>
<L>'Tis best to leave them fairly;</L>
<L>Put six good horses in your coach,</L>
<L>And carry me to Marly.</L>
