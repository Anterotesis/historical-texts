<HEAD>A PROSPECT of SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ONE sink of level avarice shall lie,</L>
<L>And even the worth of kings unhonor'd die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet think not, thus when freedom's isles I state,</L>
<L>I mean to flatter kings, or court the great;</L>
<L>Think not I mean to sap my country's good;</L>
<L>I would not, heaven be witness! if I could.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="2"/>
But when I see contention hem the throne,</L>
<L>A bridging kingly power to stretch her own,</L>
<L>When I behold a factious band agree</L>
<L>To call it freedom, when themselves are free;</L>
<L>Senates in blood the code of justic draw,</L>
<L>Laws grind the poor, and opulence the law;</L>
<L>The wealth of climes, where savage nations roam,</L>
<L>Pillag'd from slaves, to purchase slaves at home;</L>
<L>I can't forbear, but all my passions start</L>
<L>To tear the barb that grides my swelling heart;</L>
<L>I can't forbear: but, half a coward grown,</L>
<L>I wish to shrink from tyrants to the throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yes, my lov'd brother, cursed be that hour</L>
<L>When first ambition toil'd for foreign power;</L>
<L>When Britons learnt to swell beyond their shore,</L>
<L>And barter useful men for useless ore,</L>
<L>To shine with splendors that destruction haste,</L>
<L>Like flaring tapers brightening as they waste.</L>
<L>Have we not seen, at pleasure's lordly call,</L>
<L>An hundred villages in ruin fall?</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="3"/>
Beheld the duteous son, the sire decay'd,</L>
<L>The modest matron, and the blushing maid,</L>
<L>Forc'd from their homes, a melancholy train,</L>
<L>To traverse climes beyond the western main;</L>
<L>Where wild Oswego spreads her swamps around,</L>
<L>And Niagara stuns with thund'ring sound?</L>
<L>Even now, perhaps, as there some pilgrim strays</L>
<L>Through tangling sorests, and through dangerous ways;</L>
<L>Through woods, where beasts divided empire claim,</L>
<L>And the brown Indian takes a deadly aim;</L>
<L>There, while above the forceful tempest flies,</L>
<L>And all around distressful yellings rise,</L>
<L>The famish'd exile bends beneath his woe,</L>
<L>And faintly fainter, fainter seems to go;</L>
<L>Casts a fond look where Britain's shores recline,</L>
<L>And gives his griefs to sympathize with mine.</L>
<L>War in each breast, and freedom on each brow;</L>
<L>How much unlike the sons of Britain now!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Flush'd at the sound, my genius spreads her wing,</L>
<L>And flies where Britain broods the western spring;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4"/>
Where lawns extend that spurn Arcadian pride,</L>
<L>And brighter streams than fam'd Campaspe glide,</L>
<L>There all around the gentlest breezes stray,</L>
<L>There gentle music melts on every spray;</L>
<L>Creation's mildest charms are there combin'd,</L>
<L>Extremes are only in the master's mind;</L>
<L>Stern o'er each bosom reason holds her state.</L>
<L>With daring aims, irregularly great,</L>
<L>I see the lords of mankind pass me by</L>
<L>With haughty port, defiance in their eye,</L>
<L>Intent on high designs, a thoughtful band,</L>
<L>By forms unfashion'd fresh from Nature's hand;</L>
<L>Fierce in a native hardihood of soul,</L>
<L>True to imagin'd right whate'er controul,</L>
<L>While even the peasant boasts these rights to scan,</L>
<L>And learns to venerate himself as man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thine, Freedom, thine the blessings pictur'd here,</L>
<L>Thine are those charms that dazzle and endear;</L>
<L>Happy indeed, were such without alloy,</L>
<L>But even from Freedom issuing ills annoy:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="5"/>
That independence Britons prize too high,</L>
<L>Keeps man from man, and cuts the social tie;</L>
<L>There, though by circling deeps together held,</L>
<L>Minds combat minds, repelling and repell'd;</L>
<L>Ferments arise, imprison'd factions roar,</L>
<L>Represt ambition struggles round her shore,</L>
<L>Whilst over-wrought, the general system feels</L>
<L>Its motions stopt, or phrenzy fire the wheels.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor rest their ills. As social bonds decay,</L>
<L>As duty, love, and honour fail to sway,</L>
<L>Fictitious bonds, the bonds of wealth and law,</L>
<L>Still gather strength, and force unwilling awe.</L>
<L>Hence all distinction's paid to these alone,</L>
<L>Talent must sink, and merit weep unknown;</L>
<L>Till Time may come, when, stript of all her charms,</L>
<L>That land of scholars, and that nurse of arms;</L>
<L>Where ancestry avows the noble claim,</L>
<L>And statesmen toil, and poets pant for fame;</L>
<L>To men of other minds my fancy flies,</L>
<L>Embosom'd in the deep where Holland lies,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6"/>
Methinks her patient sons before me stand,</L>
<L>Where the broad ocean leans against the land,</L>
<L>And, sedulous to stop the coming tide,</L>
<L>Lift the tall rampire's artificial pride,</L>
<L>That spreads its arms amidst the swelling main,</L>
<L>And scoops an empire from the watry reign.</L>
<L>Onward methinks, and diligently slow</L>
<L>The firm connected bulwark seems to go;</L>
<L>While ocean pent, and rising o'er the pile,</L>
<L>Sees an amphibious world beneath him smile.</L>
<L>The slow canal, the yellow blossom'd vale,</L>
<L>The willow tufted bank▪ the gliding sail,</L>
<L>Plains, forests, town<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in gay profusion drest,</L>
<L>A new creation ravish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from his breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, while around the wave-subjected soil</L>
<L>Impels the native to repeated toil,</L>
<L>Industrious habits in each breast obtain,</L>
<L>And industry begets a love of gain.</L>
<L>Hence all the good from opulence that springs,</L>
<L>With all those ills superfluous treasure brings,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="7"/>
Are here display'd. Their much-lov'd wealth imparts</L>
<L>Convenience, plenty, elegance, and arts;</L>
<L>But turn the medal, craft and fraud appear,</L>
<L>Even liberty itself is barter'd here.</L>
<L>At gold's superior charms all freedom flies,</L>
<L>The needy sell it, and the rich man buys:</L>
<L>A land of tyrants, and a den of slaves,</L>
<L>Here wretches seek dishonourable graves,</L>
<L>And calm beneath their injuries conform,</L>
<L>Dull as their lakes, quiescent in a storm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Heavens! how unlike their Belgic sires of old!</L>
<L>Rough, poor, content, ungovernably bold;</L>
<L>Where shading elms beside the margin grew,</L>
<L>And freshen'd from the waves the Zephyr blew;</L>
<L>And haply, tho' my harsh touch faltering still,</L>
<L>But mock'd all tune, and marr'd the dancer's skill;</L>
<L>Yet would the village praise my wond'rous power,</L>
<L>And dance, forgetful of the noon-tide hour.</L>
<L>Alike all ages. Dames of ancient days</L>
<L>Have led their children through the mirthful maze,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="8"/>
And the gay grandsire, skill'd in gestic lore,</L>
<L>Has frisk'd beneath the burthen of threescore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So blest a life these thoughtless realms display,</L>
<L>Thus idly strenuous rolls their world away:</L>
<L>Theirs are those arts that mind to mind endear,</L>
<L>For honour forms the social temper here.</L>
<L>Honour, that praise which real merit gains,</L>
<L>Or even imaginary worth obtains,</L>
<L>Here passes current; paid from hand to hand,</L>
<L>It shifts its splendid traffic round the land:</L>
<L>From courts to camps, to cottages it strays,</L>
<L>And all are taught an avarice of praise;</L>
<L>They please, are pleas'd, they give to get esteem,</L>
<L>Till, seeming blest, they grow to what they seem.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But while this softer art their bliss supplies,</L>
<L>It gives their follies also room to rise;</L>
<L>For praise too dearly lov'd, or warmly sought,</L>
<L>Enfeebles all internal strength of thought,</L>
<L>And the weak soul, within itself unblest,</L>
<L>Leans for all pleasure on another's breast.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="9"/>
Hence ostentation here, with tawdry art,</L>
<L>Pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart;</L>
<L>Here vanity assumes the pert grimace,</L>
<L>And trims her robes of frize with copper lace,</L>
<L>Here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer,</L>
<L>To boast one splendid dish for once a year;</L>
<L>And scarce a man is found, who rightly weighs</L>
<L>The solid transports of internal praise.</L>
<L>These are the charms to barren states assign'd;</L>
<L>Their wants are few, their wishes all confin'd.</L>
<L>Yet let them only share the praises due,</L>
<L>If few their wants, their pleasures are but few;</L>
<L>Since every want, that stimulates the breast,</L>
<L>Becomes a means of pleasure when possest.</L>
<L>Hence from such lands each pleasing science flies,</L>
<L>That first excites desire, and then supplies;</L>
<L>Unknown to them, when sensual pleasures cloy,</L>
<L>To fill the languid pause with finer joy;</L>
<L>Unknown those powers that raise the soul to flame,</L>
<L>Catch every nerve, and vibrate through the frame.</L>
<L>Their level life is but a smould'ring fire,</L>
<L>Nor quench'd by want, nor fan'd by strong desire;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="10"/>
Unfit for raptures, or, if raptures cheer,</L>
<L>On some high festival of once a year,</L>
<L>In wild excess the vulgar breast takes fire,</L>
<L>Till, buried in debauch, the bliss expire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But not their joys alone thus coarsly flow:</L>
<L>Their morals, like their pleasures, are but low.</L>
<L>For, as refinement stops, from sire to son</L>
<L>Manners in one unmending track will run,</L>
<L>And love and friendship's finely pointed dart</L>
<L>Fall blunted from each indurated heart,</L>
<L>Some sterner virtues o'er the mountain's breast</L>
<L>May sit, like falcons cow'ring on the nest;</L>
<L>But all the gentler morals, such as play</L>
<L>Through life's more cultur'd walks, and charm our way,</L>
<L>These far disperse, on timorous pinions fly,</L>
<L>To sport and flutter in a kinder sky.</L>
<L>To kinder skies, where gentler manners reign,</L>
<L>We turn, where France displays her bright domain.</L>
<L>Thou sprightly land of mirth and social ease,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with thyself, whom all the world can please,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="11"/>
How often have I led thy sportive choir,</L>
<L>With tuneless pipe, along the sliding Loire?</L>
<L>No vernal bloom their torpid rocks display,</L>
<L>But winter lingering chills the lap of May;</L>
<L>No Zephyr fondly sooths the mountain's breast,</L>
<L>But meteors glare, and frowning storms invest.</L>
<L>Yet still, even here, content can spread a charm,</L>
<L>Redress the clime, and all its rage disarm.</L>
<L>Though poor the peasant's hut, his feasts though small,</L>
<L>He sees his little lot, the lot of all;</L>
<L>See no contiguous palace rear its head</L>
<L>To shame the meanness of his humble shed;</L>
<L>No costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal</L>
<L>To make him loath his vegetable meal;</L>
<L>But calm, and bred in ignorance and toil,</L>
<L>Each wish contracting, fits him to the soil.</L>
<L>Chearful at morn he wakes from short repose,</L>
<L>Breasts the keen air, and carrols as he goes;</L>
<L>With patient angle trolls the finny deep,</L>
<L>Or drives his vent'rous plow-share to the steep;</L>
<L>Or seeks the den where snow tracks mark the way,</L>
<L>And drags the struggling savage into day.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="12"/>
At night returning, every labour sped,</L>
<L>He sits him down the monarch of a shed;</L>
<L>Smiles by his chearful fire, and round surveys</L>
<L>His childrens looks, that brighten at the blaze:</L>
<L>While his lov'd partner, boastful of her hoard,</L>
<L>Displays the cleanly platter on the board;</L>
<L>And haply too some pilgrim, thither led,</L>
<L>With many a tale repays the nightly bed.</L>
<L>Thus every good his native wilds impart,</L>
<L>Imprints the patriot passion at his heart.</L>
<L>Dear in that shed to which his soul conforms,</L>
<L>And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms;</L>
<L>And as a babe, when scaring sounds molest,</L>
<L>Clings close and closer to the mother's breast;</L>
<L>So the loud torrent, and the whirlwind's roar,</L>
<L>But bind him to his native mountains more.</L>
<L>For wealth was theirs, nor far remov'd the date,</L>
<L>When commerce proudly flourish'd through the state:</L>
<L>At her command the palace learnt to rise,</L>
<L>Again the long-fall'n column sought the skies;</L>
<L>The canvass glow'd with animation warm,</L>
<L>The pregnant quarry teem'd with human form.</L>
<L><PB REF="13"/>
But, more unstable than the southern gale,</L>
<L>Soon Commerce turn'd on other shores her sail;</L>
<L>And late the nation sound, with fruitless skill,</L>
<L>Their former strength was now plethoric ill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, though to fortune lost, there still abide</L>
<L>Some splendid arts, the wrecks of former pride;</L>
<L>From which the seeble heart and long fall'n mind</L>
<L>An easy compensation seems to find.</L>
<L>Here may be seen, in bloodless pomp array'd,</L>
<L>The paste-board triumph and the cavalcade;</L>
<L>Processions form'd for piety and love,</L>
<L>A mistress or a saint in every grove.</L>
<L>At sports like these are all their cares beguil'd,</L>
<L>The sports of children satisfy the child;</L>
<L>At sports like these, while foreign arms advance,</L>
<L>They proudly swell, and leave the world to chance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When strenuous aims have suffer'd long controul,</L>
<L>They leave at last, or feebly man the soul;</L>
<L>While low delights, succeeding fast behind,</L>
<L>In happier meanness occupy the mind:</L>
<L><PB REF="14"/>
As in those domes, where Caesars once bore sway,</L>
<L>But now by time dismantled in decay,</L>
<L>Amidst the ruin, heedless of the dead,</L>
<L>The shelter-seeking peasant builds his shed,</L>
<L>And, wond'ring man could want the larger pile,</L>
<L>Exults, and owns his cottage with a smile.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My soul turn from them, turn we to survey</L>
<L>Where rougher climes a nobler race display,</L>
<L>Where the bleak Swiss their stormy mansions tread,</L>
<L>And force a churlish soil for scanty bread;</L>
<L>No product here the barren hills afford,</L>
<L>But man and steel, the soldier and his sword.</L>
<L>Far to the right, where Appenine ascends,</L>
<L>Bright as the summer, Italy extends;</L>
<L>Her uplands sloping deck the mountain's side,</L>
<L>Woods over woods, in gay theatric pride;</L>
<L>While oft some temples mould'ring tops between,</L>
<L>With venerable grandeur marks the scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Could Nature's bounty satisfy the breast,</L>
<L>The sons of Italy were surely blest.</L>
<L><PB REF="15"/>
Whatever fruits in different climes are found,</L>
<L>That proudly rise or humbly court the ground,</L>
<L>Whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear,</L>
<L>That dress in bright succession round the year;</L>
<L>Whatever sweets salute the northern sky</L>
<L>With vernal leaves that blossom but to die;</L>
<L>These here disporting, own the kindred soil,</L>
<L>Nor ask luxuriance from the planter's toil;</L>
<L>While sea-borne gales their gelid wings expand</L>
<L>To winnow fragrance round the smiling land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But small the bliss that sense alone bestows,</L>
<L>And sensual bliss is all the nation knows.</L>
<L>In rich luxuriance plants and flowers appear,</L>
<L>Men seem the only growth that dwindles here.</L>
<L>Contrasted faults through all their manners reign,</L>
<L>Though poor, luxurious, though submissive, vain,</L>
<L>Though grave, yet trifling, zealous, yet untrue,</L>
<L>And even in penance planning sins anew.</L>
<L>All ills are here to pejorate the mind,</L>
<L>That opulence departed leaves behind;</L>
<L><PB REF="16"/>
Nor less the patriot's boast, where'er we roam,</L>
<L>His first best country ever is at home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet, perhaps, if states with states we scan,</L>
<L>Or estimate their bliss on Reason's plan,</L>
<L>Though patriots flatter, and though fools contend,</L>
<L>We still shall find the doubtful scale depend;</L>
<L>Find that each good, by Art or Nature given,</L>
<L>To these or those, but makes the balance even.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nature, a mother kind alike to all,</L>
<L>Still grants her blessings at Industry's call;</L>
<L>And though the rigid clime or rough rocks frown,</L>
<L>These rocks, by custom, turn to beds of down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From Art more various are the blessings sent;</L>
<L>Wealth, splendours, freedom, honor, and content:</L>
<L>Yet these each other's power so strong contest,</L>
<L>That either seems subversive of the rest.</L>
<L>Hence e'ery state, to one lov'd blessing prone,</L>
<L>Chiefly conforms itself to that alone.</L>
