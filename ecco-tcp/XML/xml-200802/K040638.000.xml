<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the printing of this little Piece, it has been intimated to the Author, that he is likely to suffer from some ill Will, occasioned by a very faulty, and very unfortunate, Opera of his represented last Win∣ter; but he begs leave to observe, that it is against the Laws of <HI>England</HI> to try a Man twice for the same Fact; and more so, after Punishment has been inflicted. He thinks it can hardly be necessary to say, that he never, in any of his Writings, intended to give the least Offence: And as his tri∣fling Productions, have more than once, been lucky enough to be ho∣noured with the Approbation of the Public; he flatters himself, should he again be found capable of affording them an innocent Entertainment; that those to whose Justice he most readily subscribes, will not refuse him an Opportunity of appealing to their Candour.</P>

<P>Lord, papa, you call one such names—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fine girl, master Jenkins, a devilish fine girl! she has got my eye to a twinkle. There's fire for you —spirit!—I design to marry her to a Duke: how much money do you think a Duke would expect with such a wench?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Colonel, with submission, I think there is no occasion to go out of our own country here; we have never a Duke in it I believe, but we have many an honest gentleman, who, in my opinion, might de∣serve the young lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, you would have me marry Dy to a country 'squire, eh! How say you to this Dy! would not you rather be married to a Duke?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>So my husband's a rake, papa, I don't care what he is.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>A rake! you damned confounded little baggage; why you wou'd not wish to marry a rake, wou'd you? So her husband is a rake, she does not care what he is! Ha, ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but listen to me, papa—When you go out with your gun, do you take any pleasure in shooting the poor tame ducks, and chickens in your yard? No, the partridge, the pheasant, the woodcock are the game; there is some sport in bringing them down be∣cause they are wild; and it is just the same with an husband or a lover. I would not waste powder and shot, to wound one of your sober pretty behaved gentle∣men; but to hit a libertine, extravagant, madcap fellow, to take him upon the wing—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you hear her, master Jenkins? Ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but, good Colonel, what do you say to my worthy and honourable patron here, Sir John Flowerdale? He has an estate of eight thousand pounds a year as well paid rents as any in the kingdom, and but one only daughter to enjoy it; and yet he is willing, you see, to give this daughter to your son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Mr. Jenkins, how does Miss Clarissa and our university friend Mr. Lionel? That is the only grave young man I ever liked, and the only handsome one I ever was acquainted with, that did not make love to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, master Jenkins, who is this Lionel? They say he is a damn'd witty knowing fellow; and egad I think him well enough for one brought up in a college.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>His father was a general officer, a particular friend of Sir John's, who, like many more brave men, that live and die in defending their country, left little else than honour behind him. Sir John sent this young man, at his own expence, to Oxford; where, while his son lived, they were upon the same footing: and since our young gentleman's death, which you know unfortunately happened about two years ago, he has continued him there. During the vacation he is come to pay us a visit, and Sir John intends that he shall shortly take orders, for a very considerable benefice in the gift of the family, the present incumbent of which is an aged man.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>The last time I was at at your house, he was teaching Miss Clarissa mathematics and philosophy. Lord, what a strange brain I have! If I was to sit down to distract myself with such studies—</P>

<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go, hussey, let some of your brother's rascals inform their master that he has been long enough at his toilet; here is a message from Sir John Flowerdale —You a brain for mathematics indeed! We shall have women wanting to head our regiments to-morrow or next day.</P>

<STAGE>Colonel OLDBOY, JENKINS.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, master Jenkins! don't you think now that a Nobleman, a Duke, an Earl, or a Marquis, might be content to share his title—I say, you under∣stand me—with a sweetener of thirty or forty thousand pounds, to pay off mortgages? Besides, there's a prospect of my whole estate; for, I dare swear, her bro∣ther will never have any children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be concerned at that, Colonel, when there are two such fortunes to descend to his heirs, as yours and Sir John Flowerdale's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why look you, master Jenkins, Sir John Flower∣dale is an honest gentleman; our families are nearly re∣lated; we have been neighbours time out of mind; and if he and I have an odd dispute now and then, it is not for want of a cordial esteem at bottom. He is going to marry his daughter to my son; she is a beautiful girl, an elegant girl, a sensible girl, a worthy girl, and—a word in your ear—damn me if I aint very sorry for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sorry! Colonel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay—between ourselves, master Jenkins, my son won't do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, master Jenkins, he won't do—he is not the thing, a prig—At sixteen years old, or thereabouts, he was a bold, sprightly boy, as you should see in a thousand; could drink his pint of port, or his bottle of claret—now he mixes all his wine with water.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! if that be his only fault, Colonel, he will ne'er make the worse husband, I'll answer for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know my wife is a woman of quality— I was prevailed upon to send him to be brought up by her brother Lord Jessamy, who had no children of his own, and promised to leave him an estate—he has got the estate indeed, but, the fellow has taken
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
his Lordship's name for it. Now, master Jenkins, I would be glad to know, how the name of Jessamy is better than that of Oldboy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! but, Colonel, it is allowed on all hands that his Lordship has given your son an excellent education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! he sent him to the university, and to travel forsooth; but what of that; I was abroad, and at the university myself, and never a rush the better for either. I quarelled with his Lordship about six years before his death, and so had not an opportunity of see∣ing how the youth went on; if I had, master Jenkins, I would no more have suffered him to be made such a monkey of—He has been in my house but three days, and it is all turned topsy turvy by him and his rascally servants—then his chamber is like a perfumer's shop, with wash-balls, pastes, and pomatum—and do you know he had the impudence to tell me yesterday at my own table, that I did not know how to behave my∣self?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Colonel, how does my Lady Mary?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>What my wife? In the old way, master Jenkins; always complaining; ever something the matter with her head, or her back, or her legs—but we have had the devil to pay lately—she and I did not speak to one another for three weeks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little affair of jealousy—you must know my game-keeper's daughter has had a child, and the plaguy baggage takes it into her head to lay it to me —Upon my soul it is a fine fat chubby infant as ever I set my eyes on; I have sent it to nurse; and, be∣tween you and me, I believe I shall leave it a fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Colonel, you will never give over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know my Lady has a pretty vein of poetry; she writ me an heroic epistle upon it, where she calls me her dear false Damon; so I let her cry a little, promised to do so no more, and now we are as good friends as ever.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Colonel, I must take my leave; I have delivered my message, and Sir John may expect the pleasure of your company to dinner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, we'll come—pox o' ceremony among friends. But won't you stay to see my son; I have sent to him, and suppose he will be here as soon as his valet-de-chambre will give him leave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no occasion, good Sir: present my humble respects, that's all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but, zounds, Jenkins, you must not go till you drink something—let you and I have a bottle of hock—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not for the world, Colonel; I never touch any thing strong in a morning.</P>

<P>Never touch any thing strong! Why one bottle won't hurt you man, this is old and as mild as milk.</P>

<P>Upon my word, Colonel, this is a solecism.</P>

<P>'Sblood, my Lady, it's none. Sir John Flower∣dale came but last night from his sister's seat in the west, and is a little out of order.

<SPEAKER>Lady M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but, Mr. Oldboy, permit me to say—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>He need not give himself so many affected airs; I think it's very well if he gets such a girl for going for; she's one of the handsomest and richest in this country, and more than he deserves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Jess.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's an exceeding fine china jar your Ladyship has got in the next room; I saw the fellow of it the other day at Williams's, and will send to my agent to purchase it: it is the true matchless old blue and white. Lady Betty Barebones has a couple that she gave an hundred guineas for, on board an India∣man; but she reckons them at a hundred and twenty-five,
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
on account of half a dozen plates, four Nankeen beakers, and a couple of shaking Mandarins, that the custom-house officers took from under her petticoats.</P>

<P>Did you ever hear the like of this! He's chat∣tering about old china, while I am talking to him of a fine girl. I tell you what, Mr. Jessamy, since that's the name you choose to be called by, I have a good mind to knock you down.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Jess.</SPEAKER>
<P>Knock me down! Colonel? What do you mean? I must tell you, Sir, this is a language to which I have not been accustomed; and, if you think proper to continue or repeat it, I shall be under a necessity of quitting your house.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heigho! don't be surprised, my dear; it was the same thing with my late dear brother, Lord Jessamy; they never could agree: that good natured, friendly soul, knowing the delicacy of my constitution, has often said, sister Mary, I pity you. Not but your father has good qualities, and I assure you I remember him a very fine gentleman himself. In the year of the hard-frost, one thousand seven hundred and thirty-nine, when he first paid his addresses to me, he was called agreeable Jack Oldboy, though I married him without the consent of your noble grandfather.</P>
</SP>

<P>I think he ought to be proud of me: I believe there's many a Duke, nay Prince, who would esteem themselves happy in having such a son—</P>

<P>Yes, my dear; but your sister was always your father's favourite: he intends to give her a pro∣digious fortune, and sets his heart upon seeing her a woman of quality.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Jess.</SPEAKER>
<P>He should wish to see her look a little like a gentlewoman first. When she was in London, last winter, I am told she was taken notice of by a few men. But she wants air, manner—</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady M.</SPEAKER>
<P>And has not a bit of the genius of our family, and I never knew a woman of it but herself without. I have tried her: about three years ago I set her to translate a little French song: I found she had not even an idea of versification; and she put down love and joy for rhyme—so I gave her over.</P>

But, suppose I should not like her when I see her? Why, positively, then I will not have her; the treaty's at an end, and, sans compliment, we break up the congress. But, won't that be cruel, after having suffered her to flatter herself with hopes, and shewing myself to her. She's a strange dowdy I dare believe: however, she brings provision with her for a separate maintenance.</P>

<P>Pardon me, Madam, there is something ails you indeed. Lord! what signifies all the grandeur and riches in this world, if they can't procure one content. I am sure it vexes me to the heart, so it does, to see, such a dear, sweet, worthy young Lady, as you are, pining yourself to death.</P>

<P>Jenny, you are a good girl, and I am very much obliged to you for feeling so much on my ac∣count; but, in a little time, I hope I shall be easier.</P>

<P>Why, now, here to day, Madam, for fartain you ought to be merry to day, when there's a fine gentleman coming to court you; but, if you like any one else better, I am sure, I wish you had him, with all my soul.</P>

<P>Madam! Madam! yonder's Sir John and Mr. Lionel on the terras: I believe they are coming up here. Poor, dear Mr. Lionel, he does not seem to

be in over great spirits either. To be sure, Madam, it's no business of mine; but, I believe, if the truth was known, there are those in the house, who wou'd give more than ever I shall be worth, or any the likes of me, to prevent the marriage of a sartain person that shall be nameless.</P>

<P>Lauk! Madam, do you think, when Mr. Lionel's a clergyman, he'll be obliged to cut off his hair? I'm sure it will be a thousand pities, for it is the sweetest colour, and looks the nicest put up in a cue —and your great pudding-sleeves! Lord! they'll quite spoil his shape, and the fall of his shoulders. Well! Madam, if I was a Lady of large fortune, I'll be hanged if Mr. Lionel should be a parson, if I could help it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Lionel, I will not hear of it. What! to run from us all of a sudden, this way; and at such a time too; the eve of my daughter's wedding, as I may call it; when your company must be doubly agreeable, as well as necessary to us? I am sure you have no studies at present, that require your attend∣ance at Oxford: I must, therefore, insist on your putting such thoughts out of your head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Sir, I have been so long from the university, that it is time for me to think of returning. It is true, I have no absolute studies; but, really, Sir, I shall be obliged to you, if you will give me leave to go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, my dear Lionel, I have for some time observed a more than ordinary gravity growing upon you, and I am not to learn the reason of it: I know, to minds serious, and well inclined, like yours, the sacred function you are about to embrace—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, your goodness to me, of every kind, is so great, so unmeritted! Your condescension, your friendly attentions—in short, Sir, I want words to ex∣press my sense of obligations—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fie, fie, no more of them. By my last letters, I find that my old friend, the rector, still con∣tinues in good health, considering his advanced years. You may imagine I am far from desiring the death of so worthy and pious a man; yet, I must own, at this time, I could wish you were in orders, as you might then perform the ceremony of my daughter's marriage; which would give me a secret satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt, Sir, any office in my power, that could be instrumental to the happiness of any of your family, I should perform with pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, really, Lionel, from the character of her intended husband, I have no room to doubt, but this match will make Clarissa perfectly happy: to be sure, the alliance is the most eligible, for both families.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the gentleman is sensible of his happiness, in the alliance, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fondness of a father is always sus∣pected of partiality; yet, I believe, I may venture to say, that few young women will be found more unex∣ceptionable than my daughter: her person is agreeable, her temper sweet, her understanding good; and, with the obligations she has to your instruction—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do my endeavours too much honour, Sir; I have been able to add nothing to Miss Flower∣dale's accomplishments, but a little knowledge in matters of small importance to a mind already so well improved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't think so; a little knowledge, even in those matters, is necessary for a woman, in whom, I am far from considering ignorance as a desireable characteristic: when intelligence is not attended with impertinent affectation, it teaches them to judge with precision, and gives them a degree of solidity necessary for the companion of a sensible man.</P>
</SP>

<P>My dear Clarissa—I'm glad I have found you alone.—For Heaven's sake, don't let any one break in upon us;— and give me leave to sit down with you a little:— I am in such a tremour, such a panic—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy on us, what has happened?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You may remember I told you, that when I was last winter in London, I was followed by an odious fellow, one Harman; I can't say but the wretch pleased me, though he is but a younger brother, and not worth six-pence: And—In short, when I was leaving town, I promised to correspond with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think that was prudent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madness! But this is not the worst; for what do you think, the creature had the assurance to write to me about three weeks ago, desiring permission to come down and spend the summer at my father's.</P>

<P>At your father's!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ay, who never saw him, knows nothing of him, and would as soon consent to my marrying a horse jockey. He told me a long story of some tale he in∣tended to invent to make my father receive him as an indifferent person; and some gentlemen in London, he said, would procure him a letter that should give it a face; and he longed to see me so, he said, he could not live without it; and if he could be permited but to spend a week with me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what answer did you make?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! abused him, and refused to listen to any such thing—But—I vow I tremble while I tell it you— Just before we left our house, the impudent monster arrived there, attended by a couple of servants, and is now actually coming here with my father.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Diana, with regard to your affair— I think you must find some method of immediately in∣forming this gentleman that you consider the outrage he has committed against you in the most heinous light, and insist upon his going away directly.</P>

<P>Why, I believe that will be the best way— but then he'll be begging my pardon and asking to stay.</P>

Yet is it criminal to know the most worthy, most ami∣able man in the world, and not be insensible to his merit? But my father, the kindest, best of fathers, will he approve the choice I have made? Nay, has he not made another choice for me? And, after all, how can I be sure that the man I love, loves me again? He never told me so; but his looks, his actions, his pre∣sent anxiety sufficiently declare what his delicacy, his generosity will not suffer him to utter: it is my part then to speak first.—</P>

<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, we hope not; but as the matter is dubious, and will probably make some noise, I thought it was better to be for a little time out of the way; when hearing my case Sir Richard Rantum mentioned you; he said, he was sure you would permit me to remain at your house for a few days, and offered me a recommendation.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but Mr. Lionel, consider, pray consider now; how can you be so prodigious undiscreet as you are, walking about the hall here, while the gentlefolks are within in the parlour? Don't you think they'll wonder at your getting up so soon after dinner, and before any of the rest of the company?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>For Heaven's sake, Jenny, don't speak to me: I neither know where I am, nor what I am doing; I am the most wretched and miserable of all mankind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor dear soul I pity you. Yes, yes, I believe you are miserable enough indeed; and I assure you I have pitied you a great while, and spoke many a word in your favour, when you little thought you had such a friend in a corner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion,</SPEAKER>
<P>But, good Jenny, since, by some accident or other, you have been able to discover what I would willingly hide from all the world; I conjure you, as you regard my interest, as you value your Lady's peace and honour, never let the most distant hint of it escape you; for it is a secret of that importance—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, perhaps, you think I cant keep a secret. Ah! Mr. Lionel, it must be hear, see, and say nothing in this world, or one has no business to live in it; be∣sides who would not be in love with my Lady? There's never a man this day alive but might be proud of it; for she is the handsomest, sweetest temperdest! And I am sure one of the best mistresses, ever poor girl had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Jenny! She's an angel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so she is indeed—Do you know that she gave me her blue and silver sack to day, and it is every crum as good as new; and, go things as they will, don't you be fretting and vexing yourself, for I am mortally sartain she would liverer see a toad than this Jessamy. Though I must say, to my thinking, he's a very likely man; and a finer pair of eye-brows, and a more delicater nose I never saw on a face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>By Heavens I shall run mad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why so? It is not beauty that always takes the fancy: Moreover, to let you know, if it was, I don't think him any more to compare to you, than a thistle is to a carnation: and so's a sign; for, mark my words, my Lady loves you, as much as she hates him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you tell me, Jenny, is a thing I neither merit nor expect: No, I am unhappy, and let me con∣tinue so; my most presumptuous thoughts shall never carry me to a wish that may affect her quiet, or give her cause to repent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very honourable of you I must needs say; but for all that, liking's liking, and one can't help it; and if it should be my Lady's case it is no fault of yours. I am sure, when she called me into her dressing-room, before she went down to dinner, there she stood with her eyes brim full of tears; and so I fell a crying for company—and then she said she could not abice the chap in the parlour; and at the same time, she bid me take an opportunity to speak to you, and de∣sire you to meet her in the garden this evening after tea; for she has something to say to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Jenny, I see you are my friend; for which I thank you, though I know it is impossible to do me any service; take this ring and wear it for my sake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very much obliged to your honour; I am your friend indeed—but, I say, you won't forget to be in the garden now; and in the mean time keep as little in the house as you can, for walls have eyes and ears; and I can tell you the servants take notice of your uneasiness, tho' I am always desiring them to mind their own business.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray have a care Jenny, have a care my dear girl, a word may breed suspicion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! have a care yourself; it is you that breeds suspicion, sighing and pining about; you look for all the world like a ghost; and if you don't pluck up your spirits you will be a ghost soon; letting things get the better of you. Though to be sure when I thinks with myself, being cross'd in love is a terrible thing— There was a young man in the town where I was born made away with himself upon the account of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Things shan't get the better of me Jenny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more they don't ought. And once again I say, fortune is thrown in your dish and you are not to fling it out; my Lady's estate will be better than three bishopricks if Sir John could give them to you. Think of that Mr. Lionel, think of that.</P>

<P>Mr. Oldboy, won't you give me your hand to lead me up stairs, my dear?—Sir, I am prodigiously obliged to you; I protest I have not been so well, I don't know when: I have had no return of my bilious com∣plaint after dinner to-day; and eat so voraciously! Did you observe Miss? the whole wing of a Partridge; Doctor Arsnic will be quite astonished when he hears it; surely his new invented medicine has done me a pro∣digious deal of service.</P>

<P>It brought Sir Barnaby Drugg from death's door, after having tryed the Spaw and Bristol waters without effect: it is good for several things, in many sovereign, as in colds and consumptions, and lowness of spirits; it corrects the humours, rectifies the juices, regulates the nervous system; creates an appetite, pre∣vents flushings and sickness after meals; as also vain fears and head-achs; it is the finest thing in the world for an asthma; and no body that takes it, is ever troubled with hysterics.</P>

<P>Hush, my dear Colonel, don't mention it; to be sure the circumstance was vastly indelicate; but for the number of lines, the poem was as charming a morsel—I heard the Earl of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nley say, who understood Latin, that it was equal to any thing in Catullus.</P>

<P>In my opinion, Sir.</P>

<P>What, as handsome as Dy—! I'll lay you twenty pounds she has not such a pair of eyes. — He tells me he's in love, Dy; raging mad for love, and, by his talk, I begin to believe him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, for my part, papa, I doubt it very much; though, by what I heard the gentleman say just now wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hin, I find he imagines the lady has a violent partiality for him; and yet he may be mistaken there too.</P>

<P>For shame, Dy, what the mischief do you mean? How can you talk so tartly to a poor young fellow un∣der misfortunes? Give him your hand, and ask his pardon.— Don't mind her, Harman.—For all this, she is as good-natur'd a little devil, as ever was born.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may remember, Sir, I told you before dinner, that I had for some time carried on a private correspondence with my lovely girl; and that her father, whose consent we despair of obtaining, is the great obstacle to our happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why don't you carry her off in spight of him, then?—I ran away with my wife—ask my Lady Mary, she'll tell you the thing herself.—Her old conceited Lord of a father thought I was not good enough; but I mounted a garden-wall, notwithstanding their cheveux-de-frize of broken glass bottles, took her out of a three pair of stairs window, and brought her down a ladder in my arms.—By the way, she would have squeezed through a cat-hole to get at me.—And I would have taken her out of the Tower of London, damme, if it had been surrounded with the three regiments of guards.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what do I care? I say, if he takes my advice he'll run away with her, and I'll give him all the assistance I can.</P>

<P>I am sure, Sir, you are very kind; and, to tell you the truth, I have more than once had the very scheme in my head, if I thought it was feasible, and knew how to go about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Feasible, and knew how to go about it! The thing's feasible enough, if the girl's willing to go off with you, and you have spirit sufficient to undertake it.</P>

<P>O, as for that Sir, I can answer.</P>

<P>What, Sir, that the lady will be willing to go off with you?</P>

<P>So he may; she lives but in this county; and tell her, Harman, you have met with a friend, who is inclined to serve you. You shall have my post-chaise at a minute's warning; and if a hundred pieces will be of any use to you, you may command 'em.</P>

<P>And you are really serious, Sir?</P>

<P>Nay, my dear Diana, I confess I have been rather too bold;—but consider, I languish'd to see you; and when an opportunity offer'd to give me that pleasure without running any risque, either of your quiet or reputation, how hard was it to be resisted?

<P>Upon my word, a pretty elegant dressing-room this; but confound our builders, or architects, as they call themselves, they are all errant stone-masons; not one of them know the situation of doors, windows, or chimnies; which are as essential to a room as eyes, nose and mouth to a countenance.

<P>My dear brother, you are not come here as a virtuoso to admire the temple; but as a votary to ad∣dress the deity to whom it belongs. Shew, I beseech you, a little more devotion, and tell me, how do you like Miss Flowerdale? don't you think her very hand∣some?</P>

<P>Brother, I would fain give you some advice upon this occasion, which may be of service to you: You are now going to entertain a young Lady— Let me prevail upon you to lay aside those airs, on account of which some people are impertinent enough to call you a coxcomb; for, I am afraid, she may be apt to think you a coxcomb too, as I assure you she is very capable of distinguishing.</P>

<P>Sir, I have served Sir John Flowerdale many years: he is the best of masters; and, I believe, he has some dependance on my attachment and fidelity.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Jess.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Mr. Jenkins, I shall condescend to speak to you. Does your master know who I am? Does he know, Sir, that I am likely to be a Peer of Great Britain? That I have ten thousand pounds a year: that I have passed through all Europe with dis∣tinguished eclat; that I refused the daughter of Myn∣heer Van Slokenfolk, the great Dutch burgomaster: and, that, if I had not had the misfortune of being bred a protestant, I might have married the niece of his present holiness the Pope; with a fortune of two hundred thousand piastres.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure, Sir, my master has all the respect imaginable—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Jess.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, how comes he, after my shewing an inclination to be allied to his family; how comes he, I say, to bring me to his house to be af∣fronted. I have let his daughter go; but, I think, I was in the wrong; for a woman that insults me, is no more safe than a man. I have brought a Lady to reason before now, for giving me saucy language; and left her male friends to revenge it.</P>

<P>Pray, good Sir, what is the matter?</P>

<P>Why, Sir, this is the matter, Sir—Your master's daughter, Sir, has behaved to me with damn'd insolence, and impertinence; and, you may tell Sir John Flowerdale, first, with regard to her,
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
that, I think she is a silly, ignorant, aukward, ill bred country puss.</P>

<L>Oh! Sir, for Heaven's sake—</L>

<P>Yes, and the family are preparing to follow him: it is impossible to describe to you, how I am grieved at this fatal accident; you know, as well as I, the cogent reasons that determined me to this marriage. Oh Lionel! Clarissa has deceived me: in this affair she has suffered me to deceive myself.

<P>And we are a moon to the moon! Nay, child, I know something of astronomy, but that—that little shining thing there, which seems not much larger than a silver plate, should, perhaps, contain great cities like London; and who can tell but they may have kings there and parliaments, and plays and operas, and people of fashion!

<P>Was ever such a wretch—I can't stay a mo∣ment in a place; where is my repose?—fled with my virtue? Was I then born for falshood and dissimulation? I was, I was, and live to be conscious of it; to impose upon my friend; to betray my benefactor and lie to hide my ingratitude—a monster in a moment—No, I may be the most unfortunate of men, but I will not be the most odious; while my heart is yet capable of dictating what is honest, I will obey its voice.</P>

<P>Pry'thee, hear me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, what would you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid of the step we are going to take; indeed, I am: 'tis true, my father is the contriver of it; but, really, on consideration, I think, I should appear less culpable if he was not so; I am at once criminal myself and rendering him ridiculous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you love me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose I do, you give me a very ill proof of your love for me, when you would take advantage of my tenderness, to blind my reason: how can you have so little regard for my honour as to sacrifice it to a vain triumph? For, it is in that light I see the rash action you are forcing me to commit; nay, me∣thinks my consenting to it should injure me in your own esteem. When a woman forgets what she owes herself, a lover should set little value upon any thing she gives to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you suppose then, can you imagine, that my passion will ever make me forget the veneration— And, an elopement is nothing, when it is on the road to matrimony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>At best, I shall incur the censure of disobe∣dience, and indiscretion; and, is it nothing to a young woman, what the world says of her? Ah! my good friend, be assured, such a disregard of the world is the first step towards deserving its reproaches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, the necessity we are under—Mankind has too much good sense, too much good nature—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every one has good sense enough to see other people's faults, and good nature enough to
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
overlook their own. Besides, the most sacred things may be made an ill use of; and, even marriage itself, if indecently and improperly—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, get yourself ready: where is your band-box, hat, and cloak? Slip into the garden; be there, at the iron-gate, which you shewed me just now; and, as the post-chaise comes round, I will step and take you in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, one thing more. My fortune depends almost entirely upon my father's generosity: now, think, with yourself, whether it would not be better to devise some other method.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hang fortune! It is the bane of love; and, therefore, they are both pictur'd blind, to shew, that their coming together can never be premeditated; but, if they do meet, it is by chance, when they jostle, and one generally overturns t'other.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, faith, Sir, she has been taking me to task here, very severely, with regard to this affair; and she has said so much against it, and put it into such a strange light, that, she has almost stagger'd my resolution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>A busy impertinent baggage; egad, I wish I had catched her meddling, and after I had ordered her not: but, the thing's gone too far now to retract: you say, you have sent to the girl, and she has re∣turn'd for answer, that she is ready to go with you; you must not disappoint the poor thing, nor you shan't.</P>

<P>Very well—now, let me ask you; don't you think it would be proper upon this occasion to have a letter ready writ for the father, to let him know who has got his daughter, where you have taken her, and how you design to dispose of her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, Sir, and I'll write it directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>You write it! you be damn'd! I wo'nt trust you with it; I tell you, Harman, you'll commit some cursed blunder, if you don't leave the management of this whole affair to me: I have writ the letter for you myself.</P>
</SP>

<P>Have you, Sir?</P>

<P>Ay—here, read it; I think its the thing: how∣ever, you are welcome to make any alteration you like.</P>

<P>"Sir, I have loved your daughter a great while, secretly; she assures me there is no hopes of your consenting to our marriage; I therefore, take her without it. I am a gentleman who will use her well;
<PB N="55" REF="58"/>
and, when you consider the matter, I dare swear you will be willing to give her a fortune. If not, you shall find I dare behave myself like a man—A word to the wise—You must expect to hear from me in another stile."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir, I will tell you what you must do with this letter: as soon as you have got off with the girl, Sir, send your servant back to leave it at the house, with orders to have it deliver'd to the old gentleman.</P>

<P>Upon my honour, I will, Colonel.</P>

<P>But, upon my honour, I don't believe you'll get the girl: come, Harman, I'll bet you a buck, and six dozen of burgundy, that you won't have spirit enough to bring this affair to a crisis.</P>

<P>Mr. Oldboy, here is a note from Sir John Flowerdale: it is address'd to me, intreating my son to come over there again this morning.

<P>Lady Mary don't provoke me, but let me talk to the girl about her business. How come you to bring this note here?</P>

<P>Why Sir John gave it to me, to deliver to my uncle Jenkins, and I took it down to his house; but while we were talking together, he remember∣ed that he had some business with Sir John, so he desired me to bring it, because he said it was not proper to be sent by any of the common servants.</P>

<P>A slut! a jade! and he a rascal, a poaching rascal! but damn me I won't follow her; No, no, take my whip and my cap; and my coat, and come here you, Sir, and pull off my boot; ay, ay, let her cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me be her punishment; I won't follow her the length of a spur leather; but I will be revenged on her; she shall never have six-pence from me: the disappointment will put the scoundrel out of temper, and he'll thrash her a dozen times a day—The thought pleases me, I hope he will do so—Zounds! who would ever have de∣pendance on any thing female she that seemed so well contented in my house, and in the very moment when I was best contented with her, and contriving to make her fortune—But why should I vex myself? I am no worse off than every father may be, if an opportunity offers.</P>

<P>So then, the mystery is discovered:—but is it possible that m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> daughter's refusal of Colonel's Old∣boy's son should proceed from a clandestine engagement, and that engagement with Lionel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>My niece, Sir, is in her young Lady's secrets, and Lord knows she had little design to betray them; but having remarked some odd expressions of hers yester∣day, when sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> came down to me this morning with the letter, I questioned her; and, in short, drew the whole affair out; upon which I feigned a recollection of some business with you, and desired her to carry the letter to Colonel Oldboy's herself, while I came up hither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jo.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they are mutually promised to each other, and that promise was exchanged yesterday.</P>
</SP>

<P>Yes, Sir, and it is my duty to tell you; else I would rather die then be the means of wounding the heart of my dear young lady; for if there is one upon earth of truly noble and delicate sentiments.—</P>

<P>Sir, I can never think that nature stamp'd, that gracious countenance of his, to mask a corrupt heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jo.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! at the very time that he was conscious of being himself the cause of it; did he not shew more concern at this affair than I did? Nay, don't I tell you that last night, of his own accord, he offered to be a mediator in the affair; desired my leave to speak to my daughter; I thought myself obliged to him, consented; and, in consequence of his assurance of success, wrote that letter to Colonel Oldboy, to desire the family would come here again to-day.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, as we were standing in the next room, I heard a message delivered from Mr. Lionel, desiring leave to wait upon your daughter; I dare swear they will be here presently; suppose we were to step into that closet, and overhear their conversation.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this pretty, Sir John?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, Madam, it is not for want of a just sense of Mr. Jessamy's merit, that this affair has gone off on any side: but the heart is a delicate thing; and after it has once felt, if the object is meritorious, the impression is not easily effac'd; it would therefore have been an injury to him, to have given him in appearance what another in reality possessed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Jess.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my honour, upon my soul, Sir John, I am not the least offended at this <HI>contre temps</HI>—Pray, Lady Mary say no more about it.—</P>

<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tol, lol, lol, lol.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear Colonel, I am afraid, after all, this affair is taken amiss by you; yes; I see you are angry on your son's account; but let me repeat it, I have a very high opinion of his merit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay—that's more than I have—Taken amiss— I don't take any thing amiss; I never was in better spirits, or more pleased in my life.</P>

<P>Come, you are uneasy at something, Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me! Gad I am not uneasy—are you a justice of peace! Then you could give me a warrant, cou'd'nt you? You must know, Sir John, a little accident has happen'd in my family since I saw you last, you and I may shake hands—Daughters, Sir, daughters! Your's has snapt at a young fellow without your approbation; and how do you think mine has serv'd me this morning? —only run away with the scoundrel I brought to dinner, here, yesterday.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am excessively concerned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I'm not a bit concern'd—No, damn me, I am glad it has happened; yet, thus far, I'll confess, I should be sorry that either of them would come in my way, because a man's temper may sometimes get the better of him, and I believe I should be tempted to break her neck, and blow his brains out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray, Sir, explain this affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can explain it no farther—Dy, my daughter Dy, has run away from us.</P>

<P>No, my dear papa, I am not run away; and, upon my knees, I intreat your pardon for the folly I have committed; but, let it be some alleviation that duty, affection, were too strong to suffer me to car∣ry it to extremity: and, if you knew the agony I have been in, since I saw you last—</P>

<P>Sir, I restore your daughter to you; whose fault, as far as it goes, I must also take upon myself; we have been known to each other sometime; as Lady Richly, your sister, in London, can acquaint you—</P>

<P>Dy, come here—Now, you rascal where's your sword; if you are a gentleman you shall fight me; if you are a scrub, I'll horse-whip you—Draw, Sirrah —Shut the door there, don't let him escape.</P>

<P>Sir, don't imagine I want to escape; I am ex∣tremely sorry for what has happened, but am ready to give you any satisfaction you think proper.</P>

<P>Follow me into the garden then—Zounds! I have no sword about me—Sir John Flowerdale—lend us a case of pistols, or a couple of guns; and, come and see fair play.</P>

<P>Why, Miss Dy, you are a perfect heroine for a romance—And, pray who is this courteous knight?</P>

<P>O Sir, you that I thought such a pretty behav'd gentleman!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Jess.</SPEAKER>
<P>What business are you of friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>My chief trade, Sir, is plain dealing; and, as that is a commodity you have no reason to be very fond of, I would not advise you to purchase any of it by impertinence;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is this what you would advise me to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, indeed, my dear old friend; as things are situated, there is, in my opinion, no other prudent method of proceeding; and it is the method I would adopt myself, was I in your case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I believe you are in the right of it—say what you will for me then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! young people, I have been able to use a few arguments, which have softned my neighbour here; and in some measure pacified his resentment. I find, Sir, you are a gentleman by your connections?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, till it is found that my character and fa∣mily will bear the strictest scrutiny, I desire no favour —And for fortune —</P>
</SP>

<P>Oh! Rot your fortune, I don't mind that—I know you are gentleman, or Dick Rantum would not have recommended you. And so, Dy, kiss and friends.</P>

<P>What, Sir, have you no more to say to the man who has used you so ill?</P>
</SP>
