<HEAD>MARCELLA; A TRAGEDY, OF THREE ACTS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="preface">
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Tragedy may perhaps attract the notice of the curious reader, more by a literary anecdote relating to its subject, than by any intrinsic merit as a dramatic composition.</P>
<P>The story was recommended to <HI>YOUNG</HI> by the Author of Clarissa.—The poet adopted it, and wrote a single act; but this shared the fate of his other unfinished ma∣nuscripts, and, according to the direction of his will, was committed to the flames.</P>
<P>These particulars, with a concise sketch of the story as related by <HI>RICHARDSON,</HI> were communicated to Mr. <HI>THORNTON</HI> by the poet's very liberal and amiable Son, the neighbour and the much-esteemed relation of my dear departed friend, who wished me to build a tragedy upon this foundation.</P>
<P>Some particular circumstances prevented me at that time from executing the desire of a person, who, from the integrity of his judgment, and the uncommon warmth
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
of his friendship, had an undisputed title to influence my studies.—Other works had engaged me, and this drama∣tic story lay for some years neglected: but in looking over the letters of my still-valued, though lost correspondent, it struck me with new force. As the distress, with which it abounds, is of a private nature, it appeared to me sin∣gularly calculated for my purpose of forming a drama for a domestic theatre. I have therefore, with some con∣siderable alterations in the principal incident, raised from it a tragedy of three acts; with what success, it is now the privilege of my readers to pronounce.</P>
<P>I will not attempt to influence their decision by any arguments in its behalf; but let me be allowed to close this short preface with a little poetical acknowledgment to the two literary illustrious friends, who first marked the story for the tragic Muse, and from whom it has ac∣cidentally descended to me.</P>

<SPEAKER>MARCELLA.</SPEAKER>
<L>LET ardent friendship be the bond between us,</L>
<L>But O subdue this inauspicious love,</L>
<L>And chase it from thy breast!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUPERCIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Impossible!</L>
<L>Think, cruel monitor, thro' what long years</L>
<L>My heart has cherish'd an encreasing passion,</L>
<L>Till it is grown a portion of my being,</L>
<L>Which I can ne'er relinquish but with life!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know, that from our days of infancy</L>
<L>Thy vows have had the sanction of my father;</L>
<L>And from the period when he first became</L>
<L>The governor of this fair city, he</L>
<L>Has lean'd towards thee with an anxious hope</L>
<L>To call thee by the tender name of fon:</L>
<L>Nor can the world reprove his generous wishes,</L>
<L>For Barcelona's walls contain no youth</L>
<L>Of nobler blood, or higher estimation.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUPERCIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Lovely encomiast! sure the songs of seraphs,</L>
<L>And all the wondrous harmonies of Heaven,</L>
<L>Can never strike more sweetly on the soul,</L>
<L>Than the frank praise of those angelic lips.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I should despise my own uncandid heart,</L>
<L>If it refus'd that tribute of applause</L>
<L>Which selfish pride, and jealous envy pay</L>
<L>To thy acknowledg'd merit.—Yes! Lupercio,</L>
<L>I own, thy rank, and thy accomplish'd youth,</L>
<L>Might justly challenge a return of fondness</L>
<L>From the most haughty of our flatter'd sex;</L>
<L>Yet trust me, and I speak the words of friendship,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Twere wiser in thee, even could my tongue</L>
<L>Pronounce the free compliance thou entreatest,</L>
<L>To turn thy partial eyes from cold Marcella;</L>
<L>And for thy wise solicit me no more.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUPERCIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Mock not my senses with such admonition</L>
<L>As reason must revolt from! Wouldst thou say</L>
<L>To the poor wretch, who after many a step</L>
<L>O'er Afric's burning sands, half dead with drought,</L>
<L>Holds in his parch'd and eager hand at last</L>
<L>The liquid blessing, that he long has pin'd for;</L>
<L>Then wouldst thou say, that wisdom bids him dash</L>
<L>The salutary treasure from his tongue,</L>
<L>And perish by the thirst that wastes his being?</L>
<L>Such, and more cruel is thy counsel now,</L>
<L>That would induce me to renounce thy charms,</L>
<L>E'en in these moments, when thy father's friendship</L>
<L>Had fill'd my soul with panting expectation</L>
<L>To hear thy heavenly voice declare me happy.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know my father's hopes; and by his worth</L>
<L>I swear, my heart oft wishes for the power</L>
<L>Most fondly to fulfil them.</L>

<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>LUPERCIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ha! what bar,</L>
<L>What secret bar, from quick-ey'd Love conceal'd,</L>
<L>Has envious fortune rais'd to thwart our union?</L>
<L>You say, that you regard me as your friend;</L>
<L>Then honour me with friendship's dearest claim,</L>
<L>Unbounded confidence!—unfold your heart!—</L>
<L>If, to cut off the promise of my bliss,</L>
<L>If there is aught of unknown fondness there,</L>
<L>Which fears a father's eye, confide in me!</L>
<L>And though against myself—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ingenuous youth!</L>
<L>Your mind is noble, but you little know</L>
<L>Marcella's heart, above all low disguise,</L>
<L>Proud of its truth, nor patient of controul.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUPERCIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Pardon the fond surmise of fearful love!</L>
<L>If thy soft breast is free from predilection,</L>
<L>What other bar?—and yet there may be other;</L>
<L>Nature perhaps has curs'd me with defects</L>
<L>Offensive to thy sight; some natural blemish</L>
<L>Of mind, or feature, which thy delicate sense</L>
<L>Tries to endure, but cannot.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLA.</SPEAKER>
<L>No! by Heaven!</L>
<L>Except the noble stranger, whom we saw</L>
<L>At mass this morning, and whose signal graces</L>
<L>Drew from us both observance of his person,</L>
<L>My eyes ne'er gaz'd upon a comelier youth:</L>
<L>And reason tells me, that I ought to love thee:</L>
<L>But my heart shrinks perversely from her voice.</L>
<L>Oft have I try'd to bend my wayward spirit</L>
<L>To crown thy constant vows, and bless my father;</L>
<L>Yet ever as my soul pursues that thought,</L>
<L>A secret tremor in my bosom bids me</L>
<L>Recoil from thy embraces, whispering there,</L>
<L>That I was only born to be thy bane.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUPERCIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou! thou my bane!—Thou art my life's support;</L>
<L>As dear, and as essential to my being,</L>
<L>As the blest radiance of the sun to nature.</L>
<L>These are the airy fears of virgin softness,</L>
<L>Most apt to harbour in the loveliest minds.</L>
<L>Banish the visionary dread, and give</L>
<L>Thy lighten'd heart to all the joys that court thee!</L>
<L>Thy father's prayers, the vows of all our friends</L>
<L>Will shed propitious lustre on our union:</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13"/>
Hymen can never light his genial flame</L>
<L>With happier auspices: but were they dark</L>
<L>And hideous as the sick man's feverish dreams;</L>
<L>Wert thou, instead of noble Garcia's heiress,</L>
<L>The child of want, and penury thy dower,</L>
<L>I still should pant as fondly for thy hand;</L>
<L>Still in thy wondrous charms and lovely virtues</L>
<L>Think all the blessings of the earth compriz'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know thee generous to a fond extreme:</L>
<L>It has subdu'd my waywardness of temper,</L>
<L>And, spite of the reluctance that I feel</L>
<L>To speak the important words, I will be thine.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUPERCIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Blest be that sound! it is an angel's voice,</L>
<L>Freeing the spirit of a tortur'd martyr,</L>
<L>And opening to his view the heaven he sigh'd for.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLA.</SPEAKER>
<L>And yet I fear—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUPERCIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Wound not enraptur'd love</L>
<L>With vain distrust! but name the blissful day,</L>
<L>When my fond heart—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I said, I will be thine:</L>
<L>Do not, with cruel importunity,</L>
<L>Now press me farther! As I frankly told thee,</L>
<L>My soul, I know not why, is out of tune;</L>
<L>Give me a little time to regulate</L>
<L>The strange emotion of my mind, and try</L>
<L>To meet thee, as I wish, without these terrors.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUPERCIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou dear directress of my fate! thy will</L>
<L>Shall ever sway the conduct of my life,</L>
<L>Howe'er it thwart me.—Yet, I pray thee, name</L>
<L>Some period, on which hope may dwell, to sooth</L>
<L>The restless interval! or kindly give me</L>
<L>Some pledge of thy dear promise!</L>

<SPEAKER>MARCELLA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Take this ring,</L>
<L>Of curious workmanship, near Tunis found,</L>
<L>And given my father by a noble Moor;</L>
<L>The wife of Asdrubal, you know the figure,</L>
<L>Plunging amidst the flames, in which she perish'd!</L>
<L>Wear this a month, then claim me as your bride!</L>
<L>But if you value me, preserve the jewel;</L>
<L>For if you lose this symbol of my faith,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="15"/>
Your negligence may lead me to retract</L>
<L>A promise, so reluctantly pronounc'd.</L>

<L>Rest here, thou radiant harbinger of bliss!</L>
<L>Trust me, my love, and by thyself I swear,</L>

<L>Than this dear gem be wrested from the finger</L>
<L>Where now it shines.—O let me kiss the hand</L>

<L>Yes, my father,</L>

<L>Hold private converse: I'll release thee soon</L>

<L>Meantime, my daughter, as the hour of vespers</L>

My father suffers his old foolish steward</L>

<L>I am indeed to blame, to treat so long</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>That faithful servant is depriv'd of sense</L>
<L>By the absurdest passion that e'er triumph'd</L>
<L>O'er manly reason: he was justly noted</L>
<L>For the best qualities that grace his station,</L>
<L>Intelligence and duty, till my daughter</L>
<L>Advanc'd to womanhood; but from that period,</L>
<L>E'en in proportion as her beauties ripen'd,</L>
<L>His faculties have seem'd upon the wane.</L>
<L>I have too lightly sported with his frenzy,</L>
<L>Which call'd for harsher discipline.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUPERCIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>O! no,</L>
<L>I feel he is entitled to compassion;</L>
<L>Marcella has those fascinating charms,</L>
<L>Which may intoxicate the soberest mind,</L>
<L>Till all its senses reel.—I cannot wonder</L>
<L>Age and deformity forget their nature</L>

<L>She may indeed (with pride the father speaks it)</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="20"/>
Be number'd with the loveliest of her sex.</L>
<L>With joy, brave youth, but with an anxious joy,</L>
<L>I give her to thy guard.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUPERCIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Doubt not my love!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Trust me, I do not: but anxiety</L>
<L>Is the high tax, which fond affection pays</L>
<L>For all its pleasures; and parental hearts,</L>
<L>As thou may'st prove hereafter, pay it double.</L>
<L>Besides, my daughter, lovely as she is,</L>
<L>Has qualities that claim the nicest care.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUPERCIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>She has a generous pride, which to her soul</L>
<L>Gives awful beauty, and proclaims it free</L>
<L>From all that poor and petty artifice,</L>
<L>Which manly arrogance presumes to think</L>
<L>Inherent in her sex.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>You know, Lupercio,</L>
<L>She is the only child that ever nature</L>
<L>Enrich'd me with; my tenderness, disdaining</L>
<L>The rigid customs of her sex and country,</L>
<L>Has rear'd her with a freedom little known</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="21"/>
To Spanish fair-ones; for I wish'd to make her,</L>
<L>Not the cag'd vassal of parental power,</L>
<L>But truth and nature's chaste and free disciple.</L>
<L>Her early temper join'd with my affection</L>
<L>To fix me in this conduct; for, believe me,</L>
<L>Her mind is like the element of fire;</L>
<L>Treat it with gentle caution, it will shine</L>
<L>The radiant minister of joy and comfort;</L>
<L>But close confinement, or a blind neglect,</L>
<L>May rouse its perilous energies to spread</L>
<L>Unthought-of scenes of misery and terror.</L>

<L>My blessing be thy guard!—Long have I wish'd</L>
<L>To give my daughter to this virtuous youth;</L>
<L>But 'tis the doom of age, in deeds of moment,</L>
<L>To feel the fit of warm desire succeeded</L>
<L>By terror's aguish tremblings. I begin</L>
<L>To fear I've press'd too far her generous mind,</L>
<L>To what her heart recoils from; for she weds</L>
<L>To indulge a father's wishes, not her own.</L>
<L>'Tis true, the tenderest motives have impell'd me</L>
<L>To urge this union, eager to entrust</L>
<L>Her peace and honour to a kind protector:</L>
<L>But anxious love, tho' probity may guide it,</L>
<L>Oft, with a fond precipitancy, foils</L>
<L>Its own dear purpose, and with dizzy rashness</L>
<L>Leaps in the dreaded gulph it strives to shun.—</L>

<L>A youth, whose opening virtues have reflected</L>
<L>New honour on his noble ancestry.</L>
<L>Our country, with a fond, impatient pride,</L>
<L>Expects him from his travels; but 'tis said</L>

<L>Your pardon!—'tis not in the power of language</L>

<L>My heart cries loudly, that the earth contains</L>
<L>No prize worth my contention, but her love.—</L>
<L>Report inform'd me, that her soft affections</L>
<L>Are yet unfix'd; tho' an accomplish'd youth,</L>

<L>Hopes hourly for the promise of her hand.</L>
<L>Fir'd by these tidings, as again I saw her</L>
<L>Approach the hallow'd precincts of the temple,</L>
<L>I threw me at her feet, conjur'd her pity</L>
<L>To guide me to your presence, and implor'd</L>
<L>The Guardian Saint, whose votary I sued to,</L>

<L>Dear Careless, you're welcome to rally my hopes;</L>
<L>So attack them with all your rhetorical tropes!</L>
<L>The man is ill-wrapt in philosophy's cloak,</L>
<L>Whose bosom is ruffled, dear Tom, by a joke.</L>
<L>I know money's scarce; yet I will not despond:</L>
<L>I've two friends who'll supply what I want, on my bond.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>What! <HI>two</HI> such good friends! so rich, open, and free!</L>
<L>Dear Cycle, I pray introduce them to me;</L>
<L>For not one of that cast my long list can produce:</L>
<L>Why! man, such a friend is the golden-egg'd goose;</L>
<L>You may hunt for the bird e'en as long as you're able,</L>
<L>But at last you will find it is only a fable.</L>
<L>I wanted but one hundred pound, t'other day,</L>
<L>And ask'd fifty friends, that chance threw in my way,</L>
<L>But they all shook their heads, with a negative nod,</L>
<L>So I dunn'd my old father, in spite of the rod.—</L>
<L>But pray do I know the good creatures you mean?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Aye! both.—They're two friends, whom for years I've not seen;</L>
<L>But in juvenile days I held each as my brother,</L>
<L>And I trust that we all are still dear to each other.</L>
<L><PB N="83" REF="84"/>
You're acquainted with Beril—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well! there, I confess,</L>
<L>Your wishes have some little chance of success.</L>
<L>If there's one in the world, who, regardless of pelf,</L>
<L>Would relieve a friend's wants, tho' he straiten'd himself,</L>
<L>You have now nam'd the man. Yet perhaps he can't lend:</L>
<L>I know he has suffer'd by aiding a friend;</L>
<L>And I fancy he has but a slender estate.</L>
<L>'Tis true, he ne'er plays, tho' carest by the great;</L>
<L>Yet in statues and books he's expensive, 'tis said—</L>
<L>I have seen him bid high for a porphyry head.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis hard, fortune still should torment him with crosses,</L>
<L>I sooth'd him to bear the severest of losses:</L>
<L>I was with him, when, blasted in youth's blooming charms,</L>
<L>His lovely Sophia was torn from his arms.</L>
<L>You knew not, I think, that unfortunate fair,</L>
<L>The victim of cruelty, love, and despair.</L>
<L>She was bound to our friend by a mutual affection,</L>
<L>But her rich sordid parents oppos'd the connection.</L>
<L><PB N="84" REF="85"/>
The canker of sorrow incessantly prey'd</L>
<L>On the perishing bloom of the delicate maid:</L>
<L>Her duty, her suff'rings, made nature relent,</L>
<L>And wrung from her father a tardy consent;</L>
<L>But death render'd vain the late sanction he gave,</L>
<L>And his child's bridal bed was the pitiless grave.</L>
<L>Many years have now soften'd the lover's wild grief:</L>
<L>Perhaps some new beauty now yields him relief.</L>
<L>He's still single, I think?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes! in learning and art</L>
<L>He has sought the chief balm for the wounds of his heart;</L>
<L>Hence a pleasing mild elegance runs thro' his life;</L>
<L>And had I a sister I'd wish her his wife.—</L>
<L>But now for your second friend!—What is his name?</L>
<L>For acquaintance with him too I'll certainly claim.</L>
<L>You say that I know him: come! tell me who is it!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes! indeed, it is one whom you frequently visit.</L>
<L>And here you must own, that my hopes are well founded,</L>
<L>Since in kindness and wealth he has ever abounded;</L>
<L>And a legacy lately—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>You don't mean Bijou,</L>
<L>That collector of knick-knacks?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Indeed, Tom, I do.</L>
<L>I've a title to ask any favor from him:</L>
<L>He has some little vanity, some little whim,</L>
<L>Yet still he's a friendly, benevolent man.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>You may rap at his door—but get in if you can!</L>
<L>Your friend, when you saw him, was jocund and free,</L>
<L>His heart full of bounty, his spirit of glee;</L>
<L>His vanities too had so mirthful a cast,</L>
<L>That Friendship herself even wish'd them to last.</L>
<L>But Marriage, that changer of mind and of feature,</L>
<L>Has made poor Bijou quite a different creature.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>I am told that his wife, with a pocket well laden,</L>
<L>Was a little, fat, ancient, and well-behav'd maiden;</L>
<L>Who, having a similar taste for virtù,</L>
<L>Put her cabinet under the care of Bijou.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, indeed! in an odd fit of amorous hunger,</L>
<L>He married an old curiosity-monger,</L>
<L><PB N="86" REF="87"/>
Who is ready to faint, if a visitor knocks</L>
<L>While she's brushing the dust from her raree-shew box.</L>
<L>Her maid t'other day threw her into a swoon,</L>
<L>By cracking the eye of a great stuff'd baboon;</L>
<L>For instead of young children, whose troublesome noise</L>
<L>Might disturb their sedate, <HI>virtuosical</HI> joys,</L>
<L>She fills their fine house with new monsters or mum∣mies.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Of your story, dear Tom, I perceive what the sum is.</L>
<L>You don't like the lady:—she may not please you,</L>
<L>And yet be an excellent wife for Bijou.</L>
<L>I am told she has really much merit and taste.</L>
<L>In her morals they say she's remarkably chaste;</L>
<L>So with lectures, perhaps, she has wounded your ear,</L>
<L>And you rakes of the Temple may think her severe.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, faith! with the lady I stand very well,</L>
<L>I bought her esteem with an old empty shell.</L>
<L>I own she has piety, morals, and sense:</L>
<L>To chastity no one will doubt her pretence.</L>
<L>But tho' with these virtues I freely invest her,</L>
<L>My heart, I confess, is inclin'd to detest her.</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="88"/>
She has ruin'd her husband—at least so I think;</L>
<L>To a dwarf she has made his benevolence shrink,</L>
<L>And puff'd up his vanity into a giant.</L>
<L>To all her strange whims he's so servilely pliant,</L>
<L>He'd obey her caprice, whatsoe'er it might hint,</L>
<L>And deny himself bread to buy her an odd flint.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why, Tom, that's a proof of his fond tender heart.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>To me it proves nought but her ladyship's art:</L>
<L>And so you yourself would explain the whole riddle,</L>
<L>If you heard her once flatter his pencil or fiddle,</L>
<L>As a more wretched brush never blotted poor paper,</L>
<L>And ne'er squeak'd a Cremona beneath a worse scraper.</L>
<L>Tho' pamper'd with flattery thus by his wife,</L>
<L>Our friend has quite lost all his humor and life;</L>
<L>And whenever I look on his cold chearless face,</L>
<L>As he stands by the side of his wife's fossil-case,</L>
<L>I think her a perfect Medusa, I own,</L>
<L>Who has turn'd her poor husband himself into stone.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>You loungers, dear Tom, in your idle disputes,</L>
<L>Love to ridicule all life's amusing pursuits:</L>
<L><PB N="88" REF="89"/>
But they all have their use; and the lady who joys</L>
<L>In collecting an odd set of whimsical toys,</L>
<L>Is herself a rare gem, that my judgment regards,</L>
<L>More than all the fair votaries of scandal and cards.</L>
<L>I know I shall like her, in spite of your stricture,</L>
<L>And I'm going to see how you've fail'd in her picture.</L>
<L>My old friend's good-will I shall put to the trial,</L>
<L>And solicit his aid without fear of denial.</L>

<L>Come along!—I will see if your welcome is hearty;</L>
<L>Indeed I may serve you by joining the party,</L>
<L>And I'm eager to know (for my portrait is true)</L>
<L>What you think of the change she has wrought in Bijou.</L>
<L>To a knowledge of nature I ne'er will pretend,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY FRANCES.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, indeed!—at first sight tho' it made my veins thrill,</L>

<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>From the worshipful court of wise Madam Bijou;</L>

<L>O you mischievous creature! you certainly mean,</L>

<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Pray tell me, my dear,</L>
<L>Of whom do you speak in a style so severe?</L>

<L>Of your friend, dear Papa, your good Mrs. Bijou.</L>

<L>That's ungrateful, dear Harriot—she's civil to you;</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>You forget, my dear Sir, how you often complain</L>
<L>That her low little pride, and nonsensical whim,</L>
<L>Have reduc'd your old friend to a pitiful trim;</L>
<L>And I think she has made him so gloomy a slave,</L>
<L>She has pent her good man in Trophonius's cave.</L>
<L>Such to him was the temple of Hymen; for after</L>
<L>He enter'd its vestibule,—farewell to laughter.</L>
</SP>

<PB N="120" REF="121"/>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why, Harriot! you really are quite acrimonious:</L>
<L>But if you call wedlock the cave of Trophonius;</L>
<L>Have a care, if that cavern you chance to step near!</L>
<L>You love laughing too well to resign it, my dear.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>And therefore, tho' woo'd like the nymph of Toboso,</L>
<L>I never will marry an old virtuoso,</L>
<L>Who thinks himself blest with taste, science, and worth,</L>
<L>Because he picks up all the odd things on earth.—</L>
<L>When a passion for art, or for nature, is join'd</L>
<L>With a warm friendly heart, and a liberal mind,</L>
<L>I respect the pure taste which that union produces,</L>
<L>Free from vanity's sordid fantastic abuses.</L>
<L>Tho' I do not possess it, I see and commend</L>
<L>Such taste, dear Papa, both in you and your friend;</L>
<L>But I view with an utter contempt, I confess,</L>
<L>Those who awkwardly ape what you really possess:</L>
<L>And for Mrs. Bijou, she has just as much soul</L>
<L>As a monkey, who carries queer things to its hole:</L>
<L>She with wonderful gusto, half Gothic, half Dutch,</L>
<L>Like an old squirrel, hides all she can in her hutch.</L>

<L>Pray, since we together her closet inspected,</L>
<L>What whimsical rarities has she collected?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>O, before I could count half the baubles she buys,</L>
<L>I could tell you the name of each star in the skies:</L>
<L>Her sphere is too wide for my genius to scan it;</L>
<L>But I know what she reckons her Georgian planet,</L>
<L>Her newly-found star—which to-night, if you're free,</L>
<L>Thro' a glass she perhaps may allow you to see.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>What wonder is this?—is it flesh, fish, or fowl?</L>
<L>A Lilliput dog? or a Brobdignag owl?</L>
<L>Or is it a remnant from Joseph's odd coat?</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>It is something once held by a person of note</L>
<L>In our island; and now I defy you to guess.</L>

<L>Is it Essex's ring? or the ruff of Queen Bess?</L>

<L>I can never forget what I owe to your care,</L>

<L>In truth, my dear Tom, I am quite of your mind,</L>
<L>There is no better scheme for the good of mankind;</L>

<L>Why no nymph has supply'd the lost love of my youth:</L>
<L>There is one, whose mild virtue and elegant grace,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>DEAR Papa, don't betray me!—her delicate mind</L>
<L>Would be wounded, I know, and would think me unkind:</L>
<L>So far from allowing, what now I impart,</L>
<L>She herself little knows the true state of her heart.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Believe me, my dear, I with pleasure survey</L>
<L>The sisterly fondness you warmly display.</L>
<L><PB N="139" REF="140"/>
But you, who for others so sensibly feel,</L>
<L>May here be the dupe of affectionate zeal;</L>
<L>And I hope you're mistaken.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>My dear Sir, observe!</L>
<L>You may trace her attachment in every nerve:</L>
<L>If I name Mr. Beril in some idle tale,</L>
<L>Poor Fanny will blush, and as often turn pale.</L>
<L>In his absence still more and more pensive she grows,</L>
<L>Yet thinks not from whence her uneasiness flows.</L>
<L>And when he returns, tho' her pleasure is meek,</L>
<L>Yet the glow of content may be seen on her cheek</L>
<L>And her heart, as if fully consol'd by his sight,</L>
<L>Appears to repose in a tranquil delight.</L>
<L>Dear Papa, you'll perceive, if you'll open your eyes,</L>
<L>That from none but herself she her love can disguise.</L>
<L>One other exception perhaps we may find,</L>
<L>As I think Mr: Beril is equally blind,</L>
<L>And robb'd, like herself, of the talent of seeing,</L>
<L>By that diffident love, which denies its own being.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>I hope this attachment, which neither has shewn,</L>
<L>Exists, my good girl, in your fancy alone.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why so, my dear Sir?—Should it prove as you fear,</L>
<L>I hope, dear Papa, that you won't be severe.</L>
<L>Consider the delicate frame of my sister!</L>
<L>But I know you've a heart that can never resist her,</L>
<L>If you once clearly see she has fixt her affection,</L>
<L>Tho' she own not her wishes for such a connection;</L>
<L>As you know that her nature's so modest and meek,</L>
<L>She would die from concealment before she would speak.</L>
<L>I have strength to encounter the crosses of life,</L>
<L>And to make my part good, as a daughter or wife:</L>
<L>But our gentle sweet Frances is ill-form'd to bear</L>
<L>The undeserv'd load of vexation and care;</L>
<L>And therefore should wed, unregardful of pelf,</L>
<L>A husband as tender and mild as herself.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your reasoning, I think, is not perfectly just.</L>
<L>In the kindness of Beril perhaps I might trust;</L>
<L>But the motive you urge for this union, my dear,</L>
<L>Is what, I confess, would awaken my fear.</L>
<L>As you say, your mild sister should never be harrass'd</L>
<L>By those various ills with which life is embarrass'd,</L>
<L><PB N="141" REF="142"/>
I should guard her from all the vexations that wait</L>
<L>On a liberal mind with a narrow estate:</L>
<L>And if Beril had thoughts of becoming my son,</L>
<L>Had I <HI>not</HI> more objections, yet this must be one.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'll remove it, my Lord, for indeed this is all:</L>
<L>As you think they'll be pinch'd by an income too small,</L>
<L>You shall add to their fortune, and large it will be,</L>
<L>Two thirds of the portion you've destin'd for me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Dear Harriot! I'm charm'd with thy soul, I confess;</L>
<L>Thou'rt a generous girl—to a noble excess.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>To that name, dear Papa, I've no title, indeed,</L>
<L>As I only give up what I never can need.</L>
<L>In your house all my wants will, I know, be supply'd;</L>
<L>And if I should leave it, as Careless's bride,</L>
<L>The liberal heir of so large an estate</L>
<L>Will not grieve that my fortune has sunk in its weight.</L>
<L>Or should my swain frown at the change in my purse,</L>
<L>He may e'en take old Themis for better for worse;</L>
<L>For tho', I confess, he has won my regard,</L>
<L>Yet the knot of my love is not twisted so hard,</L>
<L><PB N="142" REF="143"/>
But 'twill slip in a moment, if ever I see</L>
<L>That he's rather more fond of my purse than of me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis a pity, the friendly illusions of youth</L>
<L>Cannot instantly turn into substance and truth.</L>
<L>Your affectionate fancy, my dear, is delighted</L>
<L>With the dream of beholding two persons united,</L>
<L>Whom you fondly suppose only form'd for each other.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>I should like Mr. Beril, I own, for my brother,</L>
<L>Because I'm convinc'd, that no mortal on earth,</L>
<L>In manners, in temper, in taste, and in worth,</L>
<L>Is form'd so exactly to suit such a wife.</L>
<L>On their lasting attachment I'd venture my life.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your warm heart, my good girl, your young judg∣ment deceives,</L>
<L>And what the first wishes the second believes.</L>
<L>Dear Harriot, to <HI>this</HI> fancied match there may be</L>
<L>Many bars, which your eyes are unable to see:</L>
<L>A mistress conceal'd, with a young little fry—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Should an angel declare it, the fact I'd deny;</L>
<L><PB N="143" REF="144"/>
For had Beril been loaded with such a connection,</L>
<L>In his eyes I had never perceiv'd his affection.</L>
<L>But I'll presently solve any doubts of this kind,</L>
<L>As I'm soon to be told the true state of his mind;</L>
<L>For Careless has promis'd—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>O fie! my dear, fie!</L>
<L>Your intemperate zeal has now risen too high.</L>
<L>I am really concern'd at your great indiscretion.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nay! but hear me, my Lord!—I have dropt no ex∣pression,</L>
<L>No! not one single hint, that could truly discover</L>

<L>But I trust, dear Papa, that your generous mind</L>
<L>Will not now press the bargain he once has declin'd;</L>

<L>Often injure a child by the frolicks of age,</L>
<L>That you may not suffer from follies like these,</L>
<L>I have just now consign'd to the care of trustees</L>

<HEAD>LORD RUSSEL; A TRAGEDY, OF THREE ACTS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="preface">
<PB REF="163"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE endeavoured to delineate, in the following Drama, an exact portrait of the noble Personage, whose name it bears; as I believe, that a more enga∣ging model of public and private virtue can hardly be selected from the annals of any nation: although the ex∣treme mildness of his temper, the simplicity of his man∣ners, and, above all, his unaffected piety, are such qua∣lities, as are very rarely admitted in the formation of a Tragic Hero.</P>
<P>To render my performance interesting to my country, I have adhered as closely to our history, as the nature of dramatic composition allowed me to do; and in points where I have varied from historical truth, such varia∣tions are, I trust, supported by dramatic probability.</P>
<P>In the spirited and judicious introduction to the lately-published letters of Lady Russel, the testimony of different Historians in collected concerning the senti∣ments of Charles the Second and his brother, on the impending fate of Lord Russel.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="164"/>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In the Duke of Monmouth's Journal, it is said, that the King told him, he inclined to have saved the Lord Russel, but was forced to consent to his death, otherwise he must have broke with his bro∣ther the Duke of York."</Q><BIBL>—Kennet.</BIBL></P>
<P>The sentence just quoted, is, I hope, a sufficient foun∣dation for the conduct which I have assigned to Charles; whose character indeed was such, that fiction can hardly impute to him any instance of irresolution, duplicity, and falsehood, which the tenor of his life will not bring within the limits of theatrical credibility.</P>
<P>The candid reader will readily allow the liberty I have taken, in laying the scene in the Tower, after Russel's condemnation; as it affords many advantages to the conduct of the play.</P>
<P>In compliance with that respect, which dramatic authors have lately paid to the Clerical character, I have not introduced either Tillotson or Burnet among the persons of the drama, though the latter was so con∣stant an attendant on the captivity of my Hero; an omission which I have in some degree supplied, by the introduction of Mr. Spencer; a character drawn from the printed trial of Lord Russel, where the name of that gentleman appears in the list of those,
<PB N="165" REF="165"/>
who gave an honourable evidence in behalf of the noble prisoner.</P>
<P>I have many obligations to the journal written by Burnet, at the request of Lady Russel, which contains all the minute circumstances that occurred, during the imprisonment, and at the execution of her Lord. This very interesting and pathetic narrative is printed in the General Dictionary, under the article Russel. I have not only taken from it many of the sentiments, which I have assigned to him in this Tragedy, but I have some∣times adopted the very words, that were really uttered by Lord Russel; and this I have done, not only from an affectionate admiration of his character, but from a despair of surpassing the elegant simplicity, and the force of his expression.</P>
<P>The offer relating to his escape, so generously made, and so nobly refused, is a fact universally known, and must render the names of Cavendish and Russel an honour to our country, as long as magnanimity and friendship retain their just value in the estimation of mankind.</P>

<L>My tender child!</L>
<L>Thanks to thy filial aid! my strength returns,</L>
<L>And my reviving soul has gather'd force</L>
<L>To bear the killing sight.—'Tis true, when first</L>
<L>I saw my mild and unoffending son,</L>
<L><PB N="168" REF="168"/>
Pride of my age! and England's dear resource</L>
<L>In these disastrous days! when I beheld</L>
<L>My blameless Russel at that bar arraign'd,</L>
<L>Where only guilt and infamy should stand;</L>
<L>When I beheld each servile judge support</L>
<L>A lawless jury basely fram'd against him,</L>
<L>Indignant anguish robb'd my wounded heart</L>
<L>Of vital energy: quick from the court</L>
<L>My hasty friends hurried my senseless frame,</L>
<L>To this our quiet home: but since, my daughter,</L>
<L>Thy kind endearing cares have now restor'd me,</L>
<L>I will resume my station by thy brother,</L>
<L>In these distressful moments:—to his side</L>
<L>Affection calls me, and paternal duty.</L>

<SPEAKER>LADY MARGARET.</SPEAKER>
<L>Forgive me, that I dare to thwart your wish,</L>
<L>But from my generous brother I've receiv'd</L>
<L>A kind injunction to detain your age</L>
<L>From that afflicting scene. He has engag'd</L>
<L>To tell us, by repeated messengers,</L>
<L>Each petty circumstance that passes there.</L>
<L>Already from the number of his friends</L>

<SPEAKER>SPENCER.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, my dear lord.</L>
<L>England is yet unsullied with the stain</L>
<L>That must disgrace her, if the sword of Justice</L>
<L>Turns to the murderous dagger of Revenge,</L>
<L>To stab your virtuous son.—By his request</L>
<L>I come to soothe your anxious sufferings,</L>
<L>And to relate the process of a scene,</L>
<L>Where he conjures you to appear no more.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD.</SPEAKER>
<L>What perjur'd slaves have they suborn'd against him?</L>
<L>How far has truth been wrong'd, and law been tortur'd,</L>
<L>To frame those snares of legal death, in which</L>
<L>They labor to involve incautious virtue?</L>
<L>Have they not dealt most hardly with my son?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SPENCER.</SPEAKER>
<L>He has experienc'd subtle cruelty</L>
<L>From venal ruffians in the robes of justice;</L>
<L>But the base wrong his patient worth endures,</L>
<L>Is the dark foil which gives the diamond lustre.</L>
<L><PB N="170" REF="170"/>
When he requested aid for his defence,</L>
<L>His keen insidious foes, who strongly fear'd</L>
<L>Some upright advocate might save their victim,</L>
<L>Enjoin'd him to employ a servant's hand.</L>
<L>There rose indeed a servant at his side,</L>
<L>Most eager for the task; but O! what words</L>
<L>Can speak the fond surprize, and thrilling anguish,</L>
<L>Which shook the bosom of each sad spectator,</L>
<L>Who in that servant saw his lovely wife?</L>
<L>The crowd, with eyes bedimm'd by starting tears</L>
<L>Of tenderest admiration, gaz'd upon her,</L>
<L>And murmur'd kindest prayers, as they beheld</L>
<L>Connubial love, in that angelic form,</L>

<L>Do not, dear father, do not yield so soon</L>
<L>To comfortless despair!—we yet may hope</L>
<L>The radiant probity of Russel's life</L>
<L>Will dissipate each dark and dangerous cloud</L>
<L>That perjur'd Calumny can raise around him.</L>
<L>Remember all the candor of his mind!</L>
<L>Think how his temperate virtues have been prais'd</L>

<L>And abject terror, when did such a spirit</L>
<L>Respect the virtue, Nature made its foe,</L>
<L>And treacherous Fortune gave it power to crush?</L>
<L>But tell me of the scene from whence you come!</L>
<L>Say! what has been alledg'd against my son?</L>
<L>I have been told the fierce and subtle Jefferies,</L>
<L>The Duke's base agent in this bloody business,</L>
<L>Relies upon the evidence of Howard,</L>
<L>As the sure instrument of Russel's death:</L>
<L>Unprincipled he is, and prone to utter</L>
<L>What interest and fear may bid him swear.</L>
<L>What has he said? or is he yet unsummon'd?</L>

<SPEAKER>SPENCER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Before I left your son, the faithless Howard</L>
<L>Began his artful tale; but soon he falter'd,</L>
<L>With feign'd affliction of a dread event,</L>
<L>Which suddenly was rumour'd through the court,</L>
<L>And struck the throng'd assembly with such wonder,</L>
<L>Malice stood mute, and Persecution paus'd.</L>
<L>Fresh from the Tower the tidings came, that Essex,</L>
<L>From terrors of that bar, where Russel stood,</L>

<L>Thou knowest not th' inexorable hate</L>

<L>Have doom'd me to the scaffold, on the plea</L>
<L><PB N="185" REF="185"/>
That I have plotted to destroy my sovereign,</L>
<L>Though Heaven and thou, who knowest all my soul,</L>
<L>See the base falshood of the bloody charge:</L>
<L>But to the voice of Law, however tortur'd,</L>
<L>I owe a prompt obedience; nought remains</L>
<L>But that I meet the stroke of stern Oppression</L>
<L>As suits the votary of Public Virtue.</L>
<L>I must not sully, by a base submission,</L>
<L>A name yet spotless, the sole legacy</L>
<L>It is allow'd me to bequeath my children.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSSEL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Dear as I hold thy life, which is in truth</L>
<L>My only anchor in this sea of troubles,</L>

<L>Alas! my love, the cloud of thy affliction</L>

<SPEAKER>LADY RUSSEL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Dear Russel! exercise thy purer judgment;</L>
<L>These are not scruples of thy manly reason,</L>

<L>Of honor jealous to a vain excess.</L>
<L>How can the measure, that my love solicits,</L>
<L>Involve thee in disgrace? Without abasement,</L>

<L>Not by the popular arts of vain ambition,</L>
<L>(Which Nature never form'd me to possess)</L>
<L>But by incessant vigilance to shield</L>
<L>Our faith and freedom, by an ardent wish</L>
<L>To prove that patriot virtue, (the stale jest</L>
<L><PB N="187" REF="187"/>
Of servile spirits, as an empty name)</L>
<L>Is an existing vigorous principle</L>
<L>In minds of English temper. I have fail'd</L>
<L>In the prime object that my soul pursued,</L>
<L>To save our pure religion and our laws</L>
<L>From Bigotry's encroachment; and I lose</L>
<L>My life, endanger'd by that noble conflict:</L>

<L>The kind esteem of this enlighten'd nation:</L>
<L>This I must forfeit, forfeit all the praise</L>

<L>I strove to shelter this devoted land.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSSEL.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, Russel; the corrupted lips of Faction</L>
<L>Are prone to evil: but the voice of ages,</L>

<L>And by that sentence thou art sure to stand</L>

<L>PRAY temper with patience your warm indig∣nation,</L>

<L>My patience, sweet Frances, I own is exhausted:</L>
<L>She will wed the first suitor by whom she's accosted,</L>
<L>Though in widowhood's dainty vagaries, her pride</L>
<L>Forbids her fair cousin to shine as a bride;</L>
<L><PB N="244" REF="243"/>
And keeps us, my Love, from that altar away,</L>
<L>Where Hymen with justice-upbraids our delay.</L>
<L>But, in noble contempt of your unsettled dower,</L>
<L>Let us seize on the bliss that is plac'd in our power;</L>

<L>Leave my Lady to play off fresh fountains of grief,</L>

<L>Though my income is small, with your prudent di∣rection,</L>
<L>Dear Fanny—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANCES.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'm pleas'd with this proof of affection:</L>
<L>Yet before we our union, dear Carey, complete,</L>
<L>As your love is so ardent—let mine be discreet.</L>
<L>No honest return of regard should I feel,</L>
<L>Could I suffer your heart, in its generous zeal,</L>
<L>To abandon a portion your bride should obtain,</L>
<L>And hazard by hurry what patience will gain.</L>
<L>'Tis unlucky, my cousin, Sir Simon, forgot</L>
<L>To specify what he design'd as my lot:</L>
<L>But I know this omission, by which I am left</L>
<L>At her Ladyship's mercy, of fortune bereft,</L>

Was the work of Old Vellum, whose foresight and skill</L>

<SPEAKER>CAREY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Good God! my dear Fanny, how can you defend her?</L>
<L>To refinement and faith she's an empty pretender.</L>
<L>Have not twelve months elaps'd from Sir Simon's interment?</L>
<L>Yet her sorrow still bubbles in ludicrous ferment;</L>
<L>Though the farce of her grief, as our friends have all said,</L>
<L>Is address'd to the living much more than the dead;</L>

<L>Indeed you mistake all her harmless intentions;</L>
<L>She will certainly give me the fortune she mentions;</L>
<L><PB N="246" REF="245"/>
I know her kind heart, and its pure inclination.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAREY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Say rather, we know her absurd affectation:</L>
<L>And as for your portion, my dear, I as soon</L>
<L>Shall expect an estate to drop out of the moon,</L>
<L>As to see you receive from my Lady a shilling;</L>
<L>Allowing, indeed, that her heart may be willing,</L>
<L>She soon will have nothing, I fear, to bestow,</L>
<L>So profuse is she grown in her whimsical woe.</L>
<L>On the new Mausoleum what sums does she waste!</L>
<L>That fantastical fabric of barbarous taste;</L>
<L>Where all decorations that art can devise,</L>
<L>To adorn the proud tombs of the valiant and wise,</L>
<L>Are mix'd o'er the bones of a simple old cit,</L>
<L>Who display'd not a sparkle of valor or wit;</L>

<L>A mere slave to the whims of his high-blooded wife.</L>

<L>That preposterous vault I have view'd with concern!</L>

<L>But at length, having study'd her Ladyship's trim,</L>
<L>And loving her virtue in spite of her whim,</L>
<L><PB N="247" REF="246"/>
I've a scheme, that, I think, with success will be crown'd,</L>
<L>On this folly itself her correction to found;</L>
<L>By indulging her foible, that foible to banish,</L>
<L>And make all her mournful absurdity vanish.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAREY.</SPEAKER>
<L>To your judgment, dear Fanny, I often submit,</L>
<L>And much could I hope from your goodness and wit;</L>
<L>Yet I think you can't make, in her youth's giddy season,</L>
<L>Such a vain wanton widow a creature of reason.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANCES.</SPEAKER>
<L>You judges of nature, and lords of creation,</L>
<L>Howe'er you pretend to profound speculation,</L>
<L>Are exceedingly apt your wise selves to deceive</L>
<L>In the judgments you pass on the daughters of Eve;</L>
<L>And most when you reckon, in every transaction,</L>
<L>One indelicate foible their sole spring of action.</L>
<L>My Lady Sophia you greatly mistake;</L>
<L>By nature she's neither a prude nor a rake:</L>
<L>At present, I own, she appears too demure;</L>
<L>But though her heart's tender, her bosom is pure:</L>
<L>To a strong understanding she makes no pretence,</L>
<L>But has many mild virtues, and does not want sense;</L>
<L><PB N="248" REF="247"/>
One foible alone has o'erclouded her mind,</L>
<L>The foible of seeming supremely refin'd:</L>
<L>But if I succeed, this slight fault she will mend,</L>
<L>And you'll find her a worthy agreeable friend.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>You may say of her purity what you think fit,</L>

<L>Believe me, whene'er a young widow's so prim,</L>
<L>And by quaint affectation so cramp'd in each limb,</L>
<L>A new husband alone, by his pliant embrace,</L>
<L>Can restore her starch'd form to its natural grace:</L>
<L>Is this, my fair Quack! the new nostrum you've got?</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>Indeed you shan't hear any part of my plot,</L>

</SP>
<SP>

<L>Ah! my dear, I'm afraid</L>
<L>This is some coy device my request to evade,</L>
<L>And to keep the wish'd day of our wedding still distant.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANCES.</SPEAKER>
<L>No; in truth, by the aid of a secret assistant,</L>
<L>I've a plan of great moment in high agitation,</L>
<L>Which may happily end all our various vexation:</L>
<L><PB N="249" REF="248"/>
Allow me three days for its perfect digestion,</L>
<L>And if in that time you will ask me no question,</L>
<L>I promise thenceforth, without murmur or strife,</L>
<L>To obey your commands for the rest of my life.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAREY.</SPEAKER>
<L>I gladly subscribe to this bargain of bliss;</L>
<L>So allow me to seal the kind bond with a kiss!</L>
<L>Remember, three days; I can't add a day more,</L>
<L>And shall fancy those three in duration threescore.</L>

<L>O they'll pass very quick:—much amus'd you will be</L>
<L>With the three rival Bards whom to-day we shall see;</L>
<L>To whom my sad cousin oblig'd me to write</L>
<L>For sepulchral inscriptions in praise of her Knight:</L>
<L>They have sent each an epitaph hither before 'em,</L>
<L>And are coming themselves with all solemn decorum.</L>
<L>As each, without contest, expects here the laurel,</L>
<L>On her Ladyship's judgment they'll probably quarrel:</L>
<L>As you know the whole group, you must wait on the choir,</L>
<L>To soothe the irascible sons of the Lyre.</L>

<L>As to Facil and Trope, if they're hurt, I'll engage</L>
<L>That one glance of your eyes will extinguish their rage:</L>

You will find them two chearful and good-humour'd lads:</L>
<L>And, whether their Pegasus gallops or pads,</L>
<L>It will please me, I own, if her Ladyship's fancies</L>
<L>May tend to recruit their declining finances:</L>
<L>But for splenetic Rumble, who, grandly absurd,</L>
<L>Never speaks without using a six-footed word,</L>
<L>I care not how much he is mortified here.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANCES.</SPEAKER>
<L>But the length of his words hits her Ladyship's ear.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAREY.</SPEAKER>
<L>His stiff phrases indeed may accord with her sorrow,</L>
<L>Yet his spleen will insult her ere this time to-morrow;</L>
<L>For often he'll call, with quaint arrogant vanity,</L>
<L>Every head but his own the abode of inanity:</L>
<L>Because a great author's defects he has caught,</L>
<L>He vainly pretends to his vigor of thought;</L>
<L>Though, on similar grounds, he as well might suppose,</L>
<L>That, because some dark spots may be seen on his nose,</L>
<L>His face has the lustre and force of the sun.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANCES.</SPEAKER>
<L>In our chorus of Bards I am glad he is one,</L>
<L>For I'm curious, I own, the strange elf to survey;</L>
<L>Though I'm rather afraid of his wife, who, they say,</L>

<L>Sometimes, on the road,</L>
<L>My dear Mr. Rumble composes an ode;</L>
<L>For he says, in such motion his fancy shines most;</L>
<L>And all true lyric poets, you know, travel post:</L>
<L>But a chaise-boy, alas! is a sad ignoramus;</L>

<L>Mistook a Pindarical ejaculation</L>

<L>Dear Ma'am, not at all:</L>

<L>My wife has, I think, the right feminine nerve:</L>

<L>They have nothing to do but to venerate ours.</L>

<SPEAKER>MR. RUMBLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>I cannot read one, Sir, without oscitation:</L>
<L>They don't understand antithetic vibration;</L>
<L>Their ideas have nothing of height and profundity,</L>
<L>Their conceptions want vigor, their periods rotun∣dity;</L>
<L>Their truth is too stale, or too feeble their fiction,</L>
<L>And I cannot endure their anomalous diction:</L>
<L>But enough of these garrulous wasters of ink—</L>
<L>Her Ladyship likes my inscription, I think;</L>
<L>That lugubrious poem no critic shall garble,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAREY.</SPEAKER>
<L>It would please me to give you that pleasure, dear Sir;</L>
<L>But, in truth, on this point there's a little demur,</L>
<L>Her Ladyship means to consult on the case.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. RUMBLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>What, Sir! is my poem expos'd to disgrace?</L>
<L>Her critical quacks does this woman engage,</L>

<L>Believe me, good Sir, all the homage that's due</L>

But her Ladyship's love for Sir Simon is such,</L>
<L>She thinks that he cannot be honour'd too much;</L>
<L>And, to give all his virtues their due celebration,</L>
<L>She from diverse poetical pens of our nation</L>

<L>Hah! is it so!</L>

<L>This should have been told me before;—but no matter:</L>

<L>Yet in funeral song they can't equal my tone;</L>
<L>Where Pope has miscarried, I triumph alone.—</L>
<L>Pray who are these Bards that with me are to cope?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAREY.</SPEAKER>
<L>I think you're acquainted with Facil and Trope.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. RUMBLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>What, Facil! whose verse is the thread of tenuity,</L>
<L>That fellow distinguish'd by flippant fatuity,</L>
<L>Who nonsense and rhyme can incessantly mingle,</L>
<L>A poet—if poetry's only a jingle.</L>

<L>Poor Facil wants force; yet may frequently please</L>

<L><PB N="264" REF="263"/>
But Trope's lofty muse has a higher pretension.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. RUMBLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sir! Trope is a rhymer devoid of invention,</L>
<L>Who talks in a high strutting style of the stars,</L>
<L>And the eagle of Jove, and the chariot of Mars;</L>
<L>And pompously tells, in elaborate lines,</L>
<L>That now the moon glistens, and now the sun shines.</L>

<SPEAKER>MR. RUMBLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>I cannot agree</L>

<L>Mr. Rumble! in points so exceedingly nice</L>
<L>I do not presume to obtrude my advice;</L>

<L>What may tend to encourage your liberal art.</L>
<L><PB N="265" REF="264"/>
Sir Simon, you know, had a passion for fame,</L>
<L>And left a large sum to eternize his name</L>
<L>By some structure of note; yet he never said what:</L>
<L>So a grand Mausoleum is rais'd on this spot,</L>
<L>At so vast an expence that my Lady, I find,</L>
<L>Has surpast what the Knight for the building design'd;</L>
<L>The superfluous cost, be it great as it may,</L>
<L>From her own private purse she designs to defray;</L>
<L>Though an annual fund by the will is adjusted,</L>
<L>With the guidance of which she is also entrusted;</L>
<L>But from this, as I hear, she has form'd an intention</L>
<L>To give the best epitaph-writer a pension.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. RUMBLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Has she so!—'tis a gracious, effulgent design;</L>
<L>I protest, of her judgment I highly opine.</L>
<L>Her face has been chiefly the subject of praise;</L>
<L>But a splendor of intellect now she displays.</L>
<L>I cannot abruptly depart from a scene</L>
<L>Whose mistress discovers the mind of a queen,</L>
<L>Nor rudely desert, though my time is precarious,</L>
<L>A lady whose graces are so multifarious:</L>
<L>But pray, lest some puppy should here circumvent me,</L>
<L>To her Ladyship can't you directly present me?</L>

<L>If you'll step in this room, which is call'd the Apollo,</L>
<L>And wait a few minutes, I'll speedily follow,</L>
<L>And acquaint you how soon we may hope for admis∣sion;—</L>
<L>My Lady loves form, in her present condition:</L>
<L>To amuse yourself there you'll, however, be able,</L>

<L>In truth 'tis a niggardly soil, at the best,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAREY.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know she has paid due respect to your lyres;</L>
<L>Yet, indeed, on that title no thanks can I claim;</L>
<L>You're indebted alone to your common friend, Fame:</L>
<L>Her Ladyship knows with what spirit you write,</L>

<L>So we are, my good friend,</L>

<L>'Tis perfectly true;</L>

<L>That's a worthy old creature, though rather too flow;</L>
<L>He is trusty, and will not betray us, I know:</L>
<L>But though he's secure, I still shudder to think</L>
<L>How my hopes in a moment to nothing may sink.</L>
<L>As the crisis comes on, in a hazardous scheme,</L>
<L>With what infinite terrors the fancy will teem!—</L>
<L>In my hopes of the match I was sanguine and hearty;</L>
<L>But I now have my fears in regard to each party.</L>
<L>Should my Gentleman turn out too squeamish and coy,</L>
<L>How vain the kind art I have deign'd to employ!</L>
<L>Should my Lady shew family-pride, at this season,</L>
<L>I've depended in vain upon Nature and Reason.</L>
<L><PB N="277" REF="276"/>
I have studied her well, and I clearly descry</L>
<L>She's destin'd again to the conjugal tie:</L>
<L>In spite of the whims false refinement has taught her,</L>
<L>She is honest dame Nature's benevolent daughter:</L>
<L>Though a truly good creature, in virtue so strong</L>
<L>She would not for the world do a thing she thinks wrong,</L>
<L>Yet of such yielding wax her soft bosom is form'd,</L>
<L>It will melt in a moment, if properly warm'd;</L>
<L>Provided her fancy, affectedly nice,</L>
<L>Can delude her kind heart with some dainty device,</L>
<L>Some delicate plea for becoming a wife</L>
<L>To the youth, who conjures her to bless him for life.</L>
<L>On this I have founded my whimsical plan,</L>
<L>In hopes of producing this fortunate man:</L>
<L>My brother, I know, has a passion for her;</L>
<L>And she soon to all men would his person prefer.</L>
<L>But in my rapid project he will not be steady,</L>
<L>Unless I persuade him she loves him already;</L>
<L>For men rarely know, tho' of knowledge they're vain,</L>
<L>By a well-manag'd minute how much they may gain.</L>
<L>And should he detect the kind art I employ,</L>
<L>Farewell to my hopes of their conjugal joy!—</L>
<L><PB N="278" REF="277"/>
I yesterday thought that my plan could not fail;</L>
<L>Now I think 'twill be marvellous should it prevail.—</L>

<L>Heaven bless thee, dear girl!—you have got me once more,</L>

<L>'Tis a tribute my heart is inclin'd to revere;</L>
<L>All flattering language I prize them above,</L>
<L>And hold them the truest expression of love:</L>
<L>And indeed, when I think what distress and regret</L>
<L>Have harrass'd your sensible mind since we met;</L>
<L>When I think how, from sordid self-interest free,</L>
<L>You forget your own wrongs in attention to me;</L>
<L>I feel tears of gratitude ready to start,</L>

<L>For Russia, you know, I departed from Rome;</L>
<L>However, my dear, you may safely presume</L>
<L>Such an absence from you I could never endure,</L>
<L>Had you not brought me back by a different lure;</L>

And my friends of the Law with your wishes conspir'd,</L>
<L>To make me return with the haste you desir'd,</L>
<L>As they give me some hopes of soon changing our fate,</L>
<L>And regaining from Vellum the pilfer'd estate.—</L>
<L>But how fares my dear widow? whose partial affection</L>
<L>Seems kindled by some friendly angel's direction,</L>
<L>To redress half our wrongs, and defeat the old thief</L>
<L>Who impos'd on Sir Simon's too simple belief.</L>
<L>A rascal! to feign a regard for my fame,</L>
<L>And steal my estate, not to injure my name.</L>
<L>I thought not my cousin so easy a fool;</L>
<L>How the deuce could old Vellum so make him his tool!</L>
<L>For the Knight, on this plea, sign'd his will when in health,</L>
<L>Not to spoil a great artist by giving me wealth.—</L>
<L>But where's my kind widow?—I long to express—</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>Not so fast, my dear brother; you surely forget</L>
<L>By what vigilant enemies we are beset!</L>
<L>Should Vellum, whose spies are now under this roof,</L>
<L>And against whose vile art no affection is proof,</L>
<L>Should he get the least hint of my Lady's attachment,</L>
<L>He would rage like the wolf in that new-painted hatchment;</L>
<L>Your mutual regard he would set at defiance,</L>

<L>Would he so?—By my faith, as the widow's so kind,</L>
<L>I care not what mischiefs may lurk in his mind;</L>

<L>Shall mar the sweet business her heart has con∣ducted.—</L>

<L>And our true situation I'll honestly mention:</L>
<L>But, however my project may strike you at first,</L>
<L>Into rage and despair do not hastily burst;</L>

<L>Have patience!—her state you shall soon understand.</L>
<L>That she loves you, I know; and with innocent art</L>
<L>I have cherish'd the passion still hid in her heart:</L>
<L>For she fancies, good creature! that, safe from love's flashes,</L>
<L>She's devoted for life to Sir Simon's cold ashes.—</L>
<L>You know, she affects to be highly refin'd:</L>
<L>And a project I've built on this cast of her mind,</L>
<L>Which, if you'll obey me, I'll venture my life,</L>
<L>Like a stroke of true magic, will make her your wife,</L>
<L>And before any soul can suspect our intention.</L>

<L>You are like her Sir Simon in soul as in form,</L>

<L>No, no, I'll relate to you all the affair.—</L>
<L>You must know that our punch had so heated my brain,</L>

<L>But was just in a slumber, between three and four,</L>

<L>"Rise! rise! or you'll surely be burnt in your bed!"</L>

<L>The wild little wench, like a poor frighted hare,</L>
<L>Knew not which way to run, and did nothing but stare;</L>
<L>When, holding the door of my chamber a-jar,</L>
<L>We perceiv'd, by the aid of the bright morning-star,</L>
<L>The old Bard, who of liquor had taken his fill,</L>
<L>Sally forth from his quarters in odd dishabille;</L>
<L>With punch and with poetry heated, he swaggers,</L>
<L>And reels down the stairs, like a horse in the staggers,</L>
<L>Repeating with emphasis, several times,</L>
<L>The unfortunate word in his dangerous rhymes;</L>

<L>No, indeed; had her panic been only affected,</L>

<L>Or, with potent illusion and artful pretences,</L>
<L>Has this fair little sorceress cheated our senses?</L>

<L>You may trust in her magic, as honest and true;</L>
<L>She has render'd me happy, and so she will you:</L>
<L>To you, my dear Carey, I give her for life;</L>
<L>So enchanting a sister must prove a sweet wife;</L>
<L>And, with pleasure I add, you'll receive your fair Bride</L>
<L>With the fortune she merits completely supplied.</L>

<SPEAKER>JASPER <HI>(to</HI> Facil <HI>and</HI> Trope.)</SPEAKER>
<L>My worthy old friends! in this fortunate hour</L>
<L>It increases my joy to meet you on this spot.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FACIL.</SPEAKER>
<L>I rejoice in your bliss!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TROPE.</SPEAKER>
<L>I am charm'd with your lot!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JASPER.</SPEAKER>
<L>And with double delight the good fortune I view,</L>
<L>Which may prove I retain a warm friendship for you:</L>
<L>I've a scheme for ye both, my dear Facil and Trope,</L>
<L>That will meet with your hearty concurrence, I hope.</L>
<L>You must yield to my wish—I will not be denied</L>
<L>From any vain scruples of generous pride.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="314" REF="313"/>
<SPEAKER>FACIL.</SPEAKER>
<L>With hearts so enliven'd by seeing you blest,</L>
<L>We shall hardly refuse whatsoe'er you request.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JASPER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Though a few dainty whims, of a singular kind,</L>
<L>Have o'erclouded the worth of her excellent mind,</L>
<L>The soul of my Lady Sophia is fraught</L>
<L>With the true mental pleasures of generous thought.</L>
<L>She perceives, and disclaims for the rest of her days,</L>
<L>The foibles to which false refinement betrays:</L>
<L>She now thinks this proud fabric of ill-applied art</L>
<L>The ridiculous whim of too feeling a heart.</L>
<L>Sir Simon had many calm virtues, whose claim</L>
<L>From ungrateful Oblivion shall rescue his name:</L>
<L>But all the distinctions of rank are confus'd,</L>
<L>Fame herself is insulted, and Art is abus'd,</L>
<L>When the plume and the laurel insultingly wave</L>
<L>O'er the honest plain Merchant's preposterous grave:</L>
<L>Convinc'd of this truth, 'tis my Lady's design</L>
<L>To alter this dome on a new plan of mine.</L>
<L>Here with Freedom and Ease you, my friends, may reside;</L>
<L>Good apartments for each I shall quickly provide:</L>
<L><PB N="315" REF="314"/>
For this dome, where the Founder shall rise in a nich,</L>
<L>Is to prove an asylum for artists not rich.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAREY.</SPEAKER>
<L>I am charm'd with your project, dear Jasper!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JASPER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet hear:—</L>
<L>By the will there's a fund of four hundred a year</L>
<L>Of real hard cash, from incumbrances free,</L>
<L>Which my Lady herself is to guide as trustee,</L>
<L>To support any structure she chuses to plan,</L>
<L>To perpetuate the name of her worthy good man;</L>
<L>This between you, dear Bards, she is pleas'd to adjust:</L>
<L>And when opulent Honesty sinks in the dust,</L>
<L>May his heirs ever use what he leaves upon earth</L>
<L>In securing calm comfort to Genius and Worth!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FACIL.</SPEAKER>
<L>We always have said, and your actions evince,</L>
<L>You, Jasper, were born with the soul of a prince;</L>
<L>But our gratitude how shall we utter to you?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JASPER.</SPEAKER>
<L>By returning your thanks where they chiefly are due.</L>
<L>My Lady's pure bounty, that scorns to be stinted,</L>
<L>Surpast in your favour whatever I hinted.—</L>
<L><PB N="316" REF="315"/>
To prove that I wed not from motives of pelf,</L>
<L>I have settled her wealth on her generous self;</L>
<L>She is rich, and intends to make use of her treasure</L>
<L>In the purchase of noble and permanent pleasure:</L>
<L>At the highest of interest our gold we employ,</L>
<L>When it brings a return of benevolent joy.—</L>
<L>Thank my stars! all my wishes are crown'd with suc∣cess;</L>
<L>Kind Fortune, I just now have learn'd by express,</L>
<L>Outruns in our favor, the slow step of Law:</L>
<L>Old Vellum, alarm'd by our hints of a flaw</L>
<L>In the base legal work that Fraud led him to frame,</L>
<L>The reversion he stole has propos'd to disclaim,</L>
<L>Upon terms which I now, for tranquillity's sake,</L>
<L>At my Lady's request, shall be willing to take.—</L>
<L>But come, my good friends, let us haste to the hall,</L>
<L>Where the Bride will be happy to welcome you all.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAREY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well, my friend! I confess, in the course of my life,</L>
<L>I have oft been provok'd with your new lovely wife;</L>
<L>But for this her last act her late whims I forgive,</L>
<L>And shall bless the kind creature as long as I live.—</L>
<L>You will teach, as you mold her to life's sweetest duty,</L>
<L>All her virtues to shine as complete as her beauty:</L>
<L><PB N="317" REF="316"/>
And may each childless widow, in youth's lively state,</L>
<L>Who has yielded an honest old husband to fate,</L>
<L>In a partner like you find the surest relief,</L>
<L>And to sensible joy turn fantastical grief!</L>
