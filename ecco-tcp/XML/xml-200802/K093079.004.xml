<LG>
<L>INHERITANCE of weak, but proud Mortality,</L>
<L>Hence, Disease and pining Pain;</L>
<L>With all your pale and ghastly train,</L>
<L>Tossings dire, heart-piercing Moans,</L>
<L>Sighs, and Tears, and hollow Groans,</L>
<L>The harbingers of Death:</L>
<L>Whether ye be</L>
<L>The spawn of bloated Luxury,</L>
<L>Or of the pestilential breath</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4"/>
Of Eurus bred: or from the eastern clime:</L>
<L>Hence! to your ancient seat,</L>
<L>Where ebbing Nilus leaves his putrid slime,</L>
<L>To Volga's banks retreat,</L>
<L>Or to the Caspian, or Bengala's bay;</L>
<L>From Britain's happy lands</L>
<L>Haste to Arabian sands,</L>
<L>While winds sulphureous burn, and urge your way:</L>
<L>But, Goddess of the dimpled cheek,</L>
<L>Whom the wanton Cupids seek,</L>
<L>Come, fair Health, to grace the song,</L>
<L>Bring the chearful Muse along;</L>
<L>Bring laughing Youth, who looks behind;</L>
<L>Love on Fancy's breast reclin'd;</L>
<L>Wit, no poison'd dart who flings,</L>
<L>Or but retorts when Envy stings.</L>
<L>Come with antic Merriment,</L>
<L>And the placid child Content;</L>
<L>All with happy steps advance,</L>
<L>Join the song, and lead the dance.</L>
<L>Oft, O Goddess! let thy feet</L>
<L>Visit this my lone retreat;</L>
<L>Where my oak extends its pride</L>
<L>Of twisted arms; and fit to ride</L>
<L>Sublime on Neptune's swelling wave,</L>
<L>Now the roaring winds doth brave;</L>
<L>Where the vine's soft tendrils run,</L>
<L>And swell to meet the southern sun:</L>
<L>Where Contemplation, wont to stray,</L>
<L>Winds thro' the wood her easy way,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="5"/>
Or marks the lake, the field, or sky;</L>
<L>The silent Angler's stedfast eye;</L>
<L>The Gunner's aim: or Industry,</L>
<L>Who, with his loud resounding blow,</L>
<L>Lays the nodding forest low;</L>
<L>Or teaches where to wind the stream;</L>
<L>Or whistles to his labouring team:</L>
<L>The meads which suck the dews of morn;</L>
<L>Or uplands crown'd with golden corn,</L>
<L>Richer than Iberia's mine:</L>
<L>The bleating flocks; the lowing kine;</L>
<L>The smoking cots, and pointed spires,</L>
<L>The setting sun's reflecting fires;</L>
<L>Woods dark waving in the dale;</L>
<L>Rays which gleam; and clouds which sail;</L>
<L>Shades and lights by turns contending;</L>
<L>Gradual colours softly blending;</L>
<L>All as Nature's pencil clear</L>
<L>Marks the variegated year:</L>
<L>These, O Goddess! these are thine;</L>
<L>Offspring of immortal line;</L>
<L>Who with mortals deign'st to dwell,</L>
<L>In some low and rural cell:</L>
<L>To haunt the brink of tinkling rills;</L>
<L>The flowery vales, or sloping hills;</L>
<L>And when the plowman turns the soil,</L>
<L>To chear his song, and guide his toil.</L>
<L>With vest succinct in Dian's train</L>
<L>Oft art thou seen to brush the plain,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="6"/>
While thy shrill horns sweet Echo rouse,</L>
<L>Slumbering on the mountain's brows:</L>
<L>Oft when Winter clouds the air,</L>
<L>To the blazing hearth repair</L>
<L>Thy social feet, where-e'er the bowl</L>
<L>Of moderate Mirth unlocks the soul,</L>
<L>When tales of time, and ancient fear</L>
<L>Suspend the young astonish'd ear:</L>
<L>Or carrols quaint in long-drawn note</L>
<L>Swell the rustic's ample throat:</L>
<L>Or where high lifted steps resound,</L>
<L>When the peasant thumps the ground</L>
<L>With aukward heel; and gives a fall</L>
<L>To mistress of the rural ball:</L>
<L>Or presses with his iron hand,</L>
<L>And whirls her thro' the shouting band.</L>
<L>Nor art thou wont with these to sport</L>
<L>Alone: but where the Loves resort,</L>
<L>With all the young and shining train</L>
<L>Of Cytherea's golden reign,</L>
<L>More elegant, to lead is thine</L>
<L>The dance; which waves its easy line;</L>
<L>Marks the graceful, and the strong;</L>
<L>Where speech to which no words belong</L>
<L>Makes love by actions never pain'd,</L>
<L>All oppos'd, but nought constrain'd:</L>
<L>Movements mixing, swift, and slow,</L>
<L>And foot, ear, eye, together go.</L>
<L>Thus flush'd with all thy native charms,</L>
<L>My Delia spreads her winning arms,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="7"/>
Uplisted soft, and seems to tread</L>
<L>On yielding air, or ocean's bed:</L>
<L>And, as she grants her modest hand,</L>
<L>Damon's happy eyes demand,</L>
<L>While mov'd by her he seems to live,</L>
<L>The heart, which she half seems to gives</L>
<L>If these delights, O Goddess! wait</L>
<L>Ever on thy happy state,</L>
<L>Best of blessings understood,</L>
<L>Only source of mortal good;</L>
<L>Hither, bright Hygeia, fly</L>
<L>With rosy cheek, and sparkling eye,</L>
<L>Such as thou dost oft appear</L>
<L>When thy Heberden is near.</L>
<L>Rich with Nature's genuine grace,</L>
<L>Come, Goddess! to my warm embrace,</L>
<L>Far from all I fear, or hate;</L>
<L>From splendid life's delusive state,</L>
<L>Smiles that stab, or that betray:</L>
<L>Gloom of heart with visage gay;</L>
<L>Splender canker'd with distress,</L>
<L>Grandeur mix'd with littleness,</L>
<L>Words of wind, and hopes of air,</L>
<L>Clouds which threaten dark despair,</L>
<L>Craft disloyal to his trust,</L>
<L>Here High Birth licking low the dust,</L>
<L>There upstart Meanness set astride</L>
<L>The world, too narrow for his pride.</L>
<L>Far from Trade's too busy seat,</L>
<L>Of Loss and Gain the low deceit,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="8"/>
Aukward Pomp, and Vanity,</L>
<L>Who restless drive, and mount the sky,</L>
<L>Proud of misus'd Liberty;</L>
<L>While sordid Cunning, Passion blind,</L>
<L>Ride on the gilded car behind.</L>
<L>From Law's grimace, and mean chicane,</L>
<L>Which rivets, when it seems the chain</L>
<L>To loose; receives the golden shower,</L>
<L>And offers hecatombs to Power.</L>
<L>From language low, which vulgars prize,</L>
<L>Creeping Arts which mean to rise;</L>
<L>Labyrinths, which ever wind</L>
<L>In the dark and double mind:</L>
<L>From Profession's learned scene;</L>
<L>Cant of words, which little mean:</L>
<L>Physic, child of Luxury;</L>
<L>Clok'd in shallow mystery:</L>
<L>False Religion's forms, which bind</L>
<L>The body to enslave the mind:</L>
<L>Disputation's rage and trouble:</L>
<L>Philosophic system's bubble:</L>
<L>From War's parade; or Eloquence</L>
<L>In senates, big with smooth pretence</L>
<L>Of public good: from Envy mean,</L>
<L>Who midst the liberal Arts is seen,</L>
<L>Corrodes the page which Genius drew,</L>
<L>And turns aside her sullen view,</L>
<L>Each work of Merit pleas'd to blast,</L>
<L>Then feeds upon herself at last.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="9"/>
From these, immortal Goddess! fly,</L>
<L>And bless thy humble votary.</L>
<L>Give me Reason's lasting pleasure,</L>
<L>Ease, but not ignoble leisure:</L>
<L>Far be wild Ambition's fires,</L>
<L>Hopeless Love, and fierce Desires.</L>
<L>I ask not Fortune's glittering charms,</L>
<L>The pride of courts, the spoils of arms;</L>
<L>By silver stream, and haunted grove,</L>
<L>O give my peaceful steps to rove:</L>
<L>Beneath the shade of pendent hills,</L>
<L>I'll listen to the falling rills,</L>
<L>That chafe the pebble, as they stray;</L>
<L>And haste, like human life, away:</L>
<L>Then on the flowery carpet green</L>
<L>I'll sit and trace the rural scene;</L>
<L>While by the mimic pencil drawn</L>
<L>The herds shall seem to crop the lawn;</L>
<L>The piping swain, the distant towers,</L>
<L>The moss-grown knotted oaks, and bowers,</L>
<L>As bending to the whispering breeze,</L>
<L>Some thatch'd cot rising 'mong the trees,</L>
<L>In rude and artless lines design'd,</L>
<L>Shall faintly mark the Master's mind.</L>
<L>Or, if soft verse delight us more,</L>
<L>O grant of verse the wonderous power</L>
<L>Strong ideas to inspire;</L>
<L>Words which paint, and sounds which fire;</L>
<L>Which calls up shades of heroes bold,</L>
<L>Whose virtues warm'd the times of old,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="10"/>
Dressing the historic page</L>
<L>With Terror, Pity, Love, and Rage;</L>
<L>Or gives to Truth the tuneful art</L>
<L>With moral song to mend the heart:</L>
<L>Flow it easy, soft, and free,</L>
<L>From ill-conceiv'd obscurity;</L>
<L>Affectation's crowded plumes,</L>
<L>All that strains, or that assumes;</L>
<L>Nature may it e'er pursue,</L>
<L>Describing, as we feel, the true:</L>
<L>Her magic glass while Fancy brings,</L>
<L>Which shews the fleeting form of things,</L>
<L>Each fair assemblage knows to trace</L>
<L>All that Nature hath of Grace;</L>
<L>While Reason lends her sacred aid,</L>
<L>And in the beautiful display'd,</L>
<L>Sees with sound philosophy</L>
<L>The reflected Deity.</L>
<L>Thus on thro' Manhood, Youth, and Age,</L>
<L>Nor stain'd with guilt, nor rough with rage,</L>
<L>In smooth maeanders life shall glide,</L>
<L>And roll a clear and peaceful tide.</L>

<HEAD>ODE ON DEATH. WRITTEN IN FRENCH BY HIS MAJESTY THE KING OF PRUSSIA.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>TRANSLATED BY THE SAME.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WHAT does the sad presaging mean?</L>
<L>Few days, few years, perhaps few moments urge</L>
<L>My footsteps to the dreary verge,</L>
<L>Where Fate the curtain drops to close the scene:</L>
<L>Then farewel! Life and Light! and thou blest Sun serene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Earth, o'er me rolls thy mighty bed;</L>
<L>The world recedes; I view the grave profound:</L>
<L>Of life I touch the utmost bound;</L>
<L>And rush to mix a victim with the dead,</L>
<L>Where Fate embraces all, and none can backward tread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While yet I wake or sleep, there stand</L>
<L>Ten thousand Deaths in arms; before, behind,</L>
<L>They press me round; and every wind</L>
<L>Wafts the contagion from each distant land,</L>
<L>And all the Elements conspire to arm the dreadful band;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
<L>Within, without, above, below,</L>
<L>By turns they sink, or rend my feeble frame,</L>
<L>Now chill, now urge the vital flame,</L>
<L>Till Nature's tortur'd stream forgets to flow,</L>
<L>And Art itself but proves a still more dangerous foe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dust to its Dust will soon return</L>
<L>This mortal part, proud Tyrant of the Mind,</L>
<L>Nor leave of all its pomp behind,</L>
<L>But horrid lessons human Pride should learn,</L>
<L>Foul Worms, and Blood, and Stench that sill the Royal Urn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Recede, ye base and servile train,</L>
<L>I cannot be the mighty thing ye say;</L>
<L>The wretched object of a day,</L>
<L>Which slatter'd Fancy would exalt in vain,</L>
<L>I know what I must be, and what I am disdain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But warm'd with Heaven's eternal flame,</L>
<L>Shall that which lives, which thinks, the Mind</L>
<L>Be fleeting as the empty wind?</L>
<L>Or say, can Death its active efforts tame,</L>
<L>O God, who first inspir'd this animated frame?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No: for the Mind above the grave</L>
<L>Unfetter'd springs, and searching Nature's stores</L>
<L>It knows itself, and thee adores,</L>
<L>Secure, O God, whose word its being gave,</L>
<L>That what created first has certain power to save;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
<L>While thus of Death dispels the cloud,</L>
<L>Can sensual joy life's narrow view confine?</L>
<L>True Virtue feels the hope divine</L>
<L>Of bliss sincere: not so the guilty crowd;</L>
<L>Thy arm for ever blasts the wicked and the proud.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great God! and is eternal pain</L>
<L>Or joy of Heaven reserv'd for me in store?</L>
<L>Thy breath but wafts to either shore;</L>
<L>Scarce can the tortur'd mind the thought sustain;</L>
<L>I fly forbidden joys, the sensual, and the vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet fast to earth is Nature bound:</L>
<L>Back on its wonted objects turns the Mind,</L>
<L>And lags the slave of life behind:</L>
<L>While Reason's efforts are too painful found</L>
<L>To rend the rooted oak that loves its native ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Objects of every jealous eye,</L>
<L>Ye dreams of mortal good, that swift decay,</L>
<L>How do ye stop my destin'd way?</L>
<L>And force me back the paths of sense to try?</L>
<L>Ye point the sting of Death, and more than once I die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scenes of astonishment! the world how blind!</L>
<L>Is Death depriv'd of all his mighty power?</L>
<L>Do none expect the fatal hour?</L>
<L>Is there a wish to Nature's bounds confin'd?</L>
<L>Is there a scheme forgot, or toil for this resign'd?</L>
</LG>

<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
<L>See Mortals still acquire, assume,</L>
<L>As if more vigilant they Death could shun,</L>
<L>To honours fly, to combats run,</L>
<L>And he whose footsteps tremble o'er the tomb</L>
<L>Builds up new plans of life, and sudden meets his doom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Rush on, ye madding train,</L>
<L>A thousand rocks, a thousand storms despise,</L>
<L>To reach the good ye idolize:</L>
<L>Go, of accumulated wealth be vain:</L>
<L>Go, ravage other worlds, if other worlds remain</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let neither law, nor power divine,</L>
<L>Nor Nature's anxious Monitor within</L>
<L>Repress each greatly daring Sin;</L>
<L>Go: bid with want the plunder'd Orphan pine,</L>
<L>And with polluted hands disturb each sacred Shrine;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Proceed: but soon your views are past;</L>
<L>Accurst; at once ye droop, and are no more:</L>
<L>Who would not think, to see your store,</L>
<L>That all the projects your Ambition cast</L>
<L>Beyond the grave were stretch'd, and would for ever last?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye mighty Leaders, mighty Kings,</L>
<L>With flames, and blood, whose battles mark your way;</L>
<L>Do Monarchs hope eternal sway?</L>
<L>In vain each distant clime its tribute brings,</L>
<L>Sprung from the dust ye mix with long-forgotten things.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
<L>Himself the Victor cannot save;</L>
<L>If but to die is yours, how short is Glory's sum?</L>
<L>In vain ye fought and overcome,</L>
<L>Nor aught avail the spoils Ambition gave</L>
<L>To hang with conquer'd crowns the putrid Monarch's grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On Nature's theatre display'd</L>
<L>All is the sport of Death; the change I fear;</L>
<L>New objects rise, then disappear;</L>
<L>Around my brows the cypress casts a shade;</L>
<L>I scorn the sweets of life, and all its roses fade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet 'midst this sage, but painful lore,</L>
<L>While awful truths their sacred light reveal,</L>
<L>What means this latent wish I feel?</L>
<L>Is then my bosom's Lord itself no more?</L>
<L>Wretch! that I drag new chains more ponderous than before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Rules then the mind, this Lord supreme?</L>
<L>Which every weak, and vain allurement draws</L>
<L>To Pleasure's throne, and tyrant laws.</L>
<L>Quick we return in life from what we seem</L>
<L>To what we are, and wake from calm Reflection's dream.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As wandering Fancy leads we go;</L>
<L>By turns we reason, or submit to sense,</L>
<L>And incoherent parts commence</L>
<L>That fill the stage of Folly, Shame, and Woe;</L>
<L>Nor from the hook escap'd again the bait we know.</L>

<L>AS, when diffus'd in solemn trance</L>
<L>Her dear delight the Latmian shepherd lay,</L>
<L>Fond Cynthia came with lightning-glance,</L>

<L>So come, O gentle Muse, if e'er aright</L>
<L>I paid my vows, if e'er implor'd</L>
<L>One scanty beam of thy celestial light;</L>
<L>Proof to the muckworm miser's golden hoard,</L>
<L>Nor envious of the statesman's fair renown,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come, Guardian of my natal hour,</L>
<L>That bad'st me chuse the still sequester'd grove,</L>
<L>The pathless mead, and woodbine bower,</L>
<L>Where placid Cares, and pensive Pleasures rove;</L>

Where oft by moon-light's silent, solemn glade,</L>
<L>Pale Passion musing loves to stray,</L>
<L>And hand in hand, by Melancholy led,</L>
<L>In thoughtful loneness wears herself away;</L>
<L>O come, in all thy radiant charms confest,</L>
<L>And fire with glowing zeal my fond, devoted breast!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I ask not flowrets fresh and gay,</L>
<L>From Pindus cull'd to please the vainly great;</L>
<L>No silken strain, no tinsel lay,</L>
<L>To cloke some public Knave from public hate:</L>
<L>No, Virgin, no—Fair Freedom's vestal flame</L>
<L>Pervades my soul; for Her I twine</L>
<L>The votive wreath, for Her thy hallow'd name</L>
<L>Invoke, O make thy choicest treasures mine;</L>
<L>Breathe Inspiration thro' each glowing line,</L>

<L>Then shalt thou, George, the song approve,</L>
<L>O British-born! O Freedom's sacred heir!</L>
<L>O thou, whom all the Graces love,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>And thou, who shut'st not to the suppliant's prayer,</L>
<L>Nor to the aid-imploring voice thine ear,</L>
<L>Do thou, O MANCHESTER! protect the song;</L>
<L>The Muse's care does to the learn'd belong:</L>
<L>Grateful alike Muse, Subject, Author, bow,</L>
<L>And hail the source whence all their pleasures flow.</L>
<L>These plains that annual pour their sweets for thee,</L>
<L>(Thanks to thy bounty) yield a part to me:</L>
<L>And Ease, fair Virtue's, and the Poet's friend,</L>
<L>Thro' your indulgence, on my steps attend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Impervious to the sun's most potent ray</L>
<L>Yon lofty elms their arched heads display;</L>
<L>From far the traveller sees their summit rise,</L>
<L>Scarce half distinguish'd from the neighbouring skies;</L>
<L>But oft surveying as he onward goes,</L>
<L>Greener and fairer still the object grows;</L>
<L>Till underneath their shade, at ease reclin'd,</L>
<L>He leaves the labour of the day behind;</L>

Soft breezes cool him from surrounding bowers,</L>
<L>And Nature bland her gay profusion pours.</L>

<L>So they who dauntless plow the dangerous main,</L>
<L>(What will not daring man attempt for gain?)</L>
<L>At early dawn, from top-mast-head espy</L>
<L>A rising vapour in the bordering sky;</L>
<L>Ere day's mid course, that vapour oft they find</L>
<L>A royal navy, hovering in the wind:</L>
<L>Yards, sails, and streamers crowd the whispering air,</L>
<L>And all the glories of the deep appear.</L>

<L>Nor less impervious that extended shade</L>
<L>By reverend oaks, the growth of ages, made;</L>

<L>Here let the huntsman wind the echoing horn,</L>
<L>Cheer his swift steed, and wake the rosy morn;</L>
<L>Let dogs and men in noisy concert join,</L>
<L>And sportsmen call the harmony divine:</L>
<L>The Muse delights not, fond of pensive ease,</L>
<L>In dissipation, or pursuits like these.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And thou, sweet Thrush! prolong thy amorous tale,</L>
<L>Let thy love-burthen'd song delight the vale!</L>
<L>No leaden death I bring, no toils for thee,</L>
<L>Sing on, and soothe thy feather'd progeny.</L>
<L>Come! peaceful Precepts! of the Samian Sage,</L>
<L>Unbend the bow, and curb an iron age!</L>
<L>Whatever laws short-sighted man may make,</L>

<L>Pardon me, You! whose nobler tears can flow</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Nature fair from her Creator sprung,</L>

<L>When every object thus their charms combine,</L>
<L>What bosom can resist the power divine?</L>
<L>Too feeble that, which now the Muse inspires,</L>

<L>Here, here I felt the soft infection rise,</L>

<L>Let Rome her fetter'd monks to cells withdraw,</L>

<L>Where clearest morn to cloudy noon gives way,</L>

When Evening dons her mantle grey,</L>

<L>Whose social branches, far outspread,</L>
<L>Possess the mind with pleasing dread.</L>
<L>While Cynthia quivers thro' the trees</L>
<L>That wanton with the summer breeze,</L>
<L>And the clear brook, or dimpled stream,</L>
<L>Reflects oblique her dancing beam.</L>
<L>How often, by thy silver light,</L>
<L>Have lovers tongues beguil'd the Night?</L>
<L>When forth the happy pair have stray'd,</L>
<L>The amorous swain and tender maid,</L>
<L>And as they walk'd the groves along,</L>
<L>Chear'd the still eve with various song.</L>
<L>While every artful strain confest</L>
<L>The mutual passion in their breast.</L>
<L>To lovers hours fly swift away,</L>
<L>And Night reluctant yields to Day.</L>
</LG>

<L>Thrice happy Nymph, thrice happy Youth,</L>
<L>When Beauty is the meed of Truth!</L>

<L>Yet not the happy Loves alone,</L>
<L>Has thy celestial presence known.</L>
<L>To thee complains the Nymph forlorn</L>
<L>Of broken faith, and vows forsworn;</L>
<L>And, the dull Swain, with folded arms,</L>
<L>Still musing on his false one's charms,</L>
<L><PB N="99" REF="97"/>
Frames many a sonnet to her name,</L>
<L>(As lovers use to express their flame)</L>
<L>Or pining wan with thoughtful care,</L>

<L>But shift we now the pensive scene,</L>

<L>These Cynthia's Revels gaily keep,</L>
<L>While lazy mortals snore asleep;</L>
<L>Whom oft they visit in the night,</L>
<L>Not visible to human sight;</L>
<L>And as old prattling Wives relate,</L>

<L>Who knows not Mab, whose chariot glides,</L>

<L>While Oberon, blithe Fairy, trips,</L>

<L>And when he steals ambrosial bliss,</L>
<L>And soft imprints the charming kiss,</L>
<L>In Dreams the nymph her swain pursues,</L>
<L>Nor thinks 'tis Oberon that wooes.</L>

<L>Ye sportive Youth, and lovely Fair,</L>
<L>From hence, my lesson read, beware,</L>

<LG>
<L>When all things else in silence sleep,</L>
<L>The blithsome Elfs their vigils keep,</L>

<L>Receive with joy these Elfin sparks,</L>

<L>How hard is my lot to complain</L>
<L>Of a nymph whom I yet must adore,</L>
<L>Tho' she love not her shepherd again,</L>

<L>For it was not the pride of her sex,</L>

<L>AT once to raise our reverence and delight,</L>
<L>To elevate the mind, and please the sight,</L>
<L>To pour in virtue at th' attentive eye,</L>
<L>And waft the soul on wings of extasy;</L>
<L>For this the painter's art with nature vies,</L>
<L>And bids the visionary saint arise;</L>
<L>Who views the sacred forms in thought aspires,</L>
<L>Catches pure zeal, and as he gazes, fires;</L>
<L>Feels the same ardour to his breast convey'd,</L>
<L>Is what he sees, and emulates the shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy strokes, great Artist, so sublime appear,</L>
<L>They check our pleasure with an awful fear;</L>
<L>While, thro' the mortal line, the God you trace,</L>
<L>Author himself, and Heir of Jesse's race;</L>
<L>In raptures we admire thy bold design,</L>
<L>And, as the subject, own the hand divine.</L>
<L>While thro' thy work the rising day shall stream,</L>
<L>So long shall last thy honour, praise, and name.</L>
<L><PB N="115" REF="113"/>
And may thy labours to the Muse impart</L>
<L>Some emanation from her sister art,</L>
<L>To animate the verse, and bid it shine</L>
<L>In colours easy, bright, and strong, as Thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Supine on earth an awful figure lies,</L>
<L>While softest slumbers seem to seal his eyes;</L>
<L>The hoary sire Heaven's guardian care demands,</L>
<L>And at his feet the watchful angel stands.</L>
<L>The form august and large, the mien divine</L>
<L>Betray the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jesse.</NOTE> founder of Messiah's line.</L>
<L>Lo! from his loins the promis'd stem ascends,</L>
<L>And high to Heaven its sacred Boughs extends:</L>
<L>Each limb productive of some hero springs,</L>
<L>And blooms luxuriant with a race of kings.</L>
<L>Th' eternal plant wide spreads its arms around,</L>
<L>And with the mighty Branch the mystic top is crown'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And lo! the glories of th' illustrious line</L>
<L>At their first dawn with ripen'd splendors shine,</L>
<L>In DAVID all express'd; the good, the great,</L>
<L>The king, the hero, and the man complete.</L>
<L>Serene he fits, and sweeps the golden lyre,</L>
<L>And blends the prophet's with the poet's fire.</L>
<L>See! with what art he strikes the vocal strings,</L>
<L>The God, his theme, inspiring what he sings!</L>
<L>Hark,—or our ears delude us—from his tongue</L>
<L>Sweet flows, or seems to flow, some heavenly song.</L>
<L>O! could thine art arrest the fleeting sound,</L>
<L>And paint the voice in magic numbers bound;</L>
<L><PB N="116" REF="114"/>
Could the warm sun, as erst when Memnon play'd,</L>
<L>Wake with his rising beam the vocal shade:</L>
<L>Then might he draw th' attentive angels down,</L>
<L>Bending to hear the lay, so sweet, so like their own.</L>
<L>On either side the monarch's offspring shine,</L>
<L>And some adorn, and some disgrace their line.</L>
<L>Here Ammon glories; proud, incestuous lord!</L>
<L>This hand sustains the robe, and that the sword.</L>
<L>Frowning and fierce, with haughty strides he towers,</L>
<L>And on his horrid brow defiance low'rs.</L>
<L>There Absalom the ravish'd sceptre sways,</L>
<L>And his stol'n honour all his shame displays:</L>
<L>The base usurper Youth! who joins in one</L>
<L>The rebel subject, and th' ungrateful son.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Amid the royal race, see Nathan stand:</L>
<L>Fervent he seems to speak, and lift his hand;</L>
<L>His looks th' emotion of his soul disclose,</L>
<L>And eloquence from every gesture flows.</L>
<L>Such, and so stern he came, ordain'd to bring</L>
<L>Th' ungrateful mandate to the guilty King:</L>
<L>When, at his dreadful voice, a sudden smart</L>
<L>Shot thro' the trembling monarch's conscious heart;</L>
<L>From his own lips condemn'd; severe decree!</L>
<L>Had his God prov'd so stern a Judge as He.</L>
<L>But man with frailty is ally'd by birth;</L>
<L>Consummate purity ne'er dwelt on earth:</L>
<L>Thro' all the soul tho' virtue holds the rein,</L>
<L>Beats at the heart, and springs at every vein:</L>
<L>Yet ever from the clearest source have ran</L>
<L>Some gross allay, some tincture of the man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="117" REF="115"/>
<L>But who is he—deep musing—in his mind,</L>
<L>He seems to weigh in Reason's scales, Mankind;</L>
<L>Fix'd Contemplation hold his steady eyes—</L>
<L>I know the Sage <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Solomon.</NOTE>; the wisest of the wise.</L>
<L>Blest with all man could wish, or prince obtain,</L>
<L>Yet his great heart pronounc'd those blessings vain.</L>
<L>And lo! bright glittering in his sacred hands,</L>
<L>In miniature the glorious temple stands.</L>
<L>Effulgent frame! stupendous to behold!</L>
<L>Gold the strong valves, the roof of burnish'd gold.</L>
<L>The wandering ark, in that bright dome inshrin'd,</L>
<L>Spreads the strong light, eternal, unconfin'd!</L>
<L>Above th' unutterable glory plays</L>
<L>Presence divine! and the full-streaming rays</L>
<L>Pour thro' reluctant crowds intolerable blaze.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But stern Oppression rends Reboam's reign;</L>
<L>See the gay prince, injurious, proud, and vain!</L>
<L>Th' imperial sceptre totters in his hand,</L>
<L>And proud Rebellion triumphs in the land.</L>
<L>Curs'd with Corruption's ever-fruitful spring,</L>
<L>A beardless Senate, and a haughty King.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There Asa, good and great, the sceptre bears,</L>
<L>Justice attends his peace, success his wars:</L>
<L>While Virtue was his sword, and Heaven his shield,</L>
<L>Without controul the warrior swept the field;</L>
<L>Loaded with spoils, triumphant he return'd,</L>
<L>And half her swarthy sons sad Ethiopia mourn'd.</L>
<L><PB N="118" REF="116"/>
But since thy flagging piety decay'd,</L>
<L>And barter'd God's defence for human aid;</L>
<L>See their fair laurels wither on thy brow,</L>
<L>Nor herbs, nor healthful arts avail thee now,</L>
<L>Nor is Heaven chang'd, apostate prince, but Thou.</L>
<L>No mean atonement does this lapse require;</L>
<L>But see the Son, you must forgive the Sire:</L>
<L>He, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Josaphat.</NOTE> the just prince—with every virtue blest,</L>
<L>He reign'd, and goodness all the man possest,</L>
<L>Around his throne, fair happiness and peace</L>
<L>Smooth'd every brow, and smil'd in every face.</L>
<L>As when along the burning waste he stray'd,</L>
<L>Where no pure streams in bubbling mazes play'd,</L>
<L>Where drought incumbent on the thirsty ground,</L>
<L>Long since had breath'd her scorching blasts around;</L>
<L>The <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Elisha.</NOTE> prophet calls, th' obedient floods repair</L>
<L>To the parch'd fields, for Josaphat was there.</L>
<L>The new-sprung waves, in many a gurgling vein,</L>
<L>Trickle luxurious thro' the sucking plain;</L>
<L>Fresh honours the reviving fields adorn,</L>
<L>And o'er the desart Plenty pours her horn.</L>
<L>So, from the throne his influence he sheds,</L>
<L>And bids the Virtues raise their languid heads:</L>
<L>Where'er he goes, attending Truth prevails,</L>
<L>Oppression flies, and Justice lifts her scales.</L>
<L>See, on his arm, the royal eagle stand,</L>
<L>Great type of conquest and supreme command;</L>
<L><PB N="119" REF="117"/>
Th' exulting bird distinguish'd triumph brings,</L>
<L>And greets the Monarch with expanded wings.</L>
<L>Fierce Moab's sons prevent th' impending blow,</L>
<L>Rush on themselves, and sall without the foe.</L>
<L>The pious Hero vanquish'd Heaven by prayer;</L>
<L>His faith an army, and his vows a war.</L>
<L>Thee too, Ozias, fates indulgent blest,</L>
<L>And thy days shone, in fairest actions drest;</L>
<L>Till that rash hand; by some blind frenzy sway'd,</L>
<L>Unclean, the sacred office durst invade.</L>
<L>Quick o'er thy limbs the surfy venom ran,</L>
<L>And hoary filth besprinkled all the man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Transmissive worth adorns the pious <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Jotham.</NOTE> Son,</L>
<L>The father's virtues with the father's throne.</L>
<L>Lo! there he stands: he who the rage subdued</L>
<L>Of Ammon's sons, and drench'd his sword in blood,</L>
<L>And dost thou, Ahaz, Judah's scourge, disgrace,</L>
<L>With thy base front, the glories of thy race?</L>
<L>See the vile King his iron sceptre bear—</L>
<L>His only praise attends the pious <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hezekiah.</NOTE> Heir;</L>
<L>He, in whose soul the virtues all conspire,</L>
<L>The best good son, from the most wicked sire.</L>
<L>And lo! in Hezekiah's golden reign,</L>
<L>Long-exil'd Piety returns again;</L>
<L>Again, in genuine purity she shines,</L>
<L>And with her presence gilds the long-neglected shrines.</L>
<L>Ill-starr'd does proud Assyria's impious <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Sennacherib.</NOTE> Lord</L>
<L>Bid Heaven to arms, and vaunt his dreadful sword;</L>
<L><PB N="120" REF="118"/>
His own vain threats th' insulting King o'erthrow,</L>
<L>But breathe new Courage on the generous foe,</L>
<L>Th' avenging Angel, by divine command,</L>
<L>The fiery sword full-blazing in his hand,</L>
<L>Leant down from Heaven: amid the storm he rode,</L>
<L>March'd Pestilence before him; as he trod,</L>
<L>Pale Desolation bath'd his steps in blood.</L>
<L>Thick wrapt in night, thro' the proud host he past,</L>
<L>Dispensing death, and drove the furious blast;</L>
<L>Nor bade Destruction give her revels o'er,</L>
<L>Till the gorg'd sword was drunk with human gore.</L>
<L>But what avails thee, pious Prince, in vain</L>
<L>Thy sceptre rescued, and th' Assyrian slain?</L>
<L>Ev'n now the soul maintains her latest strife,</L>
<L>And Death's chill grasp congeals the found of life.</L>
<L>Yet see, kind Heaven renews thy brittle thread,</L>
<L>And rolls full fifteen summers o'er thy head;</L>
<L>Lo! the receding sun repeats his way,</L>
<L>And, like thy life, prolongs the falling day.</L>
<L>Tho' Nature her inverted course forego,</L>
<L>The day forget to rest, the time to flow,</L>
<L>Yet shall Jehovah's servants stand secure,</L>
<L>His mercy fix'd, eternal shall endure;</L>
<L>On them her ever-healing rays shall shine;</L>
<L>More mild, and bright, and sure, O sun! than thine.</L>

<L>At length, the long-expected Prince behold,</L>

<HEAD>WINTER PROSPECTS IN THE COUNTRY. AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND IN LONDON, 1756.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY J. S.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WHile Learning's pleasing cares my friend detain,</L>
<L>By Thames's banks on London's smoaky plain;</L>
<L>Where spacious streets their peopled length extend,</L>
<L>And pompous domes and lofty spires ascend:</L>
<L>Far different views the lonely country yields,</L>
<L>Deserted roads, and unfrequented fields;</L>
<L>Bleak scenes, where hoary Winter holds command,</L>
<L>And from his throne of clouds o'erlooks the land;</L>
<L>He frowns—the power of Vegetation dies,</L>
<L>Frosts bind the earth, and Tempests rend the skies;</L>
<L>Or driving Snows descend, or pouring Rains,</L>
<L>Or chilling Vapours hover o'er the plains.</L>
<L>Sometimes awhile the hoary Tyrant sleeps,</L>
<L>Hid in his cave beneath the watery deeps;</L>
<L>The distant sun extends a chearing ray,</L>
<L>Bright smile the skies and soft the breezes play:</L>
<L><PB N="125" REF="123"/>
Then airy lawns the morning walk invite,</L>
<L>And rural landscapes charm the roving sight,</L>
<L>Mix'd with brown stubble, leafless woods are seen,</L>
<L>And neat-plough'd furrows clad in scanty green;</L>
<L>While turbid waters edg'd with yellow reeds</L>
<L>Wind thro' the russet herd-forsaken meads;</L>
<L>And groves that Winter's fiercest rage disdain</L>
<L>In fair plantations deck the shelter'd plain:</L>
<L>There painted hollies with red berries glow,</L>
<L>And their broad leaves the shining laurels show,</L>
<L>And pines and firs their varied verdure blend,</L>
<L>And cedars spread, and cypresses ascend.</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the scene, I range from field to field,</L>
<L>Till loftier lands remoter prospects yield;</L>
<L>And there the curious optic tube apply</L>
<L>Till a new world approaches on the eye;</L>
<L>Till where dark wood the hills slope surface shrouds;</L>
<L>Or the blue summit mingles with the clouds;</L>
<L>There fair inclosures lie of varied hue,</L>
<L>And trees and houses rise distinct to view.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But this too oft th' inclement clime denies,</L>
<L>Involv'd in misty or in watery skies;</L>
<L>And yet ev'n then with books engag'd, I find</L>
<L>A sweet employment for th' exploring mind;</L>
<L>There fair Description shews each absent scene,</L>
<L>The corn-clad mountain and the daisied green;</L>
<L>There over distant lands my fancy roves,</L>
<L>Thro' India's cany isles and palmy groves;</L>
<L><PB N="126" REF="124"/>
Where clear streams wander thro' luxuriant vales,</L>

<L>HAIL, happy Beldames! yours those joys</L>
<L>Which time, nor accident destroys.</L>
<L>Sickness and cares your bliss dilate,</L>
<L>And pain but whets your lust of hate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The flower of Youth will soon decay,</L>
<L>Health, Beauty, Pleasure fade away.:</L>
<L>Sharp sorrows sting the breast humane,</L>
<L>And hopes are false, and wishes vain.</L>
<L>But hence your joys eternal flow,</L>
<L>Their source exhaustless, human woe.</L>

<L>For you fierce War high-piles his dead,</L>
<L>Disease thick-strews her squalid bed;</L>
<L>Famine and Plagues their myriads sweep,</L>
<L>And Tempests lash th' all-whelming deep.</L>
<L>The fiery meteors hear your call,</L>
<L>And houses blaze, and temples fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But far remote from Britain's eye</L>
<L>The vaster scenes of ruin lie:</L>
<L>The cities in Vulcanos lost,</L>
<L>The scatter'd realms in whirlwinds tost,</L>
<L>Or, feller scourge, a Tyrant's brand</L>
<L>Wide-flaming o'er a blasted land:</L>
<L><PB N="157" REF="155"/>
Imperfect joy, the wretch unknown,</L>
<L>Unmark'd the pang, unheard the groan.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here mighty Horror scarce appears;</L>
<L>One plague perhaps in ninety years:</L>
<L>And Faction, long depriv'd of food,</L>
<L>Sits pining over public good;</L>
<L>Or feeds, with self-tormenting spleen,</L>
<L>In present bliss, on ills foreseen,</L>

<L>But here more exquisite delight</L>
<L>From private woes soothes ranc'rous Spight.</L>
<L>In pride of youth our Frederic dies,</L>

<L>When by that hand, which thousands sed,</L>

<L>To crimes unknown the yielding maid;</L>
<L>Whether in weakness or in guilt,</L>
<L>One joy is sure, her blood is spilt:</L>
<L><PB N="158" REF="156"/>
And still to raise the transport higher,</L>
<L>Believe her innocent expire!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By no degree, no sex defin'd,</L>
<L>Their Virtues stamp the Beldame-kind,</L>
<L>Who cringe and slander, sting and fawn,</L>
<L>In rags, or lace, or fur, or lawn;</L>
<L>Whether in perriwigs or pinners,</L>
<L>If Whitefield's saints, or Arthur's sinners;</L>
<L>If now the scold at Wapping flames,</L>

<L>All the foul sisterhood compose,</L>
<L>All those, and all resembling those.</L>

<LG>
<L>But some, in hoary Age's train,</L>
<L>By sixty winters chill'd in vain,</L>
<L>With hearts that melt, and nerves that feel,</L>

<L>How few are these! and of these few</L>

<L>Peace to all such in silent state,</L>

<L>'Tis not enough that Nature's plan</L>

That ev'n those few, we happy call,</L>

<L>Now stooping spurns the lowly cell</L>
<L>Where calm Content, and Concord dwell,</L>
<L>Well pleas'd degraded Worth to see,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet shall the tear of Pity flow,</L>
<L>Yet shall her hand exalt the low;</L>
<L>Shall pull aspiring Merit down,</L>
<L>And deck the base with Honor's crown;</L>

The Beldame loud exalts her voice,</L>

<L>Behold the Fiend all pallid stand,</L>

<L>ALL hail, bright Hope! Thou, when the fatal box,</L>
<L>Replete with ills, was sent by angry Jove</L>
<L>In punishment of Japhet's <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Prometheus.</NOTE> daring son,</L>
<L>When every woe of fearful name flew forth</L>
<L>To vex the human race, thou kindly deign'dst</L>
<L>To stay behind, man's gentle comforter,</L>
<L>Life's balm and blessing! or, without the aid</L>
<L>Of truth-assimilated fiction, thou</L>
<L>Wast given by God himself, a chearing light</L>
<L>To guide man's feet, driv'n from fair Eden's groves</L>
<L>Across the untrack'd wilderness of life</L>
<L>To Heaven's blest mansions: where and where alone</L>
<L>Thy office, friendly Hope, shall sweetly cease</L>
<L>To full fruition yielded! But on earth,</L>
<L>Nay, not, perchance, ev'n in fair Eden's groves,</L>
<L>Are thy assuasive consolations vain:</L>
<L>For what is life, or what its highest scenes</L>
<L>Of boasted happiness, if present bliss</L>
<L><PB N="222" REF="222"/>
Bounds the horizon of our views; nor Hope,</L>
<L>With eagle eye, kens aught beyond, on which</L>
<L>To fix the future, ardent, heart's desire,</L>
<L>To fill the soul, and make the rapid wish</L>
<L>Run o'er with plentitude of joy?—Vain, vain,</L>
<L>To man's felicity, in youth or age,</L>
<L>The present draught of pleasure, tho' once wish'd</L>
<L>With all the eagerness of panting thirst.</L>
<L>Deep, deep he drinks, and longs for more! From hope</L>
<L>To hope he springs: he views, and still extends</L>
<L>His view: o'er cloud-capt Alps new Alps arise!</L>
<L>He gains the summit: still the prospect wide</L>
<L>Enlarges to his eye: forward he fares</L>
<L>Nor ceases to ascend, till high in heaven</L>
<L>He rides at anchor, and then Hope's no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But O! thou general blessing, smiling Hope!</L>
<L>Thy lucid ray, not only leads us on</L>
<L>From view to view; not only dost thou chear</L>
<L>With expectation sweet of future good;</L>
<L>But with serenity of present bliss</L>
<L>Thou fill'st the heart expectant! Hope can give</L>
<L>Habitual good-humour! To the soul</L>
<L>A vital heat: she quickens the still parts,</L>
<L>Nay, ev'n in motion keeps the springs of life!</L>
<L>And when most indolent, and most remiss,</L>
<L>Or rouzes, or preserves the mind awake.</L>

<LG>
<L>See, too, how few—and ev'n those few how short—</L>
<L>Are actual enjoyments! But thro' thee,</L>
<L>Blest Hope, we gain a taste, delicious taste</L>
<L>Of pleasures possible! Taste, not less sweet,</L>
<L><PB N="223" REF="223"/>
Perchance, than real: for kind Hope bestows</L>
<L>A bliss in expectation, not less full,</L>
<L>And fuller oft than ripe fruition brings:</L>
<L>Fruition, haughty nymph, she never deigns</L>
<L>To walk with humble Hope, who, at her sight</L>
<L>Retires, abash'd, unnotic'd, and unthank'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But O! blest comforter, ingrate to thee</L>
<L>Let me not ever prove, should wish'd success</L>
<L>Crown my heart's hope! let me not e'er forget</L>
<L>The dear indulgences thy soothing views</L>
<L>Have to my soul presented! Yet, O yet—</L>
<L>Thy promis'd consummation too, too long</L>
<L>Delay'd, the heart in deep despondence sighs,</L>
<L>And sickens sad with care. O then, indulge</L>
<L>Thy votary's prayer, nor ever let me lose</L>
<L>Thy chearing aspect; never let the night</L>
<L>Of black despondence, with its dismal veil,</L>
<L>My little prospects in thick darkness wrap!</L>
<L>Nor yet too long delay to grant my wish</L>
<L>Accomplishment, if worthy! So my soul</L>
<L>Invigorated still shall onward press</L>
<L>To more and more improvement: nor grow faint</L>
<L>Till the big buds of Hope terrestrial burst</L>
<L>To blossoms full and fair in better climes!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But say, bright Hope, what numbers shall be found,</L>
<L>Worthy to sing thy praise: for that thy hand</L>
<L>Not only to the happiest life imparts</L>
<L>Its zest, its relish; but with tender care</L>

<L>Joy after joy successive rise:</L>
</LG>

<L>And Fame her golden trumpet blew;</L>

<L>And Wealth engag'd my wandering view;</L>
<L>And Pleasure woo'd me to her arms:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To each by turns my vows I paid,</L>
<L>As Folly led me to admire;</L>
<L>While Fancy magnified each shade,</L>
<L>And Hope increas'd each fond desire:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But soon I found 'twas all a dream;</L>
<L>And learn'd the fond pursuit to shun,</L>
<L>Where few can reach their purpos'd aim,</L>
<L>And thousands daily are undone:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And Fame, I found, was empty air;</L>
<L>And Wealth had Terror for her guest;</L>
<L>And Pleasure's path was strewn with care;</L>
<L>And Power was vanity at best.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tir'd of the chace, I gave it o'er;</L>
<L>And, in a far sequester'd shade,</L>
<L>To Contemplation's sober power</L>
<L>My youth's next services I paid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There Health and Peace adorn'd the scene;</L>
<L>And oft, indulgent to my prayer,</L>
<L>With mirthful eye and frolic mien,</L>
<L>The Muse would deign to visit there:</L>
</LG>

<L>There would she oft delighted rove</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or, 'mid the forest's awful gloom,</L>
<L>Whilst wild amazement fill'd my eyes,</L>
<L>Recal past ages from the tomb,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus in the Muse's favour blest,</L>
<L>One wish alone my soul could frame,</L>

<L>For manly constancy, and truth,</L>

<L>Still with our years our friendship grew;</L>
<L>No cares did then my peace destroy;</L>

<L>She was—at least in Damon's eyes—</L>
<L>Made up of loveliness and grace,</L>
<L>Her heart a stranger to disguise,</L>
<L>Her mind as perfect as her face:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To hear her speak, to see her move,</L>
<L>(Unhappy I, alas! the while)</L>
<L>Her voice was joy, her look was love,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>She heard me breathe my amorous prayers,</L>
<L>She listen'd to the tender strain,</L>
<L>She heard my sighs, she saw my tears,</L>
<L>And seem'd at length to share my pain:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She said she lov'd—and I, poor youth!</L>
<L>(How soon, alas, can Hope persuade!)</L>
<L>Thought all she said no more than truth,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>In joys unknown to courts or kings,</L>

<L>That Venus and the Graces join'd</L>
<L>To form this Phoenix of her kind,</L>
<L>And Pallas undertook to store</L>
<L>Her mind with Wisdom's chiefest lore;</L>
<L>Thus form'd, Jove issues a decree</L>

Then Cupid (for what match is made</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Your fearful Prose-men here might doubt</L>
<L>How best to bring this match about,</L>
<L>For winds and waves are ill-bred things,</L>
<L>And little care for Queens and Kings;</L>
<L>But as the Gods assembled stand,</L>
<L>And wait each youthful bard's command,</L>
<L>All fancy'd dangers they deride</L>
<L>Of boisterous winds, and swelling tide;</L>
<L>Neptune is call'd to wait upon her,</L>
<L>And sea-nymphs are her maids of honour;</L>
<L>Whilst we, instead of eastern gales,</L>
<L>With vows and praises fill the sails,</L>
<L>And when, with due poetic care</L>
<L>They safely land the Royal Fair,</L>
<L>They catch the happy simile</L>
<L>Of Venus rising from the sea.</L>
<L>Soon as she moves, the hill and vale</L>

<L>And wonder holds th' enraptur'd throng</L>
<L>To see the Goddess pass along;</L>
<L>The bowing forests all adore her,</L>
<L>And flowers spontaneous spring before her,</L>
<L>Where you and I all day might travel,</L>
<L>And meet with nought but sand and gravel;</L>
<L><PB N="275" REF="275"/>
But poets have a piercing eye,</L>
<L>And many pretty things can spy,</L>
<L>Which neither you nor I can see,</L>
<L>But then the fault's in you and me.</L>
<L>The King astonish'd must appear,</L>
<L>And find that Fame has wrong'd his dear;</L>
<L>Then Hymen, like a bishop, stands,</L>
<L>To join the lovers' plighted hands;</L>
<L>Apollo and the Muses wait,</L>

<L>As Egremont and Pembroke are;</L>
<L>For tho' by sages 'tis confest,</L>

<L>Yet 'tis, methinks, in married life,</L>
<L>A pretty douceur with a wife:</L>
<L>And may the minutes as they fly</L>
<L>Strengthen still the nuptial tye,</L>
<L>While hand in hand thro' life they go,</L>
<L>Till love shall into friendship grow;</L>
<L>For tho' these blessings rarely wait</L>

<L>Yet happiness is virtue's lot,</L>
<L>Alike in palace and in cot:</L>
<L>'Tis true, the grave affairs of state</L>
<L>With little folks have little weight;</L>
<L>Yet I confess my patriot heart</L>
<L>In Britain's welfare bears its part;</L>
<L>With transport glows at George's name,</L>
<L>And triumphs in its country's fame:</L>
<L>With hourly pleasure I can sit</L>
<L>And talk of Granby, Hawke, and Pitt;</L>
<L>And whilst I praise the good and brave,</L>
<L>Disdain the coward and the knave.</L>
<L>At growth of taxes others fret,</L>
<L>And shudder at the nation's debt;</L>
<L>I ne'er the fancied ills bemoan,</L>
<L>No debts disturb me, but my own.</L>

What! tho' our coffers sink, our trade</L>
<L>Repairs the breach which war has made;</L>

<L>Thus far my politics extend,</L>
