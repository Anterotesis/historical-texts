<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>An Invocation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>COME, bright Love of Fame, inspire my glowing Breast: Not thee I call, who over swelling Tides of Blood and Tears, dost bear the Heroe on to Glory, while Sighs of Millions waft his spreading Sails; but thee, fair, gentle Maid, whom <HI>Mnesis,</HI> happy Nymph, first on the Banks of <HI>Hebrus</HI> didst produce. Thee, whom <HI>Maeonia</HI> educated, whom <HI>Mantua</HI> charm'd, and who, on that fair Hill which overlooks the proud Metro∣polis of <HI>Britain,</HI> sat, with thy <HI>Milton,</HI> sweetly tun∣ing the Heroic Lyre; fill my ravished Fancy with the Hopes of charming Ages yet to come. Foretel me that some tender Maid, whose Grandmother is yet unborn, hereafter, when under the fictitious Name of <HI>Sophia,</HI> she reads the real worth which once existed in
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
my <HI>Charlotte,</HI> shall, from her sympathetic Breast, send forth the heaving Sigh. Do thou teach me not only to foresee, but to enjoy, nay, even to feed on future Praise. Comfort me by a solemn Assurance, that when the little Parlour in which I sit at this In∣stant, shall be reduced to a worse furnished Box, I shall be read, with Honour, by those who never knew nor saw me, and whom I shall neither know nor see.</P>
<P>And thou, much plumper Dame, whom no airy Forms nor Phantoms of Imagination cloathe: Whom the well-seasoned Beef, and Pudding richly stained with Plumbs delight. Thee, I call; of whom in a <HI>Trachtchugt</HI> in some <HI>Dutch</HI> Canal the fat Ufrow Gelt, impregnated by a jolly Merchant of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> was delivered: In <HI>Grubstreet-</HI>School didst thou suck in the Elements of thy Erudition. Here hast thou, in thy maturer Age, taught Poetry to tickle not the Fancy, but the Pride of the Patron. Comedy from thee learns a grave and solemn Air; while Tragedy storms loud, and rends the affrighted Theatres with its Thunder. To sooth thy wearied Limbs in Slumber, Alderman History tells his tedious Tale; and again to awaken thee, Monsieur Romance performs his sur∣prizing Tricks of Dexterity. Nor less thy well-fed Bookseller obeys thy Influence. By thy Advice the heavy, unread, Folio Lump, which long had dozed on the dusty Shelf, piece-mealed into Numbers, runs nimbly through the Nation. Instructed by thee some Books, like Quacks, impose on the World by pro∣mising Wonders; while others turn Beaus, and trust all their Merits to a gilded Outside. Come, thou jolly Substance, with thy shining Face, keep back thy In∣spiration, but hold forth thy tempting Rewards; thy shining, chinking Heap; thy quickly-convertible Bank-bill, big with unseen Riches; thy often-varying Stock; the warm, the comfortable House; and,
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
lastly, a fair Portion of that bounteous Mother, whose flowing Breasts yield redundant Sustenance for all her numerous Off-spring, did not some too greedi∣ly and wantonly drive their Brethren from the Teat. Come thou, and if I am too tasteless of thy valuable Treasures, warm my Heart with the transporting Thought of conveying them to others. Tell me, that through thy Bounty, the prattling Babes, whose innocent Play hath often been interrupted by my Labours, may one Time be amply rewarded for them.</P>
<P>And now this ill-yoked Pair, this lean Shadow and this fat Substance, have prompted me to write, whose Assistance shall I invoke to direct my Pen?</P>
<P>First, Genius; thou Gift of Heaven; without whose Aid, in vain we struggle against the Stream of Nature. Thou, who dost sow the generous Seeds which Art nourishes, and brings to Perfection. Do thou kindly take me by the Hand, and lead me through all the Mazes, the winding Labyrinths of Nature. Initiate me into all those Mysteries which profane Eyes never beheld. Teach me, which to thee is no difficult Task, to know Mankind better than they know themselves. Remove that Mist which dims the Intellects of Mortals, and causes them to a∣dore Men for their Art, or to detest them for their Cunning in deceiving others, when they are, in rea∣lity, the Objects only of Ridicule, for deceiving them∣selves. Strip off the thin Disguise of Wisdom from Self-Conceit, of Plenty from Avarice, and of Glory from Ambition. Come thou, that hast inspired thy <HI>Aristophanes,</HI> thy <HI>Lucian,</HI> thy <HI>Cervantes,</HI> thy <HI>Rabe∣lais,</HI> thy <HI>Moliere,</HI> thy <HI>Shakespear,</HI> thy <HI>Swift,</HI> thy <HI>Marivaux,</HI> fill my Pages with Humour; 'till Man∣kind learn the Good-nature to laugh only at the Fol∣lies of others, and the Humility to grieve at their own.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="9"/>
And thou, almost the constant Attendant on true Genius, Humanity, bring all thy tender Sensations. If thou hast already disposed of them all between thy <HI>Allen</HI> and thy <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> steal them a little while from their Bosoms. Not without these the tender Scene is painted. From these alone proceed the noble, disin∣terested Friendship, the melting Love, the generous Sentiment, the ardent Gratitude, the soft Compas∣sion, the candid Opinion; and all those strong Ener∣gies of a good Mind, which fill the moistened Eyes with Tears, the glowing Cheeks with Blood, and swell the Heart with Tides of Grief, Joy, and Be∣nevolence.</P>
<P>And thou, O Learning, (for without thy Assistance, nothing pure, nothing correct, can Genius produce) do thou guide my Pen. Thee, in thy favourite Fields, where the limpid, gently rolling <HI>Thames</HI> washes thy <HI>Etonian</HI> Banks, in early Youth I have worship∣ped. To thee, at thy birchen Altar, with true <HI>Spar∣tan</HI> Devotion, I have sacrificed my Blood. Come, then, and from thy vast luxuriant Stores, in long An∣tiquity piled up, pour forth the rich Profusion. Open thy <HI>Maeonian</HI> and thy <HI>Mantuan</HI> Coffers, with what∣ever else includes thy Philosophic, thy Poetic, and thy Historical Treasures, whether with <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Characters thou hast chosen to inscribe the pon∣derous Chests: Give me a while that Key, to all thy Treasures, which to thy <HI>Warburton</HI> thou hast entrusted.</P>
<P>Lastly, come Experience long conversant with the Wise, the Good, the Learned, and the Polite. Nor with them only, but with every Kind of Character from the Minister at his Levee, to the Bailiff in his Spunging-House; from the Dutchess at her Drum, to the Landlady behind her Bar. From thee only can the Manners of Mankind be known; to which
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
the recluse Pedant, however great his Parts, or exten∣sive his Learning may be, hath ever been a Stranger.</P>
<P>Come all these, and more, if possible; for ardu∣ous is the Task I have undertaken: And without all your Assistance, will, I find, be too heavy for me to support. But if you all smile on my Labours, I hope still to bring them to a happy Conclusion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>What befel Mr.</HI> Jones <HI>on his Arrival in</HI> London.</HEAD>
<P>THE learned Dr. <HI>Misaubin</HI> used to say, that the proper Direction to him was, <HI>To Dr.</HI> Misau∣bin, <HI>in the World;</HI> intimating, that there were few People in it to whom his great Reputation was not known, And, perhaps, upon a very nice Examina∣tion into the Matter, we shall find that this Circum∣stance bears no inconsiderable Part among the many Blessings of Grandeur.</P>
<P>The great Happiness of being known to Posterity, with the Hopes of which we so delighted ourselves in the preceding Chapter, is the Portion of few. To have the several Elements which compose our Names, as <HI>Sydenham</HI> expresses it, repeated a thousand Years hence, is a Gift beyond the Power of Title and Wealth; and is scarce to be purchased, unless by the Sword and the Pen. But to avoid the scan∣dalous Imputation, while we yet live, of being <HI>one whom No-body knows,</HI> (a Scandal, by the by, as old as the Days of <HI>Homer</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the 2d Odyssey, ver. 175.</NOTE>) will always be the envied Portion of those, who have a legal Title either to Ho∣nour or Estate.</P>
<P>From that Figure, therefore, which the <HI>Irish</HI> Peer, who brought <HI>Sophia</HI> to Town, hath already made in this History, the Reader will conclude, doubtless, it
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
must have been an easy Matter to have discovered his House in <HI>London,</HI> without knowing the particular Street or Square which he inhabited, since he must have been one <HI>whom every Body knows.</HI> To say the Truth, so it would have been to any of those Trades∣men who are accustomed to attend the Regions of the Great: For the Doors of the Great are generally no less easy to find, than it is difficult to get Entrance into them. But <HI>Jones,</HI> as well as <HI>Partridge,</HI> was an entire Stranger in <HI>London;</HI> and as he happened to ar∣rive first in a Quarter of the Town, the Inhabitants of which have very little Intercourse with the House∣holders of <HI>Hanover</HI> or <HI>Grosvenor</HI> Square, (for he en∣tered through <HI>Grays-Inn</HI> Lane) so he rambled about some Time, before he could even find his Way to those happy Mansions, where Fortune segregates from the Vulgar, those magnanimous Heroes, the De∣scendants of antient <HI>Britons, Saxons,</HI> or <HI>Danes,</HI> whose Ancestors being born in better Days, by sun∣dry Kinds of Merit, have entailed Riches and Honour on their Posterity.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> being at length arrived at those terrestrial <HI>Elysian</HI> Fields, would now soon have discovered his Lordship's Mansion; but the Peer unluckily quitted his former House when he went for <HI>Ireland;</HI> and as he was just entered into a new one, the Fame of his Equipage had not yet sufficiently blazed in the Neigh∣bourhood: So that after a successless Enquiry 'till the Clock had struck Eleven, <HI>Jones,</HI> at last, yielded to the Advice of <HI>Partridge,</HI> and retreated to the <HI>Bull</HI> and <HI>Gate</HI> in <HI>Holborn,</HI> that being the Inn where he had first alighted, and where he retired to enjoy that Kind of Repose, which usually attends Persons in his Cir∣cumstances.</P>
<P>Early in the Morning he again set forth in Pursuit of <HI>Sophia;</HI> and many a weary Step he took to no bet∣ter Purpose than before. At last, whether it was that
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
Fortune relented, or whether it was no longer in her Power to disappoint him, he came into the very Street which was honoured by his Lordship's Residence; and being directed to the House, he gave one gentle Rap at the Door.</P>
<P>The Porter, who, from the Modesty of the Knock, had conceived no high Idea of the Person approach∣ing, conceived but little better from the Appearance of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> who was drest in a Suit of Fustian, and had by his Side the Weapon formerly purchased of the Serjeant; of which, tho' the Blade might be composed of well-tempered Steel, the Handle was composed only of Brass, and that none of the bright∣est. When <HI>Jones,</HI> therefore, enquired after the young Lady, who had come to Town with his Lordship, this Fellow answered surlily, <Q REND="inline">'That there were no Ladies there.'</Q> <HI>Jones</HI> then desired to see the Master of the House; but was informed that his Lordship would see no Body that Morning. And upon grow∣ing more pressing, the Porter said, <Q REND="inline">'He had positive Orders to let no Person in; but if you think pro∣per,' said he, 'to leave your Name, I will ac∣quaint his Lordship; and if you call another Time, you shall know when he will see you.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> now declared, <Q REND="inline">'that he had very particular Business with the young Lady, and could not de∣part without seeing her.</Q> Upon which the Porter, with no very agreeable Voice or Aspect, affirmed, <Q REND="inline">'That there was no young Lady in that House, and, consequently, none could he see; adding, Sure you are the strangest Man I ever met with; for you will not take an Answer.'</Q></P>
<P>I have often thought, that by the particular De∣scription of <HI>Cerberus</HI> the Porter of Hell, in the 6th <HI>Aeneid, Virgil</HI> might possibly intend to satyrize the Porters of the great Men in his Time; the Picture, at least, resembles those who have the Honour to at∣tend
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
at the Doors of our great Men. The Porter in his Lodge, answers exactly to <HI>Cerberus</HI> in his Den, and, like him, must be appeased by a Sop, before Ac∣cess can be gained to his Master. Perhaps <HI>Jones</HI> might have seen him in that Light, and have recol∣lected the Passage, where the Sybil, in order to pro∣cure an Entrance for <HI>Aeneas,</HI> presents the Keeper of the <HI>Stygian</HI> Avenue with such a Sop. <HI>Jones,</HI> in like Manner, now began to offer a Bribe to the human <HI>Cerberus,</HI> which a Footman overhearing, instantly advanced, and declared, <Q REND="inline">'if Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> would give him the Sum proposed, he would conduct him to the Lady.'</Q> <HI>Jones</HI> instantly agreed, and was forth∣with conducted to the Lodging of Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> by the very Fellow who had attended the Ladies thi∣ther the Day before.</P>
<P>Nothing more aggravates ill Success than the near Approach to Good. The Gamester, who loses his Party at Piquet by a single Point, laments his bad Luck ten Times as much as he who never came with∣in a Prospect of the Game. So in a Lottery, the Proprietors of the next Numbers to that which wins the great Prize, are apt to account themselves much more unfortunate than their Fellow-Sufferes. In short, these kind of hair-breadth Missings of Happi∣ness, look like the Insults of Fortune, who may be considered as thus playing Tricks with us, and wan∣tonly diverting herself at our Expence.</P>
<P><HI>Jones,</HI> who more than once already had experien∣ced this frolicksome Disposition of the Heathen God∣dess, was now again doomed to be tantalized in the like Manner: For he arrived at the Door of Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> about ten Minutes after the Departure of <HI>Sophia.</HI> He now addressed himself to the Wait∣ing-Woman belonging to Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick;</HI> who told him the disagreeable News, that the Lady was gone, but could not tell him whither; and the same
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>
Answer he afterwards received from Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> herself. For as that Lady made no doubt but that Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was a Person detached from her Uncle <HI>Western,</HI> in Pursuit of his Daughter, so she was too generous to betray her.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Jones</HI> had never seen Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> yet he had heard that a Cousin of <HI>Sophia</HI> was mar∣ried to a Gentleman of that Name. This, however, in the present Tumult of his Mind, never once re∣curred to his Memory: But when the Footman, who had conducted him from his Lordship's, acquainted him with the great Intimacy between the Ladies, and with their calling each other Cousin, he then recol∣lected the Story of the Marriage which he had for∣merly heard; and as he was presently convinced that this was the same Woman, he became more surpriz∣ed at the Answer which he had received, and very earnestly desired Leave to wait on the Lady herself; but she as positively refused him that Honour.</P>
<P><HI>Jones,</HI> who, though he had never seen a Court, was better bred than most who frequent it, was in∣capable of any rude or abrupt Behaviour to a Lady. When he had received, therefore, a peremptory De∣nial, he retired for the present, saying to the waiting Woman, <Q REND="inline">'That if this was an improper Hour to wait on her Lady, he would return in the After∣noon; and that he then hoped to have the Honour of seeing her.'</Q> The Civility with which he uttered this, added to the great Comeliness of his Person, made an Impression on the Waiting-Woman, and she could not help answering; <Q REND="inline">'Perhaps, Sir, you may: And, indeed, she afterwards said every Thing to her Mistress, which she thought most likely to prevail on her to admit a Visit from the handsome young Gen∣tleman; for so she called him.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> very shrewdly suspected, that <HI>Sophia</HI> herself was now with her Cousin, and was denied to him;
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>
which he imputed to her Resentment of what had happened at <HI>Upton.</HI> Having, therefore, dispatched <HI>Partridge</HI> to procure him Lodgings, he remained all Day in the Street, watching the Door where he thought his Angel lay concealed; but no Person did he see issue forth, except a Servant of the House. And in the Evening he returned to pay his Visit to Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> which that good Lady at last con∣descended to admit.</P>
<P>There is a certain Air of natural Gentility, which it is neither in the Power of Dress to give, nor to conceal. Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> as hath been before hinted, was possessed of this in a very eminent Degree. He met, therefore, with a Reception from the Lady, some∣what different from what his Apparel seemed to de∣mand; and after he had paid her his proper Respects, was desired to sit down.</P>
<P>The Reader will not, I believe, be desirous of knowing all the Particulars of this Conversation, which ended very little to the Satisfaction of poor <HI>Jones.</HI> For though Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> soon discovered the Lover, (as all Women have the Eyes of Hawks in those Matters) yet she still thought it was such a Lover, as a generous Friend of the Lady should not betray her to. In short, she suspected this was the very Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> from whom <HI>Sophia</HI> had flown; and all the Answers which she artfully drew from <HI>Jones,</HI> concerning Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Family, confirmed her in this Opinion. She therefore strictly denied any Knowledge concerning the Place whither <HI>Sophia</HI> was gone; nor could <HI>Jones</HI> obtain more than a Permission to wait on her again the next Evening.</P>
<P>When <HI>Jones</HI> was departed, Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> com∣municated her Suspicion concerning Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> to her Maid; who answered, <Q REND="inline">'Sure, Madam, he is too pretty a Man, in my Opinion, for any Woman in the World to run away from. I had rather fancy

it is Mr. <HI>Jones.—</HI>'Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> said the Lady, what <HI>Jones?</HI>'</Q> For <HI>Sophia</HI> had not given the least Hint of any such Person in all their Conversation: But Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> had been much more communica∣tive, and had acquainted her Sister <HI>Abigail</HI> with the whole History of <HI>Jones,</HI> which this now again relat∣ed to her Mistress.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> no sooner received this Informa∣tion, than she immediately agreed with the Opinion of her Maid; and, what is very unaccountable, saw Charms in the gallant, happy Lover, which she had overlooked in the slighted Squire. <Q REND="inline"><HI>'Betty,</HI> says she, 'you are certainly in the right: He is a very pretty Fellow, and I don't wonder that my Cousin's Maid should tell you so many Women are fond of him. I am sorry now I did not inform him where my Cousin was: And yet if he be so terrible a Rake as you tell me, it is a Pity she should ever see him any more; for what but her Ruin can happen from marrying a Rake and a Beggar against her Father's Consent. I protest, if he be such a Man as the Wench described him to you, it is but an Office of Charity to keep her from him; and, I am sure, it would be unpardonable in me to do otherwise, who have tasted so bitterly of the Misfortunes at∣tending such Marriages.'</Q></P>
<P>Here she was interrupted by the Arrival of a Visi∣tor, which was no other than his Lordship; and as nothing passed at this Visit either new or extraordi∣nary, or any Ways material to this History, we shall here put an End to this Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>A Project of Mrs.</HI> Fitzpatrick, <HI>and her Visit to Lady</HI> Bellaston.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> retired to Rest, her Thoughts were entirely taken up by her Cou∣sin <HI>Sophia</HI> and Mr. <HI>Jones.</HI> She was, indeed, a little offended with the former, for the Disingenuity which she now discovered. In which Meditation she had not long exercised her Imagination, before the follow∣ing Conceit suggested itself: That could she possibly become the Means of preserving <HI>Sophia</HI> from this Man, and of restoring her to her Father, she should, in all human Probability, by so great a Service to the Family, reconcile to herself both her Uncle and her Aunt <HI>Western.</HI></P>
<P>As this was one of her most favourite Wishes, so the Hope of Success seemed so reasonable, that no∣thing remained but to consider of proper Methods to accomplish her Scheme. To attempt to reason the Case with <HI>Sophia,</HI> did not appear to her one of those Methods: For as <HI>Betty</HI> had reported from Mrs. <HI>Ho∣nour,</HI> that <HI>Sophia</HI> had a violent Inclination to <HI>Jones,</HI> she conceived, that to dissuade her from the Match, was an Endeavour of the same Kind as it would be, very heartily and earnestly to entreat a Moth not to fly into a Candle.</P>
<P>If the Reader will please to remember, that the Acquaintance which <HI>Sophia</HI> had with Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> was contracted at the House of Mrs. <HI>Western,</HI> and must have grown at the very Time when Mrs. <HI>Fitz∣patrick</HI> lived with this latter Lady, he will want no Information, that Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> must have been acquainted with her likewise. They were, besides, both equally her distant Relations.</P>
<P>After much Consideration, therefore, she resolved to go early in the Morning to that Lady, and endea∣vour
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>
to see her, unknown to <HI>Sophia,</HI> and to acquaint her with the whole Affair. For she did not in the least doubt, but that the prudent Lady, who had often ri∣diculed romantic Love, and indiscreet Marriages, in her Conversation, would very readily concur in her Sentiments concerning this Match, and would lend her utmost Assistance to prevent it.</P>
<P>This Resolution she accordingly executed; and the next Morning before the Sun, she huddled on her Cloaths, and at a very unfashionable, unseasonable, unvisitable Hour went to Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> to whom she got Access, without the least Knowledge or Sus∣picion of <HI>Sophia,</HI> who though not asleep, lay at that Time awake in her Bed, with <HI>Honour</HI> snoring by her Side.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> made many Apologies for this early, abrupt Visit, at an Hour when, <Q REND="inline">'she said, she should not have thought of disturbing her Lady∣ship, but upon Business of the utmost Consequence.'</Q> She then opened the whole Affair, told all she had heard from <HI>Betty;</HI> and did not forget the Visit which <HI>Jones</HI> had paid to herself the preceding Evening.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> answered with a Smile, <Q REND="inline">'Then you have seen this terrible Man, Madam; pray is he so very fine a Figure as he is represented? For <HI>Etoff</HI> entertained me last Night almost two Hours with him. The Wench I believe is in Love with him by Reputation.'</Q> Here the Reader will be apt to wonder, but the Truth is that Mrs. <HI>Etoff</HI> who had the Honour to pin and unpin the Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> had received complete Information concerning the said Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> and had faithfully conveyed the same to her Lady last Night (or rather that Morning) while she was undressing; on which Accounts she had been detained in her Office above the Space of an Hour and half.</P>
<P>The Lady indeed, though generally well enough
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>
pleased with the Narratives of Mrs. <HI>Etoff</HI> at those Seasons, gave an extraordinary Attention to her Ac∣count of <HI>Jones,</HI> for <HI>Honour</HI> had described him as a very handsome Fellow, and Mrs. <HI>Etoff</HI> in her Hurry added so much to the Beauty of his Person to her Report, that Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> began to conceive him to be a kind of Miracle in Nature.</P>
<P>The Curiosity which her Woman had inspired, was now greatly increased by Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> who spoke as much in Favour of the Person of <HI>Jones,</HI> as she had before spoken in Dispraise of his Birth, Cha∣racter and Fortune.</P>
<P>When Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> had heard the whole, she answered gravely, <Q REND="inline">'Indeed Madam, this is a Matter of great Consequence. Nothing can certainly be more commendable than the Part you act, and I shall be very glad to have my Share in the Preser∣vation of a young Lady of so much Merit, and for whom I have so much Esteem.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Doth not your Ladyship think, says Mrs. <HI>Fitz∣patrick</HI> eagerly, that it would be the best Way to write immediately to my Uncle, and acquaint him where my Cousin is?'</Q></P>
<P>The Lady pondered a little upon this, and thus answered—<Q REND="inline">'Why, no, Madam, I think not. <HI>Di Western</HI> hath described her Brother to me to be such a Brute, that I cannot consent to put any Woman under his Power who hath escaped from it. I have heard he behaved like a Monster to his own Wife; for he is one of those Wretches who think they have a Right to tyrannize over us, and from such I shall ever esteem it the Cause of my Sex to res∣cue any Woman who is so unfortunate to be under their Power.—The Business, dear Cousin, will be only to keep Miss <HI>Western</HI> from seeing this young Fellow, till the good Company, which she will
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>
have an Opportunity of meeting here, give her a proper Turn.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'If he should find her out, Madam, answered the other, your Ladyship may be assured he will leave nothing unattempted to come at her.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'But Madam, replied the Lady, it is impossible he should come here,—tho' indeed it is possible he may get some intelligence where she is, and then may lurk about the House.—I wish therefore I knew his Person.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Is there no Way, Madam, by which I could have a Sight of him? For otherwise you know, Cousin, she may contrive to see him here without my Knowledge.'</Q> Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> answer'd, <Q REND="inline">'that he had threatened her with another Visit that Af∣ternoon, and that in her Ladyship pleased to do her the Honour of calling upon her then, she would hardly fail of seeing him between six and seven, and if he came earlier, she would, by some Means or other, detain him till her Ladyship's Arrival.'</Q>—Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> replied, <Q REND="inline">'she would come the Mo∣ment she could get from Dinner, which she sup∣posed would be by seven at farthest, for that it was absolutely necessary she should be acquainted with his Person. Upon my Word, Madam, says she, it was very good to take this Care of Miss <HI>Western,</HI> but common Humanity as well as Regard to our Family requires it of us both, for it would be a dreadful Match indeed.'</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> failed not to make a proper Re∣turn to the Compliment which Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> had bestow'd on her Cousin, and after some little imma∣terial Conversation withdrew, and getting as fast as she could into her Chair unseen by <HI>Sophia</HI> or <HI>Honour,</HI> returned home.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Which consists of Visiting.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Jones</HI> had walked within Sight of a certain Door during the whole Day, which, though one of the shortest, appeared to him to be one of the longest in the whole Year. At length the Clock having struck five he returned to Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> who, though it was a full Hour earlier than the decent Time of visiting, receiv'd him very civilly; but still persisted in her Ig∣norance concerning <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> in asking for his Angel, had drop'd the Word Cousin; upon which Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> said, <Q REND="inline">'Then, Sir, you know we are related, and as we are, you will permit me the Right of enquiring into the Par∣ticulars of your Business with my Cousin.'</Q> Here <HI>Jones</HI> hesitated a good while, and at last answered, He had a considerable Sum of Money of hers in his Hands, which he desired to deliver to her. He then produced the Pocket-book, and acquainted Mrs. <HI>Fitz∣patrick</HI> with the Contents, and with the Method in which they came into his Hands. He had scarce fi∣nished his Story when a most violent Noise shook the whole House. To attempt to describe this Noise to those who have heard it would be in vain, and to aim at giving any Idea of it to those who have never heard the like, would be still more vain: For it may be truly said,</P>
<Q><L>—Non acuta</L>
<L>Sic geminant Corybantes Aera.</L></Q>
<Q><HI>The Priests of</HI> Cybele <HI>do not so rattle their sound∣ing Brass.</HI></Q>
<P>In short a Footman knocked, or rather thundered at the Door. <HI>Jones</HI> was a little surprised at the
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>
Sound, having never heard it before; but Mrs. <HI>Fitz∣patrick</HI> very calmly said, that as some Company were coming, she could not make him any Answer now; but if he pleased to stay till they were gone, she inti∣mated she had something to say to him.</P>
<P>The Door of the Room now flew open, and, af∣ter pushing in her Hoop sideways before her, entered Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> who having first made a very low Curtesy to Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> and as low a one to Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> was ushered to the upper End of the Room.</P>
<P>We mention these minute Matters for the Sake of some Country Ladies of our Acquaintance, who think it contrary to the Rules of Modesty to bend their Knees to a Man.</P>
<P>The Company were hardly well settled, before the Arrival of the Peer lately mentioned caused a fresh Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>urbance and a Repetition of Ceremonials.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here being over, the Conversation began to be (as the Phrase is) extremely brilliant. However, as nothing past in it which can be thought material to this History, or, indeed, very material in itself, I shall omit the Relation; the rather as I have known some very fine polite Conversation grow extreamly dull, when transcribed into Books, or repeated on the Stage. Indeed this mental Repast is a Dainty, of which those who are excluded from polite Assemblies, must be contented to remain as ignorant as they must of the several Dainties of <HI>French</HI> Cookery, which are only served at the Tables of the <HI>Great.</HI> To say the Truth, as neither of these are adapted to every Taste, they might both be often thrown away on the Vulgar.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Jones</HI> was rather a Spectator of this elegant Scene, than an Actor in it; for though in the short Interval before the Peer's Arrival, Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> first, and afterwards Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> had addressed some of their Discourse to him; yet no sooner was
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>
the noble Lord entered, than he engrossed the whole Attention of the two Ladies to himself; and as he took no more Notice of <HI>Jones</HI> than if no such Person had been present, unless by now and then staring at him, the Ladies followed his Example.</P>
<P>The Company had now staid so long, that Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> plainly perceived they all designed to stay out each other. She therefore resolved to rid herself of <HI>Jones,</HI> he being the Visitant, to whom she thought the least Ceremony was due. Taking therefore an Opportunity of a Cessation of Chat, she addressed herself gravely to him, and said, <Q REND="inline">'Sir, I shall not possibly be able to give you an Answer To-night, as to that Business; but if you please to leave Word where I may send to you To-morrow.'</Q>—</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> had natural, but not artificial good Breeding. Instead therefore of communicating the Secret of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is Lodgings to a Servant, he acquainted the Lady <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣self with it particularly, and soon after very ceremo∣niously withdrew.</P>
<P>He was no sooner gone, than the great Personages who had taken no Notice of him present, began to take much Notice of him in his Absence; but if the Reader hath already excused us from relating the more brilliant Part of this Conversation, he will surely be very ready to excuse the Repetition of what may be called vulgar Abuse: Though, perhaps, it may be material to our History to mention an Observation of Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> who took her Leave in a few Mi∣nutes after him, and then said to Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> at her Departure. <Q REND="inline">'I am satisfied on the Account of my Cousin, she can be in no Danger from this Fellow.'</Q></P>
<P>Our History shall follow the Example of Lady <HI>Bel∣laston,</HI> and take Leave of the present Company, which was now reduced to two Persons; between whom, as nothing passed, which in the least concerns us or our Reader, we shall not suffer ourselves to be
<PB N="19" REF="24"/>
diverted by it from Matters which must seem of more Consequence to all those who are at all interested in the Affairs of our Heroe.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>An Adventure which happened to Mr.</HI> Jones, <HI>at his Lodgings, with some Account of a young Gentle∣man who lodged there, and of the Mistress of the House, and her two Daughters.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE next Morning as early as it was decent, <HI>Jones</HI> attended at Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick'</HI>s Door, where he was answered that the Lady was not at Home; an Answer which surprised him the more, as he had walked backwards and forwards in the Street from Break of Day; and if she had gone out, he must have seen her. This Answer, however, he was o∣bliged to receive, and not only now, but to five several Visits which he made her that Day. To be plain with the Reader, the noble Peer, had from some Reason or other, perhaps from a Regard for the Lady's Honour, insisted that she should not see Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> whom he looked on as a Scrub, any more; and the Lady had complied in making that Promise to which we now see her so strictly adhere.</P>
<P>But as our gentle Reader may possibly have a better Opinion of the young Gentleman than her Lady∣ship, and may even have some Concern, should it be apprehended, that during this unhappy Separation from <HI>Sophia,</HI> he took up his Residence either at an Inn, or in the Street; we shall now give an Ac∣count of his Lodging, which was indeed in a very reputable House, and in a very good Part of the Town.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> then had often heard Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> mention the Gentlewoman at whose House he used to lodge when he was in Town. This Person, who as
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>
<HI>Jones</HI> likewise knew, lived in <HI>Bond-Street,</HI> was the Widow of a Clergyman, and was left by him at his Decease, in Possession of two Daughters, and of a compleat Set of Manuscript Sermons.</P>
<P>Of these two Daughters, <HI>Nancy,</HI> the elder, was now arrived at the Age of seventeen, and <HI>Betty,</HI> the younger at that of ten.</P>
<P>Hither <HI>Jones</HI> had dispatched <HI>Partridge,</HI> and in this House he was provided with a Room for himself in the second Floor, and with one for <HI>Partridge</HI> in the fourth.</P>
<P>The first Floor was inhabited by one of those young Gentlemen, who, in the last Age were called Men of Wit and Pleasure about Town, and properly enough: For as Men are usually denominated from their Business or Profession, so Pleasure may be said to have been the only Business or Profession of those Gentlemen to whom Fortune had made all useful Occupations unnecessary. Play-Houses, Coffee-Houses and Taverns were the Scenes of their Rendezvous, Wit and Humour were the Entertainment of their looser Hours, and Love was the Business of their more serious Moments. Wine and the Muses conspired to kindle the brightest Flames in their Breasts; nor did they only admire, but some were able to celebrate the Beauty they admired, and all to judge of the Merit of such Compositions.</P>
<P>Such therefore were properly called the Men of Wit and Pleasure; but I question whether the same Appellation may, with the same Propriety, be given to those young Gentlemen of our Times, who have the same Ambition to be distinguished for Parts. Wit certainly they have nothing to do with. To give them their due, they soar a Step higher than their Predeces∣sors, and may be called Men of Wisdom and Vertù (take heed you do not read Virtue). Thus at an Age when the Gentlemen abovementioned employed their Time in toasting the Charms of a Woman, or in
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>
making Sonnets in her Praise; in giving their Opinion of a Play at the Theatre, or of a Poem at <HI>Will'</HI>s or <HI>Button'</HI>s; these Gentlemen are considering of Me∣thods to bribe a Corporation, or meditating Speeches for the House of Commons, or rather for the Maga∣zines. But the Science of Gaming is that which a∣bove all others employs their Thoughts. These are the Studies of their graver Hours, while for their A∣musements they have the vast Circle of Connoisseur∣ship, Painting, Music, Statuary, and natural Philo∣sophy, or rather <HI>unnatural,</HI> which deals in the Won∣derful, and knows nothing of Nature, except her Monsters and Imperfections.</P>
<P>When <HI>Jones</HI> had spent the whole Day in vain En∣quiries after Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> he returned at last dis∣consolate to his Apartment. Here while he was vent∣ing his Grief in private, he heard a violent Uproar be∣low Stairs; and soon after a female Voice begged him for Heaven's Sake to come and prevent Murder. <HI>Jones,</HI> who was never backward on any Occasion, to help the Distressed, immediately ran down Stairs; when stepping into the Dining-room, whence all the Noise issued, he beheld the young Gentleman of Wis∣dom and <HI>Vertù</HI> just before mentioned, pinned close to the Wall by his Footman, and a young Woman standing by, wringing her Hands, and crying out, <Q REND="inline">'He will be murdered, he will be murdered; and indeed the poor Gentleman seemed in some Danger of being choaked,'</Q> when <HI>Jones</HI> flew hastily to his Assis∣tance, and rescued him just as he was breathing his last, from the unmerciful Clutches of the Enemy.</P>
<P>Though the Fellow had received several Kicks and Cuffs from the little Gentleman, who had more Spirit than Strength, he had made it a kind of Scruple of Conscience to strike his Master, and would have con∣tented himself with only choaking him; but towards <HI>Jones</HI> he bore no such Respect: He no sooner there∣fore
<PB N="22" REF="27"/>
found himself a little roughly handled by his new Antagonist, than he gave him one of those Punches in the Guts, which, tho' the Spectators at <HI>Brough∣ton'</HI>s Amphitheatre have such exquisite Delight in Seeing them, convey but very little Pleasure in the Feeling.</P>
<P>The lusty Youth had no sooner received this Blow, than he meditated a most grateful Return; and now ensued a Combat between <HI>Jones</HI> and the Footman, which was very fierce, but short; for this Fellow was no more able to contend with <HI>Jones,</HI> than his Master had before been to contend with him.</P>
<P>And now Fortune, according to her usual Custom, reversed the Face of Affairs, the former Victor lay breathless on the Ground, and the vanquished Gentle∣man had recovered Breath enough to thank Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> for his seasonable Assistance: He received likewise the hearty Thanks of the young Woman present, who was indeed no other than Miss <HI>Nancy,</HI> the eldest Daughter of the House.</P>
<P>The Footman having now recovered his Legs, shook his Head at <HI>Jones,</HI> and with a sagacious Look, cry'd,—O d—n me, I'll have nothing more to do with you, you have been upon the Stage, or I am d—nably mistaken: And indeed we may forgive this his Suspicion; for such was the Agility and Strength of our Heroe, that he was perhaps a Match for one of the first Rate Boxers, and could with great Ease, have beaten all the muffled <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lest Posterity should be puzzled by this Epithet, I think proper to explain it by an Advertisement which was published <HI>Feb.</HI> 1. 1747.
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Mr. <HI>Broughton</HI> proposes, with proper Assistance, to open an Academy at his House in the <HI>Hay-Market,</HI> for the Instruction of those who are willing to be initiated in the Mystery of Boxing; where the whole Theory and Practice of that truly <HI>British</HI> Art, with all the various Stops, Blows, Cross-Buttocks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> incident to Comba∣tants, will be fully taught and explain'd; and that Persons of Quality and Distinction may not be deterred from en∣tering into <HI>a Course of these Lectures,</HI> they will be given with the utmost Tenderness and Regard to the Delicacy of the Frame and Constitution of the Pupil, for which Rea∣son Mufflers are provided, that will effectually secure them from the Inconveniency of black Eyes, broken Jaws, and bloody Noses.</P></NOTE> Graduates of Mr. <HI>Broughton'</HI>s School.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="28"/>
His Master foaming with Wrath, ordered his Man immediately to strip, to which the latter very readily agreed, on Condition of receiving his Wages. This Condition was presently complied with, and the Fel∣low was discharged.</P>
<P>And now the young Gentleman whose Name was <HI>Nightingale,</HI> very strenuously insisted that his Deli∣verer should take Part of a Bottle of Wine with him; to which <HI>Jones,</HI> after much Entreaty, consented; tho' more out of Complaisance than Inclination; for the Uneasiness of his Mind fitted him very little for Conversation at this Time. Miss <HI>Nancy</HI> likewise, who was the only Female then in the House, her Mamma and Sister being gone to the Play, condescend∣ed to favour them with her Company.</P>
<P>When the Bottle and Glasses were on the Table, the Gentleman began to relate the Occasion of the preceding Disturbance.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I hope, Sir, said he to <HI>Jones,</HI> you will not, from this Accident, conclude, that I make a Custom of striking my Servants; for I assure you this is the first Time I have been guilty of it in my Remem∣brance, and I have passed by many provoking Faults in this very Fellow, before he could pro∣voke me to it; but when you hear what hath hap∣pened this Evening, you will, I believe, think me
<PB N="24" REF="29"/>
excuseable. I happened to come home several Hours before my usual Time, when I found four Gentle∣men of the Cloth at Whisk by my Fire;—and my <HI>Hoyle,</HI> Sir,—my best <HI>Hoyle,</HI> which cost me a Guinea, lying open on the Table, with a Quantity of Porter spilt on one of the most material Leaves of the whole Book. This, you will allow, was provoking; but I said nothing till the rest of the honest Company were gone, and then gave the Fel∣low a gentle Rebuke, who, instead of expressing any Concern, made me a pert Answer, <Q REND="inline">'"That Servants must have their Diversions as well as other People; that he was sorry for the Accident which had happened to the Book; but that several of his Acquaintance had bought the same for a Shilling; and that I might stop as much in his Wages if I pleased:"</Q> 'I now gave him a severer Reprimand than before, when the Rascal had the Insolence to—In short he imputed my early coming Home to—In short, he cast a Reflection,—He men∣tioned the Name of a young Lady, in a Manner—In such a Manner that incensed me be∣yond all Patience, and in my Passion, I struck him.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> answered, <Q REND="inline">'That he believed no Person liv∣ing would blame him; for my Part, said he, I con∣fess I should on the last mentioned Provocation, have done the same Thing.'</Q></P>
<P>Our Company had not sat long before they were joined by the Mother and Daughter, at their Return from the Play. And now they all spent a very chear∣ful Evening together, for all but <HI>Jones</HI> were heartily merry, and even he put on as much constrained Mirth as possible. Indeed half his natural Flow of animal Spirits, joined to the Sweetness of his Temper, was sufficient to make a most amiable Companion; and notwithstanding the Heaviness of his Heart, so agree∣able did he make himself on the present Occasion,
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>
that at their breaking up, the young Gentleman ear∣nestly desired his further Acquaintance. Miss <HI>Nancy</HI> was well pleased with him; and the Widow, quite charm'd with her new Lodger, invited him with the other, next Morning to Breakfast.</P>
<P><HI>Jones,</HI> on his Part, was no less satisfied. As for Miss <HI>Nancy,</HI> tho' a very little Creature, she was ex∣tremely pretty, and the Widow had all the Charms which can adorn a Woman near fifty. As she was one of the most innocent Creatures in the World, so she was one of the most chearful. She never thought, nor spoke, nor wished any ill, and had constantly that Desire of pleasing, which may be called the happiest of all Desires in this, that it scarce ever fails of at∣taining its Ends, when not disgraced by Affectation. In short, though her Power was very small, she was in her Heart one of the warmest Friends. She had been a most affectionate Wife, and was a most fond and tender Mother.</P>
<P>As our History doth not, like a News-Paper, give great Characters to People who never were heard of before, nor will ever be heard of again; the Reader may hence conclude, that this excellent Woman will hereafter appear to be of some Importance in our History.</P>
<P>Nor was <HI>Jones</HI> a little pleased with the young Gentleman himself, whose Wine he had been drink∣ing. He thought he discerned in him much good Sense, though a little too much tainted with Town Fop∣pery; but what recommended him most to <HI>Jones</HI> were some Sentiments of great Generosity and Hu∣manity, which occasionally dropt from him; and par∣ticularly many Expressions of the highest Disinterested∣ness in the Affair of Love. On which Subject the young Gentleman delivered himself in a Language which might have very well become an <HI>Arcadian</HI> Shepherd of Old, and which appeared very extraordinary when
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>
proceeding from the Lips of a modern fine Gentle∣man, but he was only one by Imitation, and meant by Nature for a much better Character.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>What arrived while the Company were at Breakfast, with some Hints concerning the Government of Daughters.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OUR Company brought together in the Morning the same good Inclinations towards each other, with which they had separated the Evening before; but poor <HI>Jones</HI> was extreme disconsolate; for he had just received Information from <HI>Partridge,</HI> that Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> had left her Lodging, and that he could not learn whither she was gone. This News highly affected him, and his Countenance, as well as his Be∣haviour, in Defiance of all his Endeavours to the contrary, betrayed manifest Indications of a disorder∣ed Mind.</P>
<P>The Discourse turned at present, as before, on Love; and Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> again expressed many of those warm, generous, and disinterested Senti∣ments upon this Subject, which wise and sober Men call romantic, but which wise and sober Women ge∣nerally regard in a better Light. Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> (for so the Mrs. of the House was called) greatly approved these Sentiments; but when the young Gentleman appealed to Miss <HI>Nancy,</HI> she answered only, <Q REND="inline">'That she believed the Gentleman who had spoke the least, was capable of feeling the most.'</Q></P>
<P>This Compliment was so apparently directed to <HI>Jones,</HI> that we should have been sorry had he passed it by unregarded. He made her indeed a very polite An∣swer, and concluded with an oblique Hint, that her own Silence subjected her to a Suspicion of the same
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>
Kind: For indeed she had scarce opened her Lips ei∣ther now, or the last Evening.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I am glad <HI>Nanny,</HI> says Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> the Gentle∣man hath made the Observation; I protest I am al∣most of his Opinion. What can be the Matter with you Child? I never saw such an Alteration. What is become of all your Gayety? Would you think, Sir, I used to call her my little Prattler. She hath not spoke twenty Words this Week.'</Q></P>
<P>Here their Conversation was interrupted by the En∣trance of a Maid-Servant, who brought a Bundle in her Hands, which, she said, <Q REND="inline">'was delivered by a Por∣ter for Mr. <HI>Jones.</HI>'</Q> She added, <Q REND="inline">'that the Man immediately went away, saying, it required no Answer.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> expressed some Surprize on this Occasion, and declared it must be some Mistake: But the Maid persisting that she was certain of the Name, all the Women were desirous of having the Bundle imme∣diately opened; which Operation was at length per∣formed by little <HI>Betsy,</HI> with the Consent of Mr. <HI>Jones;</HI> and the Contents were found to be a Domino, a Mask, and a Masquerade Ticket.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> was now more positive than ever, in assert∣ing, that these Things must have been delivered by Mistake; and Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> herself expressed some Doubt, and said, <Q REND="inline">'she knew not what to think.'</Q> But when Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> was asked, he delivered a very different Opinion. <Q REND="inline">'All I can conclude from it, Sir,' said he, 'is, that you are a very happy Man: For I make no doubt but these were sent you by some Lady whom you will have the Happiness of meeting at the Masquerade.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> had not a sufficient Degree of Vanity to en∣tertain any such flattering Imagination; nor did Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> herself give much Assent to what Mr. <HI>Night∣ingale</HI> had said, 'till Miss <HI>Nancy</HI> having lifted up the
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>
Domino, a Card dropt from the Sleeve, in which was written as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>To Mr.</HI> Jones.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<L>The Queen of the Fairies sends you this,</L>
<L>Use her Favours not amiss.</L>
</LETTER>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> and Miss <HI>Nancy</HI> now both agreed with Mr. <HI>Nightingale;</HI> nay, <HI>Jones</HI> himself was almost persuaded to be of the same Opinion. And as no other Lady but Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> he thought, knew his Lodging, he began to flatter himself with some Hopes that it came from her, and that he might pos∣sibly see his <HI>Sophia.</HI> These Hopes had surely very little Foundation; but as the Conduct of Mr. <HI>Fitz∣patrick,</HI> in not seeing him according to her Promise, and in quitting her Lodgings, had been very odd and unaccountable, he conceived some faint Hopes, that she (of whom he had formerly heard a very whim∣sical Character) might possibly intend to do him that Service, in a strange Manner, which she declined do∣ing by more ordinary Methods. To say the Truth, as nothing certain could be concluded from so odd and uncommon an Incident, he had the greater Lati∣tude to draw what imaginary Conclusions from it he pleased. As his Temper therefore was naturally san∣guine, he indulged it on this Occasion, and his Ima∣gination worked up a thousand Conceits, to favour and support his Expectations of meeting his dear <HI>So∣phia</HI> in the Evening.</P>
<P>Reader, if thou hast any good Wishes towards me, I will fully repay them, by wishing thee to be posses∣sed of this sanguine Disposition of Mind: Since, after having read much, and considered long on that Sub∣ject of Happiness which hath employed so many great Pens, I am almost inclined to fix it in the Possession of this Temper; which puts us; in a Manner, out of the Reach of Fortune, and makes us happy with∣out
<PB N="29" REF="34"/>
her Assistance. Indeed the Sensations of Pleasure it gives are much more constant, as well as much keener than those which that blind Lady bestows; Nature having wisely contrived, that some Satiety and Languor should be annexed to all our real Enjoy∣ments, lest we should be so taken up by them, as to be stopt from further Pursuits. I make no Manner of doubt but that, in this Light, we may see the ima∣ginary future Chancellor just called to the Bar, the Archbishop in Crape, and the Prime Minister at the Tail of an Opposition, more truly happy than those who are invested with all the Power and Profit of these respective Offices.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> having now determined to go to the Mas∣querade that Evening, Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> offered to conduct him thither. The young Gentleman, at the same Time, offered Tickets to Miss <HI>Nancy</HI> and her Mother; but the good Woman would not accept them. She said, <Q REND="inline">'She did not conceive the Harm which some People imagined in a Masquerade; but that such extravagant Diversions were only proper for Persons of Quality and Fortune, and not for young Women who were to get their Living, and could, at best, hope to be married to a good Tradesman.'</Q></P>
<P>—<Q REND="inline">'A Tradesman! cries <HI>Nightingale,</HI> you shan't undervalue my <HI>Nancy.</HI> There is not a Nobleman upon Earth above her Merit.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'O fie! Mr. <HI>Nightingale,</HI>' answered Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> 'you must not fill the Girl's Head with such Fancies: But if it was her good Luck (says the Mother with a Simper) to find a Gentleman of your generous Way of thinking, I hope she would make a better Return to his Generosity, than to give her Mind up to ex∣travagant Pleasures. Indeed where young Ladies bring great Fortunes themselves, they have some Right to insist on spending what is their own:
<PB N="30" REF="35"/>
and on that Account, I have heard the Gentlemen say, a Man has sometimes a better Bargain with a poor Wife, than with a rich one.—But let my Daughters marry whom they will, I shall en∣deavour to make them Blessings to their Husbands:—I beg, therefore, I may hear of no more Masquerades. <HI>Nancy</HI> is, I am certain, too good a Girl to desire to go; for she must remember when you carried her thither last Year, it almost turned her Head, and she did not return to her∣self, or to her Needle, in a Month afterwards.'</Q></P>
<P>Though a gentle Sigh which stole from the Bosom of <HI>Nancy,</HI> seemed to argue some secret Disapprobation of these Sentiments, she did not dare openly to oppose them. For as this good Woman had all the Tender∣ness, so she had preserved all the Authority of a Pa∣rent; and as her Indulgence to the Desires of her Children, was only restrained, by her Fears for their Safety and future Welfare, so she never suffered those Commands, which proceeded from such Fears, to be either disobeyed or disputed. And this the young Gentleman who had lodged two Years in the House, knew so well, that he presently acquiesced in the Refusal.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nightingale,</HI> who grew every Minute fonder of <HI>Jones,</HI> was very desirous of his Company that Day to Dinner at the Tavern, where he offered to intro∣duce him to some of his Acquaintance; but <HI>Jones</HI> begged to be excused, <Q REND="inline">'as his Cloaths, he said, were not yet come to Town.'</Q></P>
<P>To confess the Truth, Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was now in a Situation, which sometimes happens to be the Case of young Gentlemen of much better Figure than him∣self. In short, he had not one Penny in his Pocket; a Situation in much greater Credit among the ancient Philosophers, than among the modern wise Men who live in <HI>Lombard</HI> Street, or those who frequent <HI>White'</HI>s
<PB N="31" REF="36"/>
Chocolate House. And, perhaps, the great Honours which those Philosophers have ascribed to an empty Pocket, may be one of the Reasons of that high Con∣tempt in which they are held in the aforesaid Street and Chocolate-House.</P>
<P>Now if the antient Opinion, that Men might live very comfortably on Virtue only, be, as the modern wise Men just above-mentioned pretend to have dis∣covered, a notorious Error; no less false is, I appre∣hend, that Position of some Writers of Romance, that a Man can live altogether on Love: For how∣ever delicious Repasts this may afford to some of our Senses or Appetites, it is most certain it can afford none to others. Those, therefore, who have placed too great a Confidence in such Writers, have expe∣rienced their Error when it was too late; and have found that Love was no more capable of allaying Hunger, than a Rose is capable of delighting the Ear, or a Violin of gratifying the Smell.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, therefore, all the Delicacies which Love had set before him, namely, the Hopes of see∣ing <HI>Sophia</HI> at the Masquerade; on which, however ill-founded his Imagination might be, he had volup∣tuously feasted during the whole Day, the Evening no sooner came, than Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> began to languish for some Food of a grosser Kind. <HI>Partridge</HI> disco∣vered this by Intution, and took the Occasion to give some oblique Hints concerning the Bank-bill, and when those were rejected with Disdain, he collected Courage enough once more to mention a Return to Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>'Partridge,</HI> cries <HI>Jones,</HI> you cannot see my Fortune in a more desperate Light than I see it my∣self; and I begin heartily to repent, that I suffered you to leave a Place, where you was settled, and to follow me. However, I insist now on your return∣ing Home; and for the Expence and Trouble which
<PB N="32" REF="37"/>
you have so kindly put yourself to on my Account, all the Cloaths I left behind in your Care, I desire you would take as your own. I am sorry I can make you no other Acknowledgment.'</Q></P>
<P>He spoke these Words with so pathetic an Accent, that <HI>Partridge,</HI> among whose Vices Ill-Nature or Hardness of Heart were not numbered, burst into Tears; and after swearing he would not quit him in his Distress, he began with the most earnest Intrea∣ties to urge his return Home. <Q REND="inline">'For Heaven's Sake, Sir,' says he, 'do but consider: What can your Ho∣nour do? How is it possible you can live in this Town without Money? Do what you will, Sir, or go wherever you please, I am resolved not to desert you.—But pray, Sir, consider,—Do pray, Sir, for your own Sake, take it into your Consideration; and I'm sure,' says he, 'that your own Good-Sense will bid you return Home.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'How often shall I tell thee, answered <HI>Jones,</HI> that I have no Home to return to. Had I any Hopes that Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Doors would be open to receive me, I want no Distress to urge me:—Nay, there is no other Cause upon Earth, which could detain me a Moment from flying to his Pre∣sence, but, alas! that I am for ever banished from it. His last Words were,—O <HI>Partridge,</HI> they still ring in my Ears—His last Words were, when he gave me a Sum of Money, what it was I know not, but considerable I'm sure it was.—His last Words were—I am resolved from this Day forward, on no Account, to converse with you any more.'</Q></P>
<P>Here Passion stopt the Mouth of <HI>Jones;</HI> as Sur∣prize, for a Moment, did that of <HI>Partridge:</HI> But he soon recovered the Use of Speech, and after a short Preface, in which he declared he had no Inquisitive∣ness in his Temper, enquired, what <HI>Jones</HI> meant by
<PB N="33" REF="38"/>
a considerable Sum; he knew not how much; and what was become of the Money?</P>
<P>In both these Points he now received full Satisfac∣tion; on which he was proceeding to comment, when he was interrupted by a Message from Mr. <HI>Nightin∣gale,</HI> who desired his Master's Company in his Apart∣ment.</P>
<P>When the two Gentlemen were both attired for the Masquerade, and Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> had given Or∣ders for Chairs to be sent for, a Circumstance of Dis∣tress occurred to <HI>Jones,</HI> which will appear very ridi∣culous to many of my Readers. This was how to procure a Shilling; but if such Readers will reflect a little on what they have themselves felt from the Want of a thousand Pound, or, perhaps, of ten or twenty, to execute a favourite Scheme, they will have a per∣fect Idea of what Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> felt on this Occasion. For this Sum, therefore, he applied to <HI>Partridge,</HI> which was the first he had permitted him to advance, and was the last he intended that poor Fellow should advance in his Service. To say the Truth, <HI>Partridge</HI> had lately made no Offer of this Kind; whether it was that he desired to see the Bank-bill broke in up∣on, or that Distress should prevail on <HI>Jones</HI> to re∣turn Home, or from what other Motive it proceed∣ed, I will not determine.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>Containing the whole Humours of a Masquerade.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OUR Cavaliers now arrived at that Temple, where <HI>Heydegger,</HI> the great <HI>Arbiter Deliciarum,</HI> the great High-Priest of Pleasure presides; and, like other Heathen Priests, imposes on his Votaries by the pretended Presence of the Deity, when in reality no such Deity is there.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> having taken a Turn or two with
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>
his Companion, soon left him, and walked off with a Female, saying, <Q REND="inline">'Now you are here, Sir, you must beat about for your own Game.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> began to entertain strong Hopes that his <HI>So∣phia</HI> was present; and these Hopes gave him more Spirits than the Lights, the Music, and the Compa∣ny; though these are pretty strong Antidotes against the Spleen. He now accosted every Woman he saw, whose Stature, Shape, or Air, bore any Resemblance to his Angel. To all of whom he endeavoured to say something smart, in order to engage an Answer, by which he might discover that Voice which he thought it impossible he should mistake. Some of these answered by a Question, in a squeaking Voice, <HI>Do you know me?</HI> Much the greater Numbers said, <HI>I don't know you, Sir;</HI> and nothing more. Some called him an impertinent Fellow; some made him no An∣swer at all; some said, <HI>Indeed I don't know your Voice, and I shall have nothing to say to you;</HI> and many gave him as kind Answers as he could wish, but not in the Voice he desired to hear.</P>
<P>Whilst he was talking with one of these last, (who was in the Habit of a Shepherdess) a Lady in a Do∣mino came up to him, and slapping him on the Shoul∣der, whispered him, at the same Time, in the Ear, <Q REND="inline">'If you talk any longer with that Trollop, I will acquaint Miss <HI>Western.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> no sooner heard that Name, than, immedi∣ately quitting his former Companion, he applied to the Domino, begging and entreating her to shew him the Lady she had mentioned, if she was then in the Room.</P>
<P>The Mask walked hastily to the upper end of the innermost Apartment before she spoke, and then, in∣stead of answering him, sat down, and declared she was tired. <HI>Jones</HI> sat down by her, and still persisted in his Entreaties; at last the Lady coldly answered,
<PB N="35" REF="40"/>
<Q REND="inline">'I imagined Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> had been a more discerning Lover, than to suffer any Disguise to conceal his Mistress from him. Is she here then, Madam? replied <HI>Jones,</HI> with much Vehemence.'</Q> Upon which the Lady cry'd,—<Q REND="inline">'Hush, Sir, you will be observ∣ed—I promise you, upon my Honour, Miss <HI>We∣stern</HI> is not here.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> now taking the Mask by the Hand, fell to entreating her in the most earnest Manner, to ac∣quaint him where he might find <HI>Sophia:</HI> And when he could obtain no direct Answer, he began to up∣braid her gently for having disappointed him the Day before; and concluded, saying, <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, my good Fairy Queen, I know your Majesty very well, not∣withstanding the affected Disguise of your Voice. Indeed, Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> it is a little cruel to di∣vert yourself at the Expence of my Torments.'</Q></P>
<P>The Mask answered, <Q REND="inline">'Though you have so inge∣niously discovered me, I must still speak in the same Voice, lest I should be known by others. And do you think, good Sir, that I have no greater Regard for my Cousin, than to assist in carrying on an Affair between you two, which must end in her Ruin, as well as your own? Besides, I promise you, my Cousin is not mad enough to consent to her own Destruction, if you are so much her Ene∣my as to tempt her to it.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Alas, Madam, said <HI>Jones,</HI> you little know my Heart, when you call me an Enemy of <HI>Sophia.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'And yet to ruin any one, cries the other, you will allow, is the Act of an Enemy; and when by the same Act you must knowingly and certainly bring Ruin on yourself, is it not Folly or Madness, as well as Guilt? Now, Sir, my Cousin hath very little more than her Father will please to give her; very little for one of her Fashion,—you know him, and you know your own Situation.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="41"/>
<HI>Jones</HI> vowed he had no such Design on <HI>Sophia,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'That he would rather suffer the most violent of Deaths than sacrifice her Interest to his Desires. He said, he knew how unworthy he was of her every Way; that he had long ago resolved to quit all such aspiring Thoughts, but that some strange Accidents had made him desirous to see her once more, when he promised he would take Leave of her for ever. No, Madam, concluded he, my Love is not of that base Kind which seeks its own Satisfaction, at the Expence of what is most dear to its Object. I would sacrifice every Thing to the Possession of my <HI>Sophia,</HI> but <HI>Sophia</HI> herself.'</Q></P>
<P>Though the Reader may have already conceived no very sublime Idea of the Virtue of the Lady in the Mask; and tho' possibly she may hereafter appear not to deserve one of the first Characters of her Sex; yet, it is certain, these generous Sentiments made a strong Impression upon her, and greatly added to the Affec∣tion she had before conceived for our young Heroe.</P>
<P>The Lady now, after a Silence of a few Moments, said, <Q REND="inline">'She did not see his Pretensions to <HI>Sophia</HI> so much in the Light of Presumption, as of Impru∣dence. Young Fellows, says she, can never have too aspiring Thoughts. I love Ambition in a young Man, and I would have you cultivate it as much as possible. Perhaps you may succeed with those who are infinitely superior in Fortune, nay, I am con∣vinced there are Women,—but don't you think me a stronge Creature, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> to be thus giv∣ing Advice to a Man, with whom I am so little acquainted, and one with whose Behaviour to me I have so little Reason to be pleased?'</Q></P>
<P>Here <HI>Jones</HI> began to apologize, and to hope he had not offended in any thing he had said of her Cousin. —To which the Mask answered, <Q REND="inline">'And are you so little versed in the Sex, to imagine you can well
<PB N="37" REF="42"/>
affront a Lady more, than by entertaining her with your Passion for another Woman? If the Fairy Queen had had no better Opinion of your Gallan∣try, she would scarce have appointed you to meet her at a Masquerade.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> had never less Inclination to an Amour than at present; but Gallantry to the Ladies was among his Principles of Honour; and he held it as much incum∣bent on him to accept a Challenge to Love, as if it had been a Challenge to Fight. Nay, his very Love to <HI>Sophia</HI> made it necessary for him to keep well with the Lady, as he made no doubt but she was capable of bringing him into the Presence of the other.</P>
<P>He began therefore to make a very warm Answer to her last Speech, when a Mask in the Character of an old Woman, joined them. This Mask was one of those Ladies who go to a Masquerade only to vent Ill-nature, by telling People rude Truths, and by en∣deavouring, as the Phrase is, to spoil as much Sport as they are able. This good Lady therefore, having observed <HI>Jones,</HI> and his Friend, whom she well knew, in close Consultation together in a Corner of the Room, concluded she could no where satisfy her Spleen better than by interrupting them. She attack∣ed them therefore, and soon drove them from their Retirement; nor was she contented with this, but pursued them to every Place which they shifted to avoid her; till Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> seeing the Distress of his Friend, at last relieved him, and engaged the old Woman in another Pursuit.</P>
<P>While <HI>Jones</HI> and his Mask were walking together about the Room, to rid themselves of the Teazer, he observed his Lady speak to several Masks, with the same Freedom of Acquaintance as if they had been barefaced. He could not help expressing his Surprise at this, saying, <Q REND="inline">'Sure, Madam, you must have in∣finite Discernment to know People in all Disguises.'</Q>
<PB N="38" REF="43"/>
To which the Lady answered, <Q REND="inline">'You cannot con∣ceive any Thing more insipid and childish than a Masquerade to the People of Fashion, who in ge∣neral know one another as well here, as when they meet in an Assembly or a Drawing-room; nor will any Woman of Condition converse with a Person with whom she is not acquainted. In short, the Generality of Persons whom you see here, may more properly be said to kill Time in this Place, than in any other; and generally retire from hence more tired than from the longest Sermon. To say the Truth, I begin to be in that Situation myself, and if I have any Faculty at guessing, you are not much better pleased. I protest it would be almost Charity in me to go Home for your Sake.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I know but one Charity equal to it, cries <HI>Jones,</HI> and that is to suffer me to wait on you Home. Sure, an∣swered the Lady, you have a strange opinion of me, to imagine, that upon such an Acquaintance, I would let you into my Doors at this Time o'Night. I fancy you impute the Friendship I have shewn my Cousin, to some other Motive. Confess honestly; don't you consider this contrived Interview as little better than a downright Assignation? Are you used, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> to make these sudden Conquests? I am not used, Madam, said <HI>Jones,</HI> to submit to such sudden Conquests; but as you have taken my Heart by Surprize, the rest of my Body hath a Right to follow; so you must pardon me if I resolve to at∣tend you wherever you go.'</Q> He accompanied these Words with some proper Actions; upon which the Lady, after a gentle Rebuke, and saying their Fami∣liarity would be observed, told him, <Q REND="inline">'She was going to sup with an Acquaintance, whither she hoped he would not follow her; for if you should, said she, I shall be thought an unaccountable Creature, though my Friend indeed is not censorious, yet I
<PB N="39" REF="44"/>
hope you won't follow me: I protest I shall not know what to say, if you do.'</Q></P>
<P>The Lady presently after quitted the Masquerade, and <HI>Jones,</HI> notwithstanding the severe Prohibition he had received, presumed to attend her. He was now reduced to the same Dilemma we have mentioned be∣fore, namely, the want of Shilling, and could not relieve it by borrowing as before. He therefore walk∣ed boldly on after the Chair in which his Lady rode, pursued by a grand Huzza from all the Chairmen present, who wisely take the best Care they can to discountenance all walking afoot by their Betters. Luckily however the Gentry who attend at the Ope∣ra-House were too busy to quit their Stations, and as the Lateness of the Hour prevented him from meet∣ing many of their Brethren in the Street, he proceed∣ed without Molestation, in a Dress, which, at ano∣ther Season, would have certainly raised a Mob at his Heels.</P>
<P>The Lady was set down in a Street, not far from <HI>Hanover-Square,</HI> where the Door being presently opened, she was carried in, and the Gentleman, with∣out any Ceremony, walked in after her.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> and his Companion were now together in a very well-furnished and well-warm'd Room, when the Female still speaking in her Masquerade Voice, said, she was surprized at her Friend, who must ab∣solutely have forgot her Appointment; at which after venting much Resentment, she suddenly exprest some Apprehension from <HI>Jones,</HI> and asked him what the World would think of their having been alone toge∣ther in a House at that Time of Night? But instead of a direct Answer to so important a Question, <HI>Jones</HI> began to be very importunate with the Lady to un∣mask, and at length having prevailed, there appeared not Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> but the Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> herself.</P>
<P>It would be tedious to give the particular Conversa∣tion
<PB N="40" REF="45"/>
which consisted of very common and ordinary Oc∣currences, and which lasted from two till six o'Clock in the Morning. It is sufficient to mention all of it that is any wise material to this History. And this was a Promise that the Lady would endeavour to find out <HI>Sophia,</HI> and in a few Days bring him to an In∣terview with her, on Condition that he would then take his Leave of her. When this was thoroughly settled, and a second Meeting in the Evening ap∣pointed at the same Place, they separated; the Lady returned to her House, and <HI>Jones</HI> to his Lodgings.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Containing a Scene of Distress, which will appear very extraordinary to most of our Readers.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>JONES</HI> having refreshed himself with a few Hours Sleep, summoned <HI>Partridge</HI> to his Presence; and delivering him a Bank Note of fifty Pounds, ordered him to go and change it. <HI>Partridge</HI> received this with sparkling Eyes, though when he came to reflect farther, it raised in him some Suspicions not very ad∣vantageous to the Honour of his Master; to these the dreadful Idea he had of the Masquerade, the Disguise in which his Master had gone out and returned, and his having been abroad all Night, contributed. In plain Language, the only Way he could possibly find to account for the Possession of this Note, was by Robbery; and, to confess the Truth, the Reader, unless he should suspect it was owing to the Genero∣sity of Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> can hardly imagine any other.</P>
<P>To clear therefore the Honour of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> and to do Justice to the Liberality of the Lady, he had really received this Present from her, who, though she did not give much in to the Hackney Charities of the Age, such as building Hospitals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was not, how∣ever, entirely void of that Christian Virtue; and con∣ceived
<PB N="41" REF="46"/>
(very righty I think) that a young Fellow of Merit, without a Shilling in the World, was no im∣proper Object of this Virtue.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> and Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> had been invited to dine this Day with Mrs. <HI>Miller.</HI> At the appointed Hour therefore the two young Gentlemen, with the two Girls, attended in the Parlour, where they waited from three till almost five before the good Woman appeared. She had been out of Town to visit a Relation, of whom, at her Return, she gave the fol∣lowing Account,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I hope, Gentlemen, you will pardon my making you wait; I am sure if you knew the Occasion.—I have been to see a Cousin of mine, about six Miles off, who now lies in.—It should be a Warning to all Persons (says she, looking at her Daughters) how they marry indiscreetly. There is no Happiness in this World, without a Competency. O <HI>Nancy!</HI> how shall I describe the wretched Con∣dition in which I found your poor Cousin; she hath scarce lain in a Week, and there was she, this dreadful Weather, in a cold Room, without any Curtains to her Bed, and not a Bushel of Coals in her House to supply her with Fire: Her second Son, that sweet little Fellow, lies ill of a Quinzy in the same Bed with his Mother, for there is no other Bed in the House. Poor little <HI>Tommy!</HI> I believe, <HI>Nancy,</HI> you will never see your Favourite any more, for he is really very ill. The rest of the Children are in pretty good Health; but <HI>Molly,</HI> I am afraid, will do herself an Injury; she is but thirteen Years old, Mr. <HI>Nightingale,</HI> and yet, in my Life, I ne∣ver saw a better Nurse: She tends both her Mother and her Brother; and what is wonderful in a Crea∣ture so young, she shows all the Chearfulness in the World to her Mother; and yet I saw her.—I saw the poor Child, Mr <HI>Nightingale,</HI> turn about,
<PB N="42" REF="47"/>
and privately wipe the Tears from her Eyes.'</Q> Here Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> was prevented, by her own Tears, from going on, and there was not, I believe, a Person pre∣sent, who did not accompany her in them; at length she a little recovered herself, and proceeded thus, <Q REND="inline">'In all this Distress the Mother supports her Spirits in a surprising Manner. The Danger of her Son sits heaviest upon her, and yet she endeavours as much as possible to conceal even this Concern, on her Husband's Account. Her Grief, however, some∣times gets the better of all her Endeavours; for she was always extravagantly fond of this Boy, and a most sensible, sweet-tempered Creature it is. I pro∣test never was I more affected in my Life, than when I heard the little Wretch, who is hardly yet seven Years old, while his Mother was wetting him with her Tears, beg her to be comforted.—Indeed, Mamma, cry'd the Child, I shan't die, God Almighty, I'm sure, wont take <HI>Tommy</HI> away; let Heaven be ever so fine a Place, I had rather stay here and starve with you and my Papa, than go to it.—Pardon me, Gentlemen, I can't help it, (saus she, wiping her Eyes) such Sensibility and Af∣fection in a Child—And yet, perhaps, he is least the Object of Pity, for a Day or two will, most probably, place him beyond the Reach of all human Evils. The Father is indeed most worthy of Compassion. Poor Man, his Countenance is the very Picture of Horror, and he looks rather like one dead than alive. Oh Heavens! what a Scene did I behold at my first coming into the Room! The good Creature was lying behind the Bolster, supporting at once both his Child and his Wife. He had nothing on but a thin Waistcoat, for his Coat was spread over the Bed, to supply the Want of Blankets—When he rose up, at my Entrance, I scarce knew him. As comely a Man, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI>

within this Fortnight, as you ever beheld; Mr. <HI>Nightingle</HI> had seen him. His Eyes sunk, his Face pale, with a long Beard. His Body shivering with Cold, and worn with Hunger too; for my Cousin says, she can hardly prevail upon him to eat.—He told me himself in a Whisper—he told me—I can't repeat it—he said he could not bear to eat the Bread his Children wanted. And yet, can you believe it, Gentlemen? In all this Mi∣sery, his Wife has as good a Cawdle as if she lay in, in the midst of the greatest Affluence; I tasted it, and I scarce ever tasted better—The Means of procuring her this,' he said, he believed was sent him by an Angel from Heaven; I know not what he meant, for I had not Spirits enough to ask a single Question.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'This was a Love-Match, as they call it on both Sides; that is, a Match between two Beggars. I must indeed say I never saw a fonder Couple; but what is their Fondness good for, but to torment each other? Indeed Mamma, cries <HI>Nancy,</HI> I have always look∣ed on my Cousin <HI>Anderson</HI> (for that was her Name) as one of the happiest of Women.'</Q> I am sure' says Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'the Case at present is much otherwise; for any one might have discerned that the tender Consideration of each other's Sufferings, makes the most intolerable Part of their Calamity, both to the Husband and the Wife. Compared to which, Hunger and Cold, as they affect their own Persons only, are scarce Evils. Nay, the very Children, the youngest, which is not two Years old, excepted, feel in the same Manner; for they are a most loving Family; and if they had but a bare Competency, would be the happiest People in the World. I ne∣ver saw the least Sign of Misery at her House, re∣plied <HI>Nancy;</HI> I am sure my Heart bleeds for what

you now tell me.—O Child,' answered the Mother, 'she hath always endeavoured to make the best of every Thing. They have always been in great Distress; but, indeed, this absolute Ruin hath been brought upon them by others. The poor Man was Bail for the Villain his Brother; and a∣bout a Week ago, the very Day before her Lying∣in, their Goods were all carried away, and sold by an Execution. He sent a Letter to me of it by one of the Bailiffs, which the Villain never delivered.—What must he think of my suffering a Week to pass before he heard of me?'</Q></P>
<P>It was not with dry Eyes that <HI>Jones</HI> heard this Nar∣rative; when it was ended, he took Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> a∣part with him into another Room, and delivering her his Purse, in which was the Sum of 50 <HI>l.</HI> desired her to send as much of it as she thought proper to these poor People. The Look which Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> gave <HI>Jones,</HI> on this Occasion, is not easy to be described. She burst into a Kind of Agony of Transport, and cry'd out—<Q REND="inline">'Good Heavens! Is there such a Man in the World?'</Q>—But recollecting herself, she said, <Q REND="inline">'Indeed I know one such; but can there be another? I hope, Madam, cries <HI>Jones,</HI> there are many who have common Humanity: For to relieve such Distresses in our Fellow-Creatures, can hardly be called more.'</Q> Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> then took ten Guineas, which were the utmost he could prevail with her to accept, and said, <Q REND="inline">'she would find some Means of conveying them the next Morning;' adding, 'that she had herself done some little Matter for the poor People, and had not left them in quite so much Misery as she found them.'</Q></P>
<P>They then returned to the Parlour, where <HI>Night∣ingale</HI> express'd much Concern at the dreadful Situa∣tion of these Wretches, whom, indeed, he knew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for he had seen them more than once at Mrs. <HI>Mil∣</HI>ler's.
<PB N="45" REF="50"/>
He inveighed against the Folly of making one's self liable for the Debts of others; vented many bitter Execrations against the Brother; and concluded with wishing something could be done for the unfortunate Family. <Q REND="inline">'Suppose, Madam, said he, you should recommend them to Mr. <HI>Allworthy?</HI> Or what think you of a Collection? I will give them a Guinea with all my Heart.'</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> made no Answer; and <HI>Nancy,</HI> to whom her Mother had whispered the Generosity of <HI>Jones,</HI> turned pale upon the Occasion; though if ei∣ther of them was angry with <HI>Nightingale,</HI> it was surely without Reason. For the Liberality of <HI>Jones,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he had known it, was not an Example which he had any Obligation to follow; and there are Thou∣sands who would not have contributed a single Half∣penny, as indeed he did not in Effect, for he made no Tender of any Thing; and therefore as the others thought proper to make no Demand, he kept his Mo∣ney in his Pocket.</P>
<P>I have in Truth observed, and shall never have a better Opportunity than at present to communicate my Observation, that the World are in general divid∣ed into two Opinions concerning Charity, which are he very reverse of each other. One Party seems to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old, that all Acts of this Kind are to be esteemed as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oluntary Gifts, and however little you give (if in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed no more than your good Wishes) you acquire a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat Degree of Merit in so doing.—Others on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontrary, appear to be as firmly persuaded, that Be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eficence is a positive Duty, and that whenever the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich fall greatly short of their Ability in relieving the Distresses of the Poor, their pitiful Largesses are so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r from being meritorious, that they have only per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormed their Duty by Halves, and are in some Sense more contemptible than those who have entirely ne∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lected it.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="51"/>
To reconcile these different Opinions is not in my Power. I shall only add, that the Givers are generally of the former Sentiment, and the Receivers are almost universally inclined to the latter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>Which treats of Matters of a very different Kind from those in the preceding Chapter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Evening <HI>Jones</HI> met his Lady again, and a long Conversation again ensued between them; but as it consisted only of the same ordinary Occur∣rences as before, we shall avoid mentioning Particu∣lars, which we despair of rendring agreeable to the Reader; unless he is one whose Devotion to the Fair Sex, like that of the Papists to their Saints, wants to be raised by the Help of Pictures. But I am so far from desiring to exhibit such Pictures to the Public, that I would wish to draw a Curtain over those that have been lately set forth in certain <HI>French</HI> Novels; very bungling Copies of which have been presented us here, under the Name of Translations.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> grew still more and more impatient to see <HI>Sophia;</HI> and finding, after repeated Interviews with Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> no Likelihood of obtaining this by her Means; for, on the contrary, the Lady began to treat even the Mention of the Name of <HI>Sophia</HI> with Resentment; he resolved to try some other Method. He made no Doubt but that Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> knew where his Angel was, so he thought it most likely, that some of her Servants should be acquainted with the same Secret. <HI>Partridge</HI> therefore was employed to get acquainted with those Servants, in order to fish this Secret out of them.</P>
<P>Few Situations can be imagined more uneasy than that to which his poor Master was at present reduced; for besides the Difficulties he met with in discovering
<PB N="47" REF="52"/>
<HI>Sophia,</HI> besides the Fears he had of having disobliged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, and the Assurances he had received from the Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> of the Resolution which <HI>Sophia</HI> had taken a∣gainst him, and of her having purposely concealed herself from him, which he had sufficient Reason to believe might be true; he had still a Difficulty to com∣bat, which it was not in the Power of his Mistress to remove, however kind her Inclination might have been. This was the exposing of her to be disin∣herited of all her Father's Estate, the almost inevit∣able Consequence of their coming together without a Consent, which he had no Hopes of ever obtaining.</P>
<P>Add to all these the many Obligations which Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> whose violent Fondness we can no longer conceal, had heaped upon him; so that by her Means he was now become one of the best dress'd Men a∣bout Town; and was not only relieved from those ri∣diculous Distresses we have before mentioned, but was actually raised to a State of Affluence, beyond what he had ever known.</P>
<P>Now though there are many Gentlemen who very well reconcile it to their Consciences to possess them∣selves of the whole Fortune of a Woman, without making her any Kind of Return; yet to a Mind the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roprietor of which doth not deserve to be hang'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>othing is, I believe, more irksome than to support Love with Gratitude only; especially where Inclina∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion pulls the Heart a contrary Way. Such was the unhappy Case of <HI>Jones;</HI> for tho' the virtuous Love which he bore to <HI>Sophia,</HI> and which left very little Affection for any other Woman, had been entirely out of the Question, he could never have been able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave made an adequate Return to the generous Pas∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of this Lady, who had indeed been once an Ob∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect of Desire; but was now entered at least into the Autumn of Life; though she wore all the Gayety of Youth both in her Dress and Manner; nay, she con∣trived
<PB N="48" REF="53"/>
still to maintain the Roses in her Cheeks; but these, like Flowers forced out of Season by Art, had none of that lively blooming Freshness with which Na∣ture, at the proper Time, bedecks her own Produc∣tions. She had, besides, a certain Imperfection, which renders some Flowers, tho' very beautiful to the Eye, very improper to be placed in a Wilderness of Sweets, and what above all others is most disagreeable to the Breath of Love.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Jones</HI> saw all these Discouragements on the one Side, he felt his Obligations full as strongly on the other; nor did he less plainly discern the ardent Pas∣sion whence these Obligations proceeded, the extreme Violence of which if he failed to equal, he well knew the Lady would think him ungrateful; and, what is worse, he would have thought himself so. He knew the tacit Consideration upon which all her Favours were conferred; and as his Necessity obliged him to accept them, so his Honour, he concluded, forced him to pay the Price. This therefore he resolved to do, what∣ever Misery it cost him, and to devote himself to her, from that great Principle of Justice, by which the Laws of some Countries oblige a Debtor who is no otherwise capable of discharging his Debt to become the Slave of his Creditor.</P>
<P>While he was meditating on these Matters, he re∣ceived the following Note from the Lady.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'A very foolish, but a very perverse Accident hath happened since our last Meeting, which makes it improper I should see you any more at the usual Place. I will, if possible, contrive some other Place by To-morrow. In the mean Time, Adieu.'</Q></P>
<P>This Disappointment, perhaps, the Reader may conclude was not very great; but if it was, he was quickly relieved; for in less than an Hour afterwards another Note was brought him from the same Hand, which contained as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="54"/>
<Q REND="inline">'I have altered my Mind since I wrote, a Change, which if you are no Stranger to the tenderest of all Passions, you will not wonder at. I am now re∣solved to see you this Evening, at my own House, whatever may be the Consequence. Come to me exactly at seven; I dine abroad, but will be at Home by that Time. A Day, I find, to those that sincerely love seems longer than I imagined.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'If you should accidentally be a few Moments before me, bid them shew you into the Drawing-Room.'</Q></P>
<P>To confess the Truth, <HI>Jones</HI> was less pleased with this last Epistle than he had been with the former, as he was prevented by it from complying with the ear∣nest Entreaties of Mr. <HI>Nightingale,</HI> with whom he had now contracted much Intimacy and Friendship. These Entreaties were to go with that young Gentle∣man and his Company to a new Play, which was to be acted that Evening, and which a very large Party had agreed to damn, from some Dislike they had ta∣ken to the Author, who was a Friend to one of Mr. <HI>Nightingale'</HI>s Acquaintance. And this Sort of Funn, our Heroe, we are ashamed to confess, would willingly have preferred to the above kind Appointment; but his Honour got the better of his Inclination.</P>
<P>Before we attend him to this intended Interview with the Lady, we think proper to account for both the preceding Notes, as the Reader may possibly be not a little surprized at the Imprudence of Lady <HI>Bel∣laston</HI> in bringing her Lover to the very House where her Rival was lodged.</P>
<P>First then the Mistress of the House where these Lovers had hitherto met, and who had been for some Years a Pensioner to that Lady, was now become a Methodist, and had that very Morning waited upon her Ladyship, and after rebuking her severely for her past Life, had positively declared, that she would,
<PB N="50" REF="55"/>
on no Account, be instrumental in carrying on any of her Affairs for the future.</P>
<P>The Hurry of Spirits into which this Accident threw the Lady, made her despair of possibly finding any o∣ther Convenience to meet <HI>Jones</HI> that Evening; but as she began a little to recover from her Uneasiness at the Disappointment, she set her Thoughts to work, when luckily it came into her Head to propose to <HI>Sophia</HI> to go to the Play, which was immediately consented to, and a proper Lady provided for her Companion. Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> was likewise dispatched with Mrs. <HI>Etoff</HI> on the same Errand of Pleasure; and thus her own House was left free for the safe Reception of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> with whom she promised herself two or three Hours of uninterrupted Conversation, after her Return from the Place where she dined, which was at a Friend's House in a pretty distant Part of the Town, near her old Place of Assignation, where she had en∣gaged herself before she was well apprized of the Re∣volution that had happened in the Mind and Morals of her late Confidante.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>A Chapter which, though short, may draw Tears from some Eyes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Jones</HI> was just dress'd to wait on Lady <HI>Bel∣laston,</HI> when Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> rapp'd at his Door; and being admitted, very earnestly desired his Company below Stairs to drink Tea in the Parlour.</P>
<P>Upon his Entrance into the Room, she presently in∣troduced a Person to him, saying, <Q REND="inline">'This, Sir, is my Cousin, who hath been so greatly beholden to your Goodness, for which he begs to return you his sin∣cerest Thanks.'</Q></P>
<P>The Man had scarce entered upon that Speech, which Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> had so kindly prefaced, when both <HI>Jones</HI> and he looking stedfastly at each other, showed
<PB N="51" REF="56"/>
at once the utmost Tokens of Surprize. The Voice of the latter began instantly to faulter; and, instead of finishing his Speech, he sunk down into a Chair, cry∣ing, <Q REND="inline">'It is so, I am convinced it is so!'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Bless me, what's the Meaning of this, cries Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> you are not ill, I hope, Cousin? Some Water, a Dram this Instant.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Be not frighted, Madam, cries <HI>Jones,</HI> I have al∣most as much Need of a Dram as your Cousin. We are equally surprized at this unexpected Meet∣ing. Your Cousin is an Acquaintance of mine, Mrs. <HI>Miller.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'An Acquaintance! cries the Man,—Oh Heaven!'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Ay, an Acquaintance, repeated <HI>Jones,</HI> and an honoured Acquaintance too. When I do not love and honour the Man who dares venture every thing to preserve his Wife and Children from instant De∣struction, may I have a Friend capable of disowning me in Adversity.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'O you are an excellent young Man cries Mrs. <HI>Miller,—</HI>yes, indeed, poor Creature! he hath ventured every thing—if he had not had one of the best of Constitutions it must have killed him.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Cousin, cries the Man, who had now pretty well recovered himself; this is the Angel from Hea∣ven whom I meant. This is he to whom before I saw you, I owed the Preservation of my <HI>Peggy.</HI> He it was to whose Generosity every Comfort, every Support which I have procured for her was owing. He is indeed the worthiest, bravest, nob∣lest of all human Beings. O, Cousin, I have Obli∣gations to this Gentleman of such a Nature!'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Mention nothing of Obligations, cries <HI>Jones</HI> eagerly, not a Word I insist upon it, not a Word.'</Q> (Meaning, I suppose, that he would not have him betray the Affair of the Robbery to any Person)—
<PB N="52" REF="57"/>
<Q REND="inline">'If by the Trifle you have received from me, I have preserved a whole Family, sure Pleasure was never bought so cheap.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'O, Sir, cries the Man, I wish you could this In∣stant see my House. If any Person had ever a Right to the Pleasure you mention, I am convinced it is yourself. My Cousin tells me, she acquainted you with the Distress in which she found us. That, Sir, is all greatly removed, and chiefly by your Goodness.—My Children have now a Bed to lie on,—and they have—they have—eternal Blessings reward you for it,—they have Bread to eat. My little Boy is recovered; my Wife is out of Danger, and I am happy. All, all owing to you, Sir, and to my Cousin here, one of the best of Women. Indeed, Sir, I must see you at my House.—Indeed my Wife must see you, and thank you.—My Children too must express their Gratitude.—Indeed, Sir, they are not without a Sense of their Obligation; but what is my Feeling when I reflect to whom I owe, that they are now capable of expressing their Gratitude.—Oh, Sir! the little Hearts which you have warm∣ed had now been cold as Ice without your As∣sistance.—'</Q></P>
<P>Here <HI>Jones</HI> attempted to prevent the poor Man from proceeding; but indeed the Overflowing of his own Heart would of itself have stopped his Words. And now Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> likewise began to pour forth Thanksgivings, as well in her own Name, as in that of her Cousin, and concluded with saying, she doubted not but such Goodness would meet a glorious Reward.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> answered, <Q REND="inline">'He had been sufficiently reward∣ed already. Your Cousin's Account, Madam, said he, hath given me a Sensation more pleasing than I have ever known. He must be a Wretch who
<PB N="53" REF="58"/>
is unmoved at hearing such a Story; how transport∣ing then must be the Thought of having happily acted a Part in this Scene. If there are Men who cannot feel the Delight of giving Happiness to o∣thers, I sincerely pity them, as they are incapable of tasting what is in my Opinion, a greater Ho∣nour, a higher Interest, and a sweeter Pleasure, than the ambitious, the avaritious, or the voluptu∣ous Man can ever obtain.'</Q></P>
<P>The Hour of Appointment being now come, <HI>Jones</HI> was forced to take a hasty Leave, but not be∣fore he had heartily shaken his Friend by the Hand, and desired to see him again as soon as possible; pro∣mising, that he would himself take the first Opportu∣nity of visiting him at his own House. He then stept into his Chair, and proceeded to Lady <HI>Bellaston'</HI>s, greatly exulting in the Happiness which he had pro∣cured to this poor Family; nor could he forbear re∣flecting without Horror on the dreadful Consequences which must have attended them, had he listened ra∣ther to the Voice of strict Justice, than to that of Mercy when he was attacked on the high Road.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> sung forth the Praises of <HI>Jones</HI> during the whole Evening, in which Mr. <HI>Enderson,</HI> while he stayed, so passionately accompanied her, that he was often on the very Point of mentioning the Cir∣cumstances of the Robbery. However, he luckily recalled himself, and avoided an Indiscretion which would have been so much the greater, as he knew Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> to be extremely strict and nice in her Principles. He was likewise well apprised of the Lo∣quacity of this Lady; and yet such was his Gratitude, that it had almost got the better both of Discretion and Shame, and made him publish that which would have defamed his own Character, rather than omit any Circumstances which might do the fullest Honour to his Benefactor.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>In which the Reader will be surprized.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Jones</HI> was rather earlier than the Time ap∣pointed, and earlier than the Lady, whose Ar∣rival was hindered not only by the Distance of the Place where she dined, but by some other cross Ac∣cidents, very vexatious to one in her Situation of Mind. He was accordingly shewn into the Drawing-Room, where he had not been many Minutes before the Door opened, and in came—no other than <HI>So∣phia</HI> herself, who had left the Play before the End of the first Act; for this, as we have already said, being a new Play, at which two large Parties met, the one to damn, and the other to applaud, a violent Uproar, and an Engagement between the two Parties had so terrified our Heroine, that she was glad to put herself under the Protection of a young Gentleman, who safely conveyed her to her Chair.</P>
<P>As Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> had acquainted her that she should not be at Home till late, <HI>Sophia</HI> expecting to find no one in the Room, came hastily in, and went di∣rectly to a Glass which almost fronted her, without once looking towards the upper End of the Room, where the Statue of <HI>Jones</HI> now stood motionless.—In this Glass it was, after contemplating her own love∣ly Face, that she first discovered the said Statue; when instantly turning about, she perceived the Reality of the Vision: Upon which she gave a violent Scream, and scarce preserved herself from fainting, till <HI>Jones</HI> was able to move to her, and support her in his Arms.</P>
<P>To paint the Looks or Thoughts of either of these Lovers is beyond my Power. As their Sensations, from their mutual Silence, may be judged to have been too big for their Utterance, it cannot be sup∣posed,
<PB N="55" REF="60"/>
that I should be able to express them: And the Misfortune is, that few of my Readers have been enough in Love, to feel by their own Hearts what past at this Time in theirs.</P>
<P>After a short Pause, <HI>Jones,</HI> with faultering Ac∣cents, said,—<Q REND="inline">'I see, Madam, you are surprized.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Surprized! answered she; Oh Heavens! In∣deed, I am surprized. I almost doubt whether you are the Person you seem.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, cries he, my <HI>Sophia,</HI> pardon me, Madam, for this once call∣ing you so, I am that very wretched <HI>Jones,</HI> whom Fortune, after so many Disappointments, hath, at last, kindly conducted to you. Oh! my <HI>Sophia,</HI> did you know the thousand Torments I have suffer∣ed in this long, fruitless Pursuit'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Pursuit of whom?'</Q> said <HI>Sophia,</HI> a little recollecting herself, and assuming a reserved Air.—<Q REND="inline">'Can you be so cruel to ask that Question?' cries <HI>Jones.</HI> 'Need I say of you?</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Of me?' answered <HI>Sophia:</HI> 'Hath Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> then any such important Business with me?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'To some, Madam, cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'this might seem an important Business, (giving her the Poc∣ket-Book).' I hope, Madam, you will find it of the same Value, as when it was lost.'</Q> <HI>Sophia</HI> took the Pocket-Book, and was going to speak, when he interrupted her, thus;—<Q REND="inline">'Let us not, I beseech you, lose one of these precious Moments which For∣tune hath so kindly sent us.—O my <HI>Sophia,</HI> I have Business of a much superior Kind.—Thus, on my Knees, let me ask your Pardon.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'My Pardon?' cries she;—'Sure, Sir, after what is past you cannot expect, after what I have heard'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'I scarce know what I say, answered <HI>Jones.</HI> 'By Heavens! I scarce wish you should pardon me. O my <HI>Sophia,</HI> henceforth never cast away a Thought on such a Wretch as I am. If any Remembrance of me should ever intrude to give a Moment's Un∣easiness
<PB N="56" REF="61"/>
to that tender Bosom, think of my Unwor∣thiness; and let the Remembrance of what past at <HI>Upton</HI> blot me for ever from your Mind'</Q>—</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> stood trembling all this while. Her Face was whiter than Snow, and her Heart was throbbing through her Stays. But at the mention of <HI>Upton,</HI> a Blush arose in her Cheeks, and her Eyes, which be∣fore she had scarce lifted up, were turned upon <HI>Jones</HI> with a Glance of Disdain. He understood this silent Reproach, and replied to it thus: <Q REND="inline">'O my <HI>Sophia,</HI> my only Love, you cannot hate or despise me more for what happened there, than I do myself: But yet do me the Justice to think, that my <HI>Heart</HI> was never unfaithful to you. <HI>That</HI> had no Share in the Folly I was guilty of; it was even then unalterably yours. Though I despaired of possessing you, nay, almost of ever seeing you more, I doated still on your charming Idea, and could <HI>seriously</HI> love no other Woman. But if my Heart had not been en∣gaged, she, into whose Company I accidentally fell at that cursed Place, was not an Object of serious Love. Believe me, my Angel, I never have seen her from that Day to this; and never intend, or desired to see her again.'</Q> <HI>Sophia,</HI> in her Heart, was very glad to hear this; but forcing into her Face an Air of more Coldness than she yet had assumed; Why, said she, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> do you take the <Q REND="inline">'Trou∣ble to make a Defence, where you are not accused? If I thought it worth while to accuse you, I have a Charge of an unpardonable Nature indeed.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'What is it, for Heaven's Sake?'</Q> answered <HI>Jones,</HI> trembling and pale, expecting to hear of his Amour with Lady <HI>Bellaston.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'Oh, said she, how is it possible! Can every Thing noble, and every Thing base, be lodged together in the same Bosom?'</Q> La∣dy <HI>Bellaston,</HI> and the ignominious Circumstance of having been <HI>kept,</HI> rose again in his Mind, and stopt
<PB N="57" REF="62"/>
his Mouth from any Reply. <Q REND="inline">'Could I have expected, proceeded <HI>Sophia,</HI> such Treatment from you? Nay, from any Gentleman, from any Man of Honour? To have my Name traduced in Public; in Inns, among the meanest Vulgar! To have any little Fa∣vours, that my unguarded Heart may have too lightly betray'd me to grant, boasted of there! Nay, even to hear that you had been forced to fly from my Love!'</Q> Nothing could equal <HI>Jones'</HI>s Sur∣prize at these Words of <HI>Sophia;</HI> but yet, not being guilty, he was much less embarrassed how to defend himself, than if she had touched that tender String, at which his Conscience had been alarmed. By some Examination he presently found, that her supposing him guilty of so shocking an Outrage against his Love, and her Reputation, was entirely owing to <HI>Par∣tridge'</HI>s Talk at the Inns, before Landlords and Ser∣vants; for <HI>Sophia</HI> confessed to him, it was from them that she received her Intelligence. He had no very great Difficulty to make her believe that he was entire∣ly innocent of an Offence so foreign to his Character; but she had a great deal to hinder him from going in∣stantly home, and putting <HI>Partridge</HI> to Death, which he more than once swore he would do. This Point being cleared up, they soon found themselves so well pleased with each other, that <HI>Jones</HI> quite forgot he had begun the Conversation with conjuring her to give up all Thoughts of him; and she was in a Temper to have given Ear to a Petition of a very different Na∣ture: For before they were aware, they had both gone so far, that he let fall some Words that sounded like a Proposal of Marriage. To which she replied, <Q REND="inline">'That, did not her Duty to her Father forbid her to follow her own Inclinations, Ruin with him would be more welcome to her, than the most affluent Fortune with another Man.'</Q> At the men∣tion of the Word Ruin he started, let drop her Hand,
<PB N="58" REF="63"/>
which he had held for some Time, and striking his Breast with his own, cried out, <Q REND="inline">'Oh, <HI>Sophia,</HI> can I then ruin thee? No; by Heavens, no! I never will act so base a Part. Dearest <HI>Sophia,</HI> whatever it costs me, I will renounce you; I will give you up: I will tear all such Hopes from my Heart, as are inconsistent with your real Good. My Love I will ever retain, but it shall be in Silence; it shall be at a Distance from you; it shall be in some fo∣reign Land; from whence no Voice, no Sigh of my Despair, shall ever reach and disturb your Ears. And when I am dead'</Q>—He would have gone on, but was stopt by a Flood of Tears which <HI>Sophia</HI> let fall in his Bosom, upon which she leaned, without being able to speak one Word. He kissed them off, which, for some Moments, she allowed him to do without any Resistance; but then recollecting herself, gently withdrew out of his Arms; and, to turn the Discourse from a Subject too tender, and which she found she could not support, bethought herself to ask him a Question she had never had Time to put to him before, <Q REND="inline">'How he came into that Room?'</Q> He begun to stammer, and would, in all Probability, have raised her Suspicions by the Answer he was go∣ing to give, when, at once, the Door opened, and in came Lady <HI>Bellaston.</HI></P>
<P>Having advanced a few Steps, and seeing <HI>Jones</HI> and <HI>Sophia</HI> together, she suddenly stopt; when after a Pause of a few Moments, recollecting herself with ad∣mirable Presence of Mind, she said,—tho' with suf∣ficient Indications of Surprize both in Voice and Countenance—<Q REND="inline">'I thought, Miss <HI>Western,</HI> you had been at the Play?'</Q></P>
<P>Though <HI>Sophia</HI> had had no Opportunity of learn∣ing of <HI>Jones,</HI> by what Means he had discovered her, yet as she had not the least Suspicion of the real Truth, or that <HI>Jones</HI> and Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> were ac∣quainted;
<PB N="59" REF="64"/>
so she was very little confounded: And the less, as the Lady had, in all their Conversations on the Subject, entirely taken her Side against her Father. With very little Hesitation, therefore, she went through the whole Story of what had happened at the Playhouse, and the Cause of her hasty Return.</P>
<P>The Length of this Narrative gave Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> an Opportunity of rallying her Spirits, and of consi∣dering in what Manner to act. And as the Behavi∣our of <HI>Sophia</HI> gave her Hopes that <HI>Jones</HI> had not be∣tray'd her, she put on an Air of Good-Humour, and said, <Q REND="inline">'I should not have broke in so abruptly upon you, Miss <HI>Western,</HI> if I had known you had Com∣pany.'</Q></P>
<P>Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> fixed her Eyes on <HI>Sophia</HI> whilst she spoke these Words. To which that poor young La∣dy, having her Face overspread with Blushes and Con∣fusion, answered, in a stammering Voice, <Q REND="inline">'I am sure, Madam, I shall always think the Honour of your Ladyship's Company.</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'I hope, at least,' cries Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> 'I interrupt no Business.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'No, Madam, answered <HI>Sophia,</HI> our Business was at an End. Your Ladyship may be pleased to re∣member, I have often mentioned the Loss of my Pocket-Book, which this Gentleman having very luckily found, was so kind to return to me with the Bill in it.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones,</HI> ever since the Arrival of Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> had been ready to sink with Fear. He sat kicking his Heels, playing with his Fingers, and looking more like a Fool, if it be possible, than a young boody Squire, when he is first introduced into a polite As∣sembly. He began, however, now to recover him∣self; and taking a Hint from the Behaviour of Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> who, he saw, did not intend to claim any Acquaintance with him, he resolved as entirely to affect the Stranger on his Part. He said, <Q REND="inline">'Ever since
<PB N="60" REF="65"/>
he had had the Pocket-Book in his Possession, he had used great Diligence in enquiring out the Lady whose Name was writ in it; but never till that Day could be so fortunate to discover her.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> had, indeed, mentioned the Loss of her Pocket-Book to Lady <HI>Bellaston;</HI> but as <HI>Jones,</HI> for some Reason or other, had never once hinted to her that it was in his Possession, she believed not one Syl∣lable of what <HI>Sophia</HI> now said, and wonderfully ad∣mired the extreme Quickness of the young Lady, in inventing such an Excuse. The Reason of <HI>Sophia'</HI>s leaving the Play-house met with no better Credit; and though she could not account for the Meeting between these two Lovers, she was firmly perswaded it was not accidental.</P>
<P>With an affected Smile, therefore, she said—<Q REND="inline">'In∣deed, Miss <HI>Western,</HI> you have had very good Luck in recovering your Money. Not only as it fell in∣to the Hands of a Gentleman of Honour, but as he happened to discover to whom it belonged. I think you would not consent to have it advertised.—It was great good Fortune, Sir, that you found out to whom the Note belonged.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'O Madam, cries <HI>Jones,</HI> it was inclosed in a Pocket-Book, in which the young Lady's Name was written.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'That was very fortunate indeed, cries the Lady;—And it was no less so, that you heard Miss <HI>Western</HI> was at my House; for she is very little known.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> had at length perfectly recovered his Spirits; and as he conceived he had now an Opportunity of satisfying <HI>Sophia,</HI> as to the Question she had asked him just before Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> came in, he proceed∣ed thus: Why, Madam, answered he, <Q REND="inline">'it was by the luckiest Chance imaginable I made this Disco∣very. I was mentioning what I had found, and
<PB N="61" REF="66"/>
the Name of the Owner, the other Night, to a Lady at the Masquerade, who told me, she believ∣ed she knew where I might see Miss <HI>Western;</HI> and if I would come to her House the next Morning, she would inform me. I went according to her Appointment, but she was not at Home; nor could I ever meet with her till this Morning, when she directed me to your Ladyship's House. I came ac∣cordingly, and did myself the Honour to ask for your Ladyship; and upon my saying that I had very particular Business, a Servant shewed me into this Room; where I had not been long before the young Lady returned from the Play.'</Q></P>
<P>Upon his mentioning the Masquerade, he look'd very slyly at Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> without any Fear of be∣ing remarked by <HI>Sophia;</HI> for she was visibly too much confounded to make any Observations. This Hint a little alarmed the Lady, and she was silent; when <HI>Jones,</HI> who saw the Agitations of <HI>Sophia'</HI>s Mind, re∣solved to take the only Method of relieving her, which was by retiring: But before he did this, he said, <Q REND="inline">'I believe, Madam, it is customary to give some Re∣ward on these Occasions;—I must insist on a very high one for my Honesty;—It is, Madam, no less than the Honour of being permitted to pay ano∣ther Visit here.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Sir, replied the Lady, I make no Doubt that you are a Gentleman, and my Doors are never shut to People of Fashion.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> then, after proper Ceremonials, departed, highly to his own Satisfaction, and no less to that of <HI>Sophia;</HI> who was terribly alarmed lest Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> should discover what she knew already but too well.</P>
<P>Upon the Stairs <HI>Jones</HI> met his old Acquaintance Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> who, notwithstanding all she had said against him, was now so well-bred to behave with great Civility. This Meeting proved indeed a lucky
<PB N="62" REF="67"/>
Circumstance, as he communicated to her the House where he lodged, with which <HI>Sophia</HI> was unac∣quainted.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. <HI>In which the Thirteenth Book is concluded.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE elegant Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> somewhere objects to telling too much Truth: By which it may be fairly inferred, that, in some Cases, to lie, is not only excusable but commendable.</P>
<P>And surely there are no Persons who may so pro∣perly challenge a Right to this commendable Deviation from Truth, as young Women in the Affair of Love; for which they may plead Precept, Education, and above all, the Sanction, nay, I may say, the Neces∣sity of Custom, by which they are restrained, not from submitting to the honest Impulses of Nature (for that would be a foolish Prohibition) but from owning them.</P>
<P>We are not, therefore, ashamed to say, that our Heroine now pursued the Dictates of the abovemen∣tioned Right Honourable Philosopher. As she was perfectly satisfied then, that Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> was igno∣rant of the Person of <HI>Jones,</HI> so she determined to keep her in that Ignorance, though at the Expence of a little Fibbing.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> had not been long gone, before Lady <HI>Bel∣laston</HI> cry'd, <Q REND="inline">'Upon my Word, a good pretty young Fellow; I wonder who he is: For I don't remem∣ber ever to have seen his Face before.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Nor I neither, Madam, cries <HI>Sophia.</HI> I must say he behaved very handsomely in relation to my Note.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Yes; and he is a very handsome Fellow, said the Lady; don't you think so?'</Q></P>
<P>I did not take much Notice of him, answered
<PB N="63" REF="68"/>
<HI>Sophia;</HI> <Q REND="inline">'but I thought he seemed rather awkward and ungenteel than otherwise.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'You are extremely right, cries Lady <HI>Bellaston:</HI> You may see, by his Manner, that he hath not kept good Company. Nay, notwithstanding his re∣turning your Note, and refusing the Reward, I al∣most question whether he is a Gentleman.—I have always observed there is a Something in Per∣sons well-born, which others can never acquire.—I think I will give Orders not to be at Home to him.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Nay sure, Madam, answered <HI>Sophia,</HI> one can't suspect after what he hath done:—Besides, if your Ladyship observed him, there was an Elegance in his Discourse, a Delicacy, a Prettiness of Ex∣pression that, that—'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I confess, said Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> the Fellow hath Words—And indeed, <HI>Sophia,</HI> you must forgive me, indeed you must.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I forgive your Ladyship! said <HI>Sophia.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Yes indeed you must, answered she 'laughing; for I had a horrible Suspicion when I first came in∣to the Room—I vow you must forgive it; but I suspected it was Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> himself.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Did your Ladyship indeed? cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> blush∣ing, and affecting a Laugh.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Yes, I vow I did, answered she, I can't ima∣gine what put it into my Head: For, give the Fel∣low his due, he was genteelly drest; which, I think, dear <HI>Sophy,</HI> is not commonly the Case with your Friend.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'This Raillery, cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> is a little cruel, Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> after my Promise to your Lady∣ship.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Not at all, Child,' said the Lady;—It would have been cruel before; but after you have pro∣mised me never to marry without your Father's
<PB N="64" REF="69"/>
Consent, in which you know is implied your giv∣ing up <HI>Jones,</HI> sure you can bear a little Raillery on a Passion which was pardonable enough in a young Girl in the Country, and of which you tell me you have so entirely got the better. What must I think, my dear <HI>Sophy</HI> if you cannot bear a little Ridicule even on his Dress? I shall begin to fear you are very far gone indeed; and almost question whether you have dealt ingenuously with me.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Madam, cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> your Ladyship mistakes me, if you imagine I had any Concern on his Account.'</Q></P>
<P>'On his Account?' answered the Lady: <Q REND="inline">'You must have mistaken me; I went no farther than his Dress;—for I would not injure your Taste by any other Comparison—I don't imagine, my dear <HI>Sophy,</HI> if your Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> had been such a Fellow as this—'</Q></P>
<P>'I thought,' says <HI>Sophia,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'your Ladyship had al∣lowed him to be handsome.—'</Q></P>
<P>'Whom, pray?' cried the Lady, hastily.</P>
<P>'Mr. <HI>Jones,'</HI> answered <HI>Sophia;—</HI>and immediately recollecting herself, <Q REND="inline">'Mr. <HI>Jones!—</HI>no, no; I ask your Pardon;—I mean the Gentleman who was just now here.'</Q></P>
<P>'O <HI>Sophy! Sophy!'</HI> cries the Lady; <Q REND="inline">'this Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> I am afraid, still runs in your Head.'</Q></P>
<P>'Then upon my Honour, Madam,' said <HI>Sophia,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> is as entirely indifferent to me, as the Gentleman who just now left us.'</Q></P>
<P>'Upon my Honour,' said Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'I be∣lieve it. Forgive me, therefore, a little innocent Raillery; but I promise you I will never mention his Name any more.'</Q></P>
<P>And now the two Ladies separated, infinitely more to the Delight of <HI>Sophia,</HI> than of Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> who would willingly have tormented her Rival a little lon∣ger, had not Business of more Importance called her
<PB N="65" REF="70"/>
away. As for <HI>Sophia,</HI> her Mind was not perfectly easy under this first Practice of Deceit; upon which, when she retired to her Chamber, she reflected with the highest Uneasiness and conscious Shame. Nor could the peculiar Hardship of her Situation, and the Necessity of the Case, at all reconcile her Conduct to her Mind; the Frame of which was too delicate to bear the Thought of having been guilty of a Falshood, however qualified by Circumstances. Nor did this Thought once suffer her to close her Eyes during the whole succeeding Night.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING.</HEAD>
<HEAD>BOOK XIV. <HI>Containing Two Days.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>An Essay to prove that an Author will write the bet∣ter, for having some Knowledge of the Subject on which he writes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS several Gentlemen in these Times, by the wonderful Force of Genius only, without the least Assistance of Learning, perhaps, without being well able to read, have made a con∣siderable Figure in the Republic of Letters; the mo∣dern Critics, I am told, have lately begun to assert, that all kind of Learning is entirely useless to a Wri∣ter; and, indeed, no other than a kind of Fetters on the natural Spriteliness and Activity on the Imagina∣tions, which is thus weighed down, and prevented
<PB N="67" REF="72"/>
from soaring to those high Flights which otherwise it would be able to reach.</P>
<P>This Doctrine, I am afraid, is, at present, carried much too far: For why should Writing differ so much from all other Arts? The Nimbleness of a Dancing-Master is not at all prejudiced by being taught to move; nor doth any Mechanic, I believe, exer∣cise his Tools the worse by knowing how to use them. For my own Part, I cannot conceive that <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil</HI> would have writ with more Fire, if, instead of being Masters of all the Learning of their Times, they had really been as ignorant as most of the Au∣thors of the present Age. Nor do I believe that all the Imagination, Fire, and Judgment of <HI>Pitt</HI> could have produced those Orations that have made the Se∣nate of <HI>England</HI> in these our Times a Rival in Elo∣quence to <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> if he had not been so well read in the Writings of <HI>Demosthenes</HI> and <HI>Ci∣cero,</HI> as to have transfused their whole Spirit into his Speeches, and with their Spirit, their Knowledge too.</P>
<P>I would not here be understood to insist on the same Fund of Learning in any of my Brethren, as <HI>Cicero</HI> perswades us is necessary to the Composition of an Orator. On the contrary, very little Reading is, I conceive, necessary to the Poet, less to the Cri∣tic, and the least of all to the Politician. For the first, perhaps, <HI>Bysse'</HI>s Art of Poetry, and a few of our mo∣dern Poets, may suffice; for the second, a moderate Heap of Plays; and for the last, an indifferent Col∣lection of political Journals.</P>
<P>To say the Truth, I require no more than that a Man should have some little Knowledge of the Sub∣ject on which he treats, according to the old Maxim of Law, <HI>Quam quisque norit artem in eâ se exer∣ceat.</HI> With this alone a Writer may sometimes do tolerably well; and indeed without this, all the other Learning in the World will stand him in little stead.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="73"/>
For Instance, let us suppose that <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil, Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Cicero, Thucydides</HI> and <HI>Livy</HI> could have met all together, and have clubbed their several Ta∣lents to have composed a Treatise on the Art of Danc∣ing; I believe it will be readily agreed they could not have equalled the excellent Treatise which Mr. <HI>Essex</HI> hath given us on that Subject, entitled, <HI>The Rudi∣ments of genteel Education.</HI> And, indeed, should the excellent Mr. <HI>Broughton</HI> be prevailed on to set <HI>Fist</HI> to Paper, and to complete the abovesaid Rudiments, by delivering down the true Principles of Athletics, I question whether the World will have any Cause to lament, that none of the great Writers, either an∣cient or modern, have ever treated about that noble and useful Art.</P>
<P>To avoid a Multiplicity of Examples in so plain a Case, and to come at once to my Point, I am apt to conceive, that one Reason why many <HI>English</HI> Wri∣ters have totally failed in describing the Manners of upper Life, may possibly be, that in Reality they know nothing of it.</P>
<P>This is a Knowledge unhappily not in the Power of many Authors to arrive at. Books will give us a very imperfect Idea of it; nor will the Stage a much better: The fine Gentleman formed upon reading the former will almost always turn out a Pedant, and he who forms himself upon the latter, a Coxcomb.</P>
<P>Nor are the Characters drawn from these Models better supported. <HI>Vanbrugh</HI> and <HI>Congreve</HI> copied Na∣ture; but they who copy them draw as unlike the present Age, as <HI>Hogarth</HI> would do if he was to paint a Rout or a Drum in the Dresses of <HI>Titian</HI> and of <HI>Vandyke.</HI> In short, Imitation here will not do the Business. The Picture must be after Nature herself. A true Knowledge of the World is gained only by Conversation, and the Manners of every Rank must be seen in order to be known.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="74"/>
Now it happens that this higher Order of Mortals is not to be seen, like all the rest of the Human Spe∣cies, for nothing, in the Streets, Shops, and Coffee-houses: Nor are they shewn, like the upper Rank of Animals, for so much apiece. In short, this is a Sight to which no Persons are admitted, without one or o∣ther of these Qualifications, <HI>viz.</HI> either Birth or For∣tune; or what is equivalent to both, the honourable Profession of a Gamester. And very unluckily for the World, Persons so qualified, very seldom care to take upon themselves the bad Trade of Writing; which is generally entered upon by the lower and poorer Sort, as it is a Trade which many think re∣quires no Kind of Stock to set up with.</P>
<P>Hence those strange Monsters in Lace and Em∣broidery, in Silks and Brocades, with vast Wigs and Hoops; which, under the Name of Lords and Ladies, strut the Stage, to the great Delight of Attornies and their Clerks in the Pit, and of Citizens and their Ap∣prentices in the Galleries; and which are no more to be found in real Life, than the Centaur, the Chimera, or any other Creature of mere Fiction. But to let my Reader into a Secret, this Knowledge of upper Life, though very necessary for the preventing Mis∣takes, is no very great Resource to a Writer whose Province is Comedy, or that Kind of Novels, which like this I am writing, is of the comic Class.</P>
<P>What Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> says of Women is very applicable to most in this Station, who are indeed so entirely made up of Form and Affection, that they have no Character at all, at least, none which appears. I will venture to say the highest Life is much the dullest, and affords very little Humour or Entertainment. The various Callings in lower Spheres produce the great Variety of humorous Characters; whereas here, ex∣cept among the few who are engaged in the Pursuit of Ambition, and the fewer still who have a Relish for
<PB N="80" REF="75"/>
Pleasure, all is Vanity and servile Imitation. Dressing and Cards, eating and drinking, bowing and curtesying, make up the Business of their Lives.</P>
<P>Some there are however of this Rank, upon whom Passion exercises its Tyranny, and hurries them far beyond the Bounds which Decorum pre∣scribes; of these, the Ladies are as much distinguished by their noble Intrepidity, and a certain superior Con∣tempt of Reputation, from the frail ones of meaner Degree, as a virtuous Woman of Quality is by the Elegance and Delicacy of her Sentiments from the ho∣nest Wife of a Yeoman or Shopkeeper. Lady <HI>Bel∣laston</HI> was of this intrepid Character; but let not my Country Readers conclude from her, that this is the general Conduct of Women of Fashion, or that we mean to represent them as such. They might as well suppose, that every Clergyman was represented by <HI>Thwackum,</HI> or every Soldier by Ensign <HI>Northerton.</HI></P>
<P>There is not indeed a greater Error than that which universally prevails among the Vulgar, who borrow∣ing their Opinion from some ignorant Satyrists, have affixed the Character of Lewdness to these Times. On the contrary, I am convinced there never was less of Love Intrigue carried on among Persons of Condi∣tion, than now. Our present Women have been taught by their Mothers to fix their Thoughts only on Ambition and Vanity, and to despise the Pleasures of Love as unworthy their Regard; and being afterwards, by the Care of such Mothers, married without having Husbands, they seem pretty well confirmed in the Just∣ness of those Sentiments; whence they content them∣selves for the dull Remainder of Life, with the Pur∣suit of more innocent, but I am afraid more childish Amusements, the bare Mention of which would ill suit with the Dignity of this History. In my humble Opinion, the true Characteristick of the present <HI>Beau</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="76"/>
<HI>Monde,</HI> is rather Folly than Vice, and the only Epithet which it deserves is that of <HI>Frivolous.</HI></P>

<LETTER>
<P>I was never more surprized than when I found you was gone. When you left the Room, I little imagined you intended to have left the House with∣out seeing me again. Your Behaviour is all of a Piece, and convinces me how much I ought to de∣spise a Heart which can doat upon an Idiot; though I know not whether I should not admire her Cun∣ning more than her Simplicity: Wonderful both! For though she understood not a Word of what passed between us, she yet had the Skill, the Assu∣rance, the—what shall I call it? to deny to my Face, that she knows you, or ever saw you before.—Was this a Scheme laid between you, and have you been base enough to betray me?—O how I despise her, you, and all the World, but chiefly myself, for—I dare not write what I should afterwards run mad to read; but remember, I can detest as violently as I have loved.</P>

<P>Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> now came from behind the Curtain. How shall I describe her Rage? Her Tongue was at first incapable of Utterance; but streams of Fire dart∣ed from her Eyes, and well indeed they might, for her Heart was all in a Flame. And now as soon as her Voice found Way, instead of expressing any In∣dignation against <HI>Honour,</HI> or her own Servants, she began to attack poor <HI>Jones.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'You see, said she, what I have sacrificed to you, my Reputation, my Honour,—gone for ever!

And can your Ladyship, cries he, ask of me what I must part with my Honour before I grant? Have I acted in such a Manner by your Ladyship? Could I be guilty of betraying this poor innocent Girl to you, what Security could you have,
<PB N="76" REF="81"/>
that I should not act the same Part by yourself? A Moment's Reflection will, I am sure, convince you, that a Man with whom the Secrets of a Lady are not safe, must be the most contemptible of Wretches. Very well, said she—I need not insist on your becoming this contemptible Wretch in your own Opinion; for the Inside of the Letter could inform me of nothing more than I know already. I see the Footing you are upon.'</Q>—Here ensued a long Conversation, which the Reader, who is not too cu∣rious, will thank me for not inserting at length. It shall suffice therefore to inform him, that Lady <HI>Bel∣laston</HI> grew more and more pacified, and at length believed, or affected to believe, his Protestations, that his meeting with <HI>Sophia</HI> that Evening was merely ac∣cidental, and every other Matter which the Reader already knows, and which as <HI>Jones</HI> set before her in the strongest Light, it is plain that she had in Reali∣ty no Reason to be angry with him.</P>
<P>She was not however in her Heart perfectly satisfi∣ed with his Refusal to shew her the Letter, so dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are we to the clearest Reason, when it argues against our prevailing Passions. She was indeed well con∣vinced that <HI>Sophia</HI> possessed the first Place in <HI>Jones<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Affections; and yet, haughty and amorous as this La∣dy was, she submitted at last to bear the second Place or to express it more properly in a legal Phrase; wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> contented with the Possession of that of which ano∣ther Woman had the Reversion.</P>
<P>It was at length agreed, that <HI>Jones</HI> should for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> future visit at the House: for that <HI>Sophia,</HI> her Mai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and all the Servants would place these Visits to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Account of <HI>Sophia;</HI> and that she herself would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> considered as the Person imposed upon.</P>
<P>This Scheme was contrived by the Lady, and high¦ly relished by <HI>Jones,</HI> who was indeed glad to have Prospect of seeing his <HI>Sophia</HI> at any Rate; and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="77" REF="82"/>
Lady herself was not a little pleased with the Impo∣sition on <HI>Sophia,</HI> which <HI>Jones,</HI> she thought, could not possibly discover to her for his own Sake.</P>

<P><HI>JONES</HI> was no sooner alone, than he eagerly broke open his Letter, and read as follows,</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Sir, it is impossible to express what I have suf∣fered since you left this House; and as I have Rea∣son to think you intend coming here again, I have sent <HI>Honour,</HI> though so late at Night, as she tells me she knows your Lodgings, to prevent you. I charge you, by all the Regard you have for me, not to think of visiting here; for it will certainly be discovered; nay, I almost doubt from some Things which have dropt from her Ladyship, that she is not already without some Suspicion. Something fa∣vourable perhaps may happen; we must wait with Patience; but I once more entreat you, if you have any Concern for my Ease, do not think of return∣ing hither.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This Letter administred the same Kind of Conso∣lation to poor <HI>Jones,</HI> which <HI>Job</HI> formerly received from his Friends. Besides disappointing all the Hopes which he promised to himself from seeing <HI>Sophia,</HI> he was reduced to an unhappy Dilemma, with Regard to Lady <HI>Bellaston;</HI> for there are some certain En∣gagements, which, as he well knew, do very diffi∣cultly admit of any Excuse for the Failure; and to go, after the strict Prohibition from <HI>Sophia,</HI> he was not to be forced by any human Power. At length, after much Deliberation, which during that Night sup∣ply'd
<PB N="78" REF="83"/>
the Place of Sleep, he determined to feign him∣self sick: For this suggested itself as the only means of failing the appointed Visit, without incensing Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> which he had more than one Reason of de∣siring to avoid.</P>
<P>The first Thing however which he did in the Morn∣ing was to write an Answer to <HI>Sophia,</HI> which he en∣closed in one to <HI>Honour.</HI> He then dispatched another to Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> containing the abovementioned Excuse; and to this he soon received the following Answer.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I am vexed that I cannot see you here this Af∣ternoon, but more concerned for the Occasion; take great Care of yourself, and have the best Advice, and I hope there will be no Danger.—I am so tormented all this Morning with Fools, that I have scace a Moment's Time to write to you. Adieu.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> now received a Visit from Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> who, after some formal Introduction, began the fol∣lowing Speech. <Q REND="inline">'I am very sorry, Sir, to wait up∣on you on such an Occasion; but I hope you will consider the ill Consequence which it must be to the Reputations of my poor Girls, if my House should once be talked of as a House of ill Fame. I hope you won't think me therefore guilty of Impertinence if I beg you not to bring any more Ladies in at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Time of Night. The Clock had struck two before one of them went away.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I do assure you, Ma∣dam, said <HI>Jones,</HI> the Lady who was here last Night and who staid the latest (for the other only brought me a Letter) is a Woman of very great Fashion and my near Relation. I don't know what Fashion she is of, answered Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> but I am sure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Woman of Virtue, unless a very near Relation in¦deed, would visit a young Gentleman at ten
<PB N="79" REF="84"/>
Night, and stay four Hours in his Room with him alone; besides, Sir, the Behaviour of her Chairmen shews what she was; for they did nothing but make Jests all the Evening in the Entry, and asked Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> in the hearing of my own Maid, if Ma∣dam intended to stay with his Master all Night; with a great deal of Stuff not proper to be repeated. I have really a great Respect for you, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> upon your own Account, nay I have a very high Obligation to you for your Generosity to my Cou∣sin. Indeed I did not know how very good you had been till lately. Little did I imagine to what dread∣ful Courses the poor Man's Distress had driven him. Little did I think when you gave me the ten Guineas, that you had given them to a Highwayman! O Heavens! What Goodness have you shewn? How have you preserved this Family.—The Cha∣racter which Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> hath formerly given me of you, was, I find, strictly true.—And indeed if I had no Obligation to you, my Obligations to him are such, that, on his Account, I should shew you the utmost Respect in my Power.—Nay, believe me, dear Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> if my Daughters and my own Reputation were out of the Case, I should, for your own Sake, be sorry that so pretty a young Gentleman should converse with these Women; but if you are resolved to do it, I must beg you to take another Lodging; for I do not myself like to have such Things carried on under my Roof; but more especially upon the Account of my Girls, who have little, Heaven knows, besides their Characters to recommend them.'</Q> <HI>Jones</HI> started and changed Colour at the Name of <HI>Allworthy.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> answered he a little warmly, I do not take this at all kind. I will never bring any Slander on your House; but I must insist on seeing what Com∣pany I please in my own Room; and if that gives
<PB N="80" REF="85"/>
you any Offence, I shall, as soon as I am able, look for another Lodging.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I am sorry we must part then, Sir, said she, but I am convinced Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> himself would never come within my Doors, if he had the least Suspicion of my keeping an ill House.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Very well, Madam,' said <HI>Jones.—</HI>'I hope, Sir, said she, 'you are not angry; for I would not for the World offend any of Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Family. I have not slept a wink all Night about this Matter.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'I am sorry, I have disturbed your Rest, Madam,' said <HI>Jones,</HI> but I beg you will send <HI>Partridge</HI> up to me imme∣diately;'</Q> which she promised to do, and then with a very low Courtesy retired.</P>
<P>As soon as <HI>Partridge</HI> arrived, <HI>Jones</HI> fell upon him in the most outrageous manner.—<Q REND="inline">'How often,' said he, 'am I to suffer for your Folly, or rather for my own in keeping you? Is that Tongue of yours resolved upon my Destruction?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'What have I done, Sir?'</Q> answered affrighted <HI>Partridge,</HI><Q REND="inline">'Who was it gave you Authority to mention the Story of the Robbery, or that the Man you saw here was the Person?'—'I Sir?' cries <HI>Partridge.</HI> 'Now don't be guilty of a Falshood in denying it, said <HI>Jones.</HI>'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'If I did mention such a Matter, answers <HI>Partridge,</HI> 'I am sure, I thought no Harm: For I should not have opened my Lips, if it had not been to his own Friends and Relations, who, I ima∣gined, would have let it go no farther.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'But I have a much heavier Charge against you,' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> than this. How durst you, after all the Precautions I give you, mention the Name of Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> in this House?'</Q> <HI>Partridge</HI> denied that he ever had, with many Oaths. <Q REND="inline">'How else,' said <HI>Jones,</HI> should Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> be acquainted that there was any Con∣nection between him and me? And it is but this Moment she told me, she respected me on his Ac∣count.'</Q>
<PB N="81" REF="86"/>
—<Q REND="inline">'O Lord, Sir,' said <HI>Partridge,</HI> I desire only to be heard out; and to be sure, never was any thing so unfortunate; hear me but out, and you will own how wrongfully you have accused me. When Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> came down Stairs last Night, she met me in the Entry, and asked me when my Master had heard from Mr. <HI>Allworthy;</HI> and to be sure Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> heard the very Words; and the Moment Madam <HI>Honour</HI> was gone, she called me into the Parlour to her.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Mr. <HI>Partridge,'</HI> says she, What Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> is that the Gentlewoman men∣tioned? Is it the great Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> of <HI>Somerset∣shire?'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'Upon my Word, Madam,' says I, I know nothing of the Matter.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Sure,' says she, 'your Master is not the Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> I have heard Mr. <HI>All∣worthy</HI> talk of?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Upon my Word, Madam,' says I, I know nothing of the Matter.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Then,' says she, turning to her Daughter <HI>Nancy,'</HI> says she, as sure as ten Pence this is the very young Gentle∣man, and he agrees exactly with the Squire's Descrip∣tion. 'The Lord above knows who it was told her, for I am the arrantest Villain that ever walked up∣on two Legs if ever it came out of my Mouth.</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'I promise you, Sir, I can keep a Secret when I am desired.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Nay, Sir, so far was I from telling her any thing about Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> that I told her the very direct contrary: For though I did not con∣tradict it at that Moment, yet as second Thoughts, they say, are best; so when I came to consider that some body must have informed her, thinks I to my∣self, I will put an End to the Story, and so I went back again into the Parlour some time afterwards, and says I, Upon my word, says I, whoever, says I, told you that this Gentleman was Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> that is, says I, that this Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was that Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> told you a confounded Lie; and I beg, says I, you will never mention any such Matter, says I: for
<PB N="82" REF="87"/>
my Master, says I, will think I must have told you so, and I defy any body in the House, ever to say, I mentioned any such Word. To be certain, Sir, it is a wonderful Thing, and I have been thinking with myself ever since, how it was she came to know it: not but I saw an old Woman here t'other Day a begging at the Door, who looked as like her we saw in <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> that caused all that Mis∣chief to us. To be sure it is never good to pass by an old Woman without giving her something, e∣specially if she looks at you; for all the World shall never persuade me but that they have a great Pow∣er to do Mischief, and to be sure I shall never see at old Woman again, but I shall think to myself, <HI>In∣fandum, Regina, jubes renovare Dolorem.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>The Simplicity of <HI>Partridge</HI> set <HI>Jones</HI> a laughing and put a final end to his Anger, which had indeed seldom any long Duration in his Mind; and instead o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> commenting on his Defence, he told him he intende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> presently to leave those Lodgings, and ordered him t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> go and endeavour to get him others.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>A short Account of the History of Mrs.</HI> Miller.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JONES</HI> this Day eat a pretty good Dinner for a sick Man, that is to say, the larger Half a Shoul∣der of Mutton. In the Afternoon he received an In∣vitation from Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> to drink Tea: For that good Woman having learnt, either by Means of <HI>Par∣tridge,</HI> or by some other Means natural or super na∣tural, that he had a Connection with Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> could not endure the Thoughts of parting with him in an angry Manner.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> accepted the Invitation; and no sooner was the Tea-kettle removed, and the Girls sent out of the Room, than the Widow, without much Preface, be∣gan as follows: <Q REND="inline">'Well, there are very surprizing Things happen in this World; but certainly it is a wonderful Business, that I should have a Rela∣tion of Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> in my House, and never know any Thing of the Matter. Alas! Sir, you little imagine what a Friend that best of Gentlemen hath been to me and mine. Yes, Sir, I am not ashamed to own it; it is owing to his Goodness,
<PB N="88" REF="93"/>
that I did not long since perish for Want, and leave my poor little Wretches, two destitute helpless friendless Orphans, to the Care or rather to the Cruelty of the World.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'You must know, Sir, though I am now re∣duced to get my Living by letting Lodgings, I was born and bred a Gentlewoman. My Father was an Officer of the Army, and died in a considerable Rank: But he lived up to his Pay; and as that ex∣pired with him, his Family, at his Death, became Beggars. We were three Sisters. One of us had the good Luck to dies soon afterwards of the Small-pox. A Lady was so kind to take the second out of Charity, as she said, to wait upon her. The Mother of this Lady had been a Servant to my Grandmother; and having inherited a vast Fortune from her Fa∣ther, which he had got by Pawn-broking, was mar∣ried to a Gentleman of great Estate and Fashion. She used my Sister so barbarously, often upraiding her with her Birth and Poverty, calling her in De∣rision a Gentlewoman, that I believe she at length broke the Heart of the poor Girl. In short, she likewise died within a Twelvemonth after my Father. Fortune thought proper to provide better for me, and within a Month from his Decease I was married to a Clergyman, who had been my Lover a long▪ Time before, and who had been very i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> used by my Father upon that Account; for though my poor Father could not give any of us a Shilling, yet he bred us up as delicately, considered us, and would have had us consider ourselves as highly, as if we had been the richest Heiresses. But my dear Husband forgot all this Usage, and the Moment we were become fatherless, he immediately renewed his Addresses to me so warmly, that I, who always liked, and now more than ever esteemed him, soon comply'd. Five Years did I live in a State of per∣fect

Happiness with that best of Men, 'till at last—Oh! cruel, cruel Fortune that ever sepa∣rated us, that deprived me of the kindest of Hus∣bands, and my poor Girls of the tenderest Parent.—O my poor Girls! you never knew the Blessing which ye lost—I am ashamed, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> of this womanish Weakness; but I shall never mention him without Tears.'—'I ought rather, Madam,' said <HI>Jones,</HI> 'to be ashamed that I do not accompany you.'—Well, Sir,' con∣tinued she, 'I was now left a second Time in a much worse Condition than before; besides the terrible Affliction I was to encounter, I had now two Chil∣dren to provide for; and was if possible more pen∣nyless than ever, when that great, that good, that glorious Man, Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> who had some little Acquaintance with my Husband, accidentally heard of my Distress, and immediately writ this Letter to me. Here, Sir;—here it is; I put it into my Pocket to shew it you. This is the Letter, Sir; I must and will read it you.'</Q></P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I I heartily condole with you on your late grievous Loss, which your own good Sense, and the excel∣lent Lessons you must have learnt from the wor∣thiest of Men, will better enable you to bear, than any Advice which I am capable of giving. Nor have I any Doubt that you, whom I have heard to be the tenderest of Mothers, will suffer any im∣moderate Indulgence of Grief to prevent you from discharging your Duty to those poor Infants, who now alone stand in Need of your Tenderness.</P>
<P>However, as you must be supposed at present to be incapable of much worldly Consideration, you will pardon my having ordered a Person to wait on you, and to pay you Twenty Guineas, which I beg you will accept 'till I have the Pleasure of see∣ing you, and believe me to be, Madam, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="90" REF="95"/>
<Q REND="inline">'This Letter, Sir, I received within a Fortnight after the irreparable Loss I have mentioned, and within a Fortnight afterwards, Mr. <HI>Allworthy,—</HI>the blessed Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> came to pay me a Vi∣sit, when he placed me in the House you now see me, gave me a large Sum of Money to furnish it, and settled an Annuity of <HI>50l.</HI> a Year upon me, which I have constantly received ever since. Judge then, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> in what Regard I must hold a Benefactor, to whom I owe the Preservation of my Life, and of those dear Children, for whose Sake alone my Life is valuable.—Do not, there∣fore, think me impertinent, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> (since I must esteem one for whom I know Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> hath so much Value) if I beg you not to converse with these wicked Women. You are a young Gentleman, and do not know half their artful Wiles. Do not be angry with me, Sir, for what I said upon account of my House; you must be sensible i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would be the Ruin of my poor, dear Girls. Be∣sides, Sir, you cannot but be acquainted, that Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> himself would never forgive my conniving at such Matters, and particularly with you.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Upon my Word, Madam,' said <HI>Jones,</HI> 'you need make no farther Apology; nor do I in the least take any Thing ill you have said; but give me Leave as no one can have more Value than myself for Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> to deliver you from one Mistake which, perhaps, would not be altogether for his Honour: I do assure you, I am no Relation of his'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Alas! Sir,' answered she, 'I know you are not. I know very well who you are; for Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> hath told me all: But I do assure you, had you been twenty Times his Son, he could not have express<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> more Regard for you, than he hath often expresse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in my Presence. You need not be ashamed, Sir
<PB N="91" REF="96"/>
of what you are; I promise you no good Person will esteem you the less on that Account. No, Mr. <HI>Jones;</HI> the Words dishonourable Birth are Non∣sense, as my dear, dear Husband used to say, unless the Word dishonourable be applied to the Parents; for the Children can derive no real Dishonour from an Act of which they are entirely innocent.'</Q></P>
<P>Here <HI>Jones</HI> heaved a deep Sigh, and then said, Since I perceive, Madam, you really do know me, and Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> hath thought proper to mention my Name to you; and since you have been so ex∣plicit with me as to your own Affairs, I will ac∣quaint you with some more Circumstances concern∣ing myself.' And these Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> having expres∣sed great Desire and Curiosity to hear, he began and related to her his whole History, without once men∣tioning the Name of <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>There is a Kind of Sympathy in honest Minds, by Means of which they give an easy Credit to each o∣ther. Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> believed all which <HI>Jones</HI> told her to be true, and exprest much pity and Concern for him. She was beginning to comment on the Story, but <HI>Jones</HI> interrupted her: For as the Hour of Assig∣nation now drew nigh, he began to stipulate for a se∣cond Interview with the Lady that Evening, which he promised should be the last at her House; swearing, at the same Time, that she was one of great Distinc∣tion, and that nothing but what was entirely innocent was to pass between them; and I do firmly believe he intended to keep his Word.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> was at length prevailed on, and <HI>Jones</HI> departed to his Chamber, where he sat alone till Twelve o'Clock, but no Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> appeared.</P>
<P>As we have said that this Lady had a great Affection for <HI>Jones,</HI> and as it must have appeared that she really had so, the Reader may perhaps wonder at the first Failure of her Appointment, as she apprehended him
<PB N="92" REF="97"/>
to be confined by Sickness, a Season when Friendship seems most to require such Visits. This Behaviour, there∣fore, in the Lady, may, by some, be condemned as unnatural; but that is not our Fault; for our Business is only to record Truth.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Containing a Scene which we doubt not will affect all our Readers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Jones</HI> closed not his Eyes during all the for∣mer Part of the Night; not owing to any Un∣easiness which he conceived at being disappointed by Lady <HI>Bellaston;</HI> nor was <HI>Sophia</HI> herself, though most of his waking Hours were justly to be charged to her Account, the present Cause of dispelling his Slumber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> In Fact, poor <HI>Jones</HI> was one of the best-natured fel∣lows alive, and had all that Weakness which is called Compassion, and which distinguishes this imperfect Character from that noble Firmness of Mind, which rolls a Man as it were, within himself, and, like a polished Bowl, enables him to run through the Work without being once stopped by the Calamities which happen to others. He could not help, therefore, com∣passionating the Situation of poor <HI>Nancy,</HI> whose Lord for Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> seemed to him so apparent, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he was astonished at the Blindness of her Mother who had more than once, the preceding Evening remarked to him the great Change in the Temper o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her Daughter, <Q REND="inline">'who from being,' she said, one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the liveliest, merriest Girls in the World, was, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a sudden, become all Gloom and Melancholy.</Q></P>
<P>Sleep, however, at length got the better of all Re∣sistance; and now, as if he had really been a Deity as the Ancients imagined, and an offended one too, he seemed to enjoy his dear-bought Conquest.—To speak simply, and without any Metaphor, Mr.

<HI>Jones</HI> slept till Eleven the next Morning, and would, perhaps, have continued in the same quiet Situation much longer, had not a violent Uproar awakened him.</P>
<P><HI>Partridge</HI> was now summoned, who, being asked what was the Matter, answered, <Q REND="inline">'That there was a dreadful Hurricane below Stairs; that Miss <HI>Nancy</HI> was in Fits; and that the other Sister and the Mo∣ther were both crying and lamenting over her.'</Q> <HI>Jones</HI> expressed much Concern at this News, which <HI>Partridge</HI> endeavoured to relieve, by saying, with a Smile, <Q REND="inline">'He fancied the young Lady was in no Dan∣ger of Death; for that <HI>Susan</HI> (which was the Name of the Maid) had given him to understand, it was nothing more than a common Affair. In short,' said he, 'Miss <HI>Nancy</HI> hath had a Mind to be as wise as her Mother, that's all. She was a little hungry, it seems, and so sat down to Dinner before Grace was said, and so there is a Child coming for the Foundling Hospital.'—'Prithee leave thy stupid jesting,' cries <HI>Jones;</HI> 'is the Misery of these poor Wretches a Subject of Mirth? Go immediately to Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> and tell her I beg Leave,—Stay, you will make some Blunder, I will go myself; for she desired me to breakfast with her.'</Q> He then rose and dressed himself as fast as he could; and while he was dressing, <HI>Partridge,</HI> notwithstanding many severe Rebukes, could not avoid throwing forth certain Pieces of Brutality, commonly called Jests, on this Occasion. <HI>Jones</HI> was no sooner dressed than he walked down Stairs, and knocking at the Door was presently admitted, by the Maid into the outward Parlour, which was as empty of Company as it was of any Apparatus for eating. Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> was in the inner Room with her Daughter, whence the Maid presently brought a Message to Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'that her Mistress hoped he would excuse the Disappointment,

For Men of a benign Disposition enjoy their own Acts. Beneficence, equally with those to whom they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> done, so there are scarce any Natures so entirely di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦bolical, as to be capable of doing Injuries, with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> paying themselves some Pangs, for the Ruin wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they bring on their Fellow-Creatures.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nightingale,</HI> at least, was not such a Pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> On the contrary, <HI>Jones</HI> found him in his new Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ings, sitting melancholy by the Fire, and silently
<PB N="99" REF="104"/>
menting the unhappy Situation in which he had placed poor <HI>Nancy.</HI> He no sooner saw his Friend appear, than he rose hastily to meet him; and after much Congratulation said, <Q REND="inline">'Nothing could have been more opportune than this kind Visit; for I was never more in the Spleen in my Life.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I am sorry,' answered <HI>Jones,</HI> 'that I bring News very unlikely to relieve you; nay, what I am con∣vinced must, of all other, shock you the most. However, it is necessary you should know it. With∣out further Preface then, I come to you, Mr. <HI>Nightingale,</HI> from a worthy Family, which you have involved in Misery and Ruin.'</Q> Mr. <HI>Nightin∣gale</HI> changed Colour at these Words; but <HI>Jones,</HI> with∣out regarding it, proceeded, in the liveliest Manner, to paint the tragical Story, with which the Reader was acquainted in the last Chapter.</P>
<P><HI>Nightingale</HI> never once interrupted the Narration, though he discovered violent Emotions at many Parts of it. But when it was concluded, after fetching a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eep Sigh, he said, <Q REND="inline">'What you tell me, my Friend, affects me in the tenderest Manner. Sure there ne∣ver was so cursed an Accident as the poor Girl's betraying my Letter. Her Reputation might other∣wise have been safe, and the Affair might have re∣mained a profound Secret; and then the Girl might have gone off never the worse; for many such Things happen in this Town; and if the Husband should suspect a little, when it is too late, it will be his wiser Conduct to conceal his Suspicion both from his Wife and the World.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Indeed, my Friend,' answered <HI>Jones,</HI> 'this could not have been the Case with your poor <HI>Nancy.</HI> You have so entirely gained her Affections, that it is the Loss of you, and not of her Reputation, which af∣flicts her, and will end in the Destruction of her and her Family.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Nay, for that Matter, I pro∣mise
<PB N="100" REF="105"/>
you,' cries <HI>Nightingale,</HI> 'she hath my Affecti∣ons so absolutely, that my Wife, whoever she is to be, will have very little Share in them.' And is it possible then,' said <HI>Jones,</HI> 'you can think of de∣serting her?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Why what can I do?' answered the other.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Ask Miss <HI>Nancy;'</HI> replied <HI>Jones</HI> warmly. 'In the Condition to which you have reduced her, I sincerely think she ought to determine what Repa∣ration you shall make her. Her Interest alone, and not yours, ought to be your sole Consideration. But if you ask me what you shall do; what can you do less,' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'than to fulfil the Expec∣tations of her Family, and her own. Nay, and I sincerely tell you, they were mine too, ever since I first saw you together. You will pardon me, if I presume on the Friendship you have favoured me with, moved as I am with Compassion for those poor Creatures. But your own Heart will best suggest to you, whether you have never intended, by your Conduct, to persuade the Mother, as well as the Daughter, into an Opinion, that you design∣ed honourably: And if so, though there may have been no direct Promise of Marriage in the Case, I will leave to your own good Understanding, how far you are bound to proceed.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Nay, I must not only confess what you have hinted,' said <HI>Nightingale;</HI> 'but I am afraid even that very Promise you mention I have given.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'And can you, after owning that,' said <HI>Jones,</HI> 'hesitate a Moment?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Consider, my Friend,' answered the other; 'I know you are a Man of Honour, and would advise no one to act contrary to its Rules; if there were no other Objection, can I, after this Publica∣tion of her Disgrace, think of such an Alliance with Honour?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Undoubtedly,' replied <HI>Jones;</HI> 'and the very best and truest Honour, which is Good∣ness, requires it of you. As you mention a Scru∣ple
<PB N="101" REF="106"/>
of this Kind, you will give me leave to examine it. Can you, with Honour, be guilty of having, under false Pretences, deceived a young Woman and her Family, and of having, by these Means, treacherously robbed her of her Innocence? Can you, with Honour, be the knowing, the wilful, nay, I must add, the artful Contriver of the Ruin of a Human Being? Can you, with Honour, de∣stroy the Fame, the Peace, nay, probably, both the Life and Soul too of this Creature? Can Ho∣nour bear the Thought, that this Creature is a ten∣der, helpless, defenceless young Woman? A young Woman who loves, who doats on you, who dies for you; who hath placed the utmost Confidence in your Promises; and to that Confidence hath sacri∣ficed every Thing which is dear to her? Can Honour support such Contemplations as these a Moment?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Common Sense, indeed,' said <HI>Nightingale,</HI> 'war∣rants all you say; but yet you well know the Opi∣nion of the World is so much the contrary, that was I to marry a Whore, tho' my own, I should be ashamed of ever showing my Face again.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Fie upon it, Mr. <HI>Nightingale,'</HI> said <HI>Jones,</HI> 'do not call her by so ungenerous a Name: When you promised to marry her, she became your Wife, and she hath sinned more against Prudence than Virtue. And what is this World, which you would be ashamed to face, but the Vile, the Foolish, and the Profligate? Forgive me, if I say such a Shame must proceed from false Modesty, which always attends false Honour as its Shadow.—But I am well as∣sured there is not a Man of real Sense and Goodness in the World, who would not honour and applaud the Action. But admit no other would, would not your own Heart, my Friend, applaud it? And do not the warm, rapturous Sensations, which we feel from the Consciousness of an honest, noble, gene∣rous,
<PB N="102" REF="107"/>
benevolent Action, convey more Delight to the Mind, than the undeserved Praise of Millions? Set the Alternative fairly before your Eyes. On the one Side, see this poor, unhappy, tender, believ∣ing Girl, in the Arms of her wretched Mother, breathing her last. Hear her breaking Heart in Agonies sighing out your Name; and lamenting, ra∣ther than accusing, the Cruelty which weighs her down to Destruction. Paint to your Imagination the Circumstances of her fond, despairing Parent, driven to Madness, or, perhaps, to Death, by the Loss of her lovely Daughter. View the poor, help∣less, Orphan-Infant: And when your Mind hath dwelt a Moment only on such Ideas, consider your∣self as the Cause of all; the Ruin of this poor, lit∣tle, worthy, defenceless Family. On the other Side, consider yourself as relieving them from their tem∣porary Sufferings. Think with what Joy, with what Transports, that lovely Creature will fly to your Arms. See her Blood returning to her pale Cheeks, her Fire to her languid Eyes, and Raptures to her tortured Breast. Consider the Exultations of her Mother, the Happiness of all. Think of this little Family made, by one Act of yours, complete∣ly happy. Think of this Alternative, and sure I am mistaken in my Friend, if it requires any long Deli∣beration, whether he will sink these Wretches down for ever, or, by one generous, noble Resolution, raise them all from the Brink of Misery and De∣spair, to the highest Pitch of human Happiness. Add to this but one Consideration more; the Considera∣tion that it is your Duty so to do—That the Mi∣sery from which you will relieve these poor People, is the Misery which you yourself have wilfully brought upon them.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'O my dear Friend,' cries <HI>Nightingale,</HI> 'I wanted not your Eloquence to rouse me. I pity poor <HI>Nan∣cy</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="108"/>
from my Soul, and would willingly give any Thing in my Power, that no Familiarities had ever passed between us. Nay, believe me, I had many Struggles with my Passion, before I could prevail with myself to write that cruel Letter, which hath caused all the Misery in that unhappy Family. If I had no Inclinations to consult but my own, I would marry her Tomorrow Morning; I would, by Hea∣ven; but you will easily imagine how impossible it would be to prevail on my Father to consent to such a Match; besides, he hath provided another for me; and Tomorrow, by his express Command, I am to wait on the Lady.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I have not the Honour to know your Father,' said <HI>Jones;</HI> 'but suppose he could be persuaded, would you yourself consent to the only Means of preserv∣ing these poor People?' 'As eagerly as I would pursue my Happiness,' answered <HI>Nightingale;</HI> 'for I never shall find it in any other Woman.—O my dear Friend, could you imagine what I have felt within these twelve Hours for my poor Girl, I am convinced she would not engross all your Pity. Passion leads me only to her; and if I had any fool∣ish Scruples of Honour, you have fully satisfied them: Could my Father be induced to comply with my Desires, nothing would be wanting to compleat my own Happiness, or that of my <HI>Nancy.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Then I am resolved to undertake it,' said <HI>Jones,</HI> 'You must not be angry with me, in whatever Light it may be necessary to set this Affair, which, you may depend on it, could not otherwise be long hid from him; for Things of this Nature make a quick Progress, when once they get abroad, as this un∣happily hath already. Besides, should any fatal Ac∣cident follow, as upon my Soul I am afraid will, unless immediately prevented, the Public would ring of your Name, in a Manner which, if your Father
<PB N="104" REF="109"/>
hath common Humanity, must offend him. If you will therefore tell me where I may find the old Gen∣tleman, I will not loose a Moment in the Business; which while I pursue, you cannot do a more gene∣reous Action, than by paying a Visit to the poor Girl. You will find I have not exaggerated in the Account I have given of the Wretchedness of the Family.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Nightingale</HI> immediately consented to the Proposal; and now having acquainted <HI>Jones</HI> with his Father's Lodging, and the Coffee-house where he would most probably find him, he hesitated a Moment, and then said, <Q REND="inline">'My dear <HI>Tom,</HI> you are going to undertake an Impossibility. If you knew my Father, you would never think of obtaining his Consent.—Stay, there is one Way—Suppose you told him I was already married, it might be easier to reconcile him to the Fact after it was done; and, upon my Honour, I am so affected with what you have said, and I love my <HI>Nancy</HI> so passionately, I almost wish it was done, whatever might be the Consequence.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> greatly approved the Hint, and promised to pursue it. They then separated, <HI>Nightingale</HI> to vi∣sit his <HI>Nancy,</HI> and <HI>Jones</HI> in quest of the old Gentleman.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>What passed between</HI> Jones <HI>and old Mr.</HI> Nightingale, <HI>with the Arrival of a Person not yet mentioned in this History.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOtwithstanding the Sentiment of the <HI>Roman</HI> Sa∣tyrist, which denies the Divinity of Fortune; and the Opinion of <HI>Seneca</HI> to the same Purpose; <HI>Ci∣cero,</HI> who was, I believe, a wiser Man than either of them, expresly holds the contrary; and certain it is there are some Incidents in Life so very strange and unaccountable, that it seems to require more than hu∣man Skill and Foresight in producing them.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="110"/>
Of this Kind was what now happened to <HI>Jones,</HI> who found Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> the elder in so critical a Minute, that Fortune, if she was really worthy all the Worship she received at <HI>Rome,</HI> could not have con∣trived such another. In short the old Gentleman and the Father of the young Lady whom he intended for his Son, had been hard at it for many Hours; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atter was just now gone, and had left the former de∣lighted with the Thoughts that he had succeeded in a long Contention which had been between the two Fa∣thers of the future Bride and Bridegroom; in which both endeavoured to over-reach the other, and as not rarely happens in such Cases, both had retreated fully satisfied of having obtained the Victory.</P>
<P>This Gentleman whom Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> now visited, was what they call a Man of the World, that is to say, a Man who directs his Conduct in this World, as one who being fully persuaded there is no other, as resolved to make the most of this. In his early Years he had been bred to Trade, but having acquired a very good Fortune, he had lately declined his Busi∣ness; or to speak more properly, had changed it from dealing in Goods to dealing only in Money, of which he had always a plentiful Fund at Command, and of which he knew very well how to make a very plentiful Advantage; sometimes of the Necessities of private Men, and sometimes those of the Public. He had indeed conversed so entirely with Money, that it may be almost doubted, whether he imagined there was any other thing really existing in the World; this at least may be certainly averred, that he firmly believed nothing else to have any real Value.</P>
<P>The Reader will, I fancy, allow, that Fortune could not have culled out a more improper Person for Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> to attack with any Probability of Success, nor could the whimsical Lady have directed this At∣tack at a more unseasonable Time.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="111"/>
As Money then was always uppermost in this Gen∣tleman's Thoughts, so the Moment he saw a Stranger within his Doors, it immediately occurred to his Ima∣gination, that such Stranger was either come to bring him Money, or to fetch it from him. And according as one or other of these Thoughts prevailed, he con∣ceived a favourable or unfavourable Idea of the Person who approached him.</P>
<P>Unluckily for <HI>Jones,</HI> the latter of these was the Ascendant at present; for as a young Gentleman had visited him the Day before, with a Bill from his Son for a Play Debt, he apprehended at the first Sight of <HI>Jones,</HI> that he was come on such another Errand. <HI>Jones</HI> therefore had no sooner told him that he was come on his Son's Account, than the old Gentleman, being confirmed in his Suspicion, burst forth into an Exclamation, 'That he would lose his Labour.' <Q REND="inline">'Is it then possible, Sir,' answered <HI>Jones,</HI> 'that you can guess my Business?' If I do guess it, replied the o∣ther, I repeat again to you, you will lose your La∣bour. What, I suppose you are one of those Sparks who lead my Son into all those Scenes of Riot and Debauchery, which will be his Destruction; but I shall pay no more of his Bills I promise you. I ex∣pect he will quit all such Company for the future. If I had imagined otherwise I should not have pro∣vided a Wife for him; for I would be instrumental in the Ruin of no Body.' 'How, Sir, said <HI>Jones,</HI> and was this Lady of your providing?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Pray Sir,' an∣swered the old Gentleman, 'how comes it to be any Concern of yours?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Nay, dear Sir,' replied <HI>Jones,</HI> 'be not offended that I interest myself in what regards your Son's Happiness, for whom I have so great an Honour and Value. It was upon that very Account I came to wait upon you. I can't express the Satisfaction you have given me by what you say for I do assure you your Son is a Person for whom
<PB N="107" REF="112"/>
I have the highest Honour.—Nay, Sir, it is not easy to express the Esteem I have for you, who could be so generous, so good, so kind, so indulgent to provide such a Match for your Son; a Woman who, I dare swear, will make him one of the hap∣piest Men upon Earth.'</Q></P>
<P>There is scarce any thing which so happily introduces Men to our good Liking, as having conceived some Alarm at their first Appearance; when once those Ap∣prehensions begin to vanish, we soon forget the Fears which they occasion, and look on ourselves as indebt∣ed for our present Ease, to those very Persons who at first rais'd our Fears.</P>
<P>Thus it happened to <HI>Nightingale,</HI> who no sooner found that <HI>Jones</HI> had no Demand on him, as he su∣spected, than he began to be pleased with his Presence. <Q REND="inline">'Pray, good Sir, said he, be pleased to sit down. I do not remember to have ever had the Pleasure of seeing you before; but if you are a Friend of my Son, and have any thing to say concerning this young Lady, I shall be glad to hear you. As to her making him happy, it will be his own Fault if she doth not. I have discharged my Duty, in taking Care of the main Article. She will bring him a Fortune capable of making any reasonable, prudent, sober Man happy.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Undoubtedly, cries <HI>Jones,</HI> for she is in herself a Fortune; so beautiful, so genteel, so sweet-tempered, and so well educated; she is in∣deed a most accomplished young Lady; sings admi∣rably well, and hath a most delicate Hand at the Harpsichord.' 'I did not know any of these Matters, answered the old Gentleman, for I never saw the the Lady; but I do not like her the worse for what you tell me; and I am the better pleased with her Father for not laying any Stress on these Qualificati∣ons in our Bargain. I shall always think it a Proof of his Understanding. A silly Fellow would have
<PB N="108" REF="113"/>
brought in these Articles as an Addition to her For∣tune; but to give him his due, he never mentioned any such Matter; though to be sure they are no Di∣sparagements to a Woman.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I do assure you, Sir,' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'she hath them all in the most eminent Degree: For my Part I own I was afraid you might have been a little backward, a little less inclined to the Match: For your Son told me you had never seen the Lady, therefore I came, Sir, in that Case, to entreat you, to conjure you, as you value the Happiness of your Son, not to beaverse to his Match with a Woman who hath not only all the good Qua∣lities I have mentioned, but many more.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'If that was your Business, Sir, said the old Gentleman, we are both obliged to you; and you may be per∣fectly easy, for I give you my Word I was very well satisfied with her Fortune.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Sir,' answered <HI>Jones,</HI> I honour you every Moment more and more. To be so easily satisfied, so very moderate on that Ac∣count, is a Proof of the Soundness of your Under∣standing, as well as the Nobleness of your Mind.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Not so very moderate, young Gentleman, not so very moderate, answered the Father.—Still more and more noble, replied <HI>Jones,</HI> and give me Leave to add sensible: For sure it is little less than Madness to consider Money as the sole Founda∣tion of Happiness. Such a Woman as this with her little, her nothing of a Fortune.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'I find, cries the old Gentleman, you have a pretty just Opinion of Money, my Friend, or else you are better ac∣quainted with the Person of the Lady than with her Circumstances. Why pray, what Fortune do you imagine this Lady to have?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'What Fortune? cries <HI>Jones,</HI> why too contemptible a one to be nam∣ed for your Son. Well, well, well, said the other, perhaps he might have done better.'—'That I deny, said <HI>Jones,</HI> for she is one of the best of Wo∣men.'</Q>
<PB N="109" REF="114"/>
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, ay, but in Point of Fortune I mean—answered the other.—And yet as to that now, how much do you imagine your Friend is to have?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'How much, cries <HI>Jones,</HI> how much!—Why at the utmost, perhaps, 200 <HI>l.</HI>'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Do you mean to banter me, young Gentleman? said the Father a little angry.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'No, upon my Soul, answered <HI>Jones,</HI> I am in Earnest, nay I be∣lieve I have gone to the utmost Farthing. If I do the Lady an Injury, I ask her Pardon.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed you do, cries the Father. I am certain she hath fif∣ty Times that Sum, and she shall produce fifty to that before I consent that she shall marry my Son.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Nay, said <HI>Jones,</HI> it is too late to talk of Consent now—If she hath not fifty Farthings your Son is married.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'My Son married! answered the old Gentleman with Surprise.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Nay, said <HI>Jones,</HI> 'I thought you was unacquainted with it.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'My Son married to Miss <HI>Harris!</HI>' answered he again'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'To Miss <HI>Harris!</HI> Said <HI>Jones,</HI> no Sir, to Miss <HI>Nancy Miller,</HI> the Daughter of Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> at whose House he lodged; a young Lady, who, though her Mother is reduced to let Lodgings'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Are you bantering, or are you in Earnest?'</Q> cries the Father with a most solemn Voice. <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir, answered <HI>Jones,</HI> 'I scorn the Character of a Banter∣er. I came to you in most serious Earnest, imagin∣ing, as I find true, that your Son had never dared acquaint you with a Match so much inferior to him in Point of Fortune, tho' the Reputation of the La∣dy will suffer it no longer to remain a Secret.'</Q></P>
<P>While the Father stood like one struck suddenly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mb at this News, a Gentleman came into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oom, and saluted him by the Name of Brother.</P>
<P>But though these two were in Consanguinity so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arly related, they were in their Dispositions almost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e opposites to each other. The Brother who now
<PB N="110" REF="115"/>
arrived had likewise been bred to Trade, in which he no sooner saw himself worth 6000 <HI>l.</HI> than he purchase<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a small Estate with the greatest Part of it, and retired into the Country; where he married the Daughter o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an unbeneficed Clergyman; a young Lady who, though she had neither Beauty nor Fortune, had re∣commended herself to his Choice, entirely by her good Humour, of which she possessed a very immoderate Share.</P>
<P>With this Woman he had, during twenty-five Years, lived a Life more resembling the Model which certain Poets ascribe to the Golden Age, than any o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those Patterns which are furnished by the present Times. By her he had four Children, but none o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them arrived at Maturity except only one Daughter, whom in vulgar Language he and his Wife had spoil∣ed; that is, had educated with the utmost Tenderness and Fondness; which she returned to such a Degree, that she had actually refused a very extraordinary Match with a Gentleman a little turned of forty, be∣cause she could not bring herself to part with her Pa∣rents.</P>
<P>The young Lady whom Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> had in∣tended for his Son was a near Neighbour of his Bro∣ther, and an Acquaintance of his Niece; and in reali∣ty it was upon the Account of this projected Match, that he was now come to Town; not indeed to for∣ward, but to dissuade his Brother from a Purpose which he conceived would inevitably ruin his Nephew; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> foresaw no other Event, from a Union with Miss <HI>Har∣ris,</HI> notwithstanding the Largeness of her Fortune, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> neither her Person nor Mind seemed to him to promi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> any Kind of matrimonial Felicity; for she was very tall, very thin, very ugly, very affected, very silly and very ill-natured.</P>
<P>His Brother therefore no sooner mentioned the Mar∣riage of his Nephew with Miss <HI>Miller,</HI> than he ex∣prest
<PB N="111" REF="116"/>
the utmost Satisfaction; and when the Father had very bitterly reviled his Son, and pronounced Sen∣tence of Beggary upon him, the Uncle began in the following Manner.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'If you was a little cooler, Brother, I would ask you whether you love your Son for his Sake, or for your own. You would answer, I suppose, and so I suppose you think, for his Sake; and doubtless it is his Happiness which you intended in the Marriage you proposed for him.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Now, Brother, to prescribe Rules of Happiness to others, hath always appeared to me very absurd, and to insist on doing this very tyrannical. It is a vulgar Error I know; but it is nevertheless an Error. And if this be absurd in other Things, it is mostly so in the Affair of Marriage, the Happiness of which depends entirely on the Affection which sub∣sists between the Parties.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I have therefore always thought it unreasonable in Parents to desire to chuse for their Children on this Occasion, since to force Affection is an impossible Attempt; nay, so much doth Love abhor Force, that I know not whether through an unfortunate but incureable Perverseness in our Natures, it may not be even impatient of Persuasion.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'It is, however, true, that though a Parent will not, I think, wisely prescribe, he ought to be con∣sulted on this Occasion, and in Strictness perhaps should at least have a negative Voice. My Nephew therefore, I own, in marrying without asking your Advice, hath been guilty of a Fault. But honestly speaking, Brother, have you not a little promoted this Fault? Have not your frequent Declarations on this Subject, given him a moral Certainty of your Refusal, where there was any Deficiency in Point of Fortune? nay, doth not your present Anger a∣rise solely from that Deficiency? And if he hath
<PB N="112" REF="117"/>
failed in his Duty here, did not you as much exceed that Authority, when you absolutely bar∣gained with him for a Woman without his Know∣ledge, whom you yourself never saw, and whom if you had seen and known as well as I, it must have been Madness in you, to have ever thought of bring∣ing her into your Family.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Still I own my Nephew in a Fault; but surely it is not an unpardonable Fault. He hath acted indeed without your Consent, in a Matter in which he ought to have asked it; but it is in a Matter in which his Interest is principally concerned; you yourself must and will acknowledge, that you con∣sulted his Interest only, and if he unfortunately dif∣fered from you, and hath been mistaken in his No∣tion of Happiness, will you, Brother, if you love your Son, carry him still wider from the Point? Will you encrease the ill Consequences of his simple Choice? Will you endeavour to make an Event certain Misery to him, which may accidentally prove so? In a Word, Brother, because he hath put it out of your Power to make his Circumstances as affluent as you would, will you distress them as much as you can?'</Q></P>
<P>By the Force of the true Catholic Faith, St. <HI>An∣thony</HI> won upon the Fishes. <HI>Orpheus</HI> and <HI>Amphi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> went a little farther, and by the Charms of Music en∣chanted Things merely inanimate. Wonderful both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But neither History nor Fable have ever yet ventured to record an Instance of any one, who by Force o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Argument and Reason had triumphed over habitu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Avarice.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nightingale,</HI> the Father, instead of attempt∣ing to answer his Brother, contented himself with only observing, that they had always differed in their Senti∣ments concerning the Education of their Children. <Q REND="inline">'I wish, said he, Brother, you would have consined
<PB N="113" REF="118"/>

<P>AT his Return to his Lodgings, <HI>Jones</HI> found the Situation of Affairs greatly altered from what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey had been in at his Departure. The Mother, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wo Daughters and young Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> were now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t down to Supper together, when the Uncle was, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s own Desire, introduced without any Ceremony to the Company, to all of whom he was well known; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he had several Times visited his Nephew at that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouse.</P>
<P>The old Gentleman immediately walked up to Miss <HI>Nancy,</HI> saluted and wished her Joy, as he did after∣wards the Mother and the other Sister; and lastly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> paid the proper Compliments to his Nephew, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e same good Humour and Curtesy, as if his Nephew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d married his equal or superior in Fortune, with all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e previous Requisites first performed.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Nancy</HI> and her supposed Husband both turned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and looked rather foolish than otherwise upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Occasion; but Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> took the first Oppor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nity of withdrawing; and having sent for <HI>Jones</HI> into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Dining Room, she threw herself at his Feet, and in

a most passionate Flood of Tears, called him her good Angel, the preserver of her poor little Family, with many other respectful and endearing Appella∣tions, and made him every Acknowledgment which the highest Benefit can extract from the most grateful Hearts.</P>
<P>After the first Gust of her Passion was a little over, which she declared, if she had not vented, would have burst her, she proceeded to inform Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> that all Matters were settled between Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> and her Daughter, and that they were to be married the next Morning: At which Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> having ex∣prest much Pleasure, the poor Woman fell again into a Fit of Joy and Thanksgiving, which he at lengt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with Difficulty silenced, and prevailed on her t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> return with him back to the Company, whom the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> found in the same good Humour in which they ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> left them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>A short Chapter which concludes the Book.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE long Absence of the Uncle and the Ne∣phew occasioned some Disquiet in the Minds of whom they had left behind them; and the more, during the preceding Dialogue, the Uncle had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re than once elevated his Voice, so as to be heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn Stairs; which though they could not distin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh what he said, had caused some evil foreboding <HI>Nancy</HI> and her Mother, and indeed even in <HI>Jones</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>self.</P>
<P>When the good Company therefore again assembled, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was a visible Alteration in all their Faces; and good Humour which at their last Meeting, uni∣versally
<PB N="118" REF="123"/>
shone forth in every Countenance, was now changed into a much less agreeable Aspect. It was a Change indeed common enough to the Weather in this Climate, from Sunshine to Clouds, from <HI>June</HI> to <HI>December.</HI></P>
<P>This Alteration was not however greatly remarked by any present; for as every one was now endeavouring to conceal their own Thoughts, and to act a Part, they became all too busily engaged in the Scene to be Specta∣tors of it. Thus neither the Uncle nor Nephew saw any Symptoms of Suspicion in the Mother or Daughter nor did the Mother or Daughter remark the over-act¦ed Complaisance of the old Man, nor the counter∣feit Satisfaction which grinned in the Features of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> young one.</P>
<P>Something like this, I believe, frequently happens where the whole Attention of two Friends being en¦gaged in the Part which each is to act, in order to impose on the other, neither sees nor suspects the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> practised against himself; and thus the Thrust of bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> (to borrow no improper Metaphor on the Occasion alike takes Place.</P>
<P>From the same Reason it is no unusual Thing f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> both Parties to be over-reached in a Bargain, thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the one must be always the greater Loser; as was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> who sold a blind Horse, and received a bad Note i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Payment.</P>
<P>Our Company in about half an Hour broke up and the Uncle carried off his Nephew; but not be¦fore the latter had assured Miss <HI>Nancy,</HI> in a Whisper that he would attend her early in the Morning, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fulfil all his Engagements.</P>
<P><HI>Jones,</HI> who was the least concerned in this Sce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> saw the most.

<P>While he was reasoning with himself, whether he could acquaint these poor People with his Suspicion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Maid of the House informed him, that a Gentle∣woman desired to speak with him.—He went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmediately out, and taking the Candle from the Maid, ushered his Visitant up Stairs, who in the Per∣son of Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> acquainted him with such dread∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul News concerning his <HI>Sophia,</HI> that he immediately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost all Consideration for every other Person; and his whole Stock of Compassion was entirely swallowed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p in Reflections on his own Misery, and on that of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is unfortunate Angel.</P>
<P>What this dreadful Matter was, the Reader will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>formed, after we have first related the many preced∣ing Steps which produced it, and those will be the Sub∣ject of the following Book.</P>

<P>THERE are a Set of Religious, or rather Mo¦ral Writers, who teach that Virtue is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> certain Road to Happiness, and Vice to Mi¦sery in this World. A very wholsome and comfort¦able Doctrine, and to which we have but one Objec¦tion, namely, That it is not true.</P>
<P>Indeed if by Virtue these Writers mean, the Ex¦ercise of those Cardinal Virtues, which like good House-wives stay at home, and mind only the Busi¦ness of their own Family, I shall very readily conced the Point: For so surely do all these contribute an lead to Happiness, that I would almost wish, in Vio¦lation of all the antient and modern Sages, to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them rather by the Name of Wisdom, than by that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="121" REF="126"/>
Virtue: For with regard to this Life, no System, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onceive, was ever wiser than that of the ancient <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>picureans,</HI> who held this Wisdom to constitute the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hief Good; nor foolisher than that of their Op∣posites, those modern <HI>Epicures,</HI> who place all Fe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ity in the abundant Gratification of every sensual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppetite.</P>
<P>But if by Virtue is meant (as I almost think it ought) certain relative Quality, which is always busying self without Doors, and seems as much interested pursuing the Good of others as its own; I cannot easily agree that this is the surest way to human <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>appiness; because I am afraid we must then include <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>overty and Contempt, with all the Mischiefs which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ckbiting, Envy, and Ingratitude can bring on Man∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, in our Idea of Happiness; nay, sometimes per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ps we shall be obliged to wait upon the said Happi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss to a Goal, since many by the above Virtue have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ought themselves thither.</P>
<P>I have not now Leisure to enter upon so large a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eld of Speculation, as here seems opening upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; my Design was to wipe off a Doctrine that lay my Way; since while Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was acting the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost virtuous Part imaginable in labouring to preserve fellow Creatures from Destruction, the Devil, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e other evil Spirit, one perhaps cloathed in human <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh, was hard at Work to make him completely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>serable in the Ruin of his <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>This therefore would seem an Exception to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve Rule, if indeed it was a Rule; but as we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our Voyage through Life seen so many other Ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions to it, we chuse to dispute the Doctrine on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich it is founded, which we don't apprehend to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ristian, which we are convinced is not true, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ich is indeed destructive of one of the noblest Ar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents that Reason alone can furnish for the Belief Immortality.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>In which is opened a very black Design against</HI> Sophia.</HEAD>
<P>I Remember a wise old Gentleman, who used to say, when Children are doing nothing, they are doing Mischief. I will not enlarge this quaint Say∣ing to the most beautiful Part of the Creation in ge∣neral: but so far I may be allowed, that when the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Effects of female Jealousy do not appear openly i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their proper Colours of Rage and Fury, we may sus∣pect that mischievous Passion to be at work privately and attempting to undermine, what it doth not attack above-ground.</P>
<P>This was exemplified in the Conduct of the Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> who under all the Smiles which she wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in her Countenance, concealed much Indignation a∣gainst <HI>Sophia;</HI> and as she plainly saw that this young Lady stood between her and the full Indulgence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her Desires, she resolved to get rid of her by som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Means or other; nor was it long before a very favour¦able Opportunity of accomplishing this, presented it¦self to her.</P>
<P>The Reader may be pleased to remember, that whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Sophia</HI> was thrown into that Consternation at the Play house, by the Wit and Humour of a Set of young Gentlemen, who call themselves the Town, we inform¦ed him, that she had put herself under the Protectio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a young Nobleman, who had very safely conduct¦ed her to her Chair.</P>
<P>This Nobleman, who frequently visited Lady <HI>Bel¦laston,</HI> had more than once seen <HI>Sophia</HI> there, sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> her Arrival in Town, and had conceived a very grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> liking to her; which Liking, as Beauty never look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more amiable than in Distress, <HI>Sophia</HI> had in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="123" REF="128"/>
Fright so encreased, that he might now without any great Impropriety be said to be actually in love with her.</P>
<P>It may easily be believed that he would not suffer so handsome an Occasion of improving his Acquain∣tance with the beloved Object as now offered itself to elapse, when good-breeding alone might have prompt∣ed him to pay her a Visit.</P>
<P>The next Morning therefore, after this Accident he waited on <HI>Sophia,</HI> with the usual Compliments and Hopes that she had received no Harm from her last Night's Adventure.</P>
<P>As Love like Fire when once thoroughly kindled, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s soon blown into a Flame; <HI>Sophia</HI> in a very short Time completed her Conquest. Time now flew a∣way unperceived, and the Noble Lord had been two Hours in Company with the Lady, before it entered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto his Head that he had made too long a Visit. Tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his Circumstance alone would have alarmed <HI>Sophia,</HI> who was somewhat more a Mistress of Computa∣tion at present; she had indeed much more preg∣nant Evidence from the Eyes of her Lover of what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast within his Bosom; nay, though he did not make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny open Declaration of his Passion, yet many of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Expressions were rather too warm, and too tender <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o have been imputed to Complaisance, even in the Age when such Complaisance was in Fashion; the very Reverse of which is well known to be the reign∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng Mode at present.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> had been apprised of his Lordship's Visit at his first Arrival; and the Length of it very well satisfied her that Things went as she wished, and is indeed she had suspected the second Time she saw this young Couple together. This Business she rightly, I think, concluded, that she should by no means for∣ward by mixing in the Company while they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogether; she therefore ordered her Servants that when my Lord was going, they should tell him, she

desired to speak with him, and employed the inter∣mediate Time in meditating how best to accom∣plish a Scheme which she made no doubt but his Lord hip would very readily embrace the Execution of.</P>

assure you she is an only Child, and her Father's Estate is a good <HI>3000l.</HI> a Year.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Then I can as∣sure you, Madam,' answered the Lord, 'I think her the best Match in <HI>England.</HI>'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, my Lord,' replied she, 'if you like her, I heartily wish you had her.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'If you think so kindly of me, Ma∣dam,' said he, 'as she is a Relation of yours, will you do me the Honour to propose it to her Fa∣ther?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'And are you really then in earnest?'</Q> cries the Lady, with an affected Gravity. <Q REND="inline">'I hope, Ma∣dam,' answered he, 'you have a better Opinion of me, than to imagine I would jest with your La∣dyship in an Affair of this Kind.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed then,' said the Lady, 'I will most readily propose your Lordship to her Father, and I can, I believe, assure you of his joyful Acceptance of the Proposal; but there is a Bar, which I am almost ashamed to men∣tion, and yet it is one you will never be able to conquer. You have a Rival my Lord, and a Ri∣val who, though I blush to name him, neither you nor all the World will ever be able to conquer.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Upon my Word, Lady <HI>Bellaston,'</HI> cries he, 'you have struck a damp to my Heart which hath almost deprived me of Being.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Fie! my Lord,' said she, 'I should rather hope I had struck Fire into you. A Lover, and talk of Damps in your Heart! I rather imagined you would have asked your Ri∣vil's Name, that you might have immediately en∣tered the Lists with him.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I promise you, Madam,' answered he, 'there are very few Things I would not undertake for your charming Cousin; but pray who is this happy Man?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Why he is,' said she, 'what I am sorry to say most happy Men with us are, one of the lowest Fellows in the World. He is a Beggar, a Bastard, a Foundling, a Fellow in meaner Circumstances than one of your Lord∣ship's Footmen.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'And is it possible,' cried he,
<PB N="126" REF="131"/>
that a young Creature with such Perfections, should think of bestowing herself so unworthily?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Alas! my Lord,' answered she, 'consider the Country—the Bane of all young Women is the Country. There they learn a Set of romantic Notions of Love and I know not what Folly, which this Town and good Company can scarce eradicate in a whole Winter.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Madam,' replied my Lord, your Cousin is of too immense a Value to be thrown away: Such Ruin as this must be prevented.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Alas!' cries she, 'my Lord, how can it be prevented?'</Q> The <Q REND="inline">'Family have already done all in their Power; but the Girl is, I think, intoxicated, and nothing less than Ruin will content her. And to deal more openly with you, I expect every Day to hear she is run away with him.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'What you tell me, Lady <HI>Bellaston,'</HI> answered his Lordship, 'affects me most tenderly, and only raises my Compassion in∣stead of lessening my Adoration of your Cousin. Some Means must be found to preserve so inesti∣mable a Jewel. Hath your Ladyship endeavoured to reason with her?'</Q> Here the Lady affected a Laugh. and cried, <Q REND="inline">'My dear Lord, sure you know us better than to talk of reasoning a young Woman out of her Inclinations. These inestimable Jewels are as deaf as the Jewels they wear; Time, my Lord, Time is the only Medicine to cure their Folly; but this is a Medicine, which I am certain she will not take; nay, I live in hourly Horrors on her Account. In short nothing but violent Methods will do.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'What is to be done?' cries my Lord, 'what Methods are to be taken?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Is there any Method upon Earth?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Oh! Lady <HI>Bellaston!</HI> there is nothing which I would not undertake for such a Reward.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'I really know not,'</Q> answered the Lady, after a Pause, and then pausing again, she cried out,—<Q REND="inline">'Upon my Soul, I am at my Wit's End on this Girl's Ac∣count.—If she can be preserved, something must
<PB N="127" REF="132"/>
be done immediately, and as I say, nothing but violent Methods will do.—If your Lordship hath really this Attachment to my Cousin, (and to do her Justice, except in this silly Inclination, of which she will soon see her Folly, she is every way deserving,) I think there may be one Way, in∣deed it is a very disagreeable one, and what I am almost afraid to think of.—It requires great Spirit, I promise you.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I am not conscions, Ma∣dam,' said he, 'of any Defect there, nor am I, I hope, suspected of any such. It must be an egre∣gious Defect indeed, which could make me back∣ward on this Occasion.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Nay, my Lord,' an∣swered she, 'I am far from doubting you. I am much more inclined to doubt my own Courage: for I must run a monstrous Risque. In short, I must place such a Confidence in your Honour as a wise Woman will scarce ever place in a Man on any Consideration.'</Q> In this Point likewise my Lord very well satisfied her; for his Reputation was ex∣tremely clear, and common Fame did him no more than Justice, in speaking well of him. <Q REND="inline">'Well then,' said she, my Lord,—I—I vow, I can't bear the Apprehension of it—No, it shall not be.—At least every other Method must be tried. Can you get rid of your Engagements and dine here to∣day? Your Lordship will have an Opportunity of seeing a little more of Miss <HI>Western.—</HI>I pro∣mise you we have no time to lose.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>A further Explanation of the foregoing Design.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THO' the Reader may have long since concluded Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> to be a Member (and no in∣considerable one) of the Great World, she was in reality a very considerable Member of <HI>the Little World;</HI> by which Appellation was distinguished a very worthy and honourable Society which not long since flourished in this Kingdom.</P>
<P>Among other good Principles upon which this So∣ciety was founded, was one very remarkable; for as it was a Rule of an honourable Club of Heroes, who assembled at the close of the late War, that all the Members should every Day fight once at least; so 'twas in this, that every Member should, within the twenty four Hours, tell at least one merry Fib, which was to be propagated by all the Brethren and Sister∣hood.</P>
<P>Many idle Stories were told about this Society, which from a certain Quality may be perhaps not unjustly supposed to have come from the Society them∣selves. As, that the Devil was the President, and that he sat in Person in an elbow Chair at the upper End of the Table; but upon very strict Enquiry, I find there is not the least Truth in any of those Tales, and that the Assembly consisted in reality of a Set of very good sort of People, and the Fibs which they propagated were of a harmless Kind, and tended only to produce Mirth and good Humour.</P>
<P><HI>Edwards</HI> was likewise a Member of this comical Society. To him therefore Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> applied as a proper Instrument for her Purpose, and furnished him with a Fib, which he was to vent whenever the Lady gave him her Cue; and this was not to be till
<PB N="139" REF="134"/>
the Evening when all the Company but Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> and himself were gone, and while they were engaged in a Rubbers at Whist.</P>
<P>To this Time then, which was between seven and eight in the Evening, we will convey our Reader; when Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> Lord <HI>Fellamar,</HI> Miss <HI>Western,</HI> and <HI>Tom</HI> being engaged at Whist, and in the last Game of their Rubbers, <HI>Tom</HI> received his Cue from Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> which was, I protest <HI>Tom,</HI> you are grown intolerable lately; you used to tell us all the News of the Town, and now you know no more of the World than if you lived out of it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> then began as follows: <Q REND="inline">'The Fault is not mine, Madam; It lies in the Dulness of the Age that doth nothing worth talking Of—O la! tho' now I think on't, there hath a terrible Accident be∣fallen poor Col. <HI>Wilcox.—</HI>Poor <HI>Ned—</HI>You know him my Lord, every body knows him; faith! I am very much concerned for him.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'What is it, pray?'</Q> says Lady <HI>Bellaston.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Why, he hath killed a Man this Morning in a Duel, that's all.'</Q></P>
<P>His Lordship, who was not in the Secret, asked gravely, whom he had killed; to which <HI>Edwards</HI> an∣swered, <Q REND="inline">'A young Fellow we none of us know; a <HI>Somersetshire</HI> Lad just come to town, one <HI>Jones</HI> his Name is; a near Relation of one Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> of whom your Lordship I believe hath heard. I saw the Lad lie dead in a Coffee-house.—Upon my Soul he is one of the finest Corpses I ever saw in my Life.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sophia,</HI> who just began to deal as <HI>Tom</HI> had menti∣oned that a Man was killed, stopt her Hand, and lis∣tened with Attention, (for all Stories of that Kind affected her) but no sooner had he arrived at the latter part of the Story, than she began to deal again; and having dealt three Cards to one, and seven to another,
<PB N="130" REF="135"/>
and ten to a third, at last dropt the rest from her Hand, and fell back in her Chair.</P>
<P>The Company behaved as usually on these Occa∣sions. The usual Disturbance ensued, the usual As∣sistance was summoned, and <HI>Sophia</HI> at last, as it is u∣sual, returned again to Life, and was soon after, at her earnest Desire, led to her own Apartment; where, at my Lord's Request, Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> acquainted her with the Truth, attempted to carry it off as a Jest of her own, and comforted her with repeated Assurances, that neither his Lordship, nor <HI>Tom,</HI> though she had taught him the Story, were in the true Secret of the Affair.</P>
<P>There was no farther Evidence necessary to con∣vince Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> how justly the Case had been re∣presented to him by Lady <HI>Bellaston;</HI> and now at her Return into the Room, a Scheme was laid between those two noble Persons, which, though it appeared in no very heinous Light to his Lordship, (as he faithfully promised, and faithfully resolved too, to make the Lady all the subsequent amends in his Power by Marriage;) yet many of our Readers, we doubt not, will see with just Detestation.</P>
<P>The next Evening at seven was appointed for the fatal Purpose, when Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> undertook that <HI>Sophia</HI> should be alone, and his Lordship should be in∣troduced to her. The whole Family were to be regu∣lated for the Purpose, most of the Servants dispatched out of the House, and for Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> who, to pre∣vent any suspicion, was to be left with her Mistress till his Lordship's Arrival, Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> herself was to engage her in an Apartment as distant as possible from the Scene of the intended Mischief, and out of the Hearing of <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>Matters being thus agreed on, his Lordship took his Leave, and her Ladyship retired to Rest, highly pleased with a Project of which she had no reason to doubt the Success, and which promised so effectually
<PB N="131" REF="136"/>
to remove <HI>Sophia</HI> from being any future Obstruction to her Amour with <HI>Jones,</HI> by a Means of which she should never appear to be guilty, even if the Fact appeared to the World; but this she made no doubt of prevent∣ing by huddling up a Marriage, to which she thought the ravished <HI>Sophia</HI> would easily be brought to consent, and at which all the rest of her Family would rejoice.</P>
<P>But Affairs were not in so quiet a Situation in the Bosom of the other Conspirator. His Mind was tost in all the distracting Anxiety so nobly described by <HI>Shakespear.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Between the Acting of a dreadful Thing,</L>
<L>And the first Motion, all the Interim is</L>
<L>Like a Phantasma, or a hideous Dream:</L>
<L>The Genius and the mortal Instruments</L>
<L>Are then in Council; and the State of Man,</L>
<L>Like to a little Kingdom, suffers then</L>
<L>The Nature of an Insurrection.—</L></Q>
<P>Though the Violence of his Passion had made him eagerly embrace the first Hint of this Design, especi∣ally as it came from a Relation of the Lady, yet when that Friend to Reflection, a Pillow, had placed the Action itself in all its natural black Colours before his Eyes, with all the Consequences which must, and those which might probably attend it; his Resolution began to abate, or rather indeed to go over to the o∣ther Side; and after a long Conflict which lasted a whole Night between Honour and Appetite, the former at length prevailed, and he determined to wait on Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> and to relinquish the Design.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> was in Bed, though very late in the Morning, and <HI>Sophia</HI> sitting by her Bedside, when the Servant acquainted her that Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> was be∣low in the Parlour, upon which her Ladyship desired him to stay, and that she would see him presently; but the Servant was no sooner departed than poor
<PB N="132" REF="137"/>
<HI>Sophia</HI> began to intreat her Cousin not to encourage the Visits of that odious Lord (so she called him though a little unjustly) upon her Account. <Q REND="inline">'I see his De∣sign,' said she, 'for he made downright Love to me Yesterday Morning; but as I am resolved never to admit it, I beg your Ladyship not to leave us a∣lone together any more, and to order the Servants that if he enquires for me I may be always denied to him.'</Q></P>
<P>'La! Child,' says Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'you Country Girls have nothing but Sweet-Hearts in your Head; you fancy every Man who is civil to you is mak∣ing Love. He is one of the most gallant young Fellows about Town, and I am convinced means no more than a little Gallantry. Make Love to you indeed! I wish with all my Heart he would, and you must be an arrant mad Woman to refuse him.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'But as I shall certainly be that mad Woman,' cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'I hope his Visits shall not be intruded on me.'</Q></P>
<P>'O Child,' said Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'you need not be so fearful, if you resolve to run away with that <HI>Jones,</HI> I know no Person who can hinder you.'</Q></P>
<P>'Upon my Honour, Madam,' cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'your Ladyship injures me. I will never run away with any Man; nor will I ever marry contrary to my Fa∣ther's Inclinations.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Well Miss <HI>Western,'</HI> said the Lady, 'if you are not in a Humour to see Company this Morning, you may retire to your own Apartment; for I am not frightned at his Lordship, and must send for him up into my Dressing-Room.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> thanked her Ladyship and withdrew; and presently afterwards <HI>Fellamar</HI> was admitted up Stairs.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>By which it will appear how dangerous an Advocate a Lady is, when she applies her Eloquence to an ill Purpose.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> heard the young Lord's Scruples, she treated them with the same Dis∣dain with which one of those Sages of the Law, called <HI>Newgate</HI> Solicitors, treats the Qualms of Con∣science in a young Witness. <Q REND="inline">'My dear Lord,' said she, 'you certainly want a Cordial. I must send to Lady <HI>Edgely</HI> for one of her best Drams. Fie up∣on it! have more Resolution. Are you frightned by the Word Rape? Or are you apprehensive—? Well, if the Story of <HI>Helen</HI> was modern, I should think it unnatural. I mean the Behaviour of <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> not the Fondness of the Lady; for all Women love a Man of Spirit. There is another Story of the <HI>Sabine</HI> Ladies,—and that too, I thank Heaven, is very ancient. Your Lordship, perhaps, will admire my Reading; but I think Mr. <HI>Hook</HI> tells us they made tolerable good Wives afterwards. I fancy few of my married Acquaintance were ra∣vished by their Husbands.' 'Nay, dear Lady <HI>Bel∣laston,'</HI> cried he, 'don't ridicule me in this Man∣ner. 'Why, my good Lord,' answered she, do you think any Woman in <HI>England</HI> would not laugh at you in her Heart whatever Prudery she might wear in her Countenance?—You force me to use a strange Kind of Language, and to be∣tray my Sex most abominably: But I am content∣ed with knowing my Intentions are good, and that I am endeavouring to serve my Cousin; for I think you will make her a Husband notwithstanding this; or, upon my Soul, I would not even persuade her to fling herself away upon an empty Title. She should not upbraid me hereafter with having lost a Man
<PB N="134" REF="139"/>
of Spirit? for that his Enemies allow this poor young Fellow to be.'</Q></P>
<P>Let those who have had the Satisfaction of hear∣ing Reflections of this Kind from a Wife or a Mis∣trss, declare whether they are at all sweetened by coming from a Female Tongue. Certain it is they sunk deeper into his Lordship, than any Thing which <HI>Demosthenes</HI> or <HI>Cicero</HI> could have said on the Occasi∣on.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> perceiving she had fired the young Lord's Pride, began now, like a true Orator, to rouse other Passions to its Assistance. <Q REND="inline">'My Lord,' said she, in a graver Voice, 'you will be pleased to remember you mentioned this Matter to me first; for I would not appear to you in the Light of one who is endeavouring to put off my Cousin upon you. Fourscore thousand Pounds do not stand in Need of an Advocate to recommend them. Nor doth Miss <HI>Western,'</HI> said he, 'require any Recommendation from her Fortune; for in my Opinion, no Woman ever had half her Charms.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Yes, yes, my Lord;' replied the Lady, looking in the Glass, 'there have been Women with more than half her Charms, I assure you; not that I need lessen her on that Ac∣count. She is a most delicious Girl, that's certain; and within these few Hours she will be in the Arms of one, who surely doth not deserve her, tho' I will give him his due, I believe he is truly a Man of Spirit.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I hope so, Madam,' said my Lord; 'though I must own he doth not deserve her; for unless Hea∣ven, or your Ladyship disappoint me, she shall within that Time be in mine.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Well spoken, my Lord,' answered the Lady. 'I promise you no Disappointment shall happen from my Side; and within this Week I am convinced I shall call your Lordship my Cousin in Public.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="140"/>
The Remainder of this Scene consisted entirely of Raptures, Excuses, and Compliments, very pleasant to have heard from the Parties; but rather dull when related at second Hand. Here, therefore, we shall put an End to this Dialogue, and hasten to the fatal Hour, when every Thing was prepared for the De∣struction of poor <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>But this being the most tragical Matter in our whole History, we shall treat it in a Chapter by itself.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>Containing some Matters which may affect, and others which may surprize the Reader.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Clock had now struck Seven and poor <HI>So∣phia,</HI> alone and melancholy, sat reading a Tra∣gedy. It was the <HI>Fatal Marriage,</HI> and she was now come to that Part where the poor, distrest <HI>Isabella</HI> disposes of her Wedding-Ring.</P>
<P>Here the Book dropt from her Hand, and a Show∣er of Tears ran down into her Bosom. In this Si∣tuation she had continued a Minute, when the Door opened, and in came Lord <HI>Fellamar. Sophia</HI> started from her Chair at his Entrance; and his Lordship advancing forwards, and making a low Bow said, <Q REND="inline">'I am afraid, Miss <HI>Western,</HI> I break in upon you abruptly.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed my Lord,' says she, 'I must own myself a little surprized at this unexpected Vi∣sit.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'If this Visit be unexpected, Madam,' an∣swered Lord <HI>Fellamar,</HI> 'my Eyes must have been very faithless Interpreters of my Heart, when last I had the Honour of seeing you: For surely you could not otherwise have hoped to detain my Heart in your Possession, without receiving a Visit from its Owner.'</Q> <HI>Sophia,</HI> confus'd as she was, answer∣ed this Bombast (and very properly, I think,) with a Look of inconceivable Disdain. My Lord then made another and a longer Speech of the same Sort. Upon
<PB N="136" REF="141"/>
which <HI>Sophia,</HI> trembling, said, <Q REND="inline">'Am I really to con∣ceive your Lordship to be out of your Senses? Sure, my Lord, there is no other Excuse for such Behaviour'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'I am, indeed, Madam, in the Si∣tuation you suppose,' cries his Lordship; 'and sure you will pardon the Effects of a Frenzy which you yourself have occasioned: For Love hath so totally deprived me of Reason, that I am scarce ac∣countable for any of my Actions.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Upon my Word, my Lord,' said <HI>Sophia,</HI> I neither under∣stand your Words nor your Behaviour.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Suf∣fer me then, Madam,!' cries he, 'at your Feet to explain both, by laying open my Soul to you, and declaring that I doat on you to the highest Degree of Distraction. O most adorable, most divine Crea∣ture! what Language can express the Sentiments of my Heart?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I do assure you, my Lord,' said <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'I shall not stay to hear any more of this.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Do not,' cries he, 'think of leaving me thus cruel∣ly: could you know half the Torments which I feel, that tender Bosom must Pity what those Eyes have caused.'</Q> Then fetching a deep Sigh, and lay∣ing hold of her Hand, he ran on for some Minutes in a Strain which would be a little more pleasing to the Reader, than it was to the Lady; and at last con∣cluded with a Declaration, <Q REND="inline">'That if he was Master of the World, he would lay it at her Feet.'</Q> <HI>Sophia</HI> then forcibly pulling away her Hand from his, an∣swered, with much Spirit, <Q REND="inline">'I promise you, Sir, your World and its Master, I should spurn from me with equal Contempt.'</Q> She then offered to go, and Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> again laying Hold of her Hand, said, <Q REND="inline">'Par∣don me, my beloved Angel, Freedoms which no∣thing but Despair could have tempted me take.—Believe me, could I have had any Hope that my Title and Fortune, neither of them inconsiderable, unless when compared with your Worth, would

have been accepted, I had, in the humblest Man∣ner, presented them to your Acceptance.—But I cannot lose you.—by Heaven, I will sooner part with my Soul.—You are, you must, you shall be only mine.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'My Lord,' said she, 'I intreat you to desist from a vain Pursuit; for, upon my Honour, I will never hear you on this Subject. Let go my Hand, my Lord, for I am resolved to go from you this Moment, nor will I ever see you more.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Then, Madam,' cries his Lordship, 'I must make the best Use of this Moment; for I can∣not, nor will live without you.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'What do you mean, my Lord?' said <HI>Sophia;</HI> 'I will raise the Family.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I have no Fear Madam,' answered he, 'but of losing you, and that I am resolved to prevent, the only Way which Despair points to me.'</Q>—He then caught her in his Arms; upon which she screamed so loud, that she must have alarmed some one to her Assistance, had not Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> taken Care to remove all Ears. But a more lucky Circumstance happened for poor <HI>Sophia;</HI> ano∣ther Noise now broke forth, which almost drowned her Cries: For now the whole House rung with Where is she? D—n me, I'll unkennel her this In∣stant. Shew me her Chamber I say. Where is my Daughter, I know she's in the House, and I'll see her if she's above Ground. Shew me where she is.'—At which last Words the Door flew open, and in came Squire <HI>Western</HI> with his Parson, and a set of Myrmidons at his Heels.</P>
<P>How miserable must have been the Condition of poor <HI>Sophia,</HI> when the enraged Voice of her Father was welcome to her Ears? Welcome indeed it was, and did he luckily come; for it was the only Accident <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon Earth, which could have preserved the Peace of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Mind from being for ever destroyed.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia,</HI> notwithstanding her Fright, presently knew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Father's Voice; and his Lordship notwithstand∣ing
<PB N="138" REF="143"/>
his Passion, knew the Voice of Reason, which peremptorily assured him, it was not now a Time for the Perpetration of his Villainy. Hearing, there∣fore, the Voice approach, and hearing likewise whose it was; (for as the Squire more than once roared forth the Word Daughter, so <HI>Sophia,</HI> in the Midst of her Struggling, cried out upon her Father;) he thought proper to relinquish his Prey, having only disordered her Handkerchief, and with his rude Lips committed Violence on her lovely Neck.</P>
<P>If the Reader's Imagination doth not assist me, I shall never be able to describe the Situation of these two Persons when <HI>Western</HI> came into the Room. <HI>So∣phia</HI> tottered into a Chair, where she sat disordered, pale, breathless, bursting with Indignation at Lord <HI>Fellamar;</HI> affrighted, and yet more rejoiced at the Arrival of her Father.</P>
<P>His Lordship sat down near her, with the Bag of his Wig hanging over one of his Shoulders, the rest of his Dress being somewhat disordered, and rather a greater Proportion of Linnen than is usual appear∣ing at his Bosom. As to the rest, he was amazed, affrighted, vexed, and ashamed.</P>
<P>As to Squire <HI>Western,</HI> he happened, at this Time, to be overtaken by an Enemy, which very frequent∣ly pursues, and seldom fails to overtake most of the Country Gentlemen in this Kingdom. He was lite∣rally speaking drunk; which Circumstance, together with his natural Impetuosity, could produce no other Effect, than his running immediately up to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Daughter, upon whom he fell foul with his Tongue in the most inveterate Manner; nay, he had proba¦bly committed Violence with his Hands, had not the Parson interposed, saying, <Q REND="inline">'For Heaven's Sake, Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> animadvert that you are in the House of a great Lady.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y what Means the Squire came to discover his Daugh∣ter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Reader in many Histories is o∣bliged to digest much more unaccountable Ap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arances than this of Mr. <HI>Western,</HI> without any Sa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sfaction at all; yet as we dearly love to oblige him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>henever it is in our Power, we shall now proceed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shew by what Method the Squire discovered where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Daughter was.</P>
<P>In the third Chapter then of the preceding Book, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e gave a Hint (for it is not our Custom to unfold at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Time more than is necessary for the Occasion) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> who was very desirous of re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nciling herself to her Uncle and Aunt <HI>Western,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought she had a probable Opportunity by the Service <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> preserving <HI>Sophia</HI> from committing the same Crime <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich had drawn on herself the Anger of her Family.
<PB N="144" REF="149"/>
After much Deliberation therefore she resolved to in∣form her Aunt <HI>Western</HI> where her Cousin was, and accordingly she writ the following Letter, which we shall give the Reader at length for more Reasons than one.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The Occasion of my writing this will perhaps make a Letter of mine agreeable to my dear Aunt, for the Sake of one of her Neices, though I have little Reason to hope it will be so on the account of another.</P>
<P>Without more Apology, as I was coming to throw my unhappy Self at your Feet, I met, by the strangest Accident in the World, my Cousin <HI>Sophy,</HI> whose History you are better acquainted with than myself, though, alas! I know infinitely too much; enough indeed to satisfy me, that unless she is im∣mediately prevented, she is in Danger of running into the same fatal Mischief, which, by foolishly and ignorantly refusing your most wise and prudent Advice, I have unfortunately brought on myself.</P>
<P>I short, I have seen the Man, nay, I was most part of Yesterday in his Company, and a charm∣ing young Fellow I promise you he is. By what Accident he came acquainted with me is too tedious to tell you now; but I have this Morning chang∣ed my Lodging to avoid him, lest he should by my Means discover my Cousin; for he doth not yet know where she is, and it is adviseable he should not till my Uncle hath secured her.—No Time therefore is to be lost, and I need only inform you, that she is now with Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> whom I have seen, and who hath, I find a Design to conceal her from her Family. You know, Madam, she is a strange Woman; but nothing could misbecome me more, than to presume to give any Hint to one of your great Understanding and great Knowledge of the World, besides barely informing you of the Matter of Fact.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="150"/>
I hope, Madam, the Care which I have shewn on this Occasion for the good of my Family, will recommend me again to the Favour of a Lady who hath always exerted so much Zeal for the Honour and true Interest of us all; and that it may be a Means of restoring me to your Friendship, which hath made so great a Part of my former, and is so necessary to my future Happiness. I am,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> was now at her Brother's House, where she had resided ever since the Flight of <HI>Sophia,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> order to administer Comfort to the poor Squire in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Affliction. Of this Comfort which she doled out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> him in daily Portions, we have formerly given a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pecimen.</P>
<P>She was now standing with her Back to the Fire, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad with a Pinch of Snuff in her Hand was dealing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth this daily Allowance of Comfort to the Squire while he smoaked his Afternoon Pipe, when she re∣ceived the above Letter; which she had no sooner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad than she delivered it to him, saying, <Q REND="inline">'There, Sir, there is an Account of your lost Sheep. For∣tune hath again restored her to you, and if you will be governed by my Advice, it is possible you may preserve her yet.'</Q></P>
<P>The Squire had no sooner read the Letter than he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aped from his Chair, threw his Pipe into the Fire; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d gave a loud Huzza for Joy. He then summoned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Servants, called for his Boots, and ordered the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evalier and several other Horses to be saddled, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at Parson <HI>Supple</HI> should be immediately sent for.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="151"/>
Having done this, he turned to his Sister, caught her in his Arms, and gave her a close Embrace, saying, <Q REND="inline">'Zounds! you don't seem pleased, one would ima∣gine you was sorry I have found the Girl.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Brother, answered she, the deepest Politicians who see to the Bottom discover often a very diffe∣rent Aspect of Affairs, from what swims on the Surface. It is true indeed, Things do look rather less desperate than they did formerly in <HI>Holland,</HI> when <HI>Lewis</HI> the fourteenth was at the Gates of <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> but there is a Delicacy required in this Matter, which you will pardon me, Brother, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> suspect you want. There is a Decorum to he used with a Woman of Figure, such as Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> Brother, which requires a Knowledge of the World superior, I am afraid, to yours.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Sister, cries the Squire, I know you have no Opinion of my Parts; but I'll shew you on this Occasion who is Fool. Knowledge quotha! I have not been in the Country so long without having some Knowledge of Warrants and the Law of the Land. I know I may take my own wherever can find it. Shew me my own Daughter, and if don't know how to come at her, I'll suffer you to call me Fool as long as I live.

you are admitted to her Presence, as you certainly will be, and have told her your Story, and have made proper Use of my Name, (for I think you only just know one another by Sight, though you are Relations,) I am confident she will withdraw her Protection from my Niece, who hath certainly imposed upon her. This is the only Method.—Justices of the Peace indeed! do you imagine any such Event can arrive to a Woman of Figure in a civilized Nation?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'D—n their Figures, cries the Squire; a pretty ci∣vilized Nation truly, where Women are above the Law. And what must I stand sending a Parcel of Compliments to a confounded Whore, that keeps away a Daughter from her own natural Father? I tell you, Sister, I am not so ignorant as you think me.—I know you would have Women above the Law, but it is all a Lie; I heard his Lordship say at 'Size, that no one is above the Law.

<P><Q REND="inline">'Mr. <HI>Western,</HI> answered the Lady, you may say what you please, <HI>Je vous mesprise de tout mon Coeur.</HI> I shall not therefore be angry.—Besides, as my Cousin with that odious <HI>Irish</HI> Name justly says, I have that Regard for the Honour and true Interest of my Family, and that concern for my Niece, who is a part of it, that I have resolved to go to Town myself upon this Occasion; for indeed, indeed,

Brother, you are not a fit Minister to be employed at a polite Court.<HI>—Greenland</HI><HI>—Greenland</HI> should always be the Scene of the Tramontane Negotia∣tion.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I thank Heaven, cries the Squire, I don't under∣stand you, now. You are got to your <HI>Hannoverian</HI> Linguo. However, I'll shew you I scorn to be be∣hind-hand in Civility with you; and as you are not angry for what I have said, so I am not angry for what you have said. Indeed I have always thought it a Folly for Relations to quarrel; and if they do now and then give a hasty Word, why People should give and take; for my Part I never bear Malice▪ and I take it very kind of you to go up to <HI>London,</HI> for I never was there but twice in my Life, and then I did not stay above a Fortnight at a Time; and to be sure I can't be expected to know much of the Streets and the Folks in that Time. I never de∣nied that you known'd all these Matters better than I.

<P>Here then a League was struck (to borrow a Phras<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the Lady) between the contending Parties; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now the Parson arriving, and the Horses being ready the Squire departed, having promised his Sister to fol¦low her Advice, and she prepared to follow him th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> next Day.</P>
<P>But having communicated these Matters to the Par¦son on the Road, they both agreed that the prescribe Formalities might very well be dispensed with; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Squire having changed his Mind, proceeded in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Manner we have already seen.</P>

<PB N="151" REF="156"/>
dear Lady, she can't dissemble; and if two People who loves one another a'n't happy, why who should be so? Happiness don't always depend upon what People has; besides, my Lady has enough for both. To be sure therefore as one may say, it would be all the Pity in the World to keep two such Loviers asunder; nay, I am convinced for my Part, you will meet together at last; for if it is to be, there is no preventing it. If a Marriage is made in Heaven, all the Justices of Peace upon Earth can't break it off. To be sure I wishes that Parson <HI>Supple</HI> had but a little more Spirit to tell the Squire of his Wickedness in endeavouring to force his Daughter contrary to her Liking; but then his whole Depen∣dance is on the Squire, and so the poor Gentleman, though he is a very religious good sort of Man, and talks of the Badness of such Doings behind the Squire's Back, yet he dares not say his Soul is his own to his Face. To be sure I never saw him make so bold as just now, I was afeard the Squire would have struck him.—I would not have your Honour be melancholy, Sir, nor dispair; Things may go better, as long as you are sure of my Lady, and that I am certain you may be, for she never will be brought to consent to marry any other Man. In∣deed, I am terribly afeard the Squire will do her a Mischief in his Passion: For he is a prodigious passionate Gentleman, and I am afeard too the poor Lady will be brought to break her Heart, for she is as tender-hearted as a Chicken; it is pity methinks, she had not a little of my Courage. If I was in Love with a young Man, and my Father offered to lock me up, I'd tear his Eyes out, but I'd come at him; but then there's a great Fortune in the Case, which it is in her Father's Power either to give her, or not; that, to be sure, may make some Difference.'</Q></P>
<P>Whether <HI>Jones</HI> gave strict Attention to all the fore∣going Harangue, or whether it was for want of any
<PB N="152" REF="157"/>
Vacancy in the Discourse, I cannot determine; but he never once attempted to answer, nor did she once stop, till <HI>Partridge</HI> came running into the Room, and informed him that the great Lady was upon the Stairs.</P>
<P>Nothing could equal the Dilemma to which <HI>Jones</HI> was now reduced. <HI>Honour</HI> knew nothing of any Ac∣quaintance that subsisted between him and Lady <HI>Bel∣laston,</HI> and she was almost the last Person in the World to whom he would have communicated it. In this Hurry and Distress, he took (as is common enough) the worst Course, and instead of exposing her to the Lady, which would have been of little Consequence, he chose to expose the Lady to her; he therefore re∣solved to hide <HI>Honour,</HI> whom he had but just time to convey behind the Bed, and to draw the Curtains.</P>
<P>The Hurry in which <HI>Jones</HI> had been all Day en∣gaged on Account of his poor Landlady and her Fa∣mily, the Terrors occasioned by Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> and the Confusion into which he was thrown by the sud∣den Arrival of Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> had altogether driven former Thoughts out of his Head; so that it never once occurr'd to his Memory to act the Part of a sick Man; which indeed, neither the Gayety of his Dress, nor the Freshness of his Countenance would have at all supported.</P>
<P>He received her Ladyship therefore rather agreea∣bly to her Desires than to her Expectations, with all the good Humour he could muster in his Countenance, and without any real or affected Appearance of the least Disorder.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> no sooner entered the Room, than she squatted herself down on the Bed: <Q REND="inline">'So, my dear <HI>Jones,'</HI> said she, you find nothing can detain me long from you. Perhaps I ought to be angry with you, that I have neither seen nor heard from you all Day; for I perceive your Distemper would have suffered you to come abroad; Nay, I suppose you have not sat in your Chamber all Day drest up
<PB N="153" REF="158"/>
like a fine Lady to see Company after a Lying-in; but however, don't think I intend to scold you: For I never will give you an Excuse for the cold Behaviour of a Husband, by putting on the ill Hu∣mour of a Wife.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Nay, Lady <HI>Bellaston,'</HI> said <HI>Jones,</HI> 'I am sure your Ladyship will not upbraid me with neglect of Duty, when I only waited for Orders. Who, my dear Creature, hath Reason to complain? Who missed an Appointment last Night, and left an un∣happy Man to expect, and wish, and sigh, and lan∣guish?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Do not mention it, my dear Mr. <HI>Jones,'</HI> cries she. 'If you knew the Occasion, you would pity me. In short, it is impossible to conceive what Women of Condition are obliged to suffer from the Impertinence of Fools, in order to keep up the Farce of the World. I am glad however, all your languishing and wishing have done you no harm: for you never looked better in your Life. Upon my Faith! <HI>Jones,</HI> you might at this Instant sit for the Picture of <HI>Adonis.'</HI></Q></P>
<P>There are certain Words of Provocation which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en of Honour hold can only properly be answered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y a Blow. Among Lovers possibly there may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome Expressions which can only be answered by a Kiss. The Compliment which Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> now made <HI>Jones</HI> seems to be of this Kind, especially as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was attended with a Look in which the Lady con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eyed more soft Ideas than it was possible to express with her Tongue.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> was certainly at this Instant in one of the most disagreeable and distrest situations imaginable; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or to carry on the Comparison we made use of be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore, tho' the Provocation was given by the Lady, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ones</HI> could not receive Satisfaction, nor so much as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffer to ask it, in the Presence of a third Person; Se∣conds in this kind of Duels not being according to
<PB N="154" REF="159"/>
the Law of Arms. As this Objection did not occur to Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> who was ignorant of any other Woman being there but herself, she waited some time in great Astonishment for an Answer from <HI>Jones,</HI> who conscious of the ridiculous Figure he made, stood at a Distance, and not daring to give the pro∣per Answer, gave none at all. Nothing can be ima∣gined more comic, nor yet more tragical than this Scene would have been, if it had lasted much longer. The Lady had already changed Colour two or three times; had got up from the Bed and sat down again, while <HI>Jones</HI> was wishing the Ground to sink under him, or the House to fall on his Head, when an odd Accident freed him from an Embarassment out of which neither the Eloquence of <HI>Cicero,</HI> nor the Po∣liticks of a <HI>Machiavel</HI> could have delivered him, with∣out utter Disgrace.</P>
<P>This was no other than the Arrival of young <HI>Nightingale</HI> dead drunk; or rather in that State of Drunkenness which deprives Men of the Use of their Reason, without depriving them of the Use of their Limbs.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> and her Daughters were in Bed, and <HI>Partridge</HI> was smoaking his Pipe by the Kitchen Fire; so that he arrived at Mr. <HI>Jones'</HI>s Chamber Door with¦out any Interruption. This he burst open, and was entering without any Ceremony, when <HI>Jones</HI> started from his Seat, and ran to oppose him; which he did so effectually, that <HI>Nightingale</HI> never came far enough within the Door to see who was sitting on the Bed.</P>
<P><HI>Nightingale</HI> had in Reality mistaken <HI>Jones'</HI>s Apart¦ment for that in which himself had lodged; he there¦fore strongly insisted on coming in, often swearing that he would not be kept from his own Bed. <HI>Jones</HI> however, prevailed over him, and delivered him in to the Hands of <HI>Partridge,</HI> whom the Noise on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Stairs soon summoned to his Master's Assistance.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="160"/>
And now <HI>Jones</HI> was unwillingly obliged to return to his own Apartment, where at the very Instant of his Entrance he heard Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> venting an Excla∣mation, though not a very loud one; and at the same time, saw her flinging herself into a Chair in a vast Agitation, which in a Lady of a tender Constitution would have been an Hysteric Fit.</P>
<P>In reality the Lady, frightened with the Struggle between the two Men, of which she did not know what would be the Issue, as she heard <HI>Nightingale</HI> swear many Oaths he would come to his own Bed, attempted to retire to her known Place of Hiding, which to her great Confusion she found already oc∣cupied by another.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Is this Usage to be borne, Mr. <HI>Jones?'</HI> cries the Lady, '—basest of Men!—What Wretch is this to whom you have exposed me?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Wretch!' cries <HI>Honour,</HI> bursting in a violent Rage from her Place of Concealment—'marry come up!—'Wretch forsooth!—As poor a Wretch as I am, I am honest, that is more than some Folks who are richer can say.'</Q> <HI>Jones,</HI> instead of applying himself directly to take off the Edge of Mrs. <HI>Honour'</HI>s Resentment, as a more experienced Gallant would have done, fell to cursing his Stars, and lamenting himself as the most unfor∣tunate Man in the World; and presently after, addres∣ing himself to Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> he fell to some very absurd Protestations of Innocence. By this time the Lady having recovered the Use of her Reason, which he had as ready as any Woman in the World, espe∣cially on such Occasions, calmly replied; <Q REND="inline">'Sir, you need make no Apologies, I see now who the Per∣son is; I did not at first know Mrs. <HI>Honour;</HI> but now I do, I can suspect nothing wrong between her and you; and I am sure she is a Woman of too good Sense to put any wrong Constructions up∣on my Visits to you; I have been always her Friend,
<PB N="156" REF="161"/>
and it may be in my Power to be much more so hereafter.'</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> was altogether as placable, as she was passionate. Hearing therefore Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> assume the soft Tone, she likewise softened her's. —'I'm sure, Madam,' said she, <Q REND="inline">'I have been always ready to acknowledge your Ladyship's Friendships to me; sure I never had so good a Friend as your Ladyship—and to be sure now I see it is your Ladyship that I spoke to, I could almost bite my Tongue off for very mad.—I Constructions upon your Ladyship—to be sure it doth not be∣come a Servant as I am to think about such a great Lady—I mean I was a Servant: for indeed I am no Body's Servant now, the more miserable Wretch is me.—I have lost the best Mistress.'</Q>—Here <HI>Honour</HI> thought fit to produce a Shower of Tears. —'<Q REND="inline">'Don't cry, Child.' says the good Lady, 'Ways perhaps my be found to make you amends. Come to me to-morrow Morning.'</Q> She then took up her Fan which lay on the Ground, and without even looking at <HI>Jones,</HI> walked very majestically out of the Room; there being a kind of Dignity in the Impu∣dence of Women of Quality, which their Inferiors vainly aspire to attain to in Circumstances of this Na∣ture.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> followed her down Stairs, often offering her his Hand, which she absolutely refused him, and go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into her Chair without taking any Notice of him as he stood bowing before her.</P>
<P>At his Return up Stairs, a long Dialogue past be∣tween him and Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> while she was adjusting herself after the Discomposure she had undergone. The Subject of this was his Infidelity to her young Lady; on which she enlarged with great Bitterness but <HI>Jones</HI> at last found means to reconcile her, and not only so, but to obtain a Promise of most inviolable Secrecy, and that she would the next Morning en∣deavour
<PB N="157" REF="162"/>
to find out <HI>Sophia,</HI> and bring him a further Account of the Proceedings of the Squire.</P>
<P>Thus ended this unfortunate Adventure to the Sa∣tisfaction only of Mrs. <HI>Honour;</HI> for a Secret (as some of my Readers will perhaps acknowledge from Experience) is often a very valuable Possession; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat not only to those who faithfully keep it, but some∣times to such as whisper it about till it comes to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Ears of every one, except the ignorant Person, who pays for the supposed concealing of what is pub∣lickly known.</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all the Obligations she had received from <HI>Jones,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot forbear in the Morning some gentle Remonstrances for the Hurricain which had happened the preceding Night in his Chamber. These were however so gen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le and so friendly; professing, and indeed truly, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im at nothing more than the real good of Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> himself, that he far from being offended, thankfully <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eceived the Admonition of the good Woman, ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ressed much Concern for what had past, excused it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s well as he could, and promised never more to bring he same Disturbances into the House.</P>
<P>But though Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> did not refrain from a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hort Expostulation in private at their first meeting, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et the Occasion of his being summoned down Stairs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat Morning was of a much more agreeable Kind; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing indeed to perform the Office of a Father to Miss <HI>Nancy,</HI> and to give her in Wedlock to Mr, <HI>Night∣ingale,</HI> who was now ready drest, and full as sober <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s many of my Readers will think a Man ought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e who receives a Wife in so imprudent a Man∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="163"/>
And here perhaps it may be proper to account for the Escape which this young Gentleman had made from his Uncle, and for his Appearance in the Con∣dition in which we have seen him the Night before.</P>
<P>Now when the Uncle had arrived at his Lodgings with his Nephew, partly to indulge his own Inclina∣tions (for he dearly loved his Bottle) and partly to disqualify his Nephew from the immediate Execu∣tion of his Purpose, he ordered Wine to be set on the Table; with which he so briskly ply'd the young Gentleman; that this latter, who though not much used to Drinking, did not detest it so as to be guilty of Disobedience or of want of Complaisance by re∣fusing, was soon completely finished.</P>
<P>Just as the Uncle had obtained this Victory, and was preparing a Bed for his Nephew, a Messenger arrived with a Piece of News, which so entirely dis∣concerted and shocked him, that he in a Moment lost all Consideration for his Nephew, and his whole Mind became entirely taken up with his own Con∣cerns.</P>
<P>This sudden and afflicting News was no less than that his Daughter had taken the Opportunity of al∣most the first Moment of his Absence, and had gone off with a Neighbouring young Clergyman; against whom tho' her Father could have had but one Ob∣jection, namely, that he was worth nothing, yet she had never thought proper to communicate her Amoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> even to that Father; and so artfully she managed, that it had never been once suspected by any, till now that it was consummated.</P>
<P>Old Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> no sooner received this Ac∣count, than in the utmost Confusion he ordered a Post-Chaise to be instantly got ready, and having re∣commended his Nephew to the Care of a Servant, he directly left the House, scarce knowing what he did, nor whither he went.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="164"/>
The Uncle being thus departed, when the Servant came to attend the Nephew to Bed, had waked him for that Purpose, and had at last made him sensible that his Uncle was gone, he, instead of accepting the kind Offices tendered him, insisted on a Chair be∣ing called; with this the Servant, who had received no strict Orders to the contrary, readily complied; and thus being conducted back to the House of Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> he had staggered up to Mr. <HI>Jones'</HI>s Chamber, as hath been before recounted.</P>
<P>This Bar of the Uncle being now removed (though young <HI>Nightingale</HI> knew not as yet in what Manner) and all Parties being quickly ready, the Mother Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nightingale,</HI> and his Love stept into a Hack∣ney-Coach, which conveyed him to Doctor's Com∣mons; where Miss <HI>Nancy</HI> was, in vulgar Language, soon made an honest Woman, and the poor Mother be∣came in the purest Sense of the Word, one of the hap∣piest of all human Beings.</P>
<P>And now Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> having seen his good Offices to that poor Woman and her Family brought to a happy Conclusion, began to apply himself to his own Concerns; but here lest many of my Readers should censure his Folly for thus troubling himself with the Affairs of others, and lest some few should think he acted more disinterestedly than indeed he did, we think proper to assure our Reader, that he was so far from being unconcerned in this Matter, that he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeed a very considerable Interest in bringing it to that final Consummation.</P>
<P>To explain this seeming Paradox at once, he was one who could truly say with him in <HI>Terence, Homo sum: Nihil humani a me alienum puto.</HI> He was never an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndifferent Spectator of the Misery or Happiness of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny one; and he felt either the one or the other in greater Proportion as he himself contributed to ei∣ther. He could not therefore be the Instrument of raising a whole Family from the lowest State of
<PB N="160" REF="165"/>
Wretchedness to the highest Pitch of Joy without conveying great Felicity to himself; more perhaps than worldly Men often purchase to themselves by undergoing the most severe Labour, and often by wad∣ing through the deepest Iniquity.</P>
<P>Those Readers who are of the same Complexion with him will perhaps think this short Chapter con∣tains abundance of Matter; while others may pro∣bably wish, short as it is, that it had been totally spar∣ed as impertinent to the main Design, which I sup∣pose they conclude is to bring Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> to the Gal∣lows, or if possible, to a more deplorable Catas∣trophe.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> had just read over these three Billets when Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> came into the Room. <Q REND="inline">'Well, <HI>Tom,'</HI> said he, 'any News from Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> after last Night's Adventure?'</Q> (for it was now no Secret to any one in that House who the Lady was.) <Q REND="inline">'The Lady <HI>Bellaston?</HI></Q> answered <HI>Jones</HI> very gravely.—<Q REND="inline">'Nay, dear <HI>Tom,</HI>' cries <HI>Nightingale,</HI> 'don't be so reserved to your Friends. Though I was too drunk to see her last Night, I saw her at the Masquerade. Do you think I am ignorant who the Queen of the Fairies is?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'And did you really then know the Lady at the Masquerade?'</Q> said <HI>Jones.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'Yes, upon my Soul, did I,' said <HI>Nightingale,</HI> 'and have given you twenty Hints of it since, though you seemed always so tender on that Point, that I wou'd not speak plainly. I fancy, my Friend, by your extreme Nicety in this Matter, you are not so well acquainted with the Character of the Lady as with her Person. Don't be angry <HI>Tom,</HI> but, upon my Honour, you are not the first young Fel∣low she hath debauched. Her Reputation is in no Danger, believe me.'</Q></P>
<P>Though <HI>Jones</HI> had no Reason to imagine the Lady <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o have been of the vestal Kind when his Amour be∣gan,
<PB N="162" REF="167"/>
yet as he was thoroughly ignorant of the Town and had very little Acquaintance in it, he had yet no Knowledge of that Character which is vulgarly called a Demirep; that is to say, a Woman that intrigues 'with every Man she likes, under the Name and Ap∣pearance of Virtue; and who, though some over-nice Ladies will not be seen with her, is visited (as they term it) by the whole Town; in short, whom every Body knows to be what no Body calls her.</P>
<P>When he found, therefore, that <HI>Nightingale</HI> was perfectly acquainted with his Intrigue, and began to suspect that so scrupulous a Delicacy as he had hi∣therto observed, was not quite necessary on the Oc∣casion, he gave a Latitude to his Friend's Tongue, and desired him to speak plainly what he knew, on had ever heard of the Lady.</P>
<P><HI>Nightingale,</HI> who in many other Instances, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rather too effeminate in his Disposition, had a pretty strong Inclination to Tittle Tattle. He had no soon∣er, therefore, received a full Liberty of speaking from <HI>Jones,</HI> than he entered upon a long Narrative concerning the Lady: which, as it contained many Particulars highly to her Dishonour, we have to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great a Tenderness for all Women of Condition to repeat; we would cautiously avoid giving an Oppor¦tunity to the future Commentators on our Works of making any malicious Application; and of forc¦ing us to be against our Will, the Author of Scandal which never entered into our Head.</P>

How can I possibly desert such a Woman? And yet I must desert her, or be guilty of the blackest Treachery to one, who deserves infinitely better of me than she can: A Wo∣man, my <HI>Nightingale,</HI> for whom I have a Passion which few can have an Idea of.

Indeed he began to look on all the Favours he had received, rather as Wages than Benefits, which not only de∣preciated

her, but himself too in his own Conceit, and put him quite out of Humour with both. From this Disgust, his Mind, by a natural Transition, turned towards <HI>Sophia:</HI> Her Virtue, her Purity, her Love to him, her Sufferings on his Account, filled all his Thoughts, and made his Commerce with Lady <HI>Bel∣laston</HI> appear still more odious. The Result of all was, that though his turning himself out of her <HI>Ser∣vice,</HI> in which Light he now saw his Affair with her, would be the Loss of his Bread, yet he determined to quit her; if he could but find a handsome Pretence; which having communicated to his Friend, <HI>Night∣ingale</HI> considered a little, and then said, <Q REND="inline">'I have it, my Boy; I have found out a sure Method: Pro∣pose Marriage to her, and I would venture Hang∣ing upon the Success.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Marriage!' cries <HI>Jones.</HI> Ay, propose Marriage,' answered <HI>Nightingale,</HI> 'and she will declare off in a Moment.

<P><HI>Jones</HI> declared he could not venture the Experi∣ment. <Q REND="inline">'Perhaps,' said he, 'she may be less shocked at this Proposal from one Man than from another. And if she should take me at my Word, where am I then?

<P>I am extremely concerned, that, by an unfor∣tunate Engagement abroad, I should have missed receiving the Honour of your Ladyship's Commands the Moment they came; and the Delay which I must now suffer of vindicating myself to your La∣dyship, greatly adds to this Misfortune.

Only permit me to say, that as your Honour is as dear to me as my own, so my sole Ambition is to have the Glory of lay∣ing my Liberty at your Feet; and believe me when I assure you, I can never be made completely hap∣py, without you generously bestow on me a legal Right of calling you mine for ever.

Though <HI>Jones</HI> was well satisfied with his Delive∣rance from a Thraldom which those who have ever experienced it will, I apprehend, allow to be none of the lightest, he was not, however, perfectly easy in his Mind. There was in this Scheme, too much of Fallacy to satisfy one who utterly detested every Spe∣cies of Falshood or Dishonesty: Nor would he, in∣deed, have submitted to put it in Practice, had he not been involved in a distressful Situation, where he was obliged to be guilty of some Dishonour, either to the one Lady or the other; and surely the Reader will allow, that every good Principle, as well as Love, pleaded strongly in Favour of <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nightingale,</HI> highly exulted in the Success of his Stratagem, upon which he received many Thanks, and much Applause from his Friend. He answered, <Q REND="inline">'Dear <HI>Tom,</HI> we have conferred very different Obli∣gations on each other. To me you owe the re∣gaining your Liberty; to you I owe the Loss of mine. But if you are as happy in the one Instance, as I am in the other, I promise you we are the two happiest Fellows in <HI>England.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>The two Gentlemen were now summoned down to Dinner, where Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> who performed her∣self the Office of Cook, had exerted her best Talents, to celebrate the Wedding of her Daughter. This joyful Circumstance, she ascribed principally to the friendly behaviour of <HI>Jones,</HI> her whole Soul was fired with Gratitude towards him, and all her Looks, Words, and Actions were so busied in expressing it, that her Daughter, and even her new Son-in-Law, were very little the Objects of her Consideration.</P>
<P>Dinner was just ended when Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> received a Letter, but as we had Letters enough in this Chapter, we shall communicate the Contents in our next.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="168" REF="173"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>Consisting partly of Facts, and partly of Observations upon them.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Letter then which arrived at the End of the preceding Chapter was from Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and the Purport of it was his Intention to come im∣mediately to Town, with his Nephew <HI>Blifil,</HI> and a Desire to be accommodated with his usual Lodg∣ings, which were the first Floor for himself, and the second for his Nephew.</P>
<P>The Chearfulness which had before display'd itself in the Countenance of the poor Woman, was a little clouded on this Occasion. This News did indeed a good deal disconcert her. To requite so disinte∣rested a Match with her Daughter, by presently turn∣ing her new Son-in-Law out of Doors, appeared to her very unjustifiable, on the one Hand; and on the other, she could scarce bear the Thoughts of making any Excuse to Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> after all the Obligations received from him, for depriving him of Lodgings which were indeed strictly his Due: For that Gentleman, in conferring all his numberless Be∣nefits on others, acted by a Rule diametrically oppo∣site to what is practised by most generous People. He contrived, on all Occasions, to hide his Beneficence not only from the World, but even from the Object of it. He constantly used the Words Lend and Pay, instead of Give; and by every other Method he could invent, always lessened the Favours he conferred with his Tongue, while he was heaping them with both his Hands. When he settled the Annuity of <HI>50l.</HI> a Year, therefore, on Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> he told her, <Q REND="inline">'It was in Consideration of always having her First-Floor when he was in Town,'</Q> (which he scarce ever intended to be) <Q REND="inline">'but that she might let it at any other Time, for that he would always send her a Month's
<PB N="169" REF="174"/>
Warning.'</Q> He was now, however, hurried to Town so suddenly, that he had no Opportunity of giving such Notice; and this Hurry probably pre∣vented him, when he wrote for his Lodgings, ad∣ding, <HI>if they were then empty:</HI> For he would most certainly have been well satisfied to have relinquished them on a less sufficient Excuse than what Mrs. <HI>Mil∣ler</HI> could now have made.</P>
<P>But there are a Sort of Persons, who, as <HI>Prior</HI> ex∣cellently well remarks, direct their Conduct by some∣thing</P>
<Q><L>Beyond the fix'd and settled Rules</L>
<L>Of Vice and Virtue in the Schools:</L>
<L>Beyond the Letter of the Law.</L></Q>
<P>To these it is so far from being sufficient that their Defence would acquit them at the <HI>Old-Bailey,</HI> that they are not even contented, though Conscience, the severest of all Judges, should discharge them. No∣thing short of the Fair and Honourable will satisfy the Delicacy of their Minds; and if any of their Actions fall short of this Mark, they mope and pine, are as uneasy and restless as a Murderer, who is afraid of a Ghost, or of the Hangman.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> was one of these. She could not con∣ceal her Uneasiness at this Letter; with the Contents of which she had no sooner acquainted the Company, and given some Hints of her Distress, than <HI>Jones,</HI> her good Angel, presently relieved her Anxiety. <Q REND="inline">'As for myself, Madam,' said he, 'my Lodging is at your Service at a Moment's Warning; and Mr. <HI>Night∣ingale,</HI> I am sure, as he cannot yet prepare a House fit to receive his Lady, will consent to return to his new Lodging, whither Mrs. <HI>Nightingale</HI> will cer∣tainly consent to go.</Q> With which Proposal both Husband and Wife instantly agreed.</P>
<P>The Reader will easily believe, that the Cheeks of Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> began again to glow with additional Gra∣titude to <HI>Jones;</HI> but, perhaps, it may be more diffi∣cult
<PB N="170" REF="175"/>
to persuade him that Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> having, in his last Speech, called her Daughter Mrs. <HI>Nightingale,</HI> (it being the first Time that agreeable Sound had ever reached her Ears) gave the fond Mother more Satis∣faction, and warmed her Heart more towards <HI>Jones,</HI> than his having dissipated her present Anxiety.</P>
<P>The next Day was then appointed for the Removal of the new-married Couple, and of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> who was likewise to be provided for in the same House with his Friend. And now the Serenity of the Company was again restored, and they past the Day in the ut∣most Chearfulness, all except <HI>Jones,</HI> who, though he outwardly accompanied the rest in their Mirth, felt many a bitter Pang on the Account of his <HI>Sophia;</HI> which were not a little heightened by the News of Mr. <HI>Blifil'</HI>s coming to Town, (for he clearly saw the Intention of his Journey:) And what greatly aggra∣vated his Concern was, that Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> who had promised to enquire after <HI>Sophia,</HI> and to make her Re∣port to him early the next Evening, had disappointed him.</P>
<P>In the Situation that he and his Mistress were a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Time, there were scarce any Grounds for him to hope that he should hear any good News; yet he was as impatient to see Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> as if he had ex∣pected she would bring him a Letter with an Assigna¦tion in it from <HI>Sophia,</HI> and bore the Disappointment a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ill. Whether this Impatience arose from that natura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Weakness of the Human Mind, which makes it desi∣rous to know the worst, and renders Uncertainty th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most intolerable of Pains; or whether he still flattered himself with some secret Hopes, we will not deter¦mine. But that it might be the last, whoever ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> loved cannot but know. For of all the Powers exer¦cised by this Passion over our Minds, one of the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> wonderful is that of supporting Hope in the midst o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Despair. Difficulties, Improbabilities, nay 
<PB N="171" REF="176"/>
Impossi∣bilities are quite overlook'd by it; so that to any Man extremely in Love, may be applied what <HI>Addison</HI> says of <HI>Caesar,</HI></P>
<Q><HI>The</HI> Alps, <HI>and</HI> Pyrenaeans <HI>sink before him!</HI></Q>
<P>Yet it is equally true, that the same Passion will some∣times make Mountans of Mole-hills, and produce De∣spair in the midst of Hope; but these cold Fits last not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong in good Constitutions. Which Temper <HI>Jones</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow in, we leave the Reader to guess, having no ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>act Information about it; but this is certain, that he had spent two Hours in Expectation, when being un∣able any longer to conceal his Uneasiness, he retired to his Room; where his Anxiety had almost made him frantick, when the following Letter was brought him from Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> with which we shall present the Reader <HI>verbatim &amp; literatim.</HI></P>

<P>Various are the Conjectures which <HI>Jones</HI> entertain∣ed on this Step of Lady <HI>Bellaston;</HI> who in reality had little further Design than to secure within her own House the Repository of a Secret, which she chose should make no farther Progress than it had made al∣ready; but mostly she desired to keep it from the Ears of <HI>Sophia;</HI> for tho' that young Lady was almost the only one who would never have repeated it again, her Ladyship could not persuade herself of this; since as she now hated poor <HI>Sophia</HI> with most implacable Hat∣red, she conceived a reciprocal Hatred to herself to be lodged in the tender Breast of our Heroine, where no such Passion had ever yet found an Entrance.</P>

<P>THERE was a Lady, one Mrs. <HI>Hunt,</HI> who had often seen <HI>Jones</HI> at the House where he lodged, being intimately acquainted with the Women there, and indeed a very great Friend to Mrs. <HI>Miller.</HI> Her Age was about thirty, for she owned six and twenty; her Face and Person very good, only inclining a lit∣tle too much to be fat. She had been married young by her Relations to an old <HI>Turkey</HI> Merchant, who having got a great Fortune, had left off Trade. With him she lived without Reproach, but not without Pain, in a State of great Self denial, for about twelve Years; and her Virtue was rewarded by his dying, and leav∣ing her very rich. The first Year of her Widowhood was just at an End, and she had past it in a good deal of Retirement, seeing only a few particular Friends, and dividing her Time between her Devotions and Novels, of which she was always extremely fond. Very good Health, a very warm Constitution, and a great deal of Religion made it absolutely necessary for her to marry again; and she resolved to please her∣self in her second Husband, as she had done her Friends in the first. From her the following Billet was brought to <HI>Jones.</HI></P>

<P>At the reading of this <HI>Jones</HI> was put into a violent Flutter. His Fortune was then at a very low Ebb, the Source being stopt from which hitherto he had been supplied. Of all he had received from Lady <HI>Bellas∣ton</HI> not above five Guineas remained, and that very Morning he had been dunned by a Tradesman for twice that Sum. His honourable Mistress was in the Hands of her Father, and he had scarce any Hopes ever to get her out of them again. To be subsisted at her Expence from that little Fortune she had inde∣pendent of her Father, went much against the Deli∣cacy both of his Pride and his Love. This Lady's Fortune would have been exceeding convenient to him and he could have no Objection to her in any Respect On the contrary, he liked her as well as he did any Woman except <HI>Sophia.</HI> But to abandon <HI>Sophia,</HI> and marry another, that was impossible; he could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> think of it upon any Account.

it not be kinder to her, than to continue her longer engaged in a hopeless Passion for him? Ought he not to do so in Friendship to her? This Notion prevail∣ed some Moments, and he had almost determined to be false to her from a high Point of Honour; but that Refinement was not able to stand very long a∣gainst the voice of Nature, which cried in his Heart, that such Friendship was Treason to Love.

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. <HI>A Discovery made by</HI> Partridge.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE <HI>Jones</HI> was exulting in the Conscious∣ness of his Integrity, <HI>Partridge</HI> came caper∣ing into the Room, as was his Custom when he brought, or fancied he brought, any good Tidings. He had been dispatched that Morning, by his Master, with Orders to endeavour, by the Servants of Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> or by any other Means, to discover whi∣ther <HI>Sophia</HI> had been conveyed; and he now returned, and with a joyful Countenance told our Heroe, that he had found the lost Bird. <Q REND="inline">'I have seen, Sir, says he, black <HI>George,</HI> the Game-keeper, who is one of the Servants whom the Squire hath brought with him to Town.

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of Prologues.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Have heard of a Dramatic Writer who used to say he would rather write a Play than a Prologue; in like manner, I think, I can with less Pains write one of the Books of this History, than the Prefatory Chapter to each of them.</P>
<P>To say the Truth, I believe many a hearty Curse hath been devoted on the Head of that Author, who first instituted the Method of prefixing to his Play that Portion of Matter which is called the Prologue; and which at first was Part of the Piece itself, but of latter Years hath had usually so little Connexion with the Drama before which it stands, that the Prologue to one Play might as well serve for any other. Those

The Sentiments in all these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re very little varied, nor is it possible they should; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd indeed I have often wondered at the great Inven∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on of Authors, who have been capable of finding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch various Phrases to express the same thing.</P>
<P>In like manner I apprehend, some future His∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orian (if any one shall do me the Honour of imitat∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g my Manner) will, after much scratching his Pate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estow some good Wishes on my Memory, for hav∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g first established these several initial Chapters; most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f which, like Modern Prologues, may as proper∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be prefixed to any other Book in this History as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that which they introduce, or indeed to any other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istory as to this.</P>
<P>But however Authors may suffer by either of these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ventions, the Reader will find suffieient Emolument <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the one, as the Spectator hath long found in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</P>
<P>First, it is well known, that the Prologue serves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Critic for an Opportunity to try his Faculty of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>issing, and to tune his Cat-call to the best Advan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ge; by which means, I have known those Musi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l Instruments so well prepared, that they have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le to play in full Concert at the first rising of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rtain.</P>
<P>The same Advantages may be drawn from these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hapters, in which the Critic will be always sure of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeting with something that may serve as a Whet∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne to his noble Spirit; so that he may fall with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore hungry Appetite for Censure on the History <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf. And here his sagacity must make it needless observe how artfully these Chapters are calculated that excellent Purpose; for in these we have al∣ways
<PB N="182" REF="187"/>
taken Care to intersperse somewhat of the sou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> or acid Kind, in order to sharpen and stimulate th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said Spirit of Criticism.</P>
<P>Again, the indolent Reader, as well as Spectator, finds great Advantage from both these; for as they are not obliged either to see the one or read the o∣thers, and both the Play and the Book are thus pro∣tracted, by the former they have a Quarter of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hour longer to sit at Dinner, and by the Latter the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have the Advantage of beginning to read at the fourt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or fifth Page instead of the first; a Matter by n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> means of trivial Consequence to Persons who rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Books with no other View than to say they have rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, a more general Motive to read than is com¦monly imagined; and from which not only La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Books, and Good Books, but the Pages of <HI>Home<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> of <HI>Swift</HI> and <HI>Cervantes</HI> have been ofte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> turned over.</P>
<P>Many other are the Emoluments which arise from both these, but they are for the most Part so obviou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that we shall not at present stay to enumerate them especially since it occurs to us that the principal Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of both the Prologue and Preface is that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> short.</P>

The second Morning after his Arrival, while he and the Parson were at Breakfast together on a Toast and Tankard, he was informed that a Gentleman was below to wait on him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'A Gentleman! quoth the Squire, who the Devil can he be? Do, Doctor, go down and see who 'tis. Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> can hardly be come to Town yet.—Go down, do, and know what his Bu∣siness is.'</Q></P>
<P>The Doctor returned with an Account that it was a very well drest Man, and by the Ribbon in his Hat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he took him for an Officer of the Army; that he said he had some particular Business, which he could deliver to none but Mr. <HI>Western</HI> himself.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">'I don't understand much of what you say, Sir,' said the Squire; 'but I suppose, by what you talk about my Daughter, that this is the Lord which my Lady Cousin <HI>Bellaston</HI> mentioned to me, and said something about his courting my Daughter.

down on her with the same Emotions which arise in an honest fair Tradesman, who sees his Debtor drag∣ged to Prison for <HI>10l.</HI> which, though a just Debt, the Wretch is wickedly unable to pay. Or, to hit the Case still more nearly, he felt the same Compunction with a Bawd when some poor Innocent whom she hath ensnared into her Hands, falls into Fits at the first Proposal of what is called seeing Company. In∣deed this Resemblance would be exact, was it not that the Bawd hath an Interest in what she doth, and the Father, though perhaps he may blindly think other∣wise, can in Reality have none in urging his Daugh∣ter to almost an equal Prostitution.</P>
<P>In this Condition he left his poor <HI>Sophia,</HI> and de∣parted with a very vulgar Observation on the Effect of Tears, he locked the Room, and returned to the Parson, who said every Thing he durst in Behalf of the young Lady, which though perhaps it was not quite so much as his Duty required, yet was it suffi∣cient to throw the Squire into a violent Rage, and in∣to many indecent Reflections on the whole Body of the Clergy, which we have too great an Honour for that sacred Function to commit to Paper.</P>

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>What happened to</HI> Sophia <HI>during her Confinement.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Landlady of the house where the Squire lodged had begun very early to entertain a strange Opinion of her Guests. However as she was inform∣ed that the Squire was a Man of a vast Fortune, and as she had taken Care to exact a very extraordinary Price for her Rooms, she did not think proper to give any Offence? for though she was not without some Concern for the Confinement of poor <HI>Sophia,</HI> of whose great Sweetness of Temper and Affability, the Maid of the House had made so favourable a Report, which was confirmed by all the Squire's Servants, yet she
<PB N="192" REF="197"/>
had much more Concern for her own Interest, than to provoke one, whom, as she said, she perceived to be a very hastish Kind of a Gentleman.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Sophia</HI> eat but little, yet she was regular∣ly served with her Meals; indeed I believe if she had liked any one Rarity, that the Squire, however an∣gry, would have spared neither Pains nor Cost to have procured it for her; since, however strange it may appear to some of my Readers, he really doated on his Daughter, and to give her any Kind of Pleasure was the highest Satisfaction of his Life.</P>
<P>The Dinner Hour being arrived, black <HI>George</HI> car∣ried her up a Pullet, the Squire himself (for he had sworn not to part with the Key) attending the Door. As <HI>George</HI> deposited the Dish, some Compliments passed between him and <HI>Sophia,</HI> (for he had not seen her since she left the Country, and she treated every Servant with more Respect than some Persons shew to those who are in a very slight Degree their Inferiors) <HI>Sophia</HI> would have had him take the Pullet back, say∣ing, she could not eat, but <HI>George</HI> begged her to try, and particularly recommended her to the Eggs, of which he said it was full.</P>
<P>All this Time the Squire was waiting at the Door; but <HI>George</HI> was a great Favourite with his Master, as his Employment was in Concerns of the highest Na∣ture, namely, about the Game, and was accustomed to take many Liberties. He had officiously carried up the Dinner, being, as he said, very desirous to see his young Lady; he made therefore no Scruple of keeping his Master standing above ten Minutes, while Civilities were passing between him and <HI>Sophia,</HI> for which he received only a good-humoured Rebuke at the Door when he returned.</P>
<P>The Eggs of Pullets, Partridges, Pheasants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were, as <HI>George</HI> well knew, the most favourite Dain∣ties of <HI>Sophia.</HI> It was therefore no Wonder, that he who was a very good-natured Fellow, should take
<PB N="193" REF="198"/>
Care to supply her with this Kind of Delicacy, at a Time when all the Servants in the House were afraid she would be starved; for she had scarce swallowed a single Morsel in the last forty Hours.</P>
<P>Though Vexation hath not the same Effect on all Persons, as it usually hath on a Widow, whose Ap∣petite it often renders sharper than it can be rendered by the Air on <HI>Bansted</HI> Downs, or <HI>Salisbury</HI> Plain, yet the sublimest Grief, notwithstanding what some Peo∣ple may say to the contrary, will eat at last. And <HI>Sophia</HI> herself, after some little Consideration, began to dissect the Fowl, which she found to be as full of Eggs as <HI>George</HI> had reported it.</P>
<P>But if she was pleased with these, it contained something which would have delighted the Royal So∣ciety much more; for if a Fowl with three Legs be so invaluable a Curiosity, when perhaps Time hath produced a Thousand such, at what Price shall we esteem a Bird which so totally contradicts all the Laws of Animal Oeconomy, as to contain a Letter in its Belly? <HI>Ovid</HI> tells us of a Flower into which <HI>Hya∣cinthus</HI> was metamorphosed, that bears Letters on its Leaves, which <HI>Virgil</HI> recommended as a Miracle to the Royal Society of his Day; but no Age nor Nation hath ever recorded a Bird with a Letter in its Maw.</P>
<P>But though a Miracle of this Kind might have en∣gaged all the <HI>Academies des Sciences</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> and perhaps in a fruitless Enquiry, yet the Reader by bare∣ly recollecting the last Dialogue which passed between Messieurs <HI>Jones</HI> and <HI>Partridge,</HI> will be very easily satisfied from whence this Letter came, and how it found its Passage into the Fowl.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia,</HI> notwithstanding her long Fast, and notwith∣standing her favourite Dish was there before her, no sooner saw the Letter than she immediately snatched it up, tore it open, and read as follows.</P>
<LETTER>

Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Was I was not sensible to whom I have the Ho∣nour of writing, I should endeavour, however dif∣ficult, to paint the Horros of my Mind, at the Account brought me by Mrs. <HI>Honour:</HI> but as Ten∣derness alone can have any true Idea of the Pangs which Tenderness is capable of feeling; so can this most amiable Quality which my <HI>Sophia</HI> possesses in the most eminent Degree, sufficiently inform her what her <HI>Jones</HI> must have suffered on this melancholy Occasion.—Is there a Circumstance in the World which can highten my Agonies, when I hear of any Misfortune which hath befallen you? Surely there is one only, and with that I am accursed. It is, my <HI>Sophia,</HI> the dreadful Consideration that I am myself the wretched Cause. Perhaps I here do myself too much Honour, but none will envy me¦an Honour which costs me so extremely dear. Par∣don me this Presumption, and pardon me the grea∣ter still, if I ask you whether my Advice, my As∣sistance, my Presence, my Absence, my Death o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my Tortures can bring you any Relief? Can the most perfect Admiration, the most watchful Obser∣vance, the most ardent Love, the most melting Ten∣derness, the most resigned Submission to your Will make you Amends for what you are to sacrifice to my Happiness? If they can, fly, my lovely An∣gel, to those Arms which are ever open to received and protect you; and to which, whether you bring yourself alone, or the Riches of the World with you, is, in my Opinion, an Alternative not worth regarding. If, on the contrary, Wisdom shall pre∣dominate, and, on the most mature Reflection, in∣form you, that the Sacrifice is too great; and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there be no Way left to reconcile you to your Fa∣ther, and restore the Peace of your dear Mind, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by abandoning me, I conjure you drive me for eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from your Thoughts, exert your Resolution, and
<PB N="195" REF="200"/>
let no Compassion for my Sufferings bear the least Weight in that tender Bosom. Believe me, Ma∣dam, I so sincerely love you better than myself, that my great and principal End is your Happiness. My first Wish (why would not Fortune indulge me in it?) was, and pardon me if I say, still is to see you every Moment the happiest of Women; my second Wish is to hear you are so; but no Misery on Earth can equal mine, while I think you owe an uneasy Moment to him who is,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>What <HI>Sophia</HI> said, or did, or thought upon this Let∣ter, how often she read it, or whether more than once, shall all be left to our Reader's Imagination. The Answer to it he may perhaps see hereafter, but not at present; for this Reason, among others, that she did not now write any, and that for several good Causes, one of which was this, she had no Paper, Pen, nor Ink.</P>
<P>In the Evening while <HI>Sophia</HI> was meditating on the Letter she had received, or something else, a violent Noise from below disturbed her Meditation. This Noise was no other than a round Bout at Alterca∣tion between two Persons. One of the Combatants, by his Voice, she immediately distinguished to be her Father; but she did not so soon discover the shriller Pipes to belong to the Organ of her Aunt <HI>Western,</HI> who was just arrived in Town, and having by means of one of her Servants, who stopt at the <HI>Hercules Pil∣lars,</HI> learnt where her Brother lodged, she drove di∣rectly to his Lodgings.</P>
<P>We shall therefore take our Leave at present of <HI>Sophia,</HI> and with our usual Good-Breeding, attend her Ladyship.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>In which</HI> Sophia <HI>is delivered from her Confinement.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Squire and the Parson (for the Landlord was now otherwise engaged) were smoaking their Pipes together, when the Arrival of the Lady was first signified. The Squire no sooner heard her Name, than he immediately ran down to usher her up Stairs; for he was a great Observer of such Ceremo∣nials, especially to his Sister, of whom he stood more in awe than of any other human Creature, though he ne∣ver would own this, nor did he perhaps know it himself.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Western,</HI> on her Arrival in the Dining-Room, having flung herself into a Chair, begun thus to ha∣rangue. <Q REND="inline">'Well, surely no one ever had such an in∣tolerable Journey. I think the Roads, since so ma∣ny Turnpike Acts, are grown worse than ever. La Brother, how could you get into this odious Place? No Person of Condition, I dare swear, ever set Foot here before. In every Sense, and to every Purpose, Your devoted'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I don't know, cries the Squire, I think they do well enough; it was Landlord recommended them.

I have her safe; I vetched her from my Lady Cousin the first Night I came to Town, and I have taken Care o' her ever since; she is as secure as a Fox in a Bag, I promise you.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Good Heaven! returned Mrs. <HI>Western,</HI> what do I hear! I thought what a fine Piece of Work would be the Consequence of
<PB N="197" REF="202"/>
my Consent to your coming to Town yourself; nay, it was indeed your own Headstrong Will, nor can I charge myself with having ever consented to it. Did not you promise me, Brother, that you would take none of these Headstrong Measures. Was it not by those Headstrong Measures that you forced my Neice to run away from you in the Country? Have you Mind to oblige her to take such another Step?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Z—ds and the Devil,' cries the Squire, dashing his Pipe on the Ground, 'did ever Mortal hear the like? when I expected you would have commend∣ed me for all I have done, to be fallen upon in this Manner!'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'How! Brother, said the Lady, have I ever given you the least Reason to imagine I should commend you for locking up your Daughter? Have I not often told you, that Women in a free Coun∣try are not to be treated with such arbitrary Power? We are as free as the Men, and I heartily wish I could not say we deserve that Freedom better. If you expect I should stay a Moment longer in this wretched House, or that I should ever own you again as my Relation, or that I should ever trou∣ble myself again with the Affairs of your Family, I insist upon it that my Neice be set at Liberty this Instant.'</Q> This she spoke with so commanding an Air, standing with her Back to the Fire, with one Hand behind her, and a Pinch of Snuff in the other, that I question whether <HI>Thalestris</HI> at the Head of her Amazons, ever made a more tremendous Figure. It is no Wonder therefore that the poor Squire was not Proof against the Awe which she inspired. <Q REND="inline">'There, he cried,' throwing down the Key, 'There it is, do whatever you please. I intended only to have kept her up till <HI>Blifil</HI> came to Town, which can't be long; and now if any Harm happens in the mean Time, remember who is to be blamed for it.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I will answer it with my Life, cry'd Mrs. <HI>Wes∣tern,</HI> but I shall not intermeddle at all, unless upon

one Condition, and that is, that you will commit the whole entirely to my Care, without taking any one Measure yourself, unless I shall eventually ap∣point you to act. If you ratify these Preliminaries, Brother, I yet will endeavour to preserve the Ho∣nour of your Family; if not, I shall continue in a neutral State.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I pray you, good Sir, said the Parson, permit your∣self this once to be admonished by her Ladyship peradventure by communing with young Madam <HI>Sophia,</HI> she will effect more than you have been able to perpetrate by more rigorous Measures.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'What dost thee open upon me?' cries the Squire 'If thee dost begin to babble, I shall whip thee in presently.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Fie, Brother,' answered the Lady, 'is this Lan∣guage to a Clergyman? Mr. <HI>Supple</HI> is a Man o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sense, and gives you the best Advice, and the whole World, I believe, will concur in his Opinion; but I must tell you I expect an immediate Answer to my catagorical Proposals.

<P><PB N="199" REF="204"/>
<Q REND="inline">'And it would have been happy for her,' answer∣ed the Lady, if she had always lived with me. Nothing of this Kind would have happened under my Eye.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Ay, certainly,' cries he, 'I only am to blame.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Why, you are to blame, Brother,' answered she, I have been obliged to tell you so, and shall al∣ways be obliged to tell you so. However, I hope you will now amend, and gather so much Experi∣ence from past Errors, as not to defeat my wisest Machinations by your Blunders. Indeed, Brother, you are not qualified for these Negotiations. All your whole Scheme of Politics is wrong. I once more, therefore, insist, that you do not intermed∣dle. Remember only what is past.—'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Z—ds and Bl—d, Sister,' cries the Squire, 'What would you have me say? You are enough to provoke the Devil.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'There now,' said she, 'just according to the old Custom. I see, Brother, there is no talking to you. I will appeal to Mr. <HI>Supple,</HI> who is a Man of Sense, if I said any Thing which could put any Human Creature into a Passion; but you are so wrong-headed every Way.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Let me beg you Madam,' said the Parson, 'not to irritate his Worship.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Irritate him?' said the Lady;—'Sure you are as great a Fool as himself.

her, not sparing himself for having ever thought of her Estate; but added, <Q REND="inline">'Now one hath been a Slave so long, it would be Pity to lose it at last, for want of holding out a little longer. The Bitch can't live for ever, and I know I am down for it upon the Will.'</Q></P>
<P>The Parson greatly commended this Resolution) and now the Squire having ordered in another Bot∣tle, which was his usual Method when any Thing either pleased or vexed him, did, by drinking plen∣tifully of this medicinal Julap, so totally wash away his Choler, that his Temper was become perfectly placid and serene, when Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> returned with <HI>Sophia</HI> into the Room. The young Lady had on her Hat and Capuchin, and the Aunt acquainted Mr. <HI>Western,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'that she intended to take her Neice with her to her own Lodgings; for, indeed, Brother,' says she, 'these Rooms are not fit to receive a Christian Soul in.'</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">'To this,' cries the Parson, 'I am ready to bear Testimony.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Nay, Brother,' says Mrs. <HI>Western,</HI> 'I have al∣ways, I'm sure, given you as favourable a Cha∣racter. You must own you have a little too much Hastiness in your Temper; but when you will allow yourself Time to reflect, I never knew a Man more reasonable.'</Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P>A Child who hath just learnt his Letters, would have spelt this Letter out in less Time than <HI>Jones</HI> took in reading it. The Sensations it occasioned were a Mixture of Joy and Grief; somewhat like what di∣vide the Mind of a good Man when he peruses the Will of his deceased Friend, in which a large Legacy, which his Distresses make the more welcome, is be∣queathed to him. Upon the whole, however, he was more pleased than displeased; and indeed the Reader may probably wonder that he was displeased at all; but the Reader is not quite so much in Love as
<PB N="204" REF="209"/>
was poor <HI>Jones:</HI> And Love is a Disease, which, tho' it may in some Instances resemble a Consumption, (which it sometimes causes) in others proceeds in di∣rect Opposition to it, and particularly in this, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> never flatters itself, or sees any one Symptom in a fa∣vourable Light.</P>
<P>One Thing gave him complete Satisfaction, which was, that his Mistress had regained her Liberty, and was now with a Lady where she might at least assure herself of a decent Treatment. Another comforta∣ble Circumstance, was the Reference which she made to her Promise of never marrying any other Man. For however disinterested he might imagine his Pas∣sion, and notwithstanding all the generous Overture made in his Letter, I very much question whether he could have heard a more afflicting Piece of News, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that <HI>Sophia</HI> was married to another tho' the Matc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had been never so great, and never so likely to end in making her completely happy. That refined Degre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of <HI>Platonic</HI> Affection which is absolutely detached from the Flesh, and is indeed entirely and purely spi∣ritual, is a Gift confined to the female Part of the Cre∣ation: many of whom I have heard declare, (and doubtless with great Truth) that they would, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the utmost Readiness, resign a Lover to a Rival, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such Resignation was proved to be necessary for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> temporal Interest of such Lover. Hence, therefore I conclude, that this Affection is in Nature, though I cannot pretend to say, I have ever seen an Instan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> having spent three Hours in reading an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kissing the aforesaid Letter, and being, at last, in State of good Spirits, from the last mentioned Con∣siderations, he agreed to carry an Appointment which he had before made into Execution. This was to at∣tend Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> and her youngest Daughter into th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gallery at the Playhouse, and to admit Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> as one of the Company. For as <HI>Jones</HI> had really tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="205" REF="210"/>
Taste for Humour which many affect, he expected to enjoy much Entertainment in the Criticisms of <HI>Par∣tridge;</HI> from whom he expected the simple Dictates of Nature, unimproved indeed, but likewise unadul∣terated by Art.</P>
<P>In the first Row then of the first Gallery did Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> her youngest Daughter, and <HI>Par∣tridge</HI> take their Place: <HI>Partridge</HI> immediately de∣clared, it was the finest Place he had ever been in. When the first Musick was played, he said, <Q REND="inline">'It was a Wonder how so many Fidlers could play at one Time, without putting one another out.'</Q> While the Fellow was lighting the upper Candles, he cry'd out to Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'Look, look, Madam, the very Picture of the Man in the End of the Common-Prayer Book, before the Gun-powder-Treason Ser∣vice:'</Q> Nor could he help observing, with a Sigh when all the Candles were lighted, <Q REND="inline">'That here were Candles enough burnt in one Night, to keep an honest poor Family for a whole Twelvemonth.'</Q></P>
<P>As soon as the Play, which was <HI>Hamlet</HI> Prince of <HI>Denmark,</HI> began, <HI>Partridge</HI> was all Attention, nor did he break Silence till the Entrance of the Ghost; upon which he asked <HI>Jones,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'what Man that was in the strange Dress; something,' said he, 'like what I have seen in a Picture. Sure it is not Armour, is it?'</Q> <HI>Jones</HI> answered, <Q REND="inline">'That is the Ghost.'</Q> To which <HI>Partridge</HI> replied with a Smile, <Q REND="inline">'Perswade me to that, Sir, if you can. Though I can't say I ever actually saw a Ghost in my Life, yet I am certain I should know one, if I saw him, better than that comes to. No, no, Sir, Ghosts don't appear in such Dresses as that, neither.'</Q> In this Mistake, which caused much Laughter in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Partridge,</HI> he was suffered to continue, 'till the Scene between the <HI>Ghost</HI> and <HI>Hamlet,</HI> when <HI>Partridge</HI> gave that Cre∣dit to Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> which he had denied to <HI>Jones,</HI> and fell into so violent a Trembling, that his Knees
<PB N="206" REF="211"/>
knocked against each other. <HI>Jones</HI> asked him what was the Matter, and whether he was afraid of the Warrior upon the Stage? <Q REND="inline">'O la! Sir,' said he, 'I perceive now it is what you told me. I am not afraid of any Thing; for I know it is but a Play: And if it was really a Ghost, it could do one no Harm at such a Distance, and in so much Company; and yet if I was frightned, I am not the only Per∣son.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Why, who,' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'dost thou take to be such a Coward here besides thyself?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Nay, you may call me Coward if you will; but if that lit∣tle Man there upon the Stage is not frightned, I never saw any Man frightned in my Life. Ay, ay; <HI>go along with you!</HI> Ay, to be sure! Who's Fool then? Will you? Lud have Mercy upon such Fool-Hardiness!—Whatever happens, it is good enough for you.<HI>—Follow you?</HI> I'd follow the Devil as soon. Nay, perhaps, it is the Devil—for they say he can put on what likeness he pleases.—Oh! here he is again.<HI>—No farther!</HI> No, you have gone far enough already; farther than I'd have gone for all the King's Dominons.'</Q> <HI>Jones</HI> offered to speak, but <HI>Partrisge</HI> cried, <Q REND="inline">'Hush, hush, dear Sir, don't you hear him!'</Q> And during the whole Speech of the Ghost, he sat with his Eyes fixed partly on the Ghost, and partly on <HI>Hamlet,</HI> and with his Mouth open; the same Passions which succeeded each other in <HI>Hamlet,</HI> succeeding likewise in him.</P>
<P>When the Scene was over, <HI>Jones</HI> said, <Q REND="inline">'Why, <HI>Partridge,</HI> you exceed my Expectations. You en∣joy the Play more than I conceived possible.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Nay, Sir, answered <HI>Partridge,</HI> 'if you are not afraid of the Devil, I can't help it; but to be sure it is natu∣ral to be surprized at such Things, though I know there is nothing in them: Not that it was the Ghost that surprized me neither; for I should have known that to have been only a Man in a strange Dress: But when I saw the little Man so frightned himself,
<PB N="207" REF="212"/>
it was that which took Hold of me.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'And dost thou imagine then, <HI>Partridge,'</HI> cries <HI>Jones,</HI> that he was really frightned'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Nay, Sir,' said <HI>Partridge,</HI> 'did not you yourself observe afterwards, when he found out it was his own Father's Spirit, and how he was murder∣ed in the Garden, how his Fear forsook him by De∣grees, and he was struck dumb with Sorrow, as it were, just as I should have been, had it been my own Case.—But hush' O la? What Noise is that? There he is again.—Well, to be certain, though I know there is nothing at all in it, I am glad I am not down yonder where those Men are.' Then turning his Eyes again upon <HI>Hamlet,</HI> 'Ay, you may draw your Sword; what signifies a Sword against the Power of the Devil?'</Q></P>
<P>During the second Act, <HI>Partridge</HI> made very few remarks. He greatly admired the Fineness of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resses; nor could he help observing upon the King's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ountenance. <Q REND="inline">'Well,' said he, 'how People may be deceived by Faces? <HI>Nulla fides fronti</HI> is, I find, a true Saying. Who would think, by looking in the King's Face, that he had ever committed a Mur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er?'</Q> He then enquired after the Ghost; but <HI>Jones,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho intended he should be surprized, gave him no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther Satisfaction, than <Q REND="inline">'that he might possibly see him again soon, and in a Flash of Fire.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Partridge</HI> sat in fearful expectation of this; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow when the Ghost made his next Appearance, <HI>Par∣tridge</HI> cried out, <Q REND="inline">'There, Sir, now; what say you now? Is he frightned now or no? As much frightned as you think me, and, to be sure, no Bo∣dy can help some Fears, I would not be in so bad a Condition as what's his Name, Squire <HI>Hamlet,</HI> is there, for all the World. Bless me! What's become of the Spirit? As I am a living Soul, I thought I saw him sink into the Earth.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, you saw right,'</Q> answered <HI>Jones.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'Well, well,' cries <HI>Par∣tridge,</HI> 'I know it is only a Play; and besides, if
<PB N="208" REF="213"/>
there was any Thing in all this, Madam <HI>Miller</HI> would not laugh so: For as to you, Sir, you would not be afraid, I believe, if the Devil was here i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Person.—There, there—Ay, no Wonde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you are in such a Passion; shake the vile wicke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wretch to Pieces, If she was my own Mother I should serve her so. To be sure, all Duty to Mother is forfeited by such wicked Doings.—Ay, go about your Business; I hate the Sight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> you.'</Q></P>
<P>Our Critic was now pretty silent till the Play, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Hamlet</HI> introduces before the King. This he did n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> at first understand, 'till <HI>Jones</HI> explained it to him but he no sooner entered into the Spirit of it, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> began to bless himself that he had never committe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Murder.' Then turning to Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> he asked he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <Q REND="inline">'If she did not imagine the King looked as if he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> touched; though he is,' said he, 'a good Acto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and doth all he can to hide it. Well, I would n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> have so much to answer for, as that wicked M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> there hath, to sit upon a much higher Chair than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sits upon.—No wonder he run away; for yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Sake I'll never trust an innocent Face again.'</Q></P>
<P>The Grave-digging Scene next engaged the At¦tention of <HI>Partridge,</HI> who expressed much Surpri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> at the Number of Skulls thrown upon the Stag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> To which <HI>Jones</HI> answered, <Q REND="inline">'That it was one of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most famous Burial-Places about Town.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wonder then,' cries <HI>Partridge,</HI> 'that the Place haunted. But I never saw in my Life a worse Grav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> digger.

any Thing belonging to a dead Man on any Ac∣count.—He seemed frightned enough too at the Ghost I thought. <HI>Nemo omnibus horis sapit.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>Little more worth remembring occurred during the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay; at the End of which <HI>Jones</HI> asked him, <Q REND="inline">'which of the Players he had liked best?'</Q> To this he an∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wered, with some Appearance of Indignation at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uestion, <Q REND="inline">'The King without Doubt.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Mr. <HI>Partridge,'</HI> says Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> 'you are not of the same Opinion with the Town; for they all a∣greed, that <HI>Hamlet</HI> is acted by the best Player who was ever on the Stage.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'He the best Player!' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es <HI>Partridge</HI> with a contemptuous Sneer, 'why I could act as well as he myself. I am sure if I had seen a Ghost, I should have looked in the very same Manner, and done just as he did. And then, to be sure, in that Scene, as you call it, between him and his Mother, where you told me he acted so fine, why, Lord help me, any Man, that is, any good Man, that had such a Mother, would have done exactly the same. I know you are only jok∣ing with me; but, indeed, Madam, though I was never at a Play in <HI>London,</HI> yet I have seen acting before in the Country; and the King for my Money; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he speake all his Words distinctly, half as loud again as the other.—Any Body may see he is an Actor.'</Q></P>
<P>While Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> was thus engaged in Conversa∣tion with <HI>Partridge,</HI> a Lady came up to Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hom he immediately knew to be Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e said, she had seen him from the other Part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allery, and had taken that Opportunity of speaking him, as she had something to say, which might be great Service to himself. She then acquainted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with her Lodgings, and made him an Appoint∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent the next Day in the Morning; which, upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecollection, she presently changed to the Afternoon; which Time <HI>Jones</HI> promised to attend her.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="215"/>
Thus ended the Adventure at the Play-hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> where <HI>Partridge</HI> had afforded great Mirth, not o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to <HI>Jones</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> but to all who sat with hearing, who were more attentive to what he sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than to any Thing that passed on the Stage.</P>

Indeed, he now proposed the Gra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fication of a very strong Passion besides Avarice, by marrying this young Lady, and this was Hatred: For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e concluded that Matrimony afforded an equal Op∣portunity of satisfying either Hatred or Love; and his Opinion is very probably verified by much Expe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ience. To say the Truth, if we are to judge by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e ordinary Behaviour of married Persons to each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther, we shall, perhaps, be apt to conclude, that the Generality seek the Indulgence of the former Passion only in their Union of every Thing but of Hearts.</P>
<P>There was one Difficulty, however, in his Way, and this arose from Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI> That good Man, when he found by the Departure of <HI>Sophia,</HI> (for nei∣ther that, nor the Cause of it, could be concealed from him) the great Aversion which she had for his Ne∣phew, began to be seriously concerned that he had been deceived into carrying Matters so far. He by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Means concurred with the Opinions of those Pa∣rents, who think it as immaterial to consult the Inclinations of their Children in the Affair of Mar∣riage, as to solicit the good Pleasure of their Servants when they intend to take a Journey; and who are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Law or Decency at least, withheld often from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing absolute Force. On the contrary, as he es∣teemed the Institution to be of the most sacred Kind, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thought every preparatory Caution necessary to
<PB N="212" REF="217"/>
preserve it holy and inviolate; and very wisely con¦cluded, that the surest Way to effect this, was by lay¦ing the Foundation in previous Affections.</P>
<P><HI>Blifil</HI> indeed soon cured his Uncle of all Anger o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Score of Deceit, by many Vows and Protestati¦ons that he had been deceived himself, with which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many Declarations of <HI>Western</HI> very well tallied; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now to persuade <HI>Allworthy</HI> to consent to the renewing his Addresses, was a Matter of such apparent Difficul¦ty, that the very Appearance was sufficient to hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deterred a less enterprizing Genius: but this young Gentleman so well knew his own Talents, that no¦thing within the Province of Cunning, seemed to him hard to be atchieved.</P>
<P>Here then he represented the Violence of his own Affection, and the Hopes of subduing Aversion i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Lady by Perseverance. He begged that in an Af¦fair on which depended all his future Repose, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> might at least be at Liberty to try all fair Means fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Success. Heaven forbid, he said, that he should e¦ver think of prevailing by any other than the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> gentle Methods. <Q REND="inline">'Besides, Sir, said he, if they fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you may then (which will be surely time enough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deny your Consent.'</Q> He urged the great and eage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Desire which Mr. <HI>Western</HI> had for the Match, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lastly, he made great Use of the Name of <HI>Jones,</HI> to whom he imputed all that had happened, and from whom, he said, to preserve so valuable a young Lady was even on Act of Charity.</P>
<P>All these Arguments were well seconded by <HI>Thwack¦um,</HI> who dwelt a little stronger on the Authority o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Parents than Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> himself had done. He ascrib¦ed the Measures which Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> was desirous to take to Christian Motives; <Q REND="inline">'and though,' says he, 'the good young Gentleman hath mentioned Charity last I am almost convinced it is his first and principal Consideration.'</Q></P>

<P><HI>Allworthy,</HI> though not without Reluctance, at last <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ielded to the Desires of his Nephew. He said, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould accompany him to <HI>London,</HI> where he might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e at Liberty to use every honest Endeavour to gain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Lady: <Q REND="inline">'But I declare,' said he, 'I will never give my Consent to any absolute Force being put on her Inclinations, nor shall you ever have her, unless she can be brought freely to Compliance.'</Q></P>
<P>Thus did the Affection of <HI>Allworthy</HI> for his Ne∣phew, betray the superior Understanding to be tri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mphed over by the inferiour; and thus is the Pru∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence of the best of Heads often defeated by the Ten∣derness of the best of Hearts.</P>
<P><HI>Blifil</HI> having obtained this unhoped for Acquiescence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n his Uncle, rested not till he carried his Purpose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto Execution. And as no immediate Business re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uired Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Presence in the Country, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittle Preparation is necessary to Men for a Journey, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey set out the very next Day, and arrived in Town <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat Evening when Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> as we have seen, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iverting himself with <HI>Partridge</HI> at the Play.</P>
<P>The Morning after his Arrival, Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> waited on Mr. <HI>Western,</HI> by whom he was most kindly and graciously received, and from whom he had every possible Assurance (perhaps more than was possible) that he should very shortly be as happy as <HI>Sophia</HI> could make him; nor would the Squire suffer the young Gentleman to return to his Uncle, till he had, almost against his Will, carried him to his Sister.</P>

<P>MRS. <HI>Western</HI> was reading a Lecture on Pru¦dence, and Matrimonial Politics to her Niece when her Brother and <HI>Blifil</HI> broke in with less Ce¦remony than the Laws of Visiting require. <HI>Sophia</HI> no sooner saw <HI>Blifil,</HI> than she turned pale, and al¦most lost the Use of all her Faculties; but her Aun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the contrary waxed red, and having all her Facul¦ties at Command, began to exert her Tongue on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Squire.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">'Brother,' cries Mrs. <HI>Western,</HI> 'Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> I am confident, understands himself better than to think of seeing my Niece any more this Morning after what hath happened.

<P>If Mr. <HI>Western</HI> was little pleased with this Inter∣view, <HI>Blifil</HI> was less. As to the former, he imputed the whole Behaviour of his Sister to her Humour only, and to her Dissatisfaction at the omission of Ceremony in the Visit; but <HI>Blifil</HI> saw a little deeper into Things. He suspected somewhat of more Consequence, from two or three Words which dropt from the Lady; and, to say the Truth, he suspected right, as will ap∣pear

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Schemes of Lady</HI> Bellaston <HI>for the Ruin of</HI> Jones.</HEAD>
<P>LOVE had taken too deep a Root in the Mind of Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> to be plucked up by the rude Hands of Mr. <HI>Western.</HI> In the Heat of Resentment he had indeed given a Commission to Captain <HI>Egglane,</HI> which the Captain had far exceeded in the Execution; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or had it been executed at all, had his Lordship been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble to find the Captain after he had seen Lady <HI>Bel∣laston,</HI> which was in the Afternoon of the Day after he had received the Affront; but so industrious was the Captain in the Discharge of his Duty, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aving, after long Enquiry, found out the Squire's Lodg∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs very late in the Evening, he sat up all Night at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tavern, that he might not miss the Squire in the Morning, and by that Means missed the Revocation which my Lord had sent to his Lodgings.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon then next after the intended Rape <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f <HI>Sophia,</HI> his Lordship, as we have said, made a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isit to Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> who laid open so much of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>haracter of the Squire, that his Lordship plainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Absurdity he had been guilty of in taking any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffence at his Words, especially as he had those ho∣nourable Designs on his Daughter.

<P>Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> very heartily thanked her Ladyshi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the Part which she was pleased to take in the Af¦fair, upon the Success of which his whole futu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Happiness entirely depended. He said, he saw at pre¦sent no Objection to the pressing Scheme, and wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> consider of putting it in Execution. He then m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> earnestly recommended to her Ladyship, to do h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Honour of immediately mentioning his Propo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to the Family; to whom he said, he offered a <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Blanche,</HI> and would settle his Fortune in almost a manner they should require. And after uttering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ny Extasies and Raptures concerning <HI>Sophia,</HI> he to his leave and departed, but not before he had receiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the strongest Charge to beware of <HI>Jones,</HI> and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no time in securing his Person where he should longer be in a Capacity of making any Attempts the Ruin of the young Lady.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="224"/>
The Moment Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> was arrived at her Lodgings, a Card was dispatched with her Compli∣ments to Lady <HI>Bellaston;</HI> who no sooner received it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han with the Impatience of a Lover, she flew to her Cousin, rejoiced at this fair Opportunity, which be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond her Hopes offered itself: for she was much bet∣ter pleased with the Prospect of making the Proposals <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Woman of Sense, and who knew the World, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an to a Gentleman whom she honoured with the Appellation of <HI>Hottentot;</HI> though indeed from him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he apprehended no Danger of a Refusal.</P>
<P>The two Ladies being met, after very short pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous Ceremonials, fell to Business, which was in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed almost as soon concluded as begun; for Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> no sooner heard the Name of Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han her Cheeks glowed with Pleasure; but when she was acquainted with the Eagerness of his Passion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Earnestness of his Proposals, and the Generosity of his Offer, she declared her full Satisfaction in the most explicit Terms.</P>
<P>In the Progress of their Conversation their Dis∣course turned to <HI>Jones,</HI> and both Cousins very pathe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ically lamented the unfortunate Attachment, which both agreed, <HI>Sophia</HI> had to that young Fellow; and Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> entirely attributed it to the Folly of her Brother's Management. She concluded however at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast, with declaring her Confidence in the good Un∣derstanding of her Niece, who though she would not give up her Affection in Favour of <HI>Blifil,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'will, I doubt not', says she, 'soon be prevailed upon to sacrifice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> simple Inclination to the Addresses of a fine Gen∣tleman, who brings her both a Title and a large Es∣tate: For indeed,' added she, 'I must do <HI>Sophy</HI> the Justice to confess, this <HI>Blifil</HI> is but a hideous kind of Fellow, as you know, <HI>Bellaston,</HI> all Country Gen∣tlemen are, and hath nothing but his Fortune to re∣commend him.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'<PB N="220" REF="225"/>
Nay,' said Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> 'I don't then so much wonder at my Cousin; for I promise you this <HI>Jones</HI> is a very agreeable Fellow, and hath one Virtue which the Men say is a great Recommendation to us. What do you think, <HI>Bel—</HI>I shall certainly make you laugh; nay, I can hardly tell you myself for laughing?—Will you believe that the Fellow hath had the Assurance to make Love to me? But i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you be inclined to disbelieve it, here is Evidence enough, his own Hand-writing, I assure you. She then delivered her Cousin the Letter with the Proposals of Marriage, which if the Reader hath a Desire to see, he will find already on Record in the XVth Book of this History.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Upon my Word, I am astonished,' said Mrs. <HI>Western,</HI> 'this is indeed a Master-piece of Assurance. With your leave, I may possibly make some use of this Letter;'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'You have my full Liberty', cris Lady <HI>Bellaston,'</HI> 'to apply it to what Purpose you please. However, I would not have it shewn to any but Miss <HI>Western,</HI> nor to her unless you find Occasion.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Well, and how did you use the Fellow?'</Q> returned Mrs. <HI>Western.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'Not as a Hus∣band,' said the Lady, 'I am not married, I pro∣mise you, my Dear. You know, <HI>Bell,</HI> I have try'd the Comforts once already, and once I think enough for any reasonable Woman.'</Q></P>
<P>This Letter Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> thought would cer∣tainly turn the Ballance against <HI>Jones</HI> in the Mind of <HI>Sophia,</HI> and she was emboldened to give it up, partly by her Hopes of having him instantly dispatched out of the way, and partly by having secured the Evi∣dence of <HI>Honour,</HI> who, upon sounding her, she saw sufficient Reason to imagine, was prepared to testify whatever she pleased.</P>
<P>But perhaps the Reader may wonder why Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> who in her Heart hated <HI>Sophia,</HI> should be
<PB N="221" REF="226"/>
so desirous of promoting a Match, which was so much to the Interest of the young Lady. Now I would desire such Readers to look carefully into human Nature, Page almost the last, and there he will find, in scarce legible Characters, that Women, notwithstanding the preposterous Behaviour of Mo∣thers, Aunts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Matrimonial Matters, do in Reality think it so great a Misfortune to have their Inclinations in Love thwarted, that they imagine they ought never to carry Enmity higher than upon these Disappointments; again he will find it written, much about the same Place, that a Woman who hath once been pleased with the Possession of a Man, will go above half way to the Devil, to prevent any other Woman from enjoying the same.</P>
<P>If he will not be contented with these Reasons, I freely confess I see no other Motive to the Actions of that Lady, unless we will conceive she was bribed by Lord <HI>Fellamar,</HI> which for my own Part I see no Cause to suspect.</P>
<P>Now this was the Affair which Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> was preparing to introduce to <HI>Sophia,</HI> by some prefatory Discourse on the Folly of Love, and on the Wisdom of legal Prostitution for Hire, when her Brother and <HI>Blifil</HI> broke abruptly upon her; and hence arose all that Coldness in her Behaviour to <HI>Blifil,</HI> which tho' the Squire, as was usual with him, imputed to a wrong Cause, infused into <HI>Blifil</HI> himself, (he being a much more cunning Man,) a Suspicion of the real Truth.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>In which</HI> Jones <HI>pays a Visit to Mrs.</HI> Fitzpatrick.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader may now perhaps be pleased to re∣turn with us to Mr, <HI>Jones,</HI> who at the appoint∣ed Hour attended on Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick;</HI> but before we relate the Conversation which now past, it may be
<PB N="222" REF="227"/>
proper, according to our Method, to return a little back, and to account for so great an Alteration of Behaviour in this Lady, that from changing her Lodging principally to avoid Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> she had now industriously, as hath been seen, sought this Inter∣view.</P>
<P>And here we shall need only to resort to what hap∣pened the preceding Day, when hearing from Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Western</HI> was arrived in Town, she went to pay her Duty to him, at his Lodgings a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Piccadilly,</HI> when she was received with many scurvy Compellations too coarse to be repeated, and was even threatned to be kicked out of Doors. From hence an old Servant of her Aunt <HI>Western,</HI> with whom she was well acquainted, conducted her to the Lodg∣ings of that Lady, who treated her, not more kindly, but more politely; or, to say the Truth, with Rude∣ness in another Way. In short, she returned from both, plainly convinced not only that her Scheme o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Reconciliation had proved abortive, but that she must for ever give over all Thoughts of bringing it about by any Means whatever. From this Moment De∣sire of Revenge only filled her Mind; and in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Temper meeting <HI>Jones</HI> at the Play, an Oppor∣tunity seemed to her to occur of effecting this Pur∣pose.</P>
<P>The Reader must remember, that he was acquaint∣ed by Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> in the Account she gave o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her own Story, with the Fondness Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> had formerly shewn for Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> at <HI>Bath,</HI> from the Disappointment of which, Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> de∣rived the great Bitterness her Aunt had expressed to∣ward her. She had therefore no Doubt but that the good Lady would as easily listen to the Addresses o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> as she had before done to the other, for the Superiority of Charms, was clearly on the side of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> and the Advance which her Aunt had
<PB N="223" REF="228"/>
since made in Age, she concluded (how justly I will not say) was an Argument rather in Favour of her Project than against it.</P>
<P>Therefore, when <HI>Jones</HI> attended after a previous Declaration of her Desire of serving him, arising, as she said from a Firm Assurance how much she should by so doing oblige <HI>Sophia;</HI> and after some Excuses for her former Disappointment, and after acquainting Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> in whose Custody his Mistress was, of which she thought him ignorant; she very explicitly mentioned her Scheme to him, and advised him to make Sham Addresses to the older Lady, in order to procure an easy Access to the Younger, inform∣ing him at the same Time of the Success which Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> had formerly owed to the very same Stra∣tagem.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> exprest great Gratitude to the Lady for the kind Intentions towards him which she had ex∣pressed, and indeed, testified by this Proposal; but besides intimating some Diffidence of Success from the Lady's Knowledge of his Love to her Neice, which had not been her Case in regard to Mr. <HI>Fitz∣patrick,</HI> he said, he was afraid Miss <HI>Western</HI> would never agree to an Imposition of this Kind, as well from her utter Detestation of all Fallacy, as from her avowed Duty to her Aunt.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> was a little nettled at this; and indeed if it may not be called a Lapse of the Tongue, it was a small Deviation from Politeness in <HI>Jones,</HI> and into which he would scarce have fallen, had not the Delight he felt in praising <HI>Sophia,</HI> hurried him out of all Reflection; for this Commendation of one Cousin was more than a tacit Rebuke on the other.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir,' answered the Lady, with some Warmth, 'I cannot think there is any thing easier than to cheat an old Woman with a Profession of
<PB N="224" REF="229"/>
Love, when her Complexion is amorous; and tho' she is my Aunt, I must say, there never was a more liquorish one than her Ladyship. Can't you pretend that the Despair of possessing her Neice, from her being promised to <HI>Blifil,</HI> has made you turn your Thoughts towards her? As to my Cousin <HI>Sophia,</HI> I can't imagine her to be such a Simpleton as to have the least Scruple on such an Account or to conceive any Harm in punishing one of these Haggs for the many Mischiefs they bring upon Fa∣milies, by their Tragi comic Passions; for which I think it is pity they were not punishable by Law. I had no such Scruple myself, and yet I hope my Cousin <HI>Sophia</HI> will not think it an Affront when I say she cannot detest every real Species of Falshood more than her Cousin <HI>Fitzpatrick.</HI> To my Aunt indeed I pretend no Duty, nor doth she deserve any. However, Sir, I have given you my Advice, and if you decline pursuing it, I shall have the less Opinion of your Understanding, that's all.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> now clearly saw the Error he had committed, and exerted his utmost Power to rectify it; but he only faultered and fluttered into Nonsense and Con∣tradiction. To say the Truth, it is often safer to abide by the Consequences of the first Blunder, than to endeavour to rectify it; for by such Endeavours, we generally plunge deeper instead of extricating our∣selves; and few Persons will on such Occasions, have the good Nature, which Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> dis∣play'd to <HI>Jones;</HI> by saying, with a Smile, <Q REND="inline">'You need attempt no more Excuses; for I can easily forgive a real Lover, whatever is the Effect of Fondness for his Mistress.'</Q></P>
<P>She then renewed her Proposal, and very fervently recommended it, omitting no Argument which her Invention could suggest on the Subject; for she was so violently incensed against her Aunt, that scarce any Thing was capable of affording her equal Pleasure
<PB N="225" REF="230"/>
with exposing her, and, like a true Woman, she would see no Difficulties in the Execution of a favou∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite Scheme.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> however persisted in declining the Under∣taking, which had not indeed the least Probability of Success. He easily perceived the Motives which in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uced Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> to be so eager in pressing her Advice. He said he would not deny the tender and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assionate Regard he had for <HI>Sophia;</HI> but was so con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tious of the Inequality of their Situations, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould never flatter himself so far as to hope that so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivine a young Lady would condescend to think on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne so unworthy; nay he protested he could scarce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring himself to wish she should. He concluded with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Profession of generous Sentiments, which we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot at present Leisure to insert.</P>
<P>There are some fine Women (for I dare not here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peak in too general Terms) with whom Self is so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>redominant, that they never detach it from any Sub∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect; and as Vanity is with them a ruling Principle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey are apt to lay hold of whatever Praise they meet with; and, though the Property of others, convey <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to their own Use. In the Company of these La∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies it is impossible to say any thing handsome of ano∣ther Woman, which they will not apply to them∣selves; nay they often improve the Praise they seize; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s for Instance, if her Beauty, her Wit, her Gentili∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, her good Humour deserve so much Commenda∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, what do I deserve who possess those Qualities <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> so much more eminent a Degree?</P>
<P>To these Ladies a Man often recommends him∣self while he is commending another Woman; and while he is expressing Ardour and generous Senti∣ments for his Mistress, they are considering what a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>harming Lover this Man would make to them, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an feel all this Tenderness for an inferiour Degree of Merit. Of this, strange as it may seem, I have
<PB N="226" REF="231"/>
seen many Instances besides Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> to whom all this really happened, and who now began to feel a somewhat for Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> the Symptoms of which she much sooner understood than poor <HI>Sophia</HI> had formerly done.</P>
<P>To say the Truth, perfect Beauty in both Sexes is a more irresistible Object than it is generally thought; for notwithstanding some of us are con∣tented with more homely Lots, and learn by Rot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (as Children to repeat what gives them no Idea) to despise Outside, and to value more solid Charms; yet I have always observed at the Approach of con∣summate Beauty, that these more solid Charms only shine with that Kind of Lustre which the Stars have after the rising of the Sun.</P>
<P>When <HI>Jones</HI> had finished his Exclamations, many of which would have become the Mouth of <HI>Oroondates</HI> himself, Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> heaved a deep Sigh, and taking her Eyes off from <HI>Jones,</HI> on whom they had been some time fixed, and dropping them on the Ground, she cry'd, <Q REND="inline">'Indeed Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> I pity you, but it is the Curse of such Tenderness to be thrown away on those who are insensible of it. I know my Cousin better than you, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> and I must say, any Woman who makes no Return to such a Passion and such a Person, is unworthy of both.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Sure, Madam,</Q> said <HI>Jones,</HI> you can't mean.'—<Q REND="inline">'Mean? cries Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> I know not what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mean; there is something, I think, in true Tender∣ness bewitching; few Women ever meet with it in Men, and fewer still know how to value it when they do. I never heard such truly noble Sentiments, and can't tell how it is, but you force one to believe you. Sure she must be the most contemptible o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Women who can overlook such Merit.'</Q></P>
<P>The Manner and Look with which all this wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spoke infused a Suspicion into <HI>Jones,</HI> which we don'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> care to convey in direct Words to the Reader. In∣stead
<PB N="227" REF="232"/>
of making any Answer, he said, <Q REND="inline">'I am afraid Madam, I have made too tiresome a Visit,'</Q> and offered to take his Leave.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Not at all, Sir,' answered Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick.</HI>—'Indeed I pity you, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> Indeed I do; but if you are going, consider of the Scheme I have men∣tioned, I am convinced you will approve of it, and let me see you again as soon as you can.—To-morrow Morning if you will, or at least some time to-morrow. I shall be at Home all Day.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> then, after many Expressions of Thanks, ve∣ry respectfully retired; nor could Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> forbear making a present of a Look at parting, by which if he had understood nothing, he must have had no Understanding in the Language of the Eyes. In Reality it confirmed his Resolution of returning to her no more; for faulty as he hath appeared in this His∣tory, his whole Thoughts were now so confined to his <HI>Sophia,</HI> that I believe no Woman upon Earth could have now drawn him into an Act of Incon∣stancy.</P>
<P>Fortune however, who was not his Friend, resolv∣ed, as he intended to give her no second Opportunity, to make the best of this; and accordingly produced the tragical Incident which we are now in sorrowful Notes to record.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>The Consequence of the preceding Visit.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> having received the Letter before∣mentioned, from Mrs. <HI>Western,</HI> and being by that Means acquainted with the Place to which his Wife was retired, returned directly to <HI>Bath,</HI> and thence the Day afterwards set forward to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The Reader hath been already often informed of the jealous Temper of this Gentleman. He may
<PB N="228" REF="233"/>
likewise be pleased to remember the Suspicion which he had at <HI>Upton</HI> conceived of <HI>Jones,</HI> upon his finding him in the Room with Mrs. <HI>Waters;</HI> and though sufficient Reasons had afterwards appeared entirely to clear that Suspicion, yet now reading so handsome a Character of Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> from his Wife caused him to reflect that she likewise was in the Inn at the same Time, and jumbled together such a Confusion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Circumstances in a Head which was naturally none o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the clearest, that the whole produced that green-ey'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Monster mentioned by <HI>Shakespear</HI> in his Tragedy o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Othello.</HI></P>
<P>And now as he was enquiring in the Street after his Wife, and had just received Directions to the Door unfortunately Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was issuing from it.</P>
<P><HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> did not yet recollect the Face of <HI>Jones</HI> however seeing a young well-dressed Fellow comin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from his Wife, he made directly up to him, and ask¦ed him what he had been doing in that House: <Q REND="inline">'Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I am sure, said he, you must have been in it, as saw you come out of it.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> answered very modestly, <Q REND="inline">'That he had been visiting a Lady there.'</Q> To which <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> re¦plied, <Q REND="inline">'What Business have you with the Lady?'</Q> Upon which <HI>Jones,</HI> who now perfectly remembre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Voice, Features, and indeed Coat, of the Gentle¦man, cried out,—<Q REND="inline">'Ha, my good Friend! give m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your Hand; I hope there is no ill Blood remaining between us upon a small Mistake which happene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so long ago.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Upon my Soul, Sir, said <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> I don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> know your Name, nor your Face.' Indeed, Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said <HI>Jones,</HI> neither have I the Pleasure of knowing your Name, but your Face I very well remember to have seen before, at <HI>Upton,</HI> where a foolish Quar¦rel happened between us, which, if it is not mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up yet, we will now makeup over a Bottle.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="234"/>
<Q REND="inline">'At <HI>Upton!</HI> cried the other.</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Ha! upon my Soul, I believe your Name is <HI>Jones.'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed' answered he, 'it is.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'O, upon my Soul, cries <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> you are the very Man I wanted to meet.—Upon my Soul I will drink a Bottle with you presently; but first I will give you a great Knock over the Pate. There is for you, you Rascal. Upon my Soul, if you do not give me Satisfaction for that Blow, I will give you another.'</Q> And then drawing his word, puts himself in a Posture of Defence, which as the only Science he understood.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> was a little staggered by the Blow which came me what unexpectedly; but presently recovering himself he also drew, and tho' he understood nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Fencing, prest on so boldly upon <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at down his Guard, and sheathed one half of his word in the Body of the said Gentleman, who had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sooner received it than he stept backwards, dropt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Point of his Sword, and leaning upon it, cried, <Q REND="inline">'I have Satisfaction enough; I am a dead Man.'</Q></P>
<P>I hope not, cries <HI>Jones,</HI> but whatever be the Con∣sequence you must be sensible you have drawn it up∣on yourself. At this Instant a Number of Fellows rushed in and seized <HI>Jones,</HI> who told them he should make no Resistance, and begged some of them at least would take Care of the wounded Gentleman.'</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Ay, cries one of the Fellows, the wounded Gen∣tleman will be taken Care enough of; for I suppose he hath not many Hours to live. As for you, Sir, you have a Month at least good yet.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'D—n me, <HI>Jack,</HI> said another, he hath prevented his Voyage; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he's bound to another Port now;'</Q> and many other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Jests was our poor <HI>Jones</HI> made the Subject of, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ese Fellows, who were indeed the Gang employed Lord <HI>Fellamar,</HI> and had dogged him into the House Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> waiting for him at the Corner of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Street when this unfortunate Accident happened.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="235"/>
The Officer who commanded this Gang very wise¦ly concluded, that his Business was now to deliver his Prisoner into the Hands of the Civil Magistrate. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ordered him therefore to be carried to a publick House where having sent for a Constable, he delivered him to his Custody.</P>
<P>The Constable seeing Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> very well dres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and hearing that the Accident had happened in a Due<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> treated his Prisoner with great Civility, and at hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Request, dispatched a Messenger to enquire after th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wounded Gentleman, who was now at a Tavern un¦der the Surgeon's Hands. The Report brought bac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was that the Wound was certainly mortal, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> were no Hopes of Life. Upon which the Constabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> informed <HI>Jones,</HI> that he must go before a Justice▪ He answered, Wherever you please; I am indifferen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as to what happens to me, for tho' I am convince<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I am not guilty of Murder in the Eye of the Law yet the Weight of Blood I find intolerable upon m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mind.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> was now conducted before the Justice, when the Surgeon who drest Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> appeared, an deposed that he believed the Wound to be mortal upon which the Prisoner was committed to the <HI>Gat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> house.</HI> It was very late at Night, so that <HI>Jones</HI> would not send for <HI>Partridge</HI> till the next Morning and as he never shut his Eyes till seven, so it was ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> twelve before the poor Fellow, who was great frightned at not hearing from his Master so long, re¦ceived a Message which almost deprived him of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Being, when he heard it.</P>
<P>He went to the <HI>Gate-house</HI> with trembling Kne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and a beating Heart, and was no sooner arrived in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Presence of <HI>Jones,</HI> than he lamented the Misfortune that had befallen him with many Tears, looking the while frequently about him in great Terror; f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as the News now arrived that Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>This I faithfully promise, that notwithstanding any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffection which we may be supposed to have for this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogue, whom we have unfortunately made our He∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, we will lend him none of that supernatural Assis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce with which we are entrusted, upon Condition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we use it only on very important Occasions. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he doth not therefore find some natural Means of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> extricating himself from all his Distresses, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill do no Violence to the Truth and Dignity of His∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y for his Sake; for we had rather relate that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as hanged at <HI>Tyburn</HI> (which may very probably be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Case) than forfeit our Integrity, or shock the Faith of our Reader.</P>

An Alliance between two Fa∣milies so nearly Neighbours, and between whom there had always existed so mutual an Intercourse and good Harmony, I thought a most desireable Event; and with Regard to the young Lady, not only the concurrent Opinion of all who knew her, but my own Observation assured me that she would be an inestimable Treasure to a good Husband. I shall say nothing of her personal Qualifications, which certainly are admirable; her Good-nature, her cha∣ritable Disposition, her Modesty are too well known to need any Panegyric: but she hath one Quality which existed in a high Degree in that best of Wo∣men, who is now one of the first Angels, which as it is not of a glaring Kind, more commonly es∣capes Observation; so little indeed is it remarked, that I want a Word to express it. I must use Ne∣gatives on this Occasion. I never heard any thing of Pertness, or what is called a Repartee out of her Mouth; no Pretence to Wit, much less to that Kind of Wisdom, which is the Result only of great Learning and Experience; the Affectation of which, in a Woman, is as absurd as any of the Affectations of an Ape. No dictatorial Sentiments, no judicial Opinions, no profound Criticisms. Whenever I have seen her in the Company of Men, she hath been all Attention, with the Modesty of a Learn∣er,

not the Forwardness of a Teacher. You'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pardon me for it, but I once, to try her only, de¦sired her Opinion on a Point which was controvert¦ed between Mr. <HI>Thwackum</HI> and <HI>Square,</HI>'</Q> To which she answered with much Sweetness, <Q REND="inline">'You will pardon me, good Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> I am sure yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cannot in Earnest think me capable of deciding any Point in which two such Gentlemen disagree.'</Q> <HI>Thwackum</HI> and <HI>Square,</HI> who both alike though themselves sure of a favourable Decision, seconded my Request.

<P>Here <HI>Blifil</HI> sighed bitterly; upon which <HI>Western</HI> whose Eyes were full of Tears at the Praise of <HI>So¦phia,</HI> blubbered out, <Q REND="inline">'Don't be Chicken-hearted for shat ha her, d—n me, shat ha her, if she was twenty Times as good.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Remember your Promise, Sir, cried <HI>Allworthy,</HI> I was not to be interrupted.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Well, shat unt, answered the Squire, I won't speak another Word.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Now, my good Friend,' continued <HI>Allworthy</HI> I have dwelt so long on the Merit of this young Lady, partly as I really am in Love with her Cha∣racter, and partly that Fortune (for the Match in that Light is really advantageous on my Nephew's Side) might not be imagined to be my principal View in having so eagerly embraced the Proposal. In∣deed I heartily wished to receive so great a Jewel into my Family; but tho' I may wish for many good Things, I would not therefore steal them, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be guilty of any Violence or Injustice to possess
<PB N="243" REF="248"/>
myself of them. Now to force a Woman into a Marriage contrary to her consent or Approbation, is an Act of such Injustice and Oppression, that I wish the Laws of our Country could restrain it; but a good Conscience is never lawless in the worst regu∣lated State, and will provide those Laws for itself, which the Neglect of Legislators hath forgotten to supply. This is surely a Case of that Kind; for is it not cruel, nay impious, to force a Woman into that State against her Will; for her Behaviour in which she is to be accountable to the highest and most dreadful Court of Judicature, and to answer at the Peril of her Soul. To discharge the Matrimo∣nial Duties in an adequate Manner is no easy Task, and shall we lay this Burthen upon a Woman while we at the same Time deprive her of all that Assist∣ance which may enable her to undergo it? Shall we tear her very Heart from her, while we enjoin her Duties to which a whole Heart is scarce equal. I must speak very plainly here, I think Parents who act in this Manner are Accessaries to all the Guilt which their Children afterwards incur, and of Course must, before a just Judge, expect to partake of their Punishment; but if they could avoid this, good Heaven! is there a Soul who can bear the Thought of having contributed to the Damnation of his Child?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'For these Reasons, my best Neighbour, as I see the Inclinations of this young Lady are most unhap∣pily averse to my Nephew, I must decline any fur∣ther Thoughts of the Honour you intended him, tho' I assure you I shall always retain the most grateful Sense of it.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Well, Sir, said <HI>Western,</HI> (the Froth bursting forth from his Lips the Moment they were uncorked) you cannot say but I have heard you out, and now I expect you'll hear me; and if I don't answer eve∣ry Word o't, why then I'll consent to gee the Mat∣ter

They say indeed it is a wise Father that knows his own Child; but I am sure I have the best Title to her, for I bred her up. But I believe you will allow me to be her Father, and if I be, am not I to govern my own Child? I ask you that, am I not to govern my own Child? And if I am to govern her in other Matters, surely I am to govern her in this which concerns her most. And what am I desiring all this while? Am I de∣siring her to do any Thing for me?

<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> resented this Reflection only with a Smile; nor could he, if he would have endeavoured it, have conveyed into that Smile any Mixture of Malice or Contempt. His Smiles at Folly were indeed such as we may suppose the Angels bestow on the Absurdities of Mankind.</P>

Lady, I am sure I shall never consent to it. My Conscience will not permit me to use Violence on any one, much less on a Lady for whom, however cruel she is to me, I shall always preserve the purest and sincerest Affection; but yet I have read, that Women are seldom Proof against Perseverance. Why may I not hope then by such Perseverance at last to gain those Inclinations, in which for the fu∣ture I shall, perhaps, have no Rival; for as for this Lord, Mr. <HI>Western</HI> is so kind to prefer me to him; and sure, Sir, you will not deny but that a Parent hath at least a negative Voice in these Matters; nay I have heard this very young Lady herself say so more than once, and declare, that she thought Children inexcusable who married in direct Opposi∣tion to the Will of their Parents. Besides, though the other Ladies of the Family seem to favour the Pretensions of my Lord, I do not find the Lady herself is inclined to give him any Countenance; alas, I am too sensible that wickedest of Men re∣mains uppermost in her Heart.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Ay, ay, so he does, cries <HI>Western.</HI>'</Q></P>

There will be Nobody but ourselves, unless we have a Mind to have the Landlord; for I have sent Parson <HI>Supple</HI> down to <HI>Basingstoke</HI> after my Tobacco Box, which I left at an Inn there, and I would not lose it for the World; for it's an old Acquaintance of above Twenty Years standing. I can tell you Landlord is a vast comical Bitch, you will like un hugely.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> at last agreed to this Invitation, and soon after the Squire went off, singing and capering at the Hopes of seeing the speedy tragical End of poor <HI>Jones.</HI></P>
<P>When he was gone, Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> resumed the aforesaid Subject with much Gravity. He told his Nephew, <Q REND="inline">'he wished with all his Heart he would en∣deavour to conquer a Passion, in which I cannot,;' says he, 'flatter you with the Hopes of succeeding. It is certainly a vulgar Error, that Aversion in a Woman may be conquered by Perseverance. In∣difference may, Perhaps, sometimes yield to it; but the usual Triumphs gained by Perseverance in a Lover, are over Caprice, Prudence, Affectation, and often an exorbitant Degree of Levity, which excites Women not overwarm, in their Constitu∣tions, to indulge their Vanity by prolonging the Time of Courtship, even when they are well e∣nough pleased with the Object, and resolve (if they
<PB N="247" REF="252"/>
ever resolve at all) to make him a very pitiful A∣mends in the End. But a fixed Dislike, as I am afraid this is, will rather gather Strength, than be conquered by Time. Besides, my dear, I have a∣nother Apprehension which you must excuse. I am afraid this Passion which you have for this fine young Creature, hath her beautiful Person too much for its Object, and is unworthy of the Name of that Love, which is the only Foundation of matrimonial Felicity. To admire, to like, and to long for the Possession of a beautiful Woman, without any Re∣gard to her Sentiments towards us, is, I am afraid, too natural: But Love, I believe, is the Child of Love only; at least, I am pretty confident, that to love the Creature who we are assured hates us, is not in Human Nature. Examine your Heart, there∣fore, thoroughly, my good Boy, and if, upon Examination, you have but the least Suspicion of this Kind, I am sure your own Virtue and Religion will impel you to drive so vicious a Passion from your Heart, and your good Sense will soon enable you to do it without Pain.'</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>An extraordinary Scene betwen</HI> Sophia <HI>and her Aunt.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE lowing Heifer, and the bleating Ewe in Herds and Flocks, may ramble safe and un∣regarded through the Pastures. These are, indeed, hereafter doomed to be the Prey of Man; yet many Years are they suffered to enjoy their Liberty undis∣turbed. But if a plump Doe be discovered to have es∣caped
<PB N="248" REF="253"/>
from the Forest, and to repose herself in some Field or Grove, the whole Parish is presently alarm∣ed, every Man is ready to set his Dogs after her; and if she is preserved from the rest by the good Squire, it is only that he may secure her for his own eating.</P>
<P>I have considered a very fine young Woman of Fortune and Fashion, when first found strayed from the Pale of her Nursery, to be in pretty much the same Situation with this Doe. The Town is immediately in an Uproar, she is hunted from Park to Play, from Court to Assembly, from Assembly to her own Chamber, and rarely escapes a single Season from the Jaws of some Devourer or other: For if her Friends protect her from some, it is only to deliver her over to one of their own chusing, often more disagreeable to her than any of the rest: While whole Herds on Flocks of other Women securely, and scarce regard∣ed, traverse the Park, the Play, the Opera, and the Assembly; and though, for the most Part at least, they are at last devoured, yet for a long Time do they wanton in Liberty, without Disturbance or Controul.</P>
<P>Of all these Paragons, none ever tasted more of this Persecution than poor <HI>Sophia.</HI> Her ill Stars were not contented with all that she had suffered on Account of <HI>Blifil,</HI> they now raised her another Pursuer, who seemed likely to torment her no less than the other had done. For though her Aunt was less violent, she was no less assiduous in teazing her, than her Father had been before.</P>
<P>The Servants were no sooner departed after Dinner than Mrs. <HI>Western,</HI> who had opened the Matter to <HI>Sophia,</HI> informed her, <Q REND="inline">'That she expected his Lord∣ship that very afternoon, and intended to take the first Opportunity of leaving her alone with him.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'If you do, Madam,' answered <HI>Sophia,</HI> with some Spirit, 'I shall take the first Opportunity of leaving him by himself.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">' 'How! Madam!' cries the Aunt;
<PB N="249" REF="254"/>
is this the Return you make me for my Kindness, in relieving you from your Confinement at your Fa∣ther's?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'You know, Madam,' said <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'the Cause of that Confinement was a Refusal to com∣ply with my Father, in accepting a Man I detested; and will my dear Aunt who hath relieved me from that Distress, involve me in another equally bad?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'And do you think then, Madam,' answered Mrs. <HI>Western,</HI> 'that there is no Difference between my Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> and Mr. <HI>Blifil?'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'Very little, in my Opinion,' cries <HI>Sophia;</HI> 'and if I must be con∣demned to one, I would certainly have the Merit of sacrificing myself to my Father's Pleasure.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Then my Pleasure I find,' said the Aunt, 'hath very little Weight with you; but that consideration shall not move me. I act from nobler Motives. The View of aggrandizing my Family, of ennobling yourself is what I proceed upon. Have you no Sense of Ambition? Are there no Charms in the Thoughts of having a Coronet on your Coach?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'None, up∣on my Honour,' said <HI>Sophia.</HI> 'A Pincushion upon my Coach would please me just as well.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Never mention Honour,' cries the Aunt. 'It becomes not the Mouth of such a Wretch. I am sorry, Neice, you force me to use these Words; but I cannot bear your groveling Temper; you have none of the Blood of the <HI>Westerns</HI> in you. But however mean and base your own Ideas are, you shall bring no Imputation on mine. I will never suffer the World to say of me, that I encouraged you in refusing one of the best Matches in <HI>England;</HI> a Match which, besides its Advantage in Fotrune, would do Honour to almost any Family, and hath indeed, in Title, the Advan∣tage of ours.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Surely,' says <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'I am born deficient, and have not the Senses with which o∣ther People are blessed: There must be certainly some Sense which can relish the Delights of Sound and Show, which I have not: For surely Mankind
<PB N="250" REF="255"/>
would not labour so much, nor sacrifice so much for obtaining; nor would they be so elate and proud with possessing what appeared to them as it doth to me, the most insignificant of all Trifles.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'No, no, Miss;' cries the Aunt; 'you are born with as many Senses as other People; but I assure you, you are not born with a sufficient Understand∣ing to make a Fool of me, or to expose my Con∣duct to the World. So I declare this to you upon my Word, and you know, I believe, how fixed my Resolutions are, unless you agree to see his Lord∣ship this Afternoon, I will, with my own Hands, deliver you To-morrow Morning to my Brother, and will never henceforth interfere with you, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> see your Face again.'</Q> <HI>Sophia</HI> stood a few Moments silent after this Speech, which was uttered in a most angry and Peremptory Tone; and then bursting in∣to Tears, she cry'd, <Q REND="inline">'Do with me, Madam, what∣ever you please; I am the most miserable, undone Wretch upon Earth; and if my dear Aunt forsakes me, where shall I look for a Protector?—My dear Neice,' cries she, 'you will have a very good Protector in his Lordship; a Protector, whom no∣thing but a Hankering after that vile Fellow <HI>Jones</HI> can make you decline.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Madam,' said <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'you wrong me. How can you imagine after what you have shewn me, if I had ever any such Thoughts, that I should not banish them for¦ever. If it will satisfy you, I will receive the Sa∣crament upon it, never to see his Face again.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'But Child, dear Child,' said the Aunt, 'be reasonable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Can you invent a single Objection?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'I have alrea∣dy, I think, told you a sufficient Objection, answered <HI>Sophia.</HI>'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'What?' cries the Aunt; 'I remember none.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Sure, Madam,' said <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'I told you he had used me in the rudest and vilest Manner.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'In∣deed Child,' answered she, 'I never heard you, or did not understand you:—But what do you mean by
<PB N="251" REF="256"/>
this rude and vile Manner?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Madam,' says <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'I am almost ashamed to tell you. He caught me in his Arms, and pulled me down on the Settee, and thrust his Hand into my Bosom, and kissed it with such Violence, that I have the Mark upon my left Breast at this Moment.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Indeed!'</Q> said Mrs. <HI>Western.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'Yes indeed, Ma∣dam,' answered <HI>Sophia;</HI> 'my Father luckily came in at that Instant, or Heaven knows what Rude∣ness he intended to have proceeded to.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I am astonished and confounded,' cries the Aunt. 'No Woman of the Name of <HI>Western</HI> hath been ever treated so, since we were a Family. I would have torn the Eyes of a Prince out, if he had attempted such Freedoms with me. It is impossible: Sure, <HI>Sophia,</HI> you must invent this to raise my Indigna∣tion against him.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I hope, Madam,' said <HI>So∣phia,</HI> 'you have too good an Opinion of me, to imagine me capable of telling an Untruth. Upon my Soul it is true.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I should have stabbed him to the Heart had I been present,' returned the Aunt. Yet surely he could have no dishonourable Design: It is impossible; he durst not: Besides his Propo∣sals shew he had not; for they are not only honour∣able but generous. I don't know; the Age al∣lows too great Freedoms. A distant Salute is all I would have allowed before the Ceremony. I have had Lovers formerly, not so long ago nei∣ther; several Lovers, tho' I never would consent to Marriage, and I never encouraged the least Freedom. It is a foolish Custom, and what I never would agree to. No Man kissed more of me than my Cheek. It is as much as one can bring one's self to give Lips up to a Husband; and, indeed, could I ever have been persuaded to marry, I believe I should not have been brought to endure so much.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'You will pardon me, dear Madam,' said <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'if I make one Observation: You own you had many Lovers,

You are now but a young Women, and I am convinced would not promise to yield to the first Lover of Fortune, nay, or of Title too.

<P>Thus <HI>Sophia</HI> by a little well directed Flattery, for which surely none will blame her, obtained a little Ease for herself, and, at least, put off the evil Day.

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>Mrs.</HI> Miller <HI>and Mr.</HI> Nightingale <HI>visit</HI> Jones <HI>in the Prison.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> and his Nephew went to meet Mr. <HI>Western,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> set fowards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o her Son-in-Law's Lodgings, in order to acquaint <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im with the Accident which had befallen his Friend <HI>Jones;</HI> but he had known it long before from <HI>Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ridge,</HI> (for <HI>Jones,</HI> when he left Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> had been furnished with a Room in the same House with Mr. <HI>Nightingale.)</HI> The good Woman found her Daugh∣ter under great Affliction on Account of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> whom having comforted as well as she could, she set forwards to the Gatehouse where he was, and where Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> was arrived before her.</P>
<P>The Firmness and Constancy of a true Friend is Circumstance so extremely delightful to Persons in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny Kind of Distress, that the Distress itself, if it be only temporary and admits of Relief, is more than compensated by bringing this Comfort with it. Nor
<PB N="254" REF="259"/>
are Instances of this Kind so rare, as some superficial and inaccurate Observers have reported. To say the Truth, Want of Compassion is not to be numbered among our general Faults. The black Ingredien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which fouls our Disposition is Envy. Hence our Eye is seldom, I am afraid, turned upward to those who are manifestly greater, better, wiser, or happie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than ourselves, without some Degree of Malignity; while we commonly look down on the Mean and Miserable, with sufficient Benevolence and Pity. In Fact, I have remarked, that most of the Defects which have discovered themselves within my Obser∣vation have arisen from Envy only; a hellish Vice; and yet one from which I have known very few ab∣solutely exempt. But enough of a Subject which, if pursued, would lead me too far.</P>
<P>Whether it was that Fortune was apprehensive lest <HI>Jones</HI> should sink under the Weight of his Adversity, and that she might thus lose the Opportunity of tor∣menting him; or whether she really abated somewhat of her Severity towards him, she seemed a little to relax her Persecution, by sending him the Company of two such faithful Friends, and what is perhaps more rare, a faithful Servant. For <HI>Partridge,</HI> tho' he had many Imperfections, wanted not Fidelity; and tho' Fear would not suffer him to be hanged for his Master, yet the World, I believe, could not have bribed him to desert his Cause.</P>
<P>While <HI>Jones</HI> was expressing great Satsfaction in the Presence of his Friends, <HI>Partridge</HI> brought an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Account that Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> was still alive, tho' the Surgeon declared that he had very little Hopes. Upon which <HI>Jones</HI> fetching a deep Sigh, <HI>Nightingale</HI> said to him; <Q REND="inline">'My dear <HI>Tom,</HI> why should you afflict yourself so upon an Accident, which, whatever be the Con∣sequence, can be attended with no Danger to you, and in which your Conscience cannot accuse you of

having been in the least to blame. If the Fellow should die, what have you done more than taken away the Life of a Ruffian in your own Defence? So will the Coroner's Inquest find it; and then you will be easily admitted to Bail: And though you must undergo the Form of a Trial, yet it is a Trial which many Men would stand for you for a Shilling.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Come, come, Mr. <HI>Jones,'</HI> says Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> 'cheer yourself up. I knew you could not be the Aggres∣sor, and so I told Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and so he shall acknowledge too before I have done with him.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> gravely answered, <Q REND="inline">'That whatever might be his Fate, he should always lament the having shed the Blood of one of his Fellow-Creatures, as one the highest Misfortunes which could have befallen him. But I have another Misfortune of the ten∣derest Kind—O! Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> I have lost what I held most dear upon Earth.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'That must be a Mistress,' said Mrs. <HI>Miller.</HI> 'But come, come; I know more than you imagine;' (for indeed <HI>Par∣ridge</HI> had blabbed all) 'and I have heard more than you know. Matters go better, I promise you, than you think; and I would not give <HI>Blifil</HI> Six∣pence for all the Chance which he hath of the Lady.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Indeed, my dear Friend, indeed,' answered <HI>Jones,</HI> you are an entire Stranger to the Cause of my Grief. If you was acquainted with the Story, you wou'd allow my Case admitted of no Comfort. I apprehend no Danger from <HI>Blifil.</HI> I have un∣done myself.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Don't Despair,' replied Mrs. <HI>Mil∣r;</HI> 'you know what a Woman can do, and if any Thing be in my Power, I promise you I will do it to serve you. It is my Duty.

I will say any Thing to her you would have me say.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Thou best of Women,' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> taking her by the Hand; 'talk not of Obligations to me;—but as you have been so kind to mention it, there is a Favour which, perhaps, may be in your Pow∣er. I see you are acquainted with the Lady (how you came by your Information I know not) who sits indeed very near my Heart. If you could contrive to deliver this, (giving her a Paper from his Pocket) I shall for ever acknowledge your Goodness.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Give it me,' said Mrs. <HI>Miller.</HI> 'If I see it not in her own Possession before I sleep may my next Sleep be my last.

<P><Q REND="inline">'Believe me, Madam,' said he, 'I do not speak the common Cant of one in my unhappy Situati∣on. Before this dreadful Accident happened, P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had resolved to quit a Life of which I was become sensible of the Wickedness as well as Folly. I do assure you notwithstanding the Disturbances I have unfortunately occasioned in your House, for which I heartily ask your Pardon, I am not an abandoned Profligate. Though I have been hurried into Vi∣ces, I do not approve a vicious Character; not will I ever, from this Moment, deserve it.'</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> expressed great Satisfaction in these Declarations, in the Sincerity of which she averred she had an entire Faith; and now, the Remainder of the Conversation past in the joint Attempts of that good Woman and Mr. <HI>Nightingale,</HI> to cheer the dejected Spirits of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> in which they so well succeed∣ed, as to leave him much better comforted and sa∣tisfied than they found him; to which happy Alte∣ration
<PB N="257" REF="262"/>
nothing so much contributed as the kind Un∣dertaking of Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> to deliver his Letter to <HI>So∣phia,</HI> which he despaired of finding any Means to ac∣complish: For when <HI>Black George</HI> produced the last from <HI>Sophia,</HI> he informed <HI>Partridge,</HI> that she had strictly charged him, on pain of having it communicated to her Father, not to bring her any Answer. He was moreover not a little pleased, to find he had so warm an Advocate to Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> himself in this good Woman, who was in Reality one of the wor∣thiest Creatures in the World.</P>
<P>After about an Hour's Visit from the Lady, (for <HI>Nightingale</HI> had been with him much longer,) they both took their leave, promising to return to him soon; during which Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> said, she hoped to bring him some good News from his Mistress, and Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> promised to enquire into the State of Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick'</HI>s Wound, and likewise to find out some of the Persons who were present at the Rencounter.</P>

<P>When <HI>Betty</HI> was departed, Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> said, <Q REND="inline">'I was desired, Madam, by a very unhappy young Gentleman to deliver you this Letter.'</Q> <HI>Sophia</HI> changed Colour when she saw the Direction, well knowing the Hand, and after some Hesitation, said—<Q REND="inline">'I could not conceive, Madam, from your Appearance, that your Business had been of such a Nature.—Whomever you brought this Letter from I shall not open it. I should be sorry to en∣tertain an unjust Suspicion of any one; but you are an utter Stranger to me.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'If you will have Patience, Madam,' answered Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> 'I will acquaint you who I am, and how I came by that Letter.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I have no Curio∣sity, Madam, to know any thing, cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> but I must insist on your delivering that Letter back to the Person who gave it you.'</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> then fell upon her Knees, and in the most passionate Terms, implored her Compassion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to which <HI>Sophia,</HI> answered: <Q REND="inline">'Sure, Madam, it is surprizing you should be so very strongly interested in the Behalf of this Person. I would not think Madam'—'No, Madam,' says Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> you shall not think any thing but the Truth. I will tell you all, and you will not wonder that I am interested. He is the best natured Creature tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ever was born.'</Q>—She then began and related the Story of Mr. <HI>Henderson—</HI>After this she cried <Q REND="inline">'This, Madam, this is his Goodness; but I have much more tender Obligations to him. He hath pre¦served my Child.'</Q>—Here after shedding some Tears, she related every thing concerning that Fact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="259" REF="264"/>
suppressing only those Circumstances which would have most reflected on her Daughter, and concluded with saying, <Q REND="inline">'Now, Madam, you shall judge whether I can ever do enough for so kind, so good, so generous a young Man, and sure he is the best and worthiest of all Human Beings.'</Q></P>
<P>The Alteration in the Countenance of <HI>Sophia</HI> had hitherto been chiefly to her Disadvantage, and had inclined her Complexion to too great Paleness; but she now waxed redder if possible, than Vermilion, <Q REND="inline">'and cry'd, I know not what to say, certainly what arises from Gratitude cannot be blamed.—But what Service can my reading his Letter do your Friend, since I am resolved never—'</Q> Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> fell again to her Entreaties, and begged to be forgiven, but she could not, she said, carry it back. <Q REND="inline">'Well, Madam,' says <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'I cannot help it, if you will force it upon me—Certainly you may leave it whether I will or no.'</Q> What <HI>Sophia</HI> meant, or whether she meant any thing, I will not presume to determine; but Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> actually understood this as a Hint, and presently laying the Letter down on the Table took her Leave, having first begged Per∣mission to wait again on <HI>Sophia,</HI> which Request had neither Assent nor Denial.</P>
<P>The Letter lay upon the Table no longer than till Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> was out of Sight; for then <HI>Sophia</HI> opened and read it.</P>
<P>This Letter did very little Service to his Cause; for it consisted of little more than Confessions of his own Unworthiness, and bitter Lamentations of Despair, together with the most solemn Protestations of his un∣alterable Fideilty to <HI>Sophia,</HI> of which he said, he hoped to convince her if he had ever more the Honour of be∣ing admitted to her Presence; and that he could ac∣count for the Letter to Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> in such a Man∣ner, that though it would not intitle him to her For∣giveness, he hoped at least to obtain it from her Mercy.
<PB N="260" REF="265"/>
And concluded with vowing that nothing was ever less in his Thoughts than to marry Lady <HI>Bellaston.</HI></P>
<P>Though <HI>Sophia</HI> read the Letter twice over with great Attention, his Meaning still remained a Riddle to her, nor could her Invention suggest to her any Means to Excuse <HI>Jones.</HI> She certainly remained very angry with him, though indeed Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> took up so much of her Resentment that her gentle Mind had but little left to bestow on any other Person.</P>
<P>That Lady was most unluckily to dine this very Day with her Aunt <HI>Western,</HI> and in the Afternoon, they were all three by Appointment to go together to the Opera, and thence to Lady <HI>Thomas Hatchet'</HI>s Drum. <HI>Sophia</HI> would have gladly been excused from all, but she would not disoblige her Aunt; and as to the Arts of counterfeiting Illness, she was so entirely a Stranger to them, that it never once entered into her Head. When she was drest, therefore, down she went, resolved to encounter all the Horrours of the Day, and a most disagreeable one it proved; for La∣dy <HI>Bellaston</HI> took every Opportunity very civilly and slily to insult her; to all which her Dejection of Spi∣rits disabled her from making any Return; and indeed, to confess the Truth, she was at the very best but an different Mistress of Repartee.</P>
<P>Another Misfortune which befel <HI>Sophia,</HI> was the Company of Lord <HI>Fellamar,</HI> whom she met at the Opera, and who attended her to the Drum. And though both Places were too publick to admit of any Particularities, and she was farther relieved by the Mu∣sick at the one Place and by the Cards at the other, she could not however enjoy herself in his Company: for there is something of Delicacy in Women, which will not suffer them to be even easy in the Presence of a Man whom they know to have Pretensions to them, which they are disinclined to favour.</P>
<P>Having in this Chapter twice mentioned a Drum, a Word which our Posterity, it is hoped, will not
<PB N="261" REF="266"/>
understand in the Sense it is here applied, we shall, notwithstanding our present Haste, stop a Moment to describe the Entertainment here meant, and the rather as we can in a Moment describe it.</P>
<P>A Drum then is an Assembly of well dressed Per∣sons of both Sexes, most of whom play at Cards, and the rest do nothing at all; while the Mistress of the House performs the Part of a Landlady at an Inn, and like the Landlady of an Inn prides herself in the Number of her Guests, though she doth not always, like her, get any thing by it.</P>
<P>No wonder then as so much Spirits must be re∣quired to support any Vivacity in these Scenes of Dul∣ness, that we hear Persons of Fashion eternally com∣plaining of the Want of them; a Complaint con∣fined entirely to upper Life. How insupportable must we imagine this Round of Impertinence to have been to <HI>Sophia,</HI> at this time; how difficult must she have found it to force the Appearance of Gaiety in∣to her Looks, when her Mind dictated nothing but the tenderest Sorrow, and when every Thought was charged with tormenting Ideas.</P>
<P>Night, however at last, restored her to her Pillow, where we will leave her to soothe her Melancholy at¦least, though incapable we are afraid of Rest, and shall pursue our History, which something whispers us is now arrived at the Eve of some great Event.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>A pathetic Scene between Mr.</HI> Allworthy <HI>and Mrs.</HI> Miller.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. <HI>Miller</HI> had a long Discourse with Mr. <HI>All∣worthy</HI> at his Return from his Dinner, in which she accquainted him with <HI>Jones'</HI>s having unfortunately lost all which he was pleased to bestow on him at their Separation; and with the Distresses to which that Loss had subjected him; of all which she had received
<PB N="263" REF="267"/>
a full Account from the faithful Retailer <HI>Partridge.</HI> She then explained the Obligations she had to <HI>Jones;</HI> not that she was entirely explicite with regard to her Daughter; for though she had the utmost. Confidence in Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and though there could be no Hopes of keeping an Affair secret, which was un∣happily known to more than half a Dozen; yet she could not prevail with herself to mention those Cir∣cumstances which reflected most on the Chastity of poor <HI>Nancy;</HI> but smothered that Part of her Evidence as cautiously as if she had been before a Judge, and the Girl was now on her Trial for the Murder of a Bastard.</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> said, there were few Characters so ab∣solutely vicious as not to have the least Mixture of Good in them. <Q REND="inline">'However,' says he, 'I cannot deny but that you had some Obligations to the Fel∣low, bad as he is, and I shall therefore Excuse what has past already, but must insist you never mention his Name to me more; for I promise you it was upon the fullest and plainest Evidence that I resolved to take the Measures I have taken.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Well, Sir, says she, I make not the least doubt, but Time will shew all Matters in their true and natural Colours, and that you will be convinced this poor young Man deserves better of you than some other Folks that shall be nameless.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Madam,' cries <HI>Allworthy,</HI> a little ruffled, 'I will not hear any Reflections on my Nephew, and if you ever say a Word more of that Kind, I will de∣part from your House that Instant. He is the wor∣thiest and best of Men; and I once more repeat it to you, he hath carried his Friendship to this Man to a blameable Length, by too long concealing Facts of the blackest Die. The Ingratitude of the Wretch to this good young Man is what I most re∣sent; for, Madam, I have the greatest Reason to
<PB N="262" REF="268"/>
imagine he had laid a Plot to supplant my Nephew in my Favour, and to have disinherited him.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I am sure, Sir,' answered Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> a little frightened (for though Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had the utmost Sweetness and Benevolence in his Smiles, he had great Terror in his Frowns) 'I shall never speak a∣gainst any Gentlemen you are pleased to think well of. I am sure, Sir, such Behaviour would very little become me, especially when the Gentleman is your nearest Relation; but, Sir, you must not be angry with me, you must not indeed, for my good Wishes to this poor Wretch. Sure, I may call him so now, though once you would have been angry with me, if I had spoke of him with the least Disrespect. How often have I heard you call him your Son? How often have you prattled to me of him with all the Fondness of a Parent? Nay, Sir, I cannot forget the many tender Expressions, the many good Things you have told me of his Beauty, and his Parts, and his Virtues: of his Good-nature and Ge∣nerosity.—I am sure, Sir, I cannot forget them: For I find them all true. I have experienced them in my own Cause. They have preserved my Fa∣mily. You must pardon my Tears, Sir, indeed you must, when I consider the cruel Reverse of Fortune which this poor Youth, to whom I am so much obliged, hath suffered; when I consider the Loss of your Favour, which I know he valued more than his Life, I must, I must lament him. If you had a Dagger in your Hand, ready to plunge into my Heart, I must lament the Misery of one whom you have loved, and I shall ever love.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> was pretty much moved with this Speech, but it seemed not to be with Anger: For after a short Silence, taking Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> by the Hand, he said very affectionately to her; <Q REND="inline">'Come, Madam, let us consider a little about your Daughter. I cannot blame you, for rejoicing in a Match which pro∣mises
<PB N="264" REF="269"/>
to be advantageous to her; but you know this Advantage, in a great Measure, depends on the Father's Reconciliation. I know Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> very well, and have formerly had Concerns with him; I will make him a Visit, and endeavour to serve you in this Matter. I believe he is a worldly Man; but as this is an only Son, and the Thing is now irretrievable, perhaps he may in Time be brought to Reason. I promise you I will do all I can for you.'</Q></P>
<P>Many were the Acknowledgments which the poor Woman made to <HI>Allworthy,</HI> for this Kind and gene∣rous Offer, nor could she refrain from taking this Occasion again to express her Gratitude towards <HI>Jones,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'to whom said she, I owe the Opportunity of giving you, Sir, this present Trouble.'</Q> <HI>Allworthy</HI> gently stop∣ped her; but he was too good a Man to be really of∣fended with the Effects of so noble a Principle as now actuated Mrs. <HI>Miller;</HI> and indeed had not this new Affair inflamed his former Anger against <HI>Jones,</HI> it is possible he might have been a little softened towards him by the Report of an Action which Malice itself could not have derived from an evil Motive.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> had been above an Hour together, when their Conversation was put an End to by the Arrival of <HI>Blifil,</HI> and another Person, which other Person was no less than Mr. <HI>Dowling,</HI> the Attorney, who was now become a great Favourite with Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> and whom Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> at the Desire of his Nephew, had made his Steward, and had likewise recommended him to Mr. <HI>Western,</HI> from whom the Attorney received a Promise of being pro∣moted to the same Office upon the first Vacancy; and in the mean Time was employed in transacting some Affairs which the Squire then had in <HI>London,</HI> in Re∣lation to a Mortgage.</P>
<P>This was the principal Affair which then brought Mr. <HI>Dowling</HI> to Town, therefore he took the same
<PB N="265" REF="270"/>
Opportunity to charge himself with some Money for Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and to make a Report to him of some other Business; in all which as it was of much too dull a Nature to find any Place in this History, we will leave the Uncle, Nephew, and their Lawyer concerned, and resort to other Matters.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Containing various Matters.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we return to Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> we will take one more View of <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>Though that young Lady had brought her Aunt in∣to great good Humour by those soothing Methods, which we have before related, she had not brought her in the least to abate of her Zeal for the Match with Lord <HI>Fellamar;</HI> this Zeal was now inflamed by Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> who had told her the preceding Evening, that she was well satisfied from the Conduct of <HI>Sophia,</HI> and from her Carriage to his Lordship, that all Delays would be dangerous, and that the only Way to succeed, was to press the Match forward with such Rapidity, that the young Lady should have no Time to reflect, and be obliged to consent, while she searce knew what she did. In which Manner, she said, one half of the Marriages among People of Con∣dition were brought about. A Fact very probably true, and to which I suppose is owing the mutual Tenderness which afterwards exists among so many happy Couples.</P>
<P>A Hint of the same Kind was given by the same Lady to Lord <HI>Fellamar;</HI> and both these so readily embraced the Advice, that the very next Day was, at his Lordship's Request, appointed by Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> for a private Interview between the young Parties. This was communicated to <HI>Sophia</HI> by her Aunt, and asisted upon in such high Terms, that, after having ur∣ged every Thing she possibly could invent against it,
<PB N="266" REF="271"/>
without the least Effect, she at last agreed to give the highest Instance of Complaisance which any young Lady can give, and consented to see his Lordship.</P>
<P>As Conversations of this Kind afford no great En∣tertainment, we shall be excused from reeiting the whole that past at-this Interview; in which, after, his Lordship had made many Declarations of the most pure and ardent Passions, to the silent, blushing <HI>So∣phia;</HI> she at last collected all the Spirits she could raise, and with a trembling low Voice, said, <Q REND="inline">'My Lord, you must be yourself conscious whether your former Behaviour to me hath been consistent with the Professions you now make.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Is there, an∣swered he, no Way by which I can attone for Madness? What I did, I am afraid must have too plainly convinced you, that the Violence of Love had deprived me of my Senses.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">' 'Indeed my Lord, said she, it is in your Power to give me a Proof of an Affection which I much rather wish to encourage, and to which I should think myself more beholden.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Name it, Madam, said my Lord, very warmly.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'My Lord, says she, looking down upon her Fan, I know you must be sensible how uneasy this pretended Passion of yours hath made me.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Can you be so cruel to call it pretended? says he.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Yes, my Lord, answer∣ed <HI>Sophia,</HI> all Professions of Love to those whom we persecute, are most insulting Pretences. This Pursuit of yours is to me a most cruel Perse∣cution; nay, it is taking a most ungenerous Ad∣vantage of my unhappy Situation.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Most love∣ly, most adoreable Charmer, do not accuse me cries he, of taking an ungenerous Advantage, while I have no Thoughts but what are directed to your Honour and Interest, and while I have no View, no Hope, no Ambition but to throw myself, Ho∣nour,
<PB N="267" REF="272"/>
Fortune, every Thing at your Feet.</Q> <Q REND="inline">' My Lord, says she, it is that Fortune and those Ho∣nours which give you the Advantage of which I complain. These are the Charms which have se∣duced my Relations, but to me they are things in∣different. If your Lordship will merit my Gra∣titude, there is but one Way.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Pardon me, divine Creature, said he, there can be none. All I can do for you is so much your due, and will give me so much Pleasure, that there is no room for your Gratitude.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, my Lord, an∣swered she, you may obtain my Gratitude, my good Opinion, every kind Thought and Wish which it is in my Power to bestow, nay you may obtain them with Ease; for sure to a generous Mind it must be easy to grant my Request. Let me be∣seech you then to cease a Pursuit, in which you can never have any Success. For your own Sake as well as mine, I entreat this Favour; for sure you are too noble to have any Pleasure in torment∣ing an unhappy Creature. What can your Lord∣ship propose but Uneasiness to yourself, by a Per∣severance, which, upon my Honour, upon my Soul, cannot, shall not prevail with me, whatever Dis∣tresses you may drive me to.'</Q> Here my Lord fetched a deep Sigh, and then said,—<Q REND="inline">'Is it then, Madam, that I am so unhappy to be the Object of your Dislike and Scorn; or will you pardon me if I suspect there is some other?'</Q>—Here he hesitated, and <HI>Sophia</HI> answered with some Spirit, <Q REND="inline">'My Lord, I shall not be accountable to you for the Reasons of my Conduct. I am obliged to your Lordship for the generous Offer you have made; I own it is beyond either my Deserts or Expectations; yet I hope my Lord, you will not insist on my Reasons, when I declare I cannot accept it.'</Q> Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> returned much to this, which we do not perfectly un∣derstand,
<PB N="268" REF="273"/>
and perhaps it could not all be strictly reconcil∣ed either to Sense or Grammar; but he concluded his ranting Speech with saying, <Q REND="inline">'That if she has pre∣engaged herself to any Gentleman, however unhap∣py it would make him, he should think himself bound in Honour to desist.'</Q> Perhaps my Lord laid too much Emphasis on the Word Gentleman; for we cannot else well account for the Indignation with which he inspired <HI>Sophia,</HI> who, in her Answer, seemed greatly to resent some Affront he had given her.</P>
<P>While she was speaking, with her Voice more raised than usual, Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> came into the Room, the Fire glaring in her Cheeks, and the Flames burst∣ing from her Eyes. <Q REND="inline">'I am ashamed, says she, my Lord, of the Reception which you have met with. I assure your Lordship we are all sensible of the Honour done us; and I must tell you, Miss <HI>Western,</HI> the Family expect a different Behaviour from you.'</Q> Here my Lord interfered on Behalf of the young Lady, but to no Purpose; the Aunt proceeded till <HI>Sophia</HI> pulled out her Handkerchief, threw herself into a Chair, and burst into a violent Fit of Tears.</P>
<P>The Remainder of the Conversation between Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> and his Lordship, till the latter withdrew, consisted of bitter Lamentations on his Side, and on hers of the strongest Assurances that her Neice should and would consent to all he wished. <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, my Lord, says she, the Girl hath had a foolish Educa∣tion, neither adapted to her Fortune nor her Fami∣ly. Her Father, I am sorry to say it, is to blame for every Thing. The Girl hath silly Country Notions of Bashfulness. Nothing else, my Lord, upon my Honour; I am convinced she hath a good Understanding at the Bottom, and will be brought to Reason.'</Q></P>
<P>This last Speech was made in the Absence of <HI>Sophia,</HI> for she had sometime before left the Room with more
<PB N="269" REF="274"/>
Appearance of Passion than she had ever shewn on any Occasion; and now his Lordship, after many Expressions of Thanks to Mrs. <HI>Western,</HI> many ardent Professions of Passion which nothing could conquer, and many Assurances of Perseverance which Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> highly encouraged, took his Leave for this Time.</P>
<P>Before we relate what now passed between Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> and <HI>Sophia,</HI> it may be proper to mention an unfortunate Accident which had happened, and which had occasioned the Return of Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> with so much Fury as we have seen.</P>
<P>The Reader then must know, that the Maid who at present attended on <HI>Sophia,</HI> was recommended by Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> with whom she had lived for some Time in the Capacity of a Comb-brush; she was a very sensible Girl, and had received the strictest In∣structions to watch her young Lady very carefully. These Instructions, we are sorry to say, were com∣municated to her by Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> into whose Fa∣vour Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> had now so ingratiated herself, that the violent Affection which the good Waiting-Woman had formerly borne to <HI>Sophia,</HI> was entirely obliterated by that great Attachment which she had to her new Mistress.</P>
<P>Now when Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> was departed, <HI>Betty</HI> (for that was the Name of the Girl) returning to her young Lady, found her very attentively engaged in reading a long Letter, and the visible Emotions which she betrayed on that Occasion, might have well account∣ed for some Suspicions which the Girl entertained; but indeed they had yet a stronger Foundation, for she had overheard the whole Scene which passed between <HI>Sophia</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Miller.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> was acquainted with all this Matter by <HI>Betty,</HI> who, after receiving many Commendati∣ons, and some Rewards for her Fidelity, was order∣ed, that if the Woman who brought the Letter, came
<PB N="270" REF="275"/>
again, she should introduce her to Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> her∣self.</P>
<P>Unluckily Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> returned at the very time when <HI>Sophia</HI> was engaged with his Lordship. <HI>Betty,</HI> according to Order, sent her directly to the Aunt; who being Mistress of so many Circumstances relating to what had past the Day before, easily imposed up∣on the poor Woman to believe that <HI>Sophia</HI> had com∣municated the whole Affair; and so pumped every¦thing out of her which she knew, relating to the Let∣ter, and relating to <HI>Jones.</HI></P>
<P>This poor Creature might indeed be called Sim∣plicity itself. She was one of that Order of Mor∣tals, who are apt to believe every thing which is said to them; to whom Nature hath neither indulged the offensive nor defensive Weapons of Deceit, and who are consequently liable to be imposed upon by any one, who will only be at the Expence of a little Fal∣shood for that Purpose. Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> having drain∣ed Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> of all she knew, which indeed was but little, but which was sufficient to make the Aunt suspect a great deal, dismissed her, with Assurances that <HI>Sophia</HI> would not see her, that she would send no Answer to the Letter, nor ever receive another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nor did she suffer her to depart, without a handsome Lecture on the Merits of an Office, to which she could afford no better Name than that of Procu¦ress.—</P>
<P>This discovery had greatly discomposed her Tem¦per, when coming into the Apartment, next to tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in which the Lovers were, she overheard <HI>Sophia</HI> very warmly protesting against his Lordship's Addresses. At which the Rage already kindled, burst forth, and she rushed in upon her Niece in a furious Manner, as we have already described, together with what past a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that time till his Lordship's Departure.</P>
<P>No sooner was Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> gone, than Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> returned to <HI>Sophia,</HI> whom she upbraided i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="271" REF="276"/>
the most bitter Terms, for the ill Use she had made of the Confidence reposed in her; and for her Trea∣chery in Conversing with a Man, with whom she had offered but the Day before to bind herself in the most solemn Oath, never more to have any Conversation. <HI>Sophia</HI> protested she had maintained no such Conver∣sation. <Q REND="inline">'How! Miss <HI>Western,'</HI> said the Aunt, 'will you deny your receiving a Letter from him yester∣day?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'A Letter, Madam,'</Q> answered <HI>Sophia,</HI> some∣what surprized. <Q REND="inline">'It is not very well bred, Miss, replies the Aunt, to repeat my Words. I say a Letter, and I insist upon your shewing it me im∣mediately.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I scorn a Lie, Madam,' said <HI>Sophia,</HI> I did receive a Letter, but it was without my De∣sire, and indeed I may say against my Consent.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, indeed, Miss,' cries the Aunt, 'you ought to be ashamed of owning you had received it at all; but where is the Letter? for I will see it.'</Q></P>
<P>To this peremptory Demand <HI>Sophia</HI> paused some Time before she returned an Answer; and at last on∣ly excused herself by declaring she had not the Letter in her Pocket, which was indeed true; upon which her Aunt losing all manner of Patience, asked her Neice this short Question, whether she would resolve to marry Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> or no? to which she receiv∣ed the strongest Negative. Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> then replied with an Oath, or something very like one, that she would early the next Morning deliver her back into her Father's Hands.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> then began to reason with her Aunt in the following manner; <Q REND="inline">'Why, Madam, must I of Ne∣cessity be forced to marry at all? consider how cruel you would have thought it in your own Case, and how much kinder your Parents were in leaving you to your Liberty. What have I done to forfeit this Liberty? I will never marry contrary to my Father's Consent, nor without asking yours,—And when I ask the Consent of either improperly
<PB N="272" REF="277"/>
it will be then time enough to force some other marriage upon me.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Can I bear to hear this,' cries Mrs. <HI>Western,</HI> 'from a Girl, who hath now a Letter from a Murderer in her Pocket?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I have no such Letter, I promise you,' answered <HI>Sophia;</HI> 'and if he be a <HI>Murderer,</HI> he will soon be in no Con∣dition to give you any further Disturbance.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">' 'How Miss <HI>Western,'</HI> said the Aunt, 'have you the As∣surance to speak of him in this Manner, to own your Affection for such a Villain to my Face!'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Sure, Madam,' said <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'you put a very strange Construction on my Words.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Miss <HI>Western,'</HI> cries the Lady, 'I shall not bear this Usage; you have learnt of your Father this Manner of treating me; he hath taught you to give me the Lie. He hath totally ruined you by his false Sy∣stem of Education; and please Heaven he shall have the Comfort of its Fruits: For once more I declare to you, that to-morrow Morning I will car∣ry you back. I will withdraw all my Forces from the Field, and remain henceforth, like the wise King of <HI>Prussia,</HI> in a State of perfect Neutrality. You are both too wise to be regulated by my Measures; so prepare yourself, for to-morrow Morning you shall evacuate this House.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> remonstrated all she could; but her Aunt was deaf to all she said. In this Resolution there∣fore we must at present leave her, as there seems to be no Hopes of bringing her to change it.</P>

<P>He had heard upon Enquiry that the only Persons who had seen the Beginning of the unfortunate Ren∣counter, were a Crew belonging to a Man of War, which then lay at <HI>Deptford.</HI> To <HI>Deptford</HI> therefore he went, in search of this Crew, where he was inform∣ed that the Men he sought after were all gone ashore. He then traced them from Place to Place, till at last he found two of them drinking together, with a third Person, at a Hedge-Tavern, near <HI>Aldersgate.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nightingale</HI> desired to speak with <HI>Jones</HI> by himself (for <HI>Partridge</HI> was in the Room when he came in.) As soon as they were alone, <HI>Nightingale</HI> taking <HI>Jones</HI> by the Hand, cried, <Q REND="inline">'Come, my brave Friend, be not too much dejected at what I am going to tell you, I am sorry I am the Messenger of bad News.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I guess already what that News is,' cries <HI>Jones.</HI> 'The poor Gentleman then is dead.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'I hope not,' answered <HI>Nightingale.</HI> 'He was alive this Morning; though I will not flatter you; I fear from the Accounts I could get, that his Wound is mortal. But if the Affair be exactly as you told it, your own Remorse would be all you would have reason to apprehend, let what would hap∣pen; but forgive me, my dear <HI>Tom,</HI> if I entreat you to make the worst of your Story to your Friends. If you disguise any thing to us, you will only be an an Enemy to yourself.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'What Reason, my dear <HI>Jack,</HI> have I ever given you,' said <HI>Jones,</HI> 'to stab me with so cruel a Su∣spicion?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Have Patience,' cries <HI>Nightingale,</HI> and I will tell you all. After the most diligent En∣quiry, I could make, I at last met with two of the Fellows who were present at this unhappy Accident, and I am sorry to say, they do not relate the Story so much in your Favour, as you yourself have told it.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Why, what do they say?' cries <HI>Jones.</HI> 'In∣deed,

what I am sorry to repeat, as I am afraid o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Consequence of it to you. They say that they were at too great a Distance to overhear any Word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that passed between you; but they both agree tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the first Blow was given by you.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Then upon my Soul,' answered <HI>Jones,</HI> 'they injure me.

I repeated the Question to them several times, and so did another Gentleman who was present, who, I believe, is a sea-farin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man, and who really acted a very friendly part b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you; for he begged them often to consider, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there was the Life of a Man in the Case; and aske<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them over and over if they were certain; to which they both answered, that they were, and would abid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by their Evidence upon Oath. For Heaven's Sake my dear Friend, recollect yourself; for if this should appear to be the Fact, it will be your Business to think in time of making the best of your Interest. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would not shock you; but you know, I believe the Severity of the Law, whatever verbal Provocati¦ons may have been given you.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Alas! my Friend, cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'what Interest hath such a Wretch as I Besides, do you think I would even wish to liv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the Reputation of a Murderer?

<P>The Faith of <HI>Nightingale</HI> was now again staggered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd began to incline to credit his Friend, when Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> appeared, and made a sorrowful Report of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uccess of her Embassy; which when <HI>Jones</HI> had heard, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e cried out most heroically, 'Well, my Friend, I am now indifferent as to what shall happen, at least with Regard to my Life; and if it be the Will of Heaven that I shall make an Atonement with that for the Blood I have spilt, I hope the Divine Good∣ness will one Day suffer my Honour to be cleared, and that the Words of a dying Man, at least, will be believed, so far as to justify his Character.'</P>
<P>A very mournful Scene now past between the Pri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner and his Friends, at which, as few Readers would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave been pleased to be present, so few, I believe, will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esire to hear it particularly related. We will, there∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re, pass on to the Entrance of the Turnkey, who ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uainted <HI>Jones,</HI> that there was a Lady without who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esired to speak with him, when he was at Leisure.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> declared his Surprize at this Message. He said, he knew no Lady in the World whom he could possibly expect to see there. However, as he saw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Reason to decline seeing any Person, Mrs. <HI>Mil∣ler</HI> and Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> presently took their Leave, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd he gave Orders to have the Lady admitted.</P>
<P>If <HI>Jones</HI> was surprized at the News of a Visit from Lady, how greatly was he astonished when he dis∣covered this Lady to be no other than Mrs. <HI>Waters.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Astonishment then we shall leave him awhile, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> order to cure the Surprize of the Reader, who will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kewise, probably, not a little wonder at the Arrival <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f this Lady.</P>
<P>Who this Mr. <HI>Waters</HI> was, the Reader pretty well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ows; what she was he must be perfectly satisfied.
<PB N="276" REF="281"/>
He will therefore be pleased to remember, that thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lady departed from <HI>Upton</HI> in the same Coach with Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> and the other <HI>Irish</HI> Gentleman, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in their Company travelled to the <HI>Bath.</HI></P>
<P>Now there was a certain Office in the Gift of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> at that Time vacant, namely, that of Wife; for the Lady who had lately filled that Offic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had resigned, or at least deserted her Duty. Mr. <HI>Fitz¦patrick</HI> therefore having thoroughly examined Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> on the Road, found her extremely fit for thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Place, which, on their Arrival at <HI>Bath,</HI> he presentl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conferred upon her, and she, without any Scruple accepted. As Husband and Wife this Gentleman and Lady continued together all the Time they stayed a <HI>Bath,</HI> and as Husband and Wife they arrived together in Town.</P>
<P>Whether Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> was so wise a Man a not to part with one good Thing till he had secure another, which he had at present only a Prospect of re¦gaining; or whether Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> had so well dis¦charged her Office, that he intended still to retain he as Principal, and to make his Wife (as is often the Case) only her Deputy, I will not say; but certain is he never mentioned his Wife to her, never commu¦nicated to her the Letter given him by Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> nor ever once hinted his Purpose of re-possessing h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Wife; much less did he ever mention the Name o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Jones.</HI> For though he intended to fight with him wherever he met him, he did not imitate those pru¦dent Persons who think a Wife, a Mother, a Siste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or sometimes a whole Family, the safest Seconds o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these Occasions. The first Account therefore which she had of all this, was delivered to her from his Lip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after he was brought hime from the Tavern where h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wound had been drest.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> however had not the cleare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Way of telling a Story at any Time, and was now
<PB N="277" REF="282"/>
perhaps a little more confused than usual, it was some Time before she discovered, that the Gentleman who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad given him this Wound was the very same Person from whom her Heart had received a Wound, which, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hough not of a mortal Kind, was yet so deep that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad left a considerable Scar behind it. But no sooner was she acquainted that Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> himself was the Man who had been committed to the Gatehouse for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his supposed Murder, than she took the first Oppor∣tunity of committing Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> to the Care of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Nurse, and hastened away to visit the Conqueror.</P>
<P>She now entered the Room with an Air of Gayety, which received an immediate Check from the melan∣choly Aspect of poor <HI>Jones,</HI> who started and blessed himself when he saw her. Upon which she said, <Q REND="inline">'Nay, I do not wonder at your Surprize; I believe you did not expect to see me; for few Gentlemen are troubled here with Visits from any Lady, unless a Wife. You see the Power you have over me, Mr. <HI>Jones.</HI> Indeed I little thought when we part∣ed at <HI>Upton,</HI> that our next Meeting would have been in such a Place.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Madam,' says <HI>Jones,</HI> 'I must look upon this Visit as kind; few will fol∣low the Miserable, especially to such dismal Habi∣tations.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I protest Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> 'says she, I can hardly persuade myself you are the same agree∣able Fellow I saw at <HI>Upton.</HI> Why, your Face is more miserable than any Dungeon in the Universe. What can be the Matter with you?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I thought, Madam,' said <HI>Jones,</HI> as you knew of my being here, you knew the unhappy Reason.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Pugh,' says she, you have pinked a Man in a Duel, that's all.'</Q> <HI>Jones</HI> exprest some Indignation at this Levity, and spoke with the utmost Contrition for what had happened. To which she answered, <Q REND="inline">'Well then, Sir, if you take it so much to Heart, I will relieve you; the Gentleman is not dead: and, I am pretty confident, is in no Danger of dying. The Surgeon indeed who
<PB N="277" REF="283"/>
first dressed him was a young Fellow, and seeme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> desirous of representing his Case to be as bad as pos¦sible, that he might have the more Honour from curing him; but the King's Surgeon hath seen him since, and says, unless from a Fever, of which ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are at present no Symptoms, he apprehends not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> least Danger of Life.'</Q> <HI>Jones</HI> shewed great Satisfac¦tion in his Countenance at this Report; upon which she affirmed the Truth of it, adding, <Q REND="inline">'By the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> extraordinary Accident in the World I lodge at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same House, and have seen the Gentleman; and promise you he doth you Justice, and says, What ever be the Consequence, that he was entirely th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Aggressor, and that you was not in the least t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> blame.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> expressed the utmost Satisfaction at the Ac¦count which Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> brought him. He the informed her of many Things which she well knew before, as who Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> was, the Occasion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Resentment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He likewise told her sever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Facts of which she was ignorant, as the Adventure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Muff, and other Particulars, concealing only th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Name of <HI>Sophia.</HI> He then lamented the Follies an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Vices of which he had been guilty; every one of which he said, had been attended with such ill Consequence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that he should be unpardonoble if he did not take Wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ing, and quit those vicious Courses for the future. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lastly concluded with assuring her of his Resolution <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sin no more, lest a worse Thing should happen to him.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> with great Pleasantry ridiculed all thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as the Effects of low Spirits and confinement. Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> repeated some Witticisms about <HI>the Devil when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was sick,</HI> and told him, <Q REND="inline">'She doubted not but shortl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to see him at Liberty, and as lively a Fellow as eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and then,' says she, 'I don't question but your Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦science will be safely delivered of all these Qual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that it is now so sick in breeding.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="284"/>
Many more Things of this Kind she uttered, some of which it would do her no great Honour, in the Opinion of some Readers, to remember; nor are we quite certain but that the Answers made by <HI>Jones</HI> would be treated with Ridicule by others. We shall there∣fore suppress the rest of this Conversation, and only observe, that it ended at last with perfect Inno∣cence, and much more to the Satisfaction of <HI>Jones</HI> than of the Lady: For the former was greatly tran∣sported with the News she had brought him; but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atter was not altogether so pleased with the penitential Behaviour of a Man whom she had at first Interview conceived a very different Opinion of from what she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow entertained of him.</P>
<P>Thus the Melancholy occasioned by the Report of Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> was pretty well effaced; but the De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection into which Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> had thrown him still continued. The Account she gave, so well tallied with the Words of <HI>Sophia</HI> herself in her Letter, that he made not the least Doubt but that she had disclosed his Letter to her Aunt, and had taken a fixed Resolution to abandon him. The Torments this Thought gave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im were to be equalled only by a Piece of News which Fortune yet had in Store for him, and which we shall communicate in the second Chapter of the ensuing Book.</P>

<P>WE are now, Reader, arrived at the last Stage of our long Journey. As we have there∣fore travelled together through so many Pages let us behave to one another like Fellow Traveller in a Stage-Coach, who have passed several Day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Company of each other; and who, not∣withstanding any Bickerings or litttle Animositie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which may have occurred on the Road, generally make all up at last, and mount, for the last Time, in to their Vehicle with Chearfulness and Good-Humour
<PB N="281" REF="286"/>
since, after this one Stage, it may possibly happen to us, as it commonly happens to them, never to meet more.</P>
<P>As I have here taken up this Simile, give me Leave to carry it a little farther. I intend then in this last Book to imitate the good Company I have mentioned in their last Journey. Now it is well known, that all Jokes and Raillery are at this Time laid aside; what∣ever Characters any of the Passengers have for the lest sake personated on the Road, are now thrown off, and the Conversation is usually plain and serious.</P>
<P>In the same Manner, if I have now and then, in the Course of this Work, indulged any Pleasantry for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y entertainment, I shall here lay it down. The Va∣riety of Matter, indeed, which I shall be obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>am into this Book, will afford no room for any of those ludicrous Observations which I have elsewhere made, and which may sometimes, perhaps, have pre∣vented thee from taking a Nap when it was beginning to steal upon thee. In this last Book thou wilt find <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>thing (or at most very little) of that Nature. All will be plain Narrative only; and, indeed, when thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st perused the many great Events which this Book will produce, thou wilt think the Number of Pages contained in it scarce sufficient to tell the Story.</P>
<P>And now, my Friend, I take this Opportunity (as I shall have no other) of heartily wishing thee well. If I have been an entertaining Companion to thee, I promise thee it is what I have desired. If in any Thing I have offended, it was really without any In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ention. Some Things perhaps here said, may have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t thee or thy Friends; but I do most solemnly de∣clare they were not pointed at them. I question not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut thou hast been told, among other Stories of me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat thou wast to travel with a very scurrilous Fellow: But whoever told thee so, did me an Injury. No Plan detests and despises Scurrility more than myself; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or hath any Man more Reason; for none has ever

been treated with more: And what is a very seven Fate, I have had some of the abusive Writings of those very Men fathered upon me, who in other of their Works have abused me themselves with the utmost Virulence.</P>
<P>All these Works, however, I am well convinced will be dead long before this Page shall offer itself to thy Perusal: For however short the Period may be o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my own Performances, they will most probably out live their own infirm Author, and the weakly Pro¦ductions of his abusive Cotemporaries.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Containing a very tragical Incident.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHILE <HI>Jones</HI> was employed in these unplea¦sant Meditations, with which we left him tor¦menting himself, <HI>Partridge</HI> came stumbling into th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Room with his Face paler than Ashes, his Eyes fixe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in his Head, his Hair standing an End, and ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Limb trembling. In short, he looked as he would have done had he seen a Spectre, or had he indeed been a Spectre himself.</P>
<P><HI>Jones,</HI> who was little subject to Fear, could not a¦void being somewhat shocked at this sudden Appear¦ance. He did indeed himself change Colour, and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Voice a little faultered, while he asked him what w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Matter.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I hope, Sir,' said <HI>Partridge,</HI> 'you will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> angry with me. Indeed I did not listen, but I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> obliged to stay in the outward Room. I am sure wish I had been a hundred Miles off, rather tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have heard what I have heard.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Why what is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Matter?'</Q> said <HI>Jones.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'The Matter, Sir? O god Heaven!' answered <HI>Partridge,</HI> 'was that Wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> who is just gone out, the Woman who was wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> you at <HI>Upton?'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'She was, <HI>Partridge,'</HI></Q> cries <HI>Jones</HI> <Q REND="inline">'And did you really, Sir, go to bed with that W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>Upon these Words, <HI>Jones</HI> became in a Moment a greater Picture of Horror than <HI>Partridge</HI> himself. He was indeed, for some Time, struck dumb with Amaze∣ment, and both stood staring wildly at each other. At last his Words found Way, and in an interrupted Voice he said—<Q REND="inline">'How! how! What's this you tell me?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Nay, Sir,' cries <HI>Partridge,</HI> 'I have not Breath enough left to tell you now—but what I have said is most certainly true—That Woman who now went out is your own Mother. How un∣lucky was it for you, Sir, that I did not happen to see her at that Time, to have prevented it? Sure the Devil himself must have contrived to bring a∣bout this Wickedness.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Sure,' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'Fortune will never have done with me, 'till she hath driven me to Distraction. But why do I blame Fortune? I am myself the Cause of all my Misery. All the dreadful Mischiefs which have befallen me, are the Consequences only of my own Folly and Vice. What thou hast told me, <HI>Partridge,</HI> hath almost deprived me of my Sen∣ses. And was Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> then—But why do I ask? for thou must certainly know her.—If thou hast any Affection for me; nay, if thou hast any Pity, let me beseech thee to fetch this miserable Wo∣man back again to me. O good Heavens! Incest—with a Mother! To what am I reserved?'</Q> He then sell into the most violent and frantic Agonies of Grief and Despair, in which <HI>Partridge</HI> declared he would
<PB N="284" REF="289"/>
not leave him: But at last having vented the first Tor∣rent of Passion, he came a little to himself; and then having acquainted <HI>Partridge</HI> that he would find this wretched Woman in the same House where the wound¦ed Gentleman was lodged, he dispatched him in ques<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of her.</P>
<P>If the Reader will please to refresh his Memory by turning to the Scene at <HI>Upton</HI> in the ninth Book, he will be apt to admire the many strange Accident which unfortunately prevented any Interview between <HI>Partridge</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> when she spent a whol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Day there with Mr. <HI>Jones.</HI> Instances of this Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we may frequently observe in Life, where the great¦est Events are produced by a nice Train of little Cir¦cumstances; and more than one Example of this may be discovered by the accurate Eye, in this our His¦tory.</P>

<P><HI>P. S.</HI> I would have you comfort yourself as much as possible, for Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> is in no man∣ner of Danger; so that whatever other grievous Crimes you may have to repent of, the Guilt of Blood is not among the Number.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> having received the Letter, let it drop (for he was unable to hold it, and indeed had scarce the Use of any one of his Faculties) <HI>Partridge</HI> took it up, and having received Consent by Silence, read it likewise; nor had it upon him a less sensible Effect. The Pencil, and not the Pen, should describe the Hor∣rors which appeared in both their Countenances. While they both remained speechless, the Turnkey entered the Room, and without taking any Notice of what sufficiently discovered itself in the Faces of them both, acquainted <HI>Jones</HI> that a Man without desired to speak with him. This Person was presently introdu∣ced, and was no other than Black <HI>George.</HI></P>
<P>As Sights of Horror were not so usual to <HI>George</HI> as they were to the Turnkey, he instantly saw the great Disorder which appeared in the Face of <HI>Jones.</HI> This he imputed to the Accident that happened, which was reported in the very worst Light in Mr. <HI>Western'</HI>s Family; he concluded therefore that the Gentleman was dead, and that Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was in a fair Way of coming to a shameful End. A Thought which gave him much Uneasiness; for <HI>George</HI> was of a compas∣sionate Disposition, and notwithstanding a small Breach of Friendship which he had been over-tempted to commit, was, in the main, not insensible of the Obligations he had formerly received from Mr. <HI>Jones.</HI></P>
<P>The poor Fellow therefore scarce refrained from a Tear at the present Sight. He told <HI>Jones</HI> he was heartily sorry for his Misfortunes, and begged him to
<PB N="286" REF="291"/>
consider if he could be of any manner of Service <Q REND="inline">'Perhaps, Sir, said he, you may want a little Matter of Money upon this Occasion; if you do, Sir what little I have is heartily at your Service.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> shook him very heartily by the Hand, and gave him many Thanks for the Kind Offer he had made; but answered, <Q REND="inline">'He had not the least Wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of that Kind.'</Q> Upon which <HI>George</HI> began to press his Services more eagerly than before. <HI>Jones</HI> again thanked him, with Assurances that he wanted no∣thing which was in the Power of any Man living to give. <Q REND="inline">'Come, come, my good Master, answered <HI>George,</HI> do not take the Matter so much to Heart Things may end better than you imagine; to be sure you ant the first Gentleman who hath killed a Man, and yet come off.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'You are wide of the Matter, <HI>George,</HI> said <HI>Partridge,</HI> the Gentleman is not dead, nor like to die. Don't disturb my Mas∣ter at present, for he is troubled about a Matter in which it is not in your Power to do him any good.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'You don't know what I may be able to do, Mr. <HI>Partridge,</HI> answered <HI>George;</HI> if his Concern is about my young Lady, I have some News to tell my Mas∣ter.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'What do you say, Mr. <HI>George?'</HI> cry'd <HI>Jones,</HI> hath any thing lately happened in which my <HI>Sophia</HI> is concerned? My <HI>Sophia!</HI> How dares such a Wretch as I mention her so prophanely.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'I hope she will be yours yet, 'answered <HI>George.—</HI>'Why, yes, Sir, I have something to tell you about her. Madam <HI>Western</HI> hath just brought Madam <HI>Sophia</HI> home, and there hath been a terrible to do. I could not possibly learn the very Right of it; but my Master he hath been in a vast big Passion, and so was Madam <HI>Western,</HI> and I heard her say as she went out of Doors into her Chair, that she would never set her Foot in Master's House again. I don't know what's the Matter, not I, but every thing was very quiet when I came out; but <HI>Robin,</HI> who waited at
<PB N="287" REF="292"/>
Supper, said he had never seen the Squire for a long while in such good Humour with young Ma∣dam; that he kissed her several Times, and swore she should be her own Mistress, and he never would think of confining her any more. I thought this News would please you, and so I slipp'd out, though it was so late, to inform you of it.'</Q> Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> assured <HI>George</HI> that it did greatly please him; for though he should never more presume to lift his Eyes towards that incomparable Creature, nothing could so much relieve his Misery as the Satisfaction he should always have in hearing of her Welfare.</P>
<P>The rest of the Conversation which passed at the Visit is not important enough to be here related. The Reader will therefore forgive us this abrupt breaking off, and be pleased to hear how this great good Will of the Squire towards his Daughter was brought about.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Western,</HI> on her first Arrival at her Brother's Lodging, began to set forth the great Honours and Advantages which would accrue to the Family by the Match with Lord <HI>Fellamar,</HI> which her Neice had ab∣solutely refused; in which Refusal, when the Squire took the Part of his Daughter, she fell immediately into the most violent Passion, and so irritated and pro∣voked the Squire, that neither his Patience nor his Prudence could bear any longer; upon which there ensued between them both so warm a Bout at Alter∣cation, that perhaps the Regions of <HI>Billingsgate</HI> ne∣ver equalled it. In the Heat of this Scolding Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> departed, and had consequently no Leisure to acquaint the Brother with the Letter which <HI>Sophia</HI> re∣ceived, which might have possibly produced ill Ef∣fects; but to say the Truth I believe it never once occurred to her Memory at this Time.</P>
<P>When Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> was gone, <HI>Sophia,</HI> who had been hitherto silent, as well indeed from Necessity as Inclination, began to return the Compliment which
<PB N="288" REF="293"/>
her Father had made her, in taking her part against her Aunt, by taking his likewise against the Lady. This was the first Time of her so doing, and it was in the highest Degree acceptable to the Squire. Again he remembered that Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had insisted on an en∣tire Relinquishment of all violent Means; and indeed as he made no doubt but that <HI>Jones</HI> would be hanged he did not in the least question succeeding with his Daughter by fair Means; he now therefore once more gave a Loose to his natural Fondness for her, which had such an Effect on the Dutiful, grateful, tender and Affectionate Heart of <HI>Sophia,</HI> that had her Honour given to <HI>Jones,</HI> and something else perhaps in which he was concerned, been removed, I much doubt whether she would not have sacrificed herself to a Man she did not like, to have obliged her Father. She promised him she would make it the whole Bu∣siness of her Life to oblige him, and would never marry any Man against his Consent; which brought the old Man so near to his highest Happiness, that he was resolved to take the other Step, and went to Bed completely drunk.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Allworthy <HI>visits old</HI> Nightingale; <HI>with a strange Dis∣covery that he made on that Occasion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Morning after these Things had happened, Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> went according to his Promise to visit old <HI>Nightingale,</HI> with whom his Authority was so great, that after having sat with him three Hours, he at last prevailed with him to consent to see his Son.</P>
<P>Here an Accident happened of a very extraordina∣ry Kind; one indeed of those strange Chances, whence very good and grave Men have concluded that Providence often interposes in the Discovery of
<PB N="289" REF="294"/>
the most secret Villainy, in order to caution Men from quitting the Paths of Honesty, however warily they tread in those of Vice.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> at his Entrance into Mr. <HI>Night∣ingale'</HI>s, saw black <HI>George;</HI> he took no Notice of him, nor did Black <HI>George</HI> imagine he had perceived him. However, when their Conversation on the principal Point was over, <HI>Allworthy</HI> asked <HI>Nightingale</HI> whether he knew one <HI>George Seagrim,</HI> and upon what Business he came to his House. <Q REND="inline">'Yes, answer∣ed <HI>Nightingale,</HI> I know him very well, and a most extraordinary Fellow he is, who in these Days, hath been able to hoard up <HI>500l.</HI> from renting a very small Estate of <HI>30l.</HI> a Year.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'And is this the Story he hath told you? cries <HI>Allworthy.'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'Nay, it is true, I promise you,' said <HI>Nightingale,</HI> 'for I have the Money now in my Hands, in five Bank Bills, which I am to lay out either in a Mortgage, or in some Purchase in the North of <HI>England.</HI>'</Q> The Bank Bills were no sooner produced at <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Desire, than he blessed himself at the Strangeness of the Discovery. He presently told <HI>Nightingale</HI> that these Bank Bills were formerly his, and then acquaint∣ed him with the whole Affair. As there are no Men who complain more of the Frauds of Business than Highwaymen, Gamesters, and other Thieves of that Kind; so there are none who so bitterly exclaim a∣gainst the Frauds of Gamesters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as Usurers, Bro∣kers, and other Thieves of this Kind; whether it be that the one Way of cheating is a Discountenance or Reflection upon the other, or that Money, which is the common Mistress of all Cheats, makes them re∣gard each other in the Light of Rivals; but <HI>Nightin∣gale</HI> no sooner heard the Story, than he exclaimed against the Fellow in Terms much severer than the Justice and Honesty of <HI>Allworthy</HI> had bestowed on him.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="295"/>
<HI>Allworthy</HI> desired <HI>Nightingale</HI> to retain both the Money and the Secret till he should hear farther from him; and if he should in the mean Time see the Fel∣low, that he would not take the least Notice to him of the Discovery which he had made. He then re∣turned to his Lodgings, where he found Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> in a very dejected Condition, on Account of the In∣formation she had received from her Son-in-law. Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> with great Chearfulness, told her that he had much good News to communicate; and with little further Preface, acquainted her, that he had brought Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> to consent to see his Son, and did not in the least doubt to effect a perfect Re∣conciliation between them; though he found the Fa∣ther more sowered by another Accident of the same Kind, which had happened in his Family. He then mentioned the running away of the Uncle's Daugh∣ter, which he had been told by the old Gentleman, and which Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> and her Son-in-law, did not yet know.</P>
<P>The Reader may suppose Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> received this Account with great Thankfulness and no less Plea∣sure; but so uncommon was her Friendship to <HI>Jones,</HI> that I am not certain whether the Uneasiness she suf∣fered for his Sake, did not over-ballance her Satis∣faction at hearing a Piece of News tending so much to the Happiness of her own Family; nor whether even this very News, as it reminded her of the Ob∣ligations she had to <HI>Jones,</HI> did not hurt as well as please her; when her grateful Heart said to her, <Q REND="inline">'While my own Family is happy, how miserable is the poor Creature, to whose Generosity we owe the Beginning of all this Happiness.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> having left her a little while to chew the Cud (if I may use that Expression) on these first Tid∣ings, told her, he had still something more to impart, which he believed would give her Pleasure. <Q REND="inline">'I think said he, I have discovered a pretty considerable Trea∣sure
<PB N="291" REF="296"/>
belonging to the young Gentleman, your Friend; but perhaps indeed, his present Situation may be such, that it will be of no Service to him.'</Q> The latter Part of the Speech gave Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> to understand who was meant, and she answered with a Sigh, <Q REND="inline">'I hope not, Sir.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I hope so too' cries <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'with all my Heart, but my Nephew told me this Morning, he had heard a very bad Ac∣count of the Affair.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Good Heaven! Sir,' said she—Well, I must not speak, and yet it is certainly very hard to be obliged to hold one's Tongue when one hears'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Madam, said <HI>Allworthy,</HI> you may say whatever you please, you know me too well to think I have a Prejudice against any one; and as for that young Man, I assure you I should be hear∣tily pleased to find he could acquit himself of every thing, and particularly of this sad Affair. You can testify the Affection I have formerly borne him. The World, I know, censured me for loving him so much. I did not withdraw that Affection from him without thinking I had the justest Cause. Be∣lieve me, Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> I should be glad to find I have been mistaken.'</Q> Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> was going ea∣gerly to reply, when a Servant acquainted her, that a Gentleman without desired to speak with her imme∣diately. <HI>Allworthy</HI> then enquired for his Nephew, and was told, that he had been for some Time in his Room with the Gentleman who used to come to him, and whom Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> guessing rightly to be Mr. <HI>Dowling,</HI> he desired presently to speak with him.</P>
<P>When <HI>Dowling</HI> attended, <HI>Allworthy</HI> put the Case of the Bank-Notes to him, without mentioning any Name, and asked in what manner such a Person might be pu∣nished. To which <HI>Dowling</HI> answered, he thought he might be indicted on the Black Act; but said, as it was a Matter of some Nicety, it would be proper to go to Council. He said he was to attend Council presently upon an Affair of Mr. <HI>Western'</HI>s, and if
<PB N="292" REF="297"/>
Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> pleased he would lay the Case before them. This was agreed to; and then Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> opening the Door, cry'd, <Q REND="inline">'I ask pardon, I did not know you had Company;'</Q> but <HI>Allworthy</HI> desired her to come in, saying, he had finished his Business. Upon which Mr. <HI>Dowling</HI> withdrew, and Mrs. <HI>Mil∣ler</HI> introduced Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> the younger, to re∣turn thanks for the great Kindness done him by <HI>All∣worthy;</HI> but she had scarce Patience to let the young Gentleman finish his Speech before she interrupted him, saying, <Q REND="inline">'O Sir, Mr. <HI>Nightingale,</HI> brings great News about poor Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> he hath been to see the wounded Gentleman, who is out of all Danger of Death, and what is more, declares he fell upon poor Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> himself, and beat him. I am sure, Sir, you would not have Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> be a Coward. If I was a Man myself, I am sure if any Man was to strike me, I should draw my Sword. Do pray, my Dear, tell Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> tell him all yourself.'</Q> <HI>Nightingale</HI> then confirmed what Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> had said; and concluded with many handsome Things of <HI>Jones,</HI> who was, he said, one of the best-natured Fellows in the World, and not in the least inclined to be quarrelsome. Here <HI>Nightingale</HI> was going to cease, when Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> again begged him to related all the many dutiful Expressions he had heard him make use of towards Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'To say the utmost Good of Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> cries <HI>Nightingale,</HI> is doing no more than strict Justice, and can have no Merits in it; but indeed I must say, no Man can be more sensible of the Obligations he hath to so good a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man, than is poor <HI>Jones.</HI> Indeed, Sir, I am con∣vinced the Weight of your Displeasure is the hea∣viest Burthen he lies under. He hath often lament∣ed it to me, and hath as often protested in the most solemn Manner he had never been intentionally guil∣ty of any Offence towards you; nay, he hath sworn he would rather die a Thousand Deaths than
<PB N="293" REF="298"/>
he would have his Conscience upbraid him with one disrespectful, ungrateful, or undutiful Thought to∣wards you. But I ask pardon, Sir, I am afraid I presume to intermeddle too far in so tender a Point.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'You have spoke no more than what a Christian ought, cries Mrs. <HI>Miller.'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Mr. <HI>Nightingale,</HI> answered <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'I applaud your generous Friend∣ship, and I wish he may merit it of you. I con∣fess I am glad to hear the Report you bring from this unfortunate Gentleman; and if that Matter should turn out to be as you represent it (and indeed I doubt nothing of what you say) I may perhaps, in Time, be brought to think better than lately I have of this young Man: For this good Gentle wo∣man here, nay all who know me, can witness that I loved him as dearly as if he had been my own Son. Indeed I have considered him as a Child sent by Fortune to my Care. I still remember the in∣nocent, the helpless Situation in which I found him. I feel the tender Pressure of his little Hands at this Moment.—He was my Darling, indeed he was.'</Q> At which Words he ceased, and the Tears stood in his Eyes.</P>
<P>As the Answer which Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> made may lead us into fresh Matters, we will here stop to account for the visible Alteration in Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Mind, and the Abatement of his Anger to <HI>Jones.</HI> Revolu∣tions of this Kind, it is true, do frequently occur in Histories and dramatic Writers, for no other Reason than because the History or Play draws to a Conclu∣sion, and are justified by Authority of Authors; yet though we insist upon as much Authority as any Au∣thor whatever, we shall use this Power very sparing∣ly, and never but when we are driven to it by Neces∣sity, which we do not at present foresee will happen in this Work.</P>
<P>This Alteration then in the Mind of Mr. <HI>All∣worthy,</HI> was occasioned by a Letter he had just re∣ceived
<PB N="294" REF="299"/>
from Mr. <HI>Square,</HI> and which we shall give the Reader in the Beginning of the next Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Containing two Letters in very different Stiles.</HI></HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My worthy Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I informed you in my last, that I was forbidden the Use of the Waters, as they were found by Experience rather to encrease than lessen the Symp∣toms of my Distemper. I must now acquaint you with a Piece of News, which, I believe, will afflict my Friends more than it hath afflicted me. Dr. <HI>Harrington</HI> and Dr. <HI>Brewster,</HI> have informed me, that there is no Hopes of my Recovery.</P>
<P>I have somewhere read, that the great Use of Philosophy is to learn to die. I will not therefore so far disgrace mine, as to shew any Surprize at receiving a Lesson which I must be thought to have so long studied. Yet, to say the Truth, one Page of the Gospel teaches this Lesson better than all the Volumes of antient or modern Philosophers. The Assurance it gives us of another Life is a much stronger support to a good Mind, than all the Consolations that are drawn from the Necessity of Nature, the Emptiness or Satiety of our Enjoy∣ments here, or any other Topic of those Decla∣mations which are sometimes capable of arming our Minds with a stubborn Patience in bearing the Thoughts of Death; but never of raising them to a real Contempt of it, and much less of making us think it a real Good. I would not here be understood to throw the horrid Censure of Atheism, or even the absolute Denial of Immortality, on all who are called Philosophers. Many of that Sect, as∣well antient as modern, have, from the Light of Reason, discovered some Hopes of a future State; but, in Reality, that Light was so faint and glim∣mering,
<PB N="295" REF="300"/>
and the Hopes were so incertain and pre∣carious, that it may be justly doubted on which Side their Belief turned. <HI>Plato</HI> himself conludes his <HI>Phaedon,</HI> with declaring that his best Argu∣ments amount only to raise a Probability, and <HI>Ci∣cero</HI> himself seems rather to profess an Inclination to believe, than any actual Belief in the Doctrines of Immortality. As to myself to be very sincere with you, I never was much in earnest in this Faith, till I was in earnest a Christian.</P>
<P>You will perhaps wonder at the latter Expressi∣on; but I assure you it hath not been till very lately, that I could, with Truth, call myself so. The Pride of Philosophy had intoxicated my Reason, and the sublimest of all Wisdom appeared to me, as it did to the <HI>Greeks</HI> of old, to be Foolishness. God hath however been so gracious to shew me my Error in Time, and to bring me into the Way of Truth, before I sunk into utter Darkness for ever.</P>
<P>I find myself beginning to grow very weak, I shall therefore hasten to the main Purpose of this Letter.</P>
<P>When I reflect on the Actions of my past Life, I know of nothing which sits heavier upon my Conscience, than the Injustice I have been guilty of to that poor Wretch, your adopted Son. I have not indeed only connived at the Villany of others, but been myself active in Injustice towards him. Believe me, my dear Friend, when I tell you on the Word of a dying Man, he has been basely injured. As to the principal Fact, upon the Misrepresentation of which you discarded him, I solemnly assure you he is innocent. When you lay upon your supposed Death-bed, he was the only Person in the House who testified any real Concern; and what happened afterwards arose from the Wildness of his Joy on your Recovery;
<PB N="296" REF="301"/>
and, I am sorry to say it, from the Baseness of another Person (but it is my Desire to justify the Innocent, and to accuse none). Believe me, my Friend, this young Man hath the noblest Genero∣sity of Heart, the most perfect Capacity for Friend∣ship, the highest Integrity, and indeed every Vir∣tue which can ennoble a Man. He hath some Faults, but among them is not to be numbred the least want of Duty or Gratitude towards you. On the contrary I am satisfied when you dismissed him from your House, his Heart bled for you more than for himself.</P>
<P>Worldly Motives were the wicked and base Rea∣sons of my concealing this from you so long; to reveal it now I can have no Inducement but the Desire of serving the Cause of Truth, of doing Right to the Innocent, and of making all the A∣mends in my Power for a past Offence. I hope this Declaration therefore will have the Effect de∣sired, and will restore this deserving young Man to your Favour; the hearing of which while I am yet alive will afford the utmost Consolation to,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The Reader will, after this, scarce wonder at the Revolution so visibly appearing in Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> not∣withstanding he received from <HI>Thwackum,</HI> by the same Post, another Letter of a very different Kind, which we shall here add, as it may possibly be the last Time we shall have occasion to mention the Name of that Gentleman.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am not at all surprized at hearing from your worthy Nephew a fresh Instance of the Villany of
<PB N="297" REF="302"/>
Mr. <HI>Square</HI> the Atheist's young Pupil. I shall not wonder at any Murders he may commit; and I heartily pray that your own Blood may not seal up his final Commitment to the Place of Wailing and gnashing of Teeth.</P>
<P>Though you cannot want sufficient Calls to Re∣pentance for the many unwarrantable Weaknesses exemplified in your Behaviour to this Wretch, so much to the Prejudice of your own lawful Family, and of your Character. I say, tho' these may suf∣ficiently be supposed to prick and goad your Con∣science at this Season; I should yet be wanting to my Duty, if I spared to give you some Admoni∣tion in order to bring you to a due Sense of your Errors. I therefore pray you seriously to consider the Judgment which is likely to overtake this wick∣ed Villain; and let it serve at least as a Warning to you, that you may not for the future despise the Advice of one who is indefatigable in his Prayers for your Welfare.</P>
<P>Had not my Hand been withheld from due Cor∣rection, I had scourged much of this diabolical Spirit out of a Boy, of whom from his Infancy I discovered the Devil had taken such entire Posses∣sion; but Reflections of this Kind now come too late.</P>
<P>I am sorry you have given away the Living of <HI>Westerton</HI> so hastily. I should have applied on that Occasion earlier, had I thought you would not have acquainted me previous to the Disposition.—Your Objection to Pluralities is being righteous over-much. If there were any Crime in the Prac∣tice, so many godly Men would not agree to it. If the Vicar of <HI>Aldergrove</HI> should die (as we hear he is in a declining Way) I hope you will think of me, since I am certain you must be convinced of my most sincere Attachment to your highest Welfare. A Welfare to which all worldly Considerations are

<P>This was the first Time that <HI>Thwackum</HI> eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wrote in this authoritative Stile to <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and of this he had afterwards sufficient Reason to re¦pent, as in the Case of those who mistake the high¦est Degree of Goodness for the lowest Degree o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Weakness. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had indeed never liked thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man. He knew him to be proud and ill-natured he also knew that his Divinity itself was tincture with his Temper, and such as in many Respects h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> himself did by no means approve: But he was at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same Time an excellent Scholar, and most indefati¦gable in teaching the two Lads. Add to this th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> strict Severity of his Life and Manners, an unim¦peached Honesty, and a most devout Attachment to Religion. So that upon the whole, though <HI>Allworthy</HI> did not esteem nor love the Man, yet he could never bring himself to part with a Tutor to the Boys, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was both by Learning and Industry, extremely we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> qualified for his Office; and he hoped, that as they were bred up in his own House, and under his own Eye, he should be able to correct whatever was wrong in <HI>Thwackum'</HI>s Instructions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>In which the History is continued.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> in his last Speech, had recollecte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some tender Ideas concerning <HI>Jones,</HI> which had brought Tears into the good Man's Eyes. Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> observing, said, <Q REND="inline">'Yes, yes, Sir, your Goodness to this poor young Man is known not¦withstanding all your Care to conceal it; but there

is not a single Syllable of Truth in what those Vil∣lains said. Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> hath now discovered the whole Matter. It seems these Fellows were employed by a Lord, who is a Rival of poor Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> to have pressed him on board a Ship.—I assure them I don't know who they will press next. Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> here hath seen the Officer himself, who is a very pretty Gentleman, and hath told him all, and is very sorry for what he undertook, which he would never have done had he known Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> to have been a Gentleman; but he was told that he was a common strolling Vagabond.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> stared at all this, and declared he was a Stranger to every Word she said. <Q REND="inline">'Yes, Sir,' an∣swered she, 'I believe you are.—It is a very different Story, I believe, from what those Fellows told the Lawyer.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'What Lawyer, Madam? what is it you mean?'</Q> said <HI>Allworthy.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'Nay, nay,' said she, 'this is so like you to deny your own Goodness; but Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> here saw him,'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Saw whom, Ma∣dam?'</Q> answered he. <Q REND="inline">'Why your Lawyer, Sir,' said she, 'that you so kindly sent to enquire into the Affair.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I am still in the Dark, upon my Ho∣nour,'</Q> said <HI>Allworthy.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'Why then do you tell him, my dear Sir,'</Q> cries she. <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir,' said <HI>Nightingale,</HI> 'I did see that very Lawyer who went from you when I came into the Room, at an Ale∣house in <HI>Aldersgate,</HI> in Company with two of the Fellows who were employed by Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> to press Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> and who were by that Means pre∣sent at the unhappy Rencounter between him and Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick.</HI>'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I own, Sir,' said Mrs. <HI>Mil∣ler,</HI> 'when I saw this Gentleman come into the Room to you, I told Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> that I apprehended you had sent him thither to enquire in∣to the Affair.'</Q> <HI>Allworthy</HI> shewed Marks of Asto∣nishment
<PB N="300" REF="305"/>
in his Countenance at this News, and was indeed for two or three Minutes struck dumb by it. At last, addressing himself to Mr. <HI>Nightingale,</HI> he said, <Q REND="inline">'I must confess myself, Sir, more surprized at what you tell me, than I have ever been before at any Thing in my whole Life. Are you certain this was the Gentleman?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I am most certain,'</Q> answered <HI>Nightingale.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'At <HI>Aldersgate?'</HI></Q> cries <HI>All∣worthy.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'And was you in Company with this Law∣yer and the two Fellows?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'I was, Sir,' said the other, 'very near half an Hour.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Well, Sir,' said <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'and in what Manner did the Law∣yer behave? Did you hear all that past between him and the Fellows?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'No, Sir, answered <HI>Night∣ingale,</HI> 'they had been together before I came—In my Presence the Lawyer said little; but after I had several Times examined the Fellows, who per∣sisted in a Story directly contrary to what I had heard from Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> and what I find by Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> was a rank Falshood, the Lawyer then desired the Fellows to say nothing but what was the Truth, and seemed to speak so much in Favour of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> that when I saw the same Person with you, I concluded your Goodness had promp∣ted you to send him thither.</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'And did you not send him thither?'</Q> says Mrs <HI>Miller.—'</HI><Q REND="inline">'Indeed I did not,' answered <HI>Allworthy;</HI> 'nor did I know he had gone on such an Errand 'till this Moment.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'I see it all!' said Mrs. <HI>Miller:</HI> 'Upon my Soul, I see it all! No wonder they have been closet∣ted so close lately. Son <HI>Nightingale,</HI> let me beg you run for these Fellows immediately—find them out if they are above Ground. I will go myself.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Dear Madam,' said <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'be patient, and do me the Favour to send a Servant up Stairs to call Mr. <HI>Dowling</HI> hither, if he be in the House, or if not, Mr. <HI>Blifil.</HI>'</Q> Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> went out mut∣tering
<PB N="301" REF="306"/>
something to herself, and presently returned with an Answer. <Q REND="inline">'That Mr. <HI>Dowling</HI> was gone; but that the t'other, as she called him, was coming.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> was of a cooler Disposition than the good Woman, whose Spirits were all up in Arms in the Cause of her Friend. He was not however with∣out some Suspicions which were near a-kin to hers. When <HI>Blifil</HI> came into the Room, he asked him with a very serious Countenance, and with a less friendly Look than he had ever before given him, <Q REND="inline">'Whether he knew any Thing of Mr. <HI>Dowling'</HI>s having seen any of the Persons who were present at the Duel between <HI>Jones</HI> and another Gentleman?'</Q></P>
<P>There is nothing so dangerous as a Question which comes by Surprize on a Man, whose Business it is to conceal Truth, or defend Falshood. For which Rea∣son those worthy Personages, whose noble Office it is to save the Lives of their Fellow-Creatures at the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> take the utmost Care, by frequent previ∣ous Examination, to divine every Question which may be asked their Clients on the Day of Trial, that they may be supply'd with proper and ready Answers, which the most fertile Invention cannot supply in an Instant. Besides, the sudden and violent Impulse on the Blood, occasioned by these Surprizes, occasions frequently such an Alteration in the Countenance, that the Man is obliged to give Evidence against himself. And such indeed were the Alterations which the Countenance of <HI>Blifil</HI> underwent from this sudden Question, that we can scarce blame the Eagerness of Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> who immediately cry'd out, <Q REND="inline">'Guilty, upon my Honour! Guilty, upon my Soul!'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> sharply rebuked her for this Impe∣tuosity; and then turning to <HI>Blifil,</HI> who seemed sink∣ing into the Earth, he said, <Q REND="inline">'Why do you hesitate, Sir, at giving me an Answer? You certainly must have employed him, for he would not, of his own
<PB N="302" REF="307"/>
Accord, I believe, have undertaken such an Er∣rand, and especially without acquainting me.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Blifil</HI> then answered, <Q REND="inline">'I own, Sir, I have been guilty of an Offence, yet may I hope your Par∣don?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'My Pardon?'</Q> said <HI>Allworthy</HI> very an∣grily.—<Q REND="inline">'Nay, Sir,' answered <HI>Blifil,</HI> 'I knew you would be offended; yet surely my dear Uncle will forgive the Effects of the most amiable of Hu∣man Weaknesses. Compassion for those who do not deserve it, I own, is a Crime; and yet it is a Crime from which you yourself are not entirely free. I know I have been guilty of it in more than one Instance to this very Person; and I will own I did send Mr. <HI>Dowling,</HI> not on a vain and fruitless Enquiry, but to discover the Witnesses, and to en∣deavour to soften their Evidence. This, Sir, is the Truth; which though I intended to conceal from you, I will not deny.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I confess,' said <HI>Nightingale,</HI> 'this is the Light in which it appeared to me from the Gentleman's Behaviour.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Now, Madam,' said <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'I believe you will once in your Life own you have entertained a wrong Suspicion, and are not so angry with my Nephew as you was.'</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> was silent; for though she could not so hastily be pleased with <HI>Blifil,</HI> whom she looked upon to have been the Ruin of <HI>Jones,</HI> yet in this par∣ticular Instance he had imposed upon her as well as the rest; so entirely had the Devil stood his Friend. And, indeed, I look upon the vulgar Observation, <HI>That the Devil often deserts his Friends, and leaves them in the Lurch,</HI> to be a great Abuse on that Gen∣tleman's Character. Perhaps he may sometimes de∣sert those who are only his Cup Acquaintance; or who, at most, are but half his; but he generally stands by those who are thoroughly his Servants, and
<PB N="303" REF="308"/>
helps them off in all Extremities 'till their Bargain expires.</P>
<P>As a conquered Rebellion strengthens a Govern∣ment, or as Health is more perfectly established by Recovery from some Diseases; so Anger, when re∣moved, often gives new Life to Affection. This was the Case of Mr. <HI>Allworthy;</HI> for <HI>Blifil</HI> having wiped off the greater Suspicion, the lesser, which had been raised by <HI>Square'</HI>s Letter, sunk of Course, and was forgotten; and <HI>Thwackum,</HI> with whom he was great∣ly offended, bore alone all the Reflections which <HI>Square</HI> had cast on the Enemies of <HI>Jones.</HI></P>
<P>As for that young Man, the Resentment of Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> began more and more to abate towards him. He told <HI>Blifil,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'he did not only forgive the extraordinary Efforts of his Good-Nature, but would give him the Pleasure of following his Ex∣ample.'</Q> Then turning to Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> with a Smile which would have become an Angel, he cry'd, <Q REND="inline">'What say you, Madam; shall we take a Hackney-Coach, and all of us together pay a Visit to your Friend? I promise you it is not the first Visit I have made in a Prison.'</Q></P>
<P>Every Reader, I believe, will be able to answer for the worthy Woman; but they must have a great deal of Good-Nature, and be well acquainted with Friendship, who can feel what she felt on this Occa∣sion. Few, I hope, are capable of feeling what now past in the Mind of <HI>Blifil;</HI> but those who are, will acknowledge, that it was impossible for him to raise any Objection to this Visit. Fortune, however, or the Gentleman lately mentioned above, stood his Friend, and prevented his undergoing so great a Shock: For at the very Instant when the Coach was sent for, <HI>Partridge</HI> arrived, and having called Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> from the Company, acquainted her with the dreadful Accident lately come to Light; and hearing Mr. <HI>All∣worthy'</HI>s
<PB N="304" REF="309"/>
Intention, begged her to find some Means of stopping him; for says he, <Q REND="inline">'the Matter must at all Hazards be kept a Secret from him; and if he should now go, he will find Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> and his Mother, who arrived just as I left him, lamenting over one another the horrid Crime they have ignorantly com∣mitted.'</Q></P>
<P>The poor Woman, who was almost deprived of her Senses at this dreadful News, was never less cap∣able of Invention than at present. However, as Wo∣men are much readier at this than Men, she bethought herself of an Excuse, and returning to <HI>Allworthy</HI> said, <Q REND="inline">'I am sure, Sir, you will be surprized at hearing any Objection from me to the kind Proposal you just now made; and yet I am afraid of the Consequence of it, if carried immediately into Execution. You must imagine, Sir, that all the Calamities which have lately befallen this poor young Fellow, must have thrown him into the lowest Dejection of Spi∣rits: And now, Sir, should we all on a sudden fling him into such a violent Fit of Joy, as I know your Presence will occasion, it may, I am afraid, produce some fatal Mischief, especially as his Ser∣vant who is without, tells me he is very far from being well.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Is his Servant without?' cries <HI>Allworthy;</HI> 'pray call him hither. I will ask him some Questions con∣cerning his Master.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Partridge</HI> was at first afraid to appear before Mr. <HI>Allworthy;</HI> but was at length persuaded, after Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> who had often heard his whole Story from his own Mouth, had promised to introduce him.</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> recollected <HI>Partridge</HI> the Moment he came into the Room, though many Years had passed since he had seen him. Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> therefore might have spared here a formal Oration, in which indeed she was somewhat prolix: For the Reader, I believe,
<PB N="305" REF="310"/>
may have observed already that the good Woman, a∣mong other Things, had a Tongue always ready for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Service of her Friends.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'And are you,' said <HI>Allworthy</HI> to <HI>Partridge,</HI> 'the Servant of Mr. <HI>Jones?'</HI>'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I can't say, Sir,' an∣swered he, 'that I am regularly a Servant, but I live with him, an't please your Honour, at present. <HI>Non sum qualis eram,</HI> as your Honour very well knows.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> then asked him many Questions con∣cerning <HI>Jones,</HI> as to his Health and other Matters; to all which <HI>Partridge</HI> answered, without having the least Regard to what was, but considered only what he would have Things appear; for a strict Adherence to Truth was not among the Articles of this honest Fel∣low's Morality or his Religion.</P>
<P>During this Dialogue Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> took his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eave, and presently after Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> lest the Room, then <HI>Allworthy</HI> likewise dispatched <HI>Blifil;</HI> for he ima∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined that <HI>Partridge,</HI> when alone with him, would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore explicit than before Company. They were no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oner left in private together, than <HI>Allworthy</HI> began <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the following Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>In which the History is farther continued.</HI></HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">'SURE, Friend,' said the good Man, 'you are the strangest of all Human Beings. Not only to have suffered as you have formerly, for obstinate∣ly persisting in a Falshood; but to persist in it thus to the last, and to pass thus upon the World for the Servant of your own Son? What Interest can you have in all this? What can be your Motive?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I see, Sir,' said <HI>Partridge,</HI> falling down upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Knees, 'that your Honour is prepossessed against me, and resolved not to believe any Thing I say,
<PB N="306" REF="311"/>
and therefore what signifies my Protestations; but yet there is one above who knows that I am not the Father of this young Man.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'How!' said <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'Will you yet deny what you was formerly convicted of upon such unanswer∣able, such manifest Evidence? Nay, what a Con∣firmation is your being now found with this very Man, of all which twenty Years ago appeared a∣gainst you. I thought you had left the Country; nay, I thought you had been long since dead.—In what Manner did you know any Thing of this young Man? Where did you meet with him, un∣less you had kept some Correspondence together. Do not deny this; for I promise you it will greatly raise your Son in my Opinion, to find that he hath such a Sense of filial Duty, as privately to support his Father for so many Years.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'If your Honour will have Patience to hear me,' said <HI>Partridge,</HI> 'I will tell you all.'—Being bid go on, he proceeded thus: 'When your Honour conceived that Displeasure against me, it ended in my Ruin soon after; for I lost my little School; and the Minister, thinking I suppose it would be a∣greeable to your Honour, turned me out from the Office of Clerk; so that I had nothing to trust to but the Barber's Shop, which, in a Country Place like that, is a poor Livelihood; and when my Wife died, (for 'till that Time I received a Pension of 12 <HI>l.</HI> a Year from an unknown Hand, which in∣deed I believe was your Honour's own, for no Bo∣dy that ever I heard of doth these Things besides) but as I was saying, when she died, this Pension for∣sook me; so that now as I owed two or three small Debts, which began to be troublesome to me, (par∣ticulary one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a Fact which I knew happen to a poor Clergyman in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> by the Villainy of an Attorney, who not contented with the exorbitant Costs to which the poor Man was put by a single Action, brought afterwards another Action on the Judgment, as it is called.

<P><Q REND="inline">'The first Place I came to was <HI>Salisbury,</HI> where I got into the Service of a Gentleman belonging to the Law, and one of the best Gentlemen that ever I knew; for he was not only good to me, but I know a thousand good and charitable Acts which he did while I staid with him; and I have known him of∣ten refuse Business because it was paultry and op∣pressive.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'You need not be so particular,' said <HI>Allworthy;</HI> 'I know this Gentleman, and a very worthy Man he is, and an Honour to his Profession.'</Q> —<Q REND="inline">'Well, Sir,' continued <HI>Partridge,</HI> 'from hence I removed to <HI>Lymmington,</HI> where I was a∣bove three Years in the Service of another Lawyer, who was likewise a very good Sort of a Man, and to be sure one of the merriest Gentlemen in <HI>England.</HI> Well, Sir, at the End of the three Years I set up a little School, and was likely to do well again, had it not been for a most unlucky Accident. Here I kept a Pig; and one Day, as ill Fortune would have it, this Pig broke out, and did a Trespass I think they call it, in a Garden belonging to one of my Neighbours, who was a proud, revengeful Man, and employed a Lawyer, one—one—I can't think of his Name; but he sent for a writ against me, and had me to Size. When I came there, Lord have Mercy upon me—to hear what the
<PB N="308" REF="313"/>
Counsellor said. There was one that told my Lord a Parcel of the confoundedst Lies about me; he said, that I used to drive my Hogs into other Folks Gar∣dens, and a great deal more; and at last he said, He hoped I had at last brought my Hogs to a fair Mar∣ket. To be sure, one wou'd have thought, that instead of being Owner only of one poor little Pig, I had been the greatest Hog-Merchant in <HI>England.</HI> Well'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Pray,' said <HI>Allworthy,</HI> do not be so particular. I have heard nothing of your Son yet.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'O it was a great many Years,' answered <HI>Partridge,</HI> before I saw my Son, as you are pleased to call him—I went over to <HI>Ireland</HI> after this, and taught School at <HI>Cork,</HI> (for that one Suit ruined me again, and I lay seven Years in <HI>Winchester</HI> Goal.)'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Well,' said <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'pass that over till your Re∣turn to <HI>England.</HI></Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Then, Sir,' said he, 'it was about half a Year ago that I landed at <HI>Bristol,</HI> where I stayed some Time, and not finding it do there, and hearing of a Place between that and <HI>Gloucester,</HI> where the Barber was just dead, I went thither, and there I had been about two Months, when Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> came thither.'</Q> He then gave <HI>All∣worthy</HI> a very particular Account of their first Meeting, and of every Thing as well as he could remember, which had happened from that Day to this, frequently interlarding his Story with Panegyricks on <HI>Jones,</HI> and not forgetting to insinuate the great Love and Respect which he had for <HI>Allworthy.</HI> He concluded with say∣ing, <Q REND="inline">'Now, Sir, I have told your Honour the whole Truth:' And then repeated a most solemn Protes∣tation, 'That he was no more the Father of <HI>Jones</HI> then of the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> and imprecated the most birt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ses on his Head if he did not speak Truth.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'What am I to think of this Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter?' cries <HI>All∣worthy</HI> 'For what Purpose should you so strongly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it would be rather your

Interest to own?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Nay, Sir', answered <HI>Partridge,</HI> (for he could hold no longer) 'if your Honour will not believe me, you are like soon to have satisfac∣tion enough. I wish you had mistaken the Mother of this young Man, as well as you have his Father.'</Q>—And now being asked what he meant, with all the Symptoms of Horror both in his Voice and Coun∣tenance, he told <HI>Allworthy</HI> the whole Story, which he had a little before expressed such Desire to Mrs. <HI>Mil∣ler</HI> to conceal from him.</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> was almost as much shocked at this Dis∣covery as <HI>Partridge</HI> himself had been while he related it. <Q REND="inline">'Good Heavens!' says he, 'in what miserable Distresses do Vice and Imprudence involve Men! How much beyond our Designs are the Effects of Wickedness sometimes carrried!'</Q> He had scarce uttered these Words, when Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> came hastily and abruptly into the Room. <HI>Partridge</HI> no sooner saw her, than he cry'd, <Q REND="inline">'Here, Sir, here is the very Woman herself. This is the unfortunate Mother of Mr. <HI>Jones;</HI> I am sure she will acquit me before your Honour.—Pray, Madam—'</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> without paying any Regard to what <HI>Partridge</HI> said, and almost without taking any No∣tice of him, advanced to Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'I believe, Sir, It is so long since I had the Honour of seeing you, that you do not recollect me.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Indeed,' an∣swered <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'you are so very much altered, on many Accounts, that had not this Man already ac∣quainted me who you are, I should not have immedi∣ately called you to my Remembrance. Have you, Ma∣dam any particular Business which brings you to me?'</Q><HI>—Allworthy</HI> spoke this with great Reserve; for the Reader may easily believe he was not well pleased with the Conduct of this Lady; neither with what he had formerly heard, nor with what <HI>Partridge</HI> had now delivered.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="315"/>
Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> answered,—<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir, I have very particular Business with you; and it is such as I can only impart to yourself.—I must desire therefore the Favour of a Word with you alone; for I assure you what I have to tell you is of the utmost Importance.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Partridge</HI> was then ordered to withdraw, but be∣fore he went, he begged the Lady to satisfy Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> that he was perfectly innocent. To which she answered—<Q REND="inline">'You need be under no Appre∣hension, Sir, I shall satisfy Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> very per∣fectly of that Matter.'</Q></P>
<P>Then <HI>Partridge</HI> withdrew, and that past between Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> which is written in the next Chapter.</P>

Just after your Depar∣ture for <HI>London,</HI> Miss <HI>Bridget</HI> came one Day to the House of my Mother. She was pleased to say she had heard an extraordinary Character of me for my Learning and superior Understanding to all the young Women there, so she was pleased to say. She then bid me come to her to the great House, where when I attended, she employed me to read to her. She expressed great Satisfaction in my reading, shewed great Kindness to me, and made me many Presents. At last she began to catechise me on the Subject of Secrecy, to which I gave her such sa∣tisfactory Answers, that at last having locked the
<PB N="313" REF="318"/>
Door of her Room, she took me into her Closet, and then locking that Door likewise, she said she should convince me of the vast Reliance she had on my Integrity, by communicating a Secret in which her Honour and consequently her Life was concerned. She then stopt, and after a Silence of a Minute, during which she often wiped her Eyes, she en∣quired of me, if I thought my Mother might safely be confided in. I answered I would stake my Life on her Fidelity. She then imparted to me the great Secret which laboured in her Breast, and which, I believe, was delivered with more Pains than she afterwards suffered in Child-birth. It was then contrived, that my Mother and myself only should attend at the Time, and that Mrs. <HI>Wilkins</HI> should be sent out of the Way, as she accordingly was to the very furthest Part of <HI>Dorsetshire</HI> to en∣quire the Character of a Servant; for the Lady had turned away her own Maid near three Months be∣fore, during all which Time I officiated about her Person, upon Trial as she said, tho', as she after∣wards declared, I was not sufficiently handy for the Place. This and many other such Things which she used to say of me, were all thrown out to prevent any Suspicion which <HI>Wilkins</HI> might here∣after have when I was to own the Child; for she thought it could never be believed she would venture to hurt a young Woman with whom she had intrusted such a Secret. You may be assured, Sir, I was well paid for all these Affronts, which, together with being informed of the Occasion of them, very well contented me. Indeed the Lady had a greater Suspicion of Mrs. <HI>Wilkins</HI> than of any other Person; not that she had the least Aversion to the Gentlewoman, but she thought her incapable of keeping a Secret, especially from you, Sir: For I have often heard Miss <HI>Bridget</HI> say, that if Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> had committed a Murder, she believ∣ed
<PB N="314" REF="319"/>
she would acquaint you with it. At last the expected Day came, and Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> who had been kept a Week in Readiness, and put off from Time to Time, upon some Pretence or other, that she might not return too soon, was dispatched. Then the Child was born in the Presence only of my∣self and my Mother, and was by my Mother conveyed to her own House, where it was privately kept by her till the Evening of your Return, when I, by the Command of Miss <HI>Bridget</HI> conveyed it into the Bed where you found it.' And all Suspicions were afterwards laid asleep by the artful Conduct of your Sister, in pretending Ill-will to the Boy, and that any Regard she shew'd him was out of meer Com∣plaisance to you.'</Q> Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> then made many Pro∣testations of the Truth of this Story, and conclud∣ed by saying, <Q REND="inline">'Thus, Sir, you have at last disco∣vered your Nephew, for so I am sure you will here∣after think him, and I question not but he will be both an Honour and a Comfort to you under that Appel∣lation.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I need not Madam, said <HI>Allworthy,</HI> express my Astonishment at what you have told me; and yet surely you would not, and could not, have put together so many Circumstances to evidence an Untruth. I confess, I recollect some Passages relating to that <HI>Sum∣mer,</HI> which formerly gave me a Conceit that my Sister had some Liking to him. I mentioned it to her: For I had such a Regard to the young Man, as well on his own account, as on his Father's, that I should have willingly consented to a Match between them; but she exprest the highest Disdain of my unkind Sus∣picion, as she called it, so that I never more spoke on the Subject. Good Heaven! well, the Lord disposeth all Things.—Yet sure it was a most unjusti∣fiable Conduct in my Sister to carry this Secret with her out of the World.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I promise you, Sir,' said Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> always profest a contrary Intention, and frequently told me she intended one Day to com∣municate
<PB N="315" REF="320"/>
it to you. She said indeed, she was high∣ly rejoiced that her Plot had succeeded so well, and that you had of your own accord taken such a Fan∣cy to the Child, that it was yet unnecessary to make any express Declaration. Oh! Sir, had that Lady lived to have seen this poor young Man turned like a Vagabond from your House; nay, Sir, could she have lived to hear that you had yourself employed a Lawyer to prosecute him for a Murder of which he was not guilty—Forgive me, Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> I must say it was unkind.—Indeed you have been abused, he never deserved it of you.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Ma∣dam,' said <HI>Alworthy,</HI> 'I have been abused by the Person whoever he was that told you so.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Nay, Sir,' said she, 'I would not be mistaken, I did not presume to say you were guilty of any wrong. The Gentleman who came to me, proposed no such Mat∣ter: He only said, taking me for Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick'</HI>s Wife, that if Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> had murdered my Husband, I should be assisted with any Money I wanted to carry on the Prosecution, by a very worthy Gentle∣man, who, he said, was well apprized what a Vil∣lain I had to deal with. It was by this Man I found out who Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was; and this Man, whose Name is <HI>Dowling,</HI> Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> tells me, is your Ste∣ward. I discovered his Name by a very odd Acci∣dent, for he himself refused to tell it me; but <HI>Par∣tridge,</HI> who met him at my Lodgings the second Time he came, knew him formerly at <HI>Salisbury.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'And did this Mr. <HI>Dowling,'</HI> says <HI>Allworthy,</HI> with great Astonishment in his Countenance, 'tell you that I would assist in the Prosecution?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'No, Sir', answered she, 'I will not charge him wrongfully. He said, I should be assisted, but he mentioned no Name.—Yet you must pardon me, Sir, if from Circumstances I thought it could be no other.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Madam', says <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'from Cir∣cumstances

I am too well convinced it was another.—Good Heaven, by what wonderful Means is the blackest and deepest Villany sometimes disco∣vered!—Shall I beg you, Madam, to stay till the Person you have mentioned comes, for I expect him every Minute; nay, he may be perhaps already in the House.'</Q> <HI>Allworthy</HI> then stept to the Door, in order to call a Servant, when in came, not Mr. <HI>Dowling,</HI> but the Gentleman who will be seen in the next Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Further Continuation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Gentleman who now arrived was no other than Mr. <HI>Western.</HI> He no sooner saw <HI>Allwor∣thy,</HI> than without considering in the least the Presence of Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> he began to vociferate in the follow∣ing Manner. <Q REND="inline">'Fine Doings at my House! A rare Kettle of Fish I have discovered at last; who the Devil would be plagued with a Daughter?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'What's the Matter, Neighbour, said <HI>Allworthy,'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'Matter enough, answered <HI>Western,</HI> when I thought she was a just coming to, nay, when she had in a Manner promised me to do as I would ha her, and when I was a hoped to have had nothing more to do than to have a sent for the Lawyer and finished all. What do you think I have found out? that the little B—hath bin playing Tricks with me all the while, and carrying on a Correspondence with that Bastard of yours. Sister <HI>Western,</HI> whom I have a quarrelled with upon her Account, sent me Word o't, and I ordered her Pockets to be searched when she was asleep, and here I have got un signed with the Son of a Whore's own Name. I have not had Patience to read half o't, for 'tis longer than one of Parson <HI>Supple'</HI>s Sermons; but I find plainly it is all about
<PB N="317" REF="322"/>
Love, and indeed what should it be else? I have packed her up in Chamber again, and To-morrow Morning down she goes into the Country, unless she confents to be married directly, and there she shall live in a Garret upon Bread and Water all her Days; and the sooner such a B—breaks her Heart the better, though d—n her, that I believe is too tough. She will live long enough to plague me.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Mr. <HI>Western,</HI> answered <HI>Allworthy,</HI> you know I have always protested against Force, and you yourself consented that none should be used.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Ay, cries, he, that was only upon Condition that she would consent without. What the Devil and Doctor <HI>Faustus,</HI> shan't I do what I will with my own Daughter, especially when I desire nothing but her own Good?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Well, Neighbour, answer∣ed <HI>Allworthy,</HI> if you will give me Leave, I will un∣dertake once to argue with the young Lady.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Will you, said <HI>Western,</HI> why that is kind now and neigh∣bourly, and mayhap you will do more than I have been able to do with her; for I promise you she hath a very good Opinion of you.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Well, Sir, said <HI>Allworthy,</HI> if you will go Home and release the young Lady from her Captivity, I will wait upon her within this half Hour.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'But suppose,' said <HI>Western,</HI> 'she should run away with un in the mean Time? for Lawyer <HI>Dowling</HI> tells me there is no Hopes of hanging the Fellow at last, for that the Man is alive, and like to do well, and that he thinks <HI>Jones</HI> will be out of Prison again presently.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'How, said <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'what did you employ him then to enquire or to do any Thing in that Matter?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Not I, answered <HI>Western,</HI> 'he mentioned it to me just now of his own Accord.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Just now!' cries <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'why where did you see him then? I want much to see Mr. <HI>Dowling.'—'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'Why you may see un an you will presently at my Lodgings;
<PB N="318" REF="323"/>
for there is to be a Meeting of Lawyers there this Morning, about a Mortgage.—Icod! I shall lose two or dree Thousand Pounds, I believe, by that honest Gentleman, Mr. <HI>Nightingale.'</HI></Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Well, Sir, said <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'I will be with you within the half Hour.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'And do for once, cries the Squire, take a Fool's Advice; never think of dealing with her by gentle Methods, take my Word for it, those will never do. I have try'd um long enough. She must be frightned into it, there is no other Way. Tell her I'm her Father, and of the horrid Sin of Dis∣obedience, and of the dreadful Punishment of it in t'other World, and then tell her about being lock'd up all her Life in a Garret in this, and be kept on∣ly upon Bread and Water.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I will do all I can, said <HI>Allworthy,</HI> for I promise you there is nothing I wish more than an Alliance with this amiable Creature.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Nay, the Girl is well enough for Matter o' that, cries the Squire, a Man may go farther and meet with worse Meat; that I may declare o' her, thof she be my own Daughter. And if she will but be obedient to me, there is no'orow a Father within a hundred Miles o' the Place that loves a Daughter better than I do; but I see you are busy with the Lady here, so I will go Huome and expect you, and so your humble Servant.'</Q></P>
<P>As soon as Mr. <HI>Western</HI> was gone, Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> said, <Q REND="inline">'I see, Sir, the Squire hath not the least Re∣membrance of my Face. I believe, Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> you would not have known me neither. I am ve∣ry considerably altered since that Day when you so kindly gave me that Advice, which I had been happy had I followed.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Madam, cries, <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'it gave me great Concern when I first heard the contrary.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir,' says she, 'I was ruined by a very deep Scheme of Villany, which if you knew, though I pretend not to think
<PB N="319" REF="324"/>
it would justify me in your Opinion, it would at¦least mitigate my Offence, and induce you to pity me; you are not now at Leisure to hear my whole Story; but this I assure you, I was betrayed by the most solemn Promise, of Marriage; nay in the Eye of Heaven I was married to him; for after much reading on the Subject, I am convinced that parti∣cular Ceremonies are only requisite to give a legal Sanction to Marriage, and have only a worldly Use in giving a Woman the Privileges of a Wife; but that she who lives constant to one Man, after a solemn private Affiance, whatever the World may call her, hath little to charge on her own Consci∣ence.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I am sorry, Madam,' said <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'you made so ill an Use of your Learning. Indeed it would have been well that you had been possessed of much more, or had remained in a State of Ignorance. And yet, Madam, I am afraid you have more than this Sin to answer for.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'During his Life, answered she, which was above a Dozen Years, I most so∣lemnly assure you, I had not. And consider, Sir, on my Behalf, what is in the Power of a Woman stript of her Reputation, and left destitute, whether the good-natured World will suffer such a stray Sheep to return to the Road of Virtue, even if she was ne∣ver so desirous. I protest then I would have chose it had it been in my Power; but Necessity drove me into the Arms of Capt. <HI>Waters,</HI> with whom, though still unmarried, I lived as a Wife for many Years, and went by his Name. I parted with this Gentleman at <HI>Worcester,</HI> on his March against the Rebels, and it was then I accidentally met with Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> who rescued me from the Hands of a Villain. Indeed he is the worthiest of Men. No young Gentleman of his Age is, I believe, freer from Vice, and few have the twentieth Part of his Virtues; nay, whatever Vices he hath had, I am firmly persuaded he hath now taken a Resolution to
<PB N="320" REF="325"/>
abandon them.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I hope he hath, cries <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and I hope he will preserve that Resolution. I must say I have still the same Hopes with Regard to yourself. The World, I do agree, are apt to be too unmerciful on these Occasions, yet Time and Perseverance will get the better of this their Disin∣clination, as I may call it, to Pity, for though they are not, like Heaven ready to receive a penitent Sin∣ner, yet a continued Repentance will at length ob∣tain Mercy even with the World. This you may be assured of, Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> that whenever I find you are sincere in such good Intentions, you shall want no Assistance in my Power to make them ef∣fectual.'</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> fell now upon her Knees before him, and in a Flood of Tears made him many most passio∣nate Acknowledgments of his Goodness, which, as she truely said, savoured more of the divine than hu∣man Nature.</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> raised her up, and spoke in the most ten∣der Manner, making use of every Expression which his Invention could suggest to comfort her, when he was interrupted by the Arrival of Mr. <HI>Dowling,</HI> who, up∣on his first Entrance, seeing Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> started, and appeared in some Confusion; from which he soon recovered himself as well as he could, and then said, he was in the utmost Haste to attend Council at Mr. <HI>Western'</HI>s Lodgings; but however thought it his Duty to call and acquaint him with the Opinion of Council upon the Case which he had before told him, which was that the Conversion of the Moneys in that Case could not be questioned in a Criminal Cause, but that an Action of Trover might be brought, and if it ap∣peared to the Jury to be the Moneys of Plaintiff, that Plaintiff would recover a Verdict for the Value.</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy,</HI> without making any Answer to this, bolted the Door, and then advancing with a stern Look to <HI>Dowling,</HI> he said, <Q REND="inline">'Whatever be your
<PB N="321" REF="326"/>
Haste, Sir, I must first receive an Answer to some Questions. Do you know this young Lady?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'That Lady, Sir?'</Q> answered <HI>Dowling</HI> with great Hesitation. <HI>Allworthy</HI> then, with the most solemn Voice, said, <Q REND="inline">'Look you, Mr. <HI>Dowling,</HI> as you va∣lue my Favour, or your Continuance a Moment longer in my Service, do not hesitate nor preva∣ricate; but answer faithfully and truly to every Question I ask.—Do you know this Lady?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Yes, Sir, said <HI>Dowling,</HI> I have seen the Lady.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Where, Sir?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'At her own Lodgings.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Upon what Business did you go thither, Sir, and who sent you?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I went, Sir, to enquire, Sir, about Mr. <HI>Jones.'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'And who sent you to enquire about him?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Who, Sir, why, Sir, Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> sent me.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'And what did you say to the Lady concerning that Matter?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Nay, Sir, it is impossible to recollect eve∣ry Word.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Will you please, Madam, to assist the Gentleman's Memory?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'He told me, Sir, said Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> that if Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> had murdered my Husband, I should be assisted by any Money I want∣ed to carry on the Prosecution, by a very worthy Gentleman, who was well apprized what a Villain I had to deal with. These I can safely swear were the very Words he spoke.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Were these the Words, Sir, said <HI>Allworthy?'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'I cannot charge my Memory exactly, cries <HI>Dowling,</HI> but I believe I did speak to that Purpose.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'And did Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> order you to say so?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I am sure, Sir, I should not have gone on my own Accord, nor have wil∣lingly exceeded my Authority in Matters of this Kind. If I said so, I must have so understood Mr. <HI>Blifil'</HI>s Instructions.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Look you, Mr. <HI>Dowling,</HI> said <HI>Allworthy,</HI> I promise you before this Lady, that whatever you have done in this Affair by Mr. <HI>Blifil'</HI>s Order, I will forgive, provided you now tell me strictly the Truth; for I believe what you
<PB N="322" REF="327"/>
say, that you would not have acted of your own Accord, and without Authority, in this Matter.—Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> then likewise sent you to examine the two Fellows at <HI>Aldersgate?'</HI></Q>—<Q REND="inline">'He did, Sir,'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Well, and what Instructions did he then give you? Recollect as well as you can, and tell me, as near as possible, the very Words he used.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Why, Sir, Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> sent me to find out the Persons who were Eye-Witnesses of this Fight. He said he fear∣ed they might be tampered with by Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> or some of his Friends. He said, Blood required Blood; and that not only all who concealed a Mur∣derer, but those who omitted any Thing in their Power to bring him to Justice, were Sharers in his Guilt. He said, he found you was very desirous of having the Villain brought to Justice, though it was not proper you should appear in it.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Did he so?</Q> says <HI>Allworthy.—</HI><Q REND="inline">'Yes, Sir, cries <HI>Dowling,</HI> I should not, I am sure, have proceeded such Lengths for the sake of any other Person living but your Worship.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'What Lengths, Sir,</Q> said <HI>Allworthy.—</HI><Q REND="inline">'Nay, Sir, cries <HI>Dowling,</HI> I would not have your Worship think I would, on any Ac∣count, be guilty of Subordination of Perjury; but there are two Ways of delivering Evidence. I told them therefore that if any Offers should be made them on the other Side, they should refuse them, and that they might be assured they should lose no∣thing by being honest Men, and telling the Truth. I said, we were told, that Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> had assaulted the Gentleman first, and that if that was the Truth, they should declare it; and I did give them some Hints that they should be no Losers.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'I think you went Lengths indeed,'</Q> cries <HI>Allworthy.—</HI><Q REND="inline">'Nay, Sir', answered <HI>Dowling,</HI> 'I am sure I did not desire them to tell an Untruth,—nor should I have said what I did, unless it had been to oblige you.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'You would not have thought, I believe, says <HI>All∣worthy,</HI>
<PB N="323" REF="328"/>
to have obliged me, had you known that this Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was my own Nephew.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'—I am sure, Sir, answered he, it did not become me to take any Notice of what I thought you desired to conceal.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'—How, cries <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and did you know it then?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Nay Sir, answered <HI>Dowling,</HI> if your Worship bids me speak the Truth, I am sure I shall do it.—Indeed, Sir, I did know it; for they were almost the last Words which Madam <HI>Bli∣fil</HI> ever spoke, which she mentioned to me as I stood alone by her Bedside, when she delivered me the Letter I brought your Worship from her.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'What Letter, cries <HI>Allworthy?'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'—'The Letter, Sir, answered <HI>Dowling,</HI> which I brought from <HI>Salis∣bury,</HI> and which I delivered into the Hands of Mr. <HI>Blifil.'—'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'O Heavens!' cries <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'well, and what were the Words? What did my Sister say to you?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'She took me by the Hand, answered he, and as she delivered me the Letter, said, I scarce know what I have written. Tell my Bro∣ther, Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> is his Nephew—He is my Son—Bless him, says she, and then fell backward, as if dying away. I presently called in the People, and she never spoke more to me, and dy'd within a few Minutes afterwards.'</Q><HI>—Allworthy</HI> stood a Minute silent, lifting up his Eyes, and then turning to <HI>Dowl∣ing,</HI> said,—<Q REND="inline">'How came you, Sir, not to deliver me this Message?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Your Worship, answered he, must remember that you was at that Time ill in Bed; and being in a violent Hurry, as indeed I al∣ways am, I delivered the Letter and Message to Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> who told me he would carry them both to you, which he hath since told me he did, and that your Worship, partly out of Friendship to Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> and partly out of Regard to your Sister, would never have it mentioned; and did intend to conceal it from the World; and therefore, Sir, if you had not mentioned it to me first, I am certain I
<PB N="324" REF="329"/>
should never have thought it belonged to me to say any Thing of the Matter, either to your Worship, or any other Person.'</Q></P>
<P>We have remarked somewhere already, that it is possible for a Man to convey a Lie in the Words of Truth; this was the Case at present: For <HI>Blifil,</HI> had in Fact told <HI>Dowling</HI> what he now related; but had not imposed upon him, nor indeed had imagined that he was able so to do. In Reality, the Promises which <HI>Blifil</HI> had made to <HI>Dowling,</HI> were the Motives which had induced him to Secrecy; and as he very plainly saw he should not be able to keep them, he thought pro∣per now to make this Confession, which the Promis∣es of Forgiveness, joined to the Threats, the Voice, the Looks of <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and the Discoveries he had made before, extorted from him, who was besides taken unawares, and had no Time to consider of E∣vasions.</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> appeared well satisfied with this Relation, and having enjoined strict Silence as to what had past on <HI>Dowling,</HI> conducted that Gentleman himself to the Door, least he should see <HI>Blifil,</HI> who was return∣ed to his Chamber, where he exulted in the Thoughts of his last Deceit on his Uncle, and little suspected what had since passed below Stairs.</P>
<P>As <HI>Allworthy</HI> was returning to his Room, he met Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> in the Entry, who with a Face all pale and full of Terror, said to him, <Q REND="inline">'O! Sir, I find this wicked Woman hath been with you, and you know all; yet do not on this Account abandon the poor young Man. Consider, Sir, he was ignorant it was his own Mother, and the Discovery itself will most probably break his Heart, without your Unkindness.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Madam, says <HI>Allworthy,</HI> I am un∣der such an Astonishment at what I have heard, that I am really unable to satisfy you; but come with me into my Room. Indeed, Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> I have made surprising Discoveries, and you shall soon know them.'</Q></P>

The poor Woman followed him trembling; and now <HI>Allworthy</HI> going up to Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> took her by the Hand, and then turning to Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> said, <Q REND="inline">'What Reward shall I bestow upon this poor Gen∣tlewoman for the Services she hath done me?—O! Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> you have a Thousand Times heard me call the young Man to whom you are so faithful a Friend, my Son. Little did I then think he was indeed related to me at all.—Your Friend, Madam, is my Nephew, he is the Brother of that wicked Viper which I so long nourished in my Bosom.—She will herself tell you the whole Story, and how the Youth came to pass for her Son. Indeed, Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> I am convinced that he hath been wronged, and that I have been abused, abused by one whom you too justly suspect∣ed of being a Villain. He is, in Truth, the worst of Villains.'</Q></P>
<P>The Joy which Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> now felt, bereft her of the Power of Speech, and might perhaps have deprived her of her Senses, if not of Life, had not a friendly Shower of Tears come seasonably to her Re∣lief. At length recovering so far from her Transport as to be able to speak, she cry'd, <Q REND="inline">'And is my dear Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> then your Nephew, Sir? and not the Son of this Lady? and are your Eyes opened to him at last? and shall I live to see him as happy as he deserves?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'He certainly is my Nephew, says <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and I hope all the rest.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'And is this the dear, good Woman, the Person, cries she, to whom all this Discovery is owing!'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'She is indeed, says <HI>Allworthy."</HI></Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Why then, cry'd Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> upon her Knees, may Heaven shower down its choicest Blessings upon her Head, and for this one good Action, forgive her all her Sins be they never so many.'</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> then informed them, that she believ∣ed <HI>Jones</HI> would very shortly be released; for that the

Surgeon was gone, in Company with a Nobleman, to the Justice who committed him, in order to certify that Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> was out of all Manner of Dan∣ger, and to procure the Prisoner his Liberty.</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> said, he should be glad to find his Ne∣phew there at his Return home; but that he was then obliged to go on some Business of Consequence. He than called to a Servant to fetch him a Chair, and presently left the two Ladies together.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> hearing the Chair ordered, came down Stairs to attend upon his Uncle, for he never was deficient in such Acts of Duty. He asked his Un∣cle if he was going out, which is a civil Way of asking a Man where he is going; to which the other making no Answer, he again desired to know when he would be pleased to return.<HI>—Allworthy</HI> made no Answer to this neither, till he was just getting in∣to his Chair, and then turning about he said—<Q REND="inline">'Harkee, Sir, do you find out, before my Return, the Letter which your Mother sent me on her Death-bed.'</Q> <HI>Allworthy</HI> then departed, and left <HI>Blifil</HI> in a Situation to be envied only by a Man who is just go∣ing to be hanged.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>A further Continuation.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>ALlworthy</HI> took an Opportunity whilst he was in the Chair of reading the Letter from <HI>Jones</HI> to <HI>Sophia,</HI> which <HI>Western</HI> delivered him; and there were some Expressions in it concerning himself, which drew Tears from his Eyes. At length he arrived at Mr. <HI>Western'</HI>s, and was introduced to <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>When the first Ceremonies were past, and the Gen∣tleman and Lady had taken their Chairs, a Silence of some Minutes ensued; during which, the latter, who had been prepared for the Visit by her Father, sat playing with her Fan, and had every Mark of Confusion both in her Countenance and Behaviour. At length <HI>All∣worthy,</HI> who was himself a little disconcerted, began
<PB N="327" REF="332"/>
thus; <Q REND="inline">'I am afraid, Miss <HI>Western,</HI> my Family hath been the Occasion of giving you some Uneasiness; to which, I fear, I have innocently become more instrumental than I intended. Be assured, Madam, had I at first known how disagreeable the Proposals had been, I should not have suffered you to have been so long persecuted. I hope therefore you will not think the Design of this Visit is to trouble you with any further Sollicitations of that Kind, but entirely to relieve you from them.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Sir, said <HI>Sophia,</HI> with a little modest Hesitation, this Behaviour is most kind and generous, and such as I could expect only from Mr. <HI>Allworthy:</HI> But as you have been so kind to mention this Matter, you will pardon me for saying, it hath indeed given me great Uneasiness, and hath been the Occasion of my suf∣fering much cruel Treatment from a Father, who was, 'till that unhappy Affair, the tenderest and fondest of all Parents. I am convinced, Sir, you are too good and generous to resent my Refusal of your Nephew. Our own Inclinations are not in our Power; and whatever may be his Merit, I can∣not force them in his Favour.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I assure you, most amiable young Lady.' said <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'I am capable of no such Resentment, had the Person been my own Son, and had I entertained the high∣est Esteem for him. For you say truly, Madam, we cannot force our own Inclinations, much less can they be directed by another.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Oh! Sir,' an∣swered <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'every Word you speak proves you to deserve that good, that great, that Benevolent Cha∣racter the whole World allows you. I assure you, Sir, nothing less than the certain Prospect of future Misery could have made me resist the Commands of my Father.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I sincerely believe you Madam,' replied <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'and I heartily congratulate you on your prudent Foresight, since by so justifiable a
<PB N="328" REF="333"/>
Resistance you have avoided Misery indeed.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'You speak now, Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> cries she, 'with a De∣licacy which few Men are capable of feeling: but surely in my Opinion, to lead our Lives with one to whom we are indifferent, must be a State of Wretchedness—perhaps that Wretchedness would be even increased by a Sense of the Merits of an Object to whom we cannot give our Affections. If I had married Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI>—'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Pardon my interrupting you, Madam, answered <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'but I cannot bear the Supposition.—Believe me, Miss <HI>Western,</HI> I rejoice from my Heart, I rejoice in your Escape.—I have discovered the Wretch, for whom you have suffered all this cruel Violence from your Father, to be a Villain.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'How, Sir!' cries <HI>Sophia,—'</HI>you must believe this surprises me.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'It hath surprised me, Madam,' answered <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and so it will the World.—But I have acquainted you with the real Truth.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Nothing but Truth,' says <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'can, I am convinced, come from the Lips of Mr. <HI>Allworthy.—</HI>Yet, Sir, such sudden, such unexpected News—Discovered, you say—may Villainy be ever so.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'You will soon enough hear the Story,' cries <HI>Allworthy,—'</HI>at present let us not mention so detested a Name—I have another Matter of a very serious Nature to propose.—O! Miss <HI>Western,</HI> I know your vast Worth, nor can I so easily part with the Ambition of being allied to it.—I have a near Relation, Madam, a young Man whose Character is, I am con∣vinced, the very opposite to that of this Wretch, and whose Fortune I will make equal to what his was to have been.—Could I, Madam, hope you would admit a Visit from him?'</Q> <HI>Sophia</HI> after a Minute's Silence, answered, <Q REND="inline">'I will deal with the ut∣most Sincerity with Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI> His Charac∣ter, and the Obligation I have just received from

him demand it. I have determined at present to listen to no such Proposals from any Person. My only desire is to be restor'd to the Affection of my Father, and to be again the Mistress of his Family. This, Sir, I hope to owe to your good Offices. Let me beseech you, let me conjure you by all the Goodness, which I, and all who know you, have experienced; do not the very Moment when you have released me from one Persecution, do not en∣gage me in another, as miserable and as fruitless.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Miss <HI>Western,'</HI> replied <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'I am capable of no such Conduct; and if this be your Re∣solution, he must submit to the Disappointment, whatever Torments he may suffer under it.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I must smile now, Mr. <HI>Allworthy,'</HI> answered <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'when you mention the Torments of a Man whom I do not know, and who can consequently have so little Acquaintance with me.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Pardon me, dear young Lady,' cries <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'I begin now to be afraid he hath had too much Acquaintance for the Repose of his future Days; since, if ever Man was capable of a sincere, violent and noble Passion, such, I am convinced, is my unhappy Nephew's for Miss <HI>Western.'</HI> 'A Nephew of yours! Mr. <HI>Allworthy,'</HI> answered <HI>Sophia.</HI> 'It is surely strange, I never heard of him before.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed! Madam,' cries <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'it is only the Circumstance of his being my Nephew to which you are a Stranger, and which, 'till this Day, was a Secret to me.—Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> who has long loved you, he! he is my Nephew.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> your Nephew, Sir?' cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'Can it be possible?</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'He is in∣deed, Madam, answered <HI>Allworthy:</HI> He is my own Sister's Son—as such I shall always own him; nor am I ashamed of owning him. I am much more ashamed of my past Behaviour to him; but I was as ignorant of his Merit as of his Birth. In∣deed, Miss <HI>Western,</HI> I have used him cruelly—

Indeed I have.'</Q>—Here the good Man wiped his Eyes, and after a short Pause proceeded—<Q REND="inline">'I never shall be able to reward him for his Sufferings without your Assistance.—Believe me, most amiable young Lady, I must have a great Esteem of that Offering which I make to your Worth. I know he hath been guilty of Faults; but there is great Goodness of Heart at the Bottom. Believe me, Madam, there is.'</Q>—Here he stopped, seeming to expect an Answer, which he presently received from <HI>Sophia,</HI> after she had a little recover∣ed herself from the Hurry of Spirits into which so strange and sudden Information had thrown her: <Q REND="inline">'I sincerely wish you Joy, Sir, of a Discovery in which you seem to have such Satisfaction. I Doubt not but you will have all the Comfort you can pro∣mise yourself from it. The young Gentleman hath certainly a thousand good Qualities, which makes it impossible he should not behave well to such an Uncle.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'I hope, Madam,' said <HI>Allworthy,</HI> he hath those good Qualities which must make him a good Husband.—He must I am sure, be of all Men the most abandoned, if a Lady of your Merit should condescend'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'You must pardon me, Mr. <HI>Allworthy,'</HI> answered <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'I cannot listen to a Proposal of this Kind.

The same Villainy may have injured him every where.—He is no Murderer, I assure you, as he hath

been called.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> answered <HI>Sophia,</HI> I have told you my Resolution. I wonder not at what my Father hath told you; but whatever his Apprehensions or Fears have been, if I know my Heart, I have given no Occasion for them; since it hath always been a fixed Principle with me, ne∣ver to have marry'd without his Consent. This is, I think, the Duty of a Child to a Parent; and this, I hope, nothing could ever have prevailed with me to swerve from. I do not indeed conceive, that the Authority of any Parent can oblige us to marry, in direct Opposition to our Inclinations. To avoid a Force of this Kind, which I had Rea∣son to suspect, I left my Father's House, and sought Protection elsewhere. This is the Truth of my Sto∣ry; and if the World, or my Father, carry my In∣tentions any farther, my own Conscience will ac∣quit me.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I hear you, Miss <HI>Western,'</HI> cries <HI>All∣worthy</HI> with Admiration. 'I admire the Justness of your Sentiments; but surely there is more in this. I am cautious of offending you, young Lady; but am I to look on all which I have hitherto heard or seen, as a Dream only? And have you suffered so much Cruelty from your Father on the Account of a Man to whom you have been always absolute∣ly indifferent?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I beg, Mr. <HI>Allworthy,'</HI> answered <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'you will not insist on my Reasons;—Yes I have suffered indeed: I will not, Mr. <HI>All∣worthy,</HI> conceal—I will be very sincere with you—I own I had a great Opinion of Mr. <HI>Jones—</HI>I believe—I know I have suffered for my Opinion—I have been treated cruelly by my Aunt, as well as by my Father; but that is now past—I beg I may not be farther press'd; for whatever hath been, my Resolution is now fix∣ed. Your Nephew, Sir, hath many Virtues—he hath great Virtues, Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI> I question not but he will do you Honour in the World, and
<PB N="332" REF="337"/>
make you happy.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'I wish I could make him so, Madam,' replied <HI>Allworthy;</HI> 'but that I am convinced is only in your Power. It is that Con∣viction which hath made me so earnest a Sollici∣tor in his Favour.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'You are deceived; indeed, Sir, you are deceived,' said <HI>Sophia—'</HI>I hope not by him—It is sufficient to have deceived me. Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> I must insist on being prest no farther upon this Subject.—I should be sorry—Nay, I will not injure him in your Favour. I wish Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> very well. I sincerely wish him well; and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>peat again to you, whatever Demerit he may have to me, I am certain he hath many good Qualities. I do not disown my former Thoughts; but nothing can ever recal them. At present there is not a Man on Earth whom I would more reso∣lutely reject than Mr. <HI>Jones;</HI> nor would the Ad∣dresses of Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> himself be less agreeable to me.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Western</HI> had been long impatient for the Event of this Conference, and was just now arrived at the Door to listen; when having heard the last Sentiments of his Daughter's Heart, he lost all Temper, and burst∣ing open the Door in a Rage, cried out,—<Q REND="inline">'It is a Lie. It is a d—n'd Lie. It is all owing to that d—n'd Rascal <HI>Juones;</HI> and if she could get at un, she'd ha un any Hour of the Day.'</Q> Here <HI>Allwor∣thy</HI> interposed, and addressing himself to the Squire with some Anger in his Look, he said, <Q REND="inline">'Mr. <HI>Western,</HI> you have not kept your Word with me. You pro∣mised to abstain from all Violence.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Why so I did,' cries <HI>Western,</HI> 'as long as it was possible; but to hear a Wench telling such confounded Lies.—Zounds! Doth she think if she can make Vools of other Volk, she can make one of me?—No, no, I know her better than thee dost.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I am sorry to tell you, Sir,' answered <HI>Allworthy,</HI> it doth not appear by your Behaviour to this young

Lady, that you know her at all. I ask Pardon for what I say; but I think our Intimacy, your own Desires, and the Occasion justify me. She is your Daughter, Mr. <HI>Western,</HI> and I think she doth Ho∣nour to your Name. If I was capable of Envy, I should sooner envy you on this Account, than any other Man whatever.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Od-rabbit-it,' cries the Squire, 'I wish she was thine with all my Heart—wouldst soon be glad to be rid of the Trouble o' her.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, my good Friend,' answered <HI>All∣worthy,</HI> 'you yourself are the Cause of all the Trou∣ble you complain of. Place that Confidence in the young Lady which she so well deserves, and I am certain you will be the happiest Father on Earth.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'I Confidence in her!' cries the Squire.</Q> <Q REND="inline">''Sblood!' what Confidence can I place in her, when she won't do as I wou'd ha her? Let her gi but her Consent to marry as I would ha her, and I'll place as much Confidence in her as wouldst ha me.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'You have no Right, Neighbour,' an∣swered <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'to insist on any such Consent. A negative Voice your Daughter allows you, and God and Nature have thought proper to allow you no more.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'A negative Voice?' cries the Squire,—Ay! ay! I'll shew you what a negative Voice I ha.—Go along, go into your Chamber, go, you Stubborn</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Mr. <HI>Western,'</HI> said <HI>All∣worthy,—</HI>'Indeed, you use her cruelly—I can∣not bear to see this—You shall, you must be∣have to her in a kinder Manner. She deserves the best of Treatment.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Yes, yes,' said the Squire, I know what she deserves: Now she's gone, I'll shew you what she deserves—See here, Sir, here is a Letter from my Cousin, my Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> in which she is so kind to gi me to understand, that the Fellow is got out of Prison again; and here she advises me to take all the Care I can o' the Wench.
<PB N="334" REF="339"/>
Odzookers! Neighbour <HI>Allworthy,</HI> you don't know what it is to govern a Daughter.'</Q></P>
<P>The Squire ended his Speech with some Compli∣ments to his own Sagacity; and then <HI>Allworthy,</HI> af∣ter a formal Preface, acquainted him with the whole Discovery which he had made concerning <HI>Jones,</HI> with his Anger to <HI>Blifil,</HI> and with every Particular which hath been disclosed to the Reader in the preceding Chapters.</P>
<P>Men over-violent in their Dispositions, are, for the most Part, as changeable in them. No sooner then was <HI>Western</HI> informed of Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Intention to make <HI>Jones</HI> his Heir, than he joined heartily with the Uncle in every Commendation of the Nephew, and became as eager for her Marriage with <HI>Jones,</HI> as he had before been to couple her to <HI>Blifil.</HI></P>
<P>Here Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> was again forced to interpose, and to relate what had passed between him and <HI>So∣phia,</HI> at which he testified great Surprize.</P>
<P>The Squire was silent a Moment, and looked wild with Astonishment at this Account—At last he cried out, <Q REND="inline">'Why what can be the Meaning of this, Neighbour <HI>Allworthy?</HI> Vond o un she was, that I'll be sworn to.—Odzookers! I have hit o't. As sure as a Gun I have hit o the very right o't. It's all long o Zister. The Girl hath got a Hanker∣ing after this Son of a whore of a Lord. I vound 'em together at my Cousin, my Lady <HI>Bellaston'</HI>s. He hath turned the Head o' her that's certain—but d—n me if he shall ha her—I'll ha no Lords nor Courtiers in my Vamily.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> now made a long Speech, in which he repeated his Resolution to avoid all violent Measures, and very earnestly recommended gentle Methods to Mr. <HI>Western,</HI> as those by which he might be assured of succeeding best with his Daughter. He then took his Leave, and returned back to Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> but
<PB N="335" REF="340"/>
was forced to comply with the earnest Entreaties of the Squire, in promising to bring Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> to visit him that Afternoon, <Q REND="inline">'that he might,' as he said, 'make all Matters up with the young Gentleman.'</Q> At Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Departure, <HI>Western</HI> promised to follow his Advice in his Behaviour to <HI>Sophia,</HI> saying, <Q REND="inline">'I don't know how 'tis, but d—n me, <HI>Allwor∣thy,</HI> if you don't make me always do just as you please, and yet I have as good an Esteate as you, and am in the Commission of the Peace as well as yourself.'</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>Wherein the History begins to draw towards a Con∣clusion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN <HI>Allworthy</HI> returned to his Lodgings, he heard Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was just arrived before him. He hurried therefore instantly into an empty Cham∣ber, whither he ordered Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> to be brought to him alone.</P>
<P>It is impossible to conceive a more tender or mov∣ing Scene, than the Meeting between the Uncle and Nephew, (for Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> as the Reader may well suppose, had at her last Visit discovered to him the Secret of his Birth). The first Agonies of Joy which were felt on both Sides, are indeed beyond my Pow∣er to describe: I shall not therefore attempt it. Af∣ter <HI>Allworthy</HI> had raised <HI>Jones</HI> from his Feet, where he had prostrated himself, and received him into his Arms, <Q REND="inline">'O my Child,' he cried, 'how have I been to blame! How have I injured you! What Amends can I ever make you for those unkind, those un∣just Suspicions which I have entertained; and for all the Sufferings they have occasioned to you?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Am I not made Amends?' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'Would not my Sufferings, if they had been ten Times
<PB N="336" REF="341"/>
greater, have been now richly repaid? O my dear Uncle! this Goodness, this Tenderness over-powers, unmans, destroys me. I cannot bear the Transports which slow so fast upon me. To be again restored to your Presence, to your Fa∣vour; to be once more thus kindly received by my great, my noble, my generous Benefactor,</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Child,' cries <HI>Allworthy,'</HI> I have used you cruelly.'</Q>—He then explained to him all the Treachery of <HI>Blifil,</HI> and again repeated Expressions of the utmost Concern, for having been induced by that Treachery to use him so ill. <Q REND="inline">'O talk not so,' answer∣ed <HI>Jones;'</HI> 'Indeed Sir, you have used me nobly. The wisest Man might be deceived as you were, and, under such a Deception, the best must have acted just as you did. Your Goodness displayed it∣self in the Midst of your Anger, just as it then seem∣ed. I owe every thing to that Goodness of which I have been most unworthy. Do not put me on Self-accusation, by carrying your generous Sentiments too far. Alas, Sir, I have not been punished more than I have deserved; and it shall be the whole Bu∣siness of my furture Life to deserve that Happiness you now bestow on me; for believe me, my dear Uncle, my Punishment hath not been thrown away upon me. Though I have been a great, I am not a hardened Sinner; I thank Heaven I have had Time to reflect on my past Life, where though I cannot charge myself with any gross Villainy, yet I can dis∣cern Follies and Vices too sufficient to repent and to be ashamed of; Follies which have been attended with dreadful Consequences to myself, and have brought me to the Brink of Destruction.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I am rejoiced, my dear Child,' answered <HI>Allworthy,</HI> to hear you talk thus sensibly; for as I am convinc∣ed Hypocrisy (good Heaven how have I been imposed on by it in others!) was never among your Faults,
<PB N="337" REF="342"/>
so I can readily believe all you say. You now see, <HI>Tom,</HI> to what Dangers Imprudence alone may sub∣ject Virtue (for Virtue, I am now convinced, you love in a great Degree). Prudence is indeed the Duty which we owe to ourselves; and if we will be so much our own Enemies as to neglect it, we are not to wonder if the World is deficient in discharg∣ing their Duty to us; for when a Man lays the Foundation of his own Ruin, others will, I am a∣fraid, be too apt to build upon it. You say, how∣ever you have seen your Errors; and will reform them. I firmly believe you, my dear Child; and therefore, from this Moment, you shall never more be reminded of them by me. Remember them on∣ly yourself so far, as for the future to teach you the better to avoid them; but still remember, for your Comfort, that there is this great Difference between those Faults which Candour may construe into Im∣prudence, and those which can be deduced from Vil∣lainy only. The former, perhaps, are even more liable to subject a Man to Ruin; but if he reform, his Character will, at length, be totally retrieved; the World, though not immediately, will, in Time, be reconciled to him; and he may reflect, not with∣out some Mixture of Pleasure, on the Dangers he hath escaped: But Villainy, my Boy, when once discovered, is irretrievable; the Stains which this leaves behind, no Time will wash away. The Cen∣sure of Mankind will pursue the Wretch, their Scorn will abash him in Public, and if Shame drives him into Retirement, he will go to it with all those Terrors with which a weary Child, who is afraid of Hobgoblins, retreats from Company to go to Bed alone. Here his murdered Conscience will haunt him. Repose, like a false Friend, will fly from him. Where-ever he turns his Eyes, Horror presents it∣self; if he looks backward, unavailable Repentance
<PB N="338" REF="343"/>
treads on his Heels; if forward, incurable Despair stares him in the Face; till, like a condemned Pri∣soner, confined in a Dungeon, he detests his present Condition, and yet dreads the Consequence of that Hour which is to relieve him from it. Comfort yourself, I say, my Child, that this is not your Case; and rejoice, with Thankfulness to him who hath suffered you to see your Errors, before they have brought on you that Destruction to which a Persi∣stance in even those Errors must have led you. You have deserted them, and the Prospect now before you is such, that Happiness seems in your own Pow∣er.'</Q>—At these Words <HI>Jones</HI> fetched a deep Sigh; upon which, when <HI>Allworthy</HI> remonstrated, he said, <Q REND="inline">'Sir, I will conceal nothing from you: I fear there is one Consequence of my Vices I shall never be able to retrieve. O my dear Uncle, I have lost a Treasure.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'You need say no more,' answer∣ed <HI>Allworthy;</HI> 'I will be explicit with you; I know what you lament; I have seen the young Lady, and have discoursed with her concerning you. This I must insist on, as an Earnest of your Sincerity in all you have said, and of the Stedfastness of your Reso∣lution, that you obey me in one Instance. To a∣bide intirely by the Determination of the young La∣dy, whether it shall be in your Favour, or no. She hath already suffered enough from Sollicitations which I hate to think of; she shall owe no further Constraint to my Family: I know her Father will be as ready to torment her now on your Account, as he hath formerly been on another; but I am de∣termined she shall suffer no more Confinement, no more Violence, no more uneasy Hours.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'O my dear Uncle', answered <HI>Jones,</HI> 'lay, I beseech you, some Command on me, in which I shall have some Merit in Obedience. Believe me, Sir, the only In∣stance in which I could disobey you, would be to
<PB N="339" REF="344"/>
give an uneasy Moment to my <HI>Sophia.</HI> No, Sir, if I am so miserable to have incurred her Displeasure beyond all Hope of Forgiveness, that alone, with the dreadful Reflection of causing her Misery, will be sufficient to overpower me. To call <HI>Sophia</HI> mine is the greatest, and now the only additional Blessing which Heaven can bestow; but it is a Blessing which I must owe to her alone.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I will not flatter you, Child,' cries <HI>Allworthy;</HI> I fear your Case is desperate: I never saw stronger Marks of an unalterable Resolution in any Person, than appeared in her vehement Declarations against receiving your Addresses; for which, perhaps, you can account bet∣ter than myself.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Oh, Sir! I can account too well,' answered <HI>Jones;</HI> 'I have sinned against her beyond all Hope of Pardon; and, guilty as I am, my Guilt unfortunately appears to her in ten Times blacker than the real Colours. O my dear Uncle, I find my Follies are irretrievable; and all your Goodness cannot save me from Perdition.'</Q></P>
<P>A Servant now acquainted them, that Mr. <HI>Western</HI> was below Stairs; for his Eagerness to see <HI>Jones</HI> could not wait till the Afternoon. Upon which <HI>Jones,</HI> whose Eyes were full of Tears, begged his Uncle to entertain <HI>Western</HI> a few Minutes, till he a little reco∣vered himself: To which the good Man consented, and having ordered Mr. <HI>Western</HI> to be shewn into a Parlour, went down to him.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> no sooner heard, that <HI>Jones</HI> was alone (for she had not yet seen him since his Release from Prison,) than she came eagerly into the Room, and, advancing towards <HI>Jones,</HI> wished him heartily Joy of his new-found Uncle, and his happy Reconciliation; adding, <Q REND="inline">'I wish I could give you Joy on another Ac∣count, my dear Child; but any thing so inexorable I never saw.'</Q> <HI>Jones,</HI> with some Appearance of Sur∣prize, asked her, what she meant. <Q REND="inline">'Why then,' says she, 'I have been with your young Lady, and
<PB N="340" REF="345"/>
have explained all Matters to her, as they were told me by my Son <HI>Nightingale.</HI> She can have no longer any Doubt about the Letter, that I am certain; for I told her my Son <HI>Nightingale</HI> was rea∣dy to take his Oath, if she pleased, that it was all his own Invention, and the Letter of his inditing. I told her the very Reason of sending the Letter ought to recommend you to her the more, as it was all upon her Account, and a plain Proof, that you was resolved to quit all your Profligacy for the fu∣ture; that you had never been guilty of a single In∣stance of Infidelity to her since your seeing her in Town. I am afraid I went too far there; but Hea∣ven forgive me: I hope your future Behaviour will be my Justification. I am sure I have said all I can; but all to no Purpose. She remains inflexible. She says, she had forgiven many Faults on account of Youth; but expressed such Detestation of the Cha∣racter of a Libertine, that she absolutely silenced me. I often attempted to excuse you; but the Justness of her Accusation flew in my Face. Up∣on my Honour she is a lovely Woman, and one of the sweetest and most sensible Creatures I ever saw. I could have almost kissed her for one Expression she made use of. It was a Sentiment worthy of <HI>Se∣neca,</HI> or of a Bishop.' "I once fancied, Ma∣dam,' said she, "I had discovered great Good∣ness of Heart in Mr. <HI>Jones;</HI> and for that I own I had a sincere Esteem; but an entire Profligacy of Manners will corrupt the best Heart in the World; and all which a good-natured Libertine can expect is, that we should mix some Grains of Pity with our Contempt and Abhorrence."</Q> <Q REND="inline">'She is an an∣gelic Creature, that is the Truth on't.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'O Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> answered <HI>Jones,</HI> can I bear to think I have lost such an Angel.</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Lost! No,' cries Mrs. <HI>Miller;'</HI> 'I hope you have not lost her yet. Resolve to leave such vicious Courses, and you may yet have
<PB N="341" REF="346"/>
Hopes: Nay, if she should remain inexorable, there is another young Lady, a sweet pretty young Lady, and a swinging Fortune, who is absolutely dying for Love of you. I heard of it this very Morning, and I told it to Miss <HI>Western;</HI> nay, I went a little beyond the Truth again; for I told her you had refused her; but indeed I knew you would refuse her.—And here I must give you a little Comfort: When I mentioned the young La∣dy's Name, who is no other than the pretty Wi∣dow <HI>Hunt,</HI> I thought she turned pale; but when I said you had refused her, I will be sworn her Face was all over Scarlet in an Instant; and these were her very Words,' "I will not deny but that I be∣lieve he has some Affection for me.'</Q></P>
<P>Here the Conversation was interrupted by the Arri∣val of <HI>Western,</HI> who could no longer be kept out of the Room even by the Authority of <HI>Allworthy,</HI> him∣self; though this, as we have often seen, had a won∣derful Power over him.</P>
<P><HI>Western</HI> immediately went up to <HI>Jones,</HI> crying out, <Q REND="inline">'My old Friend <HI>Tom,</HI> I am glad to see thee with all my Heart. All past must be forgotten. I could not intend any Affront to thee, because, as <HI>Allwor∣thy</HI> here knows, nay, dost know it thyself, I took thee for another Person; and where a Body means no Harm, what signifies a hasty Word or two; one Christian must forget and forgive another.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I hope, Sir, said <HI>Jones,</HI> 'I shall never forget the many Ob∣ligations I have had to you; but as for any Offence towards me, I declare I am an utter Stranger.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'A't,' says <HI>Western,'</HI> then give me thy Fist, a't as hearty an honest Cock as any in the Kingdom. Come along with me; I'll carry thee to thy Mis∣tress this Moment.'</Q> Here <HI>Allworthy</HI> interposed; and the Squire being unable to prevail either with the Uncle or Nephew, was, after some Litigation, oblig∣ed to consent to delay introducing <HI>Jones</HI> to <HI>Sophia</HI> till
<PB N="342" REF="347"/>
the Afternoon; at which Time <HI>Allworthy,</HI> as well in Compassion to <HI>Jones,</HI> as in Compliance with the eager Desires of <HI>Western,</HI> was prevailed upon to pro∣mise to attend at the Tea-table.</P>
<P>The Conversation which now ensued was pleasant enough; and with which, had it happened earlier in our History, we would have entertained our Reader; but as we have now Leisure only to attend to what is very material, it shall suffice to say, that Mat∣ters being intirely adjusted as to the Afternoon-Visit, Mr. <HI>Western</HI> again returned home.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>This History draws nearer to a Conclusion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mr. <HI>Western</HI> was departed, <HI>Jones</HI> be∣gan to inform Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Mil∣ler,</HI> that his Liberty had been procured by two noble Lords, who, together with two Surgeons, and a Friend of Mr. <HI>Nightingale'</HI>s, had attended the Ma∣gistrate by whom he had been committed, and by whom, on the Surgeons Oaths that the wounded Per∣son was out of all Manner of Danger from this Wound, he was discharged.</P>
<P>One only of these Lords, he said, he had ever seen before, and that no more than once; but the o∣ther had greatly surprized him, by asking his Pardon for an Offence he had been guilty of towards him, occasioned, he said, entirely by his Ignorance who he was.</P>
<P>Now the Reality of the Case with which <HI>Jones</HI> was not acquainted till afterwards, was this. The Lieu∣tenant whom Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> had employed, accord∣ing to the Advice of Lady <HI>Bellaston,</HI> to press <HI>Jones,</HI> as a Vagabond, into the Sea Service, when he came to report the Event which we have before seen to his Lordship, spoke very favourably of the Behavi∣our of Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> on all Accounts, and strongly as∣sured
<PB N="343" REF="348"/>
that Lord, that he must have mistaken the Per∣son, for that <HI>Jones</HI> was certainly a Gentleman, in∣somuch that his Lordship, who was strictly a Man of Honour, and would by no Means have been guilty of an Action which the World in general would have condemned, began to be much concerned for the Ad∣vice which he had taken.</P>
<P>Within a Day or two after this, Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> happened to dine with the <HI>Irish</HI> Peer, who, in a Con∣versation upon the Duel, acquainted his Company with the Character of <HI>Fitzpatrick;</HI> to which indeed he did not do strict Justice, especially in what related to his Lady. He said, she was the most innocent, and most injured Woman alive, and that from Com∣passion alone he had undertaken her Cause. He then declared an Intention of going the next Morning to <HI>Fitzpatrick'</HI>s Lodgings, in order to prevail with him, if possibly, to consent to a Separation from his Wife, who, the Peer said, was in Apprehensions for her Life, if she should ever return to be under the Power of her Husband. Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> agreed to go with him, that he might satisfy himself more concerning <HI>Jones,</HI> and the Circumstances of the Duel; for he was by no Means easy concerning the Part he had acted. The Moment his Lordship gave a Hint of his Rea∣diness to assist in the Delivery of the Lady, it was eagerly embraced by the other Nobleman, who de∣pended much on the Authority of Lord <HI>Fellamar,</HI> as he thought it would greatly contribute to awe <HI>Fitz∣patrick</HI> into a Compliance; and perhaps he was in the right; for the poor <HI>Irishman</HI> no sooner saw these no∣ble Peers had undertaken the Cause of his Wife, than he submitted, and Articles of Separation were soon drawn up and signed between the Parties.</P>
<P><HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> had been so well satisfied by Mrs. <HI>Wa∣ters</HI> concerning the Innocence of his Wife with <HI>Jones</HI> at <HI>Upton,</HI> or perhaps from some other Reasons, was now become so indifferent to that Matter, that he
<PB N="344" REF="349"/>
spoke highly in Favour of <HI>Jones,</HI> to Lord <HI>Fellamar,</HI> took all the Blame upon himself, and said the other had behaved very much like a Gentleman, and a Man of Honour; and upon that Lord's further En∣quiry concerning Mr. <HI>Jones, Fitzpatrick</HI> told him he was Nephew to a Gentleman of very great Fashion and Fortune, which was the Account he had just re∣ceived from Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> after her Interview with <HI>Dowling.</HI></P>
<P>Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> now thought it behoved him to do every Thing in his Power to make Satisfaction to a Gentleman whom he had so grosly injured, and with∣out any Consideration of Rivalship, (for he had now given over all Thoughts of <HI>Sophia)</HI> determined to procure Mr. <HI>Jones'</HI>s Liberty, being satisfied as well from <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> as his Surgeon, that the Wound was not mortal. He therefore prevailed with the <HI>Irish</HI> Peer to accompany him to the Place where <HI>Jones</HI> was confined, to whom he behaved as we have already related.</P>
<P>When <HI>Allworthy</HI> returned to his Lodgings, he im∣mediately carried <HI>Jones</HI> into his Room, and then ac∣quainted him with the whole Matter, as well what he had heard from Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> as what he had dis∣covered from Mr. <HI>Dowling.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> expressed great Astonishment, and no less Concern at this Account; but without making any Comment or Observation upon it. And now a Mes∣sage was brought from Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> desiring to know if his Uncle was at Leisure, and he might wait upon him. <HI>Alworthy</HI> started and turned pale, and then in a more passionate Tone than, I believe, he had ever used before, bid the Servant tell <HI>Blifil,</HI> he knew him not. <Q REND="inline">'Consider, dear Sir,'</Q>—cries <HI>Jones</HI> in a trem∣bling Voice.—<Q REND="inline">'I have considered, answered <HI>All∣worthy,</HI> and you yourself shall carry my Message to the Villain.—No one can carry him the Sentence
<PB N="345" REF="350"/>
of his own Ruin so properly as the Man whose Ruin he hath so villainously contrived.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Pardon me, dear Sir, said <HI>Jones;</HI> a Moment's Reflection will, I am sure, convince you of the contrary. What might be perhaps but Justice from another Tongue, would from mine be Insult; and to whom?—My own Brother, and your Nephew.—Nor did he use me so barbarously.—Indeed that would have been more inexcuseable than any Thing he hath done. Fortune may tempt Men of no very bad Dispositi∣ons to Injustice; but Insults proceed only from black and rancorous Minds, and have no Tempta∣tions to excuse them.—Let me beseech you, Sir, to do nothing by him in the present Height of your Anger. Consider, my dear Uncle, I was not my∣self condemned unheard.'</Q> <HI>Allworthy</HI> stood silent a Moment, and then embracing <HI>Jones,</HI> he said, with Tears gushing from his Eyes, <Q REND="inline">'O my Child! to what Goodness have I been so long blind!'</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> entring the Room at that Moment, after a gentle Rap, which was not perceived, and see∣ing <HI>Jones</HI> in the Arms of his Uncle, the poor Wo∣man, in an Agony of Joy, fell upon her Knees, and burst forth into the most extatic Thanksgivings to Heaven, for what had happened. —Then run∣ing to <HI>Jones,</HI> she embraced him eagerly, crying, <Q REND="inline">'My dearest Friend, I wish you Joy a Thousand and a Thousand Times of this blest Day;'</Q> and next Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> himself received the same Congratulations. To which he answered, <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, indeed, Mrs. <HI>Mil∣ler,</HI> I am beyond Expression happy.'</Q> Some few more Raptures being passed on all Sides, Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> desired them both to walk down to Dinner in the Parlour, where she said there were a very happy Set of People assembled; being indeed no other than Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> and his Bride, and his Cousin <HI>Harris</HI> with her Bridegroom.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="351"/>
<HI>Allworthy</HI> excused himself from dining with the Company, saying he had ordered some little Thing for him and his Nephew in his own Apartment; for that they had much private Business to discourse of, but would not resist promising the good Woman, that both he and <HI>Jones</HI> would make Part of her Society at Supper.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> then asked what was to be done with <HI>Blifil;</HI> <Q REND="inline">'for indeed, says she, I cannot be easy while such a Villain is in my House.</Q>—<HI>Allworthy</HI> an∣swered, <Q REND="inline">'He was as uneasy as herself on the same Account.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'O, cries she, if that be the Case, leave the Matter to me; I'll soon shew him the Outside of my Doors, I warrant you. Here are two or three lusty Fellows below Stairs.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'There will be no need of any Violence, cries <HI>Allworthy,</HI> if you will carry him a Message from me, he will, I am convinced, depart of his own Accord.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Will I? said Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> I never did any Thing in my Life with a better Will.'</Q> Here <HI>Jones</HI> interfered, and said, <Q REND="inline">'He had considered the Matter better, and would, if Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> pleased, be himself the Messenger.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I know, says he, already enough of your Pleasure, Sir, and I beg Leave to acquaint him with it by my own Words. Let me beseech you, Sir, added he, to reflect on the dreadful Conse∣quences of driving him to violent and sudden De∣spair. How unfit, alas! is this poor Man to die in his present Situation.'</Q> This Suggestion had not the least Effect on Mrs. <HI>Miller.</HI> She left the Room cry∣ing, <Q REND="inline">'You are too good, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> infinitely too good to live in this World.'</Q> But it made a deeper Impression on <HI>Allworthy.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'My good Child, said he, I am equally astonished at the Goodness of your Heart, and the Quickness of your Understanding. Heaven indeed forbid that this Wretch should be deprived of any Means or Time for Repentance.
<PB N="347" REF="352"/>
That would be a shocking Consideration indeed. Go to him therefore, and use your own Discretion; yet do not flatter him with any Hopes of my Forgiveness; for I shall never forgive Villainy farther than my Religion obliges me, and that extends not either to our Bounty or our Conversation.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> went up to <HI>Blifil'</HI>s Room, whom he found in a Situation which moved his Pity, though it would have raised a less amiable Passion in many Beholders. He had cast himself on his Bed, where he lay aban∣doning himself to Despair, and drowned in Tears; not in such Tears as flow from Contrition, and wash away Guilt from Minds which have been seduced or surprized into it unawares, against the Bent of their natural Dispositions, as will sometimes happen from human Frailty, even to the Good: No, these Tears were such as the frighted Thief sheds in his Cart, and are indeed the Effects of that Concern which the most savage Natures are seldom deficient in feeling for themselves.</P>
<P>It would be unpleasant and tedious to paint this Scene in full Length. Let it suffice to say, that the Behaviour of <HI>Jones</HI> was kind to Excess. He omitted nothing which his Invention could supply, to raise and comfort the drooping Spirits of <HI>Blifil,</HI> before he communicated to him the Resolution of his Uncle, that he must quit the House that Evening. He offer∣ed to furnish him with any Money he wanted, assur∣ed him of his hearty Forgiveness of all he had done against him, that he would endeavour to live with him hereafter as a Brother, and would leave nothing un∣attempted to effectuate a Reconciliation with his Un∣cle.</P>
<P><HI>Blifil</HI> was at first sullen and silent, balancing in his Mind whether he should yet deny all: But finding at last the Evidence too strong against him, he betook himself at last to confession. He then asked Pardon of his Brother in the most vehement Manner, pro∣strated
<PB N="348" REF="353"/>
himself on the Ground, and kissed his Feet: In short, he was now as remarkably mean, as he had been before remarkably wicked.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> could not so far check his Disdain, but that it a little discovered itself in his Countenance at this extreme Servility. He raised his Brother the Moment he could from the Ground, and advised him to bear his Afflictions more like a Man; repeating, at the same Time, his Promises, that he would do all in his Power to lessen them: For which <HI>Blifil</HI> making many Professions of his Unworthiness, poured forth a Pro∣fusion of Thanks: And then he having declared he would immediately depart to another Lodging, <HI>Jones</HI> returned to his Uncle.</P>
<P>Among other Matters, <HI>Allworthy</HI> now acquainted <HI>Jones</HI> with the Discovery which he made concerning the 500 <HI>l.</HI> Bank-Notes. <Q REND="inline">'▪I have,' said he, 'already consulted a Lawyer, who tells me, to my great Asto∣nishment, that there is no Punishment for a Fraud of this Kind. Indeed, when I consider the black Ingratitude of this Fellow toward you, I think a Highwayman, compared to him, is an innocent Person.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Good Heaven!' says <HI>Jones,</HI> 'is it possible?—I am shocked beyond Measure at this News. I thought there was not an honester Fellow in the World.—The Temptation of such a Sum was too great for him to withstand; for smaller Matters have come safe to me through his Hand. Indeed, my dear Uncle, you must suffer me to call it Weak∣ness rather than Ingratitude; for I am convinced the poor Fellow loves me, and hath done me some Kindness, which I can never forget; nay, I believe he hath repented of this very Act: For it is not above a Day or two ago, when my Affairs seemed in the most desperate Situation, that he visited me in my Confinement, and offered me any Money I wanted.
<PB N="349" REF="354"/>
Consider, Sir, what a Temptation to a Man who had tasted such bitter Distress, it must be to have a Sum in his Possession, which must put him and his Family beyond any future Possibility of suffering the like.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Child,' cries <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'you carry this forgiv∣ing Temper too far. Such mistaken Mercy is not only weakness, but borders on Injustice, and is ve∣ry pernicious to Society, as it encourages Vice. The Dishonesty of this Fellow I might perhaps have pardoned, but never his Ingratitude. And give me Leave to say, when we suffer any Temptation to atone for Dishonesty itself, we are as candid and merciful as we ought to be; and so far I confess I have gone: for I have often pitied the Fate of a Highwayman, when I have been on the Grand Jury; and have more than once applied to the Judge on the Behalf of such as have had any mitigating Cir∣cumstances in their Case; but when Dishonesty is attended with any blacker Crime, such as Cruelty, Murder, Ingratitude, or the like, Compassion and Forgiveness then become Faults. I am convinced the Fellow is a Villain, and he shall be punished; at least as far as I can punish him.'</Q></P>
<P>This was spoke with so stern a Voice, that <HI>Jones</HI> did not think proper to make any Reply: Besides, the Hour appointed by Mr. <HI>Western</HI> now drew so near that he had barely Time left do dress himself. Here therefore ended the present Dialogue, and <HI>Jones</HI> re∣tired to another Room, where <HI>Partridge</HI> attended, according to order, with his Cloaths.</P>
<P><HI>Partridge</HI> had scarce seen his Master since the hap∣py Discovery. The poor Fellow was unable either to contain or express his Transports. He behaved like one frantic, and made almost as many Mistakes while he was dressing <HI>Jones,</HI> as I have seen made by Harlequin in dressing himself on the Stage.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="355"/>
His Memory, however, was not in the least defi∣cient. He recollected now many Omens and Presages of this happy Event, some of which he had remarked at the Time, but many more he now remembered; nor did he omit the Dreams he had dreamt the Even∣ing before his meeting with <HI>Jones;</HI> and concluded with saying, <Q REND="inline">'I always told your Honour something boded in my Mind, that you would one Time or other have it in your Power to make my Fortune.'</Q> <HI>Jones</HI> as∣sured him, that this Boding should as certainly be verified with regard to him, as all the other Omens had been to himself; which did not a little add to all the Raptures which the poor Fellow had already con∣ceived on account of his Master.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. <HI>Approaching still nearer to the End.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>JONES</HI> being now completely dressed, attended his Uncle to Mr. <HI>Western'</HI>s. He was indeed one of the finest Figures ever beheld, and his Person alone would have charmed the greater Part of Womankind; but we hope it hath already appeared in this History, that Nature, when she formed him, did not totally rely, as she sometimes doth, on this Merit only, to recommend her Work.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia,</HI> who, angry as she was, was likewise set forth to the best Advantage, for which I leave my female Reader to account, appeared so extremely beautiful, that even <HI>Allworthy,</HI> when he saw her, could not for∣bear whispering <HI>Western,</HI> that he believed she was the finest Creature in the World. To which <HI>Western</HI> answered, in a Whisper overheard by all present, <Q REND="inline">'So much the better for <HI>Tom;—</HI>for d—n me if he shan't ha the tousling her.'</Q> <HI>Sophia</HI> was all o∣ver Scarlet at these Words, while <HI>Tom'</HI>s Counte∣nance was altogether as pale, and he was almost ready to sink from his Chair.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="356"/>
The Tea-table was scarce removed, before <HI>Wes∣tern</HI> lugged <HI>Allworthy</HI> out of the Room, telling him, <Q REND="inline">'He had Business of Consequence to impart, and must speak to him that Instant in private before he for∣got it.'</Q></P>
<P>The Lovers were now alone, and it will, I ques∣tion not, appear strange to many Readers, that those who had so much to say to one another when Danger and Difficulty attended their Conversation, and who seemed so eager to rush into each others Arms when so many Bars lay in their Way, now that with Safe∣ty they were at Liberty to say or do whatever they pleased, should both remain for some Time silent and motionless; insomuch, that a Stranger of mode∣rate Sagacity might have well concluded they were mutually indifferent: But so it was, however strange it may seem; both sat with their Eyes cast down∣wards on the Ground, and for some Minutes continu∣ed in perfect Silence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> during this Interval, attempted once or twice to speak, but was absolutely incapable, mut∣tering only, or rather, sighing out some broken Words: when <HI>Sophia</HI> at length, partly out of Pity to him, and partly to turn the Discourse from the Sub∣ject which she knew well enough he was endeavouring to open, said:—</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Sure, Sir, you are the most fortunate Man in the World in this Discovery.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">' 'And can you rea∣ly, Madam, think me so fortunate,' said <HI>Jones,</HI> sighing, 'while I have incurred your Displeasure?</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Nay, Sir,' says she, 'as to that you best know whether you have deserved it.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Madam,' answered he, 'you yourself are as well apprized of all my Demerits. Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> has acquainted you with the whole Truth. O! my <HI>Sophia,</HI> am I ne∣ver to hope for Forgiveness?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'I think, Mr. <HI>Jones,'</HI> said she, 'I may almost depend upon your
<PB N="352" REF="357"/>
own Justice, and leave it to yourself to pass Sen∣tence on your own Conduct.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Alas! Madam,' answered he, 'it is Mercy, and not Justice, which I implore at your Hands. Justice I know must con∣demn me—Yet not for the Letter I sent to Lady <HI>Bellaston.</HI> Of that I most solemnly declare, you have had a true Account.'</Q> He then insisted much on the Security given him by <HI>Nightingale</HI> of a fair Pre∣tence for breaking off, if, contrary to their Expecta∣tions, her Ladyship should have accepted his Offer; but confest, that he had been guilty of a great In∣discretion to put such a Letter as that into her Power, which, said he, <Q REND="inline">'I have dearly paid for, in the Effect it has upon you.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I do not, I can∣not,' says she, 'believe otherwise of that Letter than you would have me. My Conduct, I think, shews you clearly I do not believe there is much in that. And yet, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> have I not enough to resent? After what past at <HI>Upton,</HI> so soon to en∣gage in a new Amour with another Woman, while I fancied, and you pretended, your Heart was bleed∣ing for me!—Indeed you have acted strangely. Can I believe the Passion you have profest to me to be sincere? Or if I can, what Happiness can I assure myself of with a Man capable of so much In∣constancy?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'O! my <HI>Sophia,</HI> cries he, 'do not doubt the Sincerity of the purest Passion that ever inflamed a human Breast. Think, most adorable Creature, of my unhappy Situation, of my Des∣pair.—Could I, my <HI>Sophia,</HI> have flatter'd my∣self with the most distant Hopes of being ever per∣mitted to throw myself at your Feet, in the Manner I do now, it would not have been in the Power of any other Woman to have inspired a Thought which the severest Chastity could have condemned. In∣constancy to you! O <HI>Sophia!</HI> if you can have Good∣ness enough to pardon what is past, do not let any

cruel future Apprehensions shut your Mercy against me.—No Repentance was ever more sincere. O! let it reconcile me to my Heaven in this dear Bo∣som.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Sincere Repentance, Mr. <HI>Jones'</HI> answer∣ed she, 'will obtain the Pardon of a Sinner, but it is from one who is a perfect Judge of that Sinceri∣ty. A human Mind may be imposed on; nor is there any infallible Method to prevent it. You must expect however, that if I can be prevailed on by your Repentance to pardon you, I will at least insist on the strongest Proof of its Sincerity.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'O! name any Proof in my Power,'</Q> answered <HI>Jones</HI> ea∣gerly. <Q REND="inline">'Time,' replied she; 'Time, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> can alone convince me that you are a true Penitent, and have resolved to abandon these vicious Courses, which I should detest you, if I imagined you ca∣pable of persevering in.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Do not imagine it,' cries <HI>Jones.</HI> 'On my Knees I intreat, I implore your Confidence, a Confidence which it shall be the Bu∣siness of my Life to deserve.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Let it then,' said she, 'be the Business of some Part of your Life to shew me you deserve it. I think I have been ex∣plicit enough in assuring you, that when I see you merit my Confidence, you will obtain it. After what is past, Sir, can you expect I should take you upon your Word?'</Q></P>
<P>He replied, <Q REND="inline">'Don't believe me upon my Word; I have a better Security, a Pledge for my Constancy, which it is impossible to see and to doubt.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'What is that?'</Q> said <HI>Sophia,</HI> a little surprised. <Q REND="inline">'I will show you, my charming Angel,</Q> cried <HI>Jones,</HI> seiz∣her Hand, and carrying her to the Glass. <Q REND="inline">'There, behold it there, in that lovely Figure, in that Face, that Shape, those Eyes, that Mind which shines through those Eyes: Can the Man who shall be in Possession of these be inconstant? Impossible! my <HI>Sophia.</HI> They would six a <HI>Dorimant,</HI> a Lord <HI>Rochester.</HI> You could not doubt it, if you could

The Delicacy of your Sex cannot conceive the Grossness of ours, nor how little one Sort of Amour has to do with the Heart.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I will never marry a Man,' replied <HI>Sophia,</HI> very gravely, 'who shall not learn Refinement enough to be as incapable as I am myself of making such a Dis∣tinction.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I will learn it,' said <HI>Jones.</HI> 'I have learnt it already. The first Moment of Hope that my <HI>Sophia</HI> might be my Wife taught it me at once; and all the rest of her Sex from that Moment be∣came as little the Objects of Desire to my Sense, as of Passion to my Heart.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Well,' said <HI>Sophia,</HI> the Proof of this must be from Time. Your Si∣tuation, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> is now altered, and I assure you I have great Satisfaction in the Alteration. You will now want no Opportunity of being near me, and convincing me▪ that your Mind is altered too.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'O! my Angel,' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'how shall I thank thy Goodness? And are you so good to own, that you have a Satisfaction in my Prosperity?—Believe me, believe me, Madam, it is you alone have given me a relish to that Prosperity, since I owe to it the dear Hope—O! my <HI>Sophia,</HI> let it not be a distant one.—I will be all Obedience to your Commands. I will not dare to press any farther than you permit me. Yet let me intreat you to appoint a short Trial. O! tell me, when I may expect you will be convinced of what is most solemnly true.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'When I have gone voluntarily thus far, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> said she, 'I expect not to be
<PB N="355" REF="360"/>
pressed. Nay, I will not.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'O don't look un∣kindly thus, my <HI>Sophia,'</HI> cries he. 'I do not, I dare not press you—Yet permit me at least once more to beg you would fix the Period. O! con∣sider the Impatience of Love.'—'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'A Twelve∣month perhaps,'</Q> said she.—<Q REND="inline">'O! my <HI>Sophia,'</HI> cries he, 'you have named an Eternity.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Perhaps it may be something sooner,' says she, 'I will not be teazed. If your Passion for me be what I would have it, I think you may now be easy.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Easy <HI>Sophia,</HI> call not such exulting Happiness as mine by so cold a Name.—O! transporting Thought! am I not assured that the blessed Day will come, when I shall call you mine; when Fears shall be no more; when I shall have that dear, that vast, that exquisite, extatic Delight of making my <HI>Sophia</HI> happy?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir,' said she, 'that Day is in your own Power.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'O! my dear, my divine Angel!' cried he, 'these Words have made me mad with Joy.—But I must, I will thank those dear Lips which have so sweetly pro∣nounced my Bliss,'</Q> He then caught her in his Arms, and kissed her with an Ardour he had never ventured before.</P>
<P>At this Instant, <HI>Western,</HI> who had stood some Time listening, burst into the Room, and with his hunting Voice and Phrase, cry'd out, <Q REND="inline">'To her Boy, to her, go to her.—That's it, little Honeys, O that's it. Well, what is it all over? Hath she appointed the Day, Boy? What, shall it be to-morrow or next Day? It shan't be put off a Minute longer than the next Day, I am resolved,'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Let me be∣seech you, Sir,' says <HI>Jones,</HI> 'don't let me be the Occasion'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Beseech mine A—,' cries <HI>Western,</HI> 'I thought thou had'st been a Lad of high∣er Mettle, than to give way to a Parcel of maidenish Tricks.—I tell thee 'tis all Flimflam.

<PB N="356" REF="361"/>
she'd have the Wedding to-Night with all her Heart. Would'st not <HI>Sophy?</HI> Come confess, and be an honest Girl for once. What, art dumb? Why dost not speak?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Why should I confess, Sir, says <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'since it seems you are so well acquainted with my Thoughts.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'That's a good Girl,' cries he, 'and do'st consent then?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'No indeed, Sir,' says <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'I have given no such Consent.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'And wunt nut ha un then to-Morrow nor next Day?'</Q> says <HI>Western.—</HI><Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir,' says she, 'I have no such Intention.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'But I can tell thee,' replied he, 'why hast nut, only because thou dost love to be disobedient, and to plague and vex thy Father,'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Pray, Sir,'</Q> said <HI>Jones</HI> interfering. <Q REND="inline">'I tell thee, thou at a Puppy,' cries he. 'When I forbid her, then it was all nothing but sighing and whining, and languishing and writing; now I am vor thee, she is against thee. All the Spirit of con∣trary, that's all. She is above being guided and governed by her Father, that's the whole Truth on't. It is only to disoblige and contradict me.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'What would my Papa have me do?'</Q> cries <HI>Sophia.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'What would I have thee do?' says he, 'why gi un thy Hand this Moment.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Well, Sir,' said <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'I will obey you.—There is my Hand, Mr. <HI>Jones.'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'Well, and will you consent to ha un to-morrow Morning?'</Q> says <HI>Western.—</HI><Q REND="inline">'I will be obedient to you, Sir,' cries she.—'Why then to-morrow Morning be the Day,' cries he.—Why then to-morrow Morning shall be the Day, Papa, since you will have it so,'</Q> says <HI>Sophia. Jones</HI> then fell upon his Knees, and kissed her Hand in an Agony of Joy, while <HI>Western</HI> began to caper and dance about the Room, presently crying out,—<Q REND="inline">'Where the Devil is <HI>Allworthy?</HI> He is without now a-talking with that d—d Lawyer <HI>Dowling,</HI> when he should be minding other Matters.'</Q> He then 
<PB N="357" REF="362"/>
sallied out in quest of him, and very opportunely left the Lovers to enjoy a few tender Minutes alone.</P>
<P>But he soon returned with <HI>Allworthy,</HI> saying, <Q REND="inline">'If you won't believe me, you may ask her yourself.

<DIV2 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. <HI>The last In which the History is concluded.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOUNG <HI>Nightingale</HI> had been that Afternoon by Appointment to wait on his Father who received him much more kindly than he expected. There likewise he met his Uncle, who was returned to Town in quest of his new married Daughter.</P>
<P>This Marriage was the luckiest Incident which could have happened to the young Gentleman; for these Brothers lived in a constant Contention about the Go∣verment of their Children, both heartily despising the Method which each other took. Each of them therefore now endeavoured as much as he could to palliate the Offence which his own Child had com∣mitted, and to aggravate the Match of the other. This Desire of triumphing over his Brother, added to the many Arguments which <HI>Allworthy</HI> had used, so strongly operated on the old Gentleman, that he met his Son with a smiling Countenance, and actually
<PB N="359" REF="364"/>
agreed to sup with him that Evening at Mrs. <HI>Mil∣ler'</HI>s.</P>
<P>As for the other, who really loved his Daughter with the most immoderate Affection, there was little Difficulty in inclining him to a Reconciliation. He was no sooner informed by his Nephew where his Daughter and her Husband were, than he declared he would instantly go to her. And when he arrived there, he scarce suffered her to fall upon her Knees, before he took her up, and embraced her with a Tenderness which affected all who saw him; and in less than a Quarter of an Hour was as well re∣conciled to both her and her Husband, as if he had himself joined their Hands.</P>
<P>In this Situation were Affairs when Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> and his Company arrived to complete the Happiness of Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> who no sooner saw <HI>Sophia,</HI> than she guessed every Thing that had happened; and so great was her Friendship to <HI>Jones,</HI> that it added not a few Transports to those she felt on the Happiness of her own Daughter.</P>
<P>There have not, I believe, been many Instances of a number of People met together, where every one was so perfectly happy, as in this Company. Amongst whom the Father of young <HI>Nightingale</HI> enjoyed the least perfect Content; for notwithstanding his Affecti∣on for his Son, notwithstanding the Authority and the Arguments of <HI>Allworthy,</HI> together with the other Motive mentiond before, he could not so entirely be satisfied with his Son's Choice; and perhaps the Presence of <HI>Sophia</HI> herself tended a little to aggravate and heighten his Concern, as a Thought now and then suggested itself, that his Son might have had that Lady, or some such other. Not that any of the Charms which adorned either the Person or Mind of <HI>Sophia,</HI> created the Uneasiness: It was the Contents of her Father's Coffers which set his Heart a longing.
<PB N="360" REF="365"/>
These were the Charms which he could not bear to think his Son had sacrificed to the Daughter of Mrs. <HI>Miller.</HI></P>
<P>The Brides were both very pretty Women; but so totally were they eclipsed by the Beauty of <HI>Sophia,</HI> that had they not been two of the best-tempered Girls in the World, it would have raised some Envy in their Breasts; for neither of their Husbands could long keep his Eyes from <HI>Sophia,</HI> who sat at the Table like a Queen receiving Homage, or rather like a superior Being receiving Adoration from all around her. But it was an Adoration which they gave, not which she ex∣acted: For she was as much distinguished by her Mo∣desty and Affability, as by all her other Perfections.</P>
<P>The Evening was spent in much true Mirth. All were happy, but those the most, who had been most unhappy before. Their former Sufferings and Fears gave such a Relish to their Felicity, as even Love and Fortune in their fullest Flow could not have given with∣out the Advantage of such a Comparison. Yet as great Joy, especially after a sudden Change and Re∣volution of Circumstances, is apt to be silent, and dwells rather in the Heart than on the Tongue, <HI>Jones</HI> and <HI>Sophia</HI> appeared the least merry of the whole Company. Which <HI>Western</HI> observed with great Im∣patience often crying out to them, <Q REND="inline">'Why do'st not talk Boy! Why do'st look so grave! Hast lost thy Tongue Girl! Drink another Glass of Wine, sha't drink another Glass?</Q> And the more to enliven her, he would sometimes sing a merry Song, which bore some Relation to Matrimony, and the Loss of a Maidenhead. Nay, he would have proceeded so far on that Topic, as to have driven her out of the Room, if Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had not checkt him sometimes by Looks, and once or twice by a <HI>Fie! Mr. Western.</HI> He began indeed once to debate the Matter, and as∣sert his Right to talk to his own Daughter as he thought
<PB N="361" REF="366"/>
fit: but as no Body seconded him, he was soon re∣duced to Order.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this little Restraint, he was so pleased with the Chearfulness and Good-Humour of the Company, that he insisted on their meeting the next Day at his Lodgings. They all did so; and the lovely <HI>Sophia,</HI> who was now in private become a Bride too, officiated as the Mistress of the Ceremo∣nies, or, in the polite Phrase, did the Honours of the Table. She had that Morning given her Hand to <HI>Jones,</HI> in the Chapel at <HI>Doctors-Commons,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> Mr. <HI>Western,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> were the only Persons present.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> had earnestly desired her Father, that no o∣thers of the Company, who were that Day to dine with him, should be acquainted with her Marriage. The same Secrecy was enjoined to Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> and <HI>Jones</HI> undertook for <HI>Allworthy.</HI> This some what re∣conciled the Delicacy of <HI>Sophia</HI> to the public Enter∣tainment, which, in Compliance with her Father's Will, she was obliged to go to, greatly against her own Inclinations. In Confidence of this Secrecy, she went through the Day pretty well, till the Squire, who was now advanced into the second Bottle, could contain his Joy no longer, but, filling out a Bum∣per, drank a Health to the Bride. The Health was immediately pledged by all present, to the great Con∣fusion of poor blushing <HI>Sophia,</HI> and the great Concern of <HI>Jones</HI> upon her Account. To say Truth, there was not a Person present made wiser by this Discove∣ry; for Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> had whispered it to her Daugh∣ter, her Daughter to her Husband, her Husband to his Sister, and she to all the rest.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> now took the first Opportunity of withdraing with the Ladies, and the Squire sat in to his Cups, in which he was, by Degrees, deserted by all the Company, except the Uncle of young <HI>Nightingale,</HI> who loved his Bottle as well as <HI>Western</HI> himself.
<PB N="362" REF="367"/>
These two therefore sat stoutly to it, during the whole Evening, and long after that happy Hour which had surrendered the charming <HI>Sophia</HI> to the eager Arms of her enraptured <HI>Jones.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, Reader, we have at length brought our Hi∣story to a Conclusion, in which, to our great Plea∣sure, tho' contrary perhaps to thy Expectation, Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> appears to be the happiest of all human Kind: For what Happiness this World affords equal to the Possession of such a Woman as <HI>Sophia,</HI> I sincerely own I have never yet discovered.</P>
<P>As to the other Persons who have made any consi∣derable Figure in this History, as some may desire to know a little more concerning them, we will proceed in as few Words as possible, to satisfy their Curiosity.</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> hath never yet been prevailed upon to see <HI>Blifil,</HI> but he hath yielded to the Importunity of <HI>Jones,</HI> backed by <HI>Sophia,</HI> to settle 200 <HI>l.</HI> a Year up∣on him; to which <HI>Jones</HI> hath privately added a third. Upon this Income he lives in one of the northern Counties, about 200 Miles distant from <HI>London,</HI> and lays up 200 <HI>l.</HI> a Year out of it, in order to purchase a Seat in the next Parliament from a neighbouring Borough, which he has bargained for with an Attor∣ney there. He is also lately turned Methodist, in hopes of marrying a very rich Widow of that Sect, whose Estate lies in that Part of the Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Square</HI> died soon after he writ the before mention∣ed Letter; and as to <HI>Thwackum,</HI> he continues at his Vicarage. He hath made many fruitless Attempts to regain the Confidence of <HI>Allworthy,</HI> or to ingratiate himself with <HI>Jones,</HI> both of whom he flatters to their Faces, and abuses behind their Backs. But in his stead, Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> hath lately taken Mr. <HI>Abraham Adams</HI> into his House, of whom <HI>Sophia</HI> is grown immoderately fond, and declares he shall have the Tuition of her Children.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="368"/>
Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> is separated from her Husband, and retains the little Remains of her Fortune. She lives in Reputation at the polite End of the Town, and is so good an Oeconomist, that she spends three Times the Income of her Fortune, without running in Debt. She maintains a perfect Intimacy with the Lady of the <HI>Irish</HI> Peer; and in Acts of Friendship to her repays all the Obligations she owes to her Hus∣band.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Western</HI> was soon reconciled to her Niece <HI>So∣phia,</HI> and hath spent two Months together with her in the Country. Lady <HI>Bellaston</HI> made the latter a formal Visit at her Return to Town, where she be∣haved to <HI>Jones,</HI> as to a perfect Stranger, and with great Civility, wished him Joy on his Marriage.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> hath purchased an Estate for his Son in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Jones,</HI> where the young Gentleman, his Lady, Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> and her little Daughter reside, and the most agreeable Intercourse subsists between the two Families.</P>
<P>As to those of lower Account, Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> re∣turned into the Country, had a Pension of 60 <HI>l.</HI> a Year settled upon her by Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and is mar∣ried to Parson <HI>Supple,</HI> on whom, at the Instance of <HI>Sophia, Western</HI> hath bestowed a considerable Living.</P>
<P><HI>Black George</HI> hearing the Discovery that had been made, run away, and was never since heard of; and <HI>Jones</HI> bestowed the Money on his Family, but not in equal Proportions, for <HI>Molly</HI> had much the greatest Share.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Partridge, Jones</HI> hath settled 50 <HI>l.</HI> a Year on him; and he hath again set up a School, in which he meets with much better Encouragement than for∣merly; and there is now a Treaty of Marriage on Foot, between him and Miss <HI>Molly Seagrim,</HI> which through the Mediation of <HI>Sophia,</HI> is likely to take Effect.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="369"/>
We now return to take Leave of Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> and <HI>Sophia,</HI> who, within two Days after their Marriage, attended Mr. <HI>Western</HI> and Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> into the Country. <HI>Western</HI> hath resigned his Family Seat, and the greater Part of his Estate to his Son-in-law, and hath retired to a lesser House of his, in another Part of the Country, which is better for Hunting. Indeed he is often as a Visitant with Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> who as well as his Daughter, hath an infinite Delight in doing every Thing in their Power to please him. And this Desire of theirs is attended with such Success, that the old Gentleman declares he was never happy in his Life till now. He hath here a Parlour and Anti∣chamber to himself, where he gets drunk with whom he pleases, and his Daughter is still as ready as for∣merly to play to him whenever he desires it; for <HI>Jones</HI> hath assured her, that as next to pleasing her, one of his highest Satisfactions is to contribute to the Happiness of the old Man; so the great Duty which she expresses and performs to her Father renders her almost equally dear to him, with the Love which she bestows on himself.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> hath already produced him two fine Chil∣dren, a Boy and a Girl, of whom the old Gentleman is so fond, that he spends much of his Time in the Nursery, where he declares the tattling of his little Grand-Daughter, who is above a Year and half old, is sweeter Music than the finest Cry of Dogs in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> was likewise greatly liberal to <HI>Jones</HI> on the Marriage, and hath omitted no Instance of shew∣ing his Affection to him and his Lady, who love him as a Father. Whatever in the Nature of <HI>Jones</HI> had a Tendency to Vice, has been corrected by continual Conversation with this good Man, and by his Union with the lovely and virtuous <HI>Sophia.</HI> He has also, by Reflexion on his past Follies, acquired a Discretion
<PB N="365" REF="370"/>
and Prudence very uncommon in one of his lively Parts.</P>
<P>To conclude, as there are not to be found a wor∣thier Man and Woman, than this fond Couple, so neither can any be imagined more happy. They pre∣serve the purest and tenderest Affection for each other, an Affection daily encreased and confirmed by mutual Esteem. Nor is their Conduct towards their Relati∣ons and Friends less amiable, than towards one ano∣ther. And such is their Condescension, their Indul∣gence, and their Beneficence to those below them, that there is not a Neighbour, a Tenant, or a Ser∣vant, who doth not most gratefully bless the Day when Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was married to <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
