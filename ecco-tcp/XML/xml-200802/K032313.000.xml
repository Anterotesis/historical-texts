<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO THE King of Sweden, FROM A LADY of <HI>GREAT-BRITAIN.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>TO <HI>Thee</HI> rude Warrior, whom we once admir'd,</L>
<L>And thought thy Actions spoke <HI>Thee</HI> half inspir'd,</L>
<L>While Justice held the Ballance of thy Cause,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Language sounded thy Applause:</L>
<L>But since Ambition and Revenge prevails,</L>
<L>Thy Glories languish, and our Wonder fails;</L>
<L>To <HI>Thee</HI> a Woman sends with Gen'rous Care,</L>
<L>And Warns thy Rashness timely to beware.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FAME now a Tale of fresher Date has told,</L>
<L>Beyond thy mad Romantick Feats of Old:</L>
<L>Our Malecontents thy numerous Squadrons boast,</L>
<L>Describe thy Penants waving on our Coast,</L>
<L>And to the Fearful cry, <HI>Britannia</HI>'s lost!</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4"/>But we, who know the Genius of our Isle,</L>
<L>At their Report, and thy Invasion smile.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ARE not our Dames in every Climate fam'd?</L>
<L><HI>Les Belles Angloises</HI> by ev'ry Nation nam'd?</L>
<L>Are not our Youth in foreign Fields admir'd▪</L>
<L>Alike by Valour and by Love inspir'd▪</L>
<L>And shall those Fair ones, who the Morning pass,</L>
<L>Consulting that dear Friend to Love, the Glass;</L>
<L>To set the Favourite, and the Patch to place;</L>
<L>To bow, and glance it, with becoming Grace</L>
<L>To melt the Hero's Heart and charm his Eyes,</L>
<L>Fall to thy <HI>Gothick</HI> Rage a Sacrifice?</L>
<L>No, to thy Terror learn, our <HI>British</HI> Youth</L>
<L>Are fam'd for Honour, Constancy and Truth:</L>
<L>Each wou'd as soon consent thy Cause to aid,</L>
<L>As yield the Fair to whom his Vows are paid.</L>
<L>Unlike the Passive Females of thy Land,</L>
<L>The Arbitrators of the <HI>War</HI> we stand.</L>
<L>At <HI>Flurt</HI> of <HI>Fan,</HI> our armed Legions fly,</L>
<L>And they who dare offend, must dare to die.</L>
<L>We know thy daring Heart is nurs'd in Blood,</L>
<L>Wild as the fiercest Savage of the Wood;</L>
<L>With Fame like this, in Northern Slaughter shine,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ough as the frozen Bear, thy neighb'ring Sign:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="5"/>But here thy brutal Force no Growns shall gain;</L>
<L>By Love, as well as Arms our Monarchs Reign;</L>
<L>Can we our <HI>GEORGE</HI> and His lov'd RACE disown,</L>
<L>To find thy barren Chastity a Throne?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No! in thy <HI>shaggy Rugg</HI> rude Slumbers take,</L>
<L>And dream of Conquests thou shalt never make;</L>
<L>At distance be thy Leathern Doublet worn,</L>
<L>Nor risque thy Life to purchase certain Scorn;</L>
<L>For now the <HI>Wormwood Dam'sels</HI> apprehend</L>
<L>The dismal Consequence of such a Friend:</L>
<L>Begin to tremble at the Truths they hear,</L>
<L>And vow their Champions shall for <HI>GEORGE</HI> declare:</L>
<L>They fear thy Tast shou'd lead young <HI>James</HI> astray,</L>
<L>And quite unman their Monarch ev'ry way:</L>
<L>In his Excuse they still would have to tell,</L>
<L>Tho' War's his Foe, He loves exceeding well;</L>
<L>The Proof from whence he sprung, is'not to Fight;</L>
<L>His <HI>Surgeon</HI> proves <HI>Hereditary</HI> Right.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT if by thy Example he should grow</L>
<L>Cold as thy Rocks of Ice, and Hills of Snow:</L>
<L>Shou'd he clean Linnen hold in dire Disgrace,</L>
<L>And <HI>sable Crape</HI> his Ivory Neck enchase:</L>
<L>Shou'd he, like thee, on Shives of coarsest Bread,</L>
<L>Rudely with dirty Thumbs his Butter spread;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="6"/>Banish the generous Juice of Grapes away,</L>
<L>And with small acid Tiff his Thirst allay;</L>
<L>Swallow lean hasty Meals of Tastless Roots,</L>
<L>And Eat, and Drink, and Live and Reign in Boots;</L>
<L>Shou'd he, like thee regardless of the Fair,</L>
<L>Lye down to Sleep, and only wake to War;</L>
<L>Cou'd He in Arms, like Gallant <HI>Brunswick,</HI> Shine,</L>
<L>Yet wou'd His Female Friends His Cause decline,</L>
<L>Nor justifie a Right so slovenly Divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>CONSULT thy Safety; send no Armies forth</L>
<L>Beyond the Confines of thy frozen North:</L>
<L>Since of our <HI>British</HI> Fair this Truth is told,</L>
<L>We love the Chaste, but we abhor the Cold:</L>
<L>But if thy daring Folly will proceed,</L>
<L>Fate drives thee forward, and thy Fall's decreed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>EACH lovely Toast her Hero's Soul inspires,</L>
<L>Urges the War, and wakes his Martial Fires:</L>
<L>Think but what Terrors will thy Spirits seize</L>
<L>When thou shalt face such Enemies as these;</L>
<L>See a Battalion lac'd with Point <HI>d'Espan,</HI></L>
<L>And warm in glowing Velvets leads the Van:</L>
<L>With Warlike Air, th' embroider'd Chiefs appear,</L>
<L>And gracefully the Looms rich Labours wear:</L>
<L>In Modish Order, o'er their Sholders fly</L>
<L><HI>Deville</HI>'s Wiggs, or <HI>Lockman</HI>'s smarter Tye;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="7"/>The Gold-Clock'd Stocking draws the Gazer's Sight,</L>
<L>And <HI>Verdin</HI>'s Red-top'd Shoe, stitch'd round with White:</L>
<L>Fine <HI>Meclin</HI> Laces round their Fingers play</L>
<L>From Snowy Shirts, at least chang'd twice a Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THESE well-dress'd Youths to thy Destruction move,</L>
<L>And Vict'ry waits upon the Wings of Love,</L>
<L>Our Sexes Softness is to thee unknown;</L>
<L>What by a Look, or one kind Kiss is done!</L>
<L>Thou, who a Stranger art to Love's Delight,</L>
<L>Can'st ne'er imagine how these Lovers Fight.</L>
<L>These are the <HI>Men,</HI> who on the <HI>Flandrian</HI> Plains</L>
<L>O'erthrew the <HI>Grand Monarch</HI> in Ten Campaigns:</L>
<L>Will these give way before <HI>Thy Vandal</HI> Host</L>
<L>And yield their former Labours all for lost?</L>
<L>No, these for Liberty, and Beauty draw,</L>
<L>And all around the Neighb'ring Tyrants awe:</L>
<L>These Cock, take Snuff, invoke the darling Fair,</L>
<L>And then dispatch the Foe <HI>endebonair.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AIM then no more, fond Prince, at <HI>George's</HI> Throne,</L>
<L>Wake from the flatt'ring Dream, and guard thy own,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="8"/>In ev'ry Element alike we Reign,</L>
<L>And launch our ready Squadrons on the Main:</L>
<L>Our Champions, jocund o'er the flowing Bowl,</L>
<L>Reigns in their Wooden Worlds, from Pole to Pole;</L>
<L>Fearless of Danger, cut their conqu'ring Way,</L>
<L>And from invading Tyrants scour the Sea.</L>
<L>Safer thou might'st in Lakes of Sulphur sleep,</L>
<L>Than brave these dreadful Masters of the Deep:</L>
<L>Beneath their Cannons roar, thy Flaggs must fall,</L>
<L><HI>ORFORD</HI> presides, and these are <HI>Brittons</HI> all.</L>
<L>These, bold as Lyons, will the Fight maintain,</L>
<L>Or drive thee back, or sink thee in the Main:</L>
<L>Tho' Boisterous as the Winds at Sea they roar,</L>
<L>They're gentle all, as Southern Gales on Shore.</L>
<L>Th' Engagement past, the tender Thoughts return,</L>
<L>And for the Fair in Love's foft Fires they burn;</L>
<L>In Beauty's dear Embraces lull'd they lie,</L>
<L>But when their <HI>Country</HI> calls, Her strongest Foes defie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THESE hoist their Sails, and wait thy Coming o'er,</L>
<L>And if thou dar'st to touch <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Shore,</L>
<L>Ne'er hope to see thy Native <HI>Sweden</HI> more.</L>
<L>How wilt thou dare these Hearts of Oak to meet</L>
<L>Shou'd Young <HI>Augustus</HI> deign to lead the Fleet?</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="9"/><HI>Augustus! He!</HI> who striding o'er the Slain,</L>
<L>Hunted thy <HI>New Ally</HI> o'er <HI>Flandria</HI>'s Plain:</L>
<L>The <HI>Boy,</HI> whose <HI>Cause</HI> forsaken now by all,</L>
<L>Calls for a Madman to prevent his Fall.</L>
<L>No <HI>Dastard Blood</HI> our Princes Veins disgrace,</L>
<L>Unlike the <HI>Princes</HI> of a <HI>Former</HI> Race,</L>
<L>Who wisely <HI>Slept</HI> or <HI>Blubber'd</HI> in Distress,</L>
<L>He'll Face the Battel, and will force Success.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FROM Great <HI>Plantagenet Augustus</HI> springs,</L>
<L>By <HI>His</HI> Example taught to Conquer Kings.</L>
<L>Methinks I see the <HI>Royal Warriour</HI> stand</L>
<L>Dealing amongst his <HI>Chiefs</HI> thy Forfeit Land;</L>
<L>While <HI>Thou</HI> shalt fall Unpity'd, and Forlorn,</L>
<L>All <HI>Europe</HI>'s Terror once, but now all <HI>Europe</HI>'s Scorn.</L>
