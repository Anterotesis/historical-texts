<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>BIOGRAPHERS, in the pursuit of infor∣mation, are naturally betrayed into mi∣nute researches. The curiosity of the reader is seldom proportioned to that of the writer in this species of composition. Every inci∣dent, relating to a favourite character which the mind has long contemplated with atten∣tion, acquires importance. On these prin∣ciples we may venture to found a plausible excuse, for the many trifling discoveries, and intricate discussions of insignificant circum∣stances, with which personal history so much abounds.</P>
<P>To this apology, which every biographer has a right to plead, the writer of the fol∣lowing memoirs presumes he possesses a pe∣culiar
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
claim, arising from his situation and connections. He describes the life of a per∣son, whom the strongest principles of grati∣tude, implanted in early years, have habitu∣ally taught him to regard with united vene∣ration and affection. Under these circum∣stances, the slightest events appear interesting; and the most frivolous anecdotes of such a life are investigated with a pleasing enthusiasm.</P>
<P>In the mean time, a want of materials might have justly been here alledged, in ex∣tenuation of an objection so constantly urged against works of this kind. It will readily be granted, that to record the lives of men who have adorned their country by monu∣ments of munificence, is a tribute indispens∣ably due to public merit, and which cannot without public injustice be witheld. But to discharge this duty even imperfectly, and by those means, however inadequate, which the utmost exertions of diligent enquiry can afford, is less unpardonable than to neglect
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
it entirely. When we cannot recover a per∣fect portrait of our friend and our benefactor, we must be contented with a few faint out∣lines. Abundance only implies rejection; and where but little can be collected, it is necessary to retain every thing. We must ac∣quiesce in anecdotes of inconsiderable conse∣quence, while those of more importance can∣not be procured.</P>
<P>These inconveniencies might have easily been prevented. But our ancestors had no regard for futurity. They trusted the re∣membrances of their heroes to chance and tradition; or rather, to the laborious in∣vestigation of a distant posterity. For it is the task of modern times to commemorate, if they cannot imitate, the conspicuous ex∣amples of antiquity; and to compose the panegyric of those virtues which exist no more. Inquisitive leisure is not the lot of earlier eras. Ages of action are succeeded by ages of enquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
But that species of enquiry which properly belongs to the biographer, seems, in point of time, to be posteriour to that which forms the province of the historian. It does not grow fashionable till late: it begins to be the favourite amusement of cultivated na∣tions at their most polished periods. When the more important and extensive stores of historical information have been exhausted, the growing spirit of curiosity, which in∣creases in proportion as it is gratified, still demands new gratifications; it descends to particularities, and delights to develope cir∣cumstances of a subordinate nature. After many general histories have been written, inquisitive minds are eager to explore the parts of what they have hitherto surveyed at large. The ardour of research, which gathers strength from contraction, is exerted on dis∣tinct periods; and at length personal history commences. Characters before only repre∣sented in the gross, and but incidentally ex∣hibited
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
or superficially displayed, now be∣come the subject of critical disquisition, and a separate examination. Occurences neglect∣ed or omitted by the historian, form mate∣rials for the biographer: and men of supe∣riour eminence are selected from the common mass of public transactions in which they were indistinctly grouped, and delineated as detatched figures in a single point of view.</P>
<P>Nor was it till late after the restoration of literature, that biography assumed its proper form, and appeared in its genuine character. The Lives which were compiled at some dis∣tance after that period, are extremely jejune and defective performances. The first which approached to perfection were those of Pei∣reskius, by Peter Gassendus, and of Melanc∣thon, by Camerarius. It was long, before the perseverance of investigation connected with precision, the patient toil of tracing evi∣dences, authenticating facts, and digesting scattered notices, grew into a science: in a
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
word, before the accuracy of the antiquarian was engrafted on the researches of the bio∣grapher. The masterly Life of William of Wykeham will best explain and illustrate these reflections: a work which I chuse to produce as an example on this occasion, not only because it is here produced as an ex∣ample with a peculiar degree of propriety, but because it is a pattern of that excellence in this mode of writing, which I mean to characterise and recommend.</P>
<P>As sir Thomas Pope bore some share in the national transactions of his time, to re∣lieve the dryness of personal and local inci∣dents, I have endeavoured to render these pages in some measure interesting to general readers, by dilating this part of my perform∣ance, and by sometimes introducing historical digressions, yet resulting immediately from the tenour of my subject. Amongst these, I flatter myself that my relation of the perse∣cutions of the princess Elizabeth may merit
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
some attention: of which I have thrown together a more uniform and circumstantial detail than has yet appeared, with the ad∣dition of several anecdotes respecting that transaction not hitherto published.</P>
<P>On the whole I may venture to affirm, that I have at least attempted to make my work as entertaining as possible. My materials have not always been of the most brilliant kind; but they are such, as have often enabled me to enliven and embellish my narrative by pre∣senting pictures of antient manners, which are ever striking to the imagination.</P>
<P>I have before hinted, that my resources for compiling this history were slender and in∣sufficient. From books I could obtain scarce any information. Indeed, my chief assis∣tance has been derived from manuscript au∣thorities. I have not however in this respect found the success I wished. Yet I have carefully consulted every record that seemed
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
likely to illustrate my subject; and my refe∣rences will shew, that I have searched a variety of authentic instruments, preserved in the British Museum, the chapel of the Rolls, and other repositories of valuable originals. Of these the more important are printed at large in the Appendix.</P>
<P>Among my references to manuscript au∣thorities, two sometimes occur which require explanation. These are, <HI>MSS. Cotton. Vitel∣lius,</HI> F. 5. <HI>MSS. Strype.</HI> And, <HI>MSS. F. Wise.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1709, that industrious and ac∣curate annalist Mr. John Strype, communi∣cated to doctor Arthur Charlett, master of University college, originally fellow of Tri∣nity college, an account of the Funeral of sir Thomas Pope<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Ballard's Coll. of Letters, MSS. Bibl. Bodl. fol. xv. pag. 31. Letter from Strype to Charlett, dated Lowlayton, Essex, Apr. 20. 1709. See LIFE, infr. p. 178.</NOTE>. This account Strype had transcribed from a manuscript of the
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Cotton library, which he perpetually cites in in his ECCLESIASTICAL MEMOIRS, marked <HI>Vitellius,</HI> F. 5<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In a letter from Strype to Charlett, dat. ibid. Apr. 5. 1709. MSS. ut supr. vol. xv. p. 31. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The kindness you bear to the foundation of Trinity college, makes me inquisitive into the Founder's place of burial, which you find mentioned in my ANNALS, [p. 3. edit. i.] Though I cannot easily re∣collect every manuscript and particular place in them whence I have compiled every part of the history. Yet it occurs to me, that sir THOMAS POPE's Funeral, with the time and place, as also the rest of pages 30, 31, [viz.] the funerals in those pages mentioned, were taken from the volume, VITELLIUS F. 5. in the Cotton library, which is a certain brief journal of funeral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and as well of divers other occurrences, begin∣ning at the year 1550, written, as it seems, by some herald, or other diligent observer of his own times. There the writer sets down all the particular ceremonies, the solemnities, and mourners, at that knight's interment. Which if you have any desire to know, I will transcribe out of my notes and send you."</Q> This is an original. Then follows the letter be∣fore referred to, which is not the original, but a transcript by the late Mr. Rawlins of Pophills in Gloucestershire, who be∣came possessed of Charlett's extensive correspondence. See AP∣PEND. p. 458. infr.</NOTE>. Soon afterwards it appears that Strype sent to Charlett, perhaps at his request, a few other notices relating to sir Thomas Pope, extracted from the same manuscript.
<PB N="12" REF="11" MS="y"/>
The late learned Mr Francis Wise, keeper of the archives, Radclivian librarian, and fellow of Trinity college, at Oxford, copied all the transcripts, about four or five in num∣ber, which Strype on this occasion had made from the Cotton manuscript, by per∣mission of Charlett, among whose curious and numerous papers they were kept; and by Mr. Wise they were thus communicated to me. Fortunately for the present underta∣king, the extracts had been made by Strype before the fire happened in the Cotton li∣brary, then placed in Ashburnham house at Westminster, by which fatal accident this valuable volume was particularly damaged; and, as far as I can judge from a cursory in∣spection, most of the leaves, if not all, con∣taining Strype's extracts, were either destroy∣ed or obliterated<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">But see APPEND. Numb. xxviii.</NOTE>. The reader is therefore desired to observe, that the reference, viz. <HI>MSS. Cotton. Vitell.</HI> F. 5. <HI>MSS. Strype,</HI> sig∣nifies
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Strype's transcripts from thence<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See pp. 46. 86. 89. 91.</NOTE>. But whenever this Cotton manuscript is cited without the addition of <HI>MSS. Strype,</HI> the reader will remember, that such citations were faithfully transcribed by myself from that manuscript volume, now belonging to the British Museum.</P>
<P>Mr. Wise also transcribed, and communi∣cated to me, two or three other papers from doctor Charlett's collections, beside those of Strype which I have just mentioned<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See pp. 185. 189. And APPEND. Numb. xxix.</NOTE>. These I have called <HI>MSS. F. Wise</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>Since my first edition, among the manuscript papers of the Rev. Thomas Wilkes, D.D. fellow of Trinity college, Ox∣ford, and who died rector of Rotherfield Greys in Oxfordshire, in 1745, I have met with other notices by Mr. Wise, which are now first inserted in this edition, and are also styled, MSS. F. Wise. These Mr. Wise seems to have had chiefly from Dr. Charlett's collections, and the family-papers of the late sir Harry Pope-Blount.</P>
<P>As to Charlett's collections, I learn that he derived many of his notices and informations on this subject, from Mr. Josiah Howe, a fellow of the college; a short account of whom will not be superfluous, as it may tend to establish their credit. He was born at Crendon in Bucks, and elected Scholar of Trinity college, June 12, 1632. Registr. Coll. fol. 68. b. Admitted Fellow, being then bachelor of Arts, May 26, 1637. Ibid. fol. 72. b. By Hearne he is called, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a very great cavalier and loyaliss, and a most ingenious man."</Q> Rob. Glouc. GLOSS. p. 669. He appears to have been a general and an accomplish∣ed scholar, and in polite literature esteemed one of the ornaments of the university. In 1644, he preached before king Charles the first at Christ-church cathedral Oxford. The sermon was printed, and in red letters, by the king's special command. Only thirty copies were printed. One was purchased, in 1723, by Hearne from Dr. Charlett's library: the same, and that per∣haps the only one extant, which is now among Rawlinson's Books in the Bodleian. See Hearne's MSS. COLL. vol. 102. p. 8. Charlett bought this rarity many years before, at the high price of five shillings. Ibid. vol. 51. p. 176. In 1646, he was created Bachelor of Divinity by decree of the king, among others who were complimented with that degree for having dis∣tinguished themselves as preachers before the Court at Oxford. He was soon afterwards ejected from his Fellowship by the presbyterians, but not in the general expulsion in 1648, accord∣ing to Walker, SUFF. CLERG. p. 134. Being one of the Bur∣sars of the college and foreseeing its fate, having resolved at the same time never to acknowledge the authority of Cromwell's visitors, he retired, in the beginning of the year 1648, to a college-estate in Buckinghamshire, carrying with him many ren∣tals, rolls, papers, and other authentic documents, belonging to his office. He was invited to return to the college by Dr. Harris the new presbyterian President, on a promise, that if he would quietly give up the official books, his submission to the visitors should be dispensed with, and he should be permitted to retain his fellowship without molestation. Harris by this artifice having recovered the books, immediately signed an order for Howe's expulsion; pretending to have received an unexpected injunction from the visitors, and professing his regret at being obliged to remove so valuable a member from the foundation. Hearne, MSS. COLL. vol. 89. p. 195. He was restored to his fellowship in 1660. He has a Copy of recommendatory English verses prefixed to the folio edition of Beaumont and Fletcher, printed in 1647. Another to Thomas Randoph's POEMS, reprinted at Oxford, in 1640. Another to Cartwright's COMEDIES and POEMS, at Oxford, 1651. These pieces in the witty epigrammatic style which then prevailed, have uncommon acuteness, and highly deserve to be revived. Some others have perhaps escaped me. In those I have mentioned, he appears in company with Denham, Waller, Jonson, Corbett, Brome, Shirley, Mayne, and others the most ingenious men of those times, who were of his intimate acquaintance. Wood says that he wrote a copy of Englishe verses, which were much applauded, spoken before the duke and duchess of York, in 1683, at Tri∣nity college. MSS. Mus. Ashmol. fol. 57. D. 19. He lived forty two years, greatly respected, after his restitution, and ar∣riving at the age of ninety, died fellow of the college, where he constantly resided, Aug. 28, 1701. He is interred, under a small marble lozenge, with a short inscription, in the college-chapel. Hearne says, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he lived so retiredly in the latter part of his life, that he rarely came abroad; so that I could never see him, though I have often much desired to have a sight of him."</Q> GLOSS. ut supr. p. 670.

will easily be understood, as care has been taken to give them with equal exactness and perspicuity.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
I must not here omit, what I am much honoured in mentioning, that this work
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
is greatly indebted to the friendship of the bishop of Worcester; who most obligingly condescended to favour me with some va∣luable communications, from the family papers of his lordship's father, the earl of Guildford.</P>

His second wife, Margaret, mother of THOMAS POPE, was the daughter of Edmund Yate, of Stan∣lake in Oxfordshire<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>From Lee's MS. visitation, ut supr. pag. 51.

See the pedigree of Yate of Charney, which is not altogether exact, in Ashmole's Berkshire, iii. 321.</P>
<P>Wood says, that Margaret Pope, in the text, was the daugh∣ter of — Yate of <HI>Stanford</HI> in Wootton-hundred in Oxford∣shire. Hist. Antiq. univ. Oxon. ii. 301. But no such place occurs in that hundred. Ashmole, Berks. iii. 295. mentions Yate of Stanford, Berks; which place Wood seems to have confounded with <HI>Sandford,</HI> a village in Wootton-hundred. Many of the family of Yate appear to have lived in, and about, the villages of Charney, Buckland, and Stanford, Berks, and Stanlake, Oxfordshire; places all of the same neighbourhood. What still further confirms my supposition, that Wood is mis∣taken, and that the said Edmund Yate, of Stanlake, was Mar∣garet Pope's father, is; that Peter Yate of Stanlake, whom Sir Thomas Pope in a letter, dat. 1557, calls his cousin, appears to have been a tenant to Trinity college, Oxford. In indentur. dat. Jul. 3. 1556. I find likewise one Barthol. Yate, co.

<P>It seems most probable, that he was imme∣diately sent from Eton school to some of the inns of court. I believe, to Gray's-inn.

<P>But whatever was our young adventurer's situation in early life, it is remarkable that a person of his obscure family and inconsiderable fortune, should so soon recommend himself to public notice, and gain access even to the royal favour.

<P><PB N="8" REF="23"/>
What was the first step to his advance∣ment in life, and whether it arose from the friendship of some private patron, from any distinguished merit in his profession, a peculiar cast for business in general, or a lucky con∣currence of all these causes, cannot be precisely determined, although from what follows it may be partly conjectured. He was not much more than twenty-seven years of age, when he had sufficient address or interest to procure an appointment to offices, which seem to have been alternately bestowed upon Henry's most eminent favourites, and the most popular cha∣racters of those times<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Fuller in his quaint manner, observes concerning him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I behold him as fortunae suae fabrum; the smith, who by God's blessing, hammered out his own fortune without any patrimonial advantage."</Q> Worthies of England, Article London, p. 223. edit. 1662.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having been early initiated, as I before ob∣served, in the business of chancery, on the fifth day October, 1533, he was constituted by let∣ters patent of Henry the eighth, clerk of the briefs in the star-chamber at Westminster<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">See Append.

<P>On the thirteenth day of November 1535, he was constituted, by the king's letters patent, warden of the mint, exchange, and coinage, in the tower of London, on the voluntary re∣signation, in his favour, of John Coppynger, page of the great wardrobe<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Pat. 26. Hen. viii. par. 2. See Append. No. III. See more of John Coppynger, ibid. in the Notes.</NOTE>. How long he continued in this office I have not learned.

<P><PB N="10" REF="25"/>
On February the twenty-eighth, 1538, he obtained, at his own instance, a new royal li∣cence for exercising the office of clerk of the crown in conjunction with John Lucas<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Pat. 29. Hen. viii. ut supr.</NOTE>, who was afterwards, in the reign of Edward the sixth, an eminent crown-lawyer, and employ∣ed by that prince in many important commis∣sions<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Strype, Eccl. Mem. ii. 498. And ibid. B. ii. Ch. xxix. pass.</NOTE>. The first of these grants he perhaps obtained by the recommendation of Sir Tho∣mas More; who presiding as Lord Chancellor in the court above-mentioned, where Sir Tho∣mas Pope was employed when a young man, might have taken particular notice of his pro∣mising diligence and abilities; and from which circumstance, a lasting friendship and intimacy between them both, as will be shewn here∣after, seems to have originally commenced. Although there is equal reason to suppose, as it will likewise appear in its proper place, that he was in no less favour and esteem with Sir Thomas More's successor, the Lord Chancellor Thomas lord Audley; under whose immediate inspection and authority he exercised the office of clerk of the crown, and clerk of the briefs in the star-chamber: and to both of which
<PB N="11" REF="26"/>
departments, as I presume, he must have been appointed by Lord Chancellor Audley's nomi∣nation<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Lord Audley was appointed Lord Keeper, May 20, 1532, on the resignation of Sir T.

Both offices, I apprehend, were in the appointment of the Chancellor, as the clerk of the crown is at present: although they passed in the king's name. The star-chamber was a branch of chancery.

<P>But these appointments were soon succeeded by one of much greater consequence. For in the year 1536, he was constituted, by the king, Treasurer of the Court of augmentations of the king's revenue, on its first establishment by act of parliament<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Statut.

<P>The principal design of this court was for estimating the lands of the dissolved mona∣steries, vested in the Crown, and for receiving their revenues. It had moreover full power and authority to sell the monastic possessions for the king's service<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">From the act.</NOTE>. It was so called from the encrease which the royal revenue received,
<PB N="12" REF="27"/>
by this new acquisition of property. All per∣sons holding leases and pensions, by former grants, from any convent, exhibited their titles before this court, and their pretensions were allowed in proportion to their validity. And although the governors of the religious houses, foreseein their fate, often contrived immedi∣ately before the dissolution of their respective societies, to forge new contracts or indentures in favour of their friends or kindred, few frauds of this kind took effect. For the court seems to have been very vigilant in preventing and exposing such specious impostures<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Fuller Ch, Hist. B. vi. p. 349.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The officers of this court were a Chancel∣lor, it's superior, a Treasurer abovementioned, who was the second officer, a sollicitor, ten auditors, seventeen recievers, with others, be∣longing to the inferior departments. It was a court of record, and possessed of two seals<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">From the Act of parl. ut sup.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Treasurer's office appears to have been a post of considerable profit and distinction, and of equal trust and importance. He was ranked with the principal officers of state in the reign of Henry the eighth. For by statute of the same, he was privileged, together with
<PB N="13" REF="28"/>
the chancellor of the said court, the chancellor of the dutchy of Lancaster, the treasurer of the king's chamber, the chancellor of the court of first Fruits and Tenths, the master of the king's wards and liveries, the groom of the stole, the warden of the cinque ports, and other honourable personages, respectively, to retain in his house one chaplain having a bene∣fice with cure of souls, who should not be compelled to residence<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Statut. Hen. viii. an. 33. c. xxviii. And 21. xiii.</NOTE>. The Treasurer was allowed a limited annual salary for the exercise of his office; as also perquisites for such sums of money as he paid to the patentees of any office, fee, or annuity, granted under the seal of the court: and also, for such disbursements as he made to any other persons, by virtue of the king's warrant or bill assigned, or by bill assigned and subscribed by the chancellor, and one other officer.</P>
<P>These fees were regulated according to the practice of the court of the dutchy of Lancas∣ter<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ex Statut. ut supr.</NOTE>. The allowance of Sir John Williams, afterwards Lord Williams of Tame, Treasurer of this court in the reign of Edward the sixth, was 320 l. A sum, which I presume, was

then the full value of this place<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Fuller Ch. Hist. b. vi. p. 348. edit. 1651. In lieu of this salary, queen Mary granted Sir J.

<P>The Treasurer at his admission was sworn before the chancellor, that he would reasonably and honestly procure the king's profit, admi∣nister justice to the poor as well as the rich, faithfully keep and expend the king's treasure, and exhibit a true declaration of it without concealment. The receivers were ordered to pay into his hands the whole rents of all the dissolved monasteries: concerning which he accounted annually before the chancellor and two auditors. The chaneellor, Treasurer, at∣torney, and sollicitor, or any two of them were entrusted with power or licence to act without the king's warrant<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ex Statut. ut supr.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the dissolution of any greater abbey, some of the auditors, who were employed in riding to survey the manors and lands of the court, repaired thither, and were lodged and

It would have broken the thread of my narrative, if I had before observed, that in 1535, June the twenty-sixth, beginning now to rise in the world, he received from Barker, otherwise garter king at arms, a patent for a new coat of arms, to be borne by him and his posterity<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Penes honoratis.

<P>A few years after the erection of the court of augmentations above-mentioned, the king perceiving that his exigencies required more expeditious returns of money than the annual revenues of the dissolved monasteries could pro∣duce, was necessitated to sell by one extensive commission a very considerable part of their lands, for the purpose of raising present supplies. By this step the court of augmentations was soon diminished. The causes depending in it became few and inconsiderable, and the crown∣profits arising from thence decreased; it's offi∣cers were numerous, and their pensions ample. On these considerations he was induced to dis∣solve it; which he did by letters patent only: and on the second of January, 1546, created by the same letters patent, a new court of augmentations, on a different and more con∣fined plan.</P>
<P>In an original rough draught of this new establishment<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In the British Museum. MSS. Harl. 600. 1.</NOTE>, Sir Thomas Pope is nominated, by the king, master of the woods of the court
<PB N="18" REF="33"/>

The other principal patent∣officers, recited in the instrument, are Sir Ed∣ward North, who is appointed chancellor, Sir Walter Mildmay, and Sir Thomas Moyle, ge∣neral surveyors, Robert Henneage master of the woods beyond Trent, Richard Goodricke, attorney, and John Gosnold, sollicitor. The rest are Geoffry Gates, and John Arnscott, sur∣veyors of the woods on each side Trent, and Richard Duke. The two masters of the woods on each side Trent, are styled the fourth offi∣cers.

<P>In the year 1553, the last of the reign of Ed∣ward the sixth, the first effort was made for the actual abolition of this court, which by degrees was become burthensome, and at length super∣fluous. Accordingly, the same year, at Mary's

<P><PB N="20" REF="35"/>
It is commonly supposed, and it has been said in general terms, that Sir Thomas Pope was appointed one of the commissioners, or vi∣sitors, under Cromwell, for dissolving the reli∣gious houses. It is indeed true, that he was one of those, into whose hands the seal of the magnificent and opulent abbey of Saint Alban's was surrendered on the fifth day of December, 1539, by the last abbot, Richard Stevenache<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Stevens's Monasticon, i. 264. Weever's Fun. mon. p. 112. edit. 1631.</NOTE>. This however is the only instance I can find, that he was ever concerned in this sort of bu∣siness. His name does not appear among the persons specially appointed by Cromwell for this purpose; whose names are recited by Dug∣dale<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Warwickshire, p. 800, seq.</NOTE> from an authentic manuscript in the
<PB N="21" REF="36"/>
Cotton Library. Nor does his name occur in the private commissions, which, after a dili∣gent search, I have seen relating to this matter; nor in any instruments of resignation, letters of advice to the visitor general, memorials, or other authentic papers, concerning the visitati∣on or suppression of any monastery. My opi∣nion is therefore, that he was only occasionally employed at Saint Alban's, as being one of the principal officers in the court of augmentations, as the place was in the neighbourhood of Lon∣don, and as the surrender of so famous an ab∣bey was an affair of some importance. Thus we find that the priory, now the dean and chapter, of Canterbury, was not dissolved in the ordi∣nary way; it being thought necessary, that the archbishop of Canterbury, the master of the rolls, Walter Henley attorney and Nicholas Bacon sollicitor of the augmentation-court with four others, should be sent thither, to take the resignation of the prior and monks<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Somner's CANTERBURY, by Batteley, Append. p. 118. It was 31. Hen. viii.</NOTE>. However, if it can be proved, that he was ever engaged on other occasions in these violent proceedings of an avaricious and arbitrary prince, it may at the same time be fairly presumed, that in an em∣ployment which afforded so many obvious temptations to fraud, oppression and rapacity,
<PB N="22" REF="37"/>
he behaved with singular decency, moderation, and honour. Of this we have the impartial evidence of a prejudiced historian. For Fuller, who is remarkably severe on the visitors in general, and who is seldom sparing of his invectives, wherever he can discover the slightest foundation for abuse, mentioning Sir Thomas Pope as an agent in these af∣fairs, immediately subjoins: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"However, by all the printed books of that age, he ap∣peareth one of a candid carriage; and in this respect stands sole and single by himself. That of the abbey-lands which he received, he refunded a considerable proportion for the building and endowing Trinity college in Oxford<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Worthies. London, p. 223.</NOTE>."</Q> And in another place, he mentions him with honour on the same subject. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But the most pleasant object to entertain us at this time in England, is the beholding of two fair and fresh foundations in Oxford; the one Trinity college, built by Sir Thomas Pope, <HI>principal visitor</HI> at the dissolution of abbies<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">This is a mistake, as we have before seen.</NOTE>. Now as none were losers employed in that service, so we find few refunding back to charitable uses; and perchance this man alone the thankful Samaritane who made a publick acknowledgement<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Church-Hist. B. viii. p. 39.</NOTE>."</Q> At the surren∣der
<PB N="23" REF="38"/>
of Saint Alban's Abbey, he preserved by his interest, and particular application to the king, the noble conventual church now stand∣ing, and made parochial<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">From the information of the late Sir Harry Pope-Blount, of Tittenhanger in Hertfordshire.</NOTE>: one of the earliest and most venerable monuments of Norman architecture remaining in England<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">It was built by Paulin, the fourteenth abbot, a Norman, about the Year 1080.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the whole, the circumstance of his hav∣ing received grants of the lands of the monaste∣ries, seems to have occasioned the mistaken sup∣position that he was frequently and professedly concerned as a Commissioner in the dissolution of their foundations. That his prodigious pro∣perty was accumulated in consequence of the destruction of the religious houses, is not deni∣ed: and the lucky oportunity of raising an es∣tate from this grand harvest of riches which now lay open before him, seems to have divert∣ed his thoughts from making a fortune by the law; a profession which he most probably would have otherwise continued to cultivate with the greatest success, and in which he might have undoubtedly claimed the most opu∣lent and distinguished stations. I could give a minute detail, from the most authentic evi∣dences, of the grants of abbey-land, which he
<PB N="24" REF="39"/>
recieved during the reign of Henry the eighth; but it may suffice to observe in more general terms, that before the year 1556, he appears to have been actually possessed of more than thirty manors in Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, War∣wickshire, Derbyshire, Bedfordshire, Hereford∣shire, and Kent; beside other considerable es∣tates, and several advowsons. Some of these possessions were given him by Henry the eighth; but the greatest part was acquired by purchase while he was connected with the court of augmentations<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">See Dugdale's Warwickshire. And from the patents.</NOTE>. Many of his estates were bought of Queen Mary<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ex muniment. coll. praedict. And lib. prim. <HI>lez rates,</HI> ann. 3, 4. Phil. Mar. MSS.

<P>But let us suppose, what indeed cannot be proved, that Sir Thomas Pope was one of Cromwell's visitors in the affair of the monas∣teries. For although I have insinuated above, that these visitors were not on all occasions en∣tirely justifiable in their proceedings, I am yet
<PB N="25" REF="40"/>
inclined to think, that their conduct and be∣haviour were in general less blameable than has been commonly represented.</P>
<P>It is no wonder, that the monks should load those whom they esteemed the instruments of their ruin with many calumnies; all which were studiously propagated and heightened by their advocates of the catholic persuasion. And it should at the same time be remembered, that the king's injunctions, under which they acted, were extremely severe; insomuch, that many fraternities desired their houses might be rather entirely suppressed, than reformed under such rigorous conditions.</P>
<P>With regard to the vices and disorders<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Even in the Nunneries, where, among the softer sex, some degree of delicacy, at least of decorum, might have justly been expected, the lowest vices, not to insist on the more criminal irregularities, were too often practised. In the Benedictine con∣vent of Rumsey, in Hamshire, at a visitation by Bishop Fox, held in the year 1506, Joyce Rows the abbess is accused of im∣moderate Drinking, especially <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"tempore nocturno;"</Q> and of inviting the nuns to her chamber every evening, for the purpose of these excesses, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"post completorium."</Q> The nuns are also for∣bidden to have such frequent and familiar access, at undue times, to the house of the bailiff or chief hind of the monastery, whence unfavourable suspicions have arisen; and the said bailiff himself is ordered, no more to frequent the chambers of the abbess or nuns. Some of them are enjoined to abstain <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a so∣cietate sacerdotum;"</Q> and the abbess in particular is com∣manded to avoid all communications with Seculars; especially with some whose names are expressly mentioned, and who are known to have <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"accessum et recursum ad Eam."</Q> One of the injunctions to the nuns in general is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Quòa sint</HI> sobriae, <HI>et se ab∣stineant a</HI> potu <HI>post Completcrium.</HI>"</Q> Apud Registr.

monasteries, their reports sometimes perhaps deserve credit, as those enormities are too natu∣rally and unavoidably connected with the mo∣nastic institution. In this, as in all other cases of that sort, mutual opposition produced mu∣tual obloquy.</P>
<P>Nor should it be forgotten, that the visitors gave a favorable report of some houses. They interceded earnestly for the nunnery of God-stowe in Oxfordshire: declaring that the nuns were strict in their lives; and alledging that the suppression of this house would prove an irre∣parable inconvenience, as most of the young ladies of the best families of that county were sent thither for education<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Burnet.

<P>On the fifth day of July<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See More's WORKES. fol. 1537. pag. 1457.</NOTE>, 1535, he waited on sir Thomas More, then under condemnation in the Tower, early in the morning; and ac∣quainted him that he came by command of the king and council, to bring his unfortunate friend the melancholy news, that he must suf∣fer death before nine of the clock the same morning, and that therefore he should imme∣diately begin to prepare himself for that awe∣ful event.

it was the king's pleasure that at the place of execution he should not use many words.

In consequence of sir Thomas Pope's in∣tercession with the king, agreeably to More's earnest and dying request, his favorite daugh∣ter, Margaret Roper, and others of his family were permitted to be present at his interment, which was performed immediately after the execution in the chapel of the Tower. But Margaret afterwards, and probably by the same interest, begged the body of the king, and deposited it on the south-side of the choir of the church of Chelsea, where a monu∣ment, with an inscription written by himself, had been erected some time before. This affectionate daughter, whose resolution equals her pity, also found means to procure her father's head, after it had remained, igno∣miniously stuck on a pole, on London bridge, for fourteen days.

<P>IN the reign of Edward the sixth, when the religious and political affairs of the kingdom took another turn, and all pub∣lic business fell into the hands of new minis∣ters and managers, sir Thomas Pope did not comply with the times. He was appointed to no office, nor enjoyed any favor in this reign. He received indeed some grants of land from the crown about the first year of this king, with Cranmer archbishop of Canterbury, the duke of Somerset, the earl of Warwick, the marquis of Northampton, and several other principal persons of the court. But these grants were made for past services, and in con∣sideration of other claims due from the deceas∣ed king<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Strype Eccl. Mem. ii. 78.—Some of the particulars may perhaps be seen in pat. 1. Edw. vi. test. Jul. 24. par. 4.—Likewise, in this reign, sir Richard Leigh is licenced to alienate a manor to sir T. Pope, pat. 1.

<P><PB N="38" REF="53"/>
The unlimited authority, and arbitrary do∣minion of Henry, had kept both protestants and papists in subjection. Under such a govern∣ment they both acted uniformly, and neither party presumed to claim any apparent superiori∣ty. But upon the decease of that uncontroulable monarch, the people discovered their real sen∣timents without reserve, and protestantism manifestly began to be the prevailing religion. The protector Somerset, who had long been a secret partisan of the reformers, on the ac∣cession of young Edward, publicly declared his intention of forwarding and establishing the reformation. In this scheme he was hap∣pily seconded by most of the privy council, who after the fall of Southampton seem en∣tirely to have deserted the catholic commu∣nion. The protector wisely took care that all persons to whom he entrusted the educa∣tion of the young king, should be attached to these rational principles; and preferred and encouraged those alone that appeared active in this profession.</P>
<P>Thus most of the courtiers, yet more perhaps in general from lucrative views than from real conviction, became converts to the predomi∣nant party: amongst which, however, I do not find sir Thomas Pope. This, at least,
<PB N="39" REF="54"/>
shews a steadiness and uniformity of mind in those days of change, which afford such fre∣quent instances of occasional compliance.</P>
<P>Nor let it be deemed any inconsistency of character, that he, though a rigid papist, should have been in the preceding reign an agent for suppressing the monasteries, and a receiver of their possessions. For the demo∣lition of these houses was not an act of the church but of the state. It was prior to the reformation of religion, and effected by a king and parliament of the popish communion. It was even confirmed by the parliament of queen Mary<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Statut, 1, 2. Phil. Mar. cap. viii. inf. citat.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Very few papists wrote or remonstrated against the destruction of these societies. With∣out the least impeachment of their principles, or suspicion of apostacy, several others, the strictest members of the catholic persuasion, and the most respectable characters of those times, among which, to mention no more, was the duke of Norfolk, accepted grants of the con∣ventual estates.</P>
<P>Even the clergy thought it no sacrilege to share in these acquisitions. The dean and
<PB N="40" REF="55"/>
chapter of Litchfield, and the abbot and con∣vent of Westminster, made no scruple of re∣ceiving manors alienated from other religious corporations<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See Tanner's Notit. Mon. fol. edit. pref. p. xxxix.</NOTE>, lately dissolved. Burnet tells us<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ref. i. 251.</NOTE>, that bishop Gardiner was remarkably ve∣hement in declaiming against the monasteries; and that in many of his sermons he commend∣ed the king for supperssing them<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">See Fox, vol. ii. p. 426.</NOTE>. Queen Mary, in the very first year of her reign, made grants of the site of twenty religious houses, and of very large quantities of abbey-land<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Tanner, ubi supr.</NOTE>. The bishops and clergy in a catholic convoca∣tion, 1554, petitioned that the pope would not insist on a restitution of the ecclesiastical revenues, but rather confirm them to those lords and gentlemen by whom they had been obtained<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Wilkins's Councils. iv. 10t.</NOTE>. And it is notorious, that some of the popish bishops were no less alienators of their episcopal endowments<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Tanner ubi supr. And Collier Eccl. hist. xi. 324, 306. Heylin p. 121.</NOTE>, than many other bishops of the protestant church proved afterwards, in the reigns of Edward the sixth and Elizabeth. The bishop of Chichester, in opening the disputation of Henry the eighth
<PB N="41" REF="56"/>
with Lambert, in Westminster-hall, ranked the king's disincorporation of the monks with his rejection of the see of Rome, his abolition of idolatrous adoration, and the introduction of the English bible; as a matter of an external nature, and in no respect interfering with the essentials of the catholic communion<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">See MSS. C. C. C. C. cxxvii. 5.</NOTE>. The monastic institution was no part of the papistic theology. Undoubtedly the suppression of the convents facilitated the admission of protesta∣tism: but it was evidently undertaken on other principles.</P>
<P>When queen Mary succeeded to the throne, sir Thomas Pope was again taken into favour, and soon afterwards constituted one of the queen's privy counsellors<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Hollingshead. iii. 1159. Speed, 854.</NOTE>. He is likewise said to have been appointed cofferer to the houshold<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">MSS. Rawlins. bibl. Bodl.

<P>But before I proceed further in this reign, it may be proper to obviate some seeming diffi∣culties and inconsistences, by premising, on what security sir Thomas Pope, together with many others, held his church-revenues, under
<PB N="42" REF="57"/>
a bigotted catholic queen, and upon the resto∣ration of the popish religion. By way of pro∣curing new concessions in favour of Rome, and to prevent unseasonable alarms, at the begin∣ning of this reign, both the queen and the pope had given repeated assurances that the church and abbey lands should remain, forever unreclaimed, in the hands of their present possessors<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Heylin Eccle. rest. p. 41.</NOTE>. But that the tenure of these pos∣sessions should not be fixed on so precarious a foundation as that of mere promises, in 1554, an act of parliament was passed; which, while it restored the pope's authority, gave absolute security to the proprictors of the ecclesiastical estates, entirely confirmed their title beyond the power of resumption, and, at the same time, exempted them from the danger of spi∣ritual censures<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Statut. 1, 2. Phil. Mar. cap. viii.</NOTE>. In the mean time, that this measure might receive the fullest sanction, car∣dinal Pole, who was invested by the pope with legantine jurisdiction, ratified the parliament's decree: and, that the dispensation might be still more ample and effectual, in consequence of his master's commission, the legate ensured even the property of future acquisitions of church lands to the present receivers<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. And Strype Eccl. Mem. iii. 159. seq. See also Harl. miscell. vii. p. 264, 266.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="58"/>
Thus, an equivalent was granted on both sides. The nobility and gentry were settled in the quiet enjoyment of their estates; and the pope, although most essentially weakened by the alienation of that wealth on which his power so much depended, was reinstated in his supremacy over the church.</P>
<P>During this reign sir Thomas Pope was often employed in commissions of conse∣quence. On the twenty-ninth day of July, 1553, he was commissioned by the coun∣cil, together with sir Arthur Darcy, and others<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burghley's State papers, by Haynes, p. 162.</NOTE>, to apprehend lord Russel, Anthony Browne of Essex, and several accomplices con∣cerned in the duke of Northumberland's in∣surrection; who, on the death of Edward, had raised an army with an intent to place the lady Jane Gray on the throne, before Mary was proclaimed queen. The duke himself had been apprehended some little time before. For after many fruitless efforts, and vain expectations of a reinforcement, he suddenly changed his principles, dismissed his troops, and tamely submitted to proclaim queen Mary with all external demonstrations of triumph and satis∣faction. Being immediately arrested by the
<PB N="44" REF="59"/>
earl of Arundel, he fell on his knees and ab∣jectly begged his life<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Ref. ii. 239.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the same year, on the twenty-third day of February, I find him directed by the council, together with lord Rich, the master of the rolls, the lieutenant of the Tower, and others, to appoint a certain number of the council, who should constantly remain, and dispatch business, at London<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Q Mary's council book, MSS. Harl. Brit. mus. 643.</NOTE>. For the court, whom the privy council always followed and attend∣ed, was often held at different palaces in the country; as at Oatelands, Richmond, Green∣wich, and other places<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">In the reign of Henry the eighth, the principal places of the royal residence in the country were Richmond, Hampton court, Wird or, Eltham, and Woodstock.

Mem. iii. 33.</NOTE>. By which
<PB N="45" REF="60"/>
it appears, that this department had been greatly neglected in the foregoing reign; or that the queen was willing to take the proper precautions against any future attack on her title, from her factious and discontented sub∣jects. The same year, on the twenty-ninth day of October, he was appointed, with the lord treasurer, the earl of Arundel, lord Rich, sir Francis Englefield, and several others, to examine certain offenders taken in Northum∣berland's rebellion, and to assess their fines<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burghley's State papers, ut supr. p. 193.</NOTE>. Soon afterwards, in the beginning of 1554, I find him present, together with sir Philip Denny, sir Thomas Brydges, and others, when sir Thomas Wyat, and his desperate associates, after their rash and abortive enterprise, were led prisoners into the tower of London. On which occasion sir Thomas Pope severely re∣proached Brett, one of the principal rebels, for his complicated cowardice and treachery. A charge which the prisoner could not but ac∣knowledge with much shame and confusion. For Brett, being the captain of a detachment of archers in the queen's service, had privately revolted with all his party at a time of danger, and joined Wyat's army<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>MSS.

In the same year, sir Thomas Pope was one of the champions at a magnificent justing ex∣hibited before the queen at Westminster.

For this business sir Thomas Pope was admirably qualified, from that knowledge and experience in stating extensive and com∣plicated accounts, which he must have acqui∣red while he was concerned in the court of Augmentations. And for the same reason, in the succeeding reign, sir Walter Mildmay was deputed by the lords, to make a general inqui∣sition of the royal revenue<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Strype. Ann.

This expedient of borrowing money at an exorbitant interest of the merchants of Ant∣werp, was a measure which Mary was oblig∣ed to put in practice more than once<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Council-book. MSS. Brit. Mus. ut supr.</NOTE>. And it had been to her honor, if she had used no worse. For indeed the chief object of go∣vernment, which for some time engaged her attention, was to raise large sums by the most irregular methods, or to extort money from her subjects. She sometimes endeavoured to recruit her exhausted exchequer by retrench∣ing the public expences at home. She de∣molished several forts on the river below Gravesend, which were filled with superflu∣ous garrisons; she broke all the body guards, half the band of pensioners, the gentlemen of the stables, and the pages of honor: and proposed to disband the hundred archers of the guard. But to frugality she added oppression, and her unhappy necessities fre∣quently compelled her to the most violent and unjustifiable experiments. She levied sixty thousand marks from seven thousand yeomen, and thirty-six thousand pounds from the mer∣chants. This was exacted, because they had not contributed to a former loan of sixty thou∣sand pounds levied on a thousand persons, in
<PB N="49" REF="64"/>
whose compliance, either on account of their loyalty or their riches, she firmly confided. But that tax not being found sufficient, she exacted a general loan of an hundred pounds each, on all who possessed an annual income of twenty pounds. This imposition obliged many of the gentry to reduce their domestic expences, and to dismiss many of their servants, that they might, at least more prudently, comply with her commands. And as these servants, having no means of subsistence, by too com∣mon a transition from that state of idleness, betook themselves to theft and robbery, the queen knew no better method of redressing the grievance, than to publish a proclamation, obliging their former masters to take them back to their services. In order to gratify the city of London for past favors, and to engage them to assist her with future supplies, she issued an edict, at their instance, prohibit∣ing for four months, the exportation of Eng∣lish clothes into Flanders. By this iniquit∣ous combination, a good market was procured in that country for such as had already sent thither large quantities of that sort of mer∣chandise<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Carte, iii. 330, 331, 337, 341.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Her extravagancies proved a perpetual ob∣struction to the commercial interests of the
<PB N="50" REF="65"/>
kingdom. Her own bigottry was not always a sufficient restraint on her conscience, to pre∣vent her from exposing to sale the revenues<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">See supr. pag. 40.</NOTE> of that church, in defence of which she had sacrificed in the flames so many victims. But it would be endless and impertinent here, to mention at large her multiplied extortions; and the various imprudent or fraudulent schemes, which her exigencies invented for obtaining money. It may be sufficient to add, that these expedients were employed, not to carry on an expensive war, for she was in profound peace with all the world; nor to promote the national welfare by any new esta∣blishments or improvements: but to satisfy the unjust demands of a husband, who slighted her love, neglected her interests, and solely consulted his own convenience.</P>
<P>On this occasion one cannot help observing the weakness of the human mind under the most powerful and importunate of passions. Mary regarded her husband Philip with all the fondness and sollicitude of an uncertain lover. This attachment produced strange contradic∣tions in her sentiments and behaviour. She was naturally too phlegmatic to be profuse; yet, from a penurious and economical habit

of mind, she suddenly became rapacious and expensive. She persecuted the reformed with the most barbarous severities, yet alienated the riches assigned to support her favorite superstitions. In this situation, she was at once deserted by that cold and stoical inflexi∣bility which distinguishes her character; and the sedate and gloomy queen suffered herself to be betrayed into greater inconsistencies of conduct, than even the most unaccountable caprice of her father Henry could have dic∣tated.</P>
<P>Before the reign of queen Mary, it was the common practice with our English princes to have recourse to the city of Antwerp for voluntary loans; and we generally find their credit so low, that they were obliged to en∣gage the city of London to join in the secu∣rity. But this business seems never to have been so effectually conducted as by that pub∣lic-spirited and enterprizing merchant, sir Thomas Gresham, who began to be employed in this agency by Edward the sixth<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">See Burghley's State papers, by Haynes, p. 185. And Ward's Life of Gresham, p. 7.</NOTE>. He was likewise employed by queen Elizabeth for the same purpose; one of whose first steps, at her accession, was to procure money. She
<PB N="52" REF="67"/>
sent Gresham to Antwerp to borrow two hundred thousand pounds, in order to enable her to reform the coinage, at that time ex∣tremely debased. But, as a most sensible and acute historian observes<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hume, hist. Eliz. p. 731. edit. 410.</NOTE>, she was so impolitic as to make herself an innovation in the coin; by dividing a pound of silver into sixty-two shillings, instead of sixty, the former standard.</P>
<P>In the year 1557, on the eighth of February, sir Thomas Pope was joined by the queen, in a famous commission for the more effectual suppression of heretics<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Burner's Reformation, Coll. of records, part. ii. b. ii. p. 311. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Having special trust and confidence in your fidelities, wisdoms, and discretions, &amp;c."</Q></NOTE>, in concert with Bon∣ner, bishop of London, Thirlby, bishop of Ely, the Lords Windsor and North, secretary Bourne, sir John Mordaunt, sir Francis Engle∣field, sir Edward Waldegrave, sir Nicholas Hare, sir Roger Cholmeley, sir Richard Read, sir Thomas Stradling, sir Rowland Hill, ser∣jeant Rastall, Cole, dean of saint Paul's, Wil∣liam Cooke, Thomas Martin, John Story, and John Vaughan, doctors of law, and Wil∣liam Roper and Ralph Cholmeley, esquires. These commissioners were empowered to en∣quire after all persons suspected of heretical
<PB N="53" REF="68"/>
opinions: to search for and seize seditious and heterodox books, either exposed to sale, or secreted in private houses: to investi∣gate and examine concealments, contempts, conspiracies, and calumnies, against the go∣vernment. They were ordered to detect those persons who refused to preach the sacrament of the altar, to hear mass, to take holy bread or holy water, to frequent their respective public churches, and to assist in the solemn processions. They were likewise privileged to summon what witnesses they judged most proper, and to tender oaths to the parties prosecuted, for answering such questions as might be deemed most convenient for dis∣covering the truth, In this injunction how∣ever, there is a remarkable clause of restraint upon the commissioners. For it is expressly commanded, that if any person brought be∣fore them for heretical doctrines or opinions, should still obstinately persist in his error, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He should immediately be committed to his ordinary, there to be used according to the spiritual and ecclesiastical laws."</Q></P>
<P>Bishop Burnet, whose imagination was per∣petually haunted with the horrors of popery, supposes, that something more dreadful was intended by this commission than appears at first sight, and that it was undoubtedly de∣signed
<PB N="54" REF="69"/>
as the tribunal of an Inquisition in England<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hist. Ref. ii. 347.</NOTE>. But a superficial reader may plain∣ly perceive, that there is nothing of the form, process, or power, of an Inquisition contained in this instrument. The commissioners receive no authority to try heterodoxy, nor to put the offenders upon <HI>making an act of faith.</HI> On the contrary, they are directed to deliver up all delinquents to the ordinary. And even here the process is to be regulated by the laws of the church. These circumstances seem sufficiently to exclude the idea of an inquisi∣torial tribunal. For the proceedings of the commissioners, however rigorously they might have been conducted, were not unlimited and arbitrary; but finally determinable by the proper ecclesiastical officer, who was himself controlled by the spiritual constitutions of the land, which did not at least on this occasion, receive any degree of extension. The zealous bishop makes the matter still more alarming, where he tells us, that in support of such measures, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he finds it said, that some ad∣vised that courts of inquisition, like those in France and Spain, might be set up in England<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ubi supr. p. 346.</NOTE>."</Q> But he does not inform us by whom this is said, nor can I find this advice

And indeed if we consider the queen's late expostulation with the pope, in which she declared her resolution of maintaining the prerogative and the constitution<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">When the Pope would have obtruded a new legate, in the place of cardinal Pole, and while he was actually on his journey to England, the queen absolutely refused his admission into the kingdom.

Burnet, Ref. ii. 305.</NOTE>: and if to these reasons we add the distinguished lenity, moderation, and candor of cardinal Pope; this project of an English inquisition must appear altogether improbable.</P>
<P>But whatever was the real state of the case, we find that the commissioners, sensible that persecution naturally counteracts its own pur∣pose,
<PB N="56" REF="71"/>
and averse to measures which might pro∣bably end in the most inhuman punishments, did little or nothing in this business<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Heylin, ubi supr.</NOTE>: espe∣cially as to the detection of prohibited books. For so inactive were they, that on the sixth of June, 1558, the queen was obliged to pub∣lish a proclamation<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heylin, ubi supr. Strype, Eccl. Mem. iii. 459.</NOTE>; in which she com∣plains, that not only numberless seditious and treasonable treatises, were printed at home and dispersed without controul, but even import∣ed from abroad. As the provocation was great, so the proclamation is conceived in the most despotic and unconstitutional terms. It sets forth, amonst other extraordinary menaces, that if those persons who find such unlaw∣ful books do not immediately destroy them, they shall be reputed rebels, and executed accordingly by martial law. The queen in∣deed had some reason for complaint, and for substituting somewhat more effectual in the place of her former commission by this recent injunction. For during the actual subsistence and authority of that commission, Knox and Goodman printed, and imported from Geneva, a piece entitled, <HI>The first Blast of the Trumpet against the monstrous Regimen of Women</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Genev. 8vo. 1558.</NOTE>. In
<PB N="57" REF="72"/>
this performance, which is full of paradox and enthusiasm, they call the queen <HI>Trait∣ress, Bastard, Proserpine;</HI> with other terms of illiberal and ridiculous abuse. Goodman also published about the same time, <HI>How superior Powers ought to be obeyed of their Subjects, and wherein they may be lawfully by God's Word dis∣obeyed and resisted</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Genev. 16to. 1558. printed by John Crispin. Unluckily, Mary herself while princess, in 1548, yet certainly without any heretical intention, had published a piece, which of course fell under the censure of this commission. It was a translation of Erasmus's paraphrase on St. John, and done by desire of queen Catharine Parr. The preface is written by Udall, master of Eton-school; in which he much extolls, and I believe not without reason, Mary's proficience in literature.</NOTE>. But these treatises, writ∣ten chiefly for the gratification of Calvin then living at Geneva, were not more invectives against the invincible bigottries of Mary, and the gross absurdities of popery, than they were openly subversive of all established go∣vernment and religion.

<P>Amongst other pasquinades, there were prints, or pictures, representing her majesty, naked, meager, withered, and wrinkled, with every aggravated circumstance of deformity that could disgrace a female figure, seated in a regal chair; a crown on her head, surrounded with M.

<P><PB N="59" REF="74"/>
With regard to the persecutions of this reign, which occasioned the commission in which Sir Thomas Pope was concerned, re∣lating to the suppression of heretics, we will allow that the queen and her friends had suffered, what they thought the most in∣jurious treatment; and, no doubt, when power returned into their hands, were but too na∣turally disposed to retaliate in their own way. These oppressions, perhaps injudiciously con∣ducted, prepared the way for popery: just as the severities of Mary, at the succession of Elisabeth made the protestants more violent against the papists. In the reign of Henry the eighth, the monasteries were destroyed, and the wealth of the church, in which it's strength consisted, was dissipated. Three of the abbots, in the course of that transaction, were unjustly put to death<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Collier, Eccl. Hist. ii. 164.</NOTE>. Six bishops, amongst which were Mary's favorites, and the great champions of her religion, Bonner and Gardiner, were deprived, insulted, and imprisoned, during the reign of Edward the sixth<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">See Heylin, Eccles. Rest. sub. ann. 1551.</NOTE>. In the same reign, the queen, while princess, was absolutely forbidden to hear mass; a misfortune, in her ideas, almost equal
<PB N="60" REF="75"/>
to the loss of life<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See MSS. Harl. Brit. Mus. 6195. 26. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mary had ra∣ther loss her life than part with the mass."</Q></NOTE>: and her friends who pri∣vately interposed to defeat the execution of this dreadful interdiction, were sent to the Tower<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Strype, Eccl. Mem. iii. 253. seq.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But as no religion can expiate, so no provo∣cation can justify, no resentment can excuse, that uninterrupted series of deliberate barbarity which marks every page of her unprosperous annals with martyrdoms, hardly to be parallel∣ed in the pagan persecutions of primitive chris∣tianity. If in the two preceding reigns, many venerable prelates of Mary's communion had been injuriously treated, or even put to death, for conscientious disobedience, yet none of them were inhumanly dragged to the flames like the meek Latimer or the learned Rid∣ley. It is also allowed, that to burn heretics was an established doctrine of the catholic re∣ligion. But in what age of the same religion, or in what country, were these punishments ever executed with so many circumstances of cruelty? Her attempt to restore the monaste∣ries, however conformable to her system, was a measure, which tended only to bring back national poverty with national superstition: for
<PB N="61" REF="76"/>
it is certain, that Henry's distribution of the monastic revenues into private hands, although dictated by selfish and fordid motives, founded the present greatness of England. In the mean time it will be but charitable to grant, that her private life was confessedly blameless and un∣blemished. I will not say whether it was her fault or her unhappiness, that the constancy of her attachments seldom met with suitable re∣turns of gratitude and affection. In this at least some goodness of heart appears, that no∣thing affected her so much, as the unkindness of those whom she best loved. She possessed a firmness of mind, which deserved better times; and a vigour of understanding, which was im∣peded by religious prejudices. Her merits, whatever they were, seem to have been over∣looked in her misfortunes: and as the latter were aggravated, so the former were obliterat∣ed, by that blaze of prosperity which sur∣rounded the succeeding reign.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1555, the princess Elizabeth, afterwards queen, having been before treated with much insolence and inhumanity, was placed under the care and inspection of sir Thomas Pope<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fox, edit. 1684. iii. 798. Speed, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Mary cherished that an∣tipathy to the certain heiress of her crown and her successor, which all princes who have no children to succeed naturally feel. But the most powerful cause of Mary's hatred of the princess, with whom she formerly lived in some degree of friendship<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Strype, Eccl. Mem. iii. 14. 17. 82. At queen Mary's coro∣nation, the lady Elizabeth rode in the first chariot, with lady Anne of Cleves, after the queen's litter, in the procession from the tower to Westminster. Strype, ib. 36. See also Hollingsh. Chron. iii. 1152. col. 1.</NOTE>, seems to have arisen from Courtney, earl of Devonshire.</P>
<P>The person, address, and other engaging ac∣complishments<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">He was polite, studious, and learned; an accurate master of the languages, skilled in the mathematics, painting, and music. He lived a prisoner in the tower, from fourteen to twenty-six years of age; when he was set at liberty by queen Mary, at her accession. Strype, Eccl. Mem. iii. 339.</NOTE> of this young nobleman, had
<PB N="63" REF="78"/>
made a manifest impression on the queen<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Ref. ii. 255.</NOTE>. Other circumstances also contributed to ren∣der him an object of her affection; for he was an Englishman, and nearly allied to the crown; and consequently could not fail of proving acceptable to the nation. The earl was no stranger to these favorable disposi∣tions of the queen towards him<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Goodwyn, p. 339.</NOTE>. Yet, he seemed rather to attach himself to the prin∣cess; whose youth and lively conversation had more prevailing charms than the pomp and power of her sister<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Ref. ii. 273. Collier, Eccl. Hist. ii. 352, 362.</NOTE>. This preference not only produced a total change in Mary's senti∣ments which regard to the earl, but forced her openly to declare war against Elizabeth.</P>
<P>The ancient quarrel between their mothers remained deeply rooted in the malignant heart of the queen<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, Eliz. per Hearne, i. <HI>Apparatus,</HI> pag. 19.</NOTE>: and she took advantage from the declaration made by parliament in favor of Catharine's marriage<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Statut. Mar. i. cap. i.</NOTE>, to represent her sister's birth as illegitimate. Elizabeth's in∣clination to the protestant religion still fur∣ther heightened Mary's aversion: it offended her bigottry, disappointed her exspectations,
<PB N="64" REF="79"/>
and disconcerted her politics. These causes of dislike, however, might perhaps have been forgotten by degrees, or, at least, would have ended in secret disgust. But when the queen found that the princess had obstructed her de∣signs in a matter of the most interesting nature; female resentment, founded on female jealousy, and exasperated by pride, could no longer be suppressed.</P>
<P>So much more forcible, and of so much more consequence in public affairs, are private feelings, and the secret undiscerned opera∣tions of the heart, than the most important political reasons. Monsieur Noailles, however, the French embassador at the court of Eng∣land during this period, with the true dignity of a mysterious statesman, seems unwilling to refer the queen's displeasure to so slight a mo∣tive: and assigns a more profound intrigue as the foundation of Courtenay's disgrace. Do∣mestic incidents operate alike in every station of life; and often form the greatest events of history. Princes have their passions in com∣mon with the rest of mankind.</P>
<P>Elizabeth being now become the public and avowed object of Mary's aversion, was openly treated with much disrespect and in∣sult. She was forbidden to take place, in the
<PB N="65" REF="80"/>
presence chamber, of the countess of Lenox and the dutchess of Suffolk, as if her legiti∣macy had been dubious<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Goodwyn.</NOTE>. This doctrine had been insinuated by the chancellor Gardiner, in a speech before both houses of parliament<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sess. sec. ann. prim. Mar.</NOTE>. Among other arguments enforcing the neces∣sity of Mary's marriage, he particularly in∣sisted on the failure of the royal lineage; art∣fully remarking, that none of Henry's descen∣dants remained, except the queen, and the <HI>princess</HI> Elisabeth<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Avoiding the term <HI>sister.</HI> Amb. de Noailles, apud Carte, iii. 310.</NOTE>. Her friends were neglect∣ed or affronted. And while her amiable qua∣lifications every day drew the attention of the young nobility, and rendered her universally popular, the malevolence of the vindictive queen still encreased. The princess therefore thought it most prudent to leave the court: and before the begining of 1554, retired to her house at Ashridge in Hertfordshire<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Wherein our most worthie and ever famous queen Elisabeth lodged as in her owne, beinge then a more stately house, at the time of Wyatt's attempte in queen Maryes daye."</Q> Norden's <HI>Discription of Hartfordshire,</HI> written 1596. pag. 12. edit. 1723.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Sir Thomas Wyat's rebel∣lion, abovementioned, broke out, in opposition
<PB N="66" REF="81"/>
to the queen's match with Philip of Spain. It was immediately pretended, that the princess Elisabeth, together with lord Courteney, was privately concerned in this dangerous conspi∣racy, and that she had held a correspondence with the traitor Wyat. Accordingly<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">See Hollingshed's Chron. iii. 1151. seq. From Fox.</NOTE>, sir Ed∣ward Hastings, afterwards lord Loughborough, sir Thomas Cornwallis, and sir Richard South∣well, attended by a troop of horse, were ordered to bring her to the court.

She positively denied the accusation. However they informed her, it was the queen's resolution the should be com∣mitted to the Tower, till further enquiries could be made<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hollingshead, ut supr.</NOTE>.

<P>At her first commitment, only three men and three women of the queen's servants, were
<PB N="68" REF="83"/>
appointed for her attendants. But even these were forbidden to bring her meat; and she was waited on, for this purpose, by the lieu∣tenant's servants, or even by the common soldiers. But afterwards, two yeomen of her chamber, one of her robes, two of her pantry and ewry, one of her buttery, one of her cellar, another of her larder, and two of her kitchen, were allowed, by permission of the privy council, to serve at her table. No stranger, or visitor, was admitted into her presence. The constable of the tower, sir John Gage, treated her very severely, and watched her with the utmost vigilance. Many of the other prisoners, committed to the same place on account of the rebellion, were often exa∣mined about her concern in the conspiracy: and some of them were put to the rack, by way of extorting an accusation. Her inno∣cence however was unquestionable: for al∣though Wyat himself had accused her, in hopes to have saved his own life by means of so base and scandalous an artifice, yet he afterwards denied that she had the least know∣ledge of his designs; and lest those denials which he made at his examinations might be insidiously suppressed, and his former depo∣sitions alledged against her adopted in their stead, he continued to make the same declara∣tions
<PB N="69" REF="84"/>
openly on the scaffold at the time of his execution<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hollingshead, ut supr.</NOTE>,</P>
<P>There was a pretence, much insisted on by Gardiner, that Wyat had conveyed to her a bracelet, in which the whole scheme of the plot was inclosed. But Wyat acquitted her of this and all other suspicions<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Strype, Eccl. Mem. iii. 97.</NOTE>. After a close imprisonment of some days, by the generous intercession of lord Chandois, lieutenant of the tower, it was granted that she might sometimes walk in the queen's lodgings<NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Concerning these apartments in the Tower, see the very judicious and ingenious Mr. Walpole's <HI>Historic Doubts concern∣ing Richard the Third.</HI></NOTE>, in the presence of the constable, the lieutenant, and three of the queen's ladies; yet on condi∣tion that the windows should be shut. She then was indulged with walking in a little garden, for the sake of fresh air: but all the shutters which looked towards the garden were ordered to be kept close.</P>
<P>Such were their jealousies, that a little boy of four years old who had been accustomed every day to bring her flowers, was severely threatened if he came any more; and the child's father was summoned and rebuked by
<PB N="70" REF="85"/>
the constable. But lord Chandois being ob∣served to treat the princess with too much respect, he was not any longer entrusted with the charge of her; and she was committed to the custody of sir Henry Bedingfield, of Ox∣burgh in Norfolk<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">He was firmly attached to the queen's interests. Beside his Government of the Tower, he was knight marshal of the queen's army, captain of her guards, vice-chamberlain to the queen, and a privy counsellor.

<P>Arriving at Woodstock, she was lodged in the gatehouse of the palace; in an apartment remaining complete within these fifty years with it's original arched roof of Irish oak, curiously carved, painted blue sprinkled with gold, and to the last retaining it's name of <HI>Queen Elizabeth's chamber</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The old royal manor, or palace, at Woodstock, was be∣sieged in the grand rebellion, and much damaged in the siege. The furniture was afterwards sold, and the buildings portion∣ed out by Cromwell, or his agents, to three persons. Two of them, about 1652, pulled down their portions for the sake of the stone. The third suffered his part to stand, which con∣sisted of the gatehouse in which the princess Elizabeth was imprisoned, and some adjoining ruinous buildings. After the rebellion, lord Lovelace turned this gatehouse into a dwelling house, and lived in it for many years. As to its adjoining ruins, persons now living remember standing, a noble porch, and some walls of the hall; the walls and magnificent window; of the chapel; several turrets at proper dista ces; and could trace out many of the apartments. Sir John Vanbrugh, while Blenheim palace was building, had taste enough to lay out 2000 l. in keeping up the ruins. But afterwards lord treasurer Godolphin observed to Sarah, dutchess-dowager of Marlbo∣rough, that a pile of ruins in the front of so sine a seat, was an unseemly object, all the old buildings, and amongst the rest, the princess Elizabeth's gatehouse, were entirely demolished and erased. Aubrey, the antiquarian, acquaints us that in the old hall there were two rows of pillars, as in a church; and that the arches were of the zigzag Norman shape. He has left us in his manuscript, Drawings of the windows in the larger apart∣ments, and in the chapel and hall. Aubrey's CHRONOLOGIA ARCHITECTONICA, MSS. in Mus. Ashmol. Oxon. fol. pag. 7.

She had however little opportu∣nity for meditation or amusement. She was closely guarded: yet sometimes suffered to walk into the gardens of the palace. In this situation, says Hollingshead, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"no marvell, if

<P>After being confined here for many months, she procured a permission to write to the queen: but her importunate keeper Beding∣field intruded, and overlooked what she wrote<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hollingshead ut supr.</NOTE>.

Hollingshead, p. 117. col. 2. But there is some reason to suspect, that Fox, from whom Hollingshead transcribes, has aggravated, in his account, sir Henry's usage of the princess. After she was queen, he was very often at court, and her ma∣jesty visited him in a progress, 1578. And though she frequent∣ly called him her <HI>Jaylor,</HI> yet this seems rather to have been a term of royal familiarity than of contempt. Though I doubt not that he treated the princess with no great compassion or de∣licacy; a circumstance which reslects honor on her forgiveness. See Blomesield's Norfolk, iii. 481.</NOTE>. But this sudden kindness of Philip, who thought Elisabeth a much less obnoxious character than his father Charles the fifth had conceived her
<PB N="76" REF="91"/>
to have been, did not arise from any regular principle of real generosity, but partly from an affectation of popularity<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">He affected to treat the princess with much respect. In an examination, cited by Hollingshead, it appears, that accident∣tally passing her in a chamber of the palace, he paid her such obeisance as to fall with one knee to the ground, notwithstand∣ing his usual state and solemnity. Chron. iii. 1160. col. 1.</NOTE>; and partly from a refined sentiment of policy, which made him foresee, that if Elisabeth was put to death, the next lawful heir would be Mary queen of Scots already betrothed to the dauphin of France, whose succession would for ever join the sceptres of England and France, and consequently crush the growing interests of Spain<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Camden, Eliz. per Hearne, vol. i. <HI>Apparatus,</HI> pag. 21.

<P>In her first day's journey, from the manor of Woodstock to lord Williams's at Ricot, a vio∣lent storm of wind happened; insomuch, that her hood and the attire of her head were twice or thrice blown off. On this, she begged to retire to a gentleman's house then at hand: but Bedingfield's absurd and superabundant circumspection refused even this insignificant request; and constrained her, with much in∣decorum,
<PB N="77" REF="92"/>
to replace her head-dress under a hedge near the road. The next night they came to Mr. Dormer's, at Winge, in Buck∣inghamshire; and from thence to an inn at Colnebroke, where she lay. At length she arrived at Hampton-court, where the court then resided, but was still kept in the condi∣tion of a prisoner. Here bishop Gardiner, with others of the council, frequently per∣suaded her to make a confession, and submit to the queen's mercy. Dissimulation appears to have been a conspicuous feature in Elisa∣beth's character. One night, when it was late, the princess was unexpectedly summon∣ed, and conducted by torch light to the queen's bedchamber: where she kneeled down before the queen, declaring herself to be a most faithful and true subject. She even went so far, as to request the queen to send her some catholic treatises, which might confirm her faith, and inculcate doctrines different from those which she had been taught in the writ∣ings of the reformers. The queen seemed still to suspect her sincerity: but they parted on good terms. During this critical interview, Philip had concealed himself behind the tapes∣try, that he might have seasonably interposed, to prevent the violence of the queen's passio∣nate

<P>But before I proceed further in this part of my narrative, I stop to mention a circum∣stance unnoticed by our historians: which is, that sir Thomas Pope in conjunction with others, had some concern about the person of the princess Elizabeth, even when she first retired from the court, in disgrace, to her house at Ashridge; and before her troubles commenced, occasioned by Wyat's rebellion; all which I have already related at large. When that rebellion broke out, Mary wrote to the princess then sick at Ashridge, art∣fully requesting her immediate attendance at the court. Elizabeth's governors at this time, whose names are no where particularly mentioned, waiting every day for her reco∣very,
<PB N="80" REF="95"/>
very compassionately declared it unsafe yet to remove her. And the princess herself in the mean time, signified by letter her indis∣position to the queen; begging that her journey to the court might be deferred for a few days, and protesting her abhorrence of Wyat's seditious practices. Her governors likewise, on their parts, apprehending that this tenderness towards their mistress might be interpreted in a bad sense, dispatched a letter to bishop Gardiner, lord chancellor; acquainting him with her condition, and avowing their readiness to receive the queen's commands. An original draught or copy of this letter in Sir Thomas Pope's own hand, with several corrections and interlineations by the same, is now preseved in the British Museum<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><P>Brit.

Petyt, <HI>Now in the Inner-Temple library.</HI> Strype says only, that it was written by the lady Elizabeth's governors; or, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"by those that had the care and government of her."</Q> Among the princess Elisabeth's domestics or attendants was John Astley, one of Roger Ascham's literary friends, and to whom many of his Latin letters are written. Prefixed to Ascham's very sensible English political tract on the AF∣FAIRES OF GERMANIE, and addressed to Astley, is an Eng∣lish letter, dated 1553, from Astley to Ascham, in which the latter speaks feelingly of their frequent agreeable conversations on learned subjects at Hatfield-house. Ascham was preceptor to the princess. Sir Thomas Pope, in a fragment of a letter to the president of Trinity-college Oxford, and dated Hatfield, says, that he had procured an Office in the Tower of London for <HI>Maister Asteley.</HI> Probably this is the same person. Ascham in some of his Epistles complains, that he was unjustly driven from his tuition of Elisabeth, in a consequence of a party form∣ed against him in the family of the princess. My principal reason for mentioning these particulars is to shew, that sir Tho∣mas Pope could not have been one of Ascham's enemies on this occasion; for, had that been the case, it is not very probable that he should promote Ascham's friend. He was husband of Catharine Asteley, the governess of the princess. See below, p. 99. Ascham mentions this Catharine Asteley in very re∣spectable terms, in a Letter to the princess, on the death of her tutor Grindall. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hunc dolorem, magis apud te renovando augere, quam consolando lenīre vererer, nisi perspecta esset mihi prudentia tua, sic consiliis prudentissimae Feminae do∣minae Catharinae Astleae munita, &amp;c."</Q> EPIST.

He wrote a treatise on HORSEMANSHIP, printed without his name, in 1586. 4to. By the way, it appears from what has been said, that the princess before her final settlement at Hatfield under sir Thomas Pope's care, was occasionally shifted about to various royal seats, of which Hatfield was one.</P></NOTE>: from which circumstance it is manifest that he was at this time one of these
<PB N="81" REF="96"/>

<PB N="82" REF="97"/>
is evident that he was removed from this charge, when the princess, notwithstanding her infirm state of health, was hurried up to the court by Southwell, Cornwallis, and Hastings: nor do we find, that from that time he had the least concern with her during her imprisonment in the tower and at Wood∣stock, and the rest of those undeserved per∣secutions, which preceded her enlargement and final removal to Hatfield.</P>
<P>To this lady sir Thomas Pope behaved with the utmost tenderness and respect: re∣siding with her at Hatfield, rather as an indulgent and affectionate guardian, than as an officious or rigorous governor. Although strict orders were given that the mass alone should be used in he family, yet he connived

Yet Sir John Harrington says, that his father, a protestant, was impri∣soned in the tower for twelve months, and fined one thousand pounds, for carrying a let∣ter to the princess, and expressing his good wishes for her prosperity: and that, as if the heresy of a maid of honor could do any great harm, his mother, who was one of her favo∣rite attendants, was removed from that situati∣on, as a professed heretic, by the command of bishop Gardiner<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Strype, Eccl.

<P>Nor was sir Thomas Pope wanting on pro∣per occasions, in studiously shewing her such marks of regard and deference as her station and quality demanded. This appears from the following anecdote, which also marks his character<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">See Append Numb. XV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Two of the fellows of Trinity college in Oxford, just founded by him, had violated one of it's strictest statutes, and were accordingly expelled by the president, and Society. Upon <PB N="84" REF="99"/>
this they repaired to their founder, then at Hatfield with the princess Elisabeth, humb∣ly petitioning a readmittance into his college. Sir Thomas Pope probably was not a little perplexed on this occasion; for although dis∣posed to forgiveness, yet he was unwilling to be the first who should openly countenance or pardon an infringement of laws which himself had made. But perceiving a happy opportu∣nity of adjusting the difficulty, by paying at the same time a handsome compliment to the princess, with much address he referred the matter to her gracious arbitration; and she was pleased to order, that they should imme∣diately be restored to their fellowships. In consequence of this determination, he wrote the following letter to the President of the college.<LETTER>

<P>Nor did sir Thomas Pope think it incon∣sistent with his trust, to gratify the princess on some occasions with the fashionable amuse∣ments of the times; even at his own ex∣pence, and at the hazard of offending the queen. This we learn from a passage in a curious manuscript chronicle<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">MSS. Cotton. fol. Vitellius. F. 5. Brit. Mus. MSS. Strype. See Append. Numb. XXVIII.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In Shrove∣tide, 1556, sir Thomas Pope made for the ladie Elisabeth all at his owne costes, a greate and rich maskinge in the greate halle at Hatfelde; wher the pageaunts were marvellously furnished. There were tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> twelve minstrels antickly disguised; with forty-six or more gentlemen and ladies,

many of them knights or nobles, and ladies of honor, apparelled in crimsin sattin, em∣brothered uppon with wrethes of golde and garnished with bordures of hanging perle. And the devise of a castell of clothe of gold, sett with pomegranates about the battlements, with shields of knights hang∣ing therefrom, and six knights in rich harneis turneyed.

And the next day the play of HOLOPHERNES. But the queen percase mysliked these folliries, as by her letters to sir Thomas Pope hit did appear, and so their disguisinges were ceased."</Q></P>
<P>The princess was notwithstanding some∣times suffered to make excursions, partly for pleasure, and partly for paying her compli∣ments at court: and on these occasions she was attended in a manner suitable to her rank. Strype tells us, from the same manu∣script journal of memorable occurrences, writ∣ten
<PB N="88" REF="103"/>
about those times<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Strype Eccl.

Sir Thomas Pope had the <HI>devising</HI> of this show. By way of closing the sport, or rather the ceremony, the princess was grati∣fied
<PB N="89" REF="104"/>
with the privilege of cutting the throat of a buck<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Vitell. F. 5. MSS. Cotton. MSS. Strype ut supr.</NOTE>. In the same month she was visited by the queen at Hatfield: when the great chamber was adorned with a sumptuous suit of tapestry, called the <HI>Hanginge of the siege of Antioch,</HI> and after supper a play was performed by the choir-boys of Saint Paul's<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">MSS. Ibid. See HIST. ENG. POETRY. ii. 392.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the summer of the same year, the prin∣cess paid a visit to the queen at Richmond. She went by water from Somerset-place in the queen's barge; which was richly hung with garlands of artificial flowers, and cover∣ed with a of canopy green sarcenet wrought with branches of eglantine in embroidery, and powdered with blossoms of gold. In the barge she was accompanied by sir Thomas Pope, and four ladies of her chamber. Six boats attended on this procession, filled with her highness's retinue, habited in russet da∣maske and blue embroidered sattin tasselled and spangled with silver, with bonnets of cloth of silver plumed with green feathers. She was received by the queen in a sump∣tuous pavilion, made in form of a castle, with cloth of gold and purple velvet, in the labyrinth of the gardens. The walls, or
<PB N="90" REF="105"/>
sides of the pavilion were chequered into compartments, in each of which was alter∣nately a lily in silver and a pomegranate in gold. Here they were entertained at a royal banquet; in which was introduced a <HI>sottletie</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">A curious devise in cookery or confectionary.</NOTE> of a pomegranate-tree bearing the arms of Spain. There were many minstrels, but no masking or dancing. Before the banquet, the queen was long in consultation with sir Tho∣mas Pope. In the evening the princess with all her company returned, as they came, to Somerset-place; and the next day retired to Hatfield<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">MSS. Cotton. Vitell. F. 5. MSS. Strype, ut supr.</NOTE>. During her residence at Hatfield, the princess was also present at a royal Christmas, kept with great solemnity by the queen and king Philip at Hampton-court. On Christmas-eve, the great hall of the pa∣lace was illuminated with a thousand lamps curiously disposed. The princess supped at the same table in the hall with the king and queen, next the cloth of state: and after sup∣per, and served with a perfumed napkin and plates of confects by the lord Paget. But she retired to her ladies, before the revels; masking, and disguisings began. On saint Stephen's day she heard mattins in the queen's closet adjoining to the chapel, where she was
<PB N="91" REF="106"/>
attired in a robe of white sattin, strung all over with large pearls. On the twenty ninth day of December, she sate with their ma∣jesties and the nobility at a grand spectacle of justing, when two hundred spears were broken. Half of the combatants were ac∣coutred in the Almaine, and half in the Spanish fashion<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Vitell. F. 5. Cotton. MSS. Strype, ut supr.</NOTE>. Thus our chronicler, who is fond of minute description. But these and other particularities, insignificant as they seem, which he has recorded so carefully, are a vindication of Queen Mary's character in the treatment of her sister: they prove, that the princess, during her residence at Hatfield, lived in splendor and affluence, that she was often admitted to the diversions of the court, and that her present situation was by no means a state of oppression and imprisonment, as it has been re∣presented by most of our historians.</P>
<P>We have before seen that sir Thomas Pope, during his attendance on this lady, was engaged in the foundation of his college. An undertaking of such a nature, could not fail of attracting the attention of the young Elisabeth; whose learned education and pre∣sent situation naturally interested her in the progress of a work so beneficial to the in∣crease
<PB N="92" REF="107"/>
of her favorite pursuits, and carried on by one with whom she was so nearly con∣nected. Accordingly this subject was often matter of conversation between them, as ap∣pears from part of a letter written by sir Tho∣mas Pope: which also still further proves the friendly terms on which they lived together. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The princess Elisabeth her grace, whom I serve here, often askyth me about the course I have devysed for my scollers: and that part of myne estatutes respectinge studie I have shewn to her, which she likes well. She is not only gracious, but most lerned, as ye right well know<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Dat. Hatfield, 1556. To the President. Ex Autograph. ubi supr. Ascham, in one of his Latin Epistles, gives the following interesting account of Elisabeth's progress in literature, when she was very young, under the year 1550. Among the learned daughters of Sir Thomas More, he says, the princess Elisabeth saines like a star of distinguished lustre; deriving greater glory from her virtuous disposition, and literary accomplishments, than from the dignity of her exalted birth. I was her preceptor in Latin and Greek for two years. She was but little more than sixteen, when she could speak French, and Italian, with as much fluency and propriety as her native English. She speaks Latin readily, justly, and even critically. She has often conversed with me in Greek, and with tolerable facility. When she transcribes Greek or Latin, nothing can be more beautiful than her hand-writing. She is excellently skilled in music, although not very fond of it. She has read with me all Cicero, and great part of Livy. It is chiefly from those two authors alone, that she has acquired her knowledge of the Latin langnage. She begins the day with reading a portion of the Greek testament, and then studies some select Orations of Isocrates and the tragedies of So∣phocles. From these authors, I was of opinion, that she would adorn her style with the most elegant diction, enrich her mind with the most suitable precepts, and frame her high station of life to every fortune. For her religious instruction, after the Scriptures, she adds to the classics Saint Cyprian and the Common Places of Melancthon, with other writers of that school, who teach purity of doctrine with elegance of expression. In every composition, she is very quick in pointing out a far-fetched word, or affected phrase. She cannot endure those absurd imitators of Erasmus, who mince the whole latin Language into proverbial maxims. She is much pleased with a Latin Oration naturally arising from its subject, and written both chastly and perspicu∣ously.

While sir Thomas Pope was concerned in this superintendance of the princess, he re∣ceived a letter from Heath, archbishop of York and lord chancellor, the bishops of Rochester and Ely, lord Arundel, and sir Henry Jernegan, dated July the thirtieth, 1556, by which it appears, that the privy council placed much confidence in his pene∣tration and address, and greatly depended on

<P>In consequence of Wyat's unsuccessfull at∣tempt, new efforts were made to foment a second insurrection. Many of Wyat's adhe∣rents, of which the principal was one Dudley Ashton, had fled into France where they were well entertained. Ashton being connected with both kingdoms sent over from France one Cleyberye, a condemned person, who pre∣tended to be the earl of Devonshire. The conspirators at the same time, in the letters and proclamations which they dispersed, made use of the lady Elisabeth's name, and pro∣pagated many scandalous insinuations against her reputation and honour<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Strype Eccl. mem. iii. 336.</NOTE>.

<P>In consequence of sir Thomas Pope's ex∣planation, the queen herself wrote a letter to
<PB N="96" REF="111"/>
the princess, in which she expressed her ab∣horrence and disbelief of these infamous for∣geries. It was answered by the princess, who declared her detestation of the conspi∣rators, and disclaimed the least knowledge of their malicious designs. Undoubtedly having suffered so severely, and perhaps unjustly, in the affair of Wyat, she judged it expedient to clear her character even from the most improbable suspicions. Commissioners were immediately appointed for examining into this conspiracy, sir Francis Englefield the comptroller, sir Edward Waldegrave, sir Henry Jernegan, sir Edward Hastings, and Cordall the queen's sollicitor; and several of the parties were apprehended, and condemned at Guildhall<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Strype, Eccl.

<P>Soon afterwards, Eric king of Sweden sent by his ambassador, a message secretly to the princess at Hatfield, with a proposal of marriage. King Philip had just before pro∣posed
<PB N="97" REF="112"/>
to the queen to marry her to the duke of Savoy<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Strype, Eccl. Mem., iii. 317.</NOTE>; with a view perhaps of retaining the duke who was an able general, in his interests against France, with which Philip was at this time engaged in open hostilities. This proposal of the king of Sweden she wisely rejected, because it was not conveyed to her by the queen's directions. But to this objection the embassador answered, that the king of Sweden his master, as a man of honor and a gentleman, thought it most proper to make the first application to her∣self: and that having by this preparatory step obtained her consent, he would next, as a king, mention the affair in form to her majesty. But the final answer of princess was an absolute denial: and she desired the messenger to acquaint his master, that as she could not listen to any proposals of that na∣ture, unless made by the queen's advice or authority; so she could not but declare, that if left to her own will, she would always pre∣fer a single condition of life. The affair soon came to the queen's ears; who sending for sir Thomas Pope to court, received from him an entire account of this secret transac∣tion; ordering sir Thomas at the same time to write to the princess, and acquaint her
<PB N="98" REF="113"/>
how much she was satisfied with this prudent and dutiful answer to the king of Sweden's proposition. Sir Thomas Pope very soon afterwards returned to his charge at Hatfield; when the queen commanded him, not only to repeat this approbation of the conduct of the princess relating to the proposed match from Sweden, but to receive from her own mouth the result of her sentiments concerning it; and at the same time to take an opportunity of sounding her affections concerning the duke of Savoy, without mentioning his name.

of this invitation, was formally to propose to her in person a marriage with Philibert Emanuel, the duke of Savoy, which sir Tho∣mas Pope, by the queen's commands, had before hinted at a distance, as we have seen in the preceding letter. This proposal the princess declined; but disguised her refusal with the same earnest professions of her un∣changeable devotion to a state of virginity, which she had before made to sir Thomas Pope on account of the Swedish match. Great court was paid to the princess during her abode at Somerset-house<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Carte, iii. 331.</NOTE>.

<P>One should have expected that the queen would have parted in disgust with the prin∣cess, at this rejection of a match, recom∣mended by Philip, and so convenient to his purposes. But it appears, that the queen was extremely backward in promoting her husband's desire of marrying Elisabeth to the duke of Savoy. On this account, Philip employed Alphonsus, a franciscan frier, his confessor, to confer with her majesty on the subject of this marriage. She told him, that she feared, without consent of parlia∣ment, neither her husband Philip, nor the nation would be benefited by this alliance. She added, that she could not in point of conscience press this match upon her sister;
<PB N="106" REF="121"/>
meaning perhaps that it would be unjust, to force the princess to be married, after her resolute declarations against wedlock; or im∣proper and dishonorable, to match her be∣neath the dignity of a crowned head. The theological reasonings of Alphonsus were too refined for the understanding, or too weak for the conscience, of the queen, who still remained inflexible in her former opinion. Upon this, Philip wrote to her in his usual authoritative style, advising her to examine her own conscience, and to consider whether her opinion was founded in truth or in ob∣stinacy; adding, that if the parliament op∣posed his request, he should lay the blame upon her<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Strype, Eccl. Mem. iii. 317. seq.</NOTE>. The queen, in her answer, beg∣ged that he would, at least, defer the mat∣ter till he returned into England: and that then he might have a better opportunity of judging, what attention her reasons de∣served. That otherwise, she should live in jealousy of his affections, a state of mind to her worse than death; but which, to her great disquietude, she had already began to feel. She observed, with many expressions of deference to his superior judgment and authority, that, whatever her conscience might have determined, the matter could not be
<PB N="107" REF="122"/>
possibly brought to any speedy conclusion, as the duke would be immediately ordered into the field.</P>
<P>This letter which is in French, and print∣ed by Strype<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Strype, Eccl. Mem. iii. Append. Numb. LVI.</NOTE>, is no less a specimen of her implicit submission to Philip, than the whole transaction is, at the same time, an in∣stance of that unconquerable perseverance which the queen exerted on certain occasions. Philip persisted in his design: and with a view to accomplish it more effectually, dis∣patched into England the duchess of Parma and the duchess of Lorraine, whom he com∣missioned to bring back with them the prin∣cess Elisabeth into Flanders. Philip was in love with the duchess of Lorain; and the splendor of her table and retinue, which she was unable to support of herself, made the queen extremely jealous. She was therefore, whatever her companion might have been, a very improper suitress on this occasion. The queen would not permit the two duchesses to visit the princess at Hatfield; and every moment of their stay gave her infinite uneasi∣ness. But they both soon returned, without success<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Carte, iii. 338.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="123"/>
Perhaps the growing jealousy of the queen, a passion which often ends in revenge against the beloved object, might at least have some share in dictating this opposition to Phi∣lip<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Philip, while abroad, had shewn her so many marks of indifference, and had trifled with her so frequently about his return to England, that once, in a fit of rage, she tore his pic∣ture.

At length the remonstrances of the queen, and the repeated disapprobation of the princess, prevailed; and it is certain, what∣ever Mary's real motives might be, that the proposal was suddenly laid aside. But Mary so far concurred with Philip's measures, as the next year to declare war against France<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Yet the public finances were at this time so low, that she could not procure a single vote from her privy-council for the declaration of war: and she therefore threatened to dismiss them all from the board, and to appoint counsellors more obse∣quious.

<P>As to the king of Sweden, he afterwards, in the year 1561, renewed his addresses to Elisabeth, when she was queen of England: at which time, he sent her a royal present of

At the same time, some stationers of London had published prints of her majesty Elisabeth and the king of Swe∣den in one piece. This liberty, as it was called, gave great offence to the queen, who ordered secretary Cecil to write to the lord mayor of London, enjoining him diligently to suppress all such publications; as they implied an agreement of marriage between their majesties.

<P>But she still persisted in those vows of vir∣ginity which she had formerly made to sir Thomas Pope at Hatfield; and constantly re∣fused not only this, but other advantageous

matches. One of them was with the Duke D'Alenzon, whom she refused, yet after some deliberation, because he was only a boy of seventeen years of age, and she almost in her fortieth year<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camd. ELIZ. p. 269. per Hearne.</NOTE>. A husband, I suppose, al∣though a young one, would have been at that time perhaps inconsistent with her pri∣vate attachments; and the formalities of mar∣riage might have laid a restraint on more agreeable gallantries with the earl of Essex and others, Bayle<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Dict. Artic. ELIZABETH.</NOTE> assigns a curious physical reason for Elisabeth's obstinate perseverance in a state of virginity.</P>
<P>The four last years of queen Mary's reign, which the princess Elisabeth passed at Hat∣field with sir Thomas Pope, were by far the most agreeable part of her time during that turbulent period. For although she must have been often disquieted with many secret fears and apprehensions, yet she was here per∣fectly at liberty, and treated with a regard due to her birth and expectations. In the mean time, to prevent suspicions, she pru∣dently declined interfering in any sort of business, and abandoned herself entirely to
<PB N="111" REF="126"/>
books and amusements<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Hist. Ref. ubi supr. p. 363.</NOTE>. The pleasures of solitude and retirement were now become habitual to her mind; and she principally employed herself in playing on the lute or virginals, embroidering with gold and silver, reading Greek, and translating Italian. She was now continuing to profess that character which her brother Edward gave her, when he used to call her his <HI>sweet sister Temperance</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Camd. Eliz. per Hearne, APPARAT. vol. i. p. 14.</NOTE>. But she was soon happily removed to a reign of unparalleled magnificence and prosperity.</P>
<P>Upon the accession of the new queen, who was resident at Hatfield when her sister Mary died on November the seventeenth, 1558, it does not appear that sir Thomas Pope was continued in the privy-council. This circumstance may justly be interpreted to his honor. Elisabeth, to prevent an alarm among the partisans of the catholic communion, had prudently retained thirteen of Mary's privy counsellors. These were, Heathe, archbishop of York, and lord chan∣cellor; the marquis of Winchester, lord treasurer; the earls of Arundel, Shrewsbury, Pembroke, and Derby; the lords Clinton, and Howard; sir Thomas Cheyney, sir William
<PB N="112" REF="127"/>
Petre, sir John Mason, sir Richard Sackville, and Doctor Wootton, dean of York and Canterbury<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Reformat. ii. 375.</NOTE>. But most of these had com∣plied with all the changes which were made in the national religion since the latter end of Henry's reign; and were such dexterous adepts in the fashionable art of adapting their principles to the variable complexion of the times, that they were still employed in every new revolution.</P>

<P>WE have now done with sir Thomas Pope's political character; and are entering on that most memorable circum∣stance of his life, before incidentally men∣tioned, by which he secured immortality to his name, and conferred a perpetual emolu∣ment on his country; I mean, the foundation of Trinity college in Oxford. His good sense and good disposition led him to reflect, that he could not bestow a competent pro∣portion of those riches which he had so largely received, with greater propriety, uti∣lity, and generosity, than in the service of the public. I shall therefore make no apology for delivering at large a history of his pro∣ceedings in forming and completing this li∣beral design.</P>
<P>And perhaps there are some of my readers, who will be more pleased to view him in the milder and more amiable light of the father of ingenuous education, dispensing rewards to science and virtue, than in the more active yet turbulent scenes of public life, diversified only
<PB N="114" REF="129"/>
by the vain vicissitudes of human affairs, or fraught with the crimes and misfortunes of mankind.</P>
<P>About the year 1290, Richard de Hoton, prior, and the monks, of the cathedral con∣vent of Durham, erected a college in the northern suburbs of Oxford, for the education of the novices of their monastery; to which it was considered as an appendage<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See grant in the Appendix, Numb. VI. Which, as it pro∣bably contains the first and early separation of the ground on which Trinity college now stands, with its precincts, or of the greatest part of these, to the purposes of learning, was thought too curious to be omitted among the original papers.</NOTE>. This was af∣terwards increased, with the addition of revenues and books, by Richard of Bury, bishop of Dur∣ham, in the year 1345. It was at length entire∣ly rebuilt, more effectually established, and more amply endowed, for eight benedictine monks and eight secular students, in the year 1370, by the munificence of Thomas Hatfield, bishop of the same see<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The monks were allowed annually ten pounds each, and the seculars five mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. It is remarkable, that the stipend of these monks is treble to most of the fellowships then in Oxford.</NOTE>. About the year 1541, this college was dissolved by Henry the eighth<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See Stevens's Monast. vol. i. p. 343. from MSS. A.

with the entire appurtenances of the same, were granted by the king to his new dean and chapter of Durham cathedral, which, as I presume, they now possess<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See Append.

Its site only re∣verted to the crown; for Edward the sixth, in the seventh year of his reign, by letters patent dated February the fourth, 1552<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See Append. Numb.

<P>On this ground sir Thomas Pope determined to found his intended college. Accordingly, by indenture, dated February the twentieth, 1554<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See Append. Numb.

In the same year he ob∣tained from Philip and Mary a royal licence, or charter, dated March the eigthth, 1554<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See Append. Numb.

<P>On saint Swithin's day, being the fifteenth of July, in the same year, the founder paid a visit to his college. He was accompanied by the bishops of Winchester and Ely, and other eminent personages. He dismounted from his horse at the college gate, where he was received by the president, who stood at his stirrup. At entering the gates he was sa∣luted in a long and dutiful oration by the vice-president: after which the bursars of∣fered him a present of embroidered gloves. From thence he was conducted with the rest of the company into the president's great chamber: the fellows and scholars standing on either side, as he passed along the court. Having viewed the library and Grove, they proceeded to dinner in the hall, where a sumptuous entertainment was provided. The president sate on the left hand of the founder,

There were twelve minstrels present in the hall; and among other articles of provision on this occasion, four fat does, and six gallons of <HI>Muscadel,</HI> are mentioned.

 are many marks of his attention to the affairs and economy of his college, and of his sollicitude about settling every article of the new foundation in the most effectual manner: as also of his readiness to assist on all necessary occasions. In the letter just mentioned, among several other particulars, he tells the president, in consequence of a conversation which had lately passed between them both at Tyttenhanger in Hertfordshire, by what expedient certain extraordinary ex∣pences of the college, in the late visitation<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Concerning which I find the following entries, in Comp.

<PB N="136" REF="151"/>
could not have been conferred at a more sea∣sonable time on the university. And of this sir Thomas Pope was very sensible, as we have before seen, when he substituted an ad∣ditional number of academical students in the place of a grammar-school.</P>
<P>But that it may further appear, how much these encouragements were now wanted, it will be necessry to look backwards upon the state of learning in England, particularly at Oxford; and from thence to trace its progress, and the causes of its decline, down to the times with which we are concerned. An en∣quiry not less instructive than entertaining, and naturally connected with the present subject.</P>
<P>About the close of the fifteenth century, a taste for polite letters, under the patronage of the popes, began to be revived in Italy. But these liberal pontiffs did not consider at the same time that they were undermining the pa∣pal interest, and bringing on the Reforma∣tion. This event is commonly called the Restoration of Learning; but it should rather be styled the restoration of good sense and useful knowledge. Learning there had been before, but barbarism still remained. The
<PB N="137" REF="152"/>
most acute efforts of human wit and penetra∣tion had been exerted for some centuries, in the dissertations of logicians and theologists; yet Europe still remained in a state of super∣stition and ignorance. What philosophy could not perform, was reserved to be complet∣ed by classical literature, by the poets and orators of Greece and Rome, who alone could enlarge the mind, and polish the man∣ners. Taste and propriety, and a rectitude of thinking and judging, derived from these sources, gave a new turn to the general sys∣tem of study: mankind was civilized, and re∣ligion was reformed. The effects of this happy revolution by degrees reached England.</P>
<P>We find at Oxford, in the latter end of the fifteenth century, that the university was filled with the jargon and disputes of the Scotists and Thomists; and if at that time there were any scholars of better note, these were chiefly the followers of Wicliffe, and were consequently discountenanced and persecuted. The latin style then only known in the university, was the technical language of the schoolmen, of casuists, and metaphy∣sicians. At Cambridge, about 1485, nothing was taught but Alexander's <HI>Parva Lo∣gicalia,</HI> the trite axioms of Aristotle, which were never rationally explained, and the pro∣found

questions of John Scotus<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Erasm. Epist. H. Bovillo. dat. Roffae. 1516.</NOTE>. At length some of our countrymen, the principal of which were Grocyn, Latymer, Lillye, Lina∣cer, Tunstall, Pace, and sir Thomas More, ventured to break through the narrow bounds of scholastic erudition, and went over into Italy with a design of acquiring a knowledge in the Greek and Latin languages.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Leland.

The Greek, in particular, was taught there with much perfection and purity, by many learned Greeks who had been driven from Constan∣tinople.

<PB N="140" REF="155"/>
were subsiding apace, and a national taste for critical studies and the graces of composition began to be diffused, appears from this circumstance alone; that from the year 1502, to the reformation, within the space of thirty years, there were more gram∣mar schools founded and endowed in England than had been for three hundred years be∣fore<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Knight ubi supr. p. 100.</NOTE>.

And at the same time it is to be remarked, that Fox does not appoint a philosophy-lecturer in his college, as had been the practice in most of the pre∣vious foundations; perhaps thinking, that such an institution would not have coincided
<PB N="142" REF="157"/>
with his new system of doctrine, and that it would be encouraging that species of science which had hitherto blinded mens under∣standings, and kept them so long in ignorance of more useful knowledge. The greek lectu∣rer is ordered to explain the best greek clas∣sics; and those which the judicious founder, who seems to have consulted the most capital scholars of his age, prescribes on this occasion, are the purest, and such as are most esteemed at this day.</P>
<P>These happy beginnings were seconded by the munificence of cardinal Wolsed. About the year 1519, he founded a public chair at Oxford for rhetoric and humanity; and soon afterwards another for the greek tongue: en∣dowing both with ample stipends<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Wood Hist. Antiq. univ. Oxon. i. 245, 246.</NOTE>. But these innovations in the plan of study were greatly discouraged and opposed by the scholastic bi∣gots, who called the greek language heresy. Even bishop Fox when he founded the greek lecture above-mentioned, was obliged to cover his excellent institution under the ve∣nerable mantle of the authority of the church, lest she should seem to countenance a dan∣gerous novelty. For he gives it as a rea∣son, or rather as an apology, for this new

The university of Oxford was rent into factions on account of these attempts; and the defenders of the new erudition, from disputations, often proceeded to blows with the rigid champions of the schools. But these animosities were soon pacified by the persuasion and example of Erasmus, who was about this time a student in saint Mary's college at Oxford, opposite to New-Inn<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Wood Hist. Antiq univ. Oxon. i. 237.</NOTE>. At Cambridge however, which, in imitation of Oxford, had adopted greek, Erasmus found greater difficulties. He tells us himself that at Cambridge he read the

H. Bovillo. dat. 1513. Ibid. p. 126.</NOTE>. One Henry Standish, a doctor in divinity and a mendicant frier, afterwards bishop of saint Asaph, was a vehement opponent of Erasmus in this heretical literature; calling him in a declamation, by way of reproach, <HI>Graeculus iste,</HI> which afterwards became a synonymous term for an heretic<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Knight's Life of Colet. p. 14.

<P>But neither was Oxford, and for the same reasons, entirely free from these contracted notions. In 1519, a preacher at saint Mary's church harangued with much violence against these pernicious teachers, and his arguments occasioned no small ferment among the stu∣dents.
<PB N="145" REF="160"/>
But Henry the eighth, who was luckily a patron of these improvements, being then resident at the neighbouring royal manor of Woodstock, and having received a just state of the case from Pace and More, immediately transmitted his royal mandate to the university, ordering that these studies shoud not only be permitted but encouraged<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Erasm. epist. ccclxxx. ut inf.</NOTE>. Soon afterwards one of the king's chaplains preaching at court, took an opportunity to censure the new, but genuine, interpretations of scrip∣ture which the grecian learning had intro∣duced. The king, when the sermon was ended, which he heard with a smile of con∣tempt, ordered a solemn disputation to be held, in the presence of himself; at which the preacher opposed, and sir Thomas More defended, the use and excellence of the greek tongue. The divine, instead of answering to the purpose, fell upon his knees, and beg∣ged pardon for having given any offence in the pulpit. After some little altercation, the preacher, by way of a decent submission, declared that he was now better reconciled to the greek tongue, because it was derived, from the hebrew. The king, amazed at his ignorance, dismissed him, with a charge that he should never again presume to preach

at court<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Erasm. epist. P. Mosellano. dat. 1519. ccclxxx. pag. 408. tom. iii.</NOTE>.

This was an uncommon qualification in a school∣master.</P>
<P>At length ancient absurdities universally gave way to these encouragements: and at Oxford in particular, these united efforts for establishing a new system of rational and manly learning were finally consummated in the magnificent foundation of Wolsey's college, to which all the Learned of Europe were invited.</P>
<P>But these auspicious improvements in the state of learning did not continue long. A change of the national religion soon hap∣pened,
<PB N="147" REF="162"/>
and disputes with the Lutherans en∣sued, which embroiling the minds of learn∣ed men in difference of opinion, disunited their endeavours in the cause of literature, and diverted their attention to other enquiries.</P>
<P>Many of the abuses in civil society are attended with some advantages. In the be∣ginnings of reformation, the loss of these ad∣vantages is always felt very sensibly; while the benefit resulting from the change, is the slow effect of time, and not immediately percieved or enjoyed. Scarce any institution can be imagined less favorable to the in∣terests of mankind than the monastic. Yet a great temporary check given to the progress of literature at this period, was the dis∣solution of the monasteries. For although these seminaries were in general the nurseries of illiterate indolence, and undoubtedly de∣served to be destroyed, yet the still contained invitations and opportunities to studious lei∣sure and literary pursuits. On this impor∣tant event therefore, a visible revolution and decline in the state of learning succeeded. Most of the youth of the kingdom betook themselves to mechanical or other illiberal employments, the profession of letters being now supposed to be without support and re∣ward.
<PB N="148" REF="163"/>
By the abolition of the religious houses, many towns and their adjacent vil∣lages were utterly deprived of their only means of instruction. What was taught in the monasteries was perhaps of no great im∣portance, but still it served to keep up a cer∣tain degree of necessary knowledge. Hence provincial ignorance became almost universally established.</P>
<P>Nor should we forget, that several of the abbots were persons of public spirit: by their connection with parliament, they became ac∣quainted with the world; and knowing where and how to chuse proper objects, and having no other use for the superfluity of their vast revenues, encouraged, in their respective circles, many learned young men.</P>
<P>It is generally thought, that the reformation of religion, the most happy and important event of modern times, was immediately suc∣ceeded by a flourishing state of learning. But this, in England at least, was by no means the case; and for a long time afterwards an effect quite contrary was produced. Yet, in 1535, the king's visitors ordered lectures in humanity to be founded in those societies at Oxford where they were yet wanting: and
<PB N="149" REF="164"/>
these injunctions were so warmly seconded and approved by the scholars in the largest colleges, that they seized on the venerable volumes of Duns Scotus, and other irrefrag∣able logicians, and tearing them in pieces, dispersed them in great triumph about their quadrangles, or gave them away as useless lumber<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Layton's Letter to Cromwell.

<P>In the beginning of the reign of Elisabeth, which soon followed, when protestantism might have been expected to produce a speedy change for the better, puritanism began to prevail, and for some time continued to retard the progress of ingenuous and useful know∣ledge. The English reformed clergy, who during the persecutions of queen Mary had fled into Germany, now returned in great numbers'; and in consideration of their suffer∣ings and learning, many of them were prefer∣red to eminent stations in the church. They brought back with them those narrow prin∣ciples about church-government and ceremo∣nies, which they had imbibed, and which did well enough, in the petty states and republics
<PB N="154" REF="169"/>
abroad, where they lived like a society of philosophers; but which were inconsistent with the genius of a more extended church, established in a great and magnificent nation, and requiring a settled system of policy, and the observance of external institutions. How∣ever, they were judged proper instruments to be employed at the head of ecclesiastical af∣fairs, by way of making the reformation at once effectual. But unluckily this measure, specious as it appeared at first, tended to draw the church into the contrary extreme. In the mean time their reluctance or absolute refusal to conform, in many instances, to the established ceremonies, and their speculative theology, tore the church into violent divi∣sions, and occasioned endless absurd disputes, unfavorable to the progress of real learning, and productive of an illiterate clergy, at least unskilled in liberal and manly science.</P>
<P>In fact, even the common ecclesiastical preferments had been so much diminished by the seizure and alienation of impropria∣tions, in the late depredations of the church, which were not yet ended, that few persons were regularly bred to the church, or, in other words, received a learned education. Hence almost any that offered themselves,
<PB N="155" REF="170"/>
were without distinction admitted to the sa∣cred function. Insomuch, that in 1560, an injunction was directed to the bishop of Lon∣don from his metropolitan, ordering him to forbear ordaining any more artificers, and other unlearned persons who had exercised se∣cular occupations<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Grindal. b. i. ch. 4. pag. 40.</NOTE>. But as the evil was un∣avoidable, this caution took but little effect. About the year 1563, there were only two divines, the dean of Christ Church, and the president of Magdalene college, who were capable of preaching the public sermons at Oxford<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Wood, ut supr. i. 285.</NOTE>. Many proofs have been mentioned of the extreme ignorance of our clergy at this time: to which I shall add one, which is curious and new. In 1570, Horne bishop of Winchester enjoined the Minor canons of his cathedral to get by memory, every week, one chapter of saint Paul's epistles in latin: and this task, beneath the abilities of an ordinary school-boy, was actually repeated by some of them, before the bishop, dean, and prebendaries, at a public episcopal visitation of that church<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Registr. Horne, Episcop. Winton. sol. 80. b.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The taste for latin composition, and it was fashionable both to write and speak in that
<PB N="156" REF="171"/>
language, was much worse than in the reign of Henry the eighth, when juster models were studied. One is surprized to find the learned archbishop Grindal, in the statutes of a school which he founded and amply endowed, pre∣scribing such strange classics as Palingenius, Sedulius, and Prudentius, to be taught in the new seminary<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Grindal. B. ii. ch. 17. pag. 312. This was A.D. 1583.</NOTE>. Much has been said about the passion for reading Greek which prevailed in this reign. But this affectation was confined to the queen, and a few others: and here it went no farther than ostentation and pedantry. It was by no means the na∣tional study; nor do we find that it improved the taste, or influenced the writings, of that age. But I am wandering beyond the bounds which I first prescribed to this necessary di∣gression.</P>
<P>Yet I must add an observation or two. In government, many shocks must happen before the constitution is perfected. In like manner, it was late in the reign of Elisabeth, before learning, after its sinews had been re∣laxed by frequent changes and commotions, recovered its proper tone, and rose with new vigor, under the genial influence of the
<PB N="157" REF="172"/>
protestant religion. And it may be further remarked, that, as all novelties are pursued to excess, and the most beneficial improve∣ments often introduce new inconveniencies, so this influx of polite literature destroyed philosophy. On this account, sir Henry Sa∣vile, in the reign of James the first, establish∣ed professors at Oxford for astronomy and geometry; because, as he declares in the preamble of his statutes, mathematical stu∣dies had been totally deserted, and were then almost unknown in, England<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">See Rym. Foed. xvii. 217. It is observable, that he entirely interdicted the teaching of judicial astrology to his professor of Astronomy. Statut. Savil. cap. ii. These statutes are dated Aug. 11. 1619.</NOTE>. Logic indeed remained; but that science was still cultivated, as being the basis of polemical theology, and a necessary instrument for conducting our con∣troversies against the church of Rome.</P>

On the seventh day of February, began his funeral procession to the church of saint Stephen's Wallbrook: to which he was conveyed with a standard, a Coat, a penon or banner of arms, a target, helmet, sword, and four dozen of arms, with twelve for the branches of wax tapers, and six for the body, or shrine. He was attended by two heralds at arms, Clarencieux and York. The first bore the coat, and the lat∣ter the helmet and crest. Twenty poor men

and twenty poor women, carried torches. The men were cloathed in mantle frieze gowns, and the women in<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">A sort of white veil, often mentioned as part of the mourn∣ing-dress of women, at antient funerals.

Sir Richard Southwell, and sir Thomas Stradling, knights, and diverse gen∣tlemen and others, all in black, where mour∣ners, to the number of sixty or more. All his house at Clerkenwell, and the church, were hung with black, with escotcheons of his arms. After the heralds had offered the sword, target, coat, and helmet at the high altar, and other ceremonies were performed, the company returned back to his house to a banquet, where they were refreshed with spiced bread and wine. The next day fol∣lowed his morrow mass, in the said church; at which were three Songs, two being prick∣ed songs, and the third the mass of requiem, all sung by the Clerkes of London. He was then buried; after which they went back to his house to dinner, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"being, as my manu∣script says, a very great dinner, and plenty of all thinges."</Q> Then followed a great dole of almes distributed among the Poor.</P>
<P>Stowe insinuates, that he was interred in
<PB N="176" REF="191"/>
the north ile of the choir of Wallbrook church. Here was a vault, in which before had been buried his wife Margaret, his daughter Alice, and Anne Pope his sister in law. Stowe adds the following inscription, which was evidently placed there before his death, and I suppose immediately upon the decease of dame Margaret. It was destroyed with the old church.

<P>But in 1567, eight years after his death, his body and the body of dame Margaret afore∣said, were removed from saint Stephen's Wallbrook to the chapel of Trinity college in Oxford; where they were again interred on the north side of the altar, under a state∣ly tomb of good gothic workmanship, on which are the recumbent figures of sir Tho∣mas Pope in complete armour, and of his second wife Elisabeth, large as the life, in alabaster, with this inscription.</P>

This monument was probably given by Elizabeth his second wife in her life-time. It was certainly erected after his death, viz. after 1559, as the inscription, which is wrought in large gothic characters out of the substance of the stone, minutely specifies the date of his decease. Elizabeth survived her husband more than thirty years; and, if at all, she must have erected it before 1567, when it appears to have existed. But of this I shall have occasion to bring further evidences.</P>

<P>This Lady, whom we must now call Dame Elizabeth Powlett, did not, however, from her new connection discontinue that previous and natural attachment, which, in the cha∣racter of foundress, she bore to the founda∣tion of her former husband sir Thomas Pope.

<P>But I proceed to some other particulars concerning Dame Elizabeth Powlett. In the year 1560, she placed in rich painted glass in a window of the choir, or chancell, of the church of Broadwell in Oxsordshire, an image of the Holy Trinity, with the figures
<PB N="199" REF="216"/>
of herself and Sir Thomas Pope<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Probably the reason why she did not place here the figure of her present husband Sir Hugh Powlett, rather than that of Sir Thomas Pope, was because this picture was intended as a memorial of the college to which the church belonged. In the large old mansion house at Filkins, a hamlet of Broadwell, pulled down about fifty years ago, there were on the spouts the initials E. P. for Elisabeth Powlett, and the date 1592.</NOTE>, both kneel∣ing in their heraldic surcoats of arms. But this window was removed or destroyed the following year by own her command, being censured as superstitious<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">MSS. F. Wife.</NOTE>. In the following year, she gave a great clock to the late conven∣tual church of Clerkenwell in London<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">MSS. F. Wife.</NOTE>. This was a considerable benefaction, and not unworthy to be mentioned here; as clocks, if of any size, were at that time uncommon and very expensive. In 1564, she placed a new pair of organs, with a picture of the Passion of Saint Sebastian, in the chapel of Tytten-hanger-house<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">MSS. F. Wife. This article, and the two foregoing, I believe, were communicated to Mr. Wife by the late sir Harry Pope-Blount, who seems to have had them from some family papers or memoirs.</NOTE>. In the year 1592, being desi∣rous of perpetuating her affection to her native town of Burton upon Trent in Staffordshire, by the memorial of some public benefaction, she gave an annuity of
<PB N="200" REF="217"/>
fifteen pounds issuing from her estate in Clerkenwell, and all her lands and possessions at Bentley in Derbyshire, for improving the salaries of the first and second masters of the free-school, and also for the perpetual main∣tenance of five poor women, aged and un∣married, in that town<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ex indentura, dat. 1 Feb. 35 Eliz. apud Burton praedict.

<P>Of this family of Blount there were after∣wards three eminent writers: sir Henry Blount knight, sir Thomas Pope-Blount knight, and baronet, and Charles Blount, esquire. Concerning whom a few words may not be perhaps impertinent or unaccepta∣ble. Sir Henry Blount was admitted a gentle∣man-commoner of Trinity college Oxford, in 1615<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ex Registro in 4to. apud Coll. Trin. supr. citat. I find his elder brother Thomas, admitted with him a CONVICTOR of the superior rank. ibid. Thomas quitted the college in 1615. Henry in 1619. ibid.</NOTE>, under the tuition of the learned Robert Skynner one of the fellows, after∣wards successively bishop of Bristol, Oxford, and Worcester, in the fourteenth year of his age: where, at that early period of life, he attracted the peculiar attention and esteem of the society, more from his own personal and intrinsic accomplishments, his amiable dispo∣sition, lively conversation, engaging address, genius, and taste for polite literature, than from his family connections, and his near re∣lation to the founder<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Wood, ATH. OXON. ii. 712.</NOTE>. In 1636, He pub∣lished his VOYAGE INTO THE LEVANT, which became exceedingly popular, and was
<PB N="207" REF="224"/>
frequently reprinted. But to say the truth, this little work is the voyage of a sceptic: it has more of the philosopher than the tra∣veller, and would probably never have been written, but for the purpose of insinuating his religious sentiments. Yet his reflections are so striking and original, and so artfully inter∣woven with the thread of his adventures, that they enliven, instead of embarrassing, the nar∣rative. He has the plausible art of colouring his paradoxes with the resemblance of truth. So little penetration had the orthodox court of Charles the first, that merely on the merit of this book, he was appointed one of the band of Pensioners<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">For some of his other pieces, see Wood's ATH. OXON. ii. 712. And Langbaine's DRAM. POETS, p. 327.</NOTE>. Sir Thomas Pope-Blount his eldest son was born in 1649, and was educated under his father's inspection. His CENSURA CELEBRIORUM AUTHORUM, which is a compilation of great erudition and labour, is well known to the critic and the li∣terary historian. Niceron unfortunately com∣pares the CENSURA with Baillet's JUGE∣MENT DES SAVANS<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">MEMOIRES <HI>pour servir,</HI> &amp;c. tom. xxiii. p. 399.</NOTE>. But Baillet has the vanity and injustice to report the opinions of other writers in his own words: our author has the modesty and fidelity to transcribe and
<PB N="208" REF="225"/>
to cite his authorities. His ESSAYS on vari∣ous subjects are learned and judicious, and they have the ease and freedom, without the singularity, of Montaigne. Another of his works, which has been superseded by those who have used its materials, is REMARKS ON POETRY. Of this piece it will be sufficient to say, that it was honoured with the appro∣bation of lord Mulgrave, the most elegant critic of the author's age. Charles Blount, or Pope-Blount, esquire, second son of sir Henry abovementioned, inherited his father's philosophy. From an abhorence of super∣stition, he appears to have adopted the most distant extremes of the theistic system. His ANI∣MA MUNDI, ORACLES OF REASON, LIFE OF APPOLLONIUS TYANAEUS, and DIA∣NA OF THE EPHESIANS, written with great learning, sagacity, wit, and force of reason∣ing, are the consolation of infidels, and are melancholy monuments of admirable abilities abused in the defence of a futile but danger∣ous cause<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See the MISCELLANEOUS WORKS of Charles Blount, pub∣lished by Charles Gildon in 1693. And Wood, ubi supr.</NOTE>. In conformity to these princi∣ples, he died by his own hand in 1693. Bayle has inaccurately represented the affecting story of his death<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Artic. APOLLONIUS TYANAEUS. The true story is this. Mr. Blount, on the death of his wife, fell in love with her sister, a lady of great beauty and accomplishments: she was not insensi∣ble to his attachment, but was scrupulous about the legality of marrying her sister's late husband. On his application to the most learned civilians, and the archbishop of Canterbury, he was informed, that such a match could not take place. On this, the lady positively refused her consent, and Mr. Blount in a fit of despair shot himself through the head. The wound not im∣mediately proving mortal, he lived five days: during which time, he received no fustenance or medicines but from the hands of the lady, who attended him with the most sympathetic ten∣derness till his last moments. This account I received from the late sir Harry Pope-Blount, baronet, the last of the family, and a diligent and faithful antiquary.</NOTE>.</P>

I close my account of Dame Elizabeth Powlett, and her nearer relations, with a few words concerning the antiquity and dignity of her family. Its ancestor was Le Blound lord of Guisnes in Normany, whose sons Robert and William le Blound, both entered Eng∣land with William the conqueror. William was one of the captains in that expedition, and quartered, with other Norman knights, on the monks of Ely. Robert was created by the conqueror, baron of Ixworth in Suffolk; in which county he received a grant of thir∣teen lordships. Gilbert, his son, founded an Augustine priory at Ixworth, in the reign of William Rufus, which he endowed with fourteen knights fees. One of Gilbert's de∣scendants was killed at the battle of Lewes,
<PB N="210" REF="227"/>
in the reign of Henry the third, where he was standard-bearer to Mountford earl of Leicester. In the progress of it's descent, this family numbers many persons of singular eminence and high station<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">See Peacham's COMPLEAT GENTLEMAN, edit. 1661. pag. 230. And Eng.

On the sides of the tomb in Trinity college chapel above∣mentioned, are two coats: Pope impaling Quarterings of Blount, viz.

These arms are an additional and evident proof, that Dame Elizabeth Powlett erected this monument; in decorating which, she was so studious to introduce the ensigns and ho∣nors of her own family<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">There is an old portrait of lady Powlett, in the Bursary at Trinity college, painted, as I judge from the drapery and the age of the countenance, about the middle of Q.

I have been told that this picture was painted by sir Antonio More, portrait and history painter to Philip and Mary. Several of his pictures were in the collection of king Charles the first, and at sir Philip Syden∣ham's at Brympton in Somersetshire, a family (as we have seen) nearly related to Lady Powlett. More had one hundred ducats for his common portraits. He died in 1575. I rather think this picture is a copy of an original by More.</NOTE>.<PB N="211" REF="228"/></P>

<P>IT may be necessary to speak of sir Tho∣mas Pope's friends, and of those with whom he seems to have maintained any par∣ticular intimacy, connection, or intercourse: notwithstanding most of their names have before occurred incidentally. These were sir Thomas More, lord Audley, sir Richard Southwell, sir Thomas Stradling, sir Nicho∣las Bacon, sir Thomas Cornewallys, sir Fran∣cis Englefield, sir Robert Southwell, sir Ed∣ward Waldegrave, William Cordall, esquire, Richard Gooderick, John Wyseman, sir Ar∣thur Darcy, sir Gilbert Gerrard, lord Vaulx, sir Thomas Brydges, cardinal Pole, Thirlby bishop of Ely, sir Thomas Whyte, lord Wil∣liams of Thame, Whyte bishop of Winches∣ter, and Thomas Slythurste, president of Tri∣nity college so often mentioned.</P>
<P>I need not repeat his last interview with sir THOMAS MORE: of whom it will be sufficient to add here, that he was the great∣est ornament of the English nation at the res∣toration of polite literature; that he was a

THOMAS lord AUDLEY, made lord high chancellor of England on sir Thomas More's resignation in 1533, was probably sir Thomas Pope's parti∣cular patron, and perhaps not a little instru∣mental towards his rise in the world, as has been already hinted. In how great confidence and esteem sir Thomas was held by lord Aud∣ley, is further manifested, from his being ap∣pointed, with sir Edward North, and two others, an executor of lord Audley's will<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Registr.

In 1539, many severe acts were made, in which those styled the six bloody articles were included; and the pre∣rogative was carried to such an enormous height, that the king's proclamation was al∣lowed to attain the force of a law. It does not very plainly appear who were his majesty's principal counsellors in this affair: but we are assured, by concurrent and undoubted authorities, that the rigorous execution of those laws which the king had at first in∣tended, was prevented by the spirited inter∣position of lord Audley<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See BIOGRAPH.

speaks of procuring a prebend for one Hey∣wood, and adds, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"my lord cardinalls Grace and my lord of Elie [Thirlby] are both willing."</Q> In another letter to the same, dated 1557, he says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Towching Mr. Hey∣wood's recompens, I wold be glad to un∣derstonde what he wold have; and therup∣pon wold make my sute to my lord cardi∣nall's Grace, and my lord of Elie, accord∣inglie<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">This Mr. Heywood was <HI>Richard Hayward,</HI> rector of Gar∣sington, in Oxfordshire, to which he was presented by the crown about August, 1556.

Instead of imbruing his hands in the blood of martyrs, and loading the consciences of mankind with arbitrary decrees and unna∣tural edicts, he corresponded with learned men, and introduced into England the pure and useful elegancies of classical composition<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">I have before referred the reader to Wood's HISTORY and ANTIQUITIES of the university of Oxford, for an account of Pole's visitation of the university. I will here add an anecdote relating to that transaction not mentioned by Wood. The car∣dinal finding saint Mary's college, (where Erasmus had studied, but which had been dissolved as a seminary for various mona∣steries of augustine canons,) although very ruinous, a place which might be made convenient for the reception of students, ordered it to be repaired and fitted up for that purpose, Sept. 17. 1556. Accordingly, a principal was appointed to it: yet on condition, that he should resign his office, in case the cardi∣nal should ever be disposed to convert the said college into a house of religious. The principal's name was Alexander El∣cocke, A.M. But John Wayte <HI>lord of the soil</HI> of the said col∣lege refused entry to the new principal into the premisses, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ut paret cubicula studiosis."</Q> Registr. Cur. Cancell. Oxon. GG. fol. 63. in Archiv. Univ. Oxon. I know not what was the immediate consequence of this proceeding: but it is certain that neither of the cardinal's schemes took effect. Erasmus in some of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Epistles speaks feelingly of the repose which he enjoyed, and the felicity with which he prosecuted his studies, for two years, in this retired house. The chapel, no inelegant fabric, containing the curious monuments of the founder Tho∣mas Holden and his wife, together with the cloister, was not completely demolished till the year 1656. Nothing now re∣mains but a part of the gatehouse, which fronts westward.</NOTE>.
<PB N="236" REF="253"/>
Sir Thomas Pope submitted to the cardi∣nal the statutes of his college, as appears from a letter to the President: which, while it pays a compliment to the cardinal's taste, likewise illustrates what has been before ob∣served about the state of literature at this pe∣riod. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My lord cardinall's grace has had the overseeinge of my statutes.

sir Thomas Pope was connected with THIRL∣BY, bishop of Ely<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">See also Append. Numb. xix.</NOTE>. He was constituted the first, and only bishop of Westminster by Henry the eighth<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Ref. <HI>Records.</HI> i. 246.</NOTE>. He was, by Edward the sixth, translated to Norwich, and after∣wards by queen Mary to Ely; by whom he was also appointed a privy counsellor<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Goodwyn, ut supr. p. 333.</NOTE>, and joined in commission with sir Thomas Pope and others for the suppression of heretics<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">See supr. p. 52.</NOTE>. By all these princes he was much esteemed for his experience in political affairs, and fre∣quently employed as an envoy to foreign courts. In the reign of Elizabeth he was ejected and imprisoned for persevering in po∣pery; but was afterwards received into the family of archbishop Parker, who, not more on account of his former dignity, than of his learning, candor, and affability, treated him with due respect and humanity<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Goodwyn, ubi supr.</NOTE>. WHYTE, bishop of Winchester, became the first visitor of Trinity college in Oxford. It is reasonable to suppose, that sir Thomas Pope's real motive for appointing the bishops of Winchester to be visitors of his college,
<PB N="238" REF="255"/>
originated from Gardiner, who was the bishop of Winchester when the foundation was pro∣jected; and who, moreover, had been gover∣nor of a college at Cambridge; was now chancellor of that university, a learned civi∣lian, a scholar of the first rank, an eminent patron of literature<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Gardiner's literary character has been commonly overlooked in his political, and is rarely regarded or acknowledged. He was admirably skilled in the Greek language, at a time when it was cultivated in England only by a few neglected scholars. His ideas of pure Latinity were refined to a fault; and he car∣ried his notions of the chaste Roman phraseology to such a nicety, as to be esteemed a Ciceronian by his cotemporaries. Leland, the most polite classical writer in England at that pe∣riod, congratulates some of his elegant friends, on their being educated in the college over which Gardiner presided at Cam∣bridge; and which, under such a governor, had become the seat of eloquence and of the choir of the Muses. Leland also characterises Gardiner by the epithet DISERTUS, or the master of genuine Latinity; and calls him the restorer of classical composition, and the study of philology, at Cambridge. EX∣COM. p. 100. edit. 1589. Leland paid these compliments before Gardiner was a bishop, and when there were no tempta∣tions to flattery. Many of Ascham's terse Latin epistles are ad∣dressed to this prelate: in which, his distinguished learning, his sollicitude for the revival of ancient letters, and his general pa∣tronage, are repeatedly displayed in the highest yet unaffected terms of panegyric. In one of these, Ascham expresses his great satisfaction, that Gardiner, who excells all others in cri∣tical discernment, had so warmly approved his TOXOPHILUS, then just published, and written with a view to teach a just English style; and desires that the bishop, <HI>pro eo amore quo lite∣ras et earum cultores unice amplecteris,</HI> would recommend that book to the king. Lib. ii. p. 85. b. edit. 1581. In another, he thanks the bishop for honouring him with so many marks of notice and attention, when he came, an unknown and obscure academic, to court. He recommends a tutor to the duke of Norfolk's nephew; and wishes that Gardiner, who is so emi∣nent a judge and protector of literary merit, would ratify the choice. Ibid. p. 92. a. In a third, lamenting the untimely death of king Edward the sixth, he petitions Gardiner among other requests, to intercede with queen Mary, for the continu∣ance of his pension originally granted by king Henry the eighth, as a reward for his TOXOPHILUS: professing his confi∣dence in the bishop's known erudition, authority, liberality, prudence, and activity, to quiet the distractions which not only the civil but literary state of the kingdom would probably suffer, from that unexpected and calamitous event. Ibid. p. 154. b. Dat. 1553. In the next, he presents the bishop, then just re∣leased from imprisonment in the TOWER at the accession of Mary, with a Greek TRANSLATION of the PSALMS, probably the METAPHRASE of APOLLINARIUS: enforcing the propriety of his present by observing, that it was written in a language in which the bishop so much delighted, and that poetry had been his chief amusement during the tedious hours of his late confinement. Ibid. p. 157. b. See also, p. 65. a. With the next, dated 1554, as a slender remembrance of the numerous favors he had recently received, he sends the bishop an antient golden Roman coin. Ibid. p. 163. a. In three or four others, evidently written during the reign of Mary, he complains of many unjust taxations and oppressive exactions, imposed by some late innovators on the university of Cambridge; supplicating the assistance of Gardiner as their CHANCELLOR, and expatiating largely on his accustomed indefatigable endeavours to support the rights and promote the honour of the university. Ibid. p. 194. b. seq. In another letter, to one of Margaret Roper's learned daughters, dated 1554, Ascham speaks of being called from Cambridge by the special favour and appointment of bishop Gardiner, to serve the queen in the very liberal office of Latin secretary. Ibid. p. 162. b. In a letter to the learned Sturmius, dated at Greenwich 1555, he declares, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I would not exchange the Office of Latin Secretary for any situation in life. Bishop Gardiner has treated me with the greatest kindness and indulgence in this affair: and I can hardly say, whether Lord Pagett has shewn more readiness in naming me to the queen, or the bishop in pleading my cause and recom∣mending my character. There are some who have endeavour∣ed to stop the course of the bishop's benevolence, on account of my religious principles, but without effect. I therefore am deeply indebted to his humanity, and it is a debt which I willingly owe. I am indeed but one among many who have experienced his generosity. I have often thought of talking to him about your noble work of the ANALYTICS. For I well know his predilection to polite letters, and think his patronage would be of service on this occasion, &amp;c."</Q> Ibid. p. 45. b. seq. It appears also, that Gardiner procured from queen Mary for Ascham, a renewal of the royal pension for his TOXOPHILUS, with the annual addition of ten pounds. IBID. ibid. p. 45. b. And Grant's VITA, p. 21. Ascham's LATIN. EPIST. edit. Oxon 1703. By the same interest, Ascham was suffered to keep his fellowship and public orator's place at Cambridge, during a long absence from the university, while he was Latin secretary and abroad in Germany. Ibid. p. 22. Nor was Ascham the only learned protestant whom Gardiner countenanced in the reign of queen Mary. Throughout the persecutions of that unhappy period, he permitted Sir Thomas Smith, one of the restorers of Greek, and secretary of state in the reign of Edward the sixth, to enjoy the comforts of a studious retirement with a pension of one hundred pounds. Strype's SMITH, p 60. seq. I forbear to enlarge on Gardiner's high celebrity as a civilian and canonist: and shall only add on that head, that Henry the eighth would take no step in the business of his di∣vorce, however eager for a decision, till Gardiner could be con∣sulted, who was absent at Rome.

In the warden's lodgings at Winchester, there was lately a bedchamber, with a curious old pannelled cieling; having in each compartment a cypher of the initials of Whyte's name, and of king Henry viii.

Of sir Thomas Pope's intimacy with sir THOMAS WHYTE, the founder of saint John's college in Oxford, I have before mentioned proofs<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See supr. p. 124.</NOTE>. And to these evidences we may add, that their inter∣ests and attachments tended the same way: for we find sir Thomas Whyte affording sig∣nal services to queen Mary against the rebel Wyat and his followers, while lord mayor of London<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hollinshed, Chron. iii. 1096.</NOTE>; in consequence of which, he was knighted by the queen<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">MSS. Rawlins. Bibl. Bodl.</NOTE>. But a similitude of un∣dertakings for the propagation of letters might otherwise have naturally produced a friendship between sir Thomas Whyte and sir Tho∣mas Pope; as they were both, at the same
<PB N="245" REF="262"/>
time, employed in the same acts of public and literary beneficence. Lord WILLIAMS of THAME generously concurred with sir Thomas Pope in treating the princess Eliza∣beth, amidst her unmerited and oppressive persecutions, with proper regard<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">See supr. p. 71.</NOTE>. He is mentioned in a letter of sir Thomas Pope to the president of Trinity college<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">It is without date. Lord Williams is mentioned in another of his letters concerning a purchase.</NOTE>: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I wold be glad to lerne whether my lord Williams and Mr. Ashfeld<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Probably sir Edmund Ashfield of Tame co. Oxon.</NOTE>, gave the ii Buckes to my college at the [act] commensement."</Q> Lord Williams having enjoyed many eminent favors from Henry the eighth, and Edward the sixth, was by queen Mary created a baron in reward for his faithful services at her ac∣cession. He continued to receive fresh ho∣nors from queen Elizabeth, and was ap∣pointed president of the council in the prin∣cipality of Wales<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Dugd. Bar. ii. 393.</NOTE>. Bishop Ridley, when bound to the stake, requested lord Williams then present, to sollicit queen Mary, that the episcopal leases which he had granted, while bishop of London, to many poor tenants, might remain and be confirmed. This was
<PB N="246" REF="263"/>
the sole anxiety that disquieted the compo∣sure of the dying martyr. But lord Williams promised to recommend this petition to the utmost of his power, and it was accordingly performed<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Fuller's Worthies, p. 109. Fox, Martyrolog.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is natural to suppose, that sir Thomas Pope was nearly connected with several other persons of eminence and distinction in the courts of Henry the eighth and queen Mary. That he was in high confidence and esteem with the latter, may, beside many other ar∣guments, be concluded from a passage in the statutes of his college: by which it appears, that he expected her majesty, who professed herself so zealous a patroness to the univer∣sity, together with king Philip, would ho∣nor the college with a royal visit<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Statut. coll. Trin. Oxon. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nisi quando forsan Angliae Reges et Reginae, eorumve primogeniti, Collegium invisere dignabuntur: quos sic quidem advenientes, cum omni honore et obsequio excipiendos praecipio et statuo."</Q> cap. xxvi.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But among his friends I must not forget to mention THOMAS SLYTHURSTE<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">See more of him in Append. Numb. XXV.</NOTE>, whom he appointed the first President of his col∣lege; and had before probably preferred, by
<PB N="247" REF="264"/>
his interest with the queen, to a canonry of Windsor. He seems to have conceived a high opinion of Slythurste's learning and pru∣dence; whom, from the trust committed to his charge, we reasonably may imagine to have been a person of distinguished worth and abilities. In a general Address to the new society, annexed to the statutes of the college, he particularly compliments the pre∣sident for his remarkable moderation of tem∣per, his eminent learning, experience, pru∣dence, and probity; observing moreover, in justification of his choice, that he should have acted in vain, if he had not added to the benefit of his foundation such a governor, so properly qualified in every requisite accom∣plishment; one completely fitted for the dif∣ficult and critical task of conducting the first beginnings of a recent institution, and to whom therefore, borrowing the character of a father in that of a founder, he with plea∣sure entrusted the education of his children. On various occasions, sir Thomas Pope ap∣pears to have placed the greatest confidence in his friendship, advice, and judgement. Many of the founder's letters to Slythurste contain free consultations about adjusting the
<PB N="248" REF="265"/>
endowment, amending the statutes<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">In the first copy of the statutes, dated 1556, signed by the founder, are several erasures and interlineations in the hand of Slythurste, made by the consent and authority of the founder: and the text of this copy thus corrected, is that which is now in use. Many of these alterations appear to have been made in this book, between them both at Tyttenhanger, or Clerken∣well, as I collect from a letter from the founder to the vice-president, dat. 28. Jan. 1557, in which he says, that he shall send by the president, an altered and improved copy of his statutes, which he had ordered to be forthwith ingrossed in parchment. In another letter to the president, dat. 25. Feb. 1557, the founder tells him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I trust ye will not forget to make an INDEX CAPITULORUM STATUTORUM, which we forgott when we were together."</Q> In this copy, corrected by Slythurste's hand, <HI>London,</HI> the place from which they were origi∣nally dated, is struck out for TYTTENHANGER. The <HI>altered and improved copy,</HI> mentioned above, ingrossed on parchment, and signed with his own hand throughout, with the ADDITA∣MENT annexed, appears to have been delivered to the society, but with the original date of 1556 preserved, in, or soon after, April, 1558. See his letter, Append. Numb. XXV. Under JOHN PERTE.</NOTE>, and re∣gulating other articles of his young society; and sometimes relate to the domestic con∣cerns of his own family. I find him fre∣quently visiting the founder at Clerkenwell and Tyttenhanger. The sudden revolution, however, of religion, at the accession of queen Elizabeth, prevents us from knowing much more of his chaaracter and behaviour in this situation: for in September, 1559, he
<PB N="249" REF="266"/>
was ejected from his headship by the Queen's visitors, and committed a prisoner to the Tower of London; where he died of grief, 1560, partly for the death of his honored friend and munificent patron the founder, and partly for the loss of his preferments.</P>

<P>AN anecdote equally ridiculous and scan∣dalous, has been propagated by Antony Wood, highly injurious to the honor of sir THOMAS POPE; which, notwithstanding it appears at first sight strongly to confute itself, I shall here examine and disprove<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Although possessed of the proper information and evidence, I had long ago, and for many reasons resolved, never to enter into a particular discussion of this idle calumny. But as, since the appearance of my first edition of this work, it has been circulated both in conversation, and by more biographers than one, as a pleasant ancedote, I could no longer forbear using the means in my power of exposing its falsity and futility.</NOTE> It origi∣nated from Henry Cuffe, the famous secretary of the unfortunate earl of Essex, who was executed, soon after his master, in 1601.</P>
<P>Cuffe, being a boy of the most promising abilities and uncommon proficiency in litera∣ture, was sent at fifteen years of age, by Lady Elizabeth Powlett, often mentioned above, from Hinton saint George in Somersetshire, to Trinity college in Oxford, where he was elected scholar on the twentyfifth of May,
<PB N="251" REF="268"/>
1578<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">REGISTR. PRIM. fol. 37. b.</NOTE>. Within five years he was admitted fellow, May 30, 1583<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. fol. 42.</NOTE>. But even in this situation, the same discontented and arro∣gant spirit, which afterwards hurried him to an ignominious end, could not be suppressed. Soon after his admission, when he was now not more than twenty years of age, and in the year of his probation, he endeavoured to defame his founder by a false insinuation, which savored alike of petulance and ingrati∣tude; and which, had it been true, deserved animadversion. The matter being reported to Lady Powlett the foundress, she transmitted a mandate to the college, ordering him to be instantly removed from his fellowship. This we learn from the words of the college regis∣ter. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Resignante</HI> CUFFO, <HI>et locum Litteris Fundatricis dante</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. fol. 42. b.</NOTE>."</Q> The cause of his amo∣tion is twice mentioned by the Oxford anti∣quary. In the ATHENAE he says, that Cuffe <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was forced to resign his fellowship of Tri∣nity college, for speaking certain matters though true, which redounded to the <HI>great discredit</HI> of the FOUNDER<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">ATHEN. OXON. vol. i. col. 307. edit. 2.</NOTE>."</Q> In another place, however, he tells the whole story with∣out
<PB N="252" REF="269"/>
reserve, and produces his authority. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Doctor Bathurst told me that our Cuffe was of Trinity college, and expelled from thence upon this account: the founder, sir Thomas Pope, would, whersoever he he went visiting his friend, <HI>steal</HI> one thing or other he could lay his hands on, put it in his pocket, or under his gown. This was supposed rather an <HI>humour</HI> than of <HI>dishonesty.</HI> Now Cuffe, upon a time, with his fellows being merry, said, a pox this is a poor beggarly college indeed, the plate that our founder stole would build such another, which coming to the Pre∣sident's ears, he was thereupon ejected<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See Hearne's LIB. NIG. SCAC. p. 593.</NOTE>."</Q> The reader must have already noticed the glaring inconsistency of these two curious narratives. In the first, sir Thomas Pope, is by implication at least, represented as a thief: in the next, his dishonesty is softened into humour and jocularity. That the whole is a misrepresentation, and a jumble of cir∣cumstances, appears from an original paper in the hand-writing of Doctor Bathurst. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Secretary Cuffe was expelled from a fel∣lowship of Trinity college, on this ac∣count. Our founder, when upon a visit, would often carry away a silver cup under
<PB N="253" REF="270"/>
his gown for the joke-sake, sending it back the next day to laugh at his friend. Cuffe being merry at ANOTHER COLLEGE with some of his boon companions, said, <HI>A pox this is a beggarlie college indeed, the plate that our founder stole would build another as good.</HI> These words being told to the President, he was ejected. This I have often heard from my predecessour doctor president Kettell who was contemporarie with Cuffe<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">BATHURST PAPERS, MSS. In the possession of the late Mr. Payne, canon of Wells.</NOTE>."</Q> In the margin, Bathurst has recorded the name of the other college, which Cuffe was pleased to treat in such terms of contempt, and which needs not here to be mentioned. Indeed, it was no part of the accusation against Cuffe, that, as Wood's context insinuates, his pleasantry led him to depreciate the buildings of his founder: but that he wantonly converted one of his practi∣cal jokes, a species of humour not uncommon among our festive ancestors, into a petty larceny. On the whole, we now perceive that Wood has inaccurately related this story from a casual conversation with Bathurst, which he remembered as imperfectly. As to Cuffe, I know not whether he still con∣tinued at Oxford after this ejection. But
<PB N="254" REF="271"/>
having great address, and much real merit, about three years afterwards, that is in the year 1586, he was chosen fellow of Merton college. Being an admirable Grecian, he was about the same time made professor of Greek in the university. It was in this de∣partment, that he assisted Columbanius in the first edition of Longus's elegant PASTORAL ROMANCE, which was printed at Florence in 1598<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">COLL. MSS. T. Hearne, vol. xiii. p. 236. Columbanius says in the Dedication, p. ii. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Qua in re operam mihi suam, non ingratam iliam quidem, navarunt viri omnium literatissi∣mi atque officiosissimi Herricus CUFFUS Anglus, &amp;c."</Q></NOTE>. He was no less eminent as a logician and a disputant. His intimate friend Camden, to whose BRITANNIA, at its first appearance, he prefixed an excellent Greek epigram, characterizes Cuffe, as a man of exquisite learning and genius, but of a fac∣tious and perverse temper<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Camd. ELIZ. p. 869. edit. Hearn.</NOTE>. Notwithstand∣ing the severe check he received at Trinity college, he generously presented to the library there several volumes. Perhaps some readers will be candid enough to think, that his ex∣pulsion from this society was rather owing to an unguarded vivacity of disposition, than to any malignity of mind. Our historians say, that the earl of Essex, who began, after a
<PB N="255" REF="272"/>
tedious confinement, to feel the dangers of his situation, dismissed Cuffe from his ser∣vice and family, for turbulence and inso∣lence<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Camden, ubi supr. p. 827. 833.</NOTE>. Essex was unfortunate in not having before perceived these qualities, in a man who shared so much of his confidence.</P>
</DIV1>

<HEAD>SECT. IX.</HEAD>
<P>FROM a recapitulation of what has been said, the following character of sir THO∣MAS POPE arises. He appears to have been a man eminently qualified for business; and al∣though not employed in the very principal departments of state, he possessed peculiar talents and address for the management and execution of public affairs. His natural abi∣lities were strong, his knowledge of the world deep and extensive, his judgment solid and discerning. His circumspection and prudence in the conduct of negociations entrusted to his charge, were equalled by his fidelity and perseverance. He is a conspicuous instance of one, not bred to the church, who without the advantages of birth and patrimony, by the force of understanding and industry, raised himself to opulence and honorable employments. He lived in an age when the peculiar circumstances of the times afforded obvious temptations to the most abject de∣sertion of principle: and few periods of our history can be found, which exhibit more numerous examples of occasional compliance
<PB N="257" REF="274"/>
with frequent changes. Yet he remained unbiassed and uncorrupted amid the general depravity. Under Henry the eighth, when on the dissolution of the monasteries, he was enabled by the opportunities of his situa∣tion to enrich himself with their revenues by fraudulent or oppressive practices, he behaved with disinterested integrity; nor does a single instance occur upon record which impeaches his honor. In the succeeding reign of Ed∣ward the sixth, a sudden check was given to his career of popularity and prosperity: he retained his original attachment to the catholic religion; and on that account, lost those marks of favor or distinction which were so liberally dispensed to the sycophants of Somerset, and which he might have easily secured by a temporary submission to the reigning system. At the accession of Mary, he was restored to favor; yet he was never instrumental or active in the tyrannies of that queen which disgrace our annals. He was armed with discretionary powers for the suppression of heretical innovations; yet he forbore to gratify the arbitrary demands of his bigotted mistress to their utmost extent, nor would he participate in forwarding the barbarities of her bloody persecutions. In the guardianship of the princess Elizabeth,
<PB N="258" REF="275"/>
the unhappy victim of united superstition, jealousy, revenge and cruelty, his humanity prevailed over his interest; and he less re∣garded the displeasure of the vigilant and unforgiving queen, than the claims of injur∣ed innocence. If it be his crime to have ac∣cumulated riches, let it be remembered, that he consecrated a part of those riches, not amid the terrors of a death-bed, nor in the dreams of old age, but in the prime of life, and the vigour of understanding, to the pub∣lic service of his country; that he gave them to future generations, for the perpetual sup∣port of literature and religion.</P>

Part of it was rented by Bernard College, now saint John's. Bernard college was dissolved by Henry the eighth, who gave the said college and its appurtenances, together with a part, called <HI>half,</HI> of Durham college grove, to his new cathedral of Christ church, 1545. This part, or <HI>half,</HI> I presume, was <HI>that</HI> which had been rented, as above, by Bernard college, and was therefore considered, at the time of this donation, as its usual appendage. In the year 1555. sir Thomas Whyte, pur∣chasing from Christ-church the said Bernard college, purchased likewise of the same, the part or <HI>half</HI> of Durham college grove above-mentioned. This part, or <HI>half,</HI> is what now makes the outer grove, and perhaps much more, of saint John's college. See Wood, Hist. Ant. ii. 252.—Stevens, Monast. ii. 53. Wood, MSS. Mus. Ashm. 8513.—And especially, Numb. VII. Append. Thus the outlet, or <HI>grove,</HI> in the text, included only what re∣mained to Durham college after the aforesaid aliena ion made by Henry the eighth. When Trinity college and saint John's were founded, the two founders jointly erected the stone wall which now separates the groves, or gardens, of the two col∣leges. That this was done by agreement between them both, I collect from the words of a letter from sir Thomas Pope, to the president, dat. Jul. xxiv. 1557, in which, he desires the presi∣dent to bespeak for him, a certain large quantity of stone, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for so much I think I shall occupie <HI>for my part</HI> of Mr. [sir Tho∣mas] White's wall."</Q> Afterwards, sir T. Pope surrounded the whole grove of Trinity college with a stone-wall: and I find ex∣pended thereon cxx,<HI>l.</HI> The stone was purchased of William Freere of Oxford, who, with Agnes his wife, got possession of the houses called Dominican and Franciscan Friers at Oxford, soon after their dissolution, and demolishing the buildings fold the materials. See LIFE, p. 125. And Wood, Hist. Antiq. Univ. Oxon. lib. i. pag. 66. col. 2. William's elder brother Edward was afterwards settled at Water-Eaton near Oxford. Arms in the windows of the house of Mr. Freer, at Oxford, are described by Lee, 1575. ARMS, &amp;c. Mus. Ashmol. MSS. Codd. A. Wood. D. 14.</NOTE>:

<P>On the whole it appears, that <HI>Simon,</HI> fellow of Magdalene college, mentioned in this instrument, who married <HI>Elisabeth Love,</HI> was the person whose name occurs in papers and accounts (See LIFE, 183.) at the foundation of Trinity college, and who was the founder's agent.</P>
<P>The manor of Northleigh aforesaid, being parcel of Nettley abbey in Hampshire, was granted to sir Thomas Pope and his heirs in the year 1545, by patent of Henry the eighth, anno regn. 36. Jul. 28. par. 8. From him it descended to his widow dame Elisabeth. Late in the reign of queen Elisabeth, it ap∣pears to have been vested in the descendants of Robert Parrot, or rather Perrot, abovementioned; whose son Simon, as we have seen, married Elisabeth Love, sir Thomas Pope's niece. Wood [Ath. Oxon. i. Fast. 23. ut supr.] is mistaken in saying, that the said Robert, the founder of this family in Oxfordshire, was the second son of George Perrot of Haroldston near Haver∣ford west in Pembrokshire. It is proved from better authority, that he was born at Hacknes in the North riding of Yorkshire. MS. REGISTR. PARROT, ut supr. fol. 111. b. The family of Perrot lived at Northleigh, in their antient capital mansion house, till within these few years: but are now extinct, at least in the lineal succession. This estate was lately purchased by the duke of Marlborough.</P></NOTE>. [1558.—9]<PB N="365" REF="385"/>

<P>{inverted ⁂} When this person was removed from his fel∣lowship, the founder intended, partly on the recom∣mendation of cardinal Pole, to place in his room the learned William Alan, a name equally celebrated among the catholics, and proscribed by the protes∣tants. But that design did not take effect: he being promoted about the same time, and probably by the interest of sir Thomas Pope, to a canonry in the cathedral of York<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">MSS. F. Wise, ut supr.</NOTE>. Alan was an able controver∣sialist in defence of the declining doctrines of the church of Rome: educated at Oriel college, and about the year 1556, appointed Principal of saint Mary's HALL, and elected one of the proctors of the university of Oxford. Upon the accession of queen Elisabeth, he retired to Louvain, where he wrote his famous book on PURGATORY and PRAYERS FOR THE DEAD, which abounds in rhetoric more than argument, and contains much ingenious decla∣mation and sophistry. Soon afterwards he returned to England, where he published many specious apo∣logies for his religion, which he dispersed with great art and industry. But the treatise just men∣tioned
<PB N="407" REF="429"/>
was the basis of his polemical reputation. As he wrote chiefly for the conviction of his coun∣trymen, most of his compositions are in English; and are not inelegant specimens of style, at a time when the state of our language was rude and un∣settled. A solid old English critic pronounces one of Alan's tracts to be <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a princely, grave, and flourishing piece of natural and exquisite Eng∣lish<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Bolton's HYPERCRIT. iv. §. 2.</NOTE>."</Q> Being again driven abroad, he was re∣warded with a canonry in each of the churches of Cambray and Rheims. At length standing high in the esteem of pope Sixtus the fifth, he was consti∣tuted a Cardinal, and archbishop of Mechlin in Brabant<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Wood, ATH. Oxon. i. 268.

It is not the least of his dignities, and it is a proof of the universality of his literature, that he was librarian of the Vatican<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Miraeus, SCRIPT. SAEC. xvi. p. 68.</NOTE>.

He was a principal instrument in establishing the English catholic seminaries at Doway and Rheims, and several others in Spain and Italy. His intem∣perate papistic zeal, which he imprudently carried into the dangerous politics of the times, and which prompted him to circulate seditious papers in Eng∣land to prepare the way for the Spanish invasion, was censured even by those of his own intolerant persuasion.

After five years, intend∣ing to study the civil law, he left Trinity college, and retired to Gloucester-hall; chiefly for the conversation of the learned Thomas Allen, mentioned in this article.

Bodl. 198. The history of this venerable volume is curious, and deserves to be developed at large. It is beautifully written on vellum in folio; and ori∣ginally belonged to Robert Grosthead bishop of Lincoln in the thirteenth century, in whose hand are many notes in the mar∣gins. Grosthead gave it to the convent of Friars Minors at Oxford. These Friars gave it to the famous theologist Thomas Gascoigne, under their seal, about the year 1433. Gascoigne presented it to Durham college at Oxford, and at length Allen placed it in the Bodleian library. At the end of this manuscript there is a long note written by Gascoigne, which Tanner has printed, Bibl. p. 311. All the books belonging to the library of Richard de Bury in Durham college, were dis∣persed soon after the dissolution of that house. Some were re∣moved to the Humfredian library, and others to Baliol college; but the greater part became the property of Doctor Owen, to whom Durham college was granted. Archbishop Parker pro∣cured many Saxon manuscripts of Doctor Owen. In the Cotton library, there is a volume consisting of a collection of charters, and other antient writings, transcribed by Jocelyn, Parker's chaplain: who has inserted this note at many of the pieces. <HI>The archbishop of Canterbury had this charter from Dr. Owen.</HI> At some others, <HI>The copy of this Dr. Tallot had of Dr. Owen.</HI> VI∣TELL. D. 7. Robert Talbot, the annotator on Antoninus, was employed by the archbishop to collect antient manuscripts, chiefly Saxon. Many of Parker's books, now in Bennet college library at Cambridge, appear to have belonged to Talbot. The archbishop's principal collector was Bateman, another of his chaplains; who says, that he <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"gathered within four years, under his graces commission, six thousand seven hundred books."</Q> Bateman's DOOM <HI>warning all men to judgment, &amp;c.</HI> Lond. 1581. 4to. pag. 400. It should not be forgotten here, that Thomas Langley bishop of Durham, by will dated Dec. 17. 1437, gave a large legacy of books to the library of Dur∣ham college. Wharton ANGL. SACR. i. p. 776. As did John Longland bishop of Lincoln, who died in 1547. Tanner, BIBL. 485. But the college was dissolved, before that bequest could take place. I should speak here of Bury. This prelate was one of the earliest English restorers of literature. Of his PHILOBIB∣LON, I have spoken at large in the SECOND DISSERTATION prefixed to the first volume of the HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY. He held some of the highest offices both in church and state under Edward the third, whose education he had su∣perintended. In the year 1331, he was sent by that king to Avignon, to negotiate some business with the pope. Rymer, FOED. ii. 59. He there lodged in the house of cardinal Colonne, where Petrarch at that time also resided. Petrarch embraced the fortunate opportunity of consulting this learned Englishman, then only a private ecclesiastic, about the situation of the antient Thule, supposed to be one of the British islands: for the geo∣graphy of antiquity was one of Petrarch's favorite studies. Be∣ing without his books, of which he had amassed a prodigious collection, he promised to transmitt to Petrarch the best infor∣mation he could obtain on this subject, after his return to Eng∣land. What had immediately given rise to Petrarch's curiosity about this island, probably was Giraldus's fabulous account of Thule, in his MIRABILIA HIBERNIAE, a work just publish∣ed, and recently translated into French by John of Meun, author of the <HI>Romaunt de la Rose.</HI> Petrarch wrote frequently to Richard of Bury to know the result of his promised enquiries about Thule: but, perhaps in consequence of Bury's important occu∣pations, never received any answer. See Petrarchae EPISTOL. iii. 1. In this epistle, Petrarch calls Bury, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Virum ardentis ingenii nec literarum inscium, abditarumque rerum supra fidem curiosum."</Q> The ingenious author of LA VIE DE PE∣TRARQUE, thinks that Petrarch's letters to Bury are now in some library of England. Tom. i. Liv. ii. p. 169. Amst. 1764. 4to. I have searched for this treasure, but without success. See Wharton, ANGL. SACR. i. 765. Leland and his transcriber Trithemius are mistaken in what they have asserted about Pe∣trarch's correspondence with this prelate. From what is here said, may be also corrected two slight mistakes in the French ENCYCLOPEDE, under the article BIBLIOTHEQUE.</P></NOTE>.<PB N="417" REF="439"/></P>

In consequence of the dissolution of the monasteries, and of the reformation of religion, church music received an almost irreparable blow. Few were then educated at least to the me∣chanical part of the profession; and when the splendor of the popish worship was restored, after a long intermission, by queen Mary, it was difficult to procure instrumental practitioners, pro∣perly qualified to assist at the solemnities of the mass. Under these circumstances in order to facilitate and secure so precarious an acquisition, Sir Thomas Pope found it necessary to provide in his statutes, that there should be constantly one person admitted into the society, competently skilled in music, who might be able to execute the office of organist to the college. That this was the case, the provision itself seems to imply; as well as the reason which the founder expressly suggests for it, and the manner in which it is worded. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hic autem, quoniam opus est, et maxime convenit, ut per hanc electionem <HI>provideatur</HI> nequando dictum Collegium ORGANORUM PULSATORE sit <HI>destitutum,</HI> nec <HI>talis ubique inveniri possit facile,</HI> liberam dictis electoribus potestatem facio et permitto, unum aliquem talem de quocunque possint loco eligendi, qui ludendi organis pe∣ritus, et in grammaticae etiam rudimentis competenter erudi∣tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in dictorum scholarium numerum, modo sit pauper, ad∣mittatur; et organa in dictis festis, aliasque in officiis divi∣nis, more in ecclesiis consueto, pulsare tenebitur: nisi Socio∣rum quisquam id praestare muneris melius noverit et poterit."</Q> STATUT. coll.

<P>I am not in the mean time ignorant, that antiently in our foundations of churches and colleges, no separate or distinct officer, by the name of organist, was ever appointed. This duty was subordinate, and appears to have been commonly per∣formed by one of the clerks. In the statutes of Corpus Christi college at Oxford, given in 1517, two chapel-clerks are estab∣lished, one of whom is also to be the <HI>Organorum pulsator.</HI> Cap. xvii. The first instance of the mention of an Organ in any collegiate statutes which I have had the opportunity to examine, occurs in those of Eton college, made about the year 1440. Where one of the four clerks who is appointed to instruct the choristers, is moreover ordered <HI>jubilare organis.</HI> Cap. x. Here also, for the first time, <HI>Cantus organicus</HI> is mentioned.

Eccles. Roffens. dat. A.D. 1545. Cap. xxii. At New college Oxford, King's at Cambridge, and Winchester-college, in each of which are ample choirs, there is no provision by statute, not even for an <HI>Informator Choristarum.</HI> Although such an officer occurs in the early rolls of New-college. At Magdalen college Oxford, founded about the year 1459, there is also no mention of an organist: but it is enjoined that one of the chaplains, or clerks, or some other skillful person, shall educate the choristers in the plain chant and pricked song. Cardinal Wolsey in the statutes of his college at Oxford, given 1525, mentions a <HI>music-master,</HI> not by the name of an <HI>organist,</HI> who is to be <HI>musicae peritissmus.</HI> MSS.

<P>To recur to the first part of this note. There is a curious passage in Erasmus's Annotations on the New Testament, writ∣ten about the year 1512, which admirably displays the state of our church-music, just before the Reformation, EPIST. Corinth. i. xiv. 19. [Opp. Tom. vi. C. 731. N. 26.] <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We have in∣troduced into the churches, a certain elaborate and theatrical species of music, accompanied with a tumultuous diversity of voices. All is full of trumpets, cornets, pipes, fiddles, and singing. We come to church as to a play-house. And for this purpose, ample salaries are expended on organists, and societies of boys, whose whole time is wasted in learning to sing. Not to mention the vast revenues which the church squanders away in the stipends of singing-men, who are com∣monly great drunkards, buffoons, and chosen from the lowest of the people. These fooleries are become so agreeable, that the monks, especially in ENGLAND, think of nothing else. To this end, even in the Benedictine MONASTERIES OF ENGLAND, many youths, boys, and other vocal performers, are sustained; who, early every morning, sing to the organ the mass of the Virgin Mary with the most harmonious mo∣dulations of voice.

<P>These notices relating to the troops raised by the university of Oxford in Monmouth's rebellion, remind me of a curious anecdote concerning Smith's famous Ode entitled POCOCKIUS, which I give from MSS. COD. BALLARD, vol. xix. Letter 104. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In Monmouth's REBELLION, the university of Oxford raised a regiment for the King's service, and Christ Church and Jesus college made one Company, of which lord Norris, since earl of Abingdon, was captain: who presented Mr. Urry a Corporal [Serjeant] therein with a halbard. Upon Dr. Pocock's death, Mr. Urry lugged Captain Rag [Smith] into his chamber in Peckwater, locked him in, put the key in his pocket, and ordered his bedmaker to supply him with necessaries through the window, and told him he should not come out, till he made a copy of verses on the Doctor's death. The sentence being irreversible, the captain made the ODE, and sent it with this Epistle to Mr. Urry, who was a well built man, and large limbed: who [Smith] thereupon had his release."</Q> Pococke died in 1691. Urry, a student of Christ-church, was the editor of Chaucer. The EPISTLE, here mentioned, is a ludicrous prose analysis of the ODE, beginning <HI>Opusculum tuum, Halberdarie amplissime, &amp;c.</HI> and is lately printed in Dr. Johnson's ENGLISH POETS. vol. 4. p. 62. The writer of this anecdote is Mr. William Brome of Ewithington in Herefordshire, who died, aged 82, in 1745. He was of Merton college Oxford, an excellent scholar, and a very learned anti∣quary: intimately acquainted with Smith and Urry, and with Lord Oxford, John Philips, &amp;c. In one of his LETTERS he says, that Philips dedicated and sent to him the SPLENDID SHILLING in manuscript, and that he sent Philips in return a pound of tobacco. Ibid. LETT. 78.

Oxon. ii. 543.—f. 235.</NOTE>, son of Alexander Hyde, bishop of Salisbury<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Whose elder brother Laurence Hyde, esquire, of Heale near Salisbury, married MARY the daughter of ANTONY WARTON, rector of Bremor in Hamshire, about the reign of Charles the first, and great grandfather to the father of the author of this work. This lady, when a widow, for many days conceal∣ed and accommodated in her house at Heale, aforesaid, king Charles the second after his hazardous flight from the battle of Worcester, in the year 1651, and furnished the means for his escape into France. At the restoration, the king gave her a very valuable picture of himself, when a boy, a half-length, painted by Vandyck, and now in the possession of my brother doctor Warton of Winchester. See Clarendon's HIST. vol. iii. p. 331. edit. fol. 1704.</NOTE>. Thus by the death of male issue, and marriage of the female, this family and name, at least in this branch, became extinct soon after the restoration of Charles the second.</P>
<P>For from what is here collected on this subject, it must appear, that our great poet, ALEXANDER POPE, was related to this family only by some colla∣teral branch. I have mentioned all the male issue, and their marriages; except the marriages of John
<PB N="453" REF="475"/>
and William, two younger sons of sir William Pope knight, of Cogges: both which, I suspect, died young; but if ever married, either of them may reasonably be supposed rather too young<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">The eldest of them, John, was born Nov. 2, 1623. If it can be proved that he was the father of the elder Alexander Pope, it will follow that Thomas Pope, second earl of Downe, was his uncle: and consequently, that sir Thomas Pope, the founder of Trinity college, was the poet's uncle, to a high de∣gree. It may perhaps be trifling to mention, that ALEXANDER POPE occurs twice as a name in this family, in, and about, Temp. Edw. iii.—MSS. Pedigr. penes honoratiss. com. de Guildford.</NOTE> to have been the father of the elder Alexander Pope, who was born 1642<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ex Epitaphio.</NOTE>. Besides, had the poet been de∣scended from either of these two younger sons, the title of earl of Downe could not have failed during his own and his father's life-time. Mr. Pope tells us, that, his <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Father [Alexander] was of a gentle∣man's family in Oxfordshire, the head of which was the earl of Downe, whose sole heiress married the earl of Lindsey. His mother was the daughter of W. Turnor of York: She had three brothers, one of whom was killed, anothes died in the ser∣vice of king Charles."</Q> Notwithstanding what I have here said, I imagine that Mr. Pope alludes to Thomas Pope the second earl of Downe, whose epi∣taph I have given, no less than to his mother's bro∣thers, in the following lines.<Q><PB N="454" REF="476"/><L>Of gentle blood, part shed in <HI>honour's cause,</HI></L>
<L>While yet in Britain honour had applause,</L>
<L>EACH PARENT sprung<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Warb. POPE, iv. 43. ed. 1752.</NOTE>—</L></Q></P>
<P>And on the whole from my researches on this head I am inclined to determine, that our poet was descended from a branch of this family, viz. POPE <HI>of</HI> DEDINGTON<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Thomas Pope, grandfather of William Pope, sir Thomas Pope's father, had seven sons: William, the eldest, married <HI>Jane Bonde.</HI> MSS.

They have still, or lately had, in the family, which I believe has now lost the name of <HI>Pope,</HI> a picture of sir Thomas Pope, and esco∣cheons of his arms.</P>
<P>For the convenience of the reader, the following short Scheme, being a comprehensive recapitulation of what has been said, both here and in the LIFE, concerning this family, with some improvements, is annexed.</P>

Bodl. Oxon. Viz. A loose paper inserted in A. Wood's MS. ENGLISH History of the University of Oxford, tom. ii. fol. 388. Dr. Ralph Kettel was president of Trinity college, and an ex∣cellent governor, for near fifty years. He had been fellow and scholar of the college for fourteen years, during the life-time of this lady. His family lived in her neighbourhood, at King's Langley in Hertfordshire. She probably sent him to the col∣lege, where he was admitted scholar, Jun. 16, 1579. Registr. prim. fol. 30. He was chaplain to Bilson bishop of Winches∣ter, and to lady Walsingham, widow of the Secretary. A good old portrait of him, in a brown furred gown, is in the college. Aubrey says, that his picture was drawn by Mr. Bathurst, one of the foundation of Trinity college, from memory three years after his death, which was a strong likeness. SURREY, tom. v. p. 406. His Life, but with many mistakes and absurdities, is among Aubrey's manuscript LIVES in the Ashmolean Mu∣seum.</P>
<P>The following anecdote is recorded of Dr. Kettel, which I relate, because it is imperfectly told by Aubrey, and as it marks the times. While president, it was his custom to attend daily the DISPUTATIONS in the college-hall, on which occasion he constantly wore a large black-furred muff. Before him stood an hour-glass, brought by himself into the hall, and placed on a table, for ascertaining the time of the continuance of the exer∣cise, which was to last an hour at least. One morning, after Cromwell's soldiers had taken possession of Oxford, a halberdier rushed into the hall during this ceremony, and plucking off our venerable doctor's muff, threw it in his face; and then with a stroke of his halberd broke the hour-glass in pieces. The doc∣tor, though old and infirm, instantly seized the soldier by the collar, who was soon overpowered by the assistance of the dis∣putants. The halberd was carried out of the hall in triumph before the doctor; but the prisoner, with his halberd, was quickly rescued by a party of soldiers, who stood at the bottom of the hall, and had enjoyed the whole transaction. <HI>MS.

<P>This Memoir was probably drawn up by Dr. Kettel, as was the preceding narrative of the Founder's Visit to the College, by Dr. Yeldard, with an intention of inserting it in the college∣register: but, like that, it was mislaid or forgotten, and never entered. See p. 458. supr. in the notes. The manuscript seems to have been procured by Antony Wood from Dr. Ralph Ba∣thurst, who became possessed of many of Dr. Kettel's papers.</P></NOTE>.
