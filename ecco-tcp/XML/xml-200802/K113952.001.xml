<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AS none of the liberal sciences can afford a nobler entertainment to the human mind than poetry, so it is presumed, that a judicious collection of agreeable and instructive poems can never be unseasonable. Music ravishes the ear, and affects the soul; but its sweet enchantment is of short duration: A fine piece of painting, if carefully preserved, will mellow into perfection, and perhaps continue the admiration of mankind for some centuries; but the works of THE POET live for ever. We must, however, except those pieces, which, though intrinsically of the highest merit, yet, being published in a loose, careless, or in∣elegant manner, must of course, in a short time, perish in the wreck of oblivion. To preserve some of these spirited productions, which have been thus unfortunately neglected, is one part of the design of this publication. But it will be proper briefly to inform the reader of the nature of our plan. First then, we propose once a month (for one year only) to publish a small volume of poems, printed in an elegant manner; each of which will take its title from the month at the conclusion of which it is published, and be introduced with some ori∣ginal poems, particularly descriptive of its proper
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
month: afterwards will be added variety of pieces that are either amusing or instructive (and at the same time not immoral), which, though of real merit, have passed through the world unnoticed:
<Q><L>Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,</L>
<L>And waste its sweetness on the desert air.</L></Q></P>
<P>Though it must be confessed, that our plan is of an extensive nature, yet we do not in the least despair of bringing it to a considerable degree of perfection; as we have laid in a very large fund of scarce and valuable poems, are possessed of many original pieces, and have the promise of assistance from gentlemen of the most celebrated names, the most acknowledged taste, and the most distinguished genius.</P>

<HEAD>WINTER. AN ODE.</HEAD>
<L>NO more the morn, with tepid rays,</L>
<L>Unfolds the flow'rs of various hue;</L>
<L>Noon spreads no more the genial blaze;</L>
<L>Nor gentle eve distils the dew:</L>
<L>The lingering hours prolong the night,</L>
<L>Usurping darkness shares the day;</L>
<L>Her mists restrain the force of light,</L>
<L>And Phoebus holds a doubtful sway:</L>
<L>By gloomy twilight half reveal'd,</L>
<L>With sighs we view the hoary hill,</L>
<L>The leafless wood, the naked field,</L>
<L>The snow-topt cot, the frozen rill.</L>
<L>No music warbles thro' the grove,</L>
<L>No vivid colours paint the plain,</L>
<L>No more with devious steps I rove</L>
<L>Thro' verdant paths, now sought in vain!</L>
<L>Aloud the driving tempest roars,</L>
<L>Congeal'd, impetuous show'rs descend;</L>
<L>Haste, close the window, bar the doors,</L>
<L>Fate leaves me Stella, and a friend.</L>
<L>In nature's aid, let art supply</L>
<L>With light and heat my little sphere;</L>
<L>Rouse, rouse the fire, and pile it high,</L>
<L>Light up a constellation here.</L>

<L>Yet time life's dreary winter brings,</L>
<L>When mirth's gay tale shall please no more,</L>
<L>Nor music charm, tho' Stella sings,</L>
<L>Nor love nor wine the spring restore.</L>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Copenhagen, <DATE>March 9, 1719.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<L>FRom frozen climes, and endless tracks of snow,</L>
<L>From streams which northern winds forbid to flow,</L>
<L>What present shall the muse to Dorset bring;</L>
<L>Or how, so near the pole, attempt to sing?</L>
<L>All pleasing objects, which to verse invite,</L>
<L>The hoary winter here conceals from sight.</L>
<L>The hills, and dales, and the delightful woods,</L>
<L>The flowery plains, and silver-streaming floods,</L>
<L>By snow disguis'd, in bright confusion lie,</L>
<L>And with one dazzling waste fatigue the eye.</L>
<L>No gentle breathing breeze prepares the spring;</L>
<L>No birds within this desert region sing;</L>
<L>The ships, unmov'd, the boisterous winds defy,</L>
<L>While rattling chariots o'er the ocean fly:</L>
<L>The vast Leviathan wants room to play,</L>
<L>And spout his waters in the face of day:</L>
<L>The starving wolves along the main sea prowl,</L>
<L>And to the moon in icy valleys howl:</L>
<L>O'er many a shining league the level main</L>
<L>Here spreads itself into a glassy plain:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="14"/>There solid billows of enormous size,</L>
<L>Alps of green ice, in wild disorder rise.</L>
<L>And yet but lately have I seen, ev'n here,</L>
<L>The winter in a lovely dress appear.</L>
<L>Ere yet the clouds let fall the treasur'd snow,</L>
<L>Or winds began thro' hazy skies to blow;</L>
<L>At evening a keen eastern breeze arose,</L>
<L>And the descending rain unsully'd froze.</L>
<L>Soon as the silent shades of night withdrew,</L>
<L>The ruddy morn disclos'd at once to view</L>
<L>The face of nature in a rich disguise,</L>
<L>And brighten'd every object to my eyes.</L>
<L>For every shrub, and every blade of grass,</L>
<L>And every pointed thorn, seem'd wrought in glass:</L>
<L>In pearls and rubies rich the hawthorns show,</L>
<L>While thro' the ice the crimson berries glow:</L>
<L>The thick-sprung reeds, which watery marshes yield,</L>
<L>Seem'd polish'd lances in a hostile field:</L>
<L>The stag, in limpid currents, with surprize,</L>
<L>Sees crystal branches on his forehead rise:</L>
<L>The spreading oak, the beech, and towering pine,</L>
<L>Glaz'd over, in the freezing aether shine:</L>
<L>The frighted birds the rattling branches shun,</L>
<L>Which wave and glitter in the distant sun.</L>
<L>When, if a sudden gust of wind arise,</L>
<L>The brittle forest into atoms flies:</L>
<L>The crackling wood beneath the tempest bends,</L>
<L>And in a spangled show'r the prospect ends.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="15"/>Or, if a southern gale the region warm,</L>
<L>And by degrees unbind the wintery charm:</L>
<L>The traveller a miry country sees,</L>
<L>And journies sad beneath the dropping trees.</L>
<L>Like some deluded peasant, Merlin leads</L>
<L>Thro' fragrant bow'rs, and thro' delicious meads;</L>
<L>While here enchanted gardens to him rise,</L>
<L>And airy fabrics there attract his eyes:</L>
<L>His wandering feet the magic paths pursue;</L>
<L>And while he thinks the fair illusion true,</L>
<L>The trackless scenes disperse in fluid air,</L>
<L>And woods, and wilds, and thorny ways appear;</L>
<L>A tedious road the weary wretch returns,</L>
<L>And, as he goes, the transient vision mourns.</L>

<L>Rich spangled doublets, and lac'd coats.</L>
<L>The hills were perriwigg'd with snow;</L>
<L>Pig-tails of ice hung on each tree;</L>
<L>The winds turn'd powder-puffs; and, lo,</L>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Caesar, having resolved to give battle to Petreius and Afranius, Pompey's lieutenants in Spain, encamped near the enemy in the same field. The behaviour of their soldiers, at their seeing and knowing one another, is the subject of the following verses.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<L>THeir antient friends, as now they nearer drew,</L>
<L>Prepar'd for fight the wondering soldiers knew:</L>
<L>Brother, with brother in unnat'ral strife,</L>
<L>And the son arm'd against the father's life:</L>
<L>Curst civil war! then conscience first was felt,</L>
<L>And the tough veteran's heart began to melt.</L>
<L>Fix'd in dumb sorrow all at once they stand,</L>
<L>Then wave, a pledge of peace, the guiltless hand;</L>
<L>For vent ten thousand struggling passions move,</L>
<L>The stings of nature, and the pangs of love.</L>
<L>All order broken, wide their arms they throw,</L>
<L>And run, with transport, to the longing foe:</L>
<L>Here their long-lost acquaintance neighbours claim,</L>
<L>There an old friend recalls his comrade's name,</L>
<L><PB N="53" REF="59"/>Youths, who in arts beneath one tutor grew,</L>
<L>Rome rent in twain, and kindred hosts they view.</L>
<L>Tears wet their impious arms, a fond relief,</L>
<L>And kisses, broke by sobs, the words of grief;</L>
<L>Tho' yet no blood was spilt, each anxious mind</L>
<L>With horror thinks on what his rage design'd.</L>
<L>Ah! generous youths, why thus, with fruitless pain,</L>
<L>Beat ye those breasts? why gush those eyes in vain?</L>
<L>Why blame ye heaven, and charge your guilt on fate?</L>
<L>Why dread the tyrant, whom yourselves make great?</L>
<L>Bids he the trumpet sound? the trumpet slight—</L>
<L>Bids he the standard move? refuse the fight—</L>
<L>Your generals, left by you, will love again,</L>
<L>A son and father, when they're private men.</L>
<L>Kind concord, heavenly-born! whose blissful reign</L>
<L>Holds this vast globe in one surrounding chain,</L>
<L>Whose laws the jarring elements controul,</L>
<L>And knit each atom close from pole to pole;</L>
<L>Soul of the world! and love's eternal spring!</L>
<L>This lucky hour, thy aid, fair goddess, bring!</L>
<L>This lucky hour, ere aggravated crimes</L>
<L>Heap guilt on guilt, and doubly stain the times.</L>
<L>No veil henceforth for sin, for pardon none;</L>
<L>They know their duty, now their friends are known.</L>
<L>Vain wish! from blood short must the respite be;</L>
<L>New crimes, by love inhanc'd, this night shall see:</L>
<L>Such is the will of fate, and such the hard decree.</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="60"/>'Twas peace. From either camp, now void of fear,</L>
<L>The soldiers mingling cheerful feasts prepare:</L>
<L>On the green sod the friendly bowls were crown'd</L>
<L>And hasty banquets pil'd upon the ground:</L>
<L>Around the fire they talk; one shows his scars,</L>
<L>One tells what chance first led him to the wars;</L>
<L>Their stories o'er the tedious night prevail,</L>
<L>And the mute circle listens to the tale.</L>
<L>They own they fought, but swear they ne'er could hate</L>
<L>Deny their guilt, and lay the blame on fate;</L>
<L>Their love revives, to make them guiltier grow,</L>
<L>A short-liv'd blessing, but to heighten woe.</L>
<L>When to Petreius first the news was told,</L>
<L>The jealous general thought his legions sold.</L>
<L>Swift, with the guards, his head-strong fury drew,</L>
<L>From out his camp he drives the hostile crew;</L>
<L>Cuts clasping friends asunder with his sword,</L>
<L>And stains with blood each hospitable board.</L>
<L>Then thus his wrath breaks out. "Oh! lost to fame</L>
<L>" Oh! false to Pompey, and the Roman name!</L>
<L>" Can ye not conquer, ye degenerate bands?</L>
<L>" Oh! die at least 'tis all that Rome demands.</L>
<L>" What? will ye own, while ye can wield the sword,</L>
<L>" A rebel standard, and usurping lord?</L>
<L>" Shall he be sued to take you into place</L>
<L>" Amongst his slaves, and grant you equal grace?</L>
<L>" What? shall my life be begg'd? inglorious thought!</L>
<L>" And life abhorr'd, on such conditions bought!</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="61"/>" The toils we bear, my friends, are not for life,</L>
<L>" Too mean a prize in such a dreadful strife;</L>
<L>" But peace would lead to servitude and shame,</L>
<L>" A fair amusement, and a specious name.</L>
<L>" Never had man explor'd the iron ore,</L>
<L>" Mark'd out the trench, or rais'd the lofty tower,</L>
<L>" Ne'er had the steed in harness sought the plain,</L>
<L>" Or fleets encounter'd on th' unstable main;</L>
<L>" Were life, were breath, with fame to be compar'd,</L>
<L>" Or peace to glorious liberty preferr'd.</L>
<L>" By guilty oaths the hostile army bound,</L>
<L>" Holds fast its impious faith, and stands its ground;</L>
<L>" Are you perfidious, who espouse the laws,</L>
<L>" And traytors only in a righteous cause?</L>
<L>" Oh shame! in vain thro' nations far and wide,</L>
<L>" Thou call'st the crowding monarchs to thy side,</L>
<L>" Fallen Pompey! while thy legions here betray</L>
<L>" Thy cheap bought life, and treat thy fame away."</L>
<L>He ended fierce. The soldier's rage returns,</L>
<L>His blood flies upward, and his bosom burns.</L>
<L>So, hap'ly tam'd, the tyger bears his bands,</L>
<L>Less grimly growls, and licks his keeper's hands;</L>
<L>But if by chance he tastes forbidden gore,</L>
<L>He yells amain, and makes his dungeon roar:</L>
<L>He glares, he foams, he aims a desperate bound,</L>
<L>And his pale master flies the dangerous ground.</L>
<L>Now deeds are done, which man might charge aright</L>
<L>On stubborn fate, or undiscerning night,</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="62"/>Had not their guilt the lawless soldiers known,</L>
<L>And made the whole malignity their own.</L>
<L>The beds, the plenteous tables float with gore,</L>
<L>And breasts are stabb'd, that were embrac'd before:</L>
<L>Pity awhile their hands from slaughter kept,</L>
<L>Inward they groan'd, and, as they drew, they wept;</L>
<L>But every blow their wavering rage assures,</L>
<L>In murder hardens, and to blood inures.</L>
<L>Crowds charge on crowds, nor friends their friends descry,</L>
<L>But sires by sons, and sons by fathers die.</L>

<HEAD>TRUST IN GOD. A POEM.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY PETER PINNELL, M.A.</BYLINE>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul, and why art thou disquieted within me.—</L>
<L>—PUT THY TRUST IN GOD.</L>
<BIBL>Ps. XLII. 6, 7.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<L>WHY droops the head, why languishes the eye?</L>
<L>What mean the flowing tear, and frequent sigh?</L>
<L>Where are the lenient med'cines to impart</L>
<L>Their balmy virtue to a bleeding heart?</L>
<L>Fruitless are all attempts for kind relief</L>
<L>To mix her cordial, and allay my grief;</L>
<L>So strong my anguish, so severe my pain,</L>
<L>Weak is philosophy, and reason vain:</L>
<L>Such rules, like fuel, make my passion glow,</L>
<L>Quicken each pang, and point the sting of woe:</L>
<L>Imagination labours but in vain,</L>
<L>While darkening clouds intoxicate the brain:</L>
<L>Fancy no sweet ideas can suggest,</L>
<L>To lull the raging tumult in my breast;</L>
<L>In vain or mirth invites, or friendship calls,</L>
<L>Wit dies a jest, and conversation palls;</L>
<L>Nature and art supply fresh springs of care,</L>
<L>And each obtruding thought creates despair;</L>
<L><PB N="82" REF="88"/>No scenes amuse me, that amus'd before,</L>
<L>And what delighted once, delights no more:</L>
<L>Tho' all creation beautiful appears,</L>
<L>And nature's aspect a rich verdure wears;</L>
<L>Yet still her bloom with sickening eyes I see,</L>
<L>And all her luxury is lost on me:</L>
<L>The budding plants of variegated hue,</L>
<L>The blossoms opening with the morning dew;</L>
<L>The vernal breeze that gently fans the bowers,</L>
<L>The laughing meadows, and enlivening showers,</L>
<L>Th' enamell'd garden, where the works of art</L>
<L>Give strength to nature, and fresh charms impart;</L>
<L>Where gaudy pinks, and blushing roses bloom,</L>
<L>Rich in array, and pregnant with perfume;</L>
<L>Where Flora, smiling, sees her offspring vie</L>
<L>To spread their beauties, and regale the eye:</L>
<L>All, all, in vain, with charms united glow</L>
<L>To deck the scene, or gild the face of woe:</L>
<L>So when the morning lark ascending sings,</L>
<L>While joy attunes his voice, and mounts his wings;</L>
<L>Tho' to his cheerful notes the hills reply,</L>
<L>And warbling music gladdens all the sky;</L>
<L>Still in his strains no pleasing charms I find,</L>
<L>No sweet enchantment to compose my mind.</L>
<L>In vain the sun his gaudy pride displays,</L>
<L>No genial warmth attends his brightest rays;</L>
<L>And when his absent light the moon supplies,</L>
<L>Or planets glitter to enrich the skies,</L>
<L><PB N="83" REF="89"/>No gleam of comfort from their lustre flows,</L>
<L>No harbinger of peace, or calm repose:</L>
<L>But gloomy vapours o'er the night prevail,</L>
<L>And pestilence is spread in every gale:</L>
<L>Thus weaken'd by a gradual decay,</L>
<L>Life's bitter cup I drink without allay,</L>
<L>Nor taste the blessing of one cheerful day.</L>
<L>Come then, kind death, thy sharpest steel prepare,</L>
<L>Here point the dart, and snatch me from despair!</L>
<L>But stop, O man, thy plaintive strains suppress,</L>
<L>With Christian patience learn to acquiesce!</L>
<L>Th' instructive voice of reason calmly hear,</L>
<L>And let religion check the flowing tear:</L>
<L>Whate'er the will of providence assigns,</L>
<L>'Tis Infidelity alone repines;</L>
<L>But those who trust in God disdain to grieve,</L>
<L>And what our father sends, with joy receive;</L>
<L>Whose sharp corrections testify his love,</L>
<L>And certain blessings in the end will prove;</L>
<L>Who sees how man would err without controul,</L>
<L>Afflicts the body, to improve the soul,</L>
<L>And by chastizing part, preserves the whole.</L>
<L>Hence, tho' dark-lowering skies, and angry gales,</L>
<L>Conspire to raise the storm, and rend the sails;</L>
<L>Yet, if calm reason at the helm preside,</L>
<L>My little bark will stem both wind and tide;</L>
<L>And adverse currents shall at last convey,</L>
<L>The shatter'd vessel to the realms of day!</L>
<L><PB N="84" REF="90"/>Thus taught by Faith, how rash it is and vain</L>
<L>For man, mere dust and ashes, to complain!</L>
<L>My soul, with sad disquietude opprest,</L>
<L>Directs her flight to heaven in search of rest;</L>
<L>And refuge takes (which "peace at last will bring")</L>
<L>Beneath the shadow of th' Almighty's wing;</L>
<L>On him I fix my mind, and place my trust,</L>
<L>A Being infinitely wise and just!</L>
<L>And should his providence new beams create,</L>
<L>To brighten the complexion of my fate,</L>
<L>A cheerful tribute to his throne I'll raise,</L>
<L>And stamp my song with gratitude and praise.</L>
<L>But should indulgence suit not his designs,</L>
<L>Who evil into happiness refines;</L>
<L>Let due submission make my burden light,</L>
<L>And may I think—Whatever is, is right!</L>
<L>Then "be not thou disquieted my soul,"</L>
<L>Have lively faith—and "faith will make thee whole."</L>
<L>When heaven inflicts, with calmness bear the stroke,</L>
<L>Since to repine is only to provoke;</L>
<L>Learn to adore the justice of thy God,</L>
<L>And kiss the sacred hand that holds the rod;</L>
<L>That sacred hand, which first the heart explores,</L>
<L>Probes every wound, and searches all the sores;</L>
<L>Then the right med'cine properly applies,</L>
<L>To cleanse the part where all th' infection lies.</L>
<L>Hear this, thou coward man, nor dread the smart,</L>
<L>Which, tho' it stings, will purify the heart;</L>
<L><PB N="85" REF="91"/>For resignation will promote the cure,</L>
<L>And, tho' the means are sharp, the end is sure.</L>
<L>Since then afflictions are thro' mercy sent,</L>
<L>To be of good the happy instrument;</L>
<L>Since for the noblest ends they are design'd,</L>
<L>To form the judgment, to improve the mind,</L>
<L>To curb our passions, to direct our love,</L>
<L>To awe mankind, and speak a God above;</L>
<L>O may I view them with religion's eye,</L>
<L>Nor lose the guard of virtue till I die!</L>
<L>Hence shall I taste the sweets that evils bring,</L>
<L>And suck the honey, while I feel the sting;</L>
<L>Hence shall I learn the bitter cup to bless,</L>
<L>And drink it as a draught of happiness;</L>
<L>A wholesome potion, which, tho' mix'd with gall,</L>
<L>May still preserve my life, my soul, my all!</L>
<L>Thus fix'd my heart; tho' fruit should fail the vine,</L>
<L>The fig-tree sicken, and its bloom decline;</L>
<L>The labour of the olive be in vain,</L>
<L>And flocks infected, perish on the plain;</L>
<L>Tho' corn, and oil, and wine at once decrease,</L>
<L>The fields grow barren, and the harvest cease;</L>
<L>Tho baffled hinds their fruitless toil deplore,</L>
<L>And vales uncheerful laugh and sing no more;</L>
<L>Yet still with gladness would I serve the Lord,</L>
<L>Adore his wisdom, and obey his word—</L>
<L>Hear then, O God, regard a suppliant's prayer;</L>
<L>Sooth all my pangs, and save me from despair:</L>
<L><PB N="86" REF="92"/>Illuminate my soul with gladsome rays,</L>
<L>And tune my voice to thy eternal praise;</L>
<L>Dispel the clouds of darkness from my eyes,</L>
<L>And make me know that to be good is wise:</L>
<L>Let christian precepts all my soul employ,</L>
<L>And be not more my duty, than my joy:</L>
<L>Let conscience, void of art, and free from guile,</L>
<L>Still in my bosom innocently smile;</L>
<L>Her cheerful beams will gild the gloom of fate,</L>
<L>And make me happy in whatever state.</L>
<L>Hence shall I learn my talent to improve,</L>
<L>If poor by patience, and if rich by love;</L>
<L>If fortune smiles, let me be virtue's friend,</L>
<L>And where I go, let charity attend:</L>
<L>Within my bosom let compassion dwell,</L>
<L>To soften all the woes which others feel;</L>
<L>T' asswage by kind relief affliction's sighs,</L>
<L>And wipe the falling tear from widows eyes;</L>
<L>To feed the hungry, the distress'd to cheer,</L>
<L>The needy succour, and the feeble rear:</L>
<L>Hence shall my mind, inflam'd with public good,</L>
<L>Unshaken stand in midst of plenty's flood;</L>
<L>Hence shall I scorn temptation's gilded bait,</L>
<L>Look with disdain on all the pomp of state,</L>
<L>And by humility be truly great.</L>
<L>But should it be thy blessed will to spread</L>
<L>Clouds of thick darkness lowering o'er my head;</L>
<L>Let me have grace to know they are design'd,</L>
<L>To check my follies, and correct my mind;</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="93"/>Let me have grace to know in my distress,</L>
<L>I still to thee may have a free access;</L>
<L>And be an heir (tho' all the world should frown)</L>
<L>Of heavenly glory, and a future crown!</L>
<L>From these reflections true contentment flows,</L>
<L>Contentment—such as grandeur seldom knows;</L>
<L>Hence in the lowly cot a relish springs,</L>
<L>Above the taste of courts, and pride of kings.</L>
<L>Thus in the flood of wealth be thou my guide,</L>
<L>And steer my course 'twixt avarice and pride;</L>
<L>Or, in the ebb of fortune, teach my mind</L>
<L>To know its duty, and to be resign'd;</L>
<L>Prepare me to receive or good or ill,</L>
<L>As the result of thy almighty will;</L>
<L>Thy will, whose chief design and general plan</L>
<L>Tend to promote the happiness of man:</L>
<L>Be every sensual appetite suppress'd,</L>
<L>Nor the least taint lie lurking in my breast:</L>
<L>Let steady reason my affections guide,</L>
<L>And calm content sit smiling by my side;</L>
<L>Teach me with scorn to view the things below,</L>
<L>As gaudy phantoms, and an empty show;</L>
<L>But guide my wishes to the things above,</L>
<L>As the sole object of a christian's love;</L>
<L>Make me reflect on my eternal home,</L>
<L>A dying Saviour, and a life to come;</L>
<L>Direct me virtue's happy course to run,</L>
<L>And let me, as instructed by thy son,</L>
<L>In every station say, Thy will be done.</L>

<HEAD>FABLE II. ALEXANDER'S STICK.</HEAD>
<L>GOD Alexander, it was said,</L>
<L>Like mortal man, lay sick in bed:</L>
<L>Without—'tis said, without—we hear,</L>
<L>How can a fabulist appear?</L>
<L>Once on a day—once on a night—</L>

<L>So far digrest, let's retrograde,</L>

<L>This son of Jove was but a man:</L>
<L>In bed we left him, and no doubt,</L>

<L>The gout! are kings tormented thus?</L>
<L>Have they infirmities like us?</L>
<L>Why not? one clay makes up our frame;</L>
<L>And kings and subjects are the same.</L>
<L>It happen'd, where our god was sick,</L>
<L>That on the carpet lay a stick;</L>
<L>Yes, a crabstick by chance lay there,</L>
<L>No matter how, or whence, or where.</L>
<L>The wanted stick was valued much,</L>
<L>And soon was fashion'd into crutch.</L>
<L><PB N="100" REF="106"/>And now the monarch's dear support,</L>
<L>He thinks himself, like some at court,</L>
<L>Of such importance to the state,</L>
<L>All must on him obsequious wait.</L>
<L>Such merit never can be slighted;</L>
<L>And to be sure he will be knighted.</L>
<L>And then aloud how fame will blab,</L>
<L>That he is dubb'd Sir Broomstick Crab!</L>
<L>Favour at court, I've often read,</L>
<L>Intoxicates the wisest head:</L>
<L>If so, ye courtiers, by your leave,</L>
<L>How must a simpleton behave?</L>
<L>Sir Crab now hopes to be his grace,</L>
<L>Since he supplies the sceptre's place;</L>
<L>For if a sceptre's really good,</L>
<L>Be it of silver, gold, or wood,</L>
<L>'Tis not the matter which we prize,</L>
<L>In merit all the difference lies.</L>
<L>Merit I have no doubt, or why</L>
<L>Should this great king on me rely?</L>
<L>Last night, his generals around him</L>
<L>Had left him all just as they found him;</L>
<L>But with my help the god-like man</L>
<L>Of future conquests form'd the plan;</L>
<L>Trac'd in the sand, in case of need,</L>
<L>How to fall back, and when proceed;</L>
<L>Here we make war; there peace proclaim;</L>
<L>With us great folks 'tis all the same.</L>
<L><PB N="101" REF="107"/>Yet we'll pursue an honest plan,</L>
<L>And fix the limits—if we can.</L>
<L>But who shall check our bold career?</L>

<L>Whilst every whistling breath of wind</L>
<L>Adds deeper horror to his mind.</L>
<L>He sweats in tremor, sinks his head,</L>
<L>To every sense of comfort dead:</L>
<L>With pain reflects, attempts to pray,</L>
<L>And yearns to see the glimpse of day.</L>
<L>Not so, the steady, tranquil man,</L>
<L>Who acts by reason's virtuous plan;</L>
<L>No wild fantastic thoughts controul</L>
<L>The settled firmness of his soul.</L>
<L>For, thro' the gloomy veil of night,</L>
<L>He sees a constant, sacred light,</L>
<L>That beams its unremitting ray,</L>
<L>And changes darkness into day.</L>

<HEAD>JANUARY. AN ODE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ON yon black cloud, behold Aquarius stand,</L>
<L>Poising an ample urn in either hand!</L>
<L>The load he sways, then swiftly pours</L>
<L>In cataracts the deluge down;</L>
<L>The rough wind howls discordant with the showers,</L>
<L>Whilst nature knits each feature to a frown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The dripping poultry seek the closest sheds:</L>
<L>The pensive warblers droop their little heads:</L>
<L>Nor without cause. No gilding ray</L>
<L>Breaks thro' the foggy veil of air;</L>
<L>But all is picturesque of blank dismay,</L>
<L>Engendering spirits of extreme despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is this th' unpleasing foretaste of the year?</L>
<L>And does the first month meet me with a tear?</L>
<L>And shall not better days ensue,</L>
<L>The soul to cherish and sustain?</L>
<L>Shall no bright prospects lengthen to the view,</L>
<L>No river smile, no landscape charm again?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lo! fly the clouds; the sun renews his ray;</L>
<L>Aquarius adds a lustre to the day:</L>
<L><PB N="120" REF="126"/>To globes of ice each freezing urn</L>
<L>Transforms: The crown, which late he wore</L>
<L>Surcharg'd with wet, condenses in its turn,</L>
<L>And looks a substance of self-polish'd ore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now round the board, my friends! in concert join,</L>
<L>And drown despair in copious floods of wine.</L>
<L>Vulcan! sit down and blow the fire;</L>
<L>And Bacchus, thou! my butler be:</L>
<L>Approach, my Genius! fill the goblet higher,</L>
<L>I'll have no other Ganymede but thee.</L>
