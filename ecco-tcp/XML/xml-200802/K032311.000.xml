<P>Love at a Venture. A COMEDY. As it is ACTED By his Grace, the Duke of <HI>Grafton</HI>'s Servants, AT THE NEW THEATRE IN BATH.</P>
<P>Written by the Author of the <HI>Gamester.</HI></P>
<P><HI>LONDON:</HI> Printed for <HI>John Chantry,</HI> at the Sign of <HI>Lincolon</HI>'s<HI>-Inn-Square,</HI> at <HI>Lincolons-Inn-Back-Gate,</HI> 1706. Price 1<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI></P>

<HEAD>To his Grace, <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Beaufort,</HI> Marquiss and Earl of <HI>Worcester,</HI> Baron <HI>Herbert</HI> of <HI>Gower, Rawland, Chep∣stow, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Grace,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has been a general, and allow'd Custom, in all Ages, for Poets, to lay their Works at some Great Man's Feet, and always to chuse such as are eminently Conspicuous for their Ver∣tues. This made <HI>Horace</HI> single out <HI>Mecenas,</HI> and <HI>Terence</HI> court the Protection of <HI>Scipio</HI> and <HI>Lelius;</HI> which encourages me, in humble Imitation of those Great Men, to beg <HI>your Grace's</HI> Pratro∣nage for the following Scenes. It would be a kind of Poetical Sacrilege to offer them else where, since it wou'd rob <HI>your Grace</HI> of the Homage, to which your Quality, Sense, and good Nature, your Indulgence to Poetry, and your Judgment as well as Love for Musick, give you an indisput∣able Title. Musick is the Soul of Poesy, and
<PB REF="4"/>
Numbers sound most sweet, when grac'd with soft harmonious Strains.</P>
<P>I am the more forward, to pay this just Debt, <HI>My Lord,</HI> because without the help of Fiction, consequently without the help of Flattery, I have a large Field for a Panegyrick; which, however, I shall prudently decline, for fear of degrading your Vertues through my Inability and Meanness of Expression. Yet I cannot forbear mentioning the Excellency of <HI>your Grace's</HI> Temper, your Good∣ness and Affability, and the Regard you have for that generous Custom, which formerly distin∣guish'd the <HI>English</HI> Nation, from all the rest of the World, <HI>viz.</HI> Hospitality: which makes <HI>your Grace</HI> admired, and beloved to a degree, next Adoration, by all, who are so happy as to approach you.</P>
<P><HI>Your Grace,</HI> is a true Pattern of Nobility: The prudent Management of your Affairs; your Voluntary Retreat from Noise and Vice, shew you have a right Conception of the Joys of Life, as <HI>Cowley</HI> has describ'd them. To favour your Retirement, Nature seems to have taken peculiar Care to indulge <HI>your Grace's</HI> Solitude, with all her choice Productions: For your Gardens exceed all that Poets feign.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
That <HI>your Grace,</HI> may long enjoy those Blessings in perfect Health, and unmolested Peace, together with your Beauteous Lady; and that your Con∣nubial Joys may produce a perfect Copy of their Parents, which may adorn the Age to come, with the same Singularity of Goodness, as <HI>your Grace</HI> does the present; are, <HI>My Lord,</HI> the sincere Wishes of,</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>LEast any here shou'd blame our Author's toil,</L>
<L>For stroling with her Boat a Hundred Mile.</L>
<L>By me to such, She does this Reason give,</L>
<L>Seeing how many Men by Ventures live.</L>
<L>She straight embark'd, and hoisted Sail to try,</L>
<L>What pure good Nature in these Bottoms lye.</L>
<L>Beside, she hop'd, she might divert you too,</L>
<L>By adding to your Pleasures something new.</L>
<L>The Vertue of these Baths had ne're been known,</L>
<L>If or'e these Hills, no Man had ventur'd down.</L>
<L>Here Doctors Venturing, come in hopes of Fees,</L>
<L>And Patients Venture, on their Skill for Ease,</L>
<L>For Wealth, the Merchant Ventures on the Seas.</L>
<L>The Lawyer Ventures upon any Cause,</L>
<L>And Venturing Client's begger'd by the Laws.</L>
<L>The Lover Ventures, to Address the Fair,</L>
<L>With broken Speeches, and dejected Air,</L>
<L>She runs a Venture, who relieves his care.</L>
<L>The Gamester Ventures, to improve his Store,</L>
<L>And having lost, he Ventures on for more.</L>
<L>The <HI>London</HI> Punk, in Garret shut all Day,</L>
<L>At Night, with last half Crown she Ventures to the Play.</L>
<L>The Amorous Cully, meeting with the Miss,</L>
<L>Ventures at Water-Gruel for a Kiss.</L>
<L>Since every Man, Adventures in his way,</L>
<L>Hither our Author ventur'd with her Play.</L>
<L>And hopes her Profits will her Charge defray,</L>
<L>If that bright Circle Ventures to adorn her Day.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE,</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Miss <HI>Jacobella Power.</HI></STAGE>
<L>IN spight of dull insipid Rules, I'm come,</L>
<L>To learn what Fate attends my Virgin Bloom.</L>
<L>Strange things I've heard this Night, that makes me fear,</L>
<L>Least I shou'd find such Entertainment here.</L>
<L>You Men are grown so witty in Deceit,</L>
<L>That We, poor Girls, are often ruin'd by't.</L>
<L>'Tis pitty—but I hope to cross this Play,</L>
<L>And be reveng'd on you some other way.</L>
<L>Well—but consider, We are tender Things,</L>
<L>That Innocence, and sprightly Beauty brings.</L>
<L>Soft Accents, broken Words, and yielding Air,</L>
<L>Are all the Weapons, that attend the Fair.</L>
<L>And can you long resist, the sweet Temptation,</L>
<L>Give us at least a Bill of Reformation.</L>
<L>That the succeeding Age may say of you,</L>
<L>You dare be Civil, tho' you can't be true.</L>
<L>But if at last no Charms have power to win-ye,</L>
<L>You're past Repentance—or the Devil's in-ye.</L>

<P>Humph—ha—I can't be positive in that, but—if it can walk at all—why can't it be made walk by Clock-work—but in a Months time I shall be able to answer that, and all other Objections—For, you must know, Yesterday I began my Study, in order to search out the Curiosity of every Country, Lan∣guage, Art and Science—you shall hear how I have Canton'd out the Day—I rise about Five. my first hour is laid out upon Law—'tis fit a Gentleman shou'd understand the Laws of his Country, tho' I hate the confounded Study, 'tis so crabbed—At Six.

<P>Look ye, Sir, your Declaration for my Cousin concerns me not; sor, from the first, to me you appear'd as indifferent as now—But if you think to impose upon my Understanding, you'l draw my utmost Malice on your Head.</P>

<P>Recal that Sentence, Madam; Or, let me fall a Sacrifice, to your supposed Resentments—never to know my Lovely, Dear Incognita, is Death, with all the additional Racks <HI>Barbarians</HI> e're invented, to sepa∣rate Soul and Body.

<P>No, upon my honour, Madam—My Name is, <HI>Constant,</HI> born in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> and come up about a Suit in <HI>Chancery;</HI> and know this Colonel no more, than you know me; if you please, I'll give you my Oath on't—which I can do without Perjury, that's my Comfort. <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I cou'd see this Gentleman which you take me for; can you believe I cou'd be so base to make Love to ano∣ther, if once I had presum'd to mention it to you—your Charms are full security against such Proceedings; I am con∣cern'd, that Nature has made any resemblance between us; I shall hate my self for being like him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beliz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, whether you will, or you will not be him, it is the same thing—provided you'l tell him, that I suffer'd his Addresses only for my Diversion, and that I never had any Passion for him, but loath, detest and hate him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell him—where shall I find him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I have done, and desire you'd know your way out.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd not willingly disobey a Lady; but here, Ma∣dam, you must pardon me, since my future good or ill de∣pends on you; I cannot stir from hence till I obtain your pro∣mise to assist my Suit, and give me hopes that I, at last, may know my Beauteous Fair.</P>

<P>Ha, ha, ha, all that I can say, Colonel, is, that you are very unlucky in this Affair, not but you Counterfeit to a Miracle; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Mischief is, that I have all my Senses, can see Colonel <HI>Revel,</HI> hear Colonel <HI>Revel,</HI> and understand Co∣lonel <HI>Revel,</HI> too well to solicit his Cause, I assure you.</P>

<P>To convince you of your Error.</P>

<P>That's the hardest task that you ever undertook, Colonel, and not to be effected; therefore, once more I tell you, you have seen your last of her, and your absence wou'd oblige me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very hard, Madam, that because nature has made me resemble another Person, who may, for ought I know, be a Man of Honour too, tho' unhappily under your Dis∣pleasure, I shou'd have the ill Fortune to suffer for Nature's Fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beliz.</SPEAKER>
<P>That wou'd, indeed, be unjust—but I shall not be prevail'd upon to believe Nature in the fault here; therefore, pray retire, the Scene is long enough, 'tis time to change it; good Colonel, don't oblige one to treat you below your Title.</P>

<P>Don't you understand my Lady, Sir.</P>

<P>Look ye, Marriage is a lasting thing—if it were for six Months only, I might venture upon thee—but for all days of my Life—mercy upon me—thy fea∣tures are too high priz'd, Furniture for House-keeping, espe∣cially where they must let Lodgings—therefore, <HI>Flora,</HI> have at thee—</P>

<P>Tho' you shou'd make me a Lady, you'd not better my fortune much by being your Wife, our Humours wou'd quickly Consume our Estate;—I love fine Cloths,—fine Coach,—fine Equipage, and fine House;—Your Drink∣ing, Wenching, Gaming, and, soforth—that when I wan∣ted a New Suit, in the Morning, you have flung off your Money over-Night—</P>
