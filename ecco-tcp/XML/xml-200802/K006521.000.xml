ODE TO Mr. PINCHBECK, UPON HIS NEWLY INVENTED PATENT CANDLE-SNUFFERS, By MALCOLM M<SUP>c</SUP>GREGGOR, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Author of the Heroic Epistle to Sir WILLIAM CHAMBERS, and the Heroic Postscript.</P>

<L>Why should a Patent be granted to this Candle-Snuffer in vain?</L>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>EVER since my first Pulication, the Curiosity, not to say Anxiety, of the World concerning my Name, has been so great, that it has frequently given me Pain to conceal what the World will now see it was not possibly in my Power to discover.</P>
<P>In short, I had no Name, till the Royal Favour lately restored my very antient and honourable Clan to its pristine Title and Honours. I was therefore in the same deplorable Case with a certain nameless Lady, whom I have long had the Honour to call my Neigh∣bour, and who, I sincerely hope, will soon, by the same Favour, be restored to that Title, which, upon my Ho∣nour, I believe, she has erroneously, and not inten∣tionally forfeited.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that now, when the Public is in possession of my real Name, it will not, I hope, suf∣fer any national Prejudice to prevent it from receiving
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
this my first Lyrical Attempt with its former Candour. But I must needs say, that if this Ode does not sell as well as Mr. CUMBERLAND'S, I shall be apt to impute it, not to any inferiority of Lyrical Ordonance, but merely to its having been written by a Scotchman.</P>

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>ILLUSTRIOUS PINCHBECK! condescend,</L>
<L>Thou well-belov'd, and best King's-Friend,</L>
<L>These Lyric Lines to view;</L>
<L>O! may they prompt thee, e'er too late,</L>
<L>To snuff the Candle of the State,</L>
<L>That burns a little blue.</L>

<L>It once had got a stately Wick,</L>
<L>When in its Patent-Candlestick</L>
<L>The Revolution put it;</L>
<L>As white as Wax we saw it shine</L>
<L>Thro' two whole Lengths of BRUNSWICK's Line,</L>
<L>'Till B—first dar'd to smut it.</L>

<L>Since then—but wherefore tell the Tale?</L>
<L>Enough, that now it burneth pale,</L>
<L>And sorely wastes its Tallow:</L>
<L>Nay, if thy Poet rightly weens,</L>
<L>(Though little skill'd in Ways and Means)</L>
<L>Its Save-all is but shallow.</L>

<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>Come then, ingenious Artist, come,</L>
<L>And put thy Finger, and thy Thumb,</L>
<L>Into each polish'd Handle;</L>
<L>On thee alone our Hopes depend,</L>
<L>Thy King's, and eke thy Country's Friend,</L>
<L>To trim Old England's Candle.</L>

<L>Haste then, and quash the hot Turmoil,</L>

<L>"<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P>This great Philosopher has lately discovered a Method of fabricating a new Species of Air, of so infinitely superior salubrity and duration to that vulgar atmospherical Air, which for want of better we have been obliged to breathe for upwards of five thousand Years, that it is to be supposed that no Macaroni, Savoir Vivre, or in plain English, no body that knows what's what, will in future condescend to respire any Air, that is not sealed with the Doctor's own Arms, and signed with his own Hand-writing. It is to be feared, however, that his Pneumatic Vials will be liable to be counterfeited, as our Philosopher has not Interest enough at Court to procure a Patent. Indeed were such a Patent granted, it might supersede Mr. PINCHBECK's; because that in this Air a Candle is found to burn with so bright and con∣tinued a Flame, that it could never want snuffing.</P>
