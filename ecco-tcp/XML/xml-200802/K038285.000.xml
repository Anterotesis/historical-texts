<LG>
<L>HAPPY the <HI>Bard</HI> (tho' few such <HI>Bards</HI> we find)</L>
<L>Who, 'bove controulment, dares to speak his mind,</L>
<L>Dares, unabash'd, in ev'ry place appear,</L>
<L>And nothing fears, but what he ought to fear.</L>
<L>Him Fashion cannot tempt, him abject Need</L>
<L>Cannot compel, him Pride cannot mislead</L>
<L>To be the slave of greatness, to strike sail,</L>
<L>When, sweeping onward with her Peacock's tail,</L>
<L>QUALITY, in full plumage, passes by;</L>
<L>He views her with a fix'd, contemptuous eye,</L>
<L>And mocks the Puppet, keeps his own due state,</L>
<L>And is above conversing with the great.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<L>Perish those Slaves, those minions of the quill,</L>
<L>Who have conspir'd to seize that sacred hill</L>
<L>Where the nine Sisters pour a genuine strain,</L>
<L>And sunk the mountain level with the plain;</L>
<L>Who, with mean, private views, and servile art,</L>
<L>No spark of Virtue living in their heart,</L>
<L>Have basely turn'd Apostates, have debas'd</L>
<L>Their dignity of office, have disgrac'd,</L>
<L>Like ELI'S Sons, the altars where they stand,</L>
<L>And caus'd their name to stink thro' all the land,</L>
<L>Have stoop'd to prostitute their venal pen</L>
<L>For the support of great, but guilty men,</L>
<L>Have made the Bard, of their own vile accord,</L>
<L>Inferior to that thing we call a <HI>Lord.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What is a <HI>Lord?</HI> doth that plain, simple word</L>
<L>Contain some magic spell? as soon as heard,</L>
<L>Like an Alarum Bell on Night's dull ear,</L>
<L>Doth It strike louder, and more strong appear</L>
<L>Than other Words? whether we will or no,</L>
<L>Thro' Reason's Court doth It unquestion'd go</L>
<L>E'en on the mention, and of course transmit</L>
<L>Notions of something excellent, of Wit</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Pleasing, tho' keen, of Humour free, tho' chaste,</L>
<L>Of sterling Genius with sound Judgment grac'd,</L>
<L>Of Virtue far above temptation's Reach,</L>
<L>And Honour, which not malice can impeach?</L>
<L>Believe it not—'twas NATURE's first intent,</L>
<L>Before their rank became their punishment,</L>
<L>They should have pass'd for Men, nor blush'd to prize</L>
<L>The blessings she bestow'd—She gave them eyes,</L>
<L>And They could see—She gave them ears—they heard—</L>
<L>The Instruments of stirring, and they stirr'd—</L>
<L>Like Us, they were design'd to eat, to drink,</L>
<L>To talk, and (ev'ry now and then) to think.</L>
<L>Till They, by Pride corrupted, for the sake</L>
<L>Of Singularity, disclaim'd that make,</L>
<L>Till They, disdaining Nature's vulgar mode,</L>
<L>Flew off, and struck into another road,</L>
<L>More fitting <HI>Quality,</HI> and to our view</L>
<L>Came forth a Species altogether new,</L>
<L>Something We had not known, and could not know,</L>
<L>Like nothing of God's making here below,</L>
<L>NATURE exclaim'd with wonder<HI>—Lords</HI> are Things,</L>
<L>Which, never made by Me, were made by Kings.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<L>A <HI>Lord</HI> (nor let the honest, and the brave,</L>
<L>The true, Old Noble, with the Fool and Knave</L>
<L>Here mix his fame; curs'd be that thought of mine,</L>
<L>Which with a B—and F—should GRAFTON join)</L>
<L>A <HI>Lord</HI> (nor here let Censure rashly call</L>
<L>My just contempt of some, abuse of all,</L>
<L>And, as of <HI>late,</HI> when SODOM was my theme,</L>
<L>Slander my purpose, and my Muse blaspheme,</L>
<L>Because she stops not, rapid in her song,</L>
<L>To make exceptions as She goes along,</L>
<L>Tho' well She hopes to find, another year,</L>
<L>A whole MINORITY exceptions here)</L>
<L>A mere, mere <HI>Lord,</HI> with nothing but the name,</L>
<L>Wealth all his Worth, and Title all his Fame,</L>
<L>Lives on another man, himself a blank,</L>
<L>Thankless he lives, or must some Grandsire thank,</L>
<L>For smuggled Honours, and ill-gotten pelf;</L>
<L>A <HI>Bard</HI> owes all to Nature, and Himself.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Gods, how my Soul is burnt up with disdain,</L>
<L>When I see Men, whom PHOEBUS in his Train</L>
<L>Might view with pride, lacquey the heels of those</L>
<L>Whom Genius ranks amongst her greatest foes!</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
And what's the cause? why these same sons of scorn,</L>
<L>No thanks to them, were to a Title born,</L>
<L>And could not help it; by Chance hither sent,</L>
<L>And only Deities by accident.</L>
<L>Had fortune on our getting chanc'd to shine</L>
<L><HI>Their</HI> birthright honours had been <HI>your's,</HI> or <HI>mine.</HI></L>
<L>'Twas a mere random stroke, and should the Throne</L>
<L>Eye Thee with favour, proud and lordly grown,</L>
<L>Thou, tho' a Bard, might'st be their fellow yet,</L>
<L>But FELIX never can be made a Wit.</L>
<L>No, in good faith—that's one of those few things</L>
<L>Which Fate hath plac'd beyond the reach of Kings.</L>
<L>Bards may be Lords, but 'tis not in the cards,</L>
<L>Play how we will, to turn Lords into Bards.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A <HI>Bard—</HI>A <HI>Lord—</HI>Why let them hand in hand</L>
<L>Go forth as Friends, and travel thro' the land,</L>
<L>Observe which word the People can digest</L>
<L>Most readily, which goes to market best,</L>
<L>Which gets most credit, Whether Men will trust</L>
<L>A <HI>Bard</HI> because they think he may be just,</L>
<L>Or on a <HI>Lord</HI> will chuse to risque their gains,</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>Privilege</HI> in that point still remains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<L>A <HI>Bard—</HI>A <HI>Lord—</HI>let REASON take her Scales,</L>
<L>And fairly weigh those Words, see which prevails,</L>
<L>Which in the ballance lightly kicks the beam,</L>
<L>And which by sinking We the Victor deem.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis done, and HERMES, by command of JOVE,</L>
<L>Summons a Synod in the sacred grove,</L>
<L>Gods throng with Gods to take their chairs on high,</L>
<L>And sit in state, the Senate of the Sky,</L>
<L>Whilst, in a kind of parliament below,</L>
<L>Men stare at those above, and want to know</L>
<L>What They're transacting; REASON takes her stand</L>
<L>Just in the midst, a ballance in her hand,</L>
<L>Which o'er and o'er She tries, and finds it true;</L>
<L>From either side, conducted full in view,</L>
<L>A Man comes forth, of figure strange and queer;</L>
<L>We now and then see something like them here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>First</HI> was meager, flimsy, void of strength,</L>
<L>But Nature kindly had made up in length,</L>
<L>What She in breadth denied; Erect and proud,</L>
<L>A head and shoulders taller than the croud,</L>
<L>He deem'd them pygmies all; loose hung his skin</L>
<L>O'er his bare bones; his Face so very thin,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
So very narrow, and so much beat out,</L>
<L>That Physiognomists have made a doubt,</L>
<L>Proportion lost, Expression quite forgot,</L>
<L>Whether It could be call'd a face, or not;</L>
<L>At end of it howe'er, unbless'd with beard,</L>
<L>Some twenty fathom length of chin appear'd;</L>
<L>With Legs, which we might well conceive that Fate</L>
<L>Meant only to support a spider's weight,</L>
<L>Firmly he strove to tread, and with a stride</L>
<L>Which shew'd at once his weakness and his pride,</L>
<L>Shaking himself to pieces, seem'd to cry,</L>
<L>Observe good People, how I shake the sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In his right hand a Paper did He hold,</L>
<L>On which, at large, in characters of gold,</L>
<L>Distinct, and plain for those who run to see,</L>
<L><HI>Saint</HI> ARCHIBALD had wrote <HI>L, O, R, D.</HI></L>
<L>This, with an air of scorn, He from afar</L>
<L>Twirl'd into REASON'S scales, and on that Bar,</L>
<L>Which from his soul he hated, yet admir'd,</L>
<L>Quick turn'd his back, and as he came retir'd.</L>
<L>The Judge to all around his name declar'd;</L>
<L>Each Goddess titter'd, each God laugh'd, JOVE star'd,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
And the whole People cried, with one accord,</L>
<L>Good Heaven bless us all, is That a <HI>Lord!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such was the <HI>First—</HI>the <HI>Second</HI> was a man,</L>
<L>Whom Nature built on quite a diff'rent plan;</L>
<L>A <HI>Bear,</HI> whom from the moment he was born,</L>
<L>His Dam despis'd, and left <HI>unlick'd</HI> in scorn;</L>
<L>A <HI>Babel,</HI> which, the pow'r of Art outdone,</L>
<L>She could not finish when She had begun;</L>
<L>An utter <HI>Chaos,</HI> out of which no might</L>
<L>But that of God could strike one spark of light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Broad were his shoulders, and from blade to blade</L>
<L>A H—might at full length have laid;</L>
<L>Vast were his Bones, his Muscles twisted strong,</L>
<L>His Face was short, but broader than 'twas long,</L>
<L>His Features, tho' by Nature they were large,</L>
<L>Contentment had contriv'd to overcharge</L>
<L>And bury meaning, save that we might spy</L>
<L>Sense low'ring on the penthouse of his eye;</L>
<L>His Arms were two twin Oaks, his Legs so stout</L>
<L>That they might bear a Mansion House about,</L>
<L>Nor were They, look but at his body there,</L>
<L>Design'd by Fate a much less weight to bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
<L>O'er a brown <HI>Cassock,</HI> which had once been black,</L>
<L>Which hung in tatters on his brawny back,</L>
<L>A sight most strange, and aukward to behold</L>
<L>He threw a covering of <HI>Blue</HI> and <HI>Gold.</HI></L>
<L>Just at that time of life, when Man by rule,</L>
<L>The Fop laid down, takes up the graver fool,</L>
<L>He started up a Fop, and, fond of show,</L>
<L>Look'd like another HERCULES, turn'd <HI>Beau.</HI></L>
<L>A Subject, met with only now and then,</L>
<L>Much fitter for the pencil than the pen;</L>
<L>HOGARTH would draw him (Envy must allow)</L>
<L>E'en to the life, was HOGARTH living now.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With such accoutrements, with such a form,</L>
<L>Much like a Porpoise just before a storm,</L>
<L>Onward He roll'd; a laugh prevail'd around,</L>
<L>E'en JOVE was seen to simper; at the sound</L>
<L>(Nor was the cause unknown, for from his Youth</L>
<L>Himself he studied by the glass of Truth)</L>
<L>He join'd their mirth, nor shall the Gods condemn</L>
<L>If, whilst They laugh'd at him, he laugh'd at them.</L>
<L><HI>Judge</HI> REASON view'd him with an eye of grace,</L>
<L>Look'd thro' his soul, and quite forgot his face,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
And, from his hand receiv'd, with fair regard</L>
<L>Plac'd in her other scale the name of <HI>Bard.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then (for She did as Judges ought to do,</L>
<L>She nothing of the case beforehand knew</L>
<L>Nor wish'd to know, She never stretch'd the laws,</L>
<L>Nor, basely to anticipate a cause,</L>
<L>Compell'd Sollicitors no longer free,</L>
<L>To shew those briefs She had no right to see)</L>
<L>Then She with equal hand her scales held out,</L>
<L>Nor did the Cause one moment hang in doubt,</L>
<L>She held her scales out fair to public view;</L>
<L>The <HI>Lord,</HI> as sparks fly upwards, upwards flew,</L>
<L>More light than air, deceitful in the weight;</L>
<L>The <HI>Bard,</HI> preponderating, kept his state,</L>
<L>REASON approv'd, and with a voice, whose sound</L>
<L>Shook earth, shook heaven, on the clearest ground.</L>
<L>Pronouncing for the <HI>Bards</HI> a full decree,</L>
<L>Cried—Those must Honour <HI>Them,</HI> who honour <HI>Me,</HI></L>
<L>They from this present day, where'er I reign,</L>
<L>In their own right, Precedence shall obtain,</L>
<L><HI>Merit</HI> rules here, Be it enough that <HI>Birth</HI></L>
<L>Intoxicates, and sways the fools of earth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
<L>Nor think that here, in hatred to a Lord,</L>
<L>I've forg'd a tale, or alter'd a record;</L>
<L>Search when You will (I am not now in sport)</L>
<L>You'll find it register'd in REASON's Court.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor think that Envy here hath strung my lyre,</L>
<L>That I depreciate what I most admire,</L>
<L>And look on titles with an eye of scorn</L>
<L>Because I was not to a title born.</L>
<L>By Him that made me, I am much more proud,</L>
<L>More inly satisfied, to have a croud</L>
<L>Point at me as I pass, and cry,—that's He—</L>
<L>A poor, but honest Bard, who dares be free</L>
<L>Amidst Corruption, than to have a train</L>
<L>Of flick'ring Levee slaves, to make me vain</L>
<L>Of things I ought to blush for; to run, fly,</L>
<L>And live but in the motion of my eye;</L>
<L>When I am less than Man, my faults t'adore,</L>
<L>And make me think that I am something more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Recall past times, bring back the days of old,</L>
<L>When the great Noble bore his honours bold,</L>
<L>And in the face of peril, when He dar'd</L>
<L>Things which his legal Bastard, if declar'd,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
Might well discredit; faithful to his trust,</L>
<L>In the extremest points of Justice, Just,</L>
<L>Well-knowing All, and lov'd by All he knew,</L>
<L>True to his King, and to his Country true,</L>
<L>Honest at Court, above the baits of gain,</L>
<L>Plain in his dress, and in his manners plain,</L>
<L>Mod'rate in wealth, gen'rous but not profuse,</L>
<L>Well worthy riches, for he knew their use,</L>
<L>Possessing much, and yet deserving more,</L>
<L>Deserving those high honours, which he wore</L>
<L>With ease to all, and in return gain'd fame,</L>
<L>Which all men paid, because he did not claim,</L>
<L>When the grim War was plac'd in dread array,</L>
<L>Fierce as the Lion roaring for his prey,</L>
<L>Or Lioness of royal whelps foredone,</L>
<L>In Peace, as mild as the departing Sun,</L>
<L>A gen'ral blessing wheresoe'er he turn'd,</L>
<L>Patron of learning, nor himself unlearn'd,</L>
<L>Ever awake at Pity's tender call,</L>
<L>A Father of the Poor, a Friend to All,</L>
<L>Recall such times, and from the grave bring back</L>
<L>A Worth like this, my heart shall bend, or crack,</L>
<L>My stubborn pride give way, my tongue proclaim,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Muse conspire to swell his fame,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
Till Envy shall to him that praise allow,</L>
<L>Which She cannot deny to TEMPLE now.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This Justice claims, nor shall the Bard forget,</L>
<L>Delighted with the task, to pay that debt,</L>
<L>To pay it like a Man, and in his lays,</L>
<L>Sounding such worth, prove his own right to praise.</L>
<L>But let not Pride and Prejudice misdeem,</L>
<L>And think that empty Titles are my Theme,</L>
<L>Titles, with Me, are vain, and nothing worth,</L>
<L>I rev'rence Virtue, but I laugh at Birth.</L>
<L>Give me a Lord, that's honest, frank, and brave,</L>
<L>I am his friend, but cannot be his slave.</L>
<L>Tho' none indeed but Blockheads would pretend</L>
<L>To make a slave, where they may make a friend.</L>
<L>I love his Virtues, and will make them known,</L>
<L>Confess his rank, but can't forget my own.</L>
<L>Give me a Lord, who, to a Title born,</L>
<L>Boasts nothing else, I'll pay him scorn with scorn.</L>
<L>What, shall my Pride (and Pride is Virtue here)</L>
<L>Tamely make way, if such a wretch appear?</L>
<L>Shall I uncover'd stand, and bend my knee</L>
<L>To such a shadow of Nobility,</L>

<L>A Shred, a Remnant; he might rot unknown</L>

<L>Had He not worn by chance his Father's coat?</L>
<L>To think a M—worth my least regards</L>
<L>Is treason to the <HI>Majesty</HI> of <HI>Bards.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By NATURE form'd (when for her Honour' sake</L>
<L>She something more than common strove to make,</L>
<L>When, overlooking each minute defect,</L>
<L>And all too eager to be quite correct,</L>
<L>In her full heat and vigour, she imprest</L>
<L>Her stamp most strongly on the favour'd breast)</L>
<L>The <HI>Bard</HI> (nor think too lightly that I mean</L>
<L>Those little, piddling Witlings, who o'erween</L>
<L>Of their small parts, the MURPHYS of the stage,</L>
<L>The MASONS and the WHITEHEADS of the age,</L>
<L>Who all in raptures their own works rehearse,</L>
<L>And drawl out measur'd prose, which They call verse)</L>
<L>The real <HI>Bard,</HI> whom native Genius fires,</L>

<L>I'm very sensible he's mad in Law.</L>
<L>A saucy Groom who trades in Reason, thus</L>
<L>To set himself upon a <HI>Par</HI> with us;</L>
<L>If this <HI>here's</HI> suffer'd, and if that <HI>there</HI> fool</L>
<L>May when he pleases send us all to school,</L>

<HI>Why</HI> then our only business is outright</L>
<L>To take our caps, and bid the World good night.</L>
<L>I've kept a <HI>Bard</HI> myself <HI>this</HI> twenty years,</L>
<L>But nothing of this kind in him appears.</L>
<L>He, like a thorough true-bred Spaniel, licks</L>
<L>The hand which cuffs him, and the foot which kicks,</L>
<L>He fetches, and he carries, blacks my shoes,</L>
<L>Nor thinks it a discredit to his Muse,</L>
<L>A Creature of the right Camelion hue,</L>
<L>He wears my colours, yellow or true Blue,</L>
<L>Just as I wear them; 'tis all one to him,</L>
<L>Whether I change thro' conscience, or thro' whim.</L>
<L>Now this is something like, on such a plan</L>
<L>A <HI>Bard</HI> may find a friend in a great Man;</L>
<L>But this proud Coxcomb—Zounds, I thought that All</L>

<L>Injurious Thought! accursed be the tongue</L>

<L>Talk not of Custom—'tis the Coward's plea,</L>
<L>Current with Fools, but passes not with me;</L>
<L>An old stale trick, which guilt hath often tried</L>

<L>No matter when, down to the present time,</L>
<L>As by th' original decree of Fate,</L>

<L>E'en VIRGIL to MAECENAS paid his court.</L>
<L>As to the Custom 'tis a point agreed,</L>

<L>They mention him as if to use his name</L>
<L>Was in some measure to partake his fame,</L>
<L>Tho' VIRGIL, was he living, in the street</L>
<L>Might rot for them, or perish in the <HI>Fleet.</HI></L>
<L>See how They redden, and the charge disclaim—</L>
<L><HI>Virgil,</HI> and in the <HI>Fleet—</HI>forbid it Shame.</L>
<L>Hence, Ye vain Boasters, to the <HI>Fleet</HI> repair,</L>
<L>And ask, with blushes ask, if LLOYD is there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Patrons, in days of yore, were Men of Sense,</L>
<L>Were Men of Taste, and had a fair pretence</L>
<L>To rule in Letters—Some of Them were heard</L>
<L>To read off-hand, and never spell a word;</L>
<L>Some of them too, to such a monstrous height</L>
<L>Was Learning risen, for themselves could write,</L>
<L>And kept their Secretaries, as the Great</L>
<L>Do many other foolish things, for State.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
<L>Our Patrons are of quite a diff'rent strain,</L>
<L>With neither sense nor Taste, against the grain,</L>
<L>They patronize for fashion sake—no more—</L>
<L>And keep a <HI>Bard,</HI> just as They keep a <HI>Whore.</HI></L>
<L>M—(on such occasion I am loth</L>
<L>To name the dead) was a rare proof of both.</L>
<L>Some of them would be puzzled e'en to read,</L>
<L>Nor could deserve their <HI>Clergy</HI> by their <HI>Creed;</HI></L>
<L>Others can write, but such a <HI>Pagan</HI> hand</L>
<L>A WILLES should always at our elbow stand;</L>
<L>Many, if begg'd, A <HI>Chancellor,</HI> of right,</L>
<L>Would order into keeping at first sight.</L>
<L>Those who stand fairest to the public view</L>
<L>Take to themselves the praise to others due,</L>
<L>They rob the very <HI>Spital,</HI> and make free</L>
<L>With those alas who've least to spare—We see,</L>
<L>—hath not had a word to say,</L>
<L>Since Winds and Waves bore SINGLESPEECH away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Patrons in days of yore, like Patrons now,</L>
<L>Expected that the <HI>Bard</HI> should make his bow</L>
<L>At coming in, and ev'ry now and then</L>
<L>Hint to the world that They were more than men,</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="22"/>
But, like the Patrons of the present day,</L>
<L>They never bilk'd the Poet of his pay.</L>
<L>VIRGIL lov'd rural ease, and, far from harm,</L>
<L>MAECENAS fix'd him in a neat, snug farm,</L>
<L>Where he might, free from trouble, pass his days</L>
<L>In his own way, and pay his rent in praise.</L>
<L>HORACE lov'd wine, and, thro' his friend at Court,</L>
<L>Could buy it off the Key in ev'ry port;</L>
<L>HORACE lov'd mirth, MAECENAS lov'd it too,</L>
<L>They met, they laugh'd, as GOY and I may do,</L>
<L>Nor in those moments paid the least regard</L>
<L>To which was <HI>Minister,</HI> and which was <HI>Bard.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not so our Patrons—grave as grave can be,</L>
<L>They <HI>know themselves,</HI> They keep up <HI>dignity;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Bards</HI> are a forward race, nor is it fit</L>
<L>That Men of fortune rank with men of Wit;</L>
<L>Wit if familiar made, will find her strength—</L>
<L>'Tis best to keep her weak, and at arm's length.</L>
<L>'Tis well enough for <HI>Bards,</HI> if Patrons give,</L>
<L>From hand to mouth, the scanty means to live.</L>
<L>Such is their language, and their practice such,</L>
<L>They promise little, and they give not much.</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="23"/>
Let the weak <HI>Bard,</HI> with prostituted strain,</L>
<L>Praise that proud SCOT, whom all good men disdain;</L>
<L>What's his reward? Why, his own fame undone,</L>
<L>He may obtain a patent for the run</L>
<L>Of his Lord's kitchen, and have ample time,</L>
<L>With offal fed, to court the Cook in rime,</L>
<L>Or (if he strives true Patriots to disgrace)</L>
<L>May at the <HI>second</HI> Table get a place,</L>
<L>With somewhat greater slaves allow'd to dine,</L>
<L>And play at CRAMBO o'er his gill of wine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And are there <HI>Bards,</HI> who on Creation's file</L>
<L>Stand rank'd as Men, who breathe in this fair Isle</L>
<L>The air of Freedom, with so little gall,</L>
<L>So low a Spirit, prostrate thus to fall</L>
<L>Before these Idols, and without a groan</L>
<L>Bear wrongs might call forth murmurs from a stone?</L>
<L>Better, and much more noble, to abjure</L>
<L>The sight of men, and in some cave, secure</L>
<L>From all the outrages of pride, to feast</L>
<L>On Nature's sallads, and be free at least.</L>
<L>Better (tho' that, to say the truth, is worse</L>
<L>Than almost any other modern curse)</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="24"/>
Discard all Sense, divorce the thankless Muse,</L>
<L>Critics commence, and write in the <HI>Reviews,</HI></L>
<L>Write without tremor, GRIFFITHS cannot read;</L>
<L>No Fool can fail, where LANGHORNE can succeed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But (not to make a brave and honest Pride</L>
<L>Try those means first, She must disdain when tried)</L>
<L>There are a thousand ways, a thousand arts,</L>
<L>By which, and fairly, Men of real parts</L>
<L>May gain a living, gain what Nature craves;</L>
<L>Let Those, who pine for more, live, and be slaves.</L>
<L>Our real wants in a small compass lye,</L>
<L>But lawless Appetite with eager eye,</L>
<L>Kept in a constant Fever, more requires,</L>
<L>And we are burnt up with our own desires.</L>
<L>Hence our dependence, hence our slav'ry springs;</L>
<L><HI>Bards,</HI> if contented, are as great as Kings.</L>
<L>Ourselves are to Ourselves the cause of ill;</L>
<L>We may be Independent, if we will.</L>
<L>The Man who suits his Spirit to his state</L>
<L>Stands on an equal footing with the Great,</L>
<L>MOGULS themselves are not more rich, and He,</L>
<L>Who rules the English nation, not more free.</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="25"/>
Chains were not forg'd more durable and strong</L>
<L>For <HI>Bards</HI> than others, but They've worne them along,</L>
<L>And therefore wear them still, They've quite forgot</L>
<L>What Freedom is, and therefore prize her not.</L>
<L>Could They, tho' in their sleep, could They but know</L>
<L>The blessings which from INDEPENDENCE flow,</L>
<L>Could They but have a short and transient gleam</L>
<L>Of LIBERTY, tho' 'twas but in a dream,</L>
<L>They would no more in bondage bend their knee,</L>
<L>But, once made Freemen, would be always free.</L>
<L>The Muse if She one moment freedom gains,</L>
<L>Can never more submit to sing in chains.</L>
<L>Bred in a cage, far from the seather'd throng,</L>
<L>The Bird repays his keeper with his song,</L>
<L>But, if some playful child sets wide the door,</L>
<L>Abroad he flies, and thinks of home no more,</L>
<L>With love of Liberty begins to burn,</L>
<L>And rather starves than to his cage return.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Hail</HI> INDEPENDENCE—by true Reason taught,</L>
<L>How few have known, and priz'd Thee as They ought.</L>
<L>Some give Thee up for riot; Some, like Boys,</L>
<L>Resign Thee, in their childish moods, for toys</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="26"/>
Ambition some, some Avarice misleads,</L>
<L>And in both cases INDEPENDENCE bleeds;</L>
<L>Abroad, in quest of Thee, how many roam</L>
<L>Nor know They had Thee in their reach at home;</L>
<L>Some, tho' about their paths, their beds about,</L>
<L>Have never had the Sense to find Thee out;</L>
<L>Others, who know of what They are possess'd,</L>
<L>Like fearful Misers, lock Thee in a chest,</L>
<L>Nor have the resolution to produce</L>
<L>In these bad times, and bring Thee forth for use.</L>
<L><HI>Hail,</HI> INDEPENDENCE—tho' thy name's scarce known,</L>
<L>Tho' Thou, Alas! art out of fashion grown,</L>
<L>Tho' All despise Thee, I will not despise,</L>
<L>Nor live one moment longer than I prize</L>
<L>Thy presence, and enjoy; by angry Fate</L>
<L>Bow'd down, and almost crush'd, <HI>Thou</HI> cam'st, tho' late,</L>
<L><HI>Thou</HI> cam'st upon me, like a second birth,</L>
<L>And made me know what life was truly worth.</L>
<L><HI>Hail,</HI> INDEPENDENCE—never may my Cot,</L>
<L>Till I forget Thee, be by Thee forgot;</L>
<L>Thither, O Thither, oftentimes repair;</L>
<L>COTES, whom Thou lovest too, shall meet Thee there;</L>
<L>All thoughts, but what arise from joy, give o'er;</L>
<L>PEACE dwells within, and LAW shall guard the door.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
<L>O'erweening Bard! LAW guard thy door, what LAW?</L>
<L>The LAW of ENGLAND—To controul, and awe</L>
<L>Those saucy hopes, to strike that Spirit dumb,</L>
<L>Behold, in State, ADMINISTRATION come.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why let Her come, in all her terrors too;</L>
<L>I dare to suffer all She dares to do.</L>
<L>I know her malice well, and know her pride,</L>
<L>I know her strength, but will not change my side.</L>
<L>This melting mass of flesh She may controul</L>
<L>With iron ribs, She cannot chain my Soul.</L>
<L>No—to the last resolv'd her worst to bear,</L>
<L>I'm still at large, and <HI>Independent</HI> there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where is this Minister? where is the band</L>
<L>Of ready slaves, who at his elbow stand</L>
<L>To hear, and to perform his wicked will?</L>
<L>Why, for the first time, are they slow to ill?</L>
<L>When some grand act 'gainst Law is to be done,</L>
<L>Doth—sleep; doth Bloodhound—run</L>
<L>To L—, and worry those small deer</L>
<L>When He might do more precious mischief here?</L>
<L>Doth—turn tail? doth He refuse to draw</L>
<L>Illegal warrants, and to call them Law?</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="28"/>
Doth—, at G—d kick'd, from G—d run,</L>
<L>With that cold lump of unbak'd dough, his Son,</L>
<L>And, his more honest rival, KETCH to cheat</L>
<L>Purchase a burial place where three ways meet?</L>
<L>Believe it not;—is—still,</L>
<L>And never sleeps, when he should wake to ill;</L>
<L>—doth lesser mischiess by the bye,</L>
<L>The great Ones till the Term in <HI>Petto</HI> lie;</L>
<L>—lives, and, to the strictest justice true,</L>
<L>Scorns to defraud the Hangman of his due.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O my poor COUNTRY—weak and overpow'r'd</L>
<L>By thine own Sons—eat to the bone—devour'd</L>
<L>By Vipers, which, in thine own entrails bred,</L>
<L>Prey on thy life, and with thy blood are fed,</L>
<L>With unavailing grief thy wrongs I see,</L>
<L>And, for myself not feeling, feel for <HI>Thee.</HI></L>
<L>I grieve, but can't despair—for, Lo, at hand</L>
<L>FREEDOM presents a choice, but faithful band</L>
<L>Of <HI>Loyal</HI> PATRIOTS, Men who greatly dare</L>
<L>In such a noble cause, Men fit to bear</L>
<L>The weight of Empires; <HI>Fortune, Rank,</HI> and <HI>Sense,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Knowledge,</HI> leagu'd with <HI>Eloquence,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="29"/>
March in their ranks; FREEDOM from file to file</L>
<L>Darts her delighted eye, and with a smile</L>
<L>Approves her honest Sons, whilst down her cheek,</L>
<L>As 'twere by stealth (her heart too full to speak)</L>
<L>One Tear in silence creeps, one honest Tear,</L>
<L>And seems to say, Why is not GRANBY here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Ye brave <HI>Few,</HI> in whom we still may find</L>
<L>A Love of Virtue, Freedom, and Mankind,</L>
<L>Go forth—in Majesty of Woe array'd,</L>
<L>See, at your feet Your COUNTRY kneels for aid,</L>
<L>And, (many of her children traitors grown,)</L>
<L>Kneels to those Sons She still can call her own,</L>
<L>Seeming to breathe her last in ev'ry breath,</L>
<L>She kneels for Freedom, or She begs for Death—</L>
<L>Fly then, each duteous Son, each English Chief,</L>
<L>And to your drooping Parent bring relief.</L>
<L>Go forth—nor let the Siren voice of ease</L>
<L>Tempt Ye to sleep, whilst tempests swell the seas;</L>
<L>Go forth—nor let Hypocrisy, whose tongue</L>
<L>With many a fair, false, fatal art is hung,</L>
<L>Like Bethel's fawning Prophet, cross your way,</L>
<L>When your great Errand brooks not of delay;</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="30"/>
Nor let vain Fear, who cries to all She meets,</L>
<L>Trembling and pale—A Lion in the streets—</L>
<L>Damp your free Spirits; let not threats affright,</L>
<L>Nor Bribes corrupt, nor Flatteries delight.</L>
<L>Be as One Man—CONCORD success ensures—</L>
<L>There's not an English heart but what is Your's.</L>
<L>Go forth—and VIRTUE, ever in your sight,</L>
<L>Shall be your guide by day, your guard by night—</L>
<L>Go forth—the Champions of your native land,</L>
<L>And may the battle prosper in your hand—</L>
