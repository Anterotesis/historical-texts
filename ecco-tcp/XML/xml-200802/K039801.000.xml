<HEAD>TO THE GREATEST COXCOMB AND MOST FINISH'D COQUETTE Living.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR and MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has long been, and still remains a settled Rule with AUTHORS, to chuse the most conspicuous Characters for Patrons; thus far I comply with general Custom, which, however ridiculous, it is dan∣gerous to break through; as to the trite Panegyrics of Dedication, they seem absolutely unnecessary upon the present Occasion, for your Virtues,—Qualifications I mean, are so very generally known, that they require not any Illustration, being sufficient Blazon to themselves; therefore it will be sufficient to observe, that to your great Predecessors, the DRAMA is obliged for many of its most stri∣king Characters. To you, and your courtly Tribe of Imitators, we stand indebted for the frequent, curious Amendments of FASHION, and Machinations of LOVE; also for OPERAS, BURLETTAS, MAS∣QUERADES, PANTOMIMES, DRUMS, ROUTS, with a long &amp;c. of <HI>Time-killing</HI> Amusements; and last, <HI>though not least in Love,</HI> for the following Tale founded on your Systems of Life, which Circum∣stance must particularly recommend it to your most indulgent Pa∣tronage.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
'TIS true I may appear in this Address as an INDIAN worshipping the Devil, however that may be, it will evidently follow from One Consideration, that I have an undoubted Right to claim your Pa∣tronage, when I declare that many Actions of my own Life have been truly <HI>Coxcomical,</HI> and perhaps not One of them more so than my Compliance with the <HI>Cacoethes Scribendi,</HI> which urged me to commence AUTHOR▪ especially a Poetical or Versifying One.</P>
<P>I am, with all due Respect, as a Writer, and sincere Affection, as <HI>Relation,</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your most obedient, And devoted Servant,
The <HI>AUTHOR.</HI></SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>I had almost dated this Address, <HI>April</HI> the <HI>First,</HI> but being sensible that it was giving the CRITICS a fair Opportunity to honour me with the <HI>Title</HI> of the <HI>Day,</HI> I step Four and Twenty Hours forward in the Year 1754.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ADVERTISEMENT</HI> TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>KNOWING from personal Experience how apt prefatory Matter is to pall, I shall no farther intrude upon the Leisure of my Readers than briefly to observe, that the following Narration is founded on Truth; that it is related, exclusive of an Alteration in the Catastrophe of <HI>NARCISSA,</HI> with strict Fidelity. What Merit there may be in it, I shall leave the Public to decide; I am well apprized that the Characters will seem somewhat imperfect, particularly <HI>ELIZA,</HI> who does not appear sufficiently to constitute a Principal; but I hope to be excused any Error of this Kind, though voluntary, as I found Prolixity stealing in upon me, which I was resolved at any Rate to avoid.</P>
<P>I should perhaps have thrown the Incidents together in Prose, but that I think the Town already too much harrassed with <HI>MEMOIRS, ADVEN∣TURES,</HI> &amp;c. This is a Sort of Deviation, and I hope some Persons of stronger Genius than I imagine myself to be will communicate Pictures of Life in poetical Narratives.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, as I know many Faults must appear, I earnestly request that every judicious Reader will make such Amendments as seem necessary, and render it, if possible, agreeable to his or her Taste, believing I should have done the same, had it been in my Power.</P>

<LG>
<L>INDULGENT Muse, to whom my Soul repairs,</L>
<L>As gentle Antidote of all its Cares;</L>
<L>Thou calm Recess of an o'erburthen'd Mind,</L>
<L>The Chains of rough Adversity unbind.</L>
<L>Then to forget myself I ask thy Aid,</L>
<L>Oh! snatch me from the Gloom of Fortune's Shade;</L>
<L>For tender Fancy struggles hard to rise,</L>
<L>Through the sharp Gales and Frosts of wint'ry Skies,</L>
<L>Bear from dull Earth on thy expanded Wing,</L>
<L>And teach thy humble Proselyte to sing;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="10"/>
With sprightly Elegance of Thought inspire,</L>
<L>Enflame my Bosom with poetic Fire,</L>
<L>Strike with bold Imag'ry, and tune my Verse,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>ANSELMO wearied with a trading Life,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to fly Solicitude and Strife;</L>
<L>To lay the anxious Cares of Business down,</L>
<L>And shun the Bustle of the noisy Town.</L>
<L>Nature had mingled in ANSELMO'S Frame,</L>
<L>A Love of Virtue, and Contempt of Fame;</L>
<L>Grave without Pride, though prudent, not severe,</L>
<L>Of Honour boundless, and of Judgment clear;</L>
<L>To Censure slow, to Pardon always free,</L>
<L>The Friend of Mankind, and of Liberty:</L>
<L>Who could, with equal Honesty, despise</L>
<L>The Fools of Pow'r, or the corrupted Wise;</L>
<L>A venal Commoner, or lordly Knave,</L>
<L>A mitred Deist, or a willing Slave.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="11"/>
A grapling Miser, or a Spendthrift Heir,</L>
<L>An impious Rake-hell, or abandon'd Fair,</L>
<L>A shameless Sinner, or affected Saint,</L>
<L>A Mind of Fallacy, or Face of Paint.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FORTUNE had bless'd him with sufficient Store,</L>
<L>And REASON wisely told him, seek no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE chose a lonely, yet delightful Seat,</L>
<L>Where ev'ry Comfort crown'd the bless'd Retreat;</L>
<L>Where Joys, unknown to pompous Pride and Pow'r,</L>
<L>Danc'd on the Wings of ev'ry passing Hour.</L>
<L>Content, the Goddess of supreme Delight,</L>
<L>Still cheer'd the Day, and balm'd the happy Night.</L>
<L>Here safe calm Peace could smile at distant Wars,</L>
<L>The Cannon's Thunder and loud Statesmen's Jars.</L>
<L>Religion here divested of all Art,</L>
<L>Conjoin'd with Reason to amend the Heart,</L>
<L>Just in her Tenets, in her Doctrine clear,</L>
<L>Placid in Zeal, not formally severe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
<L>HERE Charity, in all her native Charms,</L>
<L>Call'd faint Distress to her enliv'ning Arms;</L>
<L>Dispers'd the Cloud of Woe with sun-like Beams,</L>
<L>And scatter'd Bounty in diffusive Streams.</L>
<L>No Widow here, e'er bootless told her Pain,</L>
<L>No helpless Orphan stream'd with Tears in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ANSELMO had but one remaining Care,</L>
<L>Of which two Daughters claim'd an equal Share,</L>
<L>The Elder deem'd beyond Description fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NARCISSA, so the lovely Nymph we call,</L>
<L>In Shape was delicate, in Stature tall;</L>
<L>Her blooming Cheeks made pale the Tyrian Dye,</L>
<L>And Cupids ambush'd in each sparkling Eye;</L>
<L>With ev'ry Glance flew forth a golden Dart,</L>
<L>The certain Conquest of a wounded Heart.</L>
<L>Her Charms diffus'd a World of pleasing Pains,</L>
<L>And fetter'd, half Mankind in am'rous Chains.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="13" MS="y"/>
Each public Place re-echo'd with her Fame,</L>
<L>And thriving Vintners bless'd her lucky Name;</L>
<L>For Sons of Bacchus holding her Divine,</L>
<L>Pouring Libations, empti'd Tons of Wine.</L>
<L>To shew his Taste in panegyric Lays;</L>
<L>Each Witling strove to celebrate her Praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BEAUS with their Taylors', and their Barbers' Aid,</L>
<L>For Beaus are but mechanically made;</L>
<L>In foppish Emulation vainly strove,</L>
<L>To catch the Fair One's Eye, and win her Love.</L>
<L>While she convinc'd of her extensive Pow'r,</L>
<L>Studied to gain new Conquests ev'ry Hour.</L>
<L>A Thousand little practis'd Arts she tries;</L>
<L>CUPID the PROTEUS of her varying Eyes,</L>
<L>Veil'd in the Ambush of their dazling Rays,</L>
<L>Fill'd each Beholder with an am'rous blaze,</L>
<L>While she with Pride beheld each subject Swain,</L>
<L>With Rapture saw, and triumph'd in his Pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="14" MS="y"/>
<L>PALE Envy sat on ev'ry Female Brow,</L>
<L>To see those Charms which Envy must allow,</L>
<L>NARCISSA'S Beauty Rivals <HI>would</HI> not see,</L>
<L>But thus anatomiz'd her over Tea.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HERE One can plainly in Complexion trace,</L>
<L>Undoubted Symptons of a borrow'd Face;</L>
<L>The next a Dart of Criticism throws,</L>
<L>Against the Disproportion of her Nose;</L>
<L>A Third's sarcastic on her jetty Hair,</L>
<L>A Fourth discovers her immodest Stare;</L>
<L>A Fifth, for not one Atom can escape,</L>
<L>Distorts maliciously her matchless Shape;</L>
<L>A Sixth, to sum up all, with Heart elate</L>
<L>Descants at large upon her awkward Gait.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS feeble Envy like a sable Cloud,</L>
<L>Which strives the Sun's enliv'ning Rays to shrowd</L>
<L>Labour'd t'envelop with its tainting Shade,</L>
<L>The radiant Beauties of this lovely Maid;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="15" MS="y"/>
But as the God of Day triumphant reigns,</L>
<L>His Beams unsullied with polluting Stains,</L>
<L>Thus shone the Maid through Scandal's pois'nous Gloom,</L>
<L>In all the Lustre of Meridian Bloom;</L>
<L>Though clog'd with Malice, still she soar'd above,</L>
<L>Hail'd as the Shrine of universal Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No Wonder, if NARCISSA forc'd to leave,</L>
<L>The Mart of Beauty, should reluctant grieve;</L>
<L>To yield the Spoil of Three coquetted Years,</L>
<L>Call'd forth the Tribute of some pearly Tears.</L>
<L>She wept, she murmur'd at the hard Decree,</L>
<L>So inconsistent with her Gaiety:</L>
<L>She found no Pleasure in the rural Plains;</L>
<L>Reflection suited not her want of Brains;</L>
<L>For oh!—though sad the Truth we must declare,</L>
<L>This lovely Maid so exquisitely fair;</L>
<L>Whose sparkling Eyes could Joy, or Pain dispense,</L>
<L>Wanted the Attribute of <HI>Common-Sense;</HI></L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="16"/>
And self-sufficient, like all other Fools,</L>
<L>Still soar'd beyond the mean constraint of Rules.</L>
<L>Reason's sage dictates still she could resist,</L>
<L>And just had Head enough to play at WHIST.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ANSELMO saw her Levity with Pain,</L>
<L>And often spoke, but always spoke in vain.</L>
<L>She had been told a Sire declin'd in Age,</L>
<L>Near to his Exit from this mortal Stage;</L>
<L>Should not with antiquated Rules controul,</L>
<L>The modish Sallies of a Daughter's Soul.</L>
<L>The Joys of boundless Liberty she chose,</L>
<L>And look'd on <HI>prudent</HI> Friends, as <HI>envious</HI> Foes:</L>
<L>A Father's Care, her Folly deem'd his Vice,</L>
<L>And call'd restraining Love his Avarice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ELIZA, Sister to this witless Thing,</L>
<L>This flimsey Butterfly with gilded Wing,</L>
<L>Fell far beneath in the external Part,</L>
<L>Yet rose superior in an honest Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="17" MS="y"/>
<L>THOUGH Nature furnish'd not those fleeting Charms,</L>
<L>Which Sickness oft, but surely Age disarms;</L>

<L>A Mind, to no unruly Passion, Slave,</L>
<L>The great, and just Equivalent she gave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IN strict Compliance did ELIZA move,</L>
<L>With filial Piety, and kindred Love;</L>
<L>Though youngest, took a Housewife's homely Care,</L>
<L>Nor would her Sister ever deign to share:</L>

<L>With chearful Countenance she would resort,</L>

<L>And sometimes gaily join, as if by Chance,</L>
<L>In the rude Measures of the rustic Dance:</L>

<L>To quit the Country for the gayer Town,</L>
<L>Where various Pleasures, various Minutes crown,</L>
<L>Where, as she said, there are a thousand Ways,</L>
<L>As Drums and Balls, and Masquerades and Plays,</L>

<L>No less his happy Attributes cou'd gain;</L>
<L>For though the Knowledge of this titled Prig,</L>
<L>Could climb but to a fashionable Wig;</L>
<L>Though Books he little knew, and Virtue less;</L>
<L>He was an Adept in the Art of Dress;</L>
<L>His Cloaths were glaring; he could dance and game,</L>
<L>Swear, fawn, and lie, untouch'd with conscious Shame;</L>
<L>To these, a paltry Cunning we may add,</L>
<L>Which shew'd a worthless Head, and Heart as bad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE saw the Failings of NARCISSA'S Mind,</L>
<L>To all the Dictates of Discretion, blind;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="26"/>
At Cards he watch'd the Motions of her Soul,</L>
<L>And saw her variegated Passions roll;</L>
<L>Saw gay Success her lovely Face embloom,</L>
<L>And Disappointment all her Beauties gloom;</L>
<L>With Love of Play he join'd her boundless Pride,</L>
<L>And craftily appointed them his Guide;</L>
<L>By their Assistance he resolv'd to move,</L>
<L>And humble this proud Citadel of Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HIS Scheme propos'd, at length the Siege began;</L>
<L>The Lady too had form'd a previous Plan;</L>
<L>And all the Motions of each Side confess,</L>
<L>Both Parties well acquainted with Finesse.</L>
<L>He still approached in Love's sincerest 'Guise,</L>
<L>She play'd th'Artillery of sparkling Eyes;</L>
<L><HI>He</HI> breath'd his Vows with a pathetic Grace,</L>
<L><HI>She</HI> deign'd to listen with a smiling Face;</L>
<L>And then was most particularly gay,</L>
<L>When he politely lost his Stakes at Play.</L>
<L>Much Time elaps'd without a Conquest gain'd,</L>
<L>For both alike invincible remain'd;</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="27"/>
NARCISSA would have yielded as a Wife,</L>
<L>But then CAMILLO lov'd a single Life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHILE Matters thus remain'd in dubious Sense,</L>
<L>And both were almost wearied with Suspense;</L>
<L>Misfortune, which too often will prevail,</L>
<L>Cast a large Balance in his Lordship's Scale.</L>
<L>NARCISSSA rising from her Bed one Morn,</L>
<L>Gay as those Beams which Eastern Hills adorn;</L>
<L>Successive Pleasures justling in her Brain,</L>
<L>Found the gay Prospect of Idea vain;</L>
<L>And with a sudden Shock of ruthless Fate,</L>
<L>Fell from the Glory of her dazling Height.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A LETTER came, suppos'd the Sacrifise,</L>
<L>Of some poor Swain, the Captive of her Eyes.</L>
<L>She cry'd,—A <HI>Lady</HI> FANCIFUL in Mind,—</L>
<L>"Oh wherefore was I born to plague Mankind."</L>
<L>With gentle Indolence she broke the Seal,</L>
<L>Unknowing what her Vanity must feel;</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="28"/>
When lo! in fatal Characters she read,</L>
<L>That Bankrupt PHILO, her Trustee, was fled;</L>
<L>That with her Fortune all her Hopes were dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AMAZE and Madness trembled in her Face,</L>
<L>And crowding Passions gave each other Chace;</L>
<L>First silent Horror took its chilly Reign,</L>
<L>And icicled her Blood through ev'ry Vein;</L>
<L>Her shudd'ring Limbs an aguish Soul confess'd,</L>
<L>Then climbing Rage enflam'd her tender Breast;</L>
<L>At last the Thunder-cloud of Nature breaks,</L>
<L>In briny Torrents down her pallid Cheeks.</L>
<L>In hopes to mitigate her raging Pain,</L>
<L>At Intervals she read her Fate again;</L>
<L>But where th'unhappy Fair One sought Relief,</L>
<L>She met the Confirmation of her Grief.</L>
<L>Four restless Days and sleepless Nights she pass'd,</L>
<L>And wish'd each Woe fraught Minute was her last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A CROWD of Visitors approach'd her Door,</L>
<L>Yet unacquainted with her being Poor;</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="29"/>
But all the Servants were desir'd to tell,</L>
<L>Each courtly Friend, their Lady was not well;</L>
<L>A Thousand Cards of Compliments there came,</L>
<L>In Language and Sincerity the same.</L>
<L>Perplex'd NARCISSA no Asylum knew,</L>
<L>Through the maz'd Labyrinth of Thought she flew;</L>
<L>But no kind Hope its cheering Beam wou'd shew,</L>
<L>Through the Dark Cloud of her obscuring Woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS hunted by Misfortune to a Bay,</L>
<L>Distraction led, and she pursu'd the Way;</L>
<L>Resolv'd by des'prate Means to keep her State,</L>
<L>Or fall a Victim of relentless Fate.</L>
<L>So acts the lordly Tyrant of the Wood,</L>
<L>When Hunters seek to revel in his Blood,</L>
<L>A dangerous, unequal Fight he tries,</L>
<L>And lives triumphant, or triumphant dies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE fair unfortunate her Stock look'd o'er,</L>
<L>And found two hundred Guineas all her Store;</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="30"/>
On this small Pittance strait she sallied out,</L>
<L>With eager Haste to Lady GAMEWELL'S Route;</L>
<L>In all the Splendor of an Eastern Bride,</L>
<L>And her false Spirits deck'd in falser Pride.</L>
<L>Each told how much her Absence had been mourn'd,</L>
<L>And complimented on her Health return'd;</L>
<L>But above all CAMILLO vow'd his Pain,</L>
<L>And said that Joy return'd with her again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To Cards in Parties all with Speed retir'd,</L>
<L>Each Bosom with a Love of Gain inspir'd;</L>
<L>Here eager Hope appears in eager Eyes;</L>
<L>See, in one Trick the gay Delusion flies.</L>
<L>There angry Looks dark Discontent betray,</L>
<L>One luckless Card can strike with pale Dismay.</L>
<L>Now some with jocund Hearts their Bets receive,</L>
<L>While those who lose, with trembling Fingers give.</L>
<L>A gen'ral Silence rul'd external Parts,</L>
<L>Yet various Tumults reign'd in various Hearts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="23" REF="31"/>
<L>FORTUNE reviews their anxious Fears and Wiles,</L>
<L>And justly at the mad Assembly smiles.</L>
<L>Yet undetermin'd where Success to bring,</L>
<L>Sometime she flutter'd on a dubious Wing;</L>
<L>At length by Accident she chanc'd to light,</L>
<L>Blessing NARCISSA with a golden Flight.</L>
<L>Five Hundred Guineas with harmonious Notes,</L>
<L>Beyond the Warblings of Italian Throats,</L>
<L>Chink'd in her Ears, and to th'enliv'ning Sound</L>
<L>Her new-born Spirits beat a nimble Round;</L>
<L>Her Joy-fill'd Eyes look'd eminently gay,</L>
<L>And though unrested, rival'd rising Day.</L>
<L>CAMILLO saw the Transports of her Breast,</L>
<L>And with mean Art a Sympathy profess'd;</L>
<L>Swore <HI>her</HI> Success much greater Pleasure gave,</L>
<L>Than any Flow of Fortune <HI>he</HI> cou'd have;</L>
<L>Vow'd her Content superior to his own,</L>
<L>And that her Joys to him were Joys alone;</L>
<L>Then proudly usher'd the victorious Fair,</L>
<L>And led the Way to her attending Chair.</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="32"/>
Requested Leave to visit her at Home,</L>
<L>She smil'd Assent, and told him, "He might come."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now all departing to their Beds retreated,</L>
<L>Both those with Conquest crown'd, and those defeated;</L>
<L>But diff'rent Fortunes, diff'rent Vigils kept,</L>
<L>And hardly one of either Party slept.</L>
<L>Here Rest was murder'd in the Loser's Pain,</L>
<L>There conquer'd by exhilerating Gain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>TRUE to the Touch, that Day his Lordship came,</L>
<L>To paint his inextinguishable Flame;</L>
<L>NARCISSA on precarious Footing plac'd,</L>
<L>Thought it imprudent to be coyly c h ste,</L>
<L>Therefore politically cast aside,</L>
<L>Affected Levity and distant Pride.</L>
<L>Therefore with grave Attention heard his Tale,</L>
<L>Convinc'd her Eyes must certainly prevail;</L>
<L>Convinc'd, the Lover to escape his Pains,</L>
<L>Wou'd nooze himself in matrimonial Chains,</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="33"/>
Each Day he visited, each Day she thought</L>
<L>The Period of Advancement nearer brought;</L>
<L>But, ah! weak Maid, in all her Projects vain,</L>
<L>Love struck her Heart, without a Sense of Pain;</L>
<L>Love of the gay Deceiver gently stole,</L>
<L>And unperceiv'd enthrall'd her roving Soul;</L>
<L>The Sigh affected once, sincerely heaves,</L>
<L>CAMILLO flatters, and NARCISSA b'lieves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN he beheld the Captive in his Pow'r,</L>
<L>He villainously seiz'd a pliant Hour;</L>
<L>When pow'rful Nature bore imperial Sway,</L>
<L>And her dilated Mind was freely gay:</L>
<L>Then with the Force of stimulative Art,</L>
<L>Enfeebl'd Reason, and enflam'd her Heart;</L>
<L>Down, with false Vows, her struggling Virtue bore,</L>
<L>Enjoy'd his utmost Wish, and sigh'd no more.</L>
<L>Then left her hastily with cold Respect,</L>
<L>LOTHARIO like, at leisure to reflect.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="26" REF="34"/>
<L>THIS was NARCISSA'S Aera of Distress,</L>
<L>Her little Comfort grew each Moment less;</L>
<L>Tortur'd with Love and disappointed Hope,</L>
<L>She gave the Fury of her Madness Scope;</L>
<L>Wild as a Tempest of the North she rav'd,</L>
<L>And from avenging Heav'n Assistance crav'd.</L>
<L>While her Gallant divulg'd to babbling Fame,</L>
<L>The Secret of <HI>his</HI> Villainy,—<HI>her</HI> Shame.</L>
<L>His dauntless Infamy Remorse defies,</L>
<L>And the black Tale on blacker Scandal flies;</L>
<L>In one short Day through Thousands swiftly goes,</L>
<L>A standing Jest for Prudes, Coquets and Beaus;</L>
<L>Hastes to the Knowledge of the Grub-street Throng,</L>
<L>And strait becomes the Subject of a Song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS the bewitching, but uncautious Maid,</L>
<L>By Fortune and by Fallacy betray'd;</L>
<L>Rent with the Rage of agonizing Thought,</L>
<L>When past the Nine Days' Wonder of her Fault;</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="35"/>
Was metamorphos'd, as by magic Spell,</L>
<L>And to the Shade of dark Oblivion fell▪</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>APPROACHING Penury again assail'd,</L>
<L>Which with lost Fame o'er Penitence prevail'd;</L>
<L>Another Lover she at length obtain'd,</L>
<L>And he too shortly all his Wishes gain'd;</L>
<L>Then soon revolted from her fading Charms,</L>
<L>And left for others, her incircling Arms:</L>
<L>A Third, a Fourth succeeded, and were blest,</L>
<L>But each one prov'd inconstant as the rest.</L>
<L>Thus half a Bedlamite through Shame she ran,</L>
<L>The justly irritated Foe of Man;</L>
<L>To Vice a Captive, and afraid to think,</L>
<L>Took the sad Refuge of oblivious Drink:</L>
<L>In Bacchanalian Chains her Reason bound,</L>
<L>Thus seal'd her Ruin, thus Destruction crown'd;</L>
<L>For soon her blooming Beauty felt Decay,</L>
<L>And with her Charms Subsistence drop'd away;</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="36"/>
Yet to the last her Follies she pursu'd,</L>
<L>Till dreaded Poverty at length ensu'd;</L>
<L>Till she was plac'd by Fate's relentless Power,</L>

<L>Though she too lost her patrimonial Right,</L>
<L>Discretion guarded her 'gainst Fortune's Spite;</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="38"/>
For by the Help of Industry she gain'd,</L>
<L>A Mansion where Contentment ever reign'd;</L>
<L>Where Neatness shone, beyond a splendid Glare,</L>

<L>From Street to Street incessantly she went,</L>
<L>Yet a long Week in fruitless Searches spent;</L>

Struck with the Sight, immoveable she stood,</L>

<L>Look up, she cried, "I come to give Relief,</L>
