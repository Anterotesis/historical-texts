<P>KING ARTHUR: OR, THE BRITISH WORTHY. A MASQUE.</P>
<P>By Mr. DRYDEN.</P>

<P>The MUSIC by PURCELL and Dr. ARNE.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>DRYDEN and PURCEL have made the following Performance hitherto regarded as one the best calculated to shew the Effects of Poetry, Action, and Music. It is now sub∣mitted to the Public, with every Attention the Managers could give it.—The success of this, as well as of all other Theatrical Exhibitions, will wholly depend upon the present Taste; but it is hoped, and believed, that the Names of Two of our greatest Geniuses in Poetry and Music, if they have Justice done them upon the Stage, bid fair for public Approbation.—There are some slight Alterations made, for the greater Convenience of Representation; and some few Songs added, where it was thought such Additions would be of Service to the whole.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<L>In ten set battles have we driven back</L>
<L>These heathen Saxons, and regain'd our earth.</L>
<L>As earth recovers from an ebbing tide</L>
<L>Her half-drown'd face, and lifts it o'er the waves,</L>
<L>From Severn's bank, e'en to this barren down</L>
<L>Our foremost men have press'd their fainty rear,</L>

<P>But why this day more lucky than the rest?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<L>Because this day</L>
<L>Is sacred to the patron of our isle;</L>
<L>A Christian, and a soldier's annual feast.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, now I understand you. This is St. George of Cappadocia's day. Well, it may be so, but faith I was ignorant; we soldiers seldom exa∣mine the Rubrick; and now and then a saint may happen to slip by us: but if he be a gentleman saint, he will forgive us.</P>

<P>Ne'er but once; and that was to my cost too; I follow'd him too close, and, to say the truth,

somewhat uncivilly, upon a rout: but he turned upon me, as quick and as round as a chaf'd boar; and gave me two licks a-cross the face, to put me in mind of my christianity.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know him well; he's free and open-hearted.</L>

<P>Yes, he's a valiant dog; pox on him.</P>

<P>I cannot blame him for courting the heiress of Cornwall: all heiresses are beautiful: and as blind as she is, he would have had no blind bargain of her.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Arth.</SPEAKER>
<L>Mistake me not, I count not war a wrong:</L>
<L>War is the trade of kings that fight for empire:</L>
<L>And better be a lion than a sheep.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osw.</SPEAKER>
<L>In what then have I wrong'd ye?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arth.</SPEAKER>
<L>In my love.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osw.</SPEAKER>
<L>Even love's an empire too: the noble soul,</L>
<L>Like kings, is covetous of single sway.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arth.</SPEAKER>
<L>I blame ye not for loving Emmeline:</L>
<L>But since the soul is free, and love is choice,</L>
<L>You should have made a conquest of her mind,</L>
<L>And not have forc'd her person by a rape.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osw.</SPEAKER>
<L>Whether by force, or stratagem, we gain,</L>
<L>Still gaining is our end, in war or love.</L>
<L>Her mind's the jewel in her body lock'd;</L>
<L>If I would gain the gem, and want the key,</L>
<L>It follows I must seize the cabinet:</L>
<L>But to secure your fear, her honour is untouch'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arth.</SPEAKER>
<L>Was honour ever safe in brutal hands?</L>
<L>So safe are lambs within the lion's paw;</L>
<L>Ungripp'd and play'd with till fierce hunger calls,</L>
<L>Then nature shews itself; the close-hid nails</L>
<L>Are stretch'd, and open, to the panting prey.</L>
<L>But if, indeed, you are so cold a lover—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osw.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not cold, but honourable.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arth.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then restore her:</L>
<L>That done, I shall believe you honourable.</L>

<L>That castle, were it wall'd with adamant,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osw.</SPEAKER>
<L>And ere to-morrow I may be a god,</L>
<L>If Emmeline be kind: but kind or cruel,</L>
<L>I tell thee, Arthur, but to see this day,</L>
<L>That heavenly face, tho' not to have her mine,</L>
<L>I would give up a hundred years of life,</L>
<L>And bid Fate cut to-morrow.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>Arth.</SPEAKER>
<L>It soon will come, and thou repent too late,</L>
<L>Which to prevent, I'll bribe thee to be honest.</L>
<L>Thy noble head, accustom'd to a crown,</L>
<L>Shall wear it still, nor shall thy hand forget</L>
<L>The scepter's use: from Medway's pleasing stream,</L>
<L>To Severn's roar, be thine;</L>
<L>In short, restore my love, and share my kingdom.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osw.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not tho' you spread my sway from Thames to Tiber:</L>
<L>Such gifts might bribe a king, but not a lover.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arth.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then pr'ythee give me back my kingly word</L>
<L>Pass'd for thy safe return; and let this hour,</L>
<L>In single combat, hand in hand, decide</L>
<L>The fate of empire and of Emmeline.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osw.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not that I fear do I decline this combat,</L>

Thou load of life: if thou wert made for souls,</L>

<L>Hold, poor deluded mortal, hold thy hand;</L>

<L>Th' infernal paint shall vanish from her face,</L>

<L>Horror seizes me,</L>

<L>Haste to thy work; a noble stroke or two</L>

<L>Arthur is marching onward to the fort.</L>
<L>I have but one recourse, and that's to Oswald;</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="47"/>
But will he fight for me, whom I have injur'd?</L>
<L>No, not for me, but for himself he must;</L>
<L>I'll urge him with the last necessity:</L>

<L>They shift their places oft, and skulk from war,</L>

<L>Then, where you see 'em clust'ring most, in motion,</L>

<L>If Arthur dares ascribe it to the first,</L>
<L>And singled from a croud, will tempt a conquest,</L>
<L>This Oswald offers; let our troops retire,</L>

<L>You need not;</L>

<STAGE>Arthur and Oswald fight. Oswald retreats. Enter Osmond from among the trees, and with his wand strikes Arthur's sword out of his hand, and exit. Oswald pursues Arthur. Merlin enters, and gives Arthur his sword, and exit. They close, and Arthur in the fall disarms Oswald.</STAGE>
