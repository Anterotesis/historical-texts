<HEAD>A LETTER TO <HI>R—B—</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was not many Days ago that I wrote you a Letter upon the Sub∣ject of your Comedy now upon the point of being acted at <HI>Drury-lane</HI> The∣atre. As I had Reasons for not dis∣closing
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
myself, I did not subscribe my Name to it; my Counsel of course was despised. However, I am not one of those anonymous Letter-Writers, who are to be discouraged by one Rebuff; for as my Motive, contrary to the Usage of my Fraternity, was a good one, and had your Benefit in view, I shall for your sake persist in it, and address you now in a more earnest and more public manner, than in my last.</P>
<P>Your Piece was last Winter put into my Hands by a Friend, without any Account whence he came by it. I read it through more than once, and it was upon my own Knowledge of it that I gave you my Advice not to produce it at our Summer Theatre; at the same
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
time wishing you to reserve it till the Winter, when it might be secure of a better Representation. This I said, not in the least doubting but that the Ma∣nager of either Theatre would accept it gladly and without Hesitation. Since then to my inconceivable Surprize I have been informed that it was offered and re∣fused at both Theatres. This accounts for the manner in which I got a sight of it; for it is plain, while it ought to have been in the Hands of its respectable Judges Mr. * * * and Mr. * * * it mi∣grated into those of other People, who have no manner of Connection with them.</P>
<P>I confess to you, Sir, I was never more surprized in my Life than when I heard
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
this Account. My Surprize however car∣ried an Exception to it in the Person of Mr. * * *; for I might have considered that as he has long been in possession of the first Name for those agile Perform∣ances in which our mute Harlequin ex∣cells, it was not at all likely he should countenance any Invasion upon his Me∣rit. The dangerous Tendency of this Innovation might justly alarm him, lest all that illustrious Collection of Birds and Beasts, Witches and Wire-Dancers, of which he enjoys the inestimable Posses∣sion, might be rendered useless and con∣temptible; and in the end the Perform∣ances of the Head (contrary to all Cus∣tom and Usage) be made of more Digni∣ty than the Operations of the Heels. This Inversion of things I might have
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
thought that experienced Practitioner could never approve of; and indeed how you or your Friends could think of tendering a Piece to him of such a Nature I can't well conceive.</P>
<P>But that any one who professes him∣self a man of Taste, a Lover of the Belles Lettres, a sovereign Critic in Dra∣matic Performances, and one who is himself a Dabbler in the Business, should so far forget himself, as to reject a Work of so much Wit and Ingenuity, so much Novelty, and such inimitable Raillery, staggered me beyond measure, and I was led almost to think I had mistaken its Merit, and formed too favorable an Opinion of it. While I was thus wa∣vering, and almost upon the Point of
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
receding from my Opinion; I received such a Confirmation of my Judgment, by the Reception it had met with from some of the most celebrated Wits of the Age, as put an End to my Doubts at once, and left me at a loss what Mo∣tive to ascribe its Rejection to. That it should spring from Want of Taste and Discernment I was loth to believe; that Jealousy or Want of Candor was the Cause, I was still inclined to think; es∣pecially when I recollected what half∣formed mishapen Productions, that Gen∣tleman had of late too frequently gave Birth to, with a Compliance, which although it carried the Appearance of Good Nature with it, certainly did no Credit to his Judgment. This Easiness of Temper to Authors of less Merit, led
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
me to believe that there could be no Ob∣stacle to your Success; and though I knew him absolute in his Decisions, I flattered myself he would be just. The Event convinced me of my Mistake, and the Conclusions I draw from it are such, as I never admit without Regret.</P>
<P>The Persons, Sir, whom you have had the good Fortune to please, are such, I understand, whose Names do honour not only to every one under their Protection, but to the Country to which they belong—nay, (if I am not mis-informed) I may add a Name to the List, a truly Royal one, whose Approbation I dare believe you esteem above any earthly Favour or Enjoyment whatsoever; this Approba∣tion I am told was accompanied with a
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Liberality peculiar to himself, which though it could scarce enhance your Happiness, I make no doubt increased his own. Thus distinguished by the Applause as well as Bounty of your So∣vereign, it would be ridiculous to suppose you any longer regret the Rejection you met with in your Application to the Theatre. If you received any thing like Mortification on that Occasion, it is now reflected back upon him who occasioned it, and who had not Taste to discern that Merit, which your Sovereign was pleased to reward. The happy Aera is now commenced, which if any one alive has cause to regret, it can be he only whose Decrees are no longer absolute, and whose Decisions are now made liable to be reversed; his Monopoly is destroy∣ed:
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Men of Wit and Genius have now a new Channel open to their Productions, and he who was before the supreme Censor of their Works, will now be re∣duced to his proper Profession, and be∣come the subservient Instrument in the Representation of them.</P>
<P>The Complaint that there are no Co∣medies wrote in this Age, does not in my Opinion reflect upon our Writers, but is the Consequence of our Manners. There are no longer any glaring Characters amongst us; modern Refinements have polished away all those humourous Pe∣culiarities which supplied Topics of Ri∣dicule to the Pens of <HI>Shakespear, John∣son</HI> and <HI>Fletcher;</HI> even <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Beau no longer exists. Our Cotemporaries think
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
they have conjured up a fresh Spirit of Humour in the Passion of Jealousy; it may be so; but it is no Mark of the Times; no body is jealous now-a-days; Thanks to the Wives of this Age, they prevent all that painful and excruciating Uncertainty which a more guarded Be∣haviour might occasion. The Comic Writer is now left without Materials: even the Court, his never-failing Re∣source for Invective, is now so formed, as to afford no Employment for his Pen, unless he steps out of his Office, and commences Panegyrist. In this Dearth of Characters I think great Praise is due to you, Sir, who have attempted to in∣troduce amongst us these whimsical Re∣cruits, and to transplant the Wit of <HI>Italy</HI> into your native Climate. I will not
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
venture to say your Attempt will succeed, and for these Reasons, First, because Im∣provement is as hard to introduce in this Country, as Prejudice is found difficult to remove. Secondly, our English Har∣lequin being in general as great a Fa∣vourite with the Mob, as our English Punchinello is, I conclude that every Man who can jump through a Hoop him∣self, or who delights to see another do it, will set his Face against your Inter∣loper. Thirdly, there being no Feats of Agility in your Piece, by which your Performers are put in manifest Danger of their Lives, I cannot see how it is possible the Galleries can set it out. Fourthly, and lastly; from its being ad∣mired by all People who have Taste, and the Opposition it has received from
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
those who have none, I conclude it will be damned by a very great Majority.</P>
<P>If in reply to these Suggestions of mine you remind me of the very powerful Pro∣tection under which you are sheltered, I must acquaint you that for that very Rea∣son every free-born Englishman who loves to disappoint and insult his Betters, will be your declared Enemy and Opposer. If you object to this, that your End is answered, that happy in the Approbation you have already obtained, you are above the Censure of the Vulgar and indifferent to their Praise, I think you judge right; and am,</P>
