<L>BRight God of day, whose genial power</L>
<L>Revives the buried seed;</L>
<L>That spreads with foliage every bower,</L>
<L>With verdure every mead;</L>
<L>Bid all thy vernal breezes fly,</L>

<L>Give the soft season to our drooping plains,</L>

<L>Give but thy vital beams to play,</L>
<L>These ice-wrought scenes will melt away;</L>
<L>And, mix'd in sprightly dance, the blooming Hours</L>
<L>Will wake the drowsy Spring, the Spring awake the flowers.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let Health, gay daughter of the skies,</L>
<L>On Zephyr's wings descend,</L>
<L>And scatter pleasures, as she flies,</L>
<L>Where Surry's downs extend:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>There Herring wooes her friendly power;</L>
<L>There may she all her roses shower;</L>
<L>To heal that shepherd all her balms employ,</L>

<L>STern Winter hence with all his train removes,</L>
<L>And cheerful skies, and limpid streams are seen;</L>
<L>Thick-sprouting foliage decorates the groves;</L>
<L>Reviving herbage robes the fields in green.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet lovelier scenes shall crown th' advancing year,</L>
<L>When blooming Spring's full bounty is display'd;</L>
<L>The smile of beauty every vale shall wear;</L>
<L>The voice of song enliven every shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O fancy, paint not coming days too fair!</L>
<L>Oft, for the prospects sprightly May should yield,</L>
<L>Rain-pouring clouds have darken'd all the air,</L>
<L>Or snows untimely whiten'd o'er the field:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But should kind Spring her wonted bounty shower,</L>
<L>The smile of beauty, and the voice of song;</L>
<L>If gloomy thought the human mind o'erpower,</L>
<L>Even vernal hours glide unenjoy'd along.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<L>I shun the scenes where maddening passion raves,</L>
<L>Where pride and folly high dominion hold,</L>
<L>And unrelenting avarice drives her slaves</L>
<L>O'er prostrate virtue in pursuit of gold:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The grassy lane, the wood-surrounded field,</L>
<L>The rude stone fence with fragrant wall-flowers gay,</L>
<L>The clay-built cot, to me more pleasure yield</L>
<L>Than all the pomp imperial domes display:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet even here, amid these secret shades,</L>
<L>These simple scenes of unreprov'd delight,</L>
<L>Affliction's iron hand my breast invades,</L>
<L>And death's dread dart is ever in my sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While genial suns to genial showers succeed;</L>
<L>(The air all mildness, and the earth all bloom;)</L>
<L>While herds and flocks range sportive o'er the mead,</L>
<L>Crop the sweet herb, and snuff the rich perfume;</L>
</LG>

<L>O why alone to hapless man denied</L>
<L>To taste the bliss inferior beings boast?</L>
<L>O why this fate that fear and pain divide</L>
<L>His few short hours on earth's delightful coast?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah cease—no more of Providence complain!</L>
<L>'Tis sense of guilt that wakes the mind to woe,</L>
<L>Gives force to fear, adds energy to pain,</L>
<L>And palls each joy by heaven indulg'd below:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<L>Why else the smiling infant-train so blest,</L>
<L>Ere dear-bought knowlege ends the peace within,</L>

<L>To them their joys sincere the seasons yield,</L>
<L>And all their days, and all their prospects please;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such joys were mine when from the peopled streets,</L>
<L>Where on Thamesis' banks I liv'd immur'd,</L>
<L>The new-blown fields that breath'd a thousand sweets,</L>
<L>To Surry's wood-crown'd hills my steps allur'd:</L>

<LG>
<L>O happy hours, beyond recovery fled!</L>
<L>What share I now that can your loss repay,</L>
<L>While o'er my mind these glooms of thought are spread,</L>
<L>And veil the light of life's meridian ray?</L>

<L>Where fear and pain and death shall be no more?</L>

<L>And raise their views to happier seats above,</L>
<L>Where fear and pain and death shall be no more:</L>
</LG>

<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<L>These grateful share the gift of nature's hand;</L>
<L>And in the varied scenes that round them shine,</L>
<L>(The fair, the rich, the awful, and the grand)</L>
<L>Admire th' amazing workmanship divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blows not a floweret in th' enamell'd vale,</L>
<L>Shines not a pebble where the rivulet strays,</L>
<L>Sports not an insect on the spicy gale,</L>
<L>But claims their wonder, and excites their praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For them even vernal nature looks more gay,</L>
<L>For them more lively hues the fields adorn;</L>
<L>To them more fair the fairest smile of day,</L>
<L>To them more sweet the sweetest breath of morn.</L>

<LG>
<L>WHen approach'd by the fair dewy fingers of spring,</L>
<L>Swelling buds open first, and look gay;</L>
<L>When the birds on the boughs by their mates sit and sing,</L>
<L>And are danc'd by the breeze on each spray:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When gently descending, the rain in soft showers,</L>
<L>With its moisture refreshes the ground,</L>
<L>And the drops, as they hang on the plants and the flowers,</L>
<L>Like rich gems beam a lustre around:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the wood-pigeons sit on the branches and cooe,</L>
<L>And the cuckow proclaims with his voice,</L>
<L>That nature marks this for the season to wooe,</L>
<L>And for all that can love to rejoice:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In a cottage at night may I spend all my time,</L>
<L>In the fields and the meadows all day,</L>
<L>With a maiden whose charms are as yet in their prime,</L>
<L>Young as April, and blooming as May.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
<L>When the lark with shrill notes sings aloft in the morn,</L>
<L>May my fairest and I sweetly wake,</L>

<L>Then arise, and our cottage forsake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the sun shines so warm, that my charmer and I</L>
<L>May recline on the turf without fear,</L>
<L>Let us there all vain thoughts and ambition defy,</L>
<L>While we breathe the first sweets of the year.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be this spot on a hill, and a spring from its side</L>
<L>Bubble out, and transparently flow,</L>
<L>Creep gently along in meanders, and glide</L>
<L>Thro' the vale strow'd with daisies below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While the bee flies from blossom to blossom and sips,</L>
<L>And the violets their sweetness impart,</L>
<L>Let me hang on her neck, and so taste from her lips</L>
<L>The rich cordial that thrills to the heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While the dove sits lamenting the loss of its mate,</L>
<L>Which the fowler has caught in his snares,</L>
<L>May we think ourselves blest, that it is not our fate,</L>
<L>To endure such an absence as theirs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>May I listen to all her soft, tender, sweet notes</L>
<L>When she sings, and no sounds interfere,</L>
<L>But the warbling of birds, which in stretching their throats</L>
<L>Are at strife to be louder than her.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
<L>When the daises, and cowslips, and primroses blow,</L>
<L>And checquer the meads, and the lawns,</L>
<L>May we see bounding there the swift light-footed doe,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the lapwings just fledg'd o'er the turf take their run,</L>
<L>And the firstlings are all at their play,</L>
<L>And the harmless young lambs skip about in the sun,</L>
<L>Let us then be as frolic as they.</L>
</LG>

<L>When I talk of my love, should I chance to espy,</L>
<L>That she seems to mistrust what I say,</L>
<L>By a tear that is ready to fall from her eye,</L>

<L>And let no single beauty escape,</L>
<L>But see none to create so much love, and surprize,</L>
<L>As her eyes, and her face, and her shape.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus each day let us pass, till the buds turn to leaves,</L>
<L>And the meadows around us are mown,</L>
<L>When the lass on the sweet-smelling haycock receives,</L>
<L>What she afterwards blushes to own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When evenings grow cool, and the flowers hang their heads</L>
<L>With the dew, then no longer we'll roam,</L>
<L>With my arm round her waist, in a path thro' the meads</L>
<L>Let us hasten to find our way home.</L>

<L>When the birds are at roost, with their heads in their wings,</L>
<L>Each one by the side of its mate;</L>
<L>When a mist that arises a drowziness brings</L>
<L>Upon all but the owl and the bat:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When soft rest is requir'd, and the stars lend their light,</L>
<L>And all nature lies quiet and still;</L>
<L>When no sound breaks the sacred repose of the night,</L>
<L>But, at distance, the clack of a mill.</L>
</LG>

<L>With peace for our pillow, and free from all noise,</L>
<L>So that voices in whispers are known,</L>
<L>Let us give and receive all the nameless soft joys,</L>

<L>' When now with rest amidst her labours crown'd,</L>
<L>' She watchful, patient, eyes the circle round,</L>
<L>' I learn, when toil has well deserv'd success,</L>
<L>' Hope's placid, calm, expectance to possess,</L>
<L>' With care to watch, with patience still to wait</L>
<L>' The golden moment, tho' delay'd by fate.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Impatient Cloe thus again replied,</L>
<L>" How soon is error thro' each veil descried!</L>
<L>" Still boasting reason's power, how weak are we!</L>
<L>" How blind, alas! to all we would not see!</L>
<L>" Else how could Philo, in a spider's cause,</L>
<L>" Talk thus of mercy with deserv'd applause?</L>
<L>" Or call aught virtuous industry and skill,</L>
<L>" Exerted only to surprize and kill?</L>
<L>" The blameless infect, whom no murder feeds,</L>
<L>" For her, the victim of her cunning, bleeds;</L>
<L>" Cunning! which when to wisdom we compare,</L>
<L>" Is but to her, to men what monkeys are."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>' Hold! Philo cries, and know, the same decree</L>
<L>' Gave her the fly, which gives the lamb to thee;</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="40"/>' Or why those wings adapted to the snare,</L>
<L>' Why interceptive hangs the net in air?</L>
<L>' As plain in these the precept, "kill and eat,"</L>
<L>' As in thy skill to carve the living treat.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To this, she cries, "Persuade me, if you can—</L>
<L>" Man's lord of all, and all was made for man."</L>
<L>' Vain thought! the child of ignorance and pride!'</L>
<L>Disdainful smiling, quickly he replied,</L>
<L>' To man, vain reptile! tell me of what use</L>
<L>' Are all that Afric's peopled wastes produce?</L>
<L>' The nameless monsters of the swarming seas,</L>
<L>' The pigmy nations wafted on the breeze?</L>
<L>' The happy myriads, by his eyes unseen,</L>
<L>' That bask in flowers, and quicken all the green?</L>
<L>' Why live these numbers blest in nature's state?</L>
<L>' Why lives this spider object of thy hate?</L>
<L>' Why man? but life in common to possess,</L>
<L>' Wide to diffuse the stream of happiness;</L>
<L>' Blest stream! th' o'erflowing of the parent mind,</L>
<L>' Great without pride, and without weakness kind.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With downcast eyes, and sighs, and modest air,</L>
<L>Thus in soft sounds replied the wily fair:</L>
<L>" This fatal subtilty thy books impart</L>
<L>" To baffle truth, when unsustain'd by art;</L>
<L>" For this, when Cloe goes at twelve to bed,</L>
<L>" Till three you sit, in converse with the dead;</L>
<L>" No wonder then, in vain my skill's employ'd</L>
<L>" To prove it best that vermin be destroy'd—</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="41"/>" But tho' you proudly triumph o'er my sex,</L>
<L>" Joy to confute, and reason but to vex,</L>
<L>" Yet, if you lov'd me, to oblige your wife,</L>
<L>" What could you less! you'd take a spider's life.</L>
<L>" Once to prevent my wishes Philo flew,</L>
<L>" But time, that alters all, has alter'd you.</L>
<L>" Yet still, unchang'd, poor Cloe's love remains;</L>
<L>" These tears my witness, which your pride disdains;</L>
<L>" These tears, at once my witness, and relief."</L>
<L>Here paus'd the fair, all eloquent in grief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He, who had often, and alone, o'erturn'd</L>
<L>Witlings, and sophists, when his fury burn'd,</L>
<L>Now yields to love the fortress of his soul;</L>
<L>His eyes with vengeance on Arachne roll,</L>
<L>' Curs'd wretch, thou poisonous quintessence of ill,</L>
<L>' Those precious drops, unpunish'd, shalt thou spill?'</L>
<L>He said, and, stooping, from his foot he drew,</L>
<L>Black as his purpose, what was once a shoe;</L>
<L>Now, high in air the fatal heel ascends,</L>
<L>Reason's last effort now the stroke suspends;</L>
<L>In doubt he stood—when, breath'd from Cloe's breast,</L>
<L>A struggling sigh her inward grief exprest.</L>
<L>Fir'd by the sound, 'Die, sorceress, die,' he cried,</L>
<L>And to his arm his utmost strength applied:</L>
<L>Crush'd falls the foe, one complicated wound,</L>
<L>And the smote shelf returns a jarring sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On Ida's top thus Venus erst prevail'd,</L>
<L>When all the sapience of Minerva fail'd:</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="42"/>Thus to like arts a prey, as poets tell,</L>
<L>By Juno lov'd in vain, great Dido fell.</L>
<L>And thus for ever Beauty shall controul</L>
<L>The saint's, the sage's, and the hero's soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Jove with hate beheld th' atrocious deed,</L>
<L>And Vengeance follows with tremendous speed;</L>
<L>In Philo's mind she quench'd the ray that fir'd</L>
<L>With love of science, and with verse inspir'd,</L>
<L>Expung'd at once the philosophic theme,</L>
<L>All sages think, and all that poets dream;</L>
<L>Yields him thus chang'd a vassal to the fair,</L>
<L>And forth she leads him, with a victor's air:</L>
<L>Drest to her wish, he mixes with the gay,</L>
<L>As much a trifle, and as vain as they;</L>
<L>To fix their power, and rivet fast the chain,</L>
<L>They lead where Pleasure spreads her soft domain;</L>
<L>Where, drown'd in music Reason's hoarser call,</L>

<P>Cupid opens his design of making the Kite, and offers his arms to Dian. The Loves descend. The plan for the Kite is laid out by a mechanical Love, who begs Cupid's bow of Dian. They all assist in the work, till the leaves of the copy-book are used. Here Mercury seasonably fur∣nishes them with acts of parliament. The tail is finish'd, and the lanthorn added by Dian. Cupid receives it, and institutes the game of leaping over the candle. A short episode on this subject.</P>

<L>" But shall these hands no mark of favour boast,</L>
<L>" Robb'd of their arms—my bow, my quiver lost!</L>
<L>" Ah! let the skilful maid a frame prepare,</L>
<L>" These leaves (so heaven has doom'd) must rise in air:</L>
<L>" Then, born on Zephyrs, shall thy work be seen,</L>

<L>Thus urg'd the power of love—Agreed—she cried,</L>
<L>And reach'd the bow and quiver from his side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now to their posts a thousand Loves descend,</L>
<L>And round the fair with busy zeal attend;</L>
<L>Among them one, whom long experience blest</L>
<L>With a mechanic head above the rest.</L>
<L>He form'd the ruff in good Eliza's days,</L>
<L>And first confin'd the slender waist in stays:</L>
<L>He first with beauty-spots adorn'd the maid,</L>
<L>And bid her borrow lustre from their shade:</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="58"/>He knit the lovers-knot in times of old,</L>
<L>And form'd the circle of the bridal gold:</L>
<L>He on the ear first hung the sparkling rings;</L>
<L>His was the tucker; his the kissing-strings.</L>
<L>He first in canvas hoop enclos'd the maid;</L>
<L>Turn'd the round coif; and rais'd the stiffen'd head.</L>
<L>While other Loves the paste, or packthread brought,</L>
<L>Drew out the plan, and built the bird in thought;</L>
<L>He sought the wand, which first her grandsire bore,</L>
<L>Th' expressive ensign of the sheriff's power;</L>
<L>This next the infant Dian active strode,</L>
<L>And round the parlour fancied journeys rode:</L>
<L>(Its mane, like gold, in glittering tinsel spread,</L>
<L>And painted streamers nodded o'er its head)</L>
<L>But now miss Molly, with becoming speed,</L>
<L>Press'd with her wanton weight the nimble reed:</L>
<L>Artful he tempts the little fair to stay,</L>
<L>And steals the long-descended gift away.</L>
<L>His useful theft the winged band approve,</L>

<HEAD>CANTO III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>One of the Loves is sent to Aeolus, for a prosperous gale to fly the Kite. Aeolus's cell described. The Love returns with the gale to Dian. Cupid gives directions for the flight. Juno's envy, who sends Iris to cut the string. The Kite is turned into a star.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>BUT Cupid now, with anxious thoughts oppress'd,</L>
<L>Ceas'd from his sport, and thus the Loves address'd:</L>
<L>" Thus far have Jove and Fate propitious shone,</L>
<L>" Our bird is finish'd, and one labour done!</L>
<L>" Its safety is our next, our chiefest care,</L>
<L>" While high it soars thro' pathless fields of air.</L>
<L>" To guard it from the whirlwind's rapid power,</L>
<L>" Or careful shield it from the treacherous shower:</L>
<L>" Will Aeolus, implor'd, refuse his aid?</L>
<L>" Or Jove deny, when Love and Dian plead?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce had he ended, but a Love withdrew,</L>
<L>And on the wings of generous duty flew;</L>
<L>Nor tarried till he reach'd the distant cells,</L>
<L>Where the hoarse wind's imperious tyrant dwells.</L>
<L><PB N="62" REF="64"/>Here breath'd the South, that falls in genial showers,</L>
<L>And gentle Zephyrs, crown'd with vernal flowers;</L>
<L>There blew the East, that buttons breasts of beaux,</L>
<L>And over Cloe's neck the tippet throws;</L>
<L>Or with the North in dreadful union raves,</L>
<L>Whirls o'er the main, and rolls the madding waves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So (if great things may be compar'd with small,</L>
<L>And troubled oceans to a jug of ale)</L>
<L>When Tattle heats the drink that cheers her soul,</L>
<L>And to her tooth prepares the groaning bowl;</L>
<L>Her giddy hands the mingling fluids shake,</L>
<L>And the white bubbles o'er the the surface break.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unnumber'd virgins croud on every side,</L>
<L>To various punishments condemn'd for pride.</L>
<L>Belinda here her pins and powder tries,</L>
<L>And the dear glass with fruitless labour eyes:</L>
<L>Behind her chair the ruffling North attends,</L>
<L>And ever discomposes as she mends:</L>
<L>Raw vapours steam around the cruel fair,</L>
<L>And winds that whistle nothing but despair.</L>
<L>There Amoret cold piercing blasts pursue,</L>
<L>And stain her nose with everlasting blue!</L>
<L>Others, whose hoops unwary youths enflam'd,</L>
<L>Here run—O L—d! so rumpled and asham'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thro' these the Love (and not regardless) went,</L>
<L>As onward to the monarch's throne he bent.</L>
<L>The merchant here his ready aid implores,</L>
<L>And asks a brighter gale from India's shores:</L>
<L><PB N="63" REF="65"/>There luckless Hero for a calm intreats,</L>
<L>While her Leander tempts the fatal streights:</L>
<L>And black-eyed Susan with impatience burns,</L>
<L>To know how soon sweet William's ship returns:</L>
<L>Whilst Aeol 'midst his guards, in awful state,</L>
<L>Array'd in furr, like Russia's sovereign, sate;</L>
<L>His stretch'd-out arm dispensing prosperous gales,</L>
<L>To fame and conquest swells Britannia's sails.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now all was hush'd, and Love his silence broke,</L>
<L>And thus the wind-compelling king bespoke:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" If ever Dian's beauty reach'd thy cell,</L>
<L>" If e'er thine eye beheld the sportive belle,</L>
<L>" When the fair huntress, foremost of the train,</L>
<L>" Grew to her steed, and scower'd along the plain:</L>
<L>" If Aeol then in conscious rapture stray'd,</L>
<L>" And round her neck, in glad confusion, play'd;</L>
<L>" If then, with greedy joy, her lips he press'd,</L>
<L>" Rumpled her tucker, and unveil'd her breast;</L>
<L>" That hand, that did so oft thy bliss reprove,</L>
<L>" Gives to thy charge, this day, the bird of Love:</L>
<L>" Let Zephyrs then in active whispers breathe,</L>
<L>" But every other wind be still as death!</L>
<L>" This Fan be thine, and such in love its power,</L>
<L>" Not Jove, in all his shapes, e'er boasted more.</L>
<L>" When future passions shall thy breast invade,</L>
<L>" Be this the present to the favourite maid;</L>
<L>" Its sheet unfurl'd reveals a scene of gold,</L>
<L>" And Love in ambush lies in every fold;</L>
<L><PB N="64" REF="66"/>" Soon as her hand these painted altars raise,</L>
<L>" The nymph, not vainly, with my arrows plays;</L>
<L>" This ever shall new thoughts of thee suggest,</L>
<L>" And bear thee to her lips, and waft thee to her breast."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus he—and the grim monarch of the wind,</L>
<L>In swelling bags a happy gale confin'd:</L>
<L>With these well fraught, the Love returns to day,</L>
<L>And back to Dian wings his liquid way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now with the bird she seeks the flowery meads,</L>
<L>(Pancies and dazies spring where-e'er she treads;)</L>
<L>The little Loves around, with decent pride,</L>
<L>Hang on her hoop, and triumph by her side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lo! mid the ranks, superior, Cupid moves,</L>
<L>And issues out his orders to the Loves;</L>
<L>To these he gave the lanthorn, and the tail,</L>
<L>But trebly charg'd 'em to supply the gale.</L>
<L>A chosen cohort from the rest he drew,</L>
<L>And to their care assign'd th' important clue.</L>
<L>" Soon as the maid in equal poise sustains,</L>
<L>" And on her arm my bird obliquely leans,</L>
<L>" You forward haste—(this glove shall be the sign)</L>
<L>" With judgment to contract, or give it line;</L>
<L>" Do you with caution from the tail repair,</L>
<L>" But yield the lanthorn with distinguish'd care!</L>
<L>" Who diligent this day attends my bird,</L>
<L>" His hand shall, next to Cupid's, hold the cord."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
<L>The glove was wav'd—the steady engine flew,</L>
<L>Sprung into air, and lessen'd to the view;</L>
<L>Proudly it sail'd, on crouding Zephyrs born,</L>
<L>And every Love was pilot in his turn:</L>
<L>Dian transported too beheld it fly,</L>
<L>And to the taper grew her aking eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Cupid timorous saw its height in air,</L>
<L>And thought his bird too distant from his care.</L>
<L>'Twas he the messenger decreed to send,</L>
<L>And would, by proxy, on his bird attend:</L>
<L>What better than a billet-doux may prove</L>
<L>The tender representative of Love?</L>
<L>For, lo! the maid a gilded sheet imparts,</L>
<L>That breath'd unfeigned flames, and real darts.</L>
<L>Led by the clue, its rapid flight it steers,</L>
<L>And to the bird his airy summons bears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! what avail its easy-waving wings?</L>
<L>And length of tail, that boasts successive acts of kings!</L>
<L>How frail our span of time! how fix'd its date!</L>
<L>How soon the noblest labours yield to fate!</L>
<L>Sleep-breaking care, gay pleasure, and pale woe,</L>
<L>Meet in one stream! and in one channel flow!</L>
<L>Virtue but like a shining vapour flies!</L>
<L>And when it brightest blazes soonest dies!</L>
<L>For Juno now, (with memorable spight!)</L>
<L>Saw Cupid's bird, and sicken'd at the sight!</L>
<L>Her past dishonour all her breast alarms;</L>
<L>Venus preferr'd, and her own slighted charms!</L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="68"/>Now from her eye a gleam of envy breaks,</L>
<L>And all the goddess to revenge awakes:</L>
<L>" Shall Juno then, inglorious, quit the field?</L>
<L>" And, unreveng'd, the palm of beauty yield?</L>
<L>" If Ida's goddess boasts superior charms,</L>
<L>" Why did my Jove prefer me to his arms?</L>
<L>" But still her impious hands detain the prize;</L>
<L>" Her power encreases! and her altars rise!</L>
<L>" While I to partial fate unheard complain,</L>

<L>" But swift thro' ether let my Iris glide,</L>

<L>" Her urchin's bird its airy journey steers!</L>
<L>" There all his joy on one small thread depends,</L>
<L>" That cut—at once his hope and empire ends!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She said: and Iris to her charge repairs,</L>
<L>And reach'd the string—and clos'd the fatal sheers!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thrice was the baleful raven heard to croak,</L>

<L>Say, Muse, for well thou know'st, what planet first</L>

<L>Whether thou'rt Hesperus, or Phosphor call'd,</L>

<L>Nor does the moon alone her figure change,</L>

<L>Bright as thou art, and cloath'd in lucent beams,</L>

<L>Day answering night in length, and night the day.</L>

<L>Whence Caesar kens the votive world below,</L>

<L>How grateful will appear her dawning rays,</L>
<L>As favours unexpected doubly please!</L>
<L>Who thus can think, and who such thoughts pursues,</L>
<L>Content may keep his life, or calmly lose.</L>
<L>Of this a proof thou mayst thyself receive;</L>
<L>When leisure from affairs will give thee leave.</L>
<L>Come see thy friend, retir'd without regret,</L>
<L>Forgetting cares, or trying to forget;</L>
<L>In easy contemplation soothing time</L>
<L>With morals much, and now and then with rhime;</L>
<L>Not so robust in body as in mind,</L>
<L>And always undejected, tho' declin'd;</L>
<L>Not wondering at the world's new wicked ways,</L>
<L>Compar'd with those of our forefather's days:</L>
<L>For virtue now is neither more nor less,</L>
<L>And vice is only varied in the dress.</L>
<L>Believe it, men have ever been the same,</L>
<L>And all the golden age is but a dream.</L>

<L>WHat do scholars, and bards, and astronomers wife,</L>
<L>Mean by stuffing our heads with nonsense and lies;</L>
<L>By telling us Venus must always appear</L>
<L>In a car, or a shell, or a twinkling star;</L>
<L>Drawn by sparrows, or swans, or dolphins, or doves,</L>
<L>Attended in form by the graces and loves:</L>
<L>That ambrosia and nectar is all she will taste,</L>

<L>Without all this bustle I saw the bright dame,</L>

<L>No nectar she drank, no ambrosia she eat;</L>
<L>Her cup was plain claret, a chicken her meat:</L>
<L>Nor wanted a cestus her bosom to grace,</L>
<L>For R—d, that night, had lent her her face.</L>

<L>Alas! what a folly, that wealth and domain</L>

<L>Immense is the toil, yet the labour how vain!</L>
<L>Is not life to be over to-morrow?</L>

<L>WHen Venus saw Adonis dead,</L>
<L>And from his cheeks the roses fled,</L>
<L>His lovely locks distain'd with gore;</L>
<L>She bade her Cupids bring the boar;</L>
<L>The boar that had her lover slain,</L>
<L>The cause of all her grief and pain.</L>
<L>Swift as the pinion'd birds they rove</L>
<L>Thro' every wood, thro' every grove;</L>
<L>And when the guilty boar they found,</L>
<L>With cords they bound him, doubly bound;</L>
<L>One with a chain, secure and strong,</L>
<L>Haul'd him unwillingly along;</L>
<L>One pinch'd his tail to make him go,</L>
<L>Another beat him with his bow:</L>
<L>The more they urg'd, the more they dragg'd,</L>
<L>The more reluctantly he lagg'd.</L>
<L>Guilt in his conscious looks appear'd;</L>
<L>He much the angry goddess fear'd.</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="116"/>To Venus soon the boar they led—</L>
<L>" O cruel, cruel beast! she said,</L>
<L>" Durst thou that thigh with blood distain?</L>
<L>" Hast thou my dearest lover slain?"</L>
<L>Submissive he replies—I swear</L>
<L>By thee, fair queen—by all that's dear—</L>
<L>By thy fond lover—by this chain—</L>
<L>And by this numerous hunter-train;</L>
<L>I ne'er design'd, with impious tooth,</L>
<L>To wound so beautiful a youth:</L>
<L>No—but with love and frenzy warm,</L>
<L>(So far has beauty power to charm!)</L>
<L>I long'd, this crime I'll not deny,</L>
<L>To kiss that fair, that naked thigh.</L>
<L>These tusks then punish, if you please,</L>
<L>These are offenders, draw out these.</L>
<L>Of no more use they now can prove</L>
<L>To me, the votaries of love!</L>
<L>My guilty lips, if not content,</L>
<L>My lips shall share the punishment.</L>
<L>These words, so movingly exprest,</L>
<L>Infus'd soft pity in her breast;</L>
<L>The queen relented at his plea,</L>
<L>And bad her Cupids set him free:</L>
<L>But from that day he join'd her train,</L>
<L>Nor to the woods return'd again;</L>
<L>And all those teeth he burnt with fire,</L>
<L>Which glow'd before with keen desire.</L>

<L>Art after art still dawning to their view,</L>

<LG>
<L>ON the banks of that crystalline stream,</L>
<L>Where Thames oft his current delays!</L>
<L>And charms, more than poets can dream,</L>
<L>In his Richmond's bright villa surveys.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fair Lucy, of all the gay throng,</L>
<L>The fairest that Britain has seen!</L>
<L>Now drew every village along,</L>
<L>From the day she first danc'd on the green.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! boast not of beauty's fond power,</L>
<L>For short is the triumph, ye fair!</L>
<L>Not fleeter the bloom of each flower;</L>
<L>And hope is but gilded despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His desire each swain now behold,</L>
<L>By riches endeavours to prove!</L>
<L>But Lucy, still cries, what is gold,</L>
<L>Or wealth, when compar'd to his love?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
<L>No, Colin! together we'll wield</L>
<L>Our sickles in summer's bright day;</L>
<L>Together we'll leaze o'er the field;</L>
<L>And smile all our labours away!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In winter I'll winnow the wheat</L>
<L>As it falls, from your flail, on the ground:</L>
<L>That flail will be music, as sweet</L>
<L>When your voice in the labour is drown'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How oft would he speak of his bliss?</L>
<L>How oft would he call her his maid?</L>
<L>And Colin would seal, with a kiss,</L>
<L>Every promise and vow which he laid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But hark! o'er the grass-level land,</L>
<L>The village bells sound on the plain!</L>
<L>False Colin this morn gave his hand;</L>
<L>And Lucy's fond tears are in vain!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sad Lucy too soon heard the tale;</L>
<L>Too soon the sad cause she was told:</L>
<L>That his was a nymph of the vale,</L>
<L>That he broke his fond promise for gold!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As she walkt by the margin so green,</L>
<L>That adorns Thames' flowery side;</L>
<L>How oft was she languishing seen?</L>
<L>How oft would she gaze on the tide?</L>

<L>By the clear mirror then as she sate,</L>
<L>That reflected herself and the mead;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>There! there! is it Lucy I see?—</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>I come, dear companion in grief!</L>
<L>Gay scenes and fond pleasures adieu!</L>
<L>I come, and we'll gather relief;</L>
<L>From bosoms so chaste and so true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Like you! I have mourn'd the long night;</L>
<L>And wept out the day in despair!</L>

<L>And bosom'd a friend in my care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye meadows, so lovely, farewell!</L>

<L>Which tolls for his Lucy when dead!</L>

<L>Your wish will too sure be obey'd!</L>
<L>Nor Colin her loss shall bemoan:</L>
<L>Soon, soon shall poor Lucy be laid,</L>
<L>Where her heart shall be cold as your own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, clasp'd in the arms of that fair,</L>
<L>Whose wealth has been Lucy's sad fate!</L>
<L>As together you breathe the free air,</L>
<L>And a thousand dear pleasures relate:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If chance, o'er my turf as you tread,</L>
<L>You dare to affect a fond sigh!</L>
<L>The primrose will shrink its pale head;</L>
<L>And the violet languish and die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce echo had gather'd the sound,</L>
<L>But she plung'd from her grass-springing bed;</L>
<L>The liquid stream parts to the ground;</L>
<L>And the mirror clos'd over her head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The swains of the village at eve</L>
<L>Oft meet at the dark-spreading yew;</L>
<L>There, wonder how man could deceive</L>
<L>A bosom so chaste and so true!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With garlands of every flower,</L>

<L>And freshen with tears the fair ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nay! wish they had never been born,</L>
