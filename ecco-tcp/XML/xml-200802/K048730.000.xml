<HEAD>INTRODUCTION TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Author of this Poem had begun one, on the Subject, many Years ago: but, doubting whether in the Plan he was proceeding on he had enough express'd the Sense of one who had the Blessing to be born and educated in a Land of <HI>Liberty,</HI> he had Discretion to stop short: and has postpon'd its Publication, for above three Times the Space prescrib'd by <HI>Horace</HI> for impartial Re-examination of a Poet's first Conceptions.—He now finds, from the Result of this Deliberation, that, tho' his General Purpose then was right, as but preferring the <HI>Monarchic,</HI> to the <HI>Popular</HI> Forms of Government; yet, had he, at That Time, gone through his Work, He was in Danger to have <HI>err'd,</HI> in one particular Point, of most essential Consequence: restraining Monarchy to its <HI>too simple Species</HI>—where It verges to, and looks like, Tyranny.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4"/>Early Prejudices are imbib'd too deeply to be rooted out at once. Experience, and Reflection, have, since, taught him, to <HI>conjoin,</HI> Ideas, which, before, seem'd <HI>inconsistent:</HI> and to know and own, as he now does, that Monarchy is there most nobly constituted, where Crowns invest their Wearers with the most extensive Power to <HI>guard,</HI> the Public Liberty: without Inducement to expect Increase of Happiness, or Glory, from Attempts to <HI>violate</HI> it.</P>
<P>There is <HI>That</HI> Difference, and no other, between the first, and present, Purpose of the Poem.—The Fabric is the same, as formerly: but It has firmer Ground, for its Foundation. —The <HI>Hebrew System</HI> is, and must be, <HI>Monarchy:</HI> but It is <HI>such</HI> a Monarchy, as GOD may be suppos'd, without Affront to his best Attributes, to have establish'd at the Head of a <HI>Free</HI> People: whom he would not, by a Waste of <HI>useless</HI> Miracles, have brought up out of Slavery to an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Tyrant; to have left 'em <HI>Slaves again,</HI> in a worse Country, under Tyrants, of their own Fraternity.</P>
<P>The Plan, as it now stands, is strictly consonant to This Idea: And so little Difference could arise from the mistaken <HI>Species,</HI> where the <HI>Genus</HI> was <HI>monarchical,</HI> that almost every thing, in the <HI>Poetic</HI> View, retains its Place, as in its first Production: with Exception only to That nobler Taste of <HI>Freedom</HI>; which the Writer ow'd to a disinterested, silent, and sincere Attachment, never confess'd, till now, to the unconscious Object of it. Here, first, and much too late, his touch'd Heart call'd upon him to record the Obligation.</P>
<P>It has been thought advisable to publish only Three Books at a Time: and with the first the Notes belonging to it. Partly by way of Specimen: but chiefly because relative to the Design, and general Constitution, of the <HI>Epic Species.</HI> —The Notes to All the Books, will, last, be publish'd, by
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
Themselves: and may be bound distinct from the Poetic Part: or be annex'd to Each Book relatively; making, so, <HI>Two</HI> Volumes; at Election of the Reader: who may also, in this Method, chuse to take, or leave, the <HI>Notes,</HI> at his own Pleasure.—The Remaining Three Parts, of the Poem, will be publish'd in like manner as This First: and at the shortest Distances which can consist with Care, in the Revi∣sal and Correction of so large a Work, and where Variety of Subjects claim the closest Application, of a Writer, not in∣sensible with what a Reverence Men should appear before the Public Eye; who dare aspire to being held in View, be∣yond the Dimness of a present Prospect.</P>
<P>He presumes to call his present Prospect but a <HI>dim</HI> one, without Arrogance, or Satire: being equally remote from dreaming too <HI>sublimely,</HI> or too <HI>despicably,</HI> of the Age and Nation he was doom'd to take his Fate in.—He, but too well, knows 'em not the best dispos'd, in any Kind, for <HI>giving Fame to Epic Poetry:</HI> yet, must protest against so far misjudging his Cotemporaries as to suspect it possible, that many should not now be living, as completely qualify'd, as in whatever other Time, or Country, to know how far a Poet has deserv'd their Notice: and refuse it only, where It ought not to be granted.</P>
<P>For the Rest, he casts his Hopes upon <HI>Futurity:</HI> and, having but a short Reserve of personal Claim to <HI>Time,</HI> trans∣fers his Expectation of Survival, to this Child of Leisure, His <HI>Poetic Representative.</HI></P>
<P>He has nothing further, here, to add, concerning it, the <HI>Notes</HI> being very circumstantial, and explanatory: only, that the Work (which is of <HI>Epic,</HI> or <HI>Heroic,</HI> Species), had for Object, the chief Virtues of a People: <HI>Intrepidity,</HI> in foreign <HI>War</HI>—and Spirit of domestic <HI>Liberty.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="6"/>As for the <HI>Notes,</HI> they are not merely of <HI>poetical,</HI> or <HI>critical,</HI> Intention: but consist, occasionally, of enlarg'd Discourses upon different Subjects, drawn from old and modern <HI>History</HI>; to elucidate and give Examples, to, <HI>poli∣tical</HI> Deductions, which arise from <HI>Incidents,</HI> remark'd upon. They are, also, <HI>Military, Geographic,</HI> and <HI>Commercial:</HI> and include Variety of other Subjects: as the Reader will dis∣cover in their Progress.</P>
<P>Among these Reflections, it may possibly give Satisfaction to the Learn'd and Reverend Body of our <HI>Clergy,</HI> in par∣ticular, to see the following three Points touch'd, in the new Lights here given them.</P>
<P N="1">1st, That the fine <HI>Theocracy,</HI> of the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Institution, was destroy'd, in its Progression, but by natural Consequence of one political Defect (that has not been enough adverted to, by Writers on that Subject), <HI>the Military Care disjoin'd from the Imperial.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly, That the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Form of Government was never, as it has by Mr. <HI>Harrington</HI> (and almost generally) been sup∣pos'd, <HI>a Popular Republic:</HI> but a plain <HI>Hereditary Monar∣chy:</HI> the sovereign Power whereof was vested in the <HI>High-Priest</HI>'s Person.</P>
<P>And 3dly, That, with Exception only to this last <HI>peculiar</HI> Circumstance, there arise great Probabilities, toward finding in the first establish'd <HI>Hebrew Model,</HI> the Original of All the manly <HI>Celtic Forms:</HI> and, in particular, of That, which constitutes the <HI>present System in Great Britain</HI>;—not relax∣ing from its, known, sound Principles.</P>
<P>Thus much seem'd needful to premise. What rests, will follow, with the <HI>Notes,</HI> conjunctively: Those on the first Book being publish'd previously, because explanatory of the <HI>General</HI> Purpose.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES AND Miscellaneous REFLECTIONS ON The FIRST BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE the Reader enters on the Notes, in referential Order, He will probably forgive a short Remark or two upon the Nature of this Kind of Poem: The Age we live in, so profusely overflowing in the Practice without stopping to consider Judgment, that, to common Apprehensions, Poetry gives no Idea but of <HI>Words with musical Cadences:</HI> that is to say, plain Sense, in <HI>Rhyme,</HI> and <HI>Measure.</HI></P>
<P>It may seem surprising, that Pretenders to this Faculty (few of us having been thought guilty of too little Sensibility) should rest contented, under the Injustice of so mortifying a Contraction!—A Poet, when consider'd in this narrow Light, were so contemptible a Creature, that he must give Place to a good <HI>Piper:</HI> who unquestionably has Power of raising <HI>Sounds,</HI> much more melodious, than Adjusters of mere <HI>Words</HI> are capable of equalling.</P>
<P>The Truth is, Numbers, in their softest, and most pleasing Fluency, make up but one Part of the <HI>Means,</HI> mistaken for the <HI>End.</HI> They were design'd but as a Vehicle, that should insinuate the instructive <HI>Bitter,</HI> hid behind the Promise of <HI>Delight.</HI> The Music having gain'd the Ear, the Matter thence found Entrance to the Heart; and there prevail'd against Distempers, which, but for the fine Disguise it came conceal'd in, it had never reach'd with such Advantage; there being a Reluctance in our Nature apt to rise against a plain Reproof; as, in our Taste, against such Physic, as is offer'd us too coarsely.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="46"/>All, as far as this, was well. The worst was, that this Sweetness in the Art expos'd it, by Degrees, to Profanation by the Ignorant. Prompt Adventurers were so glad, to find the <HI>Pleasant</HI> the most <HI>Easy,</HI> that This Handmaid of sup∣planted Poetry, like the treacherous <HI>Mayors</HI> of the <HI>Palace</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> sat her down in, and possess'd, the Throne, she was design'd but as a Servant to.</P>
<P>The Learn'd will favour me with their Indulgence, while I note, for Satisfac∣tion of some Readers, of the Sex, that will be always surest to hold Interest in a Poet's Purposes, that <HI>Epic</HI> Poems are so call'd, from a <HI>Greek</HI> Term for <HI>speaking</HI>; because, here, the Verse runs <HI>narratively:</HI> as Stage Poems, on the contrary, are call'd <HI>Dramatic</HI> ones, from the same Tongue, in Reference to their being <HI>Acted.</HI></P>
<P>But it will be still more necessary, that some <HI>Definition</HI> of this Species should be also given, by an Attempter of it, who has Modesty, and wishes to avoid a Charge of high Presumption: Critics having represented it in such a formidable Light, that they could possibly have done no more, had they been join'd in a Confederacy to prevent Attempts to write at all, instead of furnishing Instructions how to write discerningly.—It will suffice, to hear but one or two of These, as Witnesses. The Voice is all the same; one Note throughout the whole Fra∣ternity.</P>
<P><Q>It is (says <HI>Rapin</HI>) the most bold, and greatest Work, that human Wit is capable of. All the Nobleness, and all the Elevation of the most perfect Genius can hardly suffice to form one such as is requisite. The Difficulty of finding, together, <HI>Fancy,</HI> and <HI>Judgment,</HI> Heat of Imagination, and Sobriety of Reason, Precipitation of Spirit, and Solidity of Mind, causes the Rarity of this Character's happy Temperament. It requires great Images, and yet a greater Wit to form them.—Finally, there must be a Judgment so solid, a Discernment so exquisite, such perfect Knowlege of the Language, in which he writes, such obstinate Study, profound Meditation, and vast Capacity, that scarce whole Ages can produce One Genius fit for an <HI>Epic Poem.</HI> And it is an Enterprize so bold, that it cannot fall into a wise Man's Thoughts but it must affright him.</Q></P>
<P>By this Time, it grows needful, that I hasten to cry out, and own, that the most <HI>vain,</HI> and empty Wretch in Nature, would be such a <HI>Poet</HI> as, conceiving the tenth Part of these prodigious Difficulties in his Way, which the <HI>French</HI> Critic had, by overheating his Imagination, taught himself to think were really there, should, notwithstanding such Belief, have Arrogance enough to undertake a Work, so terribly beyond his Compass!—under which necessary Shield of honest Truth, I will dare venture yet a little farther,—into what our own Sir <HI>William Temple</HI> has declar'd on the same Subject.</P>
<P><Q>I am apt (says he, in his <HI>Essay</HI> upon the Art we are considering) to believe so much, of the Genius of Poetry, and of its Elevation, in <HI>Homer</HI>'s and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s EPIC Works, that I know not, whether, of all the Numbers of Mankind, who live within the Compass of a thousand Years, for One Man that is born, capable of making such a Poet, there may not be a thousand born,
<PB N="39" REF="47"/>
capable of making as Great Generals of Armies, or Ministers of State, as any the most renown'd in Story.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Caveats,</HI> so high-strained as These, have made it necessary for an Epic Un∣dertaker to say something, That may justify his Modesty. A Definition of it, therefore, in the humbler Light I see it by, may hope to shew it a less arduous Adventure; and demonstrate, that the Difficulty, however certainly considerable, is by no means so insuperable, as These Gentlemen appear to think it. Critical Systems reconcile two contradictory Extremes: and are, at once, too <HI>vast,</HI> and too <HI>restrictive.</HI> The Cause is, they lean with a too partial Biass, toward a few Great Names: to whose Example they would chain down Nature.</P>
<P>Many Friends of Fancy, on the other Side, mistake for Epic Poems, any Story, told in Verse, containing a wild Series of Romantic Incidents, related of some Hero, whom the Piece takes Name from. But there are scarce two Things in Nature, which more widely differ, than these Histories in Verse, from <HI>Epic Poetry.</HI>—I wish I could have satisfied myself with <HI>Bossu</HI>'s Definition: It had sav'd me the Presumption of attempting one, myself. But <HI>His</HI> appearing to be neither <HI>full,</HI> nor <HI>clear</HI>; and having never seen a better; I am forc'd on the ne∣cessity of hazarding a new one, of my own; which will, I fear, be, still, de∣fective.</P>
<P>I take an <HI>Epic Poem,</HI> then, to mean some noble Lesson in Morality, delivered under Colour of <HI>One Action,</HI> which must be illustrious and important, in Itself, and in its Personages, interest supernatural Powers in its Successes, and be pro∣bably, delightfully, and surprisingly described, in Verse; with ornamental <HI>Epi∣sodic Parts,</HI> depending on, and rising naturally out of the main Tendency. Throughout all which the Poet keeps no view before him, but to strengthen, by Example, That one moral Lesson, he proposes to imprint, upon his Reader's Admiration.</P>
<P>To explain This Definition, by enlarging its Particulars.—A Man, who un∣dertakes an <HI>Epic Poem,</HI> is not to write a <HI>History</HI>; but to propagate a <HI>Moral. Homer,</HI> for Example, had conceiv'd such Purpose.—It was not his Design to write the <HI>Fall</HI> of <HI>Troy</HI>; That Story was already known; and could have brought no Novelty, but in the Pleasure of the Verses.—Pleasure was not his chief End: He aim'd to give <HI>Advice.</HI> His Prospect was, to teach the <HI>Greeks,</HI> split into little independent States, that <HI>Union could recover Victory, when Discord had transferr'd it to an Enemy.</HI> The <HI>Grecian's</HI> Triumph over <HI>Troy</HI> was then dis∣cours'd of with much Vanity, through all their inconfederate Divisions. <HI>Homer</HI> observ'd this Sense of <HI>General Glory,</HI> and deriv'd a Story from it, that would best enforce the Moral, he prepar'd to teach 'em: borrowing Names, and Incidents from that remember'd, and high-boasted War; but giving 'em a new, and proper Turn, for the Conveyance of his Moral only.—Had <HI>Homer</HI> not been born, till <HI>Alexander</HI> had made <HI>Greece</HI> one Monarchy, the Moral he would then have chosen had been the <HI>prosperous Effect of Power in one wise, and brave Man's Hand: and what sure Benefits accrue from Subjects Loyalty.</HI> As, we see, <HI>Virgil,</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="48"/>
living in a Time, when the Republic of the <HI>Romans</HI> had given Place to Monarchy, made it the Purpose of his Poem, to reconcile his Countrymen to single Sovereignty in the Person of <HI>Augustus:</HI> under Fiction of a Prince, brave, wise, and pious, who, being guided by the favouring <HI>Gods,</HI> establish'd, on the Ruins, of the old, a new Foundation, for Dominion of so much more Potency, that the whole Empire of the World was, by Decree of Heaven, to be included in it.—From That new Empire, then possess'd by Those he writ to, All his Readers had deriv'd their Glory: so that it was easy to induce them to confide in, and to look for, the same Blessings from <HI>their</HI> Change of Government, which their great <HI>Ancestors</HI> had gain'd, by Change of Country.</P>
<P>To impress the Moral forcibly, some <HI>Action</HI> is to be related, pointing out an Instance, in as strong a Light as possible, where this insinuated Moral was prov'd good by an <HI>Example.</HI>—The Action must be <HI>suitable:</HI> That is, of Dignity adapted to the Greatness of Events wrought into it, as Steps toward the Result last pur∣pos'd. It must be <HI>single:</HI> That is, unmix'd with other Actions of detach'd, or independent Tendency. There may be Incidents producing Incidents, the more Variety the better: but they must be such, as serve but to bring forward, and illustrate, the One final Action, which intends Example from the Work. Neither is <HI>this</HI> Restriction any Nicety deduc'd from the particular Opinion of This Critic, or of That: It is a natural Necessity; and a Law of Reason; because Actions not producing one another, as Effects from Causes, raise unpointed, and con∣fus'd Reflections; and divert, and weaken an Attention, which it is the Business of This Poem to bind down to one strong Object. An Epic Poet, of the <HI>Ariostine</HI> Model, is a Traveller, who, if his Road lay strait through <HI>Crete,</HI> would take the <HI>Labyrinth,</HI> in his Journey.</P>
<P>The Action may be <HI>feign'd,</HI> or <HI>real:</HI> If no Story, fam'd in History, can be directly levell'd to the Poet's Purpose, He may, then, invent one, to his Liking: For the <HI>Truth,</HI> here necessary, consists not in the Reality of the Events, but in the natural Veracity existing in the <HI>Moral.</HI></P>
<P>It must be <HI>illustrious,</HI> and <HI>important</HI>; and the Persons animating it, <HI>Great Princes,</HI> or distinguish'd <HI>Leaders:</HI> because Every Man submits to shrink, at Consciousness of Dangers, or Misfortunes, which he sees have Power to punish Error in these <HI>Rulers</HI> of the <HI>World.</HI> The Weakness of our Pride (that, looking down upon, conceives Itself secure, in its superior Situation, from all abject Misery) not daring to exempt itself from Menaces, It must <HI>look up</HI> to: but ad∣mitting, in this Case, the Apprehension of its own Exposure.</P>
<P><HI>It must interest supernatural Powers in its Successes</HI>; the Influence of well-in∣vented Circumstances, of this Kind, carrying <HI>Terror</HI> with it, that excites a Reverence, and induces Warmth, from <HI>enthusiastic</HI> Awefulness, into the Subject; consonant to those Impressions we are educated to religious Sense of: and which favour Disposition to derive All <HI>Good</HI> Propensities from <HI>Heaven</HI>; and throw off upon the <HI>Devil,</HI> all Instigations, which propel to <HI>bad</HI> ones.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="49"/>It must be <HI>probably, delightfully,</HI> and <HI>surprisingly,</HI> described in Verse.—<HI>Probably,</HI> because whatever we suppose impossible, we find unworthy our Attention. <HI>De∣lightfully,</HI> because Variety of well-mark'd Characters, surprising Incidents, smooth-flowing Numbers, Strength of Imagery, exalted Thoughts, and beautiful Expression, keep awake our Expectation, stimulate the Fancy, and detain us, to the Author's Purpose.—And <HI>surprisingly</HI> is added separately, tho' a connected Consequence, and unavoidable Result, from such a well-maintain'd Succession of unlook'd for, and still varying, Beauties.</P>
<P><HI>Episodes</HI> are necessary Members of extended Action: which, without them, would appear too short, and general. But all these Episodic Members must be <HI>Limbs,</HI> not <HI>Wens:</HI> They must unite with such Connexion, that displacing any <HI>One,</HI> will make the Rest imperfect; and that <HI>adding Any</HI> would disgrace the Symmetry.</P>
<P>In general, the Note most capable of height'ning our Regard to, and elucida∣ting the asserted Force of <HI>Epic Poetry,</HI> is from a Recollection, that it comes down recommended to us by a Choice and Practice, that to Reason, joins the <HI>best</HI> AUTHORITY.—<HI>And without</HI> a Parable, <HI>spoke He not to them.</HI> Being ask'd by his Disciples, WHY <HI>speakest thou to Them in Parables?</HI> His Answer is, <HI>Because to</HI> YOU <HI>it is given to understand the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven; but to</HI> THEM <HI>it is</HI> NOT <HI>given.</HI> That is, the Obstinacy of these People's Minds, misled by Habitudes of Evil, makes it necessary, that the Doctrine, I would teach them, should be cover'd, and approach attractively: where, else, the Pride, that alienates their Hearts, would rise against <HI>Conviction,</HI> press'd too plainly, and pro∣pos'd <HI>without Disguise</HI>; as Humble Men like <HI>you</HI> are willing to receive it.</P>
<P>It is probable, the <HI>Hebrews</HI> carried with 'em, out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> this delightful Way of teaching; It is clear, at least, that they arriv'd to great Perfection in it, be∣fore <HI>Greece</HI> grew civiliz'd from rude Barbarity. So far is it from true, that <HI>Homer,</HI> or some other Poet of his Country, was Inventer of the <HI>Epic</HI> Species. All the Books of the Old Testament abound with Instances, which prove the Skill of <HI>Hebrew Poets.</HI> And the Six hundred thousand Volumes in the <HI>Ptolemaic Library</HI> could hardly fail to have contain'd some of their Poems of this Kind, in their due Length and Dignity.</P>
<P>To shew how little Difference there is, except in Ornament, and Size, between the Epic Poem, as above defined, and the short Parables, I have been speaking of, I will select <HI>Two</HI> only: the first, taken from the Mouth of <HI>Christ Himself.</HI> The other I will go so far more backward for, as to the Reign of <HI>David,</HI> who was King of <HI>Israel</HI> so soon after the <HI>Trojan War,</HI> that he must necessarily have liv'd before the Time of <HI>Homer,</HI> to whom <HI>Greece</HI> would partially ascribe the Merit of poetically teaching moral Truth by Fable. I shall give more Instances than one, of the unwarrantable Presumption of those <HI>Grecians</HI> Vanity, in arro∣gating to Themselves a Praise for Arts they borrow'd from the <HI>Asiatic</HI> People; and the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> in particular.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="50"/>The Persecution of the Prophets, by the <HI>Jewish Priests,</HI> was what <HI>Christ</HI> pur∣pos'd to <HI>reprove:</HI> but knew, their Power was great; and that the Pride, It had inspir'd 'em with, would render a distasteful Doctrine little Fruit, if not en∣gagingly insinuated. Under this Conviction, the Divine Reprover thus addresses them. <Q>There liv'd, says he, in a far Country, a powerful Land-owner, who had planted Vineyards, rais'd Inclosures, and built habitable Farms, on a de∣tach'd Part of his Territory. He let out These to Husbandmen; and went, Himself, to where his chief Seat stood; upon a very distant Tract of his Possessions.—When the proper Season came, the Lord sent Servants to demand his Rents grown due. But those ungrateful Tenants, trusting to the Distance for Security from due Revenge, instead of Payment, <HI>murder'd</HI> the Demand∣ers; They destroy'd in the same Manner, other Servants, sent with like Com∣mission: At last, resolv'd to try their Boldness to the utmost, His own <HI>Son</HI> was sent, to whom, it was suppos'd, they could not dare refuse their Reverence. But the Tenants, on the Heir's Appearance, hoping, by <HI>His</HI> Death, to make Themselves a lasting Title to the whole Inheritance, determin'd on That exe∣crable Deed; and kill'd <HI>Him also:</HI></Q>
—The Auditors inflam'd to an impatient Indignation, interrupt the Story, in this Part of it, and cry out angrily— <Q>The Lord should have destroyed Those wicked Wretches, and let out his Vineyard to honester Husbandmen.</Q>
And, there, condemn'd by their own Sentence, and struck dumb by conscious Shame, they catch the <HI>Application,</HI> before <HI>Christ</HI> pro∣ceeds to make it: for, as the Text expresses it, <HI>They consider'd his Parable, and perceiv'd, that he spoke of</HI> Them.</P>
<P>In the second Instance, <HI>Nathan</HI> reproaches <HI>David,</HI> who had robb'd <HI>Uriah</HI> of his Wife, and caus'd the Husband to be murder'd. But the Prophet, under∣standing well the Danger of the King's Resentment, casts about to take him by Surprize, and does it under this Disguise of <HI>Parable.</HI> <Q>I am come, says he, to ask Relief from Royal Justice, in Revenge of a poor Sufferer's Distress, against the Cruelty of his Oppressor. Two Men liv'd together: one rich, the other poor. The rich Man had exceeding many Flocks and Herds; but the poor Man had nothing, save one little Ewe-Lamb, which he had bought, and nourish'd up: and it grew up together with Him, and with his Children. It eat of his own Meat, and drank of his own Cup, and lay in his Bosom, and was unto him as a Daughter. And there came a Traveller to the Rich Man: and he spar'd to take of his own Flock, but took the Poor Man's Lamb, and dress'd it, for the Man, that was come to him.</Q></P>
<P>What Effect this little Story presently produc'd the Sequel tells us. <HI>And</HI> David<HI>'s Anger was greatly kindled against the Man: And he said to</HI> Nathan, <HI>As the Lord liveth, the Man, that has done This Thing, shall surely die, because he had no Pity.</HI> And <HI>Nathan</HI> said to <HI>David,</HI> THOU <HI>art the Man.</HI> He, then, pro∣ceeded, safely, and reproached him, that he had tyrannically given way to an ille∣gal Impulse of Desire; forcing away the only Wife, of a most faithful Subject, notwithstanding the unlimited Variety of Women, who were All His own. Had
<PB N="43" REF="51"/>
<HI>Nathan</HI> spoke the Truth thus plainly, at its opening, It had prov'd, perhaps, of dangerous Consequence to his own Life: but the Cloud of the Invention shielded him; and the King's Passions having first been artfully secur'd in the Reproacher's Interest, the Reproach'd, who had confess'd a generous Sense of the Dishonesty, while not consider'd as his own, became asham'd to disavow his Virtue, when the Guilt laid Claim to his Confession. So <HI>David</HI> said to <HI>Nathan,</HI> <Q>—I have sinn'd against the Lord.</Q>
—It is impossible to produce a livelier, or more pathetic, Proof, both of the Nature and the Power of <HI>Epic Poetry:</HI> For it is evident, that these Two <HI>Parables</HI> differ in nothing, but their Want of Names, Extent, and Paint of Circumstance, from the <HI>Poems</HI> of That Nomination.</P>
<P>From their general Nature, I proceed to the particular Consideration of this new Attempt, upon the Plan of <HI>Gideon.</HI></P>
<P>A Poet, in an Age so factious as the Last has been, must have been blind, not to discern the Usefulness of recommending <HI>Quiet,</HI> to a stormy Generation. It were saying nothing to the Purpose, to object, that we are now remote from <HI>Israel</HI>'s Case, under no Yoke of Conquest, and above all Danger from a foreign Enemy. Civil Contest will be always the most likely Means of calling in, and aid∣ing the Attempts of, such an Enemy. We have seen too recent Proofs, to doubt that Certainty. But, not to dwell unnecessarily upon our present happy Prospects, our invaded Ancestors, too often, felt the Weight of such a Situation, as had made a <HI>Gideon</HI> the most welcome Public Blessing.—Could they have <HI>found</HI> him, and could all his <HI>Miracles</HI> have serv'd but to unite them in <HI>one</HI> Wish, and <HI>one</HI> Endeavour, far less lasting, and less bloody, had Those various Insults, then, been represented, under the Disgrace whereof our History blushes, while it tells the Triumphs of so many Conquests over us,—by <HI>Romans, Saxons, Danes,</HI> and <HI>Normans!</HI>—Where, therefore, is the Nation to be found, that better ought to like, than Ours, a strong <HI>Example,</HI> to so sound a Moral, as, that <HI>tho' Disunion should enslave a People, joint Attachment to the Legal Government could soon recover, and protect lost Liberty?</HI></P>
<P>To cloathe this Moral in an <HI>Action,</HI> some such disunited People was to be made Choice of, suff'ring under foreign Conquest, from Effect of their Divisions, and, when every human Hope had fail'd 'em, rais'd, at once, from their Despair, by Union of an inconsiderable Number, under a Restorer of their Laws and Freedom.</P>
<P>This being what the Critics call the Allegorical, or General, Plan, I never could have found a fitter <HI>Action</HI> to illustrate it, than the Redemption of the <HI>He∣brews,</HI> under <HI>Gideon</HI>'s Conduct, from the Yoke of foreign Conquest, as impos'd with infinite Contempt and Cruelty, by a confederate Body of <HI>Arabian</HI> Princes; whom the sacred Writ distinguishes by the joint Name of <HI>Midianites.</HI> For the Events of this great War are, <HI>there,</HI> so comprehensively related, as to suit at once with the Design, they are selected for, and leave sufficient Scope for bold Invention, and Embellishment, in the particular Deduction. Whereas the Scripture History of <HI>David</HI> (Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI>'s Choice) was a <HI>completed</HI> one, as Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI> has objected to it, and is so circumstantially describ'd, as to restrain a
<PB N="44" REF="52"/>
Poet's Fancy. Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> for this Reason, could not have succeeded, in That favourite Design of His, for forming a new Epic Poem from the Story of our Civil Wars in the last Century. Yet, I remember he has somewhere told us, that King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, whom he had acquainted with his Purpose, very much approv'd it: notwithstanding which, I take it to have been to the Advan∣tage of That Great Man's Memory, that his Design was never executed. The Story was too recent, to be treated, as it ought; and the sublimest Beauties of Invention would have lost their Force on Readers, in whom sad and deep Impres∣sions, from the Misery of the real Facts, must needs have made All Fiction seem too <HI>sportive,</HI> and an unbecoming Freedom taken with their solemn Sorrow. It was the very Case of <HI>Lucan</HI>; and his Subject barring out all Aids of the Poetic Kind, at least Those warm ones, which let loose Imagination, his <HI>Pharsalia</HI> gain'd no Rank but among <HI>Histories</HI>; and <HI>Verse,</HI> indeed, is all the Right of That great Work to be consider'd, as a <HI>Poem.</HI></P>
<P>The Mention, here, of Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI> leads me to remember an Objection, which, I think, he has unjustly made to Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI>'s Choice of Subject, merely as a foreign one: as if it were a Violation of that natural Respect, a Poet owes his Country, to look out of it, for a great Character! If Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI> had no better Reason for this Censure, than that since <HI>Homer</HI> was a <HI>Grecian,</HI> and has writ of <HI>Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> being a <HI>Roman,</HI> writ of <HI>Romans,</HI> therefore, Mr. <HI>Cowley,</HI> as an <HI>Englishman,</HI> should have approv'd no other than an <HI>English</HI> Hero, the Argu∣ment appears, to me, to be a very narrow, and mean-spirited one.—Nature is Nature every-where; and I should never look for any Force of manly Reasoning, from a Soul not large enough, to comprehend Mankind as One Fraternity.— However, more is to be said, in Favour of a <HI>Hebrew</HI> Subject, than of All, or Any of, the Rest, whatever.—The Reverence, we conceive, from the Old Testament, for Those Objects of God's more immediate Care, has made Them <HI>Every Body's Countrymen.</HI> Besides, the many <HI>Miracles,</HI> so terribly display'd among them, are peculiar Helps, to a Poetic Fancy; and adorn their History, above that of <HI>Any</HI> other Nation. Their Country was the Scene, too, of our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Life, and Sufferings, a Reflection, which entitles it to Veneration, from All <HI>Christians.</HI> And, to add one smaller Circumstance, that still gives Strength|'ning to their Claim, They were Inventers, or, at least, Improvers, and great Practisers, of <HI>Poetry.</HI> The <HI>Song</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> their first Leader, lists Him early in the Number.—<HI>Miriam, Deborah, David, Solomon,</HI> and innumerable other of their Nation, were fine Poets. And This ought, methinks, to recommend their Memory to the Respect of such, who would be thought so, after them.</P>
<P>Having said this, the Reader, I believe, will hardly be displeas'd to see a <HI>Specimen</HI> of <HI>Hebrew Poetry.</HI> We meet with many noble ones, in the Old Testa∣ment; but they have the Misfortune to lie shadow'd under obsolete Translation. —One of our Critics has done Justice to the noble Images of these Originals, when he declares, that <HI>there is nothing, so soft, so tender, and pathetic, and at
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>
the same Time, nothing so grand, so majestic, so terrible; and so barmonious, as the Poetic Part of the Bible: to which All the Heathen Verse is flat, and low.</HI></P>
<P>I look upon the <HI>Song</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> which <HI>Josephus</HI> says, was written in <HI>Hexameter Verse,</HI> to have been a Kind of <HI>Lyric Ode,</HI> because it seems to have been sung, to some String-Music, and to certain measur'd Motions of the Body. This is plainly gather'd from the Text. <Q>And <HI>Miriam</HI> the Prophetess, the Sister of <HI>Aaron,</HI> took a <HI>Timbrel</HI> in her Hand, and all the Women follow'd her, with <HI>Timbrels,</HI> and with <HI>Dances.</HI></Q>
—And, when <HI>Moses,</HI> and the male Singers, had open'd the Ode, <HI>Miriam,</HI> and the Women, answer'd, as a <HI>Chorus,</HI> <Q>Sing ye to the Lord, for He hath triumph'd gloriously: The Horse, and his Rider, hath he thrown into the Sea!</Q></P>

<P>It will not be denied, that here is the <HI>Sublime</HI> among these Images, more glow∣ing, than in any <HI>Greek,</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Writer.—When <HI>Longinus</HI> seems to have been moved so strongly by That prais'd Exaltedness of Thought, where <HI>Moses,</HI> to express GOD's Power, with Energy, describes Creation, not in its extended gra∣duatory Progress, but as starting to Existence <HI>at a Word</HI>: <Q><HI>Let</HI> there <HI>be</HI> Light: and there <HI>was</HI> Light</Q>
—I half suspect, with the <HI>French Critic,</HI> He had heard of, but <HI>not seen,</HI> the <HI>Hebrew Bible.</HI> He could never else have passed by the prodigious Greatness, in the Paintings, and Conception, of the Ode foregoing; and in many other Tracts of <HI>Scripture Poetry.</HI> Would he have so profusely given his Admiration to this Passage, out of <HI>Homer,</HI> <Q><L>"At ev'ry Step th' immortal <HI>Neptune</HI> took,</L>

<L><HI>Sunk,</HI> thro' their trembling <HI>Roots,</HI> to 'scape his Sight.</L></Q>
<P>We may pity, then, the <HI>Grecian Vanity,</HI> that would divide the Honour of inventing Poetry, between their <HI>Orpheus, Stesichorus, Alcman, Pindar,</HI> and a Number of their Countrymen; whereas, in Truth, the oldest of all These, who was <HI>Orpheus,</HI> was but a Cotemporary with <HI>Gideon:</HI> in whose Eleventh Year he went, a young Man, with the <HI>Argonauts</HI> to <HI>Colchos.</HI> — Now <HI>Gideon</HI> was 200 Years <HI>since Moses</HI>; and yet <HI>Moses</HI> died not till the Year of the World 2454. Forty-one years after writing the foregoing <HI>Ode,</HI> which must have been at his first landing in <HI>Arabia,</HI> after crossing the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> in the World's Year 2413.— So that the <HI>Hebrews</HI> had the practical Perfection of the <HI>Lyric</HI> Species for at least 200 Years before the Birth of this Assumer, <HI>Orpheus,</HI> whom the <HI>Greeks</HI> pretend to have been its original Inventer.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="56"/>It is, indeed, the most unreasonable Improbability, that <HI>Greece</HI> should have been skill'd in so refin'd an Art as <HI>Poetry,</HI> when she was little better than a <HI>Savage</HI>; so deficient in Improvements of this ornamental Quality, that, as St. <HI>Augustine</HI> has noted, the more necessary Use even of the <HI>Grape</HI> was still unknown to the politest of those People (the <HI>Athenians</HI>), till by <HI>Dionysius,</HI> in the Time of <HI>Moses:</HI> and a <HI>Greek</HI> Poet, wanting <HI>Wine,</HI> had miss'd a surer <HI>Inspiration,</HI> than his <HI>Muse</HI>'s. —<HI>Ericthonius</HI> of <HI>Athens</HI> was the first Instructor of his Countrymen, to yoke their Beasts, for <HI>Plowing:</HI> and That, not till <HI>Joshua</HI>'s Days: And it was then, too, that the Use of <HI>Letters</HI> was communicated to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> by <HI>Cadmus,</HI> from <HI>Phoe∣nicia,</HI> a close Borderer on the <HI>Hebrews.</HI>—Before that Time, having no <HI>Alphabet,</HI> how could they make Pretence to <HI>Writing?</HI> The same national Vanity was mani∣fest again, in their asserting <HI>Ida,</HI> and <HI>Dactylus,</HI> who liv'd but after <HI>Joshua</HI>'s Death, during the Government of <HI>Othoniel,</HI> to have discovered the first Use of <HI>Iron</HI>; when 'tis plain, from the Old Testament (<HI>Genesis</HI> iv. and 22.) that <HI>Tubal Cain,</HI> above a Thousand Years before, had <HI>taught Artificers the Workmanship of</HI> Iron <HI>and</HI> Brass: And nothing can be more demonstrable (from the so often-men∣tioned <HI>Chariots, Weapons, Armour,</HI> and vast Magazines of warlike Furniture of all Kinds, which we read of, among Kings of <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Assyria</HI>), than that the People of the <HI>East</HI> were exquisitely skill'd in such mechanic Knowlege, at a Time, when <HI>Greece</HI> had yet no Name among the Nations. <HI>Thucydides,</HI> their own Hi∣storian, has confess'd, that in these early Days, wherein she would pretend to arrogate Inventions never Hers, she was unciviliz'd, and wholly rude: her Lands uncultivated, her Towns few, and mean, and the Employment of her <HI>Heroes,</HI> and high <HI>Demi-Gods,</HI> to rove for Robberies, by Sea and Land; steal Horses, and make bold with other People's Cattle; without Sense of Shame, or Secrecy.</P>
<P>But I forget the <HI>Elegy,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> justly calls a most poetical, and ex∣cellent one. — He purpos'd to have clos'd his <HI>Davideis</HI> with it.— It appears to me a Master-piece of the <HI>pathetic</HI> Kind: and I produce it, as an Instance, that the <HI>Hebrews</HI> were thus skilful, in the <HI>simple</HI> Species; which the <HI>Greeks,</HI> too, with their usual Modesty, put in for the Invention of, long after this fine Piece had been composed by <HI>David.</HI></P>

<P>I have said enough, I hope, to justify my Choice of <HI>foreign</HI> Action, and a <HI>Hebrew</HI> one particularly.—I come now to the new Structure of my Verse: where I have us'd the Liberty of <HI>varying,</HI> every-where, the <HI>Measure,</HI> and of mixing, in one Poem, All the different Kinds, that can be rank'd among <HI>Heroic.</HI>—What I hop'd from this Extent of Latitude was, to derive Increase of <HI>Power,</HI> as well as <HI>Harmony.</HI> But, as this Choice, and Application of such bold Diversity of Num∣bers, will require, and merit, some Defence, I will begin it with a previous Note or two in Answer to a modern Cry, that has been rais'd against the Use of <HI>Rhyme,</HI> in general.</P>
<P>It has been attack'd, but, since we learn'd to <HI>read,</HI> and understand, <HI>Blank Verse,</HI> from Mr. <HI>Milton</HI>'s noble Work: which (by the way) lay half an Age▪ at lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>,
<PB N="50" REF="58"/>
<HI>unfelt, unfriended,</HI> and <HI>un-notic'd,</HI> in the Country It now casts so bright a Lustre on. The Copy of it was (with <HI>Doubt</HI> and <HI>Hesitation</HI>) bought—for infamous TEN POUNDS! which not being made demandable but on Condition of a <HI>new Impression,</HI> never was receiv'd, at all; Its Author having been in his neglected Grave near Thirty Years, before his matchless Poem (and <HI>then</HI> only by Effect of <HI>One</HI> Man's single Penetration) drew the least Regard upon it from his Country∣men! to the eternal Scandal be it noted, of our high-presum'd Discernment, and the miserable State of <HI>Patronage,</HI> among us!—This was the hospitable Welcome Blank Verse found, in <HI>England:</HI> And, <HI>now</HI> (so strangely can our Currents <HI>turn!</HI>) our Gentlemen of the new Light are indispos'd to <HI>see,</HI> by <HI>any other.</HI> They affect the Reputation of a Judgment too severe, to be delighted by Effect of <HI>Sounds:</HI> and would explode all Consonance of Termination, as too trifling, and effeminate, for Ears of Understanding.</P>
<P>What they have objected may, I think, be summ'd up in these few Particulars. <HI>Rhyme</HI> was a <HI>Goth,</HI> and came in with the <HI>Runic</HI> Impoliteness: Rhyme is <HI>unnatural:</HI> because it puts Constraint upon Expression: Rhyme is <HI>needless</HI>; because Blank Verse has nobler Harmony, and gives complete Delight without it.</P>
<P>As to the first of These, 'tis quite mistaken. Rhyme <HI>did not</HI> come in with those Barbarities, they charge it to: and, if it <HI>had</HI> done so, what nobler Parentage could It have been deriv'd from, than the <HI>same to which we owe our Plans of Liberty?</HI> But, in Reality, It had a far more antient Origin. The <HI>Hebrew</HI> Poetry was writ with Rhyme. The <HI>Persian,</HI> and <HI>Arabian,</HI> so peculiarly depended on this Ornament, that they have a Kind of Poem in distinguish'd Reverence among them (and call'd <HI>Cacideh</HI>) deriv'd from immemorial Practice, and devoted to the Praise of GOD, and godlike Characters. Its Frame contains from 50 to 100 Ladies: the two leading Verses rhyme together, and the Rest alternatively, ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ping▪ throughout, but two Rhymes only. So that these Poems run the long<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n they light upon such Terminations, as afford most Consonances. There are many such, of <HI>Giami, Hasis, Schemi, Enviri,</HI> and others. Some of them appear to have been moderniz'd <HI>Reductions</HI> (as our <HI>Chaucer</HI>'s Works, by <HI>Dryden</HI>) their old Language being grown obscure, in Both of the Countries above-mentioned.—So, this Argument, of Rhyme's Defect from want of due Antiquity, will carry little Weight against it; and might have an Answer still more pointed and particular, if it deserv'd to be allow'd, that Any-thing, in its own Nature good, could be the less so, for its <HI>Novelty.</HI></P>
<P>They call Rhyme <HI>unnatural,</HI> because it puts Constraint upon Expression; which, however, is <HI>not true</HI>; for Poets have not only Liberty of <HI>changing</HI> stubborn Rhymes for ductile ones, but are <HI>oblig'd to do it,</HI> till they find such new ones, as <HI>assist</HI> the Sense, instead of stiffening, or obscuring it. But, were there All the <HI>Force</HI> they would ascribe to it, in this Objection, from <HI>Constraint</HI> on the <HI>Expres∣sion,</HI> what a <HI>partial Eye</HI> is Theirs, who censure such Constraint, as an unpardonable Slavery, where authoriz'd by Custom in a <HI>modern</HI> Tongue; yet see no Conse∣quence
<PB N="51" REF="59"/>
but That of a <HI>pretended Beauty</HI> where it borrows Sanction, but from the same Authority, of <HI>Custom,</HI> in the Antient Languages?</P>
<P>For, not to rest upon their hard, and troublesome Restraints, to <HI>Quantity,</HI> what Curb can possibly be more oppos'd to <HI>Nature,</HI> and her easy Order of <HI>Ex∣pression,</HI> than their interweaving Words, and ranging them in so remote, and dis∣locative a Position, as the <HI>patulae</HI> in <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Verse hereunder, from the <HI>fagi,</HI> it immediately related to? for, while the genuine Construction is, <HI>You, Tityrus, re∣posing under the Shade of a spreading Beech,</HI> the <HI>Latin</HI> was constrain'd, before it could arrange the Line to Harmony, to force it into this distorted Order.</P>
<Q><L>Tityre, tu, <HI>patulae</HI> recubans sub tegmine <HI>fagi.</HI></L></Q>
<P>That is, in <HI>English</HI> of the same Position,</P>
<Q><L>Tityrus, you, <HI>of a spreading</HI> reposing under the Shade, <HI>Beech.</HI></L></Q>
<P>What strange Perplexity is, here (by Custom, which we can indulge, with∣out a Question) thrown upon the <HI>Sense,</HI> to liquidate the <HI>Sound,</HI> and make the Measure <HI>musical!</HI>—Let the Reproachers of <HI>constrain'd Expression</HI> shew where <HI>Rhyme</HI> has ever wrung an <HI>English</HI> Verse into so cramp'd a Posture.</P>
<P>So, again, in <HI>Martial,</HI></P>

<Q><L>Chast her Sword when had deliver'd Arria to Paetus.</L></Q>
<P>It must not be pretended, that these Instances are <HI>chosen</HI> ones. The very Genius of the <HI>Roman</HI> Tongue made such disjointed Shuffle of the Words, for ever necessary: And, yet, which of our Exploders of the <HI>infinitely less-constrain∣ing</HI> Use of <HI>Rhyme</HI> would think it reasonable to condemn the not to be disputed Elegance of <HI>Latin Verse,</HI> in Detestation of a Practice, which is <HI>visibly unnatural?</HI></P>
<P>Even their celebrated <HI>Horace,</HI> notwithstanding his peculiar Claim to the <HI>Con∣cinnitas,</HI> and That <HI>Curiosa Felicitas,</HI> so exquisitely fine, in his Expression, could no more sail free from the oblique Propulsion of this <HI>Side Wind,</HI> that blew every <HI>Roman</HI> Poet wide of his true Course, than Any weaker, and more careless Pilot. Witness his</P>
<Q><L>Me doctarum hederae praemia frontium</L>

<P>What would be thought of a Writer, in <HI>our</HI> Tongue, who, when he was purposing to say clearly, <HI>Ivy Garlands, the Rewards of learn'd Brows, rank me
<PB N="52" REF="60"/>
with the High Gods,</HI> should express it in this extraordinary Manner—<HI>Me of learned Ivy Garlands the Rewards Brows with the Gods rank high.</HI></P>
<P>Surely, no Man, who, knowing <HI>Latin,</HI> knows that such Constraint as This is unavoidable, in all their Versification, will pretend to argue, against <HI>Rhyme,</HI> that It can possibly deserve Explosion for a Fault, It is not half so guilty of, as This allow'd bad Practice; which is, notwithstanding, overlook'd, and held as <HI>nothing,</HI> in Comparison with the acknowleg'd Graces, in the Tongues it throws such In∣tricacy on!</P>
<P>Rhyme, then, is neither <HI>newer,</HI> in its Practice, nor less <HI>natural,</HI> in its Use, than other Licences to Verse, which, yet, its Enemies are very partially attach'd to.—We will see, in the <HI>last</HI> Charge, whether It ought to be held <HI>needless,</HI> from Superiority of Harmony, or any nobler, or more masculine Perfection in <HI>Blank Verse</HI>—or Measure without Consonance.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Roscommon,</HI> one of the first Fallers in with the Applause of <HI>Milton</HI> (newly, in <HI>His</HI> Time, beginning to attract Consenters), writes his <HI>Essay on trans∣lated Verse,</HI> in the best <HI>Rhyme</HI> he found Himself at Leisure to afford it: But, drawing near the End, and growing out of Humour with his Choice, breaks out at once into a rapturous Declamation, against <HI>Rhyme,</HI> and <HI>Bondage</HI>; in a Specimen, which he picks, here and there, and pieces artfully together, out of some of the sublimest Parts of <HI>Paradise lost,</HI> to recommend Blank Verse, where He, Himself, had just been disregarding it. I think this Manner of proceeding not a fair one: The strong Images, which animate the glowing Lines, he there selected, would have made <HI>Prose,</HI> Poetry. They shake the Fancy, and allow no Leisure to the Judgment to examine <HI>Numbers.</HI>—We are hurried on by the Exaltedness of Thought, and rise above Perception of the Mechanism! Would he have try'd the Cause impartially, he might have found a thousand Lines in <HI>Milton,</HI> every one of which had turn'd it quite to the Reverse of his Intention.</P>
<P>But now, to let the Reader see, what Kind of Verse it is, these Gentlemen would substitute in Place of Rhyme, I take the following Pattern from the men∣tion'd Lord's Translation of the <HI>Ars Poetica.</HI></P>
<Q><L>These are the likest Copies, which are drawn</L>
<L>By the Original of Human Life.</L>
<L>Sometimes, in rough and undigested Plays,</L>
<L>We meet with such a lucky Character,</L>
<L>As, being humour'd right, and well pursu'd,</L>
<L>Succeeds much better, than the shallow Verse,</L>
<L>And <HI>chiming</HI> Trifles, of more studious Pens.</L></Q>
<P>We shall presently discern, by only placing these lean Lines in the <HI>prosaic</HI> Order, whether they have any Title to their Claim of Poetry.—VERSE, in the <HI>literal</HI> Sense, we must allow it to be call'd, because we but derive the Word from <HI>turning back</HI>; and These, I own, <HI>do That,</HI> as oft as they have stretch'd them∣selves
<PB N="53" REF="61"/>
to their due Length of Measure. But observe, how readily this Prose may be <HI>unversified!</HI></P>
<P><Q>These are the likest Copies, which are drawn by the Original of Human Life. Sometimes, in rough and undigested Plays, we meet with such a lucky Character, as, being humour'd right, and well pursu'd, succeeds much better, than the shallow Verse, and chiming Trifles, of more studious Pens.</Q></P>
<P>If the Enemies to Rhyme had nothing better to produce in Room of it, than <HI>This,</HI> It would not fail to <HI>live</HI> and prosper; nor, indeed, is there an Argument they use for the Defence of their Opinion, but might better aid their Enemies; and serve (as most Deserters do) with double Violence, against its Masters. Meanwhile It is a pleasant Kind of Tyranny they are for exercising over Reason! First, they warp to their own Side the Pretence of Right to Harmony: and when they have apply'd all Sorts of Argument, unjustly, for their Service, and left none for ours, but what they think they may refuse us, as of <HI>Counsel for the Plaintiff,</HI> they would run us down, full Cry, as if we had no Weapons to defend ourselves withal.—It puts me in Mind of an honest <HI>Indian Traveller,</HI> who com∣ing, in hard Weather, to ask something, at the House of a Great Man, and be∣ing bark'd at by his <HI>Mastives,</HI> stoop'd for a Flint, but found it frozen to the Surface. Deliver me, said he, from the unreasonable People of this Country! <HI>They let loose their Dogs, and fasten their Stones.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Tragedy,</HI> Blank Verse may claim a <HI>Preference,</HI> as coming nearer to our natural Mode of Speech, and yet retaining Dignity enough, by virtue of its Measure, to exalt it above <HI>Prose.</HI> But <HI>Epic</HI> Poets speak in Person; and, describe∣ing at full Leisure, are suppos'd to have due Time for <HI>Ornament</HI>; and it will therefore be expected from them: so that Blank Verse does not suit <HI>Their</HI> Use; since where its Flatness is not animated, as in Tragedy, by restless Agitation of the Passions, It must ever lean to one of these Extremes: either degenerating to plain Prose, as in the Example before us; or becoming harsh, affected, stiff, and obsolete; as but too many Times it does, in our Great <HI>Milton,</HI> from a Purpose to induce Appearance, of the <HI>Venerable,</HI> where the <HI>Sweet</HI> was wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing.</P>
<P>The delightful <HI>Mean</HI> is <HI>Rhyme.</HI> It keeps Prose distant, yet helps <HI>Ease,</HI> as well as <HI>Energy</HI>: for it was never meant to cramp Expression, but lend Sound a Live∣liness; and, what is evidently (and indeed <HI>peculiarly</HI>) a Benefit deriv'd from this connective Aid to Recollection, is, that by Retention of the <HI>Rhyme,</HI> the Memory catching readily at the coherent <HI>Matter,</HI> it becomes much easier to <HI>hold</HI> Ideas this way given us, than in Any other Form of Words whatever▪</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnis,</HI> who was one, of a too numerous Brotherhood, who suffer Pangs, in mortifying Lengths of <HI>Labour,</HI> at the Birth of Every Rhyme, and therefore, naturally <HI>hate</HI> the Child, that cost 'em too much Pain in its Delivery, was for turning his broad Axe against our very Root of Argument, and has denied, that Rhyme is <HI>musical,</HI> because, says he, there is <HI>no Harmony in Unisons.</HI> The Face of this Pretence is specious: but It ought, before it can have real Weight, to find some Poem, where <HI>All</HI> Terminations close with the same Rhyme <HI>repeated.</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="62"/>
No <HI>one Note,</HI> indeed, will make a <HI>Tune:</HI> But, as we hear with Pleasure the same Note sounded sometimes twice, or thrice (in solemn Compositions more especially), and then give way to different ones, the artful Intermixture of All which is <HI>Music,</HI> so any tuneful Note, tho' sounded separately, and more than once, is <HI>Harmony.</HI>—No JARRING Note can stand in Music. <HI>Discord</HI> there must be; but That Discordance is to rise, from Oppositions <HI>All harmonious</HI> in their proper, and disjunctive Particles: and but differing (not <HI>clashing</HI>) into Melody, by joint Con∣currency of <HI>Variations</HI>; not of <HI>Inconsistencies.</HI>—Neither will it be needful to con∣fess, that Rhymes are <HI>Unisons.</HI> The Question is of no Importance, or it would be easy to explain their Difference.</P>
<P>Another Reason in Behalf of Rhyme is, that no Language is so naturally form'd, as <HI>English,</HI> for receiving and becoming it. The <HI>Latin</HI> Verse, tormented and con∣strain'd, as I have shewn it, in Pursuit of Harmony, could no way have admitted <HI>This:</HI> which that it was not in its Genius constituted for, or capable of, we need no plainer Proofs, than the sequester'd Muses of the <HI>Monks</HI> have furnish'd us— if ever <HI>Muse,</HI> at all, inspir'd a <HI>Monastery.</HI></P>

<P>Not even the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue could have been capable of <HI>Rhyme:</HI> nor had it truly the least want of it.—It was so musically ductile, so sonorously significant, that it was naturally a full Tide of Harmony: It seem'd to roll along, like one of its own <HI>Homer</HI>'s Torrents, down the Side of a vast Mountain; sparkling, rapid, and sounding, in all Parts of its Passage.</P>
<P>Yet, fain would I, with all the partial Fondness of a Lover, set in Balance some <HI>Defects,</HI> of this triumphant Rival of the Beauty I wish best to, against That great Advantage, which it would be Blindness to deny her claim to, in the tuneful Texture of her Cadences. I detest, for Instance, those abominable Aids, call'd <HI>Expletives:</HI> a mean, and lazy Crutch, which not the <HI>lamest</HI> Poet of <HI>our</HI>

<P>But if Sincerity refuses Patience to a calm Surveyor of this <HI>Grecian Licence,</HI> what would it not inspire Contempt to <HI>say,</HI> against the servile Disposition of a Race, call'd <HI>Commentators,</HI> who would have the Privilege, Their Poets us'd, of mixing in one Piece, their different <HI>Dialects,</HI> and altering Accents, at their Pleasure, pass for an <HI>Advantage</HI> to their Poetry! as if People, long habitu∣ated to a Pronunciation the Reverse of many of those motley Rusticisms, could, in Reverence of a worthless Skill in weaving them together, quit their natural Partiality to their own Mode of speaking!—On the contrary, rejected Idioms must have been extremely irksome to a polish'd Ear: and left a Kind of coarse provincial <HI>Brogue,</HI> upon the best Performances.</P>
<P>Were an <HI>English</HI> Poet, for Example, to avail himself of this licentious Practice of the <HI>Greek</HI> ones, in extending these five Words to <HI>Numbers,</HI> and due Length of <HI>Metre,—These People were learned Writers</HI>; and admit he should be told that, in some Counties of the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>West,</HI> it was a Custom to give drawling Prolongation to their Syllables, and open all the <HI>Diphthongs</HI>; and that, by Assist∣ance of this <HI>noble Privilege,</HI> He might spin out a Verse, thus elegantly,</P>
<Q><L>Le—ar—ned Writers These Pe—o—ple were.</L></Q>
<P>Or, because it would be Pity to want <HI>Choice</HI> of good Examples, let it be suppos'd, that the Three Words—<HI>meet, glorious, Occasion,</HI> were to be stretch'd out, on some of these <HI>Greek Tenters.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Me—et, glo—ri—o—us, Oc—ca—si—on.</L></Q>
<P>It is visible enough, the Verses are fill'd up, by Help of such a frightful <HI>Anglo-Graecism.</HI> But from what Force of <HI>Custom</HI> could we reconcile such <HI>Jargon</HI> to a <HI>London Ear?</HI> No Matter what Relief a lazy <HI>Poet</HI> might draw from it. It would never give his <HI>Reader</HI> Satisfaction. Yet, allow it but to be suppos'd, that <HI>English</HI> had been a <HI>dead Language</HI> for about a thousand Years, and now but studied, as a learn'd one, for the Sake of antient Stores of Knowlege, treasur'd up in its Re∣mains, in That Case, even the manifest Absurdity above, as grosly as it seems to shock us, in a living Tongue, had pass'd, perhaps, unnotic'd, in the dead one, or but brush'd us, with a <HI>faint</HI> Perception.</P>
<P>But Peace be to the <HI>Manes</HI> of the <HI>Greek,</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Tongues! Their very Faults are venerable; from the early Prejudice, that roots a Reverence in us, for these first Imprinters of our School Ideas.—The modern Languages have no such Right to Preference; and their Defects may be observ'd more easily, and censur'd with less Danger.—<HI>Tassone,</HI> noting a most obvious one, in the <HI>Italian</HI> Poetry,

confesses, with a candid Freedom, that he knows not, whether to impute it most to the Ill Fortune of his Country's Writers, or a certain <HI>Weakness</HI> in the <HI>Language,</HI> which, says he, <HI>wants Energy, and is unfit for high Expression.</HI> This Defect, in That so favourite Tongue, which stands acknowleg'd, by their own Consent and Testimony, chiefly flows from a Redundancy of <HI>Vowels,</HI> which, tho' sweet'ning a soft Sound, <HI>enervates</HI> it.—<HI>Italian</HI> is the Language, wherein <HI>Love</HI> would chuse to sigh, or <HI>Laughter</HI> to be light, and wanton. It supplies, with Fulness and De∣light, the Uses of Intrigue, and Conversation; but wants Weight and Spring for <HI>Passion,</HI> and bends under the Demand of <HI>Comprehensiveness.</HI> 'Tis like the flowing of soft Sand, in Hour-glasses: seeming liquid, while confin'd to its <HI>close Currency</HI>; but flies dispers'd, and opens its loose Quality, as soon as shaken out, and trusted to hard Weather.</P>
<P>Not to insist, in this Place, on the too offensive Frequency of their <HI>Elisions,</HI> I make Haste to note another, where the rash Condemners of our own Excess in <HI>Monosyllables</HI> will wonder, I find Cause to charge it. But I take their Poverty, in That Particular alone, to be the Reason, why <HI>Italian Rhymes</HI> induce a Kind of leaping Levity, upon the Terminations of their Verses. They run generally in <HI>Stanzas,</HI> the Rhymes <HI>double,</HI> and the Structure in this Order.</P>

<P>I judge with a too partial Ear, or there is something so distastefully <HI>alert</HI> (to use a Phrase of their own furnishing) in the pert <HI>Skipping,</HI> of this Verse, a Kind of <HI>Pause-check'd Recoil</HI> of Motion, like the <HI>Half whirl</HI> of a Spinning-wheel,— like the <HI>unlacing</HI> of a <HI>Muse,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Hobbes</HI> expresses it, or, to hit the Image better, in <HI>Lord Dorset</HI>'s Simile, like the unvaried <HI>Rumbling of a Wheel-barrow,</HI> that the Numbers of their serious Poems seem as ill-adapted to their Subjects, as <HI>Jigg Tunes</HI> to a <HI>Church Anthem.</HI>—We may discover, in their very Verse, the <HI>dapper Genius</HI> of their Nation: a Sort of spirited, or animal, Vivacity, that dances gaily thro' the Fancy, without stopping at the Judgment. I except their few Examples (which have been <HI>by Nature too</HI> excepted) of a fierce, yet steady, Fire, and a Reflection both <HI>profound,</HI> and <HI>volatile.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning other modern Tongues, it will be needless to say much. What has been hinted, of <HI>Italian,</HI> will effectually include the <HI>Spanish,</HI> and the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI>; the <HI>German</HI> must be own'd worth great Regard for its Antiquity, and Manliness; but will content itself with That just Praise, and claim no Merit from its Harmony. Whatever Roughness <HI>English</HI> may be thought to have retain'd, is but of <HI>Saxon Origin</HI>; and, to acknowlege a too obvious Truth, Poetry in <HI>High-Dutch,</HI> is like the <HI>Nile</HI> among its <HI>Cataracts:</HI> It may be rapid, and deep; but 'tis tumbling, and terrible: It has its Course obstructed, every-where, by Mountains it must clamber over.—To carry Poetry still further North, would be but drag∣ging her to seek for Friends, among her Enemies, the <HI>Goths,</HI> and <HI>Vandals.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> then, of modern Tongues, is fitted best for Poetry. Its copious Choice of <HI>Monosyllables</HI> (which many have been rash enough to call a <HI>Blemish</HI>) make it strong, significant, and comprehensive. Its Derivatives, from <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> have adorn'd it with Variety of Cadences; and intermix'd its masculine Excess of Consonants with a melodious Fluency, from interposing Vowels.—It adorns, and is adorn'd by, <HI>Rhyme</HI>; yet takes it in but as a Subject, not obeys it, as her Tyrant: It is grave, slow, stately, soft, swift, wanton, or majestic. It
<PB N="58" REF="66"/>
has all the Lentor of Complaint and Pity; yet has all the Transport of excursive Energy: It is an inexhaustibly full Treasury, supplied from the selected Tributes of whatever was most excellent, in other Speeches; but possesses them with so improv'd an Aptitude, as to have made <HI>That</HI> HONEY, which was raw <HI>Juice,</HI> in the Flowers It drew it from.</P>
<P>But I digress too far from what I had begun to say, upon the Structure of my Verse, which differs little from a Species, Mr. <HI>Cowley,</HI> toward the Close of the last Century, first reduc'd to Practice, and misnam'd <HI>Pindaric:</HI> But if he conceiv'd a <HI>Greek</HI> Name necessary, <HI>Dithyrambic</HI> had, I think, express'd his Pur∣pose better. From the Latitude of so diversify'd a Numerosity, there must arise a fuller Harmony, than can consist with common Measure. Else, a Concert can be equall'd by a single Instrument: our usual Couplet-writing sooner satiates, by too frequent, and too limited Returns, of the same Measure. Whereas, in this perpetual Change of Cadence, and new Course of Numbers, the Attention is beat up, provok'd, and render'd lively; the Ear, every-where, reliev'd; and Images of Actions, Sounds, or Things, how different soever they may be, are cloath'd with Words, best suited to their Nature.</P>
<P>The Compass, and the Freedom of this Range of Verse, have recommended its Attempt to many Practisers in <HI>Odes,</HI> and such brief Sallies; but, too generally, with bad Success: They check'd the Gracefulness of Stepping, by too visible a <HI>Fear</HI> to <HI>fall.</HI> Like Children, who, first learn to go alone, they took short, tottering Starts; and hung upon, and rested at, All stopping Places, they could stretch their Hands to. They confin'd their Muse, too humbly, to a <HI>Lyric</HI> Length of Leading-strings: and gave the snug, set, round-head <HI>Crop,</HI> to Stanzas, that should flow out <HI>cavalierly. Pindaric,</HI> in short Measure, is a Woman of Quality, in Knee-deep Petticoats; she may have very well-shap'd Feet: but they can never be so fine, as to atone the <HI>Indecorum. Lyric</HI> Numbers carry song-like and familiar Levity, quite inconsistent with the <HI>Epic</HI> Gravity. A few bold Writers of <HI>Pindaric Odes</HI> have ventur'd, now-and-then, as far as the <HI>Hexameter:</HI> but hardly dar'd so much as dream of the <HI>Heptametrical</HI> seven-footed Line, of fourteen Syllables: Indeed the shortest Measure is too long, unless That Length is fill'd with Meaning. For nothing can be more ridiculous, than a weak lan∣guishing Extent of Verse without proportion'd Vigour in the Sentiment: Such Verse plays loose, like some vast main Sail of a Ship, that flags, and flutters heavily upon the Prospect of a Breeze, but presently falls back against the Mast, for want of <HI>Wind,</HI> to swell it into Energy. It is in Poems such as These, where, as was paintedly express'd by Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> (but might have been <HI>still more so,</HI> by his length'ning out his second Verse to the <HI>Heptameter</HI> Extent just mentioned, and hereunder given it by an Addition only of the <HI>two</HI> small Words, in <HI>Roman</HI> Cha∣racters)</P>

He instances the Roughness, and the oft-deficient Numbers: The Truth is, Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI>'s Judg∣ment, not his <HI>Ear,</HI> deceived him. What his learn'd, and Reverend Editor would represent, as an Effect of generous Negligence, in a too active Race of Fancy, seeming to have been the cool, and most deliberate Result of wrong Election: we may plainly gather This, from his own Note to the first Book of <HI>Davideis</HI>; where he speaks of This strange Line.</P>
<Q><L>Nor can the Glory confine itself to the endless Space.</L></Q>
<P>It was in his Intention, to express the Struggle of an overflowing Lustre, labouring for <HI>Room,</HI> in the whole Breadth of Heaven.—<HI>I am sorry</HI> (says Mr. <HI>Cowley) that it is necessary to admonish the most Part of Readers, that it is not by</HI> Negligence, <HI>that this Verse is so</HI> loose, long, <HI>and, as it were,</HI> vast: <HI>It is to</HI> paint <HI>the Nature of the Thing, which it describes: which I would have observ'd in divers other Places, that else will pass for very careless Verses.</HI> And then, he names these following.</P>
<Q><L>Down a Precipice deep, down he casts them, All.</L></Q>
<P>And This,</P>
<Q><L>Like some fair Pine, o'erlooking all th'ignobler Wood.</L></Q>
<P>Painting the Image, by the <HI>Sound,</HI> is, questionless, one of the liveliest Beauties, of which Verse is capable. But how far That is done, by <HI>running out of Measure,</HI> and admitting plain <HI>Prose,</HI> as an Ornament in <HI>Poetry,</HI> I leave to be determin'd by the Judgment of the Reader. He will recollect, that <HI>Homer</HI> was, and <HI>Virgil</HI> (in his Imitation) every-where, ambitious of this verbal colouring: but They neither of 'em thought it necessary to That End, to <HI>disarray,</HI> and <HI>prosify</HI> their Numbers. On the contrary, they rais'd, and added to, their Harmony, by a melodious Latitude, that circumscrib'd, at once, and dissipated, by Effect of this all-com∣prehending Practice. Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> needed not have started out of <HI>Numerosity,</HI> to reach effectually the View before him.—For Example—</P>

<P><PB N="60" REF="68"/>And here are three successive Instances, of the great Use and Benefit, an <HI>English</HI> Poet has it in his Power to make, by sparingly (and always <HI>aptly</HI>) daring to launch out, into the long <HI>Heptameter</HI> Extent of Measure. But there will be found too much <HI>obstructive</HI> VOID, in this poetic <HI>Saul</HI>'s big Armour; if a <HI>Dwarf,</HI> in Genius, should attempt to wear it.</P>

<P>Here was nothing, that resembled <HI>Numbers:</HI> no Harmony at all, unless the Reader paus'd at <HI>Nume</HI> in the Word <HI>numerous:</HI> and if he <HI>did</HI> so pause, in that divided Word, he made a disagreeable <HI>Hiatus,</HI> in the <HI>Sense</HI>; and would have wounded a nice Ear, as harshly as an old <HI>Greek Expletive.</HI> How infinitely more majestically, flows the Verse hereunder, tho' the Measure is the same, and Both are Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI>'s!—for no other Reason but, because the Pause is, here, plac'd rightly.</P>

<P><HI>Run about,</HI> indeed, may want a little of the purpos'd Greatness, from the too light <HI>Vulgarity</HI> of the Expression.—<HI>Strive to fly,</HI> had been, perhaps, more aptly suited to both Sound, and Image. But I introduce the Verse, in this Place, only with a View to the right placing of its Pause, so wrongly judg'd in the preceding one.</P>
<P>That noble Writer seems to have been sensible of the Perplexity, this Rough∣ness of his Numbers, now-and-then, must throw a Reader into. For he gives a most exact Description of <HI>Pindaric</HI> Verse (as he then practis'd it) in his <HI>Ode</HI> upon the <HI>Resurrection.</HI></P>
<Q><L>'Tis an unruly, and a hard-mouth'd Horse,</L>
<L>Fierce, and unbroken, yet:</L>
<L>Impatient of the Spur, or Bit!</L>
<L>Now, prances stately, and anon flies o'er the Place:</L>
<L>Disdains the servile Law of any settled Pace.</L>
<L>Conscious, and proud of his own natural Force,</L>
<L>'Twill no unskilful Touch endure,</L>
<L>But flings Writer and Reader, too, that sits not sure.</L></Q>
<P>This was the true Condition under which he left it. But if he had liv'd to give the needful Hand to what he so successfully had introduc'd, 'tis probable, he
<PB N="61" REF="69"/>
would have so far chang'd his Practice, that it had been nearlier describ'd, in <HI>This,</HI> from his fine <HI>Ode,</HI> on <HI>Liberty.</HI></P>
<Q><L>The plain Heroic Strain let others take,</L>
<L>Mine the <HI>Pindaric</HI> Way I'll make;</L>
<L>The Matter shall be grave, the Numbers loose, and free;</L>
<L>It shall not keep one settled Pace of Time;</L>
<L>In the same Tune, It shall not always chime:</L>
<L>Nor shall each Verse, just to his Neighbour, rhyme.</L>
<L>A thousand Liberties It shall dispense,</L>
<L>But, yet, shall manage All, without Offence,</L>
<L>Or to the Sweetness of the Sound, or Greatness of the Sense.</L></Q>
<P>A Species, <HI>once,</HI> I think, was tried in <HI>Tragic Poetry,</HI> not wholly differing from this new <HI>Composite Order. Aristotle</HI> notes it of a Work of <HI>Cheremon,</HI> a Scholar of <HI>Socrates.</HI> The Piece was call'd the <HI>Centaur,</HI> and compos'd, he says, of <HI>All the different Sorts of Verse.</HI> He should have added, <HI>except long ones:</HI> For he disapproves That Practice, in <HI>dramatic</HI> Works, because <HI>Iambics,</HI> and <HI>Tetra∣meters,</HI> and such SHORT Measures were too skipping, and too light, for <HI>serious</HI> Poetry. Our Language carries natural Gravity, and might allow short Measures with less Lightness. Yet, they ought not to be often us'd, in <HI>Epic Writings,</HI> even of This new Sort: and never, but in Places, where they help the Harmony, without detracting from the Dignity.</P>
<P>That This Poem is divided into <HI>Twelve</HI> Books, was a Determination of so little Consequence, that 'twere impertinent to offer at a Reason for it. These are Points indifferent; and in which a Poet will not need to strengthen his own Prac∣tice by Examples. The Extent of his Design should be a Guide, in his Division of it. Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> professedly imitated <HI>Virgil,</HI> in his Choice of Twelve Books, to his <HI>Davideis:</HI> tho', I think, he might as justly have rejected <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Number, as He (<HI>Virgil</HI>) had rejected <HI>Homer</HI>'s: The Number of whose <HI>Books,</HI> too, the <HI>Roman</HI> would, methinks, more <HI>gracefully</HI> have been a Borrower of, than of his <HI>Episodes,</HI> and <HI>Incidents.</HI>—Sir <HI>William D'avenant</HI> springs quite aside from this old imitative Road; but into an Extreme, as wrong, tho' opposite. He is for neither <HI>Books,</HI> nor <HI>Proposition, Invocation,</HI> or <HI>Machinery.</HI> Like some of those stiff-hearted <HI>Puritans,</HI> who dirtied his own Times, and would hear Sermons with their Hats upon their Heads, in Defiance of <HI>Church Ceremony.</HI> He divides his <HI>Gondibert</HI> into <HI>Five Acts,</HI> as if it were a <HI>Tragedy:</HI> and Each Act into <HI>Cantos,</HI> which may hold, he says, the Place of <HI>Scenes.</HI>—This Method Mr. <HI>Hobbes,</HI> in a long prefatory Tract, thought worth his Pains to justify; but was, I think, Himself, the sole Supporter of his Argument. In Matters left indifferent, the old Way, if not <HI>best,</HI> is sure to be the <HI>modestest.</HI> For my Part, if Division into Twelve Books needs more Reason than, because the Subject offer'd Matter, for That Number, I should think it fully justified, from the Division of That People,
<PB N="62" REF="70"/>
whom it treats of, into their <HI>Twelve Tribes:</HI> If still a stronger Reason should be ask'd for, take it <HI>thus.</HI> The Action of an <HI>Epic Poem</HI> ought not to be stretch'd beyond one Year; and <HI>Twelve</HI> Months make up the Division of the Term, so limited.—And now I enter on the <HI>Referential Notes,</HI> in Every Section mark'd progressively.</P>
<P>Sect. I. L. 2.—<HI>Seek, O Soul! some Heavenly Theme.</HI></P>
<P>It was the Custom of <HI>Greek</HI> Poets to mix in one the <HI>Proposition</HI> and the <HI>Invo∣cation.</HI> The <HI>Latins</HI> (and the Moderns, mostly, follow them) propos'd their Subject first, and then invok'd Assistance from the Muses.—It becomes a <HI>Christian</HI> Poet better, to begin with <HI>Invocation.</HI> It is a Way more solemn, and propor∣tion'd to the Weight of an Address to <HI>our Inspirer,</HI> not alone to pray his Aid in the Performance, but his previous Guidance in the very Choice of what we go upon.—That <HI>Invocation</HI> should, by no means, be omitted, seems a Point agreed, for many different Reasons. A Work, that has its first Foundation in a Moral Purpose, owes a Reader (says <HI>Bossu</HI>) a good Example, for his Piety and Venera∣tion. Add, that many Things must be describ'd, in Course of these Great Poems, which the Poet not being thought in any reasonable Likelihood of com∣ing to so full a Knowlege of, by any common Means of Information, He could never hope to give his Testimony Weight enough to merit <HI>Faith,</HI> but from im∣pressing, first, his Reader's Mind, with a Conceit, that Heaven infus'd it.—Sir <HI>William D'Avenant,</HI> then, did ill, to throw aside his <HI>Prophet's Mantle.</HI> What the <HI>Robe</HI> is to the <HI>Judge,</HI> the Poet owes to <HI>Invocation.</HI></P>
<P>Sect. I. L. 18.—<HI>Redeem the Use of long-lost Poetry.</HI></P>
<P>Every body knows, that the Original of Poetry was in <HI>the Worship of the Gods,</HI> and Celebration of their Glory. It is equally notorious, how degenerate It is, since, become in its too <HI>beggarly</HI> Flattery (as Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> calls it) of Great Men. He adds, in <HI>idolizing</HI> Women; which last Observation, to discredit Gallantry He was so fitted for, and so excusable for painting, I would certainly have let alone, had I been Author of his MISTRESS.—To <HI>redeem</HI> the <HI>Use</HI> of Poetry, then, is to restore it to the <HI>Praise</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> to the Advancement of true <HI>Virtue,</HI> and to Animation of those noblest <HI>Passions,</HI> which lend Wings to human Ardour.</P>
<P>Sect. II. L. 4.—<HI>Wilful, they started from protective Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Among the many Arguments enforc'd by <HI>Democratic</HI> Writers, against <HI>Mon∣archy,</HI> It seems the most immodest one, and the least founded upon Reason, when they are for Listing <HI>God Himself</HI> into <HI>Their</HI> Party! From what Appearance they deriv'd this Claim, it is not easy to discover: since the <HI>Unity</HI> of Power
<PB N="63" REF="71"/>
ascribed to the Almighty, by Themselves, as well as their Opponents, does not seem, at all, to favour any Preference, of the remotest Form of Government on <HI>Earth,</HI> from That which <HI>Heaven</HI> is rul'd by. Yet there runs no Principle, more universally asserted, through the Writings of the warm Enthusiasts of the last unquiet Century, than, that GOD declared Himself aloud for the Republican System, by his personal Command to <HI>Moses,</HI> for prescribing <HI>That selected Form</HI> to his own chosen Race of People: For they insist, that the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Model was a <HI>Popular</HI> one. They hold it, too, a Claim assigned them with so full a Right to their <HI>political Free-will,</HI> that GOD submitted Laws, and Propositions, to the People's Confirmation, or Refusal: and became the <HI>Civil Magistrate</HI> of their <HI>Theocracy.</HI> That, when accordingly they found it proper to DEPOSE Him from his temporal Authority (I use the very Word, which <HI>Oceana,</HI> and many other of their Treatises, take Boldness to make free with) and to chuse Themselves a King, who should reign <HI>with</HI> them, in His Stead, GOD blam'd but their <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> confessing, and admitting, their asserted <HI>Right,</HI> (to <HI>Samuel)—It is not</HI> Thee <HI>they have rejected; but they have rejected</HI> Me, <HI>that I should not reign over them</HI>; and, that what is meant by <HI>giving them a King</HI> IN WRATH, was a Reproach, that they inclin'd to chuse a <HI>King at all,</HI> and so, but consequential Menace, that Their Monarch should enslave 'em, into a corrected Sense of That superior Happiness, they parted with, in Favour of him.</P>
<P>This still continuing to be the Light, wherein they see That <HI>Hebrew Revolu∣tion,</HI> 'twill be pulling down one Prop of their political Fabric, to make plain, in Course of these Reflections, that the Government of <HI>Israel,</HI> as assign'd by GOD, was <HI>not</HI> a Commonwealth, but an <HI>Hereditary Monarchy</HI>: and that All the <HI>Hebrew's</HI> Miseries, in those successive Slaveries they fell into, for three hundred Years to∣gether, were a natural Effect of Factions, and Confusions, which the <HI>Princes</HI> of their <HI>Tribes</HI> became divided by, upon assuming to Themselves, in their provincial Severalties, a secular Direction of the <HI>military</HI> Power, which, in their first Insti∣tution, was the <HI>Sovereign</HI>'s <HI>Prerogative, exclusively</HI>; together with a Right of <HI>Judicatory</HI> in the last Appeal on <HI>Civil</HI> Causes: only reserving to the Popular <HI>Assent</HI> or <HI>Dissent</HI> the Election, or Rejection of new Laws, originally to be brought before the <HI>Congregation,</HI> and <HI>enacted</HI> by and with the People's Approbation, and the <HI>Regal Fiat,</HI> of the Sovereign Authority.</P>
<P>I propose to leave it undeniable, that This Sovereign Power was vested in the <HI>High Priest,</HI> personally, and that <HI>Moses</HI> plac'd it, not in <HI>his</HI> defective Line, but, in his BROTHER's, who had many <HI>Children</HI>; down, successively, to whom, de∣scended the <HI>Monarchic,</HI> with the <HI>Sacerdotal,</HI> sole Supremacy; and form'd That Species of Administration, call'd <HI>Theocracy,</HI> not to be understood, as if GOD, in his own immediate Person, condescended to be <HI>King in Israel</HI>; but as assisting with his <HI>influential Presence,</HI> always virtually (and sometimes openly, and mira∣culously), to inspire, and actuate, the High Priest's Determinations. I pretend to make this System clear, in all its Branches, and to reconcile to it the whole Gradation of Events, to That destructive Period under <HI>Saul,</HI> at which Time,
<PB N="64" REF="72"/>
first, the <HI>Priestly</HI> Power became <HI>subordinate</HI> to, and dependent on, the <HI>temporal Royalty:</HI> as in the other Eastern Nations, that lay nearest to 'em.</P>
<P>It may merit Recollection, that the <HI>Papal</HI> Claim to an <HI>Infallibility, in</HI> Christian <HI>Spirituals,</HI> has sometimes made such near Approach to take in <HI>temporal Supremacy conjunctively,</HI> as in no very wide Degree to hold Itself remov'd from Prospect of a <HI>new Theocracy.</HI> And nearer still was That, of the old <HI>Caliph</HI>'s Claim, in the <HI>Mahometan</HI> first Outstart of <HI>Enthusiasm.</HI></P>
<P>Sect. II. L. 10.—<HI>Then</HI> GIDEON, <HI>wise, and generous Leader, rose.</HI></P>
<P>This Line begins the PROPOSITION, (and the Progress of the Section specifies the ACTION, of the Poem.)—In its Opening, it is <HI>general</HI>—to teach, in the Ex∣ample of the Leader nam'd, that the Inspir'd by Heaven are to apprehend no Danger, from the most unequal Opposition: all <HI>divided</HI> Power becoming weaker, on Exertion; while <HI>united</HI> moves <HI>direct,</HI> and still grows stronger, in That Motion. The Proposition next descends to the <HI>particular:</HI> declaring it to be the <HI>Redemption</HI> of <HI>Israel,</HI> from her Yoke of foreign Conquest.</P>
<P>It is a terrible Dust, the <HI>Critics</HI> raise, in their Disputes, concerning the best Way of opening Propositions. Every body agrees, with them, in recommend∣ing <HI>Modesty:</HI> but <HI>Fulness,</HI> too, seems not at all unnecessary.—I can be as unsatis∣fied with <HI>Statius,</HI> as <HI>Bossu</HI> has been, for his encumb'ring the Proposition of his <HI>Achilleid</HI> with Declarations, <HI>that his Hero had frighted the Thunderer:</HI> as also with his personal Boasts, how nobly He (the Poet) had <HI>exhausted Inspiration</HI>; inso∣much, that <HI>Thebes,</HI> so sung by <HI>Him,</HI> should reverence him, as her <HI>second Founder.</HI> In a just Dislike of This, All Men, of common Sense, must join; but, from Effect of the same Sense, they ought to quit his Cause (I mean <HI>Bossu</HI>'s), when undiscerningly attach'd to every casual Choice, of <HI>Homer,</HI> or of <HI>Virgil,</HI> he deduces an Authority to state <HI>Their</HI> Practice, as a not to be disputed Standard for All <HI>Epic</HI> Plans to follow.</P>
<P>There is a celebrated <HI>Ipse dixit,</HI> which has been too long consented to, upon this very Subject, of the <HI>Proposition,</HI> and which it is now high Time to weigh, and find too light, even after I confess it <HI>Horace</HI>'s. If I have any Notion, what it is he means, He either has meant evidently wrong, or (which 'twere bolder to suspect him guilty of) has <HI>mis-express'd</HI> his own true Meaning.—hear him, in <HI>Lord Roscommon.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Do not begin, as That old <HI>Scribler</HI> did,</L>
<L><HI>Priam's</HI> proud War, and Fate, I mean to sing.</L>
<L>What, <HI>worth such Noise,</HI> produc'd this bellowing Bard!</L>
<L>How much more just spoke <HI>Homer,</HI> always wise!</L>
<L>Muse, paint the Man, who, after <HI>Troys</HI> great Fall,</L>
<L>Manners, <HI>and</HI> Men, <HI>and</HI> num'rous Cities <HI>saw!</HI></L>
<L>Not Smoke from Fire, but Fire from Smoke, HE draws,</L>
<L><PB N="65" REF="73"/>And from <HI>This Flat,</HI> to dreadful Wonders tow'rs:</L>
<L>To barking <HI>Scyllas, Cyclops,</HI> and <HI>Charybdis!</HI></L></Q>
<P>In the first Place, I can see no Reason, why, because One Man has undertaken to describe a War, and prov'd not equal to his Enterprize, Another therefore should be <HI>arrogant,</HI> in but proposing the same Subject. And, as to <HI>Modesty</HI> of Proposition, for the want of which the Writer is here treated ill by <HI>Horace,</HI> and accus'd of <HI>Noise,</HI> and <HI>Ostentation,</HI> I am frank enough to dare confess, that the <HI>Immodesty,</HI> if there is Any here, lies too conceal'd for my Discernment. Pray, what could any Author, who design'd That Subject, have contriv'd to say upon it, <HI>less,</HI> when he was entering on the Proposition of it? Where is the too much <HI>Fire</HI> in his Beginning? Smoke in the Progress can be nothing to our Purpose: why is there more of <HI>Pomp</HI> express'd, or why more Expectation rais'd, from a plain Promise to describe the Ruin of <HI>one Town,</HI> and Death of <HI>one Man,</HI> than to shew the <HI>Manners</HI> of <HI>many Men,</HI> and treat on the Affairs of <HI>many Cities?</HI> If we were not to expect Accounts, of not alone the Things <HI>Ulysses saw,</HI> but also <HI>why</HI> he saw them, to what End then did <HI>Homer</HI> promise any thing about 'em, in his Proposition? If we were to entertain That Expectation, certainly our Hopes are higher rais'd by <HI>Homer,</HI> who assures us, we shall hear of many Cities, and of many Men, than by the <HI>other,</HI> who propos'd to set before us but the Ruin of one City, and one Man's Destruction.</P>
<P>There is a <HI>Narrowness</HI> in these implicit Reverencers. They understand, and follow in their Author's Rear, with a too creeping, and too blind Servility. Who <HI>reads,</HI> and is not <HI>Horace</HI>'s Admirer? and yet, <HI>who</HI> shall be afraid of saying, He would better have instructed us, by some intelligible plain Precept, on this Point, of <HI>Propositions,</HI> than by Two ill-understood, and wide Examples?—To conclude with my own humble Notion of the Matter, He certainly proposes well, who comprehends within his Proposition, the Extent of his whole Meaning, and adds nothing further: And <HI>He errs,</HI> as certainly, who, being scrupulously terrified, by Words without a Reason, is kept back by groundless Fear of saying more, than This or That Man would have said upon the Subject, and says <HI>less,</HI> than his own Meaning calls for.</P>
<P>Sect. III. L. 11.—<HI>Not to Pride's transient Phantoms poorly kneel.</HI></P>
<P>I would not be misunderstood, in this Place, as renouncing Reverence for the Age, I live in, or for Any Great Man, who adorns it. (I <HI>except</HI> all such, whose <HI>Minds</HI> are no Partakers in their <HI>Greatness.</HI>) What I mean by my unfashionable, and not over-politic, <HI>Abjuration,</HI> is no more, than that I blush to find, it is not thought below the Condescension of a Man of Genius, to confine his Views to little Hopes, and transient Interests from the Powerful: His Business, as I take it, being rather, to assert, and vindicate, <HI>neglected Excellence,</HI> than to be poorly prostituting his <HI>Hosannah, to the</HI> HIGHEST. The Poet, and the Priest (Antiquity
<PB N="66" REF="74"/>
so join'd 'em) ought to guide their Ends, <HI>not,</HI> by the Humours, Inclinations, or immediate Passions, of the Age, they write in. They should carry down their Prospect through <HI>Futurity,</HI> and never rate their Recompence at all the lower, from their <HI>Person</HI>'s being doom'd to <HI>die,</HI> before it reaches 'em.</P>
<P>Sect. VII. L. 2.—<HI>Had restless</HI> Midian <HI>pour'd her swarthy Hosts.</HI></P>
<P>What People these <HI>Midianites</HI> were, into what Nations divided, how govern'd, and where seated, as also who are now their Descendents, I shall have Occasion to describe in the next Book. This Race had wasted <HI>Israel,</HI> for seven Years; within the last of which, about the Time of Harvest, the Poem takes Beginning: that so, the Unity of Action might be properly maintain'd, in comprehending only their Redemption, without Retrospect to their Invasion; which had form'd <HI>Two</HI> different Actions, and destroy'd the Regularity, requir'd in <HI>Epic Poetry.</HI> Critics believe they see, that for this Reason only, <HI>Homer</HI> commenc'd his <HI>Iliad,</HI> in the tenth Year of the Siege, and <HI>Virgil</HI> his <HI>Aeneid</HI> in the last Year of the Voyage. No doubt, they had been, else, incumber'd by Excess of Matter.</P>
<P>Sect. VII. L. 5.—<HI>To These old</HI> Amalek <HI>her Standards join'd.</HI></P>
<P>This numerous and mighty Nation will have Place at large, among the Notes of the succeeding Book. They were the <HI>Hebrew's first</HI> and <HI>surest</HI> Enemies: <HI>First,</HI> because, <HI>They,</HI> first, attack'd 'em, in their March; when they were <HI>beaten,</HI> under <HI>Moses.</HI>—And <HI>surest,</HI> as the <HI>Israelites</HI> receiv'd particular Command from GOD, never to make Peace with the <HI>Amalekites,</HI> but pursue, till they had quite eradica∣ted them. And this, at last, they very nearly had accomplish'd, after many hundred Years were past, first. What, in this Affair, I find least comprehensible, is, GOD's remembring, for a People, who Themselves had long forgot, this Right to Vengeance. They appear to have deserv'd it very little: it being <HI>after</HI> their <HI>Rejection</HI> of His Care concerning them. I am at some Loss, therefore, to account for the surprising Rigour of the Curse denounc'd on <HI>Saul,</HI> by <HI>Samuel,</HI> three hundred and fifty Years after the Injury receiv'd: in Punishment of but a generous <HI>Pity,</HI> shewn to <HI>Agag,</HI> when his Prisoner. As the Compassion was a Virtue, and 'twere hard, to think the <HI>Prophet</HI>'s Love of <HI>Vengeance</HI> keener than the <HI>King</HI>'s, the Anger could arise but from a Recollection, that such Mercy, shewn to <HI>Amalek,</HI> was a Contempt express'd, of <HI>Heaven:</HI> there standing out an un-re∣peal'd Decree, for total Extirpation of That People.</P>
<P>Sect. VII. L. 17.—<HI>Their heavy Harvests load the plund'ring Foe.</HI></P>
<P>From the Story of this War, as in the Book of <HI>Judges,</HI> It was predatory, and incursive: and the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> after their first Contest, had abandon'd all the Plains, and open Country, and secur'd themselves among their Fastnesses, on rocky
<PB N="67" REF="75"/>
Mountains: while the Enemy, maintaining Winter Quarters in some Cities, which they held on Purpose, made Excursions thence, in Summer, to destroy the Har∣vest, burn the open Towns, and Villages, and carry off (as Plunder) People, Cattle, and whatever else fell into their Possession.</P>
<P>Sect. VIII. L. 2.—<HI>Where Half the</HI> MANASSAEAN <HI>Tribe,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Jordan,</HI> that rises in the <HI>northern</HI> Part of <HI>Palestine,</HI> runs, almost strait <HI>South,</HI> through the whole Length of the Country; nine Tribes, and a Half, of the Twelve, in the Division made by <HI>Joshua,</HI> of the conquer'd Lands, had been allotted the Possession of That Tract, between the western Shore of <HI>Jordan,</HI> and the Neck of the <HI>Levant,</HI> or <HI>Syrian Sea:</HI> excepting only, that the Coast Itself, together with a Breadth of some Miles inward, was possess'd by the <HI>Philistines,</HI> and the rich, and powerful trading States of <HI>Tyre,</HI> and <HI>Sidon.</HI> The other two Tribes and a Half, being Those of <HI>Reuben, Gad,</HI> and one Half of <HI>Manassah,</HI> held the Country, lying Eastward along <HI>Jordan,</HI> which was conquer'd, first of All, by <HI>Moses,</HI> from the <HI>Amorites,</HI> and their Allies. But That Half Tribe of the <HI>Manassans,</HI> which is here alluded to, had their Allotment to the West of <HI>Jordan.</HI> It was a long, but narrow, Slip of Land, which trended, from the River's Brink, 'twixt <HI>Issachar,</HI> and <HI>Ephraim,</HI> almost to the Sea Coast abovemention'd. On a Mountain, toward the East End of this Slip of Land, in Sight of <HI>Jordan,</HI> stood the City of <HI>Ophra (Gideon</HI>'s Birth-place), safe from Insults of an Enemy, by its impregnable Situation. At the Foot of this high Mountain, open'd a large, beautiful, and fruitful Valley, That of <HI>Jezreel</HI>; where the <HI>Midian</HI> Army is sup∣pos'd to lie encamp'd at This Time, whence the Poem takes Beginning. This Valley of <HI>Jezreel</HI> has been the Scene of many bloody Battles. It was there, our <HI>Gideon</HI> overthrew the <HI>Midianites, Saul,</HI> the <HI>Philistines: Achab</HI> the <HI>Syrians</HI>; And, in more modern Times, the <HI>Tartars</HI> the <HI>Saracens.</HI></P>
<P>Sect. VIII. L. 23.—<HI>This Tree a Shade o'er half the Mountain cast.</HI></P>
<P>That there was a Tree, and a Bench under it, before <HI>Joash</HI>'s House, we have the Testimony of the Bible, which informs us, that an <HI>Angel of God came, and sat there:</HI> but, that it was so large, and old a Tree, is a poetical Discovery. That it was remarkable however for its Size, and Situation, may be gather'd, from its being thought worth so particular a Notice in the <HI>sacred Story.</HI> But, because I have suppos'd it <HI>many Ages old,</HI> and yet in its full Flourish, It is necessary, I say something, in Defence, and Honour of these venerable Children of the Earth.</P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> tells us of <HI>Oaks,</HI> growing in his Time, suppos'd to have been coeval with the <HI>World Itself.</HI> Their Roots, says he, were united, and rais'd into Arches, like the Gates of Cities; and the Earth was swell'd, about 'em, into Mountains.— <HI>Josephus</HI> has made Mention of a Turpentine Tree, that was thought as old as the Creation. Mr. <HI>Maundrel,</HI> in his Journey to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> affirms, He measur'd one
<PB N="68" REF="76"/>
of the Few yet remaining <HI>Cedars</HI> of <HI>Lebanon,</HI> and found it above twelve Yards round the Body: and that, at almost one hundred Foot high, It spread out into five several Limbs, the least of which would have been singly a great <HI>Tree.</HI>—Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> informs us, that he measur'd a huge <HI>Mastic-Tree,</HI> in one of his Voyages, that was <HI>four and thirty Yards about!</HI> It is easy to infer, These vege∣table Giants must have borne the Growth of no small Number of Ages.—St. <HI>Jerom,</HI> too, relates, that he had seen the very <HI>Sycamore Tree, Zacchaeus</HI> climb'd into to look upon our <HI>Saviour,</HI> when he rode in Triumph to <HI>Jerusalem.</HI>—But the <HI>Tree of Trees,</HI> at last, is an old <HI>English Dryad:</HI> one that Mr. <HI>Evelyn,</HI> in his <HI>Sylva,</HI> mentions, with becoming <HI>Gravity</HI>; and hands down to us the Record of such a <HI>Magna Charta</HI> in its Reverence, as deserves to be remember'd, and main∣tain'd, to an immortal Length of Triumph. And no Doubt, It <HI>will be so,</HI> by those bold Sons of Liberty, who boast the Honour of their Birth within <HI>due Distance</HI> of its Shadow. The abovenam'd Gentleman asserts, from his own Knowlege, that there is This pleasant Kind of Privilege annex'd to an old <HI>Oak,</HI> which has, Time out of Memory, been the Glory of <HI>Knoll Wood, near Trely Castle,</HI> in <HI>Staffordshire:</HI> The Shade of This Tree's Boughs, he says, is very ample; and, in due Respect to its Antiquity, whoever will make Oath, on Birth of any Child who must call nobody Its Father, that This Child was actually be∣gotten <HI>within any Part of Its Shadow,</HI> the Offence is free, and stands exempted from all Cognizance, whether of civil, or ecclesiastic Magistrate.—But, to return to the Longevity of Trees, undignified by so indulg'd a <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lawson,</HI> in his Tract of <HI>Orchards,</HI> has brought reasonable Arguments to prove, a <HI>Pear</HI>-Tree's Life may be a <HI>thousand Years.</HI> And truly, if the Age of <HI>Man,</HI> before the Flood, was from Six hundred to Nine hundred Years, it can be no great Rashness to imagine, that an <HI>Oak,</HI> so much more durable, and solid, in its Sub∣stance, and not subject to the Dangers and Diseases, which disorder human Bodies, may be capable of living many thousand Years; the Soil suppos'd <HI>adapted,</HI> and no Accident arising, that might interrupt, or stop its Progress.— And thus much I thought it not amiss to note, in Reference to the Age I have assign'd the <HI>Oak of Gideon.</HI></P>
<P>Sect. IX. L. 1.—<HI>The Morning rising over</HI> Israel<HI>'s Spoils.</HI></P>
<P>The Description, which this Verse begins, I took some Pains to make a pleasing one; but would not have it thought, I introduc'd it, to make Way for Ornament.—Not but <HI>Description</HI> is the <HI>Life</HI> of Epic Poetry; and it is There (as <HI>Boileau</HI> well observes) the Poet ought to lavish all his Fancy, and his Rhetoric; yet, if it serves no other End than mere <HI>Delight,</HI> the Poem will be found to languish; for, the Race of <HI>Action</HI> is too coldly stopp'd, in Favour of <HI>detach'd Ideas.</HI> BOSSU writes much, to say a very little to the Purpose, in his Chapter of <HI>Descriptions:</HI> Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> is more clear, and hits the Point directly, in one short Remark of his Discourse against <HI>Prince Arthur. Descriptions,</HI> says this Gentle∣man,
<PB N="69" REF="77"/>
<HI>ought never to be made, in Epic Poems, unless necessary; which they never can be, but in one of these two Cases; either where of Use, for giving us a reason∣able Account of some Part of the Action, whereby to make it</HI> probable; <HI>or when they serve to</HI> imprint strongly <HI>some important Circumstance.</HI></P>
<P>It is in this last View, that the Description of the Morning, dawning over <HI>Gideon,</HI> shadow'd by his Oak, was introduc'd, in order to impress a strong Con∣ception, not of the Place and Posture simply, but of all the hostile Prospect opening before him, to convey a local Image, and transmit the Sense of Danger, and of his Reflections on it, from the <HI>Hero</HI>'s, to the <HI>Reader</HI>'s, Passions, as we see in common Life how forcibly Regards of <HI>Place</HI> assist Imagination. He, who had seen <HI>Edge Hill,</HI> or <HI>Newberry,</HI> or <HI>Naseby,</HI> would have found himself more strikingly attach'd, in reading the Accounts, our History records of those three Battles.</P>
<P>Sect. X. L. 12.—<HI>Here and there, high-mettled Steeds.</HI></P>
<P>The Use I make of <HI>Horse,</HI> in the Progression of this War, being frequent, and considerable, I take Occasion, from their first being mention'd, in this Verse, to assert the Use of <HI>Cavalry</HI> among the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> lest some hasty <HI>Doubt,</HI> perhaps, might censure it, as not in Practice, in That early Period. And the rather, be∣cause <HI>Homer,</HI> writing of a War much <HI>later,</HI> makes no Mention in His Work of <HI>Horsemen:</HI> but describes That noble Creature in no other Manner, than as har∣ness'd to the skirmishing little <HI>Chariots,</HI> of his <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Trojan</HI> Captains.—How this happen'd in the <HI>Iliad</HI> I am not able to account for: tho', that his Country∣men were then unskilful to <HI>back Horses,</HI> I can easily enough believe, because, not long before, they had mistaken the first Horsemen they had ever seen for com∣pound Creatures, Half-Man Half-Horse, and given 'em the Name of <HI>Centaurs:</HI> from the Business they seem'd fondest of, which was, to steal their <HI>Cattle.</HI> But, that such, too, should have been the Case among the <HI>Trojans,</HI> must not be so readily admitted. <HI>Troy</HI> held the Empire, then, of <HI>Asia Minor,</HI> and drew power∣ful Allies to her Assistance, from so many distant Places, that it is impossible to fancy, they were All unskill'd in <HI>Riding</HI>; when so many Ages before That, the Wars all over <HI>Asia</HI> had been dreadfully distinguishable for the Number of their <HI>Cavalry —Ninus,</HI> the Founder of <HI>Nineveh,</HI> had enter'd <HI>Bactria</HI> with Two hun∣dred thousand <HI>Horse,</HI> besides his Chariots; which were above a Hundred thou∣sand; <HI>Semiramis,</HI> his Wife, who was the Builder of <HI>Babylon,</HI> invaded <HI>India</HI> (says <HI>Suidas</HI>) with a Million of <HI>Horsemen:</HI> and of <HI>Chariots</HI> arm'd with <HI>Scyths</HI> at the End of their Axle trees, above a Hundred thousand, also.</P>
<P>It may be surmis'd, that Horsemen in such Numbers, in those early Ages, pro∣bably were over-rated by the Inaccuracy of Historians: Let it be so; It has no Force against the <HI>Use</HI> of Horse in War, so antiently.—If, therefore, the <HI>Assyrians</HI> thus abounded in their Cavalry, It must be past Dispute, that bordering Nations also had the Use of 'em: and cou'd not have come so far with Purpose to invade
<PB N="70" REF="78"/>
the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> without bringing Numbers, in their Armies.—As for the <HI>Hebrews</HI> Themselves, <HI>Scripture</HI> is full of Instances, how early They were able <HI>Horsemen:</HI> and it had been strange, indeed, to find them otherwise, when we remember they came out of <HI>Egypt:</HI> where the <HI>Pharaohs</HI> were so generally powerful, in Arms, and so particularly furnish'd with fine <HI>Cavalry,</HI> that <HI>One</HI> of 'em pursued the <HI>Hebrew</HI> People, in their March to the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> with <HI>Fifty thousand Horse</HI> (says <HI>Josephus</HI>) and Two hundred thousand Foot; <HI>besides</HI> all the <HI>Chariots,</HI> of <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>Sect. X. L. 14.—<HI>In other Parts, the Scyth-arm'd Chariots driv'n.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning these Chariots, an antient and terrible Invention, and of infinite Effect, in those vast open <HI>Plains,</HI> of <HI>Asia,</HI> the most proper Place to speak, at large, will be in the Remarks upon the second Book: and, there, a full Description will be found, not only of the Chariots Themselves, but of the different Ways of <HI>using,</HI> and <HI>avoiding</HI> them; and what Effects they <HI>did</HI> produce; and might have been made capable of producing.</P>
<P>Sect. X. L. 22.—<HI>The tortur'd Drums, and sprightly Trumpets join'd.</HI></P>
<P>The Antients made great Use of <HI>Drums</HI>; though differing, in Shape, and Mode of beating, from the Ways in modern Practice. They were not struck upon by <HI>Sticks</HI>; but with strong Pulsion of the Hands alone, and both at Top and Bottom; being ornamented, round their Rims, with thick-set Plates of jingling Brass.— And certainly, such Drums must have deriv'd their Use from the most early Times; having been found with the <HI>Chinese,</HI> when first discover'd by the <HI>Europaeans.</HI> And, for the <HI>Trumpet,</HI> there are such concurring Proofs of its Antiquity, in <HI>Holy Writ,</HI> that I was much surpriz'd at Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Assertion, in his Notes on <HI>Homer,</HI> that it was not yet invented, in the <HI>Trojan War!</HI> That War was in the Time of <HI>Abdon</HI>'s judging <HI>Israel</HI>; and Trumpets were so long before in Use among the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> that the <HI>Ark</HI> was never mov'd, nor any Congregation summon'd, but by the Sound of this known Instrument. They had a Festival, too, call'd the Feast of <HI>Trum∣pets.</HI> The Walls of <HI>Jericho</HI> fell down, at Sound of <HI>Joshua</HI>'s <HI>Trumpets. Gideon</HI> blew a <HI>Trumpet,</HI> and All <HI>Abiezer</HI> was gather'd after him. <HI>Moses,</HI> in the very Wilderness, directs the making Silver <HI>Trumpets,</HI> whose Shape, and Dimensions suit exactly with Those, now, among us.—How has Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> then form'd this Notion, that they knew no Use of Trumpets in the <HI>Trojan</HI> War? Was it, because he found it not in <HI>Homer?</HI> Possibly his <HI>Greeks</HI> were, yet, too rude to have ac∣quir'd the Practice in their Armies. Possibly they held it too inspiring, and exci∣ting: as we read, that some of their vain Countrymen (the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI>) rejected it, long after, as a Stirrer up of Courage: which, it seems, they had a mind to represent, as naturally over-active, in their Constitution.—Therefore, march'd to Battles with the soft appeasing Sound of <HI>Flutes</HI> and <HI>Flagelets,</HI> before 'em: They would induce their Enemies to think, They rather found it needful to correct the
<PB N="71" REF="79"/>
overboiling of their Ardour, than propel and irritate it. <HI>Virgil,</HI> however, gives <HI>Aeneas</HI> a Trumpeter; and says, He had, before, belong'd to <HI>Hector: Virgil,</HI> therefore, thought the Trumpet was of That Antiquity: and, out of all Dispute, It was of older Origin.</P>

<P>From <HI>design'd</HI> Effect of those fine Prospects, which lay stretch'd before him: For the natural, and improv'd Embellishments of such a fruitful Valley, when survey'd together with the Enemy, whose Rapine held it from the famish'd Own∣ers, must inflame the Spirit of a suffering Observer, into aggravated Sense of what he felt, and <HI>apprehended,</HI> for his Country. The natural Consequence of such a Flame, in such a Mind as <HI>Gideon</HI>'s, was the rousing all those Passions, which break out in his Soliloquy:—and serve to open his true <HI>Character:</HI> the Reader being, yet, a Stranger to it: and It must have touch'd him in a fainter, and less animate∣ing Manner, had It been, in a cool Form of <HI>Narrative,</HI> anticipated to him.</P>
<P>Sect. XI. L. 24.—<HI>Now, were some single Pow'r a gen'ral Bliss.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Hebrews,</HI> after <HI>Joshua</HI> was dead, concluded only a slight War, of little Consequence, in the South Parts of <HI>Judah,</HI> during the Reign of <HI>Phinehas</HI>; and then, with one concurrent Lapse from any further Application to their instituted Modes of military Practice under general Attachment to <HI>dependent Regulation,</HI> threw That Care, in a <HI>divided</HI> Trust, to their provincial Heads of Tribes: who, now, had their allotted <HI>Severalties,</HI> in Territory, and in Civil, and <HI>Palatinate</HI> Pretensions: and fell in with the whole People's Disposition to improve, and cul∣tivate their <HI>Lands</HI>; drinking (as the Text expresses this Desertion of the Public Duty, for the private Interest) <HI>Every Man under his own Vine, and</HI> eating <HI>under his own Fig-tree.</HI></P>
<P>This universal Spirit of Defection met too little Opposition, from a Want of due Attention in their <HI>priestly Sovereigns,</HI> to the <HI>Civil</HI> Branch of their Prerogative, and of the <HI>Military</HI> still more willingly; as from their Turn of Education, less adapted to its Duties. They depended on the awful Influence of their divine Pre-eminence, and their Possession of the <HI>Ark of God,</HI> whereto lay All Appeals, and to whose final Sentence, in the <HI>High Priest</HI>'s Voice, the People were injoin'd im∣plicit, and direct, Obedience, under Penalty of <HI>present Death, by stoning</HI>; so, they took no Care to educate some martial Genius (such as <HI>Joshua</HI>'s had been), and to <HI>attach him, by his Interest,</HI> to sole Dependence on the Royal Safety: under whose delegated Right to That Supremacy in warlike Exercise, the Tribes had been, till then, enur'd, and disciplin'd, and held unitedly together.</P>
<P>The Knot had long been loosening; but Love of Ease, and Taste of Luxury, now all at once dissolv'd it.—Till this fatal Lure, in their detach'd Divisions of the <HI>Land,</HI> the Want of Property among Particulars sustain'd no other than the
<PB N="72" REF="80"/>
general Interest. Hope of the <HI>future,</HI> from the State's Prosperity, kept every Individual Easy in his <HI>present</HI> Indigency: The joint Distress of their collective Body held it close compacted, like a Heap of Pebbles, in a watry Soil, froze hard to∣gether: The new Warmth of Self-dependency, dissolving the Adhesion, Every Off-falling Pebble became a <HI>separate Body,</HI> and contributed no longer to the Tex∣ture of the <HI>Universal.</HI> In this dispers'd Condition, what, before, had been <HI>im∣moveable,</HI> by virtue of its <HI>Weight,</HI> lay liable, thenceforth, to be trod down by every Hoof; and only magnified its Breadth, to ruin its Consistency.</P>
<P>Plenty in Ease was the first Step toward Anarchy: It drew on Disregard of public Happiness: The next was Wealth with Luxury; to which succeeded Pride; and That, in natural Consequence, produc'd Contempt of Law; soon follow'd by Defiance of Authority. The sure Result of All together was Dissension, and Confusion.—Turbulent Ambition set up Every <HI>Tribe</HI> to wish, and act, with views to Independency; and under this relax'd Insensibility to National Coherence, the Remainder of the <HI>Canaanites</HI> (whom Avarice, not Mercy, had too indiscretely spar'd) took Arms against so visible a Weakness; and succeeded frequently in their Revolts: till they not only brought this factious People to the lowest Pitch of In∣famy, but taught the Nations, that surrounded 'em, to think of, and to treat 'em, with <HI>Contempt:</HI> than which no State can possibly be curs'd with an unhappier, or more dangerous, Condition.</P>
<P>The Progress of all This was natural.—It help'd 'em little, that they still had Strength enough, to have repuls'd their Enemies. The <HI>Feet</HI> and <HI>Arms,</HI> like Those in the Old Fable, of <HI>Menenius Agrippa,</HI> thought it hard, that they should work to <HI>feed</HI> the <HI>Stomach:</HI> and destroy'd themselves in not sustaining, what they were <HI>sustain'd by.</HI>—While those proud <HI>Hebrews</HI> multiplied their Claims into lean <HI>Inde∣pendencies, Exemptions,</HI> and <HI>Immunities,</HI> they were pluck'd, One by One, away, like the Hairs of <HI>Sertorius</HI>'s <HI>Horse-Tail,</HI> which if pull'd at, <HI>All together,</HI> had been found irradicable.—It is in Bodies Politic the same, as in a Body Natural: In the Rapidity of some wild Race, a Man perceives a gaping <HI>Pit,</HI> before him; what a Happiness, in such a Case, to have the Seat of Counsel, and of Power, the same! He sees the Ruin in the Moment, that he shuns it in; for, Reason and Authority, concurring in the Head, put present Stop to the retracted Members; and they stand <HI>secur'd,</HI> upon the very Verge of their Precipitation. But, could we here suppose our Limbs stuck over with fine <HI>Mouths</HI> and <HI>Eyes,</HI> like <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Fame, and the imaginary <HI>Argus,</HI> and that every Mouth, and Eye, because it look'd a little like a <HI>Face,</HI> would set up for a <HI>Head</HI> too, and lay Claim to Privilege of Contra∣diction; what Consequence could we expect to see, from such a <HI>Popular Balance?</HI> Clamour, more than enough, there could not fail to be, to give <HI>Alarm</HI> to such a Body; but the Monster's <HI>Neck</HI> would run the Hazard to be <HI>broke,</HI> before each Member could be ask'd his Sentiment. There could not well be fansied a more lively Emblem, than, when Reasoners for Monarchy compare a Commonwealth to That imaginary Serpent, some old Writers dreamt of, with seven Heads, and but one Tail. The turbulent Reptile would, in spite of its big Hissing, only
<PB N="73" REF="81"/>
hang itself in every Hedge: whereas, with but one Head, It would draw all its seven Tails <HI>through,</HI> and find no Danger, or Incumbrance.</P>

<P>The leading Character, in Epic Poetry, must be distinguish'd, not alone from other Characters of the same Poem, but from other Poem's Heroes. He is to be mark'd by some <HI>Peculiar,</HI> of a noble Kind, by which He would be <HI>known</HI> in every Company; not only as a brave, wise, glorious Man:—but as That very in∣dividual brave, wise, glorious, Man.—We are not satisfied by a too general De∣scription, even of a fine Woman; but we listen with full-pointed Approbation, when, besides the Attributes, She holds in Common with the other Beauties, of her Sex, we are brought closer to her Image, by Communication of some one Pe∣culiar Grace, that teaches, and <HI>appropriates,</HI> HER separate Manner of <HI>engaging.</HI> Then, we form her, to our Fancy; and become acquainted with her Picture.— Thus, in <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Hero, the Characteristic is <HI>benevolent Piety.</HI> In <HI>Homer</HI>'s, It is <HI>Fierceness</HI>: and in <HI>Gideon, Patriotism.</HI></P>

<P>No Observation can be juster than is That, of the Political Writers, that <HI>Au∣thority is</HI> POWER; and <HI>Reputation</HI> is AUTHORITY. The Nature of Things, and Actions, can be examin'd but by few: their Appearance reaches <HI>Many. Machiavel</HI> had Reason for his Observation, that <HI>the only Difficulty in Ascent to Greatness will be found at its Beginning.</HI> Never Man (says he) attain'd considerable Height, from low Condition, without infinite Fatigue, and Danger from Opponents. Re∣pose a Milstone on the <HI>very Border</HI> of a Hill; It there lies fix'd for ever, if it wants the Impulse of some new <HI>first Motion.</HI> Let That <HI>Push</HI> be given, and not a <HI>Rock,</HI> in its Descent, will have the Strength to stop its Progress. All That <HI>Envy,</HI> which impels our Opposition, when we cross the Way of some new <HI>Riser,</HI> (from the natural Stimulation of a Vanity, that makes Comparison betwixt a Con∣sciousness of our <HI>own</HI> Worth and <HI>His</HI>) becomes extinguish'd, in Amazement, when we contemplate the <HI>Hazards,</HI> of some terrible Reputation. The Honours, of a Man so dangerously rais'd, we can no longer look upon with Malice: we surrender 'em, as but the <HI>Perquisites</HI> of the advent'rous Post, he won 'em in: and while Everybody <HI>admires, applauds, expects,</HI>—Resistance is discourag'd, and falls in with Furtherance; till, now, the Man, whom All <HI>believe</HI> most capable, <HI>grows capable,</HI> in Consequence of that Admission.</P>
<P>However equal, therefore, <HI>Gideon</HI> might, in Nature, have been form'd, for Prosecution of his Purpose, as to his unnoted and self-reap'd Advantages, from Meditation, Study, Virtue, Observation, Courage, or Experience, It had been to disregard the common Course of Things, had I made slight of those Restraints, which heap up Mountains upon Mountains to raise <HI>Bars</HI> against <HI>unaided Merit.</HI>

I durst not, under this Conviction, dream his Virtue <HI>rash</HI> enough to have pre∣sum'd a Glory, so unlikely, and remote from his suppos'd Pretensions (wanting Power, Authority, and Reputation) till the GOD, who had inspir'd him with adapted Qualities, impell'd 'em also into Action by <HI>Impression supernatural</HI>; or, to take the Story in its literal Sense, by the <HI>Apppearance of an Angel,</HI> to encourage him.</P>

<P><HI>Gideon</HI> distrusted the Reality of so improbable a Charge, tho' seemingly deriv'd from Heaven, because the Vastness of its Depth was more than he could <HI>sound,</HI> by the short Line of human Reason. The Celestial Missionary discern'd this natural Struggle betwixt <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Foresight,</HI> and removes it, by a <HI>Document,</HI> in∣cluded in, and made impressive by a MIRACLE.—<HI>Reach me</HI> (said the Angel) <HI>yon neglected little Store of your last Night's Provision. Gideon,</HI> in mere Respect to the Command, complies with it, in Doubt, and Wonder at its Meaning: and That Doubt and Wonder gave Occasion to the Angel to <HI>enforce</HI> the Credit of his Errand, and exact the like implicit Reverence to it, without bold Examina∣tions of its human Probability. I take the Liberty to look on This, as the true Meaning of the Passage in the <HI>Text:</HI> For, certainly, it could not be consistent with the Dignity of an Ambassador from God, to order Meat and Broth, to be pour'd out upon the Rock, with that too trivial Purpose, merely to <HI>blow it up,</HI> that he might vanish in the Fire, and leave <HI>Gideon</HI> in the Smoke.—Whereas ascending in the Flame after Delivery of so solemn and authoritative an Injunction, must have answer'd fully the majestic View, with which it seems to have been done: and left the Doubter animated into a becoming Faith and Resolution.</P>
<P>Sect. XX. L. 7.—Oreb, <HI>a</HI> Midian <HI>Prince of warlike Fame.</HI></P>
<P>Too limited a Knowlege in Things military, founded on a superficial Observa∣tion of the Pride, and formulary Petulancies, of <HI>disputed Rank</HI>; and querulous Exceptions to, or Emulations of <HI>Detach'd Commands, in modern War</HI>; will pro∣bably object, against This Place, that <HI>Oreb</HI> was a Person of <HI>too high a Quality,</HI> to lead a <HI>Party</HI> out to lie in Ambush for Surprize of a small City. But I recur to <HI>antient</HI> Practice, and protest against defective Testimony.—Actions of most Re∣nown, were These Surprisals, and light Ambushes: <HI>Ulysses,</HI> thus, and <HI>Diomede,</HI> go out disguis'd, by Night, as but <HI>Discoverers</HI> of the Enemy's Camp.—<HI>Achilles</HI> reproaches <HI>Agamemnon</HI> with his Backwardness upon Occasions of this Nature. And we must not bring down <HI>Gideon</HI>'s Days to <HI>ours,</HI> and buckle Reason to Per∣versity of Will, in faulty Adulation of Men's Pride and meaner Passions. But, to make a large Step from Antiquity, which every-where is crouded with Ex∣amples; <HI>Modern</HI> Times have had their Proofs, that noblest Spirits fly <HI>above</HI> these petty Loftinesses. <HI>Marshal Montluc,</HI> in his Commentaries, prides himself upon
<PB N="75" REF="83"/>
appearing personally, at the Head of all such Enterprizes; and ascribes his whole Good Fortune (which was certainly the longest lasting, and the happiest, nay, indeed, the most unmatch'd and wonderful, that ever was recorded) to his resolute persisting in <HI>This</HI> single Practice: the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> too, in his military Work, maintains (with some Degree of Anger, that it should be <HI>question'd</HI>) that no General, who is not prompt, by his <HI>own Presence,</HI> to promote the Execution of these little Services, can ever bring his Soldiers, either to That <HI>Vigilance,</HI> or That <HI>Opinion</HI> of his Valour, which are necessary to Authority. And, now of late, in our own Times, we saw good Proof of the Validity of That <HI>French</HI> General's Remark, in the Successes of the <HI>Earl of Peterborow,</HI> overrunning some of the best Provinces in <HI>Spain,</HI> against the Opposition of an Army, in Comparison with which <HI>His own</HI> might have been well mistaken for his <HI>travelling Retinue!</HI> This illustrious Kind of Victory, which Men obtain by inbred <HI>Energy of Genius,</HI> is what <HI>properly</HI> deserves the Name of <HI>Conquest.</HI> A Power of beating down one Force, by an opposing Equal one, can claim no other Title but of <HI>Overthrow.</HI></P>

<P>This Weapon was a very antient one, in Use among most Nations: tho' 'tis now scarce known, in <HI>Europe,</HI> except only in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Part of it.

It was one of These, that <HI>Joab</HI> thrust through <HI>Absalom.</HI> They were brought early out of <HI>Asia</HI> into Use among the <HI>Greeks</HI>; for we find few, in <HI>Homer,</HI> kill'd by any other Weapon. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> translated unreflectingly, in calling it a <HI>Spear.</HI> What graceful Image can we form, of <HI>Hector brandishing two Spears?</HI> By Spear, we are to understand, a <HI>Pike.</HI> Whereas the <HI>Javelin</HI> was but a short Staff, for casting at a Distance. The <HI>Romans</HI> call'd it <HI>Pilum,</HI> and became so fond of it, that they affected to be thought Inventors of its Use: so much is certain, that they met no Enemy, who us'd this Weapon; for what else can <HI>Lucan</HI> mean, when, in describing the <HI>Pharsalian War,</HI> he tells us that <HI>Piles threatened Piles?</HI> Had other Nations been <HI>so</HI> arm'd, This might have been the Case, in <HI>any</HI> of their Wars. But since the Use was proper to the <HI>Romans,</HI> to say <HI>Javelins</HI> against <HI>Javelins</HI> serv'd as strongly to express a <HI>Civil</HI> War, as if he had said <HI>Romans</HI> against <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>The People of <HI>Rome</HI> could not have borrow'd it from <HI>Greece,</HI> because we find in <HI>Livy,</HI> that They us'd it before any Intercourse had yet been open'd with That Nation. And beside, the <HI>Greeks</HI> themselves had, then, disus'd the Javelin: and been train'd to the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Practice, of long <HI>Pikes,</HI> of four and twenty Foot; in Bodies, which consisted of a Thousand in the Front, and Sixteen Men in File: sometimes, reduc'd to only <HI>Eight</HI> in Depth, the Ranks thereby extending to a double Length, when they would shun the Danger of being charg'd in <HI>Rear,</HI> by Enemies, who might <HI>out-wing</HI> them. In this Order, they compos'd a firm, im∣penetrable, and, on plain Ground, scarce resistible oblong Figure, call'd a <HI>Pha∣lanx:</HI> where the Soldiers, arm'd defensively with Helmets, Tassets, Corslets, Brass-Boots, and Targets, closing Ranks, and propping and sustaining one another, with their Pikes presented over the preceding Shoulders, like the <HI>Quills</HI> of <HI>Porcu∣pines,</HI> 'tis easy to imagine what Impression such a well-compacted Weight was capable of making; and how firmly It supported Charges from an Enemy; unless where Ditches, Hills, or other Inequalities of Ground, disturb'd, and broke their Order into little Gaps, or Intervals, at which (as in the Example of <HI>Aemilius,</HI> against <HI>Perses,</HI> at the Battle of <HI>Pydna</HI>) the <HI>Roman</HI> Legionary <HI>Maniples</HI> forc'd Entrance, and assaulting them in <HI>Flank,</HI> with their short Swords, gain'd frequent, and considerable Victories.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Pilum,</HI> 'tis most probable the <HI>Romans</HI> had it, with their <HI>Trojan</HI> Found∣ers, who no doubt brought into <HI>Italy,</HI> All Weapons they had been accustom'd to, before their Emigration. <HI>Vegetius</HI> and <HI>Polybius,</HI> Both, describe this <HI>Pilum,</HI> but a little <HI>differently.</HI> As far as can be gather'd out of <HI>Roman Tactics,</HI> It was a Staff, of weighty Wood, of four Foot long, exclusive of the <HI>Steel,</HI> one End of it was fasten'd into. This Steel Head was triangular, in Length two Foot, and very sharply edg'd, and pointed; so that the whole Length of the Javelin was about <HI>Six Foot:</HI> It was largest, where remotest from the Iron (though sometimes
<PB N="77" REF="85"/>
they are describ'd as double-headed): The poizing Place, for Grasp, was com∣monly about an Inch and a Quarter in Diameter.</P>
<P>The Legionary Foot, All, carried this peculiar missile Weapon: and could hurl it with surprising Aim, and Force, against an Enemy. The Manner of their casting it was thus—When the first Rank observ'd the Distance within Reach, they threw their Javelins, point-blank, and sunk immediately upon one Knee, to give the second Rank uninterrupted Sight, who, then, threw also, and knelt down, to give the same Advantage to the <HI>Third.</HI> And thus, when <HI>Ten</HI> whole Ranks had thrown successively (which was dispatch'd with an unceasing Swiftness, and Agility), They started up together, with a general Shout, drew All their Swords at once, and so rush'd in upon the Enemy.</P>
<P>What terrible Effects have been produc'd by Javelins, we have innumerable Instances in History: but none more worthy Notice, than That Great one, at <HI>Pharsalia</HI>; where <HI>Caesar,</HI> with his usual Skill, foreseeing, that <HI>Pompey's Horse,</HI> compos'd of the most warm, and fiery Spirits of the <HI>Roman</HI> Youth of the Patrician Houses, would be endeavouring to fall in upon his Rear, on That Wing, where his own few Horsemen were exceedingly out-reach'd, by <HI>Pompey</HI>'s, He plac'd, in oblique Line, extending from behind the so-expos'd and threatened Flank of Cavalry, six chosen Cohorts of his veteran <HI>Foot</HI> (which made about Three thousand Men) and order'd These, when they receiv'd the Squadrons in their coming round upon 'em, to aim All their Javelins <HI>at the Faces only</HI> of Those gay young Chargers. It succeeded, to his Wish. The Horse came furiously <HI>about:</HI> but starting unexpectedly on this Reserve of such experienc'd Wounders, were receiv'd with so successive Showers of <HI>Javelins,</HI> in their Eyes, Cheeks, Necks, and Foreheads, that unable to support the Horror of such maim'd, and miserable Faces (for the Horse had no <HI>Vant-braces</HI> to their Helmets), they All turn'd their Backs precipitately, and disordering their own <HI>Foot,</HI> lost <HI>Pompey</HI> that important Day; and gave the World to <HI>Caesar.</HI></P>
<P>Sect. 25. L. 5.—<HI>Then</HI> Gideon <HI>found it prudent to retreat.</HI></P>
<P>There is no Chance, and most especially in War, which so effectually, and suddenly, destroys the Interests of Men, as Want of due Discernment where to <HI>stop,</HI> in the smooth Race of Fortune. They see nothing but plain bowling Way, before 'em: and, if they ever look <HI>behind,</HI> it is not till their Rear is <HI>broken in upon.</HI> There is an Eye on <HI>every Side</HI> of Prudence, and she <HI>sees</HI> all round her. <HI>Gideon,</HI> who had so lately gain'd the Out-set of his Influence, by the Valour he had shewn in the Dispute with <HI>Oreb,</HI> was to make Advantage, of the favourable Opportunity. As he was Leader, in this hot Pursuit, and saw, that he was follow'd by his Countrymen without Regard to Consequence, He might have push'd the Enemy beyond the Hill, and made considerable Slaughter, as they pass'd the River. But how, <HI>there,</HI> should so disorderly a Body have resisted, on <HI>plain</HI> Ground, the Re-inforcements coming up, to the Assistance of the flying
<PB N="78" REF="86"/>
Enemy? In calm Debate, within Himself, he found the Hope of added Glory, from the Conquest, overbalanc'd, by a Certainty of <HI>losing That already His,</HI> in case of Disappointment, and Defeat in Hazard for it. He determines, therefore, to retreat, and guard the Safety of the People with him: on whose Favour he was now to build, for All the Promise of his future Fortune.</P>
<P>Sect. XXVII. L. 4.—<HI>Th' assembled Elders, o'er the City Gate.</HI></P>
<P>The frequent Devastations brought upon the <HI>Jews,</HI> first, by the Princes of the East, then, by the <HI>Roman Emperors,</HI> and, in All Ages since, by the Resentment and Revenge of <HI>Christian</HI> Zeal, for ever warm against them, have so irrecoverably destroy'd their <HI>Records,</HI> that, excepting their Remains of Law and History, pre∣serv'd in the Old Testament, there can be nothing more obscure, than the For∣malities in Civil Government, observ'd by this unhappy People. Their <HI>Priests,</HI> who were the sole Repositories of their Learning, Faith, and Ceremonies, have been cut off, almost to a Man, in general and commission'd Massacres: and Op∣portunities, which This produc'd, gave Room for Forgeries, and infinite Imper∣tinence, and superstitious Dreamings, to their <HI>Rabbins,</HI> and their <HI>Talmudists.</HI> Nor have the <HI>Christian</HI> Writers, to say Truth, clear'd more from the Confusion, than appears to have been added to it. <HI>Josephus</HI> liv'd at the same Time with <HI>Christ's Apostles,</HI> and is one of our best Guides, in Searches of this Nature; but, besides that he is often not so <HI>full,</HI> as might be wish'd, his Countrymen had undergone so many <HI>Changes</HI> before then, that <HI>Ten</HI> Tribes of the <HI>Twelve</HI> were utterly extir∣pated: and the Government, and Customs of the other <HI>Two,</HI> so different, in many of their most considerable Circumstances, from the Institutions left by <HI>Moses,</HI> that for Matters of remote Antiquity we cannot safely rest on <HI>his</HI> Authority. Thus much, however, may be gather'd, from his Testimony, and the <HI>Hebrew Model,</HI> as remaining in the Bible, that Each City had a <HI>Senate,</HI> of her <HI>Elders</HI>; that These were generally <HI>Seven,</HI> with a <HI>Levite</HI> on each Hand, for Exposition of their Law, and to record, as well as regulate, Proceedings. They sat exactly in the Form describ'd: The <HI>Place</HI> above the City <HI>Gate</HI>; to signify, that Justice was to <HI>guard,</HI> and <HI>circumscribe,</HI> their Habitations. These Senates of their Cities judg'd All Points of Right within their Districts: but were under Check of an <HI>Appeal</HI> to <HI>Capitals of Tribes:</HI> the Cause might, there, be heard again, before the <HI>Prince</HI> of That particular Tribe; who had Election also of his <HI>City Senates:</HI> Lastly, from these provincial Princes, lay Appeal, in final Termination, to the <HI>Sanhedrim:</HI> But, till the general Defection alter'd the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Order, Appeal lay from the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> to the <HI>High-Priest</HI>; and His Decision was the last; and under Penalty of <HI>Death,</HI> to be submitted to.—All which shall be progressively, made evident, in Notes upon the Books to follow.</P>
<P>Sect. XXX. L. 10.—<HI>Were, sure, design'd by Heav'n, for wide Controul.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="87"/>The Accident, that had so lately given Occasion of Applause on <HI>Gideon</HI>'s Bravery, returning with a <HI>Royal</HI> Prisoner; and which had open'd to his Country∣men an unexpected Promise from his Virtues; is the <HI>Point of Sight</HI> in his par∣ticular Case, some <HI>one,</HI> of which, Men often are plac'd in by <HI>Fortune:</HI> but whence, if they have fit Discernment to make use of the Advantage, they find All their future Way more easy. They <HI>dazle,</HI> by their sudden Splendor; and prevent Inspection, by Excess of Lustre. Like Men, who hold Dark-lanterns up before 'em, they present a strong, but undistinguishable, <HI>Glare,</HI> behind which They Themselves discern Things clearly, through the Light, which makes Those <HI>blind,</HI> who <HI>look against</HI> them.</P>
<P>Such a Light enlarg'd the Influence of <HI>Gideon</HI>'s Virtues. It is not from the Merit of the Truths, he has been recommending, that the Senators derive their Warmth of Admiration. A Man, to whom such Sentiments were natural, would doubtless have express'd 'em many Times before, when, yet, they had produc'd no such Effect in Favour of the Speaker. But the Case is, now, grown different. It is not to <HI>Gideon,</HI> the Son of <HI>Joash,</HI> their Fellow Citizen, and old Acquaintance, they have all this while been list'ning. It is to <HI>Gideon</HI> made illustrious, by Applause and Wonder of the People. What had been common in the MAN, was grown prodigious in the <HI>Conqueror</HI>; and Words, which were, before, thought only worth Neglect, are found, by this new Light, to merit more than Admiration.</P>
<P>Every Thing we have heard of, Every Thing we admire, will be found, upon Reflection, to have been the Gift of <HI>Opportunity.</HI> Had not <HI>Lucretia's Death</HI> succeeded to her <HI>Rape</HI>; or some equivalent Excitement rous'd the till-then latent Indignation of the <HI>Roman</HI> People into Transport; <HI>Brutus</HI> would still have been constrain'd to have <HI>kept on</HI> his Cloak of unexampled Dissimulation; and the History of His Times had wanted one ferocious Instance, that Disguise of Passions can consist with the most stern Inflexibility.</P>
<P>In the same City, the same Senate, and same People, who, while under Hope, or Fear from <HI>Pompey</HI>'s Fortune, gave Consent to all Indignities his Jealousy could heap on <HI>Caesar,</HI> and who, with a malignant Laziness, suppos'd him, in his Absence, of no longer Consequence, chang'd Disposition in a Moment, and had, now, no Ear for any Thing but <HI>Caesar.—Caesar</HI>'s Valour! <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Goodness! <HI>Caesar</HI>'s For∣tune!—For they saw All This by the <HI>new Light,</HI> his unexpected March to <HI>Rome</HI> had lent 'em. The terrible Success of so astonishing a Boldness taught 'em to consider, as <HI>invincible,</HI> a Courage, that could meet such Danger with a steady Eye. And That first daring Step drew Half the Nation from his Rival's Interest.</P>
<P>Sect. XXXI. L. 11.—<HI>So, wand'ring wide, he reach'd the Grove of</HI> Baal.</P>
<P><HI>Baal</HI> was the <HI>Sun,</HI> and <HI>Ashtaroth</HI> the <HI>Moon</HI>; at least, they were most generally so reputed. But concerning these great Eastern Idols, and the different Accounts, in Writers, of their Forms, and Modes of Worship, much more might be noted,
<PB N="80" REF="88"/>
than could be of Use, or Pleasure, here.—It will be All the Subject calls for, to observe, that they were generally plac'd on <HI>Hills,</HI> with gloomy Groves surround∣ing them. For they were worship'd in the open Air, because it was suppos'd pre∣sumptuous to confine their <HI>Gods</HI> to Temples, who were Omnipresent, and illimi∣table.—Therefore, when the <HI>Hebrews</HI> (as they often did) fell off to the Idolatry of their next-bord'ring Nations, <HI>They made them Images,</HI> says Scripture, <HI>and planted Groves about 'em; and set up an Idol upon every high Hill, and under every green Tree; after the Abominations of the Kingdoms, which were round about them.</HI></P>
<P>The Description of the Grove of <HI>Baal,</HI> and of the <HI>Image,</HI> was to be as full, and circumstantial, as it could be made; first, as it was a matter of Importance in the Story, there having really been, at <HI>Ophra,</HI> such a Grove, and Idol; most of the Inhabitants, and even <HI>Gideon's Father,</HI> seeming to have been its Worship∣ers: and secondly, as there arose poetical Occasion, for an Ornament, from the Position, Figure, Grove, and solemn Picture of the <HI>Hill</HI>; which commonly was artificial, many still remaining, in some Parts of <HI>Palestine.</HI></P>
<P>Sect. XXXII. L. 17.—<HI>Where can we better Virtue's Race begin?</HI></P>
<P>It is with a <HI>prophetic</HI> Spirit, <HI>Gideon</HI>'s Zeal transports him in this Place; the sacred Text discovering, that the Consequences, of his cutting down the Grove of <HI>Baal,</HI> became the Means of raising him to a Capacity of gathering into one col∣lective Body That first military Strength, to which he ow'd his own succeeding Triumphs, and his Country's double Rescue, from the <HI>Arms,</HI> and <HI>Idols,</HI> of their Enemy.</P>
<P>Sect. XXXIII. L. 15.—<HI>Enough for Them, that 'tis by</HI> GIDEON <HI>meant.</HI></P>
<P>From the Aid he here receives from the <HI>Ten Slaves,</HI> whom he had taken in the Cave, and saved their Lives, when sentenc'd by the Senate, there arises season∣able Opportunity to speak a Word or two, concerning <HI>Episodes,</HI> in general. They never must deserve the Name, which <HI>Horace</HI> gives the independent Parts of some of his Cotemporary's Pieces; they are, instead of the DISJECTI <HI>membra Poetae,</HI> to be found <HI>attach'd,</HI> as well as beautiful. To heap together a wild Store of In∣cidents unlook'd for, and surprising, will require but the Assistance of a lively <HI>Fancy.</HI> To chuse <HI>which</HI> is fit, which not, This is a Business for the <HI>Judgment.</HI> There was, some time since, a <HI>Sheep,</HI> with a fine <HI>Top-knot</HI> on its Head: There was a little after, an <HI>Hungarian Girl,</HI> who had a Sister <HI>growing</HI> to her <HI>Back.</HI> Both These were Objects <HI>unexpected,</HI> and <HI>surprising</HI>; but they were, however, <HI>Monsters,</HI> and offensively <HI>unnatural.</HI> They were like the Poems of <HI>Ariosto,</HI> (and I wish I could not add, some Passages in our Great <HI>Spencer</HI>'s) into which a fairy Dance of incoherent light Adventures, of the most <HI>Romantic</HI> Model possible—if we except the <HI>Tales</HI> in the <HI>Arabian Night's</HI> unmatchable Extravagancies—crouded on, and wedg'd themselves without Connection, Cause, or Consequence; All, loose, and
<PB N="81" REF="89"/>
separate, in their Natures, and yet ramm'd together by the Impulse of the Poet's Spirit. In reading such a Poem, I imagine it like looking down upon a <HI>Sea,</HI> where long Successions of huge Surges after Surges, foaming from all Quarters, without Point of View to rest upon, move <HI>Horror,</HI> tho', at the same time, they strike with a wild Kind of Wonder, something <HI>like</HI> Delight. The Whole amuses the Attention: nothing leads it, in particular. A regular <HI>Epic</HI> Poet draws along the Mind, as <HI>Rivers</HI> do the Sight: however strong the Current, and the Course tho' vast and winding, yet the Flow itself is orderly, the Force confin'd within its Banks, and if it takes in <HI>Episodical</HI> Brooks, it is, to <HI>deepen,</HI> not <HI>divide,</HI> its Chanel.</P>
<P>Should therefore this Deliverance of the <HI>Slaves</HI> have purpos'd nothing further, than to set off <HI>Gideon,</HI> and display his Generosity, the Contrivance had been flat, and wanted the Characteristic of an <HI>Epic Episode.</HI> For, while it could not be dis∣cern'd, that It had any Influence toward Advance of the main Action, the Reader would have thought their History too inconsiderable to atone for the Digression, they misled him into. But the Interest of these honest Men becomes intitled to our whole Attention and Concern, as soon as we observe, that, from their Grati∣tude, an Action is deriv'd, that gives Foundation to the great one, purpos'd by the Poem: and reflect, that no Men, less oblig'd, could have been drawn to a Participation, in so menacing a Danger.</P>
<P>It is probable, in actual Truth, that These ten Servants, who, the Text says, aided <HI>Gideon,</HI> in the Night (for Fear of the Inhabitants of <HI>Ophra,</HI> and the Rest of their own Family), were Persons, whom He had engag'd to his particular Interest, by Effect of some uncommon Obligation; It being impossible they should not have <HI>foreseen</HI> the Uproar and Resentment, which attended their Presumption: and no Ordinary Temptation had prevail'd on Men of Their expos'd Condition, to pro∣voke so visible a Hazard.</P>
<P>It is the same again, in That <HI>next Episode</HI>; where the Defeat of <HI>Oreb</HI>'s <HI>Party,</HI> and His being made a <HI>Prisoner,</HI> was not introduc'd to give a Proof of <HI>Gideon's Bra∣very,</HI> but, from Effect of its Exertion, to possess him of the Public Admiration. I repeat the Observation, tho' already noted, to imprint Remembrance of this not to be dispens'd with Requisite, in <HI>Episodes,</HI> that they <HI>produce,</HI> and make Each other <HI>necessary</HI>; and contribute, All, to the <HI>Completion</HI> of the <HI>Epic Action.</HI></P>

<PB N="82" REF="90"/>
<HI>Priesthood:</HI> and He knew sufficiently, by the Direction he proceeded under, that His <HI>Offering</HI> could need no Punctuality, to render it acceptable.</P>
<P>But over and above All This, there cannot be denied to rise offensive Images, from a too long Detail of Cutting up of Beasts, washing their Bowels, broiling the Fat, and such <HI>carnific</HI> Circumstances. I consent with all my Heart, to <HI>Lord Ros∣common</HI>'s Notion of this Matter.</P>

<P>I hope I need not apprehend this Line in Danger to be look'd upon, as guilty of more <HI>Roughness,</HI> than It very well can justify, from what was touch'd in a preceding Note, concerning the Assimilation of the <HI>Sound</HI> to the describ'd <HI>Idea.</HI> But, as the hard <HI>Rebound</HI> is owing here, to the selected <HI>Monosyllables,</HI> I ought to add, in their Defence, that, us'd with any Choice, or Care, they are a Beauty, and Advantage; and both <HI>tune</HI> our Language and <HI>enrich</HI> it. I will wish no plainer Proof, <HI>in Favour of,</HI> than Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has brought, <HI>against</HI> them.</P>
<Q><L>And ten low Words oft creep in one dull Line.</L></Q>
<P>By the Way, creep THROUGH, had better answer'd his Intention, than <HI>creep</HI> IN. But, if it had not been for our abundant Choice of Monosyllable Words, how then could Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> have <HI>imitated,</HI> with so beautiful a Force, the very Fault he was exposing? The Truth is, It is not a long String of such short Words, that makes Verse <HI>jar</HI> upon the Ear.—Short Syllables, when they are <HI>Words,</HI> may, by judicious Intermixture of the <HI>Vowels,</HI> with the Consonants, succeed Each other with as smooth a Cadence, as can Syllables, which are but <HI>Parts</HI> of Words.—The studied Roughness, in this Verse of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s, arises only from a refluent Relu∣ctance of its Accents to concur, in That <HI>Insertion</HI> into one Another, which is ne∣cessary, to make Words harmonious. I could shew a thousand Monosyllable Lines, in Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s, and great Numbers, too, in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>own Poems,</HI> than which nothing can be capable of a more exquisite <HI>Smoothness.</HI>—It is easy to derive the same Proof, even from Blank Verse, and <HI>Milton,</HI> where it seems least reason∣able to suppose too nice a Care of <HI>Softness,</HI> from <HI>Selection</HI> of his <HI>Syllables.</HI>—In <HI>Eve</HI>'s Reproach of <HI>Adam,</HI> for Example, Paradise lost, the Ninth Book.</P>
<Q><L>Why should be mean me ill, or seek to harm?</L></Q>
<P>She speaks it of the <HI>Devil</HI>; and the Author, therefore, will be scarce conceiv'd to have <HI>endeavour'd</HI> this <HI>sweet</HI> Flow of Monosyllables. Verse compos'd so, never
<PB N="83" REF="91"/>
carries Roughness, where due Care is taken, that the Syllables are <HI>heavily,</HI> or <HI>lightly</HI> ACCENTED, in just Proportion to the Sense, they move with. But, in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s, the Words are purposely so <HI>chosen,</HI> that Each Syllable requires <HI>Emphatical Expansion:</HI> and, in That Case, there can be no <HI>Music,</HI> for the very Reason, that makes Difference betwixt the <HI>Tolling out one Bell,</HI> and ringing a whole <HI>Belfry.</HI></P>
<P>I have omitted a short Note, which ought to have been plac'd in the Beginning, The Reader will observe, I commonly make Choice of the Appellative, <HI>He∣brews.</HI>—The Word <HI>Israelite</HI> is no more fit for Poetry, than <HI>Children of Israel:</HI> To have call'd 'em <HI>Jews</HI> had been a visible Absurdity; since That was a <HI>posterior</HI> Name, on their Reduction to Two Tribes, and the exclusive Kingdom of <HI>Judah</HI> only. The other Ten Tribes, till their final Extirpation, own'd no Name but their Original one, of <HI>Israel.</HI> Their general Appellative, among the bordering Aliens, seems to have been <HI>Hebrews</HI>; which effectually includes 'em All; and was deriv'd to 'em from <HI>Heber,</HI> Sixth, in Ascent, from <HI>Abraham</HI>; and Second, from <HI>Arphaxad, Noah</HI>'s Grandson.</P>

<L>She may, perhaps, from <HI>Tyre</HI>'s touch'd Wall, <HI>recede:</HI></L>
<L>To blast our Purpose, with returning Swarms.</L>
<L>Now, rip'ning Harvest smiles on ev'ry Plain;</L>
<L>To heap our Magazines, with needful <HI>Grain.</HI></L>
<L>Foes have, 'tis true, our ablest <HI>Horse</HI> destroy'd:</L>
<L>But War's chief Strength is <HI>Foot,</HI> not ill employ'd.</L>
<L><HI>Next,</HI>—would my <HI>Father</HI>'s Will indulge my Pray'r,</L>
<L><HI>He,</HI> to this Hope, would lend his missive Care:</L>
<L><HI>He,</HI> first, to OREB, <HI>Midian</HI>'s noblest King,</L>
<L>Should bear, precautious, this credential <HI>Ring.</HI></L>
<L>Say, when His hospitable Eye, your welcome Presence meets,</L>
<L><HI>Gideon,</HI> oblig'd, the Royal Giver, greets:</L>
<L>Greets him, with Claim of promis'd Friendship due,</L>
<L>Say, <HI>Ophra</HI>'s <HI>Gen'ral</HI>—and add, <HI>Israel</HI>'s, too:</L>
<L>Does, with <HI>new Levies,</HI> HIS known Wish pursue.</L>
<L><PB N="147" REF="156"/>Tell him, to war on <HI>Tyre,</HI> as <HI>Midian</HI>'s <HI>Friend,</HI></L>
<L>We, for joint Use, fraternal Strength, extend.</L>
<L>Add, that Twelve <HI>Legates,</HI> hence, commission'd, go:</L>
<L>To sign <HI>form'd Contract,</HI> 'gainst our <HI>Common Foe.</HI></L>

<L>He ceas'd: and joyful Wonder, and Applause,</L>
<L>Concurr'd, in Rapture of avow'd Consent:</L>
<L>Faith, from His Measures, bright'ning Prospect, draws;</L>
<L>And, to pale Doubt, enliv'ning Comfort, lent.</L>
<L>The Senate rose; on sep'rate Charges, bent:</L>
<L>The People, as they pass, transported shout.</L>
<L>And <HI>Ophra</HI>'s echoing Domes resound: and Triumph reigns, throughout.</L>
