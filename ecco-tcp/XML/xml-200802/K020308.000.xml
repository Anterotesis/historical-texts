<P>IL ne faut pourtant pas croire que les Grecs manquent de Feu. Tout s'anime au con∣traire, tout parle, tout agit dans leurs Ecrits. Mais c'est plus l'Action &amp; le Spectacle que les Paroles, &amp; plus la Passion &amp; le Sentiment que le Discours; au lieu que les François ont souvent donné dans le Discours &amp; les Paroles pour sup∣pleer au Spectacle ou à la Passion. Combien de Portraits, de Sentences, &amp; de Lieux communs bien frappés, ont arraché des Applaudissemens qui devoient être réservés à l'emotion Theatrale qu'on ne sentoit pas? ce n'est que le sang froid qui applaudit à la Beauté des Vers dans un Spec∣tacle.</P>

<HEAD>TO HIS GRACE The Duke of DEVONSHIRE, Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was the frequent Practice of the ancient <HI>Greek</HI> Tragedians, to make their Compositions for the <HI>Theatre</HI> subservient to the Welfare of the <HI>State.</HI> The Legislator's Wis∣dom was inforced by the Poet's Art. Public Guilt was stigmatized, and public Virtue applauded. Of this Kind somewhat is, or ought to be, shadowed out in the following Tra∣gedy.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="4"/>But it may possibly be asked, 
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why this Address from a Writer who is, and determines to remain, unknown?"</Q></P>
<P>My LORD, it comes from one, who, altho' he hath not wanted Op∣portunities, hath ever scorned to pro∣stitute Addresses of this Kind to Views of Interest. But if it hath for once happened in his Time, that Virtue and Power are eminently united; his honest Disdain of offering Incense to the <HI>one,</HI> shall not intimi∣date him from avowing his Reve∣rence of the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>More especially, the natural Re∣lation which the Design of this Tra∣gedy bears to your Grace's Conduct, gives its Author a kind of equitable Title, without Leave, to prefix your Name. Thus, while he delineates <HI>Rebellion,</HI> he contrasts it with true <HI>Loyalty:</HI> And to an <HI>Example</HI> of <HI>Se∣dition</HI>
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
drawn from ancient Days, <HI>op∣poses</HI> a <HI>Character</HI> from modern Life, who in the highest Station, and most perilous Times, hath been the <HI>Re∣storer</HI> of <HI>Unity</HI> and <HI>Concord.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, My LORD, with the highest Esteem, your GRACE's most obedient Servant, The AUTHOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<BYLINE>Written by the AUTHOR of the TRAGEDY.</BYLINE>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. HOLLAND in the Character, of the <HI>Genius</HI> of <HI>Britain.</HI></STAGE>
<LG>
<L>TO warn the Sons of Freedom to be wise,</L>
<L>Lo, <HI>Britain's</HI> guardian Genius quits the Skies,</L>
<L>With Pity, Heav'n hath seen thro' many an Age,</L>
<L>The bold Invader lur'd by Faction's Rage;</L>
<L>Seen the dark Workings of Rebellion's Train,</L>
<L>While Patriots plann'd, and Heroes bled in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold, your Country's faithless Foe, once more</L>
<L>With threatning Squadrons crowd yon hostile Shore.</L>
<L>Behold Oppression's bloody Flag unfurl'd:</L>
<L>See Bolts prepar'd, to chain the Western World.</L>
<L>Rise, <HI>Britons,</HI> rise! to Heav'n and Virtue true:</L>
<L>Expiring Liberty looks up to <HI>You!</HI></L>
<L>Pour on the common Foe your Rage combin'd,</L>
<L>And be the Friends of Freedom and Mankind!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more let Discord <HI>Britain</HI>'s Peace destroy;</L>
<L>Nor spurn those Blessings, Reason bids enjoy:</L>
<L>Oh, weigh those Blessings in her equal Scale!—</L>
<L>Say;—When did Justice wear a whiter Veil?</L>
<L>When did Religion gentler Looks disclose,</L>
<L>To bless her Friends, and pity ev'n her Foes?</L>
<L>A richer Harvest when did Commerce reap?</L>
<L>When rode your Flects more dreadful o'er the Deep?</L>
<L><PB REF="7"/>
Or when more bright (hear, <HI>Envy!</HI> hear, and own!)</L>
<L>Did Truth, did Honour beam from <HI>Britain</HI>'s Throne?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Seize then the Happiness deny'd your Foes:</L>
<L>Nor blindly scorn the Gifts which Heav'n bestows:</L>
<L>Gifts, the World's Envy! happy <HI>Britain</HI>'s Pride!</L>
<L>For which, your generous Fathers toil'd and dy'd!</L>
<L>Let Union lift the Sword, direct the Blow,</L>
<L>And hurl a Nation's Vengeance on its Foe!</L>
<L>As your bold Cliffs, when Tides and Tempests roar,</L>
<L>Fling back the mad'ning Billows from the Shore.</L>
<L>One Head, one Heart, one Arm, one People, rise!</L>
<L>Nor fall, divided Valour's Sacrifice!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if, by Hope of proud Invasion led,</L>
<L>Unaw'd Rebellion lift her gory Head;—</L>
<L>Treason, attend!—here view the Rebel's Fate;</L>
<L>Nor hope, thy Arm can shake a free-born State:</L>
<L>See Blood and Horror end what Guilt began;</L>
<L>And tremble at <HI>thy</HI> Woes, in <HI>Athelstan.</HI></L>

<L>Beauty, with ev'ry winning Quality,</L>

<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. CIBBER.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>To speak Ten Words, again I've fetch'd my Breath;</L>
<L>The Tongue of Woman struggles hard with Death.</L>
<L>Ten Words! will that suffice? Ten Words—no more.</L>
<L>We always give a Thousand to the Score.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What can provoke these Wits their Time to waste,</L>
<L>To please that fickle, fleeting Thing call'd Taste?</L>
<L>It mocks all Search, for Substance has it none;</L>
<L>Like <HI>Hamlet's</HI> Ghost—'Tis here—'Tis there—'Tis gone.</L>
<L>How very few about the Stage agree!</L>
<L>As Men with diff'rent Eyes a Beauty see,</L>
<L>So judge they of that stately Dame—Queen-Tragedy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Greek-read Critic, as his Mistress holds her,</L>
<L>And having little Love, for Trifles scolds her:</L>
<L>Excuses want of Spirit, Beauty, Grace,</L>
<L>But ne'er forgives her failing—Time, and Place.</L>
<L>How do our Sex of Taste in Judgment vary?</L>
<L>Miss <HI>Bell</HI> adores, what's loath'd by Lady <HI>Mary:</HI></L>
<L>The first in Tenderness a very Dove,</L>
<L>Melts like the feather'd Snow, at <HI>Juliet's</HI> Love:</L>
<L>Then, sighing, turns to <HI>Romeo</HI> by her Side,</L>
<L>"Can you believe that Men for Love have dy'd?"</L>
<L>Her Ladyship, who vaults the Coarser's Back,</L>
<L>Leaps the barr'd Gate, and calls you <HI>Tom</HI> and <HI>Jack;</HI></L>
<L>Detests these Whinings, like a true Virago;</L>
<L>She's all for Daggers! Blood! Blood! Blood! <HI>Iago!</HI></L>
<L><PB REF="89"/>
A <HI>third,</HI> whose Heart defies all Perturbations,</L>
<L>Yet dies for Triumphs, Funerals, Coronations!</L>
<L>Ne'er asks which Tragedies succeed, ôr fail,</L>
<L>But whose <HI>Procession</HI> has the longest Tail.</L>
<L>The <HI>Youths,</HI> to whom <HI>France</HI> gives a new Belief,</L>
<L>Who look with <HI>Horror</HI> on a Rump of Beef:</L>
<L>On <HI>Shakespear's</HI> Plays, with shrugg'd up Shoulders stare,</L>
<L>These Plays? They're bloody Murders,<HI>—O Barbare!</HI></L>
<L>And yet the Man has Merit<HI>—Entre Nous,</HI></L>
<L>He'd been damn'd clever, had he read <HI>Bossù.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Shakespear</HI> read <HI>French!</HI> roars out a surly Cit:</L>
<L>When <HI>Shakespear</HI> wrote, our Valour match'd our Wit:</L>
<L>Had <HI>Britons</HI> then been Fops, Queen <HI>Bess</HI> had hang'd 'em;</L>
<L>Those Days, they never <HI>read</HI> the <HI>French,—</HI>They <HI>band'd</HI> 'em.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If Taste evaporates by too high Breeding,</L>
<L>And eke is overlaid, by too deep Reading;</L>
<L>Lest then in search of this, you lose your Feeling,</L>
<L>And barter native Sense in foreign Dealing;</L>
<L>Be this neglected Truth to <HI>Britons</HI> known,</L>
<L>No Tastes, no Modes become you, but your own.</L>
