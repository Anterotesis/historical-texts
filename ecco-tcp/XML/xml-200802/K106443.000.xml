<P>POEMS TO THESPIA.</P>
<L>Oh, true Name of Love,</L>
<L>Tender Affection! Genuine Source of bliss,</L>
<L>Immaculate and pure! The transient blaze</L>
<L>Of passion soon subsides; thy steadier fire</L>
<L>Time but increases. Soft, coercive Band</L>
<L>Connecting Souls! without thee what is Life!</L>
<L>Sweet Halcyon of the breast, whose summer wing</L>
<L>Lulls each tempestuous care! To thee the Wise,</L>
<L>The Good still sacrifice, the Soul refined</L>
<L>From vulgar dross: Nor any but the Dull</L>
<L>Whom Nature niggard of her bounty, cast</L>
<L>In narrow mould, or whom with iron hand</L>
<L>Tyrannic Custom rules, despise thy sway.</L>

<L>SCorning with studied art to drag along</L>
<L>The doubled epithet of monstrous length,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>No labour'd, no fictitious strains I bring,</L>
<L>But unreserved pour forth my honest heart;</L>
<L>Nature and true Affection bade me sing,</L>
<L>I felt the wound of no pretended dart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! may my pen fall from my palsied hand,</L>
<L>When I survive to real taste a Pest!</L>
<L>Or place in nice array with Orders' wand</L>
<L>The hasty ebullitions of my breast!</L>

<L>My theme is chosen 'mid the British Fair,</L>
<L>No antique Bards for love-thoughts I explore,</L>

No fabled Gods from Greece and Rome I bear,</L>
<L>No Nymphs, or Dryads from the Classic shore.</L>

<L>Such ornaments may please the shallow mind,</L>

<L>But Elegance delights in chaplet twined</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor here hath Love disdain'd his gifts to shed,</L>
<L>The feeling Soul is not unfrequent here;</L>
<L>And genuine Rapture by the Graces led,</L>
<L>Oft tunes the lyre, and thrills the listening ear.</L>

<L>HOW sweet, in Spring, the twilight Dawn!</L>
<L>The woods imbrown'd, and humid lawn;</L>
<L>The crimson streaks which deck the sky,</L>
<L>The wide-stretch'd plain, and mountain high!</L>
<L>But when the Sun unveils his face,</L>
<L>The Landscape glows with heighten'd grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Should raging Tempests Heaven deform,</L>
<L>If, final Victor, of the Storm,</L>
<L>The same illustrious Lord of day</L>
<L>Full blazes with triumphant ray,</L>
<L>All Nature owns his influence bright,</L>
<L>And bends before the glorious light.</L>

<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
<L>Nursed by his warmth, the latent grain</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>See Youth, exulting in his May!</L>
<L>What new-born joys before Him play!</L>
<L>His sprightly feet expatiate round,</L>
<L>And all He sees is Fairy ground.</L>
<L>When Love unfolds his pinions nigh,</L>
<L>And wafts his Soul to extasy.</L>

<L>Say, that Adversity should bring</L>
<L>Her livid plagues, her Scorpion sting?</L>
<L>And the collected venom dart</L>
<L>Remorseless, on the Human heart?</L>
<L>Love soothes to rest it's fiercest pain,</L>
<L>And gives it vital strength again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each softer energy refined</L>
<L>He kindles in the darken'd Mind;</L>
<L>And from their hidden seat calls forth</L>
<L>The zealous deeds of generous Worth.</L>

<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<L>Thou pure Enlightener of the breast,</L>
<L>Oh! shine thro' all my life confest!</L>

<LG>
<L>THE truest Love is most reserved and shy,</L>
<L>No look of confidence, or boldness wears,</L>
<L>Known by the humble brow, and soften'd eye,</L>
<L>And full of wavering doubts, and anxious fears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When I perceived that THESPIA had o'ercome</L>
<L>My yielding heart, and fix'd her empire there,</L>
<L>That from her voice I must receive my doom,</L>
<L>And all my future weal must flow from her:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How did my bosom fluctuate with the pain</L>
<L>Of native bashfulness, and strong desire!</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="8"/>
What varying conflicts did I not sustain!</L>
<L>How struggled soft respect, with passion's fire!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft did I wish the secret to have told,</L>
<L>But awe witheld, and modest dread prevail'd,</L>
<L>Her presence all my faculties controul'd,</L>
<L>And every settled resolution fail'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length, with firm intent I sought the Fair,</L>
<L>With firm intent to pour out all my heart,</L>
<L>At once display the story of my care,</L>
<L>And the long misery of consuming smart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To a sequester'd grove her steps I drew,</L>
<L>She without guile went innocently free;</L>
<L>No ill suspecting, for no ill she knew,</L>
<L>Nor fear'd to trust herself alone with me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At first my usual converse I assay'd,</L>
<L>Hoping from thence to gain a tranquil air;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="9"/>
And as along the winding paths We stray'd,</L>
<L>With frequent blossoms deck'd her flowing hair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But still my shorten'd breath fast went and came,</L>
<L>O'er my embarrass'd limbs a stiffness hung,</L>
<L>My heart throbb'd strong, and shook my la∣bouring frame,</L>
<L>And fears, I know not how, unnerved my tongue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Resolved to speak, some secret power re∣strain'd,</L>
<L>Ashamed, and angry with myself I grew,</L>
<L>With crimson consciousness my cheeks were stain'd,</L>
<L>And quick again the conscious stains withdrew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She, whether unobservant all the while,</L>
<L>Or else this strange confusion to relieve,</L>
<L>Talks with her wonted ease, and careless smile,</L>
<L>But brief and vague each answer which I give.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
<L>Then changed my fickle will it's first design,</L>
<L>Determined sudden on some future day,</L>
<L>Then would I each perplexity untwine,</L>
<L>And every ardent wish before her lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A transient calm succeeded in my breast,</L>
<L>Yet sure, thought I, they were not so conceal'd,</L>
<L>But she th' emotions of my heart hath guess'd,</L>
<L>She too may haply wish they were reveal'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' now my faultering tongue its aid denies,</L>
<L>She must have read the language of my soul,</L>
<L>Nor have I mark'd displeasure in her eyes,</L>
<L>When forth from mine the glance of love hath stole.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then turning round in haste, as if afraid</L>
<L>Lest Diffidence again might intervene;</L>
<L>Not daring to erect my timid head,</L>
<L>My hesitating lips disclosed my pain.</L>

<L>IN nothing was I learn'd, but only how</L>
<L>To pen my flocks, and drive them to the field,</L>
<L>In the strait furrow to direct my plough,</L>
<L>And when my hoe, and pruning-hook to wield.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Uncultivated was my mind, and mean,</L>
<L>My abject thoughts low fasten'd to the earth,</L>
<L>Till Love with hand benign brake Custom's chain,</L>
<L>And bade me soar beyond my humble birth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With beauty fired, I look'd around, and saw</L>
<L>The charms of nature never seen before.</L>
<L>O Love! a willing Vassal to thy law</L>
<L>I bend, I feel thy blessings, and adore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Prompted by thee, as yet with trembling tongue,</L>
<L>I call'd the Muses, and desired their aid;</L>
<L>My wood-notes in the hazel copse I sung,</L>
<L>And caught th' attention of the listening Maid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
<L>She listen'd to my strains, She heard my tale,</L>
<L>While deepening blushes o'er her cheeks arise,</L>
<L>The soft consenting sigh my lips inhale,</L>
<L>I see the yielding languor of her eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No, witness Truth! if ever I estrange</L>
<L>This grateful heart, which only beats for thee—</L>
<L>Why utter needless vows? I cannot change;</L>
<L>Fix'd are my bonds, nor will I e'er be free.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fix'd is thy gentle sway; by thee my Mind</L>
<L>Avarice, and all its sordid acts disdains;</L>
<L>The common vice of Passion unrefined,</L>
<L>The common vice among our country Swains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence stinging cares; hence groveling they behold</L>
<L>The state of riches with an envious eye;</L>
<L>They think not aught beyond the power of gold,</L>
<L>Nor know how Love can lift the soul on high.</L>

<L>Oh, come my Fair One! I have thatch'd above,</L>
<L>And whiten'd all around my little cot,</L>
<L>Shorn are the hedges leading to the grove,</L>
<L>Nor is the seat, and willow bower forgot.</L>

<L>Low is the path of life in which I move,</L>

<L>Say then my Thespia, shall not I e'erlong,</L>
<L>The blue-ey'd Sisters hail with grateful song?</L>

Who to these streams (no doubt inspired by Heaven)</L>
<L>Such matchless force, and energy have given?</L>

<L>O Thou! who climb'st at morn the mountain high,</L>
<L>Viewing th' impurpled East with joyful eye,</L>
<L>Thence with light step descending to the vale,</L>
<L>Imbibest with extasy the breezy gale!</L>
<L>Or piercing thro' some covert yet untried,</L>
<L>Beating the moist, o'er-hanging boughs aside,</L>
<L>Still movest delighted on with nimble pace,</L>
<L>The sprinkled dew-drops glittering in thy face,</L>
<L>Listening the brook which idly brawls along,</L>
<L>And every plumed Warbler's matin song!</L>
<L><PB N="103" REF="103"/>
Or when the burnish'd Car by Phoebus roll'd,</L>
<L>Darts more intense it's rays of liquid gold,</L>
<L>Beneath some ivy-fringed cave reclined,</L>
<L>Fancy's bright Visions rushing on thy Mind,</L>
<L>With spirits bland, nursed by the genial Powers,</L>
<L>Soothest with melodious notes the sultry hours!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor less when each gay verdant scene is lost,</L>
<L>And Winter shoots his darts of polar frost,</L>
<L>With Exercise thy Sister, pleased, to brave</L>
<L>The Winds fierce issuing from their stormy cave!</L>
<L>Fleet o'er the smooth and ice-bound lake to skim,</L>
<L>While the blood glows in every active limb!</L>
<L>To follow where the Hounds direct their speed,</L>
<L>Urging o'er hill and dale the rapid Steed!</L>
<L>Or by the social blaze, with cheerful breast</L>
<L>Prompting the tale of mirth and frolic jest,</L>
<L>The rural laugh which springs from heart-felt glee,</L>
<L>The sprightly dance, and artless minstrelsy!</L>
<L><PB N="104" REF="104"/>
Hygeia! Fairest Nymph of Dian's train!</L>
<L>Ah! why by Me so long pursued in vain!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I see thee not, when beams Morn's purple light,</L>
<L>When shines the Sun with mid-day fervour bright,</L>
<L>I meet thee not upon the mountain's brow,</L>
<L>In the wild woodland, or the vale below,</L>
<L>Nor by the pratling brook with osiers crown'd,</L>
<L>Nor in the cave with flaunting ivy bound;</L>
<L>And when the Minstrel sings with heart-felt glee,</L>
<L>To Him confest, thy charms are hid from Me.</L>
<L>Hygeia! Fairest Nymph of Dian's train!</L>
<L>Ah! why by me so long pursued in vain!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet sometimes at a distance, I survey,</L>
<L>But dim, and thro' a cloud, thy paler ray.</L>
<L>I snatch the lucid interval, and soar</L>
<L>Awhile with swift-wing'd Fancy as of yore;</L>
<L><PB N="105" REF="105"/>
The Muses invocate, with zealous prayer,</L>
<L>Nor unpropitious do the Muses hear;</L>
<L>Till the cloud thickening, veils thy beams in Night,</L>
<L>Fancy prone sinks from her aerial height:</L>
<L>Pain whets his stings, their torpid force prevails,</L>
<L>The venom spreads, the mental ardour fails.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still fly Hygeia! drooping Fancy fly!</L>
<L>A sacred Power there is, forever nigh.</L>
<L>Love, in thy shape My Thespia, stands unmoved;</L>
<L>Love ne'er deserts what once it truly loved.</L>
<L>Sickness still more forbids it's bonds to start,</L>
<L>And pity softens more it's tender heart:</L>
<L>A gentler, but more strong attraction reigns;</L>
<L>And milder energies new-brace it's chains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While then My Thespia's looks each care be∣guile,</L>
<L>While in her presence pain and languor smile,</L>
<L><PB N="106" REF="106"/>
While on the mind She pours an healing balm,</L>
<L>And binds it's tempests in an Halcyon calm,</L>
<L>Awakens hope, and banishes despair,</L>
<L>And tho' I feel, yet teaches Me to bear;</L>
<L>Still fly Hygeia! Thou too Fancy fly!</L>
<L>A strengthening soul-inspiring Power is nigh.</L>
<L>Let That, her influence; This, her strains refuse;</L>
<L>Thou shalt be Health my Thespia, Thou the Muse.</L>

<LG>
<L>AT least in plumes unborrow'd, I present</L>
<L>These Elegies of Love to Thespia's eye;</L>
<L>She hates with Me the florid ornament,</L>
<L>And gawdy Muse, whose strains her soul belie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To Thespia only, and the Few, whose taste</L>
<L>Accords with Her's, the tender lays belong.</L>
<L><PB N="107" REF="107"/>
Life's real scenes, domestic, simple, chaste,</L>
<L>Form for the Vulgar no attractive song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Envy might hasten to depreciate fame;</L>
<L>And Critics sneer with many a low-bred jest,</L>
<L>Join with their groveling wit, her spotless name,</L>
<L>Studious t' affect with pain her modest breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They might perhaps with base illiberal art</L>
<L>Each weaker number cull, (for who can build</L>
<L>The perfect rhime?) and from the excepted part,</L>
<L>Pronounce the Whole with faults unseemly fill'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or hating Living Worth, some Author dead</L>
<L>Produce; his sainted page contrast with mine;</L>
<L>And think the wreathe must fade upon my head,</L>
<L>Because his laurels, spite of Malice, shine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="108" REF="108"/>
<L>Not thus, They would aver, Tibullus wove</L>
<L>His gentle song to Delia's matchless praise;</L>
<L>Not Hammond thus, the favour'd Priest of Love,</L>
<L>Taught by each Grace, pour'd his mellifluous lays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their Muse, no doubt, entire Perfection crowns,</L>
<L>No little lapse, no flaw we can espy.—</L>
<L>Insensible are They to Envy's frowns,</L>
<L>They do not live t' offend Detractions' eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No Bard I seek to rival in my strain;</L>
<L>As Nature dictated, the Roman wrote;</L>
<L>Hammond in elegant and easy vein,</L>
<L>Hath sweetly copied what Tibullus thought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As Nature dictated with sovereign will,</L>
<L>So rose my thoughts, so flow'd my easy lay.</L>
<L><PB N="109" REF="109"/>
The quick sensations fly from tardy skill,</L>
<L>Yet Elegance may move as swift as They.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For with the Sentiment, th' Expression springs,</L>
<L>From the same lucid chamber of the Mind.</L>
<L>Coarseness it's speed must check, retract it's wings,</L>
<L>And hovering ound, long strive to be refined.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Thespia smiles—She all the verse in∣spired;</L>
<L>Form'd each idea, sees each feeling true.</L>
<L>Love is the only Judge to be desired,</L>
<L>Where only Love the genuine portraits drew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence then away, Ye mean Invidious Bands!</L>
<L>And the vile Croud, which iterates your voice!</L>
<L>These strains, my Thespia, shall escape their hands;</L>
<L>Such is thy purer wish, and such my choice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="110" REF="110"/>
<L>Some Friends Alone, our faithful loves shall read,</L>
<L>Consentient Minds, who cannot, will not blame;</L>
<L>From Envy, from each grosser passion freed,</L>
<L>Whose thoughts are hallow'd, whose esteem is Fame.</L>
