<HEAD>To the Right Honourable <HI>Sidney</HI> Lord <HI>Godolphin,</HI> Lord High-Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> and Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF those Cares in which the Service of a Great QUEEN, and the Love of Your Country, have so justly Engag'd Your Lordship, would allow any Leisure to run back and remember those Arts and Studies, which were once the Grace and Entertainment of
<PB REF="4"/>
Your Lordship's Youth; I have Pre∣sumption enough to hope, that this Tragedy may, some Time or other, find an Hour to Divert Your Lordship. Poe∣try, which was so venerable to former Ages, as in many Places to make a Part of their Religious Worship, and every where to be had in the highest Honour and Esteem, has miserably languish'd and been despis'd, for want of that Fa∣vour and Protection which it found in the Famous <HI>Augustan</HI> Age. Since then, it may be asserted, without any Partiali∣ty to the Present Time, it never had a fairer Prospect of lifting up its Head, and returning to its former Reputation, than now: And the best Reason can be given for it, is, that it seems to have a par∣ticular Hope from, and Dependance upon Your Lordship, and to expect all just Encouragement, when those Great Men, who have the Power to Protect it, have so Delicate and Polite a Taste and Understanding of its True Value. The Restoring and Preserving any Part of Learning is so Generous an Action in it
<PB REF="5"/>
self, that it naturally falls into Your Lordship's Province, since every Thing that may serve to Improve the Mind, has a Right to the Patronage of so Great and Universal a Genius for Knowledge as Your Lordship's. It is indeed a Piece of good Fortune, upon which I cannot help Congratulating the present Age, that there is so Great a Man, at a Time when there is so great an Occasion for him. The Divisions which Your Lord∣ship has heal'd, the Temper which You have restor'd to our Councils, and that indefatigable Care and Diligence which You have us'd in preserving our Peace at Home, are Benefits so virtuously and so seasonably conferr'd upon Your Coun∣try, as shall draw the Praises of all Wise Men, and the Blessings of all Good Men upon Your Lordship's Name. And when those unreasonable Feuds and A∣nimosities, which keep Faction alive, shall be bury'd in silence and forgotten, that great Publick Good shall be uni∣versally acknowledg'd, as the Happy Effect of Your Lordship's most Equal
<PB REF="6"/>
Temper and Right Understanding. That this Glorious End may very suddenly succeed to Your Lordship's Candor and Generous Endeavours after it, must be the Wish of every good <HI>English∣man.</HI></P>
<CLOSER>I am, My LORD,
<SIGNED>Your Lordship's most Obedient, Humble Servant, N. ROWE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. <HI>Betterton.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>TO Night, in Honour of the marry'd Life,</L>
<L>Our Author Treats you with a Virtuous Wife;</L>
<L>A Lady, who, for Twenty Years, withstood</L>
<L>The pressing Instances of Flesh and Blood;</L>
<L>Her Husband, still a Man of Sense reputed,</L>
<L>(Unless this Tale his Wisdom have confuted,)</L>
<L>Left her at ripe Eighteen, to seek Renown,</L>
<L>And Battel for a Harlot at <HI>Troy</HI> Town;</L>
<L>To fill his Place, fresh Lovers came in Shoals,</L>
<L>Much such as now a-days are <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Tools,</L>
<L>Some Men of Wit, but the most part were Fools.</L>
<L>They sent her <HI>Billets doux,</HI> and Presents many,</L>
<L>Of ancient Tea and <HI>Thericlean</HI> China;</L>
<L>Rail'd at the Gods, toasted her o'er and o'er,</L>
<L>Dress'd at Her, danc'd, and fought, and sigh'd, and swore;</L>
<L>In short, did all that Men could do to have her,</L>
<L>And Damn'd them'elves to get into her Favour;</L>
<L>But all in vain, the Virtuous Dame stood Buff,</L>
<L>And let 'em know that she was Coxcomb Proof;</L>
<L><HI>Messieurs</HI> the <HI>Beaux,</HI> what think you of the Matter?</L>
<L>Don't you believe old <HI>Homer</HI> given to Flatter?</L>
<L>When you approach, and pressing the soft Hand,</L>
<L>Favours, with well-bred Impudence, demand,</L>
<L>Is it in Woman's Weakness to withstand?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cease to be vain, and give the Sex their Due;</L>
<L>Our <HI>English</HI> Wives shall prove this Story true:</L>
<L>We have our Chaste <HI>Penelope's,</HI> who mourn</L>
<L>Their Widow'd Beds, and wait their Lords Return;</L>
<L>We have our Heroes too, who bravely bear,</L>
<L>Far from their Home, the Dangers of the War;</L>
<L>Who careless of the Winter Season's Rage,</L>
<L>New Toils explore, and in new Cares engage;</L>
<L><PB REF="8"/>
From Realm to Realm their Chief unweary'd goes,</L>
<L>And restless journies on, to give the World Repose.</L>
<L>Such are the constant Labours of the Sun,</L>
<L>Whose active, glorious Course is never done;</L>
<L>And tho', when hence he parts, with us 'tis Night,</L>
<L>Still he goes on, and lends to other Worlds his Light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye beauteous Nymphs, with open Arms prepare</L>
<L>To meet the Warriors, and reward their Care;</L>
<L>May you for ever kind and faithful prove,</L>
<L>And pay their Days of Toil with Nights of Love.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE,</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoke by Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>JUST going to take Water, at the Stairs</L>
<L>I stopp'd, and came again to beg your Pray'rs;</L>
<L>You see how ill my Love has been repaid,</L>
<L>That I am like to live and die a Maid;</L>
<L>Poetick Rules and Justice to maintain,</L>
<L>I to the Woods am order'd back again,</L>
<L>To Madam <HI>Cinthia,</HI> and her Virgin Train.</L>
<L>'Tis an uncomfortable Life they lead;</L>
<L>Instead of Quilts and Down, the Silvan Bed</L>
<L>With Skins of Beasts, with Leaves and Moss is spread;</L>
<L>No Morning Toilets do their Chambers grace,</L>
<L>Where famous Pearl <HI>Cosmeticks</HI> find a Place,</L>
<L>With Powder for the Teeth, and Plaister for the Face.</L>
<L>But in Defiance of Complexion, they,</L>
<L>Like arrant Huswives, rise by Break of Day,</L>
<L>Cut a brown Crust, saddle their Nags, and Mounting,</L>
<L>In scorn of the Green-Sickness ride a Hunting:</L>
<L>Your <HI>Sal,</HI> and Harts-horn Drops, they deal not in;</L>
<L>They have no Vapours, nor no witty Spleen.</L>
<L>No Coffee to be had, and I am told,</L>
<L>As to the Tea they drink, 'tis mostly cold.</L>
<L>For Conversation, nothing can be worse,</L>
<L>'Tis all amongst themselves, and that's the Curse.</L>
<L>One Topick there, as here, does seldom fail,</L>
<L>We Women rarely want a Theme to rail;</L>
<L>But bating that one Pleasure of Backbiting,</L>
<L>There is no Earthly Thing they can delight in.</L>
<L>There are no <HI>Indian</HI> Houses, to drop in</L>
<L>And fancy Stuffs, and chuse a pretty Screen,</L>
<L>To while away an Hour or so—<HI>I swear</HI></L>
<L><HI>These Cups are pretty, but they're deadly dear:</HI></L>
<L>And if some unexpected Friend appear,</L>
<L><HI>The Dev'l!—Who cou'd have thought to meet you here?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We should but very badly entertain</L>
<L>You that delight in Toasting and Champaign;</L>
<L>But keep your tender Persons safe at home,</L>
<L>We know you hate hard Riding: But if some</L>
<L>Tough, honest, Country Fox-Hunter would come,</L>
<L>Visit our Goddess, and her Maiden Court,</L>
<L>'Tis Ten to One but we may show him Sport.</L>
