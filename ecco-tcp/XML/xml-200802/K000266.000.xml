<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<Q><P>AS <HI>Poland</HI> lyes almost in the same Latitude with <HI>England,</HI> so the Character the Poet has here gi∣ven of the <HI>Poles,</HI> seems so exactly to match what some ill-natur'd People have said of some in <HI>En∣land,</HI> that he easily foresees this Censorious Age will be apt to mis-judge him, as if he had some Oblique Meaning, and that this was a <HI>Satyr</HI> levell'd at some People nearer Home <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han the Castle of <HI>Warsaw.</HI></P></Q>
<P>To foresee an Accident and not endeavour to be prepar'd against it, is a Piece of Policy peculiar to an Author that sets up <HI>To Reform the Errors</HI> of <HI>Petty Statsmen</HI> three times a week to no Purpose; and it adds very much to a Malefactor's Conviction to be guilty of a Willful Crime. Wherefore He had better, either to have kept his <HI>Foresight</HI> to himself, or stifled his <HI>Poem</HI> before he had sent it abroad, to the Great Abuse of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imself, and the Patriots he has taken the Freedom to Characte∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>. As for his Skill in Poetry, if it was no better than his Knowledge in Geography, He might have spar'd the Trouble of a <HI>Preface to the Reader,</HI> since there is so great a Differ∣ence between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Warsaw</HI> in their Latitude, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he first is <HI>Lon. 18. 36. Lat. 51. 32.</HI> the last <HI>Lon. 42. 5. Lat. 52. 7.</HI></P>
<Q><PB REF="3"/><P>But the Author humbly hopes all such <HI>Inuendo-Men</HI> will consider, that as they can have no Reason to Think so, but <HI>Similitude</HI> of Characters, so no Conjectures of theirs, ought to pre-judge his meaning, in which he demands to be left to himself, and expects to be understood in the fol∣lowing Poem as he <HI>Speaks,</HI> not as every prejudic'd Man may imagine he <HI>meant.</HI></P></Q>
<P>How any Man can <HI>humbly hope,</HI> that has the Arrogance to say, He can be charg'd with nothing but similitude of Cha∣racters, is beyoud the <HI>Reach</HI> of my Ʋnderstanding, and if he has not done by the Gentlemen whom he has Injuriously treated, as well as those whose Reputation is blasted with his Commen∣dation, as if he had actually written down their Christian and Sir Names in Capital Letters, then I have no claim to any such Thing as Common Apprehension.</P>
<Q><P>If any are so Weak to tell us, That <HI>Smithfield</HI> and <HI>Cheap∣side,</HI> cannot be meant of <HI>Poland,</HI> the Author presumes to ask such People, if ever they have been at <HI>Warsaw;</HI> and, if they have, and don't know that there is both a <HI>Smithfield</HI> and a <HI>Cheapside,</HI> as well as a <HI>May-Fair;</HI> and a <HI>Bear-Garden,</HI> he is sorry for their Heads, and desires them to step thi∣ther again to Reform their Memories.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Poland</HI> may have Places put to the same uses as <HI>Smith∣field</HI> and <HI>Cheapside,</HI> and Fairs and Bear-gardens may be in Request there; but it is none of his business, to bring <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Transactions upon the <HI>Polish</HI> Theatre. And any Man of Compassion has very great Reason to be sorry for <HI>his Head,</HI> who thinks to conceal what was Printed near <HI>Bartholomew-Close,</HI> under the sorry Artifice of an Impression from <HI>Dant∣zick.</HI></P>
<Q><P>But suppose there are not places call'd directly by those Names, if there are places apply'd to the same Uses, what has any Body to question the Allegories? A poor Au∣thor must never Write at all, if he is not at Liberty to chose His <HI>Metaphors,</HI> and all the rest of the necessary Fi∣gures of Speech to help out his Expression.</P></Q>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
He has forgot his Tryal at the <HI>Old-Baily</HI> for writing <HI>The Shortest Way with the Dissenters,</HI> or He would never in∣sist upon an Author's Liberty to chuse what Metaphors He thinks fit; for, though He did not pay so dearly for his Be∣loved <HI>Ironies</HI> as he deserv'd, yet the Sentence then pass'd on Him by the <HI>Bench</HI> might have had such an Effect upon his Temper, as not to make him <HI>uneasie,</HI> but when he was <HI>break∣ing through</HI> the Bonds, he was engag'd in to the Government, in being tyed up to his Good Behaviour.</P>
<Q><P>If 'tis alledg'd that there is too great an Affinity in the Story.—He Answers, If that be True, he is sorry for it; but at the same time he Hopes not, and the matter of Fact ought to be prov'd, before he stands Censur'd for Calumny.</P></Q>
<P>Though the Character of the Persons his Satyr points at are False and Malicious, yet they bear so near a Resemblance to what is said of them by their Enemies of the <HI>Dissenting Party,</HI> that the Scandal is fix'd beyond an Excuse, and ought to be Ammadverted upon with the utmost severity, unless the Gentlemen in Power close with the Libeller, and fling off all Deference and Respect for the Memories of their Predeces∣sors.</P>
<Q><P>'Tis very hard that a Man cannot Write of the Follies of other Nations, but People will be always comparing them with their own. One would ha' Thought the Au∣thor had Travell'd far enough to find out Histories and odd Passages to divert us; but if neither <HI>China, Poland,</HI> nor the Inhabitants of the <HI>Moon</HI> will protect Folks from being Hang'd, as the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> said, <HI>for Tinking,</HI> go on, Gentlemen, and if the <HI>Cap</HI> fits any Body let 'em wear it. You are Welcome to say these <HI>Polish</HI> Grandees represent <HI>Englishmen,</HI> but look to it, <HI>ye Sons of Censure,</HI> that can Swear to a Man's Meaning, and know his Inside without the help of his Outside: For if the People your Profoundi∣ty
<PB REF="5"/>
pretends to describe, are Affronted, the Action of Slander lyes against You, and not the Anthor. In the Writing 'tis a Poem, you, in the Reading, turn it into a Libel, and you merit the Punishment for the Metamor∣phosis.</P></Q>
<P>An ingennous Confession of the Author, who would be thought to take the Pains of Concealing himself. <HI>If neither</HI> China, Poland, <HI>nor the Inhabitants of the Moon will pro∣tect Folks from being Hang'd,</HI> &amp;c. Your Humble Servant Mr. <HI>Daniel Foe!</HI> you might as well have given us your Name at Large, for every one knows who wrote the <HI>Consoli∣dator;</HI> and as to your <HI>Meaning,</HI> they must be Men of pro∣found Stupidity indeed, that cannot find it out by your Gaping, you are so Intelligible your self, amongst your want of under∣standing. So that the Scandal will be laid at your Door who made it a <HI>Libel,</HI> not at your Readers, who finds it as such.</P>
<Q><P>Perhaps there is a sort of Affinity among the Vitious part of Mankind in all Countries and Climates; and the Author Doubts not he should have run the same Risque of Misconstruction, had he Wrote this at <HI>Paris</HI> as at <HI>London,</HI> that he should have been summon'd before the Court <HI>of Honour</HI> for Libelling the Princes <HI>of the Blood,</HI> the <HI>Sorbon∣ne,</HI> or the <HI>Councellors of Parliament:</HI> 'tis very hard it should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there, and here too.</P></Q>
<P>Had such a Piece of Scurrility dar'd to show its Face at <HI>Paris,</HI> the Author of it would scarce have had his Heels at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> during Life, and if some People whom it concerns <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of this nature, would but perform those Duties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the Well being of the Government, He may chance to meet with none of the Civilest Treatment in <HI>London</HI> for his Impudence; since no Term can be too opprobri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thinks no Appellation Bitter enough against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Direct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs of the Publ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>k Affairs, who act contrary to the Methods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> prescribe to them.</P>
<Q><PB REF="6"/><P>Since then this is the Fate of Authors, and he must ex∣pect it, he Submits, but desires however, that these Un∣christian Censurers will take this along with them, and so make a Vertue of their want of Charity. That where-ever the Similitude of Character pinches them too close, they would prevent the Severity of the Application, by Re∣forming the Likeness; the Satyr wou'd then have the de∣sired Effect, <HI>viz.</HI> By drawing the Imaginary Picture of Outlandish Devels, really Transform our own.</P></Q>
<P>The Fate of an Author that casts such a Reproach on the Church and Government Establish'd, ought not to terminate in a <HI>Scotch Casement;</HI> but He, that has offer'd up a <HI>Hymn</HI> to the Pillory, and made it clap its wooden Wings for Joy, at the Reception of its new Tenant, would not be much lamented if the Three Leg'd Tree, a Mile and a half out of Town, should pay Him the same Compliment: Since it is not his Reader's <HI>want</HI> of Charity, but his own, that renders him Criminal.</P>
<Q><P>Nor do I apprehend the World will be less Solicitous about who is the Author of this: Some perhaps will guess one, some another; and the <HI>Hawkers,</HI> they tell me, will ac∣cording to Custom, Cry it about the street in the famous Name of <HI>Daniell de Foe.</HI> And tho' they might as well Guess it was Wrote by the Man in the <HI>Moon,</HI> yet I am content, He, or any body else should go away with the Credit of it. 'Tis enough that I am out of the Reach of the <HI>Polish</HI> Resentments, and cannot be Prosecuted by the <HI>Cardinal</HI> Primate, most of the Persons here toucht at be∣ing his Friends, and all of them in his Interest; and as for the World they may do their Worst.</P><P>I am their Ʋnconcerned Humble Servant, <HI>Anglipoloski,</HI> Of Luthuania.</P></Q>
<P><PB REF="7"/>When an Outrage is committed, it is but natural to be in Quest of the Person that caus'd it; and it will not be difficult, <HI>without the assistance of the Hawkers,</HI> who are more at his Service than his <HI>Handmaids</HI> the <HI>Nine Muses,</HI> to find that this Label is not, without sufficient Grounds for so doing, charg'd with a Name those Prophane Throats are incessantly piercing our Ears with. Which may prove his <HI>being out of the Reach of the</HI> Polish <HI>Resentments,</HI> to be a more Chimara and false suggestion; for though the Ecclesiastical Authority may not take him to Task, He may be grinded to Powder by the Secular Arm, which he must own himself obnoxious to, notwithstanding his Borrow'd Name of <HI>Anglipoloski.</HI></P>

<L>The Land too happy would the People bless,</L>

The way to make <HI>Poland</HI> unhappy, is to follow the Poets prescriptions, and perswade all Men to be in Love with his <HI>Sham-Moderations;</HI> and to <HI>advance to Liberty's Defence</HI> in his Scheme of Politicks, is for us to turn <HI>Levellers,</HI> and bring the Establish'd Constitution to such a Pass that we may all equal in Power, and share the Direction of Affairs alike, without any thing like a Kingly Government, which this pretended Peace at Home may bring us to at last, without the Interposition of such Patriots whom he calls <HI>Degenerate Palatines.</HI></P>

<P>We agree with him, that the Fate of Prince and People depends upon the Choice of a Ministry, and that Wise Coun∣cils may support a <HI>Weak</HI> Prince, but must deny the Conse∣quence, that none but a wise Prince can have a Wise Mini∣stry, since he has own'd in this very Paragraph, that a weak one may be restor'd by one that is Wise.</P>

<P>That they are a <HI>Happy Two</HI> must be taken for granted since they are not only in the Prince's Favour and Peoples too, but we are not to inter from, but to say they neglect their <HI>own In∣terest</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
out of <HI>Regard</HI> to the <HI>Queen's</HI> is an impardonable Absur∣dity, because the Interest of Queen and People are Insepa∣rable.</P>

<Q><LG>
<L>OF all the needful Helps to Sov'reign Rule,</L>
<L><HI>The Usefull'st Thing in</HI> Poland <HI>is a Fool;</HI></L>
<L>Among the <HI>Utensils</HI> of Government,</L>
<L>No <HI>Tool,</HI> like Him, supplies the grand Intent:</L>
<L>When he's in close <HI>Cabal,</HI> and <HI>Council</HI> set,</L>

<L><PB N="62" REF="69"/>
The huge, unweildy, tott'ring Fabrick stands:</L>
<L>Too Solid for his Head, too Heavy for his Hands:</L>
<L>The Force Reverts, and with the swift Recoil,</L>
<L>Assuming Statesmen perish in the Broil.</L>
<L>So, Mischief like, the high returning Tide,</L>
<L>Brings sure Destruction on it's Author's Head;</L>
<L>As <HI>Engineers,</HI> that ill support their Mind;</L>
<L>Sink in the Ruine of their own Design.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>If the <HI>usefullest Thing in</HI> Poland <HI>is a Fool,</HI> then a wise Man is a Fool, for wise Persons at the Helm of Government are the <HI>usefullest Things</HI> we can hope for.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L><HI>Poland,</HI> how strangely has thy Land been Blest,</L>
<L>By Fools Redeem'd, when e'er by Knaves Oppress:</L>
<L>The Graver Blockheads of thy tott'ring State,</L>
<L>Protect thy Fame, and help to make thee Great.</L>
<L>For when they might thy Government o'erthrow,</L>

<L>The untrain'd Politicians court their Fate,</L>
<L>If <HI>Knaves</HI> were never <HI>Fools,</HI> they'd soon blow up the State.</L>

<P>That's very strange indeed, to be <HI>redeem'd by Fools,</HI> and al∣most as much as to say, when we were at the brink of Ruin, by a parcel of <HI>Knaves</HI> who shar'd the Administration in King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign, the Fools interpos'd in our Behalf, and brought about the late R—vol—n.</P>

<P>So that <HI>Folly</HI>'s a Dignity, and <HI>Dubs a Polish Peer,</HI> which is a sort of Petty-Treason, because it's the Queen alone who Dubs a Commoner a Peer, and insinuates as if Her Sacred Majesty was Guilty of Short-sightedness in the Distribution of Her Royal Fa∣vours, and could not distinguish a Wise Man from a Fool. <HI>Re∣trabas aut Vapules mi Poetula.</HI></P>

<L>Lest <HI>Poland</HI>'s latent Errors should appear.</L>
