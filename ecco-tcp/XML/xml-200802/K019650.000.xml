<HEAD>A General History OF TRADE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I Promised to Concern these Discourses as little as possible with our Politicks, and with the Party Disputes which are among us, and I'll keep my Word in it as well as it can be done; tho' I acknowledge it will be very Difficult to do so, when to the Nations great Disquiet, we are just now al∣most going by the Bars about whether we shall Trade to <HI>France</HI> or No.</P>
<P>It is Impossible to speak of Trade in Gene∣ral and leave out entirely the Trade to <HI>France,</HI> and I fear it will be impossible, <HI>at least to me,</HI> to say what may be necessary to be said in order to set the Trade to <HI>France</HI> in a Clear View, without being Charg'd with Leaning to one Side or other.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>Among the several Opinions about the Trade between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> I find none who have any true knowledge of the Trade in General, but what agree in this, That there ought to be some Trade opened with <HI>France</HI> seeing we have made Peace with them; Likewise all agree, That Trade, such as it shall be, ought to be Settled and Regu∣lated by Articles and Agreements between the Nations, which is the thing we call a Treaty of Commerce.</P>
<P>Being thus agreed in the main Point, That some Trade must and ought to be Settled, and that a Treaty of Commerce ought to be made; the Question remaining in Debate seems to be only, What degree of Trade with <HI>France</HI> shall be entred into, and under what Regulations, Restrictions, Duties and Prohibitions.</P>
<P>Some are of the Opinion, That the Trade to <HI>France</HI> has always been a Losing Trade, and that it will be so still, and that as it lies at this time under Excessive Duties it will be prevented from being so, and that therefore all those high Duties which are now lay'd upon the <HI>French</HI> Importations ought to re∣main.</P>
<P>Others say, that as we have lay'd high Duties on the greatest part of <HI>French</HI> Impor∣tations here, by which the Quantities Import∣ed will now be reduced: so the <HI>French</HI> have Loaded our Woollen Manufactures, and other Exportations thither with such heavy Duties, or else with Total Prohibitions that effectually
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
foreclose the Trade so, That as you will Im∣port little from <HI>France,</HI> you will Export less to <HI>France,</HI> and the Ballance will run against you worse in matters of Profit than it did before; these Men therefore are for taking off our high Duties on every Side, and leaving the Trade, as they say all Trade ought to be, Free and Un∣burthened, except with such moderate Im∣positions as may be no Grievance either to the Consumer or the Importer.</P>
<P>But a third sort say, there is a Necessary Medium to be observ'd in this Case, and that seeing an Opportunity is put into our Hands upon the Occasion of the Peace, to Settle this Trade to our Advantage, we ought to get all possible Burthens taken off from our Manufactures and other Exports from hence in <HI>France,</HI> and yet at the same time keep on such part of our high Duties upon <HI>French</HI> Goods Im∣ported here, as may be sufficient to restrain their Importation in too great quantities, so as to be prejudicial to our Trade in General, and cause an Over-ballance in the Trade to our Prejudice.</P>
<P>The People who have had the Guiding this Great Affair say they have done this, and the opposite Party say they have not; one Side Challenges the other, THESE <HI>say,</HI> Trade is betray'd, the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade ruin'd, the General Interest neglected, the Manufactures of <HI>England</HI> injur'd, and the <HI>French</HI> have too much Advantage; that they will Over-ballance us still, and the Trade be yet to our loss: On the other hand THOSE <HI>say,</HI> they have Secured the <HI>English</HI> Commerce effectually
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
to our Advantage, by Opening a Door to our Trade into <HI>France,</HI> having Obliged the <HI>Fr.</HI> King to take off all his Prohibitions and Additional Duties from our Importations <HI>there,</HI> back to the Tariff of 1664. and yet have shut the Door against the quantity of their Importations here, by leaving on great part of the Additional Du∣ties which the Trade was Loaded with during the War, so that the Prices of their Goods, particularly their Wines, Brandy, Silks, Linen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are the Principal part of their Importations here, will be so great, by reason of those Duties remaining on by this Treaty, that the Consumption will of Course be greatly short of what it was usually in those times when, as the other alledge, their Importation so much Encreased and Overbal∣lanc'd us. <HI>Again</HI> THESE <HI>say</HI> they have not left Duty enough on to lessen the said Impor∣tations; and that the Duties ought to have been still Higher. THOSE <HI>say</HI> the Duties left are sufficient; and that the Advantage is such, and so great, as that they could not obtain any farther, nor indeed reasonably in∣sist upon laying higher Duties on <HI>French</HI> Goods, unless they had at the same time Consented that some part of the high Duties in <HI>France</HI> should remain upon our Goods; which for the Encouragement of our Woollen Manufacture they thought it not proper to yield to, and they declare that they do think the high Duties which are to remain on <HI>French</HI> Goods here, are sufficient to preserve the Trade to the Advantage of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>If I can make any Judgment of the pre∣sent Dispute, it is, as near as can be, wholly Comprised in this Abridgment: I shall not enter here into any part of the Question, it being the business of a History of Trade, ra∣ther to Relate than Decide the Dispute. I am already Charg'd with being much farther Concern'd in the Difference than I really am; and I shall therefore avoid Disputing any thing here, but Impartially state the Question, and lay down the state of the several Duties and Prohibitions on both Sides, as they are now, while the Treaty is in Suspense and not made Effectual; and as they are to be, if the said Treaty is to take place; I shall afterward shew what the Difference is that will be be∣tween the former Duties before the War, and those, that if the Treaty take place, are to be the Settled Customs of the Trade; and then shall leave every Man, by the assistance of those helps, to make a Judgment for him∣self.</P>
<P>In order to this, and for the information of those who, tho' not Imediately Verst in the Entries Out∣wards and Inwards, or not so much Master of the Book of Rates as to know every thing without a far∣ther Enquiry, are yet willing to know in Concise Terms, on what Foot the Trade now stands, and on what Foot it is to stand, that they may not, as most Men do, Dispute without Book, and talk rashly, gi∣ving their Judgment without any Knowledge of the matter.</P>
<P>I say, for the Information of such as these, I have subjoyned proper Tables of the several Duties on <HI>French</HI> Goods, as they now are, and as they are to be if the Treaty of Comerce takes place.</P>

<P><PB N="17" REF="16"/>By these Tables of the Duties it may be observed, That as the Duties on the Goods from other Countries now are, so the Duties of the Goods of like quality from <HI>France</HI> are to be by the Treaty of Commerce, if the said Treaty takes place; and this is in pursu∣ance of that part of the 9th Article of the Treaty, which provides, that no greater or hea∣vier Duties be laid upon the <HI>French</HI> Goods, than is paid by other Nations for Goods of the like quality.</P>
<P>It is not the business of these Tracts, which according to their Title, are to be a History of Trade, not a Dispute about Trade; I say, it is not my business so much to Argue, as it is to Relate; and therefore I shall avoid the Dispute: But altho' I do avoid Debating, it seems necessary to state the Case upon which the Parties on either side are Debating so warmly, as it relates to the Levelling the Duties on the Importation of <HI>French</HI> Goods, to the same Rate which Goods of the like quality pay from other Countries.</P>
<P>This Debate relates chiefly to the Trade of Wine from <HI>Portugal,</HI> the Sum of which Case is as follows:</P>
<P>Before the war with <HI>France</HI> began, the Gross of our Importations of Wines was from <HI>France</HI>; neither was there any propor∣tion between the quantities, as may appear by this brief Account,</P>

<P>So that the Proportion, is about One to Fifty Eight; so much did the Importations of Wine from <HI>France,</HI> exceed the Importa∣tion of Wines from <HI>Portugal</HI>; as for the Wines from other Countries, they were not of the like kind, and therefore do not come into the Question.</P>
<P>All this while, altho' we had not so great an Export from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Portugal</HI> as we have had since, yet we had a very great and extended Trade; the reason of the Encrease shall be examin'd by it self.</P>
<P>The Wine Trade was not only little in quantity, but the Duties paid for it were greater than the Duties on <HI>French</HI> Wine for some years, by a very considerable Sum, as will appear by the Custom-house.</P>
<P>The Trade to <HI>Portugal</HI> stood then, ac∣cording to the following Scheme, in which the Encrease of it is also to be observed, the Reasons of that Encrease are very easie to be accounted for, and I must own, could not with any Truth, be suggested to arise from the Encrease of our Demand for their Wines, as shall be enquir'd afterward.</P>

<P><PB N="20" REF="19" MS="y"/>While the Trade of <HI>France</HI> stood at a stay, by reason of a stated Prohibition during the War, the <HI>Portuguese</HI> found the Demand for their Wines encreased to a degree, that at first their whole Kingdom could not supply; but as the prospect of the War appeared like∣ly to continue, and the Price the <HI>English</HI> gave for the Wines was very encouraging, the Vineyards encreased every year to a very great degree, so that the <HI>Portugal</HI> Produce of Wine rose from Five or Six Hundred Ton a year, to Seven or Eight Thousand, as may ap∣pear by the Import of the years since the War.</P>
<P>Yet it must be allowed on one side too in abatement of quantity, that there have been ways and means made use of to Import great quantities of <HI>French</HI> Wines under the denomination of <HI>Portuguese</HI> Wines; also the <HI>Galitia</HI> Wines were, during the prohibition of Trade with <HI>Spain,</HI> entred under the same Head; so that we are not to suppose all the Wines which are called <HI>Portuguese</HI> Wines in the Custom-house Books, to come really from <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>It happened about the year 1703, that the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> being earnestly sollicited to break his Neutrality, and Joyn with the Con∣federates in the late War with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> the Confederates being willing almost upon any Terms to engage his <HI>Portuguese</HI> Majesty; the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> tho' willing to Engage, yet took that occasion to make such Conditions, as were particularly for the advantage of his Subjects in Matters of Trade, and more espe∣cially
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
with relation to their Wines: They knew well enough that the demand for their Wines in <HI>England,</HI> was occasion'd only by the Prohibition aforesaid, which by the accident of the War, was lay'd upon <HI>French</HI> Wines; They knew also, that when ever the War came to a Conclusion, and that by a Peace with <HI>France,</HI> the Trade for the <HI>French</HI> Wines should be opened again in <HI>England,</HI> the De∣mand for the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tugal</HI> Wine would fall off again, and the <HI>French</HI> Wine would be the Common Draft of the Nation.</P>
<P>To prevent this, they enter into a Treaty with Mr. <HI>Methuen</HI> the <HI>English</HI> Ambassador, for the keeping the Duties upon <HI>French</HI> Wine up to a certain height in <HI>England</HI> after a Peace, and that the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wine should always pay a certain proportion less than the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Methuen</HI> ventur'd to agree to this Trea∣ty, and the Condition was, That the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> should take off all Prohibitions from the <HI>English</HI> Woollen Clothes, and any other <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Woollen Manufactures which were then Prohibited in <HI>Portugal</HI>; the Tenour of the said Treaty, as it is Translated in the Secretary's Offices here, is as follows: <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Her Sacred Royal Majesty of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> may, in her own and the Name of her Successors, be obliged at all times so to admit into <HI>Britain</HI> the Wines made of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Vineyards, that at no time what∣ever, whether there be Peace or War be∣tween the Kingdoms of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
any thing more may be demanded for the said Wines, under the name of Duty or Customs, or any other Title whatever, directly or indirectly, than what the Third Part of the Duty or Customs being de∣ducted, shall be demanded from an equal Quantity or Measure of <HI>French</HI> Wine, whither those Wines shall be Imported into <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> by Hogsheads, or Barrels, or any other Vessels; but if this Abatement of Customs, as is presumed to be made, shall be after any manner prejudiced or Abo∣lished, it shall be Just and Lawful for his Sacred Royal Majesty of <HI>Portugal,</HI> AGAIN to forbid the Woollen Cloaths, and the rest of the <HI>British</HI> Woollen Manufactures."</Q></P>
<P>This is the Occasion of the warm Disputes among our Parties at this time, of which, without determining one way or other, or any way embarking these Tracts in that Dis∣pute, I shall give an Impartial Abstract, re∣lating, as fairly as I can, the state of the Question, and what either Party alledge for themselves in their Defence of, or Objections against this Treaty.</P>
<P>The opposers of the Treaty of Commerce with <HI>France</HI> say, This is a fair, a just, and a reasonable Treaty; That it is Sign'd, Rati∣fied, and Exchang'd with the King of <HI>Portu∣gal,</HI> and ought to be kept Sacred. Whereas on the other hand, they say, the Treaty of Commerce with <HI>France,</HI> without any regard to the Stipulations of this Treaty, and taking
<PB N="23" REF="22" MS="y"/>
no manner of notice of it, has effectually destroyed and overthrown it, by agreeing to Reduce the Duties on <HI>French</HI> Wines to an Equallity with the Wines of like quality from other Countries, which by consequence includes the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines which are of like quality with the <HI>French,</HI> and that therefore the <HI>Portugal</HI> Treaty is thereby actually broken, the Faith and Honour of the <HI>British</HI> Nation depreciated and forfeited, and that the Con∣sequence of it will be, that the <HI>Portuguese</HI> will prohibit our Woollen Manufactures, nay, per∣haps our whole Trade: Nay, some go farther, and alledge, that the Peace with <HI>Pottugal</HI> is actually broken by this Infraction, and that our Trade to <HI>Portugal,</HI> which is so Consider∣able and so Advantageous, will be entirely lost.</P>
<P>I believe the Gentlemen cannot say, but that I have done justice to their Allegations, and given their Objections their full length, and I hope they will allow me to do the like on the other Side.</P>
<P>The Advocates for the Treaty of Com∣merce alledge, <HI>First,</HI> That the Trade to <HI>Por∣tugal</HI> stands upon other Foundarions, that the Treaty of Commerce with <HI>France</HI> will have very little Influence upon it one way or other; That it is true, the Importation of Wine from <HI>Portugal</HI> will lessen, tho' it is apparent that Importation will be greater many ways than ever it was before: But that our Exportation of Woollen Manufa∣ctures to <HI>Portugal</HI> was ever very great, even
<PB N="24" REF="23" MS="y"/>
before the War, when the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines made no figure at all in the Trade, and were not in all above 2 or 300 Ton in a Year; That the Encrease of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade in these late years, did not take its rise from our De∣mand of their Wines, and consequently will not feel any sensible decay or decrease, tho' we were never to take any more Wine of them.</P>
<P>They farther alledge, That the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines will not be so greatly run down by the <HI>French</HI> Wine as was formerly, the humour of our Nation running all upon strong Wines for these several years; so that it is observe∣able, that no <HI>French</HI> Wines are now in esteem but the Rich high-priz'd Clarets, <HI>Puntacks,</HI> and such like; That the price of their strong∣est <HI>French</HI> Wines is always high, and their quantity but small; That the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wine will be bought at least Ten or Twelve Pound <HI>per</HI> Ton Cheaper than those Rich <HI>French</HI> Wines, and will be always wanted to make the Smaller <HI>French</HI> Wines Stronger, and the Pale <HI>French</HI> Wine Deeper, as was always the Case when the Trade was open, on occasion of a bad Vintage in <HI>France</HI>; That altho' the Treaty with <HI>France</HI> does not preserve the Inequality of the Duty between the <HI>Portugal</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Wine, so as to give the Ad∣vantage to the first, as was designed by the <HI>Portuguese</HI>; yet that the Inequality of the Price will always be an equivalent to it, the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines being never bought at above 12<HI>l. per</HI> Ton, one with another; whereas
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
these say, that the other Party have Printed, that the <HI>French</HI> Wine shall always Cost 25<HI>l. per</HI> Ton in <HI>France</HI> after the Peace.</P>
<P>Thus far they argue as to the Trade: As to the justice of Breaking the Treaty with <HI>Portu∣gal,</HI> that is a Case by it self; the People who are for the <HI>French</HI> Commerce, answer that part, by falling upon the Treaty it self, and upon the People that made it; They say, it is a Treaty Inconsistent with the Constitution of <HI>Britain</HI> in its nature, and therefore is not to be kept, but is void of Course, and by the Con∣sequence of things; That he who made it, had he not been gone to answer it in another World, ought to have answer'd for it at the Bar of the House of Lords, and ought to have been Im∣peached of High Treason.</P>
<P>They alledge that this Treaty Limits the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> by the Preroga∣tive of the Crown, stipulating, That the Parliament shall not lay on any higher Duties than such and such mentioned in that Article, Pretending that a private Transaction of a Minister or Ambassador shall be binding, and and Consequently Superiour to the Parliament; and that it is in the Power of an Ambassador to tell the Parliament what Taxes they shall not Lay, and by the same Rule may tell them what they shall Lay, which is a Power destructive to the Being and Nature of Par∣liaments, and cannot be done; That the Par∣liament has alone the Power to Determin what Duties shall, or shall not, be Lay'd upon the Exportations and Importations of Mer∣chandizes,
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
as well as upon any other things, and no Invasion, that shall be made, or at∣tempted to be made, upon that Power, can be binding to the People of <HI>England</HI>; that on this Account, it cannot be any Injustice, or any Illegal Act for the Parliament to confirm any other Treaty, which shall Contravene or Rescind that Treaty.</P>
<P>Again, they add, That the Treaty carries, in the Body of it, an express Supposition, That the Parliament may see Reason to Con∣travene, Break, or Rescind it, and therefore makes Provision for such an Incident in a Clause, which determins what it shall be Lawful for the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> to do, if the said Treaty should be broken.</P>
<P>This they alledge also, amounts to an Ex∣press Stipulation, That the Breach of this Traty, shall not be esteem'd a Breach of the Peace between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI>; for that when it says particularly, what it shall be Lawful for the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> to do upon such a Breach, it strongly implies, That it shall not be Lawful for him to take any other measures in that Case, or carry his Re∣sentment any farther than to the Prohibition of such and such Goods, as were Prohibited before.</P>
<P>Another Debate arises also from this sup∣posed Infraction of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Treaty, by the new Treaty of Commerce with <HI>France,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) That one Party alledges, That it is expresly said, in case the <HI>English</HI> do not per∣form their part, it shall be Lawful for the King
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
of <HI>Portugal</HI> to Prohibit the Woollen Cloth, <HI>caeteris{que} Lanificia,</HI> and the rest of the <HI>British</HI> Woollen Manufactures.</P>
<P>The Advocates for the Treaty Object, That tho' it is true, that the Words of the Trea∣ty do express it, in that manner, <HI>caeteris{que} Lanificia</HI>; yet that the Word <HI>Rursus</HI> Again, explains the meaning of it, That it shall be Lawful for the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> Again to Prohibit, can signify nothing of the <HI>British</HI> Woollen Manufactures, but what was Prohi∣bited before.</P>
<P>Then it remains to examine, what <HI>British</HI> Woollen Manufactures were Prohibited be∣fore. One side affirms, that no more were formerly Prohibited, but the <HI>English</HI> Woollen Cloths, and challenges the other to name, what other Woollen Manufactures were Pro∣hibited, which indeed they have not done, contenting themselves to affirm, that there were other Woollen Manufactures Prohibited in <HI>Portugal,</HI> without saying what they were.</P>
<P>The Truth of this Case, is indeed, some∣thing different, from what either Party pre∣tend to. There were indeed several Pragma∣ticks, as the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call them, Published, as I take it, in the Years 1688, 1692, and 1697, and in other Years, which were made to prevent the People of <HI>Portugal</HI> running into the new Fashions, and change of Habits, according to the Customs of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Britain</HI>; in order to which, I say those Pragmaticks were made to forbid, not the Importing only, but wearing any of the medly or mixt
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
Cloths of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> or any other Country.</P>
<P>Whether the Words, <HI>caeteris{que} Lanificia,</HI> were in those Pragmaticks or no, does not appear; neither have any side Quoted, Co∣pied, or Translated, either, or any of those Pragmaticks, to shew whether it was or not. On the other hand, it is certain, that the <HI>Portuguese</HI> did never refuse to admit the Importation of any of our Woollen Manu∣factures into <HI>Portugal,</HI> upon any pretence whatsoever, except the said Medly Cloths; and this, I think, without being partial to either side, I may take for an Assurance, that they were not Prohibited.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Nature of the Trade between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> is such, that altho' this Breach of the Clause should hap∣pen, yet it does not seem, that the Circum∣stances of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> would at all admit them to prohibit Commerce with <HI>England,</HI> or to Prohibit the Woollen Manufactures in general, as some People suggest, and that on several Accounts; I shall name but three, as I said before, because I shall not make these Tracts, which are design'd to be Historical chiefly, meddle at all with the Controversy on either side.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Because tho' we may not take off so great a quantity of their Wines as we did before, yet that we should still take off a very great quantity, and which it would be very well worth their while to dispose of.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="29" REF="28"/>2. That <HI>England</HI> is the only Market they have in the World, not for their Wines on∣ly, but for the other capital Produce of their Country, such as Oil and Fruit, which if they should Prohibit a Trade with us, they could by no means find a vent for in any other Nation; the <HI>Dutch</HI> taking off but very few of them, and the <HI>French</HI> none at all.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That they are not able to carry on their Trade to <HI>Brasils,</HI> which is now encreased to such a prodigious Degree, as from Eighteen or Twenty Two Sail of Ships to a Hundred and Forty Sail, neither without our Manu∣factures, or without the stocks of our Mer∣chants, who sell the greatest part of their Goods, to the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Merchants, to be paid at the return of the Fleet from the <HI>Brasils.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Upon the whole, I think however warm they are on both Sides in that part of the Quarrel, they Err in this, That they repre∣sent the <HI>English</HI> Trade to be much more at the Mercy of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> than it really is; or than consists with the Honour and Repu∣tation of the <HI>British</HI> Trade to have it be.</P>
<P>If our Manufactures were not necessary to the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> they could not be induced to take off such a very great quantity yearly as they do, by the Argument of our taking off their Wines; for the utmost value of the Wines being not above Seventy or Eighty Thousand Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> and the Export of our Woollen Manufactures amounting, as
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
some say, to Eight Hundred Thousand, and as others, to a Million of Pounds Sterling a year to <HI>Portugal,</HI> they would never make the taking off of Eight Hundred Thousand Pounds in Wines, which is our part, be the Cause of their taking off a Million from us, which is their part, and pay the Nine Hun∣dred and Twenty Thousand Pound in Specie to procure it; this, I say, does not seem ra∣tional.</P>
<P>But the true state of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade stands thus: Upon the late Treaty with <HI>Portugal,</HI> their King perceiving that by our prohibiting the Importation of <HI>French</HI> Wine, our de∣mand for his Country Wines was mightily encreased, and that the Profit to his Subjects was exceeding Great, by Planting more Vine∣yards, and Encreasing the Vallue of the Lands, and by Consequence of his Revenue; and likewise foreseeing, that when-ever the <HI>French</HI> Trade should be opened again, that Demand for <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines would fall again, Contriv'd to bring the <HI>English</HI> into a Treaty of Inequallity of Custom, in favour of his Wines against the <HI>French, one third part,</HI> as by the Article quoted already appears; the Equiva∣lent for this Favour was the taking off the Prohibition upon our Woollen Mixt Cloth, as aforesaid; but it does by no means stand with the Circumstances of the King of <HI>Por∣tugal</HI>'s Subjects, or the Nature of their Com∣merce, that if this Article cannot be pre∣serv'd, he should stop a Commerce, by which all the rest of the Produce of his Country
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
should be carried off and consum'd; this would ruin the whole Commerce of his Kingdom, and be ten fold more Disadvantage to him one way, than it would be Advantage to him another.</P>
<P>Again, the quantity of <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines Imported hither, take them one year with another, have been about Seven Thousand Ton a year; this cannot be entirely sunk, and I believe, if all was to happen that can happen by the Treaty, there cannot be less Imported into <HI>England,</HI> than one half of that quantity, the People being, as was noted above, en∣clin'd so much to strong Wines, that the <HI>French</HI> Trade cannot fully Answer their de∣mand, and all the small thin Wines of <HI>Anjou,</HI> and the Banks of <HI>Loir,</HI> will now, probably, be little worth; so that the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines cannot be supposed to sink above one half; or suppose it may be about Four Thousand Ton, which is Forty Thousand Pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> at Ten Pound <HI>per</HI> Ton, which Ten Pound <HI>per</HI> Ton in time of Peace, and open Trade, will be the top of the Market. Now it does not seem rational to me, I say, <HI>to Me, for I speak my private Opinion,</HI> That the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> should quarrel with <HI>England,</HI> Pro∣hibit our Trade, put a stop to a current Demand of a Million <HI>per Annum</HI> Import, which pays him a very great Revenue, put a stop to the Consumption of all the other Growth of his Country which we take off, such as Oil, Shumack, Figs, Salt, Fruit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Salt excepted, no Nation but the
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
<HI>English</HI> can take those Goods off, and all this for want of our taking Forty Thousand Pounds worth of Wine.</P>
<P>Add to this, That by this Method he would hinder the <HI>English</HI> taking off the re∣maining quantity of Wines also, which would be very considerable, and by the Calculation above, amounts to Forty Thousand Pounds more; and so thro' us, quite out of the Chan∣nel of <HI>Port</HI> Wine, which, as it is now, the Draft will not easily be altered, and the Advantage of the Consumption is so much the Interest of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> to preserve, that no one can suppose they would be so weak, as to throw it away, without suffi∣cient Ground.</P>
<P>For these Reasons, I cannot see room to think, That suppose the worst, nay, supposing all the Consequences which People fear as to the <HI>French</HI> Trade interfering with the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI>; yet it not does seem reasonable to think, that the <HI>Portuguese</HI> will Prohibit any part of the <HI>English</HI> Trade, much less the whole <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Trade, of which I shall speak hereafter.</P>
<P>In this posture, the State of the Dispute seems to stand, and as every one is left to determine in favour of those who they ap∣prove most; so I shall not engage against one Side or other, but Modestly and Calmly give my Thoughts upon the whole.</P>
<P>It were to be wish'd, that Party and Pas∣sion were left out of these Debates. Our Trade is an Essential Article, upon which the Felicity of the Nation very much de∣pends,
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
and which must many ways receive an injury by these Obstructions; nay, the very Debating these things, awakens the Enemies of our Commerce, and lets them into some parts of the Dispute, which they should rather be Ignorant of than know: <HI>For Example,</HI> <LIST>
<ITEM>1. While one Paper makes a very great stir, and lays a vast Weight upon the <HI>French</HI> falling upon our Manufactures, publishes how easie it is for them to get away all our Trade, how they Work Cheaper, and perform their Work as well as the <HI>English,</HI> and that they are able, not only to supply themselves, but all the rest of the World, nay, that they could come in upon us, and Under-sell us at our own Doors; while they do thus, I say, they do an irreparable Injury to their own Country.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. On the other hand, While the oppo∣site Paper publishes, the great Advantages of our Nation in the Treaty, over the <HI>French,</HI> and how it is in our hands, to make the <HI>French</HI> Trade be to the Gain of the <HI>English</HI> Nation so many Thousand Pounds a Year. This is alarming the <HI>French,</HI> and telling them we have made Fools of them in the Treaty, by which we set them to Work to retrieve it by all possible Methods; and perhaps, at last, to find some shift to get out of the Noose, and turn the Advantage against us; things they are very dexterous in doing.</ITEM>

<P><PB N="34" REF="33"/>To descend a little farther in these Parti∣culars, and Discourse them Impartially, with∣out Reflecting either on one Party or another, It is my Judgment, that the Extremes on both these Sides, are very destructive at this time to the General Interest of Trade in <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>There is no question to be made, but the preserving the Woollen Manufacture in <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI> to be, as it ever was since we were first Masters of it, OUR OWN, Exclusive of all other Nations in the World, is our great Concern, our true Interest, and is what the Wealth and Prosperity of this Nation really depends upon.</P>
<P>There is no question to be made, but every Nation round us, who are capable to make any Progress in such an Attempt, will en∣deavour as much as in them lies, to imi∣tate us, in a thing so prodigiously Gainful: The <HI>Dutch</HI> do it, the <HI>Flemmings</HI> have always done it, and the <HI>French</HI> have been now above Seventy Year, making gradual steps in it.</P>
<P>What indefatigable, restless Industry, what Severe Application, what all possible Encou∣ragement from their Government, what their own necessity, which is the Spring of Inven∣tion, is able to do: This is not wanting, nor has been wanting in <HI>France,</HI> during the long Reign of the most Politick and Potent Prince <HI>France</HI> ever knew, and they do all a Na∣tion in their Circumstances can do, to come to a Perfection in the Woollen Manufactures.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34"/>But they Labour under insuperable Difficul∣ties, and struggle with invincible Obstacles, which smother the Flame of their Industry, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the want of Wooll; this is the main Case, and as Nature has it not, the Soil, the Clime does not produce it, they, by con∣sequence, cannot have it, but by the supply from us; nor are they wanting in their Ap∣plication to get the Wooll from us, in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in <HI>England,</HI> they Rummage, e∣very Creek, and every Corner, run all Risques, Buy, Bribe, Fetch and Carry, do all that desperate Dilligence can do to get our Wooll, and too much Success they have in their endeavour.</P>
<P>But when all is done that can be done, the Wooll they get cannot be a quantity suitable to the Demand, or sufficient to carry on a National Manufacture; and also it must be dearer by much than our Manufacturers have it at Home; the Expence, the Hazard, the Hands employ'd, the Freights, the Losses, all go into the Price of that which arives, and is made use of; then the Carriage when Land∣ed, for Conveying it to Remote Places; this all adds to the Price, and is a damp upon the Manufactures, which it is not possible to avoid, and which must necessarily give the great Ad∣vantage to our People, who have the Wooll at their own Doors.</P>
<P>I cannot doubt, but our Government, may in time find out some better Method, than is yet put in practice, for the restraining this Export of Wooll, and for the putting a check
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
upon the <HI>French</HI> Manufactures the most sensi∣ble way; for nothing is more evedent, than that if the <HI>English</HI> Wooll were effectually kept at Home, the <HI>French</HI> could never go on with their Manufacturing to any considerable degree, and the Government cannot but think it for the publick Service to have all possible assi∣stance to that purpose.</P>
<P>It is not the Business of this Tract, to en∣quire, what are the especial Grievances of this Article, and why a Nation, to whose Interest it is so essential to prevent the Exportation of their Wooll, should at the same time have the Laws for that purpose so ill Executed, as that in almost every part of the Kingdom the Wooll is carried Abroad, not with allowance, <HI>we cannot say that,</HI> but with an open Violence, and even sometimes by Force and Blood, se∣veral Murthers, Fightings, and Breakings of the Peace, having hapned upon this Occasion in many Parts: As if the <HI>French</HI> were come to that pass, either of Insolence in Dealing with us, or necessity of their own Side, that they were resolved to fetch away our Wooll by Force; to this end they make little Descents and Invasions upon us, such I may rightly call them, for the carrying off our Wooll, Arm'd either with Money to draw, or Wea∣pons to drive those, who, in Discharge of their Duty and Office, appear to oppose them. This is so well known, that I need not enter into Particulars, or enquire, where, when, and in what manner it is done.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36"/>It is sufficient to say by way of Com∣plaint, That the Exportation of Wooll from Her Majesty's Dominions is now so great, that unless some speedy method be taken to redress this Grievance, and to put a stop to it, we may soon shake hands with our Foreign Trade, and see our Neighbours rivalling our Manufactures in a manner, which otherwise they could not hope to do.</P>
<P>There are four Vents by which our Wooll is now Unhappily carried out of the Country, (<HI>viz.</HI>) 1. <HI>Rumney-Marsh,</HI> &amp;c. on the Coast of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> which has been the Place made famous for many Years for that Wicked Trade, and where it was carried on, even during all the late War, with a Correspon∣dence, like that of a Neutrality, as if the In∣habitants of <HI>Normandy</HI> and <HI>Kent</HI> had made a Cessation, or were two Neutral Nations, not concern'd in the War on either side; and as in the time of War, that corrupt Commerce was carried on, tho' not to so great a Degree as formerly, so much more now the Peace is made, is it renewed to a Degree equal to whatever it was before the War.</P>
<P>Next to this, is the Coast of <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> where the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as in the other parts, the <HI>French,</HI> practice the same thing, and have done so for a long time, tho' never with so Open and Bare-fac'd a Confederacy as they do now, and where the <HI>French</HI> Boats have found the way to share with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as a Coast, altho' farther off from their own, yet where they are not in Danger of the Cruisers and Custom-House
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
Vessels, who are employ'd on the Coast of <HI>Sussex,</HI> on purpose to seize them at Sea.</P>
<P>But here, as soon as the said Wooll is on Board, they are Safe, and bending their Course directly over for <HI>Holland,</HI> they keep along that Shore to <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> as they see Occasion.</P>
<P>I may in time, enter upon a more particular Enquiry into this part of that Corrupt Trade, and how it is managed on Shore, to the En∣riching a few private Men, but to the Impo∣verishing the Nation; and which, if it be not prevented, will, in a few Years, make a visi∣ble Alteration in the Face of our Trade.</P>
<P>The next Outlet for our Wooll has been in <HI>Scotland</HI>: Before the Union of the two Kingdoms, the Exportation of their Wooll was free and allowed by their Law; and al∣beit, their own Wooll was not so much de∣sired in <HI>France,</HI> as being too Coarse for their Manufactures; yet they found a great Market for it in several parts of <HI>France,</HI> for their meaner sort of Goods. But this was not all, as the Border of <HI>Scotland,</HI> adjoyning to <HI>England,</HI> was extended a great way from <HI>Berwick</HI> to <HI>Calisle,</HI> for above Sixty Miles, it was not possible to keep the Passages so well guarded, but that great quantities of <HI>English</HI> Wooll were frequently, and almost daily, carried in Horse Packs, by private ways into <HI>Scotland:</HI> In this Work they were generally so well at∣tended, that altho' it was often discovered, by the Officers, yet they could not, without
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
more assistance seize upon it; and before such assistance could be procur'd, the Drivers of the Wooll, would get their Horses over the Border, when the Officers, altho' they stood in view, had no more Power to act; so that by this means the quantity of <HI>English</HI> Wooll Exported into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and from thence into <HI>France,</HI> was very great, nor was there any way to pre∣vent it.</P>
<P>After the Union, the same Laws of Trade taking place in both Countries, the Wooll could no more be Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> but by Stealth: But the Laws of that kind being very difficult to be Executed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by Reason of the innumerable Number of Creeks and Coves along that Coast, the small Num∣ber of Officers, their remote Stations from one another, their small Salaries, little En∣couragement, and the easyness of carrying the Wooll unsuspected to the Sea Coast; the Exportation of Wooll, is now carri∣ed on in that Country to an extravagant De∣gree, and it is not easy to prevent the same.</P>
<P>The last Article of this kind is <HI>Ireland,</HI> and here indeed, Wooll, seems to be one of the Principle Commodities of the Country. They Export it to <HI>France,</HI> not as if it was Prohibited, but rather as if it was the allowed Traffick of the Place: Whole Ships are Freighted with it, they are known when at Sea, by their being so light in their Loading; and our Sailors say to one another as they pass them at Sea, <HI>There goes an</HI> Irish <HI>OƲLER.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39"/>This is farther Demonstrable, from the strange Change that is made in the Face of the <HI>Irish</HI> Trade, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That whereas they crowded in their Wooll so fast upon us in <HI>England,</HI> that our People com∣plain'd of the Glut of <HI>Irish</HI> Wooll, and that it sunk the Price of our own Wooll, which for want of a Trade, lay much on our Hand; now for these two Years past, the case is quite changed, and the <HI>Irish</HI> Wooll is not to be had for Money.</P>
<P>What can be the Reason of this? We know the quantity is not Diminshed, nor is the Trade Encreased, that <HI>Ireland</HI> can Manufacture it at Home, and so cannot spare it for Exportation, that would be good news for <HI>Ireland</HI>; but the Truth of the Case is what I am upon above, <HI>viz.</HI> That the quantity goes off another way, the Channel is turn'd, they have a Secret Vent to <HI>France,</HI> and there goes away the Wooll.</P>
<P>No Man need seek any farther for a Reason why, or an Account how, the <HI>French</HI> came to be Arrived at so great a Perfection in our Manu∣factures, and to make such great quantities as it is said they do; here is the true Reason, and till this be prevented, it will never be otherwise; whereas, if the stream of Wooll were stopt from <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> which are the Fountains, the <HI>French</HI> would never be in any Condition to do us any considerable Damage of that kind; for they really have not the Materials, they have not Wooll, neither can any part of the World supply them.</P>
<P>The next Tract of this Kind, shall enquire far∣ther into this part of Trade, and make some Essay at a Method to prevent, at least lessen, the Exportation of our Wooll, so as that the <HI>French</HI> shall not be able to break in upon our Trade; and then if the new Treaty of Commerce does really, as its Defenders alledge, open the Door of Trade, by taking off the Impositions upon the <HI>English</HI> Woollen Manufactures in <HI>France,</HI> it may be a means to recover our Trade in <HI>France,</HI> and render all the Attempts of Manufacturing in <HI>France,</HI> A¦bortive and Ineffectual.</P>
