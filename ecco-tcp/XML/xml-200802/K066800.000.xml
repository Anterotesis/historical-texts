<HEAD><HI>MUSAEUS:</HI> A MONODY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SOrrowing I catch the reed, and call the muse;</L>
<L>If yet a muse on Britain's plain abide,</L>
<L>Since rapt MUSAEUS tun'd his parting strain:</L>
<L>With him they liv'd, with him perchance they dy'd.</L>
<L>For who e'er since their virgin train espy'd,</L>
<L>Or on the banks of Thames, or that mild plain,</L>
<L>Where Isis sparkles to the sunny ray?</L>
<L>Or have they deign'd to play,</L>
<L>Where Camus winds along his broider'd vale,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="3"/>Feeding each white pink, and each daisie pied,</L>
<L>That mingling paint his rushy-fringed side?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet ah! coelestial maids, ye are not dead;</L>
<L>Immortal as ye are, ye may not die:</L>
<L>And well I ween, ye cannot quite be fled,</L>
<L>E'er ye entune his mournful elegy.</L>
<L>Stay then awhile, O stay, ye fleeting fair;</L>
<L>Revisit yet, nor hallow'd Hippocrene,</L>
<L>Nor Thespia's shade; till your harmonious teen</L>
<L>Be grateful pour'd in some slow-dittied air.</L>
<L>Such tribute paid, again ye may repair</L>
<L>To what lov'd haunt you whilom did elect;</L>
<L>Whether Lycaeus, or that mountain fair</L>
<L>Trim Maenalus, with piny verdure deckt.</L>
<L>But now it boots you not in these to stray,</L>
<L>Or yet Cyllene's hoary shade to chuse,</L>
<L>Or where mild Ladon's welling waters play.</L>
<L>Forego each vain excuse,</L>
<L>And haste to Thames's shores; for Thames shall join</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="4"/>Our sad society, and passing mourn,</L>
<L>Letting cold tears bedew his silver urn.</L>
<L>And, when the poet's widow'd grot he laves,</L>
<L>His reed-crown'd locks shall shake, his head shall bow,</L>
<L>His tide no more in eddies blith shall rove,</L>
<L>But creep soft by with long-drawn murmurs slow.</L>
<L>For oft the poet rous'd his charmed waves</L>
<L>With martial notes, or lull'd with strain of love.</L>
<L>He must not now in brisk maeanders flow</L>
<L>Gamesome, and kiss the sadly-silent shore,</L>
<L>Without the loan of some poetic woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can I forget, how erst his osiers made</L>
<L>Sad sullen music, as bleak Eurus fann'd?</L>
<L>Can I forget, how gloom'd yon laureat shade,</L>
<L>E'er death remorseless wav'd his ebon wand?</L>
<L>How, midst yon grot, each silver trickling spring</L>
<L>Wander'd the shelly channels all among;</L>
<L>While as the coral roof did softly ring,</L>
<L>Responsive to their sweetly-doleful song.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="5"/>Meanwhile all pale th' expiring poet laid,</L>
<L>And sunk his awful head,</L>
<L>While vocal shadows pleasing dreams prolong;</L>
<L>For so, his sick'ning spirits to release,</L>
<L>They pour'd the balm of visionary peace.</L>

<L>When flow'ry fiction held the place of truth;</L>

<L>"Unmov'd by sophistry, unaw'd by name,</L>
<L>"No dupe to doctrines, and no fool to fame;</L>
<L>"Led by no system's devious glare astray,</L>

<L>"And this great truth in all its lustre shew'd,</L>

<L>If this his boast, pour here the welcome lays;</L>
<L>"Praise less than this is impotence of praise."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"To pour that praise be mine," fair VIRTUE cry'd;</L>
<L>And shot, all radiant, thro' an op'ning cloud.</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="17"/>But ah! my Muse, how will thy voice express</L>
<L>Th' immortal strain, harmonious, as it flow'd?</L>
<L>Ill suits immortal strain a doric dress:</L>
<L>And far too high already hast thou soar'd.</L>
<L>Enough for thee, that, when the lay was o'er,</L>
<L>The goddess clasp'd him to her throbbing breast.</L>
<L>But what might that avail? Blind Fate before</L>
<L>Had op'd her shears, to slit his vital thread;</L>
<L>And who may hope gainsay her stern behest?</L>
<L>Then thrice he wav'd the hand, thrice bow'd the head,</L>
<L>And sigh'd his soul to rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then wept the Nymphs; witness, ye waving shades!</L>
<L>Witness, ye winding streams! the Nymphs did weep:</L>
<L>The heav'nly Goddess too with tears did steep</L>
<L>Her plaintive voice, that echo'd thro' the glades;</L>
<L>And, "cruel gods," and, "cruel stars," she cry'd:</L>
<L>Nor did the shepherds, thro' the woodlands wide,</L>
<L>On that sad day, or to the pensive brook,</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="18"/>Or stagnant river, drive their thirsty flocks;</L>
<L>Nor did the wild-goat brooze the steepy rocks:</L>
<L>And Philomel her custom'd oak forsook;</L>
<L>And roses wan were wav'd by zephyrs weak,</L>
<L>As Nature's self was sick;</L>
<L>And ev'ry lilly droop'd its velvet head;</L>
<L>And groan'd each faded lawn, and leafless grove:</L>
<L>Sad sympathy! yet sure his rightful meed,</L>
<L>Who charm'd all nature: well might Nature mourn</L>
<L>Thro' all her sweets; and flow'r, and lawn, and shade,</L>
<L>All vocal grown, all weep MUSAEUS dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here end we, Goddess! this your shepherd sang,</L>
<L>All as his hands an ivy chaplet wove.</L>
<L>O! make it worthy of the sacred bard,</L>
<L>And make it equal to the shepherd's love.</L>
<L>Nor thou, MUSAEUS! from thine ear discard,</L>
<L>For well I ween thou hear'st my doleful song:</L>
<L>Whether 'mid angel troops, the stars among,</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="19"/>From golden harp thou call'st seraphic lays;</L>
<L>Or, anxious for thy dearest Virtue's fare,</L>
<L>Thou still art hov'ring o'er our tuneless sphere,</L>
<L>And mov'st some hidden spring her weal to raise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus the fond swain on doric oate essay'd,</L>
<L>Manhood's prime honours downing on his cheek:</L>
<L>Trembling he strove to court the tuneful maid</L>
<L>With stripling arts, and dalliance all too weak;</L>
<L>Unseen, unheard, beneath an hawthorn shade.</L>
<L>But now dun clouds the welkin 'gan to streak;</L>
<L>And now down-dropt the larks, and ceas'd their strain:</L>
<L>They ceas'd, and with them ceas'd the shepherd swain.</L>
