<P>THE following may more properly be termed a Com∣pilation than a Poem. It was prepared for the Composer in little more than two days; and may therefore rather be considered as an industrious Effort of Gratitude than of Genius.</P>
<P>In justice to the Composer it may likewise be right to inform the Public, that the Music was adapted in a period of time equally short.</P>

<L>THE praise attending pomp and power,</L>
<L>The incense given to kings,</L>
<L>Are but the trappings of an hour,</L>
<L>Mere transitory things!</L>
<L>The base bestow them; but the good agree</L>
<L>To spurn the venal gifts as flattery.—</L>
<L>But when to pomp, and power, are join'd</L>
<L>An equal dignity of mind;</L>
<L>When titles are the smallest claim;</L>

<L>Request to be forgiven!</L>
<L>Alas! they never had thy hate;</L>
<L>Unmoved in conscious rectitude</L>
<L>Thy towering mind self-centered stood,</L>
<L>Nor wanted Man's opinion to be great.</L>
<L>In vain, to charm thy ravished sight,</L>
<L>A thousand gifts would fortune send;</L>
<L>In vain, to drive thee from the right,</L>
<L>A thousand sorrows urged thy end:</L>
<L>Like some well-fashion'd arch thy patience stood,</L>
<L>And purchased strength from its encreasing load.</L>
<L>Pain met thee like a friend that set thee free,</L>
<L>Affliction still is virtue's opportunity!</L>
<L>Virtue, on herself relying,</L>

<L>Yet let that wisdom, urged by her example,</L>
<L>Teach us to estimate what all must suffer:</L>
<L>Let us prize death as the best gift of nature,</L>

<L>The preparation is the executioner.</L>
<L>Death, when unmasked, shews me a friendly face,</L>

<L>For as the line of life conducts me on</L>
