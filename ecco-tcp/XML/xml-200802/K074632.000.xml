BOOK THE FIRST.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>CELESTIAL Maid! from genuine Science sprung!</L>
<L>Thee the pretended Sage, whose leaden eye</L>
<L>Inwrapt in metaphysic gloom, ne'er deigns</L>
<L>A cheerful smile, thee with contracted brow,</L>
<L>And haughty gesture, all his vassals shun:</L>
<L>While by the Graces drest Instruction owns</L>
<L>Thy guiding hand. Celestial maid attend!</L>
<L>Tho barren be the subject, o'er its' wilds</L>
<L>So may a verdure not their own be shed,</L>
<L>And blooming flowers. With me then turn thy sight</L>
<L N="11">On the prime Infant-state of helpless Man:</L>
<L>On the first dawn of life, when Nature now</L>
<L>Ushers her tender offspring into day;</L>
<L>Observe the young ideas how they wake</L>
<L>In gradual order, till at length matured</L>
<L>By time, they speak a living soul within.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
View too the transient flash of mirth; the ills</L>
<L>Not real, yet afflictive; the quick thought</L>
<L>For ever varying, glanced from toy to toy.</L>
<L N="20">Then constant motion pleases, then the ear</L>
<L>Catches at every sound, the eye untired</L>
<L>Darts its wild ray, and every object thrills</L>
<L>The new-born sense with joy. Come Virgin, teach</L>
<L>How on the government of these first years</L>
<L>Depends the future Man; no vulgar theme,</L>
<L>No fruitless task, experiencing thy aid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WE write to reason: Hence ye doating train</L>
<L>Of Midwives and of Nurses ignorant!</L>
<L>Old Beldames grey, in error positive,</L>
<L N="30">And stiff in prejudice, whose fatal care</L>
<L>Oft death attends, or a life worse than death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O YOUTH, whoe'er thou art, to beauty's charms</L>
<L>A slave, to all that inexpressive grace</L>
<L>Which native modesty and truth bestows</L>
<L>On their more beauteous minds, and which exalts</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
Britannia's Daughters o'er the female world!</L>
<L>Is thy Beloved propitious? Doth the god</L>
<L>Kindle his nuptial torch? And dost thou wish</L>
<L>The name of Father, amiable, humane?</L>
<L N="40">To view thy little Progeny around</L>
<L>Happy, well-formed, and strong? Attend the Muse:</L>
<L>Th' instructive Muse shall teach thee to obtain</L>
<L>Thy heart's desire. And say, wilt thou fair Nymph,</L>
<L>Complacent heed with favourable eye</L>
<L>The moral lay, refined and pure? To thee</L>
<L>Custom hath given, while active life shall call</L>
<L>Thy Husband forth amid its boist'rous walks,</L>
<L>Domestic rule: Thine is the nursery's charge;</L>
<L>Important trust! from him what absence hides,</L>
<L N="50">Thy constant anxious care shall well supply.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HEALTH is the greatest blessing Man receives</L>
<L>From bounteous Heaven; by her the smiling hours</L>
<L>Are wing'd with transport; she too gives the soul</L>
<L>Of firmness; without her the hand of toil</L>
<L>Would languid sink; the eye of reason fade.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
To this then bend thy care, O Parent Mind;</L>
<L>Array thy Child in health; a nobler dress</L>
<L>Not gorgeous Majesty can boast; the thanks</L>
<L>Of future gratitude thou wilt receive,</L>
<L N="60">More than around him from thy treasured hoard</L>
<L>Then showering sums profuse; or giving all</L>
<L>Thy herds, and bleating flocks; tho thousands range</L>
<L>Thy spacious meads, or cloath thy ample hills.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WOULD'ST thou thy children blest? The sacred voice</L>
<L>Of Nature calls thee; where she points the way</L>
<L>Tread confident. No labyrinth is here;</L>
<L>No clue of Ariadne wilt thou need,</L>
<L>To Theseus given; Fair is her open path,</L>
<L>And strong the steady light she casts around,</L>
<L N="70">Instinctive light, the surest safest guide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THY Child is born. See, where the treacherous nurse,</L>
<L>Or Priestess of Lucina, in her hand</L>
<L>The ready medicine brings! Forewarned, beware;</L>
<L>Within the fatal drug lurks death; by this</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Thousands from yet untasted life retire,</L>
<L>Thousands of infant souls; yet sanctified</L>
<L>By custom, other reasons are assign'd</L>
<L>And Nature is accused of impious deeds</L>
<L>She ne'er committed. Nature will preserve</L>
<L N="80">Whate'er she frames: and what the Child requires</L>
<L>In his new state, sagaciously provides,</L>
<L>Both food and remedy: Before the sun</L>
<L>Hath from his birth encircled half the sphere,</L>
<L>He asks, plain as expressive signs can ask,</L>
<L>The Mother's breast: Without a moment's pause</L>
<L>Hear the mute voice of instinct and obey.</L>
<L>Know the first efflux from the milky fount</L>
<L>Is Nature's chymic mixture, which no power</L>
<L>Of Art presumptuous can supply; this flows</L>
<L N="90">Gently detersive, purifying, bland;</L>
<L>This each impediment o'ercomes, and gives</L>
<L>The young, unfetter'd springs of life to play.</L>
<L>Hence too the Mother is secure: The streams</L>
<L>Her Infant's health promoting, flow to her</L>
<L>Salubrious; otherwise confined, or urged</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="9"/>
Back to their source, what evils may she dread!</L>
<L>Sickness, and giddy languor, shivering cold,</L>
<L>And heat alternate, dire obstructions, pangs</L>
<L>Of sharpest torture, cancers, by the juice</L>
<L N="100">Of boasted hemlock not to be removed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O MOTHER, (let me by that tenderest name</L>
<L>Conjure thee) still pursue the task begun;</L>
<L>Nor unless urged by strong necessity,</L>
<L>Some fated, some peculiar circumstance,</L>
<L>By which thy health may suffer, or thy child</L>
<L>Suck in disease, or that the genial food</L>
<L>Too scanty flows, give to an Alien's care</L>
<L>Thy orphan Babe. Oh! if by choice thou dost—</L>
<L>What shall I call thee? Woman? No, tho fair</L>
<L N="110">Thy face, and deckt with unimagined charms,</L>
<L>Tho sweetness seem pourtray'd in every line,</L>
<L>And smiles which might become a Hebe, rise</L>
<L>At will, crisping thy rosy cheeks, tho all</L>
<L>That's lovely, kind, attractive, elegant,</L>
<L>Dwell in thy outward shape, and catch the eye</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Of gazing rapture, all is but deceit;</L>
<L>The form of Woman's thine, but not the soul.</L>
<L>Had'st thou been treated thus, perchance the prey</L>
<L>Of death long since, no child of thine had known</L>
<L N="120">An equal lot severe. O unblown Flower!</L>
<L>Soft bud of Spring! Planted in foreign soil</L>
<L>How wilt thou prosper! Brush'd by other winds</L>
<L>In a new clime, and fed by other dews</L>
<L>Than suit thy Nature! From a stranger hand</L>
<L>Ah, what can Infancy expect, when she</L>
<L>Whose essence was inwove with thine, whose life,</L>
<L>Whose soul thou didst participate, neglects</L>
<L>Herself in thee, and breaks the strongest seal</L>
<L>Which Nature stamp'd in vain upon her heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="130">O LUCKLESS Babe, born in an evil hour!</L>
<L>Who shall thy numerous wants attend? explore</L>
<L>The latent cause of ill? thy slumbers guard?</L>
<L>And when awake, with nice sedulity</L>
<L>Thy every glance observe? A parent might;</L>
<L>A Hireling cannot; tho of blameless mind,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11"/>
Tho conscious duty prompt her to the task,</L>
<L>She feels not in her breast th' impulsive goad</L>
<L>Of instinct, all the fond, the fearful thoughts</L>
<L>Awakening: Say, at length that habit's power</L>
<L N="140">Can something like maternal kindness give,</L>
<L>Yet, ere that time, may the poor nursling die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BESIDES, who can assure the lacteal springs</L>
<L>Clear, and untained? Oft disorder lurks</L>
<L>Beneath the vivid bloom, and cheerful eye,</L>
<L>Promising health; and poisonous juice secrete,</L>
<L>Slow undermining life, stains what should be</L>
<L>The purest nutriment. Hence, worse than death,</L>
<L>Long years of misery to thy blasted child.</L>
<L>A burthen to himself, by others shunn'd,</L>
<L N="150">He wishes for the grave, and wastes his days</L>
<L>In solitary woe; or haply weds,</L>
<L>And propagates th' hereditary plague;</L>
<L>Entailing on his name the bitter curse</L>
<L>Of generations yet unborn, a race</L>
<L>Pithless, and weak, of faded texture, wan;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
Like some declining plant, with mildew'd leaves,</L>
<L>Whose root a treacherous insect gnaws unseen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT, whether lost in pleasure, in the round</L>
<L>Of modish life, and dissipation gay,</L>
<L N="160">Misnamed polite, the welfare of her child</L>
<L>The fair Barbarian looks on with an eye</L>
<L>Distant, and cold; or imitating her,</L>
<L>As faults of higher station always gain</L>
<L>Partial abettors, the neglected muse</L>
<L>Hath to the parent in life's middle rank</L>
<L>Tuned her unfructuous lay; she shall not cease</L>
<L>Desponding, weightier arguments for them,</L>
<L>More strenuous, more coercive she can bring,</L>
<L>To which perhaps self-interested love</L>
<L N="170">Will ope their listening sense. Of mental joys</L>
<L>And pure delight, they would not understand,</L>
<L>Or relish the description. But if health</L>
<L>They covet, nor before the genial prime</L>
<L>Wish the stern Fates to cut their vital thread,</L>
<L>Those hearts may prove susceptible of fear,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13"/>
Which instinct, love, and duty could despise.</L>
<L>Nor seek We fabled incidents, to strike</L>
<L>With superstitious dread the mind, but truth,</L>
<L>Plain, honest truth, inspires the homely song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="180">SHE who refuses to her Young One's lip</L>
<L>Her swelling bosom, each returning year</L>
<L>Conceives, and each returning year sustains</L>
<L>The pangs of child-birth. Harass'd by fatigue,</L>
<L>The strongest constitution droops; but soon</L>
<L>The weaker system, like a blighted flower,</L>
<L>Falls underneath the shock. The nursing time</L>
<L>Was meant by wisest Nature, as a stay,</L>
<L>A vacant interspace, in which the nerves,</L>
<L>And threads of life unstrung, might re-assume</L>
<L N="190">Their native tone, endued again with strength,</L>
<L>And corresponding freedom, to support</L>
<L>The day of toil: As a sure medicine,</L>
<L>To root out many an illness, else untamed,</L>
<L>From the soft female frame: T'invigorate</L>
<L>The fragile texture, and with grateful force</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
Astringe the fibres, morbid and relax'd.</L>
<L>But if not e'en these motives can persuade;</L>
<L>T' improve her charms, new beauties to possess,</L>
<L>Is Woman's utmost wish. View then the Fair,</L>
<L N="200">Who to this sweet employment turns her mind!</L>
<L>Delighted Health sits on her polish'd brow,</L>
<L>And shews the veins beneath? Spreads o'er her cheek</L>
<L>The vermil glow; her eyes with lustre fills;</L>
<L>Decks her with radiant smiles, and all her form</L>
<L>With grace ineffable, and comeliness</L>
<L>Invests. Enough of these—The Muse beholds</L>
<L>With rapture some of other kind—Oh! hail</L>
<L>Ye real Mothers! Ye whose hearts are full</L>
<L>Of sensibility! Who highly pleased,</L>
<L N="210">Would not, for all the gewgaws Pride can boast,</L>
<L>Loosen the magic knot, which joins in one</L>
<L>Your Babes and you; or see a Hireling share</L>
<L>The love, which to a Mother sole belongs.</L>
<L>O Thou, to whom, one of this pious train,</L>
<L>I with esteem and veneration bend!</L>
<L>Lead on with decent step, uncheck'd by fear,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="15"/>
To those domestic haunts, where peace expands</L>
<L>Her wings, and Harmony delighted dwells.</L>
<L>Let me behold thee, rivet thy fix'd eye</L>
<L N="220">On the young infant Form, then press it close,</L>
<L>Glose to thy throbbing heart, then on it's lips</L>
<L>A thousand kisses print, thy eyes with joy</L>
<L>O'erslowing, in each feature nicely scann'd</L>
<L>Tracing the dear resemblance of it's fire.</L>
<L>And lo! where pleased, beyond expression pleased,</L>
<L>To see thee in the sweetest task employ'd</L>
<L>Of female duty, where thy Husband hangs</L>
<L>Enamour'd o'er thy bosom! not the night</L>
<L>Which gave thee to his arms, bestow'd a joy</L>
<L N="230">To this superior; thrilling to the mind,</L>
<L>Sincere, and home-felt. O true name of love,</L>
<L>Tender Affection! Genuine Source of bliss</L>
<L>Immaculate, and pure! The transient blaze</L>
<L>Of passion soon subsides, thy steadier fire</L>
<L>Time but increases! Soft coercive band,</L>
<L>Connecting souls! Without thee, what is life!</L>
<L>Mild Halcyon of the breast, whose summer wing</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="16"/>
Calms every raging storm! To thee the wise,</L>
<L>The good still offer incense; all who bear</L>
<L N="240">No sordid stains; nor any but the dull,</L>
<L>Or grovelling, in her parsimonious mood</L>
<L>By nature form'd, or whom with iron hand</L>
<L>Tyrannic Custom rules, despise thy sway.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THRICE happy She, by inclination led,</L>
<L>By nought with-held, to add this pleasing link,</L>
<L>This heart-endearing bond, to the sweet ties</L>
<L>Of married love! But should'st thou e'er be doom'd</L>
<L>Votaress of truth and virtue, to resist</L>
<L>Th' attractive warmth by their eternal hands</L>
<L N="250">Implanted; to resist the liberal call</L>
<L>Of duty and desire; condemned by ails</L>
<L>From causes unforeseen to tear the Pledge</L>
<L>From thy fond bosom; while thy sickening heart</L>
<L>Bleeds at the thought, condemn'd another's care</L>
<L>T' invoke for him, the Babe, thy straining eyes</L>
<L>Gaze on with nameless pleasure: Let my lay</L>
<L>Direct thy choice for the momentous task</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="17"/>
Whom to retain, what Parent to adopt</L>
<L>For thy unconscious young one; for from her</L>
<L N="260">Not only nutriment perhaps he takes,</L>
<L>To life and growth subservient, but who knows</L>
<L>How far the stamina yet unevolved,</L>
<L>How far the soul herself as yet unformed,</L>
<L>For texture, vigour, passions, intellect,</L>
<L>On this thy act depend? Far from the bounds</L>
<L>Of the rank city, let some trusty Friend</L>
<L>Explore the straw-rooft cott; there, firm of nerve</L>
<L>Her blood from every grosser particle,</L>
<L>By hardy labour, and abstemious Fare,</L>
<L N="270">Sublimed; the honest peasant's mate shall ope</L>
<L>Her hospitable arms, receive with joy</L>
<L>The infant Stranger, and profusely yield</L>
<L>Her pure balsamic nurture to his lip.</L>
<L>But since the keenest eye may be deceived,</L>
<L>And vice will lurk amid the country haunts</L>
<L>To innocence devoted, it were meet</L>
<L>T' investigate among the village Tribe</L>
<L>Their Neighbour's mode of life. Heeds she the laws</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="18"/>
Of matron-like sobriety? Her fame,</L>
<L N="280">Is it from all suspicion clear? Her soul,</L>
<L>To wedlock true? Feels she a Parent's love?</L>
<L>To her own Offspring tenderly benign?</L>
<L>Does she her husband's constant heart possess?</L>
<L>Nor seeks he foreign pleasure? Every doubt</L>
<L>Extinguish'd here; still curiously persist,</L>
<L>Nor terminate thy search; examine round</L>
<L>Her little mansion, see if there, in spite</L>
<L>Of poverty, the step of cleanliness,</L>
<L>Attractive Nymph, unhesitating treads.</L>
<L N="290">Her age too claims thy notice; let not time</L>
<L>On restless wing have stolen from her face</L>
<L>The bloom -of youth, nor be she green in years.</L>
<L>For torpid, or impaired by frequent use,</L>
<L>The flexile vessels which convolved in maze</L>
<L>Wrapp'd within maze, secrete the purer stream,</L>
<L>Their office will more sparingly perform,</L>
<L>Or less nutritious particles supply.</L>
<L>And if thy nurse be young, the thoughtful mind</L>
<L>Of prudence, would not to her charge confide</L>
<L N="300"><PB N="18" REF="19"/>
What claims exactest assiduity,</L>
<L>And serious vigilance. There are who think</L>
<L>Too subtile in their theory, the Nurse</L>
<L>Should with the Mother aptly coincide</L>
<L>In age and temperament; but heeding well</L>
<L>The precepts we have given, thou may'st neglect</L>
<L>Such trivial niceness; Health from each extreme</L>
<L>Removed, is not to colour of the hair,</L>
<L>Or to complexion tinged with red or brown</L>
<L>Consined: Excess thou should'st indeed avoid</L>
<L N="310">Of plump or lean, nor would I choose th' adust</L>
<L>And highly bilious, or the sable hue</L>
<L>Of clouded melancholy. Be it then</L>
<L>Thy primal care to fix on vigorous health</L>
<L>Adorn'd with smiles, the lovely progeny</L>
<L>Of constant cheerfulness, and sweet content.</L>
<L>Nor would I (tho confest a quality</L>
<L>Inferior in it's kind) not prize the voice</L>
<L>From harshness free, whose soft tone can compose</L>
<L>The froward Babe, or gently bid it wake,</L>
<L>And view the young-eyed morn. O thou, who help'st</L>
<L N="321"><PB N="19" REF="20"/>
To throng the crowded Town, restrain'd by force</L>
<L>Within that court of death, where every gale</L>
<L>Is tainted with pollution; did the Muse</L>
<L>If some sad cause forbade thee to pursue</L>
<L>The Mother's genuine office, to the fields</L>
<L>Serene, and rural Lares order forth</L>
<L>Thy tender Infant? not from needless fears</L>
<L>And vain precaution, did she dare to thwart</L>
<L>The dictates of humanity. She sees,</L>
<L N="330">What do not to thy eye perhaps appear,</L>
<L>The dreadful train of ills, which swarm within</L>
<L>Th' unhallow'd precincts. Well she knows how few</L>
<L>Out of the many myriads city-born</L>
<L>Survive, in just proportion scann'd with those</L>
<L>Who bask in freer day. Yet, much avails</L>
<L>A Parent's unabating love, and sharp</L>
<L>Is absence to the soul. But can'st thou purge</L>
<L>Th' unwholesome atmosphere, gravid with seeds</L>
<L>Of latent sickness? Suffocation fell,</L>
<L N="340">Angina, Apthous Sores, Eruptions dire,</L>
<L>Pertussis sierce, and squalid Atrophy?</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="21"/>
Say, can'st thou bid the flagging South speed by,</L>
<L>Nor stagnant, o'er his much-loved mansion brood</L>
<L>With darkening plume, of poison and of death</L>
<L>Prolific? When each danger I review,</L>
<L>Shudd'ring with fear, I scarce would bid thee prove</L>
<L>The Nurse's task, tho nought should intervene</L>
<L>Of fatal accident, and thou art bound</L>
<L>By every tie of nature to the deed.</L>
<L N="350">For can'st thou round thy Infant's brow entwine</L>
<L>A magic wreath? Or cause an Angel lift</L>
<L>His shielding arm? Thou can'st not: Follow then</L>
<L>The precepts of experience; yet let oft</L>
<L>Maternal fondness guide thee to the place</L>
<L>Where rests the little sojourner, there view</L>
<L>How cherish'd, how improved, and lingering chide</L>
<L>The rapid step of still-progressive time,</L>
<L>Which hurries thee reluctantly away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT can the Mother change unblamed the town,</L>
<L N="360">For some sequester'd villa? What denies,</L>
<L>Her bed of sickness quitted, to retreat</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="22"/>
And seek the haunts, where Peace on flowers reclined</L>
<L>Lists to the warbling songster of the grove?</L>
<L>Or from the gently-rising hill surveys</L>
<L>The grazing herds, and rivulet which winds</L>
<L>Meand'ring thro the distant vale? Where Health</L>
<L>Sports on the level green, and young delight</L>
<L>Smiling attends: Where bounteous Nature sheds</L>
<L>Her choicest blessings, and with guardian wing</L>
<L N="370">Protects her favourite progeny. Retire,</L>
<L>My fair Disciple, haste to scenes like these,</L>
<L>And underneath thy roof invite to dwell</L>
<L>The Fosterer of thy child. Despise, with me,</L>
<L>Th' insipid train of vanity and pride;</L>
<L>The foppery of custom; quaint parade</L>
<L>Of ceremonial visit; idle farce</L>
<L>Of masquerade, or ball, where real joy</L>
<L>Ne'er entered; conversations gayly dull,</L>
<L>Unblest by exiled friendship; glare of courts;</L>
<L N="380">And mummery of the Great. Be't thine to walk</L>
<L>With Reason, and enjoy th' harmonious voice</L>
<L>Of conscious Rectitude, whose soothing strain</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="23"/>
Can lift the soul beyond what vulgar thought</L>
<L>Can distantly imagine. If thou must</L>
<L>Require another's aid thy place to fill,</L>
<L>Her conduct thou direct, and regulate</L>
<L>The manner of her life, a pleasure this</L>
<L>Inferior, yet affording ample room</L>
<L>To gratify the smer nerve of love.</L>
<L N="390">To see thy Substitute at stated times</L>
<L>The life-sustaining food supply, to mark</L>
<L>How thrives her young Dependent, and each day</L>
<L>Appears addition manifest to gain</L>
<L>In size and stature, while his eyes beam forth,</L>
<L>At least to Fancy's peering search, the dawn</L>
<L>Of future reason, and intelligence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HERE, as in all things, Nature opens wide</L>

WHAT aliment the tender Babe requires,</L>
<L>How best sustain'd, the Muse proceeds to sing.</L>
<L>To Nature then attend: She hath prepared</L>

<L>And will thy Infant cease to thrive, supplied</L>
<L>With this nepenthe? Rather He will gain</L>
<L>New vigour every hour, and healthful smile</L>
<L>Tho sickness scoul around. Yet some there are</L>
<L N="70">Who fill from morn to noon, from noon to eve,</L>
<L>Nay thro the hours of night, the suffering Child</L>
<L>With various cates, heedless of nature's lore,</L>
<L>Cruelly kind, unknowing that they thus</L>
<L>Fatten a victim for the hungry grave.</L>
<L>For from repletion, every ill severe</L>
<L>Which threatens childhood, arm'd with keener force,</L>

The Suckling should imbibe the milky stream,</L>

<L>YET when Night spreads her mantle o'er the Globe,</L>
<L>And leads on sleep and silence, it is meet</L>
<L>T' obey her mandate; rest thy careful head</L>
<L>O Mother, let thy tender Nurseling rest.</L>
<L>Why wilt Thou anxious to thyself create</L>
<L>Unnecessary pain? At evening close</L>
<L N="90">Forth from her den starts the fell Lioness,</L>
<L>And thro the gloomy desart urges on</L>
<L>Eager for prey her rapid step, She leaves</L>
<L>Her sleeping young one, nor expects he food</L>
<L>Till she return with morning's early beam.</L>
<L>Yet this is He, who shall hereafter reign</L>
<L>Lord of the forest, and with kingly voice</L>
<L>Appal his listening subjects. But thy heart</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="35"/>
Is soft, and cannot bear thy Infant's cries.</L>
<L>Oh! Heaven forbid that I should wish thy breast</L>
<L N="100">Steel'd to his real misery! But these</L>
<L>Are cries which evil custom hath begot,</L>
<L>And blind indulgence; unalarm'd sustain</L>
<L>A few short trials, bear unmoved the shock</L>
<L>At first; indulged not, He will fret no more.</L>
<L>Believe me, nor from hunger, nor from pain</L>
<L>These wailings spring. How different is the shriek,</L>
<L>And agonizing groan, from sobs like these,</L>
<L>Transient, and humorsome! To cloath thy Child</L>
<L>With health some little violence endure:</L>
<L N="110">Nor to the dictates plain of candid truth</L>
<L>Thy ancient Nurse's doating saws prefer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Stomach ever full, is ever weak:</L>
<L>But from refreshing sleep and abstinence</L>
<L>Digestion thrives, and kindliest nutriment</L>
<L>Th' absorbent veins inhale, wherewith the warm</L>
<L>And plastic arteries by due degrees</L>
<L>Upbuild the human fabric; or by which</L>

Each slender thread and fibre is evolved,</L>
<L>Gaining mysteriously their destined bulk</L>
<L N="120">And firm elastic motion. Robb'd of sleep</L>
<L>The Warrior droops his head, and longs no more</L>
<L>To plunge amid the fight: The Rustic faints</L>
<L>Vigorous e'erwhile, nor strains his sinewy arms</L>
<L>Holding the plough, but nerveless and unmann'd</L>
<L>Presses his homely pallet, sending forth</L>
<L>Vain wishes to the Power who from him flies.</L>
<L>And can the gentle frame of Woman bear</L>
<L>Constant disturbance and unrest? Her strength</L>
<L>Melts down apace, the bloom forsakes her cheeks,</L>
<L N="130">A peevish listlessness succeeds, she pines,</L>

<L>WOULD'ST Thou thy Child to pass the hours of night</L>
<L>Wrapt in sleep's downy plumage? Banish far</L>
<L>The lazy cradle, useless but to give</L>
<L>Relief to th' indolent attendant race,</L>
<L>Who fain would batten in perpetual sloth,</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="37"/>
Who shrink at slightest toil, and ill deserve</L>
<L>The viands they devour. At first indeed,</L>
<L N="140">During the circuit of a moon or twain</L>
<L>'Tis fit thy Charge should only eat and sleep;</L>
<L>Nature demands it. Afterward contract</L>
<L>The hours of sleep by day, and in th' embrace</L>
<L>Of carefulness let exercise divert</L>
<L>The lively Infant; chiefly when his eye</L>
<L>Now looks around unknowing what he sees,</L>
<L>Now when he springs, and spreads his little arms,</L>
<L>And smiles, and utters sounds which strike thine ear</L>
<L>With wondrous pleasure. Tho We now permit</L>
<L N="150">Some added food, its quality regard,</L>
<L>As of important consequence. We praise</L>
<L>Above the rest, the farinaceous tribe,</L>
<L>Bread well-fermented, unadulterate</L>
<L>With deleterious alum, this with milk</L>
<L>And with the limpid element decoct.</L>
<L>Yet always mindful of the golden mean,</L>
<L>Be even this with moderation used,</L>
<L>Nor ever glut the stomach till it loathes,</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="38"/>
And the superfluous aliment rejects.</L>
<L N="160">The wrinkled Sibyl laugh to scorn, and all</L>
<L>Her dreams fallacious, when pronouncing this</L>
<L>A sign of health. Nature indeed is kind,</L>
<L>And various her attempts t' evacuate</L>
<L>What would be noxious, and 'tis well thy Child</L>
<L>Hath still sufficing strength. But he, poor Babe,</L>
<L>Had he the sense to guide his appetite,</L>
<L>Would shun this consequence of mere excess,</L>
<L>No proof of health, disgustful to the eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WE blame thee not for yielding to the voice</L>
<L N="170">Of Error; if beneath the solemn garb</L>
<L>Of old experience hid, and self-convinced,</L>
<L>Not meaning to deceive, how should thy young</L>
<L>Untutor'd mind resist her lore? But when</L>
<L>Truth meets thy sight, and pointing shews the way</L>
<L>To Nature's bower, thy blind associate quit,</L>
<L>Enter the hallow'd shade, converse with her</L>

<L>Where light ne'er penetrates, but Darkness sits</L>
<L>In fixt essential majesty enthroned,</L>
<L>Unconscious Sloth, by Ignorance compress'd,</L>

With Superstition dwelt the Pest abhorr'd;</L>
<L>And underneath her hieroglyphic veil</L>

<L>And why is reason thine, if not with care</L>
<L>To govern him whose yet unripen'd frame</L>
<L>Of sense is vacant? Tho with greater ease,</L>

<L>The ferment of acidity, to which</L>

BOOK THE THIRD.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AGAIN from busy care, from thoughts which prey</L>
<L>On the reflecting mind, from the rank walks</L>
<L>Of Men, where folly dwells, and base design,</L>
<L>And flattery mean, and servile complaisance,</L>
<L>From the dissembled Friend whose hollow heart</L>
<L>Professing service, aims but to deceive,</L>
<L>I seek the Muse; whose charms can softly steal</L>
<L>Affliction from itself, whose power can smoothe</L>
<L>The paths of rugged toil, can heal the wound</L>
<L N="10">Of discontent, and calm the throbbing breast</L>
<L>Of indignation. To my theme again</L>
<L>Well-pleased I turn, and view the simple race</L>
<L>Of Infant Innocence, as yet unwarp'd</L>
<L>By education, blameless nature their's,</L>
<L>And passions undebauch'd, from envy free,</L>
<L><PB N="60" REF="60"/>
From guile, and that assembled crew of ills</L>
<L>Produced by commerce with a tainted world.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND say wilt Thou (to whom long since had flow'd</L>
<L>The grateful strain, if apprehensive doubt</L>
<L N="20">Had not shrunk fearful from the public eye,</L>
<L>And dreaded lest thy praises should appear</L>
<L>Link'd to our slighted numbers.) Say, wilt Thou,</L>
<L>CULLEN! Unrivall'd Master of thy art!</L>
<L>Of soul acute throughout the winding maze</L>
<L>Of every devious system, to pursue</L>
<L>And mark the steps of error! By whose aid</L>
<L>Edina rears her Academic palm!</L>
<L>While to thy precepts listening, gathers round</L>
<L>Attentive Youth from each far-distant shore,</L>
<L N="30">And bigot envy droops beneath the ray</L>
<L>Of thy superior lustre! In whose heart</L>
<L>Dwells candour, inmate of the truly great,</L>
<L>And modest diffidence. Whom judgment sage</L>
<L>By long experience taught, directs to fix</L>
<L>The bounds of theory, ne'er own'd a guide</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="61"/>
But where observance faithfully severe</L>
<L>Hath ceased to pry; yet by her labours skill'd,</L>
<L>As with a glance, nicely to separate</L>
<L>What vulgar minds by seeming likeness caught,</L>
<L N="40">Absurdly blend; and deem thy conduct rash,</L>
<L>Till they behold with wonder health array</L>
<L>Those cheeks in rosy mantle, lately view'd</L>
<L>As death's pale harbingers. For to thy eye</L>
<L>Memory her fairest tablet swift presents,</L>
<L>And method gives that readiness of thought</L>
<L>By them ascribed to fancy, but which springs</L>
<L>From painful application. Say wilt Thou</L>
<L>Accept our tributary verse? Thou wilt.</L>
<L>For in thy breast the softer graces dwell,</L>
<L N="50">Nor hath Philosophy with stern controul</L>
<L>Lessen'd the milder virtues of the Man;</L>
<L>Thine is the breath sincere of friendship, thine</L>
<L>Compassion's unaffected ardour, thine</L>
<L>The Husband's and the Father's tender love,</L>
<L>And warm benevolence incircling all.</L>

<L>AT length, from stricter vigilance, the Child</L>
<L>Is freed O Mother, wean'd from thy embrace.</L>
<L>Yet the refused thy bosom, still attend</L>
<L>With guardian mind, still prize our lays, for thee,</L>
<L N="60">For Him, attuned; sincere, however else</L>
<L>Wanting due ornament; nor haply needs</L>
<L>Important truth the vivid dress of words,</L>
<L>The tinsel decorations which the song</L>
<L>Inferior claims. Nine moons are past, twelve more</L>
<L>As we have taught, proceed; such thrifty fare</L>
<L>Is best; thy Child's pure nature doth not ask</L>
<L>Variety of meats. He thrives, He grows,</L>
<L>His cheeks unsullied bloom, his soul expands,</L>
<L>Thou seest his smiles, his gay incessant voice</L>
<L N="70">Resounds; what covets thy fond wish? And now</L>
<L>His strength increased, his more elastic limbs</L>
<L>By constant motion exercised, his teeth</L>
<L>Given for utility, not shew, demand</L>
<L>Food more substantial. Yet, by every grace</L>
<L>Which doth, or ought t' inspire the female breast,</L>
<L>By holy temperance, by every nice</L>
<L><PB N="63" REF="63"/>
Exciting sensibility, but chief</L>
<L>By that internal sting which goads the soul</L>
<L>To potent love of offspring, I conjure,</L>
<L N="80">I charge thee, Mother, Friend, with strict regard</L>
<L>Consult thy Child's unvitiated taste.</L>
<L>Oh! as Thou would'st th' invenom'd adder shun,</L>
<L>Renounce their false opinion, who seduced</L>
<L>By ignorance misjudging, think whate'er</L>
<L>Delights their grosser appetites, will please</L>
<L>Will suit his unhabituated lip;</L>
<L>And thus unknowing but with liberal hand</L>
<L>Cherish their Babes with poison. Wretched Race!</L>
<L>Unconscious Criminals! Murthering thro love</L>
<L N="90">The hapless Beings they would die to save.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By social laws estranged from Nature's paths,</L>
<L>We lead an artificial life; and feel</L>
<L>Unnumber'd wants, which indolence begets</L>
<L>On fond imagination. Polisht high,</L>
<L>The cultivated manners yield no doubt</L>
<L>Joys of superior kind; hence speaks the stone</L>
<L><PB N="64" REF="64"/>
At sculpture's touch, the breathing Canvas lives,</L>
<L>And Poetry and Music fire the soul.</L>
<L>A thousand nameless elegancies mix</L>
<L N="100">Our jarring minds, and by collision soft</L>
<L>Vanquish their native roughness; modest Love</L>
<L>Binds her enchanting Cestus; on our steps</L>
<L>The Graces wait; we drop the tear humane</L>
<L>Of sacred pity; and Benevolence</L>
<L>Tho powerless to relieve, affords a sigh.</L>
<L>The chaster Genius of convivial mirth</L>
<L>Around our table smiles, and drives far off</L>
<L>Brutal ebriety; profusion yields</L>
<L>The place to neatness; and th' internal sense</L>
<L N="110">Is caterer to th' external. Thus upraised</L>
<L>By slow degrees from barbarism obscure</L>
<L>Man gains his elevation. Oh! how blest,</L>
<L>Could ever-roving Fancy be content!</L>
<L>But always on the wing She strains her slight</L>
<L>In quest of novelty. Hence every thread</L>
<L>Fine-stretch'd before, must still be finer drawn.</L>
<L>Our polisht manners turn to frivolous;</L>
<L><PB N="65" REF="65"/>
The soul of Art neglected, We behold</L>
<L>The outward shew; unskill'd to comprehend</L>
<L N="120">The large design, on parts minute, on toys,</L>
<L>And splendid colourings we doat; reject</L>
<L>The strain emphatic, curious of the phrase</L>
<L>Uncommon, or sonorons period round;</L>
<L>And music must surprize, not charm the heart.</L>
<L>To elegance succeeds the spurious brood</L>
<L>Of soft voluptuousness. Love, holy love,</L>
<L>The fairest flower life's garden e'er can boast,</L>
<L>Falls to the ground, and changeful wantonness</L>
<L>Rank particolour'd weed springs forth, sure bane</L>
<L N="130">To every virtue. Pity dwindles down</L>
<L>To mean self-love; and seeming generous,</L>
<L>We're but the slaves of vanity. We seek</L>
<L>We covet the protracted meal, and still</L>
<L>Goad, as it palls, our jaded appetite</L>
<L>With new incentives. Ransack every elime,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>FOR by cold gales our muscles firmly braced</L>
<L>Act with due force: Or else th' ethereal stream</L>
<L>Perhaps condensed, flows stronger from the brain,</L>
<L>And gives to every limb it's healthful tone.</L>
<L>Not so beneath more torrid Heavens, there sink</L>
<L>The vital powers, to mortal languor doom'd,</L>
<L>Unless excited by the quickening warmth</L>
<L>Of aliment more active. What to them</L>
<L N="150">Nature commands, to us her laws forbid.</L>
<L>And tho unconscious of immediate ill,</L>
<L>At length the stomach, harrasst and o'erworn</L>
<L>By this licentious diet, fails; the pulse</L>
<L>Weakly contracts, each nerve decays, old age</L>

<L N="410">Which wild exuberant Nature would deny.</L>

<L>ERE yet we close the strain, one error more</L>
<L>The Muse will combat. Tenderness may prompt</L>
<L>Whene'er thy Child shall ask thee, to bestow</L>
<L>The needless viand. In his younger days</L>
<L>We bound thee not to rules. But now when o'er</L>
<L>His head four annual suns have roll'd, advise</L>
<L>That he be taught submission to the laws</L>
<L>Of social life, which stated hours appoints</L>
<L>For action, and repast. Nor heed the voice</L>
<L N="420">Of ignorance, which talks of exercise,</L>
<L>And quick digestion. Often well we know</L>
<L><PB N="80" REF="80"/>
The vicious taste of idle wantonness</L>
<L>Demands restraint. But lest to thee it seem</L>

<L>His craving; thus, with certainty detect</L>
<L>Fictitious appetite. His other meals</L>
<L>Yet undirected, both at morn and eve,</L>
<L>Be fresh drawn broths, and milk in various forms</L>
<L N="430">With rice, or other farinaceous grain</L>
<L>Inspissated. We would not stint thy Child,</L>
<L>And know his growth requires a constant flux</L>
<L>Of plastic fluids; nay, 'tis best to err,</L>
<L>If err, in quantity; the flexile tubes</L>
<L>Of Children, will perhaps with ease transpire</L>
<L>What is redundant. But with heed observe:</L>
<L>Add thy discretion to the Muse's lore:</L>
<L>And reason, and experience be thy guides.</L>

<L>Of wit and decent mirth; but may He live,</L>
<L>Born for society, no hermit sour,</L>
<L>Or driveling moralist, absurdly grave,</L>
<L N="450">And singularly dull. Temperate by choice,</L>
<L>But not austerely abstinent. By thee</L>
<L>Is the foundation in his primal years</L>
<L>Firm laid, by which he need not sacrifice</L>
<L>To rigid niceness; but with health his friend,</L>
<L>Will not start back from every little change,</L>
<L>Which weaker habits must with caution shun,</L>
<L>Or cannot with impunity indulge.</L>
<L>Thine is the work, and gratitude shall then</L>
<L>Repay the debt, the filial debt he owes.</L>
<L N="460">Then shalt thou feel, tho strong th' instinctive tye</L>

<HEAD><PB REF="94"/>BOOK THE FOURTH.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SWEET is the breath of Fame, and o'er the soul</L>
<L>Of Youth, on Fancy's pinions wasted back,</L>
<L>The daring Visitor of times unknown,</L>
<L>And future ages, like a spicy breeze</L>
<L>Steals her delicious fragrance; like a breeze</L>
<L>From Zeylon or Sumatra, which enchants</L>
<L>The Sailors heart, tho night involves the coast,</L>
<L>And hides it's lovely foliage from his view:</L>
<L>While in his mind He sees the blooming groves,</L>
<L N="10">And haply thinks them fairer than they are.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SWEET o'er my bosom stole the breath of Fame</L>
<L>In early life, on Fancy's pinions borne;</L>
<L>Th' ideal prospects rose supremely fair,</L>
<L>And in extatic vision I beheld</L>
<L>Perennial bays distinguishing my tomb.</L>
<L><PB N="96" REF="95"/>
For not unuseful, or of light import</L>
<L>The strains I sung. And though mid glades obscure</L>
<L>Dwelt the sequester'd Muse, from riot far,</L>
<L>From pomp imperious, and the lordly board</L>
<L N="20">Begirt with servile slatterers, yet her breast</L>
<L>By human kindness sway'd, where'er had pierced</L>
<L>The British language, manners, arts, and arms,</L>
<L>Revered the Good; and base-born Envy dead,</L>
<L>Or vanquisht, or engaged with living worth,</L>
<L>Exulted in th' esteem of times to come,</L>
<L>And Virtue's mutual friendship unreserved.</L>
<L>In distant Continents, where horrid War</L>
<L>Now stains with Brother's blood the guilty soil,</L>
<L>In distant Islands, mid their nodding palms,</L>
<L N="30">And growing sweets, her eyes survey'd with joy</L>
<L>The willing Parent bending o'er her lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>DEAR to the youthful mind, ye Prospects hail!</L>
<L>Ye Visions wide-removed! for deep Ye thrill'd,</L>
<L>Fixing, as real, all your traces there.</L>
<L>And, if illusive all, yet riper Age</L>
<L><PB N="97" REF="96"/>
Can scarce believe the flattering scenes untrue,</L>
<L>Or cease the vivid colours to behold</L>
<L>Bright glowing thro the shadowy lapse of years.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MEANWHILE, O CODRINGTON! whose generous heart</L>
<L N="40">Blames not the tenor of my partial song;</L>
<L>By whom uncensured flows the self-applause.</L>
<L>Whose temper, mild as an autumnal sky,</L>
<L>No cloud obscures; with feelings warm, yet ruled</L>
<L>By cautious judgment, in whose breast resides</L>
<L>Friendship's pure Heaven-descended flame; alive</L>
<L>To all a Parent's fondest love; yet both</L>
<L>Under superior reason's nice controul</L>
<L>Directed to their truest end and use!</L>
<L>For thee, and such as thee, an audience small,</L>
<L N="50">In space and number circumscribed, by wealth,</L>
<L>By rank and titles undebased, again</L>
<L>I venture the Pierian spring to seek,</L>
<L>And tread on sacred ground. How difficult</L>
<L>Where, thro the laurel groves, and myrtle shades,</L>
<L>The verdant alleys, lawns, and rising slopes,</L>
<L><PB N="98" REF="97"/>
Thick strewn with flowers of every various hue,</L>
<L>Of every various season, Elegance,</L>
<L>Coy Nymph, unsated wanders, on each scene</L>
<L>With curious eye commenting, from the sweets,</L>
<L N="60">The never-fading blooms, each virid arch,</L>
<L>Selecting meetest garlands, to suspend</L>
<L>Upon the tree of Taste, most eminent</L>
<L>In the poetic region, underneath</L>
<L>Whose fragrant shelter, Phoebus and the Nine</L>
<L>In chorus met, attune their happier strains</L>
<L>Of rarest harmony: How difficult,</L>
<L>By Health and Youth attended, to pursue</L>
<L>The bashful Maid, attract her favouring eye,</L>
<L>And wooe Her to bestow a single wreathe!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="70">CAN I then hope, whom sickness long hath drench'd</L>
<L>In her Lethaean dews, with feeble limbs,</L>
<L>And wan complection, from her hands to bear</L>
<L>Those gifts, which unpossesst, my lays must creep</L>
<L>Dully monotonous, nor touch the heart,</L>
<L>Nor win th' approving mind? Yet, witness Thou!</L>
<L><PB N="99" REF="98"/>
Witness my Friend! Who know'st the human frame,</L>
<L>Each drug of cordial, each of healing power,</L>
<L>To me in vain administer'd, what toil</L>
<L>I must experience now, the Nymph to trace</L>
<L N="80">Through her meand'ring walks! what partial chance</L>
<L>Should she my languid homage not disdain!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YET, thy inciting voice; the conscious thought</L>
<L>Sprung from the love of kind, which tells Me, all</L>
<L>Will not be frustrate, nor the darling wish</L>
<L>Of public good be wholly unfulfill'd;</L>
<L>Some loitering sparks of that once brighter flame</L>
<L>My soul enkindling, prompt me to a task</L>
<L>Long interrupted: Where in slumbers deep</L>
<L>It rests, t' awaken the Didactic Lyre;</L>
<L N="90">With it's more solemn notes to mingle tones</L>
<L>(So they to memory fail not to recur)</L>
<L>Oft heard of yore, as t' ward the lucid fount</L>
<L>I stole, not unforbidden; tones which please</L>
<L>Heighten'd the more by contrast, and engage</L>
<L>Amusive the charm'd ear, till it imbibe</L>
<L><PB N="100" REF="99"/>
Instruction with delight, till melody</L>
<L>Not the chief object seem, it's liquid voice</L>
<L>Yielding to reason's energy divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OF Cloathing now, of Heat, and Cold We sing,</L>
<L N="100">Unanimating themes; but which require</L>
<L>Th' attention of the Bard, as not of use</L>
<L>Inferior to the subjects which erewhile</L>
<L>He strove t' adorn; nor claiming notice less</L>
<L>From the true bosom of Parental Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>STILL heed We Nature, and her guiding steps</L>
<L>Pursue; nor, tho with moans, and plaintive cries</L>
<L>From his concealment issues to the light</L>
<L>Man's tender Progeny, believe, He feels</L>
<L>Th' external air his undefended frame</L>
<L N="110">Keenly invade. These moans, these cries proceed</L>
<L>From other causes. To his lungs at once,</L>
<L>Expanding their nice substance, rushes in</L>
<L>The forceful air. The circulating blood</L>
<L>Alters it's course, thro channels unessay'd</L>
<L><PB N="101" REF="100"/>
Impell'd, whose first resistance haply claim</L>
<L>Exertions of the labouring heart, quick, strong,</L>
<L>If not convulsive, yet irregular.</L>
<L>Exertions of the lungs themselves, to gain</L>
<L>Their necessary powers, and genial spring.</L>
<L N="120">Add too that oft each muscle, every limb</L>
<L>Strain'd and compresst, scarce bears the gentlest touch,</L>
<L>Sore from the late hard conflict undergone,</L>
<L>And agonies maternal. But to cold,</L>
<L>Know, He is born impassive; or at least</L>
<L>With vital warmth supplied, to render vain</L>
<L>It's most severe assault; beyond the scale</L>
<L>Of heat which stimulates maturer age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE needs not Art's assistant hand, or dress</L>
<L>Of studied care. Uncloath'd, in wilder climes,</L>
<L N="130">Like the more hardy natives of the soil,</L>
<L>E'en in the polar regions, He might brave</L>
<L>The freezing atmosphere. Nay, unwith-held</L>
<L>By dubious fears, tho placed indeed beneath</L>
<L>More favouring skies, there are, who from his birth</L>
<L><PB N="102" REF="101"/>
Plunge th' infant stranger in the gelid wave,</L>
<L>Where unappall'd the mother too enjoys</L>
<L>The bath's refreshing coolness. But, nor harsh,</L>
<L>Nor fanciful, We shall not recommend</L>
<L>To Thee, more delicate in form and mind,</L>
<L N="140">Daughter of Britain, these examples, drawn</L>
<L>From savage nations, and from tribes remote.</L>
<L>Cloath'd be thy Child; so polisht custom wills,</L>
<L>And decent manners: But in airy garb,</L>
<L>Loose, and uncinctured. Thus He shall avoid</L>
<L>The torment of accumulated heat,</L>
<L>Nor from unnatural coercion feel</L>
<L>Distress and anguish. With minuter rules</L>
<L>To croud the page, and dull or quaint describe</L>
<L>His vesture, what materials should compose</L>
<L N="150">Each article, and whether by the loop,</L>
<L>Or pin restrain'd, (tho as the last may bring</L>
<L>Danger, nay death, the caution which forbids</L>
<L>It's use, above the trivial-seeming cause</L>
<L>Important rises) descants such as these,</L>
<L>Prolixly mean, would argue in the Muse</L>
<L><PB N="103" REF="102"/>
Failure of judgment, no respect to Thee.</L>
<L>Suffice the general maxim; to dilate.</L>
<L>And to the test each consequence reduce,</L>
<L>Be thine. Bright glows the warm maternal soul,</L>
<L N="160">And clear, illumined by a hint alone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOR flows with that necessity the strain,</L>
<L>As erst it might, when barbarous hands around</L>
<L>The new-born Babe fold over fold inwreath'd</L>
<L>The circling band. Amid the wanton gales</L>
<L>Which Luxury breathes, amid the changeful swarms</L>
<L>Which Fashion decks in her chameleon hues,</L>
<L>Amid th' increasing follies of our age,</L>
<L>And vices not perhaps destructive less</L>
<L>Than those of old, tho softer, milder far,</L>
<L N="170">Link'd with humanity, and taught to charm,</L>
<L>To poison by politeness; Justice owns,</L>
<L>While the rough virtues of our ancestors</L>
<L>And manly genius We no more behold:</L>
<L>Our souls revolt from habits which enslaved</L>
<L>Unamiable their Minds, and from the sway</L>
<L><PB N="104" REF="103"/>
Of Prejudice, whose galling shackles long</L>
<L>Their vigorous faculties controul'd. This truth</L>
<L>Justice confesses, this, th' instructive Muse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>GLADLY, O Mother! We congratulate</L>
<L>Thy Infant, who from life's first dawn enjoys</L>
<L N="180">His birth-right, who the vital air at will</L>
<L>Inhales, nor feels corporeal bonds. With me</L>
<L>Revert thine eyes, and Lo! their hapless Sons,</L>
<L>How braced and pinion'd, who t' extend the reign</L>
<L>Of civil liberty, with ardour toil'd,</L>
<L>Who fought, who bled t' extend it. (Nor escaped</L>
<L>The Race preceding our's.) See, where they lye,</L>
<L>True objects of compassion! round them close</L>
<L>Is fixt the painful bandage, not a limb</L>
<L>Can move; sad victims to th' erroneous creed</L>
<L N="190">Which holds that Nature incompletely acts,</L>
<L>And forms defective works, that Art may give</L>
<L>The strength by her refused, and perfect thus</L>
<L>Th' unfinisht system, gasping they recline</L>
<L>In real martyrdom. The shriek is heard,</L>
<L><PB N="105" REF="104"/>
The groan, the sob expressive, but in vain.</L>
<L>In vain the little Captive, as awhile</L>
<L>Released from durance, utters sounds of joy,</L>
<L>Stretches his arms well-pleased, and smiles, and casts</L>
<L>His looks delighted on the cheerful blaze,</L>
<L N="200">Or waving taper. To his fetters soon</L>
<L>Remanded, He in vain attempts to cope</L>
<L>With arbitrary power, each effort tries,</L>
<L>Shews by each deed th' abhorrence which He feels,</L>
<L>Adding th' emphatic eloquence of tears,</L>
<L>Of inarticulate, but deep distress,</L>
<L>And struggles all-impassion'd to be free.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WITH pity and contempt thy soul beholds</L>
<L>This picture. What calamities ensued,</L>
<L>Experience proved; but idiot bigotry</L>
<L N="210">Confess'd them not. Th' evolving principle</L>
<L>Within, the plastic juice augmenting size,</L>
<L>Thus partially impeded, could not urge</L>
<L>The destined fibres onward, or enlarge</L>
<L>By due accretion e'en the vital cells</L>
<L><PB N="106" REF="105"/>
Requiring speediest growth. Yet active still,</L>
<L>In disproportion'd manner, to the head</L>
<L>Unseemly bulk they added; or the joints</L>
<L>Distended, and relax'd. Or oft from pain</L>
<L>Shrinking, the Child, unconscious but of ease,</L>
<L N="220">Curved by forced attitudes the flexile bones,</L>
<L>Nay th' all-supporting spine. Th' obstructed breath,</L>
<L>The fluids in their circulating course</L>
<L>Unnaturally check'd; th' irriguous glands;</L>
<L>The fount whence motion, and sensation spring,</L>
<L>And future intellect, the Brain itself,</L>
<L>Disturbed, or with more lasting injury</L>
<L>Impresst, exclaim'd at this preposterous war,</L>
<L>The war which Step-dame Art with Nature waged.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>CALL'D by society to tread the paths</L>
<L N="230">Of busy life, from it's hard slavery soon</L>
<L>The stronger Sex was freed; and ere too late,</L>

<L>Could boast a frame of vigour unimpair'd,</L>
<L>And undeformed. But to long sufferings doom'd,</L>
<L><PB N="107" REF="106"/>
The female Race, so will'd perverted taste,</L>
<L>For many a year pined underneath the force</L>
<L>Of this domestic torture. For as erst</L>
<L>The Mother strove t' assist their infant nerves,</L>
<L>And give to weakness strength: She now assay'd</L>
<L N="240">Her progeny t' embellish, and their shape</L>
<L>To mould, as fancied beauty in her eye</L>
<L>Deceptive shone. Heaven! that the human Mind</L>
<L>Warp'd by imagination, should believe,</L>
<L>Or e'en suggest it possible, the form,</L>
<L>Whose archetype the Deity Himself</L>
<L>Created in his image, could be changed</L>
<L>From it's divine proportion, and receive</L>
<L>By alteration, comeliness and grace!</L>
<L>That round the Zone which awkwardly reduced</L>
<L N="250">E'en to an insect ligament the waist,</L>
<L>The blooming loves should sport, enticing charms,</L>
<L>And young attractions! Heaven! that e'er a Bard,</L>

<L>Forgetful of his charge, should deck with praise</L>
<L>As fair and lovely, what would strike the soul</L>
<L><PB N="108" REF="107"/>
Unwarp'd by custom, as a subject fit</L>
<L>For scorn, indignant spleen, or ridicule.</L>
<L>Yet Prior! tho nor taste nor reason blend</L>
<L>Their essence with the verse, while lasts the tongue</L>
<L N="260">Thy numbers help'd to polish, while the powers</L>
<L>Of melody bear sway, the verse shall live,</L>
<L>Beauteous description of a Gothic Shape.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OH! may the manners of thy nut-brown Maid,</L>
<L>Her artless truth, simplicity of soul,</L>
<L>Her fondness, and intrepid constancy,</L>
<L>Long in the bosoms of the British Fair,</L>
<L>Tho banisht every other region, dwell,</L>
<L>Delighted inmates! May their eyes still beam</L>
<L>With all her speaking rays, their cheeks endue</L>
<L N="270">Her modest crimson! But may never more</L>
<L>"The Boddice aptly laced" their panting hearts</L>
<L>Confine, or mutilate that symmetry</L>
<L>Of limb and figure, whence a Zeuxis' hand</L>
<L>His all-accomplisht Helen might have form'd,</L>

Sculptured a Venus. Tho Meridian day</L>
<L>Behold them drest as potent fashion bids,</L>
<L>Girt with exterior ornaments uncouth,</L>
<L>Trappings disgustful; yet at morn, or eve,</L>
<L N="280">Or when they to the genial bed repair,</L>
<L>Still may they charm the melting eye of love</L>
<L>With elegance and grace, the fabled Dames</L>
<L>Of classic soil transcending, native grace,</L>
<L>And elegance unveil'd, which mocks attire.</L>

<L>Th' ingenuous Parent claims. Resolved to bless</L>
<L N="300">Thy Child with ease and freedom, taught to shun</L>
<L>By the dire act of Swathing, all constraint</L>
<L>So baneful, let no part escape thy care.</L>
<L>Nor load the head; nor till he walk abroad,</L>
<L>At least till firmly he can press the ground,</L>
<L>Cover the legs or feet. Some precepts here,</L>
<L>To Cloathing unattached, or slightly link'd,</L>
<L>We mean t' inculcate. Need I then to thee,</L>
<L>O Mother, whom the soul refined alone</L>
<L>Can prompt t' inspect my numbers, recommend</L>

<L>Unsullied Cleanliness, with Her full oft</L>
<L>Thy Charge to visit? Not that to her shrine</L>

E'en from thy tender years thou hast not paid</L>
<L>Sincerest worship. But my words believe,</L>
<L>Strict watchfulness the Menial Train require,</L>
<L>And if, unheedful to their trust, they slight</L>
<L>The grave rebuke, dismiss them from thy doors.</L>
<L N="320">Not Their's the nicer sense inspiring Thee,</L>
<L>Those principles and habits now intwined</L>
<L>In union with thy nature. Nor is their's</L>
<L>The Babe, who smarting from their sloth, with nerves</L>
<L>Keenly alive, by the corrosive sting</L>
<L>Of acrimony pierced, tormented shrieks,</L>
<L>Or moans incessant. Neither scorn as vain,</L>
<L>The dictates which succeed, from Reason learn'd.</L>

<L>BANISH the softer couch; let not thy Child</L>

Such accident t' avoid, with cautious eye</L>
<L>Th' attendant mark, who bears him in her arms,</L>
<L>And let Her oft his posture shift, oft change</L>
<L>From right to left, altern. A careless Tribe,</L>
<L>Purchased by interest only, is the Race</L>
<L N="340">To servitude accustomed; trust not them.</L>
<L>Trust thy own judgment, let thy ruling mind</L>
<L>Govern each act of their's. Yet neither here,</L>
<L>Nor elsewhere, mean We in a general blame</L>
<L>T' involve them all. Some from attachment serve,</L>
<L>And to constrictive duty add the tye</L>
<L>Of willing love. Such as a treasure prize,</L>
<L>A countless treasure. Say, by One of these</L>
<L>Is thy Child foster'd? smoothe for her the brow,</L>
<L>The tone of high command; let all her days</L>
<L N="350">Roll on illumed by kindness and esteem;</L>
<L>Think her thy fellow-labourer and thy friend;</L>
<L>Alleviate every future ill of life,</L>
<L>And, if thou can'st, remove them. Ne'er may She</L>
<L>Who with maternal prudence, and the warmth</L>
<L>Of zeal affectionate, hath lent her aid</L>

To form thy Children, to support, to raise</L>
<L>From perilous estate to strength and health,</L>
<L>Feel the distressful sting of poverty,</L>
<L>Or, if the means are not withheld, in thee</L>
<L N="360">Want a protector. But, if more than this,</L>
<L>Her bosom hath the nutriment supplied</L>
<L>Which thine refused, still more may she demand,</L>
<L>And thou in justice grant the liberal boon.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND Oh! Ingenuous Youth! whose blood now flusht</L>
<L>With yet unsatiated desire, quick beats</L>
<L>In every pulse, to mix in active life</L>
<L>Intent, or climb where science points the way!</L>
<L>Oh Virgin! Who with beauty deckt, and gay</L>
<L>In unperverted innocence around</L>

<L>Able to cope with business, or sustain</L>
<L>The toil, which knowledge asks, to gather in</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="113"/>
Her wide-spread harvest. That attentive zeal,</L>
<L>To which thou owest the comeliness of shape,</L>
<L>Those beauties which from every eye attract</L>
<L>Th' applausive glance, and every breast inspire</L>
<L N="380">With love or admiration. Recollect</L>
<L>Not frigidly, or faintly, like the crew</L>
<L>Who every pleasure center in themselves;</L>
<L>Not with weak indecisive apathy;</L>
<L>But with a bounteous and expanded soul,</L>
<L>Estranged from self, replete with gratitude.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BECAUSE the winged Nations fondly brood</L>
<L>Over their unfledg'd Young; because We view</L>
<L>Where'er reclined, her new-born Offspring press</L>
<L>Close to the Parent Quadruped; because</L>
<L N="390">By instinct irresistible impell'd</L>
<L>The Mother longs t' embrace her infant Charge,</L>
<L>And hide it in her bosom; while thro wilds,</L>
<L>Or o'er the desart mountain as she roves,</L>
<L>The Savage still her clinging Babe sustains:</L>
<L>Some, this communicated warmth affirm</L>
<L><PB N="115" REF="114"/>
Is needful; and that Man's else-drooping Race</L>
<L>Requires the genial contact. Mindless they,</L>
<L>How far from Nature's simpleness diverge</L>
<L>Our steps, our every action. Were the Child</L>
<L N="400">Unclad by day, unshelter'd thro the night,</L>
<L>We should not hesitate to recommend</L>
<L>What otherwise We smile at, or perchance</L>
<L>Hold but of dubious consequence. Our lays</L>
<L>Have taught what cold his system can repell</L>
<L>First into light immerging: And if cloath'd</L>
<L>As custom bids, he from himself will gain</L>
<L>This added warmth, condensed, and on himself</L>
<L>Recoiling. Better thus, than haply sunk</L>
<L>Beneath the load which our nocturnal rest</L>
<L N="410">Demands, to feel th' intense phlogistic heat</L>
<L>Of temporary fever, or to melt</L>
<L>In copious steam away. Much better thus,</L>
<L>Than by the Mother or the Nurse oppresst</L>
<L>In heavy sleep, to frustrate all the schemes</L>
<L>Parental love had formed; or placed within</L>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Address to Dr Milman.—The Author declines treating particularly of the Diseases of Children.—The treat∣ment of Diseases in general, cannot be taught to the Vulgar; nor could those of Children be contained in a work like this; much less could the skill and judg∣ment be imparted necessary for the administration of Remedies.—False notion, because Children cannot de∣scribe their feelings, that the seats and causes of their Diseases are therefore unknown.—Diseases of Children not so simple as Some have imagined.—The Causes also are many and various.—Necessity of applying for speedy assistance.—This, even should it be unsuccessful, will binder the remorse which might follow a different conduct.—The effects of this remorse exemplified in an Episode.—Inoculation.—Rise and progress of the Smallpox.—Introduction of Inoculation into Europe by Lady Mary Wortley Montague.—This duty in∣culcated.—Conclusion.</HI></P>

<L>TO thee, whom laudable Ambition fires,</L>
<L>Surmounting every obstacle, to climb</L>
<L>The height of science, rivalling the fame</L>
<L>Of Arbuthnot, or Garth, or learned Mead:</L>
<L>With whom in life's gay morn my heart inwove</L>
<L>A bond of union, which no power but death</L>
<L>Can e'er untwine: whose warm, whose liberal voice</L>
<L>Hath oft approved my strains, in this perchance</L>
<L>Too partial, yet humane, and in the song</L>
<L N="10">Contemplating the Friend: This verse, to thee,</L>
<L>MILMAN! as worthier of thy classic ear,</L>
<L>I now devote; nor would I on thy time</L>
<L>Sacred to public good, or studious thought,</L>
<L>Intrude the futile levities of wit,</L>
<L>Or useless elegance, howe'er refined.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="166" REF="164"/>
<L>WITH prudence nursed, and by it's precepts formed,</L>
<L>Thy Child, O Parent! haply will ascend</L>
<L>Unhurt to manhood. Yet, events there are,</L>
<L>Which not my lays can teach the means to shun,</L>
<L N="20">Nor thy assiduous caution can elude.</L>
<L>For He is mortal, and to mortal ills</L>
<L>Prone from his birth. Each violent Disease</L>
<L>The human race invading, may be his:</L>
<L>And some, confined, exert their baleful force</L>
<L>On Infancy, and Childhood. What, thy care,</L>
<L>What, rural scenes, what the pure lymph, and food</L>
<L>Aptly supplied; what his own active powers</L>
<L>Indulged, the frigid bath, and cleanliness,</L>
<L>With regulation due of heat and cold,</L>
<L N="30">Can frustrate or prevent, and much they may,</L>
<L>He will avoid. At least the shafts of Death</L>
<L>Shall oft be blunted, Nature's vigorous arm</L>
<L>Her shield protending, while her faithful aid</L>
<L>Joins with thy ardent wishes. Is thy mind,</L>
<L>Anxious, and fond, with this unsatisfied?</L>
<L>And dost thou ask the latent plagues to view</L>
<L><PB N="167" REF="165"/>
Skulking in ambush? know their different signs?</L>
<L>Learn their Prognostics, fatal, or secure?</L>
<L>And the resources which progressive Time</L>
<L N="40">Hath found, and liberal Practice can select?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT wilt Thou gain, so taught? Augmented fears,</L>
<L>Doubled anxiety. In every look</L>
<L>If slightly changed, in every wanton cry,</L>
<L>Or sudden start, thy love solicitous</L>
<L>The feeds of dire disaster will perceive,</L>
<L>And haste with needless remedies t' oppose</L>
<L>A fancied mischief, till thy Infant feels</L>
<L>Perhaps thus often treated, real pain.</L>
<L>Say, that Disease were fixt, and that our page</L>
<L N="50">Lay full before thee fraught with justest rules;</L>
<L>Could'st thou with timid mind, and throbbing heart,</L>
<L>Presume t' apply them? Would'st thou not, immerst</L>
<L>In hesitation, all attempts forego?</L>
<L>If not, the tone, and bias of thy soul</L>
<L>Mistaking, We for such as thee ne'er strung</L>
<L>The lyre humane, nor e'er the lyre will string.</L>

<L>YET, much the welfare of thy Child We prize;</L>
<L>And doubtless, even from his natal hour</L>

<L>And when th' instructive plan We first essay'd,</L>
<L>Imagination's inconsiderate eye</L>
<L>Colleagued with Youth, this finish'd work beheld.</L>
<L>But Judgment, render'd stronger by the lapse</L>
<L>Of twice seven years, rejects the green design.</L>
<L>A theme inelegant, for verse unfit,</L>
<L>Tedious, and long, and barren, and to Thee</L>
<L>Of little profit, nay with danger stored.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="70">A TASK like this, the Muse without regret</L>
<L>Leaves to some <HI>Medicaster,</HI> who the quill,</L>
<L>Dextrously wielding, aims at vulgar praise.</L>
<L>We know the failure of Generic marks</L>
<L>Employ'd on Species; near the bed of pain</L>
<L>We know what nice distinction is required,</L>
<L>What accurate serenity of thought,</L>

What sedulous attention, to collect</L>
<L>Each circumstance minute; and from the traits</L>
<L>Commingled and fictitious, to detach</L>
<L N="80">What suits peculiar natures, and the turns</L>
<L>Of endless and immense Varieties.</L>

By some assuming, specious shallow Scribe,</L>

<L>With strict discernment thro the tangled maze</L>
<L N="120">Of it's progressive symptoms, to conduct</L>

<L>Unerring judgment, which alone acquired</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L N="130">YET, what We may, what nor the Muse forbids,</L>
<L>Nor our own sense condemns, is freely thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IF from the Mother's bosom We remove</L>
<L>Those false opinions which her gentle soul</L>
<L>Unwittingly possess; if we describe</L>
<L>The limits of her care, and when t' invoke</L>
<L><PB N="172" REF="170"/>
Superior Wisdom's aid; if on her mind</L>
<L>Some duties we impress; and tyrant fear,</L>

<L>Far from her dwelling, not in vain We write:</L>
<L N="140">And many a fell disease o'ercome, her Sons,</L>
<L>Her Daughters shall hereafter bless the day</L>
<L>Which brought these well-meant numbers to her ear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BECAUSE the Child, with reason unendow'd</L>
<L>And power of speech, by words t' express his grief</L>
<L>Nature permits not; some believe the source</L>
<L>Of anguish and affliction is conceal'd</L>
<L>From every eye, and deem assistance vain.</L>
<L>Or to the Nurse, or vaunting Midwife trust,</L>
<L>Who cases manifold and similar</L>

<L>For Each her Nostrum boasts; if harmless this,</L>

Hurrying convulsions on of direst kind;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>YET, Nature, in thy Child, tho not in words,</L>
<L N="160">Speaks plain to those who in her language verst</L>
<L>Justly interpret. Are the different tones</L>
<L>Of woe, unfaithful sounds? Can He, whose sight</L>
<L>Hath traced the various muscles in their course,</L>
<L>When irritated in the different limbs,</L>
<L>Retracted, or extended, or supine,</L>
<L>Fix no conclusions on the seat of pain?</L>
<L>Is it of no avail to mark the breath,</L>
<L>How drawn? the face? the motions of the eye?</L>
<L>The salient pulse? th' eruptions on the skin?</L>
<L N="170">The skin itself, constricted, or relaxt?</L>
<L>The mode of sleep? of watching? heat? and thirst?</L>
<L>From which, and numerous traits beside, arranged,</L>
<L>Combined, abstracted, and maturely weigh'd,</L>
<L>Judgment it's practice forms? Are characters</L>
<L>Like these, which ask the nice-decyphering soul,</L>
<L><PB N="174" REF="172"/>
Intelligible to the Beldames Old</L>
<L>Who wrapt in darkness, utter prophesies</L>
<L>And lying oracles, which cheat the ear,</L>
<L>Or follow'd, to destruction lead the way?</L>
<L N="180">Oh! may good Angels, kindling in thy breast</L>
<L>The lamp of reason, guard thee from their snares!</L>
<L>Blind Guides, assiduous to deceive the Blind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>TRUTHS partially adopted oft admit</L>
<L>Ingressive Error. Children are presumed,</L>
<L>As fresh from Nature's hand, with maladies</L>
<L>Of simpler kind to labour, than the frame</L>
<L>Of grosser Age. Say, this belief were true?</L>
<L>A general rule? If simpler than they are</L>
<L>Hence treated, still we cannot but decry</L>
<L N="190">Th' unsound opinion which for all alike</L>
<L>One favourite mode of practice recommends.</L>
<L>If just the notion, Aesculapius' Son</L>
<L>Might as a vain intruder be dismiss'd,</L>
<L>The Mother could supply his place unblamed.</L>
<L>But, (nor with idle terrors do we seek</L>
<L><PB N="175" REF="173"/>
To wound affection) from experience taught,</L>
<L>We know what medicines, different in effect,</L>
<L>And opposite, the varying symptoms claim.</L>
<L>Antiphlogistics which the vital heat</L>
<L N="200">Increased, depress; and Cardiacs which excite;</L>
<L>And Opiate Sedatives, in vulgar hands</L>
<L>Pernicious as the deadly nightshade's juice.</L>
<L>And Drastics harsh, which utmost skill alone,</L>
<L>And wise discretion, when the moment calls,</L>
<L>Should dare advise. Th' uncomprehensive Mind,</L>
<L>Or prejudiced, or wishing to repose</L>
<L>In inactivity, is likewise prone</L>
<L>To simplify the causes, and accuse</L>
<L>That which perhaps exists not, but which reigns</L>
<L N="210">As it conjectures, eminent o'er all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE wild delusions which this source affords,</L>
<L>With silent scorn or pity hath the Muse</L>
<L>Often attested. The luxuriant glands,</L>
<L>In Infants stiled of disproportion'd size,</L>
<L>And the too copious fluids they secern,</L>
<L><PB N="176" REF="174"/>
Or tough and viscid, Some alone condemn.</L>
<L>As if these glands by nature were ordain'd</L>
<L>So large without design, or worse, to prove</L>
<L>The cisterns of disease. Acidity</L>
<L N="220">Some only blame; and some, the sting severe</L>
<L>Of acrimonious humours. These accuse</L>
<L>The noisome worm, however hid from fight.</L>
<L>Those, as exciting fever, reprobate</L>
<L>Nought but the growing teeth. Repletion, Some.</L>
<L>While Others dreadful fits survey within,</L>
<L>Or e'en pretend to trace them in the smile</L>
<L>Of downy sleep. Nor Women solely err.</L>
<L>The Pedant has his whims; and He, the light</L>
<L>Fantastic Form, who superficial skims</L>
<L N="230">The froth of science, yet would fain appear</L>
<L>Most intimate in it's profoundest depths,</L>
<L>Nor a phaenomenon beholds, to which,</L>
<L>Like the first Man, intuitively wise,</L>
<L>He cannot give a name. What strange conceits</L>
<L>Have not Philosophers embraced? Intent</L>
<L>The principles of Galen to defend?</L>
<L><PB N="177" REF="175"/>
Or to deduce from chymic elements</L>
<L>Recondite causes? Or the line apply</L>
<L>And mathematic rule, to buildings raised</L>
<L N="240">On mere imaginary ground? Or search</L>
<L>The moon, and aspects of the distant stars?</L>
<L>While Some, from animated Beings, thick</L>
<L>Diffused thro space, invisibly minute,</L>
<L>Have every ill derived, tormenting Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LET All who will, enjoy their pleasing dreams,</L>
<L>So human life be safe; and Theory</L>
<L>Held in firm durance, never guide the pen</L>
<L>When sickness needs assistance. But, of this</L>
<L>Be sure, O Parent! to thy Children flow</L>
<L N="250">From numerous causes, which would tire thy ear,</L>
<L>And pass the stated limits of our verse,</L>
<L>Their diverse ails; tho not perhaps like Us</L>
<L>Subject to putrid ferments, yet from them</L>
<L>Not wholly free, nor from the power of cold,</L>
<L>Of sultry heat, of humid air, and dry,</L>
<L>And fell Contagion, whose resistless aim</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>SHALL then by fear impeded, None attempt</L>
<L>To rescue Childhood from distress and pain,</L>
<L>But those, by long and toilsome study taught,</L>
<L>T' investigate the cause, the symptoms scan,</L>
<L>And judge what they portend? Th' impartial heart</L>
<L>Unmoved by sordid lucre, by the goad</L>
<L>Of mean self-interest, wishes to the Race</L>
<L>Of Infant Innocence, no worse a fate.</L>
<L>But not to combat what the Muses Nine,</L>
<L N="270">And e'en the Delian God with all his power,</L>
<L>Could never vanquish; and because the step</L>
<L>Of Paeon's Votary is not always near;</L>
<L>Attend our strains. When the weak head declines,</L>

<L><PB N="179" REF="177"/>
And in their office changed; when the young springs</L>
<L>Of life more quick or tardy seem to move</L>
<L>Than Nature wills; We would not to thy Child</L>
<L N="280">Forbid thee (tho We dare not recommend,</L>
<L>Nor can approve the deed, unless by fate</L>
<L>Widely sequester'd from th' experienced eye,</L>

<L>Of th' Indian root; or taught the quantity</L>
<L>With nice exactness, which his Age may claim,</L>

<L>For now the transient obstacles o'ercome,</L>
<L>Alacrity returns; or still He pines,</L>
<L>Still his distemper gains increasing force.</L>
<L>And if the cause should thus be deeply fixt,</L>

<L N="400">Flushes with transport, breathes a sudden air</L>
<L>Of chilling frost, the genial warmth destroys,</L>
<L>And florid bloom. One eve Evadne sat</L>
<L>Alone, in swift succession to her view</L>
<L>Rose many a fairy prospect, but the light</L>
<L>Which gilded them was Polydore's, the sun</L>
<L>Was He, illuming, animating all</L>
<L>The forms of her creation. Even then</L>
<L>She felt his warm embrace, and press'd She thought</L>
<L>His glowing cheek to her's; for him prepared,</L>
<L N="410">The table smiled; for him bright-beaming shone</L>
<L>The rosy wine; the foot-steps of his steed</L>
<L>She heard in every gale. But him, alas!</L>
<L>The living Polydore she never saw.</L>
<L>That Steed had proved unfaithful to his trust,</L>
<L>With mad'ning swiftness t'ward the gate He flew,</L>
<L>While far behind his breathless Master lay.</L>

<L>THE feelings of Evadne to describe</L>
<L>Weak is the Muse, and nerveless are her strains.</L>
<L>What can support her? Where exists the Power</L>
<L N="420">Which can detain her from the grave that holds</L>
<L>Her Lord in death? What, but the Babe which smiles</L>
<L>Unconscious of his loss, as on her breast,</L>
<L>Her nurturing breast, He hangs? For him She lives.</L>
<L>For him sustains the load of grief, and strives</L>
<L>To tear the rooted anguish from her mind.</L>
<L>He is the charm which reconciles her thoughts</L>
<L>To the loath'd world? for Polydore in him</L>
<L>She sees, in the dear pledge of amity:</L>
<L>Stampt with his image, with his vital blood</L>
<L N="430">Inform'd, and breathing sweet his balmy breath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HATH not Misfortune spent her deadly shafts?</L>
<L>Ill-starr'd Evadne! In thy Child appear</L>
<L>The symptoms of disease, and onward hastes</L>
<L>Impetuous Fever. To a form like thine,</L>
<L>A temper blameless, with emotions pure,</L>
<L>Humane, and amiable, ah! why did Heaven</L>
<L><PB N="187" REF="185"/>
Refuse staid Judgment, firmness to resist</L>
<L>Error importunate, and strength to shun</L>
<L>Credulity, which hears the Dotard's tale,</L>
<L N="440">And thinks it truth! Who taught thy Grandam hoar</L>
<L>The secrets of an art, to which the Mind</L>
<L>Of vigorous energy, and years of toil,</L>
<L>Are scarcely equal? By what Demon urged</L>
<L>Malicious, with what evil Spirit fill'd</L>
<L>Of self-conceit and folly, dares She hope</L>
<L>T' accomplish, what requires the searching eye</L>
<L>Of Genius and the labour'd skill of deep</L>
<L>And accurate attention? On thy Child</L>
<L>She looks, then proves her wisdom. First, the teeth</L>
<L>Are blamed, and charms are tried, and Nostrums given.</L>
<L N="451">Next, Fits internal, and her poisonous drugs</L>
<L>She brews like Circe. Then the noxious Worm;</L>
<L>And Anthelmintics various She procures,</L>
<L>And oft repeats the drench. Each different cause</L>
<L>She e'er has heard suggested, is accused,</L>
<L>And every remedy She ever knew,</L>
<L>Administer'd; while still, the last, her voice</L>
<L><PB N="188" REF="186"/>
Solemnly slow, declares will banish pain,</L>
<L>And with miraculous and sudden force</L>
<L N="460">Restore the suffering Babe; who lies meantime</L>
<L>Opprest with double woe, by his disease,</L>
<L>And that pernicious treatment, which from plain</L>
<L>And simple, has converted it at length</L>
<L>To mortal violence. Now, Nature yields</L>
<L>Reluctantly o'ercome. Evadne sees</L>
<L>The Victim of presumptuous Ignorance;</L>
<L>Conviction flashes on her mind; She calls</L>
<L>For aid, too late. He dies; and with him dies</L>
<L>Her Polydore again. She raves, She tears</L>
<L N="470">Her flowing locks. Yet, passionate excess</L>
<L>May waste itself, and Peace once more return.</L>
<L>It might return, as when She felt the pangs</L>
<L>Of absent love, as when her heart was torn,</L>
<L>Losing it's dearer portion. But the sting</L>
<L>Of sharp reflection, by Herself impell'd,</L>
<L>What hand shall e'er extract? Her delicate,</L>
<L>And feeling mind, imagination-struck,</L>
<L>Shrinks from existence; while by day, by night,</L>
<L><PB N="189" REF="187"/>
These sounds pervade her ear, "Thy Child is slain,</L>
<L N="480">And Thou wert an Accomplice." Horrid sounds!</L>
<L>Inviting on his cloud, the dreary Shape</L>
<L>Of melancholy Madness. Oh! what notes,</L>
<L>What different notes, utters Evadne now,</L>
<L>Enfrenzied, and forlorn, from those which erst</L>
<L>Amid their shades, or on their mossy banks,</L>
<L>The groves responsive heard, the joyous groves</L>
<L>Of quivering alder, and the willows green</L>
<L>Skirting the mazy brook, those Doric notes,</L>
<L>Which Polydore to his Evadne sung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>TURN We from scenes like these, which o'er the soul</L>
<L N="491">Of weeping Sympathy diffuse a gloom,</L>
<L>Yet, not unchasten'd by the milder ray</L>
<L>Of self-acquitting thought, and firm intent</L>
<L>To shun the latent rocks of deep distress,</L>
<L>By pious caution guided; from our theme</L>
<L>Not thus abstracted, it's preceptive notes</L>
<L>Yet unrelinquishing, and sorrows mists</L>
<L>Dispell'd, which o'er the breast of Innocence</L>
<L><PB N="190" REF="188"/>
Flit like a cloud across the summer sky;</L>
<L N="500">To happier mansions, objects of delight,</L>
<L>And joyful prospects, turn! to where thy Child</L>
<L>Hath, by Inoculation, overcome</L>
<L>The Plague Variolous! As Hercules</L>
<L>The spotted Snakes defeating, transport flush'd</L>
<L>Alcmena's glowing cheek, so over thine</L>
<L>I see the kindled radiance. Whether born</L>
<L>In Ethiopic wilds, or mid the sands</L>
<L>Of parch'd Arabia, or where spread the shores</L>
<L>Girding the Caspian; from his natal place,</L>
<L N="510">Pursuing Mahomet's wide-wasting arms,</L>
<L>The Monster rush'd on Europe, pale dismay,</L>
<L>Horror, and Death rapacious in his train.</L>
<L>For many a Century, without controul,</L>
<L>When ragid his fury, by pernicious skies</L>
<L>Aroused, or propagated far and wide</L>
<L>By fell Contagion, He destroy'd Mankind.</L>
<L>The Cities groan'd; The Matron o'er her Babe</L>
<L>In unavailing trance of anguish hung.</L>
<L>The Lover offer'd up his fruitless vows,</L>
<L N="520"><PB N="191" REF="189"/>
And wearied Heaven importunately fond,</L>
<L>To save the Beauty which his soul adored.</L>
<L>The Babe, the Mother's self, became his prey;</L>
<L>The Youth, and Virgin, sunk into the tomb.</L>
<L>If life were granted, beauty was effaced;</L>
<L>Each decent feature, tumid, and enlarged,</L>
<L>Roughen'd, or dented with unseemly scars.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MEDICINE was whelm'd with shame; the Roman page</L>
<L>Was silent, nor the Grecian could afford</L>
<L>An antidote for evils Grecia's Sons</L>
<L N="530">Had ne'er imagined. Rhazes wrote in vain;</L>
<L>And even Sydenham's efforts had their bounds.</L>
<L>For the cold lymph by Prejudice was shunn'd;</L>
<L>And Sydenham, tho He oft by freer air</L>
<L>Tamed the devouring heat, and shook the throne</L>
<L>Of learned Ignorance, declaring war</L>
<L>Against it's regimen, adverse to life,</L>
<L>And compounds teeming with destructive fire,</L>
<L>Alexipharmic poisons; could not change</L>
<L>The rank malignant nature of the Pest:</L>
<L N="540"><PB N="192" REF="190"/>
Which still, when favouring constitutions reign'd</L>
<L>And in peculiar Habits, all his art</L>

<L>THE triumph was reserved for Female hands;</L>
<L>Thine was the deed, accomplish'd MONTAGUE!</L>
<L>What Physic ne'er conjectured, What described</L>
<L>By Pylarini, by Timoni sketch'd,</L>
<L>Seem'd to Philosophy an idle tale,</L>
<L>Or curious only; She by patriot love</L>
<L N="550">Inspired, and England rising to her view</L>
<L>Proved as a truth, and proved it on her Son.</L>
<L>A manly Mind where reason dwelt supreme</L>
<L>Was Her's the little terrors of her sex</L>
<L>Despising, by maternal fondness sway'd,</L>
<L>Yet bold, where confidence had stable grounds.</L>
<L>How far superior to the turbann'd Race</L>
<L>With whom She sojourn'd, scrupulous, and weak!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="193" REF="191"/>
<L>YET, this is She, whom Pope's illiberal verse</L>
<L>Hath dared to censure with malicious spleen,</L>
<L N="560">And meanly-coward soul. Redoubled Bard!</L>
<L>What hath thy satire, tho it often flow</L>
<L>Happy, and poignant, with Horatian ease,</L>
<L>What hath thy moral lay, tho pure, and just,</L>
<L>And elegant, of profit e'er produced,</L>
<L>Of high advantage to thy natal Land,</L>
<L>Compared with her bequest? Thy numbers charm</L>
<L>The listening ear, and with thy polisht stile</L>
<L>Taste is enamour'd; She hath been the cause</L>
<L>Of heart-felt joy to thousands, thousands live,</L>
<L N="570">And still shall live thro her; thy song can please</L>
<L>None but the Sons of Britain; or the Few,</L>
<L>Of nice, and studious leisure; She unlock'd</L>
<L>The springs of satisfaction and delight,</L>
<L>And with perennial comfort bless'd the World.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LET Me then urge this duty; nor to fear</L>
<L>Or superstition yielding, let thy Child</L>
<L>Encounter in his native shape the Fiend,</L>
<L><PB N="194" REF="192"/>
And brave his violence. For, whither, say,</L>
<L>To what sequester'd haunt canst Thou retreat,</L>
<L N="580">Where He will not pursue? How vain thy flight!</L>
<L>How sure thy victory, if as Art direct</L>
<L>And wise Experience, thou anticipate</L>
<L>His threaten'd blow! So when the Patriarch's arm</L>
<L>Was stretch'd to wound his Son, An Angel came,</L>
<L>And saved the victim from impending death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>GENTLE; and almost harmless is the bane</L>
<L>By Skill communicated, which regards</L>
<L>The times and seasons, nor infects the Child,</L>
<L>If to Dentition's wonted state arrived;</L>
<L N="590">For, ill the labouring frame can then endure</L>
<L>An added stimulus. Nor yet before</L>
<L>That period; lest to Epilepsy prone</L>
<L>By the contagious vapour raised, He quit</L>
<L>Sudden the precincts warm of light and life.</L>
<L>This too the cold of winter bids Us shun,</L>
<L>Potent the vessels to contract, increase</L>
<L>Their tonic force, and in the system stir</L>
<L><PB N="195" REF="193"/>
Fierce inflammation. And the summer heat;</L>
<L>By which all putrid ferments are sublimed,</L>
<L N="600">And render'd doubly fatal. These extremes</L>
<L>Avoided, in the temperate months alone</L>
<L>Let every prudent Matron be resolved</L>
<L>T' obey the call of duty, and of love.</L>
<L>Unless the dread contagion, thickening round,</L>
<L>Impell them to neglect each guarded rule,</L>
<L>Yielding by force to peril's just alarm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NEED We, in this our Aera, when mature,</L>
<L>And vigorous, reason prospers, groundless fears</L>
<L>Oppose by arguments? the groundless fears</L>
<L N="610">Of fondness, or religion? In thy mind</L>
<L>No terror should, or can with justice dwell,</L>
<L>But lest, as naturally seen, by Art</L>
<L>Unmodified, uncheck'd, the stern Disease</L>
<L>Should thy young Charge assault. If He escape,</L>
<L>His lot is fortunate. Assaulted thus,</L>
<L>Oft, from an Hundred only, many die.</L>
<L>From many Hundreds, None, or one perchance,</L>
<L><PB N="196" REF="194"/>
Of those inoculated. Why should thine</L>
<L>Be the poor solitary One? If death</L>
<L N="620">Follow a treatment, which can soothe the Pest,</L>
<L>And meliorate it's nature, could his life</L>
<L>Be granted to thy fervent prayer, when arm'd,</L>
<L>And with it's proper rage it took the field?</L>
<L>This be thy source of comfort. Nor believe</L>
<L>That Providence is tempted by the deed.</L>
<L>From Providence flows reason to Mankind;</L>
<L>And Reason teaches Us to fly from ill,</L>
<L>And covet good. Th' invention, the success,</L>
<L>Is the true warrant of approving Heaven.</L>
<L N="630">Who would not rather cross a shallow frith,</L>
<L>When first the rising tide begins, than wait</L>
<L>Hemm'd in a nook, till with impetuous force</L>
<L>It sweep Him from his station? Who refuse</L>
<L>By Franklin's pointed rod, to draw the stream</L>
<L>Of lightning on their roofs, because the cloud</L>
<L>Might harmless pass above? thus safe convey'd,</L>
<L>In unterrific silence, to the ground.</L>

<L>THO rare th' Examples now, and scatter'd, mark</L>
<L>Th' unhappy Beings, who from idle dread,</L>
<L N="640">Or weak maternal love, in Childhood's state</L>
<L>This boon received not; and who sharing yet</L>
<L>Th' hereditary feelings, want themselves</L>
<L>Firmness of soul th' omission to supply.</L>
<L>Mark, where they pine in solitude, oppresst</L>
<L>By anxious thought; to whom Man's cheerful Race</L>
<L>Affords no joy; the voice of Music breathes</L>
<L>It's choral notes unheard; the stage displays</L>
<L>The living manners, and th' assembly beams</L>
<L>With sprightliness and elegance, in vain.</L>
<L N="650">The City, nay the Village bounds they fly,</L>
<L>And shift from place to place, as from the pack</L>
<L>Of clamorous Hounds and Men, in wild affright</L>
<L>The trembling Hare. Oh! never may thy Sons,</L>
<L>Thy Daughters, thus be cursed! in early life</L>
<L>By thee from all these future horrors freed!</L>
<L>The mirthful croud, with innocence of heart</L>
<L>Joining well-pleased; the gay, the social hour</L>
<L>Nor shunning, nor desiring, but awhile</L>
<L><PB N="198" REF="196"/>
To soften care; or fit the soul for acts,</L>
<L N="660">By relaxation due, of nobler kind.</L>
<L>Endow'd by Thee with comeliness, no trace</L>
<L>Of this abhorr'd Distemper left behind,</L>
<L>And all it's wonted ravages defied.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FOR MONTAGUE again the verse prepare,</L>
<L>And bring th' harmonious strain! Why thro the realms</L>
<L>Of Europe are not votive Statues placed</L>
<L>Honouring their Benefactress? From the straits</L>
<L>Of Gades, south, to where the towers ascend</L>
<L>Of famed Petropolis? Or, crossing wide</L>
<L N="670">Th' Atlantic foam, why in the new-found World,</L>
<L>Which more to Her, than it's Discoverer, owes,</L>
<L>Appears no structure sacred to her praise?</L>
<L>Yet, shall Imagination rear the dome,</L>
<L>And fix th' expressive marble. Hither come,</L>
<L>Ye Nymphs, and Swains, with flowery garlands deck'd</L>
<L>Your polisht foreheads; on the shaven green</L>
<L>Which fronts the Temple, ply your nimble feet,</L>
<L>The jocund dance inweaving! Hither come,</L>
<L><PB N="199" REF="197"/>
Ye Fauns and Dryads! Hither, glowing Love,</L>
<L N="680">And spotless Beauty! Youth, with radiant eye,</L>
<L>And blooming Health! While underneath the beech</L>
<L>Or oak, which waves it's consecrated shade,</L>
<L>Humanity, and Wisdom, smiling view</L>
<L>The festive Throng, mid whom the Graces play.</L>
<L>And quitting their proud bowers, and lofty hill,</L>
<L>The Muses utter notes divinely sweet,</L>
<L>Such as of yore They sung, when Gratitude</L>
<L>Tuned to the Friends and Patrons of mankind</L>
<L>The genuine lyre, ennobled by it's theme.</L>
