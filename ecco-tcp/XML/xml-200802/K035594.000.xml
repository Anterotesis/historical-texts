<P>AN ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF <HI>The Honourable Sir WILLIAM JONES,</HI> A JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE IN BENGAL, AND PRESIDENT OF THE ASIATIC SOCIETY.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the very moment, when I was concluding the Notes to this Elegy, I received an Elegiac Poem on the same subject, by a Gentleman, whose extensive knowledge of Indian Literature, and whose acquaint∣ance with its lamented Patron, induced me to peruse his Publication with peculiar eagerness. There is so much poetical merit in the animated and graceful tribute, which Mr. MAURICE has paid to the me∣mory of Sir WILLIAM JONES, that, had I seen it before the completion of these Stanzas, it might have induced me to relinquish a subject pre∣engaged by a Writer so peculiarly qualified to treat it with success. Yet the literary excellence of Sir WILLIAM JONES appears to require some kind of homage from every man of letters; and by the spirit of Mr. MAURICE'S performance, I am persuaded, that our common regard for the Character we commemorate, is so sincere and ingenuous, that we must rejoice in a multiplicity of offerings to a name so entitled to univer¦sal praise.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">"Echoing the liberal voice of friendly Shore."</HEAD>
<P>THE honourable Sir JOHN SHORE, who succeeded Sir WIL∣LIAM JONES as president of the Asiatic society, delivered, in his first address to that assembly, a very just and eloquent eulogium on his accomplished predecessor.—Some lines in the preceding stanza allude to the following passage in the discourse of Sir JOHN SHORE.</P>
<P><Q>The Pandits, who were in the habit of attending him (Sir WM. JONES) when I saw them after his death, at a public Durbar, could neither suppress their tears for his loss, nor find terms to express their admiration at the wonderful progress he had made in their sciences.</Q></P>
<P>I shall embrace with pleasure every opportunity of illustrating this poem, and of honouring the justly lamented personage, whom it aspires to celebrate, by unreserved quotation of the manly and graceful panegyric, from which I have transcribed the preceding paragraph.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">"Early to thee obedient Language brought."</HEAD>
<P>THE erudition of Sir WILLIAM JONES was admirable not only from its extraordinary extent, but from having been acquired, to an astonishing degree, at a very early period of life. <Q>Before the expiration of his twenty-second year (says his friend and eulo∣gist) he had compleated his Commentaries on the Poetry of the Asiatics, although a considerable time afterwards elapsed before their publication.</Q> Sir JOHN proceeds to commend this work very justly, as a compleat proof of the Author's consummate skill in a variety of languages, and as a juvenile monument of taste, ta∣lents, and application, without example. Let me add, that this early production discovers also a heart full of gentle affections, and a mind that already conceived and expressed its ideas with singular energy and freedom. I allude particularly to the very pathetic tri∣bute of gratitude and praise, which the Author paid, in his Prooe∣mium, to his friend and instructor, then recently deceased, (RO∣BERT SUMNER, the master of Harrow school) and to the two fol∣lowing passages of the book; in the first he is speaking of satire, in the second of heroic poetry. <Q>Atqui ut aperte dicam quod sentio, valde invitus in poetarum chorum satyricos, ut vocan∣tur, ascribo.

<P>THE life of NADER SHAH, an Eastern Manuscript, brought to England by the King of Denmark. It was translated into French, at the request of that monarch, by Sir WILLIAM JONES, who at first declined the task, <Q>alledging for his excuse the length of the book, the dryness of the subject, the difficulty of the style, &amp;c.:</Q> but he was at last induced to undertake it by the most liberal motives; and chiefly by the following consideration, expressed in his own words, <Q>That it would be a reflection upon this country, if the King should be obliged to carry the manu∣script into France.</Q> The French version, executed by our in∣comparable linguist, was published in 1770, when the translator had attained only his 24th year.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">"What generous plaints of indignation burst."</HEAD>
<P>THIS verse alludes to the following passage, towards the close of an admirable Preface to the Life of NADER SHAH, new modelled for the benefit of the English reader, and published in 1773:</P>
<Q><PB N="26" REF="26"/>
It is a painful consideration, that the profession of Literature, by far the most laborious of any, leads to no real benefit or true glory whatsoever. Poetry, Science, Letters, when they are not made the sole business of life, may become its ornaments in pros∣perity, and its most pleasing consolation in a change of fortune; but if a man addicts himself entirely to learning, and hopes by <HI>that</HI> either to raise a family, or to acquire, what so many wish for, and so few ever attain, an honourable retirement in his declining age, he will find, when it is too late, that he has mistaken his path; that other labours, other studies are neces∣sary; and that unless he can assert his own independence in active life, it will avail him little to be favoured by the learned, esteemed by the eminent, or recommended even by kings.</Q>
<P>These reflections can hardly be suggested too frequently to the consideration of those ingenuous youths, who happen to have con∣ceived a very ardent passion for literature. It was happy for our great Orientalist, that his own peculiar energy of mind enabled him to form such reflections at an early period of life, before the gates of professional prosperity were barred against his laudable ambition; otherwise it is but too probable, that with unexampled hoards of erudition, united to a most benevolent temper, he might have pined in a state of neglect and mortification, instead of rising to be one of the most conspicuous and most useful characters in the polished age, which his writings have contributed to enlighten and adorn.</P>
<P>I cannot close this note without remarking, that the Preface to the English Life of NADER SHAH, which gave rise to it, contains many excellent remarks on historical writing. It was the custom of our universal scholar to delineate, in a philosophic and masterly survey, the province of literature, to which the object of his im∣mediate labour belonged. Thus to his volume of Asiatic Poems he has added two admirable Essays on Poetry; and his translation of ISAEUS is elucidated by a prefatory discourse, and a commentary
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
replete with legal and classical information. As a writer, both of verse and prose, his consummate knowledge of languages enabled him to vary and adapt his style to his subject with all the graces of exquisite propriety.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE 8. STANZA XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">"With pensive zeal, and exultation just."</HEAD>
<P>THESE lines allude to the following very pleasing description, which Sir WILLIAM JONES has given of his approach to India, in his first public discourse as President of the Asiatic Society.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="28"/>
"When I was at sea last August, on my voyage to this country, which I had long and ardently desired to visit, I found one even∣ing, on inspecting the observations of the day, that India lay be∣fore us, and Persia on our left, while a breeze from Arabia blew nearly on our stern. A situation so pleasing in itself, and to me so new, could not fail to awaken a train of reflections in a mind, which had early been accustomed to contemplate with delight the eventful histories, and agreeable fictions of this Eastern world. It gave me inexpressible pleasure to find myself in the midst of so noble an amphitheatre, almost encircled by the vast regions of Asia, which has ever been esteemed the nurse of sciences, the in∣ventress of delightful and useful arts, the scene of glorious actions, fertile in the productions of human genius, abounding in natural wonders, and infinitely diversified in the forms of religion and go∣vernment, in the laws, manners, customs, and languages, as well as in the features and complexions of men; I could not help remark∣ing how important and extensive a field was yet unexplored, and how many solid advantages unimproved."—<HI>Asiatick Researches,</HI> vol. i. p. 9.</P>
<P>These reflections led Sir WILLIAM, by degrees, to the founda∣tion of the Asiatic Society, and never was a man more happily qualified, by nature and education, to be the founder and the guide of such a respectable institution; since, in addition to his own sin∣gular talents for the rapid acquisition and ready communication of knowledge, he was distinguished by such engaging manners as en∣abled him most happily to call forth and encourage the faculties of all around him. His unrivalled erudition was so far from ren∣dering him dogmatical or repulsive, that no man ever spoke with more genuine modesty of his own merit; no man could exert more candour and liberality in estimating the merit of others. In his writings, the rare extent of his knowledge is always accom∣panied by an equally rare sweetness and generosity of spirit, which give a peculiar charm to his composition, whenever he has occa∣sion
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>
to mention an author distinguished in the branch of literature immediately before him. A striking instance of this spirit occurs to my recollection in his Essay on the Law of Bailments, where he describes the legal treatises of a venerable French professor and judge, M. Pothier, in a strain of applause uncommonly animated and graceful.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="note">
<HEAD>NOTE 9. STANZA XXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">"But from thy toil's variety and weight."</HEAD>
<P>A YOUNG Student may find a most pleasing incentive to mental exertion, in contemplating the very wonderful literary acquisitions and atchievements of Sir WILLIAM JONES; a regular and minute enumeration and estimate of these we may hope to see from the leisure of some accomplished individual among his many Asiatic friends, whom an intimate acquaintance with his extensive labours, and an equal affection for his endearing virtues, may engage in the office of his Biographer. The Memorial of Sir JOHN SHORE is an excellent prelude to such a work. Sir JOHN, after mention∣ing his predecessor's most remarkable productions, inserts in his discourse a paper entitled <HI>"Desiderata,"</HI> a list of 23 curious and important projected works, relating to India, Arabia, China, and Tartary. On this paper of his departed friend he makes the fol∣lowing observation:</P>
<P>"We are not authorized to conclude, that he had himself form∣ed a determination to compleat the works which his genius and knowledge had thus sketched; the task seems to require a period beyond the probable duration of any human life; but we, who had the happiness to know Sir WILLIAM JONES, who were wit∣nesses of his indefatigable perseverance in the pursuit of know∣ledge, and of his ardour to accomplish whatever he deemed im∣portant: who saw the extent of his intellectual powers, his won∣derful attainments in literature and science, and the facility with
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
which all his compositions were made, cannot doubt, if it had pleased Providence to protract the date of his existence, that he would have ably executed much of what he had so extensively planned.</P>
<P>It cannot be deemed useless or superfluous to enquire, by what arts or method he was enabled to attain to a degree of know∣ledge almost universal, and apparently beyond the powers of man, during a lise little exceeding forty-seven years.</P>
<P>"The faculties of his mind, by nature vigorous, were improved by constant exercise, and his memory, by habitual practice, had acquired a capacity of retaining whatever had been once impressed upon it. To an unextinguished ardour for universal knowledge, he joined a perseverance in the pursuit of it, which subdued all obstacles; his studies began with the dawn, and during the inter∣mission of professional duties, were continued throughout the day. Reflection and meditation strengthened and confirmed what indus∣try and investigation had accumulated. It was a fixt principle with him, from which he never voluntarily deviated, not to be deterred, by any difficulties that were surmountable, from prose∣cuting to a successful termination, what he had once deliberately undertaken.</P>
<P>"But what appears to me to have enabled him to employ his ta∣lents so much to his own and the public advantage, was the regu∣lar allotment of his time to particular occupations, and a scrupu∣lous adherence to the distribution which he had fixed; hence all his studies were pursued without interruption or confusion. Nor can I here omit remarking, what may probably have attracted your observation as well as mine, the candour and complacency with which he gave his attention to all persons, of whatsoever quality, talent, or education: he justly concluded, that curious or important information might be gained from the illiterate; and wherever it was to be obtained, he sought and seized it."</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="31"/>
In the very brief list of eminent men, who have compleatly united the opposite advantages arising from a life of business and a life of meditation, perhaps Cicero is the personage, who may be most properly compared with Sir WILLIAM JONES. The great Roman has been often considered as without a parallel in the di∣versity and magnitude of his mental accomplishments; yet who will now hesitate to declare, that, in extent of erudition, in elegance and energy of mind, and above all in the tenderness and integrity of his private and public life, he was far from being superior to our accomplished countryman.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE 10. STANZA XXXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">"Thine the loud torrent of her Epic song."</HEAD>
<P>THE commentaries on Asiatic poetry contain a very spirited Latin version of a passage from the Persian Heroic Poem of FER∣DUSI, whom the poetical Commentator describes as a rival of Homer. <Q>Nullum est ab Europaeis scriptum poema, quod ad Homeri dignitatem et quasi caelestem ardorem proprius acce∣dat.</Q> A large portion of FERDUSI has since appeared in an English dress, but, I fear, without obtaining in England, either for the Persian Homer, or the English Poet his translator, the admi∣ration due to original genius, or the just recompence of elegant labour. Let me add, however, that JONES'S specimen of the Per∣sian Epic Poetry attracted the notice, and obtained the praise of learned foreigners: it is inserted by the Abate TODERINI, in his copious and entertaining work, entitled, Letteratura Turchesea, with the following commendation:</P>
<P>"Ferdusi maraviglioso poeta epico, onor della Persiana poesia, nel suo libro Sha Nama eroicamente descrive le geste degli eroi <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dei re Persiani.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">"Menu and Calidasa, grace the scene."</HEAD>
<P>FROM an ardent and truly noble desire to befriend the natives of that country, where he was appointed to administer justice, Sir WILLIAM JONES was led "to suggest to government a work of national utility and importance, the compilation of a copious digest of Hindu and Mahommedan laws, from Sanscrit and Arabic originals, with an offer of his services to superintend the compi∣lation, and with a promise to translate it.—To the superinten∣dance of this work, which was immediately undertaken at his suggestion, he assiduously devoted those hours, which he could spare from his professional duties.</P>
<P>"During the course of this compilation, and as auxiliary to it, he was led to study the works of MENU, reputed by the Hindus to be the oldest and holiest of legislators, and finding them to com∣prize a system of religious and civil duties, and of law in all its branches, so comprehensive and minutely exact, that it might be considered as the institutes of Hindu law, he presented a transla∣tion of them to the government of Bengal."—<HI>Sir John Shore's Dis∣course.</HI></P>
<P>When Sir WILLIAM JONES enquired of "a very sensible Brah∣man which of the Indian dramas was most universally esteemed, he answered without hesitation Sacontala, supporting his opinion, as usual among the Pandits, by a couplet to this effect:</P>
<P>"The Ring of Sacontala, in which the 4th act, and four stanzas of that act are eminently brilliant, displays all the rich ex∣uberance of Calidasa's genius."</P>
<P>This circumstance induced our great Orientalist to peruse and translate Sacontala, which he has given to the public, to use his own very just expressions, "as a most pleasing and authentic pic∣ture of old Hindu manners, and one of the greatest curiosities that
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>

It constituted the principal amusement of his leisure hours. In the arrangement of Linnaeus he discovered system, truth, and science, which never failed to captivate and engage his attention, and from the proofs, which he has exhibited of his progress in Bo∣tany, we may conclude that he would have extended the disco∣veries in that science.

<P>A MILD and rational piety may be regarded as the crowning excellence of a character compleatly accomplished.

I cite with peculiar pleasure, on this article, the tes∣timony of his intelligent and worthy eulogist (Sir JOHN SHORE) who, having mentioned the marvellous variety and extent of his predecessor's mental powers, observes, that "from the most renowned poets and philosophers of Greece, Rome, and Asia, he could turn, with equal delight and knowledge, to the sublime spe∣culations of BARROW and NEWTON. With them also he professed his conviction of the truth of the Christian religion; and he justly deemed it no inconsiderable advantage, that his researches had cor∣roborated the multiplied evidence of revelation, by confirming the Mosaic account of the primitive world."</P>
<P>Let me add, that it is possible he may have rendered infinitely greater services to religion by the admirable suggestion in the close of his Discourse on the Gods of Greece, Italy, and India. He
<PB N="38" REF="38"/>
there points out what occurred to him as the only promising mode of converting the Musulmans and Hindus to Christianity; and perhaps the most worthy honour, which the Asiatic Society could pay to the memory of Sir WILLIAM JONES, would be to resume and realize his idea: the experiment is easy, and should it succeed in any degree, that success will form the noblest eulogy of the beneficent spirit, by whom it was suggested.</P>
