<P>HENRY AND EMMA, A NEW POETICAL INTERLUDE, ALTERED FROM PRIOR'S NUT BROWN MAID, WITH ADDITIONS AND A NEW AIR AND CHORUS, (THE MUSIC BY DR. ARNE.) As Performed on WEDNESDAY, APRIL 13, 1774, AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL IN COVENT-GARDEN FOR THE BENEFIT OF MRS. HARTLEY.</P>
<P>LONDON: Sold by T. DAVIES, in RUSSEL-STREET, COVENT-GARDEN, and all the Booksellers in Town and Country. 1774. [Price SIX-PENCE.]</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT needs the most humble apology from the Com∣piler of this little Interlude, for the liberties he has taken with a Poem so universally, and justly admired. The different prunings which he judged necessary for his purpose, were as sensibly lamented by the hand that performed them, as they can possibly be by the most zealous advocate for the ingenious PRIOR. These however, with various other alterations, far from being the result of self-consequence, arose from ab∣solute necessity, in order to give the whole an ap∣pearance, somewhat conformable to the laws of our drama. It was therefore found expedient likewise to introduce the two new, though trifling characters of VENUS and EUGENIUS; and to conclude the whole with an AIR and CHORUS, which are here tacked to the piece, with every conviction in the breast of the author for his presumption.</P>
<P>A transposition of some lines, an occasional addition of others, some variation of the personal pronouns, &amp;c. were judged proper to accommodate the performers, and prepare the piece for stage representation.</P>
<P>Under these circumstances it is hoped that this temporary sacrifice of PRIOR will be candidly overlooked by the Public, since it was made but to assist in some measure the modest merit of MRS. HARTLEY, and to gratify no other desire in the COMPILER.</P>

<LG>
<L>—NIGHT silent reigns: the world in sleep is laid,</L>
<L>Save HENRY, tortur'd for his <HI>Nut Brown Maid.</HI></L>
<L>He, wretched slave to love's corroding fears,</L>
<L>Greets solemn midnight with his manly tears;</L>
<L>And clad in false attire, with borrow'd name</L>
<L>Now meets the lovely object of his flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<L>From prattling infancy I train'd his mind</L>
<L>To honor's call, and virtues most refin'd.</L>
<L>Now soft repose his troubled breast forsakes,</L>
<L>Of every pang my sympathy partakes.</L>
<L>Tho' full of years I watch his sorrowing way,</L>
<L>And strive to guide him by calm reason's ray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Led by the moon's pale lamp, thro' yonder grade</L>
<L>The anxious lovers seek this beachen shade;</L>
<L>Their converse trying to fair <HI>Emma</HI>'s heart:</L>
<L>A fiction plann'd by Love's, and <HI>Henry</HI>'s art.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With wishes rais'd, with jealousies opprest,</L>
<L>(Alternate tyrants of the human breast)</L>
<L>By one great trial he resolves to prove</L>
<L>The faith of woman, and the force of love,</L>
<L>If scanning <HI>Emma</HI>'s virtues, he shall find,</L>
<L>That beauteous frame enclose a steady mind,</L>
<L>He'll fix his hope, of future joy secure,</L>
<L>And live a slave to Hymen's happy pow'r.</L>
<L>But if the fair one, as he fears is frail,</L>
<L>Light fly her merits, and her faults prevail,</L>
<L>His mind he vows to free from am'rous care,</L>
<L>Resume his arms, and shine again in war.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But soft—their mournful accents speak them nigh:</L>
<L>In spight of fond affection, I must fly.</L>
<L>May no curs'd daemon o'er their mind prevail,</L>
<L>But every thought, be weigh'd in virtue's scale!</L>

<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sincere, O tell me, hast thou felt a pain,</L>
<L><HI>Emma,</HI> beyond what woman knows to feign?</L>
<L>Has thy uncertain bosom ever strove</L>
<L>With the first tumults of a real love?</L>
<L>If so, with pity view my wretched state;</L>
<L>At least deplore, and then forget my fate:</L>
<L>To some more happy knight reserve thy charms,</L>
<L>By fortune favour'd, and successful arms:</L>
<L>For lo! these hands in murther are imbru'd;</L>
<L>These trembling feet by justice are pursu'd:</L>
<L>And I this night must fly from thee and love,</L>
<L>Condemn'd in lonely woods a banish'd man to rove.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMMA.</SPEAKER>
<L>What is true passion, if unblest it dies?</L>
<L>And where is <HI>Emma</HI>'s joy, if <HI>Henry</HI> flies?</L>
<L>If love, alas! be pain, the pain I bear,</L>
<L>No thought can figure, and no tongue declare.</L>
<L>Oh cease then coldly to suspect my love;</L>
<L>And let my deed at least my faith approve.</L>
<L>Alas! no youth shall my endearments share;</L>
<L>Nor day, nor night shall interrupt my care:</L>
<L>Nor to hard banishment shall <HI>Henry</HI> run;</L>
<L>While careless <HI>Emma</HI> sleeps on beds of down.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="7"/>
View me resolv'd, where'er thou lead'st, to go;</L>
<L>Friend to thy pain and partner of thy woe;</L>
<L>Blest when my dangers and my toils have shewn,</L>
<L>That I of all mankind, could love but thee alone.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Let prudence yet obstruct thy vent'rous way;</L>
<L>And take good heed, what men will think, and say:</L>
<L>That full of youthful blood, and fond of man,</L>
<L>You to the woodland with an exile ran.</L>
<L>Reflect, that lessen'd fame is ne'er regain'd;</L>
<L>And virgin honour once, is always stain'd.</L>
<L>Timely advis'd, the coming evil shun;</L>
<L>Better not do the deed, than weep it done.</L>
<L>No penance can absolve our guilty fame;</L>
<L>Nor tears, that wash out sin, can wash out shame.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMMA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Let <HI>Emma</HI>'s hapless case be falsely told</L>
<L>By the rash young, or the ill-natur'd old:</L>
<L>Let ev'ry tongue its various censure chuse,</L>
<L>Absolve with coldness, or with spight accuse.</L>
<L>Fair truth at last her radiant beams will raise;</L>
<L>And malice vanquish'd heighten virtue's praise.</L>
<L>Let then thy favour but indulge my flight;</L>
<L>O let my presence make thy travels light.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<L>But canst thou wield the sword, and bend the bow?</L>
<L>With active force repel the sturdy foe?</L>
<L>When the loud tumult speaks the battle nigh;</L>
<L>And winged deaths in whistling arrows fly;</L>
<L>Wilt thou, tho' wounded, yet undaunted stay;</L>
<L>Perform thy part and share the dang'rous day?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMMA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Near thee, mistrust not, constant I'll abide,</L>
<L>And share each danger fearless by thy side.</L>
<L>Tho' my inferior strength may not allow,</L>
<L>That I should bear, or draw the warrior bow,</L>
<L>With ready hand I will the shaft supply;</L>
<L>And joy to see thy victor arrows fly:</L>
<L>Touch'd in the battle by the hostile reed,</L>
<L>Should'st thou (but heav'n avert it!) should'st thou bleed;</L>
<L>To stop the wounds my finest lawn I'd tear;</L>
<L>Wash them with tears, and wipe them with my hair.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<L>But canst thou tender maid, canst thou sustain</L>
<L>Afflictive want, or hunger's pressing pain?</L>
<L>When with hard toil we seek our ev'ning food,</L>
<L>Berries and acorns, from the neighb'ring wood;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="9"/>
And find amongst the cliffs no other house,</L>
<L>But the thin covert of some gather'd boughs;</L>
<L>Wilt thou not then reluctant send thine eye</L>
<L>Around the dreary waste, and weeping try,</L>
<L>(Tho' then, alas! that trial be too late)</L>
<L>To find thy father's hospitable gate,</L>
<L>That gate, whence long excluded thou must mourn;</L>
<L>That gate, for ever barr'd to thy return?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMMA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Did I but purpose to embark with thee,</L>
<L>On the smooth surface of a summer's sea,</L>
<L>While gentle <HI>Zephyrs</HI> play in prosp'rous gales,</L>
<L>And fortune's favour fills the swelling sails;</L>
<L>But would forsake the ship, and make the shoar,</L>
<L>When the winds whistle, and the tempests roar?</L>
<L>No, <HI>Henry,</HI> no: One sacred oath has ty'd</L>
<L>Our loves; one destiny our life shall guide.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<L>But e're thou goest, unhappy'st of thy kind,</L>
<L>Thy sex and habit thou must leave behind:</L>
<L>No longer shall thy comely tresses break</L>
<L>In flowing ringlets on thy snowy neck;</L>
<L>But with a bolder stride, and looser air,</L>
<L>Mingl'd with men, a man thou must appear.</L>
<L>Vagrants and out-laws shall offend thy view;</L>
<L>(For such must be my friends) a hideous crew!</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="10"/>
With such must <HI>Emma</HI> hunt the tedious day;</L>
<L>Assist their violence, divide their prey:</L>
<L>With such she must return at setting light;</L>
<L>Tho' not partaker, witness of their night.</L>
<L>Now, <HI>Emma,</HI> now the last reflection make,</L>
<L>What thou would'st follow, what thou must forsake:</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMMA.</SPEAKER>
<L>O Grief of heart; that our unhappy fates</L>
<L>Force thee to suffer, what thy honour hates:</L>
<L>Mix thee amongst the bad; or make thee run</L>
<L>Too near the paths, which virtue bids thee shun:</L>
<L>Yet with her <HI>Henry</HI> still let <HI>Emma</HI> go;</L>
<L>With him abhor the vice, but share the woe:</L>
<L>And sure my little heart can never err,</L>
<L>Amidst the worst, if <HI>Henry</HI> still be there.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<L>O wildest thought of an abandon'd mind!</L>
<L>Name, habit, parents, woman left behind;</L>
<L>Ev'n honour dubious, thou preferr'st to go</L>
<L>Wild to the woods with me; said <HI>Emma</HI> so?</L>
<L>Or did I dream what <HI>Emma</HI> never said?</L>
<L>O guilty error! and oh wretched maid!</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="11"/>
Whose roving fancy would resolve the same</L>
<L>With him, who next should tempt her easy fame.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMMA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Are there not poisons, racks, and flames, and swords;</L>
<L>That <HI>Emma</HI> thus must die by <HI>Henry</HI>'s words?</L>
<L>Yet what could swords, or poison, racks or flame</L>
<L>But mangle, and disjoint this brittle frame?</L>
<L>More fatal <HI>Henry</HI>'s words; they murder <HI>Emma</HI>'s fame.</L>
<L>Did e'er my tongue speak my unguarded heart</L>
<L>The least inclin'd to play the wanton's part?</L>
<L>Did e'er my eye one inward thought reveal,</L>
<L>Which angels might not hear, and virgins tell?</L>
<L>And hast thou, <HI>Henry,</HI> in my conduct known</L>
<L>One fault, but that which I must ever own</L>
<L>That I, of all mankind have lov'd but thee alone?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>Vainly thou talk'st of loving me alone;</L>
<L>Each man is man, and all the sex is one.</L>
<L>Nor in love's ritual can we ever find</L>
<L>Vows made to last, or promises to bind.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="12"/>
Be wise, and false; shun trouble, seek delight;</L>
<L>Change thou the first; nor wait thy lovers flight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why shouldst thou weep? let Nature judge our case:</L>
<L>I saw thee young, and fair: pursu'd the chase</L>
<L>Of youth, and beauty; I another saw</L>
<L>Fairer, and younger; yielding to the law</L>
<L>Of our all-ruling mother, I pursu'd</L>
<L>More youth, more beauty: blest vicissitude!</L>
</LG>

<L>This younger, fairer, pleads her rightful charms,</L>
<L>With present power compels me to her arms.</L>

<L>Are we in life thro' one great error led?</L>
<L>Is each man perjur'd, and each nymph betray'd?</L>
<L>Of the superior sex art thou the worst?</L>
<L>Am I of mine the most compleatly curst?</L>
<L>Yet let me go with thee, and going prove,</L>
<L>From what I will endure, how much I love.</L>

<L>Rescue my poor remains from vile neglect,</L>
<L>With virgin honours let my herse be deck'd;</L>
<L>Oh let my <HI>Henry</HI> then at least persuade</L>
<L>This happy nymph, that <HI>Emma</HI> may be laid,</L>
<L>Where thou, dear author of my death, where she,</L>

<L>No time, no change, no future flame shall move</L>
