A TOUR Through the ISLAND of <HI>GREAT BRITAIN.</HI> VOL. II.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I. Containing a <HI>DESCRIPTION</HI> of the North Shores of the Counties of <HI>Cornwall</HI> and <HI>Devon,</HI> and some Parts of <HI>Somersetshire, Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, Gloucestershire, Buckinghamshire,</HI> and <HI>Berkshire.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> NOW turned about to the East; and as, when I went West, I kept to the Southern Coast of this long County of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and of <HI>Devonshire</HI> also, so in going East, I shall keep the North Shore. The first Place of any Note, we came to, was <HI>St. Ive</HI>'s, a pretty good Town, and grown rich by the Fishing Trade; it is situated on the West-side of a deep Bay, called <HI>St. Ives-bay,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
from the Town. This Bay is opposite, on the Land∣side, to <HI>Mount</HI>'s-<HI>bay,</HI> which I spoke of in my last; but it is filled up with Sands, and here is but very little Trade in any thing else but <HI>Cornish</HI> Slate.</P>
<P>It is a very pleasant View we have at <HI>Madern-hills,</HI> and the Plain by them, in the Way from the <HI>Land's-end</HI> to <HI>St. Ives</HI>; where we have a Prospect of the Ocean at the <HI>Land's-end,</HI> West; of the <HI>British</HI> Chanel at <HI>Mount's-bay,</HI> South; and the <HI>Bristol</HI> Chanel, or <HI>Severn</HI> Sea, North. At <HI>St. Ives</HI> the Land between the Two Bays, being not above Four or Five Miles over, is so situated, that upon the Hill neither of the Two Seas are above Three Miles off, and very plain to be seen; and so likewise, in a clear Day, are the Islands of <HI>Scilly,</HI> tho' above 30 Miles off.</P>
<P>The Country from hence to <HI>Padstow</HI> is both fruit∣ful and pleasant, and several Houses of Gentlemen are seen as we pass; the Sands also are very agreeable to the Eye, and to travel upon: among the Gentle∣mens Houses is <HI>Lanhidrock,</HI> the Seat of the Earls of <HI>Radnor,</HI> who are Barons of <HI>Truro,</HI> and were so, long before they obtained the Title of <HI>Radnor</HI>; also a good House belonging to the antient Family of <HI>Trefusis.</HI></P>
<P>The Hills are fruitful of Tin, Copper and Lead, all the Way on our Right-hand; the Product of which is carried all to the other Shore; so that we shall have little to say of it here. The chief Business on this Shore is the Herring Fishing; the Herrings about <HI>October</HI> come driving up the <HI>Severn</HI> Sea, and from the Coast of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in prodigious Shoals, and beat all upon this Coast as high as <HI>Bidiford</HI> and <HI>Barn∣stable</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> and are caught in great Quan∣tities by the Fishermen, chiefly on Account of the Merchants of <HI>Falmouth, Foy, Plymouth,</HI> and other Ports on the South.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4"/><HI>St. Michael's,</HI> or <HI>Modishole,</HI> a mean Portreeve Borough, is not now remarkable, but was of great Note in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Time, and has still a Market weekly, and a yearly Fair.</P>
<P>We then came to <HI>St. Columb's,</HI> a little Market-town, a Lordship belonging to the <HI>Arundels</HI> of <HI>Wardour</HI>; so called, to distinguish them from the <HI>Arundels</HI> of <HI>Trerice</HI> in this County; which Family, espousing the King's Side in the Civil Wars, suffered much, and was innobled in <HI>Charles</HI> II.'s Time. The <HI>Wardour</HI> Family was likewise loyal, and suffered in the same Cause.</P>
<P>Near this Place is a Hill, which has a Rampire on the Summit of it, and a Causeway leading to it. 'Tis an old <HI>Danish</HI> Camp, and called <HI>Castellum Danis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Padstow</HI> is a large Town, and stands on a very good Harbour for such Shipping as use the <HI>Irish</HI> Trade. The Harbour is the Mouth of the River <HI>Camel,</HI> or <HI>Camal,</HI> which rising at <HI>Camelford,</HI> runs down by <HI>Bodmyn</HI> to <HI>Wadbridge,</HI> a little Town, where a large Stone Bridge of about Eight Arches is built by the Contributions of the Country Gentle∣men, at the Motion, and under the Direction, of one <HI>Nicolas Lovibond,</HI> Vicar of <HI>Wadbridge,</HI> the Passage over the River before being very dangerous, and having occasioned the Loss of some Lives, as well as Goods.</P>
<P>The Passage from this Town of <HI>Padstow</HI> to <HI>Ire∣land</HI> is said, by Writers, to be no more than Twenty-four Hours; but this, if ever done, hat been so sel∣dom, that it ought not to be mentioned as generally the Case; for I believe not one in Twenty-four Ships makes its Voyage in so few Hours; and that they are oftener Five or Six Days in the Passage. Here is a very antient Seat, like a Castle, of a Family of the Name of <HI>Prideaux,</HI> the Chief of which, in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, built this noble Seat there.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5"/>Higher within the Land lies the Market and Borough Town of <HI>Bodmyn,</HI> formerly one of the Coining Towns of Tin, till it lost that Privilege to <HI>Lestwithyel:</HI> However it still injoys several Ad∣vantages, some of which are Tokens of its Anti∣quity. It is pretty large, and stands between two Hills in a good Air. It had antiently several Churches, of which now only one remains, which belonged to the Priory, and is at present the Parish Church. A kind of Carnival is kept here yearly, in <HI>July,</HI> whither great Numbers of People resort.</P>
<P>The Coinage Towns were, in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, Four; namely,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Leskard,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Lestwithyel,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Truro,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Helston.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Since that, in King <HI>James</HI>'s Time, was added <HI>Pensance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Camelford</HI> is a mean, but antient Borough-town. Here the River <HI>Camel</HI> rises, which takes its Name from the <HI>British</HI> Word <HI>Cam, i. e.</HI> crooked. It has not either Church or Chapel in it, nor ever had. It is only remarkable for two great Battles which were fought here, one between King <HI>Arthur</HI> and his Nephew <HI>Mordred,</HI> and the other between the <HI>Britons</HI> and <HI>Saxons.</HI></P>
<P>The Borough of <HI>Bossiney,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Trevena,</HI> is but a small Village. It is famous only for the splendid Ruins of an impregnable Castle, built on the Rock, which stood partly on the Continent, and partly on an Island, joined together by a Draw∣bridge. The Castle was the Seat of the <HI>British</HI> Princes, and since, of the Dukes of <HI>Cornwall.</HI> And, 'tis said, <HI>Arthur</HI> was born here, and died in one of the above-mentioned Battles near <HI>Camelford.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Launceston,</HI> which is a Corruption of the <HI>British</HI> Word <HI>Lanstuphadon,</HI> i. e. <HI>St. Stephen</HI>'s Church; is a Market and Borough-town, pretty neat, and is
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
situate on a rising Ground, at the Extremity of the County, on the Borders of <HI>Devonshire:</HI> great Part of it is very old, ragged and decayed.</P>
<P>When <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Cornwall</HI> had the Govern∣ment of this County, this was a Frontier Town, well walled about, and fortified, and had also a noble Castle, which, from its Strength, was called <HI>Castle Terrible.</HI> The Inhabitants, for the Defence and Repair of it, held formerly the Lands here by <HI>Castle-guard.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI>'s good Fortune failed him, and he was forced by <HI>Fairfax</HI> to disband his Army.</P>
<P>Not far from hence is <HI>Hengeston-hill,</HI> which pro∣duces a great Plenty of <HI>Cornish</HI> Diamonds. The <HI>Cornish Britons</HI> joined the <HI>Danes</HI> here, to drive out the <HI>Saxons</HI> from <HI>Devonshire</HI>; but were totally de∣feated by <HI>Egbert</HI> in 831, which, 'tis conjectured, gives the Name of <HI>Hengist</HI> to this Hill, in Comme∣moration of their first Leader.</P>
<P><HI>Newport</HI> is a little Village adjoining, and was formerly Part of <HI>Launceston</HI>; and yet sends Two Members to Parliament. And indeed there are no less than Forty-four, and the Number of Electors are so few in many of the Places, that an Admi∣nistration, of which Side soever it be, as to Party, has usually a great Reliance on the Elections in this County every new Parliament, in order to obtain a Majority in the House of Commons: For Forty-four Members from hence, and Forty-five from an∣other Part of the Island, who generally go one way, make no small Figure in a Question: And in this Case it may not be improperly observed, that the two Extremities of the Island, let the other Parts go as they will, are generally united in the same way of Thinking, or at least of Acting, in all Political Debates, and are likely to be so in all Times to come.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7"/>There is a fine Image or Figure of <HI>Mary Magda∣len,</HI> upon the Tower of the Church at <HI>Launceston,</HI> to which the Papists fail not to pay Reverence, as they pass by. There is no Tin, Copper or Lead found hereabouts, as I could hear, nor any Manu∣facture in the Place. There are a pretty many Attorneys here, who manage Business for the rest of their Fraternity at the Assizes: As to Trade, it has not much to boast of, and yet there are People enough in it to excuse those who call it a populous Place. There is a long Nook of the County runs North from this Place, called the <HI>Hundred of</HI> Strat∣ton, in which there is one Market-town, named <HI>Stratton</HI>; but it has nothing in or about it worth remarking, except only <HI>Stow-house,</HI> built by the Earl of <HI>Bath,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and as to its Finishings within, not inferior to any in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> The Carvings, especially those of the Chapel; the grand Alcove, and some of the best Rooms, were done by the Hand of <HI>Michael Chuke,</HI> and are not excelled by <HI>Gibbon</HI> himself. The Landschape, and Sea-pieces, of which there were a great Number, (particularly in the great Stairs, a Prospect of <HI>Ply∣mouth,</HI> containing 22 Feet by 12) were the Work of <HI>Vandeist.</HI> The Situation of this stately Palace renders it a disagreeable Habitation; for which Rea∣son the Owners have disposed of the Materials, and it is now (<HI>Nov.</HI> 1739) pulling to Pieces. Near this Town, Sir <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> defeated the Parliament Forces under the Command of Major-General <HI>Chud∣leigh,</HI> and took him Prisoner; for which he was made Baron <HI>Stratton.</HI> 'Tis said, the Place where this Bat∣tle was fought, produced a prodigious Crop of Barley of 10 or 12 Ears on a Stalk, the next Year.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Bodmyn,</HI> is to be seen the Set of monumental Stones, called <HI>The Hurlers</HI>; which Dr. <HI>Stukeley</HI> says, are, out of Doubt, Remains of an antient <HI>Druid</HI> Temple. Probably they are called by
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
this Name, from the Game of Hurling, practised in these Parts; the Country People giving them that for want of a better; and indeed, it is said, that they have a superstitious Notion, that they were once Men, who were transformed into Stones, for playing at this Sport on a <HI>Sunday.</HI> They are oblong, rude, unhewn Stones, pitched on one End upon the Ground. They stand on a Down in Three Circles, the Centres whereof are in a right Line, the middle-most Circle the greatest.</P>
<P>Now I have mentioned the <HI>Hurlers,</HI> I must take the Opportunity to describe the <HI>Hurling Match</HI>; for which the <HI>Cornish</HI> Men are so particularly famous, and which is one of their principal Recreations, tho' bar∣barous enough. A Silver Ball is generally the Prize on these Occasions. The Match is made in different Manners: for sometimes the Challenge is by Twenty or Thirty Men on a Side, and no others are to inter∣fere; at other times, when a great Number of People are assembled at a <HI>Wake</HI> or <HI>Church-Ale,</HI> the Word is given out, <HI>That</HI> Johns, Wills, <HI>and</HI> Toms, <HI>will oppose all other Names:</HI> or, at other times, <HI>That</HI> Eldest <HI>or</HI> Seconds <HI>are against all</HI> Younger Sons. And so the Ball is thrown up, and becomes the Property of that Party which carries it away to the Goal set for that Purpose.</P>
<P>But another kind of <HI>Hurling</HI> is, when an <HI>Out-ball,</HI> as they call it, is thrown up; and these Matches are generally made by Two or more neighbouring Gentle∣men, who, at a Day agreed on, bring each of them the Men of Two, Three, or more Parishes; and the Goals are then set, perhaps, Four or Five Miles distant, at some Gentlemens Houses, Towns, or the like: and here nothing is said about Matching in Number, or otherwise; but the Ball is thrown up, and a bloody Skirmish generally ensues: no Bushes, Briers, Bogs, Mud-pools, Rivers, or any other Impediments, hinder their Course, nor any
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
Friendship, Relation, or former Obligation, in the least, abates their Fury. The Party prevailing ge∣nerally present the Ball to the Gentlemen who brought them on, as a Trophy; and he, in Return, sets open his Cellar-doors, where they wash away the Blood from their Noses, and apply a Balsam to their Bruises.</P>
<P>The Wrestling in <HI>Cornwall</HI> is, indeed, a much more manly and generous Exercise; and that Clo∣sure, which they call the <HI>Cornish Hug,</HI> has made them eminent in the Wrestling Rings all over <HI>Eng∣land</HI>; as the <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk</HI> Men are, for their Dexterity at the Hand and Foot, and throwing up the Heels of their Adversary, without taking hold of him.</P>
<P>Passing the River <HI>Tamar,</HI> about Two Miles from <HI>Launceston,</HI> we enter the great County of <HI>Devon</HI>; and as it is in the most wild and barren Part of it, and where formerly Tin Mines were found, tho' now they are either quite exhausted, or not to be worked without more Charge than Profit; so we must expect it a little to resemble its neighbour County.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Tamar</HI> here abounds with fresh Salmon, which are so exceeding fat and good, that they are esteemed in both Counties above the Fish of the same Kind found in other Places; and the Quantity is so great, as supplies the Country in abundance. This is occasioned by the Mouth of the River being so very large, and the Water so deep for Two Leagues be∣fore it opens into <HI>Plymouth Sound,</HI> that the Fish have a secure Retreat in the salt Water for their Harbour and Shelter, and from thence they shoot up into the fresh Water, in vast Numbers, to cast their Spawn.</P>
<P>We ride but a few Miles in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> before we find a different Face in several respects: As, 1. More People than in <HI>Cornwall:</HI> 2. Larger Towns: 3. The People all busy, and in full Imploy upon their Manufactures.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10"/>At the uppermost and extreme Part of the County North-west, runs a large Promontory into the Sea beyond all the Land on either Side, whether of <HI>Devonshire,</HI> or of <HI>Cornwall.</HI> This they would fain have called <HI>Hercules</HI>'s <HI>Promontory</HI>; but the honest Sailors, and, after them, the plain Country People, call it <HI>Hartland Point,</HI> or <HI>Hearty Point,</HI> from the Town of <HI>Hartland,</HI> which stands just within the Shore, and is situated on the utmost Edge of the County of <HI>Devon:</HI> It is a Market-town of good Resort, the People coming constantly to it out of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> the Fisher-boats of <HI>Barnstable, Bidiford,</HI> and the other Towns on the Coasts, lying often un∣der the <HI>Lee,</HI> as they call it, of these Rocks, for Shelter from the South-west, or South-east Winds; at which time the Seamen go on Shore here, and supply themselves with Provisions: nor is the Town unconcerned in that gainful Fishing-trade, which is carried on for the Herrings on this Coast.</P>
<P>From this Point or Promontory, the Land falling away for some Miles, makes a Gulph or Bay, which reaching to the Head-land, or Point of <HI>Barnstable</HI> Haven, is called from thence <HI>Barnstable</HI> Bay. Into this Bay, or at the West-end of it, the Rivers <HI>Taw</HI> and <HI>Towridge</HI> empty themselves at one Mouth; and it is very particular, that as Two Rivers join in One Chanel, so here are Two great trading Towns in One Port, a thing, which, as it is not usual, so I cannot say is an Advantage to any of them; for it naturally follows, that they rival one another, and lessen both; whereas, had they been joined together in one Town, or were it possible to join them, they would make the most considerable Town, or City rather, in all this Part of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>These are the Towns of <HI>Barnstable</HI> and <HI>Bidiford,</HI> the first, the most antient; the last, the most flourishing; the Harbour or River is, in its En∣trance, the same to both; and when they part,
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
the <HI>Towridge</HI> turns to the Right, or South-west, and the <HI>Taw</HI> to the South-east; yet they seem to be both so safe, so easy in the Chanel, so equally good with respect to Shipping, and so equidistant from the Sea, that neither Town complains of the Bounty of the Sea to them, or their Situation by Land; and yet of late Years the Town of <HI>Bidiford</HI> has flourished, and the Town of <HI>Barnstable</HI> rather declined.</P>
<P><HI>Bidiford</HI> is a clean, well-built Town; the more antient Street, which lies next the River, is very pleasant, where is the Bridge, a very noble Quay, and the Custom-house; it is also very well built and populous, and fronts the River for above three Quarters of a Mile: But besides this, there is a new spacious Street, which runs North and South, or rather North-west, and South-east, a great Length, broad as the <HI>High-Street</HI> of <HI>Exeter,</HI> well-built, and inhabited with considerable and wealthy Merchants, who traffick to most Parts of the World.</P>
<P>Here, as is to be seen in almost all the Market-towns of <HI>Devonshire,</HI> is a very large and well-finished Meeting-house, and, by the Multitude of People which I saw come out of it, I thought all the Town had gone thither, and began to inquire for the Church: but I found that also large, spacious, and filled with People of the best Fashion.</P>
<P>The Trade of this Town, as well as of all the Towns on this Coast, being very much in Fish, I observed that several Ships were imployed to go to <HI>Liverpool,</HI> and up the River <HI>Mersey</HI> to <HI>Warrington,</HI> to fetch the Rock Salt, which is found in that County, (and of which I shall say more in my Remarks on those Parts) to <HI>Bidiford</HI> and <HI>Barnstable,</HI> and there dissolve it into Brine in the Sea-water, joining the Strength of two Bodies in one, and then boil it up again into a new Salt, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> do by that of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Portuguese.</HI> This is justly called <HI>Salt upon Salt,</HI> and with this they cure their Herrings.
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
As this is a Trade which can be but of few Years standing, because the Rock Salt itself has not been discovered in <HI>England</HI> many Years; so the Difference in curing the Fish has been such, that the Demand for them has considerably increased in foreign Markets.</P>
<P>Here is a very fine Stone Bridge over the River, built in the 14th Century, on 24 <HI>Gothick</HI> Arches, all uniform and regular, and very good Workmanship of the kind. These Arches are indeed beautiful and stately; but what a late Author says, that one of them is so big, that a Ship of 60 Tons may sail under it, is a Mistake, no such thing being practicable, either at <HI>London</HI> Bridge, <HI>Rochester</HI> Bridge, or even at <HI>York,</HI> where the largest Arch in <HI>England</HI> is supposed to be.</P>
<P>As <HI>Bidiford</HI> has a fine Bridge over the <HI>Towridge,</HI> so <HI>Barnstable</HI> has a very noble one over the <HI>Taw,</HI> and tho' not longer, is counted larger and stronger than the other. These two rival Towns are really very considerable; both of them have a large Share in the Trade to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and in the Herring-fishery, and in a Trade to the <HI>British</HI> Colonies in <HI>America</HI>; if <HI>Bidiford</HI> cures more Fish, <HI>Barnstable</HI> imports more Wine, and other Merchandizes; they are both established Ports for landing Wool from <HI>Ireland</HI>; of which by itself.</P>
<P>If <HI>Bidiford</HI> has a greater Number of Merchants, <HI>Barnstable</HI> has a greater Commerce within Land, by its great Market for <HI>Irish</HI> Wool and Yarn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the Serge-markets of <HI>Tiverton</HI> and <HI>Exeter,</HI> who come up hither to buy. So that, in a word, <HI>Barn∣stable,</HI> tho' it has lost Ground to <HI>Bidiford,</HI> yet, take it in all its Trade completely, is full as considerable as <HI>Bidiford</HI>; only, that perhaps it was formerly far supe∣rior to it, and the other has risen up to be its Match.</P>
<P><HI>Barnstable</HI> is a large, well-built Town, seated among the Hills. It is more populous than <HI>Bidi∣ford,</HI> but not better built, and stands lower; inso∣much, that at High-water in Spring-tides it is, in a manner, surrounded with Water. The Bridge was
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
built by the generous Benefaction of one <HI>Stamford,</HI> a Citizen and Merchant of <HI>London,</HI> who, it seems, was not a Native of the Place; but by trading here to his Gain, had Kindness enough for the Town, to confer that valuable Benefit upon them. It was formerly walled in, and had a Castle and a Priory. 'Tis governed by a Mayor and Twenty-four Bur∣gesses, whereof Two are Aldermen. It has also an High-Steward, and Recorder.</P>
<P>The Bridge at <HI>Bidiford,</HI> as above, was likewise a Gift; but was, as they say, done by Collections among the Clergy, by Grant of Indulgences, and the like Church Management: However, both the Towns are infinitely obliged to the Benefactors; and we wish no worse Use had ever been made of Superstition.</P>
<P>Behind <HI>Bidiford,</HI> as we come from <HI>Launceston,</HI> are several good Towns, tho' I observed, that the Country was wild and barren; as <HI>Tavistock, Torrington,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Tavistock</HI> is situate on the <HI>Tavy,</HI> among Springs, and is a large Town pretty well built. The Abbot of this Place sat in Parliament, built a Church of 126 Yards long, spacious Cloisters, and a Chapter-house, with 36 Stalls, which are all now destroy'd.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Torrington</HI> is situated on the same River that <HI>Bidiford</HI> stands upon. It has a large spacious Church, with a Library in it; and was for some time the Residence of <HI>Margaret,</HI> the Mother of <HI>Henry</HI> VII.</P>
<P>Another Town in this Part of the Country is <HI>Okehampton,</HI> vulgarly <HI>Okington,</HI> a good Market and Borough-town, governed by Eight principal Burgesses, and as many Assistants: it is a manufacturing Town, as all the Towns this way now are, and pretty rich; but in the Records of Antiquity it appears to have been much more considerable than it is now, having 92 Knights Fees belonging to it.</P>
<P>A little above <HI>Barnstable,</HI> N. E. upon the Coast, stands a noted Market and Port-town, called <HI>Ilford∣comb,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
a Place of good Trade, populous and rich; which is owing to its having a very good Harbour and Road for Ships, which affords a safe Shelter for Vessels from <HI>Ireland,</HI> when in bad Weather they can∣not, without the extremest Hazard, run into the Mouth of the <HI>Taw,</HI> which they call <HI>Barnstable</HI> Wa∣ter; and this is one Reason, that the Merchants at <HI>Barnstable</HI> do much of their Business at this Port of <HI>Ilfordcomb.</HI></P>
<P>The Harbour of this Town was maintain'd former∣ly at the private Expence of the Ancestors of Sir <HI>Bourchier Wrey,</HI> Bart. Lord of the Manor; and the Quay or Pier of it contains in Length upwards of 850 Feet, and in Height upwards of Forty; and the Warp-house, Light-house, Pilot-boats, and Taw-boats belonging to the Port, were at first founded and built, and constantly repaired and maintained, by that worthy Family, without any Assistance, but some small Acknowledgments paid to them as Lords of the Manor. But by Length of Time, and Vio∣lence of the Sea, the Quay was very much sunk and impair'd, the Warp and Warp-house, by long Usage, was gone to Decay, and the Boats for Piloting and Towing were much out of Repair, and the small Duties and Acknowlegements to Sir <HI>Bour∣chier</HI> sinking, and being frequently unpaid; to remedy all these Evils, an Act passed <HI>Anno</HI> 1731, <HI>George</HI> II. for repairing, and keeping in Repair, and inlarging the Piers and Harbour, and for the Support of the Light and Light-house, the Warp and Warp-house, and the Pilot, and Towing-boats, as above-men∣tioned: so that by this means the Harbour of <HI>Il∣fordcomb</HI> is likely to continue the useful and conve∣nient Port it has been for so many Years past, to the End of Time.</P>
<P>Antiquity tells us long Stories of the <HI>Danes</HI> land∣ing on this Coast; of <HI>Hubba</HI> the <HI>Danish</HI> King being slain at <HI>Kennith</HI> Castle, between this Place and the

Mouth of the <HI>Taw</HI> and <HI>Towridge</HI>; and that the Place was called <HI>Hubbestow</HI> from his being buried there: but I could not hear either of this Castle, or Burial-place, or so much as the Ruins of them.</P>
<P>The Sea-coast in this Country runs a little farther East by North; but nothing of Moment is to be seen there, except Fishing-towns, and little Creeks, on which are Two Market-towns, <HI>viz. Combemer∣ton</HI> and <HI>Porlock,</HI> till we came to <HI>Minehead.</HI></P>
<P>Leaving the Coast in our Journey Southward, we came to the great River <HI>Ex</HI> or <HI>Isca,</HI> which rises in the Hills on the North Side of the County, and, like the <HI>Tamar,</HI> begins within Four or Five Miles of the <HI>Severn</HI> Sea. The Country it rises in is called <HI>Exmore: Camden</HI> says it is a filthy, barren Ground; and indeed so it is: but as soon as the <HI>Ex</HI> comes off from the Moors and hilly Country, and descends into the lower Grounds, we found an Alteration; for then we saw <HI>Devonshire</HI> in its other Countenance, culti∣vated, populous and fruitful, and continuing so till we came to <HI>Tiverton.</HI></P>
<P>Next to <HI>Exeter,</HI> this is the greatest manufacture∣ing Town in the County, and, of all the inland Towns, is likewise next to it in Wealth, and Num∣ber of People; it stands on the River <HI>Ex,</HI> and has over it an old Stone Bridge, with another over the little River <HI>Loman,</HI> which immediately after falls into the <HI>Ex</HI> just below the Town. Antiquity says, be∣fore those Bridges were built, there were two Fords here, one thro' each River; and that the Town was from thence called <HI>Twyfordton,</HI> that is, the Town upon the two Fords; and so, by abbreviating the Sounds, <HI>Twy-for-ton,</HI> then <HI>Tiverton.</HI></P>
<P>This Town has been a remarkable Sufferer by Fire; for in the Year 1598. <HI>April</HI> 3. it was consum'd on a sudden; <HI>Aug.</HI> 5. 1612, it was again burnt down; and <HI>July</HI> 5. 1731, another dreadful Fire destroyed there 200 of the best Houses.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16"/>An Act passed on this sad Occasion, <HI>Anno</HI> 1732, for the more easy rebuilding of the Town, and determining Differences on that Account; and it injoins, that the new-built Houses shall be cover'd with Lead, Slate, or Tile, and not Thatch; that perilous Trades shall not be exercised in publick Streets; that no Stacks of Hay, Straw, Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> shall be erected at or near the publick Parts of the Town; that Fire-Engines may be bought by the Guardians of the Poor; that Houses may be demolished to stop any future Fire: that the Streets and Passages of the Town may be in∣larged, and particular Houses pulled down for that Purpose, with other useful Provisions.</P>
<P>An Act also passed <HI>Anno</HI> 1733, for making a Chapel, built by the Subscription of the Inhabitants of <HI>Tiver∣ton,</HI> a perpetual Cure; and for providing a Main∣tenance for the Ministers who shall officiate in it; for, as the Preamble to the Act observes, the Parish Church was not near capacious enough to receive the Inhabitants of the Parish. The late Sir <HI>William Wyndham</HI> was a great Encourager and Promoter of this new Chapel at its first Erection.</P>
<P>But the Beauty of <HI>Tiverton</HI> is the Free-School, at the East Entrance into the Town, a noble Building, but a much nobler Foundation; it was erected by one <HI>Peter Blundel,</HI> a Clothier, and a Lover of Learn∣ing, who used the Saying of <HI>William of Wickham</HI> to the King, when he founded the Royal School at <HI>Winchester, viz.</HI>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That if he was not himself a Scholar, he would be the Occasion of making more Scholars than any Scholar in <HI>England</HI>;"</Q> to which End he founded this School.
He has endow'd it so liberally, that, I was told, the Schoolmaster has at least Sixty Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> besides a very good House to live in, and the Advantage of Scholars not on the Foundation; and that the Usher has in Pro∣portion. To this the generous Founder added Two Fellowships, and Two Scholarships, which he gave
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
the Maintenance for to <HI>Sydney</HI> College in <HI>Cambridge</HI>; and One Fellowship, and Two Scholarships, to <HI>Baliol</HI> College in <HI>Oxford</HI>; all which are appointed for the Scholars bred up in this School.</P>
<P>As this is the chief Nursery of almost all the young Gentry of these Western Parts, the Profit arising to the Master from Boarders, and the liberal Benefactions of the Parents, added to the Salary before-mention'd, render it a Preferment suitable to a Man of the best Parts and Learning; and as the Trustees are Gentlemen of great Honour, it is generally disposed of to the most worthy Candidate. Mr. <HI>Rayner</HI> presided in it for many Years, with very great Applause, and dy'd about <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was written <HI>Anno</HI> 1740.</NOTE> Twelve Years ago. To him succeeded Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>; after him Mr. <HI>Jones</HI>; next Mr. <HI>Wesley,</HI> once Usher of <HI>West∣minster</HI> School, as noted for his poetical Performances, as his Brothers <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> are for their being at the Head of the new Sectarists, who are called <HI>Methodists</HI>; and he dying <HI>Nov.</HI> 1739, is succeeded by Mr. <HI>Daddo.</HI> Thus hath it, in Twelve Years time, undergone Five different Regimens; and if it be consider'd, that every Change introduces some Difference in the Method of Teaching and Disci∣pline, it will be no Surprize, that the School is some∣thing sunk in its former Reputation. The present Master is Fellow of <HI>Baliol</HI> College, <HI>Oxford,</HI> had his Education here, and from his great Abilities, and good Oeconomy, (in which last respect a great Com∣plaint lay against his Predecessor) the School is like to retrieve its former flourishing Condition.</P>
<P>The great Number of Gentlemens Sons sent hi∣ther for their Education, as I have hinted, is no small Advantage to the Town likewise; and this, join'd with the brisk Trade carried on here, renders it so flourishing, that notwithstanding the dreadful Calamity it underwent by the Fire in 1731, which
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
almost totally consumed it, it is already very elegantly rebuilt; and carries very few other Marks of this Devastation, than the Magnificence and Beauty of the new Structures.</P>
<P>As this is a manufacturing Country, we found the People here all fully imploy'd, and very few, if any, out of Work.</P>
<P>From this Town there is little belonging to <HI>Devon∣shire</HI> but what has been spoken of, except what lies in the Road to <HI>Taunton,</HI> which we took next, where we meet with the River <HI>Columb,</HI> which rises also in the utmost Limits of the County towards <HI>Somerset∣shire,</HI> and gives Name to so many Towns on its Banks, that it leaves no room to doubt of its own Name being right; such are <HI>Columb-David</HI>'s, <HI>Ufco∣lumb, Columbstock,</HI> and <HI>Columbton</HI>; the last is a Mar∣ket-town, and they are all full of Manufacturers depending much on the Master-manufacturers of <HI>Tiverton.</HI></P>
<P>Before we leave <HI>Devonshire,</HI> it will not be amiss to take Notice of <HI>Lundy</HI> Island, which, tho' 50 Miles from <HI>Devonshire,</HI> North-westward, is much mote remote from any other Continent. 'Tis but Five Miles long, and Two broad; but so surround∣ed with inaccessible Rocks, that there is but one small Entrance into it, where Two Men can scarce go abreast. Tho' this Island lies so far in the Sea, it has the Advantage of several Springs of fresh Water.</P>
<P>With the Town of <HI>Tiverton</HI> we leave the County of <HI>Devon,</HI> and entering <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> have really a View of a different Country from <HI>Devonshire</HI>; for at <HI>Wellington,</HI> the first Town we came to in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> tho' partly imployed in Manufacture∣ing too, we were immediately surrounded with Beg∣gars, to such a Degree, that we had some Difficulty to keep them from under our Horses Heels. I was
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
astonish'd at such a Sight, in a Country where the People were so generally full of Work; for in <HI>Corn∣wall,</HI> where there are hardly any Manufacturers, and abundance of Poor, we never found any like this.</P>
<P><HI>Wellington</HI> is a low dirty Place, and is only re∣markable for having been the Place of Residence of the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Popham,</HI> in the Reigns of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> I. who was buried here. They talk much of one <HI>Salkeld,</HI> who was converted from Popery by King <HI>James</HI> I. and made Minister of this Place. He called himself, in Compliment to the King, <HI>The Royal Convert</HI>; who, in return, complimented him with the Title of the <HI>Learned Salkeld,</HI> which, by-the-bye, reflected no bad Com∣pliment on himself, for having converted a learned Man.</P>
<P>The County of <HI>Somerset</HI> joins to the North-east Part of <HI>Devonshire,</HI> and takes its Name from the <HI>British</HI> Word <HI>Gladyr Haf,</HI> which signifies Summer-Country, and so the <HI>Welsh</HI> call it in their Language to this Day. I touch'd only upon one Point of the County in my last, as I went Westward. The whole County is worth a more particular Account, than can be given within the Space of a Letter.</P>
<P>From <HI>Wellington</HI> we came to <HI>Taunton,</HI> leaving <HI>Blackdown Hills</HI> on our Right, and <HI>Ilminster</HI> behind them Southward, a Market-town, fam'd for its very good Church, and a stately Monument erected in it to <HI>Nicolas Wadham,</HI> and <HI>Dorothy,</HI> his Wife, Founders of <HI>Wadham</HI> College, <HI>Oxon.</HI></P>
<P>Near <HI>Taunton</HI> lies that rich Track of Ground, vulgarly called <HI>Taunton-dean.</HI> This large, wealthy, and very populous Town takes its Name from the River <HI>Tone,</HI> whereon it is situated. One of the chief Manufacturers here told us, That there was at that time so good a Trade in the Town, that they had eleven hundred Looms going for the Weaving of Sagathies, Duroys, and such kind of Stuffs; and
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
that not one of those Looms wanted Work: he added, That there was not a Child in the Town, or in the Villages round it, of above Five Years old, but, if it was not neglected by its Parents, and un∣taught, could earn its own Bread. This was what I never met with in any Place in <HI>England,</HI> except at <HI>Colchester</HI> in <HI>Essex.</HI></P>
<P>The Election of Members here, is by those whom they call Pot-Walloners, that is to say, Every In∣habitant, whether House-keeper or Lodger, who dresses his own Victuals: to make out which, seve∣ral Inmates or Lodgers will, some little time before the Election, bring out their Pots, and make Fires in the Street, and boil their Victuals in the Sight of their Neighbours, that their Votes may not be called in Question.</P>
<P>There are Two large Parish Churches in this Town, and Two or Three Meeting-houses, one of which is said to be the largest in the County. The Inhabitants have been noted for Dissenters principal∣ly; for <HI>Taunton</HI> was always counted a Seminary for such. They suffer'd much in the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Rebellion, but paid King <HI>James</HI> home for the Cruel∣ty exercised by <HI>Jefferies</HI> among them; for when the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> arriv'd, the whole Town ran in to him, with so universal a Joy, that it was thought, if he had wanted it, he might have raised a little Army there, and in the adjacent Part of the Country.</P>
<P>There is a kind of College, or Academy, for the Dissenters in this Town; and it is by far the greatest Town in all this Part of the Country.</P>
<P>From <HI>Taunton</HI> we went North to take a View of the Coast. <HI>Exmore,</HI> of which mention was made above, where the River <HI>Ex</HI> rises, lies in the Way, Part of it in this County, and extending to the Sea Side: it gives, indeed, but a melancholy View, be∣ing a vast Track of barren and desolate Lands; yet on the Coast there are some very good Sea-ports.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21"/><HI>Porlock,</HI> mentioned before, on the utmost Extent of the County, has but a small Harbour, nor has it any thing of Trade.</P>
<P>But <HI>Minehead,</HI> the safest Harbour on this Side, is a fine Port: no Ship is so big, but it may come in; and no Weather so bad, but the Ships are safe when they are in; and they told me, that in the great Storm, <HI>Anno</HI> 1703, when the Ships were blown on Shore, wreck'd, and lost, in every Harbour of the County, they suffer'd little or no Damage in this.</P>
<P>The Trade of this Town lies chiefly with <HI>Ireland,</HI> and this was for many Years the chief Port in these Parts, where Wool from <HI>Ireland</HI> was allowed to be imported; but that Liberty is since inlarged to seve∣ral other Ports by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>The Town is well built, is full of rich Merchants, and has some Trade also to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and the <HI>West Indies.</HI> They correspond much with the Merchants of <HI>Barnstable</HI> and <HI>Bristol,</HI> in their foreign Trade. What has greatly contributed to the Improvement of <HI>Minehead,</HI> was an Act passed in the 12th and 13th Year of the late King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign, which was continued by an Act of the Tenth of the late Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> For Recovering, Securing, and keeping in Repair, the Harbour of <HI>Minehead.</HI> And now so lately as in the Session 1737-8, another Act passed for further continuing the Terms and Powers of the Two former Acts, for the bringing to Effect the same laudable Purposes, in pursuance of which a new Head has been built, the Beach clear'd, and a great Pro∣gress made in the Piers and design'd Works.</P>
<P>From hence the Coast bears back West to <HI>Watchet,</HI> a small Port of late Years, tho' formerly much more considerable; for it had given Place to <HI>Mine∣head,</HI> tho' now it is in a much better Condition than it used to be in; and this it owes to Two Acts of Parliament, one passed in the Sixth Year of the late Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> for repairing of its Quay and Har∣bour,
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
and the other in the Tenth. But when the Works designed were near completed, it was found, that the Quay was built much too low, and not ex∣tended to a sufficient Length to preserve the Town, and the Ships and Vessels riding in the Harbour, from the Violence of the Sea: whereupon another Act passed in the Seventh of King <HI>George</HI> I. for continuing the Duties laid by the former Acts, and remedying the Inconveniencies before-mentioned.</P>
<P>It seems to me, that the Town of <HI>Minehead</HI> rose out of the Decay of the Towns of <HI>Porlock</HI> and <HI>Watchet.</HI></P>
<P>On this Coast are vast Quantities of Rock, or rather Pebbles, which the Sea, at low Water, leaves uncovered, from whence the neighbouring Inhabit∣ants fetch them on Shore to a higher Ground, and burn them into Lime for dressing their Land; but it is more especially useful in Building; for that no Cement whatsoever is more lasting for <HI>Jets d' Eau</HI> Heads, Piers, and other Masonry that is to lie un∣der Water; in which Position it runs up to a Stone as hard as Marble, and is scarce to be beaten abroad. The Cliffs are stored with Alabaster, which, by the Wash of the Sea, falls down, and is convey'd from hence to <HI>Bristol,</HI> and other Places on this Shore, in great Quantity. Neither should it be omitted, that the Inhabitants burn great Quantities of Sea∣weed to supply the Glass-makers at <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>
<P>Walking on the Beach near <HI>Watchet,</HI> I discover'd among the large Gravel great Numbers of Stones, fluted in Imitation of the Shells of Fishes of all kinds: many of the flat kind are double, and curi∣ously tallied one in another, which may, by a vio∣lent Stroke, be separated. How to account for the vast Variety to be found here of this Sport of Na∣ture, I know not: some I have seen as broad as a Pewter-dish, and again others no bigger than a Pep∣per-corn; but in all of them the Flutings are regu∣lar;
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
some like the Escallop, in Rays from a Centre, others like the Perriwinkle, in spiral Lines: in these and all other Forms, they lie here in great Plenty.</P>
<P><HI>Quantock</HI> is a high Down in the Neighbourhood; from whence, besides the two little Islands, called the <HI>Steep-Holmes,</HI> and the <HI>Flat-Holmes,</HI> and an ex∣tensive View of the Chanel, I had a fair and distinct Prospect of the <HI>Welsh</HI> Coast for many Leagues in Length.</P>
<P>From hence the winding Shore brings us to <HI>Bridg∣water.</HI> This is an antient and very considerable Town and Port; it stands at the Mouth of the Ri∣ver <HI>Parrat,</HI> or <HI>Perrot,</HI> which comes from the South, after having received the River <HI>Tone</HI> from the West, which is made navigable up to within a few Miles of <HI>Taunton,</HI> by a very fine new Chanel, cut at the Expence of the People of <HI>Taunton,</HI> and which, by the Navigation of it, is infinitely advantageous to that Town, and well worth all their Expence, first by bringing up Coals, which are brought from <HI>Swanzy</HI> in <HI>Wales</HI> by Sea to <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> and thence by Barges up this River to <HI>Taunton</HI>; next for bring∣ing all heavy Goods and Merchandizes from <HI>Bristol,</HI> such as Iron, Lead, Oil, Wine, Hemp, Flax, Pitch, Tar, Grocery, Dye-stuffs, and the like.</P>
<P>This Town of <HI>Bridgwater</HI> is a populous, trade∣ing Town, well-built, and as well inhabited, hav∣ing many Families of good Fashion dwelling in it, besides Merchants. The famous Admiral <HI>Blake,</HI> who under the Commonwealth so much exalted the Glory of the <HI>English</HI> maritime Force, was a Native of this Town.</P>
<P>This Town was regularly fortified in the late Civil Wars, and sustained more than one Siege. The Situation of it renders it easy to be fortified, the River and Haven taking one chief Part of the Circumference. Over the River, they have a very good Bridge of Stone; and the Tide rises here, at
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
High-water, near Six Fathoms, and sometimes flows in with such Impetuosity, that it comes Two Fa∣thoms deep at a time; and when it does so, un∣awares, it often occasions great Damage to Ships, driving them foul of one another, and frequently oversets them. This sudden Rage of the Tide is called the <HI>Boar,</HI> and is frequent in all the Rivers of this Chanel, especially in the <HI>Severn</HI>; 'tis also known in the North, particularly in the <HI>Trent,</HI> and the <HI>Ouse,</HI> at their Entrance into the <HI>Humber,</HI> at <HI>Bristol,</HI> and in several other Places.</P>
<P>There is in <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> besides a very large Church, a fine Meeting-house, built since the To∣leration, in which 'tis remarkable, that they have an advanced Seat for the Mayor and Aldermen, when any of the Magistrates shall be of their Com∣munion, as sometimes has happened. Here also is a College, or private Academy, for the Dissenters to breed up their preaching Youth.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bridgwater</HI> is a Road to <HI>Bristol,</HI> which they call the <HI>Lower-way</HI>; the <HI>Upper-way,</HI> which is the more frequented Road, being over <HI>Mendip Hills.</HI> This Lower-way is not always passable, being sub∣ject to Floods, and dangerous Inundations. All this Part of the Country, <HI>viz.</HI> between <HI>Bridgwater</HI> and the Sea, and on Northward upon the Coast, lies low, and is wholly imployed in feeding of Black Cat∣tle, which they bring out of the West Part of <HI>De∣von,</HI> and the neighbouring Borders of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> where the finest are bred; for as to those few bred in these low Lands, they are very heavy, sluggish, and un∣shapely, and the Beef soft and spongy, such as they seldom or never drive to <HI>London</HI> Markets. Indeed, they breed a great many Colts; but then they too must be transplanted very young, into a dry, healthy Soil; for 'tis very difficult to find a Horse of their own Breed fit for any thing but a Drudge. The Moors, or Marsh-grounds, which are also imploy'd
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
in the same way, extend themselves up the Rivers <HI>Perrot</HI> and <HI>Ivil,</HI> into the Heart of the Country; of which in its Place.</P>
<P>This low Part, between <HI>Bridgwater</HI> and <HI>Bristol,</HI> suffered exceedingly in that terrible Inundation of the Sea, which was occasioned by the great Storm, <HI>Anno</HI> 1703; and the Country-people have set up Marks upon their Houses and Trees, with this Note upon them, <HI>Thus high the Waters came in the great Storm: Thus far the great Tide flowed up in the last violent Tempest</HI>; and the like.</P>
<P>In one Place they shewed us where a Ship was driven up upon the Shore, several hundred Yards from the ordinary High-water Mark, and left upon dry Land.</P>
<P>As the low Part is thus imployed in grazing and feeding Cattle, so all the rest of this large extended Country is imployed in the Woollen Manufacture, and in the best and most profitable Part of it, <HI>viz.</HI>

<P><PB N="25" REF="26"/>These fine <HI>Spanish</HI> Medley Cloths are the mix'd colour'd Cloths, which all the Persons of Fashion in <HI>England</HI> wear. There are vast Quantities of these exported to all Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and it is so very considerable a Trade, and of so vast an Advantage to <HI>England,</HI> in maintaining and supporting so many poor Families, and making so many rich ones, that it is almost impossible to give a just Description of it. The above Sketch, however, may serve as an In∣troduction to it. But I shall add a little more con∣cerning this County; and upon my entering into the North-west and West Parts of <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> where the Centre of this Prodigy of a Trade is, I shall sum it all up together, and shew you the Extent of Land which it spreads itself upon, and so give you some Idea, as well of the vast Numbers of People who are sustained, as of those who are inriched by it.</P>
<P>But I must first go back a little while into <HI>Somer∣setshire:</HI> The Northern Part of the County I did not visit in this Journey, which, as I hinted before, is only a Return from my long Travel to the <HI>Land's-end.</HI> In omitting this Part, I, of course, leave the two Cities of <HI>Bristol</HI> and <HI>Bath,</HI> and that high Part of the County called <HI>Mendip-hill,</HI> to my next Western Journey, which will include all the Counties due West from <HI>London</HI>; for these now spoken of, tho' ordinarily called the West-country, are rather North-west than West.</P>
<P>In that Part of the Country which lies Southward of <HI>Taunton</HI> and <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> is <HI>Langport,</HI> a well-frequented Market-town, on the River <HI>Parr,</HI> which is navigable for Barges to <HI>Bristol,</HI> and occasions a good Trade here. Eels are exceeding plentiful and cheap here. Near this Place General <HI>Fairfax</HI> beat up the discontented <HI>Goring</HI>'s Quarters, and intirely defeated him.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27"/><HI>South Petherton</HI> is a Market-town on the same River, famous, of old, for the Place of King <HI>Ina,</HI> but now of no other Note than an annual Fair, which lasts Five Days, in <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>From hence you come to <HI>Yeovil,</HI> which I have already mentioned in a former Letter.</P>
<P><HI>Ivelchester</HI> is a Borough Town, and, as its Ruins shew, was formerly very large, and incompass'd with a double Wall, and had Four Churches. It has now a good Bridge over the <HI>Ivel.</HI> It was here that, on the 3d of <HI>May</HI> 1740, Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Branch,</HI> and her Daughter, Miss <HI>Betty Branch,</HI> were executed for a most barbarous Murder committed on the Body of a Servant Girl, by one continued Series of Seven Hours beating and whipping, which with the Behaviour of the Criminals, was of so cruel and atrocious a Nature, that it shocked the whole King∣dom. The Particulars are too well known to need any farther Mention here, had we Room, which we have not.</P>
<P><HI>Somerton</HI> is a good Market-town, whence, some say, the Country takes its Name. It was antiently very noted, and had a strong Castle, in which <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>France</HI> was Prisoner. Here is a Fair which holds from <HI>Palm-Sunday</HI> to the Middle of <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Milbourn</HI> lies on the Edge of <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> and is very antient; but has neither Market, nor Fair.</P>
<P><HI>Camalet</HI> is a noted Place, situated on the highest Ground in this County, on the Edge of <HI>Dorsetshire:</HI> its vulgar Name is <HI>Cadbury-castle,</HI> from the Village of <HI>North-Cadbury,</HI> wherein it stands. Hereabouts rise the Rivers of <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> which run into the <HI>Severn</HI> Sea Westward, and that in <HI>Dorset,</HI> which goes Eastward, thro' <HI>Sturminster,</HI> into the Southern Ocean. It is a noble Fortification of the <HI>Romans.</HI> The Prospect is woody, and very pleasant; here-and-there lofty and steep Hillocks. <HI>Roman</HI> Coins,
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
in great Plenty, have been found here, and in all the Country round. The Entrance is guarded with Six or Seven Ditches. On the North-side, in the fourth Ditch, is a never failing Spring, called <HI>King</HI> Arthur<HI>'s Well.</HI> Over it they have dug up square Stones, Door-jambs with Hinges, and say there are subterraneous Vaults thereabout. The Church and Tower of <HI>Cadbury</HI> is small, but neatly built of Stone.</P>
<P>At <HI>Wincaunton,</HI> an Urn was lately found full of <HI>Roman</HI> Money. Half a Peck of the same Coin was discovered in inclosing Ground, toward <HI>Beacon-ash,</HI> a little above <HI>Sutton</HI>; as also <HI>Patera's,</HI> a Knife, and other Antiquities, now in Lord <HI>Winchelsca</HI>'s Custody: in particular, at <HI>Long-leat,</HI> in Lord <HI>Weymouth</HI>'s Library, a Piece of Lead weighing 50 Pounds, One Foot Nine Inches long, Two Inches thick, Three and an half broad, found in Lord <HI>Fitzharding</HI>'s Grounds near <HI>Bruton</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> was discovered by digging a Hole to set a Gate-post in, with a legible Inscription.</P>
<P>The Road from hence to <HI>Glastenbury,</HI> is over Rocks and Heads of Rivers. But that is alleviated by the many natural Curiosities such Places afford.</P>
<P><HI>Kyneton</HI> Village, for half a Mile together, is na∣turally paved with one smooth broad Rock, the whole Length of the Road; so that it looks like Ice.</P>
<P>Crossing the <HI>Fosse</HI> Road at <HI>Lyteford,</HI> you enter a flat moorish Country, full of artificial Cuts and Drains. The Ascent to the <HI>Torr,</HI> which overhangs the Town of <HI>Glastenbury,</HI> is very difficult. Upon a narrow Crest of the <HI>Torr,</HI> which is much the highest; the Abbot built a Church to St. <HI>Michael,</HI> of good square Stone. The Tower is left, tho' ruinous, and is an excellent Sea-mark. It probably cost more to raise the Stone to this Height, than to erect the Building. Half way up is a Spring: it is

certainly higher than any Ground within Ten Miles of the Place. In the Times of Superstition this great Monastery held the first Place for Reputa∣tion of Sanctity.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants will have it, that King <HI>Arthur</HI> was buried here, and, as a Proof thereof, that his Coffin had been found in this Place; and also, that <HI>Joseph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea</HI> had been here, and that when he had fixed his Staff in the Ground, which was on <HI>Christmas-day,</HI> it immediately took Root, budded, put forth White-thorn Leaves, and the next Day was in full Blossom, white as a Sheet; and that the Plant is preserved, and blows every <HI>Christmas-day,</HI> as at first, to this very Time.</P>
<P>I believe the Miracle amounts to no more than this; <HI>viz.</HI> That a kind of White-thorn grows here∣about, which, in a mild Winter, puts forth some Blossom about <HI>Christmas</HI>; and I doubt not, but some of the same Kind may be found at other Places, if any Observations were made of it. But this Place is remarkable for many other marvellous Stories, recorded by the Monks, who formerly possessed it.</P>
<P>As to the Burial of King <HI>Arthur,</HI> Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> makes no doubt of it, and gives us from <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis</HI> an Account how King <HI>Henry</HI> II. caused Search to be made for his Tomb, and before the Workmen had dug Seven Feet deep, they came to a great Stone, having a Cross of Lead on the Inside of it, and the subsequent Letters or Inscription upon it, and in the following rude Character; which the said <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis,</HI> Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> says, was an Eye-witness of, as well as of a Coffin of hollow'd Oak, which they found by digging Nine Feet deeper than the Inscription, wherein were deposited the Bones of that great Prince. The Inscription is as follows:

<P>But to leave these more disputable Points for Mat∣ters of greater Certainty: it is not doubted but King <HI>Ina</HI> built the Church of <HI>Glastenbury,</HI> as one of the most antient, so the most wealthy and magni∣ficent, loaded with Revenues by the <HI>Saxon,</HI> and per∣haps the <HI>British</HI> Monarchs. The Abbot lived in little less State than the Royal Donors, his Revenue
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
amounting to 40,000<HI>l.</HI> annually. He could from the <HI>Torr</HI> see a vast Track of this rich Land in his own Possession, and Seven Parks well stored with Deer belonging to the Monastery. 'Tis walled round, and imbattled like a Town, a Mile in Compass.</P>
<P>When I was last at <HI>Glastenbury,</HI> there were mag∣nificent Ruins; but, within a few Years, a Presby∣terian Tenant had made more barbarous Havock there, than had been since the Dissolution; for every Week a Pillar, a Buttress, a Window-jamb, or an Angle of fine hewn Stone, was sold to the best Bidder. And they were actually stripping <HI>St. Joseph</HI>'s Chapel for that Purpose, and the squared Stones were laid up by Lots in the Abbot's Kitchen. The rest goes to paving Yards and Stalls for Cattle, or to the Highway. So much Dread indeed have the People here of Founders Curses, that they are afraid to make use of the Materials for Dwelling-houses; and are full of Stories of sad Accidents and Judgments, that have fallen upon such as have; but venture it for the Highways, for a Town-house, and even for Barns and Stables; so that, as one observes, where few are so hardy as to apply them to their par∣ticular or personal Use, a publick Building shall be erected, where all come in for their Snack.</P>
<P>The Abbot's Lodging was a fine Stone Building, but could not content the just-mentioned Tenant, who pulled it down, and out of it built a new House, absurdly setting up the Arms and Cognizances of the great <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings and Princes, who were Founders, and of the Abbots, over his own Doors and Windows. Nothing is left intire, but the Kitchen, a judicious Piece of Architecture. But Tradition says, that this is but a modern Building; for the Story goes, That <HI>Whiting,</HI> the last Abbot, being dealt with by <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and his Cormorants, for a Surrender, and bravely refusing to join in the Sacri∣lege,
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
that Prince proceeded to Menaces, and told him, he <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"would burn his Kitchen about his Ears."</Q>
To which he returned Answer,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he would build such an one as all the Timber in the Forest should not burn."</Q>
And accordingly, as 'tis said, built this in Defiance, which is all of firm Stone, Walls and Roof, having nothing combustible in it. But what neither Flattery nor Menaces could effect, Tyranny and Murder brought about. For the Abbot was hanged on <HI>St. Michael</HI>'s Tower, just now mentioned, on the Top of the high Hill, called <HI>The Torr,</HI> thereby accomplishing a Prophecy, (as the Townsmen call it; but rather occasioning a Saying since spread abroad) <HI>That a</HI> Whiting <HI>should swim over</HI> Glastenbury Torr.</P>
<P>The Church was large and magnificent; the Walls of the Choir are standing, 25 Fathom long, and 12 broad. There is one Jamb at the East-end of the High Altar left.</P>
<P>Hereabout were buried King <HI>Edgar,</HI> and many of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Monarchs, whose noble Ashes ought to have protected the Whole.</P>
<P>Two Pillars of the great Middle Tower are left, next the Choir. On the North-side is <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s Chapel, as they told me; the Roof beat down by Violence, and a mean wooden one in its Place, thatched with Stubble, to make it serve as a Stable. The Manger lies upon the Altar and Nich, where they put the Holy-Water. <HI>St. Edgar</HI>'s Chapel is opposite to it; but there is not much left of it be∣side the Foundations. The present Work is 44 Paces long, 36 wide without. The Roof is chiefly wanting. Two little Turrets are at the Corners of the West-end, and Two more at the Interval of Four Windows from thence, which seem to indicate the Space of Ground the first Chapel was built on: the rest between it and the Church was a kind of Antechapel. Underneath was a Vault, now full of
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
Water, the Floor of the Chapel being beaten down into it: it was wrought with great Stones.</P>
<P>Here was a capacious Receptacle of the Dead. They have taken up many leaden Coffins, and melted them into Cisterns.</P>
<P>The Roof of the Chapel was finely arched with Ribwork of Stone. The Sides of the Walls are full of small Pillars of <HI>Sussex</HI> Marble, as likewise the whole Church, which was a mean way of Orna∣menting in those Times: they are mostly beaten down. Between them the Walls are painted with Pictures of Saints, as still easily seen. All the Walls are overgrown with Ivy, which is the only thing here in a flourishing Condition; every thing else presenting a most melancholy, tho' venerable Aspect. On the South-side the Cloisters was the great Hall.</P>
<P>The Townsmen bought the Stones of the Vaults underneath to build a sorry Market-house, not dis∣cerning the Benefit accruing to the Town from the great Concourse of Strangers purposely to see this Abbey, which is now its greatest Trade, as formerly its only Support: for 'tis in a most miserable decaying Condition, as wholly cut off from the large Re∣venues spent among them.</P>
<P>There are many other Foundations of the Build∣ings left in the great Area; but in the present Hands will soon be rooted up, and the very Footsteps of them effaced, which so many Ages had been erecting.</P>
<P>The Abbot's Hall, I have been told, was curiously wainscotted with Oak, and painted with Coats of Arms in every Panel. The Morter of these Build∣ings is very good, and great Rocks of the Roof of the Church lie upon the Ground, chiefly consisting of Rubble-stone untouched by the fanatical De∣stroyers, who chiefly work on the hewn Stone of the Outside, till a whole Wall falls, when under∣mined a little.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="34"/>Throughout the Town are the tattered Remains of Doors, Windows, Bases, Capitals of Pillars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> brought from the Abbey, and put into every poor Cottage.</P>
<P>In the Town are Two Churches; the upper a handsome Fabrick with a fine Tower of good De∣sign, adorned with Figures in Niches. The <HI>George</HI> Inn is an old Stone Building, called <HI>the Abbot's Inn,</HI> where chiefly the Pilgrims were lodged, who came strolling hither, and idling their Time away for Sanctity. A Coat of Arms of the Kings of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> supported by a Lion and a Bull, is over the Gate, with many Crosses. There was a Bed of large Timber, with imbossed gilt Panels, which seemed to have been the Abbot's.</P>
<P>Four Miles from <HI>Glastenbury,</HI> lies the little City of <HI>Wells,</HI> where is one of the neatest Cathedrals in <HI>England</HI>; particularly the West Front of it, which is a complete Draught of Imagery, as well as very antient.</P>
<P>The Close, or Part of the City where the Bishop's Palace is, is very properly called so; for it is walled in, and locked up like a little Fortification, and has a Ditch round it. The dignified Clergy live in the Inside of it, and the Prebendaries and Canons have very agreeable Dwellings. Here are no less than 27 Prebendaries, and 19 Canons, besides a Dean, a Chancellor, a Precentor, and Three Archdeacons; a Number which very few Cathedrals in <HI>England</HI> have besides.</P>
<P>The County is the Diocese, and contains 388 Parishes, and the Archdeaconries are of <HI>Wells, Bath,</HI> and <HI>Taunton.</HI></P>
<P>The City lies just at the Foot of the Mountains called <HI>Mendip-hills,</HI> and is built on a stony Foun∣dation. Its Manufacture is chiefly of Stockens, as has been said; 'tis well-built, and populous.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35"/>Near this City, and just under the Hills, is the famous <HI>Wokey Hole,</HI> the chief Curiosity of which is frequently found in all such subterraneous Caverns; that the Water, dropping from the Roof of the Vault, petrifies and hangs in long Pieces like Icicles, as if it would, in Time, turn into a Column to support the Arch.</P>
<P>Not far from hence is <HI>Sedgmore,</HI> a watry splashy Place, and infamous for the Defeat of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI></P>
<P>In the low Country, on the other Side <HI>Mendip</HI> Hills, lies <HI>Chedder,</HI> a Village pleasantly situated under the very Ridge of the Mountains: before the Village is a large Green, or Common, on which all the Cows belonging to the Town feed: the Ground is exceeding rich, and as the Inhabitants are Cow-keepers, they take care to maintain the Goodness of the Soil, by agreeing to lay on large Quantities of Dung for manuring and inriching the Land.</P>
<P>Several Persons frequently, here mix their Milk together, which often weighs a hundred Weight, sometimes more; and is so excellent, that it is often sold from Six-pence to Eight-pence <HI>per</HI> Pound, when the <HI>Cheshire</HI> Cheese is sold but from Two-pence to Two-pence Half-penny.</P>
<P>Here is a deep frightful Chasm in the Mountain, in the Hollow of which the Road goes toward <HI>Bristol</HI>; and out of the same Hollow springs a little Stream, which is so rapid, that it is said to drive 12 Mills within a Quarter of a Mile of the Spring; but it must be supposed to fetch some winding Reaches in the Way; otherwise there would not be room for 12 Mills to stand, and have a sufficient Head of Water to each, within so small a Space of Ground. The Water of this Spring grows quickly into a River, and runs down into the Marshes, and joins another little River called <HI>Axe,</HI> about <HI>Axbridge,</HI> and thence into the <HI>Bristol</HI> Chanel, or <HI>Severn</HI> Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36"/>I must now turn East, and South-east; for I re∣solved not to go up the Hills of <HI>Mendip</HI> at all, this Journey; leaving that Part to another Tour, when I shall give an Account of these Mountains, as also of the Cities of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Bristol,</HI> to which they are very near, in one Letter.</P>
<P>I come now to that Part of the County which joins to <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> which I reserved in particular to this Place, in order to give some Account of the Broad-cloth Manufacture, which I several times mentioned before, and which is carried on here, to such a Degree, as to deserve a Place in all the De∣scriptions or Histories which shall be given of this Country.</P>
<P>As the East and South Parts of <HI>Wiltshire</HI> are all hilly, spreading themselves far and wide in Plains, and grassy Downs, for breeding and feeding vast Flocks of Sheep; and as the West and North Parts of <HI>Somersetshire</HI> are, on the contrary, low and marshy, or moorish, for feeding and breeding of Black Cattle and Horses, or for Lead Mines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so all the South-west Part of <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and the East Part of <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> are low and flat, being a rich, inclosed Country, full of Rivers and Towns, and infinitely populous, insomuch that some of the Market-towns are equal to Cities in Bigness, and superior to many of them in Numbers of People.</P>
<P>This low flat Country contains Part of the Three Counties, of <HI>Somerset, Wilts,</HI> and <HI>Gloucester</HI>; and that the Extent of it may be the easier understood by those who know any thing of the Situation of the Country, it reaches from <HI>Cirencester</HI> in the North, to <HI>Sherburn</HI> on the Edge of <HI>Dorsetshire</HI> South, and from the <HI>Devizes</HI> East, to <HI>Bristol</HI> West, which may take in about 50 Miles in Length where longest, and 20 in Breadth where narrowest.</P>
<P>In this Extent of Country, we have the following Market-towns, which are principally imployed in
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
the Clothing Trade, that is to say, in that Part of it, which I am now speaking of, namely, fine Medley, or mixed Cloths, such as are usually worn in <HI>England</HI> by the better Sort of People; and also, exported in great Quantities to <HI>Holland, Hamburgh, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy,</HI> &amp;c. The prin∣cipal Clothing Towns in this Part of the Country, are these,

</LIST></P>
<P>These Towns, as they stand thin, and at consi∣derable Distance from one another, (for, except the Two Towns of <HI>Bradford</HI> and <HI>Trubridge,</HI> the others stand at an unusual Distance) are interspersed with a very great Number of Villages, Hamlets, and scat∣tered Houses, in which, generally speaking, the spinning Work of all this Manufacture is performed by the poor People; the Master Clothiers, who generally live in the greater Towns, sending out the Wool weekly to their Houses, by their Servants and Horses, and at the same time bringing back the Yarn that they have spun and finished, which then is fitted for the Loom.</P>
<P>The increasing and flourishing Circumstances of this Trade are happily visible by the great Concourse of People to, and Increase of Buildings and Inhabit∣ants
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
in, these principal Clothing Towns, where this Trade is carried on, and in the Wealth of the Clo∣thiers. The Town of <HI>Frome,</HI> or, as it is written in our Maps, <HI>Frome-Sellwood,</HI> is a Specimen of this, which is so prodigiously increased within these last 30 or 40 Years, that they have built a new Church, and so many new Streets of Houses, and these Houses are so full of Inhabitants, that <HI>Frome</HI> is now reckoned to have more Inhabitants in it, than the City of <HI>Bath</HI>; and some say, than <HI>Salisbury</HI>; and if their Trade continues to increase in like manner for a few Years more, it is very likely to become one of the greatest and wealthiest inland Towns in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Its Trade is wholly Clothing, and the Cloths they make are, generally speaking, all convey'd to <HI>London:</HI> where <HI>Blackwell-hall</HI> is their Market; and, if we may believe common Fame, there are above 10,000 People in <HI>Frome</HI> now, more than lived in it 30 Years ago; and yet it was a considerable Town then.</P>
<P>Here are also several large Meeting-houses, as well as Churches, as there are, generally, in all the ma∣nufacturing trading Towns in <HI>England,</HI> especially in the Western Counties.</P>
<P>The <HI>Devizes</HI> is, next to <HI>Frome,</HI> a large and im∣portant Town, and full of wealthy Clothiers; but it has lately run pretty much into the Drugget-making Trade; a Business, which has made some Invasion upon that of the Broad-cloth, great Quan∣tities of Druggets being worn in, as well as exported from <HI>England,</HI> instead of Broad-cloth; but this is much the same as to the Trade still; for since it is all a Woolen Manufacture, and the Druggets may properly be called Cloth, tho' narrow, and of a different Make, so the Makers are all called Clothiers.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Avon,</HI> a noble and large fresh River, branching itself into many Parts, and receiving almost
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
all the Rivers on that Side of the Hills, waters this whole fruitful Vale; and the Water of this River seems particularly qualified for dying the best Colours, and for Fulling and Dressing the Cloth, so that the Clothiers generally plant themselves upon this River, but especially the Dyers, as at <HI>Trubridge</HI> and <HI>Brad∣ford,</HI> which are the Two most eminent Clothing Towns in that Part of the Vale, for the Making fine <HI>Spanish</HI> Cloths, and for the nicest Mixtures.</P>
<P>From these Towns, South to <HI>Westbury</HI> and <HI>War∣minster,</HI> the same Trade continues, and the finest Medley <HI>Spanish</HI> Cloths in the whole World are made in this Part. They told me at <HI>Bradford,</HI> that it was no extraordinary thing to have Clothiers thereabout worth from 10,000 to 40,000<HI>l.</HI> a Man; and many of the Gentry in those Counties have been originally raised from this truly noble Manufacture.</P>
<P>If I may speak here from the Authority of the an∣tient Inhabitants of the Place, who have been curious Observers upon this Subject, the Country which I have now described, as principally imployed in, and maintained by this Prodigy of a Trade, contains 2,330,000 Acres of Land, and has in it 788 Parishes, and 374,000 People. It is true, that this is all Guess∣work; but I must confess myself very willing to be∣lieve, that the Reckoning is far short of the Account; for this Part is exceeding large and populous.</P>
<P>It may be worth Inquiry, how the Manufacturers in so vast a Consumption of the Wool, as such a Trade must take up, can be supplied with Wool for their Trade; and indeed it would be something strange, if the Answer were not at hand.</P>
<P N="1">1. We may reasonably conclude, that this Manu∣facture was at first seated in this County, or, as we may say, originally planted itself here, because of the infinite Numbers of Sheep, which were always up∣on the Downs and Plains of <HI>Dorset, Wilts,</HI> and <HI>Hampshire,</HI> all adjoining. This, no doubt, induced
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
the first Planters of the Clothing Manufacture to make Choice of this delightful Vale in the Neigh∣bourhood of those Plains, which afforded such im∣mense Funds of Wool for the carrying on their Works. Thus the Manufacture of white Cloth was planted in <HI>Stroud-water</HI> in <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> for the sake of the excellent Water there for the Dying Scarlets, and all Colours that are dyed in Grain, which are better done there, than in any other Place of <HI>England,</HI> some Towns near <HI>London</HI> excepted. Hence therefore we first observe, they are supplied yearly with the Fleeces of Two or Three Millions of Sheep.</P>
<P N="2">2. But as the Number of Sheep fed on these Downs is lessened, rather than increased, because of so many thousand Acres of the Carpet Ground being of late Years converted into Tillage, and sowed with <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Alteration has made <HI>Warminster,</HI> a Market-town on the Edge of <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> the greatest Market for Wheat in <HI>England,</HI> where none of it is bought to send to <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> Wheat; and at the same time the Manufacture pro∣digiously increasing; the Manufacturers applied to other Parts for a Supply, and hence began the Influx of North Country Wool from the Counties of <HI>Northampton, Leicester</HI> and <HI>Lincoln,</HI> the Centre and Markets of which Trade are about <HI>Tetbury</HI> and <HI>Cirencester,</HI> where several hundred Packs are sold every Week, to supply this prodigious Consumption.</P>
<P N="3">3. From <HI>London</HI> they have great Quantities of Wool, which is generally called <HI>Kentish</HI> Wool, in the Fleece, which is brought up from thence by the Farmers, since the late severe Acts against their Selling it within a certain Number of Miles of the Sea; also Fell-wool for the Combers, bought of the Wool-staplers in <HI>Barnaby-street,</HI> and sent back by the Carriers which bring up the Cloths to Market.</P>
<P N="4">4. They have also, sometimes, large Quantities of <HI>Irish</HI> Wool by the way of <HI>Bristol,</HI> or of <HI>Minehead</HI> in
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
<HI>Somersetshire</HI>; but this is uncertain, and only on extraordinary Occasions. I omit the <HI>Spanish</HI> Wool, as being an Article by itself.</P>
<P>Thus, as those who see the almost countless Num∣bers of Sheep on the Downs and Plains, and the great Quantities of Wool brought to the Markets of <HI>Tetbury,</HI> and other Towns, as well as what are sent down from <HI>London</HI> into this single Vale, would wonder how it was possible so much Wool could be consumed, manufactured, and wrought up; so, on the other hand, those that see what Numbers of People are imployed, and what vast Quantities of Goods are made, in this Part of <HI>England,</HI> would wonder how the Nation should be able to supply them with Wool.</P>
<P>And yet, notwithstanding the whole Country is thus busy'd in the Broad-cloth Manufacture, I must not omit to mention, that here is a very great Application to another Branch or two of Trade, <HI>viz.</HI> The supplying the City of <HI>London</HI> with Provisions: Tho' it is true, that the general Imployment of the People in all this County, is in the Woollen Manu∣facture; yet, as the Spinning is generally the Work of the Women and Children, and the Land is here exceeding rich and fertile, so it cannot be sup∣posed, but that here are Farmers in great Numbers, whose Business it is to cultivate the Land, and sup∣ply the rest of the Inhabitants with Provisions; and this they do so well, that notwithstanding the County is exceeding populous, yet Provisions of all Sorts are cheap, the Quantity very great, and a considerable Overplus sent every Day to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>All the lower Part of this County, and also of <HI>Gloucestershire</HI> adjoining, is full of large feeding Farms, which we call Dairies; and the Cheese they make is excellent, and is eaten newer than that from <HI>Cheshire.</HI> Of this a vast Quantity is every Week sent up to <HI>London,</HI> where, tho' it is called <HI>Gloucester∣shire</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
Cheese, yet the greatest Part of it comes from <HI>Wiltshire</HI>; the <HI>Gloucestershire</HI> Cheese being more generally carried to <HI>Bristol</HI> and <HI>Bath,</HI> where a very great Quantity is consumed, as well by the Inhabit∣ants of these two populous Cities, as in Exportation to our <HI>West-India</HI> Colonies, and other Places; whereas this <HI>Wiltshire</HI> Cheese is carried to the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> which runs thro' Part of the County, by Land-carriage, and so by Barges to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Again, in the Spring of the Year, they make a vast Quantity of that we call Green or New Cheese, which is a thin and very soft Cheese, resembling Cream Cheeses, but somewhat thicker. These are so universally liked in <HI>London,</HI> that all the low rich Lands of this County are hardly enough to supply the Market; but then this holds for little more than the Two first Summer Months of the Year.</P>
<P>Besides this, the Farmers in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and the Part of <HI>Gloucestershire</HI> adjoining, send a very great Quan∣tity of Bacon up to <HI>London,</HI> which is esteemed the best Bacon in <HI>England, Hampshire</HI> only excepted. This Bacon is raised here, by their great Dairies, as the Hogs are fed with the vast Quantities of Whey, and skimmed Milk, which the Farmers must otherwise have thrown away.</P>
<P>But this is not all; for as the North Part of <HI>Wilt∣shire,</HI> as well the Downs as the Vales, border upon the River <HI>Thames,</HI> and in some Places come up even to the Banks of it, so most of that Part of the County being arable Land, they sow a very great Quantity of Barley, which is carried to the Markets at <HI>Abingdon,</HI> at <HI>Faringdon,</HI> and such Places, where it is made into Malt, and carried to <HI>London.</HI> This imploys all the Hill-country from above <HI>Malmsbury</HI> to <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and on the Side of the Vale of <HI>White-horse,</HI> as 'tis called, which is in <HI>Berkshire,</HI> and the Hills adjoining; a Track of fertile Ground, which furnishes a prodigious Quantity of Barley.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="43"/>Thus <HI>Wiltshire</HI> helps to supply <HI>London</HI> with Cheese, Bacon, and Malt, Three very considerable Articles, besides that vast Manufacture of fine <HI>Spanish</HI> Cloths, of which I have said so much; and I may without Partiality say, that it is thereby rendered one of the most important Counties in <HI>England</HI> to the publick Wealth of the Kingdom. The bare Product is in itself prodigiously great; the Downs are an inex∣hausted Store-house of Wool, and of Corn; and the Valley, or low Part of it, is the like for Cheese and Bacon.</P>
<P>One Thing here is worth while to mention, for the Observation of those Counties in <HI>England,</HI> where they are not yet arrived to that Perfection in Hus∣bandry, as in this County; and I have purposely reserved it to this Place; and that is, The Downs or Plains, which tho' generally called <HI>Salisbury Plain,</HI> yet extend themselves into the Counties of <HI>South∣ampton, Wilts,</HI> and <HI>Dorset,</HI> were formerly wholly taken up with Sheep, as being thought incapable of producing Grain, but now are made to yield most plentiful Crops, by folding their Sheep upon the plough'd Lands, removing the Fold every Night to a fresh Place, till the whole Fallow has been folded on. This alone has made these Lands, which in them∣selves are poor, and, in some Places, so shallow as that the Earth is not six Inches deep over the solid Chalk, able to bear as good Wheat, as any of the richer Lands in the Vales, tho' not altogether in such great Quantities: And were it not for this Improve∣ment, the Product would hardly compensate the Ploughman's Labour; for many of these Lands lie up such high Hills, so remote from the Farmers Houses, which are always in the Valleys, that it would be very difficult to carry up their Dung to manure them.</P>
<P>If this way of folding Sheep upon the Fallows and ploughed Lands were practised in some other Parts
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
of <HI>Britain,</HI> and especially in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it would effectually improve the waste Lands, which now are useless and uncultivated, and turn both Sheep and Lands to a better Account than was ever yet known among them. In <HI>Wiltshire</HI> it appears to be so, very significantly; for if a Farmer has a Thousand Sheep, and no Fallows to fold them on, his Neighbours will give him Ten Shillings a Night for every Thousand.</P>
<P>But as I have not mentioned these Clothing Towns other than as they contribute to that Trade, I shall now proceed to say something of the Towns them∣selves, except those in <HI>Gloucestershire</HI>; of which I shall speak in my next Letter, as I fall down Westward.</P>
<P><HI>Shipton-Mallet, Castle Carey, Wincaunton,</HI> and <HI>Bruton,</HI> lie to the Southward of <HI>Wells,</HI> and have nothing remarkable in them except the last, which lies on the River <HI>Brews.</HI> It has a fair Church, a good Free-school, and a stately Alms-house, the Ruins of a Priory, and beside the Clothing-trade, is famous for Stockens.</P>
<P><HI>Frome,</HI> and <HI>Philips Norton,</HI> lie East of <HI>Somerset∣shire,</HI> upon the Borders of <HI>Wilts.</HI> The first is near the Forest of <HI>Selwood,</HI> and I have already mentioned its prodigious Increase of late Years. The last is a very good Market-town, and has Two annual Fairs, one reputed, for a One-day Fair, as great as any in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bensford</HI> is a small Market-town, and lies North-west toward <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Malmsbury</HI> is a very antient Town, and, 'tis said, was built by a <HI>British</HI> Prince, called <HI>Caer Bladdon.</HI> It was formerly defended by Walls, and a large strong Castle, which was razed afterward, to inlarge the Abbey, which was very famous, and the greatest in <HI>Wiltshire:</HI> the Abbot sat in Parliament. King <HI>Athelstane</HI> was buried here, and they still shew
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
his Tomb here. Vast Piles of Buildings were pulled down at the Dissolution, but the Church of the Abbey was saved, a great Part of which still remains, and is used as the Parish Church. It is a Corporation governed by a <HI>Justice,</HI> who is an annual Magistrate, and called <HI>The Alderman.</HI> It has a good Market weekly. The Town is neat, and lies on the River <HI>Avon.</HI> It is also famous for the Birth-place of <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury,</HI> the Historian; and of that great Scholar, Philosopher, and Mathematician, <HI>Hobbes</HI>; and of divers other very great and re∣markable Men.</P>
<P>Near this Town, Southward, on the same River, lies the Village of <HI>Dantsey,</HI> which, tho' but an ob∣scure Place, has given Title of Honour to many eminent Persons, and among the rest, to <HI>Henry Danvers,</HI> created Baron of this Place by King <HI>James</HI> I. tho' afterwards made Earl of <HI>Danby.</HI> He had distin∣guished himself in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s <HI>Irish</HI> Wars, was as good as great, and died with Glory; but his Brother and Heir, having sat, ungratefully, a Judge on that very King who made his Brother Earl, was, at the Restoration, attainted of High Treason; and this his Manor of <HI>Dantsey</HI> given to <HI>James</HI> then Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who settled it in Dowry on his second Consort. On his Abdication, it became a second time forfeited, and King <HI>William</HI> conferred it on <HI>Charles</HI> Lord <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> late Earl of <HI>Peter∣borough</HI> and <HI>Monmouth,</HI> in whose Family it still remains. But as there are some other Things more than ordinarily particular, relating to this Manor, I shall inlarge a little upon it.</P>
<P>The whole Parish of <HI>Dantsey</HI> consists of this Manor only, and not a Foot of Ground in it be∣longs to any other Person: it is altogether Pasture, and indeed very rich. The Inhabitants, who are all Tenants of the Manor, make most excellent Cheese, not at all inferior to that of <HI>Chedder,</HI> which is the
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
only Commodity in the Place; for the late Lord would not permit the Grounds to be ploughed up; and, I believe, there is not an Acre in the Parish of arable Land, tho' the Tenants have offered a considerable Advance of Rent, for Liberty to break up the Ground, which indeed seems to want it, and would be much better'd by the Plough; nor would his Lordship, for some Years before his Death, renew a Life upon it, either by Lease or Copyhold, except as many of the last, as would keep up the Homage, and the Rights of the Manor: and the Reason of this was, not only to get a clear Rack-rent Estate in it, but to prevent the Cheats and Impositions which the Copyhold Tenants of the Manor put upon their Lord; for as every Widow has her Life in her Husband's Copyhold after his Death, if she continues sole and continent, 'tis a very common thing there for an old Man, on his Death-bed, to marry a young Woman, who privately contracts to give Part of the Profits of the Copyhold, or some Consideration for it, to the Husband's Relations, and not seldom selects, for a Bedfellow for herself, one of her favourite Men-servants.</P>
<P>The Abuse which accrued from granting Leases on Lives is this, That whereas a Person takes a Lease for Three Lives, <HI>viz.</HI> his own, his Wife's, and his Son <HI>John</HI>'s; to defraud the Lord of the Manor, he names all his Sons <HI>John</HI>; so that, as long as any of the Sons live, <HI>John</HI> in the Lease never dies.</P>
<P>By these Frauds, the Earl, who was none of the best Oeconomists, and lived remote from this Place, suffered considerably, tho' he could not find out how; but frequently complained, That his Lessees, and his Copyhold-Widows, were very long lived; and, in an humorous way, used to recommend his Manor of <HI>Dantsey</HI> to all such as were apprehensive of dying.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47"/>As all in the Parish were his Tenants, and had an Interest in the Fraud, they combined against him, so that he could get no Intelligence of it: and tho' his Lordship enjoyed the Manor ever since the Revo∣lution, yet, by reason of its being then full estated, that is, all let out upon Lives then actually subsisting, and continued by the above-mentioned Frauds, his Lordship received no great Benefit out of it till some few Years before his Death; when he came to a Resolution not to renew, tho', when all the Lives drop in, this Manor will, at a Rack-rent, amount to at least 3000<HI>l.</HI> a Year.</P>
<P>There is a large old Mansion-house here, lying just on the River, with Gardens formed after the Manner of those at <HI>Parsons-green</HI>; but it is not a kindly Place for ripening Fruit, and the Grounds lie very low and splashy, being all of a stiff Clay, and yet very good Pasture. Here is also a fine Park well timber'd, but without Deer. His Lordship had once a Design to improve this Mansion-house and Estate, and resided here in 1705, when he was called to Court, and sent to command the Queen's Forces in <HI>Spain,</HI> where his Conduct, and great Services to his Country, are too well known to need men∣tioning here.</P>
<P>Tho' this Place is often overflowed with Water, yet there is none good, either for Brewing or Wash∣ing, or any Spring of sweet Water. Here is a Spring of a chalybeat Kind, which would turn to good Account, were it not in such a distant, and an almost inaccessible Part of the Country, occasioned by bad Roads, which were a great Protection to the Inhabitants in the late Civil Wars, who were never visited by either Party; but injoyed an easy and uninterrupted Repose, whlist their Neighbours, on all Sides, were involved in the Calamities of that un∣natural War.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="48"/>Here is likewise a good neat Church, with one of the best-built, high, square Towers I ever saw, raised at the Expence of one of the Lords of <HI>Dantsey,</HI> probably the afore-mentioned <HI>Henry,</HI> who lies buried here under a very large magnificent Tomb. Here likewise is interred Lieutenant-General <HI>Lewis Mor∣daunt,</HI> a Brother of the late Earl, a Gentleman noted for his great Wit, Humour, and polite Con∣versation, as indeed all his Brothers were, as well as his Lordship.</P>
<P><HI>Castlecomb</HI> is a Village of small Account.</P>
<P><HI>Chippenham</HI> is a corporate, good Market-town, likewise on the River <HI>Avon,</HI> over which it has a Bridge of Sixteen Arches, famous for the Residence and Resort of many of the West <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, par∣ticularly <HI>Alfred.</HI> Here is a very magnificent Church; and near this Place, formerly, was a famous Forest.</P>
<P><HI>Bradford</HI> is a Market-town, and has a Bridge over the <HI>Avon.</HI> 'Tis well-built of Stone, and lies in the Side of a Hill.</P>
<P><HI>Trubridge</HI> is an antient Market-town, and had formerly a Castle of Seven Towers, but long since destroyed. The Court of the Duchy of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> for this County, is annually held here.</P>
<P><HI>Westbury</HI> is a little Borough Market-town, but was formerly of great Note. Some Quantity of <HI>Roman</HI> Coins have been found here.</P>
<P><HI>Warminster</HI> is noted, as I have said, for the prodi∣gious Quantity of Corn, which is sold in it every Market-day. Upon the Downs, near this Town, are two antient Camps, supposed to be <HI>Danish.</HI></P>
<P>It is observable, That these Five last Towns be∣longed antiently to the Family of the <HI>Hungerfords,</HI> which in King <HI>Edward</HI> IV.'s Reign came by Mar∣riage to the Lord <HI>Hastings,</HI> who being executed in <HI>Richard</HI> III.'s Time, this vast Estate was given by that King to <HI>Howard,</HI> Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> first Earl-Marshal of that Family, in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="49"/>Near <HI>Warminster</HI> is the famous Forest of <HI>Selwood,</HI> called by the antient <HI>Britons, Coedmaur,</HI> i. e. <HI>Great∣wood.</HI> It is 15 Miles in Length, and very thick of Wood.</P>
<P><HI>Mere,</HI> which in the old <HI>Saxon</HI> signifys <HI>Boundary,</HI> as this Place seems to be on the Borders of <HI>Wilts, Somerset,</HI> and <HI>Dorset,</HI> is but a Village, and yet gives Name to the Hundred where it stands. It has neither Fair nor Market in it; but it had, antiently, a Castle. Not far from this Place is an old <HI>Danish</HI> Camp called <HI>Whiteshole-hill.</HI> Sir <HI>Francis Cotton,</HI> who flourished in the Reign of King <HI>James,</HI> and afterwards of <HI>Charles</HI> I. was born here.</P>
<P>A little South-east of <HI>Mere</HI> lies <HI>Hindon,</HI> a small Borough and Market-town. And North-east of it stands <HI>Heightsbury,</HI> an inconsiderable Town; but noted formerly for an Hospital.</P>
<P><HI>Lavington</HI> is also a little more North; a very in∣different Market-town.</P>
<P>The <HI>Devizes</HI> is excellently situated, about Two Miles from the Bottom of the Hills, which keep off the Eastern Winds, and in a rich Soil. Under the Hill, at <HI>Runway,</HI> is an excellent Spring, which the Inhabitants have not yet found Means to convey thither, tho' it runs but a little way off the Town, where they want Water. It is a very large old Town, consisting chiefly of Two long parallel Streets, the Houses mostly of Tim∣ber, but of a very good Model. The Inhabitants value themselves for being Tenants to the King, and for one of the best weekly Markets in <HI>England.</HI> The Castle was originally <HI>Roman,</HI> judiciously seated upon a natural Fortification; but in After-times, made in a manner impregnable by <HI>Roger,</HI> a Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> tho' now it suffers daily by Peoples taking away the Materials. Here are Two Churches. The Choir of <HI>St. Mary's</HI> is of a very old Model, as are the Steeple, Choir, and both Wings of <HI>St. John's,</HI> to which Additions have been made; and new wide Windows with pointed
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>
Arches, in the room of the antient, narrow, semi∣circular ones.</P>
<P>Just out of Town is a pretty Plain called <HI>the Green,</HI> with another handsome Church and Steeple, Suburbs to the old Town. Here <HI>William Cadby,</HI> a Gardener, dug up his Collection of Gods, which he carried about for a Shew. They were found in a Garden in a Cavity inclosed with <HI>Roman</HI> Brick. The <HI>Venus</HI> is of an excel∣lent Design; and the <HI>Vestal Virgin,</HI> as they call it, a Fragment of <HI>Corinthian</HI> Brass, and of very curious Workmanship. <HI>Vulcan</HI> is as lame as if made at a Forge. He had also several Coins found thereabouts, and a Brass <HI>Roman</HI> Key, which my Lord <HI>Winchelsea</HI> bought. <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities are discovered here every Day. The same Nobleman has a Brass <HI>Probus</HI>; on the Reverse <HI>Victoria Germ.</HI> with a Trophy. A great Number of such Reliques is to be met with all round the Country.</P>
<P><HI>Calne</HI> is a little Town, situate on a stony Hill, and very antient, and is supposed to have been one of the Seats of the <HI>West-Saxon</HI> Kings. It has a neat Church, and a good weekly Market. After a great Rain, in <HI>November</HI> 1725, the Waters rose so very high here, on a sudden, that they overflow'd the Town, damaged a great Quantity of Goods, drowned Two Men in the Street, and carried off a Cask of Oil of 100 Gallons, which could not be found for several Days after. A great Parcel of <HI>Roman</HI> Coins were dug up here formerly. Here was, likewise, antiently an Hospital of <HI>Black Canons.</HI></P>
<P>I am now come into the Road to <HI>Marlborough:</HI> On the Downs, about Two or Three Miles from the Town, are abundance of loose Stones, lying scattered about the Plain, some whereof are very large, and appear to be of the same Kind with those of <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> and some larger: they are called by the Country People, the <HI>Grey Weathers</HI>; and it must be confessed, that they look not unlike Sheep straggling upon the
<PB N="50" REF="51"/>
Downs, on a transient and distant View, as Travellers pass. These <HI>Grey Weathers,</HI> on a more curious Inspection, are found to be a Sort of white Marble, and lie upon the Surface of the Ground in infinite Numbers, and of all Dimensions. They are loose, detached from any Rock, and, as Dr. <HI>Stukeley</HI> thinks, lay there ever since the Creation, being solid Parts thrown out to the Surface of the fluid Globe, when its Rotation was first impressed.</P>
<P><HI>Marlborough,</HI> so called from its Hills of Chalk, which antiently was called <HI>Marle.</HI> It is the <HI>Cunetia</HI> (from <HI>Kenet</HI>) of the <HI>Romans</HI>; but from the coming of the <HI>Saxons</HI> to the Conquest, there is no Mention of it. It is governed by a Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses, and is well-built. It consists chiefly of One broad and strait Street. To the South are some Relicks of a Priory; the Gate-house is still remain∣ing. On the North, the Chapel of another Reli∣gious House remains, now turned into a Dwelling-house. The Seat of my Lord <HI>Hertford</HI> was the Scite of the <HI>Roman Costrum</HI>; for there they find Foundations, and <HI>Roman</HI> Coins; and towards the River, without the Garden-walls, one Angle of it very manifestly remains; and the Rampart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>d Ditch intire. The Road going over the Bridge cuts it off from the present Castle. The Ditch is still 20 Feet wide in some Parts. The Mount, so much noted, was the Keep of the Castle; it is now converted into a pretty spiral Walk, on the Top of which is an octagonal Summer-house, from whence you have a pleasant View over the Town and County. The Town has at present a pretty good Shop-keeping Trade, but not much of the manufacturing Part. The River <HI>Kennet,</HI> some Years ago made navi∣gable by Act of Parliament, rises just by this Town; from whence running to <HI>Hungerford</HI> and <HI>Newbury,</HI> it becomes a large Stream; and passing by <HI>Reading,</HI> runs into the <HI>Thames</HI> near that Town.
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
This River is famous for Crayfish, which they help Travellers to at <HI>Newbury</HI>; but they seldom want for Price.</P>
<P>At <HI>Abury,</HI> near <HI>Marlborough</HI> Downs, in the Way to <HI>Bath,</HI> are to be seen the stupendous Remains of a <HI>Druids</HI> Temple, being a Collection of monstrous Stones of the like Nature with those of <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> and brought together from the Downs for the same re∣ligious Purposes, as Dr. <HI>Stukeley</HI> makes no Question.</P>
<P>On the Hills on this Side the <HI>Devizes</HI> is <HI>Round∣way Down,</HI> where the King's Forces, under Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> but owing chiefly to the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> beat and intirely routed the famous Sir <HI>William Waller,</HI> in the Civil Wars; from whence the Place is called by some, <HI>Run-away Down,</HI> to this Day.</P>
<P>A little nearer towards <HI>Marlborough</HI> is <HI>St. Ann's Hill,</HI> where, notwithstanding several high Hills be∣tween, and the Distance of Twenty-two Miles, or more, is a fair View of <HI>Salisbury</HI> Steeple, or Spire, which is deem'd the highest in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Badmington</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire</HI> have been found <HI>Nine Caves</HI> all in a Row, but of different Dimensions, the least of them Four Feet wide, some Nine or Ten Feet long, Two long Stones being set upon the Sides, and the Top cover'd with broad Stones. Spurs, Pieces of Armour, and the like, have been found in these <HI>Caves</HI>; which gives Ground to believe, that they were Tombs of some antient Warriors, <HI>Romans, Saxons,</HI> or <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P>In our Way from <HI>Marlborough</HI> to <HI>Newbury,</HI> we mounted a chalky Hill, (of which Sort is much of the Soil of <HI>Wilts</HI>) on the Top of which we enter'd into <HI>Savernack</HI> Forest, belonging to the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght Hon. the Lord <HI>Bruce,</HI> and is almost the only privileged Ground of Hunting, of that Denomination, possess'd by a Subject. It is in Circumference about Twelve Miles, plentifully stock'd with Deer of a large Size,
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
and render'd very pleasant and delightful by the many Walks and Vistas lately cut and levell'd through the several Coppices and Woods with which it abounds. Eight of these Vistas meet like so many Rays of a Star, in a Point near the Middle of the Forest, where his Lordship has prepared and cleared the Ground for erecting an Octagon Tower, whose Sides will be correspondent to the Vistas, thro' one of which you will have a View of his Lordship's Seat at about Two Miles Distance, called <HI>Tottenham,</HI> from a Park of that Name, in which it is situate, con∣tiguous to the Forest.</P>
<P>It is a stately Edifice, newly erected on the same Spot of Ground where stood an antient Palace, de∣stroyed by Fire, of the Marquis of <HI>Hereford,</HI> so justly celebrated for his steady Adherence, and power∣ful Assistance, to the Royal Cause, during the whole Course of the Civil Wars, from whom his Lordship is descended, by his Mother the Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Sister and Niece to the Two last Dukes of <HI>Somer∣set,</HI> of the elder Line.</P>
<P>To give you some Idea of the Grandeur and Magnificence of the Structure, it will be suffi∣cient to observe, that it was begun, carried on and finish'd, after the Model, and under the Direction, of our modern <HI>Vitruvius,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Burlington,</HI> who, to the Strength and Convenience of the <HI>English</HI> Architecture, has added the Elegance and Politeness of the <HI>Italian</HI> Taste.</P>
<P>The House has Four Towers, and Four Fronts, each of them diversly beautified and adorned; to which are now added Four Wings, wherein are Rooms of State, a noble and capacious Room for a Library, containing a judicious and large Collection of several Thousand Books in all Languages, but especially the modern.</P>
<P>The Beauty and Delightfulness of the Buildings are much augmented by the large Canals, the spa∣cious
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
and well-planted Walks which surround it, one of which, leading to the <HI>London</HI> Road, extends Two Miles in Length.</P>
<P>About the same Distance from hence, on the op∣posite Side, are to be seen the Remains of a large House, the Seat of Sir <HI>John Seymour,</HI> Father of the unfortunate Protector, call'd <HI>Wolf-Hall,</HI> of which no more is standing than suffices for a Farm-house. Here King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. as, Tradition goes, cele∣brated his Nuptials with the Lady <HI>Jane Seymour,</HI> and kept his Wedding-dinner, in a very large Barn, hung with Tapestry on the Occasion; for Confirm∣ation of which they shew you, in the Walls thereof, some Tenter-hooks, with small Pieces of Tapestry fasten'd to them; and between this Place and <HI>Totten∣ham</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re is a Walk, with old Trees on each Side, still known by the Name of King <HI>Harry</HI>'s Walk.</P>
<P>From hence, continuing our Course Easterly, we came to a Borough-town, called <HI>Great Bedwin,</HI> which Dr. <HI>Stukeley</HI> takes to be the <HI>Leucomagus</HI> of <HI>Ravennas.</HI> It is an old Corporation, and gave Birth to the fa∣mous Dr. <HI>T. Willis,</HI> the Ornament of <HI>English</HI> Phy∣sicians. <HI>Castle Copse,</HI> half a Mile from the Town South East, was probably the <HI>Roman</HI> Castle; and <HI>Havisdike,</HI> a Camp of that People. Some time since there was in the East Window of the Church, the Picture of a Priest, with Two Crutches, a Cup in his Hand, and a Can standing by him, with an Inscription in old <HI>English</HI> Capitals, but in the Lan∣guage obsolete <HI>French,</HI> which in <HI>English</HI> is this:
<Q><L><HI>I am</HI> Peris <HI>call'd, Vicar of this Church,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Upon my Crutches leaning just in this wise;</HI></L>
<L><HI>My Pouch in my Fist, and I'll drink without Guile,</HI></L>
<L><HI>My Pot at my Back, set after the new Mode.</HI></L>
<L><HI>To my Pot and my Pouch I will have Justice done;</HI></L>
<L><HI>For none shall drink without putting in as much again.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55"/>The Church is large and capacious, in which are some antient Monuments, particularly one of a <HI>Knight-Templar,</HI> call'd <HI>Adam of Scott,</HI> from a Manor of that Name in the Parish, with an Inscription not legible, and another above-mentioned of Sir <HI>John Seymour,</HI> Father of the Protector, wherein we have an Account of the Names of all his Children, with their several Inter-marriages and Deaths The Church is very strongly built with Flint, and a Ce∣ment near as hard as themselves, in form of a Cross, in the Centre of which is erected a high Tower, containing a good Ring of Six very musical Bells.</P>
<P>Moving hence towards the North-east a little, we cross'd the much fam'd <HI>Wansdyke,</HI> a Work of prodigious Labour and Expence, and concluded by most Writers to be a Boundary of one of the King∣doms of the <HI>Heptarchy,</HI> probably that of the <HI>West Saxons,</HI> before its Inlargement by incroaching on other Kingdoms. It may be traced from near <HI>Bath,</HI> all over the Downs, to this Place, where it turns its Course towards the Southern Coasts: it is supposed, by some, to derive its Name from <HI>Woden,</HI> one of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Deities.</P>
<P>Soon after we mounted a small Hill, of easy Ascent, on the Summit of which was erected, as Historians inform us, a fortified Place, the Residence of <HI>Cissa,</HI> a Viceroy of one of the <HI>South-Saxon</HI> Kings, from whom it derives its Denomination of <HI>Chisbury,</HI> or <HI>Cisbury,</HI> who also built <HI>Chichester,</HI> for the Resort of his People, as he did this for the Repose of him∣self. It seems to have been strongly fortified, being surrounded with a double Ditch or Mote, of con∣siderable Depth and Breadth, and full of Water: since which time there has been a Religious House here, the Chapel of which is still remaining, but converted into a Barn.</P>
<P>From hence we returned to the great <HI>London</HI> Road, and soon arrived at a Village called <HI>Froxfield,</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
about Seven Miles from <HI>Marlborough,</HI> in which is a handsome and well-endow'd Alms-house, founded by <HI>Sarah</HI> Duchess Dowager of <HI>Somerset,</HI> Relict of <HI>John</HI> the last Duke of the elder Branch of the noble Family of <HI>Seymours,</HI> descended from the great Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> Protector of the King and Kingdom, during the Minority of King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. This Lady bequeath'd by her Will above 2000<HI>l.</HI> for the Building and Furniture of this Alms-house, and de∣vised several Manors, Messuages, and Farms, for the Maintenance of Thirty poor Widows, not have∣ing 20<HI>l. per Ann</HI> to subsist upon; one Half of which are Widows of Clergymen, and the other of Lay∣men, giving a Preference to those of the last Sort, who live on the Manors so devised by her. She left in her Will particular Directions for the Form, Di∣mensions, and Scite of the Structure, and for the Manner of electing, ruling, and providing for the Widows, which her Executors, especially Sir <HI>Wil∣liam Gregory,</HI> who chiefly took upon him the Execu∣tion of the Trust, punctually observ'd.</P>
<P>The Building is neat and strong, in the Form of a Quadrangle, having one Front, and a Court before it facing the Road. It contains Thirty Ground∣rooms, and as many Chambers, one of each Sort being allowed to every Widow, for her Apartment, with an Area or Bed in a Garden, on the North Part of the Building, inclosed with a Brick-wall.</P>
<P>In the midst of the Quadrangle is built a hand∣some and convenient Chapel, furnished with a Com∣munion-Table, Pulpit, Desk, Pews and Books, for the Use of the Widows, wherein the Chaplain, whose Stipend is 30<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> is to read Prayers every Day, and to preach on <HI>Sundays:</HI> and for his further Encouragement, is to be presented, on a Va∣cancy, to the Rectory of <HI>Kemish,</HI> in the same County, which the Duchess has appropriated to that Use. Besides the yearly Pension in Money, which
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
is now about Eight Guineas, she hath also ordered a Cloth-gown, with a certain Quantity of Wood every Winter, to each of the Widows: and when the Estates which she has given to the said Alms∣house, (many of which are now demised upon Leases for Lives) shall fall in, and shall produce a clear yearly Income of more than 400<HI>l.</HI> she hath ap∣pointed additional Lodgings to be built for the Re∣ception of Twenty more Widows, who are to be placed on the same Establishment, elected and pro∣vided for in the same manner as the Thirty former; and then all the Rents and Profits of the said Estates (the Salary for the Chaplain and a Steward being first deducted) shall be distributed in equal Shares and Proportions between the Fifty Widows.</P>
<P>The Produce of all the Estates devised to this, and another charitable Use, which I shall mention by-and-by, upon the Determination of the Leases granted, will, according to the best Information I could get, amount to little less than 1000<HI>l. per Ann.</HI></P>
<P>This truly useful and excellent Charity, which displays the Judgment, as well as charitable Disposi∣tion, of the noble Foundress, is under the Inspection and Management of several worthy Gentlemen and Clergymen of the Neighbourhood, who discharge the Trust reposed in them with a very laudable Dili∣gence and Integrity, <HI>scrupulously,</HI> or religiously ra∣ther, pursuing the Directions of the Will, care∣fully preventing all Imbezelments, and frequently meeting, at their own Expence, for the Dispatch of Business in the Execution of their Trust; which worthy Example, if imitated by other Trustees or Directors of charitable Benefactions, (who too often make a Property of their Trust) would be of pub∣lick Emolument, and singular Benefit to the Poor, by rescuing charitable Devises from the Discourage∣ment they now lie under, and rendering unnecessary
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
the Trouble and Expence of applying for, and suing out Commissions of Charitable Uses.</P>
<P>The same charitable Lady, to make Provision for the helpless Young, as well as destitute Old, has also bequeathed a considerable yearly Sum for the apprenticing of Ten or Twelve Children, in which a Preference is to be given to such as were born in her Manors. In the Management of which Trust, another Set of Trustees act, with the same commend∣able Uncorruptness and Integrity as the former.</P>
<P>We next came to <HI>Hungerford,</HI> a little Market∣town, situate in a Moorish-place, remarkable only for being a great Thoroughfare to <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Bri∣stol,</HI> and for Plenty of Trout and Crayfish. It is governed by the Lord of the Manor, as Constable, who is however chosen annually into that Office. From this Town the antient Family of the Barons of <HI>Hungerford</HI> took their Name and Title. The first of the Family was the first Speaker of the House of Commons, in 51. <HI>Edward</HI> III. They possess'd a vast Estate this Way, and in all the neighbouring Counties, which was twice forfeited for their At∣tachment to the House of <HI>Lancaster.</HI> This vast Estate fell by a Daughter to the famous Lord <HI>Hast∣ings,</HI> who was executed in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> III. when <HI>Howard,</HI> first Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> had a Grant of it from that Prince, who falling with his Master in the Battle of <HI>Bosworth-Field,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. restored it, with the Honour, to a younger Branch of the <HI>Hungerfords,</HI> who had joined him, and shared in the Glory of that Victory. But his De∣scendants suffer'd Death for Treason, 31 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. tho' Queen <HI>Mary</HI> restored them again. He was the Third of the Family who died for Treason: such Vicissitudes attended this noble Family, and their great Estate.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="59"/>We pursued the great Road, and arrived at <HI>New∣bury,</HI> situate in a most fruitful Plain, and water'd by the River <HI>Kennet,</HI> which is made navigable up to the Town, which carries on a very great Trade in Malt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with <HI>London.</HI> It is governed by a Mayor, High Steward, Aldermen and Burgesses. The Streets are spacious, and the Market-place large, where there is great Store of Corn sold; and a Hall for the Business of the Corporation stands in it.</P>
<P>Here is also a good Charity-school, very well en∣dow'd, and this Place is noted for good Trout and Crayfish.</P>
<P>Near this Town was a double Scene of Blood; for here were Two obstinate Battles fought at different Times, between the King's Army and the Parlia∣ment's, King <HI>Charles</HI> being present at them both, and both were fought almost upon the same Spot of Ground. In these Two Battles it was observed by an experienced Soldier, who served in the King's Army, that the Generals on both Sides shewed the most exquisite Skill in the managing, posting, bringing up, and drawing off their Troops; and the Men fought with equal Bravery. In the first of these Battles the Success was doubtful, and both Sides claim'd the Advantage: in the last, the King's Army had apparently the worst of it, and yet the King in a very few Days, with a great Body of Horse, brought off his Cannon, which he had, in the Close of the Battle, thrown into <HI>Dunington</HI> Castle, and carried them away to <HI>Oxford,</HI> the Head Quarter of his Army; and this he did in the Sight of the victorious Army, facing them at the same time with a Body of Six thousand Horse; they, on the other hand, not thinking fit to draw out to at∣tack him. That Retreat, in point of Honour, was equal to a Victory, and gave new Courage, as well as Reputation, to the King's Troops.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60"/>Part of <HI>Newbury</HI> is also known by the Name of <HI>Spinham-lands.</HI> For it arose out of the Ruins of an old Town, called <HI>Spine,</HI> the Remains of which now join to <HI>Newbury,</HI> in respect to which it was called <HI>New Borough,</HI> and for Shortness <HI>Newbury.</HI> It is noted, among other Things, for Two or Three good Inns, where Travellers are well accommodated.</P>
<P>This Town of <HI>Newbury</HI> was an antient Clothing Town, tho' now little of that Business remains to it; but it retains still a manufacturing Genius, and the People are generally imployed in making Shalloon, which, tho' it be used only for the Lining and Insides of Mens Cloaths, yet it becomes so generally worn both at home and abroad, that it is increased to a Manufacture by itself, and is more considerable than any single Manufacture of Stuffs in the Nation. This imploys the Town of <HI>Newbury,</HI> as also <HI>Ando∣ver,</HI> a Town I have already described, and many others in different Counties of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Here lived the famous <HI>Jack of Newbury,</HI> the greatest Clothier that ever was in <HI>England,</HI> having 100 Looms at work in his own House. He flourish∣ed in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and marched at the Head of 100 of his own Men, all cloath'd and maintain'd by himself, to the Battle of <HI>Flodden-Field,</HI> where he behav'd well. He rebuilt Part of <HI>New∣bury</HI> Church, and the whole Tower of it. This is One of the Two Legatee Towns (as they were called) in the Will of the famous Mr. <HI>Kenrick,</HI> who being the Son of a Clothier of <HI>Newbury,</HI> and after∣wards a Merchant in <HI>London,</HI> left 4000<HI>l.</HI> to <HI>New∣bury,</HI> and 7500<HI>l.</HI> to <HI>Reading,</HI> to encourage the Cloth∣ing Trade, and to set the Poor at Work, besides other Gifts of extraordinary Value to the Poor.</P>
<P>This Gentleman's Will is to be seen at large in <HI>Stow</HI>'s <HI>Survey of London,</HI> to which I refer.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61"/>What Improvement the Towns of <HI>Newbury</HI> and <HI>Reading</HI> have made of these great Sums, I did not inquire into.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Newbury</HI> the late Earl of <HI>Craven</HI> built a very stately Pile of Buildings for his own Dwelling, called <HI>Spine</HI>; but as it was never quite finished, so I do not understand, that his Lordship ever came to live in it, and some Years ago it was by a sudden Fire burnt down to the Ground. It was reported, that that Lord built this magnificent Palace, (for such it really was) at a Time when he had Hopes of marrying Madame Royale, as she was then called, <HI>viz.</HI> the Queen of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> Sister to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. who, then a Widow, lived under the Shadow of the <HI>English</HI> Coutt; but being frustrated in that View, the Earl went no farther in his Building. But his present Lordship has lately rebuilt this House, and tho' not in so grand a manner as the former, it is very commodious.</P>
<P>Westward, a little out of our Way, we visited the Ruins of the Castle of <HI>Donnington,</HI> just mention'd, which was seated on the Brow of a high Hill, washed by the little River <HI>Lambourn,</HI> and had been the Seat of Sir <HI>Geoffrey Chaucer,</HI> Father of <HI>English</HI> Poetry. They shew us a Place here, where, in his Days, as well as many Years since, even down to the Memo∣ry of some of the Inhabitants now living, flourished a great Oak, call'd <HI>Chaucer</HI>'s <HI>Oak,</HI> where they very gravely tell you he used to sit and compose his Poems.</P>
<P>We went forward to the Town of <HI>Lambourn,</HI> so called from the River which runs down and falls into the <HI>Kennet,</HI> near <HI>Thatcham.</HI> It is situate on the South-side of <HI>White-Horse-Hill,</HI> and has a Market. This River is remarkable for being very low in Win∣ter, and high in Summer. It goes off about <HI>Michael∣mas,</HI> and the sooner it goes, the more plentiful, say
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
the Inhabitants, will that Year be. This Town is likewise noted for the Birth-place, or at least, the Residence of the Poet <HI>Sylvester,</HI> who celebrates the River in the following Lines:
<Q><L><HI>And little</HI> Lambesbourn —</L>
<L><HI>All Summer long, while all thy Sisters shrink,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Then of thy Waters Thousands daily drink;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Besides, shed Water, which in haste doth run</HI></L>
<L><HI>To wash the Feet of</HI> Chaucer's Donnington;</L>
<L><HI>But while the rest are full unto the Top,</HI></L>
<L><HI>All Summer long thou dost not shed a Drop,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nor send'st a Doit of needless Subsidy</HI></L>
<L><HI>To cram the</HI> Kennet<HI>'s wantless Treasury,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Before her Stores be spent, and Springs be staid:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Then, then, alone, thou lend'st a lib'ral Aid,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Teaching thy wealthy Neighbours (mine of late)</HI></L>
<L><HI>How, when, and where, to right participate</HI></L>
<L><HI>Their Streams of Comfort to the Poor that pine,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And not to grease the still too greasy Swine;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Neither for Fame or Form (when others do)</HI></L>
<L><HI>To give a Morsel, or a Mite or two,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But sev'rally, and of a selfly Motion,</HI></L>
<L><HI>When others miss, to give the most Devotion.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>At <HI>Newbury</HI> we quitted the high Road, and being desirous to see something of the North of <HI>Berkshire,</HI> we struck up to <HI>Islip,</HI> which tho' but an inconsider∣able little Town, yet has a good weekly Market for Sheep.</P>
<P>We passed North-eastward to <HI>Wantage,</HI> a Town of some Antiquity, pretty good and neat. It is noted for the Birth-place of the renowned King <HI>Alfred,</HI> and is watered by the <HI>Och.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Wantage</HI> we advanced into the fine and fertile Vale of <HI>White-Horse,</HI> which extends almost from <HI>Farringdon</HI> to <HI>Abington,</HI> tho' not in a direct Line. Looking South from the Vale, we see a
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
Trench cut on the Side of a high green Hill, in the Shape of a Horse, and not ill done. The Trench is about a Yard deep, and fill'd almost up with Chalk; so that at a Distance you see the exact Shape of a <HI>White-Horse,</HI> so large as takes up near an Acre of Ground. From this Figure the Hill is called <HI>White-Horse-Hill,</HI> and the Vale below takes also its Name. 'Tis said to be done in order to commemorate a signal Victory; and some give it to the <HI>Saxons,</HI> whose Device was, and still is, a white Horse. West∣ward of this Vale, lies <HI>Ashbury,</HI> betwixt which and <HI>Wantage</HI> is a very large Camp on the Brow of a Hill: 'tis single work'd, and of a quadrangular Form, which shews it a <HI>Roman</HI> Work.</P>
<P>The neighbouring Parish to this <HI>White-Horse</HI> have a Custom annually at <HI>Midsummer,</HI> to go and weed it, in order to keep it in Shape and Colour; and when they have done their Work, they end the Day in Feasting and Meriment.</P>
<P>We arrived at <HI>Farringdon,</HI> noted for its pleasant Situation on a Hill. It has a very good Market weekly, and is very neat and clean. In this Place may be seen the Ruins of a Castle, built by <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> in King <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Reign. Here was also a Priory of <HI>Cistertian</HI> Monks. The Church is large and handsome.</P>
<P>From hence we went partly by the Forest to <HI>Abingdon,</HI> a handsome well-built Town, where the Assizes and Sessions, and other publick Meet∣ings of the County, are generally held. Here is a stately Market-house, built on high Pillars, over which is a large Hall for the Assizes. The Town consists of several well-paved Streets, which centre in an open and spacious Place, where the Corn-market is kept. They make great Quantities of Malt here, and send it up by Barges to <HI>London.</HI> Here is a good Free-School, and also a Charity-School.
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
The Corporation is governed by a Mayor, Two Bailiffs, and Nine Aldermen.</P>
<P>It is an antient Town, and was famed for Reli∣gious Houses in the Time of the antient <HI>Britons.</HI> It was also famous for having several Synods held there, and for one of the noblest Abbeys in the King∣dom, founded, as it is said, by <HI>Heane,</HI> Nephew to <HI>Cissa,</HI> Father to King <HI>Ina. Henry</HI> I. was educated in this Monastery.</P>
<P>We next came to <HI>Wallingford,</HI> called by the antient <HI>Britons Gwal Hen,</HI> i. e. <HI>Old Fort,</HI> a Place of great Figure, as well in their Days and of the <HI>Romans,</HI> as of the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Danes,</HI> the last of whom destroyed it in 1006; but it was soon rebuilt, and esteemed a Borough, in the <HI>Confessor</HI>'s Time. It has been defended by a strong Castle, which has been long since demolish'd. It is still a large well-built Town, has a good Market-place and Town-hall, where the Assizes have been sometimes held, and a Quarter-session for the Borough always. It has still Two Churches standing; but one was very much damaged in the Civil Wars, when Two others here were altogether destroyed. It has Two weekly Markets, and is govern'd by a Mayor, Burgesses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Here we cross'd the <HI>Thames</HI> into <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> and leaving <HI>Wathington,</HI> a little inconsiderable Market-town on the Left, we fell down thro' <HI>Netlebed</HI> (like∣wise a Town of little Note) to <HI>Henley upon Thames,</HI> a very antient Town, the Name being deriv'd from the <HI>British</HI> Word <HI>Hen-lley,</HI> i. e. <HI>Old Place.</HI> It was formerly part of the Estate of the Barons of <HI>Hunger∣ford,</HI> mentioned before. It is now a Corporation of great Account, govern'd by a Warden, Burgesses, and other Officers. It has a considerable Corn and Malt-market. The Inhabitants are mostly Maltsters, Mealmen and Bargemen, who by carrying Corn and Timber to <HI>London,</HI> get a gainful Living, and inrich
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
the Neighbourhood. It has a good Free Grammar School, and also a Charity School, liberally endow'd for teaching, cloathing, and apprenticing several poor Children. Here is also an Alms-house, but meanly endowed; for tho' there are not above Six or Seven Persons in it, they have but Six-pence a-piece weekly for their Allowance.</P>
<P>We return'd over a wooden Bridge, into <HI>Berkshire</HI>; and as <HI>Thatcham, Woolhampton</HI> and <HI>Theal,</HI> which lie between <HI>Newbury</HI> and <HI>Reading,</HI> are at present noted only for being great Thoroughfare Towns, and full of Inns, we went no further back than <HI>Reading.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reading</HI> is so called from the <HI>British</HI> Word <HI>Rhedin,</HI> i. e. <HI>Fern,</HI> which formerly grew in great Quantity there. It is a very large and wealthy Town, hand∣somly built, the Inhabitants rich, and driving a very great Trade. The Town is situated on the River <HI>Kennet,</HI> but so near the <HI>Thames,</HI> that the largest Barges which they use, may come up to the Town Bridge, where they have Wharfs to load and unload them. Their chief Trade is by this Water-naviga∣tion to and from <HI>London,</HI> tho' they have necessarily a great Trade into the Country, for the Consumption of the Goods which they bring by their Barges from <HI>London,</HI> and particularly Coals, Salt, Grocery Wares, Tobacco, Oils, and all heavy Goods.</P>
<P>They send from hence to <HI>London</HI> by these Barges, very great Quantities of Malt and Meal, and these are the Two principal Articles of their Loadings. Some of those Barges are so large, that I was told, they bring a Thousand, or Twelve hundred Quar∣ters of Malt at a time, which, according to the ordinary Computation of Tonnage in the Freight of other Vessels, is from a Hundred to an Hundred and Twenty Ton, dead Weight.</P>
<P>They also send very great Quantities of Timber from <HI>Reading</HI>; for <HI>Berkshire</HI> being a well-wooded
<PB N="65" REF="66"/>
County, and the River <HI>Thames</HI> a convenient Con∣veyance for the Timber, they transport the largest and fairest of the Timber to <HI>London,</HI> which is generally bought by the Shipwrights in the River for the build∣ing Merchant-Ships. The like Trade of Timber is carried on at <HI>Henley</HI> above-mentioned, and at <HI>Maiden-head</HI>; of which in its Place.</P>
<P>A large Manufacture of Sail-Cloth was set up in <HI>Reading</HI> by the late Sir <HI>Owen Buckingham,</HI> Lord-Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and many of the poor People were profitably imployed in it; but Sir <HI>Owen</HI> dying, and his Son being unhappily kill'd in a Duel a little while after, that Manufacture died also.</P>
<P>Here is however still a Remnant of the Woollen Manufacture, which was once carried on in it to a very considerable Degree; and this Town, as well as <HI>Newbury,</HI> has injoy'd the above-mentioned Legacies of Mr. <HI>Kenrick,</HI> to set the Poor at Work, and incourage the Clothing Trade; <HI>viz.</HI> 7500<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Camden</HI>'s Continuator says, there were once 140 Master-Clothiers in this one Town; but now they are almost all gone. During the Civil Wars in <HI>England</HI> this Town was strongly fortified, and the Remains of the Bastions and other Works are still to be seen.</P>
<P>There are Three Churches built of Flint and square Stones in the quincunx Fashion, with tall Tow∣ers of the same. Here are also Two large Meeting-houses, besides that of the Quakers. <HI>Camden</HI> calls it a little City: it is said to contain about 8000 People, including a little Hamlet at the Bridge over the <HI>Thames.</HI> Archbishop <HI>Laud</HI> was born in this Town.</P>
<P>It was formerly noted for a very famous Abbey, and other Religious Foundations. The Abbey stood in a charming Situation, and large Ruins of it are still visible, built of Flint: the Walls which remain are about Eight Feet thick, tho' the Stone that
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
faced them is gone. What is left is so hard cemented, that the Labour in separating them would not be answer'd by their Use. There are many Remnants of arch'd Vaults, a good Height above Ground, whereon stood, as may be presum'd, the Hall, Lodg∣ings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Abbey Gate-house is yet pretty in∣tire.</P>
<P>This was built by King <HI>Henry</HI> I. on an old Abbey, formerly erected by a <HI>Saxon</HI> Lady. That Prince was buried in it, with his Queen; but their Monuments are lost in the Ruins of the Place, and no-where to be found.</P>
<P>There was a famous old Castle, long since de∣molished.</P>
<P>The Empress <HI>Maud,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Henry</HI> I. was also buried here; but her Monument is lost, as well as the others. It bore this Inscription, as we are assur'd:
<Q><L><HI>Magna ortu, majorque viro, sed maxima partu,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Hic jacet</HI> Henrici <HI>filia, sponsa, parens.</HI></L></Q> <HI>Thus translated:</HI>
<Q><L>Illustrious in Descent, in Marriage more,</L>
<L>But noblest in her Offspring's Royal Pow'r,</L>
<L>Great <HI>Henry</HI>'s Daughter, Parent, Wife, deplore.</L></Q></P>
<P>The deceas'd Earl <HI>Cadogan,</HI> who was created Baron of <HI>Reading,</HI> by his late Majesty King <HI>George</HI> I. in 1716, built a fine large House at <HI>Caversham</HI> near <HI>Reading</HI>; which his Successor the present Lord <HI>Ca∣dogan</HI> thought fit to reduce to a smaller and more convenient Size, as less regarding the outward Glare of Magnificence, than Use and Convenience.</P>
<P>At <HI>Reading,</HI> in the Year 1688, began the univer∣sal Alarm that spread over the whole Kingdom (al∣most at the same time) of the <HI>Irish</HI> being coming to cut every body's Throats; which was carried from
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
Town to Town by Peoples Fears and Terrors, aggra∣vated by the Menaces of an <HI>Irish</HI> Detachment of Soldiers, who were beat out of <HI>Reading</HI> by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and prevented taking the Quarters they in∣tended at <HI>Maidenhead, Colebrook, Stanes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is impossible to express the Consternation of the People all over <HI>England</HI> on this Occasion; for the terrible Story spread (like the Undulations of the Wa∣ter in a Pond, when a flat Stone is cast upon the Surface) all over the Kingdom, as I have said, in one Day; for Fear gave Wings to the News: no Post could carry it as it flew from Town to Town; and still every Messenger had Two Articles with him: 1. Not that such and such Towns <HI>were to be</HI> burnt and plundered by them; but that they <HI>were already</HI> burnt: And, 2. that the <HI>Irish</HI> were at their Heels to do the like there. And the Service this Report did to the Cause of the Revolution, is hardly to be imagined.</P>
<P><HI>Twyford</HI> is about Five Miles East of <HI>Reading,</HI> and is only noted, like <HI>Theale,</HI> and the other Towns beyond <HI>Reading,</HI> for its Number of Inns, for the Accommodations of Carriers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Just beyond <HI>Theale,</HI> is <HI>Inglefield,</HI> where King <HI>Ethet∣wolf</HI> routed the <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Reading</HI> I went to <HI>Great Marlow</HI> in <HI>Buck∣inghamshire,</HI> which, though not in the direct Road, yet lying on the Banks of the River <HI>Thames,</HI> is pro∣per enough to be spoken of, and is particularly worth Notice for several Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a Town of very great Imbarkation on the <HI>Thames,</HI> not so much for Manufactures wrought here, (for the Trade of the Town is chiefly in <HI>Bone∣lace</HI>) but for Goods brought from the neighbouring Towns; a very great Quantity of Malt and Meal particularly being brought hither from <HI>High Wick∣ham,</HI> which is one of the greatest Corn-markets on
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>
this Side of <HI>England,</HI> and lies on the Road from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Between <HI>High Wickham</HI> and <HI>Marlow</HI> is a little River called the <HI>Loddon,</HI> on which are a great many Corn-mills, and some Paper-mills: the first of these grind and dress the Wheat, and then the Meal is sent to <HI>Marlow,</HI> and put on board the Barges for <HI>London</HI>; and the second make great Quantities of ordinary Printing-paper.</P>
<P N="3">3. On the <HI>Thames,</HI> just by the Side of this Town, tho' on the other Bank, are Three very remarkable Mills, called the <HI>Temple-Mills,</HI> or the <HI>Brass-Mills,</HI> for making <HI>Bisham</HI> Abbey <HI>Battery Work,</HI> as they call it, <HI>viz.</HI> Brass Kettles and Pans, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of all Sorts. And these Works were attended with no small Suc∣cess, 'till in the Year 1720. they made a Bubble of it, and then it ran the Fate of all the Bubbles at that time.</P>
<P N="4">4. Next to these are Two Mills which are both of an extraordinary Kind, one for making of Thim∣bles, a Work which performs to Admiration; and another for pressing of Oyl from Rape and Flax∣seed, both which turn to very good Account to the Proprietors.</P>
<P>Hither is also brought down a vast Quantity of Beech Wood, which grows in <HI>Buckinghamshire</HI> more plen∣tifully than in any other Part of <HI>England</HI>; and from whence the County itself derives its Name.</P>
<P>At <HI>Bisham,</HI> over-against this Town, was formerly an Abbey, and the Remains of it are still to be seen. The Estate belong'd once to the <HI>Knights Templars,</HI> and since came to the antient Family of <HI>Hobby,</HI> whereof Sir <HI>William Hobby,</HI> and Sir <HI>Edward Hobby,</HI> are noted in our Histories, the latter as having been imploy'd by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in the most important foreign Negotiations, as a learned Man, and great Antiquary. Their Monuments, with those of their Ladies and Children, are in the little Church of
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
<HI>Bisham,</HI> and well worth seeing. The Seat of the Family is now in <HI>Dorsetshire</HI>; but hither they are generally all brought, when they die, to be buried with their Ancestors.</P>
<P>A little higher, on the same Side of the River, is <HI>Hurley,</HI> an antient Seat of the Lord <HI>Lovela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>; and all the Male Branches of the Family b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g extinct, it came by the Daughter and Heires <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> o S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nry Johnson</HI> of <HI>Blackwall,</HI> near <HI>Ratcliffe,</HI> who origi∣nally was only a Shipwright, or Master-build<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, at the great Yard and Dock there, of which I shall speak in their Place. This Lady left only one Daughter, married to the late Earl of <HI>Strafford.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we fell with the <HI>Thames</HI> into <HI>Maiden∣head,</HI> and so came into the <HI>London</HI> Road again. It is an antient Corporation under the Government of a High Steward, a Mayor, a Steward, and Ten Aldermen, out of which they annually elect Two Bridgmasters to look after the large Timber-bridge which here crosses the <HI>Thames,</HI> for the Repair of which the Town has Three Trees annually allow'd them out of <HI>Windsor</HI> Forest. The Mayor, for the Time being, is Clerk of the Market and Coroner, and he and the Mayor for the preceding Year, and the Steward, are Justices of the Peace: they chuse yearly Two Mace-bearers. The Town is a large Thoroughfare, with many good Inns in it, and has a good Market weekly. It lies in Two Parishes, one Part of it is in <HI>Bray,</HI> famous of old for its con∣forming Vicar to all Times, Changes, and Seasons.</P>
<P>As soon as you are out of <HI>Maidenhead,</HI> you see <HI>Cliefden</HI> on your Left, where <HI>George</HI> Duke of <HI>Buck∣ingham</HI> began a magnificent and delightful Palace, which the late Earl of <HI>Orkney</HI> afterwards purchased of the Family, and finish'd; and now has the Honour to be the Summer Retreat of his Royal Highness <HI>Frederick</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71"/>We came to <HI>Slough,</HI> a Village Five Miles East of <HI>Maidenhead,</HI> which consists almost intirely of Inns. They seem to vie with one another, and 'tis wonder∣ful how they all subsist; and especially as they are opposed by the Two famous new ones of the <HI>Castle</HI> and <HI>Windmill,</HI> a little Way out of <HI>Slough,</HI> which are much more delightfully situated, and have better Accommodations.</P>
<P>Here we left the Road, and turn'd to the Right, and soon arriv'd at <HI>Eton,</HI> where there is the finest School for Grammar Learning, that is in <HI>Britain,</HI> or per∣haps in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Buildings, except the great School-room, are antient; the Chapel <HI>Gothick</HI>; but all has been re∣paired, at a very great Expence, out of the College Stock, within these few Years, and a noble Library built for the Reception of Books.</P>
<P>In the great Court a fine Statue is erected to the Honour of the Founder, by Dr. <HI>Godolphin,</HI> late Dean of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, and Provost of this College; and the Library has receiv'd several considerable Benefactions, particularly very lately, the fine Col∣lection of <HI>Richard Topham,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> formerly Keeper of the Records in the <HI>Tower,</HI> which was presented to it, by the late excellent Lord Chief Justice <HI>Reeves.</HI> And before that a Collection of Books, valu'd at 2000<HI>l.</HI> was left to it by Dr. <HI>Waddington,</HI> late Bi∣shop of <HI>Chichester.</HI></P>
<P>The Gardens, which extend from the College down almost to the Bank of the <HI>Thames,</HI> are well planted and kept.</P>
<P>This College was founded by King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. a Prince munificent in his Gifts for the Incourage∣ment of Learning. Witness, besides this noble Foun∣dation, that of <HI>King</HI>'s College in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> to which the Scholars of <HI>Eton</HI> are annually removed; and which, had it been perfected as he designed it, would have been the noblest Building of the Kind in the
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
World. But his Successor and Deposer, K. <HI>Ed.</HI> IV. took several Manors from <HI>Eton</HI> College, and bestow'd them on their Neighbours at <HI>Windsor</HI>; and had in∣tended to have taken from them still more, had not the celebrated <HI>Jane Shore</HI> solicited in their Behalf.</P>
<P>This College has a settled Revenue of about 5000<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> and maintains a Provost, a Vice-provost, who is also a Fellow; Six other Fellows, and 70 Scholars on the Foundation, besides a full Choir for the Chapel, with necessary Officers and Servants. The School is divided into the upper and lower, and each into Three Classes; each School has One Master, and each Master Four Assistants or Ushers. None are received into the upper School, till they can make <HI>Latin</HI> Verses, and have a tolerable Knowledge of the <HI>Greek.</HI> In the lower School the Children are re∣ceived very young, and are initiated into all School-learning. Besides the Seventy Scholars upon the Foundation, there are always abundance of Chil∣dren, generally speaking, of the best Families, and of Persons of Distinction, who are boarded in the Houses of the Townsmen, and within the College.</P>
<P>The Number of Scholars instructed here used to be from 400 to 500; but has not been, for Seven Years past, more than 320.</P>
<P>The Election of Scholars for the University, out of this School, is made annually on the First <HI>Tuesday</HI> in <HI>August.</HI> In order to it, Three Persons are deputed from <HI>King</HI>'s College in <HI>Cambridge, viz.</HI> the Provost of that College, and One Senior, and One Junior Poser, Fellows of the same; who being join'd by the Provost, the Vice-provost, and the Head Master of <HI>Eton</HI> College, call before them the Scholars of the upper Class, and examining them in the several Parts of their Learning, chuse out Twelve such as they think best qualified, and enter them in a Roll or List for the University. These Youths are not imme∣diately removed from the School, but must wait till

Vacancies fall in <HI>King</HI>'s College; and as such happen, are then taken as they stand in Seniority in the Roll of Election.</P>
<P>When a Scholar from <HI>Eton</HI> comes to <HI>King</HI>'s Col∣lege, he is received upon the Foundation, and pur∣sues his Studies there for Three Years; after which he claims a Fellowship, unless forfeited by Marriage, accepting of Ecclesiastick Preferments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> accord∣ing to the Terms of the Statutes.</P>
<P>The Provost has a noble House and Garden, besides the Use of the College Gardens at his Pleasure.</P>
<P>Will you, Sir, excuse me here a few Lines to the Memory of the late excellent Lord Chief Justice <HI>Reeves,</HI> before-mentioned? This worthy and emi∣nent Lawyer had a Seat in this Town, to which he constantly retired at the Close of every Term, while he was at the Bar; for he would never go the Cir∣cuit, or attend the Court of Chancery; and actually declined accepting of the high Office of a Judge, while his Lady liv'd, chusing rather to spend his Vacations in Retirement with his Family, than either Honour or Profit; yet he was pursued even here with Cases for his Opinion, as being the greatest Lawyer of his Time; and these were conveyed to him by his Clerk from his Chambers in the <HI>Temple</HI>; and after he had answer'd them, he would return them thither again, without seeing the Practisers who left them.</P>
<P>This Gentleman lay a long time undistinguish'd in his Profession, under an invincible Modesty; in∣somuch that he thought once of quitting the Bar: but a lucky Occasion happening, whereby he had an Opportunity to shew his great Parts and Learning, he was soon taken Notice of, and retain'd in every Cause of Moment; but however confined himself intirely to the Courts of Law, and chiefly to that of the King's Bench. After the Death of his Wife he was prevailed with to ascend the Bench as a
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>
Judge, in the last Court, which he accepted, proba∣bly to alleviate and divert the Concern he was in for her Death. He was afterwards made Lord Chief Justice of the Common-pleas, in which Office he lived but Two Years. His Death was a publick Loss, and much lamented.</P>
<P>I am now come to <HI>Windsor,</HI> where I must for a while quit the Subject of Trade and Navigation, in order to describe the most beautiful and most plea∣santly situated Castle, and Royal Palace, in the whole Isle of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>William the Conqueror</HI> was the first of our <HI>English</HI> Monarchs, who distinguish'd <HI>Windsor.</HI> That Prince, who delighted much in Hunting, finding it a Situa∣tion highly proper for that Purpose, and, as he said of it, a suitable Place for the Entertainment of Kings, agreed with the Abbot of <HI>Westminster</HI> for an Exchange, and so took Possession of it. He built a Castle here, and had several little Lodges or Hunt∣ing-houses in the Forest adjoining; and frequently lodg'd, for the Conveniency of his Sport, in a House which the Monks before enjoyed near or in the Town of <HI>Windsor</HI>; for the Town is much more ancient than the present Castle, and was an emi∣nent Pass upon the <HI>Thames</HI> in the Reign of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings.</P>
<P>After him King <HI>Edward</HI> III. taking an extreme Liking to that Place, resolved to fix his Summer Residence here; and accordingly laid out himself the Plan of that magnificent Palace, which, as to outward Form and Building, we now see there; for whatever has been done as to beautifying, altering, or amending the Inside and Apartments, nothing has been added to the Building itself, except that noble Terrace, which runs under the North Front, and leads to the Green on the Park, at the East Side or End of it, along which the fine Lodgings, and Royal Apartments, were at first built; all the North-part
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
being then taken up in Rooms of State, and Halls for publick Balls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The House itself was indeed a Palace, and with∣out any Appearance of a Fortification; but when the Building was brought on to the Slope of the Hill on the Town Side, the King added Ditches, Ram∣parts, the Round Tower, and several other Places of Strength; and thence it was called a Castle.</P>
<P>Such a Pride did this great King take in being the Founder of this sumptuous Building, that when it was suggested to him, that <HI>William of Wickham</HI> had assumed the Honour of it to himself, it had like to have cost <HI>William</HI> all his Interest in the King's Favour, which at that time was very great; but the Prelate cleared himself by disavowing the Charge, urging that all he protended to, was to acknowlege, That the Money and the Reputation he had gained by building that Castle for the King, had been the making of him. For it seems he had caused these Words,
<Q>THIS MADE WICKHAM,</Q>
to be cut in Stone in the inner Wall of the little Tower, which from him is, to this Day, call'd <HI>Win∣chester Tower.</HI></P>
<P><HI>William of Wickham,</HI> whom I have before-men∣tioned in my Account of <HI>Winchester,</HI> was, at that time, the Architect of the Court; and so well per∣form'd his Part, that in all the Decorations and Or∣naments which have been made since by succeeding Princes, they have found no Occasion to add to or diminish any thing, except it be to alter some small Matter at the Entrance to the great Stair-case, the Kitchen, and Offices below Stairs, and such-like; but the great North and East Fronts, the Square of the inner Court, the great Gates at the entering from the Town, with the Round Tower, and the
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
Walls annex'd, are all standing in the very Form in which King <HI>Edward</HI> III. left them.</P>
<P>The only Addition in the Inside, is a fine Eque∣strian Statue of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. which stands over the great Well, sunk, as may be supposed, in the first Building, for the Supply of the Castle with Water, and in which was an Engine for raising it, notwithstanding the great Depth, by very little Labour; the Contrivance and Performance of Sir <HI>Samuel Morland,</HI> an excellent Mechanick and Ma∣thematician.</P>
<P>On the Outside, as I have said, was added the Terrace Walk, by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> where she usually walked for an Hour every Day before her Dinner, if not hindered by windy Weather, to which she had a peculiar Aversion; for she loved to walk in a mild, calm Rain, with an Umbrella over her Head.</P>
<P>This is really a magnificent Work; for as it is raised on a steep Declivity of the Hill, it was neces∣sarily cut down a very great Depth, to bring the Foundation to a Flat equal to the Breadth, which was to be formed above. From the Foundation it was raised by solid Stone Work of a vast Thickness, with cross Walls of Stone, for banding the Front, and preventing any Thrust from the Weight of Earth within.</P>
<P>This noble Walk is covered with fine Gravel, and has Cavities, with Drains, to carry off the Water; so that not a Drop of Rain will rest on the Terrace, but it is dry, hard, and fit to walk on immediately after the greatest Showers. The Breadth of this Walk is very spacious on the North Side; on the East Side it is narrower. Neither <HI>Versailles,</HI> nor any of the Royal Palaces in <HI>France, Naples,</HI> or <HI>Rome,</HI> can shew any thing like this. The Grand Seignior's Terrace, in the outer Court of the <HI>Seraglio</HI> next the Sea, is what I think comes the nearest, and yet is
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
not equal to it, if I may believe the Account of those who have seen it.</P>
<P>At the North-east Corner of this Terrace, where it turns South, to run on by the East Side of the Castle, are Steps, by which you go off upon the Plain of the Park, which is kept smooth as a Carpet, and on the Edge of which the Prospect of the Ter∣race is doubled by a Vista, South over the Park, and quite up to the great Park, and towards the Forest. Here also is a small Seat, that will not contain above One, or Two at most, with an high Back and Cover for the Head, which being fixed on a Pin of Iron or Brass, the Persons who sit in it may easily turn it from the Wind, however it may blow; and enjoy a complete Calm. This is said also to be Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth</HI>'s Invention, to avoid being ruffled with the Wind; and it affords no less Shelter from the Sun.</P>
<P>From this lofty Terrace the People within have an Egress to the Park, and to a most beautiful Walk, which neither King <HI>Edward</HI> III. nor his Successors, for some Hundreds of Years, knew any thing of, all their Prospect being from the Windows of the Castle.</P>
<P>On that Side of the Building which looks out upon the Terrace, are all the Royal Apartments; those of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. which were on the East Side, being now allotted to great Officers of State.</P>
<P>You mount into the Royal Apartments by several back Stairs; but the publick Way is up a small Ascent to a Flat or Half-pace, where there are two Entries of State by two large Stair-cases, one on the Left-hand to the Royal Apartments, and the other on the Right, to <HI>St. George's-hall</HI> and the Royal Chapel.</P>
<P>Before the Entrance to these on either Side, you pass thro' the Guard-chambers, where you see the Walls furnished with Arms, and the King's Yeomen of the Guard keep their Station. These Rooms
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
lead as well to the fine Lodgings, as to <HI>St. George's-hall.</HI></P>
<P>In the Royal Lodgings there have been so many Alterations of Furniture, that there can be no enter∣ing upon a particular Description. In the Chimney-piece of one of these Apartments, is a Piece of Needle-work exquisitely fine, performed, as they say, by the Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> during the Time of her Con∣finement in <HI>Fotheringay-castle.</HI> There are several Family Pictures in the Chimney-pieces, and other Parts of those Lodgings, which are very valuable.</P>
<P>These Rooms look all out North towards the Terrace, and over Part of the finest and richest Vale in the World; which along the Course of the River <HI>Thames,</HI> with very little Interruption, reaches to, and includes the City of <HI>London</HI> East, and the City of <HI>Oxford</HI> West; the River, with a beautiful winding Stream gliding gently thro' the Middle of it, and in∣riching by its Navigation both the Land and the People on every Side.</P>
<P>It may be proper to say something of the Beauties and Ornaments of <HI>St. George's-hall,</HI> tho' nothing can be said equal to what the Eye may be Witness to. 'Tis surprising, at the first Entrance, to see at the Upper-end the Picture of King <HI>William</HI> on Horse∣back; under him an Ascent with Marble Steps, a Balustrade, and a half Pace, which formerly was actually there, with room for a Throne, or Chair of State, for the Sovereign to sit on, when on publick Days he thought fit to appear in Ceremony.</P>
<P>At the West End of the Hall is the Chapel Royal, the neatest and finest of the Kind in <HI>England:</HI> the carved Work is beyond any that can be seen in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>After we had spent some Hours in viewing all that was curious on this Side, we came down to the Dungeon, or <HI>Round Tower,</HI> which goes up a long, but easy Ascent of Steps, and is very high. Here we
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
were obliged to deliver up our Swords, but no-where else: tho' here is nothing curious. The Governor or Constable's Lodgings are neatly furnished, but nowise extraordinary.</P>
<P>From this Tower you see <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s Cathedral at <HI>London</HI> very plainly.</P>
<P>Coming down from hence we entered into the other Court, where is the great Chapel of the Garter, and the House or College for the poor Knights, as they are called.</P>
<P>I might go back here to the History of the Order of the Garter, the Institution of which by King <HI>Edward</HI> III. had its Original here: but this is done so fully in other Authors, that I shall only mention, That this Order was not founded on the Countess of <HI>Salisbury</HI>'s Garter, as <HI>Polydere Virgil,</HI> the most con∣ceited and most erroneous Author that ever wrote of the <HI>English</HI> Affairs, ridiculously asserts; but on that martial King's own Garter, which he gave as the Signal at the glorious Battle of <HI>Cressi,</HI> as <HI>St. George</HI> was given for the Word of the Day. To comme∣morate which, in Honour of his brave and war∣like Son, and of those Nobles and Gentlemen who shared with him in the Glory of that ever memorable Day, he instituted this Order. And here I can't forbear observing, (tho' intirely out of my way) how fond we have ever been in following Foreigners in most Things, even from the Coxcomb in Dress, up to the Historian; as is evident not only from this idle Story of the above-mentioned Author prevailing among u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in particular, and of his History in general, but likewise of the Performance of a late Foreign Author, of the Affairs and Transactions of this Country; whereby the Translator, and Under∣take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, to usher it out in <HI>English,</HI> got at least 10,000<HI>l.</HI> when it had nothing more, but rather much less▪ to recommend it, than any of our own <HI>English</HI> Histories.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>These, tho' not all Noblemen, were however Men of great Characters and Stations, either in the Army, or in the Civil Administration, and such as the Sovereign did not think it below him to make his Companions.</P>
<P>The lower Court of the Castle, although not so distinguished by Lodgings and Rooms of State, is nevertheless particularly glorious for the fine Chapel of the Order, a most beautiful and magnificent Work, and which shews the Greatness not only of the Court in those Days, but the Spirit and Genius of the magnanimous Founder. The Chapel is not only fine within, but the Workmanship without is extra∣ordinary; nothing so antient is to be seen so beauti∣ful. <HI>King's-College</HI> Chapel at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> built by <HI>Henry</HI> VI. and <HI>Henry</HI> VII.'s Chapel in <HI>Westminster-Abbey,</HI> are fine Buildings; but they are modern, compared to this, which was begun, as by the inscribed Dates upon the Walls appears, in the Year 1337.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="81"/>The Coats of Arms, and the various Imagery and other Ornaments both inside and outside, not only of the King, but of several of the first Knights Companions, are wonderfully finished, and the Work has stood out against the Injury of Time to Admiration.</P>
<P>'Tis observable, that King <HI>Edward</HI> owns this Chapel was begun by his Ancestors, and some think it was by King <HI>Edward</HI> I. and that he himself was baptized in it, and there was a Castle built by <HI>William the Conqueror</HI> also: As to the Chapel, which was then called a Church, or a Convent, King <HI>Edward</HI> III. did not pull down the old Building in∣tirely; but he added all the Choir to the first Model, and several other proper Parts for the Purposes in∣tended, as Houses and handsome Apartments for the Canons, Dignitaries, and other Persons belonging to the Church, which are generally situated on the North Side of the Square, out of Sight, or rather skreened from the common View by the Church itself; which Dwellings are notwithstanding very good, and well accommodated for the Persons who are Possessors of them; then the King finished it in the Manner we now see it: As for the old Castle, the Building of <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> the King pulled it down to the Foundation, forming a new Building according to the present Plan, and which stood, as above, to the Time of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. without any Alteration.</P>
<P>The Establishment for this Chapel was very con∣siderable, by the Donation of divers Subjects, before it was set apart to be the Chapel of the Order: the Duke of <HI>Suffolk</HI> in particular, as appears in <HI>Dug∣dale</HI>'s <HI>Monasticon,</HI> gave near 3000 Acres of Land, 19 Manors, 170 Messuages and Tofts, and several Ad∣vowsons of Churches, to it; which, with other Gifts afterwards, made the Revenue above 1000<HI>l.</HI> a Year in those Days, which was a prodigious Sum, as Money went at that Time.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="82"/>In the Choir are the Stalls for the Knights of the Order, with a Throne for the Sovereign; also Stalls in the Middle of it for the poor Knights-Pensioners, who live in their House or Hospital on the South Side of the Square or Court in which the Church stands.</P>
<P>Here are to be seen the Banners of the Knights who now enjoy the Honour of the Garter: When they die, those Banners are taken down, and the Coat of Arms of the deceased Knight set up in the Place allotted for those Arms over the same Stall: so those Coats of Arms are a living History, or rather a Record of all the Knights, that ever have been since the first Institution of the Order, and how they succeeded one another; by which it appears, that Kings, Emperors, and Sovereign Princes, have not thought it below them to accept of the Honour of being Knights Companions of the Order, while at the same time it must be noted, to the Honour of the <HI>English</HI> Crown, that our Kings have never thought fit to accept of any of their Orders abroad, of what Kind soever; whereas there is an Account in the Registry of the Order, that there are reckoned up of this most Noble Company,

</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="83"/>Besides these Foreign Princes, there is a little <HI>Galaxy</HI> of <HI>English</HI> Nobility, the Flower of so many Courts, and so many Ages, to whose Families the Ensigns of the Order have been an Honour, and who are not the least Glory this Order has to boast of. But as to the List of the present Knights, that being subject to Fluctuation, comes not within my Design in this Letter.</P>
<P>Several Kings and Persons of high Rank have been buried also in this Chapel, as <HI>Edward</HI> IV. and <HI>Charles</HI> I. Here also is the Family Burying-place of the Dukes of <HI>Beauford,</HI> who are a natural Branch of the Royal Family of <HI>Lancaster.</HI></P>
<P>All the Ceremonies observed here in the Instal∣ment of the Knights, are so perfectly set down in Mr. <HI>Ashmole</HI>'s History of the <HI>Order of the Garter,</HI> that nothing can be said but what must be a Copy from him.</P>
<P>As the upper Court and Building are fronted with the fine Terrace, so the lower Court, where this beautiful Chapel stands, is incompassed with a very high Wall, which goes round the West-end of the Court to the Gate; and looking South, leads into the Town, as the Gate of the upper Court looks likewise South-east into the little Park.</P>
<P>The Parks about <HI>Windsor</HI> are very agreeable and spacious: the little Park, as it is called, is above 3 Miles round, the great one 14, and the Forest above 30. The first is particular to the Court; the others are open for Riding, Hunting, and taking the Air, for any Gentlemen that please.</P>
<P>The Lodges in those Parks may be called Palaces, were they not eclipsed by the Palace itself. They have been beautified by the noble Persons to whom the Post of Rangers has been generally assigned, who, having been inriched by other Advancements, Honours, and profitable Imployments, thought no∣thing too much to lay out to adorn their Apartments,
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
in a Place wherein it was so much to their Honour, as well as Convenience to reside: such is the Lodge belonging once to Admiral <HI>Churchill,</HI> the Duchess of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>We left <HI>Windsor,</HI> and struck again into the <HI>Lon∣don</HI> Road at <HI>Colebrook,</HI> and passed over the Heath, and thro' the Town of <HI>Hounslow, Brentford, Hamer∣smith,</HI> and <HI>Kensington</HI> into <HI>London.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. CONTAINING A Description of the City of <HI>LONDON,</HI> as taking in the City of <HI>Westminster,</HI> Borough of <HI>Southwark,</HI> and the Build∣ings circumjacent.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Am now to describe the City of LONDON, and Parts adjacent: a Work infinitely difficult to be perform'd in the narrow Compass of a Letter, since we see it so fully takes up Two large Volumes in <HI>Folio,</HI> which yet, if I may venture to give an Opinion of it, is very imperfectly executed, and has imploy'd since another very large one in <HI>Folio,</HI> written by Mr. <HI>W. Maitland,</HI> F. R. S. which has much more Merit than the Two Volumes, and contains many Things needful to be known by the Curious, which are in∣compatible with the Brevity to which our narrow Limits confine us.</P>
<P>LONDON, as a City only, and as its Walls and Liberties line it out, might indeed be viewed in a smaller Compass, than what we propose to consider it in; for when I speak of <HI>London,</HI> in the modern
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
Acceptation, I take in all that vast Mass of Buildings reaching from <HI>Blackwall</HI> in the East, to <HI>Tothill-fields</HI> in the West; and extended in an unequal Breadth from the Bridge or River in the South, to <HI>Islington</HI> North; and from <HI>Peterborough-house</HI> on the <HI>Bank∣side</HI> in <HI>Westminster,</HI> to <HI>Cavendish-square</HI>; and all the new Buildings by and beyond <HI>Grosvenor</HI> and <HI>Hanover Squares</HI> to the <HI>Brentford</HI> Road one way, to the <HI>Acton</HI> Road another; a Prodigy of Buildings, that nothing in the World does, or ever did, surpass, except old <HI>Rome</HI> in <HI>Trajan</HI>'s Time, when the Walls of that City were 50 Miles in Compass, and the Number of Inhabitants 6,800,000 Souls.</P>
<P><HI>London,</HI> as to its Figure, must be owned to be very irregular, as it is stretch'd out in Buildings just at the Pleasure of every Undertaker of them, and as the Convenience of the People directs, whether for Trade, or otherwise. This has given it a very confused Face, and made it uncompact and unequal, being properly neither long or broad, round or square; whereas the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> was, in a man∣ner, round, with very few Irregularities in its Shape.</P>
<P>One sees <HI>London,</HI> including the Buildings on both Sides the Water, in some Places Three Miles broad, as from <HI>St. George</HI>'s in <HI>Southwark,</HI> to <HI>Shoreditch</HI> in <HI>Middlesex</HI>; or Two Miles, as from <HI>Peterborough-house</HI> to <HI>Montague-house</HI>; and in some Places not half a Mile, as in <HI>Wapping</HI>; and less in <HI>Rotherhith.</HI></P>
<P>We see several Villages, formerly standing, as it were, in the Country, and at a great Distance, now joined to the Streets by continued Buildings, and more making haste to meet in the like manner; for Example,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Deptford:</HI> This Town was formerly reckoned at least Two Miles from <HI>Rotherhith,</HI> and that over the Marshes too, a Place unlikely ever to be inha∣bited; and yet now, by the Increase of Buildings in that Town itself, and the many Streets erected at
<PB N="86" REF="87"/>
<HI>Rotherhith,</HI> and by the Docks and Building-yards on the River-side, which stand between both, the Town of <HI>Deptford,</HI> and the Streets of <HI>Rotherhith,</HI> are in a manner joined, and the Buildings daily increasing; so that <HI>Deptford</HI> may be reckoned a Part of the great Mass, and infinitely full of People also; and were the Town of <HI>Deptford</HI> now separated, and rated by itself, I believe it contains more People, and stands upon more Ground than the City of <HI>Wells.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Town of <HI>Islington,</HI> on the North-side of the City, is in like manner joined to the Streets of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> excepting one small Field, and which is in itself so small, that there is no Doubt but in a very few Years they will be intirely joined. And the same may be said,</P>
<P N="3">3. Of <HI>Mile-end,</HI> on the East End of the Town.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Newington-butts,</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> reaches out her Hand North, and is so joining to <HI>Southwark,</HI> that it cannot now be properly called a Town by itself, but a kind of Suburb to the Borough; and if, as once was talk'd of, <HI>St. George's-fields</HI> should be built into Squares and Streets, <HI>Newington, Lambeth,</HI> and the <HI>Borough,</HI> would make but one <HI>Southwark.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>Westminster</HI> is in a fair way to shake Hands with <HI>Chelsea,</HI> as <HI>St. Gyles</HI>'s is with <HI>Marybone</HI>; and <HI>Great Russel-street</HI> by <HI>Montague-house,</HI> with <HI>Totten∣ham-court,</HI> is very evident; and yet all these put together, may still be called <HI>London:</HI> Whither will this City then extend, and where must a Circum∣vallation Line of it be placed?</P>
<P>I have, as near as I could, caused a Measure to be taken of this mighty Body; and for the Satis∣faction of your Curiosity, I have here given as accurate a Description of it, as I can do in so narrow a Com∣pass, or without drawing a Plan of the Places.</P>
<P>As I am forced, in many Places, to take in some unbuilt Ground, so I have, on the other hand, been obliged to leave a great many whole Streets of Build∣ings
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>
out of my Line: so that I have really not stretched my Calculations, to make it seem bigger than it is; nor is there any Occasion for it.</P>

<HEAD>For the <HI>Southwark</HI> Side of the Buildings, the Line is as follows:</HEAD>
<P>HAving ended the Circumference of the <HI>Middle∣sex</HI> Building at <HI>Lime-house,</HI> and the Street ex∣tending towards <HI>Poplar,</HI> the Hamlets of <HI>Poplar</HI> and <HI>Blackwall,</HI> tho' very near contiguous in Buildings, being excluded, I allow an Interval of two Miles, from <HI>Poplar,</HI> cross the <HI>Isle of Dogs,</HI> and over the <HI>Thames,</HI> to the Lower Water-gate at <HI>Deptford</HI>; and tho' in measuring the Circumference of all Cities, the River, where any such runs thro' Part of the Buildings, is always measured; yet, that I may not be said to stretch the Extent of the Buildings which I include in this Account, I omit the River from <HI>Limehouse</HI> to <HI>Deptford,</HI> (where, if included, it ought to begin) and begin my Line as above.</P>
<P N="1">1. From the said Water-gate at <HI>Deptford,</HI> the Line goes East to the Corner next the <HI>Thames,</HI> where the Shipwright's Yard now is, and where I find a continued Range of Buildings begins by the Side of a little Creek or River, which runs into the <HI>Thames</HI> there, and reaches quite up the said River, to the Bridge in the great <HI>Kentish</HI> Road, and over the Street there, taking in the South Side of the Street to the West Corner of the Buildings in that Street, and then measuring down on the West Side of the long Street, which runs to the <HI>Thames</HI> Side, till you come to the new Street which passes from <HI>Deptford</HI> to <HI>Rotherhith</HI>; then turning to the Left, passing on the Back-side of the <HI>King's Yard</HI> to Mr. <HI>Evelin</HI>'s House, including the new Church of <HI>Deptford,</HI> and all the new Streets or Buildings made on the Fields Side, which are very many, this amounts in the Whole, to 3 <HI>Miles,</HI> 1 <HI>Furlong,</HI> 16 <HI>Rods.</HI></P>

<P>Were it possible to reduce all these Buildings to a compact Situation, 'tis generally thought, that the whole Body so put together, allowing the necessary Ground, which they now imploy for the several Trades in the Out-parts, such as the Building-yards by the River for Shipwrights, Tanners Yards, Dyers, Whitsters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> would take up 28 Miles in Circum∣ference, very compactly built.</P>
<P>The Guesses that are made at the Number of Inhabitants, have been variously formed; Mr. <HI>Mait∣land</HI> above-mentioned (<HI>Anno</HI> 1739) computes, that within the Walls, and the Bars, as I may say, it contains 725, 903; but Sir <HI>William Petty,</HI> famous for his Political Arithmetick, supposed the City, at his last Calculation, to contain a Million of People, and this he judges from the Number of Births and Burials; but he must take in a greater Compass than Mr. <HI>Maitland,</HI> to make up this Number; and according to this Rule, as well by what is well known of the
<PB N="94" REF="95"/>
Increase of the said Births and Burials, as of the prodigious Increase of Buildings, it may be very reasonable to conclude the present Number of In∣habitants <HI>within the Circumference I have mentioned in my Line,</HI> to amount to about 1,500,000 Souls.</P>
<P>The Government of this great Mass of Building, and of such a vast collected Body of People, tho' it consists of various Parts, is perhaps the best regulated that any City can pretend to; and of late Years it boasts of several new Regulations, as to Beggars, Lights, Pavements, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which turn out greatly to its Advantage.</P>
<P>The Government of the City of <HI>London</HI> in par∣ticular, and abstractedly considered, is by the Lord-Mayor, Twenty-four Aldermen, Two Sheriffs, the Recorder, and Common Council; but the Juris∣diction of these is confined to that Part only which they call the City and its Liberties, which are mark'd out, except the <HI>Borough,</HI> by the Walls and the Bars, as they are called.</P>
<P>Besides this, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of <HI>London</HI> have a Right Presidial in <HI>Southwark,</HI> and hold frequent Courts at <HI>St. Mary-hill</HI> in the <HI>Borough:</HI> they are also Conservators of the Bridge, and the Bridge itself is their particular Jurisdiction.</P>
<P>Also the Lord Mayor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is Conservator of the River <HI>Thames,</HI> from <HI>Stanes</HI> Bridge in <HI>Surrey</HI> and <HI>Middlesex,</HI> to the River <HI>Medway</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and, as some insist, up the <HI>Medway</HI> to <HI>Rochester</HI> Bridge.</P>
<P>The Government of the Out-parts is by Justices of the Peace, and by the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> who are likewise Sheriffs of <HI>Middlesex</HI>; and the Govern∣ment of <HI>Westminster</HI> is by a High-bailiff, constituted by the Dean and Chapter, to whom the Civil Ad∣ministration is committed, and who presides in Elections of Parliament for the City of <HI>Westminster,</HI> and returns the Candidates who are chosen.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="96"/>The remaining Part of <HI>Southwark</HI> Side, where the City Jurisdiction does not obtain, is governed also by a Bench of Justices, and their proper substituted Peace-officers; excepting out of this the Privileges of the <HI>Marshalseas,</HI> or of the <HI>Marshal's Court,</HI> the Privilege of the <HI>Marshal</HI> of the <HI>King's-bench,</HI> and the like.</P>

<P>To begin then with the first; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="account">
<HEAD>I. <HI>I.</HI> A brief Account of what the City was before the Fire, and how improved when rebuilt, and within a few Years after it.</HEAD>
<P>TAKE the City, and its adjacent Buildings, to stand as described by Mr. <HI>Stow,</HI> or by any other Au∣thor, who wrote before the Fire of <HI>London</HI>; and the Difference between what it was then, and what it is now, may be observed thus:</P>
<P>Before the Fire of <HI>London, Anno</HI> 1666, the Build∣ings look'd as if they had been formed to make one general Bonfire, whenever any wicked Incendiaries should think fit to attempt it; for the Streets were not only narrow, and the Houses all built with Tim∣ber, Lath, and Plaster; but the Manner of the Building in those Days, one Story projecting out beyond another, was such, that in some narrow Streets the Houses almost touch'd one another at the Top; insomuch that it often happened, that if a House was on Fire, the opposite House was in more Danger, according as the Wind stood, than the Houses adjoin∣ing on either Side.</P>
<P>And tho' by the new Buildings after the Fire much Ground was given up to inlarge the Streets, yet it is to be observed, that the old Houses stood generally upon more Ground, were much larger upon the Flat,
<PB N="97" REF="98"/>
and in many Places Gardens and large Yards about them, so that there are many more Houses built than stood before on the same Ground. For Example:</P>
<P><HI>Swithen</HI>'s <HI>Alleys</HI> by the <HI>Royal Exchange</HI> were all, before the Fire, taken up with one single Merchant's House, Mr. <HI>Swithen</HI> by Name; whereas, upon the same Ground where the House stood, stand now about 22 or 24 Houses, which belong to his Posterity.</P>
<P><HI>Copt-hall Court</HI> in <HI>Throgmorton-street</HI> was also, before the Fire, a single House, inhabited by a <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant: likewise Three more Courts in the same Streets were single Houses, Two on the same Side of the Way, and one on the other.</P>
<P>The several Alleys behind <HI>St. Christopher</HI>'s Church, now vulgarly called <HI>St. Christopher's Church-yard,</HI> were likewise, before the Fire, one great House, with Ware-houses, in which Mr. <HI>Kendrick</HI> lived; whom I have mentioned in my Account of <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Newbury,</HI> and took up almost all the Ground, on which now a Street of Houses is erected, called <HI>Prince's-street,</HI> going thro' into <HI>Loth∣bury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>King's-Arms Yard</HI> in <HI>Coleman-street,</HI> now built into fine large Houses, and inhabited by eminent Merchants, was, before the Fire, a Stable-yard for Horses, and an Inn, which gave the Sign of the <HI>King's Arms.</HI></P>
<P>I might give many more Instances; but these will account for what some assert; <HI>viz.</HI> That so many great Houses were converted into Streets, Courts, Alleys and Buildings, that near 4000 Houses stand on the Ground which the Fire left desolate, more than stood on the same Ground before.</P>
<P>Another Increase of Buildings in the City, is to be taken from the Inhabitants in the unburnt Parts following the same Example, of pulling down great old Buildings, which took up large Tracks of Ground in some of the well inhabited Places, and building
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>
on the same Ground not only several Houses, but even whole Streets of Houses, which are since fully inhabited: For Example,</P>
<P><HI>Crosby-square,</HI> within <HI>Bishopsgate,</HI> formerly the House of Sir <HI>James Langham,</HI> Merchant.</P>
<P><HI>Devonshire-Square</HI> and <HI>Street,</HI> with several back Streets, and Passages into <HI>Petticoat-lane</HI> one Way, and <HI>Houndsditch</HI> another, all built on the Ground where the old Earl of <HI>Devonshire</HI> had an House and Garden.</P>
<P><HI>Bridgwater-square,</HI> and several Streets adjoining, built on the Ground where the Earl of <HI>Bridgwater</HI> had a large House and Garden in <HI>Barbican.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Billeter-square,</HI> and several Passages adjoining, built upon the Grounds of one great House, in which one Merchant only lived.</P>
<P>All those Palaces of the Nobility, formerly make∣ing a most beautiful Range of Buildings fronting the <HI>Strand,</HI> with their Gardens reaching to the <HI>Thames,</HI> where they had their particular Water-gates and Stairs, have had the same Fate, such as <HI>Essex, Arun∣del, Norfolk, Salisbury, Worcester, Exeter, Hunger∣ford,</HI> and <HI>York</HI> Houses; the Lord <HI>Brook</HI>'s House in <HI>Holbourn,</HI> in the Place of which are now so many noble Streets and Houses erected, as are in themselves equal to a large City; all which extend from the <HI>Temple</HI> to <HI>Northumberland-house, Somerset-house</HI> and the <HI>Savoy</HI> only intervening; and the latter of these may be said to be, not an House, but a little Town, being sepa∣rated into innumerable Tenements and Apartments.</P>
<P>These are prodigious Inlargements to the City, even upon that which I call inhabited Ground, and where infinite Numbers of People now live, more than lived upon the same Spot of Ground before.</P>
<P>Suoh was the State of <HI>London</HI> before the Fire in 1666, and so prodigious were the Improvements made in it, within the Course of a few Years after that Disaster. But what are these, compared to what has been done since within our own Memory? And this brings me to my second Article,</P>

All those numberless Ranges of Building, called <HI>Spital-fields,</HI> reaching from <HI>Spital-yard</HI> at <HI>Northern Fallgate,</HI> and from <HI>Artillery-lane</HI> in <HI>Bishopsgate-street,</HI> with all the new Streets, beginning at <HI>Hoxton</HI> and the Back of <HI>Shoreditch</HI> Church North, and reaching to <HI>Brick-lane,</HI> and to the End of <HI>Hare-street,</HI> on the Way to <HI>Bethnal-green</HI> East; then sloping away quite to <HI>Whitechapel</HI> Road South-east, containing, as some People say, above 320 Acres of Ground, which are now close built, and inhabited with an infinite Number of People.</P>
<P>The Lanes were deep, dirty and unfrequented; that Part now called <HI>Spitalfields-market</HI> was a Field of Grass, with Cows feeding on it, since the Year 1670. The <HI>Old Artillery-ground</HI> (where the Parliament listed their first Soldiers against the King) took up all those long Streets leading out of <HI>Artillery-lane</HI> to <HI>Spital-yard Back gate,</HI> and so on to the End of <HI>Wheeler-street. Brick-lane,</HI> which is now a long well-paved Street, was a deep dirty Road, frequented chiefly by Carts fetching Bricks that way into <HI>Whitechapel</HI> from Brick-kilns in those Fields, whence it had its Name.</P>
<P N="2">2. On the more Eastern Part the same Increase goes on in Proportion; namely, all <HI>Goodman's-fields,</HI> and the many Streets between <HI>Whitechapel</HI> and <HI>Rose∣mary-lane,</HI> all built since the Year 1678. <HI>Well-close,</HI> now called <HI>Marine square,</HI> all the hither or West End of <HI>Ratcliff-highway,</HI> from the Corner of <HI>Gravel-lane</HI> to the East End of <HI>East Smithfield,</HI> was a Road over the Fields; likewise those Buildings now called
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>
<HI>Virginia-street,</HI> and all the Streets on the Side of <HI>Ratcliff-highway</HI> to <HI>Gravel-lane</HI> above-named, which of late Years extends so far, that the End of <HI>Lime-house</HI> stands a Chance to be soon joined to the Be∣ginning of <HI>Poplar.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. To come to the North Side of the Town, and beginning at <HI>Shoreditch</HI> West, and <HI>Hoxton square,</HI> and <HI>Charles-square</HI> adjoining, those were all open Fields, from <HI>Agnes St. Clare,</HI> to <HI>Hoxton</HI> Town, till the Year 1689, or thereabout. <HI>Pitfield-street</HI> was a Bank, parting two Pasture-grounds, and <HI>Ask</HI>'s Hospital was another open Field. Farther West the like Addition of Buildings begins at the Foot-way by the <HI>Pest-house,</HI> and includes the <HI>French</HI> Hospital, <HI>Old-street</HI> Two Squares, and several Streets, extend∣ing from <HI>Brick-lane</HI> to <HI>Mount-mill</HI> and the Road to <HI>Islington,</HI> and from that Road, still West, to <HI>Wood's-close,</HI> and to <HI>St. John's</HI> and <HI>Clerkenwell,</HI> all which Streets and Squares are built since the Years 1688 and 1689, and were before that, and some for a long Time after, open Fields or Gardens, and never built on till after that Time; and moreover, within these few Years, all those open Grounds, called <HI>Bunhill-fields,</HI> adjoining to the <HI>Dissenters</HI> Burying-ground, are now built upon, and are complete Streets of Houses to the very Road, and generally well inhabited.</P>
<P>From hence we go on still West, and beginning at <HI>Gray's-Inn,</HI> and going on to those formerly called <HI>Red-lion</HI> Fields, and <HI>Lamb's-conduit</HI> Fields, we see there prodigious Piles of Buildings; they begin at <HI>Gray's-Inn-Wall</HI> towards <HI>Red-lion-street,</HI> from whence, in a strait Line, they go quite to <HI>Lamb's-conduit</HI> Fields North, including a great Range of Buildings reaching to <HI>Bedford-row</HI> and the <HI>Cockpit</HI> East, and including <HI>Red-lion-square, Ormond-street, Great</HI> and <HI>Little Marlborough-streets, Queen's-square,</HI> and all the Streets between the Square and <HI>King's-gate</HI> in <HI>Holbourn.</HI> These Piles are very great, and the
<PB N="101" REF="102"/>
Houses so magnificent and large, that abundance of Persons of Quality are found among them.</P>
<P>Farther West in the same Line is <HI>Southampton</HI> great Square, called <HI>Bloomsbury,</HI> with <HI>Kingstreet</HI> on the East Side of it, and all the numberless Streets West of the Square to the Market-place, and thro' Great <HI>Russel-street</HI> by <HI>Montagu-house</HI> quite into the <HI>Hampstead</HI> Road; all which Buildings, except <HI>Southampton-house,</HI> and some of the Square, have been formed from the open Fields since the Time above-mentioned, and contain several Thousands of Houses.</P>
<P>The Increase of the Buildings in <HI>St. Gyles's</HI> and <HI>St. Martin's in the Fields,</HI> is really a kind of Prodigy; comprising all the Buildings North of <HI>Long-acre,</HI> up to the <HI>Seven Dials</HI>; all the Streets from <HI>Leicester∣fields</HI> and <HI>St. Martin's-lane,</HI> both North and West, to the <HI>Hay-market</HI> and <HI>Scho,</HI> and from the <HI>Hay-market</HI> to <HI>St. James's-street</HI> inclusive, and to the Park-wall; then all the Buildings on the North Side of the Street, called <HI>Picadilly,</HI> and the Road to <HI>Knights-bridge,</HI> and between that and the South Side of <HI>Tyburn</HI> Road, including <HI>Soho-square, Golden-square, Hanover-square</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Two <HI>Bond-streets, George's-street,</HI> and that new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> out to <HI>Tyburn</HI> Road, called <HI>Gros∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>square,</HI> and <HI>Cavendish-square,</HI> and all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them. Some Part of which will be briefly mentioned under the Head of <HI>Squares.</HI></P>
<P>This last Addition is by Calculation more in Bulk than the Cities of <HI>Bristol, Exeter</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> if they were all put together; all which Places were, a few Years ago, mere Fields of Grass, and imployed only to feed Cattle.</P>
<P>In <HI>Spring-gardens,</HI> near <HI>Charing-cross,</HI> are lately erected several very handsome new Buildings, and a neat Chapel.</P>
<P>The new Buildings in the End of <HI>Broad-street,</HI> near <HI>Bishopsgate,</HI> formerly called <HI>Petty-France,</HI> de∣serve
<PB N="102" REF="103"/>
to be mentioned here. It is in every one's Memory, what a poor and decay'd Place <HI>Petty-France</HI> was; but now the Spot where it stood, is called <HI>New Broad-street,</HI> and consists of regular and stately Houses, built after the Manner of those by <HI>Hanover-square,</HI> and are the most elegant Buildings in the City. They are increased quite into <HI>Old Bethlehem,</HI> which consisted of mean and ruinous Houses, and there may be said to be a new and stately Town of Buildings erected here.</P>
<P>And it would be endless to enumerate the other new Buildings, that have taken Place in and about this great City, of old and ruinous Houses and Streets. <HI>See the Articles of</HI> Churches, Squares, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>III. Of the Publick Offices, and City Corporations.</HEAD>
<P>THE EXCISE-OFFICE is kept in the <HI>Old Jewry,</HI> in a very large House, formerly the Dwelling of Sir <HI>John Frederick,</HI> and afterwards of Sir <HI>John Hern,</HI> very considerable Merchants. In this one Office is managed an immense Weight of Business, and they have in Pay several Thousands of Officers. The whole Kingdom is divided by them into pro∣per Districts, and to every District a Collector, a Supervisor, and a certain Number of Gaugers, called, by the Vulgar, <HI>Excise-men.</HI></P>
<P>Under the Management of this Office are now brought not only the Excise upon Beer, Ale, and other Liquors, as formerly, but also the Duties on Malt and Candles, Hops, Soap, and Leather, Coffee, Tea, and Chocolate; all which we managed in seve∣ral Classes.</P>
<P>The Act lately passed against retailing spirituous Liquors in less Quantities than Two Gallons, which had become so pernicious a Trade, that the lower Class of People was almost wholly debauched and
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
enervated by it, has very much increased the Con∣sequence, as well as the Business, of this Office; for the Commissioners for what relates to this Matter, are a kind of absolute Judges in the Cases brought before them.</P>
<P>The POST-OFFICE is kept in <HI>Lombard-street</HI> in a large House, formerly Sir <HI>Robert Viner</HI>'s, and is under an admirable Management. The <HI>Peny-post</HI> is a Branch of it, and a most useful Addition to Trade and Business; for by it Letters are delivered at the remotest Corners of the Town, almost as soon as they could be fent by a Messenger, and that from Four, Five, Six, to Eight times a Day, according as the Distance of the Place makes it practicable; insomuch that you may send a Letter from <HI>Limehouse</HI> in the East, to the farthest Part of <HI>Westminster,</HI> for a Peny, several times in the same Day; and to the neighbouring Villages, as <HI>Kensington, Hamersmith, Chiswick,</HI> &amp;c. Westward; <HI>Newington, Islington, Kentish-town, Hampstead, Holloway, High∣gate,</HI> &amp;c. Northward; to <HI>Newington-butts, Camber∣well,</HI> &amp;c. Southward; and <HI>Stepney, Poplar, Bow, Strat∣ford, Deptford, Greenwich,</HI> &amp;c. Eastward, once a Day.</P>
<P>Nor are you tied up to a single Piece of Paper, as in the <HI>General Post-office</HI>; but any Packet under a Pound-weight goes at the same Price.</P>
<P>The CUSTOM-HOUSE comes next to be men∣tioned. The <HI>Long Room</HI> is like an <HI>Exchange</HI> every Morning, and the Croud of People who appear there, and the Business they do, is not to be explained by Words. The whole Building is very convenient, but not like what it might or ought to have been; and moreover, the Quays thereabouts are so throng'd and crouded, that they are much too little for the Business continually carrying on there.</P>
<P>Between the Horse-guards at <HI>Whitehall</HI> and <HI>Cha∣ring-cross,</HI> at an huge Expence, but with very little Taste, is seen the new-erected ADMIRALTY-OFFICE. This Office is, perhaps, of the most Importance of
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
any of the publick Parts of the Administration; the Royal Navy being the Sinews of our Strength.</P>
<P>The NAVY-OFFICE, a neat and convenient Building in <HI>Cruched-fryars,</HI> and the VICTUALLING-OFFICE on <HI>Tower-hill,</HI> near <HI>East Smithfield,</HI> both which, had we room, deserve a particular Description, are but Branches of this Administration, and receive their Orders from hence; as do likewise the Docks and Yards theirs from the <HI>Navy-office:</HI> the Whole being carried on with the most exquisite Order and Dispatch. The <HI>Admiralty</HI> has been in Commission ever since the Death of Prince <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Denmark.</HI> The Commissioners so often change by Deaths or Removals, that it will be of very little Use to insert them in a Work like this.</P>
<P>Tho' his MAJESTY resides all the Winter at <HI>St. James</HI>'s, yet the Business of the Government is chiefly carried on at the <HI>Cockpit, Whitehall.</HI> Near which is lately finished a magnificent Building, with a very grand Front looking to the Parade in <HI>St. James</HI>'s-<HI>park,</HI> for the TREASURY-OFFICE; and, it being a lofty Structure, over that is the OFFICE of the SECRETARIES OF STATE.</P>
<P>The OFFICE for the BOARD OF TRADE is held just by the Upper-end of the <HI>Privy-garden,</HI> adjoining to an old Gate at the Entrance of <HI>King-street,</HI> which is now demolish'd. It is a large House, and convenient for the Purpose.</P>
<P>At the Horse-guards is a Building commodious enough, built as a Barrack for a large Detachment of the Horse-guards, who keep Post here; over it are Offices belonging to the Judge-advocate for holding Councils of War for Trial of Deserters and others, according to the Articles of War.</P>
<P>A new Office and House is very lately erected, adjoining to the Horse-guards, for the Paymaster-general of the Army.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="106"/>The BANK used to be kept in <HI>Grocers-hall</HI>; but is within these few Years removed to an intire new Edifice, built for that thriving Corporation in <HI>Thread∣needle-street,</HI> adjoining to <HI>St. Christopher</HI>'s Church. It is a noble Structure; but I have not room for a particular Description of it.</P>
<P>The EAST INDIA HOUSE, situated where for∣merly was that of Sir <HI>William Craven,</HI> was rebuilt in the Year 1726. It is very convenient within; but without makes not the Appearance that is worthy of the Company's Trade and Figure in the World, its Front being not extended enough. In the back Part towards <HI>Lime-street,</HI> they have also Warehouses, which were rebuilt in a very handsome manner, <HI>Anno</HI> 1725.</P>
<P>The AFRICAN COMPANY'S HOUSE is in the same Street; a convenient House, which serves for all the Offices their Business requires.</P>
<P>The SOUTH-SEA HOUSE is situate in a large Spot of Ground between <HI>Broad-street</HI> and <HI>Threadneedle-street.</HI> At first two large Houses were taken in to form the whole Office; but, as they were streighten'd for Room, and were obliged to summon their General Courts at <HI>Merchant Taylors-hall,</HI> hard by; so they have lately erected a new Building for the whole Business, which my Limits will not permit me par∣ticularly to describe.</P>
<P>The YORK-BUILDINGS COMPANY has been struggling for some Years past with the great Diffi∣culties into which it has been plunged by the Fatality attending some late Transactions, and I shall say no more of it here.</P>
<P>Here are also several great Offices for Societies of INSURERS, where almost all Hazards may be insured. The Four principal are called, 1. <HI>The Royal Exchange Insurance,</HI> kept in a Part of the <HI>Royal Exchange.</HI> 2. <HI>The Royal Insurance,</HI> kept in <HI>Cornhill.</HI> 3. <HI>The</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="107"/><HI>Hand-in-hand Fire-office,</HI> kept on <HI>Snow-hill.</HI> 4. <HI>The Sun Fire-office,</HI> in <HI>Threadneedle-street.</HI></P>
<P>In the Two first, all Hazards by Sea of Ships and Goods, not Lives, are insured; as also Houses and Goods are insured from Fire.</P>
<P>In the last Two, only Houses and Goods.</P>
<P>In all which Offices the <HI>Premio</HI> is so small, and the Recovery, in case of Loss, so easy and certain, that nothing can be shewn like it in the World.</P>
<P>There are also Offices of INSURANCE ON LIVES, the <HI>Union Fire-office</HI> in <HI>Gutter-lane,</HI> the <HI>Westminster Fire-office,</HI> and others, which manage a great deal of Business in the same way.</P>
<P>The CHARITABLE CORPORATION OFFICE is in <HI>Spring-garden.</HI> A Society that set out with laud∣able Pretensions; but many Hundreds of People have found to their Cost, that the best Pretences are often made a Cloak for the worst Practices. <HI>Fair and Softly</HI> is now the Word with them: and 'tis fit a profound Stilness should succeed the boisterous Storm they occasioned, in which the Fortunes of Multitudes of innocent Subjects suffered a Wreck, which they will never recover.</P>
<P>The Offices of ORDNANCE and the MINT for Coining Money, are kept in the Tower of <HI>London.</HI></P>

<HEAD>IV. Of the <HI>Mansion-house,</HI> and other most noted Edifices, Squares, and Publick Structures in and about <HI>London.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THAT beautiful Column, called the <HI>Monument,</HI> erected at the Charge of the City, to per∣petuate the fatal Burning of the Whole, cannot be mentioned but with some due Respect to the Build∣ing itself, as well as to the City. It is 202 Feet high, and exceeds all the Obelisks and Pillars of the Antients. There is a Stair-case in the Middle,
<PB N="107" REF="108"/>
to ascend to the Balcony, which is about 30 Feet short of the Top, and whence there are other Steps made even to look out at the Top of all, which is fashioned like an Urn, with a Flame issuing from it.</P>
<P>The Lord Mayors of this famous Metropolis have been hitherto forced to content themselves with re∣siding in some one or other of the stately Halls of the City Companies, hired for that Purpose; an In∣convenience which was equally unworthy of the Grandeur of the great Officer, and of the City over which he presided, and which now will be soon remedied; for on the 25th Day of <HI>October</HI> 1739, the chief Corner-stone of the Mansion-house was laid by the Right Honourable <HI>Micajah Perry,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> then Lord Mayor, and by the Committee ap∣pointed for that Purpose, in the Place where <HI>Stocks-market</HI> used to be kept, with an Inscription on it signifying as much, and giving the Names of the Gentlemen of the said Committee, the Sheriffs, and the Architect; but perhaps it may be as much to the latter Gentleman's Credit, not to name him, as to name him; for Connoisseurs find so many Faults with the Design, that if what they say is true, tho' it may be a costly Building, yet will it not do any great Honour to this famous Metropolis, among good Judges.</P>
<P>The <HI>Royal Exchange</HI> is the greatest Burse in the World. It is so well known, and has been so often described, that it is unnecessary for me to enter upon it here. 'Tis said, that it cost above 80,000<HI>l.</HI> in building; and yet the Interest of the Money was a great while answered by the Rent made of the Shops and Vaults: but now the Trade that used to be carried on there, is so dispersed in other Places, that it cannot be supposed to do so. According to Archi∣tectural Criticism, the Building has numerous Faults: the Turret is egregiously bad, tho' a very expensive Part of the Structure.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="109"/>The Hospital of <HI>Bethlehem</HI> is a noble Pile; but we shall take notice of it under the Head of HOSPITALS.</P>
<P>The <HI>South-Sea House,</HI> the <HI>Bank,</HI> the <HI>East-India House,</HI> &amp;c. also the <HI>Treasury,</HI> the <HI>Admiralty,</HI> the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> the <HI>Excise,</HI> and other Publick Offices, are taken notice of under the preceding Article of PUBLICK OFFICES, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>College of Physicians</HI> in <HI>Warwick-lane</HI> is a beautiful and magnificent Structure, built of Brick and Stone, and is one of the finest Ornaments of the City, tho' built in a Place where all its Beauties are in a manner buried. We have not room to be so particular in its Description as it very well deserves; but we shall take notice, that in the Front of the Hall towards the Court, is a Statue of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. well cut in Stone.</P>
<P>On the West-side of the Theatre is another, of Sir <HI>John Cutler</HI>; and in <HI>June</HI> 1739, a very fine Busto, carved out of a Block of White Marble, was erected in the great Hall of this College, to the Honour of the famous Dr. <HI>Harvey,</HI> with the follow∣ing Inscription on its Marble Pediment.

<P>The <HI>Surgeons</HI> Theatre in <HI>Monkwell-street</HI> is a fine Piece of Architecture, admirably disposed for Seeing and Hearing; the Work of the famous <HI>Inigo Jones.</HI> The noble Earl of <HI>Burlington,</HI> out of Love to the
<PB N="109" REF="110"/>
Memory of this Architect, was pleased to repair it at his own Charge.</P>
<P>In the Hall of this Theatre is a capital Picture of <HI>Hans Holbein,</HI> in which is the Portrait of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. sitting in his Chair, delivering the Charter which he granted to the College of Phy∣sicians, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is said, the Company have been offered 800<HI>l.</HI> for this Piece; for it is highly valuable as it is the only remaining Picture of the first Painter of Note in this Kingdom (his celebrated Piece, called <HI>The Dance of Death,</HI> being destroy'd by Fire); and not only presents the King taken from the Life, but also the most eminent Physicians of that Time, when the Incorporation was granted; and excepting the famous Family-piece, by <HI>Titian,</HI> in the Possession of the Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> and another of the <HI>Pem∣broke</HI> Family, at <HI>Wilton,</HI> painted by <HI>Vandyke,</HI> it is esteemed the most valuable <HI>Portrait-picture</HI> in the Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Thanet-house,</HI> in <HI>Aldersgate-street,</HI> built by <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> is intirely worthy of him; but it is now let out to a Tavern, and other Trades, as unworthy of its Founder, as of its Architect.</P>
<P>The Palace of the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> is over-against it. It is an old Building, and no otherwise remark∣able, than that it is let out to Tradesmen chiefly, and has not been for a great while the Residence of its Bishop, who has a Country Palace at <HI>Fulham</HI>; and the Air of the <HI>Court</HI> being judged better than that of the <HI>City, Whitehall</HI> has been preferred to it for a Town-residence.</P>
<P>Several Acts of Parliament have passed within these few Years, for building a new Bridge over the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and Three successive Lotteries have been given for that End. It was at first re∣solved to be built at the <HI>Horse-ferry</HI> over to <HI>Lam∣beth</HI>; but those who had most Influence changing their Minds, the Design was altered, and it is now
<PB N="110" REF="111"/>
begun at the <HI>Woolstaple,</HI> near <HI>Palace-yard,</HI> and is to be carry'd to <HI>Stangate</HI> on the opposite Side. Great Powers are given by this Act to Commissioners to agree with Persons who own Houses and Lands on either Shore: and they intend to pull down whole Streets about <HI>Palace-yard,</HI> and <HI>Channing-row,</HI> besides what they are to do on the <HI>Surry</HI> Side, for the more commodious Passage to it. In short, if the Plan be pursued that is proposed, it will be a very considerable Work: but yet, we must say, that the greatest Part of the Expence would have been saved, had it been built where first proposed; and as the Money is raised by Lotteries, which are always of pernicious Con∣sequence to Trade, it had been perhaps as well, in the present Juncture of the publick Affairs, that the nearest way had been followed: and I may presume to intimate, that tho' the Horse-ferry were to be rejected, yet <HI>Scotland-yard,</HI> which is a great Body of ruinous or decaying Buildings, and joins to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and to which the main Streets point, leading down from <HI>Pall-mall, Picadilly,</HI> &amp;c. by <HI>Charing-cross,</HI> would have been, in my humble Opinion, a preferable Situation. 'Tis certain it might have been effected there, not only with more Conveniency, but at an easy Expence to what now must be the Case; and there had been no need to have pulled down the Houses of Tradesmen, and others, which brought in tolerable Rents, by their Vicinity to <HI>Westminster-hall,</HI> and the Two Houses of Parliament. Several Stone Piers are already erected in the <HI>Thames,</HI> and they are proceeding with one of the noblest Streets of Houses, that are any where to be seen, fronting <HI>Palace-yard.</HI> And here we shall leave it for this time, chusing rather to describe <HI>what is,</HI> than what is <HI>designed to be</HI>; since the Time this Work will take up still, may subject it to several Alterations, now not easy to be foreseen.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="112"/>The new-built Houses of the Dukes of <HI>Montagu</HI> and <HI>Richmond,</HI> in the <HI>Privy-Garden,</HI> are convenient and noble Structures.</P>
<P>The <HI>Meuse,</HI> near <HI>Charing-Cross,</HI> where the King's Horses are kept, and the Coaches of State set up, is a very large kind of Square; but the Buildings being old, and unworthy of the Situation, as well as of the Use, are, as 'tis said, to be pulled down, and built in a beautiful manner. The principal Range at the upper End is already finish'd; and when the other Parts are completed, it will be one of the finest Things of its kind in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>On the right Side of the Street, coming from <HI>Whitehall,</HI> is <HI>Northumberland-house,</HI> belonging to the Duke of <HI>Somerset</HI> in Right of Marriage.</P>
<P>It is an antient, but large and well-design'd Build∣ing, and fit to receive a Retinue of One hundred in Family; nor does the Duke's Family come so far short of the Number, as not very handsomely to fill the House.</P>
<P><HI>Carlton</HI> House and Gardens, adjoining to St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park, belong to his Royal Highness the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>; who has built an Octagon at the West-end of his Garden, which is elegantly fur∣nished. The lower Part is a Grotto, or fine Bathe∣ing-room; over which is a Dining-room finely adorn'd with Pictures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and with Four Marble Busto's of <HI>Shakespear, Milton, Dryden,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI> On the Outside over the Door, one on each Side, are placed the Busto's of the renown'd King <HI>Alfred</HI> and <HI>Edward the Black Prince,</HI> both so famous in <HI>English</HI> History, with Inscriptions to their Ho∣nour, which, at the same time, are equally so to that of the Royal Erector of them, who gives a glorious Specimen therein of what Examples he thinks most worthy of his heroick Imitation.</P>
<P>The noble Houses of the late Dukes of <HI>Marlbo∣rough</HI> and <HI>Buckinghamshire</HI> in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park, are
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
too well known to need any particular Descrip∣tion.</P>
<P>The new-built House of the Duke of <HI>Devonshire</HI> in <HI>Picadilly</HI> (that noble one built by the famous <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> being destroy'd by Fire in 1733); the newly beautified one of the Duke of <HI>Bedford</HI> in <HI>Bloomsbury-Square</HI>; those of the Lord <HI>Bateman,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Queensbury,</HI> General <HI>Wade,</HI> and the late Lord <HI>Bing∣ley</HI>; the noble and extensive Streets of Buildings about <HI>Soho, Grosvenor, Cavendish,</HI> and <HI>Hanover-squares,</HI> with those noble Squares themselves, and the new Alterations in St. <HI>James</HI>'s-<HI>square, Red-lion-square, Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</HI>; the new Buildings about <HI>Jockey-Fields, Chancery-lane, Fetter-lane, Serjeants-Inn, Craven-street,</HI> and the <HI>New-Exchange</HI> in the <HI>Strand,</HI> now all built into fine Houses, would take up too much of my Room to particularize; and I can there∣fore only name them, having so many curious Mat∣ters to add in these Letters.</P>
<P>But yet I cannot forbear particularly to mention one Beauty, because it is an Honour to our Coun∣try; and that is the great Piazza in <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> the noblest Square in <HI>Europe,</HI> for Grandeur of the Design, especially with the Beauty of the East Front of that elegant Church, the only Piece the Moderns have yet produced, that can admit of a just Comparison with the Works of Antiquity; where a majestick Simplicity commands the Appro∣bation of the Judicious. The rustick Arcade round the Square is of an excellent Composition; above which is a grand Story and an Attick, and the Win∣dows dress'd with a regular Entablature.</P>
<P>I must but slightly mention, for the Reasons already given, the new Road in <HI>Hyde-park,</HI> the Re∣servoirs in the Two Parks, the late Queen's Library, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which may just serve as a Hint to Travellers who have less upon their Hands than I have upon mine.</P>

<HEAD>V. Of the principal Hospitals and other Charitable Institutions in and about the City of <HI>London.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NO City in the World can shew the like Num∣ber of private and publick Charities, as the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P>I have not Room particularly to describe them; and must therefore content myself with giving little more than their Names, and those of their muni∣ficent Founders, referring to those larger Works where more ample Accounts and Descriptions may be expected.</P>
<P N="1">1. then, I will mention <HI>Bethlehem</HI> Hospital in <HI>Moorfields,</HI> erected at the Charge of the City, <HI>Anno</HI> 16 6, and said to be built after the Model of <HI>Ver∣sailles.</HI> This has lately received very great Additions, and is design'd for the Reception of Lunaticks.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Bridewell</HI> is as well an House of Correction as an Hospital. It was formerly the King's City Palace, but given to the City by King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. for the reclaiming of idle Persons, Vagrants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and for bringing up Lads to Handicraft Businesses.</P>
<P>There are Two other Houses of Correction, call'd <HI>Bridewells,</HI> one at <HI>Clerkenwell,</HI> for <HI>Middlesex,</HI> the other in <HI>To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hill-fields</HI> for <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Christ's-Hospital,</HI> originally founded by King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. (at the Request of the Lord-Mayor and Aldermen of <HI>London,</HI> and of the pious Martyr Dr. <HI>Ridley,</HI> then Bishop of <HI>London</HI>) for entertaining, educating, nourishing, and bringing up the poor Children of the Citizens, such as, their Parents (or Fathers, at least) being dead, have no other way of Support.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="115"/>This noble Charity maintains near 1000 poor Children, who have Food, Cloathing, and Instru∣ction, useful and sufficient Learning, and an exceed∣ing good Discipline observ'd; and at the proper Ages they are put out to Trades suitable to their several Genius's and Capacities; and others are taught Mathematicks, Navigation, and Arithmetick, to fit them for private and publick Service. The seeing of these Children at Church on a <HI>Sunday</HI> at <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> and at Supper on <HI>Sunday</HI> Evening, may be reckon'd as fine a Sight as any in <HI>London,</HI> and occa∣sions a constant Resort of People of all Ranks, who admire the Neatness of their Appearance, and the good Management of the House. Dependent on this noble Charity is also an House at <HI>Hertford,</HI> where Diet, Schooling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are given to the younger Boys.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>St. Bartholomew</HI>'s Hospital adjoins to <HI>Christ</HI>'s Hospital. Its first Foundation may be said to be owing to King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. whose Statue in Stone, very well done, is, for that Reason, erected in the new Front, over the Entrance to the <HI>Cloyster</HI> in <HI>West-Smithfield,</HI> with Two Cripples, no mean Pieces of Sculpture, on the Top of the Pediment over his Head. This Hospital has received very great Additions of late Years, and they are going on building still, and 'tis well if they do not overdo it; for they demolish their Houses, and reduce their Estates by it, and leave it upon the Generosity of future Benefactors to sup∣port what they are about.</P>
<P>This Hospital relieves about 600 Patients daily with Lodging, Diet, Physick, and Chirurgery.</P>
<P>The <HI>Locke</HI> at <HI>Kingsland,</HI> and that in <HI>Southwark,</HI> belong to <HI>St. Bartholomew</HI>'s Hospital, and are used for such as have the foul Disease only.</P>
<P>There generally is under the Care of this Hospital upwards of 5000 poor sick and lame Persons, desti∣tute of other Relief.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="115" REF="116"/>5. <HI>St. Thomas's Hospital</HI> in <HI>Southwark</HI> is also a noble Piece of Charity, of the like Nature with that of <HI>St. Bartholomew.</HI> The Church and most of the Hospital was rebuilt in a beautiful manner from the Year 1701 to 1706. It was founded by <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. and Inscriptions are set up in it to the Honour of Mr. <HI>Guy,</HI> Mr. <HI>Frederick,</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> the last of whom has his Statue there, as has King <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. lately erected by <HI>Charles Joy,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> late Treasurer of this Hospital.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Guy</HI>'s <HI>Hospital</HI> is situated very near <HI>St. Thomas</HI>'s <HI>Hospital,</HI> and is perhaps one of the greatest private Charities that was ever known. Its Founder, <HI>Tho∣mas Guy,</HI> was a Bookseller in <HI>Lombard-street.</HI> He lived to see this Work in great Forwardness, and at his Death, <HI>Anno</HI> 1724, left about 200,000<HI>l.</HI> to finish and endow it. <HI>Anno</HI> 1734, Mr. <HI>Guy</HI>'s Statue was erected in the principal Square.</P>
<P>Tho' this Hospital is said to be for Incurables, it is not for such as are absolutely so; for the Founder used to say, That he would not have his Hospital made an Alms-house.</P>
<P>Over and above the 200,000<HI>l.</HI> left to this Hospi∣tal, the Founder left as many Legacies, and other Dispositions, as were computed to amount to near 150,000<HI>l.</HI> more.</P>
<P N="7">7. The <HI>London Workhouse,</HI> as it is called, founded on an Act of Parliament passed in the 13th Year of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. is situated without <HI>Bishopsgate,</HI> and is an Edifice consisting of several Work-rooms and Lodging-rooms for Vagrants and Parish-Children.</P>
<P>They have a handsome Chapel built at the upper End of the Yard belonging to the House, where they go to Prayers twice a Day, at Seven in the Morn∣ing, and at Seven in the Evening. On <HI>Sundays</HI> they all go to <HI>St. Helen</HI>'s, where they have Seats.</P>
<P>The Charity-schools and Workhouses set up in almost every Parish of this prodigious City, have in
<PB N="116" REF="117"/>
some measure pursued the Design of this laudable Workhouse; and if they have thereby interfered with it, and taken off some Benefactions that otherwise might have flowed into that Canal, it will be the less to be wondered at.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Hospital called the <HI>Charter-House,</HI> or <HI>Sutton</HI>'s Hospital, must be recorded to be the greatest and noblest Gift that ever was given for Charity, by any one Man, publick or private, in this Nation, since History gives us any Account of Things; ex∣cept we give a Preference to that of Mr. <HI>Guy.</HI> The Revenue of Mr. <HI>Sutton</HI>'s Hospital being, besides the Purchase of the Place, and the Building of the House, and other Expences, little less than 6000<HI>l. per Annum</HI> Revenue: it is of so long standing, and its Government, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so well known, that we shall afford it no further Mention.</P>
<P>The Royal Hospitals of <HI>Greenwich</HI> and <HI>Chelsea</HI> are also not mentioned in this Account, as not be∣ing within the Reach of the extended Bounds of the City of <HI>London,</HI> as we have laid them down, and are therefore taken Notice of in their proper Places.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greycoat</HI> and <HI>Greencoat</HI> Hospital in <HI>Tothill∣fields, Emanuel</HI> Hospital, <HI>Westminster</HI>; that for the Poor of the <HI>French</HI> Refugees, near <HI>Islington</HI>; the <HI>Ironmongers</HI> Alms-houses near <HI>Shoreditch</HI>; Alderman <HI>Aske</HI>'s at <HI>Hoxton</HI>; those stately ones of the <HI>Trinity-house,</HI> the <HI>Vintners,</HI> and several others in the Way to <HI>Mile-End</HI>; as also those handsome ones, lately erected by the Will of Mr. <HI>Francis Bancroft,</HI> a Lord-Mayor's Officer, in the same Road, all de∣serve particular Mention, had I room for it.</P>
<P>But I must say a Word or two of those useful Charities, the Two Infirmaries, one in <HI>James</HI>'s-<HI>street, Westminster,</HI> and the other at <HI>Hyde-park Corner,</HI> which have given Birth to the like laudable Institu∣tions in other Parts of the Kingdom. The Design of them is to supply the Places of the Hospitals of
<PB N="117" REF="118"/>
<HI>St. Bartholomew</HI> and <HI>St. Thomas</HI>'s aforemention'd, there being no such charitable Foundations in the City of <HI>Westminster.</HI> And here the best Order is observ'd, the best Medicines dispensed, and the best Assistances given, as well by Physicians, as Surgeons and Apothecaries, to all who are admitted into these Charities. I shall refer you to the Accounts pub∣lish'd by each every Year, for further Particulars of their Institutions, Progress and Success.</P>
<P>In <HI>August</HI> 1732, a Corporation was erected for the Relief of poor Officers Widows belonging to the Navy, which allots 45<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> to a Captain's Widow; 30<HI>l.</HI> to a Lieutenant's; and 20<HI>l.</HI> to the Widows of Boatswains, Gunners, Carpenters, Pur∣sers, Surgeons, Second Master of a Yacht, or Ma∣ster of a Naval Vessel, warranted by the Navy-board; provided the annual Incomes of their Real and Personal Estates do not amount to the aforesaid yearly Sums. To this Charity all Admirals, Cap∣tains, Lieutenants and Warrant Officers, pay 3<HI>d. per</HI> Pound out of their Salaries; and his Majesty King <HI>George</HI> II. graciously contributed 10,000<HI>l.</HI> as a Foundation for it.</P>
<P>In the Year 1739, a most useful and long-wish'd-for Charity was establish'd by Royal Charter, in order to found an Hospital for the Maintenance and Education of exposed and deserted young Children, otherwise called Foundlings.</P>
<P>An Act of Parliament has passed for confirming and inlarging the Powers granted by this Charter, and to enable them to execute the good Purposes thereof; and several Meetings of the Governors and Guardians have been held, and Sixty Children have been determined to be admitted for a Beginning; and as many Gentlemen have already subscribed, it is to be hoped, that Succes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will attend this praise∣worthy and long-wish'd-for Undertaking. The Governors have hired the House in <HI>Hatton-Garden,</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="119"/>
wherein the late Sir <HI>Fisher Tench</HI> lived, till they shall be able to build a proper Hospital, which they intend to do on the North Side of <HI>Ormond-street,</HI> and <HI>Lamb</HI>'s Conduit, having purchased of the Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> Four Fields of Pasture Land, contain∣ing Fifty-six Acres, at the Rate of 7000<HI>l.</HI> for the Purpose.</P>
<P>The Corporation for Clergymens Sons deserves also to be taken Notice of, as an excellent Institu∣tion; but we must draw to a Conclusion of this Article.</P>
<P>We shall only further observe in general, That those noble Foundations, added to the innumerable Alms-houses which are to be seen in almost every Part of <HI>London,</HI> make it certain, that there is no City in the World can shew the like Number of Charities from private Hands, there being not less than Twenty thousand People maintain'd of Cha∣rity, besides the Charities of Schooling for Chil∣dren, and besides the Collections at the annual Feasts of several Kinds, where Money is given for putting out Children Apprentices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a great Number of which owe their Rise to the Period of Time included in 40 Years past; so that the <HI>Papists</HI> have no Reason to boast, that there were greater Benefactions and Acts of Charity to the Poor given in their Days, than in our Protestant Times. And this is, indeed, one of the principal Reasons for my making mention of it in this Place; for let any par∣ticular Age be singled out, and let the Charities of this Age, for about 40 Years past, and the Sums of Money bestowed by Protestants in this Nation on mere Acts of Charity to the Poor, not reckon∣ing Gifts to the Church, be cast up, it will appear they are greater by far, than can be found in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> in any the like Number of Years, take the Time when we will.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="120"/>Nor do I include in this, the Money collected by Briefs all over <HI>England,</HI> upon Casualties by Fire, though that is an eminent Act of Charity as any can be; nor the Money given either in publick or private, for Rebuilding <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s and other Churches demolished by the Fire of <HI>London,</HI> or the Augmen∣tation of poor Benefices by the Bounty of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> and many other such Gifts.</P>

<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="account">
<HEAD>VI. Of the Churches of <HI>London, Westminster,</HI> and <HI>Southwark.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE are within the Walls of <HI>London,</HI> 97 Parishes; without the Walls, 17; in the Out-Parishes in <HI>Middlesex</HI> and <HI>Surrey,</HI> in the Bills of Mortality, 21; and in the City and Liberty of <HI>West∣minster,</HI> 10; in all, 145. We shall as briefly as possible touch upon the most remarkable Churches.</P>
<P>We must observe in the first Place, That the Churches in <HI>London</HI> are rather convenient than fine, not adorn'd with Pomp and Pageantry, as in <HI>Popish</HI> Countries; but, like the true Protestant Plainness, have very little Ornament either within or with∣out.</P>
<P>But the most famous of all the Churches in the City, and of all the Protestant Churches in the World, is the Cathedral of <HI>St. Paul</HI>; an Edifice exceeding∣ly beautiful and magnificent, with fewer Faults than are to be found in any Building of the like Nature and Extent; tho' some, who would be thought to have Skill in Architecture, are pleased to say there are many, and particularly censure it for its Heavi∣ness, tho' perhaps it would be found, that the Fault is in their not considering separately the Beauty and Proportion of every Part, in order to enter into the Nature and Design of the whole Composition.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="121"/>The vast Extent of the horizontal Arch of the Cupola, which supports a Stone Lantern near 70 Feet high, may well account for the Strength of the Piers and Butments below: Eight of which sup∣port the Whole of that prodigious Weight. And tho' common Observers assert, that those Piers, as also the Piers of all the Arches within-side, are too thick and heavy, yet, whoever knows any thing of the Rules of Architecture, must allow them to be as slender as the Strictness of those Rules would admit of; for the Thickness of each Pier is not one Third Part of the Void of each Arch. And as to the Piers which support the Dome, they, when com∣par'd with those that support the Cupola of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s at <HI>Rome,</HI> come out to be but one Third Part of the Bigness of the latter, the one measuring 240 Feet in Circumference, the other not quite 80; yet there is not a great deal of Difference in the Dimensions and Weight of the Two Cupola's. For that of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s is considerably larger and higher in Propor∣tion to the Piers that support it, and to the Body of the Church, than that of <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s. Wherefore I may venture, upon the whole, to assert, that were we to compare every Part of the Two Buildings together, we shall find <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s to be much less liable to the Objection of being a heavy Pile, than <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The chief Reason, as I imagine, why this Church is censur'd for Heaviness, is, not that it is really so in itself, but appears so, compar'd with the <HI>Gothick</HI> Architecture, which is more familiar to some Per∣sons than the other, and admits of an extravagant Airiness and Lightness In that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Building the Designer is bound down to no Rules of Proportion but what his own F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncy sug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whereas in the other, the Dimens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns of every individual Member are ascertained, which cannot be deviated from with∣out occasioning a Fault. The Height of every
<PB N="121" REF="122"/>
Arch hath a fix'd Proportion to its Breadth; the Doors, Windows and their Ornaments are the same; the Intercolumniations and their Intablatures are all confin'd to certain Admeasurement. But who ever found that Exactness observ'd in any <HI>Gothick</HI> Stru∣cture? It must be allowed there are Pieces of that Sort of Architecture, that, in the Whole, look very august and venerable. Yet let any one view the vast Stone Buttresses round the Outside of <HI>Westminster</HI> Abbey, and see what Confusion of Lines, and Breaks they occasion in the Perspective, and they will then easily account for the Lightness of the Inside of that Building; for they are those Buttresses, which by extending so far out, support the whole Structure, more than its Walls or Pillars. This I mention for the sake of common Observers only; for to the Judicious it is altogether unnecessary.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Christopher Wren</HI> had the Satisfaction to find the injudicious Reprovers of his Work confuted by the Approbation of the best Masters in <HI>Europe,</HI> who allow'd, That the Church of <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s at <HI>Rome,</HI> which is the most stupendous Structure in the World, only exceeds <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s with respect to the Large∣ness of its Dimensions, its rich <HI>Mosaick</HI> Work, the beautiful Marble, of which both its Outside and In∣side intirely consist, the latter in different Colours, its Statues, Paintings, Gildings, Altars, and Ora∣tories; Ornaments not allowed of in Protestant Churches.</P>
<P>Had the Inside of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s been adorned in as profuse and pompous a Manner as <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s, it would have attracted the Admiration of superficial Criticks, so that they would never have been able to discover the Faults they now pretend to find; Faults which can only be attributed to the Plainness of its Materials. But to such as are real Judges, the Harmony, Proportion and Beauty of Buildings are equally admirable, whether they be executed in plain
<PB N="122" REF="123"/>
Free-stone, or the most beautiful Marble; whether the Carvings or Mouldings be gilt or not; the Re∣cesses or Panels in the Walls be curiously painted, or only plaister'd.</P>
<P>In the Year 1707, the House of Commons had it under Consideration, whether the Cupola should be cover'd with <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is an authentick Account of the Matter.</NOTE> Copper or Lead; and upon Inquiry into which was most expedient and least expensive, it appear'd, that the Covering of Lead would amount to about 170 Tons, and the Expence thereof, in∣cluding Workmanship, was estimated at 2500<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>The Copper Covering was computed at Eleven Tons, Three hundred, Three Quarters and odd Pounds, and the Expence was estimated at 3050<HI>l.</HI> Upon which the House fixed upon a Copper Cover∣ing.</P>
<P>But when the Bill which had a Clause in it for that Purpose, went up to the Lords, their Lordships left out the Clause; upon which the Commons de∣sired a Conference, alleging, that Copper was pre∣ferable to any other Covering, as well in respect of Duration as Lightness; for that Lead being sub∣ject to frequent Repairs, the necessary Scaffolding for that Purpose at any one time, would exceed the Difference of Charge between that and Copper: besides, that frequent Scaffolding would very much prejudice the Building. But the Sessions closing the same Day, put an End to the Affair, and there were no Conferences; tho' the preceding Reasons were what the Commons intended to offer, if there had been one.</P>
<P>It very probably was upon this Occasion, that Sir <HI>Christopher</HI> is said to have declared his Opinion in the House of Commons, when some Gentlemen doubted whether the Cupola would bear the Leaden Covering, that it was able to bear 7000 Tons more than what is now upon it, and that he would under∣take
<PB N="123" REF="124"/>
to raise a Spire of Stone upon the whole 100 Feet higher than the Cross now stands.</P>
<P>The Expence of this magnificent Structure, as it was laid before the Parliament <HI>Anno</HI> 1711, including the Building of the Chapter-house near it, a neat and elegant Fabrick, purchasing of Property, together with the Estimate of what was necessary to com∣plete the whole, in which was concluded a Ring of Twelve Bells, not yet put up, nor cast, as also the Furniture for the Choir, amounted to 810,380<HI>l.</HI> 4<HI>s.</HI></P>
<P>These Things, that were not so easy for every one to know, we have thought it necessary to inlarge upon. Our Bounds will not permit us to say all that the Subject requires, and we would not dwell upon Points which every one knows, or may easily inform himself of by his own Observation, or from other Writers, in relation to this famous Structure.</P>
<P>But one thing it will be requisite to observe further, which every one does not know, and which there∣fore I shall mention.</P>
<P>This able Architect, Sir <HI>Christopher Wren,</HI> at the first setting about the Church, would have had its Situation removed a little to the North, to stand just on the Spot of Ground which is taken up by <HI>Pater-noster Row,</HI> and the Buildings on either Side; so that the North-side of the Church should have stood open to <HI>Newgate-street,</HI> and the South-side to the Ground on which the Church now stands.</P>
<P>By this Situation, the East-end of the Church, would have looked directly down the main Street of the City, <HI>Cheapside</HI>; and for the West-end, <HI>Lud∣gate</HI> having been removed a little North, the main Street called <HI>Ludgate-street,</HI> and <HI>Ludgate-hill,</HI> would only have sloped a little W. S. W. as they do now irregularly Two Ways, one within, and the other without the Gate, and all the Street beyond <HI>Fleet-Bridge</HI> would have received no Alteration at all.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="125"/>By this Situation, the common Thorough-fare of the City would have been removed at a little far∣ther Distance from the Work, and we should not then have been obliged to walk just under the very Wall, as we do now, which makes the Work appear out of all Perspective, and is the chief Reason of the Objections I have mention'd, as to the outside Appearance; whereas, had it been viewed at a little Distance, the Building would have been seen infi∣nitely to more Advantage.</P>
<P>Had Sir <HI>Christopher</HI> been allowed this Situation, he would then, also, have had more room for the Ornament of the West-end, which, tho' a most beautiful Work, would have been much more so then, and he would have added a circular Piazza to it, after the Model of that of <HI>Rome,</HI> but much more magnificent, and an Obelisk of Marble in the Centre of the Circle, exceeding any thing that the World can shew of its Kind, of modern Work.</P>
<P>But the Circumstance of Things hindered this noble Design, and the City being almost rebuilt before he obtain'd an Order and Provision for laying the Foundation, he was prescribed to the narrow Spot where it now stands, in which the Building, however magnificent in itself, stands with great Dis∣advantage as to the Prospect of it. The Inconve∣niencies of this were so apparent when the Church was finish'd, that Leave was at length, tho' not without Difficulty, obtain'd, to pull down one whole Row of Houses on the North-side of the Body of the Church, to make Way for the noble Balustrade of cast Iron, raised upon an handsome Stone Wall of above a Yard high, that surrounds the Church-yard; and, indeed, to admit Light into the Church, as well as to preserve it from the Danger of Fire.</P>
<P>That admirable Architect met with no better Suc∣cess in a Plan which was one of the most beautiful
<PB N="125" REF="126"/>
that could enter the Mind of Man, and would have made this City the noblest on Earth: this I shall relate in the Words of a certain Author, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Fire of <HI>London</HI> furnish'd the most perfect Occasion that can ever happen in any City, to rebuild it with Pomp and Regularity. This Sir <HI>Christopher Wren</HI> foresaw, and, 'tis said, offer'd a Scheme which would have made it the Wonder of the World. He proposed to have laid out one large Street from <HI>Aldgate</HI> to <HI>Temple-Bar</HI>; in the middle of which was to have been a large Square capable of containing the new Church of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, with a proper Distance for the View all round; whereby that huge Building would not have been cooped up, as 'tis at present, in such a manner, as no-where to be seen to Advantage at all; but would have had a long and ample Vista at each End, to have reconcil'd it to a proper Point of View, and give it one great Benefit, which in all Probability, it must now want for ever. He far∣ther proposed to rebuild all the Parish-churches in such a Manner, as to be seen at the End of every Vista of Houses, and dispersed in such Distances from each other, as to appear neither too thick, nor thin in Prospect, and give a proper Heighten∣ing to the whole Bulk of the City, as it filled the Landschape. Lastly, he proposed to build all the Houses uniform, and supported on a Piazza, like that of <HI>Covent-Garden:</HI> and by the Water-side from the Bridge to the <HI>Temple,</HI> he had planned a long and broad Wharf, or Quay, where he de∣signed to have ranged all the Halls that belong to the several Companies of the City, with proper Ware-houses for Merchants between, to vary the Edifices, and make it at once one of the most beautiful and most useful Ranges of Structure in the World. But the Hurry of Rebuilding, and
<PB N="126" REF="127"/>
the Disputes of Property, prevented this glorious Scheme from taking Place."</Q></P>
<P>When this great Man found he could not carry this Point, he proposed what we have already men∣tion'd; but, as we have observ'd, with as little Suc∣cess as the above grand Scheme; private Property, on this Occasion, as it does on most others, get∣ting the better both of publick Utility and publick Spirit.</P>
<P>The new Churches at <HI>Lime-house, Ratcliffe-highway, Spital-fields, Old-street,</HI> the <HI>Strand, Or∣mond-street, Hanover-square,</HI> the <HI>Horse-ferry, Blooms∣bury,</HI> I can but just mention, tho' they deserve to be taken notice of by Travellers. But the latter, I must observe, was the first Building, wherein was in∣troduced a Portico after the Manner of the antient Temples. The Body of the Church is a masterly Performance; but the placing, for a Weather-cock, the Statue of a Prince famous for good Sense and Steadiness, is an Absurdity peculiar to the Church of <HI>Bloomsbury.</HI></P>
<P>The new-built Steeples or Towers of <HI>St. Marga∣ret</HI>'s <HI>Westminster, St. Michael</HI>'s <HI>Cornhill, St. Mary Aldermary, St. Sepulchre</HI>'s, <HI>St. Christopher</HI>'s, <HI>St. Dunstan</HI>'s in the East, <HI>St. Clement</HI>'s-<HI>Danes,</HI> and the new-built Churches of <HI>St. Mary Woolnoth, Bishops-gate, St. Leonard Shoreditch, St. Catharine Cole∣man, St. Martin</HI>'s in the Fields, <HI>St. Giles</HI>'s, I can only mention.</P>
<P>Among the Beauties of <HI>London,</HI> must be num∣bered the admirable Church of <HI>St. Stephen Wal∣brooke,</HI> the <HI>Temple-Church, Bow-Church, St. Cle∣ment</HI>'s-<HI>Danes, St. Paul Covent-Garden</HI>; and that incomparable Piece called <HI>The Banqueting-house</HI> at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> now made use of as a Chapel. This was the Design of <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> as one Pavilion for that admirable Model he gave for a Palace. And if this Specimen has justly commanded the Admiration of
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
Mankind, what must the finish'd Piece have done! It is to be hoped <HI>Britain</HI> will one Day have the Glory to accomplish it, according to this Plan, and then it will far exceed all the Palaces of the Universe. Here is Strength with Politeness, Ornament with Simplicity, and Beauty with Majesty. It is without Dispute one of the noblest Structures in the World. The Ceiling is an admirable fine Piece of Painting by <HI>Rubens.</HI></P>
<P>The Abbey or Collegiate Church of <HI>Westminster</HI> is a venerable old Pile of Building; but begins to appears with a new Face; for a Tower is actually finish'd at the West-end, and another is about. The Beginning of a fine and costly Spire was also laid some time ago, near the Middle of the Edifice, which however is yet uncertain whether it will be proceeded on or not. The West Window fronting these Towers is one of the most beautiful in Glass Painting that has been done of late Years; and the Window also fronting <HI>King-street,</HI> finish'd in the Deanry of the late Bishop <HI>Atterbury,</HI> is one of the finest modern Performances of its kind.</P>
<P>We are also assur'd, that the Houses adjoining to this venerable Building will be all pull'd down, and the Building left clear: an Action that will be as laudable when done, as it was scandalous when begun; the Effect of private Avarice, whereby that vene∣rable Pile is subjected to the Hazards of Fire, and other Accidents, whenever an idle Servant shall get in a sottish, a careless, or sleepy Fit.</P>
<P>But after all, this Building, tho' very expensive, is far less elegant than several other <HI>Gothick</HI> Stru∣ctures. Its Outside can never be made beautiful; and within, it is extravagantly out of Proportion, with regard to the Height and Breadth of the middle Nef and Side-Ayles. The high Altar withinside is a noble Piece, and had a wonderful fine Effect from the
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
West Door, before the Organ lately erected inter∣cepted its View.</P>
<P>The Towers at the West-end, which I have just mention'd, as they stand so close together, are not sufficiently contracted in the carrying them up. The Four Pinacles have a very wretched Effect, when viewed in a diagonal Line. The Style of the Build∣ing, so far as is intire new Work, is a sort of Med∣ley, neither <HI>Gothick,</HI> nor any thing else. As so many beautiful Structures of this Kind are to be seen, it is amazing, that any Architect should be above imitating them, when 'tis plain he cannot equal, much less excel them.</P>
<P>This Abbey is the Repository of the deceas'd <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Kings and Nobility, and very fine Monuments are seen over the Graves of our antient Sovereigns: the Particulars are too long to enter into here.</P>
<P>The Monarchs of <HI>Great Britain</HI> are likewise al∣ways crown'd here.</P>
<P>The Churches in <HI>Southwark</HI> are as follow:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Church of <HI>St. Mary,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>St. Mary Overy,</HI> and <HI>St. Saviour</HI> in <HI>Southwark,</HI> is a noble <HI>Gothick</HI> Pile; having Three Ayles running from East to West, and a Cross Ayle after the Manner of a Cathedral.</ITEM>

<HEAD>VII. Of <HI>St. James</HI>'s <HI>Palace,</HI> the <HI>Parliament-House, Westminster-Hall,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Palace of <HI>St. James</HI>'s, tho' the Winter Receptacle of all the Pomp and Glory of this Kingdom, is really mean, in Comparison of the glorious Court of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> The Splendor of the Nobility, the Wealth and Greatness of the At∣tendants, the Oeconomy of the House, and the real Grandeur of the whole Royal Family, out-does all the Courts of <HI>Europe</HI>; and yet this Palace comes beneath those of the most petty Princes in it; altho' there cannot be in the World a nobler Situation for a Royal Palace than <HI>Whitehall.</HI> And it is with some Concern, that we see so fine a Spot become a Sacri∣fice to private Spirit, so much of it being given away to particular Families, as makes more remote than we might otherwise expect it to be, the Hope we might justly have entertained, of seeing a Palace built there, worthy of the Glory of our Monarchs.</P>
<P>Many Plans have been drawn for the rebuilding of this Palace; but the most celebrated Draughts are those of <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> and may be seen in Mr. <HI>Camp∣bell</HI>'s <HI>Vitruvius Britannicus,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Kent</HI>'s Edition of <HI>Jones</HI>'s Works. The last of these, if executed, would, for Magnificence and Beauty, transcend even the Temple of <HI>Solomon,</HI> if we are to form a Judg∣ment from the Plans given of that famous Edifice. But 'tis a Question whether the Expence would not exceed that of <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s at <HI>Rome,</HI> which cost Forty Millions of <HI>Roman</HI> Crowns.</P>
<P>As the Court is now stated, all the Offices and Places for Business are scatter'd about, here and there.</P>
<P>The Parliament meets as they used to do, while the Court was at <HI>Westminster,</HI> in the King's Old Palace; nor can it be said but the Place is made
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
tolerably convenient for them, and is still more so of late Years than it used to be; for the <HI>Court of Re∣quests</HI> is intirely new-built, and made a noble Room; and other Conveniencies are added. The House of Commons meet in the Chapel of the Palace at <HI>West∣minster,</HI> dedicated to St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> and fitted for this Purpose by that admirable Architect Sir <HI>Christopher Wren.</HI></P>
<P>The House of Lords is a venerable old Place, tho' it must be said to be much streightened in the several Avenues to it, and Rooms above it; and particular∣ly the matted Gallery, the Lobby, the back Ways the King goes to it, are very short of the requisite Dignity or Convenience of the Place, and of the Glory of a King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who there meets the Peers and Commons of his Realm, who toge∣ther constitute the most august Assembly in the World.</P>
<P><HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> a very noble <HI>Gothick</HI> Building, in which are held the Courts of Justice, is said to be the largest Room in the World: its Roof, which is the finest of its Kind that can be seen, is 100 Feet wide. And here is held the Coronation-Feast of the Kings and Queens of <HI>England</HI>; also the Courts of Chancery, King's Bench and Common Pleas; and above Stairs, that of the Exchequer. But it must be confess'd, that it makes no very advantageous Appearance without, resembling at a Distance a great Barn, of 300 Feet long; within, it is filled with Booksellers Shops, and those of other Trades; tho' the Alteration lately made in the Chancery and King's Bench Courts, at the upper End of the Hall, and those for the Common Pleas on the Right-hand of it, give it a much better Appearance than it had before.</P>
<P>Adjoining to the Hall are kept the numerous Of∣fices belonging to the Exchequer of <HI>England,</HI> some of them very dark and inconvenient; and such as to
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
a Stranger would afford a no very remote Idea (par∣ticularly in some of the Avenues from Office to Office) of the dismal Mansions to which Money-Transactions often are thought to bring the devoted Subjects of <HI>Plutus.</HI></P>

<P>THIS Article we insert rather for the sake of the Number of the Statues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than their Excellency; tho' some of them must be allow'd to be very valuable.</P>
<P>The Brass Statue of K. <HI>James</HI> II. in the Habit of a <HI>Roman Caesar,</HI> in the <HI>Privy-Garden</HI> at <HI>White-hall,</HI> is a very beautiful one, and can hardly be out-done by any modern Performance of that Kind in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<P>The Statue in Brass of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. on Horse∣back, at <HI>Charing-Cross,</HI> is a curious Piece, tho' not perfect according to the Notion of some Criticks.</P>

<P>On the Front of the Hall of the <HI>College of Phy∣sicians,</HI> toward the Court, is a Statue of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. well cut in Stone. On the West-side of the Theatre is also the Statue of Sir <HI>John Cutler,</HI> carv'd in Stone. A fine Busto of Dr. <HI>Harvey</HI> is also newly erected in the Front of the Hall.</P>
<P>Another of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. in a Niche, is also to be seen in that Part of <HI>Christ's-Hospital</HI> fronting <HI>Grey-friers</HI>; as are also Two of King <HI>Edward</HI> VI.

<HEAD>IX. Of the Gates of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Gates of the City of <HI>London</HI> are seven, besides Posterns. Two of them were demo∣lish'd at the Fire, but beautifully rebuilt. These are <HI>Ludgate</HI> and <HI>Newgate.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ludgate</HI> is a Prison for Debt, for Freemen of the City only.</P>
<P><HI>Newgate</HI> is a Prison for Criminals, both in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Middlesex,</HI> and for Debtors also for <HI>Middlesex,</HI> being the County Gaol.</P>
<P><HI>Moregate</HI> is also rebuilt, and is a very beautiful Gateway, the Arch being near Twenty Feet high, which was done to give room for the City Train'd-bands to go through to the Artillery Ground, where they muster, and that they might march with their Pikes advanced; for then they had Pikemen in every Regiment, as well in the Army as in the Militia, which since that, is quite left off. This makes the Gate look a little out of Proportion, to those who know not the Occasion of it.</P>
<P><HI>Cripplegate</HI> is very old, and makes but a mean Figure.</P>
<P><HI>Bishopsgate</HI> is newly rebuilt, but not with the Elegance that might have been wish'd.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137"/><HI>Aldersgate</HI> and <HI>Aldgate</HI> both make a very hand∣some Appearance.</P>
<P>Most of these Gates are given by the City to the chief Officers to live in, and are very convenient Dwellings.</P>
<P><HI>Temple-Bar</HI> is the only Gate which is erected at the Extent of the City Liberties, and this was occa∣sion'd by some needful Ceremonies, as at the Proclaim∣ing any King or Queen of <HI>England,</HI> at which Time the Gates are shut. The Herald at Arms knocks hard at the Door, the Sheriffs of the City call back, ask∣ing, Who is there? Then the Herald answers, <HI>I come to proclaim,</HI> &amp;c. according to the Name of the Prince who is to succeed to the Crown, and repeat∣ing the Titles of <HI>Great Britain, France,</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> &amp;c. at which the Sheriffs open, and bid them welcome; and so they go on to the <HI>Exchange,</HI> where they make the last Proclamation.</P>
<P>There was formerly another Gate belonging to the City of <HI>London,</HI> called the <HI>Postern-Gate</HI> at <HI>Tower-hill</HI>; but it being partly demolish'd by Time, it is now turned into private Buildings.</P>
<P><HI>Westminster</HI> had no less than Five Gates, and all standing within a small Compass of Ground; as, first, The noble <HI>Gothick</HI> Gate at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> which is left standing for the Beauty of its Workmanship. Se∣condly, A Gate a little farther, where <HI>King-street</HI> begins, which was a good old Structure, and pull'd down a few Years ago to inlarge the Passage. Thirdly, A Gate where now <HI>Union-street</HI> is, com∣municating <HI>King-street</HI> with the <HI>New Palace-yard</HI>; and this has been several Years demolish'd, and the said little Street built where it stood. Fourthly, A Gate leading from <HI>New Palace-yard</HI> to <HI>St. Mar∣garet's-lane,</HI> which has been lately demolish'd, to inlarge that Passage, by which the King goes to the House of Lords. Fifthly, The <HI>Gate-house,</HI> near the West-end of the Abbey, which is an old Building,
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
used for the publick Gaol of the City of <HI>West∣minster.</HI></P>
<P>To these we may also add, the <HI>Water-gate</HI> at <HI>Westminster,</HI> in <HI>New Palace-yard,</HI> near which is begun to be erected the new Bridge.</P>

<P>The last Three are, without Doubt, the greatest in the World of those Kinds.—There are more∣over Multitudes of Coal-merchants, who have Coal∣wharfs, from the <HI>Hermitage</HI> one Way, to the <HI>Horse∣ferry</HI> and <HI>Westminster</HI> another, which may be deemed so many Markets, tho' not publick ones.</P>
<P>These Markets are so considerable in themselves, that they merit a larger and more particular Descrip∣tion, than I have room for. I shall, however, briefly observe of them, That of the fifteen Flesh∣markets for Provisions, Seven of them are of antient Standing; but the others are erected since the Increase of the City. The old ones are, <HI>Leaden-hall, White∣chapel, Newgate-market, Southwark, Clare, St. James</HI>'s, and <HI>Westminster</HI>; to which some add <HI>Honey∣lane,</HI> and these are so considerable, have such Numbers of Buyers, and such an infinite Quantity of Provisions of all Sorts, Flesh, Fish, and Fowl, that especially, with regard to <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> no City in the World can equal them.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="141"/>The great Market called <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> (of which a certain <HI>Spanish</HI> Embassador said, There was as much Meat sold in it in one Month, as would suffice all <HI>Spain</HI> for a Year) contains Three large Squares, every Square having several Outlets into divers Streets, and all into one another. The first, and chief, is called the <HI>Beef-market,</HI> which has two large Gates, one into <HI>Leaden-hall-street,</HI> one into <HI>Grace-church-street</HI>; and two smaller, <HI>viz.</HI> one by a long paved Passage leading into <HI>Lime-street,</HI> and one under a Gateway from the second Square. In this Square, every <HI>Wednesday,</HI> is kept a Market for raw Hides, tann'd Leather, and Shoemakers Tools; and in the Ware-houses, up Stairs, on the East and South-sides of the Square, is the great Market for <HI>Colchester</HI> Bays.</P>
<P>The second Square is divided into two Oblongs: in the first is the Fish-market, and in the other, a Market for Country Higglers, who bring small Things, as Pork, Butter, Eggs, Pigs, Rabbets, Fowls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the North Part of the Fish-market, the Place being too large for the Fishmongers Use, are the Stalls of the Town Butchers for Mutton and Veal, the best and largest of which, that <HI>England</HI> can pro∣duce, are to be bought there; and the East Part is a Flesh-market for Country Butchers.</P>
<P>The third and last Square, which is also very large, is divided into Three Parts: round the Circumference, is the Butter-market, with all the Sorts of Higglery Goods, as before: the South Part is the Poultry-market, and the Bacon-market; and the Centre is an Herb-market. And there have been, lately, still more Conveniences and Additions made to this prodigious Market, which we have not room to particularize.</P>
<P>All the other Markets follow the same Method in proportion to the Room they have for it.</P>
<P>There are Two Corn-markets; <HI>viz. Bear-quay</HI> and <HI>Queenhith.</HI> To the first comes all the vast Quantity
<PB N="141" REF="142"/>
of Corn that is brought into the City by Sea, from the Counties which lie commodious for that Carriage; and here Corn may be said not to be sold by Cart-loads, or Horse-loads, but by Ship-loads; and except the Corn-chambers and Magazines in <HI>Holland,</HI> when the Fleets come in from <HI>Dantzick</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> the whole World cannot equal the Quantity bought and sold here; for no Quantity can be wanted either for Home Consumption, or for Foreign Exportation, but the Corn-factors, who are the Managers of this Market, are ready to supply it.</P>
<P><HI>Queenhith</HI> is chiefly for Malt; the Barley of which takes up the Ground of so many Hundred thousand Acres of Land in the Counties of <HI>Surrey, Bucks, Berks, Oxford, Southampton,</HI> and <HI>Wilts,</HI> and is called West Country Malt.</P>
<P>It is true, there is a very great Quantity of Malt, and of other Corn too, brought to some other Places on the River, and sold there; <HI>viz.</HI> to <HI>Milford-lane,</HI> above the Bridge, and the <HI>Hermitage,</HI> below the Bridge; but this is but, in general, a Branch of the Trade of the other Places.</P>
<P>It must not be omitted, that <HI>Queenhith</HI> is also a very great Market for Meal, as well as Malt, and, perhaps, the greatest in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Vessels which bring this Malt and Meal to <HI>Queenhith,</HI> are worthy Observation. They are remarkable for the Length of the Vessel, and the Burden they carry, and yet the little Water they draw; for some of those Barges carry above a Thou∣sand Quarters of Malt at a time, and yet do not draw Two Feet of Water; and a Thousand Quarters of Malt must be granted to be, at least, a Hundred Tons Burden; and some of these large Barges come as far as from <HI>Abington,</HI> which is about One hundred and Fifty Miles from <HI>London,</HI> if we measure by the River.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="143"/>The next Market, which is more than ordinary remarkable, is the Coal-market at <HI>Billinsgate.</HI> This is kept every Morning on the broad Place just at the Head of <HI>Billinsgate-dock,</HI> and the Place is called <HI>Room-land:</HI> from what old forgotten Original it has that Name, History is silent. I need not, except for the sake of Strangers, take Notice, that the City of <HI>London,</HI> and Parts adjacent, as also all the South of <HI>England,</HI> is supplied with Coals, called therefore <HI>Sea-coal,</HI> from <HI>Newcastle upon Tine,</HI> and from the Coast of <HI>Durham,</HI> and <HI>Northumberland.</HI> This Trade is so considerable, that it is esteemed the great Nursery of our Seamen. I shall have occasion to say more of it in my Account of the Northern Parts of <HI>England.</HI> The Quantity of Coals, which, one Year with an∣other, are burnt and consumed in and about this City, is supposed to be about 500,000 Chalders, every Chalder containing 36 Bushels, and generally weigh∣ing 3000 Weight.</P>
<P>Most of these Coals are bought and sold on this little Spot of <HI>Room-land</HI>; and tho' sometimes, espe∣cially in case of a War, or of contrary Winds, a Fleet of 500 to 700 Sail of Ships, comes up the River at a time, yet they never want a Market. The Brokers of these Coals, are called <HI>Crimps</HI>; the Vessels they load their Ships with at <HI>Newcastle, Keels</HI>; and the Ships that bring them, <HI>Cats,</HI> and <HI>Hags,</HI> or <HI>Hag-boats, Fly-boats,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>The Increase of this Consumption of Coals is another Evidence of the great Increase of the City of <HI>London</HI>; for, within a few Years past, the Import of Coals was not, in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> so great by very near half.</P>
<P>It must be observed, that as the City of <HI>London</HI> occasions the Consumption of so great a Quantity of Corn and Coals, so the Measurement of them is under the Inspection of the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen; and for the Direction of it, there is
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>
allowed a certain Number of Corn-meters, and Coal-meters, whose Places are for Life, and bring them in a very considerable Income.</P>
<P>They have abundance of poor Men imploy'd under them, who are also called Meters, and are or ought to be Freemen of the City.</P>
<P>This is, indeed, a kind of Tax, as well upon the Coals as Corn; but the Buyer is abundantly recom∣pensed, by being ascertained in his Measure; for the sworn Meters are so placed between the Buyer and the Seller, and have so many Eyes upon them, (being besides Men of Character) that there is hardly ever any room for Complaint on this Head.</P>

<HEAD>XII. Of the Publick Schools and Libraries.</HEAD>
<P>WE must be very brief in this Article; nor have we room to say anything of the private Schools, which are hardly to be number'd.</P>
<P>Near the Abbey at <HI>Westminster</HI> is the Royal <HI>Free-school,</HI> founded by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; it is not out∣done even by those of <HI>Winchester</HI> and <HI>Eton,</HI> for the excellent Scholars it has produced, and is in a very flourishing Condition. Several good Houses, and even Streets, are lately built in its Neighbourhood.</P>
<P><HI>St. Paul's</HI> School, founded by Dr. <HI>Colet,</HI> Dean of <HI>St. Paul's,</HI> is a fair Foundation for 153 Boys, to be taught <HI>gratis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Merchant Taylors</HI> School was founded by Sir <HI>Thomas White,</HI> Founder of <HI>St. John's</HI> College, <HI>Oxon,</HI> for 100 Scholars to be taught <HI>gratis,</HI> 100 more for Half a Crown, and another 100 for Five Shillings a Quarter; and has 46 Fellowships established in <HI>St. John's</HI> College, for Scholars elected from this School.</P>
<P>Another excellent School was founded at <HI>Mercers-chapel,</HI> by that Company.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="145"/>To say nothing of upwards of 70 Charity Schools upheld by the benevolent Contributions of charitable Persons; also the Mathematical, and other Schools, at <HI>Christ's Hospital,</HI> which I have not room to be more particular in.</P>
<P>As to the LIBRARIES, I can only mention 'em likewise in a cursory manner. Those at <HI>Sion-college,</HI> the <HI>Temple,</HI> and other Inns of Court, <HI>Castle-yard,</HI> near the <HI>Meuse,</HI> the <HI>King's,</HI> &amp;c. deserve more par∣ticular Mention than we can give them. In <HI>Red∣cross-street,</HI> near <HI>Cripplegate,</HI> an handsome Building was erected, <HI>Ann.</HI> 1727, by the late Dr. <HI>Daniel Williams,</HI> a Dissenting Divine, for a publick Library for the Use of the Dissenting Ministers of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The valuable Collections, called the <HI>Cotton Library,</HI> is so well known, that we shall only mention the great Disaster that befel it in the Year 1730, when a Fire happened, not thro' Over-care, we may be sure, which burnt and defaced a great Number of valuable Manuscripts. But most happily it was dis∣covered and extinguished, before it made so great a Destruction as was at first apprehended. The learned Keeper of this inestimable Treasure, Dr. <HI>Bentley,</HI> Master of <HI>Trinity-college, Cambridge,</HI> whose Labours have done so much Honour to the Commonwealth of Learning, was the first, we are told, to express to some of his Friends, who came to condole with him the <HI>publick</HI> Loss, the great Joy he conceived that all his <HI>own Works</HI> had escaped the Ravages of that furious Element, which had been so little com∣plaisant to many curious Pieces of Antiquity. I would studiously avoid all ill-natur'd Insinuations; but wish, that with all the Excellencies which adorn this learned Man's Character, the Age in which he lives might be able to hand down his Fame to suc∣ceeding Times, free from that private Spirit and Narrowness of Mind, of which his Enemies accuse him. If he deserves not the Ill-will of such, he
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
has to comfort himself, that Envy always pursues true Merit, and so may make himself easy: If he does, we will venture to say, that 'tis a Pity that any Man's listing himself either on this or that Side, as to Party, should shield him from deserved Censure.</P>
<P>The inestimable Collections made by the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> the late Lord <HI>Sunderland,</HI> &amp;c. are rather private than publick, and so come not under our Notice.</P>

<HEAD>XIII. Of the Shipping in the <HI>Thames,</HI> and the Trade carry'd on by means of that noble River.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole River from <HI>London-bridge</HI> to <HI>Black-wall,</HI> is one great Arsenal: nothing in the World can be like it. The great Building-yards at <HI>Schedam</HI> near <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> are said to out-do them in the Number of Ships which are built there; and they tell us, that there are more Ships generally seen at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> than in the <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>I will not say, but that there may be more Vessels built at <HI>Schedam,</HI> and the Parts adjacent, than in the River <HI>Thames</HI>; but then it must be observed,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the <HI>English</HI> build for themselves princi∣pally, the <HI>Dutch</HI> for all the World,</P>
<P N="2">2. That almost all the Ships the <HI>Dutch</HI> have, are built there, whereas not one fifth Part of our Ship∣ping is built in the <HI>Thames</HI>; but abundance of Ships are built at the Sea-ports in <HI>England,</HI> such as, at <HI>Newcastle, Sunderland, Stockton, Whitby, Hull, Gainsborough, Grimsby, Lynn, Liverpole, Yarmouth, Alborough, Walderswick, Ipswich</HI> and <HI>Harwich,</HI> upon the East Coast; and at <HI>Shoreham, Arundel, Bright∣helmston, Portsmouth, Southampton, Pool, Weymouth, Dartmouth, Plymouth,</HI> besides other Places, on the South Coast.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="146" REF="147"/>3. That we see more Vessels in less Room at <HI>Amsterdam</HI>; but setting aside their Hoys, Bilanders, and Schouts, which are in great Numbers always there, being Vessels peculiar to their Inland and Coasting Navigation, you do not see more Ships, nor near so many Ships of Force at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> as at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>That Part of the River <HI>Thames</HI> which is properly the Harbour, and where the Ships usually deliver or unload their Cargoes, is called the <HI>Pool,</HI> and begins at the Turning of the River out of <HI>Limehouse Reach,</HI> and extends to the <HI>Custom-house</HI> Quays: In this Compass I have had the Curiosity to count the Ships as well as I could, <HI>en passant,</HI> and have found about 2000 Sail of all Sorts, not reckoning Barges, Lighters or Pleasure-boats, and Yachts; but of Vessels that really go to Sea.</P>
<P>It is true, the River or <HI>Pool</HI> seemed at that time to be pretty full of Ships; as also that I included the Ships which lay in <HI>Deptford</HI> and <HI>Blackwall</HI> Reaches, and in the Wet Docks; but then I did not include the Men of War at the King's-yard, and in the Wet Dock at <HI>Deptford,</HI> which were not a few.</P>
<P>In the River there are, from <HI>Battle-bridge,</HI> on the <HI>Southwark</HI> Side; and the <HI>Hermitage-bridge,</HI> on the City Side; reckoning to <HI>Blackwall,</HI> inclusive,
<LIST>
<ITEM>3 Wet Docks for laying up Merchant-ships.</ITEM>
<ITEM>22 Dry Docks for Repairing Merchant-ships.</ITEM>
<ITEM>33 Yards for Building Merchant-ships.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Including the Buildings of Lighters, Hoys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but excluding all Boat-builders, Wherry-builders, and above Bridge, Barge-builders.</P>
<P>To enter into any Description of the great Maga∣zines of all manner of Naval Stores, for the fur∣nishing those Builders, would be endless; 'tis suffi∣cient to add, That <HI>England</HI> is an inexhaustible Store-house of Timber; and all the Oak Timber, and ge∣nerally
<PB N="147" REF="148"/>
the Plank also, used in the Building these Ships, is found in <HI>England</HI> only; and that prin∣cipally in the Southern Counties near us; as parti∣cularly <HI>Berks, Bucks, Surrey, Kent, Sussex</HI> and <HI>Suffolk</HI>; and very little is brought farther.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="account">
<HEAD>XIV. Of the Manner by which the City is supply'd with Water.</HEAD>
<P>NO City in the World is so well furnished with Water as <HI>London,</HI> for their necessary Occasions there, as well as for the extinguishing of Fires, when they happen.</P>
<P N="1">1. By the great Convenience of Water, which be∣ing every-where laid in the Streets in large Timber Pipes, as well from the <HI>Thames</HI> as the <HI>New River,</HI> those Pipes are furnished with a Fire Plug, of which the Parish Officers have the Key; and when opened, let out not a Pipe, but, as one may say, a River of Water into the Streets; so that making but a Dam in the Chanel, the whole Street is im∣mediately under Water to supply the Engines.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the great Number of admirable Engines, of which almost every Parish has one, and some Halls also, and several private Citizens, have them of their own; so that no sooner does a Fire break out, but the House is surrounded with Engines, and a Flood of Water poured upon it, till it is extinguished.</P>
<P N="3">3. The several Insurance Offices, of which I have spoken in Article III. have each of them a certain Set of Men, whom they keep in constant Pay, and furnish with Tools proper for their Work, and to whom they give Jack Caps of Leather, able to keep them from Hurt, if Brick or Timber, or any thing not of too great a Bulk, should fall upon them. These Men, whom they call <HI>Firemen,</HI> make it their
<PB N="148" REF="149"/>
Business to be ready at Call, all Hours, to assist in case of Fire; and it must be acknowledged, they are very dexterous, bold, diligent and successful.</P>
<P>There are two great Engines for the raising the <HI>Thames</HI> Water, one at the Bridge, and the other near <HI>Broken-wharf</HI>; and these raise so great a Quan∣tity of Water, that 'tis said, they are able to supply every House throughout the whole City, with a running Pipe of Water up to the uppermost Story.</P>
<P>However, the <HI>New River,</HI> which is brought by an artificial Stream from <HI>Ware,</HI> continues to supply the greater Part of the City; and that with more Ease than the <HI>Thames</HI> Engines. Of this River I shall take farther Notice in my Description of <HI>Hertford∣shire,</HI> where it takes its Rise.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chelsea Water-works,</HI> as they are called, are also of no small Use for the new Buildings at that End of the Town; and a noble Cut, being a large, tho' not long River of itself, from the <HI>Thames</HI> to near <HI>Buckingham</HI> Garden-wall, and a great Reservoir of Water, in <HI>Hyde-park,</HI> produced by the same Undertaking, are no small Additions to the great Convenience we are speaking of, for the Parts which they respectively serve.</P>
<P>Formerly there were several beautiful Conduits in <HI>London,</HI> the Water of which was very sweet and good, and brought to them at a vast Expence from several distant Springs in large Leaden Pipes: some of these were rebuilt since the Fire; but now the City is so well supplied with Water, that they are either quite demolish'd, or intirely out of Use. That in <HI>Cheapside</HI> was pull'd down but very lately, and a Statue proposed to be built in its Place, in Honour to the great King <HI>William</HI> III. and it must be own'd, that it is one of the most commodious Places for such a Purpose in the whole City. But it being set on Foot, as some thought, by Party on one Side,
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>
was rejected, from far less laudable Motives, by Party on the other.</P>
<P>It is a well known Fact, that the bringing the <HI>New River</HI> to <HI>Islington,</HI> for the Benefit of the City, was the Ruin of the first Attempter Sir <HI>Hugh Middleton.</HI></P>
<P>The Society of the <HI>Temple</HI> neglected to lay in Water till the Year 1737, when a terrible Fire hap∣pening in it, which burnt down several Houses, and the <HI>Middle Temple</HI> Kitchen among the rest, that Society agreed with the <HI>New River Water</HI> Company, and there are nowfine Conveniencies built for that Purpose in every Court and open Place, which are only to be uncovered on occasion of such Accidents. This Fire happened <HI>Jan.</HI> 3. 1736-7, and in it was consumed one of the most valuable Collections of Antiquity in <HI>England,</HI> belonging to <HI>James West,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> except the <HI>Cotton</HI> and <HI>Harleian</HI> Library.</P>
<P>To sum up my Description of <HI>London,</HI> take the following Heads: There are in this great Mass of Buildings thus called <HI>London,</HI>

<HEAD>XV. Of the Christenings and Burials in <HI>London,</HI> &amp;c. Of the Importance of the City of <HI>London</HI> to the whole Kingdom. Of its comparative Pro∣portion to the Publick Expence of the Kingdom, and the disproportionate Number of Members it returns.</HEAD>
<P>LET us now mention something briefly in relation to the yearly Births and Burials of this extended Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y: from an Account of which Sir <HI>William Petty</HI> thought he might make some Calculations of the Numbers of the Inhabitants. And I shall only take Notice, that whereas the general Number of the Burials in the Year 1666, and farther back, were from 17000 to 19000 in a Year, the yearly Bill for the Year 1736, amounted as follows: <TABLE>

</TABLE></P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="152"/>Here is to be observed, that the Number of Burials exceeding so much the Number of Births, is, be∣cause as it is not the Number born, but the Number christened that are set down, which is taken from the Parish Register; so all the Children of Dissenters of every Sort, <HI>Protestant, Popish</HI> and <HI>Jewish,</HI> are omitted, also all the Children of Foreigners, <HI>French, Dutch,</HI> &amp;c. which are baptized in their own Churches, and all the Children of those who are so poor, that they cannot get them registered: so that if a due Estimate be made, the Births may be very well supposed to exceed the Burials, one Year with another, by many Thousands.</P>
<P><HI>London</HI> returns Four Members to Parliament, <HI>Westminster</HI> two; and these Six, with Two for the County of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> make the Eight, which is all that this exceeding populous County returns, altho' every single Ward in <HI>London</HI> is far superior to most of the Boroughs in <HI>England,</HI> and really to many of the greater Towns, that are represented by Two Members, and contributes infinitely more to the Publick Charge: and indeed one may ask, What are the greatest Part of the Boroughs of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and many in that of <HI>Devon,</HI> which Two Counties alone return 70 Members, compared to 20 populous Villages one might name in the Neighbourhood of <HI>London?</HI> Some of which, no doubt, would be con∣sider'd, were a new Repartition of this kind practi∣cable, and many of those peddling Boroughs be obliged to give up to them: a Scheme that must be set on foot under a very undesigning and honourable Administration, for Reasons too obvious to need particularizing.</P>
<P>The following Scheme, tho' calculated before the <HI>Union,</HI> and consequently before the 45 Members, which represent <HI>North Britain,</HI> were added to the 513, returned for <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> will set this Matter in a still clearer Light.</P>

<HEAD>XVI. The Benefit to the Publick of a good Under∣standing between the <HI>COURT</HI> and <HI>CITY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAVING shewn the Grandeur and Importance of this great Metropolis, it remains only to ob∣serve, How necessary it is for the Good of the whole
<PB N="153" REF="154"/>
Kingdom, that there should be a right Understanding cultivated between the Administration and that, For,</P>
<P>There has formerly been a great Emulation between the <HI>Court-end</HI> of the Town, and the <HI>City</HI>; and it was seriously proposed in a certain Reign, how the <HI>Court</HI> should humble the <HI>City:</HI> nor was it an im∣practicable Thing at that time, had the pernicious Scheme been carry'd on. Indeed it was carried fur∣ther than consisted with the Prudence of a good Government, or of a wise People: for the <HI>Court</HI> envy'd the <HI>City's</HI> Riches, and the Citizens were ever jealous of the <HI>Court's</HI> Designs. The most fatal Steps the <HI>Court</HI> took at that Time to humble the City, were, 1. The shutting up the <HI>Exchequer:</HI> And, 2. The bringing a <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> against their Charter. But these Things can but be touch'd at here. The <HI>City</HI> has outliv'd it all, and both the At∣tempts turned to the Discredit of the Party who pushed them on. The <HI>City</HI> is indeed, and at all times must be, so necessary to the <HI>Court,</HI> that no prudent Administration will ever seek Occasions for Misunderstandings with it: but will, if not infatu∣ated, do all in its Power to incourage and increase the Opulence of the <HI>City,</HI> which upon any Emer∣gency will be able and willing, if not disobliged, to support the <HI>Court,</HI> and furnish Means to protect the Kingdom, against either Foreign or Domestick Enemies.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. CONTAINING A Description of Part of <HI>Middlesex</HI>; and of the whole County of <HI>Hertford.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Villages round <HI>London</HI> partake of the Influence of <HI>London,</HI> as I have taken Notice in the Counties of <HI>Es∣sex, Kent,</HI> and <HI>Surrey.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hackney</HI> and <HI>Bromley</HI> are the first Villages which begin the County of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> East: for <HI>Bow,</HI> as reckon'd to <HI>Stepney,</HI> is a Part of the great Mass. This Town of <HI>Hackney</HI> is of great Extent, containing no less than Twelve Hamlets or separate Villages, tho' some of them now join, <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Church-street,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Homerton,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Wyck-house,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Grove-street,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Clapton,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Mare-street,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Well-street,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Cambridge-heath,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Shaklewell,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Dalstone,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Kingsland,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Newington.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>All these, though some of them are very large Villages, make up but one Parish, and are within a few Years so increased in Buildings, and so well in∣habited, that there is no Comparison to be made
<PB N="155" REF="156"/>
between their present and former State; every sepa∣rate Hamlet being increased, and some of them more than trebly bigger than formerly they were.</P>
<P><HI>Hackney</HI> is so remarkable for the Retreat of wealthy Citizens, that there are at this time near an Hundred Coaches kept in it.</P>
<P><HI>Newington, Tottenham, Edmonton,</HI> and <HI>Enfield,</HI> stand all in a Line North from the City. The Increase of Buildings is so great in them all, that they seem to a Traveller to be one continu'd Street; especially <HI>Tottenham</HI> and <HI>Edmonton</HI>; and in them all, the new Buildings so far exceed the old, especially in their Value, and the Figure of the Inhabitants, that the Fashion of the Town is quite altered.</P>
<P>At <HI>Tottenham</HI> we see the Remains of an antient Building call'd the <HI>Cross,</HI> from which the Town takes the Name of <HI>High-Cross.</HI> Here is a small, but pleasant Seat of the Earl of <HI>Colerain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Highgate</HI> and <HI>Hamstead</HI> are next on the North-side. At the first is a very beautiful House built by the late Sir <HI>William Ashurst,</HI> on the very Summit of the Hill, and with a View from the very lowest Windows over the whole Vale, to the City: and that so eminently, that they see the Ships passing up and down the River, for Twelve or Fifteen Miles below <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>As the County does not extend far this way, I take no notice of smaller Towns; nor is there any thing of Note but Citizens Houses for several Miles; except the Chace, at <HI>Enfield,</HI> which was a very beau∣tiful Place, when King <HI>James</HI> I. resided at <HI>Theobalds,</HI> for the Pleasure of his Hunting; and was then very full of Deer, and all sorts of Game; but it has suf∣fered several Depredations since that, and particu∣larly in the Times of Usurpation, when it was stript both of Game and Timber, and let out in Farms to Tenants for the Use of the Publick.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="157"/>After the Restoration it was laid open again; Woods and Groves were every-where planted, and the whole Chace stored with Deer: but it is not, nor perhaps ever will be, what it was.</P>
<P><HI>Hampstead</HI> is risen from a little Village, almost to a City; nor could the uneven Surface, inconvenient for Building, check the Humour of the Builders; for even on the very Steep of the Hill, where there's no walking Twenty Yards together, without tug∣ing up, or straddling down a Hill, the Buildings are increased to that Degree, that the Town almost spreads the whole Side of the Hill.</P>
<P>The Heath extends about a Mile every way, and affords a most beautiful Prospect; for we see here <HI>Hanslop Steeple</HI> one way, which is within Eight Miles of <HI>Northampton,</HI> N. W. to <HI>Landown-hill</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> another way East, at least Sixty-six Miles from one another. The Prospect to <HI>London,</HI> and beyond it to <HI>Banstead-downs,</HI> South; <HI>Shooters-hill,</HI> South-east; <HI>Red-hill,</HI> South-west, and <HI>Windsor-Castle,</HI> West, is also uninterrupted. Indeed, due North, we see no farther than to <HI>Barnet,</HI> which is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ove Six Miles from it.</P>
<P>At the Foot of this Hill is an old Seat of the Earls of <HI>Chesterfield,</HI> called <HI>Bel-size</HI>; which for many Years had been neglected: but being tenanted by a certain <HI>Projector,</HI> who knew by what Handle to take the gay Part of the World, he made it a House of Pleasure and Entertainment: this brought a wonder∣ful Concourse of People to the Place; and they were effectually gratified in all Sorts of Diversion; but there being too great a Licence used, it alarm'd the Magistrates, and now the House is hastening apace to Ruin.</P>
<P>Besides the Long Room at <HI>Hampstead,</HI> in which the Company meet publickly on a <HI>Monday</HI> Evening to play at Cards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Mr. <HI>Vipand,</HI> the Master of that, built in the Year 1735, a fine Assembly-room,
<PB N="157" REF="158"/>
Sixty Feet long, and Thirty wide, elegantly deco∣rated; every one who does not subscribe, pays half a Crown for Admittance. Every Gentleman who subscribes a Guinea for the Season, has a Ticket for himself, and for Two Ladies. Gentlemen and La∣dies, who lodge in the Town, are entertain'd every <HI>Sunday</HI> for 6<HI>d.</HI> each, with Tea and Coffee; but no other Amusements.</P>
<P>I could not be at <HI>Hamstead</HI> without making an Excursion to <HI>Edgworth,</HI> a little Market-town, on the Road to <HI>St. Albans</HI>; for 'tis certain, that this was formerly the main Road from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s, being the famous high Road, call'd <HI>Wat∣ling-street,</HI> which reached from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Shrews∣bury,</HI> and on towards <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>Near this Town, the Duke of <HI>Chandos</HI> has built one of the most magnificent Palaces in <HI>England,</HI> with a Profusion of Expence, and so well furnish'd within, that it has hardly its Equal in <HI>England.</HI> The Plaistering and Gilding are done by the famous <HI>Pargotti,</HI> an <HI>Italian.</HI> The great <HI>Salon</HI> or <HI>Hall</HI> is painted by <HI>Paolucci.</HI> The Pillars supporting the Building are all of Marble: the great Stair-case is extremely fine; and the Steps are all of Marble, every Step being of one whole Piece, about Twenty-two Feet in Length.</P>
<P>The Avenue is spacious and majestick, and as it gives you the View of Two Fronts, join'd, as it were, in one, the Distance not admitting you to see the Angle, which is in the Centre; so you are agreeably drawn in, to think the Front of the House almost twice as large as it is.</P>
<P>And yet, when you come nearer, you are again surprised, by seeing the winding Passage opening, as it were, a new Front to the Eye, of near 120 Feet wide, which you had not seen before; so that you are lost a while in looking near hand for what you so evidently saw a great way off.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="159"/>The Gardens are well designed, and have a vast Variety, and the Canals are very large and noble.</P>
<P>The Chapel is a Singularity, both in its Building, and the Beauty of its Workmanship; and the Duke used to maintain there a full Choir, and had the Worship perform'd with the best Musick, after the manner of the Chapel Royal.</P>
<P>Two Miles from hence, we go up a smaller Ascent by the great Road; when leaving the Street Way on the Right, we enter a spacious Common called <HI>Bushy-heath,</HI> where again we have a very agreeable Prospect. On the Right-hand, we have in View the Town of <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s; and all the Spaces between, and further beyond it, look like a Garden. The inclosed Corn-fields make one grand Parterre: the thick-planted Hedge-rows seem like a Wilderness or Labyrinth; the Villages interspers'd, look like so many several noble Seats of Gentlemen at a Di∣stance. In a Word, it is all Nature, and yet looks like Art. On the Left-hand we see the West-end of <HI>London, Westminster Abbey,</HI> and the Parliament-House; but the Body of the City is cut off by the Hill, at which <HI>Hampstead</HI> intercepted the Sight on that Side. More to the South we have <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> and S. W. <HI>Windsor,</HI> and between both, those beautiful Parts of <HI>Middlesex</HI> and <HI>Surrey,</HI> on the Bank of the <HI>Thames,</HI> which are the most agreeable in the World. But I must travel no farther this Way, till I have taken a Journey West from <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and seen what the Country affords that Way.</P>
<P>The next Towns adjacent to <HI>London,</HI> are <HI>Ken∣sington, Chelsea, Hamersmith, Fulham, Brentford, Twickenham,</HI> &amp;c. all of them near, or adjoining to the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and which, by the Beauty of their Buildings, make good the North Shore of the River, answerable to what I have already describ'd.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="160"/>But here I ought not to omit mentioning the new Bridge from <HI>Fulham</HI> to <HI>Putney,</HI> cross the <HI>Thames,</HI> which is a handsome wooden Fabrick, and as con∣venient, by its many angular Indentings, for Foot-passengers, as for Horses and Coaches. A Toll is paid for every one that passes it, let it be ever so often in a Day; and the Rate pretty much the same as the Ferry used to be. And as the Proprietors are said to divide 10 or 12<HI>l. per Cent.</HI> from the Profits of it, 'tis pity, methinks, that Foot-passengers, who cannot wear the Bridge, should pay at all.</P>
<P><HI>Kensington</HI> cannot be nam'd without mentioning the King's Palace there: it was originally an old House of the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI>'s, of whom the late King <HI>William</HI> bought it, and then inlarg'd it as we see; some of the old Building still remaining in the Centre of the House.</P>
<P>The House itself fronts to the Garden Three Ways, the Gardens being now made exceeding fine, and inlarged to such a Degree, as to reach quite from the great Road in <HI>Kensington</HI> Town, to the <HI>Action</HI> Road North, more than a Mile, besides a great Track of Ground out of <HI>Hyde-Park.</HI> An artificial Mount is also erected, which affords a fine View, is planted with Ever-greens, and has a Seat upon it, which turns round with great Ease at Pleasure. The noble River that is lately dug in <HI>Hyde-Park,</HI> affords a fine View from these beautiful Gardens. The first laying out of these Gardens was the Design of the late Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> who finding the Air agreed with the King, resolved to make it agreeable to herself too, and gave the first Orders for inlarging them.</P>
<P>The late Queen <HI>Anne</HI> improv'd what Queen <HI>Mary</HI> began, and delighted very much in the Place; and often was pleased to make the Green-house, which is very beautiful, her Summer Supper-house.</P>
<P>And her late Majesty Queen <HI>Caroline</HI> completed the Whole, by the Additions just now mention'd.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="161"/>King <HI>William,</HI> Prince <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> dy'd here.</P>
<P>As this Palace opens to the West, there are Two great Wings built, for receiving such as necessari∣ly attend the Court, and a large Port-cocher at the Entrance, with a Postern, and a Stone Gallery, on the South-side of the Court, which leads to the great Stair-case.</P>
<P>It is no Wonder, the Court being so much at <HI>Ken∣sington,</HI> that the Town has increased in Buildings; and indeed it abounds with handsome Houses, and has a very pretty Square.</P>
<P>South of this Town stands <HI>Chelsea,</HI> at which Place is the noblest Building, and one of the best Foundations of its kind in the World, for maimed and old Soldiers, built by Sir <HI>Christopher Wren.</HI></P>
<P>Here also are the Physick-gardens belonging to the Company of <HI>Apothecaries</HI> of <HI>London.</HI> In it is lately built a stately and convenient Edifice, which serves at the same time for a Green-house, and Apart∣ments over it for meeting of the Company of <HI>Apo∣thecaries,</HI> &amp;c. and over them are very convenient Apartments, which may be used for drying Seeds of Plants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As this Ground was made a Present by Sir <HI>Hans Sloane,</HI> they have erected in the new Building, a Statue of that Gentleman; and intend to make, in due Time, an Opening down to the River, which will have a beautiful Effect upon the <HI>Thames,</HI> and receive no less Grace from it. On the Pedestal of this Statue is an Inscription expressing the Company's Gratitude to Sir <HI>Hans.</HI></P>
<P>Near the Royal Hospital was, till very lately, a neat and beautiful House and Gardens built by the late Earl of <HI>Ranelagh</HI>; but they are now quite de∣stroyed, being sold out in Parcels to Builders, and other Purchasers.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert Walpole</HI> has a fine House here, and good Gardens, adjoining to the Hospital, adorn'd with noble Pictures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162"/>In short there is an incredible Number of fine Houses built in all these Towns within these few Years, which in other Places would pass, in a man∣ner, for Palaces; and most of the Possessors whereof keep Coaches.</P>
<P>Among these are the late Lord <HI>Peterborough</HI>'s at <HI>Parsons-Green</HI>; Lord <HI>Halifax</HI>'s at <HI>Bushy-Park</HI>; Earl of <HI>Bradford</HI>'s, Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI>'s, Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI>'s, Earl of <HI>Burlington</HI>'s, <HI>Sutton-Court Chiswick,</HI> Mr. <HI>Barker</HI>'s, Lord <HI>Wilmington</HI>'s, Gene∣ral <HI>Whetham</HI>'s, <HI>Holland-House,</HI> near <HI>Kensington,</HI> situated on a fine Eminence, and which now is taken by the Lord <HI>Bruce,</HI> who is making it once more a delightful Habitation; the late Secretary <HI>Johnson</HI>'s, at <HI>Twickenham,</HI> and Multitudes of others.</P>
<P>But I must not pass over so slightly the noble Seat of the Right Hon. the Earl of <HI>Burlington,</HI> at <HI>Chis∣wick</HI>; and yet I can only mention cursorily some of its Beauties: as the River his Lordship has dug in his Gardens, a very fine one indeed; from the Earth of which he has formed a noble Mount next the Road, or rather a Terrace, from which the whole Country may be viewed, and which serves at the same time, for a Defence to his Gardens on that Side, and is planted to the Road with all manner of sweet Shrubs, Roses, Honeysuckles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that yield in the Season a delightful Fragrance, as well to the Passengers as to those on the Terrace; the magnificent Buildings in Imitation of antient Temples, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> interspersed in the Gardens; the beautiful Bridge over the River in it; the fine Walks; the unbounded Prospects; seve∣ral curious Statues, a noble Obelisk, delicate Vistas, and the sumptuous Buildings adjoining to the old House, commanding a fine View to the River; which, with the Pictures and valuable Curiosities withinside, altogether exceed Description.</P>
<P>In the Village of <HI>Hamersmith,</HI> which was former∣ly a long scattering Place, full of Gardeners Grounds,
<PB N="162" REF="163"/>
with here and there an old House of some Bulk, we see now great Numbers of fine Houses, and a continued Range of a great Length, which makes the main Street.</P>
<P>I have now travers'd the best Part of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> a County made rich, pleasant and populous, by the Neighbourhood of <HI>London.</HI> The Borders of the County have Three Market-towns, <HI>Stanes, Colbrook</HI> and <HI>Uxbridge:</HI> this last is a pleasant large Town, full of good Inns, as the others are, and famous, in particular, for having abundance of fine Seats of Gentlemen, and Persons of Quality, in the Neigh∣bourhood; and also for a vain Attempt made in the great Civil War, to settle the Peace of these Na∣tions by a Treaty here. I should never have done, were I to pretend to describe, tho' ever so slightly, the large Towns on both Sides the River; as

<ITEM><HI>Ealing,</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
where a new Church is just finish'd; and others all crouded and surrounded with fine Houses, or rather Palaces, of the Nobility, Quality and Gentry of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There are but Three more Market-towns in the County, <HI>viz. Brentford,</HI> the County-town, <HI>Edg∣worth,</HI> and <HI>Enfield.</HI></P>
<P>And now I enter the County of <HI>Hertford,</HI> a fruitful Soil, as it is managed; for 'tis certain, it is more indebted, for its Fertility, to the Sagacity and Industry of the Husbandman, than to Nature. Rich Meadows are seldom found here; for it affords not any large Rivers: the Arable hath generally too much Gravel, or too much Clay; but these last cold
<PB N="163" REF="164"/>
and wet Lands have been within these Forty Years greatly improv'd by draining off the Rain-water, which stagnated on the clayey Surface, as in a Cup, and chilled the Roots of the Corn; an Invention, called <HI>Bush-draining.</HI></P>
<P>The County is well-water'd for the Conveniency of the Inhabitants; tho' the <HI>Lea</HI> is the only navigable Stream in it, which has its Rise in <HI>Bedfordshire</HI>; of which more anon. But this County assumes the Honour of giving Rise unto several Rivers, <HI>viz.</HI> the Parish of <HI>Tring</HI> to the <HI>Thames,</HI> which leaving the County at <HI>Putenham,</HI> goes by <HI>Ayleshury</HI> to <HI>Thame,</HI> and thence by <HI>Wheatley-bridge</HI> to <HI>Dorchester,</HI> and falls into the <HI>Isis.</HI></P>
<P>The County may be divided into Three Parts pretty equal, by Two great Roads, one Part lying between the North Road, which goes thro' <HI>Hert∣ford</HI> to <HI>Nottingham,</HI> &amp;c. and the Borders of <HI>Cam∣bridgeshire</HI> North, and those of <HI>Essex</HI> East. Another Part lying between that Road and the other, which leads thro' <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s to <HI>Coventry</HI> and <HI>Chester</HI>; and the third lying between this last Road, and the Bor∣ders of <HI>Middlesex</HI> South, and those of <HI>Bucks</HI> West.</P>
<P>I shall begin with the last at <HI>East-Barnet,</HI> a Thoroughfare-town of Note, and well supplied with Inns: it lies high and pleasant, and was formerly frequented for its medicinal Waters, and now for its Swine-market. It has in its Neighbourhood several very handsome Houses of the <HI>Londoners,</HI> and which are the more pleasant by being so near the Chace.</P>
<P><HI>Totteridge</HI> is near it also, and is a very pleasant Village. It is situated on a fine Eminence looking to the North, over the <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s Road into the Forest; and on the South over the <HI>Edgware</HI> Road, to <HI>Har∣row,</HI> &amp;c. It is very clean, and has several very good Houses in it. The Road from <HI>Hampstead</HI> here is extremely pleasant, and so well repaired, that in the worst Season there is scarce any Water or Dirt
<PB N="164" REF="165"/>
remaining in it; and as it lies not on any great Road, there are no heavy Carriages passing that Way; therefore a small Expence annually, well laid out, will always keep this Road in excellent Repair.</P>
<P><HI>Cheaping-Barnet</HI> lies a little North, in the <HI>St. Al∣ban</HI>'s Road, and is remarkable for the decisive Battle fought there on <HI>Easter-day</HI> 1468, between the Houses of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> in which the great Earl of <HI>War∣wick,</HI> styled <HI>Make-king,</HI> was killed, with many of the prime Nobility, and 10,000 Men. The Place sup∣posed to be the Field of Battle, is a green Spot near <HI>Kicks-End,</HI> between <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s and <HI>Hatfield</HI> Roads, a little before they meet. The Manor is in the Property of the Duke of <HI>Chandois.</HI> A handsome Row of Six Alms-houses, for so many Widows, founded by <HI>James Ravenscroft,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in 1672, with a little Furniture to each, is in the Street. Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> built a Free School-house of Brick in the same Street, where Nine Children are taught <HI>gratis,</HI> and all other Boys at Five Shillings the Quarter.</P>
<P>About Two Miles N. W. from hence, on the Left-hand, lies <HI>Durhams,</HI> formerly the Seat of the <HI>Austins,</HI> but is now the Property of the Earl of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> who purchased it of Sir <HI>John Austin,</HI> and has since greatly beautified the Seat, by laying most of the neighbouring Fields belonging to the Estate, into a Park, and turning and repairing of the Roads. The House stands on an Eminence, situated in a small Valley, surrounded with pretty high Hills at a little Distance, so that in the Summer Months it is an agreeable Retirement: but the Soil all round it being a strong Clay, all the Rain which falls in Win∣ter being detained on the Surface, renders the Situa∣tion very cold and moist. Add to this the Want of good Water, and Timber near the House, (except the young Trees which have been planted by his Lordship) and upon the Whole it cannot be esteemed a good Seat.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="166"/><HI>Idlestrey</HI> or <HI>Elstre</HI> is a Village on the <HI>Roman Wat∣ling-street,</HI> on the very Edge of <HI>Middlesex</HI>; but it is chiefly noted for its Situation, near <HI>Brockly-Hill,</HI> by <HI>Stanmore,</HI> which affords a lovely View cross <HI>Middlesex,</HI> over the <HI>Thames,</HI> into <HI>Surrey.</HI> Near this is <HI>Kendale</HI> Wood, where formerly was found an old Flint Wall, so hard as not to yield to the Strokes of the Pick-ax; as likewise an Oven. Mr. <HI>Philpot</HI> digging his Canal and Foundations for his Buildings, upon the Spot of the old City, <HI>Suellaniacis,</HI> found many Coins, Urns, and other Antiquities. They have a Proverb here, relating to the Antiquities:
<Q><L><HI>No Heart can think, nor Tongue can tell,</HI></L>
<L><HI>What lies 'tween</HI> Brockley-Hill <HI>and</HI> Pennywel.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Pennywel</HI> is a Parcel of Closes across the Valley beyond <HI>Brockley-Hill,</HI> where Foundations are dis∣cernible, and where, they say, has been a City.</P>
<P>About Two Miles further West lies <HI>Watford,</HI> a Market-town, Seventeen Miles from <HI>London,</HI> upon the <HI>Colne,</HI> where it hath Two Streams, which run separately to <HI>Rickmersworth.</HI> Several Alms-houses belong to this Town, and an handsome Free-school, built in 1704, and finish'd 1709, by <HI>Elizabeth Fuller,</HI> Widow; and in the Church are several handsome Monuments. The Town is very long, having but one Street, which is the publick, and so is extreme∣ly dirty in Winter; and the Waters of the River, at the Entrance of the Town, are often so much swelled by Floods, as to be unpassable; and the Bridge designed as the Road at such times, is so much out of Repair, that it is very dangerous for any Carriages of Burthen to pass over it; which is a very great Disadvantage to the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Cassioberry,</HI> the Seat of the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> is the next thing that occurs worth notice, and is elegant. The Situation is the best in the County, upon a dry Spot, within a Park of a large Extent: the
<PB N="166" REF="167"/>
House is built in Form of an H: the Middle and the East Wing is modern, and in good Repair; but the West Wing is very old, and by no means cor∣responding with the other Parts of the House. The Front faces the South-east, and looks directly on the House in <HI>Moore-Park,</HI> on which the late Mr. <HI>Stiles</HI> expended such great Sums of Money, and which has a noble Look from <HI>Cassioberry</HI> House. In the Front of the House is a fine dry Lawn of Grass, which immediately after the heaviest Winter Rains may be rode or walked on, as on the driest Downs; and a little below the House is a River, which winds through the Park, and in the driest Seasons constantly runs with a fine Stream, affording great Plenty of Trout, Cray-fish, and indeed most other kinds of fresh-water Fish. On the North and East Sides of the House are large Wood-walks, which were planted by the famous <HI>Le Notre,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II. The Woods have many large Beech and Oak-trees in them; but the principal Walks are planted with Lime-trees, and these are most of them too narrow for their Length, and too regular for the modern Taste. On the other Side of the River, the Ground rises to a considerable Height, which affords an agreeable Variety; part of which being covered with stately Woods, appearing at a proper Distance from the Front of the House, have a fine Effect to the Eye. In short, the whole Spot (if a small Expence was bestow'd to improve and put it more in the modern Taste) would be one of the finest Places near <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Near <HI>Cassioberry</HI> is a pleasant Seat, purchased by the late Lord <HI>Raymond,</HI> called <HI>Langleybury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rickmersworth</HI> is a Market-town, within Three or Four Miles West of <HI>Watford.</HI> It gave Birth to Sir <HI>Thomas White,</HI> Merchant-Taylor of <HI>London,</HI> who founded <HI>Gloucester</HI> Hall, and <HI>St. John</HI>'s Col∣lege
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>
in <HI>Oxford.</HI> Here are Two Alms-houses, one for Four, the other for Five Widows.</P>
<P>We visited in this Neighbourhood <HI>More-Park,</HI> with a fine House in it, of the late Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI> standing upon the Side of the Hill, facing <HI>Cassioberry,</HI> on the other Side the River. It has been allowed one of the best Pieces of Brick-work in <HI>England.</HI> Sir <HI>William Temple</HI> commends the Garden as one of the best laid-out in <HI>England.</HI> The Duchess of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> on whom it was settled by Marriage, sold it in 1720, to <HI>Benjamin-Heskins Stiles,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who has made it a magnificent Edifice, having built a South Front of Stone with Colon∣nades, by which an Opening is made thro' the Hill that once obstructed its View toward <HI>Uxbridge.</HI> A North Front is also erected, and the Hill towards <HI>Watford</HI> cut thro' for a Vista. The Inside of the House is also adorned with admirable Work of Paint∣ing. In digging this Hill, Veins of Sea-sand with Muscles in it were found.</P>
<P><HI>Abbots-Langley,</HI> Twenty-two Miles from <HI>London,</HI> situated about Three Miles North of <HI>Cassioberry,</HI> in a good Air and Soil, is remarkable for the Birth of an <HI>English</HI> Pope, <HI>Nicolas Brakespear,</HI> by the Title of <HI>Adrian</HI> IV. The Emperor <HI>Frederick</HI> held his Stirrup, while he dismounted. He was choaked, as some say, by a Fish, and, as others, by a Quinsy: but it is an indelible Stain on his Memory, that, when sovereign Pontiff, he suffer'd his Mother to be main∣tain'd by the Alms of the Church of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>We proceeded to <HI>Kings-Langley,</HI> so called, be∣cause <HI>Henry</HI> III. built himself a Royal House here, of which the Ruins still exist: and here was born and buried <HI>Edmund de Langley,</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> Fifth Son of <HI>Edward</HI> III. and his Wife <HI>Isabel,</HI> youngest Daughter of Don <HI>Pedro,</HI> King of <HI>Castile,</HI> was also buried here, and the Tomb is in the Church of this Place.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="169"/>We next went to <HI>Hempsted,</HI> a little further North, and about Twenty-three Miles from <HI>London,</HI> a Baili∣wick Corporate Town. It has the greatest Corn-market in the County, or perhaps in <HI>England</HI>; in which 20,000<HI>l.</HI> a Week are frequently returned for Meal only. Eleven Pair of Mills stand within Four Miles of the Place, which bring a great Trade to it: but the Road is by this means so continually torn, that it is one of the worst Turnpikes round about <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>A little North of <HI>Hempsted</HI> we turn'd West, and came to <HI>Great Barkhamsted,</HI> about Twenty-four computed Miles from <HI>London.</HI> It is a very antient Town, which for many Hundred of Years has been one of the Crown Manors, which granted to it many very ample Privileges. It is now annexed to the Dukedom of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and as such appro∣priated to the Princes of <HI>Wales.</HI> The Castle and Manor are at present held by Lease from the Prince, by <HI>Edward Carey,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> which was obtained by his Ancestors of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Barkhamsted</HI> has evidently been a <HI>Roman</HI> Town, by the Name of <HI>Durobrivae</HI>; and probably the Castle stands upon a <HI>Roman</HI> Foundation. <HI>Roman</HI> Coins are frequently dug up there. It is most plea∣santly inviron'd with high and hard Ground, full of Hedge-rows, Pastures, and Arable, tho' situated upon a South-side of a Marsh. It extends itself far in handsome Buildings, and a broad Street In the Time of the Heptarchy it was the Residence of the Kings of <HI>Mercia</HI>; and here <HI>Wightred</HI> King of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Mercia,</HI> in the Year 69, held a Parliament: here also King <HI>Ina</HI>'s Laws were publish'd.</P>
<P>The Castle was judiciously set on the North-side of the Town, on dry Ground, amongst Springs, and made exceedingly strong by the <HI>Saxons.</HI> It was rebuilt by <HI>Moreton,</HI> Earl of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> Brother to <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> and razed for Rebellion in his
<PB N="169" REF="170"/>
Son's Time, and so with the Manor fell to the Crown. <HI>Henry</HI> II. kept his Court here, and granted great Privileges to the Place. The Castle was after∣wards rebuilt, as it is thought, in the Reign of King <HI>John,</HI> for the <HI>Dauphin</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> in Conjunction with the Barons, besieg'd it, and the Defendants surrender'd not till they had the King's Orders for it.</P>
<P>When the Castle was demolish'd, a large House was built out of its Ruins, which is beautifully situated. What now remains of it is but the third Part, and the Back of the great House; for the other two Thirds were destroyed by Fire in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> I. It was in King <HI>James</HI>'s Time a Nursery for that Prince's Children; and Prince <HI>Henry</HI> and Prince <HI>Charles</HI> were bred up there; and in the Time of the late Troubles, Colonel <HI>Axtel,</HI> a Parliament Officer, held it. It is now in the Pos∣session of the <HI>Roper</HI> Family.</P>
<P>The Corporation sunk in the War between the King and Parliament. In King <HI>Charles</HI> II.'s Time an Attempt was made to revive the Charter; but it was dropt. This Body Politick is now reduced to a Skeleton, like the Castle, which is only to be known by its Moats and Walls.</P>
<P>The Castle contains within its first Moat, Four or Five Acres. There is again a Division by another Moat. The South Part, consisting of about Two Acres, is upon a Level with most of the outward Walls and Chimneys remaining. Towards the North, across a Moat, is a high Hill or Keep, capable of defending itself against the former, if possessed by an Enemy. The Traces of the Bridge of Com∣munication, and the Moat dividing these Two Places of Strength, are continued to the grand one, that takes in the whole Scite of the Fortification. The Remains of the Bridge for Entrance from the Town,
<PB N="170" REF="171"/>
are visible, answering exactly to the other, as the North of the first Area, which led to the Hills.</P>
<P>In this Town was the famous Interview between <HI>William the Conqueror</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> Nobility, in his March towards <HI>London,</HI> after his Victory over <HI>Harold.</HI> He passed the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Wallingford,</HI> and was going forward to <HI>St. Albans,</HI> when the stout Abbot <HI>Frederick</HI> stopp'd his March by Trees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> till he could get the <HI>English</HI> Nobility together, and then he made him swear to keep inviolably the good and antient Laws of the Kingdom; yet he took away all their Lands, and divided them among his hungry <HI>Normans.</HI></P>
<P>This Town gives Name to the Deanry. The Church is handsome, dedicated to St. <HI>Peter</HI>; it has had many Chapels and Oratories. On the Pillars of the Church are the Eleven Apostles, with each of them a Sentence of the Creed, and St. <HI>George</HI> killing a Dragon, on the Twelfth. These were whited over by the Zeal of the late Times, and are but lately come to Light.</P>
<P>The Chapel of <HI>St. John</HI> is used only by the Ma∣ster, Ushers and Scholars of the Free-School. <HI>St. Leonard</HI>'s Hospital was at the South-east End of the High-street, and <HI>St. James</HI>'s Hospital at the other End. The Free Grammar-School was built by Dean <HI>Incent,</HI> of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s. It is a handsome Brick Structure, with an Apartment at one End for the Master, at the other for the Usher and Chantry-Clerk. It was Twenty Years in Building.</P>
<P>They have had other large Benefactions, which we have not room for.</P>
<P><HI>Tring,</HI> being Twenty-eight computed Miles from <HI>London,</HI> is a small Market-town, stands upon the Extremity of <HI>Hertfordshire,</HI> next to <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> East of and near the <HI>Ikening-street.</HI></P>
<P>It is very antient, and was formerly a Royal Manor; but now possessed by <HI>William Gore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
<PB N="171" REF="172"/>
who has made a Park of 300 Acres, of which Part is on the <HI>Chiltern.</HI> In it is a beautiful Wood in∣closed, lying close to the <HI>Ikening-street.</HI> Mr. <HI>Gore</HI> has beautified and wainscotted the Church in a most elegant Manner, and gives 20<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> for a Cha∣rity-School. The Church is a handsome Pile of Building, with a Ring of Six Bells. The Chancel was wainscotted by Sir <HI>Richard Anderson.</HI> It is de∣cent and capacious, and worthy a Choir. Both Church and Chancel are paved with Free-Stone; the Pillars are painted; the Pulpit and sounding Board are of fine Inlaid-work; and a handsome Vestry is under the Belfry.</P>
<P>Among other Monuments is a magnificent one for Sir <HI>William Gore</HI> and his Lady; with Inscri∣ptions to their Honour, but too long for a Place here.</P>
<P>From <HI>Tring</HI> I passed next Eastward, and came to <HI>Gadesden-Little</HI>; where I had heard was a fine Prospect; and I wanted not Curiosity to see it. This Vill has <HI>Cawley-Wood,</HI> and <HI>Ivingo-Hills</HI> on the North-west, <HI>Aldbury-Cliffs</HI> on the South-west, <HI>Dunstable-Downs</HI> to the North. The Prospect I mean is from one Part of this Parish, to which a Common of fine Turf leads under the Duke of <HI>Bridgwater</HI>'s shady Park; and a noble one it is of Three Counties, worthy of the Pencil of the greatest Artist in Landschape.</P>
<P>The Variety of Woods, Cliffs, Arable and Pa∣sture, are charming; but they must be tempted to half a Mile's pleasant Exercise to get to the beautiful Scene.</P>
<P><HI>Cawley-Wood</HI> belonging to the Duke of <HI>Leeds,</HI> is a small Covert, a Mile from hence, at the Top of a Hill, in <HI>Bucks,</HI> one of the greatest Land-marks in the South of <HI>England,</HI> which overlooks Eleven Counties. It stands as a Monument to shew, not∣withstanding
<PB N="172" REF="173"/>
all the modern Improvements, that Nature will not be out-done by Art.</P>
<P>Now I am on this Subject, I shall just mention <HI>Penley-lodge,</HI> for a most delightful Retirement to a Man who wants to deceive Life, in an Habitation which has all the Charms Nature can give. There is behind a large Common of fine Turf, bounded on a Wood on the West, to which if one ascend a Quarter of a Mile, he has a View of <HI>Northampton∣shire</HI> and <HI>Warwickshire.</HI> From the House a Semi∣circular Prospect of <HI>Bedfordshire, Middlesex,</HI> and <HI>Bucks</HI>; a bended one towards <HI>Ivingo</HI> and <HI>Aldbury-Cliffs,</HI> with the shady Woods of the Dukes of <HI>Leeds</HI> and <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> seeming to hang over the Rivulet called <HI>Bulborn.</HI></P>
<P>The Manor of <HI>Aldbury</HI> lies North-east of <HI>Tring,</HI> and in the Way to <HI>Gadesden.</HI> It belongs to the Duke of <HI>Leeds,</HI> whose Father married the Heiress of the Family of <HI>Hyde</HI>; and so does <HI>Muniborough-Hill</HI> lie in the Way from <HI>Aldbury</HI> to <HI>Little-Gadesden,</HI> and affords a handsome Prospect.</P>
<P><HI>Ashridge</HI> stands near <HI>Aldbury,</HI> but in <HI>Bucks,</HI> an antient Mansion-house and fine Park, belonging to the Duke of <HI>Bridgwater.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gadesden</HI> is famous for the Birth of <HI>John de Ga∣desden,</HI> who flourished in the Beginning of the Fourteenth Century; the first <HI>Englishman</HI> who was a Court Physician, and of whose Skill <HI>Chaucer</HI> makes honourable mention, in his <HI>Doctor of Physick,</HI> pre∣fix'd to his <HI>Canterbury Tales</HI>; though Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> from <HI>John</HI>'s own Books, will not allow him to de∣serve it. There are several Monuments in the Chancel of this Church of the <HI>Bridgwater</HI> Family, whose finely situated Seat and Park at <HI>Ashridge,</HI> formerly a Royal House of Pleasure, and where <HI>Edward</HI> I. held a Parliament in the Nineteenth Year of his Reign, is in this Parish, but in the County of
<PB N="173" REF="174"/>
<HI>Bucks.</HI> The Duke is Lord of this Manor, as also of that of <HI>Great-Gadesden.</HI></P>
<P>I cross'd over a Slip (as I may call it) of <HI>Bucks,</HI> which runs into <HI>Hertfordshire,</HI> between <HI>Aldbury</HI> and <HI>Kensworth-Green,</HI> which lies a little South of the Road which leads from <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s to <HI>Dunstable,</HI> and is a Situation surprisingly fine, about half a Mile in Length, a good Turf, and level with <HI>Whipsnape-Woods</HI> on the Back of it, and Rows of high Trees on the other Side. Nothing but Sky is to be seen from it one Way, and the other we have only a View of the Top of a Grove, at <HI>Market-Cell.</HI> It seems to claim a Preference of every Place in the County for a Cell, yet never had one on it: it comes very little short of the famous <HI>Guy</HI>'s Cliff, near <HI>Warwick.</HI> There the shady Grove, and rol∣ling Stream below it, make a beautiful Scene for So∣litude: here the Woods and Trees afford Shade enough, and the pure circumambient Ether, with nothing in View but the Tops of Trees, would make a Hermit think himself in another World.</P>
<P>Here I came into the Road, and so turned South-east for <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s, thro' <HI>Flamstead</HI> Parish, where is a well-built and delightful Seat of Sir <HI>Thomas-Saunders Sebright,</HI> Bart. on a rising Ground in the middle of a Park. It is called <HI>Beechwood</HI> Manor, from the great Number of fine Beech-trees which were formerly growing here, some of which are yet remaining on the Sides of the Park. The Soil of this Park is, for the most part, dry, the Surface being shallow, on a strong or chalky Bot∣tom, which renders the Turf very fine and short, and very pleasant for the Exercise of either riding or walking. It was formerly a Nunnery for a Prioress and Ten Nuns, independent of any other Convent, and then called <HI>St. Gyles in the Wood.</HI> A very serious Inscription in <HI>Flamstead</HI> Church, on a Monument of one of the <HI>Saunders</HI> Family, may
<PB N="174" REF="175"/>
be worth transcribing, as it certainly is a Piece of sound Doctrine, in which every living Man may find an Use.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He that looks hereon, may consider how fleet∣ing all worldly Comforts are, and how great a Vanity it is to place his Affection thereon. Such Things there are as worldly Comforts, 'tis true; but they ought to be look'd on as <HI>little Streams</HI>; and whoever delights in them, more than in the FOUNTAIN from whence they proceed, may soon find them dry and vanished. The Truth of which he that wrote this, hath sensibly found; and wills others to place their Affections chiefly on that OBJECT OF LOVE, which is unchange∣able, and is the Centre of all true Joy and Felicity."</Q></P>
<P>Pursuing still the same Course along the great Road, we came next to <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s, the capital Town of <HI>Hertfordshire,</HI> famous for deriving its Name from the Proto-martyr of <HI>England,</HI> who suf∣fered so early in the fourth Century. 'Tis governed by a Mayor, 10 Burgesses, a Steward and a Cham∣berlain, and is a peculiar Liberty both for Ecclesiasti∣cal and Civil Government.</P>
<P>The Town rose out of the Ruins of old <HI>Verulam</HI>; of which so much has been said by Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> and others, that we refer to them for Particulars. In that great Man's Time, the Ruins afforded much more for the Observation of the Curious than now; for they are since dug away, for mending the High∣ways. The first <HI>Verulam</HI> was stormed and taken by <HI>Julius Caesar.</HI> And here <HI>Cassibelan,</HI> a famous <HI>British</HI> King, then kept his Court. The first Destruction of the Place is supposed to have been by <HI>Boadicea,</HI> the famous <HI>British</HI> Queen, who cut off 70000 <HI>Romans</HI> in one Battle; and the second, (which was erected on the Ruins of the other) in the Wars between the <HI>Britons</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI>; and al∣most
<PB N="175" REF="176"/>
infinite are the Numbers of Antiquities here dug up.</P>
<P>The Origin of <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s was owing to the Monastery built by <HI>Offa,</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> to the Memory of St. <HI>Alban,</HI> in Expiation of his bar∣barous Murder of <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> King of <HI>East-Angles,</HI> whom he had treacherously inveigled to his Court, on Pretence of marrying his Daughter; and the same <HI>Offa</HI> it was that built <HI>Hertford</HI> Cathedral, and dedicated it to <HI>St. Ethelbert,</HI> and made a Journey to <HI>Rome</HI> as further Penance, where he was absolved, tho' he kept the murder'd Prince's Dominions, and joined them to his own.</P>
<P>Of all the Monasteries in <HI>England,</HI> none could outshine this. Its Revenue was great, and its Pri∣vileges still greater. In the Royalties it had from its Founder, and the Episcopal Powers from the Pope, none came up to it. The mitred Abbot had Precedency of all in <HI>England,</HI> and subject to no Ecclesiastical Power but the Pope immediately; and he had Episcopal Jurisdiction over both Clergy and Laity in all the Lands belonging to his Monastery. From first to last they were Forty-one in Number, and many of them Persons of great Ac∣complishments, and high Birth: the 39th of which, tho' not high-born, was Cardinal <HI>Wolsey.</HI> The last Abbot was <HI>Richard Boreman,</HI> who at the Dissolu∣tion quietly surrendred on the Royal Command, and accepted of a Pension for Life, of 266<HI>l.</HI> 13<HI>s.</HI> and 4<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>Two bloody Battles were fought near this Place, between the Houses of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster</HI>; the first upon the 23d of <HI>May</HI> 1455, in which the <HI>Yorkists</HI> got the Day; the second on <HI>Shrove-Tuesday,</HI> in the 39th of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. when the martial Queen <HI>Margaret</HI> overcame the <HI>Yorkists,</HI> who had then the King in their Power, and fought under the Sanction of his Name.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="177"/>But we must not dismiss this Subject without giving some brief Particulars of the famous Abbey Church. We have before observed, that it was founded by King <HI>Offa</HI>; but it has been rebuilt in Whole or Part several times. The Town purchased it at the Dissolution, for 400<HI>l.</HI> which prevented so noble a Fabrick being pulled down, and torn to Pieces, for making Money of the Materials; and it is made a Parish Church for the Borough. The High Altar is a curious Piece of <HI>Gothick</HI> Architecture.</P>
<P>Within the North Entrance is <HI>Offa</HI> on his Throne. Underneath,
<Q><HI>Fundator Ecclesiae circa annum</HI> 793.<L><HI>Quem male depictum, et residentem cernitis alte</HI></L><L><HI>Sublimem solio,</HI> MERCIUS OFFA <HI>fuit.</HI></L></Q> <HI>That is:</HI>
<Q>The Founder of the Church, about the Year 793.<L>Whom you behold ill-painted, on his Throne</L><L>Sublime, was once for MERCIAN OFFA known.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the most Eastern Part of the Church stood the Shrine: Six Holes remain in the Pavement, where the Supporters of it were fixed. This Inscription is still to be seen.
<Q>S. ALBANUS VEROLAMENSIS, ANGLORUM<LB/>PROTOMARTYR, 17. <HI>Junij</HI> 293.</Q></P>
<P>On the South Side the Shrine, in the Wall of the South Isle, is Duke HUMPHREY's Monument, with the Arms of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> quartered, and a Ducal Coronet. In Niches on the South Side are 17 Kings; the Niches on the other Side have none remaining.

<P>It is but little above 30 Years ago, that, digging for a Grave, the Stairs leading down to the Vault where the Body lies, were discovered.</P>
<P>In the Vault is a leaden Coffin, with the Body preserved by the Pickle it lies in, except the Legs, from which the Flesh is wasted, the Pickle of that End being dried up. On the Wall at the East End of the Vault is a Crucifix painted, with a Cup on each Side of the Head; another at the Side, and a fourth at the Feet. The Vault is very neat, and hath no offensive Smell. The Coffin, we are told, had an Outside of Wood, which is intirely gone.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="179"/>The West End of the Choir hath a noble Piece of <HI>Gothick</HI> Workmanship for the Ornament of the High Altar. Capt. <HI>Polehampton,</HI> about 30 Years ago, gave an Altar-piece, which represents the last Supper.</P>
<P>There are many curious Medals and Coins to be seen in the Church, which have been dug out of the Ruins of old <HI>Verulam.</HI></P>
<P>This noble Fabrick hath wanted its Abbot's Zeal and Purse too, for Repairs, since it hath been a Parish Church. The Roof was preserved by Con∣tribution of the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>England,</HI> many of whose Arms are put up on this Occasion; and Money has been collected several times besides for its Support: indeed such a fine Fabrick must too often stand in need of such Helps, as there is no settled Fund to maintain it.</P>
<P>There are Three Churches in the Town at pre∣sent, besides the Abbey Church, <HI>viz. St. Michael</HI>'s above-mentioned, <HI>St. Peter's,</HI> and <HI>St. Stephen</HI>'s.</P>
<P>There were also formerly belonging to this Town <HI>St. German</HI>'s Chapel, <HI>St. Mary Magdalen</HI>'s Chapel, <HI>St. Julian</HI>'s Hospital, the Hospital of <HI>St. Mary des Prees,</HI> the Nunnery of <HI>Sopwell,</HI> &amp;c. But they are all demolished and secularized. There was also in the Town the Parish Church of <HI>St. Andrew</HI>; but that had dropp'd down before the Dissolution.</P>
<P>Near this Place is <HI>Sopwel</HI> Nunnery, where they say King <HI>Henry</HI> was married to <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Bolen.</HI> In the Heart of the adjoining Corporation stood one of Queen <HI>Eleanor</HI>'s Crosses, demolished by the In∣habitants.</P>
<P>In the Neighbourhood of <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s is <HI>Gorhambury,</HI> where is a Statue of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. with other Things worthy a Traveller's Curiosity. It is now the Seat of the Lord <HI>Grimston:</HI> but what it will be always most famous for, is, that the Manor is the paternal Estate of that Mirror of all Ages, and

Ornament of his Country for Learning, <HI>Francis Bacon,</HI> created Lord <HI>Verulam</HI> and Viscount of <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s, once Lord Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> who first revived Experimental Philosophy: Of whose Merits, Rise and Fall, we shall say nothing, but refer our Readers to his Life now lately, in 1740, published, and prefixed to a new and beautiful Edition of his Works, written by the ingenious Mr. <HI>Mallet.</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Meautys,</HI> who had been the Secretary of this wonderful Man, and to whom he convey'd this Estate, in Gratitude, erected a Monument for him in <HI>St. Michael</HI>'s Church in this Town, sitting thoughfully in an Elbow-chair.</P>
<P>The Monument bears this Inscription:
<Q>Francisc. Bacon, <HI>Baro de</HI> Verulam, Sti.

<Q><HI>Francis Bacon</HI> Baron of <HI>Verulam,</HI> and Viscount of <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s; or, by his more known Titles, The Light of the Sciences, and the Law of Eloquence, was thus accustomed to sit; who, after having unravelled all the Mysteries of Natural and Civil Wisdom, fulfilled the Decree of Nature, <HI>That Things joined should be loosed,</HI> in the Year of our Lord 1626, and of his Age 66.
<P>To the Memory of so great a Man, this was erected by <HI>Thomas Meautys,</HI> who reverenced him while living, and admires him dead.</P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="181"/>The Manor of <HI>Kingsbury</HI> was sometimes the Re∣sidence of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Monarchs, whence its Name. It had a Castle, which was kept up till King <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Time, when it was demolish'd, and the Scite given to the Abbey.</P>
<P>The Duchess Dowager of <HI>Marlborough</HI> hath a Seat here, built by the late Duke upon the River <HI>Verlam,</HI> which runs thro' the Garden; and who also built handsome Alms-houses at the Entrance of the Town.</P>
<P>The following remarkable Inscription and Cha∣racter is cut upon the Pedestal of a fine Statue of the late Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> carved by the noted Mr. <HI>Rysbrach,</HI> and erected at <HI>St. Alban's,</HI> at the Expence of the Duchess, in Gratitude to the Memory of that excel∣lent Princess:</P>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>QUEEN <HI>ANNE</HI> was very graceful and ma∣jestick in her Person: Religious <HI>without Affectation.</HI> She always meant well. She had no <HI>false Ambition</HI>; which appeared, by her never complaining at King <HI>William</HI>'s being preferred to the Crown before her, when it was taken from the King her Father, for following such Counsels, and pursuing such Measures, as render'd the <HI>Revolution</HI> necessary. It was her greatest Affliction, to be forced to act against him, even for Security. Her Journey to <HI>Nottingham</HI> was never concerted, but occasion'd by the great Consternation she was under at the King's sudden Return from <HI>Salisbury.</HI></P>
<P>She always paid the greatest Respect to King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI>; never insisted upon any one Circumstance of <HI>Grandeur,</HI> more than what was <HI>established</HI> in her Family by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. tho', after the <HI>Revolution,</HI> she was presumptive Heir to the Crown, and after the Death of her Sister, was in the Place of Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="182"/>
Upon her Accession to the Throne, the <HI>Civil List was not increased.</HI> The late Earl of <HI>Godolphin,</HI> Lord High Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> often said, that, from Accidents in the Customs, and Lenity in the Collection, it did not arise, one Year with another, to more than Five hundred thousand Pounds a Year.</P>
<P>She had no <HI>Vanity</HI> in her Expences, nor bought any <HI>one Jewel</HI> in the whole Time of her Reign.</P>
<P>She paid out of her Civil List many Pensions granted in former Reigns, which have since been <HI>thrown upon the Publick.</HI></P>
<P>When a War was necessary to secure <HI>Europe</HI> against the Power of <HI>France</HI>; she contributed, in one Year, towards the War, out of her Civil List, One hundred thousand Pounds, in Ease of her Subjects.</P>
<P>She granted the Revenue arising from the First Fruits, to augment the Provisions of the poorer Clergy.</P>
<P>She never refused her private Charity to proper Objects.</P>
<P>Till a few Years before her Death, she never had but Twenty thousand Pounds a Year for her Privy Purse. At the latter End of her Reign, it did not exceed Twenty-six thousand Pounds a Year; which was much to her Honour, because it is subject to no Account. And as to her Robes, it will appear by the Records in the Exchequer, that in Nine Years she spent only Thirty-two thousand and Fifty Pounds, including the Coronation Expence.</P>
<P>She was extremely well-bred, treated her chief Ladies and Servants as if they had been her Equals. Her Behaviour to all that approached her was decent, and full of Dignity, and shewed <HI>Conde∣scension,</HI> without <HI>Art</HI> or <HI>Meanness.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="182" REF="183"/>At <HI>Colney</HI> is also a very handsome Seat of Sir. <HI>Henry-Pope Blunt</HI>'s, standing about a Quarter of a Mile North of the Road. It seems to be very large, and the Fields and Meadows about it make it very pleasant in Summer.</P>
<P>Having thus gone over the first Part I proposed of this Country, which lies South and South-west of <HI>St. Alban's</HI> Road, I shall now bend my Course North-east towards <HI>Hertford,</HI> and from thence North-west, to take in such Part of the middle Division as lie between the Two capital Roads on that Side of <HI>Hertford</HI>; reserving that which lies East of it, for my Return towards <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The next Town in my Way is <HI>Hatfield,</HI> 17 computed Miles from <HI>London:</HI> it is a Market-town; but much more famous is <HI>Hatfield</HI> House, which lies near it; from whence <HI>Edward</HI> VI. and Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> were both conducted to the Throne, having resided here for some time. King <HI>James</HI> made an Exchange of this Manor in the fourth Year of his Reign, for that of <HI>Theobald</HI>'s, as hereafter mentioned, with Sir <HI>Robert Cecil,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> who built this magnificent House, and made the Vineyard in the Park, thro' which the River <HI>Lee</HI> hath its Course, adorning that Garden. The Rectory of <HI>Hatfield</HI> is esteemed one of the best in <HI>England</HI>; <HI>Winwich</HI> in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and another in <HI>Durham,</HI> have larger Revenues; but this has a better Situation.</P>
<P><HI>Saundridge,</HI> which lies a little North-west of <HI>Hat∣field,</HI> deserves to be mentioned, as it gave Title of Baron to the late great Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>; and it now belongs to his illustrious Relict, a Descendant of the Family of <HI>Jennings,</HI> of this Place. But one Thing must be observed withal, that when I was there last, the Steeple lay buried in its own Rubbish, as it had done for 40 Years together; and the Bells
<PB N="183" REF="184"/>
hung in the Church behind the Door; and this, I suppose, continues to be its present State.</P>
<P><HI>North-Mymms</HI> stands a little East of <HI>Colney,</HI> and is remarkable for having in its Neighbourhood the Seat of the late Sir <HI>Joseph Jekyll,</HI> Master of the Rolls, in Right of his Lady, who was Heir to her late Brother the great Lord <HI>Somers.</HI> It has a most delightful Prospect. The Body of that noble Lord lies interred in the Chancel of the Church here, without any Inscription, in Allusion, as one would expect, to his Motto, <HI>Prodesse quam conspici.</HI> This Seat is now the Property of his Grace the Duke of <HI>Leeds,</HI> (who has put a great Part of the House and Gardens in good Repair) and is his Retirement from <HI>London,</HI> during any short Interval that may happen in the Sessions of Parliament.</P>
<P>We come now to <HI>Hertford,</HI> the County Town, 20 computed Miles from <HI>London</HI>; a Corporation, governed by a Mayor and Burgesses. It is pleasantly situated in a wholsome Air, and a dry Vale, having a good weekly Market well stored with Corn, and all sort of Provisions. It is very antient, and is built in the Form of a Y, with a Castle in the Middle of the two Horns. It contains several Streets and Lanes, well filled with handsome new-built Houses. In <HI>Edward</HI> III.'s Time, it had petitioned to be dis∣burden'd of the Expence of sending Two Members to Parliament, on their Inability to pay their Repre∣sentatives Wages: But 21. <HI>Jac.</HI> I. they petitioned to be restored to their Right, and succeeded.</P>
<P>There is a Free Grammar School for the Children of this Town, erected by <HI>Richard Hale,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in King <HI>James</HI> I.'s Reign. The House, being rebuilt a few Years ago, is a very good one. Of the Five Churches <HI>Hertford</HI> once had, there are but Two remaining, <HI>viz. All-Saints</HI> and <HI>St. Andrew</HI>'s.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Hertford</HI> is a Seat of Governor <HI>Harrison</HI> situated on a Hill, which commands a Prospect of
<PB N="184" REF="185"/>
the Country round it, as is likewise, in its Neigh∣bourhood, a Seat of the <HI>Clarks,</HI> very delightfully situated too.</P>
<P>The Earl <HI>Cowper</HI> has a handsome Seat near <HI>Hertingfordbury,</HI> in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Hertford,</HI> built by his Father the great Lord High Chancellor of that Name; who erected in the Church-yard a Tomb for his Mother, with an Inscription to her Honour: in this Church-yard is also the Tomb of Mrs. <HI>Eliza∣beth Culling,</HI> Heiress of a Family of that Name.</P>
<P>The Manor of <HI>Gobions</HI> lies a little North of <HI>Hertford,</HI> and will be for ever famous on Occasion of its being the Family-seat of the great Sir <HI>Thomas More,</HI> Lord High Chancellor of <HI>England</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who took off his Head, for refusing to acknowlege his Supremacy. It is now the Property of Sir <HI>Jeremy Sambroke,</HI> Bart. who for the Beauty of its Gardens, as well as the House, has made the Place one of the most remarkable Curiosities in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>A little still farther North, at <HI>Wotton,</HI> is the Mansion-house of the <HI>Botelers,</HI> nobly situated on a rising Ground, and watered with small Streams, which fall into the <HI>Beane</HI> on the South of it. It stands in a Park beautifully consisting of Hills and Flats, and renowned for as good Timber as the Island pro∣duces. About 40 Years since, one Tree was sold for 43<HI>l.</HI> 18 Horses were had to draw one Part of it, when slit, and out of it the <HI>Cutwater</HI> to the <HI>Royal Sovereign</HI> was made. Another, called the <HI>Walking-Stick,</HI> might some Years ago have been sold for Fifty Guineas; but was decaying when I was there, by the burrowing of Rabbets under it. There is a good Free-school in this Village, for poor Children; with some of whom 5<HI>l.</HI> is to be given Apprentice.</P>
<P><HI>Stevenage</HI> is 28 computed Miles from <HI>London,</HI> and lies North-west of <HI>Hertford.</HI> It is a small Market-town: the Church stands upon a Hill, and consists
<PB N="185" REF="186"/>
of a Nave and Two Isles, and the Chancel hath a Chapel on each Side. In the Steeple is a Ring of Six Bells. Here is a good Free-school, as well for Petit as Grammar Scholars.</P>
<P><HI>Walkern</HI> is near it, North-east, on the River <HI>Beane.</HI> I mention it on Account of the poor <HI>Jane Wenman,</HI> who within these 30 Years was tried for a Witch, the last, we hope, that ever will undergo such a Trial in <HI>England</HI>; for the old obsolete Law against Witches was very lately repealed. Mr. Justice <HI>Powell</HI> got a Reprieve for the poor Creature, after the Jury had found her guilty, contrary to his Directions. She lived several Years afterwards on an Allowance from the Parish. The poor Wretch had been frighted into a Confession, that she was a Witch; and thereupon was committed by Sir <HI>Harry Chauncy,</HI> of <HI>Yardlybury,</HI> who would fain have had her retract, and pacify her Accusers. This Gentleman was one of the deprived Judges of King <HI>James</HI> II. but it is said he never sat as Judge but one Day. He wrote <HI>The Antiquities of</HI> HERTFORDSHIRE.</P>
<P>It is reported likewise, that another Woman being tried before Judge <HI>Powell,</HI> who among other Things that constituted her a Witch, had laid to her Charge, That she could fly; <HI>Ay!</HI> said the Judge; <HI>And is this true? Do you say you can fly? Yes, I can,</HI> said she.—<HI>So you may, if you will, then,</HI> replied the Judge; <HI>I have no Law against it.</HI>
And at the Trial of <HI>Jane Wenman,</HI> the Court being full of fine Ladies, the old Judge very gallantly told the Jury, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They must not look out for Witches among the Old Women, but among the Young."</Q></P>
<P>I passed by <HI>Benington-place,</HI> the Seat of the antient Family of the <HI>Caesars.</HI> There was formerly a Castle there; the Hill on which it stood, still remains deep ditched.</P>
<P>At <HI>Siffivernes,</HI> in <HI>Codicote</HI> Parish, in the Year 1627, was a most prodigious Walnut-tree, covering
<PB N="186" REF="187"/>
76 Poles of Ground. The Weight of the Boughs at last cleft the Trunk to the Ground. Mr. <HI>Penn,</HI> then Lord of the Manor, had 19 Loads of Planks out of it; a Gun-stock Maker at <HI>London</HI> had as much as cost 10<HI>l.</HI> Carriage: There were 30 Loads more of Roots and Branches. This was attested by <HI>Edward Wingate,</HI> before a neighbouring Justice of Peace, to whom Mr. <HI>Penn</HI> declared, he had been offered 50<HI>l.</HI> for the Tree. And <HI>Jasper Docura</HI> of the Parish attested, That when he was 15 Years old, the Compass of both his Arms would not reach round it at Eight times.</P>
<P><HI>Hitchin</HI> is a Market-town, lying in a Bottom, out of any great Road, distant from <HI>London</HI> 30 com∣puted Miles, and within three Miles of <HI>Bedfordshire.</HI> 'Tis governed by a Bailiff and Four Constables, and was formerly famous for the Staple Commodities of this Kingdom. The Church is large, dedicated to St. <HI>Mary.</HI> It consists of the Nave and Two Ayles, with Two Chapels or Chancels. The Steeple has a Ring of Six Bells, but is low, and disproportionate to the Chancel. In the North Ayle Window are Paintings of <HI>Faith, Hope,</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> and of the <HI>Four Cardinal Virtues</HI>; and in the next North Window, the <HI>Beatitudes.</HI> The Front hath the Twelve Apostles round it; but they have been Suf∣ferers from the booted Saints of Forty-one. There are many Monuments in it. A good Free-school, and other charitable Benefactions, have been made to the Town.</P>
<P>I could not miss taking notice of <HI>Hexton,</HI> on the North-west Edge of the County, next <HI>Bedfordshire,</HI> where was a Battle between the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI> some Remains of which are visible between this Place and <HI>Luton,</HI> as large Barrows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Half a Mile to the South of this Town is a fortify'd Piece of Ground, called <HI>Ravensborough Castle.</HI> The Camp is a sort of Oblong, containing about 16 Acres, the
<PB N="187" REF="188"/>
Fortification intire. Nature has so well strengthened it, that 1000 Men may defend it against a very great Army: it is incompassed with a Valley, and a very steep Hill, inaccessible by an Army any-where but at the Point of Entrance, which is by a gradual Ascent of a Quarter of a Mile.</P>
<P>The <HI>Beryslade,</HI> a House possessed by <HI>John Cross,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> tho' low and in the Dirt, is now an agreeable Summer-house; which it owes chiefly to <HI>St. Faith</HI>'s Well, a fine Spring at <HI>Ravensburg.</HI> A moory Piece of Ground, where the Spring rises, is cut into Ca∣nals, which are stocked with Trouts, many of them 22 Inches long. These having been used to take their Food from the Master's Hand, out of a Bowl with a long Handle to it, come rolling up to the Surface. The Bottom is white, either from Chalk or Sand; and so transparent, that every Fish may be seen that comes out of its Hole. To preserve them from Groping, the Banks are wharfed, and in some Places supported with Timber; so that the Fish can shelter themselves underneath; and a Man must have his Head and Shoulders in Water, who stoops down to them. From hence the Water feeds a large Canal in the Garden stored with Carp and Tench; and there might be made Basons or Canals to any Dimensions.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Hexton</HI> is a Square <HI>Roman</HI> Camp upon a Promontory just big enough for the Purpose, and under it is a fine Spring.</P>
<P><HI>Lilibo</HI> is a fine Plot of Ground upon a Hill, where a Horse-race is kept. It lies a little South of <HI>Hexton,</HI> just by the <HI>Ikening.</HI></P>
<P>Near <HI>Pirton</HI> Church has been a Castle of the <HI>Saxons</HI> or <HI>Normans,</HI> with a Keep.</P>
<P>I proceeded next to <HI>Baldock,</HI> situated on the <HI>Ikening-street,</HI> as it leads from <HI>Dunstable</HI> to <HI>Royston.</HI> It is a large Market-town, 29 computed Miles from <HI>London.</HI> It is of chief Note for its many Maltsters.
<PB N="188" REF="189"/>
The Church stands in the Middle of the Town; it is a handsome high-built Edifice, with a Ring of Six good Bells. It has Three Chancels, but the Two outward are rather Chapels. The <HI>Ikening-street,</HI> about <HI>Baldock</HI> now appears but like a Field-way. Between <HI>Baldock</HI> and <HI>Icleford</HI> it goes thro' an In∣trenchment, consisting of the Remains of a <HI>British</HI> Town, now called <HI>Wilbury-hill. Icleford</HI> retains the Name of the Street, which at this Place passes a Rivulet with a strong Ford, wanting Reparation.</P>
<P>This Street, quite to the <HI>Thames</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> goes at the Bottom of a continued Ridge of Hills, called the <HI>Chiltern,</HI> being Chalk, and the natural and civil Boundary between the Counties of <HI>Hertford</HI> and <HI>Bedford,</HI> very steep Northward.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Ikening-street</HI> and the <HI>Foss</HI> traversed the Kingdom from South-west to North-east, parallel to each other, and <HI>Watling-street</HI> crossed these quite the contrary Way with an equal Obliquity, the <HI>Herman-street</HI> passed directly North and South. This Word is <HI>Saxon,</HI> and signifies a Soldier or Warrior, which Name it obtained from being a Military Way.</P>
<P>It begins at <HI>Newhaven,</HI> at the Mouth of the River <HI>Ouse</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> and passes on the West Side of that River, thro' <HI>Radmil,</HI> then thro' <HI>Lewis</HI> by <HI>Isfield</HI>; after which it seems to pass over the River at <HI>Sharn∣bridge,</HI> and so proceeds to <HI>East Grinstead</HI>; but is lost in passing thro' the great Woods. Then thro' <HI>Surry</HI> it goes by <HI>Stane-street, Croydon, Stretham,</HI> and by its pointing we may conclude was originally designed to pass the <HI>Thames</HI> at the Ferry called <HI>Stan∣gate</HI> by <HI>Lambeth,</HI> where it coincides with the <HI>Watling-street.</HI> There the Road went, before <HI>London</HI> became considerable: but since that Period the Traces of the Roads near that Capital have grown very obscure. The original Road perhaps passes thro' unfrequented Ways near <HI>Enfield,</HI> and <HI>Harman-street,</HI> which seems from thence to have borrowed its Name.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="190"/>On the Eastern Side of <HI>Enfield</HI> Chace by <HI>Bush-hill,</HI> is a circular <HI>British</HI> Camp upon an Eminence, de∣clining South-west. But the antient Road appears upon a Common on this Side <HI>Hertford</HI> by <HI>Ball's-park,</HI> and passes the River below <HI>Hertford</HI>; then, goes thro' <HI>Ware-park,</HI> and falls into the present Road on this Side <HI>Buntingford,</HI> and so to <HI>Royston,</HI> where it crosses the <HI>Ikening-street,</HI> coming from <HI>Tring</HI> thro' <HI>Dunstable,</HI> going into <HI>Suffolk.</HI> These are the principal Places upon the Two Roads, which we thought fit to mention together.</P>
<P>At <HI>Baldock</HI> I crossed the North Road, and got into the Third Division I proposed, next <HI>Cambridgeshire</HI> and <HI>Essex</HI>; and when I have passed thro' it, I will return back again South, and take a View of such Towns as lie on the East Side of the middle Division as I have not been at already.</P>
<P>In the Year 1724, between <HI>Caldecot</HI> and <HI>Henx∣worth,</HI> several <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities were dug up. Workmen, digging Gravel for the Repair of the great Northern Road, struck upon some earthen Vessels or large Urns, full of Ashes and burnt Bones, but rotten; near them a human Skeleton, with the Head towards the South-east, the Feet North-west. Several Bodies were found in the same Position, not above a Foot under the Surface of the Earth, and with Urns, great or small, near them, and Patera's of fine red Earth, some with the Impression of the Maker at the Bottom; also Glass Lacrymatories, Ampulla's, a Brass Tribulus, Six small Glasses, Two large Beads of a Green Colour, and other Frag∣ments.</P>
<P>I went thro' the Village of <HI>Ashwell,</HI> which stands not far from <HI>Caldecot,</HI> on the Source of the <HI>Rhee,</HI> by the Borders of <HI>Cambridgeshire,</HI> which breaks out of a Rock here from many Springs, with such Force as to form a Stream remarkably clear, but so cold, that it gripes Horses not used to drink it.
<PB N="190" REF="191"/>
The Water here bubbles out at as many Places, and as abundantly, and in just such a Bottom under a Hill, as doth the <HI>Isis</HI> or <HI>Thames</HI> in <HI>Gloucestershire.</HI> In <HI>Domesday Book</HI> this Village is called a Borough, having Fourteen Burgesses, and a Market; antiently also it had Four Fairs. Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> thinks the Village <HI>Roman</HI>; and at half a Mile Distance, South of this Source of the <HI>Rhee,</HI> is a Spot of Ground taken in by a Vallum, and generally thought to be one of the <HI>Castra Exploratorum</HI> of the <HI>Romans</HI>; it is called <HI>Arbury Banks,</HI> and consists of about 12 Acres, and <HI>Roman</HI> Coins have been found here; but still it wants several Requisites, that go to a <HI>Roman</HI> Camp, which I have not room to particularize. <HI>Ashwell-field</HI> affords a Stone Quarry, out of which the Stones of most of the Churches of this Side, and the neighbouring Part of <HI>Bedfordshire,</HI> have been dug. The Church has a handsome Chancel, Three large Ayles, a lofty Tower at the West End, with a Ring of Six Bells, and a Chapel on the North Side the Chancel.</P>
<P>I now come to <HI>Royston,</HI> situated upon the utmost Northern Border of <HI>Hertfordshire,</HI> insomuch that Part of it is in <HI>Cambridgeshire,</HI> 33 computed Miles from <HI>London.</HI> The Fields about this Towns have upon almost every Eminence a Barrow, and they lie very thick by the <HI>Ikening-street,</HI> East of this Town. Here was a Monastery founded in Honour of St. <HI>Thomas à Becket,</HI> as also an Hospital, both swallowed up in the Dissolution of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. but the Priory-church was purchased by the Inhabitants, and made a Parish-church of. It consists of a Nave, and an Ayle on each Side, and a square Tower with a Ring of Five Bells in it.</P>
<P>The Town became populous, on erecting the present Post-road through it, which before ran along the <HI>Ermine-street,</HI> thro' <HI>Barkw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>iggleswade.</HI> It is now a good Town, and well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and has
<PB N="191" REF="192"/>
a very great Corn-market on <HI>Wednesdays,</HI> and is full of good Inns. In the Year 1716, a School-house was erected here by Contribution of the Town and Country.</P>
<P>Two Miles both Ways of <HI>Royston</HI> is chalky Soil; about <HI>Puckeridge</HI> it is gravelly: in other Places adjoining are Camps, and <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities. At <HI>Hadstock</HI> is the Skin of a <HI>Danish</HI> King nailed upon the Church Doors, as reported.</P>
<P><HI>Royston</HI> was a <HI>Roman</HI> Town before <HI>Roisia</HI> built her religious House here; for <HI>Roman</HI> Coins have been dug up near the Spot. There seems to be the Stamp of <HI>Roisia</HI>'s Cross still remaining at the Corner of the Inn, just where the Two Roads meet. The Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> digging Canals at <HI>Wimple,</HI> when he had that Seat, found many Bodies, and rusty Pieces of Iron, the Remains of some Battle.</P>
<P>And now I bend my Course Southward, towards <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Therfield,</HI> which lies among the Hills, a little South of <HI>Royston,</HI> is obliged to <HI>Francis</HI> Lord Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI> once Rector of it, who paved the Chancel with Free-stone, the Area of the Altar with Marble; wainscoted the Walls, made it into the Form of a Choir, and ceiled it with Fret-work. 'Tis a Rectory of great Value, and is rated in the First-fruits Office, at 50<HI>l.</HI> a Year. Till lately was at <HI>Therfield</HI> Furniture of all Sorts for the Use of poor Peoples Weddings, such as was at <HI>Braughing</HI>; but they are now lost, or converted to other Uses, even literally to Ploughshares and Pease-hooks.</P>
<P><HI>Barkway</HI> is a Market-town. The Church stands in the midst of the Town, with an Ayle on each Side, and a Tower with Five Bells, and a Turret-clock. The Creation of the World is painted on one of the Windows. In one Pane at Top is a bodily Repre∣sentation of the Deity, as a Man in a loose R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>be, down to his Feet, with the Globe before him,
<PB N="192" REF="193"/>
and the Motto under, <HI>De operae primae diei.</HI> The next Pane has the same, with Hands expanded, standing on the Firmament, in the midst of the Water; under which, <HI>De opere Secundae diei.</HI> The Third has the same Figure, amongst green Trees and Herbs; the Legend lost, and Three other Panes, in Order, under these. The Painting of the Fourth is lost. The Fifth has the same Figure, with Birds flying about it. A Piece of the Sixth remains, where Fowls and Beasts are brought to <HI>Adam</HI> to be named. Another Window, in the North Isle, has St. <HI>George</HI> slaying a Dragon, a Bishop, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Road, called <HI>Ermine-street,</HI> passes thro' the Parish of <HI>Amsty</HI>; and all the Way upon it we find Remains of Camps and Stations, ex∣actly according to the Itinerary. The Castle for∣merly here, was said to be built by <HI>Eustace</HI> Earl of <HI>Bologne,</HI> at the Conqueror's Command; and it is not improbable, that there were Fortifi∣cations before. It consisted of a Keep, or round artificial Hill, yet remaining, with a large and deep Fosse about it; the Mount, probably, made from the Ditch. The Barons, in King <HI>John</HI>'s Time, made another Retrenchment South of it, which would contain a Garison as numerous as the Castle would hold. <HI>Henry</HI> III. obliged <HI>Nicolas de Avestic</HI> to demolish the additional Fortification, and keep up only the old one.</P>
<P>The Church was built in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. as is said, out of the Stones of the demolished Forti∣fications made additional to the Castle. It is cer∣tainly very old, and built with a low Tower in the Middle, and Two Ayles. The Chancel, perhaps, was rebuilt with the Materials of the Keep, being of later Date. It is large and lofty, and hath Stalls, as if for a Choir.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194"/><HI>Buntingford</HI> is the next Town, and lies in the <HI>Cambridge</HI> Road, noted for a great Thorough-fare, 28 computed Miles from <HI>London,</HI> and owes its Being as a Town to the present Post-road through it to the North. The first Mention of it is in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. who gave a Market and a Fair to it. It is situated in <HI>Layston</HI> Parish; but has a Chapel of Brick, built by Contribution for the Inhabitants here. Dr. <HI>Seth Ward</HI> Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> who died <HI>Jan.</HI> 6. 1688, built a neat Brick-house near the Chapel, for Four poor Men, and Four poor Women, who had lived handsomely, and came to Decay thro' Misfortunes; each of which has Two Rooms below, and Two above. <HI>Buntingford</HI> Free-school owes much also to the same worthy Prelate, who had his Edu∣cation in it. He built, 1683, an Hospital at <HI>Salis∣bury,</HI> for Ten poor Widows of Clergymen, was a Benefactor to <HI>Layston,</HI> gave a good Sum of Money to make <HI>Salisbury</HI> River navigable; 600<HI>l.</HI> to be laid out in Land, for putting out Three poor Children Apprentices, Two out of <HI>Alseden,</HI> and One out of <HI>Layston,</HI> alternately. In short, the good Bishop seems to have thought, that the Reve∣nues he reaped from the Church, ought to have some other more publick Designation, than to lift out of Obscurity a private Family.</P>
<P><HI>Braughing</HI> lies a little on the East of the Road, was antiently, next to <HI>Verulam,</HI> the most considerable Place in the County, and is thought to have been the <HI>Roman Caesaromagum,</HI> situated 28 Miles from <HI>London,</HI> as by <HI>Antoninus</HI>'s <HI>Itinerary.</HI> It still has some Ruins of its antient Eminence, giving Name to the Deanry and the Hundred. On the West Side the <HI>Ermin-street,</HI> now the Road to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> we find the Ruins of a <HI>Roman</HI> Camp. The Church is an handsome Building, and hath a Ring of Five good Bells.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="195"/>Near the Church-yard is an old House, at present inhabited by poor Families, which was given with all Sorts of Furniture for Weddings. They brought hither their Provisions, and had a large Kitchen, with a Caldron, large Spits and Dripping-pan; a large Room for Merriment; a Lodging-room with a Bride-bed and good Linen; some of which Furniture was in being a few Years ago.</P>
<P>This Provision was also at <HI>Therfield,</HI> and the Kitchen Utensils, but lately lost.</P>
<P>We proceeded thro' <HI>Puckridge,</HI> a little Hamlet Town, but a great Thorough-fare, standing on the <HI>Ermin-street,</HI> where there are several good Inns for Travellers, and came to <HI>Standon,</HI> a small Market-town. The Church hath Three Ayles; the Floor of the Chancel is Seven Steps above that of the Church, and the Altar Three Steps above the Chancel-floor.</P>
<P>Here we turn'd short to the East, to visit <HI>Bishop-Stortford,</HI> lying on the Borders of <HI>Essex,</HI> 27 Miles from <HI>London.</HI> The Conqueror gave this Town and Castle to the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> whence its <HI>Praenomen</HI>; and King <HI>John</HI> seized and demolished it, for the Offence of the then Bishop, who was one of those who published the Pope's Interdict against the Nation. The Town, in the same Reign, was incorporated, and returned Members to Seven successive Parlia∣ments. The Bishop was restored by the same Prince, and Satisfaction made him for demolishing the Castle. The Hill or Keep of the Castle is artificial, made of Earth carried thither, with a Breast-work at Top of Stones and Morter. A Bank of Earth leads from it thro' the moory Ground, on which it was situated, to the North-east. There is a large Wall from the Top of the Hill yet remaining. The Bishop's Prison was in being in Bishop <HI>Bonner</HI>'s Time; tho' all the old Buildings are since demolished. But the Castle-guard is still paid by several Places to the Bishop, besides other Quit-rents.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="196"/>The Town is large, and well-built; it is a Thorough-fare from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Cambridge, New-market,</HI> and <HI>St. Edmundsbury,</HI> and full of convenient Inns. It is built in the Form of a Cross, having four Streets turn'd to the Cardinal Points, and the River <HI>Stort</HI> runs thro' it.</P>
<P>The Church dedicated to <HI>St. Michael,</HI> is lofty, and stands on high Ground; it hath a fine Ring of Eight Bells. There were antiently Three Guilds and a Chantry founded here. In the Church are Nine Stalls on a Side, for a Choir. On the North Side the Church is a Gallery for the young Gentle∣men of the School, built by Contribution; upon it Sir <HI>John Hobart</HI>'s Arms, who was educated there, and a great Benefactor to this Work.</P>
<P>At the West End is another Gallery, built a few Years ago, upon which is an Organ; and it is ob∣servable, that there was an Organ in this Church so long ago as in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. A new Font stands before it, with a Pavement of Black and White Marble, inclosed with Iron Ralis.</P>
<P>There are a great Number of Monuments in the Church, particularly one in the North Ayle, for Seven Children of <HI>Edward Maphesden,</HI> who died of the Small-pox, with a <HI>Latin</HI> Inscription, deploring that heavy Dispensation.</P>
<P>Several Benefactions are bestowed on the Poor of this Town, particularly Two Alms-houses in <HI>Potters-street.</HI> But the greatest Ornament of the Town is the School, built 35 Years ago, by Contribution of the Gentlemen of <HI>Hertfordshire</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> at the Request of Dr. <HI>Thomas Tooke</HI> late Master, who also procured several Sums for completing it, from the young Gentlemen educated here. When this Gen∣tleman engaged in it, it was at the lowest Ebb of Reputation; but he raised it to a great Degree of Fame, and considerably increased the Trade of the Town, by the beneficial Concourse that it
<PB N="196" REF="197"/>
brought thither. He revived the annual School-feast, and charged his own Estate with a yearly Present to the Preacher on that Occasion. He died <HI>May</HI> 4. 1721, after upwards of 30 Years successful and diligent Labours here. By his Interest and Care the Gallery in the Church, for the Use of the School, was erected: He gave a Chalice of 20<HI>l.</HI> Value to the Church, and was a great Benefactor to the School Library, which is a very good one, and was first set on foot by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Thomas Leigh,</HI> B. D. who was Vicar of the Church <HI>Anno</HI> 1680.</P>
<P>The School stands in the High-street, with the West Front to the Church-yard, consisting of Three Rooms, which, with the Stair-case, make a square Building. The Grammar School takes up half of it, all the Front to the Street; the other Two are the Library, and Writing-school. These stand upon Arches, under which are a Market and Shops, which are the Property of the Parish; and here the School was built at the Desire of the Inhabitants, who got by it a Covering for their Market, and at the same time an Ornament to their Town.</P>
<P>Every Gentleman at leaving the School presents a Book to the Library.</P>
<P><HI>Hadham Parva</HI> stands a little North of <HI>Bishop-Stortford,</HI> and is of chief Note for being the Burying-place of the <HI>Capels,</HI> Earls of <HI>Essex.</HI></P>
<P>The Manor of <HI>Rye,</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Stansted-Abbots,</HI> is famous for the Plot, called thence <HI>the Rye-house Plot,</HI> said to be formed for assassinating King <HI>Charles</HI> II. in his Return from <HI>New-market</HI>; for which several Persons suffered, and among the rest the Tenant of the Place, <HI>Rumball,</HI> a Man of a daring and intrepid Spirit.</P>
<P><HI>Honesdon,</HI> separated from <HI>Essex</HI> by the <HI>Stort,</HI> de∣serves to be mentioned for Three Reasons; first, for its noble Situation upon a gravelly rising Ground,
<PB N="197" REF="198"/>
overlooking the Meadows; 2dly, for being the Re∣sidence of the Children of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in whose Hands it was then, on account of its good Air, and Vicinity to <HI>London</HI>; and 3dly, for the Seat of <HI>Robert Chester,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> built within these few Years, inclosed with a Park. It stands upon a beautiful Hill, overlooking the Meadows, the River <HI>Stort,</HI> and Part of <HI>Essex,</HI> from the back Front; from the other it hath a Prospect over great Part of <HI>Hertfordshire,</HI> and is seen from <HI>Cheshunt</HI> Common, on one hand, as <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s is from the other. At the Entrance of the Avenue it hath a large Basin, thro' which runs a small Stream, and there is a graceful Plantation of Trees, with Variety of Slopes, adorned with Statues. The same Stream afterwards feeds a Canal.</P>
<P>We pursued our Way directly South, and came to <HI>Sawbridgeworth,</HI> or <HI>Sabsworth.</HI> Among several an∣tient Monuments in the Church, is an handsome one erected to the Memory of General <HI>Lumly,</HI> Bro∣ther to the then Earl of <HI>Scarborough,</HI> with an In∣scription greatly to his Honour. As follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here lieth the Honourable HENRY LUMLEY, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> only Brother to <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Scarborough</HI>; who was in every Battle, and at every Siege, as Colonel, Lieutenant-General, or General of the Horse, with King <HI>William,</HI> or the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> in Twenty Campaigns, in <HI>Ireland, Flanders,</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI>; where he was honoured, esteemed and beloved by our own Army, by our Allies, and even by the Enemies, for his singular Politeness and Humanity, as well as for all his military Virtues and Capacity. He sat long in Parliament, always zealous for the Honour of the Crown, and for the Good of his Country; and knew no Party, but that of Truth, Justice, and Honour. He died Governor of the Isle of
<PB N="198" REF="199"/>
<HI>Jersey,</HI> the 18th of <HI>October</HI> 1722, in the 63d Year of his Age."</Q></P>
<P>The Manor House of <HI>Pish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bury,</HI> in <HI>Sabsworth</HI> Parish, deserves to be mentioned on account of its remarkable Strength, (though built in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time) and lofty Rooms. It is situated on a clean Soil, has handsome Avenues to it, with the River <HI>Stort</HI> behind, which communicates with the Canals in the Gardens. It is in the Possession of the Family of <HI>Gardiner.</HI></P>
<P>We then cross'd the Country directly West to <HI>Ware,</HI> situated 20 Miles from <HI>London,</HI> on the River <HI>Lee,</HI> in its Course from <HI>Milford.</HI> The Town stands low, upon a Level with the River. It is a Place of great Trade for all sorts of Grain, but chiefly Malt, which is conveyed in great Quantities to <HI>London,</HI> by the River <HI>Lee,</HI> which is navigable from hence; and the Barges bring Coals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It consists of one principal Street a Mile long, and other back Streets and Lanes. At an Inn in this Town is the famous great Bed, which is 12 Feet square.</P>
<P><HI>Ware</HI> being 20 Miles from <HI>London,</HI> is the second Post Town from thence on the Northern Road. The next is <HI>Royston,</HI> 13 Miles further. Several Alms-houses, and a Free-school, and other Charities belong to this Town.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Byde,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Lord of the Manor, has a House pleasantly situated in the Park here, to which is an Ascent of every Side; also a Vineyard newly planted. One late Improvement, besides many others, is, a Cut from the <HI>Rib,</HI> which by that Means turns that Stream thro' the Park on the South Side, which is a fine Nursery and Protection for Trouts.</P>
<P>In the North Part of the Town was situated the Priory, now in the Possession of the Family of <HI>Hadsley.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="200"/>An eminent Tradesman of <HI>Ware,</HI> having lost by Death a favourite Mare, which he had had many Years; in Consideration of her good Services, made, in <HI>March</HI> 1739, a grand Burying for her, and in∣vited near 300 People to it. He and his Wife going next the Carcase, as chief Mourners, were followed by the rest of the Company in Couples; and about Four o'Clock she was interred in <HI>Hare-lane-field,</HI> near the Town, with great Pomp: After which the Company returned, and were treated with Plum Cake and Strong Beer, at the Mourner's House, who expressed great Concern for the Loss of the valuable Creature.</P>
<P>At <HI>Blake</HI>'s-<HI>ware,</HI> the most Eastern Part of the Parish, is a Seat of <HI>William Plummer,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> with a Stream called the <HI>Ash,</HI> on the East Front, which feeds a Canal and a Garden by the River-side. The chief Gardens are seen from the western Front, which being upon a Declivity, afford an handsome Prospect that Way.</P>
<P>A little South of <HI>Ware</HI> lies <HI>Amwell,</HI> a Village, famous for giving Rise to the <HI>New River,</HI> which pro∣ceeding in a direct Course by the Church, receives a Spring which flows with great abundance. It is 20 Miles from <HI>London</HI>; but the Course of the River is computed at 36. It was begun by Sir <HI>Hugh Middleton</HI>; but he being ruined by the Project, the City of <HI>London</HI> undertook it, and by Aid of an Act of Parliament, brought it to Perfection. The yearly Profit of the River has, some Years ago, been computed at 30000<HI>l.</HI> and the Expence in supporting and keeping it up, is said to amount to half the Profit. 'Twas divided originally into 72 Shares, one Moiety whereof belonged to private Persons, and the other to the Crown: For King <HI>James</HI> I. for the sake of his Palace at <HI>Theobalds,</HI> was a great Pro∣moter of it. The Crown's Moiety is since come into private Hands; who however have no Part in the
<PB N="200" REF="201"/>
Management; for the Corporation consists of 29 of the Proprietors of the first 36 Shares.</P>
<P>This River, in Fact, draws most of its Water from the <HI>Lee</HI>; which being the Property of the City of <HI>London,</HI> that Corporation opposed a Bill brought into Parliament, for giving further Powers to the <HI>New River</HI> Company, to benefit itself by the <HI>Lee</HI> River: But the Opposition availed not, and in the Session 1738-9 the Bill passed into a Law.</P>
<P>The Governors of the <HI>New River</HI> Company agreed with the Proprietors of the Lands on the River <HI>Lee,</HI> for a Cut of Two cubick Feet of Water from the said River, at a certain Rate; and after the Agreement, they told them they would double the Price for a Four-foot Cut; which the Proprietors agreed to, not considering the great Disproportion of the Two Cuts. And this Cut of the River <HI>Lee</HI> supplies the largest Share of the <HI>New River</HI> Water.</P>
<P>We kept along the great Road, thro' <HI>Hoddesdon,</HI> (which is a considerable Market-town, and noted also as a Thoroughfare) till we came to <HI>Broxbourn,</HI> which lies near it on the <HI>New River</HI>; a small, but pleasant Village, situated on a rising Ground, having plea∣sant Meadows down to the River <HI>Lee.</HI> On the Left∣hand of the Village is <HI>Broxbournbury,</HI> the Seat of the Lord <HI>Monson.</HI> The House is large, and in the old <HI>Gothick</HI> Style, and situated in the Middle of the Park (which has been planted and beautified of late). There are also new Offices erected at a little Distance from the House, in a Quadrangle, on the same Plan with the King's <HI>Meuse</HI> at <HI>Charing-cross.</HI> They are placed behind a large Plantation of Trees, so that they do not appear until you are near upon them, yet are at a convenient Distance from the Mansion-house, which I was informed his Lordship also proposes to rebuild.</P>
<P>The Manor of <HI>Theobalds</HI> is in this Neighbourhood, where formerly was built a magnificent Seat by Lord
<PB N="201" REF="202"/>
Treasurer <HI>Burleigh,</HI> who gave it his younger Son Sir <HI>Robert Cecil,</HI> and he exchanged it for that of <HI>Hat∣field,</HI> at the Desire of King <HI>James</HI> I. who made it his Sporting Seat; and here ended his Life. From this Place <HI>Charles</HI> I. set out to erect his Standard at <HI>Nottingham.</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> II. made a Grant of it to <HI>Monck,</HI> Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> and to his Male Issue, which failing in his Son <HI>Christopher,</HI> King <HI>William</HI> gave it to <HI>Bentinck,</HI> Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> in whose Grandson, the present Duke, it still conti∣nues. In the late Civil Wars the Palace was plun∣dered and defaced; and is become a poor Village, from a Royal Residence. The great Park, which was inclosed within a Wall of 10 Miles Compass, by King <HI>James,</HI> is now converted into Farms. The Place is however popular, and the <HI>New River</HI> runs just by, and sometimes thro' the Gardens of the Inhabitants. In this Neighbourhood <HI>Richard Cromwell,</HI> the abdi∣cated Protector, passed the last Part of his Life in a very private Manner.</P>
<P><HI>Waltham-cross</HI> is the next, and, as you enter <HI>Middlesex</HI> by the North Road, the last Place in <HI>Hert∣fordshire,</HI> standing just on the Edge of <HI>Middle∣sex.</HI> It is noted for, and takes its Name from, the Cross, built by King <HI>Edward</HI> I. in Honour of his beloved Queen <HI>Eleanor,</HI> whose Corps, in its Way from <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> to <HI>Westminster,</HI> rested here; as a Cross was built at every Stage where it rested, and <HI>Charing-cross</HI> was the last. That Princess's Effigies placed round the Pillar and the Arms of her Royal Consort, as well as her own, <HI>viz. England, Castile, Leon,</HI> and <HI>Poictou,</HI> are still remaining, tho' much defaced.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> NOW proceed to give you an Account of my next Journey thro' Part of <HI>Bucks,</HI> into <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> and shall touch upon some Parts of <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> of which I have not-yet taken notice.</P>
<P>On the Right-hand, as we ride from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Uxbridge</HI> or to <HI>Colebrook,</HI> we see <HI>Harrow</HI>; the Church of which standing on the Summit of an Hill, and having a very high Spire, they tell us, King <HI>Charles</HI> II. ridiculing the warm Disputes among some critical Scripturalists of those Times, concerning the <HI>Visible</HI> Church of Christ upon Earth; used to say, This was it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Uxbridge</HI> we proceeded on the Road towards <HI>Oxford,</HI> and came to <HI>Beaconsfield,</HI> a small Town on the Road to <HI>Oxford,</HI> full of good Inns, and situated on a dry Hill, famous for the Residence of Mr. <HI>Edmund Waller,</HI> eminent for his poetical Talent.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="204"/>Then we went on to <HI>Wickham,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>High</HI> or <HI>Chipping Wycoomb,</HI> from <HI>Coomb,</HI> a <HI>British</HI> Word for Valley. This is a large Town, consisting of one great principal Street, branching out into divers small ones. It is full of good Houses and Inns, being a great Thorough-fare from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Wickham</HI> lies <HI>Amersham</HI> or <HI>Agmon∣desham,</HI> a small Market-town, very antient; and a little beyond it you go thro' <HI>Chesham,</HI> a little in∣considerable Market-town; and likewise <HI>Wendover,</HI> a mean, dirty corporate Town. From hence we proceeded to <HI>Aylesbury,</HI> which is the largest and best Town in the County.—It stands on a Hill, but the Country round it is low and dirty. It consists of several large Streets, and has a handsome built Market-house, which stands in a kind of Quadrangle. It has also a Town-house, where the Assizes and Sessions, and other publick Meetings of the County, are held. Provisions are here cheap and plentiful, which is owing to the rich Vale adjoining. It was a strong Town in the Beginning of the <HI>Saxons</HI> Time, and a Manor Royal in that of the <HI>Conqueror</HI>'s, who parcell'd it out under this odd Tenure, That the Tenants should find <HI>Litter or Straw for the King's Bed-chambers</HI> Three times a Year, if he came that Way so often, and provide him Three Eels in Winter, and Three Green Geese in Summer; which would be but a mean Entertainment at Bed and Board for a King in these Days.</P>
<P>All round this Town is a large Track of the richest Land in <HI>England,</HI> extended for many Miles almost from <HI>Tame,</HI> on the Edge of <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> to <HI>Leighton</HI> in <HI>Bedfordshire,</HI> and is called from this very Town, <HI>The Vale of Aylesbury.</HI> It is famous for fat∣tening Cattle and Sheep, and 'tis frequent that they sell a Ram here for Breeding for Ten Pounds. Here it was, that conversing with some Gentlemen who understood Country Affairs, (for all Gentlemen here∣abouts
<PB N="204" REF="205"/>
are Graziers, tho' all the Graziers are not Gentlemen) they shewed me one remarkable in∣closed Field of Pasture-ground, which was lett for 1400<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> to a Grazier; and I knew the Tenant very well, whose Name was <HI>Houghton,</HI> who confirmed the Truth of it.</P>
<P>The late Duke of <HI>Wharton</HI> had a very fine Seat at <HI>Winchenden,</HI> and another much finer nearer <HI>Windsor,</HI> called <HI>Ubourn.</HI> But the Catastrophe that has befallen this once flourishing and truly noble Family, is too melancholy, and too well known, to be animadverted upon here.</P>
<P>Near this Place lies <HI>Chilton,</HI> famous for giving Birth to that steddy Patriot the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Crook,</HI> who strenuously opposed the arbitrary Mea∣sures of levying Ship-money without the Authority of Parliament.</P>
<P>South-west of <HI>Aylesbury</HI> lies the Market-town of <HI>Tame,</HI> situated on the Side of a Meadow, and almost incompassed with Rivulets. It consists of one long broad Street. The Church is large and fine, in Form of a Cross; near which are the Ruins of a Priory. A Pot of <HI>Roman</HI> Coin was found here about 15 Years since.</P>
<P>The <HI>Thame</HI> joins the other Branch, named also the <HI>Thames,</HI> at <HI>Dorchester,</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire.</HI> In this Vale of <HI>Aylesbury</HI> flourished the great and antient Family of <HI>Hampden,</HI> for many Ages, in the Enjoy∣ment of very large Estates, which, like that of <HI>Wharton,</HI> are now dissipated.</P>
<P>At the Confluence of the <HI>Thame</HI> and <HI>Isis,</HI> stands <HI>Dorchester,</HI> a Town of Note among the antient <HI>Romans,</HI> and in the Year 634 was made a Bishop's See, till <HI>Remigius,</HI> in 1094, removed it to <HI>Lincoln.</HI> It has a very large Church, and a fine large Stone Bridge, of great Length and Antiquity.</P>
<P>East of <HI>Aylesbury</HI> lies <HI>Ivingo,</HI> a pleasant Market-town situate among Woods, in a Nook, or kind of
<PB N="205" REF="206"/>
Peninsula, which runs in between <HI>Bedfordshire</HI> and <HI>Hertfordshire.</HI></P>
<P>We passed forward North-west thro' <HI>Win<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low,</HI> a small Market-town, to <HI>Buckingham,</HI> the County-Town, situated in a low, fruitful Ground, surrounded by the <HI>Ouze</HI> on all Sides but the North. 'Tis govern'd by a Bailiff and Capital Burgesses. The Castle is now old and ruinous, and the Buildings of the Town are also old. It has Three Stone Bridges over the River, and a well-built Church, and a Chapel built by Archbishop <HI>Becket,</HI> which is now used for a Free-school. Several Paper-mills are erected on the <HI>Ouze,</HI> and the Town is divided into two Parts; one where the Church stands, and the other where the Town∣hall is. The County Gaol, and Court, are kept here, and sometimes the Assizes.</P>
<P>Going still farther Northward, we come to the following Towns:</P>
<P><HI>Stony Stratford</HI> is remarkable for standing on the <HI>Roman</HI> Causeway, called <HI>Watling-street.</HI> It is an antient and well-known Thoroughfare Town in the <HI>Chester</HI> Road from <HI>London.</HI> It is large, and well-built of Stone, has Two Churches in it, and a Cross erected by <HI>Edward</HI> I. to the Honour of his Queen <HI>Eleanor,</HI> and has a good Stone Bridge over the River. The principal Manufacture, as well in the Neigh∣bourhood as in the Town, is Bone-lace.</P>
<P><HI>Newport-pagnell</HI> is a large well-built, populous Town, seated on the River <HI>Ouze,</HI> over which it has Two large Stone Bridges. It carries on a great Trade in Bone-lace, and the same Manufacture imploys also the neighbouring Villages.</P>
<P><HI>Oulney</HI> is a pretty good Town, where also is carried on a considerable Manufacture of Bone-lace. It lies on the Extremity of the County.</P>
<P>We then fell down, back again, to <HI>Buckingham</HI>; and following the great Road North-west, we came to <HI>Brackley,</HI> in <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> situate on the River
<PB N="206" REF="207"/>
<HI>Ouze,</HI> an antient large corporate Town, in which are Two Parish Churches. It had formerly a College, but it is now used for a Free-school. It is governed by a Mayor and Aldermen; and the Market used to be the Staple for Wool, in that County; but it is now removed.</P>
<P>We next came to <HI>Banbury</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> on the River <HI>Charwell.</HI> It is a large Market-town under the Government of a Mayor and Aldermen. It has a considerable Trade, especially in Cheese, as all the Country round it is a rich feeding Meadow-ground. Here the famous <HI>Make-king,</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> surprised the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> and his Brother, of the Party of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. and beheaded them.</P>
<P>On the Borders of this County Westward from this Town in <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> was the famous Battle of <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> fought between the Forces of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and those of the Parliament; where, tho' the Victory was dubious, yet the Advantage, in the Event, inclined to the King's Side; for he thereupon took Lord <HI>Say</HI>'s House at <HI>Broughton,</HI> and <HI>Banbury</HI> Castle, in which were 800 Foot, and a Troop of Horse.</P>
<P><HI>Edge-hill</HI> lies at the West End of the Vale of <HI>Red∣horse,</HI> and gives a most extensive Prospect. It is steep to the North, and on the Top of it, at <HI>Warmlington,</HI> is a strong large Entrenchment, said to be <HI>Danish,</HI> but looks more like <HI>British.</HI> On the Descent of the Hill, between <HI>Radway</HI> and <HI>Keynton,</HI> was fought the aforementioned Battle; here also they shew where the Slain were bury'd, and have a Tra∣dition, that King <HI>John</HI> had a Palace, and resided at <HI>Keyntor.</HI></P>
<P>There was likewise, at <HI>Cropredy</HI> Bridge, an En∣counter between the <HI>Royalists</HI> and the <HI>Parliament∣arians</HI> under <HI>Waller</HI>'s Command.</P>
<P>West of <HI>Edge-hill</HI> stands <HI>Shipton,</HI> a little Town, which has a very large Market.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208"/><HI>Banbury</HI> gave Title of Earl to the noble Family of <HI>Knolles,</HI> which it seems became extinct in 1632, when the last Earl died; but his Wife, marrying <HI>Nicolas</HI> Lord <HI>Vaux,</HI> had a Son by him, who took the Name of <HI>Knolles,</HI> and the Title of Earl; but was never summoned to Parliament, nor his Son after him, who is now living, and commonly called Lord <HI>Banbury.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we rode Southward to <HI>Deddington,</HI> a large Town, but a very small Market. It is govern'd by a Bailiff, and did formerly return Members to Parliament.</P>
<P>We turned a little East, and came to <HI>Bicester,</HI> a straggling indifferent Town; but remarkable for having had once a famous City in its Neighbourhood, called <HI>Aldchester,</HI> long since passed over by the Plough; and where many <HI>Roman</HI> Coins, Stones, and other Antiquities are found; which was undoubtedly the <HI>Maima</HI> of <HI>Ravennas. Bicester</HI> is famous for excellent Malt Liquor, and has had formerly a Re∣ligious House.</P>
<P><HI>Islip</HI> lying directly in our Way to <HI>Oxford,</HI> we passed thro' it. It is remarkable for the Birth of <HI>Edward the Confessor,</HI> and that Dr. <HI>South,</HI> as well as other eminent Divines, were Ministers here. There are some Remains of an antient Palace still left.</P>
<P>From hence I came to <HI>Oxford,</HI> famous for several Things, but chiefly for its being the most flourishing and considerable University in the World.</P>
<P>There has been a long Contest between the Two <HI>English</HI> Universities, about the Priority of their Foundations, which perhaps will never be decided, and so I pass it over.</P>
<P>It is out of Question, that in the Largeness of the Place, the Beauty of Situation, the Number of Inhabitants, and of Scholars, <HI>Oxford</HI> has the Advan∣tage. In short, <HI>Oxford</HI> has several Things as an
<PB N="208" REF="209"/>
University, which <HI>Cambridge</HI> has not; and <HI>Cam∣bridge</HI> has several Things in it, which cannot be found in <HI>Oxford.</HI> For Example,</P>
<P>The Theatre, the Museum or Chamber of Ra∣rities, the <HI>Bodleian</HI> Library, the Number of Colleges, and the Magnificence of their Buildings, are on the Side of <HI>Oxford</HI>; yet <HI>King's</HI> College Chapel, and Col∣lege, is in favour of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> being one of the finest Structures of its kind that can be seen; and the new Buildings erected lately there, make that whole University still more considerable in this way.</P>
<P><HI>Oxford</HI> is a noble flourishing City, so possessed of all that can contribute to make the Residence of the Scholars easy and comfortable, that no Spot of Ground in <HI>England</HI> goes beyond it. It is situated in a delight∣ful Plain, on the Bank of a fine navigable River, in a plentiful Country, and at an easy Distance from <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The City itself is large, populous and rich: and as it is adorn'd by the most beautiful Buildings of Colleges and Halls, it makes the most noble Figure of any City of its Bigness in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>We shall present our Readers with a List of the Colleges and Halls in this famous City, with a brief History of them; but must observe, that as it would exceed our Limits to give an Account of the particular Benefactions by which their Revenues and Buildings are so splendidly augmented, we shall only mention such of those Benefactions as have been conferred within so few Years back, that they are not likely to be found in other Authors.</P>

It has a President, Twelve Fellows, Twelve Scholars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It has Two Quadrangles. In the first are the Chapel, the Hall, and the Library. The Chapel was rebuilt <HI>Anno</HI> 1693, and the Work of it, both within and without, is wonderfully elegant. The Altar∣piece is of Cedar inlaid: the Rails and Screen of Cedar, and all adorn'd with exquisite Carving. The Roof is inrich'd with Fretwork, and an admirable Piece of Painting, representing our Saviour's Ascen∣sion. The Pavement, from the Screen to the Altar, is of black and white Marble. On the East Side of the College is a delightful Garden; and at the En∣trance and End of the great Walk that goes thro' it, very noble Iron Gates, which have a Prospect open to the whole East Side of the College.</P>

<HEAD>20. HERTFORD COLLEGE.</HEAD>
<P>This is a College of a very late Erection indeed; for it was but in <HI>Sept.</HI> 1740, that his Majesty's Royal Charter passed the Broad Seal, to erect HART-HALL, as it was before called, into a College; to consist of a Principal, as before; Four Seniors, and Eight Junior Fellows: so that at last the Reverend Dr. <HI>Richard Newton,</HI> the worthy Principal, after an Opposition of several Years, given by some who ought to have assisted his generous View, has obtained a Point which lay very near his Heart: tho' not till several of his worthy Friends (who would have contributed largely to its Endow∣ment, had it been effected in their Time) are de∣mised,
<PB N="222" REF="223"/>
which must necessarily be a great Dis∣advantage to the good Design.</P>
<P>This College, as it now must be called, stands in the Parish of <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s in the East. It is supposed to have its Name from the first Syllable of <HI>Elias Hartford</HI>'s Surname, who was once Owner of it. <HI>Walter Stapledon,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Exeter,</HI> having bought it, converted it, <HI>Anno</HI> 1314, into an Academical Seminary, by the Name of <HI>Stapledon-hall,</HI> and en∣dowed it with Maintenance for Twelve Scholars, which he removed afterwards to <HI>Exeter</HI> College, on building the same; and then this Hall resumed its own Name. It has a Stipend or Exhibition be∣longing to it, of more than 16<HI>l. per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>It consists of one Quadrangle, not very regular, and the present worthy Principal has made several, and had projected still greater Additions to it, which would have taken place long ago, but for the Reasons above given.</P>

<P>These are the Twenty Colleges, of which at present this famous University consists. There are besides Five Halls, which are Places unendow'd, tho' not destitute of Exhibitions.

<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="abstract of will">
<P>He left an Establishment of 600<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> for Two young Physicians to travel, to be enjoyed by them for Ten Years; after which, or in case of Death, others were to succeed them, for ever.</P>
<P>The Remainder of the Estate charged to secure this annual Sum, he left to <HI>University</HI> College, <HI>Oxon,</HI> for purchasing perpetual Advowsons for the Members of the same.</P>
<P>To <HI>St. Bartholomew</HI>'s Hospital, <HI>London,</HI> he left 500<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> for ever, towards mending their Diet, as his Will expresses it; and 100<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> more for ever, for buying of Linen.</P>
<P>Five hundred Pounds, to build the Front of <HI>University</HI> College answerable to what was be∣fore built, and for building the Master's Lodgings therein, and Chambers for his Two travelling Fellows.</P>
<P>Forty thousand Pounds for building a Library in <HI>Oxon,</HI> and purchasing the Houses between <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s and the Schools in <HI>Cat-street,</HI> for that Purpose; and when built, he bequeathed 150<HI>l. per Annum</HI> to the Library-keeper, and 100<HI>l.</HI> a Year for ever to buy Books for the same.</P>

<P>His Will bears Date <HI>Sept.</HI> the 13th 1714; and the Doctor died <HI>Nov.</HI> 1. the same Year.</P>
<P>We shall now add, That every thing being done in pursuance of this Will, which the Time since his Death would permit, it may be easily conceived what a glorious Addition the Buildings finished, and finishing by its Direction, must be to this renowned University.</P>

<P>You will refer, Sir, to the Accounts I have already given of the Colleges, and to the above Abstracts of Dr. <HI>Radcliff</HI>'s, and Dr. <HI>Clarke</HI>'s Wills, and you will have a View of the State of these Colleges, even when the Works are finished as directed by those Gentle∣men, and which will hold for Years to come without material Alteration, except in case of new Bene∣factions.</P>
<P>I shall now give a Summary of what a Traveller may observe further in <HI>Oxford, en passant</HI>; and re∣fer the more curious Inquirer to the Histories of the Place, for a more ample and particular Account, than I have room to give.</P>
<P>Besides these Colleges and Halls, there are some publick Buildings, which make a most glorious Ap∣pearance: The first and greatest of all is the <HI>Theatre,</HI> a Building not to be equall'd by any thing of its Kind and Bigness in the World. Sir <HI>Christopher Wren</HI> was the Director of the Work. Archbishop <HI>Sheldon</HI> paid for it, and gave it to the University: there is a world of Decoration in the Front of it, and more beautiful Additions, by way of Ornament; and the inside Roof, finely painted and decorated, is never enough to be admired.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bodleian</HI> Library is an Ornament in itself worthy of this famous University. I have not Room for its History at large, but shall briefly observe, that the first publick Library in <HI>Oxford</HI> was erected in <HI>Durham</HI> College, now <HI>Trinity,</HI> by <HI>Richard</HI> Bishop of
<PB N="228" REF="229"/>
<HI>Durham,</HI> Lord Treasurer to <HI>Edward</HI> III. it was afterward joined to another, founded by <HI>Cobham</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> and both inlarged by the Bounty of <HI>Humphry</HI> Duke of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> Founder of the Divinity Schools. But these Libraries being lost, and the Books embezzled, and the Place where they were deposited, quite ruinous, Sir <HI>Thomas Bodley,</HI> a wealthy and learned Knight, having, at a vast Expence, collected Books and Manuscripts from all Parts of the World, placed them in the old Library-room, built by the good Duke <HI>Humphry.</HI></P>
<P>This great Work was brought to an Head the 8th of <HI>Nov.</HI> 1602, and has continued increasing by the Benefactions of great and learned Men to this Day; such as Archbishop <HI>Laud,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Pembroke, Oliver Cromwell, Selden, Digby,</HI> and other great Names.</P>
<P>Over it is a spacious Gallery, adorned with Pictures of Founders, Benefactors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and with the antique Marbles, which were the learned Part of the inex∣haustible Collection of the Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> which have been illustrated with the accurate Comments of <HI>Selden</HI> and <HI>Prideaux.</HI> Here are some of the most valuable <HI>Greek</HI> Monuments now in the World. Over the Porch, upon an handsome Pedestal of black Mar∣ble, stands the Brass Effigies of the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> their noble and generous Chancellor, given by the late Earl, moulded by <HI>Rubens.</HI> Also a very large Collection of <HI>Greek, Roman, British, Saxon, Eng∣lish,</HI> and other Coins, presented by Sir <HI>T. Roe,</HI> and other Hands. And that indefatigable and learned Collector of Books, and valuable Manuscripts, Dr. <HI>Tanner,</HI> Bishop of St. <HI>Asaph,</HI> who died <HI>December</HI> 12. 1735, bequeathed the most curious Part of his fine Collection to this noble Library.</P>
<P>In the Year 1740, by the Death of Mrs. <HI>Crew,</HI> Relict of <HI>George Crew,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> an Estate of 80<HI>l. per Annum</HI> is fallen to the Head Librarian's Post, which
<PB N="229" REF="230"/>
before was very inconsiderable, tho' it required a constant Residence. This was a Legacy of the late Right Reverend and Right Honourable <HI>Nathanael Crew,</HI> Lord Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> who was such a good Benefactor to <HI>Lincoln</HI> College as we have mentioned.</P>
<P>Other curious Things in <HI>Oxford</HI> are, the Schools, (which are now beautifully repaired, and the Names and Arms of old Benefactors renewed and repainted) the Museum, the Chamber of Rarities, the Collec∣tion of Coins, Medals, Pictures, and antient Inscrip∣tions, the Printing-house, the Physick-garden, the University and other Churches, the Convocation-house, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all worthy of a particular Description, had I room to give it.</P>
<P>The University is govern'd by a Chancellor, chosen by Scrutiny or Collection of Votes; he is generally one of the first Noblemen of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>By a High-steward, chosen by the Chancellor.</P>
<P>By a Vice-chancellor, who must be one of the Heads of a College, recommended to the University by the Chancellor.</P>
<P>By Two Proctors, chosen annually by Turn out of the Colleges.</P>
<P>The other Officers are the publick Orator, and the Keeper of the Archives, Beadles, Virger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' I have said so much of the University, I must not quite forget the City. Let me then ob∣serve, That before <HI>Baliol</HI> College they shew the Stone in the Street, which marks the Place of the Martyrdom of Archbishop <HI>Cranmer</HI> and Bishop <HI>Ridley,</HI> then upon the Banks of the Ditch, without the City Walls, which went along where the Theatre now stands.</P>
<P>Beyond the River, stood <HI>Oseny</HI> Abbey, founded 1129. Upon the Bridge is a Tower, call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Frier</HI> Bacon<HI>'s Study,</HI> from that famous and learned Monk.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="231"/>Over another Bridge, on the <HI>Isis,</HI> we went to see <HI>Ruleigh</HI> Abbey, where some Ruins still remain, turn'd to a common Brewhouse.</P>
<P>Of the Castle remains a square high Tower, by the River-side, and a lofty Mount, or Keep, walled at Top, with a Stair-case going downward.</P>
<P>The <HI>White-friers</HI> was a Royal Palace, and near a Green called <HI>Beaumonds,</HI> they shew'd us the Bottom of a Tower upon the Spot where the valiant <HI>Richard</HI> I. was born.</P>
<P>Without the Town, on all Hands, are to be seen the Fortifications erected in the late Civil Wars.</P>
<P>As to the City, tho' the Colleges make up Two-thirds of it, and are still elbowing for more Room, yet 'tis large and regular, the Streets are spacious, clean, and strait; the Place pleasant and healthful, the Inhabitants genteel and courteous; the Churches many and elegant, especially <HI>Allhallows</HI>; and taking it altogether, and including the Grandeur and En∣dowment of the Colleges, their Chapels, Halls, Li∣braries, Quadrangles, Piazza's, Gardens, Walks, Groves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it must be consider'd as the first Uni∣versity in the World, as I have before mention'd.</P>
<P>On the Left-hand, on the other Side the River, the last Remains of <HI>Godstow</HI> Nunnery are situated among the sweet Meadows. Here fair <HI>Rosamond</HI> had a remarkably fine Tomb; but before the Disso∣lution, scarce could her Ashes rest, <HI>whose Beauty was thought guilty,</HI> as one says, <HI>even after Death.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot leave <HI>Oxford</HI> without making one Ob∣servation, with regard to those who insist, that it was to the Piety of the Popish Times which we owe the first Institution of the University itself, the Foundation and Endowment of the particular Col∣leges, and the Encouragement arising to Learning from thence: all which I readily grant; but would have them remember too, that tho' those Foundations stood, as they tell us, 800 Years, and that the Re∣formation,
<PB N="231" REF="232"/>
as they say, is not above 200 Years standing, yet Learning has more increased, and the Universities flourish'd more; more great Scholars been produced, greater Libraries been raised, and more fine Buildings been erected, in these 200 Years, than in the 800 Years of Popery; and I might add, as many great Benefactions have been given, not∣withstanding this very momentous Difference, that the Protestants Gifts are merely Acts of Charity to the World, and Acts of Bounty, in Reverence to Learning, and learned Men, without the grand In∣citement of the State of their own Souls, and those of their Fathers, which were to be pray'd out of Purgatory, and get a ready Admission into Heaven.</P>
<P><HI>Oxford</HI> was for many Years advantaged by the Neighbourhood of the Royal Court, while several Kings of <HI>England,</HI> being taken with the fine Situation of <HI>Woodstock,</HI> made their Palace there the Place of their Summer Retreat.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Plott</HI> allows it to have been a Royal House ever since King <HI>Alfred</HI>; and a Manuscript in the <HI>Cotton</HI> Library confirms it; and that King <HI>Henry</HI> I. was not the Founder of it, but only rebuilt it. And as for <HI>Henry</HI> II. who kept his fair <HI>Rosamond</HI> in it, he made only some Additions to it, for the Entertain∣ment and Security of his beautiful Mistress. Not∣withstanding which, the Queen, having got Access to her in the King's Absence, as Tradition informs us, dispatch'd her by Poison.</P>
<P>When I was first at <HI>Woodstock</HI> some Years ago, I saw part of the old Palace, and the famous Labyrinth of fair <HI>Rosamond</HI>; but now these are destroy'd. Her <HI>Bathing-place</HI> or <HI>Well,</HI> as it is called, is left; a quadrangular Receptacle of pure Water, immediately flowing from a little Spring under the Hill, over∣shadow'd with Trees; near which are some Ruins of Walls and Arches. King <HI>Ethelred</HI> called a Parlia∣ment here. It has been a Royal Seat, as I have said,
<PB N="232" REF="233"/>
from most antient Times. <HI>Henry</HI> I. inclosed the Park. Across this Valley was a remarkably fine Echo, that would repeat a whole Hexameter, but impair'd by the Removal of these Buildings. A stately Bridge, or Rialto rather, now leads along the grand Approach to the present Castle: one Arch is above 190 Feet Diameter; a Cascade of Water falls from a Lake down some stone Steps into the Canal that runs under it.</P>
<P>The new Palace of <HI>Blenheim</HI> is a vast and magni∣ficent Pile of Building; a Royal Gift to the high Merit of the invincible Duke of <HI>Marlborough.</HI> The lofty Hall is painted by Sir <HI>James Thornhill,</HI> the Ceiling by <HI>la Guerre.</HI> The Rooms are finely inrich'd with Marble Chimney-pieces and Furniture, but more by the incomparable Paintings and Hangings, which latter represent the principal Glories of the Duke's Life. Among the Pictures are many of <HI>Rubens</HI>'s best and largest Pieces; that celebrated one of himself, his Wife and Child, among others: <HI>Van∣dyke</HI>'s King <HI>Charles</HI> I. upon a Dun Horse, of great Value: and the famous Loves of the Gods, by <HI>Titian</HI>; a Present from the King of <HI>Sardinia.</HI> The Gallery is worthy Admiration, lined with Marble Pilasters, and whole Pillars of one Piece, supporting a most costly and curious Entablature, excellent for Matter and Workmanship, the Window-frames of the same, and a Basement of black Marble quite round. Before it, is stretched out a most agreeable Prospect of the fine Woods beyond the great Valleys. What is of the most elegant Taste in the whole House, is of the Duchess's own Designing. The Chapel is equal to the rest. The Garden is a very large Plot of Ground taken out of the Park, and may still be said to be a Part of it, well-contriv'd by sinking the outer Wall into a Foss, to give a View quite round, and take off the odious Appearance of Con∣finement and Limitation to the Eye. It is within
<PB N="233" REF="234"/>
well adorn'd with Walks, Greens, Espaliers, and Vista's, to divers remarkable Objects, that offer them∣selves in the circumjacent Country. Over the Pedi∣ment of this Front of the House is a curious Marble Busto of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. bigger than the Life, taken from the Gate of the Citadel of <HI>Tournay.</HI> The Orangery is a pretty Room. Near the Gate of the Palace is the House where our famous <HI>Chaucer</HI> was born. At the Entrance into the Castle from the Town, her Grace has erected a noble triumphal Arch, to the Memory of the Duke; and has set up a vast Obelisk in the principal Avenue of the Park, whereon is inscribed the best Account of the Duke's Actions and Character, that ever was penn'd in the same Compass; and if done by the masterly Hand of that extraordinary Genius, to whom I have heard it attributed, must be a double Triumph to the Memory of the Duke, since his Merits extorted so noble a Testimony from a Person who was once engaged in Measures quite opposite to those, which derived upon his Grace so exalted a Reputation, and who was thought to be at that Time one of his principal Adversaries.</P>
<P>The Inscription does so much Honour to the Me∣mory of the Duke, and at the same time to the <HI>British</HI> Nation, that I cannot deny to myself the Pleasure of inserting it here, as follows:
<Q>The Castle of <HI>Blenheim</HI> was founded by Queen <HI>ANNE,</HI><LB/>In the Fourth Year of her Reign,<LB/>In the Year of the Christian Aera 1705;<LB/>A Monument design'd to perpetuate the Memory of the<LB/>Signal Victory<LB/>Obtained over the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Bavarians,</HI><LB/>Near the Village of <HI>Blenheim,</HI><LB/>On the Banks of the <HI>Danube,</HI><LB/>By JOHN Duke of MARLBOROUGH;<LB/>The Hero not only of this Nation, but of this Age:<LB/>Whose Glory was equal in the Council and in the Field;<LB/><PB N="234" REF="235"/>Who by Wisdom, Justice, Candour, and Address,<LB/>Reconciled various, and even opposite Interests;<LB/>Acquired an Influence<LB/>Which no Rank, no Authority can give,<LB/>Nor any Force but that of superior Virtue;<LB/>Became the fixed important Centre,<LB/>Which united, in one common Cause,<LB/>The principal States of <HI>Europe</HI>;<LB/>Who by military Knowlege, and irresistible Valour,<LB/>In a long Series of uninterrupted Triumphs,<LB/>Broke the Power of <HI>France,</HI><LB/>When raised the highest, when exerted the most;<LB/>Rescued the Empire from Desolation;<LB/>Asserted and confirmed the Liberties of <HI>Europe.</HI><P><HI>Philip,</HI> a Grandson of the House of <HI>France,</HI> united to the Interests, directed by the Policy, supported by the Arms of that Crown, was placed on the Throne of <HI>Spain.</HI> King WILLIAM III. beheld this formidable Union, of Two great, and once rival Monarchies. At the End of a Life spent in defending the Liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> he saw them in their greatest Danger. He provided for their Security in the most effectual Manner. He took the Duke of MARLBOROUGH into his Service.</P>
<P>Embassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary<LB/>To the <HI>States General</HI> of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI></P>
<P>The Duke contracted several Alliance before the Death of King WILLIAM. He confirmed and improved these. He contracted others, after the Accession of Queen ANNE; and reunited the Confederacy, which had been dissolved at the End of a former War, in a stricter and firmer League.</P>
<P>Captain-General and Commander in Chief<LB/>Of the Forces of GREAT BRITAIN,</P>
<P>The Duke led to the Field the Army of the Allies. He took with surprising Rapidity <HI>Venlo, Ruremonde, Ste∣venswaert</HI> and <HI>Liege.</HI> He extended and secured the Fron∣tiers
<PB N="235" REF="236"/>
of the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The Enemies, whom he found insulting at the Gates of <HI>Nimeghen,</HI> were driven to seek for Shelter behind their Lines. He forced <HI>Bonne, Huy, Limburgh,</HI> in another Campaign. He opened the Com∣munication of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> as well as the <HI>Maes.</HI> He added all the Country between these Rivers to his former Conquests. The Army of <HI>France,</HI> favoured by the Defection of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> had penetrated into the Heart of the <HI>Empire.</HI> This mighty Body lay exposed to immediate Ruin. In that memorable Crisis, the Duke of MARLBOROUGH led his Troops with un∣exampled Celerity, Secrecy, Order, from the <HI>Ocean</HI> to the <HI>Danube.</HI> He saw: He attacked: Nor stopped, but to conquer the Enemy. He forced the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> sustained by the <HI>French,</HI> in their strong Intrenchments at <HI>Schellenberg.</HI> He passed the <HI>Danube.</HI> A second Royal Army, composed of the best Troops of <HI>France,</HI> was sent to reinforce the first. That of the Confederates was divided. With one Part of it the Siege of <HI>Ingol∣stadt</HI> was carried on. With the other the Duke gave Battle to the united Strength of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Bavaria.</HI> On the 2d Day of <HI>August</HI> 1704, he gained a more glorious Victory than the Histories of any Age can boast. The Heaps of Slain were dreadful Proofs of his Valour. A Marshal of <HI>France,</HI> whole Legions of <HI>French,</HI> his Prisoners, proclaimed his Mercy. <HI>Bavaria</HI> was subdued, <HI>Ratisbon, Augsbourg, Ulm, Meminghen,</HI> all the Usurpa∣tions of the Enemy, were recovered. The Liberty of the <HI>Diet,</HI> the Peace of the <HI>Empire,</HI> were restored. From the <HI>Danube,</HI> the Duke turned his victorious Arms towards the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the <HI>Moselle. Landau, Treves, Traerbach,</HI> were taken. In the Course of one Campaign the very Nature of the War was changed. The Invaders of other States were reduced to defend their own. The Frontier of <HI>France</HI> was exposed in its weakest Part to the Efforts of the Allies.</P>
<P>That he might improve this Advantage, that he might push the Sum of Things to a speedy Decision, the Duke of MARLBOROUGH led his Troops early in the following Year once more to the <HI>Moselle.</HI> They, whom he had saved a few Months before, neglected to second
<PB N="236" REF="237"/>
him now. They, who might have been his Compa∣nions in Conquest, refused to join him. When he saw the generous Designs he had formed, frustrated by private Interest, by Pique, by Jealousy, he returned with Speed to the <HI>Maes.</HI> He returned; and Fortune and Victory returned with him. <HI>Liege</HI> was relieved; <HI>Huy</HI> retaken. The <HI>French,</HI> who had pressed the Army of the <HI>States-General</HI> with superior Numbers, retired behind In∣trenchments, which they deemed impregnable. The Duke forced these Intrenchments, with inconsiderable Loss, on the 7th Day of <HI>July</HI> 1705, He defeated a great Part of the Army which defended them. The rest escaped by a precipitate Retreat. If Advantages proportionable to this Success were not immediately obtained, let the Failure be ascribed to that Misfortune which attends most Confederacies; a Division of Opi∣nions, where one alone should judge; a Division of Power, where one alone should command. The Dis∣appointment itself did Honour to the Duke. It became the Wonder of Mankind how he could do so much under those Restraints, which had hindred him from doing more.</P>
<P>Powers more absolute were given him afterwards. The Increase of his Powers multiplied his Victories. At the opening of the next Campaign, when all his Army was not yet assembled; when it was hardly known, that he had taken the Field; the Noise of his Triumphs was heard over <HI>Europe.</HI> On the 12th of <HI>May</HI> 1706, he attacked the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Ramillies.</HI> In the Space of Two Hours the whole Army was put to Flight. The Vigour and Conduct, with which he improved this Success, were equal to those, wherewith he gained it. <HI>Louvain, Brussels, Malines, Liere, Ghent, Oudenard, Antwerp, Damme, Bruges, Courtray,</HI> surrendered. <HI>Os∣tend, Menin, Dendermond</HI> and <HI>Aeth,</HI> were taken. <HI>Bra∣bant</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI> were recovered. Places which had resisted the greatest Generals for Months, for Years; Provinces disputed for Ages; were the Conquests of a Summer. Nor was the Duke content to triumph alone. Solicitous for the general Interest, his Care
<PB N="237" REF="238"/>
extended to the remotest Scenes of the War. He chose to lessen his own Army, that he might enable the Leaders of other Armies to conquer. To this it must be ascribed that <HI>Turin</HI> was relieved; the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> reinstated; the <HI>French</HI> driven with Confusion out of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>These Victories gave the Confederates an Opportunity of carrying on the War on every Side into the Dominions of <HI>France.</HI> But she continu'd to enjoy a kind of peaceful Neutrality in <HI>Germany.</HI> From <HI>Italy</HI> she was once alarm'd, and had no more to fear. The intire Reduction of his Power, whose Ambition had caused, whose Strength supported the War, seemed reserved for him alone, who had so triumphantly begun the glori∣ous Work.</P>
<P>The Barrier of <HI>France,</HI> on the Side of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> had been forming for more than half a Century. What Art, Power, Expence could do, had been done to ren∣der it impenetrable. Yet here she was most exposed; for here the Duke of MARLBOROUGH threatened to attack her.</P>
<P>To cover what they had gained by Surprize, or had been yielded to them by Treachery, the <HI>French</HI> marched to the Banks of the <HI>Schelde.</HI> At their Head were the Princes of the Blood, and their most fortunate General the Duke of <HI>Vendosme.</HI> Thus commanded, thus post∣ed, they hoped to check the Victor in his Course. Vain were their Hopes. The Duke of MARLBOROUGH passed the River in their Sight. He defeated their whole Army. The Approach of Night concealed, the Proximity of <HI>Ghent</HI> favoured their Flight. They neglected nothing to repair their Loss, to defend their Frontier. New Generals, new Armies appeared in the <HI>Netherlands.</HI> All contributed to inhance the Glory, none were able to retard the Progress, of the confederate Army.</P>
<P><HI>Lisle,</HI> the Bulwark of this Barrier, was besieged. A nu∣merous Garison, and a Marshal of <HI>France,</HI> defended the Place. Prince EUGENE of <HI>Savoy</HI> commanded, the Duke of MARLBOROUGH covered and sustained the Siege. The Rivers were seized, and the Communication with
<PB N="238" REF="239"/>
<HI>Holland</HI> interrupted. The Duke opened new Commu∣nications with great Labour, and much greater Art. Through Countries over-run by the Enemy, the neces∣sary Convoys arriv'd in Safety. One alone was attacked. The Troops which attacked it were beat. The Defence of <HI>Lisle</HI> was animated by Assurances of Relief.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> assembled all their Force. They marched towards the Town. The Duke of MARLBOROUGH offered them Battle, without suspending the Siege. They abandoned the Enterprize. They came to save the Town. They were Spectators of its Fall.</P>
<P>From this Conquest the Duke hastened to others. The Posts taken by the Enemy on the <HI>Schelde</HI> were surprised. That River was passed the second time, and notwith∣standing the great Preparations made to prevent it, without Opposition.</P>
<P><HI>Brussels,</HI> besieged by the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> was relieved. <HI>Ghent</HI> surrendered to the Duke in the Middle of a Win∣ter remarkably severe. An Army, little inferior to his own, marched out of the Place.</P>
<P>As soon as the Season of the Year permitted him to open another Campaign, the Duke besieged and took <HI>Tour∣nay.</HI> He invested <HI>Mons.</HI> Near this City, the <HI>French</HI> Army, covered by thick Woods, defended by noble Intrenchments, waited to molest, nor presumed to offer Battle. Even this was not attempted by them with Impunity. On the last Day of <HI>August</HI> 1709, the Duke attacked them in their Camp. All was employed; nothing availed against the Resolution of such a General, against the Fury of such Troops. The Battle was bloody. The Event decisive. The Woods were pierced. The Fortifications trampled down. The Enemy fled. The Town was taken. <HI>Doway, Bethune, Aire, St. Venant, Bouchain,</HI> underwent the same Fate in Two succeeding Years. Their vigorous Resistance could not save them. The Army of <HI>France</HI> durst not attempt to relieve them. It seemed preserved to defend the Capital of the Monarchy.</P>
<P>The Prospect of this extreme Distress was neither distant nor dubious. The <HI>French</HI> acknowleged their Con∣queror, and sued for Peace.</P><PB N="239" REF="240"/>These are the Actions of the late Duke of MARLBOROUGH,<LB/>Performed in the Compass of a few Years,<LB/>Sufficient to adorn the Annals of Ages.<LB/>The Admiration of other Nations<LB/>Will be conveyed to latest Posterity,<LB/>In the Histories even of the Enemies of BRITAIN.<LB/>The Sense which the <HI>British</HI> Nation had<LB/>Of his transcendent Merit,<LB/>Was expressed<LB/>In the most solemn, most effectual, most durable manner.<LB/>The Acts of Parliament <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Several Recitals of Clauses in Acts of Parliament made to do Honour to this immortal Commander, are engraven on the same superb Pillar.</NOTE> inscribed on this Pillar<LB/>Shall stand<LB/>As long as the <HI>British</HI> Name and Language last,<LB/>Illustrious Monuments<LB/>Of MARLBOROUGH's Glory,<LB/>And<LB/>Of BRITAIN's Gratitude.</Q></P>
<P>At <HI>Woodstock</HI> they make the fine Steel Chains for Watches, and other Things of polish'd Steel.</P>
<P>From <HI>Woodstock</HI> I went North-west to <HI>Chipping-Norton,</HI> which must have been once a Town of great Trade, by the Number of Merchants, as they are called on the Brasses over their Monuments; and besides, the Name <HI>Chipping</HI> denotes as much. There are Marks of a Castle by the Church; and <HI>Roman</HI> Coins are frequently found here. The Church is a good Building, and after a curious Model.</P>
<P>Hence we rode to see <HI>Rowldrich</HI> Stones, a little <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> being a Circle of great Stones standing upright, some of them from Five to Seven Feet high, and probably the <HI>Vestigia</HI> of an old <HI>British</HI> Temple, as that was; and Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> positively asserts, that they were so.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="241"/>At <HI>Tidmerton</HI> Parish is a large Camp of an orbicular Form, on the Summit of an Hill, which is doubly intrenched, and able to contain a great Army.</P>
<P>When I was at <HI>Banbury,</HI> I should have mentioned <HI>Bloxham,</HI> which lies North of it; where is a fine Church, the Steeple of an odd, but agreeable Make.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Bloxham,</HI> is also the famous Parish of <HI>Bright-well,</HI> of which it was observed, that there had not been an Alehouse, nor a Dissenter from the Church, nor any Quarrel among the Inhabitants, that rose so high as to a Suit of Law, within the Memory of Man. But they could not say it was so still, espe∣cially as to the Alehouse Part; tho' very much is still preserved as to the Unity and good Neighbour∣hood of the Parishioners, and their Conformity to the Church.</P>
<P>Being now on the Side of <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> as is said before, I still went South, and passing by the <HI>Four Shire Stones,</HI> we saw where the Counties of <HI>Oxford, Warwick,</HI> and <HI>Gloucester,</HI> join all in a Point; one Stone standing in each County, and the fourth touch∣ing all Three.</P>
<P>Entering <HI>Gloucestershire</HI> here, Westward, we came, after a Mile's Ride, to <HI>Moretonhenmarsh,</HI> a small Town which had formerly a Market, but now discontinued: it lies on the great Road to <HI>Worcester.</HI> And the famous <HI>Roman</HI> Fosseway, which coming out of <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> enters this County at <HI>Lemington,</HI> which lies North-east of this Town, strikes thro' it, and also thro' <HI>Stow</HI> and <HI>North-Leach,</HI> down to <HI>Cirencester,</HI> Southward.</P>
<P>Hence we come to the famous <HI>Cotswold-downs,</HI> so eminent for the best of Sheep, and finest Wool in <HI>England:</HI> Fame tells us, that some of these Sheep were sent by King <HI>Richard</HI> I. into <HI>Spain,</HI> and that from hence the Breed of their Sheep was raised, which now produce so fine a Wool, that we are obliged to fetch it from thence at a great Price, for making our finest Broad Cloaths.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="242"/>Upon these Downs we had a clear View of the afore-mentioned famous <HI>Fosse,</HI> which evidently crosses all the Middle Part of <HI>England,</HI> and is to be seen and known (tho' in no Place plainer than here) quite from the <HI>Bath</HI> to <HI>Warwick,</HI> and thence to <HI>Leicester,</HI> to <HI>Newark,</HI> to <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and on to <HI>Barton,</HI> upon the Bank of <HI>Humber.</HI></P>
<P>We observed also how several cross Roads as antient as the <HI>Fosse,</HI> join'd it, or branched out of it; some of which the People have by antient Usage, tho' corruptly, called also <HI>Fosses:</HI> For Example,</P>
<P>The <HI>Ackmanstreet,</HI> which is an antient <HI>Saxon</HI> Road, leading from <HI>Buckinghamshire</HI> thro' <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> to the <HI>Fosse,</HI> and so to the <HI>Bath</HI>; this joins the <HI>Fosse</HI> be∣tween <HI>Burford</HI> and <HI>Cirencester.</HI> Also <HI>Grimes-dyke,</HI> from <HI>Oxfordshire, Wattle-bank,</HI> or <HI>Aves-ditch,</HI> from the same, and the <HI>Would-way,</HI> call'd also the <HI>Fosse,</HI> crossing from <HI>Gloucester</HI> to <HI>Cirencester.</HI></P>
<P>Many Seats of the Nobility are to be found in these Parts; <HI>Cornbury,</HI> Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s; <HI>Ditchley,</HI> Lord <HI>Litchfield</HI>'s; <HI>Hathorp,</HI> the late Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI>'s, new built of Stone very beautifully.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lech,</HI> the <HI>Coln,</HI> the <HI>Churn,</HI> and the <HI>Isis,</HI> all rise in the <HI>Cotswould</HI> Hills, and joining together, make a full Stream at <HI>Lechlade</HI> near this Place, and become one River there, and are called the <HI>Thames,</HI> which begins there to be navigable; and Barges may be seen at the Quay, taking in Goods for <HI>London:</HI> which makes <HI>Lechlade</HI> very populous. Of which Town more by-and-by.</P>
<P><HI>Stow on the Would,</HI> which is the next Town we came to, is but indifferent to look at; but is, or rather has been, remarkable for its Two annual Fairs, fa∣mous for Hops, Cheese, and Sheep, of which, 'tis said, that above 20,000 are generally sold at one Fair, and that the Toll of these Fairs and the Markets, amount to 80<HI>l.</HI> a Year. The Parish is very large, being 12 Miles in Compass, and consists of Meadow,
<PB N="242" REF="243"/>
Arable, and Pasture. Here is a good large Rectory Church standing on a Hill, with a high Tower on the South-side of it, which is seen a great Distance off. Here is also an Hospital, Alms-house, and Free-school, all well endow'd; besides other Charities.</P>
<P><HI>Northleche</HI> is also a Market-town, governed by a Bailiff and Two Constables, and is named from the River <HI>Leche,</HI> which runs through it. Here is a Vicarage Church, large and spacious, having Ayles on each Side, and handsome Windows, with a large Tower. Here is a Grammar-school, free for all the Boys of the Town, endow'd with 80<HI>l.</HI> a Year. And 'tis said, that the Founder, falling afterwards into Misfortunes, solicited for the Master's Place of his own School, but could not obtain it from the Trustees.</P>
<P>Here we quitted the <HI>Roman Fosse,</HI> and went East-ward to <HI>Burford</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire.</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> II. gave this Town a Charter, <HI>Guildam &amp; omnes consue∣tudines, quas habent liberi Burgenses de Oxenford</HI>; but they are almost all now lost: however it retains some Marks of a Corporation still, being governed by Two Bailiffs, and other inferior Officers. It is famous for Saddles, and, lying near the Downs, draws great Profit from the Horse-races, which are frequent here. At this Place was convened a Synod in 685, against the Error of the <HI>British</HI> Churches in the Observance of <HI>Easter.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Battle-edge,</HI> near this Town, <HI>Cuthred,</HI> King of the <HI>West Saxons,</HI> beat <HI>Ethelbald,</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> in a pitch'd Battle, and threw off his Yoke. The Inhabitants celebrate yearly, on <HI>Mid∣summer-eve,</HI> a kind of Festival, which, they say, commenced in Honour of this Battle. It was here the learned Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> (descended originally from an antient Family in <HI>Wales</HI>) was born; and the famous Speaker <HI>Lenthal</HI> had a Seat, and died here.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="244"/>Being so near <HI>Witney,</HI> we could not forbear taking a Ride to see a Town so famous for the Manufactures of Blanketing and Rugs, which thrive here in a most extraordinary manner. Here are at work 150 Looms continually, for which above 3000 People, from Eight Years old and upward, are daily imploy'd in Carding, Spinning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and consume above 100 Packs of Wool weekly. The Blankets are usually 10 or 12 Quarters wide, and very white, which some attribute to the abstersive nitrous Waters of the River <HI>Windrush,</HI> wherewith they are scoured; but others believe it is owing to a peculiar way of loose Spinning they use here; and others again are of Opinion, that it proceeds from both. But however that be, this Town has engrossed the whole Trade in that Commodity, and increases daily in its Repu∣tation. They likewise make here the <HI>Duffield</HI> Stuffs, a Yard and three Quarters wide, which are carried to <HI>New England</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> and now much worn even here in Winter. Here are likewise a great many Fellmongers, who having dressed and stained their Sheep-skins, make them into Jackets and Breeches, and sell them at <HI>Bampton</HI>; from whence they are dispersed all over the neighbouring Counties. Here is a good Free-school, and a fine Library be∣longing to it.</P>
<P><HI>Witney</HI> is an antient Town, and of good Repute before the Conquest; but it is a long, straggling, un∣couth Place, tho' full of Inhabitants. 'Twas one of the Manors which <HI>Alwinus,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester</HI> gave to the Church of <HI>St. Swithin</HI>'s there, on Queen <HI>Emma</HI>'s happily passing over the <HI>Fire Ordeal.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Astal,</HI> a Village in the Road between <HI>Burford</HI> and <HI>Witney,</HI> is a Barrow which stands very high, and is supposed to be the Sepulchre of some Person of great Note.</P>
<P>Southward lies <HI>Bampton,</HI> on the Borders of the County next <HI>Berkshire.</HI> It is an antient Market-town,
<PB N="244" REF="245"/>
likewise in Repute before the Conquest: it is noted for the greatest Market for Fellmonger-wares in <HI>England,</HI> which come from <HI>Witney,</HI> and for nothing else that I know of, saving that the People talk'd much of a Family of the <HI>Woods</HI> (that dwelt here and at <HI>Brisenorton</HI>) who hear always a great Knocking before any of them die.</P>
<P>Turning here West, we enter'd <HI>Gloucestershire</HI> again, and came to <HI>Lechlade,</HI> which lies on the great Road to <HI>Gloucester.</HI> It is probable, that it was antiently a <HI>Roman</HI> Town upon the <HI>Thames</HI>; for a very plain <HI>Roman</HI> Road runs from hence to <HI>Cirencester.</HI> Some say, that it was once a famous University for teaching <HI>Latin,</HI> as <HI>Creeklade</HI> was for <HI>Greek.</HI></P>
<P>The antient Building lately discovered by digging in a Meadow near <HI>Lechlade,</HI> deserves a particular Mention: it is 50 Feet long, 40 broad, and Four high; supported with 100 Brick Pillars, curiously inlaid with Stones of divers Colours, of Tesseraick Work; and supposed to be a <HI>Roman</HI> Bath.</P>
<P>Not far from it are the Two Towns called <HI>Sarney</HI>; so named, in <HI>British,</HI> from the <HI>Roman</HI> Causways; for <HI>Sarn,</HI> in that antient Language, and at present, imports a paved Way. The River <HI>Lech</HI> runs thro' it, and discharges itself into the <HI>Thames.</HI> A great Num∣ber of Barges go from hence to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Lechlade</HI> we proceeded West to <HI>Fairford,</HI> a small Market-town, thro' which runs the River <HI>Coln,</HI> which has Two large Bridges over it. A great many Medals and Urns have been often dug up here, and there are several Barrows in the adjoining Fields, (which seem to have been a Scene of warlike Actions) the Monuments of the Slain interred here.</P>
<P>A great many Charities are still subsisting in this Town; but what it is most noted for is its Church, and the admirable Painting in its Windows: of which take the following Description and History.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="246"/><HI>John Tame,</HI> a Merchant of <HI>London,</HI> purchased this Manor of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. (to whom it descended from the <HI>Beauchamps,</HI> Earls of <HI>Warwick</HI>) and have∣ing taken a Prize-ship bound for <HI>Rome,</HI> wherein he found a great Quantity of painted Glass, he brought both the Glass and the Workmen into <HI>England.</HI> The Glass was such a Curiosity, that Mr. <HI>Tame</HI> built this Church at <HI>Fairford</HI> (dedicating it to the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>); which is in Length 125 Feet, and 55 in Breadth; and has Three Chancels, a good Vestry, and a noble Tower, arising from the Midst of it, adorned with Pinacles; and the Windows of the Church, 28 in Number, he caused to be glazed with this invaluable Prize, which remains intire to this Day, the Admiration of all that see it.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Farmer</HI> (a Daughter of the Lord <HI>Lemster</HI>) gave 200<HI>l.</HI> to be laid out in mending and wiring the Windows: this has preserved them from Acci∣dents. And in the grand Rebellion, the Impropriator Mr. <HI>Oldworth,</HI> and others, (to their great Praise be it remembred) took down the Glass, and secured it in some secret Place, thereby preserving it from Fa∣natick Rage. The Painting was the Design of <HI>Albert Durer,</HI> a famous <HI>Italian</HI> Master; and the Colouring in the Drapery, and some of the Figures, is so well perform'd, that <HI>Vandyke</HI> affirmed, the Pencil could not exceed it.</P>
<P>The Subject is all Scripture History, <HI>viz.</HI> The Ser∣pent tempting <HI>Eve</HI>; God appearing in the burning Bush to <HI>Moses,</HI> when a Shepherd; the Angel con∣ducting <HI>Joshua</HI> to War; <HI>Gideon</HI>'s Fleece; the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI>'s Visit to <HI>Solomon</HI>; King <HI>David</HI> judging the <HI>Amalekite</HI> Regicide; <HI>Samson</HI> slaying the <HI>Phi∣listines,</HI> killing the Lion, and his being betray'd by <HI>Dalilah</HI>; <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Judgment between the Two Harlots; and the Figures of the Twelve Major Prophets.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="247"/>But the greatest Part is taken up with Stories of the <HI>New Testament:</HI> The Angel appearing to <HI>Zacharias</HI>; <HI>Joseph</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> contracted; the Visitation of <HI>Mary</HI> by the Angel, and her visiting her Cousin <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; our Saviour born in a Stable; the Shepherds and <HI>Magi</HI> visiting him there; <HI>Herod</HI> waiting the Return of the wise Men; Christ circumcised; the Puri∣fication of the Holy Virgin; <HI>Simeon</HI> with our Saviour in his Arms; <HI>Joseph</HI>'s Flight into <HI>Egypt</HI>; <HI>Herod</HI> slaying the young Children of <HI>Bethlehem</HI>; the Assumption of the Virgin, and <HI>Joseph</HI> and her seeking Jesus at the Feast: our Saviour's Transfigu∣ration, <HI>Mary</HI> anointing his Head: the Disciples going to embalm him, and the Angel relating to them his Resurrection; Christ's Appearance to <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>; his riding to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> on an Ass; <HI>Zaccheus,</HI> and the People strewing Palm-branches, and Children crying <HI>Hosanna</HI>; his Praying in the Garden; <HI>Judas</HI> betraying him; <HI>Pilate</HI> judging him, and washing his Hands from the Guilt; the Crucifixion between two Thieves, the Women standing by, and the Soldiers watching him; <HI>Joseph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea</HI> begging the Body, and receiving it; his Burial by <HI>Nicodemus</HI> and others; the Darkness at the Passion, and <HI>Michael</HI> contending with the Devil.</P>
<P>Christ's travelling to <HI>Emmaus,</HI> and his Appearance to the Eleven, and afterwards to <HI>Thomas</HI>; the Disciples going a Fishing, and Christ's appearing to them, with the breaking of the Net, and broiling of the Fish; Christ's Ascension, and the Descent of the Holy Ghost in cloven Tongues.</P>
<P>In the West Window is the Last Judgment curi∣ously designed, and well executed, containing a vast Number of Incidents relating thereto.</P>
<P>In the rest of the Windows are many historical Passages, that happened after Christ's Ascension; <HI>viz.</HI> The Twelve Apostles at large, with the Article of the Creed they are said to be severally the Authors of;
<PB N="247" REF="248"/>
the Four Evangelists, as writing the Gospels; Four principal Fathers of the Church, <HI>viz.</HI> St. <HI>Jerom,</HI> St. <HI>Gregory,</HI> St. <HI>Ambrose,</HI> and St. <HI>Austin</HI>; the Worthies that have preserved the Christian Church, in four Upper-windows of the Middle Ayle on the South Side, and the Persecutors thereof in the four opposite Windows.</P>
<P>I have been as brief as possible in this Description, being so much confined in my Limits; but a curious Traveller will be highly delighted with this noble Work. And I shall only add, That <HI>John Tame,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the pious and worthy Founder, who died in the Year 1500, lies buried on the North Side of the Church, under a raised Marble Monument.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Churn,</HI> one of the Rivers I have just named, stands <HI>Cirencester,</HI> (or <HI>Cicester,</HI> for Brevity) the antient <HI>Corinium</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and said to be rebuilt by <HI>Cissa,</HI> a Viceroy under one of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, a great and populous City; then inclosed with Walls and a Ditch of vast Compass, which may be traced quite round. The Foundation of the Wall is also very visible in most Places. A good Part of this Circuit is now Pasture, Corn Fields, and Gardens, besides the Scite of the present Town. Antiquities are dug up here every Day; old Foundations, Houses and Streets, and many <HI>Mosaick</HI> Pavements with Rings, Intaglia's, and Coins innumerable, especially in one great Garden called <HI>Lewis Grounds,</HI> which might have been the <HI>Praetorium</HI> or General's Quarters; for <HI>Llys,</HI> in <HI>British,</HI> signifies a Palace. Large Quantities of carved Stones are carried off yearly in Carts, to mend the Highways, besides what have been used in Building. A fine <HI>Mosaick</HI> Pavement was dug up here <HI>Anno</HI> 1723, with many Coins. One Mr. <HI>Richard Bishop</HI> lately dug up in his Garden a Vault 16 Feet long, and 12 broad, supported with square Pillars of <HI>Roman</HI> Brick, three Feet and an half high, on which was a strong Floor of Terrace.
<PB N="248" REF="249"/>
Near it are now several other Vaults, on which Cherry-trees grow. These might have been the Foundations of a Temple; for in the same Place they found several Stones of the Shafts of Pillars Six Feet long, and large Stone Bases, with Cornices very handsomely moulded, and carved with Modilions and other Ornaments, which are now converted into Swine-troughs, and Pavements before the Door. Capitals of these Pillars were likewise found. A <HI>Mosaick</HI> Pavement near it, and intire, is now the Floor of his Privy.</P>
<P>Half a Mile West of the Town, on the North Side of the <HI>Fosse</HI> Road, at a Place called <HI>Quern,</HI> other Antiquities are to be seen worth an Antiquary's Attention; but I must not take up too much Room in describing them.</P>
<P>Little of the Abbey is now lest, besides Two old and indifferent Gate-houses. The Church is a very handsome Building; the Windows are full of painted Glass; and it has a fine lofty Tower. East of the Town, about a Quarter of a Mile, is <HI>Starbury Mount,</HI> a Barrow, where <HI>Roman</HI> Coins have been dug up. West, behind Lord <HI>Bathurst</HI>'s Garden, is <HI>Grismund</HI>'s <HI>Mount,</HI> of which several Fables are told.</P>
<P><HI>Cirencester</HI> is still a very good Town, populous and rich, full of Clothiers, and driving a great Trade in Wool, which is brought from the Inland Counties of <HI>Leicester, Northampton,</HI> and <HI>Lincoln,</HI> where the largest Sheep in <HI>England</HI> feed, and where are but few Manufactures. The vast Quantities sold here are almost incredible. The Wool is bought up here, chiefly by the Clothiers of <HI>Wiltshire</HI> and <HI>Gloucester∣shire,</HI> for the Supply of that great Cloathing-trade, which I have mentioned already: they talk of 5000 Packs in a Year.</P>
<P>The Town is governed by Two High Constables. It has Two weekly Markets; one on <HI>Monday,</HI> for Corn, Cattle, and Provisions; and on <HI>Friday,</HI> for
<PB N="249" REF="250"/>
Wool chiefly. It has also Five Fairs, Three for all Sorts of Commodities, and Two for Cloth only. Here is a fine large beautiful Church with Two Ayles, supported by strong Pillars. The Chancel is handsomely decorated. It has Five Chapels adjoin∣ing to it, and has a Tower very neat and lofty, with an excellent Ring of Bells in it. The Windows shew some beautiful Remains of exquisite painted Glass. There is a Free-school, and divers Hospitals and Alms-houses in this Parish.</P>
<P>The <HI>Churn</HI> runs from hence down Southward to <HI>Creeklade</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> which is said to have been antiently a very noted Place, containing 1300 Houses, and that an University was here founded by the antient <HI>Britons,</HI> for teaching <HI>Greek,</HI> as I have said, as <HI>Lech∣lade</HI> was for <HI>Latin</HI>; which University was removed, as they pretend, by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> to <HI>Oxon:</HI> but, I doubt, these are Monkish Accounts; for <HI>Creeklade,</HI> which they would have to signify a <HI>Greek</HI> Town, is a Corruption of the <HI>British</HI> Word <HI>Kerigg gwlade,</HI> i. e. a stony Country. The <HI>Churn</HI> and the <HI>Rey</HI> fall, here, into the <HI>Thames.</HI> Here is a good Free-school.</P>
<P>North-west of <HI>Cirencester,</HI> upon a Hill, stands <HI>Stroud,</HI> a little Market-town, noted for Clothing, and particularly for dying excellent Scarlet. The Church is 90 Feet long, and 40 broad. The Chancel is 33 Feet long, and 16 wide. At the West End of the Church rises a high Spire Steeple, and a Tower in the Middle.</P>
<P>North of it stands <HI>Paynswick,</HI> a Market-town, situate in the wholsomest Air in the County, on the River <HI>Stroud,</HI> where the Cloathing-trade is also car∣ried on. The Church is a Vicarage, and very handsome, with Two Chancels, a North Ayle, and a neat Spire.</P>
<P>Lower to the South-west of <HI>Cirencester</HI> stands <HI>Minching Hampton</HI>; so called, because it belonged to the <HI>Minching</HI> Nuns at <HI>Caen</HI> in <HI>Normandy.</HI> Here
<PB N="250" REF="251"/>
is a good Rectory Church worth 200<HI>l.</HI> a Year, large, in the Form of a Cross with Ayles on each Side, and a Tower with Battlements rising in the Middle. In the North Ayle are a great many Inscriptions of Be∣nefactions. And in the South Ayle is a Statue lying cross-legg'd, with a Sword and Shield by him, and his Wife lying at his Feet.</P>
<P>Then we came to <HI>Tetbury,</HI> one of the Cloathing Towns I mentioned; a considerable Market-town, situate on a rising Ground, in a healthy Air, but scarce of Water in Summer. 'Tis well-built, has a large Market-house well frequented for Yarn; and there is a lesser Market-house, for Cheese, Bacon, and other Commodities. 'Tis govern'd by a Bailiff, and at the End of the Town is a long Bridge, whereof one half is in <HI>Wiltshire.</HI> The Church is a Vicarage, worth 120<HI>l.</HI> a Year: 'tis a good Build∣ing, large and handsome, in which are divers Monu∣ments. Here is a Free-school and an Alms-house. It had formerly a Castle built by <HI>Dunwallo Malmu∣fius,</HI> a <HI>British</HI> Prince. The Town seems to be well furnished with every thing but Water, which is so scarce, that the Inhabitants are obliged to buy it at the Rate sometimes of 18<HI>d.</HI> for a Hogshead. In this Parish rises the River <HI>Avon,</HI> which runs thro' <HI>Bristol,</HI> and afterwards falls into the <HI>Severn.</HI></P>
<P>A little to the North of this Town is a Meadow called <HI>Maudlin</HI> Meadow, because, as I was told, it belongs to <HI>Magdalen</HI> College in <HI>Oxford.</HI> Here the Inhabitants shewed me the Head of a Spring, which flowing from thence runs along a Hedge-trough, and some Tops of the Wood, that grows in the Hedge, rotting, and falling into this Rill of Water, are, by it, turned into Stone. I took up a great many of them, which are generally in the Shape of the Pipes (as they are commonly called) which the Peruke-makers curl their Hair upon, and of a whitish stony Substance. I broke divers of them, and in the
<PB N="251" REF="252"/>
middle found generally a Stick of Wood, some as big as a Goose-quill, others larger; some had but a thin stony Crust about them, in others the Stick was no biggar than a large Needle: again, some had no Stick in them, but only a Hole thro' them, like that of a Tobacco Pipe; and in some others, I could per∣ceive no woody Substance, nor Hole at all, but the Whole was a soft Kind of Stone.—Hence I guess, that the Sand which the Water brings down with it, gathers and crusts about those Sticks; and that, in time, the Stick consumes, and the stony or sandy Substance fills up and supplies its Place. And I would hence recommend it as an Inquiry, Whether those other Transmutations of this Kind, that we meet with in the Natural History of this and other Nations, be not brought about in the like manner.</P>
<P>And now I am dipp'd into this Work of Nature, let me digress a little, and take notice of the <HI>Astroites,</HI> or Star-stones, found at <HI>Lassington</HI> in this County, which have that peculiar Quality of Motion when put into Vinegar.—In the Fields, near <HI>Badminton,</HI> are found cylindrical and spherical Stones, almost as big as Cannon Balls. And on the Hills about <HI>Aldely,</HI> are found Stones of the same Kind with those I found about <HI>Watchet</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> resembling all Kinds of Shell-fish: these, I must confess, are, of the two, more astonishing, because they are found on the Hills; for if they were, as <HI>Fracastorius</HI> conjectures, Animals ingendered in the Sea, no good Account of their being here found can be given, unless we suppose them brought hither by the general Deluge.—The Water of the River <HI>Stroud,</HI> in this County, is esteemed the best for Dying Scarlets, which draws many Clothiers to settle in that Neigh∣bourhood. And lest I should be thought too tedious, let me but just mention the Diamonds (<HI>Bristol</HI> Stones rather) found near the Banks of the River <HI>Avon.</HI> That soft, easy-to-be-wrought Stone at <HI>Great Ban∣ington,</HI>
<PB N="252" REF="253"/>
called <HI>Puff-stone,</HI> prodigiously strong and last∣ing; a great deal af of which hath been used in the Repairs of <HI>Westminster</HI> Abbey.</P>
<P><HI>Wickwar,</HI> a small Market-town, but a very an∣tient Corporation, governed by a Mayor, is the next. The Church is a large Edifice, with Two Chancels. The Tower is at the West End, and is high, adorn'd with Pinacles. Here is a Free-school.</P>
<P><HI>Chipping Sodbury</HI> lies a little farther in the Road, an antient Borough-town, under a Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses. As it is a great Thorough-fare to <HI>Bristol,</HI> it is full of good Inns. It has several Streets besides Lanes, and a good Market; and a large spa∣cious Church, which, however, is but a Chapel of Ease to <HI>Old Sodbury.</HI> Here is the greatest Cheese-market in <HI>England,</HI> except <HI>Atherstone</HI> in <HI>War∣wickshire.</HI></P>
<P>Here we dropp'd the Road, and fell down South∣ward, directly to <HI>Marshfield,</HI> another of the Cloath∣ing Towns I spoke of. It consists of one Street of old Buildings near a Mile long. It has a Market, and drives also a great Trade in Malt, and is noted for good Cakes. 'Tis governed by a Bailiff. Here is a good Vicarage Church, with several Monuments and Inscriptions in the Ayles, and the Chancel. Here is an Alms-house well endow'd, and a Chapel to it.</P>
<P>We crossed the great Road from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Bristol</HI> here, as at <HI>Cirencester</HI> we did that from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Gloucester</HI>; and keeping still the Fosseway, arrived at <HI>Bath.</HI> But here I shall conclude this Letter, and am, Sir,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V. CONTAINING A Description of Part of the Counties of <HI>Somerset, Gloucester, Warwick, Wor∣cester, Hereford,</HI> and <HI>Monmouth.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Closed my last Letter with my Arrival at BATH, in <HI>Somersetshire</HI>; and I shall now proceed with giving you an Account of what is most remarkable in it.</P>
<P>The Antiquity of this City, and of the famous Baths in it, must be allow'd to be very great, even tho' we should doubt of what is insisted on in the Inscription under the Figure of King <HI>Bladud,</HI> placed in the King's Bath, which says, that this Prince (whom Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> calls <HI>Blayden,</HI> or <HI>Bladen Cloyth,</HI> i. e. <HI>Southsayer</HI>) found out the Use of these Baths, 300 Years before our Saviour's Time.</P>
<P><HI>Bath</HI> is a Spot of Ground, which our Countrymen ought to esteem as a particular Favour of Heaven. It lies in a great Valley, surrounded with an Amphi∣theatrical View of Hills; and its Situation on the West Side of the Island is a considerable Addition to its Delights, as being the less liable to the rude Shocks of
<PB N="254" REF="255"/>
Tempests. But the <HI>Romans</HI> were induced prudently to make a Station here by the admirable hot Springs. The Walls are almost intire, and perhaps the Work of the <HI>Romans,</HI> except the upper Part, which seems repaired with the Ruins of <HI>Roman</HI> Buildings; for the Lewis-holes are still left in many of the Stones, and, to the Shame of the Repairers, many <HI>Roman</HI> In∣scriptions, some sawn across, to fit the Size of the Place. The Level of the City is risen to the Top of the first Walls, thro' the Negligence of the Magistracy, who, in this, and all other great Towns, connive at the Servants throwing Dirt and Ashes into the Streets. These Walls inclose but a small Com∣pass, of a pentagonal Form. There are four Gates on four Sides, and a Postern on the other. From the South-west Angle have been an additional Wall and Ditch carried out to the River; by which short Work the Approach of an Enemy on two Sides is intercepted, unless they pass the River. The small Compass of the City has made the Inhabitants croud up the Streets to an unseemly and inconvenient Narrowness. It is, however, handsomely built, mostly of new Stone, which is very white and good. The great Additions made, and still making, to the Buildings here, I shall mention by-and-by.</P>
<P>It was of old a Resort for Cripples, and dis∣eased Persons; and we see the Crutches hang up at the several Baths, as the Thank-offerings of those who came hither lame, and went away cured. But now we may say it is a Resort of the Sound, as well as the Sick, and a Place that helps the Indolent and the Gay to commit that worst of Murders, that is to say, to kill <HI>Time.</HI></P>
<P>To such it is indeed a constant Round of Diver∣sion. In the Morning the young Lady is brought in a close Chair, dressed in her Bathing-cloaths, to the <HI>Cross-bath.</HI> There the Musick plays her into the Bath, and the Women who tend her, present her
<PB N="255" REF="256"/>
with a little floating Wooden Dish, like a Bason; in which the Lady puts a Handkerchief, and a Nosegay, and of late the Snuff-box is added. She then traverses the Bath, if a Novice, with a Guide; if otherwise, by herself; and having amus'd herself near an Hour, calls for her Chair, and re∣turns to her Lodgings.</P>
<P>The rest of the Diversion is at Mrs. <HI>Hayes</HI>'s, for∣merly <HI>Harrison</HI>'s, a stately Room, and Mrs. <HI>Wilt∣shire</HI>'s, who has now the Apartments that were the late Mrs. <HI>Lindsey</HI>'s, where not long since was the Bowling-green. And perhaps Mr. <HI>Leake,</HI> who keeps one of the finest Booksellers Shops in <HI>Europe,</HI> has more than a Chance for half an Hour of each Per∣son's Company now-and-then, and to be sure a Subscription, which is but five Shillings the Season, for taking home what Book you please; but Persons of Quality generally subscribe Gold, and I think it is the very best Money laid out in the Place, for those who go for Pleasure or Amusement only. In the Afternoon there is frequently a Play, tho' the Decorations are mean, and indeed the Performances too. In the Evening, People assemble at the great Rooms, and there are Balls twice a Week. 'Tis also the Fashion of the Place, for the Company to go every Day pretty constantly to hear Divine Service at the great Church, and at <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s Chapel in <HI>Queen's-square,</HI> where are Prayers twice a Day.</P>
<P>'Tis remarkable that for many Hundreds of Years, the Medicinal Virtues of these Waters have been useful to the diseased People by Batheing only; whereas of late Years they are found to be no less healthful in many Cases taken inwardly; insomuch, that more come to drink than to bathe; nor are the Cures they perform this way, less valuable than the outward Application.</P>
<P>Gaming used to obtain here, as at all publick Places, to a scandalous Degree; but the Act pro∣hibiting
<PB N="256" REF="257"/>
that pernicious Practice; has a good deal checked its Progress. This Act passed in the 12th of King <HI>George</HI> II. and suppresses, on the Penalty of 200<HI>l.</HI> and 50<HI>l.</HI> the Adventures, the following Games by Name; <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Ace of Hearts, Pharaoh, Bas∣set, Hazard</HI>; also all <HI>Sales, Raffles, Lotteries, Mathematical Machines,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Sales by Lotteries</HI> are declared void, and what is put up by them for∣feited; nor are Convictions to be vacated for want of Form.</P>
<P>But this Act being eluded by new Games set up, a Clause was inserted in the <HI>Horse-racing</HI> Act, <HI>Anno</HI> 13 <HI>Geo.</HI> II. prohibiting <HI>Passage,</HI> and all other Games with Dice, except what are play'd on the <HI>Back∣gamon</HI> Tables.</P>
<P>As to the more particular Nature and Virtues of the Waters, I have been favoured, by a very eminent Physician, with the following curious Account of tham, and their Original.<Q><HI>Of</HI> Bath <HI>Waters.</HI>
<P>The <HI>Bath</HI> Waters certainly owe their Heat to a Mixture and Fermentation of two different Sources, distilling from the Tops of two different Mountains (<HI>Clarton</HI> and <HI>Landsdown</HI>) meeting in the Valley where the Town stands; for all Hills are Nests of Metals or Minerals, and their Bellies are cavernous and hollow. It is not therefore improbable, that on <HI>Clarton Down</HI> there should lie the sulphurous Matter which must rise by Impregnation from that excellent Stone Quarry, which hardens in the Air, and grows cased with a nitrous Coat by Time, and cold Wea∣ther, and is so readily cut out and carved into any the most exquisite Shapes. This the Discovery and Property of the worthy, charitable, and pious <HI>Ralph Allen,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> For all Mineral Waters owe their Virtue to an Impregnation of Rain Water, generated from the Clouds, which are compressed in their Course by
<PB N="257" REF="258"/>
Mountains or Eminences, and fall on the re∣spective included Mineral. And every one knows, that a due Mixture of Sulphur, and Filings of Iron, moistened with Water, will produce any Degree of Heat. This Quarry therefore must have a large Quantity of sulphurous or bituminous Matter in its Composition, as will be evident to a Natural Philo∣sopher, from these mentioned Qualities of the Stone. Neither is it improbable, that the ferruginous or iron-tinctured Water takes its Rise from <HI>Lansdown</HI> Quarry, the Stone on it being hard, and on the Top flinty, black, and acrimonious, as Iron Ore is known to be. These Two Mountains, thus tinged by Rain Water falling from the proper Heights, meet in some Caverns in the Valley; and, there fermenting produce that hot, milky, soft, salutiferous Beverage, called <HI>Bath Water,</HI> far beyond any hot mineral Waters for its Delicacy, and supportable, tho' comfortable Heat, to any other such Water hitherto discovered on the habitable Globe, as it possesses that Milkiness, Deter∣gency, and middling Heat so friendly adapted to weaken'd animal Constitutions, which all other hot Waters want in the due Degree; either being too hot, or too cold, to do any great Good in Cases where they are proper. These Waters are beneficial in al∣most all chronical Distempers, and can hurt in none, except in Hemorrhages, Inflammations, or bad Lungs, unless they be over-dosed in Quantity, or too high and too hot a Regimen be joined with them; for they always procure a great Appetite, and good Spirits, if cautiously managed; but if high Meats, and strong Liquors, be indulged, they will create inflam∣matory Disorders. However, in weak Stomachs, decayed Appetites, Colicks, low Spirits, in the Intervals of the Fits of the Gout and Stone; in Rheumatisms, Palsies, nervous Disorders; and, in a Word, all those called the Cold Diseases; but most eminently, in all the Disorders of the chyliferous Tube,
<PB N="258" REF="259"/>
or the Stomach and Belly not inflamed, they are more kindly and beneficial than any Medicine known in Nature; and introduce a natural Warmth, and a new internal Heat, into decayed, worn-out, super∣annuated Constitutions; and if a light Regimen, due Exercise, and good Hours, be joined with them, they would truly work Wonders: but by the Neglect of these, their Efficacy is often lost, and their Credit brought into Question.</P></Q></P>
<P>Great Additions have been made to the Buildings here within these few Years; particularly by the Duke of <HI>Chandos.</HI></P>
<P>Without the Walls, a stately new Square is erected, with a fine Chapel, and the Middle is in∣closed by Rails, and handsomely laid out within.</P>
<P>In the Centre is a lofty Obelisk 70 Feet high from the Foundation, and terminated in a Point. Level with one's Eye is the inclosed Inscription:
<Q>IN MEMORY<LB/>OF HONOUR BESTOW'D,<LB/>AND IN GRATITUDE<LB/>FOR BENEFITS CONFERR'D<LB/>IN THIS CITY,<LB/>BY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS<LB/><HI>FREDERICK</HI><LB/><HI>PRINCE</HI> OF <HI>WALES,</HI><LB/>AND HIS ROYAL <HI>CONSORT,</HI><LB/>IN THE YEAR M.DCC.XXXVIII.<LB/>THIS OBELISK IS ERECTED,<LB/>BY <HI>RICHARD NASH,</HI> <ABBR><HI>Esq</HI></ABBR></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Bath-stone,</HI> which I have mention'd before, affords a fine Opportunity to imbellish and give a noble Look to the Buildings here, and at a very cheap Rate; for the Front of the Houses on the North Side of the Square cost no more than 500<HI>l.</HI> tho' it is above 200 Feet in Extent, and inriched with Co∣lumns
<PB N="259" REF="260"/>
and Pilasters in the <HI>Corinthian Order.</HI> All the Danger is, that they will over-build themselves now they are got into the Humour, and make it less worth while to those who let Lodgings, the prin∣cipal Business of the Place; but then People of Fortune, settling there, will make amends for it; since no less than 70 or 80 Families are already be∣come constant Inhabitants, and others are daily taking Houses.</P>
<P>The Grove too, near the Abbey-church, now cal∣led <HI>Orange-square,</HI> in Compliment to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> when there, has several handsome new-built Houses; and a monumental Stone is erected, with an Inscription in Honour to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the Place; his Highness having been obliged to visit <HI>Bath</HI> for his Health, just before he married the Princess Royal of <HI>England,</HI> and received great Benefit by the Waters. This likewise was erected by the famous Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> to whose good Management and Behaviour <HI>Bath</HI> is greatly indebted; every one submitting with Delight to the Regulations he imposes, with regard to Decorum, and the Oeconomy of the Place.</P>
<P>The Inscription on the Stone above, is as follows:<Q><HI>In Memoriam</HI><LB/><HI>Sanitatis</HI><LB/><HI>Principi Auriaco</HI><LB/><HI>Aquarum Thermalium Potu,</HI><LB/><HI>Favente DEO,</HI><LB/><HI>Ovante</HI> BRITANNIA,<LB/><HI>Feliciter Restitutae.</HI><LB/>M.DCC.XXXV.</Q> <HI>Thus translated:</HI><Q>In Memory of the happy Resto∣ration of the Health of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> by the drink∣ing of the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, thro' the Favour of GOD, and to the extreme Joy of <HI>Britain,</HI> 1735.</Q></P>
<P>General <HI>Wade,</HI> one of the Representatives in Par∣liament for this City, has given a fine Altar-piece to the great Church there: He has also been at the Charge of having the Picture drawn of every one of his Electors, (the Members of the Corporation) and set up round the Town-hall; and his own too he has
<PB N="260" REF="261"/>
suffer'd to be put up over the Entrance, as if he would make good that Pass, and keep them all to <HI>Duty.</HI> At the Upper-end of the Hall are lately set up the Pictures of the Prince and Princess of <HI>Wales,</HI> a Present made by their Royal Highnesses to the Cor∣poration, who likewise before presented it with a fine large wrought Silver Cup and Waiter, gilt.</P>
<P>There is a very great Narrowness of Spirit in most of the Inhabitants at <HI>Bath:</HI> but, indeed, it is the same in all publick Places of Resort. They have but their <HI>Seasons</HI>; and they are so hungry by that time they come about, that they look upon a new Comer, as a Person to be <HI>shared</HI> and <HI>divided</HI> among them: for this Reason you'll always find them with <HI>both</HI> Hands open to <HI>receive</HI>; and not <HI>one</HI> to <HI>com∣municate,</HI> or do a <HI>generous</HI> Office, without a Benefit in <HI>Possession</HI> or <HI>Reversion.</HI> And when they receive a Favour at your Hands, 'tis with such an Air, as if it were their <HI>Due,</HI> and they quitted Scores with you by their Acceptance of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Abbey-church</HI> is a venerable Pile, and has many Monuments in it. But the principal Front is almost blasphemously decorated, if it may be call'd decorated, with the Figures of God the Father, and Saints and Angels, the Work of Superstition. This Cathedral, tho' beautiful, is but small; and on the Spot probably stood the <HI>Roman</HI> Temple of <HI>Minerva,</HI> Patroness of the Baths. Before it, was an hand∣some square Area, but of late Years deformed with Houses.</P>
<P>On the South Side are the justly renowned hot Springs collected into a square Area, called <HI>the King's Bath.</HI> The Corporation erected within these few Years that pretty neat Building before it, call'd <HI>the Pump-room,</HI> for the Company to meet in, who drink the Water, convey'd hither by a Marble Pump from the Bottom of the Springs, where it is near boiling-hot.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="262"/>This Water is admirably grateful to the Stomach, striking the Roof of the Mouth with a fine sulphur∣ous and steely Taste, like that of the <HI>German Spaw</HI> or <HI>Pyrmont.</HI> Tho' you drink off a large Pint-glass, it is so far from creating a Heaviness or Nausea, that you immediately perceive yourself more alert. At first it operates by Stool, and especially Urine. It is of sovereign Efficacy to strengthen the Bowels, re∣store their lost Tone, and renew the vital Heat. But I have already mention'd its excellent Qualities.</P>
<P><HI>The King's Bath</HI> is an oblong Square, the Walls full of Niches, perhaps the <HI>Romans</HI> Work. There are Twelve on the North Side; Eight on the East and West; about Four larger Arches on the South. At every Corner are the Steps to descend into it, and a Parapet or Balustrade with a Walk round it.</P>
<P>The Springs were doubtless separated from com∣mon Springs by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and fenced in with a durable Wall. There goes a probable Tradition of subterranean Canals of their making, to carry off the other Waters, lest they should mix with these, and destroy the Heat.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that at the cleansing of the Springs, when they set down a new Pump, they constantly find great Quantities of Hazel-nuts, as in many other Places among subterraneous Timber. These, Dr. <HI>Stukeley</HI> doubts not, are the Remainder of the univer∣sal Deluge, which the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Historian tell us was in Autumn, Providence by that means securing the Revival of the Vegetable World.</P>
<P>In the Bath People stand up to the Chin, Men and Women, and stew, mostly in the way of Gallantry.</P>
<P>Many are the Diseases which here find a Remedy, when judiciously applied, as I observ'd above. The Confleunce hither is greater in Summer, than in Winter, tho' the latter, of the two, seems the more preferable Season for medicinal Purposes.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="263"/>Behind the Southern Wall of <HI>the King's Bath,</HI> is a less Square, named <HI>the Queen's Bath,</HI> with a Ta∣bernacle of Four Pillars in the midst. This is of more temperate Warmth, as borrowing its Water from the other. There are likewise Pumps and Pumping-rooms, for pouring hot Streams on any Part of the Body; which in many Cases is very salutary.</P>
<P>In the South-west Part of the Town are two other Baths, not to be disregarded.</P>
<P><HI>The Hot-bath</HI> is not much inferior in Heat to <HI>the King's Bath</HI>; it is a small Parallelogram, with a Stone Tabernacle of Four Pillars in the midst.</P>
<P><HI>The Cross-bath</HI> near it is triangular, and had a Cross in the middle. Hard by is an Hospital built and endow'd by a Prelate of this See. The Water in these two Places rises near the Level of the Streets.</P>
<P>On the South Side of the Cathedral are some Parts of the Abbey left, and the Gate-house belonging to it.</P>
<P>Within these few Years, by a Contribution, a cold Bath for the Benefit of the Infirm was made at a Spring beyond the Bridge.</P>
<P>Two <HI>Roman</HI> Inscriptions have been set in the Eastern Wall of the Cathedral, fronting the Walks; which, besides the Injuries of the Weather, are exposed to the mischievous Sport of Boys, who throw Stones at them.</P>
<P>The several Baths are very indifferently kept, as their Use so much increases. But a fine Design is now on foot to make convenient Slips, with Dressing-rooms, and Apartments for Pumping on People, without going into the Bath, and for inlarging the Pump-room so as to hold four or five Pumps.</P>
<P>The greatest Decency is observed here by both Sexes; and while Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> lives, it must be always so. There is a very good Conveniency of Chairs, of which there are great Plenty, and very genteel ones,
<PB N="263" REF="264"/>
to go to any Part within the Walls, and even to the adjoining Buildings without, for 6<HI>d.</HI> provided the Distance does not exceed 500 Yards; but if it does, the Fare is 1<HI>s.</HI> and for this the Chairmen are obliged to go a Mile. In short, it is a delightful Place enough, when you are in it, but a dreadful one to come at, down high Hills, in some Places like Precipices: but Health or Pleasure obliges People to dispense with this Difficulty.</P>
<P><HI>Bath</HI> being invironed with Hills, there are few pleasant Walks out of the Town, or even Rides, without clambering much to <HI>Landsdown-hill,</HI> or that called <HI>Clarton-down.</HI></P>
<P>It is for this Reason, that very few People care to keep Coaches here. And the Hill up to <HI>Lansdown,</HI> particularly, is so steep, that the late Queen <HI>Anne</HI> was extremely frighted in going up: her Coachman stopping to give the Horses Breath, and the Coach wanting a Dragstaff, it ran back in spite of all the Coachman's Skill; the Horses not being brought to strain the Harness again, or pull together for a good while, and the Coach putting the Guards behind in great Confusion: at last some of the Servants, setting their Heads and Shoulders to the Wheels, stopt them by mere Force.</P>
<P>The General Hospital now near finished in this City, for the Reception of the sick Poor all over the Kingdom, is a very noble Design. The first Stone of it was laid the 6th of <HI>July</HI> 1738. It is built where the old Play-house stood, and is a noble Pile of Building, 100 Feet in Front, and 90 Feet deep. It is capable of receiving 150 poor Cripples. Its chief Benefactor is Mr. <HI>Allen,</HI> of whom we shall say more anon, who gave all the Wall-stone, Free-stone ready wrought, Paving-stone, and Lime used in it. The Prince and Princess of <HI>Wales</HI> have like∣wise been great Promoters of the Work.</P>

<P><PB N="264" REF="271"/>A very great Design is now also begun in this City, of which the following is a brief Account.</P>
<P>On the 10th of <HI>March</HI> 1739-40, the first Stone of a new Square was laid, in the Gardens adjoining to the publick Walks. The principal Side of this Square is to have the Appearance of one House, 520 Feet in Front, and 260 Feet in Depth, but is to be divided into 40 Houses: each Front is to have 63 Windows, and each End 31. Two of the other Sides are to serve as Wings to the principal Side: each Wing is to contain 24 Houses upon a perfect Square of 210 Feet, and the Front of these Wings are every one to have 25 Windows; so that when the whole Building is viewed in Front, it will shew 113 Windows, extend 1040 Feet, and from the distant Hills look like one grand Palace. The three Piles of Building will be adorned with above 300 Columns and Pilasters in the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order:—Upon the Corner of every Pile there will be a Tower, and in every Front will be a Centre-house and a Pediment.</P>
<P>A noble House for publick Assemblies is to be erected by Subscription in this Square; the Ball∣room will be like an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Hall, and contain in Length 90 Feet, and Breadth 52 Feet. The As∣sembly-room will be 90 Feet long. There will be a Garden for the Ladies to walk in; a Bowling-green for the Gentlemen; a grand Parade of 200 Yards long, a Terrace 500 Yards in Circumference, a Portico of the same Dimensions, with divers other Walks in common for all People, and so disposed, that Gentlemen and Ladies may walk at any Season of the Year, at any Hour of the Day, and in any Weather. So that by these great Improvements <HI>Bath</HI> will be rendered one of the most agreeable Places in the World; for, facing this Square, a Bridge with an Arch of 102 Feet opening will be built over the River, by which People of Distinction may go to
<PB N="265" REF="272"/>
the <HI>Downs,</HI> as into their own Gardens, for the Air and Exercise.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Avon</HI> runs by the Back of the Town; and on the Banks of it, Mr. <HI>Allen,</HI> who is the Genius of the Place, and whose Works and In∣ventions there, next to the Waters, are better worth the Attention of the Curious, than any thing in <HI>Bath,</HI> has a fine Wharf, and other convenient Places, to shape, to work, to imbark the Stones of many Tons Weight, which he digs from the Quarry, on the adjacent Hill. This he does by an admirable Machine, which runs down the Hill by Grooves placed in the Ground, without Horses or any other Help, than one Man to guide it, who also by a particular Spring can stop it in the steepest Part of the Hill, and in the swiftest Part of its Motion. These Stones he can carry by the <HI>Avon</HI> to <HI>Bristol,</HI> whence they may be transported to any other Part of <HI>England</HI>; and the new Works of <HI>St. Bartholomew's</HI> Hospital, <HI>London,</HI> are built with them. He is build∣ing for himself a very magnificent House of this Stone, with a fine Chapel, and noble Stables and Offices; and has delightful Gardens laid out with a Profusion of Fancy, yet with great Oeconomy, as to the Expence: for, in short, Mr. <HI>Allen</HI> is con∣tented with the Situation of his House and Gardens, (and indeed well he may, for it is a very fine one) and, instead of forcing Nature by a great Expence to bend to Art, he pursues only what the natural Scite points out to him, and, by so doing, will make it one of the cheapest, and at the same time one of the most beautiful Seats in <HI>England.</HI> He levels no Hills, but enjoys the Beauty of the Prospects they afford; he cuts down no Woods, but strikes thro' them fine Walks, and next-to-natural Mazes; and has, by that means, a delightful Grove always filled with Birds, which afford the rural Ear a Musick transcending all others. Nor does he want for fine Conveniencies
<PB N="266" REF="273"/>
of Water; and as he is a Gentleman who is not enter'd into the present fashionable Schemes of ridi∣culing Religion and Scripture, he has a Figure of <HI>Moses</HI> striking the Rock, and the Water gushing out of it, which forms a sort of natural Cascade, whence his Bason is supplied; and is a pretty Allusion to his producing all his Works from the Stone Quarry in his Neighbourhood. This is the same Mr. <HI>Allen,</HI> who first invented the Cross-Post, so useful for the Con∣veyance of Letters to Places, which before were, in that Particular, at the greatest Uncertainty. The Taste of this Gentleman in his Gardening, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is so aptly described by Mrs. <HI>Chandler</HI> of the Place, in an ingenious Poem, called, <HI>The Description of</HI> BATH, that the following Quotation from it, must be acceptable.
<Q><L><HI>Thy Taste refin'd appears in yonder Wood,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Not</HI> Nature <HI>tortur'd, but by</HI> Art <HI>improv'd;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Where</HI> cover'd Walks <HI>with</HI> open Vistas <HI>meet,</HI></L>
<L><HI>An</HI> Area <HI>here, and there a</HI> shady Seat.</L>
<L><HI>A thousand Sweets in mingled Odours flow</HI></L>
<L><HI>From blooming</HI> Flow'rs, <HI>which on the Borders grow.</HI></L>
<L><HI>In num'rous Streams the murm'ring Waters thrill,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Uniting all, obedient to thy Will;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Till, by thy Art, in</HI> one Canal <HI>combin'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>They thro' the</HI> Wood <HI>in various</HI> Mazes <HI>wind;</HI></L>
<L><HI>From thence the foaming Waves fall rapid down,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In bold</HI> Cascades, <HI>and lash the rugged Stone.</HI></L>
<L><HI>But here their Fury lost, the calmer Scene</HI></L>
<L><HI>Delights the softer Muse, and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul serene:</HI></L>
<L><HI>An ample</HI> Bason, <HI>Centre of the Place,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In Lymph transparent holds the scaly Race;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Its glassy Face, from ev'ry Ruffle free,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Reflects the Image of each neighb'ring Tree;</HI></L>
<L><HI>On which the</HI> feather'd Choir<HI>'s melodious Throng,</HI></L>
<L><HI>By Love inspir'd, unite in tuneful Song;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Their tuneful Song the echoing</HI> Woods <HI>resound,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And falling</HI> Waters <HI>add a solemn Sound:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sure this the Muses haunt; 'tis hallow'd Ground!</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="274"/>At <HI>Walcot</HI> has been a Camp, and many <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities have been found. Lord <HI>Winchelsea</HI> has an Urn, a Patera, and other things taken out of a Stone Coffin, wherein was a Child's Body, half a Mile off the <HI>Bath.</HI></P>
<P>When one is upon <HI>Kingsdown,</HI> and has pass'd all the Steeps and Difficulties of the Ascent, there is a plain and pleasant Country for many Miles into <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> and two very noble Houses, the one built by Mr. <HI>Blathwait,</HI> late Secretary at War; and the other is call'd <HI>Badmington,</HI> a Mansion of the Duke of <HI>Beaufort.</HI></P>
<P>Nor must we forget to mention the handsome Monument erected by Order of the late Lord <HI>Lans∣down,</HI> to the Honour of Sir <HI>Bevil Granville,</HI> his Lordship's Ancestor, with an Inscription recording the Action in which he fell. It is built on the Brow of <HI>Lansdown-Hill,</HI> on the very Spot, as near as pos∣sible, where that brave Gentleman was kill'd, in the Action between him and Sir <HI>William Waller,</HI> in the late Civil Wars; of which Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> and others give Account.</P>
<P>I ought not to omit, that in the Session of Par∣liament 1738-9, an Act passed for inlarging the Terms and Powers granted by Two former Acts of Parliament, for Repairing and Inlarging the High∣ways between the Top of <HI>Kingsdown-Hill</HI> and the City of <HI>Bath</HI>; and for Amending several other Roads leading from <HI>Bristol,</HI> and other Places, to <HI>Bath</HI>; and for <HI>cleansing, paving,</HI> and <HI>enlightening</HI> the STREETS, and regulating the CHAIRMEN there; and for keeping a regular Nightly WATCH, within the said City and Liberties: All which, when ef∣fected according to the Intention of the Act, will be a great Conveniency to <HI>Bath,</HI> and to Persons resort∣ing to it.</P>
<P>I will just mention also, that at <HI>Chipping-Norton-Lane,</HI> near <HI>Bath,</HI> was a Fight between the Forces
<PB N="268" REF="275"/>
of King <HI>James</HI> II. and those of the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI> in which the latter had the Advantage, and, if they had pursu'd it, would have gain'd a complete Victory. An old Elm-Tree, standing near <HI>Stanton-Drew,</HI> in a Road leading three Ways, afforded a sad Testimony of the Event of the Duke's Enterprize; for it was all overspread with the Heads and Limbs of the unfortunate Persons engag'd in his Cause, who suffer'd by the Sentence of the merciless <HI>Jefferies.</HI></P>
<P>About <HI>Twyfordton,</HI> not far from <HI>Bath,</HI> is a fallow Field, call'd <HI>Marsbury-Field,</HI> with but little Quan∣tity of Earth upon the Rock. This was very full of fossile Shells, which had preserv'd their natural Colour of Blue and White as perfectly as at first.</P>
<P>In <HI>Chu</HI> Parish is <HI>Bowditch,</HI> so call'd from its cir∣cular Form; it was a large Camp on a Hill trebly fortified, whence you may behold the Isles of <HI>Flat∣holm</HI> and <HI>Steepholm</HI> in the Sea. Here is a petrifying Spring. This Country abounds with Coal-pits. The Slates which lie upon it, and have not re∣ceiv'd their due Quantity of Sulphur, so as to make perfect Coal, are most curiously mark'd with Im∣pressions of Plants, particularly those of Fern. This is indeed a Rock, full of Springs, a very bad Road for Travelling, consisting of short and steep Valleys, narrow Lanes, intricate, dark, and hard. The Ground is very rich, and bears much Wood. The Neatness of the Houses even of the poorer Sort of People is remarkable, being generally whited over, and imbel∣lish'd with little Gardens. We come in Ten Miles from <HI>Bath</HI> to the City of <HI>Bristol,</HI> the greatest, the richest, and the best Port of Trade in <HI>Great-Britain, London</HI> only excepted.</P>
<P><HI>Bristol</HI> has been formerly a Place of Strength, and had a Castle, in which King <HI>Stephen</HI> was kept Pri∣soner some time by <HI>Maud</HI> the Empress. It was be∣sieged in the Civil Wars, and made a good Defence. The Castle stood till the Time of <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI>
<PB N="269" REF="276"/>
who demolish'd it. It is a County-Town, and one of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.'s new Bishopricks.</P>
<P>The Merchants of this City have not only the greatest Trade, but they trade with a more intire In∣dependency upon <HI>London,</HI> than any other Town in <HI>Britain.</HI> And 'tis evident in this Particular, <HI>viz.</HI> That whatsoever Exportations they make to any Part of the World, they are able to bring the full Returns back to their own Port, and can dispose of them there; which is not the Case in any other Port in <HI>England</HI>; where they are often oblig'd either to ship part of the Effects in the Ports abroad, on the Ships bound to <HI>London</HI>; or to consign their own Vessels to <HI>London,</HI> in order both to get Freight, and dispose of their own Cargoes.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Bristol</HI> Merchants, as they have a very great Trade abroad, so they have always Buyers at home for their Returns, and that such Buyers, that no Cargo is too big for them. To this Purpose, the Shopkeepers in <HI>Bristol,</HI> who in general are Whole∣sale-men, have so great an Inland Trade among all the Western Counties, that they maintain Carriers, just as the <HI>London</HI> Tradesmen do, to all the princi∣pal Countries and Towns from <HI>Southampton</HI> in the South, even to the Banks of the <HI>Trent,</HI> North; al∣though they have no navigable River that Way.</P>
<P>Add to this, That, as well by Sea, as by the Na∣vigation of two great Rivers, the <HI>Wye,</HI> and the <HI>Se∣vern,</HI> they have the whole Trade of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> as it were, to themselves, and the greatest Part of that of <HI>North-Wales</HI>; and as to their Trade to <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> it is prodigiously increas'd since the Revolu∣tion, notwithstanding the great Trade which of late the Merchants of <HI>Liverpool</HI> also drive with that Kingdom.</P>
<P>The greatest Inconveniencies of <HI>Bristol</HI> are its Si∣tuation, its narrow Streets, and the Narrowness of its River; and we might mention also another

<HI>Narrow</HI>; that is, the <HI>Minds</HI> of the Generality of its People; for, let me tell you, the Merchants of <HI>Bri∣stol,</HI> tho' very rich, are not like the Merchants of <HI>London:</HI> the latter may be said (as of old of the Merchants of <HI>Tyre</HI>) to vie with the Princes of the Earth; whereas the former, being rais'd by good For∣tune, and Prizes taken in the Wars, from Masters of Ships, and blunt Tars, have imbib'd the Manners of these rough Gentlemen so strongly, that they trans∣mit it to their Descendants, only with a little more of the Sordid, than is generally to be found among the <HI>British</HI> Sailors; and I would advise the rich ones among them, if they would be a little more polite and generous, than they usually are, to <HI>travel,</HI> but not out of <HI>England</HI> neither; I mean only to <HI>Lon∣don</HI> (that is, from the second great Trading Town to the first); and they will see Examples worth their Imitation, as well for princely Spirit, as upright and generous Dealings.</P>
<P>The Corporation being very tenacious in not admit∣ting Persons to trade in their Liberty, who are not Freemen, there are not so many new Buildings, and Improvements of Streets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at <HI>Bristol,</HI> as would otherwise be. As for the City itself, there is hardly Room to set another House in it. The great Square, called <HI>Queen</HI>'s, formerly the <HI>Mead,</HI> where the Ground was subject to the Hazard of Inundations, is now so rais'd, that it is free from that Inconvenience: It is very handsomely built and inhabited, and a fine Eque∣strian Statue of King <HI>William</HI> III. erected in the middle of it, done by the famous <HI>Rysbrack.</HI></P>
<P>The Quay along the River is very noble, and well filled with all Sorts of Merchandize, and a handsome Row of Houses fronts it. And I was inform'd, when I was there last, that in order to make the Back of this City more commodious than ever, the Cor∣poration have purchased several Houses adjoining to the Back-Gate, in order to pull them down, and
<PB N="271" REF="280"/>
make all flush from the Conduit on the Back, clear round to the Quay; which when finish'd, will be one of the completest Harbours in <HI>Europe.</HI> This Quay is reckoned the longest in <HI>England.</HI> It has a Crane on it, the Workmanship of the late ingenious Mr. <HI>Padmore,</HI> which is not to be equalled in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Merchants are greatly benefited by it, in the extraordinary Dispatch it gives to the discharging of their Ships.</P>
<P><HI>College-Green</HI> is deemed the healthiest Situation in the City.</P>
<P>There is erected within these few Years an Assem∣bly Room, for Entertainment and Amusement of the Gay, as at other considerable Places; for Luxury must always follow Riches. It is a very handsome Building, and stands in the Way from the City to the <HI>Hot-well.</HI></P>
<P>The old Theatre at <HI>Stokes-Croft</HI> is also alter'd into a commodious Room for an Assembly, which is held every <HI>Tuesday</HI> during the Winter.</P>
<P>There were, when I was there, no less than fif∣teen Glass-Houses in <HI>Bristol,</HI> which is more than are in the City of <HI>London:</HI> they use indeed, them∣selves, a very great Number of Glass Bottles, which they send fill'd with Beer, Cyder, and Wine, to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> much more than goes from <HI>London</HI>; also vast Numbers of Bottles are now used for send∣ing the Water of St. <HI>Vincent</HI>'s Rock, not only all over <HI>England,</HI> but, we may say, all over the World.</P>
<P>This <HI>Hot-well,</HI> or Water of St. <HI>Vincent</HI>'s Rock, is without the City, at the Confluence of the two little Rivers, and on the North-side of the Stream. Not many Years since, this Spring lay open at the Foot of the Rock, and was covered by the salt Water at every Tide; and yet it preserved both its Warmth and Virtue intire.</P>
<P>The Rock, tho' hard to Admiration, has since that been work'd down, partly by Labour, and partly
<PB N="272" REF="281"/>
blown in Pieces by Gunpowder; and an handsome large House is built upon it, where they have good Apartments for entertaining distemper'd Persons. The Well is secur'd, and a good Pump is fix'd in it, so that they have the Water pure and unmix'd from the Spring itself, and they export vast Quantities; for this Water keeps its Virtue better than that of <HI>Bath.</HI></P>
<P>The following curious Account of the <HI>Bristol</HI> Wa∣ters, I am indebted for to the same eminent Physi∣cian, who favoured me with the learned Account of the Nature, and Efficacy of the <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Tun∣bridge</HI> Waters.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bristol</HI> Waters, he says, seem only a natural Lime-water, or pure Element impregnated with a natural unburnt Limestone. All the Hills and Moun∣tains round that Water are nothing but a Quarry of natural unburnt Limestone, which is daily dug up there for Building, and manifests itself to the Senses. This makes these <HI>Bristol</HI> Waters, one of the purest, best, and most salutary, mere aqueous Elements on the Globe, to cool all over-heated Bowels, and to lessen all preternatural Discharges. But the small <HI>Milk-warmth</HI> in them, when immediately pump'd up, upon the Well's being drain'd of the Influx of the Tide, shews there is some other Principle in them besides natural Limestone: and that in Nature can be no other than some weak Impregnation of Sulphur with Nitre or Sea Salt, or perhaps a slight Touch of Iron. The Stones are some reddish, some blackish, that are digg'd out of the Mountains circumjacent, but all of them natural Limestone. These reddish and blackish Colours in the Stones necessarily imply Sulphur and Iron; and these Three Principles, by chymical Processes and Mixtures, are discovered in some small Proportion in the Waters. They are excellent in all scorbutick and nervous Atrophies, in Hecticks, weak Lungs, all Inflammations in what∣ever
<PB N="273" REF="282"/>
Part, all preternatural Evacuations; in short, in all acrid Juices and viscid Blood, being a natural Simple <HI>Alcali</HI>; and in the first Stages of a <HI>Phthisis Pulmonum</HI>; and if early had recourse to, and long continued under a low, cooling, nutritive Regimen, they would probably stop the Growth and Causes of most chronical Distempers.</P>
<P>There are 17 Parishes in the City, but 19 Churches, including the Cathedral and the Church of <HI>St. Mark.</HI> There are besides those Churches, several Meeting-houses, for the different Sectaries, <HI>viz.</HI> Independents, Quakers, and Baptists.</P>
<P>The Cathedral is far from extraordinary.</P>
<P>Several of the Churches are very neat, and beau∣tifully decorated, and worthy a Traveller's Attention. That of <HI>St. Mary Radcliffe,</HI> or <HI>Redcliff,</HI> is a noble and stately Edifice. It is very large and spacious, and has a fine Steeple or Tower.</P>
<P>In it is a very antient Monument for Mr. <HI>William Cannings,</HI> Burgess and Merchant of <HI>Bristol,</HI> the Foun∣der of the Church, and a great Benefactor otherwise to the City of <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>
<P>On one Part of the Monument is a <HI>Latin</HI> Inscrip∣tion, full of Abbreviations; and, on the other Side, in <HI>English,</HI> an Inscription to his Praise, which I have not room to insert.</P>
<P>Here is also an Inscription on the Monument of Sir <HI>William Penn,</HI> Knt. Vice-Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> the Fa∣ther of the great <HI>William Penn,</HI> one of the Heads of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> who was a Native of the City of <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>
<P>A great Face of Seriousness and Religion appears at <HI>Bristol,</HI> and the Magistrates are laudably strict in exacting the Observation of the Sabbath, consider∣ing the general Dissoluteness that has broken in almost every-where else.</P>
<P>One thing they deserve high Commendation for; and that is the Neatness observ'd in keeping their Churches, and the Care they take in preserving the
<PB N="274" REF="283"/>
Monuments and Inscriptions of those bury'd in 'em. A Practice scandalously neglected almost every-where else in <HI>England,</HI> and even at Places we might men∣tion, where Money (another scandalous Practice) is exacted for seeing them. This Care of the Monu∣ments of the Dead brings many Visitors to their Churches of travelling Strangers, who are always pleas'd with it, and make Comparisons in its Favour, tho' very little to the Credit of some others, who are more negligent. 'Tis indeed strange, That the Heirs and Families of the Deceased should not think them∣selves more concern'd, than they generally are, to keep up the Monuments of their Ancestors. With great Piety, and at a great Expence, the next Heir, or the most oblig'd, rears a Monument to the Deceas'd, and it is dedicated, too, professedly, to Posterity. In a very little while, the Monument is cover'd with Dust and Cobwebs, and the Inscription often effaced. Com∣mon Decency does not succeed to this Piety, and it becomes a Monument of the Ingratitude or Neglect of the Survivors, rather than an Honour to the De∣ceas'd.</P>
<P>Methinks Vanity alone, the common Inducement to these Erections, should inspire another Manner of Acting. I cannot account for it any other way, but that from the Prince to the Peasant, as a Family generally lies together in one Vault or Tomb, very few are willing to see or think of their Coffins; and hence it is, That some Men often look upon their very Heirs as <HI>Memento Mori's.</HI> Unhappy Narrow∣ness of Mind, equally to be lamented and despis'd!</P>
<P><HI>Bristol</HI> is supposed to have an hundred thousand Inhabitants in the City, and within three Miles of its Circumference; and they say, above Three Thou∣sand Sail of Ships belong to that Port.</P>
<P>'Tis very remarkable, That this City is so well supply'd with Coals, that tho' they are all brought by Land Carriage, yet they are generally laid down
<PB N="275" REF="284"/>
at the Doors of the Inhabitants, at seven, eight, or nine Shillings <HI>per</HI> Chaldron.</P>
<P>The Situation of the City is low, but on the Side of a rising Hill. The Ground Plat of it is said very much to resemble that of old <HI>Rome,</HI> being circular, with a something greater Diameter one way than an∣other, but enough to make it oval; and the River cutting off one small Part, as it were, a Sixth, or less, from the rest.</P>
<P>The Bridge over the <HI>Avon</HI> is exceeding strong, the Arches very high, because of the Depth of Wa∣ter, and the Buildings so close upon it, that in pas∣sing the Bridge, you see nothing but an intire full-built Street. The Tide of Flood rises here near six Fathom, and runs very strong.</P>
<P>They draw all their heavy Goods here on <HI>Sleds,</HI> or <HI>Sledges,</HI> which they call <HI>Gee-hoes,</HI> without Wheels. This kills a Multitude of Horses; and the Pavement is worn so smooth by them, that in wet Weather the Streets are very slippery, and in frosty Weather 'tis dangerous walking.</P>
<P>The noble Charities of Mr. <HI>Edward Colston,</HI> a worthy Merchant of <HI>Bristol,</HI> and his Foundations, are an Honour to the Place, and to the Memory of that excellent Man: and I am sorry, that my narrow Limits will not permit me to give a particular Account of them.</P>
<P>But I ought not to omit, that one of his Cha∣rities only, cost him 25000<HI>l.</HI> and that is the noble Hospital or Alms-house erected by him, in the Year 1691, upon his own Ground, on <HI>St. Mi∣chael's-Hill.</HI> The Front and two Sides are fac'd with Freestone: it contains a Chapel neatly adorn'd, 24 Apartments, and other Conveniencies, for 12 Men, and 12 Women. The elder Brother receives 6<HI>s.</HI> and each of the others 3<HI>s.</HI> weekly, besides an Allowance for Coal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To a Clergyman is paid the Sum of 10<HI>l.</HI> yearly, for reading the <HI>Common</HI>
<PB N="276" REF="285"/>
<HI>Prayer</HI> twice every Day, except when Prayers are read in <HI>St. Michael</HI>'s Church, at which every Mem∣ber of this Alms-house is to attend.</P>
<P>In the Year 1696, he also purchas'd a Piece of Ground in <HI>Temple-street,</HI> and built at his own Charge a School and Dwelling-house, for a Master to instruct 40 Boys, in Writing, Arithmetick, and the Church Catechism. The Boys are likewise to be cloathed.</P>
<P>And his other Charities and Benefactions were without Number.</P>
<P>On <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s Day, <HI>June</HI> 29. 1738, was open'd at the Mint, an Infirmary for this City, for the Re∣ception of the sick, lame, and distressed Poor, after the Example of those in <HI>London, Winchester,</HI> &amp;c. It is denominated <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s Hospital, and very liberal Contributions have been made to it; and par∣ticularly, we are told, that <HI>John Elbridge,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Comptroller of the Customs in this City, who dy'd <HI>February</HI> 1738-9, besides many other charitable Do∣nations, bequeathed 5000<HI>l.</HI> to this Infirmary, besides endowing a Charity School on <HI>St. Michael</HI>'s Hill, which he built several Years before his Death, for edu∣cating and cloathing a certain Number of poor Girls.</P>
<P>Large Pieces of Ground are clear'd for building a Market, and a magnificent Exchange; the former in <HI>High-street,</HI> and the latter in <HI>Corn-street.</HI> The old Buildings which have been destroy'd for that Pur∣pose, have cost the Chamber of this City upwards of Twenty thousand Pounds. And on the 10th of <HI>March</HI> 1740-1, the first Stone of the Exchange was laid by the Mayor, with great Ceremony, with several Pieces of Gold and Silver Coin under it, and this Inscription, on the Stone:
<Q><HI>Regnante GEORGIO</HI> II. <HI>Pio, Felici, Augusto, Libertatis &amp; Rei Mercatoriae Domi Forisque Vindice, primarium Lapidem hujusce Aedificii, Suffragio Civium, &amp; Aere publico extructi, posuit</HI> HENRICUS COMBE, <HI>Praetor, A. C.</HI> MDCCXL.</Q> <PB N="277" REF="286"/>That is,
<Q><HI>In the Reign of</HI> GEORGE II. <HI>Pious, Prosperous, August, Vindicator, at Home and Abroad, of Li∣berty and Trade,</HI> HENRY COMBE, <HI>Mayor, placed the First Stone of this Structure erected by the Votes of the Citizens, and at the publick Ex∣pence,</HI> A. D. 1740.</Q></P>
<P>This Edifice when finish'd, will be one of the com∣pletest of its Kind in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The old Library in <HI>King-street</HI> is rebuilding in a very handsome Manner, as is also <HI>Merchant-Taylors-Hall</HI> in <HI>Broad-street,</HI> a Freestone Building near 70 Feet long, and Breadth proportionable.</P>
<P>From this City I had Thoughts of coasting the Marshes or Border of <HI>Wales,</HI> especially <HI>South-Wales,</HI> by tracing the Rivers <HI>Wye</HI> and <HI>Lug,</HI> in <HI>Monmouth</HI> and <HI>Herefordshire:</HI> but chang'd my Mind on Occa∣sion of the Danger of the Ferries over the <HI>Severn.</HI> In the mean time, I resolv'd to follow the Course of this famous River, by which I should necessarily see the richest, most fertile, and most agreeable Part of <HI>England</HI>; the Banks of the <HI>Thames</HI> only excepted.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bristol,</HI> West, you enter the County of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and keeping the <HI>Avon</HI> in View, you see <HI>King-Road,</HI> where the Ships generally take their De∣parture, as ours at <HI>London</HI> do from <HI>Gravesend,</HI> and <HI>Hung-Road</HI>; and where they notify their Arrival, as ours for <HI>London</HI> do in the <HI>Downs.</HI> The one lies within the <HI>Avon,</HI> the other in the <HI>Severn Sea.</HI> In∣deed great Part of <HI>Bristol</HI> is in the Bounds of <HI>Glou∣cestershire,</HI> though it be a County of itself. From hence going away a little North-west, we come to the <HI>Pill,</HI> a convenient Road for Shipping, and where therefore they generally run back for <HI>Ireland,</HI> or for <HI>Wales.</HI> There is also, a little farther, an ugly, dan∣gerous, and very inconvenient Ferry over the <HI>Severn,</HI> to the Mouth of <HI>Wye</HI>; namely, at <HI>Aust</HI>; which I shall mention again presently.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="287"/>As we turn <HI>North</HI> towards <HI>Gloucester,</HI> we lose the Sight of the <HI>Avon,</HI> and, in about two Miles, exchange it for an open View of the <HI>Severn Sea,</HI> which you see on the West Side, and which seems as broad as the Ocean there; except that you see two small Islands in it, and that looking N. W. you discern plainly the Coast of <HI>South-Wales</HI>; and particularly, a little nearer hand, the Shore of <HI>Monmouthshire.</HI> Then, as you go on, the Shores begin to draw towards one another, and the Coasts to lie parallel; so that the <HI>Severn</HI> appears to be a plain River, or an <HI>Aestu∣arium,</HI> somewhat like the <HI>Humber,</HI> or as the <HI>Thames</HI> is at the <HI>Nore,</HI> being 4 to 5 and 6 Miles over; and is indeed a most raging and furious kind of Sea. This is occasion'd by those violent Tides call'd the <HI>Bore,</HI> which flow here sometimes 6 or 7 Feet at once, rol∣ling forward like a mighty Wave: so that the Stern of a Vessel shall on a sudden be lifted up 6 or 7 Feet upon the Water, when the Head of it is fast a-ground.</P>
<P>After Coasting the Shore about 4 Miles farther, the Road being by the low Salt Marshes kept at a Distance from the River; we came to <HI>Aust</HI> Ferry, from a little dirty Village call'd <HI>Aust</HI>; near which you come to take Boat.</P>
<P>This Ferry lands you at <HI>Beachly</HI> in <HI>Monmouth∣shire,</HI> so that on the Outside it is call'd <HI>Aust Passage,</HI> and on the other Side <HI>Beachly Passage.</HI> From whence you go by Land two little Miles to <HI>Chep∣stow,</HI> a large Port Town on the River <HI>Wye.</HI> But of that Part I shall say more in its Place.</P>
<P>Here is a good neat Chapel, with an high Tower at the West-end, adorned with Pinacles.</P>
<P>This Place is memorable from a Circumstance in the Reign of King <HI>Edw.</HI> I. who being here, invited <HI>Lewellin</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> who was on the other Side, to come over and confer with him, and settle some Matters in Dispute between them; but the
<PB N="279" REF="288"/>
Prince refused, and the King thereupon cross'd over to him, who, in a Rapture of Generosity, leap'd into the Water, to receive the King in his Boat, telling him, His Humility had conquer'd his Pride, and his Wisdom triumphed over his Folly.</P>
<P>When we came to <HI>Aust,</HI> the hither Side of the <HI>Passage,</HI> the Sea was so broad, the Fame of the <HI>Bore</HI> of the Tide so formidable, the Wind also made the Water so rough, and, which was worse, the Boats to carry over both Man and Horse appear'd so very mean, that, in short, none of us car'd to venture: so we came back, and resolv'd to keep on the Road to <HI>Gloucester.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thornbury</HI> is a Market Town, and hath a Custo∣mary Mayor and 12 Aldermen, and was given in the Conqueror's Time to the famous <HI>Fitz-Hammon.</HI> Here are the Foundations of a large Castle, design'd but never finish'd, by the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> in King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.'s Time. Here is a spacious Church built Cathedral-wise, it has fine wide Ayles, and 3 Chancels, with a high and beautiful Tower. Here is a Free-School and 4 small Alms-houses.</P>
<P>On the right lies <HI>Wotton,</HI> a pretty Market-town, governed by a Mayor elected annually at the Court-Leet. 'Tis famous for its Cloathing Trade. The Church, which is a Vicarage, is large, and hath Two wide Ayles, and an high handsome Tower, adorned with Battlements and Pinacles. There are in it di∣vers Tombs, Monuments, and Inscriptions, chiefly for the Family of <HI>Berkley.</HI> Here is a Free-school and some Charity-houses.</P>
<P>Directly North of this Town lies <HI>Dursley,</HI> a good Cloathing and Market Town, governed by a Bailiff and 4 Constables, and has been formerly noted for sharp, over-reaching People, from whence arose a Proverbial Saying of a sharp Man, <HI>He is a Man of</HI> Dursley. The Church is good, hath 2 Ayles, and an handsome Spire.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="289"/>Turning North-west, we came to <HI>Berkley,</HI> a noted Town, so called from <HI>Berk,</HI> a Beech, and <HI>Leas,</HI> Pas∣ture. It is the largest Parish in the County, and consists of rich Meadow-grounds, and above 30 Parishes depend on this Manor, for which a Fee∣farm Rent was paid, in King <HI>Henry</HI> II.'s Time, of 500<HI>l.</HI> 17<HI>s.</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> which shews the vast Extent and Value of this Estate. It belongs to the present Earl of <HI>Berkley,</HI> who is also Baron of <HI>Dursley.</HI> Adjoin∣ing to this Town is the strong Castle of <HI>Berkley,</HI> a magnificent, tho' antique Building, and the antient Seat of this noble Family, from whence it derives its Name as well as Title, ever since the Time of King <HI>Henry</HI> II. who gave it to <HI>Robert Fitzharding,</HI> who assumed the Name of <HI>Berkley,</HI> and from whom the present Earl is lineally descended. King <HI>Edw.</HI> II. of <HI>England,</HI> as all our learned Writers agree, was murder'd in this Castle; as King <HI>Richard</HI> II. was in that of <HI>Pontefract,</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire</HI>; but I refer to our Histories for these horrid Facts. They shew the Apartments, where they say that King was kept a Prisoner: but they do not admit that he was kill'd there. The Place is rather antient, than pleasant or healthful, lying low, and near the Water. Here is a large spacious Church, with an Ayle on each Side, and a Chapel adjoining, which is the Burial-place of the Family, a neat Vestry, and a strong high Tower.</P>
<P>On the Right of the Road is <HI>Stanley,</HI> a little Mar∣ket-town, where was formerly a Priory, the Ruins whereof appear still. The Church is built in the Form of a Cross, with a Tower in the middle.</P>
<P>A great Improvement has been lately made in these Parts; for the Earl of <HI>Berkley</HI> has just finished (1740) a great Bulwark at <HI>Frampton</HI> upon <HI>Severn,</HI> near this Place, called <HI>Hock-Crib,</HI> the Design of which is to inforce the River <HI>Severn,</HI> by <HI>Art's-Point,</HI> into its former Chanel. It is said his Lordship intends to
<PB N="281" REF="290"/>
build another, four Miles below the former, by which he will undoubtedly gain a large Tract of Land, contiguous to what is call'd the <HI>New Grounds,</HI> infe∣rior to none in <HI>England</HI> for the Richness of its Soil.</P>
<P>From hence we saw, across the River, the antient Forest of <HI>Dean,</HI> which once contained 30000 Acres of Land, being Twenty Miles long, and so full of Wood, that it was very dangerous to travel through it. Its Oak was famous for Shipping, the Glory of our own, and so much the Envy of other Nations, that the famous <HI>Spanish Armada</HI> had it in special Charge to burn it. The great Number of Iron Forges near it has greatly lessened, tho' not con∣sum'd the Wood, which is still preserved with great Care. It is subject to Forest-Laws, and the Iron-Miners have here a Court also.</P>
<P>From hence to <HI>Gloucester,</HI> we see nothing consi∣derable, but a most fertile, rich Country, and a fine River, but narrower, as you go Northward, till, a little before we come to <HI>Gloucester,</HI> it ceases to be navigable by Ships of Burden, but continues to be so, by large Barges, above an hundred Miles farther, not reckoning the Turnings and Windings of the River: besides that it receives several large and na∣vigable Rivers into it.</P>
<P><HI>Gloucester</HI> (call'd by the <HI>Britons, Caer-glow,</HI> i. e. <HI>Fine City,</HI> and in Imitation of it <HI>Glevum</HI> by the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI>) abounds much with Crosses and Statues of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> and has an handsome Prospect of Steeples, some without a Church; for in the late Civil Wars, when it held out vigorously against King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and was then very strong, it suffer'd much; for its Eleven Churches were then reduced to Five, and all its Walls and Works were demolished. The City is still tolerably built; and here is a large Stone Bridge over the <HI>Severn,</HI> the first next the Sea. Here are several Market-houses supported with Pillars, one a very old one of Stone, in <HI>Gothick</HI> Architecture,
<PB N="282" REF="291"/>
antient and uncommon, now turn'd into a Cistern for Water.</P>
<P>The old Proverb, <HI>As sure as God's at</HI> Gloucester, certainly alluded to the vast Number of Churches and religious Foundations here; for you can scarce walk past 10 Doors, but somewhat of that sort occurs.</P>
<P>The Cathedral is an old venerable Pile. The Western Part is old and mean; but from the Tower, which is very handsome, you have a most glorious Prospect Eastward, thro' the Choir finely vaulted at top; and the Ladies Chapel to the East Window, which is very magnificent. On the North-side lies that unfortunate King <HI>Edw.</HI> II. in an Alabaster Tomb, and, out of the Abundance of pious Offerings to his Remains, the Religious built this Choir; and the Votaries to his Shrine, for some time after his Death, could hardly find Room in the Town. So changeable are the Tempers of Men! and so little a Space is requir'd to dispose the Minds of the fluctu∣ating Many, to <HI>Hosannah</HI> or <HI>Crucify!</HI></P>
<P>Before the High Altar in the Middle of the Church, lies the equally unfortunate Prince <HI>Robert,</HI> eldest Son of the Conqueror, after a miserable Life for many Years before his Death. But his Monument re∣mains, and his Bones are at Rest; which is more than can be said of the Monument of his younger Brother, King <HI>Henry</HI> I. who, as the second Brother <HI>William Rufus</HI> had done, robbed him of his Right, and no Traces of his Monument are left at <HI>Reading-Abbey,</HI> where he was bury'd with his Queen. He lies in a wooden Tomb, with his Coat of Arms painted, and upon it his Effigies in <HI>Irish</HI> Oak, cross∣legg'd like a <HI>Jerusalem</HI> Knight. The famous <HI>Strong∣bow,</HI> who subdued <HI>Ireland,</HI> lies buried in the Chapter-house.</P>
<P>The Cloysters in this Cathedral are exquisitely beautiful, in the Style of the Chapel of <HI>King's-College, Cambridge.</HI> There are large Remains in the City
<PB N="283" REF="292"/>
of Abbeys of Black and White Friers. A Mile or two distant is <HI>Robin Hood</HI>'s Hill, as it is called, which affords now a pleasant Walk for the Citizens, and from which they are attempting to supply the City with Water, which it much wants. By this City, the <HI>Rickning</HI> Way runs from the <HI>Severn</HI>'s Mouth into <HI>Yorkshire.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants boast much of the Antiquity of their first Cathedral, which they pretend had Bishops and Preachers here <HI>Anno</HI> 189: The <HI>first</HI> Cathedral, we say; for, it has been, as reported, thrice destroy'd by Fire.</P>
<P><HI>William the Conqueror</HI> gave this City and Castle to the famous <HI>Robert Fitz-Hammon,</HI> afterwards Lord of <HI>Glamorgan. Edol,</HI> one of the <HI>British</HI> Nobles, who at∣tended King <HI>Vortigern</HI> to the Congress appointed by <HI>Hengist,</HI> was Earl of this Place. He was a Man of great personal Strength, and seeing the <HI>Saxons</HI> draw∣ing forth their conceal'd Weapons, he disarm'd one of them, and fought valiantly; but being overpower'd by Numbers, he escap'd to this City, after having kill'd 70 <HI>Saxons</HI> with his own Hands. Afterwards, in a Battle fought against the <HI>Saxons</HI> near the River <HI>Don,</HI> he fix'd his Eye upon <HI>Hengist,</HI> and never quitted him, till he took him Prisoner, and struck off his Head.</P>
<P>In the little Isle of <HI>Alney,</HI> near this Town, the famous single Combat was fought between <HI>Edmund Ironside</HI> and <HI>Canute</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> for the whole King∣dom, in Sight of both their Armies.</P>
<P>The City is governed by a Mayor, 12 Aldermen, and 24 Common-council-men. It has also an High-Steward, (who is usually a Nobleman) and a Re∣corder. They are allow'd the highest Marks of magistratical Honour, Scarlet Gowns, the Sword, and Cap of Maintenance, and 4 Sergeants at Mace. Here are 12 Companies, the Masters whereof attend the Mayor on all publick Occasions in their Gowns,
<PB N="284" REF="293"/>
and with Streamers. It has a large Quay and Wharf on the River for Trade, and a Custom-house. Here is also a Town-hall for the Assizes and publick Bu∣siness, which they call the <HI>Booth-hall,</HI> and great Part of the Castle is still standing.</P>
<P>The first Protestant Bishop of this Church was that truly Reverend and Religious Divine, Dr. <HI>John Hooper,</HI> who was burnt to Death in the Cemetery of his own Cathedral, in the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>The Whispering-place in this Cathedral formerly pass'd for a kind of Wonder among the Vulgar; but since, Experience has taught the easily-compre∣hended Reason of the Thing; and there is now the like in the Church of <HI>St. Paul, London.</HI></P>
<P>Here is great Provision for the Poor by Hospitals; particularly <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s Hospital maintains 54 Men and Women, to whom belong a Minister, Phy∣sician and Surgeon. And Sir <HI>Thomas Rich,</HI> Bart. a Native of this Place, gave 6000<HI>l.</HI> by Will, for a <HI>Blue-Coat</HI> Hospital, wherein are educated 20 poor Boys; and 10 poor Men and 10 Women are main∣tain'd, and cloath'd annually. Besides these and three more, there are many Benefactions to encou∣rage young Tradesmen, and place out Boys Appren∣tices. And they have lately erected an Infirmary here, after the laudable Example of that of <HI>Win∣chester,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>At <HI>Lassington,</HI> near <HI>Gloucester,</HI> are found certain Stones about the Breadth of a Silver Peny, and Thick∣ness of a Half-crown, called <HI>Astroites</HI> or Star-stones, being fine-pointed like a Star, and flat. They are of a greyish Colour, and the flat Sides are naturally finely engraven, as it were. But I have taken No∣tice of these before.</P>
<P>From <HI>Gloucester</HI> we kept Eastward, and soon came to <HI>Cheltenham,</HI> a Market-town, where is still a pretty good Trade carried on in Malt, but not so considerable as formerly. Here is a good Church in
<PB N="285" REF="294"/>
the Form of a Cross, with Ayles on each Side, and a Spire rising in the Middle, noted for a good Ring of Bells. But what is more remarkable is, that the Minister is to be nominated by, and must be a Fellow of, <HI>Jesus-College, Oxon,</HI> (tho' the Vicarage is but 40<HI>l.</HI> a Year) but approv'd of by the Earl of <HI>Gains∣borough</HI>; and he can't hold it more than six Years. Here is a Free-school, an Hospital, and some other Charities.</P>
<P>The Mineral Waters lately discovered at <HI>Chelten∣ham,</HI> which are of the <HI>Scarborough</HI> Kind, are what will make this Place still more and more remarkable, and frequented. An eminent Physician has obliged me with the following Account of their Nature, and Qualities.</P>
<P>These Waters, he observes, were first found out by the Flocks of all the neighbouring Pigeons going constantly thither to provoke their Appetites, as well as to quench the uncommon Thirst of these salacious hot Birds. I have been informed, says he, by a Phy∣sician of Credit and Experience, who had made all the common Trials on them, and observed their Effects on many Persons of various Constitutions, and in different Distempers, who had drank them, That, on Evaporation, they were found to contain, in a Gallon, eight Drachms of a nitrous Salt, with two Drachms of an alcalious Earth: That they were compounded of a large Quantity of Nitre, to which they owed their purgative Virtue; a light Sulphur, which the fetid Dejections manifested; and a vola∣tile Steel, discoverable by a transparent blue Colour, when mix'd with an Infusion of Nut-galls. Alca∣lious Spirits have no Effect on them; but they fer∣ment with Acids. He further adds, That there might be found some other Materials in their Com∣position, perhaps, if more minutely examined and tortured: but that these mentioned Principles were evident and incontestable, and were sufficient to ac∣count
<PB N="286" REF="295"/>
for all their Effects and Operation; the others (if there be any) being of little Efficacy. In the Operation they empty the Bowels according to their Dose, but gently, mildly, and easily, without Sick∣ness, Nausea, Gripes, or causing great Lowness, far beyond any artificial Purges whatsoever. They give a good Appetite, an easy Digestion, and quiet Nights, in all Nephritick and Gouty Cases, when not under the Fit; in all Rheumatick, Scrophulous, Scorbutic, or Leprous Cases; but especially in Spermatic, Uri∣nary, or Haemorrhoidal Cases, he thinks them so∣vereign, and not to be match'd. In a Word, in all Inflammatory Cases of whatever Kind, and what∣ever Part, he thinks them one of the most salutary Means which can be used. Those of pretty strong Nerves, and firm Constitutions, bear them with high Spirits, great Pleasure, and Profit; but they do not at all suit with those of weak Nerves, Paralytick, Hypo∣chondriack, or Hysterick Disorders, or those who are subject to any kind of Fits, Cramps, or Convulsions: they ruffle such too much, as generally all Purga∣tives do. He thinks they have a great Affinity to the <HI>Scarborough</HI> Waters, and might do great Cures in most Chronical Distempers, if Exercise, and a proper Regimen, were directed with them.</P>
<P>Following the Road towards <HI>Warwick</HI> directly, we arriv'd at <HI>Winchcomb,</HI> a small Market-town, situate in a Bottom, in the midst of good Pasture and Arable Lands, but of no great Account. The Church is a good Building, hath two Ayles, a large Chancel, and a lofty Tower adorn'd with Battlements and Pina∣cles. It is remarkable, that it is a Curacy worth no more than 10<HI>l.</HI> a Year, tho' the Impropriation is worth 300<HI>l.</HI> annually. Here was formerly a very rich Abbey, whereof the Abbot was Mitred, founded by <HI>Offa</HI> King of <HI>Mercia.</HI></P>
<P>Here we turned from the Road, and struck N.W. to <HI>Tewksbury,</HI> encompassed with 4 Rivers; the <HI>Avon</HI>
<PB N="287" REF="296"/>
and <HI>Carran</HI> on the N. the <HI>Severn</HI> on the W. and the <HI>Swyliate</HI> on the S. 'Tis govern'd by 2 Bailiffs, and 24 Burgesses; and its Neighbourhood to <HI>Cotswold-Downs</HI> makes the Cloathing Trade flourish here. It is a large and very populous Town, situate upon the <HI>Warwickshire</HI> River <HI>Avon,</HI> so call'd to distinguish it from the <HI>Bristol Avon,</HI> and others. The Town was long famous for its Mustard-balls, as also for a great Manufacture of Stockens; as are also <HI>Camp∣den</HI> in this County, and <HI>Pershore</HI> in <HI>Worcestershire.</HI></P>
<P>The great old Church at <HI>Tewksbury</HI> may be called one of the largest Churches in <HI>England,</HI> that is not Collegiate or Cathedral. It is very high, has two spacious Ayles, a stately Tower, and a large Chancel. The Communion-Table is one intire Marble Stone near 14 Feet long, and 3 and ½ broad.</P>
<P>The Town is famous for the decisive Battle fought between the Houses of <HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> IV. of the latter House, who was Conqueror.</P>
<P>As <HI>Tewksbury</HI> lies on the Borders of <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> we soon entered that County, and came to <HI>Upton,</HI> an antient Market-Town of some Note upon the <HI>Severn,</HI> over which it has a good Bridge. <HI>Roman</HI> Coins are frequently dug up here.</P>
<P>On the Left, Westward of this Town, and which parts this County from that of <HI>Hereford,</HI> are <HI>Mal∣vern</HI> Hills, which consist of large Mountains, prodi∣giously high and lofty, gradually rising one above another for about 7 Miles together. On these Hills are two Villages, call'd <HI>Great Malvern</HI> and <HI>Little Malvern,</HI> at the Distance of about Two Miles from each other, each having had formerly an Abbey of <HI>Benedictines,</HI> the last lying in a dismal Cavity be∣tween the Hills. On the very Top of these Hills may be seen the Ruins of a prodigious Ditch, which <HI>Gilbert</HI> Earl of <HI>Gloucester</HI> dug, to separate his Posses∣sions
<PB N="288" REF="297"/>
from those of the Church of <HI>Hereford.</HI> On these Hills are 2 Medicinal Springs, called <HI>Holy Wells:</HI> one is good for the Eyes, and putrid fetid Livers; and the other for Cancers.</P>
<P>From <HI>Upton</HI> we travelled North-east, and came to <HI>Pershore,</HI> which lies on the lower <HI>London</HI> Road to <HI>Worcester:</HI> it is said to be so called from the great Number of Pear-trees, which thrive plentifully here. It is a pleasant Market-Town lying on the <HI>Avon,</HI> and famous for the Stocken Trade, as I have men∣tioned before.</P>
<P>Eastward of this Town stands <HI>Evesham,</HI> situate on a gentle Ascent from the same River, over which it hath a Bridge of 7 stately Arches. It is an antient Mayor-town, and has the Privilege to try Felons. It is memorable for the decisive Battle, wherein <HI>Simon Montfort</HI> and the Barons were defeated by Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> afterwards King <HI>Edward</HI> I. who thereby released his Father out of Captivity. Here are 2 Churches, with small Spire Steeples; but nei∣ther of them has any Bells, which have been re∣moved to a famous Tower built by Abbot <HI>Litchfield,</HI> and stands near these Churches.</P>
<P>All around this Town lies that fruitful and plen∣tiful Country, call'd from this Place, <HI>The Vale of Evesham,</HI> which runs all along the Banks of the <HI>Avon,</HI> from <HI>Tewksbury</HI> to <HI>Pershore,</HI> and to <HI>Stratford</HI> upon <HI>Avon,</HI> in the South Part of <HI>Warwickshire</HI>; which River is so far navigable.</P>
<P>The Parish Church of <HI>Stratford</HI> is very old. In it we saw the Monument of the inimitable <HI>Shake∣speare,</HI> whose Dramatick Performances set him at the Head of the <HI>British</HI> Theatre, and will make him renown'd to the End of Time. His Busto is in the Wall on the North-side of the Church, and a flat Grave-stone covers the Body, in the Ayle just un∣der him; on which Grave-stone these Lines are written:
<Q><PB N="289" REF="298"/>
<L><HI>Good Friend, for Jesus' sake, forbear</HI></L>
<L><HI>To move the Dust that resteth here.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Blest be the Man that spares these Stones;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And curst be he, that moves my Bones!</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Over the <HI>Avon</HI> at <HI>Stratford</HI> is built a fair Stone Bridge of 14 Arches, with a long Causeway at the West End of it, wall'd on both Sides.</P>
<P>The Navigation of this River <HI>Avon</HI> is an exceeding Advantage to all this Part of the Country, and also to the Commerce of the City of <HI>Bristol.</HI> For by this River they drive a very great Trade for Sugar, Oil, Wine, Tobacco, Iron, Lead, and, in a Word, all heavy, Goods which are usually carried by Water almost as far as <HI>Warwick</HI>; and in Return, the Corn, and especially Cheese, are carried back from <HI>Glou∣cestershire</HI> and <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> to <HI>Bristol</HI>; for <HI>Glou∣cester</HI> Cheese is excellent of the kind, and this County drives a great Trade in it.</P>
<P>This Vale extending itself in <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> and under the Ridge of little Mountains call'd <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> is there call'd the Vale of <HI>Red-horse.</HI> All the Grounds, put together, make a most pleasant Corn Country, especially remarkable for the Goodness of the Air, and Fertility of the Soil.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Stretford,</HI> on the Borders of this County of <HI>Worcester,</HI> is <HI>Alcester,</HI> a Market-town, much frequented by Dealers in Corn: it is of great Antiquity; as appears by old Foundations of Build∣ings made of <HI>Roman</HI> Brick, and Gold, Silver and Brass Coins found here. The old <HI>Roman</HI> Way, called <HI>Ikenild-street,</HI> passes thro' the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Gloucestershire</HI> must not be passed over, without some Account of another pleasant and fruitful Vale, which crosses part of the Country, from East to West, on that Side of the <HI>Cotswold,</HI> and which is called <HI>Stroud-water</HI>; famous not only for the finest Cloths, but for dying those Cloths of the beautifulest
<PB N="290" REF="299"/>
Scarlets, and other grand Colours, that are any∣where in <HI>England,</HI> perhaps in any Part of the World. Here I saw Two Pieces of Broad-cloth made, one Scarlet, the other Crimson in Grain, which were sent as Presents, the one to the late King <HI>George,</HI> whilst Elector, and the other to his present Majesty, which were very graciously accepted. The Cloth was valued at 45<HI>s. per</HI> Yard, and was well worth it; for nothing so rich of that kind had been ever made in <HI>England</HI> before, as I was informed.</P>
<P>The Clothiers lie all along the Banks of this River, for near 20 Miles, and in the Town of <HI>Stroud,</HI> which lies in the middle of it, as also at <HI>Paynswick,</HI> which I have mentioned before. The River makes its Way to the <HI>Severn,</HI> about Five Miles below <HI>Gloucester.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Tewksbury,</HI> North, it is 12 Miles to <HI>Worcester,</HI> along the Banks of the <HI>Severn,</HI> where I was wonderfully delighted with the <HI>Hedge-rows,</HI> lin'd all the Way with Apple and Pear-trees, full of Fruit, and those so common, that any Passengers, as they travel the Road, may gather and eat what they please. Here also, as well as in <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> you meet with Cyder in the Publick-houses, sold as Beer and Ale is in other Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and as cheap.</P>
<P>We saw at a Distance, in a most agreeable Situa∣tion, the Seat of Sir <HI>Herbert Perrot Pakington,</HI> a Baronet of a very antient Family.</P>
<P>On the other Side of the <HI>Severn,</HI> at <HI>Whitley-court,</HI> five Miles from <HI>Bewdly,</HI> and seven from <HI>Worcester,</HI> the Lord <HI>Foley</HI> has a Seat, situate in a large Park.</P>
<P><HI>Worcester,</HI> the <HI>Branonium</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> seems to have been built by them to curb the <HI>Silures</HI> on the other Side of the <HI>Severn,</HI> and in Imitation of the <HI>Roman</HI> Name the <HI>Britons</HI> called it <HI>Caer Wran∣gon.</HI> It is situate in a Valley on the <HI>Severn,</HI> which tho' generally rapid elsewhere, glides on here very gently. It is a large, populous, antient, well-built
<PB N="291" REF="300"/>
City, and the best paved in <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Foregate-street</HI> is the most regular and beautiful that can be seen out of <HI>London.</HI> The <HI>Guild-hall</HI> is a very fine Building; but the Statues on the Outside disgrace it.</P>
<P>There is a good old Stone Bridge over the <HI>Severn,</HI> which stands exceeding high from the Surface of the Water, and has a Tower upon it, said to be built by the <HI>Romans.</HI> But as the Stream of the <HI>Severn</HI> is contracted here by the Buildings on either Side, there is evident Occasion sometimes for the Height of the Bridge, the Waters rising to an incredible Degree in the Winter-time.</P>
<P>The Commandery here formerly belonging to <HI>St. John's of Jerusalem,</HI> is now possessed by Mr. <HI>Wylde,</HI> and is a fine old House of Timber, in the Form of a Court. The Hall, roof'd with <HI>Irish</HI> Oak, makes one Side of it, built for the Reception of Pilgrims. The Windows are adorn'd with Imagery, and Coats Armorial of stained Glass. It stands just without the South Gate of the City in the <HI>London</HI> Road, where the Heat of the famous Battle happen'd between King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI>; and they frequently find Bones of the Slain, on digging in the Garden. Above in the Park is to be seen a great Work of Four Bastions, called <HI>the Royal Mount,</HI> whence a <HI>Vallum</HI> and Ditch run both ways to incompass this Side of the City. Here, 'tis probable, the Storm began, when the Royalists were driven back into the City with great Slaughter, and the King escaped being made a Prisoner in the narrow Street at this Gate, by a loaded Cart of Hay pur∣posely overthrown, which gave him time to retire at the opposite Gate to <HI>Boscobel,</HI> or <HI>White Lady's.</HI></P>
<P>A Mile and half above the South Gate, on the Top of the Hall, is the celebrated <HI>Perrywood,</HI> where <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Army lay, and which affords a fine Pro∣spect over the County.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="301"/>The Cathedral is an antient Building. The Body of the Church makes no extraordinary Appearance on the Outside. The Tower is low, without any Spire, only four very small Pinacles on the Corners; and yet it has some little Beauty in it, more than the Church itself. The upper Part has some Images in it, but decay'd by Time. In it is bury'd the restless King <HI>John</HI>; not where now his Monument stands, which is in the Choir, before the high Altar; but under a little Stone before the Altar of the Eastermost Wall of the Church. On each Side of him, on the Ground, lie the Effigies of the two Bishops, his chief Saints, <HI>Wolston</HI> and <HI>Oswald,</HI> from whose Neigh∣bourhood he hoped to be safe. The Image of the King probably lay here also upon the Ground, now elevated upon a Tomb in the said Choir.</P>
<P>On the South Side of the High Altar is a large and handsome Stone Chapel over the Monument of Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> eldest Son of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. who died at <HI>Ludlow,</HI> as his Tomb-stone specifies, <HI>Anno</HI> 1502; and whose Relict <HI>Catharine</HI> Infanta of <HI>Spain,</HI> his Brother <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. marrying, after 20 Years Wedlock, was divorced from, to make way for <HI>Anna Bolen.</HI> The Choir of this Chapel is exquisite Workmanship; but suffered much in the late Civil Wars.</P>
<P>Here is also, among other noted Monuments, one for that famous Countess of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> who dancing before <HI>Edward</HI> III. in his great Hall at <HI>Windsor,</HI> dropt her Garter, which the King taking up, honoured it so much (as the idle Story goes) as to make it the denominating Ensign of <HI>The most Noble Order of the Garter</HI>; but this I have refuted under my Account of <HI>Windsor.</HI> Tho', that the Countess did drop her Garter, is Fact; and the King might gallantly, to silence the Jests and Railleries of the Court, wear it during the Entertainment, instead of his Garter of the Order. But the Motto was given
<PB N="293" REF="302"/>
in Allusion to the Order of Knighthood, and not of the Garter.</P>
<P>The Monument is very fine, and there is this re∣markable in it; that there are several Angels cut in Stone about it, strewing Garters over the Tomb.</P>
<P>There are several other antient Monuments in this Church, which I have not Room to mention.</P>
<P>The Cloisters are very perfect, and the Chapter-house is large, supported, as to its arched Roof, by one umbilical Pillar. 'Tis now become a Library, is well furnish'd, and has many good antient MSS.</P>
<P>There is a large old Gatehouse standing, and near it the Castle with a very high artificial Mount or Keep, nigh the River.</P>
<P>The Bridge I have mention'd has six Arches, and the Banks of the <HI>Severn</HI> look very beautiful on each Side, being inriched with pleasant Meadows.</P>
<P>This City is governed by a Mayor and Aldermen. It has Two Chamberlains, a Recorder, a Town-clerk, Two Coroners, a Sword-bearer, Four Ser∣geants at Mace, and a Sheriff; being, like <HI>Glou∣cester,</HI> a County of itself, divided into Seven Wards, in which are Twelve Parish Churches.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are generally esteem'd rich, being full of Business, occasion'd chiefly by the Cloathing-trade, of which the City and the Country round carries on a great Share, as well for the <HI>Turkey</HI> as the Home Trade. The Number of Hands, which it imploys in this Town and adjoin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng Villages, in Spinning, Carding, Rowing, Fulling, Weaving, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is almost incredible. One Part of the Town is wholly possessed by <HI>Welsh</HI> People, who speak their own Language, and are imploy'd in this Manufacture. So that this City, which was formerly so great a Griev∣ance to the great ones of that Principality, now administers Subsistence to a vast Number of the meaner ones.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="303"/>It is adorn'd by a capacious and beautiful Structure, called <HI>the Publick Workhouse</HI>; in which Children of both Sexes are trained up to the Knowlege of Trade, and the Practice of Religion and Virtue; by whose Labour also the Aged and Decrepid are supported. This laudable Institution continued several Years to the great Benefit of the City, till at last the Guardians of it having contracted a Debt of upwards of 300<HI>l.</HI> they returned the Poor back to their respective Parishes; and the whole Charity being frustrated, and put an End to, the Corporation let out the Building for a Hop-market, Warehouses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to pay the incurr'd Debt, either Principal or Interest.</P>
<P>Hereupon their worthy Representative <HI>Samuel Sandys,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and other Gentlemen, procured an Act of Parliament for restoring it to its first laudable End; which Act took place from <HI>June</HI> 1730, and will be a lasting Monument to the Honour of the disinterested and publick-spirited Gentleman, to whose unwearied Application, and inflexible Resolution, it was owing: for it must be observed, that alienated Charities are some of the hardest things in the World to be restored.</P>
<P>Opposite to this Workhouse, <HI>Robert Berkley,</HI> of <HI>Spetchley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> erected a fine Hospital for Twelve poor Men, and gave 2000<HI>l.</HI> to build it, and 4000<HI>l.</HI> to endow it.</P>
<P>Here are besides Three Grammar-schools, and Seven Alms-houses, all liberally indow'd. <HI>St. Nicolas</HI> Church, in this City, has been lately re∣built, and is a neat and commodious Edifice.</P>
<P>And the Church of <HI>All-saints</HI> in this Town be∣ing in so ruinous a Condition, that Part of it actually fell down; and the rest being ready to fall, an Act passed, Sess. 1737-8, for taking down and rebuilding the same.</P>
<P>From <HI>Worcester</HI> I made some Excursions, to visit the Towns and Country Northward; and first came
<PB N="295" REF="304"/>
to <HI>Droitwych,</HI> a corporate Bailiwick-town, which has Four Churches, and is pretty wealthy. 'Tis famous for excellent White Salt, which is made here from the Summer to the Winter Solstice; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but they may make Salt all the Year long, but they fear to over-stock the Market. It appears, by <HI>Doomsday-book,</HI> they made Salt here before the Conquest. The Salt Springs are very good, and productive of Plenty of Brine; and the Town lies on the River <HI>Salwarp.</HI></P>
<P>Proceeding directly on, in the Road, we arrived at <HI>Broomsgrove,</HI> a large Bailiwick-town, likewise on the River <HI>Salwarp,</HI> where the Clothing-trade is pretty briskly carried on. It is the Centre of Four Roads; one leads to <HI>Coventry,</HI> and <HI>Leicester</HI>; an∣other to <HI>Warwick,</HI> and so to <HI>London</HI>; a Third to <HI>Worcester</HI>; and the Fourth to <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI></P>
<P>Between <HI>Worcester</HI> and <HI>Spetchley</HI> was <HI>St. Oswald</HI>'s Hospital, demolished in the Reign of Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth.</HI> But Dr. <HI>Fell,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Oxford,</HI> after the Restoration, recover'd much of the Possessions, and erected a fair and large Hospital, which comfortably maintains Twelve poor Men.</P>
<P><HI>Kidderminster</HI> is a Town in this County of <HI>Worcester,</HI> very considerable for its Woollen Trade, particularly the Weaving of what they call Lindsey-woolsey, in which the Inhabitants are almost wholly imploy'd. It is a large, but yet compact and popu∣lous Town, situated on the <HI>Stour,</HI> and govern'd by a Bailiff, Twelve Capital Burgesses, Twenty-five Common-council-men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In its Church is a cross-legg'd Monument of Sir <HI>Thomas Acton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stourbridge</HI> is also situate upon the River <HI>Stour,</HI> over which it has a very good Bridge, whence its Name. This Town deals greatly in Glass Manu∣facture of all Sorts, and also in Iron Works of all Sorts; and is vastly improved of late Years, both in Houses and Inhabitants. At <HI>Swinford,</HI> near <HI>Stour∣bridge,</HI> is a noble Hospital for Sixty Boys, erected by
<PB N="296" REF="305"/>
the First Founder of the noble Family of <HI>Foley,</HI> which deserves the Attention of a Traveller, and the Praise of all Men. At <HI>Stourbridge</HI> also fine Stone Pots are made for Glass-makers to melt their Metal in, also Crucibles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Clay, of which these Things are made, being almost peculiar to the Place.</P>
<P><HI>Birmingham</HI> is a very populous Town, and full of Iron Manufactories, especially of the smaller Sorts; in which the Inhabitants so greatly excel, that their Works are carried to all Parts of the World in great Quantities. The Town is, of late Years, greatly improved and inlarged by many new Buildings both publick and private; particularly a new Church built by virtue of an Act of Parliament passed in the 7th of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> which is dedicated to St. <HI>Philip.</HI> This Town is in <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> on the Borders of this County, situated on the Side of a Hill, and has a most plentiful Market.</P>
<P>A little below <HI>Worcester,</HI> Westward, the <HI>Severn</HI> receives a River of a long deep Course, which comes from <HI>Shropshire,</HI> called the <HI>Teme,</HI> on which stands a small Market-town called <HI>Tenbury,</HI> but of little Note. I passed this River formerly in my Way to <HI>Ludlow,</HI> at <HI>Broadway,</HI> a little Village; but now I went by the Way of <HI>Bewdley,</HI> on the Side of <HI>Shropshire.</HI></P>
<P>In this Course we saw Two fine Seats not very far from the <HI>Severn, viz.</HI> the Lord <HI>Foley</HI>'s, and the Earl of <HI>Bradford</HI>'s, as we did before a most delicious House, belonging to the Lord <HI>Conway.</HI> Indeed this Part of the County, and all the County of <HI>Salop,</HI> is filled with fine Seats of the Nobility and Gentry, which we have not Room to describe.</P>
<P><HI>Bewdley</HI> or <HI>Beau-lieu,</HI> i. e. <HI>fine Place,</HI> said to be so called from its pleasant and delightful Situation upon the Side of a Hill declining to the <HI>Severn,</HI> is a small Bailiff Market-town, well supplied with Corn, Malt, Leather, and Caps, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> Seamen buy,
<PB N="297" REF="306"/>
called <HI>Monmouth Caps,</HI> and noted for the Palace which King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. built here for his Son Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> called <HI>Tickenhall.</HI> It had a very fine Park about it, which, with the House, was destroy'd by the furious Enthusiasts in the Civil War.</P>
<P>A Mile off is <HI>Ribsford,</HI> the Seat of Lord <HI>Herbert</HI> of <HI>Cherbury,</HI> pleasantly surrounded with Woods. Here is a good Picture of <HI>William</HI> the First Earl of <HI>Pembroke.</HI></P>
<P>The Ends of the Hills towards the River are ge∣nerally Rocks: and <HI>Blackston-hill</HI> has an Hermitage cut out of it, with a Chapel, and several Apartments. Near it is a pretty Rock upon the Edge of the Water, covered with Oaks, and many curious Plants.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Cherbury</HI> Park is the Parish of <HI>Roch,</HI> where the famous <HI>Augustine</HI>'s Oak stood, so called from a Conference held under it by <HI>Augustine</HI> and the <HI>British</HI> Bishops, about the Celebration of <HI>Easter,</HI> and preaching God's Word, and administring Baptism after the Rites of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> which the <HI>British</HI> Bishops refused.</P>
<P>I thought once to have returned to <HI>Worcester,</HI> and so proceeded to <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> and down to <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI> and so round the Coast of <HI>Wales.</HI> But being desirous to take in, first, the South Part of <HI>Shrop∣shire,</HI> I followed the <HI>Severn</HI> up North, and came to <HI>Bridgenorth,</HI> a very antient and noted Town, said to be built by Queen <HI>Aethelfleda,</HI> in the Time of the Heptarchy: it consists of Two Towns, the High and the Low, which are separated by the <HI>Severn,</HI> but united by a fair Stone Bridge of Seven Arches, which hath a Gate and Gate-house. The Situation is plea∣sant, the Air healthy, the Prospect delightful and com∣modious for Trade. It hath been fortified with Walls and a Castle, which are now in Ruins; and the Area in the last is converted to a fine Bowling-green. The Streets are many, and well paved. It is go∣verned by a Bailiff, Twenty-four Aldermen, and other
<PB N="298" REF="307"/>
inferior Officers. It is noted for good Gun-makers and its Stocken Manufacture. It has a well-replenished Market, and Five Fairs annually, Two whereof hold Three Days, which are much resorted to, and abound with Horses, Black Cattle, Sheep, Butter, Cheese, Bacon, Linen Cloth, and Hops, in great Plenty. Here are Two Churches, and tho' the Parishes are large, and the Town very populous, are very indifferently indowed, and so is the Free-school. There is a hollow Way cut thro' the Rock, leading from the high Town to the Bridge, of the Depth of 20 Feet, in some Parts of it, and likewise many Vaults and Dwellings are hewn out of the Rock.</P>
<P>From hence we advanced in the direct Road to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and came to <HI>Great Wenlock,</HI> an antient incorporated Town, governed by a Bailiff and Bur∣gesses; but noted for nothing extraordinary.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> for my Observation at my Re∣turn from <HI>Wales</HI> thro' <HI>Cheshire,</HI> we turn'd short here, and fell down Southward to <HI>Ludlow,</HI> famed more for its Beauty than Antiquity; for it seems, the Castle, which was so truly magnificent, was built by <HI>Roger de Montgomery</HI> in the <HI>Conqueror</HI>'s Time.</P>
<P>But before I speak more of this Castle, I shall observe, that on the Extremity of this County, in a kind of Promontory, which runs in between <HI>Montgo∣meryshire</HI> and <HI>Radnorshire,</HI> upon the <HI>Clun,</HI> lies.</P>
<P><HI>Bishops Castle,</HI> a small Market Bailiwick Town; and not very far from it, just at the Entrance into <HI>Montgomeryshire,</HI> is a noted Place called <HI>Bishops∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ott</HI>; where is an Acre of Ground surrounded with an Intrenchment. The <HI>Clun</HI> meets the <HI>Teme</HI> at <HI>Ludlow,</HI> and both, united, run to <HI>Clebury,</HI> a small Town on the Borders of <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> where it falls, as I mentioned before, into the <HI>Severn.</HI></P>
<P>The Castle of <HI>Ludlow</HI> shews plainly in its Decay, what it was in its flourishing Estate: it is the Palace of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> in Right of his Principality.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="308"/>Its Situation is indeed most beautiful; there is a most spacious Plain or Lawn in its Front, which formerly continued near Two Miles; but much of it is now inclosed. The Country round it is exceeding pleasant, fertile, populous, and the Soil rich; nothing can be added by Nature, to make it a Place fit for a Royal Palace. It is built in the North-west Angle of the Town upon a Rock, commanding a delightful Prospect Northward; and on the West is shaded by a lofty Hill, and washed by the River. The Battle∣ments are of great Height and Thickness, with Towers at convenient Distances. That Half which is within the Walls of the Town, is secured with a deep Ditch; the other is founded on a solid Rock. A Chapel here has abundance of Coats of Arms upon the Panels, as has the Hall, together with Lances, Spears, Firelocks, and old Armour.</P>
<P>It will be no Wonder, that this noble Castle is in the very Perfection of Decay, when we acquaint our Readers, that the present Inhabitants live upon the Sale of the antient Materials. All the fine Courts, the Royal Apartments, Halls, and Rooms of State, lie open, abandon'd, and some of them falling down; for since the Courts of the President and Marches are taken away, here is nothing that requires the Attendance of any publick People; so that Time, the great Devourer of the Works of Men, begins to eat into the very Stone Walls, and to spread the Face of Ruin upon the whole Fabrick. Over several of the Stable-doors are the Arms of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Ludlow</HI> is likewise fortify'd with Walls, thro' which are Seven Gates. It is well-built, and a Place of good Trade; but, to be sure, it is not the better for the ruinous State of the Castle, and the abolishing of the Court held there for the Marches. It stands on the Edge of the two Coun∣ties,
<PB N="300" REF="309"/>
<HI>Shropshire</HI> and <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> but is itself in the first.</P>
<P>On the South-side of the Town runs the <HI>Teme,</HI> over which is a good Bridge. The River has several Dams across it, in the Nature of Cataracts, whereby abundance of Mills are turn'd; and great is the Roar of the superfluous Waters.</P>
<P><HI>Ludlow</HI> has a very good Church with an handsome Tower, and a pleasant Ring of Six Bells. The Windows are full of painted Glass pretty intire.</P>
<P>There are some old Monuments of the Lords Presidents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and an Inscription upon the North Wall of the Choir, relating to Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> elder Brother to King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who died here, and in this Spot his Bowels were deposited. It is said, That his Heart was taken up some time ago in a leaden Box.</P>
<P>In the Eastern Angle of the Choir is a Closet, antiently called <HI>The Godhouse,</HI> where the Priests se∣cured their consecrated Utensils. The Window is strongly barred on the Outside. The Church is de∣dicated to St. <HI>Laurence</HI>: and in the Market-place is a Cistern or Conduit, on the Top of which is a long Stone Cross, bearing a Niche, in which is the Image of that Saint.</P>
<P>West of the Church was a College, now con∣verted to a private House. There was a rich Priory out of the Town, on the North Side of which are but few Ruins to be seen, except a small Church, which formerly belonged to it. The <HI>Welsh</HI> call this Town <HI>Lye Twysoy,</HI> i. e. the <HI>Prince's Court.</HI> Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> calls the River <HI>Teme</HI> the <HI>Tem'd,</HI> and another River which joins it just at this Town, the <HI>Corve,</HI> whence the rich flat Country below the Town is call'd <HI>Corvesdale.</HI> It is governed by Two Bailiffs, Twelve Aldermen, a Recorder, Twenty-five Common-council-men, and other inferior Officers; and has the particular Privilege of trying and executing
<PB N="301" REF="310"/>
Criminals. It has an Alms-house for 30 poor People.</P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. establish'd here the Court of the President and Council of the Marches, before-men∣tioned, and all Causes of <HI>Nisi prius,</HI> or of Civil Right, were try'd here, before the Lord President and Coun∣cil; but this Court, being grown a great Grievance to the Publick, was intirely taken away by Act of Parlia∣ment, in the first Year of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Ludlow,</HI> we took our Course still due South to <HI>Lemster,</HI> or <HI>Leominster,</HI> a large Market-town on the River <HI>Lug,</HI> over which it hath several Bridges. 'Tis governed by a Bailiff. The Church, which is very large, has been in a manner rebuilt, and is now very beautiful. This Town is noted for its fine Wool, and the best Wheat, and consequently the finest Bread; and also for the best Barley, whence <HI>Lemster Bread,</HI> and <HI>Weobly Ale,</HI> are become a pro∣verbial Saying.</P>
<P>It is a Town of brisk Trade in Wool, Hat-making, Leather, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and lies in a Valley exceedingly luxu∣riant. Three Rivers of a very swift Current go thro' the Town, besides others very near. The Inhabitants make great use of these by Mills, and other Machinery in the various Branches of their Trade. On the North-side of the Church was a considerable Priory, Two Ayles of which belong now to the Church, and Two others of more lightsome Work have been added. The Mayor has a long black Rod to walk with, tipt with Silver. There are some poor Remains of the Priory, chiefly a little Chapel, which probably be∣long'd to the Prior's Family. Underneath it runs a pretty Rivulet, which us'd to grind his Corn, now converted to a Fulling-mill. Near it are very large Ponds for Fish, which used to furnish the Monks on fasting Days. There was a fine Gate-house, pull'd
<PB N="302" REF="311"/>
down not long ago, near the <HI>Ambry</HI> or <HI>Almery</HI> Close, where they gave their Scraps away to the Poor.</P>
<P><HI>Pembridge, Weobly,</HI> and <HI>Kyneton</HI> lie South-west of <HI>Lemster,</HI> and form in their Situation a kind of Triangle. They are all Market-Towns, and the first is pretty considerable for the Cloathing Trade; the second for Ale; but the third for nothing that I know of.</P>
<P>The County on our right, as we came from <HI>Lud∣low,</HI> is very fruitful and pleasant, and is called the Hundred of <HI>Wigmore,</HI> from which the Earl of <HI>Ox∣ford</HI> takes the Title of Baron. Here we saw the two antient Castles of <HI>Brampton Brian,</HI> and <HI>Wigmore,</HI> both belonging to the late Earl's Grandfather, Sir <HI>Ed∣ward Harley. Brampton</HI> is a stately Pile, but not kept in full Repair. The Parks are fine, and full of large Timber.</P>
<P>We were now on the Borders of <HI>Wales,</HI> properly so called; for from the Windows of <HI>Brampton-Castle,</HI> you have a fair Prospect into the County of <HI>Radnor,</HI> which is, as it were, under its Walls; nay, even this whole County of <HI>Hereford</HI> was a Part of <HI>Wales,</HI> and so deem'd for many Ages. The People of this County too boast, that they were a Part of the an∣tient <HI>Silures,</HI> who for so many Ages withstood the <HI>Roman</HI> Arms, and could never be intirely conquer'd. They are a diligent and laborious People, chiefly ad∣dicted to Husbandry; and they boast, that they have the finest Wool, the best Hops, and the richest Cyder in all <HI>Britain</HI>; and possibly with some Reason; for the Wool about <HI>Leominster,</HI> and in the Hundred of <HI>Wigmore,</HI> and the <HI>Golden Vale,</HI> as it is call'd for its Richness, on the Banks of the River <HI>Dove,</HI> (all in this County) is as fine as any in <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>South-down</HI> Wool not excepted. As for <HI>Hops,</HI> they plant abundance all over this County, and they are very good. And for <HI>Cyder,</HI> it is the common Drink of the County, and is so very good, and so cheap, that
<PB N="303" REF="312"/>
we never found fault, though we could get no other Drink for Twenty Miles together. Great Quanti∣ties of this Cyder are sent to <HI>London,</HI> even by Land-Carriage, though so very remote, which is an Evi∣dence in its Favour beyond Contradiction.</P>
<P>One would hardly expect so pleasant and fruitful a Country as this, so near the barren Mountains of <HI>Wales</HI>; but 'tis certain, that not any of our Southern Counties, the Neighbourhood of <HI>London</HI> excepted, come up to the Fertility of this County.</P>
<P>From <HI>Lemster</HI> it is Ten Miles to <HI>Hereford,</HI> the chief City, not of this County only, but of all the Counties West of the <HI>Severn.</HI> In the time of the late Civil Wars it was very strong, and being well fortify'd, and as well defended, supported a tedious and very severe Siege; for besides the Parliament's Forces, who could never reduce it, the <HI>Scots</HI> Army was call'd to the Work, who lay before it, till they laid above 4000 of their Bones there, and at last it was rather surrendered by the fatal Issue of the War, than by the Attack of the Besiegers.</P>
<P>It had before this Six Parish-churches; but Two of them were demolish'd at that time. It has an Hospital liberally endow'd for 12 poor People.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Hereford</HI> probably sprung from the Ruins of the <HI>Roman Ariconium,</HI> now <HI>Kenchester,</HI> three Miles off, higher up the River <HI>Wye,</HI> but not very near it, which may be a Reason for its Decay.</P>
<P><HI>Kenchester</HI> stands upon a little Brook, call'd the <HI>Ine,</HI> which thence encompassing the Walls of <HI>Here∣ford,</HI> falls into the <HI>Wye.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Archenfield</HI> seems to retain the Name of <HI>Ariconium.</HI> Nothing remains of its Splendor, but a Piece of a Temple, probably, with a Nich which is Five Feet high, and Three broad within, built of Brick, Stone, and indissoluble Mortar. There are many large Foundations near it. A very fine <HI>Mosaick</HI> Floor, a few Years ago, was found intire, which was soon
<PB N="304" REF="313"/>
torn to Pieces by the ignorant Country-people. A Bath was here found by Sir <HI>John Hoskyns</HI> about Seven Feet square, the Pipes of Lead intire: those of Brick were a Foot long, Three Inches square, let ar∣tificially into one another; over these, I suppose, was a Pavement.</P>
<P>This, as Dr. <HI>Stukeley</HI> observes, is an excellent Invention for heating a Room, and might well be introduced among us in Winter-time.</P>
<P>In another Place is a Hollow, where burnt Wheat has been taken up. All around the City you may easily trace the Walls, some Stones being left every∣where, tho' over-grown by Hedges and Timber∣trees. The Situation of the Place is a gentle Emi∣nence of a squarish Form; the Earth black and rich, overgrown with Brambles, Oak-trees, full of Stones, Foundations, and Cavities, where they have been digging, and found many Coins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Colonel <HI>Dant∣sey</HI> has pav'd a Cellar with square Bricks dug up here. The Earl of <HI>Coningsby</HI> has adorn'd the Floor of his Evidence-room with them.</P>
<P>This City is overlook'd and shelter'd towards the North with a prodigious Mountain of steep Ascent; on the Top stands a vast Camp, with Works altoge∣ter inaccessible, which is call'd <HI>Credon-hill.</HI> At the Summit, you are presented with the most glorious and extensive Prospect, as far as <HI>St. Michael's Mount,</HI> in <HI>Monmouthshire</HI>; crown'd with Two Tops, and of considerable Resort among Zealots of the <HI>Romish</HI> Persuasion, who believe this holy Hill was sent hither by St. <HI>Patrick</HI> out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that it works Won∣ders in several Cases.</P>
<P>On the other side, is the vast Black Mountain, which separates <HI>Brecknockshire</HI> from this County. The Town underneath appears like a little Copse. <HI>Dinder-hill,</HI> whereon is a <HI>Roman</HI> Camp, stands on the contrary Bank of the <HI>Wye.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="314"/>And upon the <HI>Lug</HI> are <HI>Sutton-walls,</HI> another vast <HI>Roman</HI> Camp upon a Hill overlooking a beautiful Vale, which was the regal Residence of the power∣ful King <HI>Offa</HI>; but chiefly remarkable for the Mur∣der of young King <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> whom he allur'd thither under Pretext of courting his Daughter, and who was buried in the neighbouring Church of <HI>Marden,</HI> situate in a Marsh by the River-side. Hence his Body was afterwards convey'd to <HI>Hereford,</HI> and enshrin'd; but the particular Place cannot be found.</P>
<P>In the North Wing of the Cathedral of <HI>Hereford,</HI> is the Shrine, where the Body of <HI>Cantilupe,</HI> the great Miracle-monger in the West of <HI>England,</HI> was depo∣sited; which Wing was built by himself, and on the Wall his Picture is painted. All round are the Marks of Hooks, where the Banners, Lamps, Re∣liques, and the like Presents were hung up. And the Riches of this Place were doubtless very consi∣derable; for it is well guarded against the Assaults of Thieves. The Shrine is of Stone, carv'd round with Knights in Armour.</P>
<P>The Church is very old and stately. The Spire is not high, but handsome, and there is a fine Tower at the West End. The Roof, Ayles, and Chapel, have been added to the more antient Part by suc∣cessive Bishops, as also the Towers, Cloisters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Choir, tho' plain, is handsome, and there is a very good Organ.</P>
<P>The Chapter-house, which was very beautiful, was destroy'd in the Civil Wars. About Four Win∣dows are left standing; and the Springing of the Stone Arches between, are of fine Ribwork, which compos'd the Roof, of that Sort of Architecture, wherewith <HI>King's-college-chapel</HI> was built. Two Windows were pull'd down by Bishop <HI>Bisse,</HI> which he us'd in new fitting up the Episcopal Palace. Under the Windows, in every Compartiment, was painted a King, Bishop, Saint, Virgin, or the like; some
<PB N="306" REF="315"/>
of which were distinct enough, tho' so long expos'd to the Weather.</P>
<P>Here are a great Number of Monuments of Bishops, and many valuable Brasses and Tombs.</P>
<P>Between the Cathedral and Palace, is a most vene∣rable Pile, built and roof'd with Stone, consisting of Two Chapels, one above the other; the upper dedi∣cated to St. <HI>Magdalen</HI>; the lower, which is some Steps under-ground, to St. <HI>Catharine.</HI></P>
<P>The Castle was a noble Work, built by one of the <HI>Edwards</HI> before the Conquest, strongly wall'd and ditch'd. There is a very lofty artificial Keep, having a Well fac'd with good Stone: and by the Side of the Ditch a Spring consecrated to St. <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> with an old Stone Arch.</P>
<P>Without the Walls are the Ruins of <HI>Black-Friers</HI> Monastery, and a pretty Stone Cross intire; round which the Cloisters were originally built, as now the Cloisters of the Cathedral inclose another such. These Crosses were in the nature of a Pulpit, whence a Monk preach'd to the People in the open Air, as now practis'd in the Cloisters of some Colleges in the Universities once a Year.</P>
<P>The neighbouring Hill, call'd <HI>Dynmaur,</HI> or <HI>The great Hill,</HI> makes amends for the Tediousness of climbing it, by the Pleasure we receive from its woody Crest, and extensive Prospect.</P>
<P>At the City of <HI>Hereford,</HI> we could not but in∣quire into the Truth of the Story so famous, that the Right Reverend Bishop <HI>Gibson</HI> has mention'd it in his Continuation of <HI>Camden,</HI> of the removing the Two great Stones near <HI>Sutton</HI>; which the People confirm'd to us. The Story is thus:</P>
<P>Between <HI>Sutton</HI> and <HI>Hereford,</HI> in a common Mea∣dow call'd the <HI>Wergins,</HI> were plac'd Two large Stones for a Water-mark; one erected upright, and the other laid athwart. In the late Civil Wars, about the Year 1652, they remov'd to about twelvescore
<PB N="307" REF="316"/>
Paces Distance, and nobody knew how; which gave occasion to a vulgar Notion, That they were carried thither by the Devil. When they were set in their Places again, one of them requir'd nine Yoke of Oxen to draw it.</P>
<P><HI>Lidbury</HI> lies Eastward of <HI>Hereford,</HI> near the South End of the <HI>Malvern</HI> Hills. It is a fine, well-built Market-town, situate in rich clayey Grounds, and much inhabited by Clothiers. Here is an Hospital for the Poor, well indowed.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Lidbury,</HI> is <HI>Colwal</HI>; near which, upon the Waste, as a Countryman was digging a Ditch about his Cottage, he found a Crown or a Coronet of Gold, with Gems set deep in it. It was of a Size large enough to be drawn over the Arm with the Sleeve. The Stones of it are said to have been so valuable, as to be sold by a Jeweller for One thou∣sand Five hundred Pounds.</P>
<P><HI>Hereford,</HI> tho' a large and populous City, may yet be said to be old, mean-built, and very dirty, lying low, and on the Bank of the <HI>Wye,</HI> which some∣times incommodes them very much, by the violent Freshes that come down from the Mountains of <HI>Wales</HI>; for all the Rivers of this County, except the <HI>Diffrin-Doe,</HI> come out of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>One thing remarkable, which we must not omit, is, that the College still retains its Foundation Laws, and the Residentiaries are oblig'd to Celibacy; but otherwise, they live a very happy, easy, and plentiful Life; being furnish'd upon the Foot of the Founda∣tion, besides their Ecclesiastical Stipends.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of the Year 1738, they began to pull down the old <HI>Gothick</HI> Chapel belonging to the Bishop's Palace at <HI>Hereford,</HI> in order to erect a Pile in a politer Taste, for the publick Service. The demolish'd Chapel was said to be as old as the Con∣quest.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="317"/>Between <HI>Leominster</HI> and this City, is another <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> the Seat of the late Earl of <HI>Coningsby.</HI> That Lord was, from an <HI>Irish</HI> Peer, made an <HI>English</HI> one, by his late Majesty King <HI>George</HI> I. And having no Son, his Daughter was created by the same Prince in the Life-time of her Father, Baroness and Vis∣countess <HI>Coningsby</HI> of <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> in order that her Descendants might be intitled to a Peerage. She marry'd Sir <HI>Michael Newton,</HI> Bart. and Knight of the <HI>Bath.</HI> This is a fine Seat built by <HI>Henry Bolin∣broke</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> afterwards King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. in the Form of a Castle, situate in a Valley upon a rapid River, under Coverture of <HI>Dynmaur.</HI> The Gardens are very pleasant, terminated by vast Woods covering all the sloping Side of the Hill. There is a plentiful Supply of Water, on all Sides of the House, for Fountains, Basins, and Canals. Within, are excellent Pictures of the Earl's Ancestors and others, by <HI>Holben, Dobson, Vandyke,</HI> Sir <HI>P. Lully,</HI> &amp;c. an Original of the Founder King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Duchess of <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Windows of the Chapel are well painted: there are some Statues of the <HI>Coningsbies.</HI></P>
<P>Here are two new Stone Stair-cases, after a Geo∣metrical Method. The Record-room is at-top of a Tower arch'd with Stone, pav'd with <HI>Roman</HI> Brick, and has an Iron Door. From the Top of the House goes a Stair-case, which, they say, has a subterraneous Conveyance into <HI>Dynmaur</HI> Wood.</P>
<P>The Park is very fine, Eight Miles in Circum∣ference, and contains about 1200 Head of Deer. There are extensive Prospects on one Side reaching into <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> on the other over the <HI>Welsh</HI> Moun∣tains; Lawns, Groves, Canals, Hills and Plains. There is a Pool Three Quarters of a Mile long, very broad, and included between Two great Woods. The Dam, which forms it, and is made over a Valley, cost, 800<HI>l.</HI> and was finish'd in a Fortnight by 200
<PB N="309" REF="318"/>
Hands. A new River is cut quite thro' the Park, the Chanel of which, for a long way together, is hewn out of the Rock. This serves to inrich vast Tracts of Lands, which before were barren. Here also are new Gardens and Canals laid out, and new Plantations of Timber in proper Places.</P>
<P>Warrens, Decoys, Sheepwalks, Pastures for Cattle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> supply the House with all Sorts of Convenien∣cies and Necessaries, without having recourse to a Market.</P>
<P>Westward of <HI>Hereford</HI> the <HI>Golden Vale</HI> before-men∣tioned, extends itself along the River <HI>Dore,</HI> which runs thro' the midst of it, and is call'd by the <HI>Britons, Duf∣frin Dore:</HI> it is call'd the <HI>Golden Vale,</HI> from its plea∣sant Fertility in the Spring, when it is cover'd over with a yellow Livery of Flowers. It is encompassed with Hills, which are crown'd with Woods.</P>
<P>From <HI>Hereford,</HI> keeping the Bank of <HI>Wye</HI> as near as we could, we came to <HI>Ross,</HI> a good old Town, fa∣mous for Cyder, a great Manufacture of Iron-ware, and its Trade on the River <HI>Wye.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we came at about Eight Miles more into <HI>Monmouthshire,</HI> formerly a <HI>Welsh,</HI> but now an <HI>English</HI> County, and to the Town of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> It is a Place of great Antiquity, and is fair, large, and well-built, situate at the Conflux of the <HI>Wye</HI> and <HI>Munnow,</HI> whence the Town has its Name; it stands in the Angle where the Rivers join, and has a Bridge over each River, and a third over the River <HI>Trothy,</HI> which comes in just below the other.</P>
<P>This Town shews Marks of great Antiquity, and, by the Remains of Walls, Lines, Curtains, and Bas∣tions, that it has been very strong, and, by its Situa∣tion, that it may be made so again. It is a Borough-town, govern'd by Two Bailiffs, Common-council∣men, and Town-clerk. It has a very considerable Corn-market. It was famed for the Strength of the
<PB N="310" REF="319"/>
Castle in the Time of <HI>William</HI> I.; and is the Birth-place of our renown'd King <HI>Henry</HI> V. Conqueror of <HI>France</HI>; and likewise of one of our antient Histo∣rians, <HI>Jeoffry</HI> of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> a fabulous Writer. At present 'tis not very flourishing; yet it drives a con∣siderable Trade with the City of <HI>Bristol,</HI> by the Na∣vigation of the <HI>Wye.</HI></P>
<P>This River having receiv'd Two large Streams, the <HI>Munnow,</HI> and the <HI>Trother,</HI> becomes a very noble River; and with a deep Chanel, and a full Current, hurries away towards the Sea, carrying also Vessels of a considerable Burden hereabouts.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Monmouth,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> has a fine Seat, call'd <HI>Troy-house.</HI></P>
<P>Lower down, upon the <HI>Wye</HI> in this Shire, stands <HI>Chepstow,</HI> the Sea-port for all the Towns seated on this River and the <HI>Lug,</HI> and where their Commerce seems to centre. Hither Ships of good Burden may come up, and the Tide runs with the same impe∣tuous Current as at <HI>Bristol</HI>; the Flood rising ordi∣narily from Six Fathom, to Six and a half at <HI>Chepstow</HI> Bridge, which is a noble one indeed, built of Tim∣ber, and no less than 70 Feet high from the Surface of the Water, when the Tide is out. And that this was not a needless Height, was evident in <HI>Ja∣nuary</HI> 1738, when the Water rose at the Bridge up∣wards of 70 Feet, and very much damag'd it: one Man lost above 130 Head of Cattle, which, with other Damages it did there, and in the adjacent Places, were computed at 7 or 8000<HI>l. Chepstow</HI> has a well frequented Market, especially for Corn. The Bridge, as half of it is in <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> is maintained at the Expence of both Counties.</P>
<P>Two Miles from this Town is the famous Passage over the <HI>Severn,</HI> on this Side call'd <HI>Bleachly,</HI> and on the other <HI>Aust,</HI> as I have mention'd before. Here <HI>Offa's Dyke</HI> begins, and passing through <HI>Radnor∣shire,</HI>
<PB N="311" REF="320"/>
extends itself up to <HI>Flintshire,</HI> and so to the River <HI>Dee,</HI> which parts <HI>Wales</HI> from <HI>Cheshire.</HI></P>
<P>We turn'd Northwards, and arrived at <HI>Aberga∣venny,</HI> which is a large well-built and well-inhabited Market-town, situate at the Mouth of the <HI>Gavenny</HI> running into the <HI>Usk.</HI> It carries on a considerable Trade in Flanels, which the Country People manu∣facture at home, and bring hither to sell. It is a great Thorough-fare from the Western Parts of <HI>Wales</HI> to <HI>Bristol</HI> and <HI>Bath</HI> by <HI>Chepstow,</HI> and to <HI>Gloucester</HI> by <HI>Monmouth</HI>; and so crossing the River thro' <HI>Col∣ford</HI> and the Forest of <HI>Dean.</HI></P>
<P>The Fuel in this County is Pit-coal, and is very cheap, insomuch that they sell a Horse-load for Two-pence, at the Pit-mouth; and 'tis common, in the meanest Cot to see a good Fire.</P>
<P>Great Quantities of Corn are exported out of this County; and 'tis frequent, that the <HI>Bristol</HI> Mer∣chants send their Ships hither to load for <HI>Portugal,</HI> and other foreign Countries. And indeed it is noted for producing as good Wheat and other Grain, as any County in the Kingdom; and yet it is very surprise∣ing, that Lands here never sell for more than 20 or 21 Years Purchace. The current Language of the County is <HI>Welsh</HI> among the Vulgar, but the Gen∣tlemen speak <HI>English</HI> generally.</P>
<P>As I am now just upon entering <HI>Wales,</HI> I will conclude this Letter with assuring you, that I am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI. CONTAINING A Description of the greatest Part of the Principality of <HI>Wales.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Thought I should not pay the Princi∣pality the Respect it so well deserves, if I did not begin a Letter with the Description of it; it being the Country of that brave People, who had an ori∣ginal Right to the whole Island, and made so noble a Stand in Defence of their Liberties and Independ∣ency; and at last, rather than submit to a foreign Yoke, chose to be free in this remote and inaccessible Part of it.</P>
<P>The two first Counties which border West upon <HI>Monmouthshire,</HI> are <HI>Brecknock</HI> and <HI>Glamorgan,</HI> and are very mountainous on the East Side, which gives a Traveller a terrible Apprehension of the Country he is this way entering into, and an Expectation of meeting with nothing that is agreeable; but he is not long before he is undeceived, and finds the Re∣ward of his Trouble. In that Part of <HI>Monmouthshire</HI> which joins the Two Counties, begins the rising of
<PB N="313" REF="322"/>
the Hills. <HI>Kyrton-Beacon, Tumberlow, Blorench, Penvail,</HI> and <HI>Skirridan,</HI> are some of the Names of these horrid Mountains, and are all in this Shire; and I could not but fansy myself in View of <HI>Mount Brennus, Little-Barnard,</HI> and <HI>Great-Barnard,</HI> among the <HI>Alps.</HI></P>
<P>We now entered <HI>South Wales</HI>; which contains the Shires of <HI>Glamorgan, Brecknock, Radnor, Caermar∣then, Pembroke,</HI> and <HI>Cardigan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brecknockshire</HI> is a mere inland County, as <HI>Radnor</HI> is; the <HI>English</HI> jestingly (and I think not very impro∣perly) call it <HI>Break-neck-shire:</HI> 'tis mountainous to an Extremity, except on the Side of <HI>Radnor,</HI> where it is something more low and level. It is well wa∣tered by the <HI>Wye,</HI> and the <HI>Uske,</HI> two Rivers men∣tion'd before. Upon the latter stands the Town of <HI>Brecknock,</HI> the Capital of the County, well-built, and the Assizes are kept at it. It is very antient, and indeed, to mention it here once for all, there are more Tokens of Antiquity to be seen every-where in <HI>Wales,</HI> than in any particular Part of <HI>England,</HI> ex∣cept the Counties of <HI>Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Northumberland.</HI> Here we saw <HI>Brecknock-mere,</HI> a large or long Lake of Water, Two or Three Miles over; of which they have a great many Fables, not worth relating: the best of them is, that a certain River, call'd the <HI>Lhe∣weni,</HI> runs thro' it, and keeps its Colour in Mid∣chanel, distinguish'd from the Water of the Lake, and, as they say, never mingles with it. They take abundance of good Fish in this Lake, so that, like the River <HI>Theisse,</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> they say it is Two-thirds Water, and One-third Fish. The Country People affirm, that once a City stood here, but, that by the Judgment of Heaven, for the Sins of its Inhabitants, it sunk into the Earth, and the Wa∣ter rose up in the Place of it. I observe the same Story is mention'd by Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> with some Dif∣ference in the Particulars: I believe my Share of it,
<PB N="314" REF="323"/>
but 'tis remarkable, that Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> having lost the old City <HI>Loventium,</HI> mention'd by <HI>Ptolemy</HI> to be hereabouts, is willing to account for it by this odd Story.</P>
<P>It was among the Mountains of this County that the famous <HI>Glendower</HI> shelter'd himself, and taking Arms on the deposing <HI>Richard</HI> II. proclaimed him∣self Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>; they shew us several little Re∣fuges of his in the Mountains, whither he retreated; and from whence, again, he made such bold Excur∣sions into <HI>England,</HI> as to have put <HI>Henry</HI> IV. to very great Difficulties.</P>
<P>Tho' this County be so mountainous, Provisions are exceeding plentiful, and also very good all over the Country; nor are these Mountains useless, even to the City of <HI>London,</HI> as I have noted of other Counties; for from hence they send yearly great Herds of Black Cattle to <HI>England,</HI> and which are known to fill our Fairs and Markets, even that of <HI>Smithfield</HI> itself.</P>
<P>The yellow Mountains of <HI>Radnorshire</HI> are the same, and their Product of Cattle is the same; nor did I meet with any thing worth noticing, except Mo∣numents of Antiquity. The Stories of <HI>Vortigern,</HI> and <HI>Roger</HI> of <HI>Mortimer,</HI> are in every old Woman's Mouth here. There is here a great Cataract or Water-fall of the River <HI>Wye,</HI> at a Place call'd <HI>Rha∣jadr Gwy</HI> in <HI>Welsh,</HI> which signifies the Cataract or Water-fall of the <HI>Wye</HI>; but we did not go to see it, by reason there was a great Flood out at that time, which made the Way dangerous. There seemed to us a kind of Desart too, on that Side, which is scarce passable by Strangers; so we made it our North Boundary for this Part of our Journey.</P>
<P>We shall only add; That <HI>Radnor</HI> is the Shire Town, and hath a Castle; that <HI>Presteigne</HI> in <HI>Radnor∣shire</HI> is a well-built Town, and the Assizes are held there.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="324"/>Entering <HI>Glamorganshire,</HI> from <HI>Radnor</HI> and <HI>Breck∣nock,</HI> we beheld <HI>Monuchdenny-hill</HI> on our Left, and the <HI>Black Mountains</HI> on the Right, and all a Ridge of horrid Rocks and Precipices between, over which, if we had not had good Guides, we should never have found our Way; and indeed, we began to repent our Curiosity, in going out of the common Road, as not having met with any thing worth the Trouble; and the Country looking so full of Horror, we thought to have given over the Enterprize, and have left <HI>Wales</HI> out of our Circuit: But after a Day and a Night engaging thus with Rocks and Mountains, our Guide brought us down into a most agreeable Vale, opening to the South, and a pleasant River running through it, call'd the <HI>Taaffe</HI>; and following its Course, we came in the Evening to the antient City of <HI>Landaff,</HI> and Town of <HI>Caerdiff,</HI> standing almost together.</P>
<P><HI>Landaff</HI> in <HI>Glamorganshire,</HI> is the Seat of the Epi∣scopal See, and a City; but so small, that it has not a Market; but <HI>Caerdiff,</HI> which is lower on the River, is the Port and Town of Trade; and has a very good Harbour opening into the <HI>Severn</HI> Sea, about four Miles below the Town.</P>
<P>The Cathedral is a neat Building, and very an∣tient; they boast that this Church was a House of Religious Worship many Years before any other was founded in the Island, and that the Christian Religion flourish'd in its primitive Purity, from the Year 186, till the <HI>Pelagian</HI> Heresy overspread this Country; which being afterwards rooted out, they plac'd St. <HI>Dobricius,</HI> as the first Bishop, in this Town of <HI>Lan∣daff,</HI> then call'd <HI>Launt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n:</HI> The Bishop of <HI>Landaff</HI> had formerly the Title of Archbishop; the three first Bishops were afterwards sainted for their eminent Holiness of Life, and the Miracles they are said to have wrought. 'Tis observable the Cathedral was antiently but 20 Foot long, and 10 broad, and had neither Steeple nor Bells, nor had they any other
<PB N="316" REF="325"/>
Cathedral from the Year 386, to the Year 1107, when Bishop <HI>Urban</HI> built the present Church, with some Houses for the Clergy adjoining, in the Nature of a Cloister.</P>
<P>Tho' the Church is antient, yet the Building is good, and the Choir neat, and pretty well kept.</P>
<P>The South Part of <HI>Glamorganshire</HI> is pleasant, agreeable, and very populous, insomuch that it is called <HI>The Garden of Wales.</HI> Its Soil is fertile and rich, and the low Grounds are so well cover'd with Grass, and stock'd with Cattle, that they supply the City of <HI>Bristol</HI> with Butter in very great Quantities salted and barrel'd up, just as <HI>Suffolk</HI> does the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Caerphyli-Castle</HI> in <HI>Glamorganshire,</HI> is one of the noblest Pieces of Ruins in the whole Island. It was larger than any Castle in <HI>England,</HI> that of <HI>Windsor</HI> excepted; and from what remains of it, was as beautiful in its Architecture, as it is remarkable in its Ruins.</P>
<P><HI>Neath</HI> is a Port where the Coal-Trade is pretty considerable, tho' it stands up within Land.</P>
<P><HI>Swanzy</HI> is also a Sea-port, and a very considerable Town for Trade, with a very good Harbour: Here is also a very great Trade for Coals, and Culm, which they export to all the Ports of <HI>Somerset, Devon,</HI> and <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and even to <HI>Ireland</HI>; so that some∣times may be seen a hundred Sail of Ships at a time loading Coals here; which greatly enriches the Coun∣try, and particularly this Town; it stands on the River <HI>Twye,</HI> or <HI>Taw:</HI> 'Tis very remarkable, that most of the Rivers in this County chime upon the Letters <HI>T</HI> and <HI>Y,</HI> as <HI>Taaf, Tawy, Tuy, Towy, Tyevy.</HI></P>
<P>There are lately Mineral Waters found out at <HI>Swanzy,</HI> which are reported to be of great Efficacy in Fluxes and Haemorrhages of all Sorts. Consumptions, if not too far gone, Diabetes, Palsies, Rheumatisms,
<PB N="317" REF="326"/>
Dropsies, and other Distempers, are said to fall before these Styptick and Restorative Waters. They may certainly have very good Effects in many difficult Cases; but it is doing an Injury to the Reputation of any Medicine in the World, to make it a <HI>Catholicon,</HI> and good for every thing.</P>
<P><HI>Kynfig-Castle,</HI> is now the Seat and Estate of the Lord <HI>Mansel,</HI> who has here also a very noble Income from the Collieries; which formerly denominated Sir <HI>Edward Mansel,</HI> one of the richest Commoners in <HI>Wales.</HI> The Family was innobled by her late Majesty Queen <HI>Anne.</HI></P>
<P>In this Neighbourhood, near <HI>Margan Mynydd,</HI> we saw the famous Monument mention'd by Mr. <HI>Cam∣den,</HI> on a Hill, with the Inscription, which the Vul∣gar are so terrify'd at, that nobody cares to read it; for they have a Tradition from Father to Son, that whoever ventures to read it, will die within a Month. We did not scruple the Adventure, but when we came to try, the Letters were so defac'd by Time, that we were effectually secur'd from the Danger; the Inscription not being any thing near so legible, as it seems it was in Mr. <HI>Camden</HI>'s time.</P>
<P>The Stone Pillar is about 4 or 5 Feet high, and one Foot thick, standing on the Top of this Hill; there are several other such Monuments in <HI>Radnor∣shire,</HI> and other Counties in <HI>Wales,</HI> as likewise in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus touch'd on what is most curious on this Coast, we pass'd thro' the Land of <HI>Gowre</HI>; and going still <HI>West,</HI> we came to <HI>Caermarthen,</HI> or <HI>Kaer-Vyrdhin,</HI> as the <HI>Welsh</HI> call it, the Capital of the County of <HI>Kaermardhinshire.</HI></P>
<P>This is an antient and a very handsome Town, pleasantly situated on the River <HI>Towy,</HI> which is navi∣gable up to the Town, for Vessels of a moderate Burden, and over which is a large Bridge. The Town is well-built, and populous; it is lately much
<PB N="318" REF="327"/>
increas'd, and is still increasing; and the County round it is the most fruitful of any Part of <HI>Wales,</HI> and con∣tinues to be so thro' all the Middle of the County, and a great Way into the next; nor is this County so mountainous and wild, as the rest of this Part of <HI>Wales:</HI> But it abounds in Corn, and in fine flourish∣ing Meadows, as good as most are in <HI>Britain,</HI> and in which are fed a very great Number of good Cattle.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chancery,</HI> and <HI>Exchequer,</HI> for the South Part of the Principality, were usually kept at this Town, till the Jurisdiction of the Court and Marches of <HI>Wales</HI> was taken away. This Town was also fa∣mous for the Birth of the old <HI>British</HI> Prophet, <HI>Mer∣lin,</HI> of whom so many things are fabled, and who flourish'd in the Year 480: And here also the old <HI>Britons</HI> often kept their Parliaments, or Assemblies of their wise Men, and made their Laws. The Town was fortify'd in former times, but the Walls are not to be seen now, and scarcely the Ruins of them. The People in this Town and Country are reckon'd the wealthiest and politest in <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>Here we saw near <HI>Kily-Maen Llwyd,</HI> on a great Mountain, a Circle of mighty Stones, very much like <HI>Stone-henge</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> or rather like the <HI>Roll-rich</HI> Stones in <HI>Oxfordshire</HI>; and tho' the People call it <HI>Bruarth Arthur,</HI> or King <HI>Arthur's Throne,</HI> we see no reason to believe, that it had any relation to him.</P>
<P>The next County West, is <HI>Pembrokeshire,</HI> the most extreme Part of <HI>Wales</HI> on this Side. It is a rich, fertile, and plentiful Country, lying on the Sea-coast, where it has the Benefit of <HI>Milford-Haven,</HI> one of the greatest and best Ports in <HI>Britain.</HI> Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> says, it contains 16 Creeks, 5 great Bays, and 13 good Roads for Shipping, all distinguish'd as such by their Names; and some say, a thousand Sail of Ships may ride in it.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="328"/>Part of <HI>Pembrokeshire</HI> is inhabited by the Descen∣dants of the <HI>Flemings,</HI> placed there by King <HI>Henry</HI> I. and that County is called, <HI>Little England beyond Wales.</HI></P>
<P>Before we quitted the Coast, we saw <HI>Tenbigk,</HI> the most agreeable Town on all the Sea-coast of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> except <HI>Pembroke,</HI> being a very good Road for Shipping, and well frequented. Here is a great Fishery for Herring in its Season, a great Colliery, or rather Export of Coals, and they also drive a very considerable Trade to <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>From hence, the Land, bearing far into the Sea, makes a Promontory, call'd St. <HI>Goven's-Head,</HI> or <HI>Point.</HI> But as we found nothing of Moment there, we cross'd over the Isthmus to <HI>Pembroke,</HI> which stands on the East Shore of the great Haven of <HI>Milford.</HI></P>
<P>This is the largest and richest, and at this Time the most flourishing Town of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> except <HI>Carmarthen.</HI> Here are a great many Gentlemen and Merchants, and some of the latter are Men of good Business; and they told us, there were near 200 Sail of Ships belong'd to the Town, small and great; in a Word, all this Part of <HI>Wales</HI> is a rich and flourishing Country, very pleasant, fertile, and well cultivated.</P>
<P>This is the Place also made particularly famous for the Landing of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. then Earl of <HI>Richmond.</HI></P>
<P>From hence, being resolv'd to see the utmost Ex∣tent of the County, West, we ferry'd over the Haven, and went to <HI>Haverford,</HI> by some call'd <HI>Haverford-West,</HI> a County in itself; and from thence to St. <HI>David</HI>'s. <HI>Haverford</HI> is a good Town, strong, well-built, clean, and populous.</P>
<P>From hence to St. <HI>David</HI>'s, the Country begins to look dry, barren, and mountainous.</P>
<P>St. <HI>David</HI>'s is now a Bishop's See only, but was formerly an Archbishop's, which was transferr'd to <HI>Dole</HI> in <HI>Britany,</HI> where it still remains.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="329"/>The venerable Aspect of this Cathedral Church shews, that it has been a beautiful Building. The West-end or Body of the Church is tolerable; the Choir is kept neat; the South Isle without the Choir, and the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>'s Chapel, which makes the East∣end of the Church, are in a manner demolish'd, and the Roofs of both fallen in.</P>
<P>There have been a great many eminent Persons bury'd here, besides such whose Monuments are de∣fac'd by Time. Here is St. <HI>David</HI>'s Monument, to whom the Church is dedicated, the Monument of the Earl of <HI>Richmond,</HI> as also of the famous <HI>Owen Tudor</HI>; Here are also four antient Monuments of Knights-Templars, known by their Figures lying cross-legg'd; but their Names are not known, and there are six several Monuments of Bishops, who presided over this Church, besides St. <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>This Saint, they tell us, was Uncle to King <HI>Ar∣thur,</HI> that he lived to 146 Years of Age, that he was Bishop of this Church sixty-five Years, being born in the Year 496, and died <HI>Anno</HI> 642; that he built twelve Monasteries, and perform'd abundance of Mi∣racles.</P>
<P>There was a very handsome House for the Bishop, with a College, all built in a Close by themselves; but they are now in Ruins.</P>
<P>Here, the Weather being very clear, we had a full View of <HI>Ireland,</HI> though at a very great Distance. The Land here is call'd St. <HI>David's-Head.</HI> They reckon up 114 Bishops of this See, since it began, to the Year 1740.</P>
<P>A late Bishop of this See was Dr. <HI>Thomas Wat∣son,</HI> of whom the World has heard so much, being depriv'd, after a long Debate, on a Charge of <HI>Simony.</HI> I shall not inquire into the Merits of the Case; but he bestow'd great Sums on charitable Designs.</P>
<P>From hence we turn'd North, keeping the Sea in our West Prospect, and a rugged mountainous Coun∣try
<PB N="321" REF="330"/>
on the East, where the Hills even darken'd the Air with their Height. As we went on, we past by <HI>Newport,</HI> on the River <HI>Nevern,</HI> a Town having a good Harbour, and consequently a good Trade with <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>Here we left <HI>Pembrokeshire,</HI> and after about 22 Miles came to <HI>Cardigan,</HI> a well-inhabited Town, on the River <HI>Tyvy,</HI> over which it has a fair Stone Bridge: 'Tis a very noble River indeed, and famous for its Plenty of the best and largest Salmon in <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The Country People told us, that they had for∣merly Beavers here, which bred in the Lakes among the Mountains, and coming down the Stream of <HI>Tyvy,</HI> destroy'd the young Frye of Salmon, and therefore the Country People destroy'd 'em. We thought they only meant the Otter, till I found afterwards, that Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> mentions also, that there had been Bea∣vers seen here formerly.</P>
<P>This Town of <HI>Cardigan</HI> was once possess'd by the great <HI>Robert Fitz-Stephen,</HI> who was the first <HI>Briton</HI> that ever attempted the Conquest of <HI>Ireland</HI>; and had such Success with a Handful of Men, as after∣wards gave the <HI>English</HI> a Footing there, which they never quitted afterwards, till they quite reduc'd the Country, and made it, as it were, a Province to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Town is large and populous, has a fair Church, and is walled about, and fortified with a Castle, but that Part is now not much minded. It has a good Trade with <HI>Ireland,</HI> and is enrich'd very much, as is all this Part of the Country, by the famous Lead Mines, formerly discover'd by Sir <HI>Carbery Price,</HI> which are the greatest, and perhaps the richest in <HI>England</HI>; and particularly as they require so little Labour and Charge to come at the Ore, which in many Places lies within a Fathom or two of the Surface, and in some, even bare to the very Top. There are also Silver Mines in this County.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="331"/>Going North from the <HI>Tyvy</HI> about 25 Miles, we came to <HI>Aberystwith,</HI> that is to say, the Town at the Mouth of the River <HI>Ystwith.</HI> It is a populous, but a dark, smoaky Place; and we fansy'd the Peo∣ple look'd as if they had liv'd continually in Coal or Lead Mines. However, they are rich.</P>
<P>The County of <HI>Cardigan</HI> is in no wise comparable to either of those <HI>Welsh</HI> Counties which we have already pass'd through, there being a great deal of bar∣ren Lands in it. However, it is so full of Cattle, that 'tis said to be the Nursery, or Breeding-Place for the whole Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> South by <HI>Trent</HI>; but this is not a Proof of its Fertility; for tho' the feeding of Cattle indeed requires a rich Soil, the breeding them does not, the Mountains and Moors being as proper for that Purpose as richer Land.</P>
<P>Now we enter'd <HI>North-Wales</HI>; only I should add, that as we pass'd, we had a Sight of the famous <HI>Plymlymon-Hill,</HI> out of the East-side of which, rise the <HI>Severn,</HI> and the <HI>Wye</HI>; and out of the West-side of it, rise the <HI>Rydall</HI> and the <HI>Ystwyth.</HI> This Moun∣tain is exceeding high, and though it is hard to say which is the highest Hill in <HI>Wales,</HI> yet I think this bids fair for it; nor is the County, for 20 Miles round it, any thing but a continued Ridge of Mountains: So that for a few Days we seem'd to be conversing in the upper Regions; for we were often above the Clouds a great way, and the Names of some of these Hills seem'd as barbarous to us, who spoke no <HI>Welsh,</HI> as the Hills themselves.</P>
<P>Passing these Mountains North, we enter'd North <HI>Wales,</HI> which contains the Counties of <HI>Montgomery, Merioneth, Caernarvon, Denbeigh,</HI> and <HI>Flint</HI> Shires, and the Isle of <HI>Anglesea.</HI></P>
<P>In passing <HI>Montgomeryshire,</HI> we were so tired with Hills and Mountains, that we wish'd heartily we had kept close to the Sea Shore; but we had not much mended the matter, if we had, as I understood
<PB N="323" REF="332"/>
afterwards. The River <HI>Severn</HI> is the principal Beauty of this County, which rising out of the <HI>Plymlymon</HI> Mountain, as I have said, receives in a short Course so many other Rivers into its Bosom, that it becomes navigable before it gets out of the County, at <HI>Welsh-Pool,</HI> on the Edge of <HI>Shropshire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Montgomery</HI> is a fashionable Place, and has many fair Dwellings in it, and some very good Families.</P>
<P>The Vales and Meadows upon the Banks of the <HI>Severn</HI> are exceedingly ornamental and profitable, and 'tis said, that the Water of the <HI>Severn,</HI> like that of <HI>Nile,</HI> when it overflows, impregnates the Valleys by the Slime it leaves behind it; all the Country is very fruitful, where-ever this River runs. The Town of <HI>Montgomery</HI> lies not far from this River, on the outer Edge of the County, next to <HI>Herefordshire.</HI> This was, it seems, a great Frontier Town in the Wars between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Welsh,</HI> and was beautify'd and fortify'd by King <HI>Henry</HI> III. but it is not now so very considerable, though a good Town still, pleasantly situated, and has a Castle.</P>
<P>This County has been long noted for an excellent Breed of <HI>Welsh</HI> Horses, which, though not very large, are exceeding valuable, and much esteem'd all over <HI>England.</HI> All the North and West Part of the County is mountainous and stony. We saw a great many old Monuments in this Country, and <HI>Roman</HI> Camps, where-ever we came; and especially, if we met any Persons curious in such things, we found they had many <HI>Roman</HI> Coins.</P>
<P><HI>Merionethshire,</HI> or <HI>Merionydshire,</HI> lies West from <HI>Montgomeryshire,</HI> on the <HI>Irish</HI> Sea, or rather the Ocean; for St. <HI>George's Chanel</HI> does not begin till further North; and it is extended on the Coast, for near 35 Miles in Length, all still mountainous and craggy. The principal River is the <HI>Tovy,</HI> which rises among the unpassable Mountains, which range
<PB N="324" REF="333"/>
along the Centre of this Part of <HI>Wales,</HI> and which we look at with Astonishment, for their prodigious Height. Some of the Hills have particular Names, but otherwise we called them all, <HI>The Black Moun∣tains,</HI> and they well deserve the Name. Some think 'tis from the unpassable Mountains of this County, that we have an old Saying, That the Devil lives in the <HI>Middle of Wales,</HI> tho' I know there is another Meaning given to it; in a word, Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> calls these Parts the <HI>Alps of Wales.</HI></P>
<P>There are but few large Towns in all this Part, nor is it very populous; much of it being scarce habitable, but 'tis said, there are more Sheep in it, than in all the rest of <HI>Wales.</HI> On the Sea Shore however, we saw <HI>Harleigh,</HI> or <HI>Harlech-Castle,</HI> which is still a Garison, and kept for the Guard of the Coast; but 'tis of no other Strength, than what its Situation gives it.</P>
<P>In the middle of these vast Mountains (and form∣ing a very large Lake, <HI>viz.</HI> near its first Sources) rises the River <HI>Dee,</HI> of which I shall speak again in its proper Place.</P>
<P>Here, among almost innumerable Summits, and rising Peaks of nameless Hills, we saw the famous <HI>Kader-Idricks,</HI> which, some are of Opinion, is the highest Mountain in <HI>Britain,</HI> another call'd <HI>Rarau∣vaur,</HI> another call'd <HI>Mowywynda</HI>; and still every Hill we saw, we thought higher than all that ever we saw before.</P>
<P>We inquired here after that strange Phaenomenon, which was not only seen, but fatally experienc'd, by the Country round this Place, namely of a livid Fire, coming off from the Sea, and setting on Fire Houses, Barns, Stacks of Hay and Corn, and poisoning the Herbage in the Field; of which there is a full Account given in the Philosophical Trans∣actions: And as we had it confirm'd by the general Voice of the People, I shall take notice, That the
<PB N="325" REF="334"/>
Transactions particularly observe, that the Eclipses of the Sun in <HI>Aries</HI> have been very fatal to this Place; and that the Years 1542, and 1567, when the Sun was eclipsed in that Sign, it suffer'd very much by Fire; and after the latter Eclipse of the two, the Fire spread so far, that about 200 Houses in the Town and Suburbs of <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> were con∣sum'd.</P>
<P>This mountainous Country runs away North thro' <HI>Merionethshire,</HI> and almost thro' <HI>Caernarvonshire,</HI> where <HI>Snowden-hill,</HI> of a monstrous Height, accord∣ing to its Name, had Snow on the Top in the Be∣ginning of <HI>June</HI>; but it does not continue the Year round, as some have asserted.</P>
<P>These unpassable Heights were doubtless the Re∣fuges of the <HI>Britons,</HI> when, in their continual Wars with the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI> they were over∣power'd.</P>
<P>That Side of the County of <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> which borders on the Sea, is not so mountainous, and is both more fertile, and more populous. The prin∣cipal Place in this Part is <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> a good Town, with a Castle built by <HI>Edward</HI> I. to curb and re∣duce the wild People of the Mountains, and secure the Passage into <HI>Anglesea.</HI> That Prince also kept his Court often here; and here his eldest Son and Successor, <HI>Edward</HI> II. was born, who was there∣fore call'd <HI>Edward of Caernarvon.</HI> This <HI>Edward</HI> was the first of the Sons of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> vested with the Title of Prince of <HI>Wales:</HI> And here were kept the <HI>Chancery</HI> and <HI>Exchequer</HI> of the Princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> for the North Part of the Prin∣cipality, as it was at <HI>Caermarthen</HI> for the South Part. It is a small, but strong Town, clean, and well-built; and, considering the Place, the People are very cour∣teous and obliging to Strangers. It is seated on the Firth or Inlet call'd <HI>Meneu,</HI> parting the Isle of <HI>Anglesea,</HI> or <HI>Mona,</HI> from the main Land; and here

<P>Whoever travels critically over these Mountains of <HI>South-Wales</HI> and <HI>Merionethshire,</HI> will think <HI>Stone∣henge</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and <HI>Roll-rich</HI> Stones in <HI>Oxfora∣shire,</HI> no more Wonders, seeing there are so many such in these Provinces, that they are not thought strange of at all, nor is it doubted, but they were generally Monuments of the Dead; as also are the single Stones of immense Bulk, of which we saw so many, that we gave over remarking 'em. Some measur'd from 7, 8, to 10, and one 16 Feet high, being a whole Stone, but so great, that the most of the Wonder is, where they were found, and how dragg'd to the Place; since, besides the steep Ascents to some of the Hills, on which they stand, it would be hardly possible to move some of them, now, with 50 Yoke of Oxen. And yet a great many of these Stones are found confusedly lying one upon another on the utmost Summit or Top of the <HI>Gly∣der,</HI> and other Hills in <HI>Merioneth,</HI> or <HI>Caernarvon∣shire</HI>; to which it is next to impossible, that all the Power of Art, and Strength of Man and Beast, could carry them, and the Vulgar make no Difficulty of saying, The Devil set them up there.</P>
<P>One of these monumental Stones is to be seen a little way from <HI>Harleigh-Castle:</HI> It is a large Stone lying flat, supported by three other Stones at three of the four Angles, tho' the Stone is rather oval than square; it is almost 11 Feet long, the Breadth un∣equal; but in some Places it is from 7 to 8 Feet broad, and it may be supposed has been both longer and broader; 'tis in some Places about two Feet thick, but in others, 'tis worn almost to an Edge by Time. The three Stones that support it, are about
<PB N="327" REF="340"/>
20 Inches square; 'tis supposed there have been four, two of which, that support the thickest End, are near 8 Feet high, the other not above three Feet, being suppos'd to be settled in the Ground, so that the Stone lies sloping, like the Roof of a Barn. There is another of these to be seen in the Isle of <HI>Anglesea</HI>; the flat Stone is much larger and thicker than this; but we did not go to see it. There are also two Circles of Stones in that Island, such as <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> but larger.</P>
<P>This is a particular kind of Monument, and there∣fore I took Notice of it; but the others are generally single Stones of vast Magnitude, set up on one End, Column-wise, which being so very large, are likely to remain till the End of Time: but are generally without any Inscription, or regular Shape, or any Mark, to intimate for whom, or for what, they were so placed.</P>
<P>These Mountains are indeed so like the <HI>Alps,</HI> that except the Language of the People, one could hardly avoid thinking he is passing from <HI>Grenoble</HI> to <HI>Susa,</HI> or rather thro' the Country of the <HI>Grisons.</HI> The Lakes also, which are so numerous here, make the Similitude the greater: nor are the Fables which the Country People tell of these Lakes, much unlike the Stories which we meet with among the <HI>Switz∣ers,</HI> of the famous Lakes in their Country. Mr. <HI>Camden</HI>'s Continuator tells us of 50 or 60 Lakes in <HI>Caernarvonshire</HI> only. We did not count 'em, but I believe, if we had, we should have found them to be more, rather than less.</P>
<P>Here we met with the Char Fish, the same kind which we saw in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and also in the Lakes of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and no-where else, that I have heard of, in <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>Welsh</HI> call it the <HI>Torg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch.</HI></P>
<P>There is nothing of Note to be seen in the Isle of <HI>Anglesea,</HI> but the Town and the Castle of <HI>Beau∣maris,</HI> which was also built by King <HI>Edward</HI> I.
<PB N="328" REF="341"/>
and call'd <HI>Beau-marsh,</HI> or the <HI>Fine Plain</HI>; for here the Country is very level and plain, and the Land is fruitful and pleasant. The Castle was very large, as may be seen by its Remains; and that it was strong, the Situation will tell also; but 'tis now of no Use.</P>
<P>As we went to <HI>Holyhead,</HI> by the South Part of the Island from <HI>Newborough,</HI> and came back thro' the Middle to <HI>Beaumaris,</HI> we saw the whole Extent of it; and indeed, it is a much pleasanter Country than any Part of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> that we had yet seen; and particularly is very fruitful in Corn and Cattle.</P>
<P>Here we cross'd the <HI>Streight</HI> of <HI>Meneu</HI> again, and came to <HI>Bangor,</HI> at the Place where King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> I. intended to have built a great Stone-bridge: It would indeed have been a Work fit for so great a King: But the Bottom being doubtful, and the Sea in that Place sometimes very raging and strong, the Workmen thought it impracticable; and though the King was very positive in his Design for a great while, yet he was prevail'd with at last to decline it.</P>
<P><HI>Bangor</HI> is a Town noted for its Antiquity. It is a Bishop's See, but has an old, mean-looking, and almost despicable Cathedral Church.</P>
<P>This Church boasts of being one of the most antient in <HI>Britain,</HI> the People say, the most antient; and that St. <HI>Daniel</HI> (to whom it was dedicated) was first Bishop here, in the Year 512. They allow that the Pagans, perhaps of <HI>Anglesea,</HI> ruin'd the Church, and possess'd the Bishoprick after it was built, for above one hundred Years; nor is there any Ac∣count of it from the Year 512 to 1009: After this, the Bishoprick was ruin'd again by one of its own Bishops, whose Name was <HI>Bulkeley,</HI> who, as the <HI>Monasticon</HI> says, not only sold the Revenues, but even the very Bells; for which Sacrilege it is said he was struck blind.</P>
<P>It is certainly at present no rich Bishoprick; yet the Bishops are generally allow'd to hold some other
<PB N="329" REF="342"/>
good Benefice <HI>in Commendam,</HI> and the Preferment seems to be a grateful Introduction to the Clergy, as the Bishops are generally translated from hence to a more profitable one; and very few Gentlemen of the Function have dy'd Bishops of <HI>Bangor</HI>; so that, in some Sense, a Bishop of this See may be said to be immortal.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bangor</HI> we went North, (keeping the Sea on our Left-hand) to <HI>Conway.</HI> This is the poorest, but pleasantest Town in all this County for the Big∣ness of it; it is seated on the Bank of a fine River, which is not only pleasant and beautiful, but is a noble Harbour for Ships, had they any Occasion for them there; the Stream is deep and safe, and the River broad, as the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Deptford:</HI> It only wants a Trade suitable to so good a Port; for it in∣finitely outdoes <HI>Chester,</HI> and <HI>Liverpool</HI> too.</P>
<P>In this Passage, we went over the famous Preci∣pice call'd <HI>Penmaen-maur,</HI> which I think Fame has made abundance more frightful than it is; for tho' the Rock is indeed very high, and, if any one should fall from it, he would be dash'd in Pieces, yet, on the other hand, there is no Danger of it, a Wall being built all the Way, on the Edge of the Preci∣pice, to secure Passengers: Those who have been at the Hill or Pass of <HI>Enterkin</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> know very well, the Danger there is much greater than here; and the frequent Loss of Lives, both of Man and Horse, will testify the same.</P>
<P>We have but little remarkable in the Road from <HI>Conway</HI> to <HI>Holywell,</HI> but Craggs and Rocks all along the North Shore of <HI>Denbeigh,</HI> till we came to <HI>Den∣beigh</HI> the County Town, which has a Castle of great Strength; it is a large, populous Place, and has a good Trade carry'd on by Tanners and Glovers. This Town carries something in its Countenance of its Neighbourhood to <HI>England</HI>; but that which was most surprising, after such a tiresome and fatiguing
<PB N="330" REF="343"/>
Journey, over the inhospitable Mountains of <HI>Me∣rioneth</HI> and <HI>Caernarvonshire,</HI> was, that descending now from the Hills, we came into a most plea∣sant, fruitful, populous, and delicious Vale, full o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Villages and Towns, the Fields shining with Corn▪ just ready for the Reapers, the Meadows green and flowery, and a fine River, of a mild and gentle Stream, running thro' it: Nor is it a small or casua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Intermission, but we had a Prospect of the Country open before us for above 20 Miles in Length, and from 5 to 7 Miles in Breadth, all smiling with the same kind of Complexion; which made us think our∣selves in <HI>England</HI> again, all on a sudden.</P>
<P>In this pleasant Vale, turning North from <HI>Den∣beigh,</HI> and following the Stream of the River, we came to <HI>St. Asaph,</HI> in <HI>Flintshire,</HI> a small City, with a Cathedral, being a Bishoprick of tolerable good Value, though the Church is old: It is but a poor Place, and ill-built, although the Country is so plea∣sant and rich all round it. There are some old Mo∣numents in this Church, but none of any Note, nor could we read the <HI>Welsh</HI> Inscriptions.</P>
<P>From hence we came to <HI>Holywell:</HI> The Story of it is, that the pious Virgin, St. <HI>Winifred,</HI> being ravish'd and murder'd, this healing Water sprung out of her Body when buried. The <HI>Romanists</HI> be∣lieve it, as 'tis evident, from their thronging hither to receive Benefit from the healing Virtue of the Water, which they do not hope for as medicinal, but as miraculous, and think it heals them by vir∣tue of the Intercession and Influence of this famous Virgin, St. <HI>Winifrid.</HI></P>
<P>The Chapel dedicated to this Holy Virgin, is cut out of a solid Rock, and Numbers of Pilgrims re∣sort to it, with great Devotion. Under this Chapel, the Water gushes out into a great Stream, and the Place where it breaks out, is form'd like a Basin or Cistern, in which they bathe: The Water is intensly
<PB N="331" REF="344"/>
cold, and indeed there is no great Miracle in that Point, considering the Rocks it flows from, where it is impregnated by divers Minerals; the Virtue of which, and not of the Saint, I suppose, work the greatest Part of the Cures, that may be suppos'd to be effected there.</P>
<P>There is a little Town near the Well, which may, indeed, be said to have risen from the Con∣fluence of People thither; for almost all the Houses are either Publick Houses, or let into Lodgings; and the Priests who attend here, and are very numerous, appear in Disguise: Sometimes they are Physicians, sometimes Surgeons, sometimes Gentlemen, and sometimes Patients, or any thing, as Occasion pre∣sents. Nobody takes notice of them, as to their Religion, though they are well known, no not the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> themselves; but in private they have their proper Oratories in certain Places, whi∣ther the Votaries resort; and good Manners has pre∣vail'd so far, that no Protestant, let him know what he will, takes Notice of it, or inquires where one goes, or has been gone.</P>
<P>The principal Towns in <HI>Flintshire,</HI> are, 1. <HI>Flint,</HI> the Shire Town, but so small, that it has not a Market. 2. <HI>St. Asaph,</HI> before-mention'd. 3. <HI>Caer∣wys,</HI> the chief Market-Town of the County.</P>
<P>From hence we pass'd by <HI>Flint-Castle,</HI> a known Place, but of no Consequence now; and directly to <HI>Wrexham,</HI> deemed the largest Town in <HI>North-Wales,</HI> having heard much of a fine Church there, but we were greatly disappointed: There is indeed a very large Tower or Steeple, as some call it, adorn'd with Imagery; but far from fine: The Work is mean, the Statues without any Fancy or Spirit; and as the Stone is of a reddish crumbling Kind, like the Cathe∣dral at <HI>Chester,</HI> Time has made it look gross and rough.</P>
<P>There are a great many antient Monuments in this Church, and in the Church-yard also; but none of
<PB N="332" REF="345"/>
Note, and almost all the Inscriptions are in <HI>Welsh.</HI> The Church is large; but they must be much mis∣taken, who tell us 'tis one of the finest in <HI>England</HI>; for it falls short in that respect, of even those Churches which are as old as itself.</P>
<P>This Town is large, well-built and populous; and besides the Church, there are two large Meeting-Houses, in one of which, we were told they preach in <HI>Welsh</HI> one Part of the Day, and in <HI>English</HI> the other. Here is a great Market for Flannel, which the Factors buy up of the poor <HI>Welsh</HI> People, who manufacture it; and thence it is sent to <HI>London</HI>; and is a considerable Manufacture thro' all this Part of the Country, by which the Poor are very pro∣fitably imploy'd.</P>
<P>We could not omit seeing the once famous <HI>Ban∣chor,</HI> which <HI>Malmsbury</HI> confounds with the Episcopal <HI>Bangor</HI>; and were pleas'd to see there a fine Stone Bridge over the <HI>Dee.</HI> This was once a City, and the Monastery was so famous, that in the Time of the <HI>British</HI> Kings it was said to contain 2400 Monks, who in their Turns (<HI>viz.</HI> 100 each Hour of the 24) reading Prayers and singing Psalms continually, Divine Service was perform'd Day and Night without In∣termission. But now not so much as the Ruins are to be seen, and as all the People in the little Vil∣lage, that takes place of it, spoke <HI>Welsh,</HI> we could find no body that could give us any Intelligence. So effectually had Time eras'd the very Foundations of the Place.</P>
<P>This is said to be the Birth-place of that Arch-here∣tick <HI>Pelagius,</HI> who from hence began to broach his heretical Opinions, which afterwards so terribly over∣spread the Church. <HI>Camden</HI> observes, that this <HI>Ban∣gor</HI> is situated in the County of <HI>Flint.</HI></P>
<P>But before I have intirely done with the Princi∣pality, give me leave to observe briefly a few things with relation to this Journey, and the Gentlemen of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="346"/>Tho' this Journey, and especially over such mon∣strous Hills and Precipices, as those in <HI>Merioneth</HI> and some other Shires, was a little heavy to us, yet were we well supported through it, for we generally found their Provisions very good and cheap, and pretty good Accommodations in the Inns.</P>
<P>The <HI>Welsh</HI> Gentlemen are very hospitable; and the People in general very obliging and conversable, especially to Strangers. When we let them know, we travell'd merely in Curiosity to view the Country, their Civility was heightened to such a Degree, that nothing could be more friendly, and they were will∣ing to tell us every thing that belong'd to their Coun∣try, and to shew us all that we desir'd to see.</P>
<P>They value themselves much upon their antient Heroes, as <HI>Caractacus, Owen ap Tudor,</HI> Prince <HI>Lewellin</HI>; and particularly upon the Antiquity of their Families, and laugh at a Pedigree, that can't be trac'd higher than the Conquest. It must be own'd, that the Gentlemen, justly claim a very antient Descent, and have preserv'd their Families intire, for many Ages: They receive you well into their Houses, treat you very handsomely, are very gene∣rous; and indeed, nothing is wanting within Doors; and, what is more, they have generally very good Estates to support their Hospitality; but they are very jealous of Affronts, and soon provok'd to An∣ger, which is seldom allay'd without Satisfaction; and then become as soon reconcil'd again.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII. CONTAINING A Description of Part of <HI>Cheshire, North∣amptonshire,</HI> and <HI>Leicestershire.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Continued at <HI>Chester</HI> for some time, except that I made two or three Ex∣cursions into the neighbouring Country, and particularly into that Part of <HI>Shrop∣shire</HI> which I had not view'd as I went; as also into the North, and North-west Parts of <HI>Cheshire.</HI> But I should first acquaint you, that <HI>Malpas,</HI> through which I came from <HI>Wales,</HI> is situate on a high Hill, and was formerly strengthened by a Castle, which is now in Ruins. The Church is a stately Building, and stands on the most eminent Part of the Town: It has 2 Rectors, who do Duty alternately. The Town consists of 3 Streets, and is well pav'd; has a good Market, a Grammar-School, and an Hospital.</P>
<P>The first Trip I made, was into the <HI>Cestria Cher∣sonesus,</HI> as I think we may properly call it: It is bounded by the two great Firths, or Arms of the Sea,
<PB N="335" REF="348"/>
the one call'd the Mouth of the <HI>Dee,</HI> and the other of the two Rivers <HI>Mersey</HI> and <HI>Weaver,</HI> which form it into a Peninsula. It is about 16 Miles long, 6 or 7 over, and has not one Market Town in it, tho' it is exceeding rich and fertile; occasion'd possibly by the Neighbourhood of two such great Towns, as <HI>Chester</HI> and <HI>Liverpool.</HI></P>
<P>Going down from <HI>Chester,</HI> by the <HI>Rhoodee,</HI> as they call it, that is, the Marshes of the River <HI>Dee,</HI> and coasting the River after it is grown broader than the Marshes, the first Place of any Note which we come to, is <HI>Nesson,</HI> where, in the late <HI>Irish</HI> War, most of the Troops embark'd for that grand Ex∣pedition: From hence the Vessels go away to <HI>High-lake,</HI> where they ride safe in their Way, as the Ships from <HI>London</HI> lie in the <HI>Downs,</HI> till the Wind pre∣sents for their respective Voyages.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Chester.</HI> It is a fine old City and Colony of the <HI>Romans</HI>; and many Antiquities have been found in it. It has four Churches beside the Cathedral, which is a Pile venerable for Antiquity, but in no extraordinary Condition. There are Sha∣dows of many Pictures on the Wall, but defac'd. At the West End, in Niches are some Images of the Earls Palatine of <HI>Chester.</HI> The adjoining Abbey is quite ruin'd. The Walls round the City are kept in very good Repair, at the Charge of the Corpo∣ration, and afford a pleasant, airy Walk. The Ex∣change is a neat Building, supported by Columns 13 Feet high, of one Stone each. Over it is the City-hall, a well-contrived Court of Judicature. The Castle was formerly the Palace, where the Earls assembled their Parliaments, and enacted Laws inde∣pendent of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> determining all Causes themselves. It has always a Garrison kept in it. The Piazza's or Rows, as they call them, do not in my Opinion, add any thing to the Beauty of the City; but, on the contrary, serve to make it look
<PB N="336" REF="349"/>
both old and indifferent. These <HI>Rows</HI> are certain long Galleries, up one Pair of Stairs, which run along the Side of the Streets, before all the Houses, tho' joined to them, and, as is pretended, they are to keep the People dry in walking along. This they do indeed effectually, but then they take away all the View of the Houses from the Street, nor can a Stranger, that was to ride thro' <HI>Chester,</HI> see any Shops in the City; besides, they make the Shops themselves dark, and the Way in them is dark, dirty, and un∣even.</P>
<P>The best Ornament of the City is, that the Streets are very broad and fair, and run thro' the whole City in strait Lines, crossing in the middle of it as at <HI>Chichester:</HI> The Walls afford a very pleasant Walk, as I have said, round the City, and within the Battlements, from whence you may see the cir∣cumjacent Country, and particularly on the Side of the <HI>Rhoodee,</HI> which is a fine large low Green, on the Bank of the <HI>Dee,</HI> which in Winter is often under Water by the Inundations of the River. Be∣yond the <HI>Rhoodee,</HI> may be seen from the Walls of <HI>Chester</HI> the County of <HI>Flint,</HI> and the Mountains of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>The Castle is a good firm Building, and strong, tho' not fortify'd with many Outworks: There is always a good Garrison kept in it. 'Tis said this Castle was built, or at least repair'd, by <HI>Hugh Lupus,</HI> the famous Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> Nephew to <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, as was also the Church; the Body of whom was lately (<HI>Anno</HI> 1723) discover'd, as is supposed, in an old ruinous Building called, The Chapter-house.</P>
<P>It was first wrapp'd in Leather, and then inclos'd in a Stone Coffin. The Skull and all the Bones were very fresh, and in their proper Position; and, what is more remarkable, the String which ty'd the Ankles together, was whole and intire, altho' it was then upwards of 650 Years since the Interrment.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="350"/><HI>Chester</HI> is but a modern Bishoprick, being so made in the Year 1541. when King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. di∣vided it from <HI>Lichfield.</HI> They tell us, that King <HI>Edgar,</HI> who conquer'd all this Part of <HI>Britain,</HI> and was rowed up the <HI>Dee</HI> in his Royal Barge by Seven, or, as some say, Eight Kings, himself steering the Helm, founded the great Church, which <HI>Lupus</HI> finish'd and endow'd.</P>
<P>Here is a noble Stone Bridge over the <HI>Dee,</HI> very high and strong built, and 'tis needful it should be so; for the <HI>Dee</HI> is a most furious Stream at some Seasons, and brings a vast Weight of Water with it from the Mountains of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chester</HI> has long given Title of Earl to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> eldest Son of the King.</P>
<P><HI>Chester</HI> was formerly an Harbour for Shipping; but the Sea had long ago withdrawn itself; and the River <HI>Dee</HI> was so choaked up, that Vessels of Bur∣den could not come within some Miles of it; so that an Act of Parliament passed in the Year 1732, for rendering it navigable. And in Pursuance thereof, the Undertakers, raised a Sum of 47,830<HI>l.</HI> which they have expended in cutting and perfecting a new Chanel for the River <HI>Dee,</HI> of near Ten Miles in Length, and in making proper Dams and Sluices, into which they have turned the said River; so that it is actually navigable at this Time for Ships and Vessels of considerable Burdens to the Quay, or Key, of <HI>Chester,</HI> where they load and unload Goods and Merchandize. This Success encourag'd the Un∣dertakers to apply to Parliament (1740-1), for further Powers to complete the same, and for uniting the said Undertakers into a Company for that laud∣able Purpose.</P>
<P>This County, though so remote from <HI>London,</HI> is one of those which contributes much to its Support, as well as to that of several other Parts of <HI>England,</HI> by its excellent Cheese, which they make here in
<PB N="338" REF="351"/>
such Quantities, that, as I am told from very good Authority, the City of <HI>London</HI> only takes off 14000 Tons every Year; besides vast Quantities which they send to <HI>Bristol</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> and also to <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI>; so that the Quantity of Cheese made here, must be prodigiously great. Indeed, the whole County is imploy'd in it, and Part of its Neigh∣bourhood too; for though it goes by the Name of <HI>Cheshire Cheese,</HI> yet great Quantities of it are made in such Parts of <HI>Shropshire, Staffordshire,</HI> and <HI>Lan∣cashire,</HI> as border upon <HI>Cheshire.</HI></P>
<P>The Soil is extraordinarily good, and the Grass has a peculiar Richness in it, which disposes the Kine to give a great Quantity of Milk, which is very sweet and good; and this Cheese Manufacture increases every Day, raises the Value of the Lands, and en∣courages the Farmers to keep vast Stocks of Cows; which of themselves contribute to improve and en∣rich the Land.</P>
<P>While we were station'd, as I may say, at <HI>Chester,</HI> I made a Trip to several Places round about it. And particularly to the fine old Seat of the Lord <HI>Dela∣mere,</HI> and the spacious Forest which gives Title to that noble Family. They say here was formerly an old City, now called the <HI>Chamber on the Forest,</HI> pro∣bably some Fort or Camp to secure the Road. From hence is so fine a Prospect of the <HI>Welsh</HI> Mountains, that I never before beheld such a noble Scene of Nature. <HI>Beeston-Castle</HI> is on our left, built upon a Precipice. This Forest is noted for great Plenty of Red and Fallow Deer, and is a great Relief for Fish, Fowl, and Turf, to the neighbouring Towns, whereof there are a great many small ones about this Forest, and thro' the upper Part of it the <HI>Weaver</HI> takes its Course. The chief Town hereabout is <HI>Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>desham,</HI> famous formerly for a Castle, and the Seat of the Family of the <HI>Savages,</HI> which however is but a mean Market-town. Near this Place is also
<PB N="339" REF="352"/>
the famous Seat of <HI>Rock-Savage,</HI> built on the Ascent of an Hill belonging to the same Family, whereof the last was the late Earl <HI>Rivers.</HI></P>
<P>On the South Side of the Park stands <HI>Beeston</HI>-Castle, upon an Hill environ'd with Mountains, and yet overlooks almost the whole County. It is very strong, covers a great Extent of Ground, and is adorn'd with many Towers. It gives Name to an antient Family in this County.</P>
<P>From <HI>Chester</HI> we kept directly on East to <HI>Middle∣wich,</HI> a large Market-town, with a spacious Church, but chiefly noted for making Salt; where are Two excellent Brine-seeths.</P>
<P>We followed the <HI>Weaver</HI> directly North to <HI>North∣wich</HI> also famous for Brine-springs, and for making great Quantities of the finest Salt by boiling the Water in large iron Pans of small Depth. As fast as the Salt crystallizes, they rake it out, and dry it in wicker Baskets of a conick Form. The Duty it brings in is very considerable.</P>
<P>Within these Fifty Years, on the South-side of the Town, they discover'd a great many Mines of Rock-salt, which they continually dig up, and send in great Lumps to the maritime Ports, where it is dissolv'd, and made into eating Salt. We were let down by a Bucket 150 Feet deep to the Bottom of the Salt Quarry, a most pleasant subterraneous Pro∣spect, looking like a Cathedral supported by Rows of Pillars, and Roof of Crystal, all of the same Rock, transparent and glittering from the numerous Candles of the Workmen, labouring with their Steel Pick-axes in digging it away. This Rock-work extends to several Acres.</P>
<P>There is a good Church at <HI>Northwich,</HI> with a fine Roof, and semicircular Choir.</P>
<P>At <HI>Lawton-yates</HI> they bore 60 Yards deep for the Salt Spring; at <HI>Hassal</HI> 47; at <HI>Wheelock</HI> 18; about <HI>Middlewich</HI> less; at <HI>Northwich</HI> it rises to open Day;
<PB N="340" REF="353"/>
which seems to intimate, that the salt Spring runs be∣tween Layers of the Earth in an horizontal Line. Upon Boring, it rises with great Impetuosity, so that the Workmen have scarce Time to get out of the Wells. This is all along the Side of a Brook that comes from a remarkable Hill called <HI>Mawcop,</HI> upon the Edge of <HI>Staffordshire</HI>; so that the Ground rises above the true Level in the mentioned Proportion.</P>
<P>From <HI>Northwich</HI> we travell'd North-east, and came to <HI>Knutsford,</HI> a good Town, and finely situated. A Brook runs thro' it, and divides it into two. It has a Market and Town-house, and a pretty good Pa∣rochial Church.</P>
<P><HI>Altringham</HI> and <HI>Stockport,</HI> Two small Market-towns, lie higher up Northward, the first near, and the other upon the Borders of <HI>Lancashire</HI>; and hear∣ing of nothing remarkable in them, we turned South-east from <HI>Knutsford</HI> to <HI>Macclesfield,</HI> which they call in this County <HI>Maxfield.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Macclesfield</HI> is situate in the Forest of the same Name, a Town of great Antiquity, and very fair and spacious. 'Tis under the Government of a Mayor, and enjoys many particular Privileges by virtue of the Court and Liberties of the Forest. It has a good Church with a high Spire Steeple, and a College adjoining to it, in which are buried a great many of the <HI>Savages:</HI> and here is also a good Free-school, and a thriving Manufacture of Buttons.</P>
<P>From hence we veer'd about, and came South-west to <HI>Congleton,</HI> near the Borders of <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> a fair Mayor-town and well-water'd on all Sides. It has Two Churches, and is noted for a good Trade in Gloves.</P>
<P>We then came to the Market-town of <HI>Sandbach,</HI> which is delightfully situated on a Branch of the <HI>Weaver.</HI> It has a fair Church, and in the Market-place stand Two Crosses of Stone, with the History
<PB N="341" REF="354"/>
of Christ's Passion ingraven on them. The Ale here is deservedly famed.</P>
<P>From <HI>Sandbach</HI> we went on Southward, and came to the great <HI>London</HI> Road at <HI>Namptwich,</HI> which stands upon it. This Town is well-built, and the Streets look fair, having a great many Gentlemens Houses in them. The Church is a noble Edifice in the Form of a Cross, with the Steeple rising from the Middle; but the Maintenance of the Minister is mean and pitiful. The Inhabitants are rich, and carry on a good Trade in most sort of Commodities, but principally in making Salt and Cheese, the latter exceeding all that is made in the County, as the Soil this Way is esteemed the best, and, as 'tis said, was called by King <HI>Edward</HI> I. the <HI>Vale Royal.</HI></P>
<P>Thus having made my Circuit round the County, I shall go from hence South to <HI>Whitchurch</HI> in <HI>Shrop∣shire.</HI> But I must first note two things of <HI>Cheshire:</HI> 1. That there is no Part of <HI>England,</HI> where there are equal Numbers of Gentry, of such antient and noble Extraction: Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> is very particular in their Names and Descents, to whom therefore I must refer. 2. That it is a County <HI>Palatine,</HI> and has been so for many Ages, and its Government is distinct from any other, and very particular; it is administred by a <HI>Chamberlain,</HI> a <HI>Judge Special,</HI> who is call'd <HI>Chief Justice</HI> of <HI>Chester,</HI> two <HI>Barons</HI> of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> three <HI>Sergeants at Law,</HI> a <HI>Sheriff,</HI> an <HI>At∣torney,</HI> an <HI>Escheator,</HI> and all proper and usual sub∣ordinate Officers; and the Jurisdiction of all these Offices is kept up, and preserv'd very strictly; only we are to note, that the <HI>Judge Special,</HI> as he is call'd, tries only civil Causes, not criminal, which are left to the ordinary Judges of <HI>England,</HI> who go the Cir∣cuits here, as in other Places.</P>
<P><HI>Whitchurch</HI> is a pleasant, large, and populous Town, and has a very good Church, in which is the famous Monument of the great <HI>Talbot,</HI> first E. of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI>
<PB N="342" REF="355"/>
who was call'd in his Time the <HI>English</HI> ACHILLES, and who was so renown'd in the Wars of <HI>France,</HI> that no Man in that Kingdom dared to encounter him single-handed. He had ingraven on one Side of his Sword, <HI>Sum Talboti,</HI> and on the Reverse, <HI>Pro vincere inimicos meos.</HI> His Epitaph is as follows, in capital Letters:
<Q>ORATE PRO ANIMA PRAENOBILIS DO∣MINI, DOMINI IOHANNIS TALBOTT, QUONDAM COMITIS SALOPIAE, DOMINI TALBOTT, DOMINI FURNIVALL, DO∣MINI VERDON, DOMINI STRANGE DE BLACKMERE, ET MARESCHALLI FRAN∣CIAE, QUI OBIIT IN BELLO APVD BVR∣DEWS VII. IVLII MCCCCLIII.</Q></P>
<P>This Town has a good Market, and a great many Gentry near it, whereof some are <HI>Roman-catho∣licks.</HI> They tell us, that this Town, when King <HI>Charles</HI> I. remov'd his Standard from <HI>Nottingham</HI> to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> raised a whole Regiment for his Service.</P>
<P>From hence we turn'd South, and passing by <HI>Wem,</HI> the Title given by King <HI>James</HI> II. to his Lord Chan∣cellor <HI>Jefferies,</HI> thence we came to <HI>Elsmere,</HI> which gives Title of Baron to the Duke of <HI>Bridg∣water,</HI> and is famous for a great Lake or Mere, which gives the Town its Name, and which the People pretend has in some Places no Bottom. This Place is remarkable for good Fish.</P>
<P>And further on West, on the Confines of <HI>Den∣bighshire,</HI> stands <HI>Oswestry,</HI> a Bailiwick Market-town, famous formerly for the Sale of <HI>Welsh</HI> Cottons and Flanels, but now only for the last. It is inclosed with a Wall, and a Ditch, and fortified with a Castle, and has a good Church without the Gate covered with
<PB N="343" REF="356"/>
Lead. From hence we came the same Night to <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shrewsbury</HI> is supposed to have been built out of the Ruins of the antient <HI>Uriconium.</HI> In the Reign of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, <HI>Roger</HI> Earl of <HI>Montgo∣mery</HI> built a Castle here, on the North Side, and a stately Abbey, some Ruins of which are still to be seen. It is a beautiful, large, pleasant, populous, and rich Town; full of Gentry, and yet full of Trade too; for here likewise is a great Manufacture, as well of Flanel, as also of white Broad-cloth, which inriches all the Country round it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Severn</HI> in part surrounds this Town, just as the <HI>Thames</HI> does the <HI>Isle of Dogs</HI>; so that it makes the Form of an Horse-shoe. Over it are two fine Stone Bridges, upon one of which is built a very noble Gate, and, over the Arch of the Gate, the Statue of the great <HI>Llewellin,</HI> the Idol of the <HI>Welsh,</HI> and their last Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>This is really a Town of Mirth and Gallantry, something like <HI>Bury</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> or <HI>Durham</HI> in the North, but much bigger than either of them, or in∣deed than both together.</P>
<P>Over the Market-house is kept a kind of Hall for the Manufactures, which are sold here weekly in very great Quantities; they speak all <HI>English</HI> in the Town, but on a Market-day you would think you were in <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>Here is the greatest Market, the greatest Plenty of good Provisions, and the cheapest that is to be met with in all the Western Part of <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Severn</HI> supplies them here with excellent Salmon, but 'tis also brought in great Plenty from the <HI>Dee,</HI> which is not far off, and abounds with a very good Kind, and is generally larger than in the <HI>Severn.</HI> As an Ex∣ample of the Cheapness of Provisions, we paid here, in a publick Inn, but a Groat a Night for Hay, and Sixpence a Peck for Oats, for our Horses, which is
<PB N="344" REF="357"/>
cheaper than we found it in the cheapest Part of the North of <HI>England</HI>; all our other Provisions were in Proportion; and there is no doubt but the Cheap∣ness of Provisions, joined to the Pleasantness and Healthiness of the Place, draws a great many Fami∣lies hither, who love to live within the Compass of their Estates.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> calls it a City: and 'tis indeed equal to several good Cities in <HI>England,</HI> and superior to some. Near this Place was fought the bloody Battle between <HI>Henry Hotspur,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> IV. King of <HI>England,</HI> in which the former was kill'd, and all his Army overthrown, and the Place is called <HI>Battle∣field</HI> to this Day.</P>
<P>Here are Five Churches, Two of them with lofty Spires. St. <HI>Chad</HI>'s, and St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s, are said to be antiently collegiate. There are abundance of antient Monuments in them all, which I have not room to mention.</P>
<P>This Town will for ever be famous for the Re∣ception it gave to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. who, after setting up his Standard at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and finding no En∣couragement there, remov'd to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> being in∣vited by the Gentry of the Town and Country round, where he was receiv'd with such a general Affection, and hearty Zeal, that his Majesty recover'd him∣self from the Discouragement of his first Step at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and raised and compleated a strong Army in less Time than could be imagin'd; insomuch that, to the Surprize of the Parliament, and indeed of all the World, he was in the Field before them, and advanced upon them so fast, that he met them Two-thirds onward of his Way to <HI>London,</HI> and gave them Battle at <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> near <HI>Banbury.</HI></P>
<P>But the Fate of the War turning afterwards against the King, the Weight of it fell heavy upon this Town, and almost ruin'd it.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="358"/>But they are now fully recover'd, and it is one of the most flourishing Towns in <HI>England.</HI> The Walls and Gates are yet standing, but useless; and the old Castle is gone to Ruin, as is the Case of almost all the old Castles in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It should not be forgotten, that notwithstanding the Healthiness of the Place, here broke out first that unaccountable Plague, call'd, <HI>The Sweating Sickness, Anno</HI> 1551; which spread itself thro' the whole King∣dom, and afterwards into several foreign Nations.</P>
<P>Here is a good Free-school, the most considerable in this Part of <HI>England</HI>; built and endow'd by Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> with a very sufficient Maintenance for a Chief or Head-Master, and Three Under-Masters or Ushers. The Buildings are very spacious, and particularly the Library, which has a great many Books in it. The School-masters have also very handsome Houses to dwell in; so that the whole has the Face of a College.</P>
<P>There was a fine School here before, erected by the Town's-people, and maintain'd several Years by their Contribution. But the Queen took the Matter into her own Hands, and built the whole Fabrick new from the Ground, endowing it liberally out of her own Royal Bounty.</P>
<P>Here I was shew'd a very visible and remarkable Appearance of the great antient Road or Way call'd <HI>Watling-street,</HI> which comes from <HI>London</HI> to this Town, and goes on from hence to the utmost Coast of <HI>Wales.</HI> Remains of a Stone Bridge are to be seen in the Bottom of the River, when the Water is low. This Road is raised a good Height above the Soil, and so strait, that upon an Eminence you may see it Ten or Fifteen Miles before you, and as much be∣hind, over many Hill-tops answering one the other as a Vista of Trees.</P>
<P>We lodg'd at an Inn called <HI>Ivesey-bank,</HI> on the Borders between <HI>Staffordshire</HI> and <HI>Shropshire.</HI> About
<PB N="346" REF="359"/>
a Mile off in a large Wood stands <HI>Boscobel-house,</HI> or <HI>White-Ladies,</HI> as some call it, where the <HI>Pendrils</HI> lived, who preserved King <HI>Charles</HI> II. after <HI>Worcester</HI> Battle, and famous for the Royal Oak. The Grand∣daughter of that <HI>William Pendril</HI> still liv'd in the House, when I was there. The Floor of the Gar∣ret, which is a Popish Chapel, (formerly a Nunnery in Possession of the Family of <HI>Cooksey</HI>) being matted, prevents any Suspicion of a little Cavity with a Trap∣door over the Stair-case where the King was hid. His Bed was artfully plac'd behind some Wainscot, that shut up very close. A Descendant of the <HI>Cook∣seys</HI> still keeps the Gloves and Garters, which his Majesty left behind him.</P>
<P>The said Chapel is still standing, and has some painted Saints upon the Wall at one End.</P>
<P>A Bow-shot from the House, just by a Horse∣track passing thro' the Wood, stood the Royal Oak, into which the King and Col. <HI>Carlos</HI> climbed, by means of the Hen-roost Ladder, when they thought it no longer safe to stay in the House, the Family reaching them Victuals with the Nut-hook. It hap∣pened, as the People related it to us, that whilst the King and Colonel were in the Tree, a Party of the Enemy's Horse, sent to search the House, came whi∣stling and talking along this Road; and when they were just under the Tree, an Owl flew out of a neighbouring Tree, and hover'd along the Ground, as if her Wings were broken, which the Soldiers merrily pursued.</P>
<P>The Tree is now inclos'd within a Brick Wall, the Inside whereof is cover'd with Laurel, of which we may say, as <HI>Ovid</HI> did of that of the <HI>Augustan</HI> Pa∣lace,—<HI>Mediamque tuebere quercum.</HI> For the Oak is in the Middle, almost cut away by Travellers, whose Curiosity leads them to see it. Close by the Side grows a young thriving Plant from one of its Acorns.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="360"/>After the Restoration, the King, reviewing the Place, no doubt, with very different Emotions to what he had when he was in it, gather'd some of the Acorns, and set them in <HI>St. James's Park</HI> or Gar∣den, and us'd to water them himself. If we may judge of the Value the King put upon his Preserva∣tion, and Royal Person, it was worth 200<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> and one should think a King, if worth any thing, worth that; for so much he gave to <HI>Pendril,</HI> and it now remains in the Family. Over the Door of the Inclosure is this Inscription cut in Marble:
<Q><HI>Felicissimam arborem, quam in asylum potentissimi regis</HI> Caroli II. <HI>Deus O. M. per quem reges regnant, hic crescere voluit, tam in perpetuam rei tantae memoriam, quam specimen firmae in reges fidei, muro cinctam posteris commendant</HI> Basilius <HI>&amp;</HI> Jana Fitzherbert.
<L><HI>Quercus amica Jovi.</HI></L></Q> That is,
<Q><HI>Basil</HI> and <HI>Jane Fitzherbert</HI> recommend to Poste∣rity this most fortunate Tree, which the All∣gacious and Almighty God, by whom Kings reign, ordained here to grow, to be the Asylum of the most potent Prince, King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and have begirt it with a Wall, as well in per∣petual Remembrance of so great an Event, as a Testimony of their firm Allegiance to Kings.
<L>— The Oak belov'd by <HI>Jove.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Ten Miles South-east of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> stands <HI>Great Wenlock,</HI> an antient Borough and good Market-town. The noted <HI>Wreken-hill</HI> stands higher up, North of it, between the <HI>Watlingstreet</HI> and the <HI>Se∣vern,</HI> and within a Mile of <HI>Wroxeter,</HI> the famous <HI>Roman</HI> Station. It ascends gradually from a pleasant level Ground, strikes out a pretty great Length, and is well adorn'd with Trees. 'Tis the highest
<PB N="348" REF="361"/>
Ground in all the County, and gives a fine Prospect all around it.</P>
<P>Following <HI>the Watling street</HI> North, we came to a small Market-town call'd <HI>Wellington,</HI> of very little Note; and still keeping <HI>the Street,</HI> we arrived at <HI>New∣port</HI> on the Borders of <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> a little Mar∣ket-town, where is one of the noblest Foundations for a School in the whole Kingdom, endowed by one <HI>Adams,</HI> an Haberdasher of <HI>London,</HI> to the Value of 7000<HI>l.</HI> The School is 70 Feet long, 22 wide, and the same in Height, a Library, a House for both the Master and Usher, 60<HI>l.</HI> a Year to the first, and 30<HI>l.</HI> to the other, and a Garden to each House of an Acre, and Two Acres for the Boys to play in. Near it he has likewise built an Alms-house, and gave 550<HI>l.</HI> towards building the Town-house. Over the School-door is this Distich:
<Q><L><HI>Scripsisti haeredem patriam, tibi quae dedit ortum:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Scriberis ergo tuae, jure, pater patriae.</HI></L></Q> That is,
<Q><L>Thy Country is thy Heir: and therefore we</L>
<L>Justly esteem thy Country's Parent Thee.</L></Q></P>
<P>Between this Town and <HI>Drayton,</HI> a small Market-town, higher up Northward, and likewise on the Borders of <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> is <HI>Bloreheath,</HI> famous for a Battle fought between the House of <HI>York</HI> and that of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> wherein <HI>Nevil</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> for the former, with 5000 Men only, beat Lord <HI>Audley</HI> with 10000 Men, after a most bloody Engagement.</P>
<P>Entering <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> we quitted the said <HI>Street∣way,</HI> a little to the left, to see <HI>Stafford</HI> the County-town, and the most considerable, except <HI>Litchfield,</HI> in the County. In the Way we pass'd thro' a small, but antient Town, call'd <HI>Penkrige,</HI> vulgarly <HI>Pank∣rage,</HI> probably the <HI>Penn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erucium</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI>
<PB N="349" REF="362"/>
where happen'd to be a Fair. We were surprised to see the prodigious Number of the finest and most beautiful Horses that can any-where be seen, brought hither from <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> the Bishoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> and all the Horse-breeding Counties in <HI>England:</HI> we were told there were not less than an hundred Joc∣keys or Horse-kopers, as they call them there, from <HI>London,</HI> to buy Horses for Sale. Also an incredible Number of Gentlemen attended with their Grooms, to buy Hunters and good Road Horses. In a Word, I believe I may mark it for the greatest Horse-Fair in the World, for Horses of Value, and especially those we call Saddle-Horses; tho' there were great Numbers of fine large Stone-Horses for Coach and Draught too.</P>
<P>From hence we came in Two Hours easy Riding to <HI>Stafford,</HI> on the River <HI>Sow.</HI> 'Tis an antient Town, and gives Name to the County; but we thought to have found in it something more worth go∣ing so much out of the Way for. It is however neat and well-built, and pleasantly seated in low Grounds, and is lately much increased, and grown rich by the Clothing-trade. It is governed by a Mayor, and other inferior Officers, consists of Two Parishes, and has a good Free-school. 'Tis said this Town retains the antient Custom of <HI>Borough English,</HI> which is, that the youngest Sons inherit the Lands of their Fathers within the Town. Here is likewise a fine square Market-place, where stands the Shire-Hall, and the Streets are well paved.</P>
<P>We tarry'd here a few Days, in order to visit the Towns lying on each Side of it, with more At∣tention and Convenience.</P>
<P><HI>Eccleshall</HI> lies North-west of <HI>Stafford,</HI> and is a pretty Market-town noted for Pedlery-wares; and a little Market-town call'd <HI>Stone,</HI> lies upon the <HI>Trent.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Line</HI> stands still further North, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Trent.</HI> 'Tis govern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by a

Mayor, Two Justices, Two Bailiffs, and Common-council, and holds Pleas under 40<HI>s.</HI> The Streets are large, broad, and pav'd; but the Houses are low, and generally thatch'd: the Clothing-trade flourishes here, and the Town is surrounded with Coal-pits. Here are the Ruins of an old Castle. The Coals here are cut out in Slices, and shine with all the va∣rious Colours of a Peacock's Tail, and therefore are call'd <HI>Peacock-Coals.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Plot,</HI> as an Instance of the Growth of Stones, mentions, that near this Place was found a Stone, with a Man's Skull, Teeth and all, inclosed in it. And here is an excellent Device for the Taming of Shrews: they put a Bridle into the Scold's Mouth, which deprives her of the Power of Speech, by which she is led about the Town, and expos'd to publick Shame, till she promises Amendment.</P>
<P><HI>Betley,</HI> a little Market-town, lies West of <HI>New∣castle,</HI> upon the Borders of <HI>Cheshire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Breewood</HI> is a pretty Market-town, lying South-west of <HI>Stafford.</HI> And due South stands</P>
<P><HI>Wolverhampton,</HI> a very antient Town, situate on an Hill, which is well-built, pav'd, and inhabited. Here the Trade of Lock-making is carry'd on to great Perfection. In its Church are several old Mo∣numents, and a Brass Statue of Sir <HI>Richard Leveson,</HI> who engag'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> under Sir <HI>Francis Drake.</HI> The Pulpit is very old, and of Stone; and in the Church-yard is a very old Stone Cross. From the Hill, on which the Town is situated, run Four weak Springs of different Qualities, which is the only Water they have to supply this large and populous Town.</P>
<P><HI>Walsal,</HI> East of <HI>Wolverhampton,</HI> is a good, pleasant Corporate-town, governed by a Mayor, and situate on the Top of an Hill. This Place is famous for Iron∣mines and Iron-works; such as Spurs, Bridle-bits, Stirrups, Buckles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in which there is a consider∣able Trade carried on.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="364"/>Upon the Extremity of the County, South, just on the Borders of <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> is situate upon a high Mountain, the famous antient Castle of <HI>Dudley,</HI> a Building of great Extent with Trenches about it, cut out of a Rock, and hath a high Tower upon it, on the South-side. It was built by <HI>Dodo</HI> a <HI>Saxon,</HI> in 700. Great Part of it is in Ruins, and the rest is converted into a noble Seat, where the Lord <HI>Dudley</HI> and <HI>Ward</HI> resides. The Castle over-tops all the Trees that surround it, and has a most extensive Prospect over Five Shires, and into part of <HI>Wales.</HI> In the Hall of this Castle is a Table all of one intire Plank, which, before it was fitted up there, was 25 Yards long, and 1 Yard in Breadth; but being too long for the Hall, 7 Yards and 9 Inches of it was cut off, and made a Table for the Hall of a neighbouring Gen∣tleman. What a prodigious Oak must this have been, that had a Length of 25 Yards, and a Diameter of one Yard from one End to the other!</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Dudley</HI> lies near it, but in <HI>Wor∣cestershire</HI>; and is only remarkable for being in a dif∣ferent County from the Castle.</P>
<P>The People in this County have been more par∣ticularly famous than any other for good Footman∣ship; and there have been, and still are among them, some of the fleetest Runners in <HI>England</HI>; which must be owing to their exercising themselves to it from their Childhood; for running Foot-races seems to be the general Sport or Diversion of the Country.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Stafford</HI> we saw <HI>Ingestre,</HI> where the late <HI>Walter Chetwynd,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> built, or rather rebuilt, a very fine Church at his own Charge, and where the late Lord <HI>Chetwynd</HI> has, with a Profusion of Expence, laid out the finest Park and Gardens that are in this Part of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I am now at the utmost Extent of my proposed Limits for this Circuit; for <HI>Ingestre</HI> Parks reach to
<PB N="352" REF="365"/>
the very Banks of the <HI>Trent.</HI> So I turn'd to the Right, and intending for <HI>Litchfield,</HI> in the Way we saw <HI>Beaudesert,</HI> a famous old Seat, said to be built by <HI>Hugh Lupus,</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester.</HI> The Name indeed intimates it to be of <HI>Norman</HI> or <HI>French</HI> Original; at present it is in the noble Family of <HI>Paget,</HI> Earl of <HI>Uxbridge,</HI> who is styled Baron of <HI>Beaudesert.</HI> The Park is very fine, and its Situation exceeding pleasant, but the House is antient. In the Park is a famous Piece of Antiquity, <HI>viz.</HI> a large Camp or Fortifi∣cation, surrounded with a double Trench, very large and deep.</P>
<P>From hence 'tis about four or five Miles to the City of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> the principal, next to <HI>Chester,</HI> of all the North-west Part of <HI>England</HI>; nor indeed is there any other, but this and <HI>Coventry,</HI> in the whole Road from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Carlisle,</HI> which is on the Edge of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Rugely,</HI> which is an handsome well-built Town, finely situated near the <HI>Trent,</HI> we came into the great <HI>Lancashire</HI> and <HI>Cheshire</HI> Road, or the North-west Road from <HI>London,</HI> which passing through this City from <HI>Warrington-bridge</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> falls into the <HI>Watling-street,</HI> mention'd before, about Three Miles South-east from the Town, and crosses another an∣tient Causeway or Road, call'd <HI>Icknild-street,</HI> about a Mile out of the City; so that <HI>Litchfield</HI> lies, as it were, at the joining of all those great Roads. But instead of going directly to <HI>Litchfield,</HI> we struck out of the Road, and went North-east to <HI>Bromley,</HI> a pretty Market-town; and from thence East to <HI>Tutbury</HI> on the Skirts of <HI>Derbyshire:</HI> It has a small Market-town with a Castle in it.</P>
<P>Some Miles Southward stands <HI>Burton upon Trent,</HI> where the Clothing-trade is carried on with great Advantage. It is famous for its noble Bridge over the <HI>Trent,</HI> consisting of 34 Arches, and of the Length
<PB N="353" REF="366"/>
of 515 Yards. It is built of Free-stone cut and squared.</P>
<P>From hence we returned South-west to <HI>Litchfield,</HI> which is a fine, neat, well-built, and pretty large City. It rose from the Ruins of the <HI>Roman Eto∣cetum</HI> a Mile off, now called <HI>Chesterfield-wall,</HI> from some Reliques of its Fortifications. There is a kind of slow, sluggish Water which runs, or rather glides heavily, thro' it, and so on for Four or Five Miles farther into the <HI>Trent,</HI> but takes a swifter Motion as soon as it is out of the Town. This Water parts the City into Two: one Part is call'd the Town, and the other the Close; in the first is the Market-place, a fine School, and a very handsome Hospital well endow'd. This Part is much the largest and most populous: but the other is the fairest, has the best Buildings in it, and, among the rest, the Cathedral Church, one of the finest and most beautiful in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There are Two fine Causeways, which join the City and the Close, with Sluices to let the Water pass; but those were cut thro' in the Time of the late intestine Wars in <HI>England</HI>; and the Close, which is wall'd about, and was then fortify'd for the King, was very strong, and stood out several Attacks against <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Men, and was not at last taken without great Loss of Blood on both Sides, being gallantly defended, and at last taken by Storm.</P>
<P>There are in the Close, besides the Houses of the Clergy Residentiaries, a great many very well-built, and well-inhabited Houses, which made <HI>Litchfield</HI> a Place of good Company, above all the Towns in this or the neighbouring Counties of <HI>Warwickshire</HI> or <HI>Derbyshire.</HI></P>
<P>The See is very antient, and was once Archiepi∣scopal, made so by King <HI>Offa</HI>; and <HI>Eadulph</HI> the Archbishop was Metropolitan of all the Kingdom of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> and <HI>East-Angles</HI>; but it did not hold
<PB N="354" REF="367"/>
it; then it suffer'd another Diminution, by having the See of <HI>Chester</HI> taken away, which was once Part of this.</P>
<P>They told us here a long Story of St. <HI>Chad,</HI> for∣merly Bishop of this Church, and how he liv'd an Eremitical Life here, by the Spring near <HI>Stow</HI> Church, in a little Hovel or Cell. But the Bishops, since that Time, fare better, and make shift with a very fine Palace in the Close, and the Residentiaries live in Proportion to them.</P>
<P>They have another Legendary Story also at <HI>Litch∣field</HI>; namely, that a thousand poor People, being instructed in the Christian Faith by the Care of <HI>Offa</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> were all martyr'd here in one Field by the <HI>Pagans</HI>; and that in the Field where they were so murder'd, King <HI>Oswy</HI> of <HI>Northumber∣land</HI> caused a great Church to be built; and from thence the City bears for its Device an open Field, with mangled Carcasses lying dispers'd about in it, as if murder'd, and left unburied.</P>
<P>The Church, for the Elegancy and Regularity of the Building, may be esteemed one of the most com∣plete in <HI>England.</HI> The West-end is richly decorated with the Statues of all the Kings who reigned in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> from <HI>David</HI> to the Captivity. But it is too flat, and wants Projection, or, as Architects call it, <HI>Relief,</HI> to give it Boldness. The Two Towers are much too low for their Breadth, and look very heavy for want of Windows, especially where the Bells hang. The circular Stair-cases projecting octa∣gonally at one Angle only of each, without any of the other Three Angles answering, is a great Irre∣gularity. But the Spires above them are carried up in an exceeding beautiful Taste, much beyond any other <HI>Gothick</HI> Spires that I have seen. The middle Tower and Spire of this Church are much higher than those at the West-end, and are equally beau∣tiful.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="368"/>The Spire designed for the Middle of <HI>Westmin∣ster-Abbey,</HI> is an Imitation of the middle Spire of this Church.</P>
<P>The great Window over the middle Door is very large, and its Pediment finely adorn'd, a large Cross finishing the Top of it.</P>
<P>The Imagery and carv'd Work on the Front, as above, suffer'd much in the late unhappy Times; and they told us, the Cross over the West Window was frequently shot at by the rude Soldiers; but that they could not shoot it down.</P>
<P>The Saints of those Days also intirely ruin'd all the Ornaments of the Inside, with the Brass Inscrip∣tions, Tombs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is built in the midst of a Bog for Security, and held out some fierce Attacks for King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and what the Outside suffer'd, has been very well repair'd since the Restoration, as well by the famous Bishop <HI>Hacket,</HI> as by the Bounty of several noble and generous Benefactors.</P>
<P>The <HI>Monasticon</HI> makes Mention of a Shrine given here for the Holy St. <HI>Chad,</HI> or St. <HI>Cedda,</HI> which cost 200,000<HI>l.</HI> but I conceive that to smell as much of the Legend, as the Miracles of St. <HI>Chad</HI> himself; since such a Gift at that Time must be equal to Two Millions of our Money.</P>
<P>Antient Camps are found in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Litchfield.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Litchfield</HI> we came to <HI>Tamworth,</HI> a fine plea∣sant trading Town, eminent for good Ale, and good Company, of the middling Sort; and also for a fine Charity of the famous Bookseller, Mr. <HI>Guy,</HI> who built and endow'd the noble Hospital in <HI>Southwark,</HI> called by his Name. The Town stands on the River <HI>Tame,</HI> which runs through it, and divides it into Two Parts, one Part whereof is in this County, and the other in <HI>Warwickshire.</HI> It is a Bailiwick Town, and a Place of good Account, tho' it has been much more considerable. Here was antiently a Palace of

the <HI>Mercian</HI> Kings, and there is still remaining a square Trench, call'd the King's Dyke. This Town was given by the Conqueror to the <HI>Marmyons,</HI> who built the Castle here, and were hereditary Cham∣pions of <HI>England,</HI> from whom that Office descended to the <HI>Dymokes</HI> of <HI>Lincolnshire.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Tamworth</HI> we came to <HI>Sutton-Colefield,</HI> a little Town situated in an excellent Air, and among pleasant Woods, tho' but in a barren Soil; and then we came into the great Road again at <HI>Coleshill</HI> in <HI>War∣wickshire,</HI> a small, but very handsome Market-town; from whence we came to <HI>Coventry,</HI> the Sister City to <HI>Litchfield,</HI> and join'd in the Title of See, which was for some little Time seated here, but afterwards return'd to <HI>Litchfield.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Coventry</HI> is a City of large Extent and populous, and drives a very great Trade: the Manufacture of Tammies is their chief Imploy, and next to that, weaving of Ribbons of the meanest kind, chiefly black. The Buildings are very old, and in some Places very much decayed; the Timber-built Houses project forwards into the Street towards one another, insomuch that in the narrow Streets they almost touch at the Top; a Method of Building formerly much practised in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The Tale of the Lady <HI>Godiva,</HI> who rode naked thro' the High-Street of this City, to purchase its Exemption from oppressive Taxes, is held for so cer∣tain a Truth, that they will not have it question'd upon any Account whatsoever; and in Memory of it, the Inhabitants make a Procession yearly with a naked Figure of a Woman riding on Horse-back thro' the City; and the Picture of the poor Fellow who peep'd out of the Window to see her, is still kept up, looking out of a Garret in the High-Street of the City: but Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> says positively, nobody look'd at her at all. Two Parliaments have been held in this City, both remarkably denominated; one
<PB N="357" REF="370"/>
in the 6th of King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. called <HI>Parliamentum Indoctorum</HI>; the other in the 38th of King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. called <HI>Parliamentum Diabolicum,</HI> because of the At∣tainder pass'd in it against the House of <HI>York</HI> and its Partisans.</P>
<P>At the Restoration of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. the Walls and Towers of the City were demolish'd, by that Prince's Command, and only the Gates of it left standing; by which the Beauty and Strength of the rest may be guess'd at.</P>
<P>This City is a County incorporate of itself, and has a great many Towns within its Liberties, holds Pleas, and is govern'd by a Mayor, 10 Aldermen, and Sub-officers; but it had only Two Parish Churches, that of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> and the Church of <HI>St. Michael,</HI> which were unable to hold half the Inhabitants, till the Year 1734, when an Act passed for making the Church of <HI>Bablack</HI> in <HI>Coventry</HI> a Parish Church, and for appointing a District or Parish thereto, and for enabling the Master and Usher of the Free Grammar-school within the said City, to be the Rector and Lecturer of the said Parish Church, for all time to come. This is called in the Act the Parish Church of St. <HI>John the Baptist</HI> in the City of <HI>Coventry.</HI> Besides these Three Churches and Parishes, it has Four Steeples; and the Cross is notedly one of its greatest Ornaments. The Roads are kept well pav'd to it for a Mile round. Here is a good Free-school, founded by <HI>John Hales,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> by the Name of the School of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. the Master of which is to be, for the future, the Minister of the new Parish Church, as I have mentioned. It has a good Library; and there is also an Hospital for the Poor. But here is no Cathedral, as some have falsly said; neither is the great Church, so called, either Collegiate or Conventual; but only a Monastery or Priory.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="371"/>Yet this City contended a great while for thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Honour, but could not carry it. In King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.'s Time, the Priory being dissolv'd, the Church, which they would have call'd a Cathedral, was re∣duc'd to a private Parish Church, and continues so to this Day: 'tis also an Archdeaconry, and the Bishop is styled Bishop of <HI>Litchfield</HI> and <HI>Coventry.</HI></P>
<P>The Spire of the great Church is however very beautiful, and 100 Yards high. There is another good Church in the same Yard; the Cross, a fine <HI>Gothick</HI> Work, 66 Feet high; and in Niches are the Statues of several of the <HI>English</HI> Kings. At the South-end of the Town stands a tall Spire by itself, being what is left of the <HI>Grey Friers</HI> Conventual Church. The Town-house is worth seeing; the Windows of it are painted Glass, representing some of the old Kings, Earls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who have been Benefactors to the Town.</P>
<P>And a Copy of <HI>Latin</HI> Verses are there to be read, in Praise of their Royal Benefactors, in which are named the <HI>Edwards,</HI> the <HI>Henries,</HI> the Black Prince, Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and the great Earl of <HI>Leicester.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Coventry</HI> we could by no means pass the Town of <HI>Warwick,</HI> the Distance too being but about Six Miles, and a very pleasant Way on the Banks of the River <HI>Avon:</HI> 'Tis famous for being the Residence of the great <HI>Guy,</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> of whom Tra∣dition has deliver'd down to us so many hyperbolical Accounts, that it is hardly possible to distinguish his real Actions from what are fabulous. He flourished in the Reign of <HI>Athelstane,</HI> and decided the Fate of the Kingdom by Compact, in single Combat with <HI>Colbrond</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> a Man of gigantick Stature, whom he slew, and afterwards led a Hermit's Life, till his Death. They shew us here his Castle, his Helmet, his Sword, and tell abundance of things of
<PB N="359" REF="372"/>
him, which have some Appearance of History, tho' not much Authority to support them. So I leave that Part to the curious Searchers into Antiquity, who may consult Mr. <HI>Camden, Rous, Dugdale,</HI> and other Antiquaries on that Subject, who tell us the Castle was built before our Saviour's Time, and has been a Place of great Consideration ever since.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Warwick,</HI> it is really a fine Town, pleasantly situated on the Bank of the <HI>Avon,</HI> over which is a large and stately Bridge, the <HI>Avon</HI> being now grown a pretty large River. <HI>Warwick</HI> has suffer'd much from all Quarters. It was once destroy'd by the <HI>Picts</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI>; after which the famous <HI>Caractacus</HI> (who at the Head of the <HI>Silures</HI> oppos'd the <HI>Romans</HI> so long) rebuilt it, erecting there also a Palace for himself. Then the <HI>Romans</HI> under <HI>Ostorius,</HI> and after them the <HI>Saxons,</HI> greatly damaged it; and lastly, the ravaging <HI>Danes</HI> ruined it.</P>
<P>Tho' it was a Corporation by Prescription, yet it took a Charter from <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> and since from <HI>James</HI> I. and is now governed by a Bailiff, and 12 Burgesses. It has a handsome Stone-built Market-house upheld by Pillars; and here is a good Free-school, and a well-endow'd Hospital for decayed Gentlemen. Tho' it has been always accounted a handsome well-built Town, yet the Face of it is now quite alter'd and improv'd; for having been almost wholly reduc'd to a Heap of Rubbish, by a terrible Fire, which hap∣pen'd the Fifth Day of <HI>September</HI> 1694, by the mere Accident of a Spark being blown from a Stick, as it was carried cross a Lane, to the Damage of 96,000<HI>l.</HI> it was rebuilt by Act of Parliament, and that in so noble and beautiful a manner, that few Towns in <HI>England</HI> make so fine an Appearance.</P>
<P>The Church and lofty Tower is new-built, except the East-end, which is old, and very good Work. There are many fine Brass Monuments of the Earls of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and others; also one of the Earl of
<PB N="360" REF="373"/>
<HI>Essex,</HI> Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s unhappy Favourite; and many Chapels and Confessionaries. In the Chapter-house on the North-side is a Tomb of the Lord <HI>Brook.</HI> The Castle stands upon the River <HI>Avon</HI> on a solid Rock, from whose Bowels that and the whole Town may be said to have been dug. The Terrace of the Castle, like that of <HI>Windsor,</HI> overlooks a beautiful Country, and sees the <HI>Avon</HI> running at the Foot of the Precipice, from above 50 Feet per∣pendicular Height; for the solid Rock, from the Ri∣ver on which it stands, it 40 Feet high, but on the North-side it is even with the Town. The Build∣ing is old, but has been often repair'd and beautify'd; and 'tis now a very agreeable Structure both within and without. The Apartments are very nicely con∣trived, and the Communication of the remotest Parts of the Building, one with another, is so well pre∣serv'd by Galleries, and by the great Hall, which is very magnificent, that one finds no Irregularity in the whole Building, notwithstanding its antient Plan, as it was a Castle, built for Strength rather than a Palace to dwell in for Pleasure.</P>
<P>A Stone Bridge with a Dozen Arches is at the Castle; across is a Stone-work Dam, where the Water falls over it as a Cascade under the Castle Wall. It is fenc'd with a deep Mound, and strong embattled double Walls and lofty Towers. On one Side the Area is a very high Mount. There are good Apartments and Lodgings next the River, the Residence of the Lord <HI>Brook.</HI> The Priory, on the North-east of the Town overlooks a pleasant woody Vale. There are a great many curious original Pictures in the Castle, by <HI>Vandyke</HI> and other good Hands, of Kings, Queens, and other noble Person∣ages, both <HI>English</HI> and Foreign.</P>
<P>A Mile out of Town, on the Side of a Hill, is a pretty retired Cell, called <HI>Guy-cliff.</HI> In an old Chapel is <HI>Guy</HI>'s Statue, Eight Feet high. The
<PB N="361" REF="374"/>
Fence of the Court is intire Rock, in which are cut Stables and Out-houses. They shew'd us the rough Cave, where they say the famous <HI>Guy</HI> dy'd an Hermit.</P>
<P>While I was station'd, as I may say, at <HI>Warwick,</HI> I took a Turn about the Country, to view such Places of Note, as lay something out of my intended Rout. And first, passing a Rivulet, I came to the antient <HI>Tripontium,</HI> plac'd in a pleasant little Valley, the Sides of which are pretty steep. The Road on the opposite Hill looks perfectly like a Perspective-scene at the Theatre. This is a <HI>Roman</HI> Station, rightly plac'd at <HI>Dovebridge</HI> upon the <HI>Avon,</HI> running by <HI>Rugby</HI> to <HI>Warwick.</HI> The Stream here divides into two, with a Bridge over each. Upon one is a short Inscription in Stone, shewing the three Counties which repair it.</P>
<P>Near this Place, at <HI>Legers-Ashby</HI> in <HI>Northampton∣shire,</HI> has been an old Town, as they say, destroy'd by the <HI>Danes. Catesby,</HI> who hatch'd the Powder-plot, own'd the Town.</P>
<P>We went on to <HI>Daventry,</HI> a considerable Market-town, govern'd by a Mayor, Aldermen, Steward, and 12 Freemen. It lies on the great Road to <HI>Chester,</HI> and is consequently a great Thorough-fare, and well furnish'd with good Inns; for it subsists chiefly by the great Concourse of Travellers that pass that way. It lies also on the old <HI>Watling-street</HI> Way. The Road was turn'd to pass through the Town, and runs on to <HI>Dunsmore-heath,</HI> where it crosses the <HI>Fosse,</HI> and one Branch goes on to <HI>Coventry,</HI> and the other joins the <HI>Fosse,</HI> and goes on to a Place call'd <HI>High-cross,</HI> of which further anon, where it falls into the old <HI>Wat∣ling-street,</HI> and both meet again near <HI>Litchfield.</HI></P>
<P>It is a most pleasant Curiosity to observe the Course of these old famous Highways, the <HI>Ikenild</HI> Way, the <HI>Watling-street,</HI> and the <HI>Fosse</HI>; in which one sees so lively a Representatation of the antient <HI>British,</HI>
<PB N="362" REF="375"/>
<HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI> Governments, that one cannot help recalling those Times to the Imagination; and though I am confin'd to such narrow Limits in this Work, yet a Circuit or Tour thro' <HI>England</HI> would be very imperfect, if I should take no Notice of these Ways, seeing in tracing them we necessarily come to the principal Towns, either that are or have been in every County; and likewise in mentioning their Remains, we give some Account of them as in their present State, which falls directly in with my Design.</P>
<P>From <HI>Daventry</HI> we went a little out of the Road, to see a great Camp, call'd <HI>Burrow-hill,</HI> upon the North End of an Eminence, cover'd over with Fern and and Goss. Here used to be kept a Horse-race. They say this was a <HI>Danish</HI> Camp, and every thing hereabouts is attributed to the <HI>Danes,</HI> because of the neighbour∣ing <HI>Daventry,</HI> which they suppose to be built by them. The Road hereabouts too being overgrown with Daneweed, they fansy it sprung from the Blood of the <HI>Danes,</HI> slain in Battle; and that if upon a certain Day in the Year you cut it, it bleeds. Origi∣nally, it seems to have been <HI>Roman,</HI> but perhaps new-modell'd by the <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Norton</HI> Town Road a <HI>Cornu Ammonis</HI> lies neglected, too big to bring away.</P>
<P>At <HI>Weedon</HI> is shewn the Scite of King <HI>Wolfhere</HI>'s Palace; the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings of this Province residing here. The Pastures call'd, <HI>The Ashes</HI> are the <HI>Roman</HI> Camp. St. <HI>Werberg,</HI> Daughter of King <HI>Wolfhere,</HI> and Abbess to the Nunnery in this Place, had here a Chapel. Abundance of very fine Stone, and many <HI>Roman</HI> Coins, have been dug up. <HI>Weedon</HI> now contains two Parishes, and has been a Market-town.</P>
<P><HI>Towcester</HI> is a considerable Town between two Ri∣vulets, which encompass it almost round.</P>
<P><HI>Old Stretford</HI> stands on the opposite Side of the <HI>Owse</HI> to <HI>Stony-Stratford</HI>; in the Fields thereabouts are found many <HI>Roman</HI> Coins.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="376"/>A little North of the <HI>Horseshoe-inn</HI> stood Queen <HI>Eleanor</HI>'s Cross, which was pull'd down in the Civil Wars.</P>
<P>To the West of <HI>Stretford</HI> stands <HI>Whaddon-hall,</HI> upon very high Ground, affording a most beautiful Prospect. This Manor formerly belong'd to the Lords <HI>Grey</HI>; one of whom, a Knight of the Garter, is buried in the Church. Here is the original Picture of Dr. <HI>Willis,</HI> the Progenitor of the present Possessor, with many of his MSS. Letters, Consultations, Lectures, and other Works unpublish'd. The Poets <HI>Spencer</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Bucks</HI> honour'd this Place with their Residence. Still higher stands <HI>Stukely:</HI> The Church is very intire, tho' built before the Conquest, in the plain antient manner.</P>
<P>I now come to <HI>Northampton,</HI> the handsomest Town in all this Part of <HI>England</HI>; but here, as at <HI>Warwick,</HI> the Beauty of it is owing to its Disaster; for it was so effectually burnt down, that very few Houses were left standing; and, altho' the Fire began in the Day-time, the Flame spread itself with such Fury, and Speed, that they tell us, a Towns∣man being two Miles off, upon a Hill, on the South-side of the Town, saw the Fire at one End of it, just as it began; and before he could reach the Town, with all the Speed he could, the other End was in Flames also. 'Tis now finely rebuilt with Brick and Stone, and the Streets made spacious and wide. It has four Churches, two Hospitals, and a Charity-school well endow'd. The Market-place is square and spacious; the Assize-house is built after the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order. <HI>Allhallows</HI> Church is a pretty Edifice, with a Cupola, and a noble Portico, before it, of 8 lofty <HI>Ionick</HI> Columns. Upon the Ba∣lustrade is a Statue of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. It is situ∣ate on the River <HI>Nyne,</HI> over which there are two handsome Bridges, and is walled in; and on the West side are the Remains of an old Castle, upon an Emi∣nence.
<PB N="364" REF="377"/>
'Tis govern'd by a Mayor, two Bailiffs, a Recorder, <HI>&amp;c. All-Saints</HI> Church before-mention'd stands in a Centre, where four large spacious Streets terminate. The publick Buildings are esteem'd the finest that can be seen in any County-town in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> being all new-built. But that Writer took very little Notice of <HI>Northampton,</HI> or rather had never seen it, who told us of a Cathedral, a Chapter-house, and a Cloyster.</P>
<P>The great Inn called the <HI>George,</HI> at the Corner of the High-Street, looks more like a Palace than an Inn, and cost above 2000<HI>l.</HI> building; and so generous was the Owner, that, as we were told, when he had built it, he gave it to the Poor of the Town.</P>
<P>This is counted the Centre of all the Horse-Mar∣kets, and Horse-Fairs in <HI>England,</HI> there being here no less than four Fairs in a Year. And indeed <HI>North∣ampton</HI> is reckoned the Navel of <HI>England.</HI> Here they buy Horses of all Sorts, as well for the Saddle as for the Coach and Cart; and hither<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/>ll the Jockeys from <HI>London</HI> resort to purchase Horses.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Northampton</HI> is the antient Royal House of <HI>Holmeby,</HI> which was formerly in great Esteem, and by its Situation is capable of being made a truly Royal Palace. But the melancholy Reflection of the Imprisonment of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. in this House, and his being violently taken hence again by the Rebels, has cast a kind of Disgrace upon the Place, so that it has been forsaken. The House and Estate was purchas'd by the Duchess of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and be∣came Part of the Jointure which was settled on the Marchioness of <HI>Blandford.</HI> It is at present possessed by a Farmer, who has pull'd down Part of the Out-houses, and converted the remaining Part into Barns, Stables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>A little way off of <HI>Northampton</HI> is <HI>Naseby,</HI> where the bloody and fatal Battle was fought between the
<PB N="365" REF="378"/>
Royalists and Parliamentarians, upon a fine Plain, where at present stands a Wind-mill; and on it, are the Marks of several great Holes, where the Slain were buried; and near this is <HI>Guildsborough,</HI> so nam'd from a <HI>Roman</HI> Camp, of a square Form, and deep Ditch, called <HI>The Burrows.</HI></P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Towcester</HI> is of large Extent, and very populous; and having but one Parish Church, which is two Miles distant from the Hamlet of <HI>Al∣thorpe</HI> and <HI>Foxcoate,</HI> in which there was a Chapel of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase, but officiated in only once a Month, by the Vicar of <HI>Towcester,</HI> though 'tis computed there are 400 Souls in the said Hamlet, who in the Winter-time cannot attend Divine Service at <HI>Towcester</HI>; and several Benefactions having been given, in case the said Hamlet should be erected into a Parish: For all these Reasons, an Act passed, Sess. 1737. for making the Chapel in the Hamlet of <HI>Althorpe</HI> and <HI>Foxc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te</HI> a Parish Church, and for appointing a Di∣strict or Parish thereto; and, according to the Con∣dition of one of the Benefactions, enabling the Master of the Free Grammar-school, within the said Hamlet, to be Vicar of the new Parish Church.</P>
<P>The Seat of the Earl of <HI>Pomfret,</HI> near <HI>Towcester,</HI> is a stately Building, and stands pleasantly amidst good Plantations of Wood, Vista's, and fine Prospects. In the grand View to the back Front, beyond the Garden, is a large and long Canal. Several curious Pictures are in the House. But what inhances the Glory of this Seat is, the vast Number of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Marbles, Statues, Busto's, Bas-reliefs, Urns, Altars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Part of the invaluable Collection of the great Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> and which are worthy of a Journey through half the Globe to behold. The Hall is a fine lofty Room, and the great Stairs are painted in Fresco by Sir <HI>James Thornhill.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Towcester</HI> is a pretty Town of <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquity; through which, in a strait Line, runs the <HI>Watling-street.</HI>
<PB N="366" REF="379"/>
The Inhabitants of all Ages are here imploy'd in a silken Manufacture, and Lace-making. The Town consists of one long Street, and is almost intirely incompass'd with Water.</P>
<P>The House late the Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI>'s, at <HI>Al∣thorpe,</HI> now belonging to the Hon. <HI>John Spencer,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Brother to his Grace the present Duke of <HI>Marl∣borough,</HI> who is Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> has within these few Years changed its Face to much Advantage. This antient Seat was rebuilt with great Improvement, by <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> Grandfather to the pre∣sent Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>; and is particularly noted for a magnificent Gallery, furnish'd with a large Collection of curious Paintings, by the best Hands.</P>
<P>The Park is laid out and planted, after the Man∣ner of that at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and was design'd by <HI>Le Notre,</HI> the same Person who planted St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park, and <HI>Cassioberry</HI>; as also several other Parks and Gardens in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There is a noble Piece of Water here, on which is lately built a fine Vessel, completely equipp'd; as his Grace the Duke of <HI>Bedford</HI> has also at his Seat at <HI>Woburn-Abbey.</HI> There is likewise on this Water a fine <HI>Venetian</HI> Gondola, Canoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But this Water is situated too near the House, and occasions so great a Damp, that some of the Pictures in the Gallery are mildew'd thereby.</P>
<P>At a convenient Distance from the House, is lately built a handsome Square of Offices, and near these is a large Kitchen-Garden finely walled and planted, in which is a handsome Building, for the Residence of the Gardener, which is a Model of an <HI>Italian</HI> Villa.</P>
<P>From hence we went North towards <HI>Harborough,</HI> and in the Way, in the Midst of deep dismal Roads, the dirtiest and worst in all that Part of the Country, we saw <HI>Boughton,</HI> the noble Seat of the Duke of <HI>Montagu,</HI> a House built by the first Duke, very
<PB N="367" REF="380"/>
much after the Model of the Palace of <HI>Versailles</HI>; the treble Wings projecting and expanded, forming a Court or Space wider and wider, in proper Stades, answerable to the Wings, the Body of the House closing the whole View.</P>
<P>The Hall is a very noble Room; on the Ceiling is a Convocation of the Gods, admirably painted, as are many Suites of Rooms, Stair-cases, Galleries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> beside the great Number of Portraits and other curious Pictures. The Gardens contain 90 Acres, adorn'd with Statues, Flower-pots, Urns of Marble and Metal, many very large Basons, with Variety of Fountains playing, Aviaries, Reservoirs, Fish-ponds, Canals, Wildernesses, Terraces, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Cascade is very fine, and a whole River running thro' the Length of the Gardens, is diversify'd most agreeably to com∣plete its Beauty.</P>
<P>The Park is walled round with Brick, and so finely planted with Trees, and in such an excellent Order, that I saw nothing more beautiful, no not in <HI>Italy</HI> it∣self, except that the Walks of Trees were not Orange and Lemon, and Citron, as it is in <HI>Naples,</HI> and the <HI>Abruzzo,</HI> and other Southern Parts of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>A Mile off is <HI>Geddington,</HI> where, in a Trivium, stands one of the Stone Crosses, built by King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> I. in Memory of his Queen <HI>Eleanor.</HI> These are said to be the Places where the Corps of that Princess rested, and Crosses erected, <HI>viz. Lincoln, Newark, Leicester, Geddington, Northampton, Stony-Strat∣ford, Dunstable, St. Albans, Waltham, Cheapside, Charing-cross.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Willoughby</HI> Side of the Road is an Hillock, call'd <HI>Cross-hill,</HI> where the Country-people observe an anniversary Festival. <HI>Willoughby</HI> Brook plays in delightful Meanders along a Valley between Corn∣fields, with a moderate Water, unless raised by Rains. Here several brass and silver Coins have been found, and some of Gold. The People have a Notion of
<PB N="368" REF="381"/>
great Riches being hid under-ground; and there is a vulgar Report, that under one <HI>Balk</HI> or <HI>Mere,</HI> that is, Division, between the ploughed Fields, there is as much Money, as would purchase the whole Lord∣ship; but they dare not dig, they pretend, for fear of Spirits. Mosaic Pavements, Coins, Pot-hooks, Fire-shovels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have been also found.</P>
<P>In <HI>Willoughby</HI> Town is an handsome Cross of one Stone, five Yards long. The Parliament Soldiers had ty'd Ropes about it to pull it down; but the Vicar quench'd their Zeal with some strong Beer, after having harangued them concerning its Innocence.</P>
<P>At <HI>Cossington,</HI> near the River <HI>Wrek,</HI> is a vast Bar∣row, 350 Feet long, 120 broad, 40 high, or near it, very handsomely work'd up on the Sides, and very steep. It is call'd <HI>Shipley-hill,</HI> from a great Captain of that Name, who, they say, was here buried. On the Top are several oblong doubled Trenches cut in the Turf, where the Lads and Lasses of the adjacent Villages meet on <HI>Easter-monday</HI> to recreate them∣selves with Cakes and Ale.</P>
<P>At <HI>Erdborough</HI> is a strong <HI>Roman</HI> Camp, 800 Feet long, of a delightful Prospect. Near it is a petrify∣ing Spring.</P>
<P>But I must not omit, as I had like to have done, the Town of <HI>Wellingborough</HI> in the County of <HI>North∣ampton.</HI></P>
<P>It was a large, well-built, and well-inhabited Town, with a fine Church, and Free-school. A dreadful Fire which happen'd here in <HI>July</HI> 1738, has made the Town still more beautiful, tho' the Occasion was too melancholy to be wish'd for. It began at a Dyer's House in the Town, about two in the After∣noon, and in the Space of Six Hours consumed near 220 Houses, besides Out-houses, Barns, Stables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> amounting in the Whole to upwards of 800, mostly in the South and East Parts of the Town. The Wind being high, and but little Water to be had,
<PB N="369" REF="382"/>
the Fire was so fierce and violent, that it seem'd to break out at twenty Places at once, and the Inha∣bitants were in such Confusion, that but few of them had Time to save any Goods, and many only the Cloaths on their Backs. As it happen'd chiefly among the Trading Men and Farmers, the Loss upon them was very heavy. But it was a good deal alle∣viated by the signal Charity of the neighbouring Gentlemen and others, which saved many of the poor Sufferers from perishing for Want.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>March,</HI> following this dreadful Fire, another happen'd at <HI>Findon,</HI> two Miles from <HI>Wellingborough,</HI> which consumed 16 Houses.</P>
<P>From <HI>Boughton</HI> we went on to <HI>Harborough,</HI> a good Market-town, and great Thorough-fare, in∣tending to go forward to <HI>Leicester</HI>; but Curiosity turn'd us West a little, to see an old Town call'd <HI>Lutterworth,</HI> famous for being the Birth-place of <HI>John Wickliff,</HI> the first Preacher of the Reformation in <HI>England,</HI> whose Disciples were afterwards called <HI>Lollards.</HI></P>
<P>The Church was lately beautify'd, and pav'd with a costly Pavement of chequer'd Stone; and the Pews are new, and every thing in it both in Church and Chancel, except the Pulpit, of thick Oak-Planks, six-square, which is preserv'd on account of its being <HI>Wickliff</HI>'s Pulpit.</P>
<P>Being thus got a little out of our Way, we turn'd West into the <HI>Watling-street</HI> Way, at <HI>High-cross,</HI> where the Foss crosses it, and which, I suppose, occasion'd the Name, leaving <HI>Rugby</HI> in <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> a small Town, noted only for a great Number of Butchers, on the South-west of us. At this Cross we seem'd to be in the Centre, and highest Ground of <HI>England</HI>; for from hence Rivers run every way. The <HI>Fosse</HI> went across the Back-side of our Inn, and so towards <HI>Bath.</HI> Here are divers <HI>Roman</HI> Antiqui∣ties:
<PB N="370" REF="383"/>
its antient Appellation was <HI>Benonis.</HI> The late Earl of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> and the Gentlemen in the Neigh∣bourhood, erected here a Cross of an handsome Design, but of mouldering Stone, thro' the Deceit of the Architect. It consists of four <HI>Dorick</HI> Columns, re∣garding the four Roads, with a gilded Globe and Cross at-top, upon a Sun-dial. On two Sides, be∣tween the four <HI>Tuscan</HI> Pillars, which compose a sort of Pedestal, are these Inscriptions:
<Q><HI>Vicinarum provinciarum, Vervicensis scilicet &amp; Lei∣cestrensis, ornamenta, proceres patriciique, auspiciis illustrissimi Basilii comitis de Denbigh, hanc columnam statuendam curaverunt, in gratam pa∣riter &amp; perpetuam memoriam Jani tandem a serenissima Anna clausi, A. D.</HI> M.DCC.XII.</Q> Thus translated:
<Q>The Noblemen and Gentry, Ornaments of the neighbouring Counties of <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>Leicester,</HI> at the Instances of the Right Honourable <HI>Basil</HI> Earl of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> have caused this Pillar to be erected, in grateful as well as perpetual Remembrance of Peace at length restored by her Majesty Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> in the Year of our Lord M.DCC.XII.</Q></P>
<P>The Inscription on the other Side runs thus:
<Q><HI>Si veterum Romanorum vestigia quaeras, hic cernas, viator. Hic enim celeberrimae illorum viae mili∣tares sese mutuo secantes ad extremos usque Bri∣tanniae limites pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>currunt: hic stativa sua habue∣runt Vennones; &amp; ad primum abhinc lapidem castra sua ad Stratam, &amp; ad Fossam tumulum, Claudius quidam cohortis praefectus habuisse vi∣detur.</HI></Q> Which may be thus rendered:
<Q>If, Traveller, you search for the Foot-steps of the antient <HI>Romans,</HI> here you may behold them. For
<PB N="371" REF="384"/>
here their most celebrated military Ways, crossing one another, extend to the utmost Boundaries of <HI>Britain:</HI> Here the <HI>Vennones</HI> kept their Quarters; and at the Distance of one Mile from hence, <HI>Claudius,</HI> a certain Commander of a Cohort, seems to have had a Camp towards the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Watling-street,</HI> simply call'd <HI>The Street,</HI> by way of Emi∣nence.</NOTE><HI>Street,</HI> and to∣wards the <HI>Fosse</HI> a Tomb.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Watling-street,</HI> measuring from <HI>Chester</HI> thro' <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Dover,</HI> makes a strait Line with <HI>Rome.</HI> Which seems to have been so contriv'd by the great Founders, that in travelling upon it they might have the Satisfaction of reflecting, that they were going upon the Line which led to the Capital of the Empire.</P>
<P>To proceed, we kept the Street-way till we came into the <HI>Leicester</HI> Road, which we followed East to <HI>Hinkley,</HI> a Market-town, situate on a Hill very pleasantly. This Town is noted for a large hand∣some Church, and a high Spire-Steeple all of Stone, in which is a Chime of excellent Bells.</P>
<P>From hence we turn'd North-west, and came to <HI>Nun-Eaton,</HI> an ordinary manufacturing Town, on the River <HI>Anker,</HI> and then Northward to <HI>Atherston</HI>; and so made a kind of serpentizing Tour of it along the Borders of the two Counties of <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>Leicester,</HI> sometimes in one and sometimes in the other.</P>
<P><HI>Atherston</HI> is a Market-town famous for a great Cheese-Fair, on the 8th of <HI>September,</HI> from whence the Cheese-Factors carry the vast Quantities of Cheese they buy to <HI>Sturbridge</HI> Fair, which begins about the same Time, but holds much longer; and here 'tis sold again for the Supply of the Counties of <HI>Essex, Suffolk,</HI> and <HI>Norfolk.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="385"/>A little North-west of <HI>Atherston</HI> stands <HI>Polesworth,</HI> formerly a Market-town; but since the Dissolution of a famous Nunnery, which was there, the Market was discontinued.</P>
<P>From <HI>Atherston</HI> we turn'd East again, into <HI>Leicester∣shire,</HI> to see <HI>Bosworth-field,</HI> famous for the great Battle which put an End to the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> III. and to the long and bloody Contention between the <HI>Red Rose</HI> and the <HI>White,</HI> or the two Royal Houses of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster</HI>; which, as Fame tells us, had cost the Lives of 11 Princes, 23 Earls and Dukes, 3000 Noblemen, Knights, and Gentlemen, and 200,000 of the common People. We view'd the Spot of Ground where the Battle was fought; and at the Town they shew'd us several Pieces of Swords, Heads of Lances, Barbs of Arrows, Pieces of Pole-Axes, and such-like Instruments of Death, which they said were found by the Country People in the several Grounds near the Place of Battle, as they had occasion to dig, or trench, or plough up the Ground.</P>
<P>Within three Miles of this Place is an antient Market-town, of the same Name, lying on a Hill, in a very healthy and pleasant Air. The Soil all round it is fruitful, both for Tillage and Pasture.</P>
<P>Hence I pass'd directly North to <HI>Ashby de la Zouch,</HI> on the Skirts of <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> a very pleasant Town, lying between two Parks. It consists but of one Street, in which stands a pretty Stone Cross; the Church is large and handsome, and 'tis famous for four good Horse-Fairs in the Year.</P>
<P>We then pass'd South-east into <HI>Leicestershire.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Stamford</HI> has a good old Hunting-seat on this Side of the Country, call'd <HI>Bradgate,</HI> and a fine Park at <HI>Grooby</HI>; but they were too much out of our Way: so we came on thro' a fine Forest to <HI>Leicester.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Leicester</HI> is an antient large and populous Town, containing five Parishes; 'tis the Capital of the County
<PB N="373" REF="386"/>
of that Name, and stands on the River <HI>Soar,</HI> which rises not far from <HI>High-cross,</HI> just mention'd: It is a Borough and Corporation Town, whereof the chief Magistrate is a Mayor, who is assisted by a Recorder, Aldermen, and Common-council. Here are three Markets weekly, well supply'd with Provisions. A considerable Manufacture is carry'd on here, and in several of the Market-towns around, for weaving of Stockens by Frames; and one would scarce think it possible so small an Article of Trade could imploy such Multitudes of People as it does; for the whole County seems to be busy'd in it: as also <HI>Notting∣ham</HI> and <HI>Derby,</HI> of which hereafter.</P>
<P>The County of <HI>Leicester</HI> is in part also taken up in Country Business, more particularly in breeding and feeding Cattle. Most of the Gentlemen are Grasiers, and in some Places the Grasiers are so rich, that they grow Gentlemen; 'tis not an uncommon thing for Grasiers here to rent Farms from 500<HI>l.</HI> to 2000<HI>l.</HI> a Year.</P>
<P>The Sheep bred in this County and <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> which joins to it, are, without Comparison, the lar∣gest, and bear not only the greatest Weight of Flesh on their Bones, but also the greatest Fleeces of Wool on their Backs, of any Sheep in <HI>England:</HI> and hence it is, that these Counties becomes vast Magazines of Wool for the rest of the Nation. Nor is the Wool less fine because of the great Quantity; but as 'tis the longest <HI>Staple,</HI> as the Clothiers call it, so it is the finest Wool in the whole Island, some few Places excepted; such as <HI>Leominster</HI> in <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> the South Downs in <HI>Sussex,</HI> and such little Places, where the Quantity is small and insignificant, compar'd to this Part of the Country; for the Sheep-breeding Country reaches from the River <HI>Anker,</HI> on the Bor∣der of <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> to the <HI>Humber,</HI> at the farthest End of <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> which is near 100 Miles in Length; and from the Bank of <HI>Trent,</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire</HI>
<PB N="374" REF="387"/>
and <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> to the Bank of <HI>Ouse,</HI> bordering on <HI>Bucks, Bedford, Cambridge,</HI> and <HI>Huntingdon</HI> Shires, above 60 Miles in Breadth.</P>
<P>These are the Funds of Sheep which furnish the City of <HI>London</HI> with their large Mutton, in such pro∣digious Quantities. There are indeed a few Sheep of a large Breed, which are brought up from <HI>Rom∣ney Marsh,</HI> and the adjoining low Grounds in <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Sussex</HI>; but they are few, and indeed scarce worth naming, compar'd to what are produc'd in these Counties.</P>
<P>The Horses bred, or rather fed here, are the largest in <HI>England,</HI> being generally the great black Coach and Dray-horses; of which so great a Number are continually sent up to <HI>London,</HI> that one would think so little a Spot as this of <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> could not possibly produce so many. But the adjoining Counties of <HI>Northampton</HI> and <HI>Bedford</HI> have of late come into the same Business. The chief Supply, however, is from this County, from whence the other Counties rather buy them, and feed them up as Jockeys and Chapmen, than breed them up from their Beginning.</P>
<P>In the South-west Part of the Country rise four considerable Second-rate Rivers, which run every one a directly contrary Course in a most remarkable Manner.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Avon,</HI> which runs by <HI>Rugby,</HI> and goes away to <HI>Warwick</HI> South-west.</P>
<P>Of this River the Poet elegantly sings:
<Q><L><HI>Yet rolling</HI> Avon <HI>still maintains its Stream,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Swell'd with the Glories of the</HI> Roman <HI>Name.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Strange Pow'r of Fate!</HI> Unshaken <HI>Moles must waste,</HI></L>
<L><HI>While Things that ever</HI> move, <HI>for ever</HI> last.</L></Q></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Soar,</HI> which runs by <HI>Leicester,</HI> and goes away to the <HI>Trent,</HI> North-west.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="375" REF="388"/>3. The <HI>Anker,</HI> which runs by <HI>Nun-Eaton,</HI> and goes away to <HI>Atherston,</HI> North; and so on to <HI>Tam∣worth,</HI> West.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Welland,</HI> which runs by <HI>Harborough,</HI> and goes away to <HI>Stamford,</HI> North-east.</P>
<P>I ought not to omit observing, that as the Town of <HI>Leicester</HI> was formerly very strong and well fortify'd, being advantageously situated for that Pur∣pose, the River covering it half way about, so it was again fortify'd in the late unhappy Wars, and being garison'd by the Parliament Forces, was assaulted by the Royalists, who, after an obstinate Defence, took it Sword in Hand, which occasion'd a terrible Slaugh∣ter. They preserve here a most remarkable Piece of Antiquity, being a Piece of <HI>Mosaick</HI> Work at the Bottom of a Cellar; 'tis the Story of <HI>Acteon,</HI> and his being kill'd by his own Hounds, wrought as a Pave∣ment, in a most exquisite Manner; the Stones are only of two Colours, White, and Brown, and very small.</P>
<P>The Castle here, before it was dismantled, was a prodigious Building. It was the Court of the great <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> who added to it 26 Acres of Ground; which he inclos'd with a very strong Wall of square Stone, 18 Feet high, and called it his <HI>Novum opus,</HI> vulgarly now the <HI>Newark,</HI> where the best Houses in or near <HI>Leicester</HI> are, and do still continue extra-parochial. The Hall and Kitchen of this Place remain still intire, as Testimonies of the Grandeur of the Whole; the former being so lofty and spacious, that the Courts of Justice, which in Assize-time are held there, are at such a Distance, as to give no Disturbance to one another. There are several Gate-ways to enter this Palace; and that which faces the East, has an Arch that is deemed a curious Piece of Architecture; over which in the Tower is kept the Magazine for the Militia of the County.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="389"/>Beneath this Castle was a very fair Collegiate Ho∣spital, in the Church whereof, <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Lan∣caster,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> his Son the first Duke of it, were bury'd; the Hospital was built by the Duke in his old Age, and appropriated for the Maintenance of 100 poor People, in which also he placed a Dean and twelve Canons, Prebendaries, with as many Vicars and other Ministers, and ten able Women to serve and assist the Poor and Weak. This, with Divine Service therein, doth in some measure still subsist by certain Stipends paid out of the Duchy of <HI>Lancaster.</HI> Another Hospital built by Sir <HI>William Wigston,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. is in a very flourish∣ing Condition there.</P>
<P><HI>Leicester</HI> is the <HI>Ratae Coritanorum</HI> of the <HI>Romans.</HI> The Trace of the <HI>Roman</HI> Wall is discoverable with∣out Difficulty, especially in the Gardens about <HI>Senvy∣gate,</HI> with a Ditch, which is very visible. This was repair'd by <HI>Edelfleda,</HI> a noble <HI>Saxon</HI> Lady, in the Year 914. The old Work call'd <HI>Jewry-wall</HI> is composed of Rag-stone, and <HI>Roman</HI> Brick.</P>
<P>Not far off is a Place call'd <HI>Holy-bones,</HI> where abundance of Bones of Oxen have been dug up, which were the Remains of the <HI>Roman</HI> Sacrifices.</P>
<P>At <HI>Leicester</HI> many <HI>Roman</HI> Coins are found; a Pot full of them was dug up at the Entrance into <HI>White∣friers.</HI> There are also many great Foundations. At St. <HI>Mary de Pree</HI>'s Abbey a Body was dug up, sup∣posed to be Cardinal <HI>Wolsey</HI>'s.</P>
<P>Since its Dissolution it has been made a Dwelling-house, which has nothing left but the naked Walls, and the Spot of the Abbey is turned into a Garden. The only thing worth seeing in it, is a pleasant Ter∣race-walk, supported by an embattled Wall, with Lunets hanging over the River, and shaded with Trees.</P>
<P>In the Time of the <HI>Saxons, St. Margaret</HI>'s Church was an episcopal See, and was very fine. Here, say some, King <HI>Richard</HI> III. was buried.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="390"/>Half a Mile Southward from <HI>Leicester,</HI> upon the Edge of the Meadows, is a long Ditch, call'd <HI>Raw∣dikes</HI>; on the Banks of which, according to Tradi∣tion, King <HI>Charles</HI> I. stood to behold the Storm of the Town. That Prince lay at the Vicarage-house at <HI>Elston.</HI></P>
<P>South-east of <HI>Leicester</HI> lies <HI>Billesden,</HI> a Market-town of no Note: and further South still, is <HI>Hallaton,</HI> another Town noted for its Poverty, in the midst of a rich Soil.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fosse-way</HI> leads from hence through the North-west Part of this County; but entering <HI>Nottingham∣shire,</HI> it inclines North-east, through the Vale of <HI>Belvoir,</HI> or, as it is commonly call'd, of <HI>Bever,</HI> to <HI>Newark.</HI> In all this long Tract, we pass through a rich and fertile Country, having in our Coast North-eastward the noble River <HI>Trent,</HI> for twenty Miles to∣gether, often in our View.</P>
<P>But some Miles North of <HI>Leicester</HI> the River <HI>Wrek,</HI> which comes from the North-east, and the <HI>Stour,</HI> which runs North-west, form a kind of Y; the <HI>Stour</HI> from <HI>Leicester</HI> Southward making the Tail. In the Course last-mentioned we passed through <HI>Montsorrel</HI> and <HI>Loughborough,</HI> both Market-towns, lying on the <HI>Fosse,</HI> which runs nearly parallel with the <HI>Stour,</HI> and makes one Side of the Y. The first is situate under a great Eminence, and has a good Stone Bridge over the <HI>Stour</HI>; and the other is seated among rich Meadow-ground, and is a fine agreeable Town. And on the <HI>Wrek,</HI> which makes the other Side of the Y, stand <HI>Melton Mowbray,</HI> a large well-built consider∣able Market-town, situate in a fertile Soil, almost sur∣rounded with a little River, call'd the <HI>Eye,</HI> over which it has two fine Bridges; and also <HI>Waltham on the Would,</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> on the Downs) which is but a mean Market-town.</P>
<P><HI>Belvoir-castle,</HI> standing within <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> but on the Edge of <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> is a truly noble Situa∣tion,
<PB N="378" REF="391"/>
tho' on a very high Precipice; 'tis the antient Seat of the Dukes of <HI>Rutland,</HI> a Family risen by just Degrees to an immense Height both of Honour and Wealth. I shall mention the House again in my Return out of <HI>Lincolnshire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bingham</HI> in <HI>Nottinghamshire</HI> lying in our Way to <HI>Newark,</HI> we pass'd through it. It is but a small Market-town, but is noted for a Parsonage of great Value.</P>
<P>At <HI>Newark</HI> one can hardly see, without Regret, the Ruins of that famous Castle, which through all the civil War in <HI>England,</HI> kept a strong Garison for the King to the last, and so cut off the greatest Pass into the North that is in the whole Kingdom; nor was it ever taken, 'till the King, press'd by the Calamity of his Affairs, put himself into the Hands of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, which lay before it, and then commanded the Governor to deliver it up; after which it was demolish'd, that the great Road might lie open and free; and it remains in Rubbish to this Day.</P>
<P>The Castle was built here by <HI>Alexander</HI> Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Stephen</HI>; and the Town took its Name from that New Work.</P>
<P>This Town was certainly rais'd from the neigh∣bouring <HI>Roman</HI> Cities, and has been wall'd about with their Remains. The Northern Gate is composed of Stones seemingly of a <HI>Roman</HI> Cut: and perhaps they had a Town here; for many Antiquities are found about it. Here are two fine Stone Crosses. A Gentleman, digging to plant some Tree by the <HI>Fosse</HI> Road Side, discover'd four Urns in a strait Line, and at equal Distances, in one of which was a brass <HI>Lar,</HI> or Houshold-God, an Inch and half long, but much consum'd by Rust.</P>
<P><HI>Newark</HI> is a very handsome well-built Town, situate on the <HI>Trent,</HI> under the Government of a Mayor and 12 Aldermen. The Market-place is a
<PB N="379" REF="392"/>
noble Square, and the Church is large and spacious, with a curious Spire, which, were not <HI>Grantham</HI> so near, might pass for the finest and highest in all this Part of <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Trent</HI> divides itself here, and makes an Island, and the Bridges lead just to the Foot of the Castle Wall; so that, while this Place was in the Hands of any Party, as I have before hinted, there was no Travelling but by their Leave; but all the Travelling into the North at that Time was by <HI>Nottingham</HI> Bridge.</P>
