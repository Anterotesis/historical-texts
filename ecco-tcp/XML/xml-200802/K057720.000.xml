<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY TWO GENTLEMEN.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>NOW, by my sanguine hopes, our author cries,</L>
<L>With expectation sparkling in her eyes,</L>
<L>There's nothing here should scare me that I see,</L>
<L>They all are saplings of the tough old tree:</L>
<L>Women, who wear Elysium in their look,</L>
<L>And men, unconquer'd as their native oak.</L>
<L>But yet a word or two I'll briefly say,</L>
<L>To prove we're right in naming of our play.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of human conduct, in each varied scene,</L>
<L>Th' extreme succeeds beyond the patient mean;</L>
<L>If eminence in rank our bosoms fire,</L>
<L>If merit to preferment dare aspire,</L>
<L>Follow the active, not the formal part,</L>
<L>"And snatch a grace beyond the rules of art."</L>
<L><PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
<HI>Bold Strokes,</HI> from bounding genius firmly struck,</L>
<L>Attract success, more than the turns of luck.</L>
<L>The bankrupt swindler, though to pay unable,</L>
<L>Oft mends his fortune by the E O table;</L>
<L>Or, failing there, he acts a braver part,</L>
<L>And takes a purse,<HI>—a Bold Stroke for the cart.</HI></L>
<L>The gamester too forgets each tender tie,</L>
<L>And ventures his last guinea on a die,</L>
<L>'Till ruin'd, and repenting of the evil,</L>
<L>He hangs himself<HI>—a Bold Stroke for the Devil.</HI></L>
<L>The fortune hunter sports a suit of lace,</L>
<L>In this a Count, a Lord in t'other place,</L>
<L>Success at length, begins his married life</L>
<L>At Gretna Green<HI>—a Bold Stroke for a Wife.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But are bold strokes to vicious men confin'd?</L>
<L>Does virtue lie inactive in the mind?</L>
<L>It cannot be, while England's genius breathes,</L>
<L>And many a brow is deck'd with laurel wreaths.</L>
<L>Bold strokes in war are England's greatest pride;</L>
<L>Think how a HOOD has liv'd, a MANNERS died!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our play holds forth the conquest of a heart,</L>
<L>By one bold stroke of nature, not of art.</L>
<L>A female pen calls female virtue forth,</L>
<L>And fairly shews to man her sex's worth.</L>
<L>Could men but see what female sense can do,</L>
<L>How apt their wit, their constancy—how true;</L>
<L><PB N="iii" REF="4"/>
In vain would rakes the married state revile,</L>
<L>Nor with the wanton, precious time beguile.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such is our aim, to rectify the age,</L>
<L>By bringing rising follies on the stage;</L>
<L>Be then propitious, let our fears decrease,</L>
<L>While you, with plaudits, ratify the peace!</L>

<P>HIST! Pedro! Pedro!</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> PEDRO.</STAGE>
<P>There he is: do'st see him? just turning by St. An∣tony in the corner. Now, do you tell him that your mistress is not at home; and if his jealous Donship should insist on searching the house, as he did yesterday, say that somebody is ill—the black has got a fever, or that—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PED.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho, pho, get you in. Don't I know that the duty of a iacquey in Madrid is to lie with a good grace? I have been studying it now for a whole week, and I'll defy Don or Devil to surprize me into a truth. Get you in, I say—here he comes.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PED.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lie!—Lie!—Signor!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must be a lie by your promptness in delivering it.—What a fool does your mistress trust!—A clever rascal would have waited my approach, and, delivering the message with easy coolness, deceived me<HI>—thou</HI> hast been on the watch, and runnest towards me with a face of stupid importance, bawling, that she may hear through the lettice how well thou obeyest her,<HI>—"Donna Laura is not at home, Sir."</HI></P>

<P>Hah! <STAGE>[seizes him]</STAGE> Now, Sir, your ears shall be longer, if you do not tell me who is with her in the grotto.</P>

<P>Oh!—why nobody, Sir—only the pretty young gentleman's valet, waiting for an answer to a letter he brought. There! I have saved my ears at the expence of my place. I have worn this fine coat but a week, and I shall be sent back to Segovia for not being able to lie, though I have been learning the art six days and nights.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well—come this way—if thou wilt promise to be faithful to me, I will not betray thee: nor at present enter the house.</P>

<P>By the honesty of my mother, I cannot tell, Sir. She calls him Florio;—that's his Christian name—his Heathen name I never heard.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must acquaint me when they are next together.</P>

<SPEAKER>PED.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir, if there should be any blood spilt!</P>

<P>I promise, I promise.</P>

<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, take that, <STAGE>[gives money]</STAGE> and if thou art faithful I'll treble it. Now go in, and be a good lad—and, d'ye hear?—you may tell lies to every body else, but remember you must always speak truth to me.</P>

<P>Fye, ladies! keep your curtains drawn so late! The sun is up—'tis time to look abroad— <STAGE>[tries to remove their veils]</STAGE> Nay, if you are determined on night and silence, I take my leave.

<SPEAKER>JULIO.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Returning]</STAGE>
<P>Don Carlos? Yes, by all the sober gods of matrimony!—Why, what business, goodman gravity, can'st thou have in Madrid—I understand you are <HI>married—</HI>quietly settled in your own pastures—father of a family, and the instructive companion of country vine dressers—ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis false, by heaven!—I have forsworn the country—left my family, and run away from my wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JULIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really! then matrimony has not totally de∣stroyed thy free will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis with difficulty I have preserv'd it though; for women, thou knowest, are most unreasonable beings! as soon as I had exhausted my stock of love tales, which, with management, lasted beyond the honey-moon, ma∣dam grew sullen,—I found home dull, and amused myself with the pretty peasants of the neighbourhood—Worse and worse!—we had nothing now but faintings, tears and hysterics for twenty-four honey-moons more.—So one morning I gave her in her sleep a farewell kiss, to com∣fort her when she should awake, and posted to Madrid; where, if it was not for the remembrance of the clog at my heel, I should bound o'er the regions of pleasure, with more spirit than a young Arabian on his mountains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JULIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you find this clog no hindrance in affairs of gallantry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not much.—In that house there—but, d—her, she's persidious!—in that house is a woman of beauty, with pretensions to character and fortune, who devoted herself to my passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JULIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>If she's persidious, give her to the winds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, but there <HI>is</HI> a rub, Julio, I have been a sool—a woman's sool!—In a state of intoxication, she wheedled me, or rather cheated me, out of a settlement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>JULIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho! is that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! but you know not its nature. A settle∣ment of lands that both honour and gratitude ought to have preserved sacred from such base alienation.—In short, if I cannot recover them, I am a ruined man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JULIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, this seems a worse clog than t'other—Poor Carlos! so bewiv'd and be—</P>

<P>Prithee have compassion.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter a Servant with a letter to Julio, he reads it, and then nods to the Servant, who exits.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>An appointment, I'll be sworn, by that air of mystery and satisfaction—come, be friendly, and com∣municate.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>JULIO.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Putting up the letter]</STAGE>
<P>You are married, Car∣los;—that's all I have to say—you are married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho, that's past long ago, and ought to be for∣gotten; but if a man does a foolish thing once, he'll hear of it all his life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JULIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, the time has been when thou might'st have been entrusted with such a dear secret,—when I might have opened the billet, and feasted thee with the sweet meandring strokes at the bottom, which form her name, when—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, 'tis from a woman then?</P>

<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Malicious dog!—Is she young?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Julio, if thou lov'st me!—Is it possible she can be so bewitching a creature?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JULIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis possible—though, to deal plainly, I never saw her; but I love my own pleasure so well, that I could fancy all that, and ten times more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>What star does she inhabit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JULIO.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Irradiate</HI> thou should'st have said, after such a description—but, faith, I know not; my orders are to be in waiting at seven, at the Prado.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prado!—hey!—gad! can't you take me with you? for though I have forsworn the sex myself, and have done with them for ever, yet I may be of use to <HI>you,</HI> you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JULIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, I can't see that—however, as you are a poor woe-begone <HI>married</HI> mortal, I'll have compassion, and suffer thee to come.</P>

<P>There, will that do? My lady sent me to make her up a nosegay; these orange flowers are deli∣cious, and this rose, how sweet!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho, what significs wearing sweets in her bosom, unless they would sweeten her manners?—'tis amazing you can be so much at your ease; one might think your lady's tongue was a lute, and her morning scolds an agreeable serenade.</P>

<SPEAKER>MIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>So they are—Custom you know. I have been used to her music now these two years, and I don't be∣lieve I could relish my breakfast without it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I would rather never break my fast, than do it on such terms. What a difference between your mistress and mine; Donna Victoria is as much too gentle, as her cousin is too harsh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, and you see what she gets by it; had she been more spirited, perhaps her husband would not have forsaken her;—men enlisted under the matrimonial ban∣ner, like those under the King's, would be often tempted to run away from their colours, if fear did not keep them in dread of desertion.</P>

<P>If making a husband <HI>afraid</HI> is the way to keep him faithful, I believe your lady will be the happiest wise in Spain.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GASP.</SPEAKER>
<P>But patience will bring it, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>'Tis false, sirrah.—Patience is a cheat, and the man that rank'd her with the cardinal virtues was a fool.—I have had patience at bed and board these three long years, but the comfort she promis'd, has never called in with a civil how d'ye.</P>

<P>Ay, Sir, but you know the poets say that the twin sister and companion of comfort is good humour.—Now if you would but drop that agreeable acidity, which is so conspicuous—</P>

<SPEAKER>CAES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let my daughter drop her perverse hu∣mour; 'tis a more certain bar to marriage than ugliness or folly; and will send me to my grave, at last, without male heirs. <STAGE>[crying.]</STAGE> How many have laid siege to her!

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GASP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, well—Troy held out but ten years—Let her once tell over her beads, <HI>unmarried,</HI> at five-and-twenty, and, my life upon it, she ends the rosary, with a hearty prayer for a good husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAES.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, d'ye expect me to wait till the horrors of old maidenism frighten her into civility? No, no;—I'll shut her up in a convent, marry myself, and have heirs in spite of her. There's my neighbour Don Vasquez's daugh∣ter, she is but nineteen—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GASP.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very step I was going to recommend, Sir. You are but a young gentleman of sixty-three, I take it; and a husband of sixty-three, who marries a wife of nine∣teen, will never want heirs, take my word for it.</P>

<P>What! do you joke, sirrah?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GASP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no, Sir—not if you are serious. I think it would be one of the pleasantest things in the world—Madam would throw a new life into the family; and when you are above stairs in the gout, Sir, the music of her concerts, and the spirit of her converzationes would reach your sick bed, and be a thousand times more com∣forting then flannels and panada.</P>

<SPEAKER>CAES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, I understand ye.—But this daugh∣ter of mine—I shall give her but two chances more.—Don Garcia and Don Vincentio will both be here to-day, and if she plays over the old game, I'll marry to-morrow morning, if I hang myself the next.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GASP.</SPEAKER>
<P>You decide right, Signor; at sixty-three the marriage noose and the hempen noose should always go together.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why, you dog you, do you suppose—There's Don Garcia—there he is, coming through the portico. Run to my daughter, and bid her remember what I have said to her.</P>

<P>She has had her lesson—but another memento mayn't be amiss—a young slut!—pretty, and witty, and rich—a match for a prince, and yet—but hist!—Not a word to my young man, if I can but keep him in ignorance 'till he is married, he must make the best of his bargain after∣wards, as other honest men have done before him.</P>

<P>Welcome, Don Garcia!—why you are rather before your time.</P>

<P>Gallantry forbid that I should not, when a fair lady is concern'd. Should Donna Olivia welcome me as frankly as you do, I shall think I have been tardy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAES.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you made your overtures, Signor, I un∣derstood it was from inclination to be allied to my family, not from a particular passion to my daughter. Have you ever seen her?</P>

<P>Ha, ha, ha! most doughty Don! pray let us see you in your feather and doublet; as a Cavaleiro, it seems, you are formidable. So suddenly to rob your husband of his charmer's heart! you must have us'd some witchery.</P>

<P>No, that's only the occasional gilding; but 'tis in vain to attempt a description of what changed its nature with every moment. I was now attentive—now gay—then tender—then careless.

<P>To rival him was not my first motive.

<P>Why, then, madam, I should say fortune had used you dev'lish scurvily, to give me a grey beard in a livery. I know well enough that some young ladies have given themselves to grey beards in a gilded coach, and others have run away with a handsome youth in worsted lace; they each had their apology; but if you run away with me—pardon me, madam, I could not stand the ridicule.</P>

<P>Oh, very well; but if you refuse to run away with me, will you do me another favour?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GASP.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Don Sancho, who, with two-thirds of a century in his face, affects the misdemeanors of youth; hides his baldness with amber locks, and com∣plains of the tooth-ache, to make you believe that the two rows of ivory he carries in his head, grew there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VICT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, you know him, I find; could you assume his character for an hour, and make love for him? you know it must be in the stile of King Roderigo the First.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GASP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hang it! I am rather too near his own age; to appear an old man with effect, one should not be above twenty; 'tis always so on the stage.</P>

<P>But it is not too late, and you shan't be re∣solv'd, I say. Indeed, now, I'll be upon my guard with the next Don—what's his name? not a trace of the Xan∣tippe lest.—I'll study to be charming.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>CAES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! that's too much t'other way; you're always either above the mark or below it; you must talk, but talk with good humour.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; and you shall see me as agreeable as the best of 'em, if you won't give me a mother-in-law to snub me, and set me tasks, and to take up all the fine apartments, and send up your poor little Livy to lodge next the stars.</P>

<P>Ha,—if thou wert but always thus soft and good-humour'd, no mother-in-law in Spain, though she brought the Castiles for her portion, should have power to snub thee. But, Livy, the trial's at hand, for at this moment do I expect Don Vincentio to visit you. He is but just returned from England, and, pro∣bably, has yet heard only of your beauty and fortune; I hope it is not from you he will learn the other part of your character.</P>

<P>Presto, presto, Signor! where is the Olivia?—not a moment to spare. I left off in all the fury of com∣position; minums and crotchets have been battling it through my head the whole day, and trying a semibreve in G sharp, has made me as flat as double F.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sharp and flat!—trying a semibreve!—oh—gad, Sir! I had like not to have understood you; but a semibreve is something of a demi-culverin, I take it; and you have been practising the art military.</P>

<P>Fond of it! devoted to it.—I compos'd a thing to-day in all the gusto of <HI>Sachini</HI> and the sweetness of <HI>Gluck.</HI> But this recrcant finger fails me in composing a passage in E, octave: if it does not gain more elastic vigour in a week, I shall be tempted to have it amputated, and supply the shake with a spring.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, that's a trifle in the road to reputation—to be talk'd of is the summum bonum of this life.—A young man of rank shou'd not glide through the world without a distinguish'd rage, or, as they call it in England—a hobby horse!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAES.</SPEAKER>
<P>A hobby horse!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>
<SPEAKER>VIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; that is, every man of figure determines on setting out in life, in that land of liberty, in what line to ruin himself; and that choice is called his <HI>hobby horse.</HI> One, makes the turf his scene of action—another drives about tall phaetons to peep into their neighbour's garret windows; and a third rides his hobby horse in parliament, where it jerks him sometimes on one side, and sometimes on the other; sometimes in, and sometimes out, 'till at length he is jerk'd out of his honesty, and his constituents out of their freedom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye!—Well, 'tis a wonder that with such sort of hobby horses as these they should still outride all the world to the goal of glory. I wish we had a few of 'em to jerk Spain into some consideration.</P>

<P>As other people do!—and yet you pretend to taste and singularity, ha! ha! ha!

<P>Pray tell me the name of that one: I am sure it must be the most elegant and captivating in the world.—I am impatient to know it.—We'll have no other instrument in Spain, and I will study to become its master, that I may woo you with its music. Charming Olivia! tell me, is it a harpsichord? a piano sorte? a pentachord? a harp?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You have it—you have it—a harp—yes, a Jew's harp, is to me the only instrument.—Are you not charm'd with the delightful h—u—m of its base! running on the ear like the distant rumble of a state coach?

<P>Piano, piano, good Sir! Spare yourself all farther trouble. Should the Princess of Guzzarat, and all her diamond mines, offer themselves, I wou'd not accept them in lieu of my band—a band that has half ruined me to collect.—I wou'd have allowed Donna Olivia a bloom∣ing garden in winter; I wou'd even have procur'd barren∣ness and snow for her in the dog-days;—but—to have my band insulted!—to have my knowledge in music slighted!—to be rous'd from all the energies of composition by the drone of a Jew's harp!

<P>Positively, Laura, you have these extrava∣gancies so often, I wonder my passion can stand them. To be plain, those violences in your temper may make a pretty relief in the flat of matrimony, child, but they do not suit that state of freedom which is necessary to <HI>my</HI> happiness.—It was by such destructive arts as these you cured Don Carlos of his love.</P>

<P>This is strange; you speak of your rival with the admiration of a mistress.</P>

<P>I never saw him nearer than from my Balcony, where he used to ogle me through a glass, suspended by a ribbon, like an order of knighthood; he is weak enough to fancy it gives him an air of distinction, ha, ha! But where can I find him? I must see him.</P>

Minette, ask no questions, but do as I order you—Receive Don Julio in my name; call yourself the heiress of Don Caesar, and on no account suffer him to believe that you are any thing else.</P>

<P>I am amaz'd and confus'd!—It is impossible that he can have discover'd me—Perhaps he comes with offers to my father—then my interview last night did not give him those impressions I hop'd.—I am jealous of myself.—If it is so, his <HI>incognito</HI> shall never pardon a passion for <HI>the daughter of Don Caesar.</HI></P>

<P>So! then, this is some new lover whom she is determined to disgust; and fancies that making me pass for her, will compleat it. Perhaps her ladyship may be mistaken, though.
<STAGE>[Looking thro' the wing]</STAGE>
Upon my word, a sweet man! Oh, lud, my heart beats with the very idea of his making love to me, even though he takes me for another—Stay, I think he sha'nt find me here—Standing in the middle of a room gives one's appearance no effect.—I'll enter upon him with an easy swim, or an engaging trip, or a—something that shall strike—the first glance is every thing.</P>

<P>A very courteous reception!—You honour me infinitely, Madam—I must apologize for wait∣ing on you without a better introduction—Don Vincentio promis'd to attend me, but a concert call'd him to another part of the town, at the moment I prepar'd to come hi∣ther.</P>

<P>A <HI>Jew's harp!</HI> Mercy! What do you think a person of my birth and figure, can have such fancies as that? No, Sir, I love siddles, French horns, tabors, and all the chearful, noisy instruments in the world.</P>

<P>My father, Don Caesar, won't let me purchase a ticket: I think it's very hard.</P>

<P>Pardon me, I think it's perfectly right.</P>

<P>Right! what to refuse me a trifling expence, that would procure me a great pleasure?</P>

<P>Yes, doubtless—The ladies are too fond of pleasure.—I think Don Caesar is exemplary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir, you'd think it very hard if you were me, to be lock'd up all your life, and know nothing of the world but what you cou'd catch through the bars of your balcony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JULIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps I might; but as a man, I am convinc'd 'tis right. Daughters and wives should be equally excluded those destructive haunts of dissipation.—Let them keep to their embroidery, nor ever presume to shew their faces but at their own fire sides.—This will bring out the Xan∣tippe, surely.</P>

<P>Well, Sir, I don't know—to be sure, home, as you say, is the sittest place for women.—For my part, I cou'd live for ever at home. I am determin'd he shall have his way—who knows what may happen.</P>

<P>I delight in nothing so much as in sitting by my father, and hearing his tales of old times—and I fancy, when I have a husband, I shall be more happy to sit and listen to his stories of present times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JULIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps your husband, fair lady, might not be
<PB N="64" REF="69"/>
inclined <HI>so</HI> to amuse you.—Men have a thousand delights that call them abroad; and probably your chief amuse∣ments wou'd be counting the hours of his absence, and giving a tear to each as it pass'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, he shou'd never see 'em, however. I wou'd always smile when <HI>he</HI> enter'd, and if he sound my eyes red, I'd say I had been weeping over the history of the unfortunate damsel, whose true love hung himself at sea, and appear'd to her afterwards in a wet jacket.—Sure this will do.</P>
<STAGE>[aside.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JULIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am every moment more astonish'd! Pray, Madam, permit me a question—Are you really—yet I cannot doubt it—are you really Donna Olivia, the daughter of Don Caesar, to whom Don Garcia and Don Vincentio, had lately the honour of paying their addresses?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Am I Donna Olivia! ha, ha, ha! what a ques∣tion! Pray, Sir is this my father's house?—are you Don Julio?</P>

<P>I beg your pardon; but, to confess, I had heard you describ'd as a lady who had not quite so much sweetness, and—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, what you had heard that I was a termagant, I suppose—'Tis all slander, Sir—There is not in Ma∣drid, though I say it, a sweeter temper than my own; and though I have refus'd a good many lovers, yet if one was to offer himself, that I cou'd like—</P>

<SPEAKER>JULIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>You wou'd take pity, and reward his passion. Lovely Donna Olivia, how charming is this frankness!—'tis a little odd, though!</P>
<STAGE>[aside.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I believe, I shou'd take pity, for it al∣ways seem'd to me to be very hard-hearted to be cruel to

<P>Yes, that you will not speak out, 'till we have had a little further conversation, which I'll take care to give you an opportunity for very soon.—He'll be here in a moment—Now, pray Don Julio, go—If he shou'd meet you, and ask who you are, you can say that you are—you may say that you came on a visit to my maid, you know.</P>

<P>I thank you, Madam— <STAGE>[aloud.]</STAGE>—for my dis∣mission— <STAGE>[aside.]</STAGE> I never was in such peril in my life.—I believe she has a license in her pocket, a priest in her closet, and the ceremony by heart.</P>

<P>And you likewise, <HI>I</HI> know that—Ha, ha ha!—The sair lady, so far from being a vixen, is the very essence of gentleness. To me, so much sweetness in a wife, wou'd be downright maukish—I like the little acer∣bities which flow from quick spirits, and a consciousness of power.—One may as well marry a looking-glass as a wo∣man who constantly reflects back one's own sentiments, and one's own whims.</P>

<P>Through fifty back lanes, a long garden, and a narrow stair-case, into a superb apartment—all that's in the regular way; as the Spanish women manage it, one intrigue is too much like another, whilst the sprightly dames of Paris have the art of giving the same intrigue every day a new air. Now, presently, in comes a stately dame with a veil on; she tells me, she fears I have but a slight opinion of her virtue; I make her an answer about her beauty, and, after a dozen or two entreaties and de∣nials, off comes her veil. A fat matron, perhaps of for∣ty—I swear she's a Hebe—she thinks me very obliging, and I find her very grateful; and this is the epitome of half the amours in Madrid. If it was not now and then for the little lively fillip of a jealous husband or brother, which obliges one to leap from a window, or crawl, like a cat, along the gutters, there would be no bearing the <HI>ennui.</HI> Ah! ah! but this promises novelty; <HI>[looking through the wing]</HI> a young girl and an old man—wife or daughter?

<L>In accents sweet,—"love, honour and obey."</L>
<L>Dear liberty, farewell! from babe to wife,</L>
<L>I've led a pretty, happy, checquer'd life;</L>
<L>I'll tell you how, the tale's not very long,</L>
<L>But, if you please, I'll give it you in song.</L>

<L>When I was a little baby,</L>
<L>Plump and round as may be,</L>
<L>For a lullaby</L>
<L>I'd fret and cry,</L>
<L>When I was a little baby.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But at six years old, how froward,</L>
<L>Naughty girl, untoward,</L>
<L>To dress my doll,</L>
<L>And prate like poll,</L>
<L>A naughty girl untoward.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At twelve, what a blooming flower!</L>
<L>Around me every hour</L>
<L>Butterflies gay,</L>
<L>To sip and play,</L>
<L>Flew round this blooming flower.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At sweet sixteen, so pretty,</L>
<L>All I said was witty;</L>
<L>A charming lass,</L>
<L>So said my glass,</L>
<L>At dear sixteen so pretty.</L>

<L>Love's dart no more to parry,</L>
<L>At twenty-two to marry,</L>
<L>To one dear youth</L>
<L>I plight my truth,</L>
<L>And that's the youth I'll marry.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With him I'll toy and play so,</L>
<L>He'll wonder why I stay so;</L>
<L>But your applause</L>
<L>Must crown my cause,</L>
<L>So clap your hands and say so.</L>
