<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By a FRIEND.</BYLINE>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. SMITH.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>TO lead attention thro' five acts of prose,</L>
<L>Where to soft notes no tuneful couplet flows,</L>
<L>To please each heart, each judgment, eye and ear,</L>
<L>The attempt how bold! the labour how severe!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus I address'd our bard; who quick reply'd</L>
<L>With honest diffidence, and modest pride:</L>
<L>" If I should fail, I shall not think it shame</L>
<L>" To miss what few have gain'd, the wreath of fame.</L>
<L>" This spot I deem the public treasury,</L>
<L>" Where wits, rare coins, for general service lye;</L>
<L>" Where critics, strict examiners, are plac'd</L>
<L>" To try each piece by that nice standard, taste;</L>
<L>" And what to public use may be apply'd,</L>
<L>" Is justly sav'd, what faulty, thrown aside.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Hence, 'tis the Poet's duty to dispense</L>
<L>" Each various vein of humour, wit, or sense;</L>
<L>" Not miser-like, to his own h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard confine</L>
<L>" The smallest spark of nature's genuine mine;</L>
<L>" But to the muse his grateful tribute pay,</L>
<L>" And in the common mint his quota lay."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On this resolve, he to your sterling store</L>
<L>Presents a specimen of untry'd ore;</L>
<L>If any worth it bears, assay'd by you,</L>
<L>His private talent is the public due;</L>
<L>And should it not disgrace your brilliant mass,</L>
<L>Give it your stamp, and let the metal pass.</L>

<P>MY compliments to the lady, and I will instantly attend her. Order James to bring the chariot to the door directly.</P>
<STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Servant.</STAGE>
<P>The more I think of this extraordinary summons, the more I am surpris'd at it. Emily Southern, my near relation, at an inn in London, and desires to see me!—I tremble for the cause; for though by no means infected with Spanish jealousy, I look upon it that the honour of every woman in my family, lessens or increases mine.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good-morrow, nephew, I am glad to see you up so early; I wonder how the folks, that lye a-bed, ever get through the business of the day; for my part, though I rise ever so soon, I am in a perfect hurry, from morning to night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shou'd imagine, sir, that a little regula∣rity might prevent your being so much embarrass'd.—Method makes all things easy.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's lucky.—Will you be so kind, my lord, as to take me along with you, as far as the Tower? There is a wharfinger there, who, I am told, is pos∣sess'd of an inestimable treasure: a Roman ring made of iron, which, for ought we know, might have be∣long'd to the mighty Julius himself.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, <STAGE>[<HI>to Mr.</HI> Belmont]</STAGE> the gentleman is be∣low, whom you desired to wait on you about the tulip roots: he says there is a cargo just arriv'd from Hol∣land, and if you don't make haste, the choice ones will be gone immediately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was ever man so unfortunate! Well, my lord, you see I can't wait on you, at present; but I beg you will not go to the wharfinger's alone, nor buy the ring till I see it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may depend upon me, sir: I shall not even go within a mile of the place; my engage∣ments lye another way.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's well, that's well; get me my cloak: no, get me a chair, I'll go directly to the man that has the macaw birds, and the cocatoo's, and buy me some of them immediately.</P>

<P>Not use spectacles, and near threescore! ha, ha, ha, very fine, indeed: but come, Thomas, get my cloak; I'll take a turn in the Park, and then to the Cocoa-tree, to hear the news of the day, and pe∣ruse the advertisements.—I have a world of business on my hands, that's certain.</P>

<STAGE>A chamber in an inn.</STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Emily.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>There lives not, surely, on this globe, a wretch so lost, so totally forlorn, as I am. In one sad moment depriv'd of friends and fame. But what are these to the sharp pangs that rend my tortur'd heart, for his unkindness, who should heal my grief, assert my innocence, and clear my fame? But he, alas! thinks meanly of me, and in that thought the measure of my sorrow is accomplish'd.—I am a wretch, indeed!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter a</HI> Servant.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ser.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, the gentleman you sent to is below, and desires to see you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shew him in— <STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Servant.]</STAGE> How shall I tell my story, how make my innocence appear?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Lord</HI> Belmont.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I am glad to see you any where, my dear Emily, this visit will evince; but, I confess, I am surpriz'd at meeting you in such a place as this, when I, who have the honour of being so nearly re∣lated to you, am master of a house in London. I think your billet said you were alone. I now ex∣pect you will explain this mystery, by other means than tears and blushes.—Pray speak, and clear my doubts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Innocence shou'd be bold, my lord; but maiden innocence is full of fear. Pray pardon my hesitation; I know not how, or where I shall begin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Recollect your spirits, and be assur'd you speak to one, who, to the utmost of his power, will prove a brother to you.—My sisters too, I'll answer for them, when once acquainted with your person and merit, will be your sisters also.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your kindness has encouraged me. Your lordship knows my mother died while I was yet an in∣fant, and that my father married soon again.—From that unhappy hour, I became an alien to his heart and person; under pretence of education, I was sent to school, where I received the honour of your lord∣ship's frequent and friendly visits, and remain'd there 'till about two years since.—Wou'd I had never left it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>The taunts, the cruelties I met at home, are not to be describ'd. 'Till about six weeks since, there was a match proposed to me, with the most detesta∣ble of men which I, prostrate at my father's feet, and bathing them with tears, refused.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>He cou'd not sure attempt to force your hand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every argument was used to persuade, every threat to terrify me, into compliance, but in vain. During this time of persecution, my father's ill health obliged him to visit Bath; I was permitted to attend him, upon promising to try to conquer my aversion to this hated marriage.—I promised any thing, to gain a respite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you describe your situation, I cannot blame you.—But was it aversion to the match pro∣posed, or prepossession for some other object, that ruled your will? I beg you will be sincere. Your blushes answer me.—But go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not mean, my lord, to hide a single thought; sincerity is the fair garb of virtue, and they who know no guilt, need no disguise. At Bath, I
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
met a gentleman, whom I had known at school, his sister was my friend and favourite there, and, in my childish days, he used to call himself my lover.—Even then I thought him, as sure he is this moment, the most amiable of his sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Emily, I begin to tremble for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>This gentleman renew'd his former courtship, if I may be allow'd the term, while my first impres∣sions recurr'd with added strength. He asked me of my father, who absolutely refus'd, and forbad me ever to see him more—cruel, inhuman sentence!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was indeed severe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I received a billet from him, requesting me to see him when the family were retired to rest. My father had ordered every thing to be got ready for leaving Bath next day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you, of course, consented to this last adieu?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>He came, and while he uttered the tenderest vows of everlasting love, we heard a noise in my closet, to which he flew, and, on forcing it open, to our mutual astonishment, a gentleman rushed out. My dear, deceived, unhappy lover, called on him to draw; and, casting a look of rage, mix'd with con∣tempt, at me, said, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Life is no longer worth my care, thy perfidy has made it hateful to me."</Q> I threw myself between their swords, and scream'd so loud, that it brought my father, and all the family, into the room. At sight of him, my terror and con∣fusion redoubled. I ran down stairs into the street, without knowing whither I went, or what to do. The night coach was setting off for London, at that moment; I got into it, without determining on any thing, but that I wou'd not return; and hither it has brought me.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter a</HI> Servant.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ser.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Charles Somerville has this moment alighted at the door, and seeing your lordship's
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
chariot there, begs leave to pay his respects to you.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quick, let me fly, my lord.</P>
<STAGE>[Runs to the door.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll meet him that way. Into this clo∣set; I will not suffer him to keep you long a prisoner.</P>
<STAGE>[She goes into the closet.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Sir</HI> Charles Somerville.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Welcome to London, my dear Charles; but to what happy chance are we indebted for your return? I understood that you meant to pass a philo∣sophical summer, at your seat in the west, in reading and retirement. But it grew dull, I suppose; it wou'd not do, Sir Charles; tho' you have not made a very long trial of it, I think, neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not indeed, my lord, made the smallest attempt towards the rational scheme you hint at. Thoughts of a very different nature have, for some time past, wholly occupied my mind, and left no room for any thing beside, but friendship, and Lord Belmont.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Belmont is much yours. But from this sententious speech, and that grave countenance, I think I may, without being a conjuror, pronounce, that the gay and lively Sir Charles Somerville is on the point of matrimony with some well-jointur'd widow, or rich heiress; and that he is, at this very moment, making an exact calculation of the fortune he shall allot to his seventh son, by, and of that mar∣riage lawfully begotten.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your lordship was never more mistaken.—So far from it, that I have bid adieu to the whole sex, and am determin'd to quit England, in a few days, with a firm purpose never to revisit it. <STAGE>[A loud sigh heard from the closet.]</STAGE> Ha! whence cou'd that sigh proceed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Charles, I beg a thousand pardons, but I must entreat you to withdraw immediately, and re∣quest the pleasure of meeting you at my house, in half an hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall obey your commands, but can scarce forgive your suffering my present intrusion.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Lord</HI> Belmont <HI>opens the closet.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Emily! She faints!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be not alarmed, my lord, the closeness of the place overcame my spirits; I shall recover soon: but is Sir Charles resolv'd then? does he leave England immediately? what have I said! I mean, my lord, is the gentleman quite gone? is there no fear of his re∣turning? one is apt to rave after fainting, you know, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is method in your madness, Emily; but tho' I dare say you did not mean to trust me with the name of your lover, be assured I am extremely pleas'd at discovering him in the person of my friend Sir Charles Somerville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is, indeed, my lord, the object of my hopes, and my despair; but to what purpose do I own my passion? he quits his native land, to fly from me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be patient, Emily—from his known cha∣racter of truth, and honour, I am certain he will do you justice; dare you abide that test?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most willingly, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>The way to hope for candour from Somer∣ville, the world, and me, is by a frank confession. Who was that gentleman he found concealed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all my hopes of candour from the world, of esteem from you, and love from Somerville, I know him not; nor why, or wherefore he came thi∣ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must believe you, Emily; there is a charm in truth, that strikes upon the mind, like light upon our eyes.—'Tis irresistible. Yet passion, I will grant, may cast a veil on either; I therefore can ex∣cuse Sir Charles for judging wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! blame him not, my lord, appearances were strong against me; but while we talk, he flies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your fears are those of love, but let them rest; and be assur'd he shall not break the double toil, that love and friendship spread to hold him fast. But come, my Emily, I am impatient 'till I place you in a fitter situation, and present you to my sisters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, my lord; think how improper it would be for me to appear in your house, or any where in my own character, 'till time shall have un∣ravell'd this cruel mystery. Scandal has as many wings as tongues, and in a few hours, I may expect to be the general subject of discourse, and object of reproach. Besides, you may suppose my father will pursue me, and, if under your roof, I must be dis∣cover'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your objections are just, and yet you can be no where so safe, as under my protection. Sup∣pose then you were to be introduc'd to my aunt and sis∣ters, who have never seen you, under a feign'd name and character, as the daughter of a clergyman, a particular friend of mine; they have often heard me speak of such a person, who has been some years dead, his name was Lawson.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I put myself under your lordships guidance, and shall assume whatever form you please, 'till heaven thinks fit to let me wear my own with honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you will not continue long in mas∣querade; but now, my dear, your hand.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear sister, let me dissuade you from carrying on this affair with Mr. Freeman any farther; if he really loves you, and his family and fortune may pretend to such a match, why not consult my brother? who has an undoubted right to be considered as a fa∣ther, from having acted on all occasions like one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>L. Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have very vulgar notions, sister; I suppose if you shou'd ever have a lover, you will bid him ask your parents whether you shall like him or not?—poor soul! but is it aunt Bridget, or uncle Frank, he shall apply to? ha, ha! Do you know, my dear, that as well as I love my Strephon, if he were to say one syllable about me to my grave brother, it is an hun∣dred to one, I shou'd detest him. Secrecy is the very essence of love, and like all other essences, it will eva∣porate, the moment it gets air.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry to differ so much in opinion with you, Louisa, but I can't help thinking that the most innocent correspondence, which can possibly sub∣sist between men and women, becomes in some de∣gree criminal, when it is carried on clandestinely; at least, it must appear as if one party was asham'd of the other, which you must allow to be a sentiment, by no means consistent with heroic love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>Read, read, my dear, and improve your∣self, for you are really very ignorant; did you ever hear of a heroine, in tragedy, or romance, who con∣sulted any third person, in the disposal of her heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't say I have read many of either; but to such over-weening confidence in ourselves, I believe we are indebted for many tragical subjects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>A truce! a truce! dear girl; and for this once, assist me. It is impossible I can refuse to see him this evening, when he so ardently intreats it; in your grave mathematical calculation, he has been ab∣sent three weeks, but that, you know, is three thou∣sand years, in a lover's calendar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Louisa, I will, tho' against my judgment, to the utmost of my power, assist you; but if my lord should pass the evening at home, I cannot guess how it is possible, without alarming him; or, what is much worse, making confidants of the servants, to effect your purpose.</P>

<P>Your servant, ladies—what, at work? you are a most indefatigable creature, niece Mary, and sometimes remind me of those industrious maid∣ens, that work'd beds and hangings, as I have heard my grandmother say; for those mechanical amuse∣ments were entirely out of fashion, before my youth was capable of instruction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your ladyship has given up your time to more abstruse and difficult employments, the study of the learned languages; but as every person may not have capacity, or inclination, to employ their minds in that way, I look upon works of fancy as pleasing and innocent amusements.</P>

<P>We have felt the loss of your lordship's company, who are generally so good to make yourself the master of our revels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Brid.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a bad phrase, niece; revels imply revelling, which is a term indecent for so young a lady to make use of. I declare, I was turned of twen∣ty, before I cou'd be prevail'd on to pronounce the word jollity; and then it was at the earnest intreaty of poor dear Mr. Feeble, that I wou'd give it utter∣ance. It was a dying request, for he expired of a galloping consumption, in a few hours after I had granted his desire.</P>

<P>There are some very odd whims come in∣to my head about this girl, sister; she is quite a beauty, nay, seems accomplish'd too; a clergyman's daughter! that's the old story. But in short, Maria, I begin to think this wise brother of ours has his failings, like other men, and growing indolent, as they all do, chuses to bring his favourites near home: did you observe with what an enquiring eye he looked at you? He thought he might easily impose on poor aunt Bridget and me, but he is mistaken. Was this his fine present?</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame, Louisa, how can you think so badly of a man who has deserv'd so well? Left to his care, even from our earliest years, what tender∣ness, what delicacy has he not shewn, both to our sex and age?</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter Lord</HI> Belmont <HI>and Sir</HI> Charles Somerville.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Have now, my lord, frankly related to you all the circumstances of this extra∣ordinary novel, except the lady's name, which I hope, for her sake, will ever remain a secret. What the denoüement will be on her part, I cannot guess, but am determin'd it shall not conclude in the usual stile with me; for, from this hour, I disclaim all future thoughts of a serious connection with any of the sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible, Sir Charles, that passion can so far triumph over reason, as in one moment to de∣stroy the good opinion of a character, form'd on a long acquaintance? You say you knew the lady from her childhood?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Belmont, you have stated this argument quite wrong, it was not passion that tri∣umph'd over reason, but reason that subdued passion. I can now see, nay feel, what an abject wretch he must be, who trusts his happiness in a woman's pow∣er—damn'd, smiling mischiefs, all!—I will, hence∣forth, see, and admire the pretty baubles, as I wou'd a fine piece of china, but no more attribute worth and honour to them, than maleability to that; for if my Emily cou'd deceive, there is no truth in woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is mere common-place, Sir Charles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>By calling it common, my lord, you al∣low it the general sense of mankind, which is, no doubt, founded on experience. I am therefore de∣termined to profit by it, so far as to retain my free∣dom at least. I think I almost feel the shackles I might have worn, but for the old gentleman's refusal.—Oh! how I thank him!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps you misplace your gratitude. I am not yet sure that you are under any manner of ob∣ligation to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly the greatest, tho' his refusal then was daggers to my heart.—Fool that I was, I thought her what she seem'd, an angel; and, but for him, Ixion like, I had embrac'd a cloud. But why do I still talk, or think of her! she is not worth a thought, and I hope to get quite clear of her idea, before I reach Harwich.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, you deceive yourself; her form will haunt you, fly where'er you will, and for the same reason that murderers fancy ghosts—for I am persuad∣ed you have injur'd her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>What shall I not believe my eyes! by heaven, the consciousness of her guilt even conquer'd female fear; she threw herself upon a madman's sword, such I then was; but 'twas to save her lover, and my rival; ungrateful woman!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem inclin'd to lay hold of the dark side of every circumstance; but there is one you seem not yet to have attended to, or you cou'd not think of leaving England immediately. May not the gen∣tleman, you encounter'd in your mistress's chamber, possibly suppose you fled from him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>That thought had quite escap'd me. I left a servant behind, whom I expect this night, in order to discover who my rival was; and also to find out what her father had done, or meant to do, with his unworthy, yet too lovely daughter: I fear he will use her cruelly, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you think of that, and talk of quitting England?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, faith, my lord, I have always look'd upon chivalry as a very ridiculous science, and yet I begin to think it has its foundation in na∣ture, for I never yet heard of a damsel in distress, that I did not wish to relieve her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Charles, this affair is much too serious to jest with. You have asked my opinion, and, as a man of honour, and your friend, I now declare, I think your travelling scheme shou'd be entirely laid aside, until this mystery is properly explain'd. Not∣withstanding your affected gaiety, I am certain you still love this lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>There again, your lordship is guilty of a small error, only mistaking the past for the present tense; say I did love her, if you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir Charles, grant you no longer love, you are certainly a man of honour, and must therefore think it incumbent on you to clear a lady's character, which may possibly have suffered as much on your account, in the minds of others, as she has done in yours, from this unlucky accident.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wou'd to heaven that I cou'd clear her to my own heart, from all suspicion, with as much justice, as I can to the world, of what relates to me; in her whole conduct and behaviour towards me, she was purity herself, her soul seem'd even lovelier than her form, and cast a kind of glory round her beauty, which, while it awed, transported, raised, and chastis'd desire—yet she is false!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot think so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir. Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be that as it may, your lordship has con∣vinc'd me that I shou'd not leave London for a few days; within that term, or never, a clue will certainly be found, to lead us thro' this maze; I therefore will abide the event; certain it can't be worse than what I fear.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must insist on your acquainting me with every step you take. You know you may command me on the most difficult occasions.</P>

<P>I certainly rely on your lordship's friend∣ship.</P>

<P>O Lady Bridget, sister, wou'd you believe it, I am cheated, impos'd upon, to the last degree. The man that sold me the blue-bird, with the scarlet head, has deceived me; it is only painted. He call'd it the true blue-bird of paradise, but he is the true serpent of it, and has bit me. Odso! I beg pardon, who is that pretty lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Brid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, brother, you seem to be verging towards the state of second childhood. You act directly like a baby, one moment purchasing toys, and the next weary of them.

<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Odso! she talks very handsomely, Lady Bridget; I have a great notion she is very learned. Pray, madam, do you understand coins?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for it, because if you did, I wou'd have treated you with a sight of my best Otho; it has the true green mold on it, and is so very antique,
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
that all traces of the figure are worn out, so that it looks for all the world like a bit of plain copper.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Brid.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, to be sure, it is. Pray, brother, don't expose yourself, and interrupt our conversation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, there it is now; you don't like to hear any one talk but yourself. Lady Bridget; but I won't hold my tongue, for all that. I'll go this moment, and fetch my Otho, and the lady shall be judge whether it is not a fine one; and if she says it is, I'll make her a present of it, to vex you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must beg to be excus'd, sir; I can by no means think of depriving you of a treasure, that wou'd be totally useless to me.</P>

<P><STAGE>[aside]</STAGE> I am afraid she is but filly.—Useless, madam! an Otho useless! I must beg pardon.</P>

<P>I only said it wou'd be so to me, sir, who am not a virtuoso, and want taste to know its value.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Brid.</SPEAKER>
<P>This absurd conversation is an outrage on my patience, which I can no longer submit to. Pray, brother, give me leave;—I should be glad to know, Miss Lawson, if your father bequeath'd you any an∣cient manuscripts, in the Hebrew, or Greek languages?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>O sister! dear Lady Bridget! let me enquire about them. Are they much worm-eaten? O! if I had them to present to the Society of Antiquarians, I shou'd be enroll'd among the literati, and be reckon'd a great man! Dear Miss, pray let me have them, I'll make you a present of all my birds, flowers, and shells, since you don't like antiques.</P>

<P>And so, Jack, you think, because I am in London, that I shall quietly return into the city, and occupy my old seat in the compting-house? but faith you are mistaken; business to attorneys and me∣chanics, for me; I fly at higher game; pleasure, my dear, pleasure is the business of my life, and the only business worth following, believe me.</P>

<P>These flights wou'd be ridiculous, even in a man of fortune, brother, but from you, they appear contemptible. You were bred to business, Harry, and a man who acts properly, in the station of life he was born to, is a much more estimable character, than a coxcomb, assuming the airs of a man of quality, without breeding, or fortune to sup∣port them. You really make a very absurd figure</P>

<P>The violence of your temper, Mr. Free∣man, has warped your understanding; there are other means, besides play, to make a fortune, which, since your plodding wisdom can't discover, I shall inform you of.—Suppose a lady of quality were to think my figure not quite so contemptible as you seem to do?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, sister, how you must be laugh'd at, shou'd you hint such an old-fashion'd notion among the Beau-monde.—Why there is scarce a man of quality, in England, who has not been violently in love with half a dozen fine women, at least, before he thinks of marrying; and if every one of them were to carry off but a corner of his heart, there cou'd scarce be an atom left for the poor lady, to whom he devotes his hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure if that was true, I shou'd have no more heart than a mummy; for I have suffer'd love, many and many a time, and yet I think that I am heart-whole still, and have as large a stock of love to dispose of as ever.</P>
</SP>

<P>You, very possibly, may have preserv'd your whole fund entire, sir; for it is my belief, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they never knew to love, who knew to change."</Q> Other passions, sometimes, assume its form, and impose even on ourselves.

<P>True, Miss Lawson; I will not blush to own that I am a fatal illustration of this sentiment; the redundancy of my regards for Mr. Feeble, even in the tomb, shall ever make me decline marri∣age.—To his memory have I consecrated my virgin bloom.</P>

<P>The delicacy of my sentiments, brother, forbad a promulgation of my passion; tho' some years are elapsed, since the dear object was no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that there has, I'll be sworn.—'Tis at least five-and-twenty years, since poor Feeble depart∣ed, and he was dying for seven years before.—There's a fine antique, nephew; there's a true gem, my lord.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Bel</SPEAKER>
<P>He, like many others, mistakes a passion for science, for the knowledge of it, and is, therefore, for ever liable to imposition. But we have all our failings, and let his pass. I think, Louisa, you gave up your opinion too tamely, I was in hopes we should

<SPEAKER>L. Brid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Permit me, my lord, to bring this argu∣ment to a conclusion, by observing, that young la∣dies cannot expatiate on the thesis of love, without giving an intimation that they are adepts in the science; which would be rather an oppribrium, than an honour to persons not yet adult.

<P>Where can she have fled, my dear, un∣happy Emily? But wherefore do I call her mine?

<P>Not blame you, sir! but I will yet have patience—such mean, clandestine doings, are unwor∣thy of your birth. You wrung my story from me,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Charles, this is a language I am not us'd to hear; but lovers, like lunatics, have leave to rail, when the mad fit is on them: I think her inno∣cent, and will defend her.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>You think her innocent! you! the abet∣tor of her guilt; her lover's confidant!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not quite so placid as your lordship, I confess; you are the true French courtier, my tra∣vels are to come. Born and bred up a Briton, I may be rough, but am sincere—no flatterer, no false friend.</P>

<P>You may depend on me. But as that time or place will not admit of parley, I now con∣jure you to answer me one question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speak it, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I survive, it will be of some conse∣quence, if not, it will be buried with me. Who is the happy man, that both my mistress and my friend have sacrificed me to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Insolent man! how should I know the person?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>In vain you strive to hide him from me—were he ennobled with all the honours majesty can
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
give, he can't be rais'd above resentment; and were he sprung from the lowest of mankind, my Emily's love has dignified his meanness, and made him, in point of happiness at least, far my superior. There∣fore, again, I do intreat you tell me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is something very extraordinary in your persisting in a request, that is impossible for me to grant; for, by my honour, I do not know the man whom you suppose your mistress has preferr'd, nor ever heard his name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not know the person, whom I this very hour saw come out of your house, by the back-door that leads into your garden?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must mistake. Sir Charles, it cannot be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do I know you, am I awake, or in my senses? If these things are true, I surely saw him issue from your garden-door; his image is too strongly fix'd upon my wounded memory, to think I can mis∣take; the moon shone bright upon him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have amaz'd me, yet still I think it is impossible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Lord Belmont, if I have in∣jur'd you, by imagining you to be this unknown per∣son's friend, therefore no longer mine, what apology, what atonement can I make?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir Charles, you have wrong'd both truth and friendship; I never had a friend I dared to injure, or disclaim; yet, if it was not a vision that you saw, you are in some degree excuse∣able—yet, why shou'd he come here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is indeed a mystery—but as I cou'd not imagine he came to any one within these walls, except your lordship, I hope you'll pardon the frenzy of a man who thought himself aggriev'd in the most tender points, his love and friendship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Charles, your seeming motives for re∣sentment were so strong, that I can readily forget the effects—I hope we are friends again—but let the
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>
conviction of your present error lead you to doubt, at least, the certainty of some former appearances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, my too generous friend! let me be happy still in your esteem, but banish from my mind all thoughts of love. Her guilt is fully proved; she fled, that fatal night, from Bath, with her seducer. Curses blast him!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>What reason have you to think so?— <STAGE>[aside]</STAGE> 'Tis plain he does not know she's here, nor can I now inform him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>My servant is return'd, and brings this sad account; he left her poor unhappy father setting out in pursuit of—I cannot name her, my once lovely Emily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>In such a scene of complicated distress, may she not have fled for refuge to some friend? Why will you think the worst?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>O no, my lord, she had no friend to fly to; for sure he is the worst of foes, as well as vil∣lains, that wou'd destroy her innocence. I doubt not but the wretch may abandon her to want and infamy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot think that she is in his power. It is improbable that a well-educated maid shou'd take so rash a step, but on a certainty of marriage with the man she lov'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shou'd rejoice to think as you do; and were there but the slightest foundation for hope, wou'd gladly rest upon it. But all my doubts are at an end; I am therefore determined to quit England. but not 'till I have found the man, who has robbed me of my peace, and Emily. I'll go this moment in pursuit of him.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad to see you, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were but a child, my lord, when I left London, on the death of my first wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, sir, not to have been better known to so near a relation. Pray how does my cousin Emily? I used to visit her often, while she was at school.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is very well, my lord, and that's my greatest grief. If she had died with her mother, she wou'd have been happy, and so wou'd I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will pardon me, sir, but that thought seems so very unnatural.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, not at all, my lord; she has been a plague to me, ever since she was born; and my present lady, Mrs. Southerne, always said she wou'd be so. And Mrs. Southerne, let me tell your lord∣ship, is a parlous wise woman, and never was mista∣ken in her whole life; at least, I never thought her in the wrong, and therefore never contradicted her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="39" REF="43"/>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be sorry to think Mrs. Southerne never err'd in judgment, for then my cousin must have verified this infallible lady's prediction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so she has, my lord. I, like a careful father, as I was, and in regard to her poor mother's memory, provided a proper and convenient match for her; my neighbour Winterbottom, my lord, a man pretty near my own age, one that was fit to conduct and manage such a raw, headstrong chit, as she; a discreet person, let me tell you; and a great favourite of Mrs. Southerne's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cou'd not surely think of marrying my cousin to a person as old as her father, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not, why not, my lord, she made no objection to his years, but truly she dislik'd his fa∣mily and person, because he was not a fine smock-fac'd beau, and cou'd not trace his pedigree up to Adam, forsooth; a conceited undutiful minx as she was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot blame my cousin's spirit, sir; her birth, youth, and fortune, entitle her to a very dif∣ferent match; but were she a beggar, sir, she had better serve, to earn her bread, than wed the man she hates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very fine, my lord; but stay 'till you hear the end of that high spirit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever her conduct may have been, sir, I fear yours towards her, has justified it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I was too tender of her; when she got into the pouts, and cry'd and roar'd, I promised not to force her to this marriage; but if she wou'd be a dutiful child, and consent to it, I wou'd take her with me to Bath; she promis'd she wou'd try to obey me, and, in an ill hour, to Bath I brought her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And there, I suppose, she married the first man that ask'd her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>Worse, much worse than that: she sent a fine spark, a baronet, I think he was, to ask her for his wife, tho' she knew very well, that Mrs. Southerne
<PB N="40" REF="44"/>
had pass'd her word she shou'd marry Winterbottom; and did she think I wou'd make my lady a liar? No, no, I sent him a packing, and order'd madam to prepare for Southerne-hall directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I not presume to say, sir, that this proceeding was too violent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray don't interrupt me, my lord, and you shall hear how this gentle lady behaved.—About eleven that night, when I was smoking my pipe, I heard her squall; I ran into her chamber, and there I found the knight, and another of her lovers, I sup∣pose, tilting at each other; I beat down their passes with my crutch, the candle fell to the ground, and before the servants could bring light, madam and all were fled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you heard nothing of her since?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a syllable, nor wou'd I ever have en∣quired about her, but that my lady's honour is en∣gaged to Winterbottom. Now, if you can assist me to discover where she is, I'll bring a replevin for her, and carry her home directly. If Winterbottom will marry her, so—if not, I'll keep her close enough to prevent her bringing any farther disgrace on me, while I live, I warrant you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you found out who the gentleman was, who fought with the baronet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, her maid Sally, a forward young flirt, like her mistress, told the servants that his name was Freeman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[aside]</STAGE> Freeman! that's something gain'd—a thought occurs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I beg, my lord, that you will send out immediately to all the inns and lodging-houses about town, to look for Emily; my servants shall go one way, yours another, and I think we can't well miss of her; though London is hugely grown; since I was here, that's certain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may be sure, sir, that I shall take every proper method for the service of my cousin; but it is
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>
not by a replevin, that her character is to be reco∣vered, though her person may. You, as her father, sir, are first bound to do her justice; to call the man who has wrong'd her to a strict account, and make him clear her fame by instant marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! I call any one to account! I fight for her! Not I, truly. I am a civil magistrate, the law is my weapon, and if I can reclaim her by that, I will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what are we to do, sir, with the fair fugitive, when we have recovered her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even what your lordship pleases; you shall be heartily welcome to dispose of her to whom you will for me. Try if you can make a match for her, suited to her birth and youth, since you don't ap∣prove of that I had proposed. But not a penny will I give to buy her a fop, or a coxcomb, or a title; yet if either of those fellows she went off with, will marry her without money, why I'll e'en give my con∣sent, that I may he no longer plagu'd with her; tho' I am very much afraid that Mrs. Southerne will be angry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk, sir, as if your daughter were al∣ready found.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, my lord, if she shou'd never be found, I can't help it: but as I am come so far, I'll e'en stay in town 'till the horses are rested.—Poor things! they have not had such a journey this many a long year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, if you will leave the management of this affair to me, I'll act as if my cousin were my sister; but remember, sir, you have promis'd your consent to the baronet, if he shou'd again solicit it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, my lord, he shall have her, if he chuses to wait for her fortune 'till my death. I must now go smoke my pipe. In the morning I will call upon you, and pay my respects to Lady Bridget and my brother Belmont.</P>

<P>Our sentiments are so different, upon many subjects, that I am not surpriz'd they do not accord on this.

<SPEAKER>L. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll pardon me, Louisa, if I pronounce it much more indelicate for a young lady to receive the addresses of a lover privately, than if authorized by the approbation of her friends: in this case, her compliance might appear a condescension to their de∣sires; in the other, it looks too much like granting an indulgence to her own.</P>

<P>Doubtless, my dear; but will the appro∣bation of her friends prevent her liking?</P>

<P>Your servant, ladies, was not that Mr. Bel∣mont that left you? I suppose he has been entertain∣ing you with some of his curiosities?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think he is himself a greater curiosity, than any in his collection, my lord, but I fancy he has a mind to dispose of them all together, and means to give a bargain of them to Miss Lawson.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has done me the honour to offer me abun∣dance of rarities, madam, but I am not disposed to receive favours that I cannot return; therefore his treasures are all safe for me</P>

<P>I fancy he loads his gifts with hard con∣ditions, and would persuade you to accept himself along with them. Is it not so, Miss Lawson?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I congratulate you on your conquest, Emily; your eyes can do wonders, it seems, and light up sparks in dying embers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rather think, my lord, that Mr. Belmont's flame is of that kind, which dying fires emit, to shew their near extinction; and the faint blaze has, but by

accident, cast it's pale light on me; any other object might have been brighten'd by the same glimmer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You wrong my uncle's taste; I have not heard of his proposing to marry any lady these five years. Before that time, he used to be generally in love twice a year, and had his summer and winter passions, which he constantly chang'd with his cloaths for the season.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am surpriz'd, my lord, that among such a variety of mistresses, he never found one that wou'd marry him; his person must have been tolerable, when he was young; his family and fortune unex∣ceptionable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be assur'd, sister, that was not the case; but by the time he had brought the lady to think favour∣ably of him, he began to discover some imperfection in her. Perhaps her nose was a hair's breadth longer or shorter than it shou'd be, according to the exact rules of proportion; a foot, or a finger, perhaps, disgusted him; on which, he immediately quitted his pursuit, and went in search of another model.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is happy the men are not so nice, now-a-days, or we shou'd never be able to fix a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy, Louisa, that must be at all times a difficult matter to accomplish; a fine woman will, doubtless, captivate many, but there is something more than beauty, necessary to preserve her conquest over one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, so they say, my lord; but I pro∣test I can't credit it. It is impossible, I think, for a woman to lose her power, while she retains her beauty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>A moment's recollection must furnish you with such a number of instances to contradict your assertion, Louisa, that I'm afraid the argument will drop, on your conviction; and I shou'd like vastly to have it carried on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! never fear, we'll keep it up; but I won't admit of odds; 'tis only with my brother I argue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="47" REF="51"/>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I grant, that while beauty lasts, it will always have admirers. But these, Louisa, are but pageants to a conqueror; the triumph must be found at home, in the heartfelt love and esteem of a man of sense and honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, my lord, but that same beauty, that causes admiration and attention in other men, will necessarily preserve our husband's love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, Louisa; possession damps the ardor of desire; merit alone can keep the flame alive, and hinder every wanton gale from blowing it abroad; that, like the vestal fire, must be preserv'd by constant watching.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>By your account, my lord, a married woman has just as bad a life as a vestal, if her whole time is to be spent in keeping one spark alive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will allow her task is full as arduous, tho' more pleasing. Men are naturally inconstant; and a husband may sometimes see a woman fairer than his wife; but 'tis her fault, if in the whole circle, he can find one that so well deserves his love; whose temper, manners, conduct, and behaviour, are so much suited to his sentiments; who knows no wish or will, but to please him—these charms, the homeliest woman may acquire; without them, the fairest form that ever struck our eyes, cannot retain one heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my lord, we are vastly obliged to you for this excellent lesson; and ought to think our∣selves extremely happy in such a sensible and kind in∣structor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You make me so, as I hope that these slight hints I have thrown out, may be of use to you. But why so grave, Miss Lawson? I hope I have not made you melancholy.</P>

<P>I have heard your lordship, with the utmost pleasure, and most sincerely wish, that my whole sex had done so too.</P>

<SPEAKER>Y. Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Jack, I thought you men of busi∣ness were more exact? Do you think I can't hold it 'till Monday, that you call upon me before the three days are out? This wou'd be enough to hurt a man's credit in the city; and why it shou'd not be deem'd a mark of insolvency, at this end of the town, I can't conceive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E. Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you seem to think a citizen has no ideas but what relate to trade, I shall, upon your own pre∣mises, explain my visit. When we have but a slight
<PB N="51" REF="55"/>
opinion of our debtor, and find him tardy, we think it necessary to observe his motions: but where a man of honour is concerned, tho' we may doubt his power, we don't suspect his principles, and therefore never watch his motions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which is, in plain English, to say, you look upon me as a scoundrel.—Votre serviteur, tres humble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E. Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have drawn this sarcasm upon yourself, by presuming too hastily to explain my motives for this visit; the irksomness of which gives but a bad idea of your integrity. Those who act fairly, need not fear inspection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, brother, you seem to me quite on the <HI>qui vive,</HI> always in a disposition to quarrel, which is a mighty improper temper of mind to visit a lover in, who shou'd be all tun'd to harmony and joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E. Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>The mind shou'd be at peace within itself, to feel those charming sensations; they must arise from conscious worth—not even the power of beauty can awake them, in mean, dishonest hearts; I there∣fore shou'd rejoice, that you were capable of feeling their happy influence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Free.</SPEAKER>

<P>Prithee, Harry, lay by the coxcomb, and tho' you don't act, speak at least, like a rational creature; what cou'd prevent your visiting the lady, all this evening; upon the plan I propos'd, and you agreed to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, really, Jack, you are so very impe∣tuous, you won't give a man time to answer your

why's, and your wherefores; but if it will satisfy you, I did wait on the lady, this very evening; and am, by her appointment, to see her again this night. I then hope to prevail on her to step into an hired equipage with me, and for the rest of my life, to drive in my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E. Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't understand you, sure; is she so ro∣mantically smitten, that she can't wait a few days, 'till her friends and yours have adjusted matters for her honour and security? There can be no doubt, that my father will gladly receive her as his daughter, and make a proper settlement, since she is inclin'd to honour us with her alliance.—She cannot have had time to consult her friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, truly, nor ever shall, with my con∣sent. Why, Jack, it is impossible you shou'd be so ignorant as you seem; you'll never be a rich man, that's certain. There are coups de maitres in trade, as well as love; and if a man has not courage to make a push, he will never make a fortune.—Consult her friends, ha, ha, ha!</P>

<P>I am surpriz'd, Mr. Southerne, you did not think proper to present Miss Southerne's duty to me, nor her respects to these young ladies her cousins; in this you have certainly been deficient, sir.</P>

<P>Reading's a charming exercise for minds at peace; books can even smooth affliction's furrow'd cheek, or change the source and channel of our tears, from selfish to humane; but when the mind is torn with doubts and fears, while mad contending passions labour in the breast, reason itself must fail to calm their discord; nor can the powers of eloquence or musick attune the soul to peace or harmony.</P>

<P>Emily, I thank you for the condescension you have shewn to my request, unknowing of the cause.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Emily; for a little time you have pro∣mis'd to be rul'd; I think you want not sense or vir∣tue to conduct yourself; but as I hope that by to-morrow we shall be able to clear up this dark scene which has perplex'd us, I wish you, for the present, to remain conceal'd: if my scheme shou'd fail, I then will give the reins into your hands, and suffer you to guide them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is an office I do not wish for—by nature and by providence design'd, our helpless sex's strength lies in dependance; and where we are so blest to meet with generous natures, our servitude is empire: to such a state I once aspir'd, but Somerville is gone; how lost my hopes of happiness!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>An honest heart, my lord, is always grate∣ful; but when oppress'd with obligations, it may want the power of utterance; I cannot thank you, but I feel your kindness.</P>

<P>What an amiable man is Lord Belmont! I think no person so happily unites the man of busi∣ness and the nobleman; nicely exact in all his deal∣ings, yet generous as the most dissipated and extrava∣gant; liberality and oeconomy go hand in hand with him, and mutually support each other.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Lord</HI> Belmont.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your servant, Mr. Freeman; your accounts and mine agree exactly; I have look'd them over, the vouchers are all right: but I fear I have trespass'd upon you, by desiring to see you at an hour which men of business generally do, and always ought to give up to amusement; but my being oblig'd to go into the country so immediately, will, I hope, plead my excuse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E. Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>I consider my attendance on your lordship at any hour, as one of the rational pleasures of a man
<PB N="61" REF="65"/>
of business; as your conversation at once entertains and enlarges my mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are extremely polite, Mr. Freeman, and I shall be glad of every opportunity to cultivate the friendship of a person, whose dealings, as a man, and manners, as a gentleman, I so much esteem. If you can spare a little time from business, I shall be very glad of the pleasure of your company in Wor∣cestershire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E. Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am extremely oblig'd to your lordship; but my father now growing infirm, his health requires a recess from trouble and fatigue, and he passes most of the summer in the country; I therefore am confin'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a brother tho', whose attendance, I shou'd imagine, might set you free—he is bred to business, I think?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E. Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my lord; but he is too fine a gen∣tleman to follow it. The air of Lombard-street is too heavy for his constitution; he usually resides at this end of the town, has quitted business, and commenc'd fortune-hunter.</P>
</SP>

<P>Nothing can be truer than your lordship's remark; but reason has no power over dissipated minds, and experience alone can reclaim them: how∣ever, I will try once more to bring him back by ar∣gument.</P>

<P>Why, as a man of honour, my lord, I can't possibly tell a lye; I was here about that time, but the lady was then afraid of being discovered, and desired me to come at this hour, when we concluded the family wou'd be at rest.</P>

<P>Egad, I begin to think she is his daughter; and if that be the case, she shall get a husband.—Do you hear, you hatchet-face gentleman, that are very like my worst medal of Nero, if you don't marry my niece directly, you shall have a couple of ounces of

<P>Sir Charles, had your passion suffered you to have asked me then my errand, I shou'd have frankly own'd it; but while I had hopes of Lady Louisa. I could not, with any decency, have reveal∣ed these last particulars. And now, that I have done all in my power to set matters to rights, and atone my faults, I can only, in palliation of my behaviour, say, that it was not badness of heart, but dislike to a se∣dentary life, which tempted me to leave my sphere, and soar at higher objects. In which, I am now sen∣sible, I have justly failed; and must encounter the deserved fate of those, whom vanity seduces from the situation of life provided for them.</P>

<P>I have been only on the defensive, my lord, during this whole warfare; and such an enemy is ge∣nerally

ready for terms of peace; therefore if you shou'd hold out the olive branch in my name, to your ally, you may suppose I shall accede to the treaty.</P>

<P>No words can speak my gratitude; my heart's too full for utterance. Transporting charmer! every way you have conquer'd, subdued me, by esteem, as well as love.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Sent by a Person unknown.</BYLINE>
<STAGE>Spoken by Miss WILFORD, in the character of Lady LOUISA.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>I Had an Epilogue to speak to night,</L>
<L>But I'm so hurried, put in such a fright,</L>
<L>Deuce take me!—if I ha'nt forgot it quite.</L>
<L>To see my name in first night's play-bill printed,</L>
<L>A character quite new, in time quite stinted;</L>
<L>An Epilogue, besides, to get by heart,</L>
<L>'Tis most unmerciful, too long a part—</L>
<L>But they so coax'd and wheedled me to duty,</L>
<L>Lest I should fret—for fretting spoils one's beauty,</L>
<L>That, in obedience to the kind command,</L>
<L>A suppliant to your favour, here I stand:</L>
<L>And hope, instead of what had been prepar'd,</L>
<L>Some nonsense of my own, may now be heard.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well! I have had a great escape, I own,</L>
<L>From being made the jest of all the town;</L>
<L>For from the court end I could claim no pity,</L>
<L>Nor had I more to hope for, from the city;</L>
<L>Such matches rarely answer either side,</L>
<L>For industry is suited ill with pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, to divert your censure, let me shew</L>
<L>A folly more compleat, a city beau!</L>
<L>What contrast can there be so strong in nature,</L>
<L>As English plainness apeing <HI>petit-maître!</HI></L>
<L>And yet poor I, by missing such a lover,</L>
<L>May wait, 'till all my dancing days are over!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next, shift the scene—behold a virtuoso!</L>
<L>An old illiterate, feeble amoroso!</L>
<L>What weakness can the human heart discover,</L>
<L>More shameful, than a climacteric lover?</L>
<L>Men, who have turn'd the period of threescore,</L>
<L>Become mere virtuoso's—in amour.</L>
</LG>

<PB REF="84"/>
<L>Nor does Aunt Bridget merit better quarter,</L>
<L>Who, scorning to abide by female charter,</L>
<L>Invades a province, to our sex deny'd,</L>
<L>Aiming at knowledge with a pedant's pride;</L>
<L>When, after all our boast, we find, at length,</L>
<L>To know our weakness is our surest strength,</L>
<L>One path of science only, wise men say,</L>
<L>Is left for female learning—to obey.—</L>
<STAGE>[Curtsying.</STAGE>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If characters like these your mirth excite,</L>
<L>And furnish some amusement for the night,</L>
<L>If nought offend the maxims of the stage,</L>
<L>Or shock the nicer morals of the age,</L>
<L>If only venial errors here you find,</L>
<L>Critics be dumb—ye men of candour, kind.</L>
