<P>THE WONDER: A Woman keeps a SECRET. A COMEDY. As it is Acted at the <HI>Theatre Royal in Drury-Lane.</HI> By Her MAJESTY's Servants.</P>

<PB REF="4"/>
I was in hopes might have Congratulated you upon your being in <HI>England,</HI> must now wait for your Arri∣val. I am sure I speak the Sense of every honest <HI>Briton,</HI> when I say that we expect it with the ut∣most Impatience.</P>
<P>Your Highness, who has been hitherto a Stranger a∣mong us, cannot easily con∣ceive the Confidence we re∣pose in you; and it will, perhaps, hardly be believ'd in future Ages, that the first Report of the Duke
<PB REF="5"/>
of <HI>Cambridge</HI>'s Design to Visit us, should raise the <HI>PUBLICK CREDIT</HI> of the <HI>British Nation.</HI></P>
<P>We are fill'd with Plea∣sure, to think that the most accomplish'd of <HI>Princes</HI> will perfect himself in the Arts of Government under the Eye, and Direction of the Greatest of <HI>Queens.</HI></P>
<P>If it is possible there shou'd be a Sett of Men among us who can wish to see their Country become a Province of <HI>France,</HI> it is, I think, pretty evident that
<PB REF="6"/>
your Residence in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will soon put an End to such Impious Ex∣pectations.</P>
<P>The Law of Nature makes it not improbable that you will one Day reign over us, and what may not our Posterity expect from a Prince who in his early Years distinguish'd himself in the Cause of Liberty, and led their Ancestors on to Victory? The Balance of <HI>Europe</HI> will doubtless be kept steady by that Hand which has already perform'd
<PB REF="7"/>
such Wonders in order to maintain it; our Religion, our Laws, and Civil Rites can be in no Danger under a Prince, who from his Con∣versation with our Nobility, and his Presence at their most important Debates, will have a perfect Insight into all the Parts of our Consti∣tution.</P>
<P><HI>Britain</HI> shall from hence-forward claim your <HI>HIGH∣NESS</HI> intirely as her own, and endeavour by the most con∣vincing Proofs of her Love and Respect, to make you
<PB REF="8"/>
forget the Court of your Il∣lustrious Father.</P>
<P>The Pains you have al∣ready taken to acquire our Tongue, cannot fail to endear you to every <HI>Englishman;</HI> yet as the Idioms of a Lan∣guage are the last Things we arrive at, I am in hopes an <HI>English</HI> Comedy will not be thought the most improper Present that could be offer'd to your <HI>HIGHNESS.</HI></P>
<P>There is no doubt but you will soon be made the Sub∣ject of more Correct Pens, and receive a just Tribute
<PB REF="9"/>
from the greatest Authors of our Nation: In the mean Time, tho' I am, perhaps, the most unworthy, I have at least one Advantage, that I am the first who have shewn my Respect in this Manner, and sued for your Protection.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Don't pretend to write a Preface, either to point out the Beauties, or to excuse the Er∣rors, a judicious Reader may possibly discover in the following Scenes, but to give those ex∣cellent Comedians their Due, to whom, in some Measure the best Dramatick Writers are ob∣lig'd. The Poet and the Player are like Soul and Body, indispensibly necessary to one ano∣ther; the correct Author makes the Player shine, whilst the judicious Player makes the Po∣et's Fame immortal. I freely acknowledge my self oblig'd to the Actors in general, and to Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> in particular; and I owe them this Justice to say, That their inimitable Action cou'd only support a Play at such a Season, and among so many Benefits. Let this encourage our <HI>English</HI> Bards to Write, furnish but the artful Player with Materials, and his Skill will lay the Foundation for your Fame.</P>
<P>I must again repeat that which I meet with every where, I mean the just Admiration of the Performance of Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Old∣field,</HI> and own that they much out-did in Action the strongest of my Conceptions; for tho' Nature was my Aim in the last Act of this Comedy, yet Nature herself were she to paint a Love Quarrel, wou'd only Copy them.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><STAGE>Spoken by <HI>Mr.</HI> MILLS.</STAGE></HEAD>
<L>OUR <HI>Author</HI> fears the Criticks of the Stage,</L>
<L>Who like Barbarians, spare nor Sex, nor Age;</L>
<L>She trembles at those Censors in the Pit,</L>
<L>Who think good Nature shows a want of Wit:</L>
<L>Such Malice, Oh, what Muse can undergo it?</L>
<L>To save themselves, they always Damn the Poet.</L>
<L>Our Author flies from such a Partial Jury,</L>
<L>As wary Lovers from the Nymphs of <HI>Drury:</HI></L>
<L>To the few Candid Judges for a Smile,</L>
<L>She humbly sues to Recompence her Toil.</L>
<L>To the bright Circle of the Fair, she next,</L>
<L>Commits her Cause, with Anxious Doubts perplext.</L>
<L>Where can she with such hopes of Favour kneel,</L>
<L>As to those Judges, who her Frailties feel?</L>
<L>A few Mistakes, her Sex may well excuse,</L>
<L>And such a Plea, No <HI>Woman</HI> shou'd refuse:</L>
<L>If she succeeds, a <HI>Woman</HI> gains Applause,</L>
<L>What <HI>Female</HI> but must favour such a Cause.</L>
<L>Her Faults,—If such there be:—Then,—pass 'em by,</L>
<L>And only on her Beauties fix your Eye.</L>
<L>In Plays, like Vessels floating on the Sea,</L>
<L>There's none so Wise to know their Destiny.</L>
<L>In this, howe'er the Pilot's Skill appears,</L>
<L>While by the Stars his constant Course he steers;</L>
<L>In this our <HI>Author</HI> does her Judgment shew,</L>
<L>That for her Safety she relies on You.</L>
<L>Your Approbation Fair ones, can't but move,</L>
<L>Those stubborn Hearts, which first you taught to Love:</L>
<L>The Men must all Applaud this Play of ours,</L>
<L>For who dares See with other Eyes, than Yours?</L>

<P>How do you <HI>Frederick?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>At your Lordship's Service, I am glad to see you look so well my Lord, I hope <HI>Antonio</HI> is out of dan∣ger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite contrary, his Feaver increases they tell me, and the Surgeons are of Opinion his wound is mortal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Son <HI>Don Felix</HI> is safe I hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope so too, but they offer large Rewards to apprehend him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>When heard your Lordship from him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not since he went, I forbad him writing till the publick News gave him an Account of <HI>Anto∣nio</HI>'s Health, Letters might be intercepted, and the place of his Abode discovered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Caution was good my Lord; tho' I am impatient to hear from <HI>Felix,</HI> yet his Safety is my chief Concern. Fortune has maliciously struck a Bar be∣tween us in the Affairs of Life, but she has done me the Honour to unite our Souls.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not ignorant of the friendship between my Son and You, I have heard him commend your Morals and lament your want of noble Birth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's Nature's fault my Lord, 'tis some comfort not to owe ones Misfortunes to ones Self, yet 'tis im∣possible not to regret the want of noble Birth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis pity indeed such excellent Parts as you are Master of, should be eclipsed by mean Extraction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such Commendation wou'd make me vain my Lord, did you not cast in the allay of my Extraction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no Condition of Life without its Cares, and it is the Perfection of a Man to wear 'em as easie as he can; this unfortunate Duel of my Son's does not pass without Impression. But since 'tis past Preven∣tion, all my Concern is now, how he may escape the Punishment; if <HI>Antonio</HI> dies, <HI>Felix</HI> shall for <HI>England.</HI> You have been there, what sort of People are the <HI>Eng∣lish?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, the <HI>English</HI> are by Nature, what the ancient <HI>Romans</HI> were by Discipline, couragious, bold, hardy, and in love with Liberty. Liberty is the Idol of the <HI>English,</HI> under whose Banner all the Nation Lists, give but the Word for Liberty, and straight more armed Legions wou'd appear, than <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> keep in constant Pay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like their Principles; who does not wish for Freedom in all Degrees of Life? Tho' common Prudence sometimes makes us act against it, as I am now obliged to do, for I intend to marry my Daugh∣ter to <HI>Don Guzman,</HI> whom I expect from <HI>Holland</HI> eve∣ry Day, whither he went to take Possession of a large Estate left him by his Uncle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will not sure Sacrifice the lovely <HI>Isabella</HI> to Age, Avarice, and a Fool, pardon the Expression my Lord, but my Concern for your beauteous Daughter transports me beyond that good Manners which I ought to pay your Lordship's presence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't deny the justness of the Character <HI>Frederick</HI>; but you are not insensible what I have suffer∣ed by these Wars, and he has two things which render him very agreeable to me for a Son-in-Law, he is Rich and well Born; as for his being a Fool, I don't con∣ceive how that can be any Blot in a Husband, who is al∣ready possess'd of a good Estate.—A Poor Fool indeed is a very Scandalous thing, and so are your Poor Wits, in my Opinion, who have nothing to be vain of, but the inside of their Sculls; now for <HI>Don Guzman</HI> I know I can rule him, as I think fit; this is acting the Politick part, <HI>Frederick,</HI> without which, it is impossible to keep up the Port of this Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>But have you no Consideration for your Daughter's welfare my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is a Husband of twenty thousand Crowns a Year, no Consideration? Now I think it a very good Consideration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>One way, my Lord. But what will the World say of such a Match?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I value not the World a Button.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot think your Daughter can have any Inclination for such a Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>There I believe you are pretty much in the right, tho' it is a Secret, which I never had the Curio∣sity
<PB N="4" REF="16"/>
to enquire into, nor I believe ever shall—Inclina∣tion quotha! Parents would have a fine time on't, if they consulted their Childrens Inclinations! I'll ven∣ture you a Wager, that in all the Garrison Towns in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> during the late War, there were not three Women, who have not had an Inclination to every Officer in the whole Army; does it therefore follow, that their Fathers ought to Pimp for them? No, no, Sir, it is not a Father's business to follow his Childrens Inclinations till he makes himself a Beggar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this is of another Nature my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye Sir, I resolve she shall Marry <HI>Don Guzman</HI> the Moment he arrives; tho' I cou'd not go∣vern my Son, I will my Daughter, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Match my Lord, is more preposterous than that which you proposed to your Son, from whence a∣rose this fatal—Quarrel, <HI>Don Antonio</HI>'s Sister <HI>Elvira,</HI> wanted Beauty only, but <HI>Guzman</HI> every thing, but—</P>

<P>Monstrous! These are the Resolutions which destroy the comforts of Matrimony—he is Rich, and well born, powerful Arguments indeed!

<P>Why Faith <HI>Frederick,</HI> a Man might pass his Time agreeably enough with Inside of a Nunnery; but to behold such Troops of soft, plump, tender melting, wishing, nay willing Girls too, thro' a damn'd Grate, gives us <HI>Brittons</HI> strong Temptation to Plunder. Ah <HI>Frederick,</HI> your Priests are wicked Rogues. They im∣mure Beauty for their own proper Use, and show it on∣ly to the Laity to create Desires, and inflame Accompts, that they may purchase Pardons at a dearer Rate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own Wenching is something more difficult here than in <HI>England,</HI> where Womens Liberties are subservient to their Inclinations, and Husbands seem of no Effect but to take Care of the Children which their Wives provide.</P>

<P>Faith Colonel, I am the worst Pimp in <HI>Chri∣stendom,</HI> you had better trust to your own Luck, the Women will soon find you out I warrant you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Isab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art no Stranger to one part of it; I have often told thee that my Father design'd to sacrifice me to the Arms of <HI>Don Guzman,</HI> who it seems is just re∣turn'd from <HI>Holland,</HI> and expected ashore to-morrow, the Day that he has set to celebrate our Nuptials, upon my refusing to obey him, he lock'd me into my Chamber, vowing to keep me there till he arriv'd, and force me to consent. I know my Father to be possi∣tive, never to be won from his Design; and having no hope left me, to escape the Marriage, I leap'd from the Window, into the Street.</P>

<P>He is a very fine Gentleman I promise you, Madam, and a well bred Man I warrant him. I think I never saw a Grandee put his Hand into his Pocket with a better Air in my whole Life Time; then he open'd his Purse with such a Grace, that nothing but his Manner of presenting me the Gold cou'd equal.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Then Sir, immediately from another Door issued forth a Lady, arm'd at both Eyes, from whence such Showers of Darts fell round me, that had I not been cover'd with the Shield of another Beauty, I had infallibly fall'n a Martyr to her Charms; for you must know I just saw her Eyes, Eyes did I say? No, no, hold, I saw but one Eye, tho' I suppose it had a Fellow, equally as killing.</P>

<P>But how came you to see her Bed Sir? S'Death this Expectation gives a thousand Racks. <STAGE>(<HI>Aside.</HI></STAGE></P>

<P>Upon her Father's coming?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ay, so she said, but putting my Ear to the Key∣hole of the Door, I found it was another Lover.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I discover'd they had had a Quarrel, but whe∣ther they were reconcil'd or not, I can't tell, for the second Alarm brought the Father in good earnest, and had like to have made the Gentleman and I acquaint∣ed, but she found some other Stratagem to convey him out.</P>

<P>Contagion seize her, and make her Body ugly as her Soul. There's nothing left to doubt of now,—'Tis plain 'twas she,—Sure he knows me, and takes this Method to insult me, S'Death I cannot bear it. <STAGE>(<HI>Aside.</HI></STAGE></P>

<P>No, Pox take the impertinent Puppy, he spoil'd my Diversion, I saw her no more.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. <HI>SANTLOW.</HI></STAGE></HEAD>
<BYLINE><HI>Written by Mr.</HI> PHILIPS.</BYLINE>
<L>CUstom with all our Modern Laws combin'd,</L>
<L>Has given such Power despotick to Mankind,</L>
<L>That We have only so much Vertue now,</L>
<L>As they are pleas'd in favour to allow.</L>
<L>Thus like Mechanick Work we're us'd with Scorn,</L>
<L>And wound up only, for a present Turn;</L>
<L>Some are for having our whole Sex enslav'd,</L>
<L>Affirming we've no Souls, and can't be sav'd;</L>
<L>But were the Women all of my Opinion,</L>
<L>We'd soon shake off this false usurp'd Dominion;</L>
<L>We'd make the Tyrants own, that we cou'd prove,</L>
<L>As fit for other Business as for Love.</L>
<L>Lord! What Prerogative might we obtain,</L>
<L>Could we from Yielding, a few Months refrain!</L>
<L>How fondly wou'd our starving Lovers doat!</L>
<L>What Homage wou'd be paid to Petticoat!</L>
<L>'Twou'd be a Jest to see the change of Fate,</L>
<L>How we might all of Politicks Debate;</L>
<L>Promise, and Swear, what we ne'er meant to do,</L>
<L>And what's still harder, <HI>keep your Secrets too.</HI></L>
<L>Ay Marry! <HI>Keep a Secret</HI> says a Beau,</L>
<L>And sneers at some ill-natur'd Wit below;</L>
<L>But Faith, if we shou'd tell but half we know,</L>
<L>There's many a spruce Young Fellow in this Place,</L>
<L>Would never more presume to show his Face;</L>
<L><HI>Women</HI> are not so weak, whate'er <HI>Men</HI> prate;</L>
<L>How many tip top Beau<HI>'s</HI> have had the Fate,</L>
<L>T'enjoy from <HI>Mamma</HI>'s Secrets their Estate.</L>
<L>Which if Her early Folly had made known,</L>
<L>He'd rid behind the Coach, that's now His own.</L>
<L>But here, the <HI>Wond'rous Secret</HI> you discover;</L>
<L>A <HI>Lady</HI> ventures for a <HI>Friend,</HI>—a <HI>Lover.</HI></L>
<L>Prodigious! For my part I frankly own,</L>
<L>I'd spoil'd the <HI>Wonder,</HI> and the <HI>Woman</HI> shown.</L>
