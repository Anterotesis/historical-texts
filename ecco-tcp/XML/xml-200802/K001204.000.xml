<HEAD>HOUSE OF COMMONS, <HI>Tuesday,</HI> 11<HI>th December,</HI> 1787.</HEAD>
<HEAD>MR. FRANCIS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. SPEAKER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Before I offer any thing to the consideration of the House <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the present occasion, I beg leave to return my very sincere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nks,—not to my honourable friends near me, for that I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rly unequal to, but to the two honourable gentlemen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>o spoke first on the other side of the House, for the candid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>en, and liberal manner, in which they have explained the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>und of their opposition to the motion. They think, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ey declare, that having had a duel with Mr. Hastings, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ght not to be employed in impeaching him. This is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>st time I ever heard the objection stated in a regular par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>mentary way. I am indebted to them, therefore, not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the fair and honourable terms in which they have ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ssed it, but even for the objection itself; because it has re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ved me from great anxiety. I now understand what the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ection is, and what it is not:—it is a scruple that regards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>oint of honor:—It is not an imputation:—It is not a re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ach. I have attended this debate, Sir, of which I knew I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be the subject, very much against my inclination. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not an easy situation; but I could not avoid it with pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ety. I thought it would be proper and becoming in me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appear and be ready to answer or to explain any thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ich, in the judgement of the House, might call for expla∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ion. Nothing of that kind having occurred, I shall not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e occasion to solicit your attention for more than a few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>utes. It has been formally and explicitly stated to you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great authority, that the point in debate is not a question <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rgument, but of feeling. This is the avowed principle on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ich the motion is opposed. I do not mean to object to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> state of the question, or to any other, on which any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>tleman may choose to consider it. Allow me only to ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ss my hopes, that gentlemen, who are so properly and ho∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rably careful of their own feelings, will not confine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>r attention to themselves, but have some consideration <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tenderness for the feelings of others. The very care, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which they guard their own sensations, intitles me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ect that they will be equally cautious of wounding the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>or of an individual, to whom no offence is imputed.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t would be a poor and useless affectation in me to pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> that I received the vote, which past a few days ago, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> indifference, or indeed, without serious concern. I
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y"/>
could not but be sensible of the turn that would be given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it, and of the impression it would probably make abroad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my disadvantage. I could not see myself excluded fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> sharing in the labours of my honorable friend, without loo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>¦ing back to the situation, in which I was forced to aband<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> him, with the deepest regret. His abilities are equal to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> task he has undertaken, if any human abilities are equal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it. Of this heavy burthen he must now support <HI>my</HI> share <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well as his own; yet, the labours, which had necessarily fall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> to his lot, required no addition. In saying this, howev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> or in any thing else which I may say to the same effect, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> most earnestly wish to guard myself against an obvious m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> construction. While I lament the consequence of the v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> that excludes me from any share in the impeachment of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Hastings, let no man think it possible, that I mean to solic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> the House to alter their resolution.—I deny and disclaim t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> intention, and deprecate the imputation of it.—Setting asi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> the single consideration of the assistance I owe to my hono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>¦able friend, what can I desire better for myself than to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> excluded, without disgrace, from any farther concern in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> toilsome, invidious, and most unthankful office? If I am a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>¦tional creature, if I have not utterly lost my understandi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> what could I imagine more for my honor, for my advantag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> and for my happiness, than to be dismissed by an act of pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> at this particular point of time, at this particular stage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the business, from any further share in it? My object, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as I had any personal object in the prosecution of Mr. Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>¦ings, is accomplished. The House have approved and co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>¦firmed the principles of my opposition to him, and adopt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> my opinion of his conduct. In condemning <HI>him</HI> they ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> acquitted <HI>me.</HI> The impeachment must go to trial. Thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I have voluntarily and zealously taken part in the proce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>¦tion of Mr. Hastings, and thus far it has succeeded. So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> men think that I have had a principal share in this busine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> others are ready enough to affirm, that I am the sole author <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it all. The fact is, that in the face of a thousand difficulti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> our joint and common efforts have hitherto been reward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> with success. I am now discharged from the conduct of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cause, which, of my own accord undoubtedly, I should nev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> have abandoned. If it should fail hereafter, I shall have n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>¦thing to answer for. It will belong to others to answer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the event, if the event should finally disappoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> expectation of justice. I have called the vote, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave been dismissed, strictly and exclusively an act of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cannot call it a prudential act, because no motives of pru∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence were assigned for it. I cannot call it a judicial act, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ithout attacking the justice of the House, and affronting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he honor of every individual who took part in it. To affirm, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r to suppose that this House could intend to express a cen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure, in that censure to inflict a punishment, and in that pu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ishment to convey a disgrace, the severest of all punish∣ment to an honorable mind;—without a hearing of parties; without a charge or defence; without evidence or inquiry—would be to accuse this House of a shameful violation of very principle of justice, and of totally forgetting their own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onor as well as mine.</P>
<P>I do not mean, Sir, to enter at all into the reasons, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ught to induce the House to reject or agree to the present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otion. The arguments on one side have been stated with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nexampled eloquence and abilities, and nothing has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pposed to them on the other. Whether the character of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nemy be incompatible with that of accuser; whether it be, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r be not a wise principle, to endeavour to engage the pas∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ons of individuals on the side of justice; whether it be per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ectly clear that this House, acting not merely for themselves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut in a fiduciary capacity for all the Commons of Great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ritain, are warranted in laying aside those instruments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich are most likely to act with vigor and activity in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ause of national justice, are questions, which I submit—will not say with indifference, but with perfect resignation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the judgement of the House. At the same time, Sir, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have no manner of anxiety about the conclusion, I should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e regardless of the truth, and careless of my honour, if I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ffered the premises to be taken for granted. I deny that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, or ever was, the enemy of Mr. Hastings, in that personal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nse in which it is imputed to me. When I moved the re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enue charge, some months ago, the House condescended to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>sten with attention to a short narrative of all the transac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ons between me and Mr. Hastings. I thought and was as∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>red that they were satisfied with my conduct. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>d already appointed me <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">April 3, 1787.</NOTE> one of the Secret Committee for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reparing the impeachment, and they resolved to impeach him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the particular charge moved by me.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">April 19, 1787. For the question 71; against it 55; total 123.</NOTE> It is true, the House
<PB N="4" REF="4" MS="y"/>
was not very full that day; many gentlemen, who now hear me, must have been absent. I shall, therefore, request your per∣mission to repeat the substance of what I submitted to you on that occasion, without argument or detail. All I mean is to state the facts briefly, and to leave the results from them to be determined by their impression on the minds of every man of honour who hears me. I was appointed by Parlia∣ment with Sir John Clavering and Colonel Monson to a place in the government of Bengal in conjunction with Mr. Hastings, whom we had never seen. We went to India prejudiced,—passionately prejudiced in his favour. Almost instantly after our arrival there we found reasons to abandon the opinion we had formed of him, and instead of supporting we attacked him. At that moment at least there could be no personal animosity in us towards a man, who had never personally offended us. From the moment we knew him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our opposition to him began, and was continued by each o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us, without intermission, as long as we had the power of op∣posing him. Whatever may be thought of <HI>my</HI> character<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no man, I believe, will attribute the conduct of my honor¦able colleagues to base, vindictive motives. This honorabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> House, I am sure, will never concur in any thing that offer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an indignity to the venerable names of Clavering and Mon¦son. In the year 1780, a pacification took place between Mr Hastings and me; the reasons and purposes of which it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unnecessary to mention, as they are fully stated in the Reports of the Select Committee. Out of this pacification a differenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> between us unfortunately arose, which ended in a duel. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the merits of the question I say nothing. The language h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made use of, on the records of the council, obliged me to seek for reparation in point of honour, at the hazard of my life. It would be absurd to call it revenge. The aggresso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in effect is the challenger, and meets his opponent on equa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> terms. It is but justice to him to say, that he behaved him∣self perfectly well in the field. It was my lot to fall. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the approach of death, which I thought inevitable, the af¦fairs of this world in a moment lost all their importance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the veil was removed; I thought of nothing then, but to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> in peace with all men, particularly with Mr. Hastings. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> called him to me, gave him my hand, and desired him to con¦sider in what situation my death would leave him. By tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> action, and by those words, undoubtedly I meant to declar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that I freely forgave him the insult he had offered me, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="5" REF="5" MS="y"/>
the fatal consequence which had attended it. I meant that we should stand in the same relation to each other, as if the duel and the cause of it had never happened. But did I tell him, that if I survived, I would renounce the whole plan and principle of my public life; that I would cease to oppose his measures; that I would desert the charges, which I had al∣ready brought against him, or not prosecute him by public impeachment if I could? No, Sir, never; nor am I charged with it. If I had done so, I must have dishonoured myself for ever, without a motive and without a compensation. On my return to England, I found that a parliamentary inquiry into the late transactions in India was already begun, and I was almost immediately ordered to attend one of the Com∣mittees employed upon that inquiry. Of those gentlemen who think that I ought not to appear against Mr. Hastings, I beg leave to ask, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n what manner I ought to have acted? Could I, without treachery to the public, refuse to give evi∣dence or information necessary for the public service, when it was demanded of me by the authority of the House of Com∣mons? or, in fact, was it in my power? Will any man affirm that I had an option? If not, the single question is, in what form and manner did it become me to appear and act as the accuser of Mr. Hastings? What, in the character of evidence only? Would that have been a part to which no enmity, no malice could have been imputed. Would it have been honorable in me to stand aloof or hide myself, while in fact I supplied the information, while I furnished the materials, and prompted the prosecution? or, am I thought to have acted dishonora∣bly, because I declared myself the public responsible accuser of Mr. Hastings? because I avowed my principles, because I stood forward in the charge, and hazarded all those conse∣quences of obloquy, retaliation, and revenge, which a public prosecutor must encounter, but, which a secret skulking ac∣cuser may very easily avoid? These are questions, I trust, which answer themselves in the mind of every man of honor. Sir, I do not mean to say, that the circumstance of my hav∣ing had a duel with Mr. Hastings never occurred to me as an objection, which possibly might have weight with others, though it appeared to me of no consequence. It did cer∣tainly occur to me as a doubt, on which I ought not to trust entirely to my own judgement. But, the honourable per∣son whom I consulted, is no more, and for that reason I have hitherto been tender of mentioning his name. They, who
<PB N="6" REF="6" MS="y"/>
knew Sir William Draper, I am sure will acknowledge that there could not be a stricter and more scrupulous judge of points of honor than he was. If it were possible to produce the opinion he gave me, in approbation of the conduct I have pursued, I should look no farther. But there is an au∣thority to the same effect, which I am able to produce, and which, though negative in its form, I doubt not will be deemed equivalent to any positive opinion whatever. I have now been engaged above two years in constant intercourse and connection with twenty gentlemen of the first character in this kingdom, and in constant conversation with them on the subject of this impeachment; I mean particularly the gentlemen who compose the present Committee, as well as many others. I appeal to their testimony, I appeal specially to the honourable General Officer <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">General Burgoyne.</NOTE> near me, whose opinion, I believe, will be allowed to be authority, not only to me, but to the world. Did any of these gentlemen ever, directly or indirectly, signify to me a doubt about the propriety of my conduct? If they did, I call upon them now to declare it. Is it a thing to be believed, that if they had felt a scru∣ple, in point of honor, on this subject, they would never have expressed it to me, or that they would have acted with me, if I had known and disregarded their opinion?</P>
<P>Thirteen years are now elapsed, since I first was connected in office with Mr. Hastings. Six of them were wasted in India in perpetual contest with him. Seven years ago, I left him there in possession of absolute power. In all that time no charges have been produced against me. Yet, I think it cannot be said that I have been particularly cautious not to provoke hostility, or that there is no disposition any where to accuse me. Surely, Sir, if accusation is ever to come, it is high time it should appear. If now, or at any other period, I should be obliged to change place with Mr. Hastings; if hereafter it should be my lot to be accused, I shall assuredly never ob∣ject to his being my prosecutor; for, though by removing a powerful, a well-informed, and, in the sense of the present argument, an inveterate accuser, I might provide for my safety, my honor would be lost. Let those gentlemen, who are trusted with the care of Mr. Hastings's honor consider what they are doing.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7" MS="y"/>I beg of gentlemen to observe, that in the present question I am nothing but a passive instrument at the disposal of the House. If they think fit to employ me, I shall endeavour to execute their commands with industry and vigour; if not, I shall consider it as the happiest period at which I could re∣ceive my dismission, and rejoice in the liberty, to which it will restore me, of turning my thoughts to some other object, of applying my faculties to some other occupation. That I should ever be engaged in another service, so vexatious, so laborious, so invidious, and so unprofitable, as this has been, I am sure is impossible.</P>
<P>Mr. Francis left the House as soon as he finished his speech.</P>
