<P>THE TIMES: A COMEDY.</P>
<P>AS IT IS NOW PERFORMING AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE favourable reception which the fol∣lowing Comedy has met with from a candid and generous Public, calls for my warmest acknowledgements; and tho' it may be of little consequence to them to know the source of so slight an amusement, I think myself bound by truth and gratitude to own, that the first idea of this Piece was hinted to me by my ever-respected and lamented friend Mr. GARRICK, who mentioned GOLDONI's <HI>Bourru Bienfaisant,</HI> as a sketch that, if adapted to our times and manners, might be rendered pleasing to an English Audience. Those who have read the French Piece must judge how far I have profited by GOLDONI's work; but of this I am certain, that had Mr. GARRICK lived to afford me that friendly assistance which he has done on former occasions, my Comedy would have been more worthy of the reception with which it has been honoured. I will, however, hope that, <Q>with all its imperfec∣tions on its head,</Q> the same indulgence which attended its representation, will follow it into the closet; and that the Reader will allow me the only merit I presume to claim, that of meaning well.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
I gladly take this opportunity of returning my thanks to my much-esteemed friend, Mr. SHERIDAN, senior, for his kind attention to the getting up my Play, my ill health not permitting me to attend one Rehearsal. But Mr. SHERIDAN's friendship, wherever pro∣fessed, is not of modern growth.</P>
<P>I have more than common acknowledge∣ments to make to all the Performers in my Comedy; particularly to Mrs. ABINGTON and Miss POPE, who both chearfully undertook Parts out of their usual line of acting, and in which they have both excelled. I should be utterly unable to express my sentiments of Mr. KING, in the character of SIR WILLIAM WOODLEY, if I were not at liberty seriously to adopt the very words which he humorously, but justly, speaks of himself, under a personated character, in <HI>The Critic:—</HI><Q>But it is impossible for language to do justice to Mr. KING! Indeed, he more than merited those repeated bursts of applause which he drew from a most bril∣liant and judicious Audience.</Q></P>
<P>I flatter myself, this little tribute to distin∣guished merit will not be deemed tedious or impertinent by the Public, for whose opinion I have the sincerest respect, and to whom I have the honour to be</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>Spoken by Mr. KING.</P>
<LG>
<L>TO glow with ardour, and attempt with zeal</L>
<L>The reformation of the public weal,</L>
<L>Is the high duty of the COMIC MUSE;</L>
<L>And tho' keen Attic Salt allowed to use,</L>
<L>To season Precept, and with Art to tickle</L>
<L>The sores she means to wash with sharpest pickle,</L>
<L>Yet not the rosy, pulpited Divine,</L>
<L>Nor lank-hair'd Methodist with rueful whine,</L>
<L>Is more intent to root out Vice and Folly,</L>
<L>And make ye all lead lives discreet and holy.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet why to clear the field were all their toil,</L>
<L>If weeds o'erspread not the luxuriant soil?</L>
<L>Congreve or Wesley, Whitfield or Moliere,</L>
<L>In vain might prompt the laugh, or bribe the tear,</L>
<L>If no man felt, or in himself, or neighbour,</L>
<L>Some failing to call forth the zealot's labour;—</L>
<L>If no fair dame descried, 'midst her acquaintance,</L>
<L>Some few who might be mended by repentance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Loose as the buxom air, the Youth from College</L>
<L>Comes fraught with all Newmarket's hopeful knowledge;</L>
<L>In haste to spend the Estate, not yet his own,</L>
<L>Compleats his ruin ere his beard is grown;</L>
<L>And when to foreign climes he spreads the sail,</L>
<L>'Tis not to enlarge his mind, but 'scape a jail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then blest the Poet, happy the Divine,</L>
<L>When Folly gives the <HI>Ton</HI> from Fashion's Shrine!</L>
<L>But whilst the Priest and Satirist reprove</L>
<L>Those vices which provoke the wrath of JOVE,</L>
<L>Our Author, like the patient Angler sitting</L>
<L>To catch small fry, for humbler palates sitting,</L>
<L>Has served a Meal, not seasoned high with crimes.—</L>
<L>Taste it, and if approved, applaud THE TIMES.</L>
</LG>

<DIV1 TYPE="epilogue">
<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>Spoken by Miss FARREN.</P>
<LG>
<L>WHILE grave-paced Tragedy, with Oh's! and Starts!</L>
<L>Flies at high game, to move and mend your hearts,</L>
<L>We merrier folks, with spirits blithe and jolly,</L>
<L>Just perch upon some little sprig of folly:</L>
<L>For, in this Age, so pious, chaste, and grave,</L>
<L>To rail at Vice, must surely be to rave!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
<L>Yet thanks to here and there a modish fool,</L>
<L>The COMIC MUSE may glean some ridicule.</L>
<L>Jews will be Jews, if dupes can yet be found,</L>
<L>And if one frail one's left on English ground,</L>
<L>She'll find a Phaeton and pair of ponies</L>
<L>To elope—for all men are not Maccaronies:—</L>
<L>Those precious Dears, at least, would make her wait—</L>
<L>'Twould be so vulgar, not to be too late.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our sex—but shall I charge the weaker kind?</L>
<L>Or can those fail to stray, whose guides are blind!</L>
<L>Let men reform themselves, they're our examples—</L>
<L>And goods prove seldom better than their samples.</L>
<L>In former times the gallant British Youth</L>
<L>Were formed for Chivalry, and Love, and Truth—</L>
<L>In such an Age, in such a virtuous Nation,</L>
<L>Love was in woman almost inspiration.—</L>
<L>But now, alas! I speak without a jest,</L>
<L>Women are not inspired—they're but possest.</L>
<L>Men are our pilots! They should mark the shelves;</L>
<L>For when they blame us, they reproach themselves.</L>

<P>SURE, never man was so suddenly involved as I have been!—and yet I cannot charge either my wife or myself with any particular extravagance.

<P>He seems devilishly flurried by that same letter. I wish I could come fairly at its con∣tents. 'Tis no billet-doux, I am certain; for I have never found him tripping that way, since I have been in the family. It must be some matter of bu∣siness, and if it is, it may concern me as well as my master. I have had my doubts that our affairs were going wrong, for some months past. Our hall has been crowded with sturdy Tradesmen, and we have had sneaking Jews closeted in the Library.—Egad, I'll venture; for where interest is concerned, even my honour must give way— <STAGE>(takes up the letter).</STAGE> He may surprise me, tho'.—I wish his shoes creaked <STAGE>(looks out and listens).</STAGE>—No—all's safe yet; and now for the indulgence of a reasonable curiosity.— <STAGE>(reads.)</STAGE> 
<LETTER>
<P>I find it impossible to trifle any longer with your creditors; the executions will therefore immedi∣ately be laid on, unless you can prevail on Lady Mary to release her jointure; for there is not even a Jew in Duke's-Place that will advance a guinea more on your estate, whilst that incumbrance re∣mains.</P>

<P>Good-morrow, Woodley! What, not dressed yet! I expected to find you booted, and ready to set out for Newmarket. You'll be late on the turf. Your horses run, I suppose? What matches have you made?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>None, Colonel. I shall not be there, this Meeting.</P>

<P>You amaze me.</P>

<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
<P>Would I had never been there! I am sick of the diversion, and shall never make another bett on the turf while I live.</P>

<P>Why don't you dispose of your stud, then? It must be an enormous, and now an useless expence.</P>

<P>Horses are the least part of the extrava∣gances incident to racing.</P>

<P>That is <HI>selon,</HI> Woodley; for I have known several fortunes made on the turf.</P>

<P>True—but by those only who had none to lose. They are surest to win, who carry least weight.</P>

<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take my advice, then, and sell your horses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, faith, I wish they were disposed of. But yet, I don't know, I should be ashamed, I think, to advertise them, as it might look some-how as if one could not afford to keep them. Ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ridiculous supposition!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ridiculous, indeed! That you know, Mountfort, is far from the case, but I really am tired of the sport; and the Meeting, too, is at a time of the year when there are so many more agreeable amusements to be met with in London, so that I should be glad to get rid of them, with all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me dispose of them for you, then. I'll be your Auctioneer, and try if I can't emblazon their pedigree with a little of that true humour which Charles Surface bestows on his ancestors, when he sets up their pictures to sale. Bucephalus, the fa∣mous Bucephalus, Gentlemen, descended in a right line from the renowned quadrupede of that name, which had the honour of carrying a greater brute than himself—the immortal Alexander—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo! Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or shall we deduce his lineage from—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had better consult Tattersall, for their pedigree, as he is your only herald in those points. Heigh-ho!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heigh-ho! This is but poor encourage∣ment for me to enter on my new profession. Surely there is something malignant in the air, at present; for every man I have conversed with, this morning, seems rather to be depressed with the gloom of November, than enlivened by the sunshine of April. I have just now left Jack Knightly and Will Careless calculating, not their nativities, but their deaths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I saw them both at Boodle's, yesterday, in good health.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not the more likely to live, for that, I as∣sure you. However, it was not their natural exist∣ence,
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
but their necessary subsistence, that employed their mathematics.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>You astonish me!—Why, it is but lately they came into possession of great estates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>True:—but then they have travelled the modern short and easy road to ruin, of granting annuities for this twelvemonth past, and are now so nearly arrived at the last stage of their journey, that I think Jack said he had but two months to run; and Will flattered himself, that as the summer was approaching, he might be able to hold out four. I advised their compounding the terms, and run∣ning together for three months each.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor fellows! I am sorry for them. <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> Would I could promise myself even so long a reprieve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! moping again, Woodley? You'll infect me, if I stay.—Where are the Ladies?—In truth, my visit was to them, for I scarce hoped to find you here. Are Lady Mary and your sister visible? or shall I pass on to your Uncle's apartment, and pay my respects to him? I think there is a door of communication to his house from this room. Shall I go this way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be a service of danger, Colonel; for I fear Sir William is not at present much delighted either with his vicinity, or affinity, to any of this family, except my sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear you can except my sweet Louisa; for, notwithstanding the brusqueness of his manners, I have such an opinion of the old Knight's good sense and good nature, that I cannot readily acquit those he is offended with, as wholly free from blame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I subscribe to your censure, as far as it relates to myself; but the asperity of his behaviour to Lady Mary, renders me extremely unhappy; and not even my past obligations, or future prospects,
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
shall ever make me acquiesce in his treating my wife with disrespect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Allow me to say, Woodley, that persons so nearly connected, ought to dispense with ceremony, in favour of sincerity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a dangerous tenet, Colonel, and may be extended 'till downright rudeness may be considered but as the privilege of family-chat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you have no cause for such an appre∣hension, in this case, as Sir William is quite as singular for goodness of heart, as for a deficiency in that outward varnish which too often supplies the place of it. But to compound the argument, let us admit there may be faults on both sides.</P>

<P>Dear Woodley, I desire you will, on receipt of this, let me have the three hundred pieces you lost to me at our last Meeting, as I am just setting off for Newmarket, and must have some weight of metal to balance the scales on the turf. I shall wait at home for you exactly one hour, by the best going watch in Eu∣rope, and must have the cash by that time, pos.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>The peremptory stile of this billet alarms me! Knightly used to be a careless, liberal fellow; but Mountfort told me just now, that he is on the verge of ruin. His state, however, is to be envied, in com∣parison of mine. He falls alone. No wife, no family, at once to share and aggravate his wretched∣ness. I'll go this moment and acquit me of his de∣mand, by parting with these toys— <STAGE>(takes up the ear-rings).</STAGE> How much my Mary's beauty added to their lustre! Let me fly from the thought.</P>

<P>Just on the wing, my dear friend! How lucky thus to catch you flying, as it were!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>The good fortune is rather mine, Mr. Bromley.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; you compliment.—But where are the dear, the divine Ladies?—Mayn't I hope to be cheared with one glance from their bright eyes?—What a beautiful creature is Lady Mary!—Do you know she wants but little, very little, my dear friend, to be the top of the tree, the very para∣gon of fine taste and <HI>bon ton;</HI> and I think she will very soon acquire that little. My Dame has an ex∣cellent hand at touching up the last polish.</P>

<P>I allow Mrs. Bromley to be perfectly elegant.</P>

<P>No, no; there you are wrong.—She is pretty, lively, and so forth, but somewhat subsy, you know.—But Lady Mary, Lady Mary is the thing!—But what's here? <STAGE>(taking up the ear-rings)</STAGE>—A new purchase, I presume? They are fine, very fine, indeed! What now may the value be?—Some thousands, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>They did cost a pretty large sum, when they were bought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not new, then, I perceive—but fine, very fine, indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Mary don't quite like the fashion—the setting, I mean;—and therefore I should not be sorry to part with them—and buy others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE>
<P>O, that alters the case considerably! Let us see—let's see. Why now, upon examining them closely, they appear but middling, very mid∣dling, indeed. I don't wonder Lady Mary should not like them—no lustre—very old fashion'd—they'll sell for little or nothing, believe me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>They cost me fifteen hundred pounds, about four years ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fifteen hundred pounds!—You amaze me!—You must have been sadly imposed upon! very sadly, indeed, my dear friend! What monstrous cheats these tradesfolks are!—Why, these jewels, now, will not bring above three hundred.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's more than the common dispro∣portion between buying and selling, I should think, Mr. Bromley.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean in the Trade, Mr. Woodley. Among the Trade, diamonds are a drug, a mere drug, indeed: and money is a rare jewel in all trades now, I'll assure you. A Gentleman, or a friend, per∣haps, might give more. Come, for the frolic's sake, I'll turn jeweller myself, and offer you a cool five

hundred for them. What say you? Is it a bargain, Woodley?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(aside.</STAGE>
<P>I cannot bear the thought of carrying them abroad to sell!—Well, if you really think they are worth no more—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I have over-rated them; but I never compute by pounds, shillings, and pence, when dealing with a friend. Diamonds are, as I told you before, a mere drug; and cash, cash, my dear boy, your only valuable commodity. Here, here it is <STAGE>(looking in his pocket-book).</STAGE>—I have not quite so much about me, I find.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's unlucky <STAGE>(looking at his watch);</STAGE> for I want three hundred of it, this very instant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE>
<P>Does the wind sit in that point?—I'll see—I'll see. O! here is just the three hundred, cut and dry, my boy. You shall have the other two this evening at Boodle's. We'll cut a card, or throw a cast for it, or how you will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shan't go to Boodle's to-night—nor do I think I shall ever play again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE>
<P>The knowing-ones are taken in. I would not have given so much for the jewels, if I had thought so.—What, not play? That's good, very good, indeed! You have a sort of lover's quarrel to the dice, I perceive. But though they have, I confess, used you a little scurvily, they'll make you amends some other time. One lucky hit, you know, may repay all your losses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have so often, and so fatally de∣ceived me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you'll trust them again, for all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think not. But we shall meet at dinner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; I obey the dear, sweet Lady Mary's invitation. I shall bring the money with me. Besides, I recollect, that you and I have a little

matter of business to settle; but it shan't break in upon our pleasures, tho'. You shall have no trouble but just to set your name. A memorandum is all I want, my boy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a particular reason for desiring that you will not mention the transaction of the jewels to my wife, or even to yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Secret—secret as the grave, my dear friend—trusty as steel, my boy. You may always depend upon honest Bob Bromley. We shall be with you at five, tho' that's rather early <STAGE>(going).</STAGE>—Nay, no ceremony.</P>

<P>I have listened and pryed to good purpose, I think, and am thoroughly confirmed in my resolution of shifting my quarters, to-morrow morning. Up tents, and away, then! But I cannot help being a little concerned at leaving my master and Lady; because I am sure I shall never get so good a place again. All masters—no servants—every one did as he liked. It grieves me to think what a hand the rest of the servants have made of them. There's the lazy Housekeeper, the drunken Butler, the cribbing Coachman!—But what signifies moralizing! Let me look about me a little, and see if there be any small matters lying loose, that are of no farther use to my master, and may be of some to me.— <STAGE>(Takes up a pair of lace ruffles)</STAGE> These have been worn, but never washed, and he may miss them.

I'll answer for it that fellow now, is as idle, as dissipat∣ed, and extravagant, as my nephew himself. But why do I think of a man whose misconduct has so totally alienated my affections? Yet he was a sweet boy at Eton, and a fine youth at College. His in∣discreet marriage has ruined him—a fine Lady—a Lady of Quality, forsooth, and without a fortune to support her vanity. But, no matter now—I re∣nounce them both.—Waters!—I wish Louisa was removed from this scene of folly and extravagance, and safely settled in the country.

<STAGE><HI>Enter, at opposite doors, Mr.</HI> WOODLEY, <HI>and Mr.</HI> BELFORD.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>HOW truly do I rejoice to see my good friend Mr. Belford! But may I flat∣ter myself that the honour of this visit was intended for me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, my dear Sir, that there should be a necessity for discriminating the person to whom my respects are paid, in a family I so equal∣ly regard, and which was once so happily united.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>If indeed you regard this family, or ever had any friendship for me—But I cannot speak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am already apprized of your difficul∣ties, and would spare you the pain of even hinting at them, were it in my power to redress them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then be assured it is; for amidst all my distresses, nothing afflicts me half so much as Sir William's implacable resentment against Lady Mary and me. If he were but reconciled—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, in plain English, my young friend, if he could be reconciled to your expensive mode of living, he ought in honour to assist in sup∣porting it. But that, I doubt, will never be brought to pass, though Sir William is both rich and ge∣nerous—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>To all the world, but me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>In this case, then, you should suspect your own conduct, rather than his character.—But remonstrances are useless, now; and I promise to use my utmost interest to bring about a reconciliation.
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
But I much fear that we shall not be able to get Lady Mary included in the family-compact; for I know no man more resolute in what he conceives to be right, than Sir William.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>My honour, as well as my love, obliges me to vindicate her; and I here pledge them both, that she is free from blame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to find you still a lover, Mr. Woodley; but I who am but a friend, in this ques∣tion, can't help thinking, that if Lady Mary had spent more of her time in Dorsetshire, and less at Spa, Paris, and other places of dissipation and ex∣travagance, she would have been more entitled to Sir William's esteem, and you would have had less need of his assistance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fault was mine alone.—Vain of pos∣sessing such a treasure—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>You childishly exposed it to the gaze of fops and foreigners.—And let me tell you, Mr. Woodley, you are a lucky man, in these licentious times, to have preserved such a gem pure and entire, even at the expence of your other possessions. But, prithee, why don't you now retreat into the country?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>My wife is quite ignorant of my pre∣sent circumstances—I have not resolution to ac∣quaint her with them—and to propose quitting London, in this gay season, without assigning some cause—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would, in your situation, be extremely prudent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot bear the thought of giving her uneasiness—</P>
</SP>

<P>And so cruelly prefer the evil to the cure.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> WATERS.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Waters.</SPEAKER>
<P>I humbly beg your Honour's pardon for my intrusion, but I have been at your Chambers,
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
and at the Temple Coffee-house, to look for you. My master is quite impatient to see you, Sir, and one of Mr. Woodley's servants told me you were here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>This seems to fall out luckily. I will not detain you a moment. Dear Belford, remember what a cause you have in hand.</P>

<P>I cannot tell your Honour how proud I am to meet you. My good, dear master has been as angry with me for not finding you at home, as if I had committed the greatest of faults; and I would die rather than vex him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know my friend's hasty temper, per∣fectly well; but I also know that his good-nature is an over-match for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Waters.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir! you don't know how good and generous he is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are mistaken, Waters; I am no stranger to Sir William's benevolence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Waters.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, with submission you are;—for he takes as much pains to conceal his goodness, as others do to reveal theirs. He would never for∣give me if he knew I mentioned it; but my heart is so glad, I can't help telling your Honour that he apprenticed my eldest boy, last week, and pays for the schooling of the two youngest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are noble bounties, I confess, Waters; but I think your feelings on the occasion do as much honour to human nature, as the Knight's generosity;—for a liberal hand is more frequently to be met with, than a grateful heart.—But where is Sir William?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Waters.</SPEAKER>
<P>I left him going to take a turn in the garden, and I don't in the least doubt but he will come in as cool as a cucumber, tho' when he went

down stairs he was as angry with me, as if he had never done me any good.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember her at Paris—an over∣dressed Thing!—I thought she had been a Jeweller's wife, and looked upon her as a stalking shew-glass, to expose her husband's goods for sale. But the poor man, I suppose, was ruined by her extravagance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, he was <HI>done-up,</HI> very soon after. But the woman had wit in her madness, however; for she secreted her paraphernalia, and her chariot has rolled on her personal fortune, ever since. Women are much wiser, now-a-days, than they used to be.</P>

</SP>

<P>How idly you talk!—Mountfort is Louisa's Cecisbeo, and Sir Harry, I fancy, would be proud to enlist under your banner, in the same capacity.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, to be sure—quite lonely and discreet. Come, come, my dear Lady Mary, you were not designed for a simple Shepherdess:—the Sultana is your natural character—born to command, and be adored.

<P>You really talk like a wife of the last century.—Here's a fuss, indeed, about a poor hundred guineas! Do you know, now, that I would not have this story told of you, in any polite circle, for treble the sum.—If it should take wind, you'd be sneered to death with encomiums on your Lady∣ship's very uncommon prudence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I should not care to be thought
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
too prudent, neither; so I beg you'll not mention it to any one.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may rely on my friendship.—And now, my Dear, what jewels would you have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>You can't imagine how much distressed I am, upon this trifling subject. I'm resolved not to ask Mr Woodley for money, to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Borrow, then. You may com∣mand thousands, to my knowledge. Sir Harry is as rich as all Duke's Place, and I am sure he would be happy to lay all his treasures at your feet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Borrow money from Sir Harry Gran∣ger!—You cannot mean it!</P>
</SP>

<P>Ha, ha, ha! Sure never mortal was so easily taken-in, as my dear Lady Mary! You could not think me serious, I hope.—Not but I know many wives—</P>

<P>Who are a reproach to their Sex, perhaps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>No preaching, if you love me!—I shall get the jewels for you, on my own credit; for I am resolved that you shall not only be the loveliest, but the finest woman, in all that dear, gay, motley Assembly, to-night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, my dear Bromley.—I think the dress will become me.—But I owe you a monstrous deal of money, I'm afraid, already.—How much is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>A trifle, a very trifle, indeed, between such friends! and I shall be apt to quarrel with you, if ever you mention it again—let the men settle it.—I shall bring the jewels with me at five; 'till then, <HI>adio mia cara.</HI></P>

<P>It is amazing, Sir William, that you can be so anxious about this trifling game, and at the same time so indifferent about your nephew!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am in earnest about every thing, Mr. Belford; consequently, in my resentment against my silly nephew, who is a slave to his wife, and a victim to his vanity. Will you take the box, I say?</P>

<P>And yet you and I have been friends, these twenty years.</P>

<P>True, true, my dear Belford!—and, perhaps, I am indebted to your <HI>gently,</HI> for our conti∣nuing so.—But don't put my patience to any further trial, at present.—Sit down, I entreat you.</P>

<P>But one word more, and I have done.</P>

<P>You have a noble fortune, Sir William!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, thanks to Providence! more than I have occasion for myself, and therefore I consider the overplus but as a bank for my friends.—Do you want money, Belford? Name the sum, and take it.</P>

<P>What! at it again? I will not give him a doit—not a doit, Sir. My fortune shall not be lavished to indulge his vanity, or supply his prodigality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am persuaded he has so thoroughly re∣flected upon his past folly, that he would make a proper use of your future kindness.</P>
</SP>

<P>Let him alter his conduct, first, if he expects I should alter mine. His repentance may merit my bounty; but my liberality shall not pre∣vent his reformation.</P>

<P>But if Mr. Woodley should be undone, what will become of your niece?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let her share his fate, as she has done his folly—she has earned it.—An extravagant woman, that could not be content to live at one of the finest Seats in England, but must frisk it to Spa and Paris, forsooth, like the rest of the silly English, to squander their money, and be laughed at by Foreigners!</P>

<P>Do you intend she shall live with you?</P>

<P>If I had not the greatest regard ima∣ginable for my old friend, I should hate him abominably, for always beating me at backgammon. But let me consider, now—She has ten thousand pounds of her own. I will give her as much more, at present, and my whole estate, after my death.—No, no,—that won't be acting justly—Woodley may have children—They have not offended me, though their father has;—and if they should be half so pleasant as he was when he was a child, I should love them dearly, as I once did him.

<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I AM no drinking man myself, Belford; but yet I do not approve of this water system of yours. It keeps the spirits too low—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>To say or do any thing mad or foolish, I grant it may. But if water does not raise, it never depresses the spirits. Can you say as much for your generous wine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I won't dispute with you, because I hate argument; and as you are an honest fellow, I can venture to take my glass chearfully in your company, tho' you don't partake of my liquor. But I'd give something, ay, more than I'll mention, that you'd share only one pint of claret with me, now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have made no vows, Sir William; and to humour a friend can easily dispense with rules of my own making: So here's your fair niece, Louisa Woodley, in a bumper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, thank you, my good friend! She is a most excellent girl, and I like to have her toasted by such a man as you. I wish she was well settled, with all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>There can be no doubt of her marrying to advantage. She is a fine young woman, with a fine fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so may be sacrificed to some fine young man, that may spend her fortune in finery, as her hopeful brother has done, and leave her a beg∣gar.
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
No, no,—I'll prevent that—I have thought of a match for her—Fill your glass, Belford!—a prudent, sober, sensible man.— <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE> I wish he'd take the hint.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who told you that he was a <HI>young man of fashion?</HI> Why, Sir, there have been no <HI>men</HI> born, at least, for these last thirty years—all monkies and macaronies. No Hearts of Oak, now, Belford,—all dwindled, dwindled into aspens!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your sarcasm is rather too general, my good friend. Courage is the birth-right of an Englishman, and while one acre of our soil remains, both the Oak and the Laurel will thrive on it.—We must not prejudge the rising generation; and I have not the least doubt but your niece will make a very proper choice.</P>

<P>A choice! I hope she has been better educated, than to have a choice, Sir. I was not consulted in her brother's match, and you see the consequence.—I shall dispose of Louisa in my own way.—I have a husband now in my eye for her, Belford.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whoever obtains Miss Woodley, will, I dare say, be a very happy man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stick to that, my dear Belford.—Yes, yes, whoever marries Louisa will be a very happy man, and I am extremely glad you think so.— <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE> I wish he'd come to the point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Sir William, that I have long been acquainted with Miss Woodley's merit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>You charm me, my dear Belford. I am glad you know her worth, and you will therefore cherish it.—She is mild and timid—but you'll be kind and gentle to her, even for my sake, my good old friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Kind and gentle to her!</HI> and your <HI>good old friend!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, are not you my friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why all this reiteration? If you marry Louisa—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I marry her, Sir William!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir—Did you not, this moment, allow that who ever married her, would be a very happy man? And I suppose, you can have no possible objection to being a very happy man, Mr. Belford?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, the strongest in the world, if my happiness is to be purchased at the expence of another's misery.—But I am wrong for being serious, when I am certain you do but jest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place, Sir, I never said any thing in jest, since I was born.—And, secondly, Sir, I never was more in earnest, in the whole course of my life. I therefore request from you a serious answer.—Jest, indeed! No, truly, Counsellor, I am no joker.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then, Sir, I should think myself highly honoured—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha, psha, psha—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Patience, my good friend—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir—I will have no patience with your nonsensical compliments—none of your ho∣nours, I say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a word, then, Sir William, the disparity of years between forty-eight and eigh∣teen—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is just nothing at all.—What need you tell her you are forty-eight?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>There will be no occasion, I grant you—Self-evident propositions need no proof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hark'ye, Belford, you fatigue me to death with your logic and sophistry.—The point
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
may be reduced to two words,—Will you marry my niece, or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a match so infinitely beyond my pretensions, Sir William—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I may be allowed the best judge in that matter, Mr. Belford.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, Sir William, your partial kindness towards me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is almost worn out, by your tiresome, false modesty;—and, if I thought I should have as much plague with Louisa, as I have had with you, I'd renounce my project, and leave her to die an old maid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>The proposal is so highly favourable to me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were I certain that Miss Woodley's inclinations—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you, before, that I could dis∣pose of them as I pleased; so that if you have no other objection, I shall carry my point, and settle one of my family to my entire satisfaction, at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is impossible that I can have any objection, if she has none.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your hand then, my dear Belford—'Tis a match.—Order your clerks to set about the writings directly.—Your estate lies in Staffordshire, I think.—You know I add ten thousand to her fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>But surely, my dear Sir William, Miss Woodley ought to be made acquainted—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, has she not been acquainted with you ever since she was born? If I mistake not, you were present at her christening.—The wedding shall be next week—The sooner my dear girl is happily settled, the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your kindness overwhelms me—but still, Miss Woodley—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall be made acquainted with her happiness, this evening. I leave all the articles of settlement to your own honour.—I know you'll make a proper provision for my niece, because it is pos∣sible you may die before her—but no pin-money, I charge you—'Tis but a prelude to alimony, believe me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall endeavour to acquit myself as such a generous confidence deserves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hurry, hurry your clerks, and bring this happy event to a speedy conclusion, my dear nephew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have the strongest motives to enforce their diligence, as well as the highest sense of my obligations to your friendship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>No speeches—hasten the business, and adieu.— <STAGE><HI>[Exit</HI> Belford.]</STAGE>—I'll speak to Jones, direct∣ly, to prepare for the wedding-dinner. She can't bear to be hurried; and I'd have every thing mag∣nificent on that day, which I shall deem the happiest of my whole life; because it will be the first time I could ever get any of my family to know their own interest, and act as I would have them.</P>
<STAGE>(going off)</STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Louisa.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad to see you, my dear child.—And now what have you to say to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was informed, Sir, by my sister, that you desired to speak with me, and I am therefore come to receive your commands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my dear, it will neither be ques∣tions nor commands, but cross-purposes, if you keep at such a distance as will make it impossible we should hear one another. Come nearer, I say—What are you afraid of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(advancing.)</STAGE>
<P>Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, so—that will do.—And now, my dear child, you can't imagine what a heavenly tem∣per
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
I am in, and what favourable dispositions I have towards you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very happy, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you'll say, my dear, when you know all. But you must deserve my kindness, by your frankness;—therefore, first tell me, whether you have any particular objection to matrimony?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a subject, Sir, that I have never much thought upon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's singular, now; for I am told that the girls of these days think of nothing else. But, luckily, there is no occasion for your considering about the matter, as you have such a friend as I am to consider for you, child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so I shall make your mind easy at once, by letting you know that I have provided a husband for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> Now, Heaven forbid!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>And such a one as is not to be met with every day, I assure you—a man after my own heart—has not a fault, Louisa, but that he is a water-drinker. But I won't anticipate, by telling you his name. He shall surprise you with it him∣self.—Why, hey!—what's the matter now? You don't seem at all overjoyed!—You are not hankering after a title, I hope; for, believe me, niece, if there be either happiness or virtue left in the present world, they are only to be met with in the middle ranks of life. What makes you tremble so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are not unacquainted with my ti∣midity, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I understand the timidity of your whole sex— <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> Doves before mar∣riage, and Kites after.—You'll soon get the bet∣ter of your timidity, I'll answer for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I am certain, Sir, that 'tis your wish to make me happy—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right, my dear; but it must be my own way. Your brother's want of respect to my opinion, you see, has been his ruin, child. Don't attempt to copy him, Louisa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you would but condescend to hear me, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, child, I know every thing already, that you would wish to say. Your obligations to me, and your modesty, and your timidity, and your settlement, and all that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, I have not a thought about a settlement—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, every thing shall be taken care of, except a provision for a separate mainte∣nance. I bar that; for if you can't live happily with such a husband as I have chosen for you, I should think you deserved to starve, tho' you were my niece a thousand times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear uncle—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear niece, don't insist upon it; for a woman who thinks of separation at the moment of her union, does not intend to abide by her husband, as she ought to do, 'till death do them part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I neither think of union nor separation, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Modest and virtuous that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me but one word, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough's said, enough's said, my dear. Here, take this bill, to provide for your dress. I'd have every thing handsome. The ladies are great belles in Staffordshire; and I'd have my niece make as good an appearnace as any <HI>private gentlewoman</HI> among them. Why don't you take the bill? 'Tis for five hundred pounds, and I hope you think that sufficient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no sort of occasion for it, Sir; and if you would but indulge me with a moment's conversation—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha, psha, psha,—I hate all this af∣fected delicacy. Take money from the old man whenever you can get it. Hasten your milliners and mantua-makers, and get all your matters ready by this day se'nnight, for I won't have the wedding de∣ferred an hour longer. Delays are ever dangerous.</P>
<STAGE>(Exit, throwing the bill on the table.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, in the name of wonder, can this dear, kind, cruel uncle of mine intend for me? I almost doubt whether I wake or not. Married in a week, to a man perhaps I never saw! No, that's impossible—he is too good to think of such an union. Possibly Mountfort may have applied for his consent, before he asked mine!—Too fond a hope, I fear.—I wish I could see Counsellor Belford; my uncle keeps no secret from him, and he is a friend to all our fa∣mily. I'll write to him to come to me instantly.</P>
<STAGE>(fits down to the table.)</STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mr.</HI> Belford, <HI>without seeing</HI> Louisa.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot proceed on this business, in earnest, till Sir William has had some conference with his niece. It is possible she may dislike the match, or perhaps be otherwise engaged—and then I should become the standing jest of all my brother Benchers. I must speak to Sir William again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good Mr. Belford, I never was so glad to see you in my whole life. I have been this moment writing to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>You make me the happiest of mortals, Madam.— <STAGE>(aside</STAGE> This Brief opens well! I need not be much afraid of being laughed at now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>There is something so particular— <STAGE>(aside</STAGE> I know not how to mention it—Mr. Belford, my good uncle has—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find completed his kindness, and ac∣quainted you, Madam—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="40" REF="46"/>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, but as you share his confidence, I must entreat that you'll inform me— <STAGE>(besitates)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(aside)</STAGE> Her modesty distresses me vastly; but I like her the better for it! I wish I had a speech ready.—Did not Sir William, Madam, say any thing of matrimony to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You can't imagine, Sir, how he has sur∣prised and terrified me, by talking of my being to be married in a week.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>You might be surprised, to be sure, Ma∣dam; but I don't see any occasion for your being terrified, any more than for such a violent hurry. The writings can't be properly engrossed in that time. The Law seldom keeps pace with a Lover's wishes;—and however impatient I may be to expedite this business, you shall not be hurried, fair Lady, but be at liberty to name your own day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It shall be Doomsday, then—However, I thank you, Sir, for allowing me even a reprieve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(aside)</STAGE> Hey-dey! Where sits the wind now?—You have no absolute aversion to marriage, I hope, Miss Woodley?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I despise affectation, Sir, and am above disguise, with an old friend like you:—I have no aversion to marriage, when I can bestow my hand with my heart;—but I would rather die, than be sa∣crificed to a frightful fordid wretch, who has tre∣panned my uncle out of his consent, because he de∣spaired of mine, and takes me merely as an appen∣dage to my fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(aside)</STAGE> How lucky was my coming back!—But why should you suppose, Madam, that your uncle would <HI>sacrifice you to a frightful sordid wretch?</HI> Your intended husband is a very different kind of man, I'll assure you, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let him be what he will, Sir, I shall de∣test him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never thought, Miss Woodley, that my conduct or character had in any instance merit∣ed your detestation, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Detest you, Mr. Belford! No, that's impossible!—But how are you concerned in the mat∣ter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not much, at present, Madam;—for I scorn to take advantage of your uncle's engagements, unless ratified by your consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Mr. Belford!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, never whimper about it. I own, I suspected, from the first, that it was rather too good news to be true:—but don't make yourself unhappy, Miss Woodley; for I would rather live and die a batchelor, than marry the finest woman in England, as is now the case <STAGE>(bowing),</STAGE> who was not equally ready <HI>to have and to hold.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generous, worthy man!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not more generous than prudent, Ma∣dam, on this occasion. But, as I hope I have now deserved your confidence, Miss Woodley, tell me then, if you have any particular attachment, and I shall endeavour to serve you with Sir William;—though I know I shall, for a time, stand in the light of a culprit before him, by declining the honour he intended me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You overpower me with obligations, Mr. Belford.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>No speeches, my dear Madam. If I was not sufficiently gratified by the honour of the act, no acknowledgements could make me amends for the disappointment; so frankly name the hap∣py man who is to raise my envy, and compleat your happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though I think that a well-placed and mutual affection need not raise a blush upon the chastest cheek, yet mine will glow when I name Co∣lonel Mountfort.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because he's a very pretty fellow, Ma∣dam, and for that reason may fall within your un∣cle's chapter of coxcombs, and prevent his consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I shall never give mine to marry any man else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's somewhat in the Knight's own stile, Miss Woodley. But I heartily wish you suc∣cess, and shall shew myself a warmer Friend than a Lover, by using my best pleadings in my rival's suit.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I consider all compulsive obligations be∣tween men as a disgrace to human nature. But while there are such things as knaves in the world, Mr. Bromley, we must submit to the mean securities of bars and bonds. But between men of honour, as you say—</P>

<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>

<P>Yes, with pleasure, through my whole re∣giment, with a drum at your heels. I am persuaded, Woodley, that fellow is a knave, and I wish you would exclude both him and his flaunting wife from your's and Lady Mary's society. I can't con∣ceive why you are so partial to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>The great civilities we received from them, at Spa, first attached my wife to Mrs. Brom∣ley, who was there in the first sets, and even in Lon∣don, where people are more nice. She keeps very good company, I assure you, Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll pardon me, Woodley!—She is seldom seen in public but with some damaged Dowager of Quality, who would be excluded from society if her title did not serve as a herald to make way for her Ladyship.—But enough of them! I am come to speak to you on a much more interesting subject,

<P>You consent to mine. Is it so, my friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not how to answer you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>You alarm me extremely, Mr. Woodley! For heaven's sake, speak out!—What can be your objections?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>None in the world, to you; but cir∣cumstanced as I am at present, it would involve me in the greatest difficulties, to be called upon so sud∣denly for ten thousand pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>That shall not be the case, Woodley. I should think even Louisa too dearly purchased, at the expence of distressing you. When I asked for your sister's hand, I did not demand her purse; nor shall I accept the one, 'till I have signed a release for the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mountfort, that must not, shall not be! I never will accept of such a sacrifice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hark-ye, Woodley! A soldier's character should be uniform; and if there could be one who was not liberal, I should suspect his courage to be of the mere animal kind. My fortune is sufficiently ample; and I would as soon mount my charger, cry stand and deliver, as take money I don't want, from a friend who does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your generosity, Colonel—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="46" REF="52"/>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is of too selfish a nature to merit praise; for I feel here <STAGE>(laying his hand to his heart)</STAGE> that the true luxury of fortune lies more in giving, than in spending.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not lessen it, by offering thanks. But have you opened your trenches before the Knight of the Castle yet? <STAGE>(pointing to the middle door)</STAGE> He used to speak well of you, and his opinion is of some consequence in this business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My sentiments are even with the good old Knight's, I assure you. I esteem his good qualities, and do not dislike even his foibles, as they are truly natural and unsophisticate. But there, perhaps, you may see me play the usurer, like any Jew. He may double or treble Louisa's fortune, without the least impediment from any scruple or modesty of mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>When do you purpose to make the essay?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>As soon as possible; for 'till I have paid the proper respect due to him, I do not think myself entitled to throw myself at Louisa's feet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>May success attend you, my generous friend!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND so that was all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every word, I assure you. But we shall soon make it up, for ours are but lovers' quarrels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lovers! talk of love after four years marriage! Believe me, Lady Mary, 'tis all a farce.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear Mrs. Bromley, I cannot give you credit against the feelings of my own heart. I love Mr. Woodley, and I am firmly per∣suaded that he has a sincere affection for me, not∣withstanding the little peevishness of his behaviour to-day, which I own makes me apprehend that something must have ruffled him extremely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>How did you like his peremptory resolve, of passing the whole summer in Dorset∣shire?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, I confess; 'tis frightful to think of it—though there is a tolerable neighbour∣hood—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of empty houses.—No creature stays at their family seats, now-a-days, unless it be some antiquated Dowager, who, like an old Gothic corner cupboard, remains fixed to the freehold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>I vow I won't go into the country—'tis quite <HI>mauvais ton—</HI>except you'll come with us; and then we'll fly about to all the bathing-places, and give a masquerade at one of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="54"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should like to pass a few weeks so, well enough;—and, indeed, my dear, you'll be quite forgotten, if you don't do something in that way. But are you sure that Mr. Woodley would like it? for I must say, though I ask your pardon, Lady Mary, he is dull—absolutely dull, indeed, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I own, of late he has been rather gloomy;—but he is vastly good-natured, and never before refused any request of mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be:—but had Mr. Bromley talked to me in the same manner—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would have loved him just as well as you do now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are admirable at guessing, my dear;—for as that same romantic notion of love never was the band of our connexion—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>You startle me, Mrs. Bromley. Mar∣riage without love must surely be a state of the greatest unhappiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I don't feel in the least unhappy.—Convenience is the best matrimonial cement, and keeps many couples together for years, whose love did not out-last the honey-moon.—But these are mysteries, into which you seem not yet initiated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Then I would not give sixpence for the whole story.</P>

<P>Counsellor Belford.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is that all? I think it a monstrous good match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Monstrous, indeed!—Why, he's fifty, at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fifty! fiddle-stick! What does that signify? He is rich enough for threescore; and money, money, my dear, qualifies all dis∣proportions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is by much too serious a subject for jesting, Mrs. Bromley.—But Sir William is not your sole Guardian, Louisa; and your brother, I am certain, will never consent to sacrifice you to his uncle's caprice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not, on any account, my dear sister, have my brother oppose Sir William in any thing, as he is already but too much offended with him. Besides, I am in hopes that there will not be any occasion for his interposing.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(aside)</STAGE>
<P>I'm glad of the release.—What now can he possibly want with me? But I am all obedience, though it breaks my heart to leave you.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank Heaven, I am not!—She is levity itself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her lightness, Louisa, extends no farther than her manners:—her morals are irre∣proachable; and when the mind is untainted, its gaiety, like a coloured trimming to a grave suit, serves only to enliven it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are too partial, sister; for I much fear that you will one day discover Mrs. Bromley's manners and morals to be <HI>both of a piece.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more upon the subject, at pre∣sent!—and in truth I wonder how you can have spirits to talk of any thing else but your own melan∣choly situation.—Married to Belford! to your Grandfather!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be sad, indeed, if such a marriage was to take place;—but my <HI>Intended</HI> has generously consented to break off the match, at my request, and to screen me from Sir William's displeasure, at the same time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then the old Barrister is charming, and I think I could be a little in love with him myself. But I cannot submit to this new insult from Sir William! What could he mean by dis∣posing of you without deigning to consult Mr. Woodley? I shall insist upon an explanation of his conduct.</P>

<P>I again intreat you, Lady Mary, not to involve my brother farther with Sir William—you do not know the consequences.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am quite weary of all this temporiz∣ing, Louisa; and as you are safe on shore, you must allow me to guide the helm for myself, at present.—You'll permit me, at least, to acquaint Mr. Woodley with his uncle's contemptuous neglect of him in this matter, which I shall go and do directly.</P>

<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, Sir!—I fancy, indeed, I do look tolerably well, for serenity of mind goes a great way towards clearing up the countenance; and I do not know when my spirits have ever been so harmo∣nized, as at this moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(aside)</STAGE>
<P>How fortunate!—May I flatter myself, Sir William, that the present happy temper of your mind will assist my suit, and render you propitious!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Propitious! Nonsense.—You are an idle young rogue!—With such a noble fortune as yours—But I won't scold, now.—You have been on the Turf, I suppose, or fleeced at the Gaming-table?—But I hope the <HI>Terra Firma</HI> is safe. I should be grieved to see my old friend's estate in the hands of knaves or sharpers.—What sum do you want? I know you to be a man of honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>You quite amaze me, Sir, by suspicions which, I will be bold to say, are unworthy both of Sir William Woodley and me. I am no gam∣bler, Sir, nor have I dissipated the noble inheri∣tance derived from my ancestors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am heartily glad of it, Sir!—I ask your pardon, young man.— <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE> What the deuce, then, can he want from me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I were so unfortunately weak, as you for a moment seemed to imagine, the respect I bear you, would have prevented my applying to you upon such an occasion, as your good opinion, Sir, is of the greatest consequence to my happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you are wrong, Colonel;—you had much better apply to me, than to any one else.—I am no cent. per cent. man—I never received a shilling interest from any friend in my life; and I have my doubts whether I should even take it from the Funds, now that the Nation is so poor.—But come, Colonel, if you don't want money, in what other way can I possibly serve you? I have no in∣terest at Court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Married, Sir William!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir,—married, and settled in the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>This raillery is rather cruel, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never joke, Sir.—I have passed my word that she shall be married this day se'nnight; and if all the Emperors, Kings, Princes, and Po∣tentates in Europe, nay the Great Mogul himself, were to demand her in marriage, William Woodley would not forfeit his promise: so that married she is, to all intents and purposes, my gay Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>And has Miss Woodley consented, Sir?</P>

<P>If you could conceive the tenderness of my affection for Miss Woodley, Sir, you would not treat my sufferings so slightly.</P>

<P>It may be a disappointment, to be sure, Sir, for she is a fine young woman, I confess; but my friend has her, Sir, and you must think of her no more.</P>

<PB N="54" REF="60"/>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not in my power to obey your injunc∣tion.— <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE> I wish it were, false and ungrateful girl!—But pray, Sir, who is the envied man so doubly blessed in your friendship and Miss Wood∣ley's love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a secret, Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, I think, I have a right to know, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! you want to exercise your va∣lour a little—sa, sa, sa,—by challenging your ri∣val? But keep your prowess for the common foe: we cannot spare a soldier, at present, Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>This treatment is unlike yourself, Sir Wil∣liam. But Miss Woodley, I suppose, will inform me;—I presume she is not bound to keep the secret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you are wrong again, my young hero; for she really is bound by the strongest of all possible ties—the not knowing it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You cannot now be serious, Sir; and I will try if I have yet power enough over Louisa's heart to make her so—for I will know my rival. Adieu, Sir William!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your servant, Colonel Huff-Cap. What a hot-brained boy! I am doubly glad Louisa has escaped him:—I would have no passionate man in the family, but myself. How lucky 'tis that Louisa does not know her husband's name!—Wo∣men should ever be kept in ignorance, to prevent mischief. I have conducted this business most ad∣mirably!—I have some doubts, however, whether my nephew should not be made acquainted with it; but he does not deserve my confidence, and he shan't vex me now.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mr.</HI> BELFORD. <HI>Sir</HI> WILLIAM <HI>runs and em∣braces him.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Are all things going on briskly and cleverly, as they should do, my dear nephew?</P>

<P>Well, well, we must submit; but I hope you'll use as much dispatch as possible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Dispatch</HI> is a term, Sir, not to be found in any Law Dictionary that I know of; and I fancy it will be a long time before the matters you talk of will be dispatched.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, surely you have a mind to try my temper, with your fair and softly! But if you knew as much as I do, you would, perhaps, think it worth while to mend your pace a little; for <Q>many things fall out between the cup and lip,</Q> Mr. Belford.</P>
</SP>

<STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE>
<P>So you'll find presently.—The most material point in this important affair does not appear to be yet adjusted.</P>

<P>Now—what can he mean?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>There can be no marriage without the consent of parties; and I don't find that Miss Woodley—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I was not in the most heavenly tem∣per, you would put me in a rage. Have I not told you, Sir, that she had no consent, no choice, but what I please to give? And in twenty years ac∣quaintance, have you ever known me say an untruth, Sir? My niece is all compliance and gentleness; and you'll be a very happy man, my dear nephew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be unworthy of happiness, if I could enjoy it on such terms, Sir William.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what's the matter, Belford?—Your head seems to be turned with your good for∣tune, and you want to turn mine. No man that is unworthy can be happy—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>In short, Sir William—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, that's the thing—now you talk sense! I like <HI>in short—</HI>stick to that, my friend. If

you want more clerks, don't value expence, I'll clear all costs—You know I hate the Law's delay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>No law, but that of honour, has any thing to do in this case, Sir William; and however irksome the task, I must beg you will per∣mit me to undeceive you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you acknowledge you have de∣ceived me? I am thunder-struck!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my good friend—'tis you that have deceived yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your proposition is false, Sir. I never deceived myself, nor any one else, since I was born, Sir. I scorn and abhor deceit, Mr. Belford. But come, Sir, let me know what all this round-about tends to? Despise the chicanery of your profession, and speak as if you was a witness on the table—not a Lawyer at the bar, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear I shall rather appear a criminal at the bar to you, at present, Sir William.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, then, you are married, I suppose?—have a wife already? Nay, don't smile, Sir, there is no joke in this matter; and you ought to have been hanged, if you had married my niece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think so too, though not upon the ac∣count you mention, as I give you my honour I have no wife; and if I continue in my present mood, may venture to say that I never shall have one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mighty well, mighty ill, Mr. Belford! You have rewarded my sincere friendly attachment—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>With true gratitude, Sir.</P>
</SP>

<P>Don't offer to say so. What! to spurn my niece with twenty thousand pounds! Let me tell you, Sir—</P>

<P>I rejoice, therefore, my dear friend—</P>

<P>I should have much more to answer for to Miss Woodley, Sir William, if I did not decline the match.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Money, child! I have never touch∣ed above a thousand pounds of their cash yet. This piece of paper is all I have got for spending my time with a dull fool, and endeavouring to persuade him that he was a Solomon, and his silly wife the Queen of Sheba. But I must be paid for my attendance and trouble, and in a few minutes I shall convert this manuscript into the sum of seven thousand three hundred and fifty-three pounds, with costs—costs must be added.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can have no objection to your being paid for your time and trouble, my dear. All I desire is, that you may not lay on the execution 'till to-morrow. Let us devote this evening to pleasure, my dear Brommy. I am to play gold Loo to-night, and I have a certain <HI>presentiment</HI> that I shall win considerably.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Bromley.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to your winning, I believe you are pretty secure in that point. You don't leave much to chance, I imagine, my dove. But tho' you might win, I shall lose considerably, if this bond be not put in force this very night. I have been with Woodley's attorney, Mr. Fleece'em, a very ho∣nest man, and for a small token of friendship, he has informed me, that there will be six executions in the house to morrow.</P>
