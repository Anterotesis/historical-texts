<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Publisher of the present Volumes has long observed with sur∣prize the total neglect shewn to the Works of Mr. GARRICK. Though six years are now elapsed since his death, no one step has been taken towards giving an edition of them. Neither gratitude, friendship, affection, nor interest have in the slightest manner interposed. His pieces have been suffered to remain in the same state in which the Author left them, a prey to time; subject to every accident; and, as it should seem, doomed in a few years to be buried in oblivion.</P>
<P>The Author, careless and indifferent about his smaller productions, dispersed them in such a variety of publications,
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
that, had he been now living, he would probably have found some difficulty in assembling them together, or even, with∣out assistance, to recollect them. This difficulty is encreasing every day. By the death of friends; by the forgetful∣ness of contemporaries; and by the loss of fugitive pieces, a compleat collection of them (already a task not easy to be accomplished) will in a few years be∣come impossible.</P>
<P>It is a consideration which may not be thought very honourable to human na∣ture, that a man who contributed as much as any one of his time to the inno∣cent amusement of life; whose perform∣ances on the stage must be always remem∣bered with delight by those who had the happiness of seeing them; who had both the inclination and ability to confer fa∣vours; who le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t behind him many living memorials of his friendship and genero∣sity; and whose death, as has been truly
<PB N="v" REF="6"/>
said, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"eclipsed the gaiety of nations, and impoverished the publick stock of innocent pleasure,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Johnson's Life of Edmund Smith.</NOTE></Q> should hitherto have found no person attentive to the calls of respect, no one alive to the re∣monstrances of gratitude, to erect a mo∣nument to his fame, by collecting and publishing his fugitive performances.</P>
<P>Abandoned and neglected as these have been, both by their Author and his Representatives, the Publisher has been prevailed upon to sollicit the assistance of many of Mr. Garrick's friends, and by their aid he has been enabled to present to the Publick a collection which has been long enquired after, and which, from the care with which it has been formed, he trusts will not disgrace the memory of the Author. Should the sources from whence the several pieces have been drawn be enumerated, he is certain that he should be allowed some
<PB N="vi" REF="7"/>
merit from his industry, as almost every performance has been selected from a different publication, most of them very difficult to be procured, and some, from their scarcity, equal in value to manu∣scripts.</P>
<P>It would be impertinent to take up the Reader's time in recommending what has been so long and so universally ap∣proved. Mr. Garrick's writings do not want any such assistance. Their merit has been already fully acknowledged, and require only to be more diffused, to be more applauded. They are here classed in some measure according to their subjects, and for the most part in chronological order. By this means the Prologues and Epilogues, which gene∣rally turn on the fashions or incidents of the day, will serve to illustrate and keep in memory the foibles, virtues, vices and habits of the times, and exhibit no un∣faithful picture of the good sense or folly
<PB N="vii" REF="8"/>
which has prevailed heretofore, compared with the present or any future period.</P>
<P>To render the present edition as com∣pleat as possible, the Publisher has added a short Account of Mr. Garrick's Life and Writings; together with two Lists, one of his Dramatick Works, and the other of the characters he performed. Both these he is informed are compiled with accuracy, and will be allowed to have their use. To them he has sub∣joined Mr. Sheridan's elegant Monody; a composition which is entitled to equal praise in the closet that it was honoured with on the Theatre. To conclude: he feels some satisfaction in reflecting, that through his endeavours the Works and literary fame of Mr. Garrick will be re∣deemed from that fate into which a few years more would have involved so excel∣lent a writer and so valuable a man.</P>

<HEAD>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF DAVID GARRICK, Esq.</HEAD>
<HEAD><PB N="xi" REF="10"/>A SHORT ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>DAVID GARRICK was born at Here∣ford, about the month of February, 1716. His grandfather was a merchant of French ex∣traction, as it is said, who left his native country on the revocation of the edict of Nantz in the year 1685. This gentleman had two sons and two daughters: one of the former became a wine-merchant at Lisbon; and the other, whose name was Peter, the father of the late Mr. Garrick, followed the military profession, and had at the time of his death been advanced to a majority in the army. He mar∣ried a daughter of Mr. Clough, one of the Vicars in Litchfield Cathedral, and happened to be quartered at the Angel-inn in Hereford, where his son David (who was baptized<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following is an extract from the register book of the parish of All Saints in the City of Hereford: <Q REND="inline">"David Gar∣rick, the son of Peter and Arabella Garrick, was baptized the 28th of February, 1716."</Q></P>
<P>It is remarkable, that the late Mr. Powell was also born in the city of Hereford.</P></NOTE> the
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
28th of February 1716) was born. Mr. Gar∣rick, the father, afterwards settled at Litchfield, and resided there several years. A short time before his death he determined to sell his com∣mission, and for that purpose entered into a treaty with a gentleman who had agreed to give him 1100l. for it; but, unfortunately, before the sale was completed he died, and left a numerous family in a great measure unprovided for.</P>
<P>His son David received the first part of his education at the free school of Litchfield under Mr. Hunter, who had the honour of number∣ing amongst his scholars, Doctor Johnson, Chief Justice Willes, Doctor Newton, Bishop of Bristol, and other men of eminence. Very early in life our Roscius found a friend in Gil∣bert Walmsley, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> register of the eccle∣siastical court there; a gentleman then unmar∣ried and well advanced in years, whose partia∣lity seemed to authorise some favourable expec∣tations of a permanent provision; all which were destroyed by Mr. Walmsley's unexpect∣edly taking a wife. He, however, recom∣mended his young friend to Mr. Colson, master of the academy at Rochester, in order to com∣pleat his education; and accordingly, in the month of March, 1736, Mr. Garrick left
<PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>
Litchfield, in company with Doctor Samuel Johnson<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A character of Mr. Walmsley (who died August 3, 1751, aged 69) is given by Doctor Johnson, n his elegant life of Ed∣mund Smith, which accompanies "The works of the English Poets." The following epitaph was written on him by Mr. Seward.<Q><LG TYPE="epitaph">
<LG>
<L>READER, if science, honour, reason, charm;</L>
<L>If social charities thy bosom warm;</L>
<L>If smiling bounty ope thy heart and door;</L>

<L>Firm to Britannia's prince, and church, and laws,</L>
<L>If freedom fire thee in thy country's cause;</L>
<L>With sympathetic love these relicks see,</L>
<L>But think not Walmsley dead—he lives in thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if, regardless of strong reason's voice,</L>
<L>In wine, and noise, and faction, thou rejoice;</L>

<L>If Briton born, thy soul's a Gallick slave;</L>
<L>Start from his tomb he would—and call thee—"Fool and knave."</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q></P>

<P>Mr. Walmsley translated into Latin—Doctor Byrom's cele∣brated song, beginning <Q REND="inline">"My time, Oye muses,"</Q> &amp;c. It is in the <HI>Gentleman's Magazine,</HI> February 1745.</P></NOTE>, who at the same time quitted his profession of a schoolmaster, and came to Lon∣don, where he afterwards became one of the first ornaments of literature.</P>
<P>At the age of about eleven years, Mr. Gar∣rick went over to Lisbon, and was received by his uncle with great kindness; but, that strict∣ness of morals which a fond relation wished to
<PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>
see in his nephew not being observed at that place, to prevent his being corrupted, it was thought proper to send him back to England; his uncle still preserving a great regard for him, which he shewed at his death by leaving him a legacy of 1000l.</P>
<P>It appears from Mr. <HI>Walmsley's</HI> letters, that Mr. Garrick was intended for the profession of the law; and accordingly, on the 9th day of March 1736<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Play-house Dictionary.</NOTE>, immediately on his arrival in London, he was entered of the society of Lincoln's-Inn; but it is certain he never paid any attention to the study of that science; and indeed it is within the memory of many yet liv∣ing, that his employment for a short time, in the interval between his leaving school and his appearance on the stage, was of a nature very different from what he was first destined to, and what he afterwards pursued with so much repu∣tation and success. We are credibly informed that he followed the business of a wine-mer∣chant somewhere in or near Durham-yard, be∣ing induced thereto, it may be presumed, by the encouragement and support of his uncle.</P>
<P>To whatever cause it was owing, we are not informed; but his success in business was not sufficient to engage his continuance in it; and
<PB N="xv" REF="14"/>
this want of success might perhaps arise from his attention to a more pleasing pursuit. He had at school performed the part of Serjeant Kite with applause; and he was now prompted to employ the talents which he possessed for his immediate support. Chetwood mentions, that his facetious good humour gained him entrance behind the scenes two or three years in Drury-lane, before he commenced actor, and it is certain that he produced there, his first drama called Lethe, in April, 1740, for Mr. Giffard's Benefit. Determining to try his for∣tune on the stage, he went down to <HI>Ipswich,</HI> under the name of Lyddel, and performed in a strolling company there. The part in which he first appeared was that of Aboan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the information of a contemporary comedian.</NOTE> in Oroo∣noko; and the approbation he met with in this country excursion encouraged him to pursue his plan in London. He, therefore, after being (as it is reported) rejected by the manager of Covent Garden, to whom he had offered his service, engaged with Mr. Giffard, at the theatre in Goodman's Fields, in the year 1741. The character he then attempted was that of Richard the Third; and he performed it Octo∣ber 19th, 1741, in a manner which fixed his re∣putation
<PB N="xvi" REF="15"/>
on that basis upon which it stood, as the first actor of the times, during the rest of his life. Two circumstances were observed on his first night's performance; one, that, on his entrance on the stage, he was under so much embarrassment, that for some time he was un∣able to speak: the other, that, having exerted himself with much vehemence in the first two acts, he became so hoarse as to be almost inca∣pable of finishing the character. This diffi∣culty was obviated by a person behind the scenes recommending him to take the juice of a Seville orange, which he fortunately had in his pocket, and which enabled him to go through the re∣mainder of the character with that degree of excellence which he always afterwards shewed in the performance of it, and which produced the applause which ever after uniformly at∣tended him in it. The person to whom he owed this seasonable relief was the late Mr. Dryden Leach, printer, who used often to tell the story to his friends.</P>
<P>It was during this first year of his theatrical life that he produced the farce of <HI>The Lying Valet;</HI> a performance which has given plea∣sure to numberless spectators, even after the principal character ceased to be performed by
<PB N="xvii" REF="16"/>
its author. At the end of the season he went over to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and in that kingdom added both to his fortune and his fame. The next year (1742 to 1743) he performed at Drury Lane, and the year after (1743 to 1744) at the same theatre. At the beginning of this season he was involved in a dispute with Mr. Macklin, who had joined with him in opposing the op∣pressions of the managers. That gentleman complained that he was deserted in the agree∣ment made with the managers, and published a state of his case, in a pamphlet, intituled, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. Macklin's reply to Mr. Garrick's an∣swer. To which are prefixed, all the pa∣pers which have publickly appeared in regard to this important dispute."</Q> The next year (1744 to 1745) he continued at Drury Lane; but the succeeding season (1745 to 1746) he went again to Dublin, and engaged with Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> as joint sharer and adventurer in the theatre there. In May 1746, he returned to London, and performed in six plays at the end of that month at Covent Garden, by which, we are told, he added 300l. to a great sum ac∣quired in Ireland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Victor's History of the Theatres, vol. I. p. 89.</NOTE>. He performed but one year more as an hired actor (1746 to 1747) which was at Covent Garden theatre, where he pro∣duced <HI>Miss in her Teens.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="17"/>
The mismanagement of the patentees of Drury-lane Theatre, after the deaths of Booth and Wilks, and the retirement of Cibber from the stage, had ruined every person concerned in it. At this period the successors of Mr. Fleet∣wood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charles Fleetwood, Esq. The history of this gentleman is very remarkable. It affords so striking a moral, and, at the same time, so important a lesson, that, though not strictly con∣nected with the life of Mr. Garrick, we hope to be pardoned for inserting the following particulars concerning him. At the age of twenty-one he came to a landed estate of six thousand pounds a year. <Q REND="inline">"He was,"</Q> says Mr. Victor, History of the Theatres, Vol. I. p. 33, <Q REND="inline">"agreeable in his person; and the qualities of his mind and amiableness of his disposition carried with them irresistible attractions; all the nobility of the kingdom seemed fond of cultivating an acquaintance with a young man of his ex∣tensive fortune, right disposition, and sweetness of temper. He was affable and engaging in his address, which was the last and only remaining quality that he kept with him to his death; and, no doubt, that would have vanished with the rest, if he had not found it of constant use to him in his business with the world, as that address enabled him to deceive even persons that thought themselves armed against him."</Q> He purchased the patent of Drury-lane Theatre in the year 1734, and continued in the management of it until 1745, when he left the kingdom; and some time after died a bankrupt both in fortune and reputation. Mr. Victor says, he was a ruined man before he engaged in theatrical concerns, and that for some years he profited by his purchase. It was his misfortune early in life to be thwarted in a design which he entertained, of uniting himself to a young lady of inferior fortune; the disappointment of which threw him into that habit of dissipation, which rendered him an easy prey to a set of sharpers, who first deprived him of his fortune, and afterwards of his integrity. The present Duke of Norfolk, in his <HI>Thoughts, Essays,</HI> and <HI>Maxims,</HI> published in 12mo. 1768, p. 87, relates the following fact, which <Q REND="inline">"happened in the presence of his wife, at either Bruges or Ghent, before he was married, or at all acquainted with her; viz. Mrs. Fleet∣wood, daughter to Lord Gerrard, and mother to Mr. Fleetwood, who was master manager of Drury-lane Playhouse (a gentle∣man of a very ancient good family, unhappily known) came upon a visit, and flung herself upon her knees to ask pardon of a Baronet's daughter, who was then companion to Mrs. How∣ard, as the only atonement left in her power for having pre∣vented her only son from marrying her, to whom there could be no objection, but that her fortune was not as great as ano∣ther lady's she had in view for him; by which means she was the occasion, indirectly, of the unhappiness of the young lady, by unhinging her mind, and souring her temper; and of her only son's rum, both in fortune and reputation, by flinging him into a round of dissipation and pleasure in order to eradicate his strongest affections. This kind of life had such an effect on him, that he contracted that baneful habit of gaming; so that in the course of a few years he ruined his fortune, (a very noble one) as most gamesters do, first by setting out a dupe, and afterwards turning sharper: at length he died unpitied, and, it is said, of a broken heart, being a little before reduced to a wretched annuity in some part of France."</Q> He left several children. Two of them appeared on the stage as actors, and one is but lately dead. This gentleman was two seasons, 1758 and 1759, at Drury-lane Theatre, and received a considerable share of applause. He however afterwards declined the pur∣suit, and went to the East Indies, where he acquired a genteel fortune. The other son died at Edinburgh a few years since.</NOTE> became involved in so many difficul∣ties,
<PB N="xix" REF="18"/>
that it was no longer possible for them to
<PB N="xx" REF="19"/>
continue the conduct of a business to which they were strangers, and which they were never likely to succeed in. In 1745 that gentleman had left the Theatre to his creditors to manage, after making the best terms he was able for him∣self. They conducted the business of it for two seasons, when, unable to continue the ma∣nagement any longer, the property of the pa∣tent, house, and scenes, was offered to several persons: but so apprehensive was every on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> become of the hazard of intermeddling with the theatre, that no purchaser was for some time to be found. At this juncture the late Mr. Lacy stepped forward, and boldly ventured to engage for the purchase. Having the reputa∣tion of a man of integrity, he soon found friends among the monied men to support him in his undertaking; the success of it, he prudently concluded, must depend in some measure on the abilities of the person with whom he should connect himself in the scheme. Mr. Garrick's reputation, both as a man and an actor, na∣turally led him to wish for his junction. A treaty was soon begun, and an agreement be∣tween them afterwards took place. Appli∣cation was made for a new patent; which was obtained, and both their names inserted in it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Victor's History of the Theatres, Vol. I. p. 84.</NOTE>.
<PB N="xxi" REF="20"/>
The season which began in 1747 was the first of their management, and was opened with an admirable Prologue, written by Doctor John∣son, and spoken by Mr. Garrick<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Doctor Johnson's Poems, published by Kearsley.</NOTE>. From this time Drury Lane Theatre, which had been so fatal to many adventurers, became the source of wealth and independence to both partners, who jointly exerted their several abilities in the management of the undertaking, with a de∣gree of harmony which did credit to their un∣derstandings, and with a share of success which in some measure must be ascribed to that good correspondence which subsisted between them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Lacey's memory, as an honest and worthy man, to whose assiduity and attention we are partly indebted for the pre∣sent regularity of the Theatre, deserves a few words. He was originally a manufacturer at Norwich, but unsuccessful in his connexions with trade. He afterwards came on the stage, and performed at the Hay-market in <HI>Pasquin</HI> and other pieces which were brought out at that theatre when under the direction of the late Henry Fielding, esq. He then read lectures in York Buildings, and engaged in the scheme of building Ranelagh, which the knavery of the person with whom he associated ren∣dered unsuccessful. The confidence which was reposed in his integrity enabled him without money to become the purchaser of Drury Lane Theatre at the juncture above-mentioned; and his prudence was the means of his amassing a considerable for∣tune, which however would have been much larger, had not an unhappy propensity to scheming taken possession of him, and induced him to launch into undertakings by which he was a great loser. We are informed his property was much lessened by searching for coal-mines in Oxfordshire. He was however still rich; and, at his death, January 1774, left a very hand∣some estate to an only son, whom he had by Mrs. Willoughby, an actress of Drury Lane Theatre. This Gentleman has since sold his share in the theatre.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="xxii" REF="21"/>
After he had been a manager two years, and the dissipation of youth had subsided, the charms of a lady, who then lived with the countess of Barlington as a companion, made a conquest of him. It is unnecessary to add that this lady is at present his widow. She is, we are informed, by birth a German. Her parents lived at Vi∣enna; and she appeared on the stage there as a dancer. In the year 1746, she came to En∣gland, and performed one Season at Drury Lane Theatre. She was then called Madame Eva Maria Violetti. The union between them took place on the 22d day of June, 1749; and we may add, that no marriage ever was attend∣ed with more happiness to both parties than this for near thirty years, during which time, it is on good authority asserted, they scarce passed a day separate from each other.</P>
<P>The theatrical season which commenced in the year 1750 was rendered remarkable by the
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22"/>
spirit of rivalship which prevailed at both houses. At the beginning of Mr. Garrick's manage∣ment he had engaged Barry, Macklin, Pritchard, Woffington, Cibber, and Clive; and, with these excellent performers, it may be imagined the profits of the House were very considerable. Soon after, Mr. Barry, who was under articles, refused to continue any longer at Drury Lane, and, when sued for the breach of his contract escaped from the penalty by means no way re∣dounding to his honour. Macklin and Mrs. Cibber likewise went over to Covent Garden; as did Mrs. Woffington, who is said to have entertained expectations of being united in mar∣riage with Mr. Garrick. With these deserters, aided by the veteran Quin, Mr. Rich opened Covent Garden Theatre. Mr. Garrick, not intimidated by the strength of the opposition, took the field on the 5th of September with an occasional Prologue spoken by himself<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 102.</NOTE>; which was answered by another delivered by Mr. Barry; and this again replied to by a very hu∣mourous Epilogue, admirably repeated by Mrs. Clive<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See p. 104.</NOTE>. The play of Romeo and Juliet had lain dormant many years. This was now re∣vived at both Houses: at Drury Lane, with al∣terations
<PB N="xxiv" REF="23"/>
by Mr. Garrick, who performed the principal character; Mr. Woodward playing Mercutio; and Mrs. Bellamy, Juliet: against them at Covent-garden, were Mr. Barry and Mrs. Cibber in the principal characters, and Mr. Macklin in Mercutio. Both houses began on the first of October; and continued to per∣form it for twelve successive nights; when Covent-garden gave up the contention; and its rival kept the field one night more, with the credit of holding out longer than its oppo∣nent, though it is supposed neither side reaped much advantage from the spirit of perseverance which had governed them both in this contest.</P>
<P>In the year 1754, on the 6th day of March, died Mr. Pelham, who had conducted the busi∣ness of government for some years before with candour, ability, and integrity. He was sin∣cerely lamented both by prince and people; and on this occasion Mr. Garrick displayed his poetic talents, in an ode which we are told ran through four editions in a few weeks. It is a performance which does credit to him, both as a man and a poet, and is the first in the present volumes.</P>
<P>The objectors to Mr. Garrick's manage∣ment of the theatre had a long time complained
<PB N="xxv" REF="24"/>
that he had conducted himself with too strict an attention to oeconomy in the ornamental and decorative parts of theatrical exhibitions. They were perpetually throwing out insinua∣tions, that the manager, relying on his own powers, was determined to regulate the enter∣tainments of the stage with an eye only to his own advantage, and without any regard to the satisfaction of the public. These murmurs had continued some time, when at last Mr. Garrick determined to meet the wishes of his friends, and to silence the discontents of his enemies. For this purpose he applied to Mr. Denoyer, sen. to recommend some person of genius to superintend and contrive a splendid spectacle to be exhibited at Drury-lane. The person fixed upon for the purpose was Mr. Noverre, a Swiss; who immediately received orders to engage the best troop of dancers that could be procured. These he selected from the foreign theatres; and they consisted of Swiss, Italians, Germans, and some French. The entertainment in which they were employed was soon afterwards produced. It was called The Chinese Festival; and was, in the thea∣trical phrase, got up with great magnificence, and at a very considerable expence. The ex∣pectations
<PB N="xxvi" REF="25"/>
of the managers were however wholly disappointed in the success of the per∣formance. Although but few of the French nation were employed in it, yet a report had been industriously spread, that not only French dancers had been sent for over, but French dresses also, and even French carpenters and taylors. The nation was then on the eve of a war; and this afforded an opportunity for en∣gaging the passions of those who professed themselves Antigallicans. They accordingly formed associations, to discourage the several performers, and suppress the obnoxious per∣formance whenever it should appear. At length, after having taken up more than eighteen months in preparing, it was brought before the publick, and received with all the virulence and opposition which might be expected from the violence and heat of the times. The first performance of it was on the 8th day of No∣vember, 1755, and was honoured with the pre∣sence of his late Majesty; yet, notwithstand∣ing that circumstance, it did not even then escape ill treatment. On the second, third, fourth, and fifth nights, the riots continued with increasing strength, though opposed each evening by several young men of fashion, who
<PB N="xxvii" REF="26"/>
had determined to support the performance. On the sixth evening the opposition acquired fresh vigour and increasing numbers. They frustrated every attempt to proceed in the ex∣hibition; and committed every excess which a mob, subject to no controul, is apt to indulge itself in. That evening was the last represen∣tation. After receiving assurance that the piece should be acted no more, the heroes who had signalized themselves in this important bu∣siness proceeded to Mr. Garrick's house in Southampton-street, where they broke his windows, and did other damages. They then dispersed; and the proprietors of the theatre were obliged to submit to the loss of more than four thousand pounds.</P>
<P>It would be impossible to enumerate the se∣veral small pieces of poetry which Mr. Garrick used to throw out from time to time, as his lei∣sure permitted, to compliment his friends, or to celebrate public events. We shall, however, just mention here that in 1755 he wrote some verses on Mr. Mason's taking orders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 504</NOTE>; and in 1757 he appears to have been one of the few who had taste enough to relish the beauties of Mr. Gray's celebrated odes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mason's Life of Gray, p. 250.</NOTE>. In 1759 Dr. Hill
<PB N="xxviii" REF="27"/>
wrote a pamphlet, intituled, "To David Gar∣rick, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the Petition of <HI>I,</HI> in behalf of her∣self and her sisters." The purport of it was to charge Mr. Garrick with mispronouncing some words including the letter I, as <HI>furm</HI> for firm, <HI>vurtue</HI> for virtue, and others. The pam∣phlet is now forgotten; but the Epigram, which Mr. Garrick wrote on the occasion, deserves to be preserved, as one of the best in the En∣glish language.</P>
<P>From this period no event of importance oc∣curs in the annals of Mr. Garrick's life until the year 1761. The business of the theatre went on without interruption; and he conti∣nued to acquire both reputation and fortune. In that year, however, he found himself obliged to exert his poetical talents, in order to correct the impertinence of an insignificant individual, a Mr. Fitzpatrick, who, without provocation, and in defiance of decency, carried on a weekly attack against him, in a paper called "The Craftsman." The original cause of the quar∣rel, we are informed, was grounded on some illiberal reflexions which Mr. Fitzpatrick threw out against Mr. Garrick, and which the latter resented with spirit and propriety, though a considerable time had elapsed before he was
<PB N="xxix" REF="28"/>
provoked to take public notice of him. As Mr. Fitzpatrick's writings are now entirely forgotten, the revenge which Mr. Garrick took of him must, from that circumstance alone, be involved in some obscurity. Those, however, who are unacquainted with either persons or facts will receive pleasure in reading Mr. Gar∣rick's admirable satire published on this occa∣sion, intituled THE FRIBBLERIAD, a Poem, which had the honour of being highly com∣mended by Churchill, who has also given a very severe correction to the same person.</P>
<P>However unequal Mr. Fitzpatrick was to the task of contending with Mr. Garrick in a literary warfare, yet the rancour which his de∣feat had engendered pointed out a new mode of attack to distress his antagonist. It had been customary, on the representation of a new per∣formance, to refuse admittance at any part of the evening, unless the whole price of the en∣tertainment was paid. This had almost invari∣ably been the rule; and it had hitherto been sub∣mitted to, as a reasonable demand from the managers, to compensate for the extraordinary expence which new dresses and scenes occasi∣oned. To gratify his resentment, Mr. Fitz∣patrick seized on this circumstance as a ground to disturb the peace of the theatre, and to in∣volve
<PB N="xxx" REF="29"/>
the managers in a contest with the pub∣lick. For this purpose hand-bills were dispersed about the coffee houses in the neighbourhood of Drury-lane, recommending a peremptory de∣mand to be made, and requiring an absolute promise to be given that no more than half the usual price should be taken on any evening of performance after the third act, unless at the representation of a new pantomime. A kind of association was entered into by several young men, to obtain a redress of this grievance, as it was called; and Mr. Fitzpatrick put himself at the head of it. The evening on which the attack was made happened to be when the <HI>The two Gentlemen of Verona</HI> was performed for the alterer's Benefit. The performance accord∣ingly was interrupted, after several attempts to proceed in it; and the proprietors of the house, thinking the requisition an unjust one, and the manner of making it improper to be acceded to, refused to submit to it: in consequence whereof no play was acted that night, and the audience received their money again at the doors, having first amused themselves with do∣ing all the mischief they were able. By this trial, the malecontents had discovered their strength, and determined to carry their point
<PB N="xxxi" REF="30"/>
in humbling the pride of the manager. On the next performance, which was at the tragedy of <HI>Elvira,</HI> they collected their whole force, and again prevented the actors proceeding in the play. It was in vain that Mr. Garrick desired to be heard in defence of the ancient customs of the theatre. The opposition insisted on a peremptory answer to their demand in the new regulation; which, after some time, the pro∣prietors of the house were obliged to agree to; and once more peace was restored to the thea∣tre after a considerable loss had been sustained, and obliged to be submitted to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of this riot, <HI>Gentleman's Magazine</HI> vol. XXIII. p. 31.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This season was the last in which Mr. Gar∣rick could be said to have acted in the regular course of his profession. From this time he de∣clined performing any new characters; and, finding his health unsettled by the advice of his physician he determined to give himself some relaxation from care and fatigue. He there∣fore made the arrangements necessary for carry∣ing on the public entertainments during his ab∣sence; and on the 15th of September 1763, the day on which the House opened, he left London, in order to make the tour of France, and Italy. To supply his place, he engaged
<PB N="xxxii" REF="31"/>
the late Mr. Powell, who had received his in∣structions the preceding summer, and whose success was equal to the abilities he possessed. To the honour of his employers, it may be added, that his abilities were not higher than the encouragement he received for the exertion of them. Although he was engaged for a term of years at a small salary; yet he was, before the season closed, generously allowed an ap∣pointment equal to the first performer in the house. We are credibly informed, the pro∣sits that year exceeded even those in which Mr. Garrick performed in the height of his repu∣tation.</P>
<P>The interval from this period, until the month of April 1765, Mr. Garrick employed in travelling through the principal parts of Eu∣rope; and was, at every place where he resi∣ded, and at most of the courts to which he was introduced, received in the most honoura∣ble and cordial manner; by the great, as well as by men of letters; each vying with the other in shewing respect to the greatest drama∣tic character of the age. While he stayed at Paris, he amused himself with reading <HI>Fon∣taine's Fables;</HI> which pleased him so much, that he was induced to attempt an imitation of
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="32"/>
them. He accordingly wrote one, called <HI>The Sick Monkey;</HI> which he transmitted over to a friend, to be ready for publication immediately on his arrival. It accordingly made its ap∣pearance in two or three days after, with the following motto: <Q REND="inline">"Thursday afternoon Da∣vid Garrick, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> arrived at his house in Southampton-street, Covent-garden. Public Advertiser, April 27, 1765."</Q> And he had the pleasure of hearing the sentiments of his friends upon it; many of whom mistook it for a satire upon him, and accordingly expressed themselves in very warm terms on the occasion.</P>
<P>Immediately on his arrival he resumed the management of the theatre, and introduced some improvements which had been suggested by his observations on the conduct of the fo∣reign stages. From the list of his works it will be seen that he had not been idle while abroad. He produced the next season several new pieces, and in the beginning of 1766 the excellent comedy of <HI>The Clandestine Marriage,</HI> written in concert with Mr. Colman. He also, at the request of his Majesty, appeared again upon the stage; and on that occasiou spoke<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 201</NOTE> a new prologue, replete with those strokes
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="33"/>
of humour in which, in that species of compo∣sition, he manifested a superiority over all his contemporaries.</P>
<P>In that year died Mr. Quin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Quin died the 21st day of January, 1766; and Mrs. Cibber on the 30th of the same month.</NOTE> and Mrs. Cib∣ber. Their deaths were very pathetically ta∣ken notice of in the prologue to <HI>The Clandestine Marriage;</HI> and for the former Mr. Garrick wrote an epitaph, which was placed over his tomb in the cathedral church of Bath. Mr. Quin was the only performer of any reputation when Mr. Garrick first appeared on the stage, and he had likewise been one of his earliest op∣posers. For several years however before Mr. Quin's death great cordiality had subsisted be∣tween him and Mr. Garrick, at whose house at Hampton he spent some time a few months before his death, and there first discovered the symptoms of that disorder which carried him to his grave.</P>
<P>The year 1769 was remarkable for the cele∣bration of a jubilee at Stratford upon Avon, the 6th, 7th, and 8th of September, in honour of Shakespeare; a ceremony which very much engaged the public attention. Although it was treated by some as a subject worthy only
<PB N="xxxv" REF="34"/>
of ridicule, yet by others it was deemed a just compliment due to the great writer whose me∣mory was intended to be honoured by it. The circumstance which gave rise to it happened some time before, and was as follows: A cler∣gyman, into whose possession the house once belonging to our great poet had come, found that a mulberry-tree, which grew in the garden, and which had been planted, according to tra∣dition, by Shakespeare himself, overshadowed his mansion, and made it damp. To remedy this inconvenience, he caused it to be cut down, to the great mortification of his neighbours, who were so enraged at him, that they soon rendered the place, out of revenge, too dis∣agreeable for him to remain in it. He there∣fore was obliged to quit it; and the tree, be∣ing purchased by a carpenter, was retailed, and cut out in various relicks of stand-dishes, tea∣chests, tobacco-stoppers, and other things; some of which were obtained by the corpora∣tion of Stratford. The gentlemen belonging to this body soon after agreed to present Mr. Garrick with the freedom of their borough; and their steward communicated their inten∣tions to him in a letter, from whence the fol∣lowing extract is taken: <Q REND="inline">"The corporation of
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="35"/>
Stratford, ever desirous of expressing their gra∣titude to all who do honour and justice to the memory of Shakespeare, and highly sensible that no person in any age hath excelled you therein, would think themselves much honour'd if you would become one of their body. Tho' this borough doth not now send members to parliament, perhaps the inhabitants may not be less virtuous; and, to render the freedom of this place the more acceptable to you, the corporation propose to send it in a box made of that very mulberry tree planted by Shakes∣peare's own hand. The story of that valuable relick is too long to be here inserted: but the gentleman who is so obliging as to convey this to you will acquaint you therewith; as also that the corporation would be happy in receiv∣ing from your hands some statue, bust, or pic∣ture of Shakespeare, to be placed within their new town-hall; they would be equally pleased to have some picture of yourself, that the me∣mory of both may be perpetuated together in that place which gave him birth, and where he still lives in the mind of every inhabitant."</Q></P>
<P>The honour proposed in this letter to be con∣ferred on Mr. Garrick was accepted by him; and the same compliment was paid to George
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="36"/>
Keate, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who had some time before pro∣duced a poem, which contained an excellent eulogium on our admirable dramatick bard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><LG TYPE="eulogy">
<L>" Yes! jealous wits for empire still may strive,</L>
<L>" Still keep the flames of critic rage alive:</L>
<L>" Our Shakespeare yet shall all his rights maintain,</L>
<L>" And crown the triumphs of Eliza's reign.</L>
<L>" Above controul, above each classic rule,</L>
<L>" His tut'ress Nature, and the world his school.</L>
<L>" On pinions fancy-plum'd to him was given</L>

<HEAD>To DAVID GARRICK, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of the antient borough of Stratford upon Avon, a town that glories in giving birth to the immor∣tal Shakespeare, whose memory you have so highly honoured, and whose conceptions you have ever so happily expressed—rejoice in an opportunity of adding their mite to that univer∣sal applause your inimitable powers have most justly merited; and, as a mark of their esteem and gratitude, have respectfully transmitted to you the freedom of their borough, in a box made from a mulberry tree, undoubtedly planted by Shakespeare's own hand, which they hope you will do them the honour of ac∣cepting.</P>
<P>By order of the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses in common council.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Signed by W. HUNT, Town-clerk.</SIGNED> <DATELINE><HI>Stratford upon Avon,</HI> <DATE><HI>May</HI> 3, 1769.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The manner in which this entertainment was to have been performed, the disappoint∣ments it sustained, and the several occurrences
<PB N="xxxix" REF="38"/>
which took place at it, are all so recent in the memories of most of our readers, and were so accurately related at the time they happened<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Victor's History of the Theatres, Vol. III.</NOTE>, that we shall not recapitulate them here. It is sufficient to observe, that accident deprived those who were present of part of their enter∣tainment; that all which was exhibited gave general satisfaction; and Mr. Garrick, who was a great sum of money out of pocket by it, framed an entertainment, which was performed at Drury-lane Theatre 92 nights with great applause to very crouded audiences. The ode which was spoken by him at Stratford was also repeated at the same theatre, but not with much success, being performed only seven times<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This ode was parodied in an admirable burlesque, called "An Ode on dedicating a Building and erecting a Statue to Le Stue, Cook to the Duke of Newcastle at Clermont." Reprinted, with Mr. Garrick's Ode, in Dilly's REPOSITORY, vol. I.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The management of a theatre is always at∣tended with anxiety and vexation; the diffi∣culty of satisfying the several candidates for theatrical fame is so great, that he who can preserve the friendship of those whose pieces he rejects, must be allowed to possess very extra∣ordinary abilities. In the year 1772, it was
<PB N="xl" REF="39"/>
Mr. Garrick's misfortune to be embroiled with a very irascible and troublesome person, who claimed the representation of one of his pieces at Drury-lane; and he inforced his demand in a manner that will stamp indelible disgrace on his memory. He published a poem to intimi∣date the manager, called <HI>Love in the Suds,</HI> con∣taining insinuations of the basest kind, and which he afterwards denied having had any in∣tentions to convey. As this writer is dead, those reflections on his conduct which had he been living might have appeared here, and which the subject naturally suggests, shall be sup∣pressed. It will be sufficient to observe, that Mr. Garrick had recourse to the court of King's Bench, to punish the infamous libeller of his reputation; and, notwithstanding he had been a second time insulted by another pub∣lication conceived with equal malignity, he was weak enough to stop the prosecution he had commenced, on his adversary's signing an acknowledgment of his offence, which was printed in all the public papers. It cannot be denied but that the interests of society demanded that so gross an offender should meet with pu∣nishment, and that no concessions ought to have been allowed to deprecate that stroke which the law would have inflicted on so heinous a crime.</P>
<P><PB N="xli" REF="40"/>
From this time no event of importance hap∣pened, until the resolution which Mr. Garrick had begun to form of quitting the stage was, to the concern of every one, carried into exe∣cution. In the beginning of the year 1776, he entered into an agreement with some of the present patentees, for the sale of his interest in the theatre; but continued to act during the re∣mainder of that season. The last night of his performance was for the Theatrical Fund, on the 10th day of June in that year, when he represented the character of Don Felix in The Wonder. At the conclusion of the play he came forward, and addressed the audience in a short speech, wherein he said, <Q REND="inline">"it had been usual for persons in his situation to address the publick in an epilogue; and that he had ac∣cordingly turned his thoughts that way, but found it as impossible to write, as it would be to speak, a studied composition; the jingle of rhyme and the language of fiction ill suiting his then feelings: that the moment in which he then spoke was an awful one to him: that he had received innumerable favours, and took his leave on the spot where those favours were con∣ferred."</Q> He then said, <Q REND="inline">"that, whatever the events of his future life might be, he should
<PB N="xlii" REF="41"/>
ever remember those favours with the highest satisfaction and deepest gratitude; and though he admitted the superior skill and abilities of his successors, he defied them to exert them∣selves with more industry, zeal, and attention, than he had done."</Q> This speech, which was delivered with all that emotion which the par∣ticular situation of the speaker rendered very interesting and affecting, was received with the loudest bursts of applause; and he left the stage with the acclamations of a numerous and polite audience, who were unable to forbear expressing the deepest concern for the loss of their favou∣rite performer.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick now retired to the enjoyment of his friends, the most respectable in the king∣dom, and of a large fortune, acquired in the course of more than thirty years: but the stone, which he had been afflicted with some time, had already made such inroads on his constitution, that he was unable to communi∣cate or receive from his friends that pleasure which his company afforded, except at times, and in a very partial manner. It is supposed that he injured his health by the application of quack medicines, and often experienced the most violent torments from the severity of his
<PB N="xliii" REF="42"/>
disorder. At Christmas 1778, he went to visit Lord Spencer at Althorp in Northampton∣shire, during the holidays. He there was taken ill; but recovered so far that he was removed to town, where growing worse, he died in a few days afterwards, at his house in the Adel∣phi, on the 20th day of January, 1779, at the age of 63 years; leaving behind him the cha∣racter of a friendly, humane, charitable, and (notwithstanding many idle reports, we may add) liberal man; one who felt for distress, and relieved it; a chearful companion, a pleas∣ing writer, and the first actor of this or any other age.</P>

<LG>
<L>IF dying excellence deserves a tear,</L>
<L>If fond remembrance still is cherish'd here,</L>
<L>Can we persist to bid your sorrows flow</L>
<L>For fabled sufferers and delusive woe?</L>
<L>Or with quaint smiles dismiss the plaintive strain,</L>
<L>Point the quick jest—indulge the comic vein—</L>
<L>Ere yet to buried Roscius we assign</L>
<L>One kind regret—one tributary line!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His same requires we act a tenderer part:</L>
<L>His memory claims the tear you gave his art!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The general voice, the meed of mournful verse,</L>
<L>The splendid sorrows that adorn'd his hearse,</L>
<L>The tnrong that mourn'd as their dead favourite pass'd,</L>
<L>The grac'd respect that claim'd him to the last,</L>
<L><PB N="lvi" REF="53"/>
While Shakespeare's image from its hallow'd base,</L>
<L>Seem'd to prescribe the grave, and point the place,</L>
<L>Nor these, nor all the sad regrets that flow</L>
<L>From fond fidelity's domestic woe,</L>
<L>So much are Garrick's praise—so much his due,</L>
<L>As on this spot—one tear bestow'd by you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Amid the arts which seek ingenuous fame,</L>
<L>Our toil attempts the most precarious claim!</L>
<L>To him, whose mimic pencil wins the prize,</L>
<L>Obedient fame immortal wreaths supplies:</L>
<L>Whate'er of wonder Reynolds now may raise,</L>
<L>Raphael still boasts contemporary praise:</L>
<L>Each dazzling light and gaudier bloom subdu'd,</L>
<L>With undiminish'd awe his works are view'd:</L>
<L>E'en beauty's portrait wears a softer prime,</L>
<L>Touch'd by the tender hand of mellowing time.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The patient sculptor owns an humbler part,</L>
<L>A ruder toil, and more mechanic art:</L>
<L>Content with slow and timorous stroke to trace</L>
<L>The lingering line, and mould the tardy grace:</L>
<L><PB N="lvii" REF="54"/>
But once atchiev'd, tho' barbarous wreck o'er∣throw</L>
<L>The sacred fane, and lay its glories low,</L>
<L>Yet shall the sculptur'd ruin rise to day,</L>
<L>Grac'd by defect, and worship'd in decay;</L>
<L>Th' enduring record bears the artist's name,</L>
<L>Demands his honours, and asserts his fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Superior hopes the Poet's bosom fire,</L>
<L>O proud distinction of the sacred lyre!</L>
<L>Wide as th' inspiring Phoebus darts his ray,</L>
<L>Diffusive splendor gilds his votary's lay.</L>
<L>Whether the song heroic woes rehearse,</L>
<L>With epic grandeur, and the pomp of verse;</L>
<L>Or, fondly gay, with unambitious guile</L>
<L>Attempt no prize but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avouring beauty's smile;</L>
<L>Or bear dejected to the lonely grove</L>
<L>The soft despair of unprevailing love;</L>
<L>Whate'er the theme, thro' ev'ry age and clime</L>
<L>Congenial passions meet the according rhyme;</L>
<L>The pride of glory, pity's sigh sincere,</L>
<L>Youth's earliest blush, and beauty's virgin tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such is their meed—their honours thus se∣cure,</L>
<L>Whose arts yield objects, and whose works endure.</L>
<L><PB N="lviii" REF="55"/>
The Actor only, shrinks from time's award;</L>
<L>Feeble tradition is his memory's guard;</L>
<L>By whose faint breath his merits must abide,</L>
<L>Unvouch'd by proof, to substance unallied!</L>
<L>Ev'n matchless Garrick's art to heav'n resign'd,</L>
<L>No fix'd effect, no model leaves behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The grace of action, the adapted mien,</L>
<L>Faithful as Nature to the varied scene;</L>
<L>Th' expressive glance, whose subtle comment draws</L>
<L>Entranc'd attention, and a mute applause;</L>
<L>Gesture that marks, with force and feeling fraught,</L>
<L>A sense in silence, and a will in thought;</L>
<L>Harmonious speech, whose pure and liquid tone</L>
<L>Gives verse a musick, scarce consess'd its own;</L>
<L>As light from gems assumes a brighter ray,</L>
<L>And, cloath'd with orient hues, transcends the day!</L>
<L>Passion's wild break, and srown that awes the sense,</L>
<L>And ev'ry charm of gentler eloquence,</L>
<L>All perishable!—like th' electric fire</L>
<L>But strike the frame, and as they strike, expire;</L>
<L>Incense too pure a bodied flame to bear,</L>
<L>Its fragrance charms the sense, and blends with air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="lix" REF="56"/>
<L>Where then, while sunk in cold decay he lies,</L>
<L>And pale eclipse for ever veils those eyes!</L>
<L>Where is the blest memorial that ensures</L>
<L>Our Garrick's fame?—whose is the trust?—'tis yours.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And O! by ev'ry charm his art essay'd</L>
<L>To sooth your cares! by ev'ry grief allay'd!</L>
<L>By the husn'd wonder which his accents drew!</L>
<L>By his last parting tear, repaid by you!</L>
<L>By all those thoughts, which many a distant night</L>
<L>Shall mark his memory with a sad delight!</L>
<L>Still in your heart's dear record bear his name,</L>
<L>Cherish the keen regret that lifts his fame;</L>
<L>To you it is bequeath'd, assert the trust,</L>
<L>And to his worth—'tis all you can—be just.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What more is due from sanctifying time,</L>
<L>To chearful wit, and many a favor'd rhyme,</L>
<L>O'er his grac'd urn shall bloom, a deathless wreath,</L>
<L>Whose blossom'd sweets shall deck the mask beneath.</L>
<L>For these, when sculpture's votive toil shall rear</L>
<L>The due memorial of a loss so dear!</L>
<L><PB N="lx" REF="57"/>
O loveliest mourner, gentle muse! be thine</L>
<L>The pleasing woe to guard the laurel'd shrine.</L>
<L>As Fancy, oft by superstition led</L>
<L>To roam the mansions of the sainted dead,</L>
<L>Has view'd, by shadowy eve's unfaithful gloom,</L>
<L>A weeping cherub on a martyr's tomb;</L>
<L>So thou, sweet Muse, hang o'er his sculptur'd bier,</L>
<L>With patient woe, that loves the lingering tear;</L>
<L>With thoughts that mourn, nor yet desire re∣lief,</L>
<L>With meek regret, and fond enduring grief;</L>
<L>With looks that speak—he never shall return!</L>
<L>Chilling thy tender bosom, clasp his urn;</L>
<L>And with soft sighs disperse th' irreverend dust,</L>
<L>Which Time may strew upon his sacred bust.</L>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT To the SECOND EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>The Author of the foregoing <HI>ODE</HI> has heard with pleasure that what he had written from his con∣cern for the death of a good and great man has been favourably received. He is not vain enough to think that the Poem has any merit but what results from the truth and mere feeling of the subject-matter.—In this edition he has altered some Stanzas which were too hastily published in the first, and hopes he has now made it more wor∣thy of his Readers.</P>

<HEAD>THE FRIBBLERIAD.</HEAD>
<Q><L><HI>Foemina, Vir, Neutrum.</HI></L><BIBL>PUL. in HERMOPH.</BIBL></Q>
<P>First printed in the Year 1761.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="note">

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>BE it known unto you, gentle or ungentle reader, that the author of the following poem is a volunteer in the service, or rather a poetical knight-errant, who, according to the oath taken at the late installation, is <HI>exhortca and admonished</HI> (by Apollo to be sure) <HI>to use his sword in defence of all equity and justice to the ut∣most of his power.</HI> His brother Quixote, of im∣mortal memory, tried his prowess upon Sheep and Windmills—Our champion does the very same; and calls forth to the field an <HI>unknown</HI> knight, who has the formidable X, Y, Z, in his train.—And, that he may not be thought to en∣gage with too great odds on his side, he opposes to them his own <HI>three trusty squires,</HI> A, B, C, who are resolved to stand by him, and fight all the weapons through, from Epic Poetry to Epigram, as long as there is a letter left standing in the English alphabet—and now, Mr. Churchill may know, that there is<Q><L>—A Quixote of the age will dare,</L>
<L>To wage a war with dirt, and fight with air.</L></Q> When the aforesaid <HI>unknown</HI> knight shall please to appear with his <HI>beaver up,</HI> he may expect that our adventurer will shew <HI>his face</HI> too.—In the
<PB N="14" REF="74"/>
mean time, we will divert him in our turn with a little <HI>bush</HI>-fighting, which he has been endea∣vouring to entertain the town with for more than a twelvemonth past.</P>
<P>It is therefore proper to inform thee, reader, for as yet perhaps thou hast not heard of it, that there is a certain weekly paper, called the Crafts∣man, still existing, if it may be called existence to crawl about from week to week, and be kept alive by those last resources of hungry ingenuity, falsehood and defamation. In this said paper, a certain gentleman, who subscribes himself X, Y, Z, a volunteer too in the service, has thrown about his dirt in a most extraordinary manner, and has attacked our Stage Hero, with unwearied male∣volence, both in his public and private character; but, indeed, his rancour being too much for his wit, he has let his heart indulge itself at the ex∣pence of his head, and has most imprudently made assertions, in the bitterness of his spirit, which can be contradicted by every attender upon the theatre.—It would be endless, and out of place here, to point out his want of taste, and even common truth, in his account of the manner of Mr. Garrick's speaking and acting in his various characters; of his most ungentleman-like, as well as unjust, abuse of his person, voice, age, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.; for there is no kind of meanness, as Montaigne well observes, that a true malignant spirit will not descend to.—To give one instance
<PB N="15" REF="75"/>
among a thousand of his upright intentions—This worthy gentleman, Mr. X, Y, Z, not con∣tent with exposing his impotent malice weekly to the publick, was at the pains and expence to col∣lect his papers into one volume<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The title of which was "An enquiry into the real merit of a certain popular Performer; in a Se∣ries of Letters, first published in the Craftsman, or Gray's Inn Journal, with an Introduction to David Garrick, Esq." 8vo.</NOTE>, and even send them to some of Mr. Garrick's friends, left the obscurity and disreputation of the paper, in which they first made their appearance, should have kept his malice totally a secret—The Re∣viewers gave their sentiments of this curious col∣lection, in the following manner—</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"These are the overflowings of spleen, igno∣rance, conceit, and disappointment."</Q> <BIBL><HI>Crit. Rev. Jan.</HI> 1761.</BIBL></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The design of publishing these <HI>important</HI> pieces of criticism, is, to prevent the <HI>sad misfor∣tune</HI> of their sinking into oblivion with a last year's news-paper. If we believe the author, all the praises that have hitherto been given to Mr. Garrick, as an actor, are so entirely without foun∣dation, that <Q REND="inline">"he never did, nornever could, speak ten successive lines of Shakespeare with gramma∣tical propriety."</Q> This is an assertion so contrary to the opinion of many better critics than this au∣thor shews himself to be, and in reality so oppo∣site
<PB N="16" REF="76"/>
to truth, that it is alone sufficient to invali∣date all his reasonings upon the subject."</Q><BIBL><HI>Monthly Rev. Dec.</HI> 1760.</BIBL></P>
<P>It would take up too much time at present, to exhibit our hero X, Y, Z, in all his proper co∣lours: we shall leave that task to a much abler hand, who will very soon more fully detect and expose him and his designs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was soon after executed in the following se∣vere character, drawn by Mr. Churchill, of the hero of this poem, first inserted in the eighth edition of THE ROSCIAD.
<Q><LG>
<L>"With that low cunning, which in fools supplies,</L>
<L>And amply too, the place of being wife,</L>
<L>Which nature, kind indulgent parent, gave</L>
<L>To qualify the blockhead for a knave;</L>
<L>With that smooth falsehood, whose appearance charms,</L>
<L>And reason of each wholesome doubt disarms,</L>
<L>Which to the lowest depths of guile descends,</L>
<L>By vilest means pursues the vilest ends,</L>
<L>Wears friendship's mask for purposes of spite,</L>
<L>Fawns in the day, and butchers in the night;</L>
<L>With that malignant envy, which turns pale,</L>
<L>And sickens, even if a friend prevail,</L>
<L>Which merit and success pursues with hate,</L>
<L>And damns the worth it cannot imitate;</L>
<L>With the cold caution of a coward's spleen,</L>
<L>Which fears not guilt, but always seeks a screen,</L>
<L>Which keeps this maxim ever in her view—</L>
<L>What's basely done, should be done safely too;</L>
<L>With that dull, rooted, callous impudence,</L>
<L>Which, dead to shame, and every nicer sense,</L>
<L>Ne'er blush'd, unless, in spreading vice's snares,</L>
<L>She blunder'd on some virtue unawares;</L>
<L>With all these blessings, which we seldom find</L>
<L>Lavish'd by nature on one happy mind,</L>
<L>A motley figure, of the fribble tribe,</L>
<L>Which heart can searce conceive, or pen describe,</L>
<L>Came simpering on; to ascertain whose sex,</L>
<L>Twelve sage impanell'd matrons would perplex.</L>
<L>Nor male, nor female; neither, and yet both;</L>
<L>Of neuter gender, though of Irish growth;</L>
<L>A six-foot sackling, mincing in his gait;</L>
<L>Affected, peevish, prim, and delicate;</L>
<L>Fearful <HI>it</HI> seem'd, though of athletic make,</L>
<L>Lest brutal breezes should too roughly shake</L>
<L><HI>Its</HI> tender form, and savage motion spread</L>
<L>O'er its pale cheeks the horrid manly red.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Much did <HI>it</HI> talk, in <HI>its</HI> own pretty phrase,</L>
<L>Of genius and of time, of players and plays;</L>
<L>Much too of writings which <HI>itself</HI> had wrote,</L>
<L>Of special merit, though of little note,</L>
<L>For fate, in a strange humour, had decreed</L>
<L>That what <HI>it</HI> wrote, none but <HI>itself</HI> should read;</L>
<L>Much too it chatter'd of dramatic laws,</L>
<L>Misjudging critics, and misplac'd applause;</L>
<L>Then, with a self-complacent jutting air,</L>
<L><HI>It</HI> smil'd, <HI>it</HI> smirk'd, <HI>it</HI> wriggled to the chair;</L>
<L>And, with an aukward briskness not his own,</L>
<L>Looking around, and perking on the throne,</L>
<L>Triumphant seem'd, when that strange savage dame,</L>
<L>Known but to few, or only known by name,</L>
<L>Plain Common Sense, appear'd; by Nature there</L>
<L>Appointed, with plain Truth, to guard the chair.</L>
<L>The Pageant saw, and blasted with her frown,</L>
<L>To <HI>its</HI> first state of nothing melted down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor shall the Muse (for even there the pride</L>
<L>Of this vain nothing shall be mortified)</L>
<L>Nor shall the Muse (should fate ordain her rhimes,</L>
<L>Fond pleasing thought! to live in after-times)</L>
<L>With such a trifler's name her pages blot:</L>
<L>Known be the character, the thing forgot;</L>
<L>Let <HI>it,</HI> to disappoint each future aim,</L>
<L>Live without sex, and die without a name!"</L>
</LG></Q></NOTE>.—But to return to our poem—</P>
<P>It may properly be called an <HI>Iliad</HI> in a <HI>nut∣shell;</HI> for, though it does not consist of many
<PB N="17" REF="77"/>
more than four hundred lines, it contains all the essential epic properties—the plan, sentiments,
<PB N="18" REF="78"/>
character, diction, moral, metre, and even the heroes themselves, all in miniature.</P>
<P>The following epigram, printed in the Ledger, was the corner-stone of the whole, and furnished us with ideas of the redoubted Fitzgig, the Achilles of the Fribbleriad—</P>
<Q><LG TYPE="epigram">
<HEAD>To X, Y, Z.</HEAD>
<L>Inded most severely poor Garrick you handle,</L>
<L>Not bigots damn more with their bell, book, and candle;</L>
<L>Though you with the town about him disagree,</L>
<L>He joins with the town in their judgment of thee:</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="79"/>
So dainty, so devilish, is all that you scribble,</L>
<L>Not a soul but can see 'tis the spite of a Fribble;</L>
<L>And all will expect you, when forth you shall come,</L>
<L>With a <HI>round smirking face,</HI> and <HI>a jut with your bum.</HI></L>
</LG></Q>
<P>If X, Y, Z, is really such a thing as here re∣presented, he is most welcome to the honour we have done him; if he is <HI>not,</HI> he may thank his own malignant d sposition, that made it natural to suppose, that such poor spite could proceed from no one, who was not, in his person, man∣ners, mind, and heart, an arrant FRIBBLE.</P>

<HEAD>AN ODE UPON DEDICATING A BUILDING, AND ERECTING A STATUE, TO SHAKESPEARE, AT STRATFORD UPON AVON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Ode was spoken by Mr. GARRICK, 7th September, 1769, at Stratford upon Avon; and the ensuing Winter at Drury-Lane Theatre.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>COULD some gentlemen of ap∣proved ability have been prevailed upon to do justice to the subject of the following Ode, the present apology would have been unnecessary;—but as it was requisite to produce something of this kind upon the occasion, and the lot having unluckily fallen on the person perhaps the least qualified to succeed in the attempt, it is hoped the candour of the public will esteem the per∣formance rather as an act of duty, than vanity in the author.</P>
<P>As some news-paper writers have illiberally endeavoured to shake the poetic character of our immortal bard (too deeply indeed rooted in the heart to be affected by them) it is recommended to those who are not sufficiently established in their dramatic faith, to peruse a work lately published, called, <HI>An Essay on the Genius and Writings of</HI> SHAKESPEARE, by which they will with much satisfaction be convinced, that <HI>England</HI> may justly boast the honour of producing the greatest dra∣matic poet in the world.</P>
<P>To strengthen and justify the general admira∣tion of this astonishing Genius, it has been
<PB N="56" REF="113"/>
thought proper to subjoin to the Ode some unde∣niable testimonies (both in prose and verse) of his unequalled original talents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These are extracted from the Works of Ben Jonson, Mil∣ton, Dryden, Pope, Thomson, Johnson, Warton, Seward, Akenside, Gray, Mason, Churchill, Jago, Whitehead, Addi∣son, Rowe, Voltaire, Theobald, Hanmer, Lyttelton, Warburton, Dodd, Steevens, Capel, Hurd, Murphy, Colman, Walpole and Mrs. Montague. In the present collection they are omitted.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If it shall be found, that <HI>speaking</HI> that part of the Ode, which has usually been conveyed in re∣citative, produces a better effect, the Author flatters himself he may lay claim to some little merit on that account: As to the Ode itself, he presents it to the public as an object of their good-nature,—to his friends as an exercise of their partiality—to his enemies, as a lucky opportu∣nity of venting their wit, humour, criticism, spleen, or whatever else they please, should they think it worthy of their notice.</P>

<L>THAT I'm a lying rogue, you all agree;</L>
<L>And yet look round the world and you will see</L>
<L>How many more my betters lye as fast as me.</L>
<L>Against this vice we all are ever railing,</L>
<L>And yet, so tempting is it, so prevailing,</L>
<L>You'll find but few without this useful failing.</L>
<L>Lady or Abigail, my Lord or Will,</L>
<L>The lye goes round, and the ball's never still.</L>
<L>My lies were harmless, told to shew my parts;</L>
<L>And not like those when tongues belye their hearts.</L>
<L>In all professions you will find this flaw;</L>
<L>And in the greatest too, in physic and in law.</L>
<L>The gouty serjeant cries, with formal pause,</L>
<L>" Your plea is good, my friend, don't starve the cause."</L>
<L>But when my Lord decrees for t'other side,</L>
<L>Your costs of suit convince you—that he ly'd.</L>

<L>A Doctor comes, with formal wig and face;</L>
<L>First feels your pulse, then thinks, and knows your case.</L>
<L>" Your fever's slight, not dangerous, I assure you;</L>
<L>" Keep warm, and <HI>repetatur baustus,</HI> sir, will cure you."</L>
<L>Around the bed next day his friends are crying;</L>
<L>The patient dies, the Doctor's paid for lying.</L>
<L>The Poet, willing to secure the Pit,</L>
<L>Gives out his play has humour, taste, and wit:</L>
<L>The cause comes on, and, while the judges try,</L>
<L>Each groan and catcall gives the bard the lye.</L>
<L>Now let us ask, pray, what the ladies do?</L>
<L>They too will fib a little, <HI>entre nous.</HI></L>
<L>" Lord! says the Prude, (her face behind her fan)</L>
<L>" How can our sex have any joy in man?</L>
<L>" As for my part, the best could ne'er deceive me,</L>
<L>" And were the race extinct, 'twould never grieve me:</L>
<L>" Their sight is odious! but their touch—O gad!</L>
<L>" The thought of that's enough to drive one mad."</L>
<L>Thus rails at man the squeamish Lady Dainty,</L>
<L>Yet weds, at fifty-five, a rake of twenty.</L>
<L>In short, a beau's intrigues, a lover's sighs,</L>
<L>The courtier's promise, the rich widow's cries,</L>
<L>And patriot's zeal, are seldom more than lies.</L>
<L><PB N="84" REF="139"/>
Sometimes you'll see a man belye his nation,</L>
<L>Nor to his country shew the least relation.</L>
<L>For instance now—</L>
<L>A cleanly <HI>Dutchman,</HI> or a <HI>Frenchman</HI> grave,</L>
<L>A sober <HI>German,</HI> or a <HI>Spaniard</HI> brave,</L>
<L>An <HI>Englishman</HI> a coward or a slave.</L>
<L>Mine, tho' a fibbing, was an honest art;</L>
<L>I serv'd my master, play'd a faithful part:</L>
<L>Rank me not, therefore, 'mongst the lying crew,</L>

<L>Their ladies too were form'd with strange in∣gredients;</L>

<L>Would any modern lady break her heart,</L>

<L>Would she to thwart his will be so uncivil?</L>

In an Advertisement prefixed to this Play, the Author complains that ten years had elapsed before it could obtain the favour of a representation; that he was not unknown to the great, nor destitute of private friends; and having devoted the most serious of his studies to the service of the publick, he had some reason to expect the public favour. Yet that the receipts of the house upon the first night were but twenty-one pounds; and when the Manager risqued a second to give the Author a chance for a Benefit, he was obliged to shut up his doors for want of an audience. <BIBL><HI>Biog.

<L>And, as they heard, exploded every scene.</L>
<L>When Reynard's thoughts were ask'd, the shrugging sage,</L>
<L>Fam'd for hypocrisy, and worn with age,</L>
<L>Condemn'd the shameless licence of the stage.</L>
<L>At which the Monkey skipp'd from box to box,</L>

<L>Once on a time, two boys were throwing dirt;</L>
<L>A gentle youth was one, and one was somewhat pert:</L>
<L>Each to his master with his tale retreated,</L>
<L>Who gravely heard their diff'rent parts re∣peated,</L>
<L>How Tom was rude, and Jack, poor lad, ill∣treated.</L>
<L>The master paus'd—to be unjust was loth;</L>
<L>Call'd for a rod, and fairly whipt them both.</L>
<L>In the same master's place, lo! here I stand,</L>
<L>And for each culprit hold the lash in hand.</L>
<L>First for our own—oh, 'tis a pretty youth!</L>
<L>But out of fifty lies I'll sift some truth.</L>
<L>'Tis true, he's of a choleric disposition,</L>
<L>And fiery parts make up his composition.</L>
<L>How have I seen him rave when things mis∣carried!</L>
<L>Indeed he's grown much tamer since he married.</L>
<L>If he succeeds, what joys his fancy strike!</L>
<L>And then he GETS—to which he's no dislike.</L>
<L>Faults he has many—but I know no crimes;</L>
<L>Yes, he has one—he contradicts sometimes:.</L>
<L>And when he falls into his frantick fit,</L>
<L>He blusters so, he makes e'en ME submit.</L>
<L>So much for him—The other youth comes next,</L>
<L>Who shews by what he says, poor soul, he's vext.</L>
<L>He tells you tales how cruelly THIS treats us,</L>

<L>AS the success of Authors is uncertain,</L>
<L>Till all is over, and down drops the curtain;</L>
<L>Poets are puzzled in our dangerous times,</L>
<L>How to address you in their after-rhymes.</L>
<L>If they implore and beg with abject mind,</L>
<L>Their meaness rather makes you sick than kind.</L>
<L>And if they bounce and huff it to the town.</L>
<L>Then you are up—and take the bullies down.</L>
<L>Of beaux and politicks and such like stuff,</L>
<L>And e'en of tawdry too, you've had enough—</L>
<L>On all degrees from courtier to the cit,</L>
<L>Such stale dull jokes have been so often writ,</L>
<L>That nothing can be new—but decency and wit.</L>
<L>Thus far our bard—The rest is mine to say,</L>
<L>I am his friend, so, will attack his play.</L>
<L><PB N="108" REF="163"/>
How could his thoughtless head with any truth</L>
<L>(If Spanish Dons are like our English youth)</L>
<L>Make his wild rake so sink from upper life,</L>
<L>To quit his mistress for a lawful wife!</L>
<L>The Author might have married him—but then</L>
<L>He should have had his mistress back again.</L>
<L>This is the scheme our English Dons pursue,</L>
<L>Tho' one's too much, there's taste in having two.</L>
<L>As for the lady, I dislike her plan,</L>
<L>With you, I'm sure, she had not pass'd for man.</L>
<L>Had she with our young bloods contriv'd this freak,</L>
<L>She had been blown and ruin'd in a week.</L>
<L>And if of virtue they could not have trick'd her,</L>
<L>They'd damn'd her for a fool—perhaps have kick'd her.</L>
<L>But jest apart—for all our bard has wrote,</L>
<L>Our most alluring bait's the petticoat.</L>
<L>Before that magick shrine the proudest fall,</L>
<L>'Tis that enchanting circle draws in all.</L>
<L>Let fools say what they will, experience teaches,</L>
<L>'Tis best to marry first—then wear the breeches.</L>

<L>They mind no more their servants, than their ladies.</L>

<P>Ha, ha, ha! Mr. Wormwood is now as much too violent in his zeal, as he was before in his prejudice. We expect not, ladies and gen∣tlemen, that this night's performance should meet with success, merely because it is English. You would be as incapable of conceiving, as we of urging, such false and contracted notions; yet, on the other hand, let not our musical brethren be cast off, because fashion, caprice, or manners, too refin'd, may have given you prejudices against them.</P>
<P>Musick is the younger sister of poetry, and can boast her charms and accomplishments. Suf∣fer not the younger then to be turned out of doors, while the elder is so warmly and deser∣vedly cherished.</P>
<L>If worthy, you'll protect her, tho' distrest,</L>

<L>Like Hamlet's ghost—'Tis here—'Tis there—'Tis gone.</L>
<L>How very few about the stage agree!</L>
<L>As men with different eyes a beauty see,</L>
<L>So judge they of that stately dame—Queen Tragedy.</L>

<LG>
<L>The Greek-read critic, as his mistress holds her,</L>

<L>A third, whose heart defies all perturbations,</L>
<L>Yet dies for triumphs, funerals, coronations!</L>
<L>Ne'er asks which tragedies succeed, or fail,</L>
<L>But whose procession has the longest tail.</L>
<L>The youths, to whom France gives a new belief,</L>

<SP>
<L>LADIES and Gentlemen—'tis so ill bred—</L>
<L>We have no Epilogue, because I'm dead;</L>
<L>For he, our bard, with frenzy-rolling eye,</L>
<L>Swears you shan't laugh, when he has made you cry.</L>
<L>At which I gave his sleeve a gentle pull,</L>
<L>Suppose they should not cry, and should be dull;</L>
<L>In such a case, 'twould surely do no harm,</L>
<L>A little lively nonsense taken warm;</L>
<L>On critic stomachs delicate and queasy,</L>
<L>'Twill ev'n make a heavy meal sit easy.</L>
<L>The town hates Epilogues—it is not true,</L>
<L>I answer'd that for you—and you—and you— <STAGE>[<HI>To Pit, Boxes, and</HI> 1<HI>st Gal.</HI></STAGE></L>
<L>They call for Epilogues and hornpipes too. <STAGE>[To the Upper Gal.</STAGE></L>
<L>Madam, the critics say,—to you they're civil,</L>
<L>Here, if they have 'em not, they'll play the devil.</L>
<L>Out of this house, sir, and to you alone,</L>
<L>They'll smile, cry bravo! charming!—Here they groan:</L>
<L><PB N="191" REF="246"/>
A single critic will not frown, look big,</L>
<L>Harmless and pliant as a single twig,</L>
<L>But crouded here they change, and 'tis not odd,</L>
<L>For twigs, when bundled up, become a rod.</L>
<L>Critics to bards, like beauties to each other,</L>
<L>When tete-a-tete their enmity they smother;</L>
<L>" Kiss me, my dear—how do you? -charming creature!</L>
<L>" What shape! what bloom! what spirit in each feature!</L>
<L>" You flatter me—'pon honor, no.—You do—</L>
<L>" My friend—my—Dear sincerely yours—adieu!"</L>
<L>But when at routs, the dear friends change their tone;</L>
<L>I speak of foreign ladies, not our own.</L>
<L>Will you permit, good firs, these gloomy folk</L>
<L>To give all tragedy without one joke?</L>
<L>They gravely tell us, Tragedy's design'd</L>
<L>To purge the passions, purify the mind;</L>
<L>To which I say, to strike those blockheads dumb,</L>
<L>With physic always give a sugar plumb;</L>
<L>I love these sugar-plumbs in prose or rhimes;</L>
<L>No one is merrier than myself sometimes;</L>
<L>Yet I, poor I, with tears and constant moan,</L>
<L>Am melted down almost to skin and bone:</L>
<L>This night, in sighs and sobs I drew my breath;</L>
<L>Love, marriage, treason, prison, poison, death,</L>
<L>Were scarce sufficient to complete my fate;</L>
<L>Two children were thrown in to make up weight.</L>

With all these sufferings, is it not provoking,</L>

<L>SINCE my good friends, tho' late, are pleas'd at last,</L>
<L>I bear with patience all my suff'rings past;</L>
<L>To you who saw my suff'rings, it is clear,</L>
<L>I bought my secrets most confounded dear.</L>
<L>To any gentleman not over nice,</L>
<L>I'll sell 'em all again, and at half price<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This Address was spoken just after the dispute relating to the admission of persons into the Theatres at half prices had been finally settled.</NOTE>.</L>
<L>Would I had been among you! for no doubt,</L>
<L>You all have secrets, could I find them out.</L>
<L>Each has a secret fitted to his fancy;</L>
<L>My friends above there—honest John and Nancy!</L>
<L><PB N="193" REF="248"/>
How well their secrets with their passions suit,</L>
<L>Hearts full of love, and pockets full of fruit,</L>
<L>Each jolly sailor thus his mistress grapples,</L>
<L>They look, and laugh, and love, and—eat their apples.</L>
<L>So good or wise this precious town is growing,</L>
<L>There's scarce a secret here, that's worth the knowing;</L>
<L>Nay, where a hungry mind expects a feast,</L>
<L>'Mongst politicians—it will get the least.</L>
<L>They promise much—seem full—stare, nod and pout,</L>
<L>But tap 'em, and the devil a drop comes out.</L>
<L>In short, I'll give this busy business over,</L>
<L>Where much is felt, and little to discover;</L>
<L>But should the ladies wish, or want t' employ me,</L>
<L>I should be proud and pleas'd if they would try me.</L>
<L>To manage meetings, or to slip a letter,</L>
<L>There's no French millener can do it better.</L>
<L>As for the gentleman—the rake, or beau—</L>
<L>I would not give 'em that—for all they know;</L>
<L>Indeed for secrets there are none excel 'em,</L>
<L>But then they make 'em, and when made, they tell 'em.</L>
<L>There is one secret still remains behind,</L>
<L>Which ever did, and will distract my mind—</L>
<L>I'd give up all for that—nay, fix for ever,</L>
<L>To find the secret—to deserve your favour.</L>

<L>I'M right—your servant, sirs—th' Address is plain—</L>
<L>To the high court of critics, Drury-lane.</L>
<L>Two ladies, sisters, women of condition,</L>
<L>Have sent by me, their <HI>courier,</HI> a <HI>petition.</HI></L>
<L>Who are these ladies should the curious ask?</L>
<L>See their broad seal, a dagger and a mask!</L>
<L>Here, <HI>Brass,</HI> take this. I answer to the name,</L>
<L>Am at their call, and for your service came.</L>
<L><PB N="197" REF="252"/>
'Tis sign'd, as you may plainly see,</L>
<L>Thalia and Melpomene,</L>
<L>Alias, Tragedy and Comedy.</L>
<L>Poor souls! they're angry; and to hint is treason</L>
<L>That angry ladies have not always reason;</L>
<L>In classic language they complain of wrong,</L>
<L>Which thus I change to mine, the vulgar tongue.</L>
<L>They set forth at large, that their case is so sad,</L>
<L>That poor Comedy weeps, and that Tragedy's mad;</L>
<L>That Op'ra, their rival, heretofore maid of ho∣nour,</L>
<L>Has got to your hearts, and has ta'en much upon her;</L>
<L>That this foreign minx has engross'd all your favours,</L>
<L>And fritter'd their passions and humour to qua∣vers;</L>
<L>That she walks cheek by jole, and won't hold up her tail;</L>
<L>So humbly they beg, that you'll send her to jail;</L>
<L>There strip her, and whip her, then send her away,</L>
<L>And, bound as in duty, for ever they'll pray.</L>
<L>My mistresses mettled, so high in their blood,</L>
<L>Would scratch poor Op'ra's eyes out, if they could.</L>

When Tragedy <HI>has barrow'd up the soul,</HI></L>
<L>Flung'd deep her dagger, or toss'd off her bowl;</L>

<L>Musick should pour her balm into the wound;</L>
<L>Or, when the Comic Lass has shook your sides,</L>
<L>That laughter swell'd so high, burst out in tides,</L>
<L>Then Musick, with its sweet enchanting strain,</L>
<L>Should to its banks lure back the tide again.</L>
<L>But how shall we your various fancies bind,</L>
<L>When ev'ry Briton has a diff'rent mind?</L>
<L>Musick's a harlot, (thus Tom Surly spoke)</L>

<L>A young one, and a good one; yet no sinner;</L>

<L>She now has other hopes, and other fears:</L>
<L>She hopes, not yet content with what is done,</L>
<L>To find more ways into your hearts than one.</L>
<L>A passion long she hid, 'till out it broke,</L>

" What joys, what raptures in my breast would spring,</L>

The terror he occasions prevents the woodcutters from working in the forest, so that wood is become dear. Those who have seen him say, he is much higher than a wolf, low before, and his feet are armed with talons. His hair is reddish, his head large, long made, and the muzzle of it shaped like that of a greyhound; his ears small and strait, his breast is wide, and of a grey colour; his back streaked with black, and his mouth, which is large, is provided with a set of teeth so very sharp, that they have taken off several heads as clean as a razor could have done. He is of amazing swiftness, but when he aims at his prey he crouches so close to the ground, that he hardly appears to be bigger than a large fox, and at the distance of one or two fathoms he rises upon his hind legs, and springs upon his prey, which he always seizes by the neck or throat. He is afraid of oxen, which he runs away from. The consternation is universal through∣out the district where he commits his ravages, and publick prayers are offered up upon this occasion."</Q></NOTE>,</L>

<L>POETS and painters, who from nature draw</L>
<L>Their best and richest stores, have made this law:</L>
<L>That each should neighbourly assist his brother,</L>
<L>And steal with decency from one another.</L>
<L>To-night, your matchless Hogarth gives the thought,</L>
<L>Which from his canvas to the stage is brought.</L>
<L>And who so fit to warm the poet's mind,</L>
<L>As he who pictur'd morals and mankind?</L>
<L>But not the same their characters and scenes;</L>
<L>Both labour for one end, by different means:</L>
<L><PB N="204" REF="259"/>
Each, as it suits him, takes a separate road,</L>
<L>Their one great object, Marriage A-la-mode!</L>
<L>Where Titles deign with Cits to have and hold,</L>
<L>And change rich blood for more substantial gold!</L>
<L>And honour'd trade from interest turns aside,</L>
<L>To hazard happiness for titled pride.</L>
<L>The painter dead, yet still he charms the eye;</L>
<L>While England lives, his fame can never die:</L>
<L>But he, who <HI>struts his hour upon the stage,</HI></L>
<L>Can scarce extend his fame for half an age;</L>
<L>Nor pen nor pencil can the Actor save,</L>

<L>BUT you good gentry, what say you to this?</L>
<L>You are to judge me—have I done amiss?</L>
<L>I've reasons will convince ye all, and strong ones,</L>
<L>Except old folks, who hanker after young ones:</L>
<L>Bud was so passionate, and grown so thrifty,</L>
<L>'Twas a sad life!—and then, he was near fifty.</L>
<L>I'm but nineteen—my husband too is young,</L>
<L>So soft, so gentle, such a winning tongue!</L>
<L>Have I, pray ladies speak, done very wrong?</L>
<L>As for poor Bud, 'twas honest to deceive him!</L>
<L>More virtuous sure to cheat him, than to grieve him.</L>
<L>Great folk, I know, will call me simple slut,</L>
<L>Marry for love, they cry; the country put!</L>
<L>Marriage with them's a fashion—soon grows cool;</L>
<L>But I'm for loving always, like a fool.</L>
<L>With half my fortune I would rather part,</L>
<L>Than be all finery with an aching heart.</L>
<L>For these strange aukward notions don't abuse me,</L>
<L>And as I know no better—pray excuse me!</L>

<L>EXHAUSTED quite with prisons, racks, and death,</L>

<L>Say, lords of the creation, mighty men!</L>
<L>In what have you surpass'd us? where? and when?</L>
<L>I come to know to whom the palm is due:</L>
<L>To us weak vessels, or to stronger you?</L>
<L>Against your conqu'ring swords I draw—my fan.</L>
<L>Come on—now parry Marg'ret<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Marg'ret of Anjou; the character in the play performed by Mrs. Yates.</NOTE>, if you can. <STAGE>(Sets herself in a posture of defence.</STAGE></L>

<L>Are you for pleasure, politicks, or wit?</L>
<L>The Boxes smile to see me scold the Pit.</L>
<L><PB N="217" REF="272"/>
Their turn is next—and, tho' I will not wrong 'em,</L>
<L>A woeful havock there will be among 'em.</L>
<L>You, our best friends, love, cherish, and respect us;</L>
<L>Not take our fortunes, marry, and neglect us.</L>
<L>You think, indeed, that, as you please, you rule us,</L>
<L>And with a strange importance often school us!</L>
<L>Yet let each citizen describe a brother,</L>
<L>I'll tell you what you say of one another.</L>
<L><HI>My neighbour leads, poor soul, a woeful life,</HI></L>
<L><HI>A worthy man—but govern'd by his wife!</HI></L>
<L>How say you? what, all silent! then 'tis true:</L>
<L>We rule the city—now, great sirs, to <HI>you.</HI> <STAGE>(To the Boxes.</STAGE></L>
<L>What is your boast? Would you like me have done,</L>
<L>To free a captive wife, or save a son?</L>
<L>Rather than run such dangers of your lives,</L>
<L>You'd leave your children, and lock up your wives.</L>
<L>When with your noblest deeds a nation rings,</L>
<L>You are but puppets, and we play the strings.</L>
<L>We plan no battles—true—but out of fight,</L>
<L>Crack goes the fan—and armies halt or fight!</L>
<L>You have the advantage, ladies! wisely reap it,</L>
<L>And let me hint the only way to keep it:</L>
<L>Let men of mean ideas have their fill,</L>
<L>Frown, bounce, stride, strut, while you with happy skill,</L>

Like anglers, use the finest silken thread;</L>
<L>Give line enough—nor check a tugging head:</L>
