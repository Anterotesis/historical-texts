<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The following poem represents Commerce as the child of Neptune, and born on the coast of Libya in an island, celebrated in fabulous antiquity for its fruitfulness and plenty during the first uncultivated ages, whence the new divinity is supposed to convey these blessings round the world. Her birth is attended by many of the Gods, who endow her with their several gifts: among the rest Apollo appoints her to be the inventress of letters; Sir Isaac Newton's opinion being here alluded to, that merchandize gave rise to this wonderful discovery. Commerce is then described as making her first appear∣ance to the world among the Phoenicians, the earliest people, who exercis'd an extensive trade. From thence she proceeds to visit other parts of the globe, and endea∣vours to erect her principal empire at Carthage, situated in Libya, the country assign'd for her nativity. Upon the destruction of that city she again removes from place to place; but at length, allured by the vigour and singular resolution of the Dutch in throwing off the Spanish yoke, she takes up her residence with that inde∣fatigable people. Lastly, by the good laws, which have been made from time to time for the encouragement of trade among us, especially by the act of navigation, which has transferred a great part of the Dutch traf∣fick to ourselves, she is suppos'd on our invitation to choose England for her chief abode, more particularly London, our principal emporium, as well as capital
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
city. And upon this occasion an enquiry is made, how it has come to pass, that, notwithstanding the great wealth and power attending Commerce, the course of trade should so often have shifted its seat; and the means, conceived most effectual to fix this wanderer here, are pointed out.</P>

<L N="25">Her various wandrings from the fated hour,</L>
<L>That she abandon'd her maternal clime;</L>
<L>Neptunian Commerce, whom Phoenicé bore,</L>

<L>To mark the heaving tide, the piercing eye</L>
<L N="35">Of Neptune view'd enamour'd: from the deep</L>
<L>The God ascending rushes to the beach,</L>
<L>And clasps th' affrighted virgin. From that day</L>

<L>Which gently roll'd beside her, now no more</L>
<L N="45">With placid eyes beholding, thus exclaim'd.</L>

<LG>
<L>YE fragrant shrubs, and cedars' lofty shade,</L>
<L>Which crown my native hills, ye spreading palms,</L>
<L>That rise majestic on these fruitful meads,</L>
<L>With you, who gave the lost Phoenicé birth,</L>
<L N="50">And you, who bear th' endearing name of friends,</L>
<L>Once faithful partners of my chaster hours,</L>
<L>Farewel! To thee, perfidious God, I come,</L>

<LG>
<L>SHE ceas'd, when sudden from th' unclosing deep</L>
<L>A crystal car emerg'd, with glitt'ring shells,</L>
<L>Call'd from their oozy beds by Tethys' train,</L>
<L N="60"><PB N="6" REF="7"/>And blushing coral deck'd, whose ruddy glow</L>
<L>Mix'd with the watry lustre of the pearl.</L>
<L>A smiling band of sea-born nymphs attend,</L>
<L>Who from the shore with gentle hands convey</L>
<L>The fear-subdu'd Phoenicé, and along</L>
<L N="65">The lucid chariot place. As there with dread</L>
<L>All mute, and struggling with her painful throes</L>
<L>She lay, the winds by Neptune's high command</L>
<L>Were silent round her; not a Zephyr dar'd</L>
<L>To wanton o'er the cedar's branching top,</L>
<L N="70">Nor on the plain the stately palm was seen</L>
<L>To wave its graceful verdure; o'er the main</L>
<L>No undulation broke the smooth expanse,</L>

<L>All but the lightly-sliding car, impell'd</L>
<L N="75">Along the level azure by the strength</L>
<L>Of active Tritons, rivalling in speed</L>
