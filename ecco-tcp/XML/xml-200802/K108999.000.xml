<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>THE AUTHOR of the following ESSAY was sol∣licitous only for the honour of <HI>Shakespeare:</HI> he hath however, in <HI>his own</HI> capacity, little reason to complain of <HI>occasional</HI> Criticks, or Criticks <HI>by profession.</HI> The very FEW, who have been pleased to controvert any part of his Doctrine, have favoured him with better manners, than arguments; and claim his thanks for a further opportunity of demonstrating the futility of <HI>Theoretick</HI> reasoning against <HI>Matter of Fact.</HI> It is indeed strange, that any <HI>real</HI> Friends of our immortal POET should be still willing to force him into a situation, which is not tenable: treat him as a <HI>learned</HI> Man, and what shall excuse the most gross violations of History, Chronology, and Geo∣graphy?</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is the Motto of every <HI>Polemick:</HI> like his Brethren at the <HI>Amphitheatre,</HI> he holds it a merit to <HI>die hard</HI>; and will not say, <HI>Enough,</HI> though the Battle be decided. "Were it shewn, says some one, that the old Bard borrowed <HI>all</HI> his allusions from <HI>English</HI> books then published, our <HI>Essayist</HI> might have possibly established his System."
<PB REF="4"/>
—In good time! —This had scarcely been at∣tempted by <HI>Peter Burman</HI> himself, with the Library of <HI>Shakespeare</HI> before him. — "Truly, as Mr. <HI>Dogberry</HI> says, for <HI>mine own</HI> part, if I were as tedious as a King, I could find in my heart to bestow it all on this Subject:" but where should I meet with a Reader? — When the main Pillars are taken away, the whole Building falls in course: Nothing hath been, or can be, pointed out, which is not easily removed; or rather, which was not <HI>virtually</HI> removed before: a very little <HI>Analogy</HI> will do the business. I shall there∣fore have no occasion to trouble myself any further; and may venture to call my Pamphlet, in the words of a pleasant Declaimer against <HI>Sermons on the thirtieth of January,</HI> "an Answer to every thing that shall hereafter be written on the Subject."</P>
<P>But "this method of reasoning will prove any one ignorant of the Languages, who hath written when Translations were extant." — <HI>Shade</HI> of <HI>Burgersdi∣cius!</HI> — does it follow, because <HI>Shakespeare's</HI> early life was incompatible with a course of Education—whose Contemporaries, Friends and Foes, nay, and himself likewise, agree in his want of what is usually called <HI>Literature</HI> —whose mistakes from equivocal Transla∣tions, and even typographical Errors, cannot possibly be accounted for otherwise, —that <HI>Locke,</HI> to whom not one of these circumstances is applicable, under∣stood no <HI>Greek?</HI> —I suspect, <HI>Rollin's</HI> Opinion of our Philosopher was not founded on this argument.</P>
<P><HI>Shakespeare</HI> wanted not the Stilts of Languages to raise him above all other men. The quotation from <HI>Lilly</HI> in the <HI>Taming of the Shrew,</HI> if indeed it be his, strongly proves the extent of his reading: had he known <HI>Terence,</HI> he would not have quoted erroneously
<PB REF="5"/>
from his <HI>Grammar.</HI> Every one hath met with men in common life, who, according to the language of the <HI>Water-poet,</HI> "got only from <HI>Possum</HI> to <HI>Posset,"</HI> and yet will throw out a line occasionally from their <HI>Accidence</HI> or their <HI>Cato de Moribus</HI> with tolerable pro∣priety. — If, however, the old Editions be trusted in this passage, our Author's memory somewhat fail∣ed him in point of <HI>Concord.</HI></P>
<P>The rage of <HI>Parallelisms</HI> is almost over, and in truth nothing can be more absurd. "THIS was stolen from <HI>one</HI> Classick, — THAT from <HI>another</HI>;"— and had I not stept in to his rescue, poor <HI>Shakespeare</HI> had been stript as naked of ornament, as when he first <HI>held Horses</HI> at the door of the Playhouse.</P>
<P>The late ingenious and modest Mr. <HI>Dodsley</HI> de∣clared himself
<Q>"Untutor'd in the lore of <HI>Greece</HI> or <HI>Rome:"</HI></Q>
Yet let us take a passage at a venture from any of his performances, and a thousand to one, it is stolen. Suppose it be his celebrated Compliment to the <HI>Ladies,</HI> in one of his earliest pieces, <HI>The Toy-shop:</HI> "A good Wife makes the cares of the World sit easy, and adds a sweetness to its pleasures; she is a Man's best Companion in Prosperity, and his only Friend in Adversity; the carefullest preserver of his Health, and the kindest Attendant in his Sickness; a faithful Adviser in Distress, a Comforter in Afflic∣tion, and a prudent Manager in all his domestic Af∣fairs."—<HI>Plainly,</HI> from a fragment of <HI>Euripides</HI> pre∣served by <HI>Stobaeus.</HI></P>

<P><PB REF="6"/><HI>Malvolio</HI> in the <HI>Twelfth-Night</HI> of <HI>Shakespeare</HI> hath some expressions very similar to <HI>Alnaschar</HI> in the <HI>Ara∣bian Tales:</HI> which perhaps may be sufficient for <HI>some</HI> Criticks to prove his acquaintance with <HI>Arabic!</HI></P>
<P>It seems however, at last, that <HI>"Taste</HI> should de∣termine the matter." This, as <HI>Bardolph</HI> expresses it, is a <HI>word of exceeding good command:</HI> but I am willing, that the Standard itself be somewhat better ascertain∣ed before it be opposed to demonstrative Evidence. — Upon the whole, I may consider myself, as the <HI>Pioneer</HI> of the <HI>Commentators:</HI> I have removed a deal of <HI>learned Rubbish,</HI> and pointed out to them <HI>Shake∣speare's</HI> track in the ever-pleasing <HI>Paths of Nature.</HI> This was necessarily a previous Inquiry; and I hope I may assume with some confidence, what one of the first Criticks of the Age was pleased to declare on reading the former Edition, that "The Question is <HI>now</HI> for ever decided."<NOTE N="⁂" PLACE="foot"><P>I may just remark, lest they be mistaken for <HI>Errata,</HI> that the word <HI>Catherine</HI> in the 47th page is writ∣ten, according to the old Orthography, for <HI>Catherine</HI>; and that the passage in the 51st page is copied from <HI>Up∣ton,</HI> who improperly calls <HI>Horatio</HI> and <HI>Marcellus</HI> in <HI>Ham∣let,</HI> "the <HI>Centinels."</HI></P><P>In p. 23. l. 23. for <HI>had probably</HI> read <HI>might have</HI> &amp;c.</P></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE LEARNING OF SHAKESPEARE: ADDRESSED TO JOSEPH CRADOCK, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>"SHAKESPEARE, says a Brother of the <HI>Craft,</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Seward</HI> in his Preface to <HI>Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher,</HI> 10 Vol. 8vo. 1750.</NOTE> is a vast garden of criticism:" and certainly no one can be favoured with more weeders <HI>gratis.</HI></P>
<P>But how often, my dear Sir, are weeds and flowers torn up indiscriminately?— the ravaged spot is re-planted in a moment, and a profusion of cri∣tical thorns thrown over it for security.</P>
<P>"A prudent man therefore would not venture his fingers amongst them."</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="8"/>Be however in little pain for your friend, who re∣gards himself sufficiently to be cautious:—yet he as∣serts with confidence, that no improvement can be expected, whilst the natural soil is mistaken for a hot-bed, and the Natives of the banks of <HI>Avon</HI> are scientifically choked with the culture of exoticks.</P>
<P>Thus much for metaphor; it is contrary to the <HI>Statute</HI> to fly out so early: but who can tell, whe∣ther it may not be demonstrated by some critick or other, that a deviation from rule is peculiarly happy in an Essay of <HI>Shakespeare!</HI></P>
<P>You have long known my opinion concerning the literary acquisitions of our immortal Dramatist; and remember how I congratulated myself on my coincidence with the last and best of his Editors. I told you however, that his <HI>small Latin and less Greek</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">This passage of <HI>Ben. Jonson,</HI> so often quoted, is giv∣en us in the admirable preface to the late Edition, with a various reading, "small Latin and <HI>no</HI> Greek," which hath been held up to the Publick for a modern sophisti∣cation: yet whether an error or not, it was adopted a∣bove a Century ago by <HI>W. Towers</HI> in a Panegyrick on <HI>Cartwright.</HI> His Eulogy, with more than fifty others, on this now forgotten Poet, was prefixed to the Edit. 1651.</NOTE> would still be litigated, and you see very assu∣redly that I was not mistaken. The trumpet hath been sounded against "the darling project of repre∣senting <HI>Shakespeare</HI> as one of the illiterate vulgar;" and indeed to so good purpose, that I would by all means recommend the performer to the army of
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
the <HI>braying Faction,</HI> recorded by <HI>Cervantes.</HI> The testimony of his contemporaries is again disputed; constant tradition is opposed by flimsy arguments; and nothing is heard, but confusion and nonsense. One could scarcely imagine this a topick very like∣ly to inflame the passions: it is asserted by <HI>Dryden,</HI> that "those who accuse him to have wanted learn∣ing, give him the greatest commendation;" yet an attack upon an article of faith hath been usually re∣ceived with more temper and complacence, than the unfortunate opinion, which I am about to defend.</P>
<P>But let us previously lament with every lover of <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> that the Question was not fully discussed by Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI> himself: what he sees intuitively, others must arrive at by a series of proofs; and I have not time to <HI>teach</HI> with precision: be contented therefore with a few cursory observations, as they may happen to arise from the Chaos of Papers, you have so often laughed at, "a stock sufficient to set up an <HI>Editor in form."</HI> I am convinced of the strength of my cause, and superior to any little ad∣vantage from sophistical arrangements.</P>
<P>General positions without proofs will probably have no great weight on either side, yet it may not seem fair to suppress them: take them therefore as their authors occur to me, and we will afterward proceed to particulars.</P>
<P>The testimony of <HI>Ben.</HI> stands foremost; and
<PB N="4" REF="10" MS="y"/>
some have held it sufficient to decide the contro∣versy: in the warmest Panegyrick, that ever was written, he apologizes<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>"Though</HI> thou hadst <HI>small Latin,</HI> &amp;c."</NOTE> for what <HI>he</HI> supposed the only defect in his "beloved friend,—
<Q><L>——— Soul of the age!</L>
<L>Th' applause! delight! the wonder of our stage!—</L></Q>
whose memory he honoured almost to idolatry:" and conscious of the worth of ancient literature, like any other man on the same occasion, he rather carries his acquirements <HI>above,</HI> than <HI>below</HI> the truth. "Jealousy! cries Mr. <HI>Upton</HI>; People will allow others any qualities, but those upon which they highly value <HI>themselves."</HI> Yes, where there <HI>is</HI> a competition, and the competitor formidable: but, I think, this Critick himself hath scarcely set in op∣position the learning of <HI>Shakespeare</HI> and <HI>Jonson.</HI> When a superiority is universally granted, it by no means appears a man's literary interest to depress the re∣putation of his Antagonist.</P>
<P>In truth the received opinion of the pride and malignity of <HI>Jonson,</HI> at least in the earlier part of life, is absolutely groundless: at this time scarce a play or a poem appeared without <HI>Ben's</HI> encomium, from the original <HI>Shakespeare</HI> to the translator of <HI>Du Bartas.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Jonson</HI> is by no means our only authority.
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
<HI>Drayton</HI> the countryman and acquaintance of <HI>Shake∣speare,</HI> determines his excellence to the <HI>naturall Braine</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">In his Elegie on Poets and Poesie. p. 206. Fol. 1627.</NOTE> only. <HI>Digges,</HI> a wit of the town before our Poet left the stage, is very strong to the pur∣pose,
<Q><L>— "Nature only helpt him, for looke thorow</L>
<L>This whole book, thou shalt find he doth not borow</L>
<L>One phrase from Greekes, not Latines imitate,</L>
<L>Nor once from vulgar Languages translate."<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">From his Poem "upon Master <HI>William Shakespeare,"</HI> intended to have been prefixed, with the other of his composition, to the Folio of 1623; and afterward print∣ed in several miscellaneous Collections: particularly the spurious Edition of <HI>Shakespeare's</HI> Poems, 1640. Some account of him may be met with in <HI>Wood's Athenae.</HI></NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Suckling</HI> opposes his <HI>easier strain</HI> to the <HI>sweat of learned Jonson. Denham</HI> assures us, that all he had was from <HI>old Mother-wit. His native wood-notes wild,</HI> every one remembers to be celebrated by <HI>Milton. Dryden</HI> observes prettily enough, that "he wanted not the spectacles of books to read Nature." He came out of her hand, as some one else expresses it, like <HI>Pallas</HI> out of <HI>Jove's</HI> head, at full growth and mature.</P>
<P>The ever memorable <HI>Hales</HI> of <HI>Eton,</HI> (who, notwith∣standing his Epithet, is, I fear, almost forgotten,) had too great a knowledge both of <HI>Shakespeare</HI> and the
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
Ancients to allow much acquaintance between them: and urged very justly on the part of Genius in oppo∣sition to Pedantry, That "if he had not <HI>read</HI> the Classicks, he had likewise not <HI>stolen</HI> from them; and if any Topick was produced from a Poet of antiquity he would undertake to show somewhat on the same subject, at least as well written by <HI>Shakespeare."</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fuller,</HI> a diligent and equal searcher after truth and quibbles, declares positively, that "his learning was very little,—<HI>Nature</HI> was all the <HI>Art</HI> used upon him, as <HI>he himself,</HI> if alive, would confess." And may we not say, he did confess it, when he apologized for his <HI>untutored lines</HI> to his noble patron the Earl of <HI>Southampton?</HI> —this list of witnesses might be easily enlarged; but I flatter myself, I shall stand in no need of such evidence.</P>
<P>One of the first and most vehement assertors of the learning of <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> was the Editor of his Poems, the well-known Mr. <HI>Gildon</HI>;<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hence perhaps the <HI>ill-star'd rage</HI> between this Critick and his elder Brother, <HI>John Dennis,</HI> so pathetically la∣mented in the <HI>Dunciad.</HI> Whilst the former was persuaded, that "the man who doubts of the Learning of <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> hath none of his own:" the latter, above regarding the attack in his <HI>private</HI> capacity, declares with great pa∣triotic vehemence, that "he who allows <HI>Shakespeare</HI> had Learning, and a familiar acquaintance with the Ancients, ought to be looked upon as a detractor from the Glory of <HI>Great Britain." Dennis</HI> was expelled his College for at∣tempting to stab a man in the dark: <HI>Pope</HI> would have been glad of this anecdote.</NOTE> and his steps
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
were most punctually taken by a subsequent labourer in the same department, Dr. <HI>Sewel.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> supposed "little ground for the common opinion of his want of learning:" once indeed he made a proper distinction between <HI>learning</HI> and <HI>lan∣guages,</HI> as I would be understood to do in my Title-page; but unfortunately he forgot it in the course of his disquisition, and endeavoured to persuade himself that <HI>Shakespeare's</HI> acquaintance with the Ancients might be actually proved by the same medium as <HI>Jonson's.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Theobald</HI> is "very unwilling to allow him so poor a scholar, as many have laboured to represent him;" and yet is "cautious of declaring too posi∣tively on the other side the question."</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Warburton</HI> hath exposed the weakness of some arguments from <HI>suspected</HI> imitations; and yet offers others, which, I doubt not, he could as easily have refuted.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Upton</HI> wonders "with what kind of reasoning any one could be so far imposed upon, as to imagine that <HI>Shakespeare</HI> had no learning;" and lashes with much zeal and satisfaction "the pride and pertness of dunces, who under such a name would gladly shelter their own idleness and ignorance."</P>
<P>He, like the learned Knight, at every anomaly in grammar or metre,
<Q><L>"Hath hard words ready to shew why,</L>
<L>And tell what <HI>Rule</HI> he did it by."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="14"/>How would the old Bard have been astonished to have found, that he had very skilfully given the <HI>trochaic dimeter brachycatalectic,</HI> COMMONLY called the <HI>ithyphallic</HI> measure, to the Witches in <HI>Macheth!</HI> and that now and then a halting Verse afforded a most beautiful instance of the <HI>Pes proceleusmaticus!</HI></P>
<P>"But, continues Mr. <HI>Upton,</HI> it was a learned age; <HI>Roger Ascham</HI> assures us, that Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> read more <HI>Greek</HI> every day, than some <HI>Dignitaries</HI> of the Church did <HI>Latin</HI> in a whole week." This appears very probable; and a pleasant proof it is of the gene∣ral learning of the times, and of <HI>Shakespeare</HI> in par∣ticular. I wonder, he did not corroborate it with an extract from her injunctions to her Clergy, that "such as were but <HI>mean Readers</HI> should peruse over before, once or twice, the Chapters and Homilies, to the intent they might read to the better under∣standing of the people."</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Grey</HI> declares, that <HI>Shakespeare's</HI> knowledge in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> tongues cannot <HI>reasonably</HI> be call∣ed in question. Dr. <HI>Dodd</HI> supposes it <HI>proved,</HI> that he was not such a novice in learning and antiquity as <HI>some people</HI> would pretend. And to close the whole, for I suspect you to be tired of quotation, Mr. <HI>Whalley,</HI> the ingenious Editor of <HI>Jonson,</HI> hath written a piece expressly on this side the question: perhaps from a very excusable partiality, he was willing to draw
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
<HI>Shakespeare</HI> from the field of Nature to classick ground, where alone, he knew, his Author could possibly cope with him.</P>
<P>These criticks, and many others their coadjutors, have supposed themselves able to trace <HI>Shakespeare</HI> in the writings of the Ancients; and have sometimes persuaded us of their own learning, whatever became of their Author's. Plagiarisms have been discovered in every natural description and every moral senti∣ment. Indeed by the kind assistance of the various <HI>Excerpta, Sententiae,</HI> and <HI>Flores,</HI> this business may be effected with very little expense of time or sagacity; as <HI>Addison</HI> hath demonstrated in his Comment on <HI>Chevy-chace,</HI> and <HI>Wagstaff</HI> on <HI>Tom Thumb:</HI> and I my∣self will engage to give you quotations from the elder <HI>English</HI> writers (for to own the truth, I was once idle enough to collect such) which shall carry with them at least an equal degree of similarity. But there can be no occasion of wasting any future time in this de∣partment: the world is now in possession of the <HI>Marks of Imitation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>"Shakespeare</HI> however hath frequent allusions to the <HI>facts</HI> and <HI>fables</HI> of antiquity." Granted:—and as <HI>Mat. Prior</HI> says, to save the effusion of more Christian ink, I will endeavour to shew, how they came to his acquaintance.</P>
<P>It is notorious, that much of his <HI>matter of fact</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
knowledge is deduced from <HI>Plutarch:</HI> but in what language he read him, hath yet been the question. Mr. <HI>Upton</HI> is pretty confident of his skill in the Ori∣ginal, and corrects accordingly the <HI>Errors of his Copyists</HI> by the <HI>Greek</HI> standard. Take a few instances, which will elucidate this matter sufficiently.</P>
<P>In the third act of <HI>Anthony</HI> and <HI>Cleopatra, Octavius</HI> represents to his Courtiers the imperial pomp of those illustrious lovers, and the arrangement of their dominion,
<Q><L>————"Unto her</L>
<L>He gave the 'stablishment of Egypt, made her</L>
<L>Of lower Syria, Cyprus, <HI>Lydia,</HI></L>
<L>Absolute Queen."</L></Q></P>
<P>Read <HI>Libya,</HI> says the critick <HI>authoritatively,</HI> as is plain from <HI>Plutarch,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>This is very true: Mr. <HI>Heath</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">It is extraordinary, that this Gentleman should at∣tempt so voluminous a work, as the <HI>Revisal of Shakespeare's Text,</HI> when, he tells us in his Preface, "he was not so fortunate as to be furnished with either of the <HI>Folio</HI> Edi∣tions, much less any of the ancient <HI>Quarto's:"</HI> and even "Sir <HI>Thomas Hanmer's</HI> performance was known to him only by Mr. <HI>Warburton's</HI> representation."</NOTE> accedes to the cor∣rection, and Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI> admits it into the Text: but turn to the translation, from the French of <HI>Amyot,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
by <HI>Thomas North,</HI> in <HI>Folio</HI> 1579;<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">I find the character of this work pretty early deline∣ated; <Q><L>"'Twas <HI>Greek</HI> at first, that <HI>Greek</HI> was <HI>Latin</HI> made,</L><L>That <HI>Latin French,</HI> that <HI>French</HI> to <HI>English</HI> straid:</L><L>Thus 'twixt one <HI>Plutarch</HI> there's more difference,</L><L>Than i'th' same <HI>Englishman</HI> return'd from <HI>France."</HI></L></Q></NOTE> and you will at once see the origin of the mistake.</P>
<P>"First of all he did establish <HI>Cleopatra</HI> Queene of Aegypt, of Cyprus, of <HI>Lydia,</HI> and the lower Syria."</P>
<P>Again in the Fourth Act,
<Q><L>——— "My messenger</L>
<L>He hath whipt with rods, dares me to personal combat,</L>
<L><HI>Caesar</HI> to <HI>Anthony.</HI> Let th' old Ruffian know</L>
<L>I have many other ways to die; mean time</L>
<L>Laugh at his challenge."—</L></Q></P>
<P>"What a reply is this, cries Mr. <HI>Upton?</HI> 'tis ac∣knowledging he should fall under the unequal com∣bat. But if we read,
<Q><L>——— "Let th' old Ruffian know</L>
<L><HI>He</HI> hath many other ways to die; mean time</L>
<L><HI>I</HI> laugh at his challenge."—</L></Q>
We have the poignancy and the very repartee of <HI>Caesar</HI> in <HI>Plutarch."</HI></P>
<P>This correction was first made by Sir <HI>Thomas Han∣mer,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI> hath received it. Most indis∣putably it is the sense of <HI>Plutarch,</HI> and given so in the modern translations: but <HI>Shakespeare</HI> was misled by the ambiguity of the old one, <HI>"Antonius</HI> sent again
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
to challenge <HI>Caesar</HI> to fight him: <HI>Caesar</HI> answered, That <HI>he</HI> had many other ways to die, than so."</P>
<P>In the Third Act of <HI>Julius Caesar, Anthony</HI> in his well-known harangue to the people, repeats a part of the Emperor's will,
<Q><L>— "To every Roman citizen he gives,</L>
<L>To every sev'ral man, seventy five drachma's —</L>
<L>Moreover he hath left you all his walks,</L>
<L>His private arbours, and new-planted orchards,</L>
<L>On <HI>this</HI> side Tyber."—</L></Q></P>
<P>"Our Author certainly wrote, says Mr. <HI>Theobald,</HI> On <HI>that</HI> side Tyber—
<Q><HI>Travs</HI> Tiberim—prope Caesaris hortos.</Q>
And <HI>Plutarch,</HI> whom <HI>Shakespeare</HI> very diligently <HI>studied</HI> expressly declares, that he left the publick his gardens and walks, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>beyond</HI> the <HI>Tyber."</HI></P>
<P>This emendation likewise hath been adopted by the subsequent Editors; but hear again the old Translation, where <HI>Shakespeare's study</HI> lay, "He be∣queathed unto every citizen of Rome, seventy-five drachmas a man, and he left his gardens and arbours unto the people, which he had on <HI>this</HI> side of the river of Tyber." I could furnish you with many more instances, but these are as good as a thousand.</P>
<P>Hence had our author his characteristick know∣ledge of <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Anthony,</HI> upon which much ar∣gumentation for his learning hath been founded: and
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
hence <HI>literatim</HI> the Epitaph on <HI>Timon,</HI> which it was once presumed, he had corrected from the blunders of the Latin version, by his own superior knowledge of the Original.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Theobald's</HI> Preface to K. <HI>Richard</HI> 2d. 8vo. 1720.</NOTE></P>
<P>I cannot however omit a passage of Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI> "The <HI>speeches</HI> copy'd from <HI>Plutarch</HI> in <HI>Coriolanus</HI> may, I think, be as well made an instance of the learning of <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> as those copy'd from <HI>Cicero</HI> in <HI>Catiline,</HI> of <HI>Ben. Jonson's."</HI> Let us inquire into this matter, and transcribe a <HI>speech</HI> for a specimen. Take the famous one of <HI>Volumnia.</HI></P>
<Q><L>"Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment</L>
<L>And state of bodies would bewray what life</L>
<L>We've led since thy Exile. Think with thyself,</L>
<L>How more unfortunate than all living women</L>

<P>"This, says Dr. <HI>Dodd,</HI> is a good deal in the man∣ner of the celebrated <HI>drinking Ode,</HI> too well known to be inserted." Yet it may be alleged by those, who imagine <HI>Shakespeare</HI> to have been generally able to think for himself, that the topicks are obvious, and their application is different.—But for argument's sake, let the Parody be granted; and "our Author, says some one, may be puzzled to prove, that there was a <HI>Latin</HI> translation of <HI>Anacreon</HI> at the time <HI>Shake∣speare</HI> wrote his <HI>Timon of Athens."</HI> This challenge is peculiarly unhappy: for I do not at present recol∣lect any <HI>other Classick,</HI> (if indeed, with great deference to <HI>Mynheer De Pauw, Anacreon</HI> may be numbered amongst them) that was <HI>originally</HI> published with <HI>two Latin</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">By <HI>Henry Stephens</HI> and <HI>Elias Andreas.

<P><PB N="26" REF="32"/>Sometimes a very little matter detects a forgery.

<L>From each good <HI>Aspect</HI> takes away my trust."</L></Q>
And in another place,
<Q>"You have an <HI>Aspect,</HI> Sir, of wondrous wisdom."</Q>
The word <HI>Aspect,</HI> you perceive, is here accented on the <HI>first</HI> Syllable, which, I am confident, in <HI>any</HI> sense of it, was never the case in the time of <HI>Shakespeare</HI>; though it may sometimes appear to be so, when we do not observe a preceding <HI>Elision.</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Thus a line in <HI>Hamlet's</HI> description of the <HI>Player,</HI> should be printed as in the old Folio's, <Q>"Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspéct."</Q> agreeably to the accent in a hundred other places.</NOTE></P>

I could point out to you several performances in the respective <HI>Styles</HI> of <HI>Chaucer, Spenser,</HI> and <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> which the <HI>imitated</HI> Bard could not possibly have either read or construed.</P>
<P>This very accent hath troubled the Annotators on <HI>Milton.</HI> Dr. <HI>Bentley</HI> observes it to be "a <HI>tone</HI> different from the present use." Mr. <HI>Manwaring,</HI> in his <HI>Treatise of Harmony and Numbers,</HI> very solemnly informs us, that "this Verse is defective both in Accent and Quantity, B. 3. V. 266.
<Q><L>"His words here ended, but his meek <HI>Aspéct</HI></L>
<L>Silent yet spake."—</L></Q>
Here, says he, a syllable is <HI>acuted</HI> and <HI>long,</HI> whereas it should be <HI>short</HI> and <HI>graved!"</HI></P>
<P>And a still more extraordinary Gentleman, one <HI>Green,</HI> who published a Specimen of a <HI>new Version</HI> of the <HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> into BLANK verse, "by which that amazing Work is brought somewhat nearer the Summit of Perfection," begins with correcting a blunder in the fourth book, V. 540.

<L><HI>Not so</HI> in the <HI>New Version.</HI></L>
<L>"Meanwhile the setting Sun descending slow—</L>

Enough of such Commentators.—The celebrated
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> had a <HI>Spirit,</HI> who would sometimes conde∣scend to correct him, when peccant in <HI>Quantity:</HI> and it had been kind of him to have a little assisted the <HI>Wights</HI> abovementioned. —<HI>Milton</HI> affected the <HI>Antique</HI>; but it may seem more extraordinary, that the old Accent should be adopted in <HI>Hudibras.</HI></P>
<P>After all, the <HI>Double Falshood</HI> is superior to <HI>Theobald.</HI> One passage, and one only in the whole Play, he pretended to have written:
<Q><L>——— "Strike up, my Masters;</L>
<L>"But touch the Strings with a religious softness:</L>
<L>"Teach sound to languish thro' the Night's dull Ear,</L>
<L>"'Till Melancholy start from her lazy Couch,</L>
<L>"And Carelessness grow Convert to Attention."</L></Q></P>
<P>These lines were particularly admired; and his vanity could not resist the opportunity of claiming them: but his claim had been more easily allowed to <HI>any other</HI> part of the performance.</P>
<P>To whom then shall we ascribe it? — Somebody hath told us, who should seem to be a <HI>Nostrum∣monger</HI> by his argument, that, let <HI>Accents</HI> be how they will, it is called <HI>an original Play of William Shakespeare</HI> in the <HI>King's Patent,</HI> prefixed to Mr. <HI>Theobald's</HI> Edition, 1728, and consequently there <HI>could</HI> be no fraud in the matter. Whilff, on the con∣trary, the <HI>Irish</HI> Laureat, Mr. <HI>Victor,</HI> remarks, (and were it true, it would be certainly decisive) that the

But unluckily the same Novel appears in a part of <HI>Don Quixote,</HI> which was printed in <HI>Spanish,</HI> 1605, and in <HI>English</HI> by <HI>Shelton,</HI> 1612. — The same reasoning however, which exculpated our Author from the <HI>Yorkshire Tragedy,</HI> may be applied on the present oc∣casion.</P>
<P>But you want <HI>my</HI> opinion: —and from every mark of Style and Manner, I make no doubt of ascribing it to <HI>Shirley.</HI> Mr. <HI>Langbaine</HI> informs us, that he left some Plays in MS. — These were written about the time of the <HI>Restoration,</HI> when the <HI>Accent</HI> in question was more generally altered.</P>
<P>Perhaps the mistake arose from an <HI>abbreviation</HI> of the name. Mr. <HI>Dodsley</HI> knew not that the Tragedy of <HI>Andromana</HI> was <HI>Shirley's,</HI> from the very same cause. Thus a whole stream of Biographers tell us, that <HI>Marston's</HI> Plays were printed at <HI>London,</HI> 1633, "by the care of <HI>William Shakespeare,</HI> the famous Come∣dian."—Here again I suppose, in some Transcript, the real Publisher's name, <HI>William Sheares,</HI> was <HI>ab∣breviated.</HI> No one hath protracted the life of <HI>Shake∣speare</HI> beyond 1616, except Mr. <HI>Hume</HI>; who is pleased to add a year to it, in contradiction to all manner of evidence.</P>
<P><HI>Shirley</HI> is spoken of with contempt in <HI>Mac Flecknoe</HI>;
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>
but his Imagination is sometimes fine to an extraordi∣nary degree. I recollect a passage in the fourth book of the <HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> which hath been suspected of <HI>Imita∣tion,</HI> as a <HI>prettiness</HI> below the Genius of <HI>Milton:</HI> I mean, where <HI>Uriel</HI> glides <HI>backward and forward</HI> to Heaven on a <HI>Sun-beam.</HI> Dr. <HI>Newton</HI> informs us, that this might possibly be hinted by a Picture of <HI>Annibal Car∣racci</HI> in the King of <HI>France's</HI> Cabinet: but I am apt to believe that <HI>Milton</HI> had been struck with a Portrait in <HI>Shirley. Fernando,</HI> in the Comedy of the <HI>Brothers,</HI> 1652, describes <HI>Jacinta</HI> at <HI>Vespers:</HI>
<Q><L>"Her eye did seem to labour with a tear,</L>
<L>Which suddenly took birth, but overweigh'd</L>
<L>With it's own swelling, drop'd upon her bosome;</L>
<L>Which by reflexion of her light, appear'd</L>
<L>As nature meant her sorrow for an ornament:</L>
<L>After, her looks grew chearfull, and I saw</L>
<L>A smile shoot gracefull upward from her eyes,</L>
<L>As if they had gain'd a victory o'er grief,</L>
<L>And with it many <HI>beams</HI> twisted themselves,</L>

<L>To and again from Heaven."<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Middleton,</HI> in an obscure Play, called, <HI>A Game at Chesse,</HI> hath some very pleasing lines on a similar occasion: <Q><L>"Upon those lips, the sweete fresh buds of youth,</L><L>The holy dew of prayer lies like pearle,</L><L>Dropt from the opening eye-lids of the morne</L><L>Upon the bashfull Rose."—</L></Q></NOTE>—</L></Q></P>

<Q><L>—— "The Swan <HI>with arched neck</HI></L>
<L>"Between her white wings mantling proudly, rows</L>
<L>"Her state with oary feet."—</L>
<BIBL>B. 7. V. 438, &amp;c.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>"The ancient Poets, says Mr. <HI>Richardson,</HI> have not hit upon this beauty; so lavish as they have been in their descriptions of the <HI>Swan. Homer</HI> calls the Swan <HI>long-necked,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; but how much more <HI>pittoresque,</HI> if he had <HI>arched</HI> this length of neck?"</P>
<P>For <HI>this beauty</HI> however, <HI>Milton</HI> was beholden to <HI>Donne</HI>; whose name, I believe, at present is better known than his writings:
<Q><L>—— "Like a Ship in her full trim,</L>
<L>A <HI>Swan,</HI> so white that you may unto him</L>
<L>Compare all whitenesse, but himselfe to none,</L>

<L>And with his <HI>arched neck</HI> this poore fish catch'd."—</L>
<BIBL><HI>Progresse of the Soul.</HI> St. 24.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Those highly finished Landscapes, the <HI>Seasons,</HI> are indeed copied from Nature: but <HI>Thomson</HI> sometimes recollected the hand of his Master:
<Q><L>——— "The stately sailing Swan</L>
<L>Gives out his snowy plumage to the gale;</L>
<L>And arching proud his Neck, with oary feet,</L>
<L>Bears forward fierce, and guards his osier Isle,</L>
<L>Protective of his young." —</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="38"/>But <HI>to return,</HI> as we say on other occasions. — Per∣haps the Advocates for <HI>Shakespeare's</HI> knowledge of the <HI>Latin</HI> language may be more successful. Mr. <HI>Gil∣don</HI> takes the Van. "It is plain, that He was ac∣quainted with the <HI>Fables</HI> of antiquity very well: that some of the Arrows of <HI>Cupid</HI> are pointed with Lead, and others with Gold, he found in <HI>Ovid</HI>; and what he speaks of <HI>Dido,</HI> in <HI>Virgil:</HI> nor do I know any translation of these Poets so ancient as <HI>Shakespeare's</HI> time." The passages on which these sagacious remarks are made, occur in the <HI>Midsummer Night's Dream</HI>; and exhibit, we see, a clear proof of acquaintance with the <HI>Latin</HI> Classicks. But we are not answerable for Mr. <HI>Gildon's</HI> ignorance; he might have been told of <HI>Caxton</HI> and <HI>Douglas,</HI> of <HI>Surrey</HI> and <HI>Stanyhurst,</HI> of <HI>Phaer</HI> and <HI>Twyne,</HI> of <HI>Fleming</HI> and <HI>Gol∣ding,</HI> of <HI>Turberville</HI> and <HI>Churchyard!</HI> but these <HI>Fables</HI> were easily known without the help of either the ori∣ginals or the translations. The Fate of <HI>Dido</HI> had been sung very early by <HI>Gower, Chaucer,</HI> and <HI>Lydgate; Marloe</HI> had even already introduced her to the Stage: and <HI>Cupid's</HI> arrows appear with their characteristick differences in <HI>Surrey,</HI> in <HI>Sidney,</HI> in <HI>Spenser,</HI> and every Sonetteer of the time. Nay, their very names were exhibited long before in the <HI>Romaunt of the Rose:</HI> a work, you may venture to look into, notwithstand∣ing Master <HI>Prynne</HI> hath so positively assured us, on
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>

<P>Mr. <HI>Whalley</HI> argues in the same manner, and with the same success. He thinks a passage in the <HI>Tempest,</HI>
<Q><L>——— "High Queen of State,</L>
<L>Great <HI>Juno</HI> comes; I know her by her <HI>Gait."</HI></L></Q>
a remarkable instance of <HI>Shakespeare's</HI> knowledge of ancient Poetick story; and that the hint was furnish∣ed by the <HI>Divûm incedo Regina</HI> of <HI>Virgil.</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Others would give up this passage for the <HI>Vera incessu patuit Dea</HI>; but I am not able to see any improvement in the matter: even supposing the Poet had been speak∣ing of <HI>Juno,</HI> and no previous Translation were extant.</NOTE></P>

<P>In the <HI>Merchant of Venice,</HI> we have an oath "By <HI>two-headed Janus</HI>;" and here, says Dr. <HI>Warburton, Shakespeare</HI> shews his knowledge in the Antique: and
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
so again does the <HI>Water-poet,</HI> who describes <HI>Fortune,</HI>
<Q>"Like a <HI>Janus</HI> with a <HI>double-face."</HI></Q></P>
<P>But <HI>Shakespeare</HI> hath somewhere at <HI>Latin Motto,</HI> quoth Dr. <HI>Sewel;</HI> and so hath <HI>John Taylor,</HI> and a whole Poem upon it into the bargain.</P>
<P>You perceive, my dear Sir, how vague and inde∣terminate such arguments must be: for in fact this <HI>sweet Swan of Thames,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> calls him, hath more scraps of <HI>Latin,</HI> and allusions to antiquity than are any where to be met with in the writings of <HI>Shakespeare.</HI> I am sorry to trouble you with trifles, yet what must be done, when grave men insist upon them?</P>
<P>It should seem to be the opinion of some modern criticks, that the personages of classick land began only to be known in <HI>England</HI> in the time of <HI>Shakespeare</HI>; or rather, that he particularly had the honour of in∣troducing them to the notice of his countrymen.</P>
<P>For instance, — <HI>Rumour painted full of tongues,</HI> gives us a Prologue to one of the parts of <HI>Henry the Fourth</HI>; and, says Dr. <HI>Dodd, Shakespeare</HI> had doubtless a view to either <HI>Virgil</HI> or <HI>Ovid</HI> in their description of <HI>Fame.</HI></P>
<P>But why so? <HI>Stephen Hawes</HI> in his <HI>Pastime of Plea∣sure</HI> had long before exhibited her in the same manner,
<Q><L>"A goodly Lady envyroned about</L>

<Q><L><HI>"Fame</HI> I am called, mervayle you nothing</L>
<L>Though with <HI>tonges</HI> I am compassed all rounde."</L></Q>
not to mention her elaborate Portrait by <HI>Chaucer,</HI> in the <HI>Boke of Fame</HI>; and by <HI>John Higgins,</HI> one of the Assistants in the <HI>Mirour for Magistrates,</HI> in his Legend of King <HI>Albanacte.</HI></P>
<P>A very liberal Writer on the <HI>Beauties of Poetry,</HI> who hath been more conversant in the ancient Lite∣rature of other Countries, than his own, "cannot but wonder, that a Poet, whose classical Images are composed of the finest parts, and breath the very spirit of ancient Mythology, should pass for being illiterate:"
<Q><L>"See what a grace was seated on his brow!</L>
<L><HI>Hyperion's</HI> curls: the front of <HI>Jove</HI> himself:</L>
<L>An eye like <HI>Mars</HI> to threaten and command:</L>
<L>A station like the herald <HI>Mercury,</HI></L>
<L>New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill."</L>
<BIBL><HI>Hamlet.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<HI>Illiterate</HI> is an ambiguous term: the question is, whether Poetick History could be only known by an Adept in <HI>Languages.</HI> It is no reflection on this inge∣nious Gentleman, when I say, that I use on this oc∣casion the words of a <HI>better</HI> Critick, who yet was not willing to carry the <HI>illiteracy</HI> of our Poet <HI>too far:</HI>—
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
"They who are in such astonishment at the <HI>learning</HI> of <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> forget that the Pagan Imagery was familiar to all the Poets of his time; and that abun∣dance of this sort of learning was to be picked up from almost every <HI>English</HI> book, that he could take into his hands." For not to insist upon <HI>Stephen Bate∣man's</HI> Golden booke of the leaden Goddes, 1577, and several other laborious compilations on the sub∣ject, all this and much more Mythology might as perfectly have been learned from the <HI>Testament of Creseide,</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Printed amongst the Works of <HI>Chaucer,</HI> but really written by <HI>Robert Henderson.</HI></NOTE> and the <HI>Fairy Queen,</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">It is observable, that <HI>Hyperion</HI> is used by <HI>Spenser</HI> with the same error in <HI>quantity.</HI></NOTE> as from a regular <HI>Pantheon</HI> or <HI>Polymetis</HI> himself.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Upton,</HI> not contented with <HI>Heathen</HI> learning, when he finds it in the text, must necessarily super-add it, when it appears to be wanting; because <HI>Shake∣speare</HI> most certainly hath lost it by accident!</P>
<P>In <HI>Much ado about Nothing,</HI> Don <HI>Pedro</HI> says of the insensible <HI>Benedict,</HI> "He hath twice or thrice cut <HI>Cupid's</HI> bow-string, and the little <HI>Hangman</HI> dare not shoot at him."</P>
<P>This mythology is not recollected in the Ancients, and therefore the critick hath no doubt but his Au∣thor wrote <HI>"Henchman,—a Page, Pusio:</HI> and <HI>this</HI> word seeming too hard for the Printer, he translated the
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>
little Urchin into a <HI>Hangman,</HI> a character no way belonging to him."</P>
<P>But this character was not borrowed from the Ancients; — it came from the <HI>Arcadia</HI> of Sir <HI>Philip Sidney:</HI>
<Q><L>"Millions of yeares this old drivell <HI>Cupid</HI> lives;</L>
<L>While still more wretch, more wicked he doth prove:</L>
<L>Till now at length that <HI>Jove</HI> him office gives,</L>
<L>(At <HI>Juno's</HI> suite who much did <HI>Argus</HI> love)</L>
<L>In this our world a <HI>Hangman</HI> for to be</L>
<L>Of all those fooles that will have all they see."</L>
<BIBL>B. 2. Ch. 14.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I know it may be objected on the authority of such Biographers, as <HI>Theophilus Cibber,</HI> and the Writer of the Life of Sir <HI>Philip,</HI> prefixed to the modern Editions; that the <HI>Arcadia</HI> was not published before 1613, and consequently too late for this imitation: but I have a Copy in my own possession, printed for <HI>W. Ponsonbie,</HI> 1590, 4to. which hath escaped the notice of the industrious <HI>Ames,</HI> and the rest of our typographical Antiquaries.</P>
<P>Thus likewise every word of antiquity is to be cut down to the classical standard.</P>
<P>In a Note on the Prologue to <HI>Troilus</HI> and <HI>Cressida,</HI> (which, by the way, is not met with in the <HI>Quarto</HI>) Mr. <HI>Theobald</HI> informs us, that the very <HI>names</HI> of the gates of <HI>Troy,</HI> have been barbarously demolished by the Editors: and a deal of learned dust he makes in

<Q><L><HI>"Dardan,</HI> and <HI>Thymbria, Ilia, Scaea, Troian,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Antenorides."</HI></L></Q>
But had he looked into the <HI>Troye boke</HI> of <HI>Lydgate,</HI> instead of puzzling himself with <HI>Dares Phrygius,</HI> he would have found the horrid demolition to have been neither the work of <HI>Shakespeare</HI> nor his Editors.</P>

says this true Critick, owed the felicity of freedom from the bondage of classical superstition, to the <HI>want</HI> of what is called the <HI>advantage</HI> of a learned Educa∣tion.—This, as well as a vast superiority of Genius hath contributed to lift this astonishing man to the glory of being esteemed the most original <HI>thinker</HI> and <HI>speaker,</HI> since the times of <HI>Homer."</HI> And hence in∣disputably the amazing Variety of Style and Manner, unknown to all other Writers: an argument of <HI>itself</HI> sufficient to emancipate <HI>Shakespeare</HI> from the suppo∣sition of a <HI>Classical training.</HI> Yet, to be honest, <HI>one</HI> Imitation is <HI>fastened</HI> on our Poet: which hath been insisted upon likewise by Mr. <HI>Upton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Whalley.</HI> You remember it in the famous Speech of <HI>Claudio</HI> in <HI>Measure for Measure:</HI>
<Q>"Ay, but to die and go we know not where! &amp;c."</Q></P>
<P>Most certainly the Ideas of a "Spirit bathing in fiery floods," of residing "in thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice," or of being "imprisoned in the viewless winds," are not <HI>original</HI> in our Author; but I am not sure, that they came from the <HI>Platonick Hell</HI> of <HI>Virgil.</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>——"Aliae panduntur inanes</L><L>Suspensae ad ventos: aliis sub gurgite vasto</L><L>Infectum eluitur scelus, aut exuritur igni."</L></Q></NOTE> The Monks also had their hot and their cold Hell, "the fyrste is fyre that ever brenneth,

<P>Another tells us of the Soul of a Monk fastened to a Rock, which the winds were to blow about for a twelvemonth, and purge of it's Enormities.

<P>After all, <HI>Shakespeare's</HI> curiosity might lead him to <HI>Translations. Gawin Douglas</HI> really changes the <HI>Pla∣tonick Hell</HI> into the "punytion of Saulis in Purgatory:" and it is observable, that when the <HI>Ghost</HI> informs <HI>Hamlet</HI> of his Doom there,
<Q><L>"Till the foul crimes done in his days of nature</L>

the Expression is very similar to the Bishop's: I will give you his Version as concisely as I can; "It is a nedeful thyng to suffer panis and torment— Sum in the wyndis, Sum under the watter, and in the fire uthir Sum: — thus the mony Vices—

Let us turn to a <HI>real Translator,</HI> and examine whether the Idea might not be fully comprehended by an <HI>English</HI> reader; <HI>supposing</HI> it necessarily borrowed from <HI>Virgil. Hex∣ameters</HI> in our own language are almost forgotten; we will quote therefore this time from <HI>Stanyhurst:</HI>
<Q><L>"O to thee, fayre Virgin, what terme may rightly be fitted?</L>
<L>Thy tongue, thy visage no mortal frayltie resembleth.</L>
<L>—No doubt, a Godesse!"</L>

<P><HI>Gabriel Harvey</HI> desired only to be <HI>"Epitaph'd,</HI> the Inventor of the <HI>English Hexameter,"</HI> and for a while every one would be <HI>halting on Roman feet</HI>; but the ridicule of our Fellow- Collegian <HI>Hall,</HI> in one of his <HI>Satires,</HI> and the reasoning of <HI>Daniel,</HI> in his <HI>Defence of Rhyme</HI> against <HI>Campion,</HI> presently reduced us to our original <HI>Gothic.</HI></P>
<P>But to come nearer the purpose, what will you say, if I can shew you, that <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> when, in the favourite phrase, he had a <HI>Latin</HI> Poet <HI>in his Eye,</HI> most assuredly made use of a Translation.</P>
<P><HI>Prospero</HI> in the <HI>Tempest</HI> begins the Address to his attendant <HI>Spirits,</HI>
<Q>"Ye Elves of Hills, of standing Lakes, and Groves."</Q></P>
<P>This speech, Dr. <HI>Warburton</HI> rightly observes to be borrowed from <HI>Medea</HI> in <HI>Ovid:</HI> and "it proves, says
<PB N="45" REF="51"/>
Mr. <HI>Holt,</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">In some Remarks on the <HI>Tempest,</HI> published under the quaint Title of "An attempte to rescue that aun∣ciente English Poet and Play-wrighte, Maister <HI>Williaume Shakespeare,</HI> from the many Errours, faulsely charged upon him by certaine new-fangled Wittes." <HI>Lond.</HI> 8vo. 1749. p. 81.</NOTE> beyond contradiction, that <HI>Shakespeare</HI> was perfectly acquainted with the Sentiments of the Ancients on the Subject of Inchantments." The original lines are these.
<Q><L>"Auraeque, &amp; venti, montesque, amnesque, lacusque,</L>
<L>Diique omnes nemorum, diique omnes noctis adeste."</L></Q>
It happens however, that the translation by <HI>Arthur Golding</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">His work is dedicated to the Earl of <HI>Leicester</HI> in a long Epistle in verse, from <HI>Berwicke,</HI> Apr. 20. 1567.</NOTE> is by no means literal, and <HI>Shakespeare</HI> hath closely followed it;
<Q><L>"Ye Ayres and Winds; <HI>Ye Elves of Hills,</HI> of Brookes, of Woods alone,</L>
<L><HI>Of standing Lakes,</HI> and of the Night approche ye everych one."</L></Q></P>
<P>I think it is unnecessary to pursue this any fur∣ther; especially as more powerful arguments await us.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Merchant of Venice,</HI> the <HI>Jew,</HI> as an apology for his cruelty to <HI>Anthonio,</HI> rehearses many <HI>Sympa∣thies</HI> and <HI>Antipathies</HI> for which <HI>no reason can be ren∣dered,</HI>
<Q><L>"Some love not a gaping Pig —</L>
<L>And others when a <HI>Bagpipe</HI> sings i'th' nose</L>
<L>Cannot contain their urine for <HI>affection."</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="52"/>This incident, Dr. <HI>Warburton</HI> supposes to be taken from a passage in <HI>Scaliger's Exercitations</HI> against <HI>Car∣dan,</HI> "Narrabo tibi jocosam Sympathiam <HI>Reguli, Vasconis</HI> Equitis: Is dum viveret audito <HI>Phormingis</HI> sono, urinam illico facere cogebatur." And, proceeds the <HI>Doctor,</HI> to make this jocular story still more ridi∣culous, <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> I suppose, translated <HI>Phorminx</HI> by <HI>Bagpipes.</HI></P>
<P>Here we seem fairly caught; — for <HI>Scaliger's</HI> work was never, as the term goes, <HI>done into English.</HI> But luckily in an old translation from the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Peter Le Loier,</HI> entitled, <HI>A treatise of Specters, or straunge Sights, Visions and Apparitions appearing sensibly unto men,</HI> we have this identical Story from <HI>Scaliger:</HI> and what is still more, a marginal Note gives us in all probability the very fact alluded to, as well as the word of <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> "Another Gentleman of this quality liued of late in Deuon neere Excester, who could not endure the playing on a <HI>Bagpipe."</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">M. <HI>Bayle</HI> hath delineated the singular character of our <HI>fantastical</HI> Author. His work was originally translated by one <HI>Zacharie Jones.</HI> My Edit. is in 4to. 1605. with an anonymous Dedication to the King: the <HI>Devonshire</HI> Story was therefore well known in the time of <HI>Shakespeare.</HI>—— The passage from <HI>Scaliger</HI> is likewise to be met with in <HI>The Optick Glasse of Humors,</HI> written, I believe, by <HI>T. Womb∣well</HI>; and in several other places.</NOTE></P>
<P>We may just add, as some observation hath been made upon it, that <HI>Affection</HI> in the sense of <HI>Sympathy</HI> was
<PB N="47" REF="53"/>
formerly <HI>technical</HI>; and so used by Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> Sir <HI>Kenelm Digby,</HI> and many other Writers.</P>
<P>A single word in Queen <HI>Catherine's</HI> Character of <HI>Wolsey,</HI> in <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, is brought by the <HI>Doctor</HI> as another argument for the learning of <HI>Shakespeare.</HI></P>
<Q><L>——— "He was a man</L>
<L>Of an unbounded Stomach, ever ranking</L>
<L>Himself with Princes; one that by <HI>Suggestion</HI></L>
<L>Ty'd all the kingdom. Simony was fair play.</L>
<L>His own opinion was his law, i'th' presence</L>
<L>He would say untruths, and be ever double</L>
<L>Both in his words and meaning. He was never</L>
<L>But where he meant to ruin, pitiful.</L>
<L>His promises were, as he then was, mighty;</L>
<L>But his performance, as he now is, nothing.</L>
<L>Of his own body he was ill, and gave</L>
<L>The Clergy ill example."</L></Q>
<P>The word <HI>Suggestion,</HI> says the Critick, is here used with great propriety, and <HI>seeming</HI> knowledge of the Latin tongue: and he proceeds to settle the sense of it from <HI>the late Roman writers and their glossers.</HI> But <HI>Shakespeare's</HI> knowledge was from <HI>Holingshed,</HI> whom he follows <HI>verbatim:</HI></P>
<P>"This Cardinal was of a great stomach, for he compted himself equal with princes, and by craftie <HI>Suggestion</HI> got into his hands innumerable treasure: he forced little on simonie, and was not pitifull, and
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>
stood affectionate in his own opinion: in open pre∣sence he would lie and seie untruth, and was double both in speech and meaning: he would promise much and performe little: he was vicious of his bodie, and gaue the clergie euil example." Edit. 1587. p. 922.</P>
<P>Perhaps after this quotation, you may not think, that Sir <HI>Thomas Hanmer,</HI> who reads <HI>Tyth'd</HI> — in∣stead of <HI>Ty'd all the kingdom,</HI> deserves quite so much of Dr. <HI>Warburton's</HI> severity. — Indisput∣ably the passage, like every other in the Speech, is intended to express the meaning of the parallel one in the Chronicle: it cannot therefore be credit∣ed, that any man, when the <HI>Original</HI> was produced, should still chuse to defend a <HI>cant</HI> acceptation; and inform us, perhaps, <HI>seriously,</HI> that in <HI>gaming</HI> language, from I know not what practice, to <HI>tye</HI> is to <HI>equal!</HI> A sense of the word, as far as I have yet found, <HI>unknown</HI> to our old Writers; and, if <HI>known,</HI> would not sure∣ly have been used in <HI>this</HI> place by our Author.</P>
<P>But let us turn from conjecture to <HI>Shakespeare's</HI> authorities. <HI>Hall,</HI> from whom the above description is copied by <HI>Holingshed,</HI> is very explicit in the de∣mands of the <HI>Cardinal:</HI> who having insolently told the <HI>Lord Mayor</HI> and <HI>Aldermen,</HI> "For sothe I thinke, that <HI>halfe</HI> your substaunce were to litle," assures them by way of comfort at the end of his harangue, that
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>
<HI>upon an average</HI> the <HI>tythe</HI> should be sufficient; "Sers, speake not to breake that thyng that is concluded, for <HI>some</HI> shal not paie the <HI>tenth</HI> parte, and <HI>some</HI> more." — And again; "Thei saied, the Cardinall by Visi∣tacions, makyng of Abbottes, probates of testamentes, graunting of faculties, licences, and other pollyngs in his Courtes legantines, had made his <HI>threasore egall with the kynges."</HI> Edit. 1548. p. 138. and 143.</P>
<P><HI>Skelton,</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><P>His Poems are printed with the title of "Pithy, Pleasaunt, and Profitable Workes of Maister <HI>Skelton, Poete Laureate."</HI> — But, says Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> after several other Writers, "how or by what Interest he was made <HI>Laureat,</HI> or whether it was a title he assumed to himself, cannot be determined." — This is an error pretty generally received, and it may be worth our while to remove it.</P><P>A facetious Author says somewhere, that a <HI>Poet Lau∣reat,</HI> in the modern Idea, is a Gentleman, who hath an annual Stipend for reminding us of the <HI>Neva Year,</HI> and the <HI>Birth-day:</HI> but formerly a <HI>Poet Laureat</HI> was a real <HI>University Graduate.</HI> <Q><L><HI>"Skelton</HI> wore the Lawrell wreath</L><L>And past in <HI>schoels</HI> ye knoe."</L></Q> says <HI>Churchyarde</HI> in the Poem prefixed to his Works. And Master <HI>Caxton</HI> in his Preface to <HI>The boke of Eneydos,</HI> 1490. hath a passage, which well deserves to be quoted with∣out abridgment: "I praye mayster <HI>John Skelton, late created poete laureate in the unyversite of Oxenforde,</HI> to over∣see and correcte thys sayd booke, and taddresse and ex∣powne whereas shall be founde faulte, to theym that shall requyre it; for hym I knowe for suffycyent to ex∣powne and Englysshe every dyfficulte that is therein; for he hath late translated the epystles of <HI>Tulle,</HI> and the book of <HI>Dyodorus Syculus,</HI> and diverse other workes, out of <HI>Latyn</HI> into <HI>Englisshe,</HI> not in rude and old langage, but in polyshed and ornate termes, craftely, as he that hath redde <HI>Vyrgyle, Ouyde, Tullye,</HI> and all the other noble poets and oratours, to me unknowen: and also he hath redde the IX muses, and understands their musicalle scyences, and to whom of them eche scyence is appropred: I sup∣pose he hath dronken of <HI>Elycons</HI> well!"</P><P>I find, from Mr. <HI>Baker's</HI> MSS. that our <HI>Laureat</HI> was admitted <HI>ad eundem</HI> at <HI>Cambridge:</HI> "An.

<P>Mr. <HI>Upton</HI> and some other Criticks have thought it very <HI>scholar-like</HI> in <HI>Hamlet</HI> to swear the Centinels on a <HI>Sword:</HI> but this is for ever met with. For instance, in the <HI>Passus primus</HI> of <HI>Pierce Plowman,</HI>
<Q><L><HI>"Dauid</HI> in his daies dubbed knightes,</L>
<L>And did hem <HI>swere on her sword</HI> to serue truth euer."</L></Q>
And in <HI>Hieronymo,</HI> the common Butt of our Author, and the Wits of the time, says <HI>Lorenzo</HI> to <HI>Pedringano,</HI>
<Q><L>"Swear on this cross, that what thou sayst is true—</L>
<L>But if I prove thee perjured and unjust,</L>
<L>This very <HI>sword,</HI> whereon thou took'st thine oath</L>
<L>Shall be the worker of thy Tragedy!"</L></Q>
We have therefore no occasion to go with Mr. <HI>Gar∣rick</HI> as far as the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Brantôme</HI> to illustrate this
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
ceremony:<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Johnson's</HI> Edit. V. 8. p. 171.</NOTE> a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> who will be always allow∣ed the <HI>first Commentator</HI> on <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> when he does not carry us beyond <HI>himself.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Upton</HI> however, in the next place, produces a pas∣sage from <HI>Henry the sixth,</HI> whence he argues it to be very plain, that our Author had not only <HI>read Cicero's Offices,</HI> but even more <HI>critically</HI> than many of the Editors:
<Q><L>— "This Villain here</L>
<L>Being Captain of a <HI>Pinnace,</HI> threatens more</L>
<L>Than <HI>Bargulus,</HI> the strong <HI>Illyrian</HI> Pirate."</L></Q>
So the <HI>Wight,</HI> he observes with great exultation, is named by <HI>Cicero</HI> in the Editions of <HI>Shakespeare's</HI> time, "<HI>Bargulus, Illyrius</HI> latro;" tho' the mo∣dern Editors have chosen to call him <HI>Bardylis:</HI> — "and <HI>thus</HI> I found it in <HI>two</HI> MSS." — And <HI>thus</HI> he might have found it in <HI>two</HI> Translations, before <HI>Shake∣speare</HI> was born. <HI>Robert Whytinton,</HI> 1533, calls him, <HI>"Bargulus,</HI> a Pirate upon the see of <HI>Illiry</HI>;" and <HI>Nicholas Grimald,</HI> about twenty years afterward, <HI>"Bargulus,</HI> the <HI>Illyrian</HI> Robber."<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">I have met with a Writer who tells us, that a Trans∣lation of the <HI>Offices</HI> was printed by <HI>Caxton,</HI> in the year 1481: but such a book never existed. It is a mistake for <HI>"Tullius of olde age,"</HI> by <HI>John Tiptoft,</HI> Earl of <HI>Worcester.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>But it had been easy to have checked Mr. <HI>Upton's</HI> exultation, by observing, that <HI>Bargulus</HI> does not ap∣pear in the <HI>Quarto.</HI>— Which also is the case with
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>
some fragments of <HI>Latin</HI> verses, in the different <HI>Parts</HI> of this <HI>doubtful</HI> performance.</P>
<P>It is scarcely worth mentioning, that two or three more <HI>Latin</HI> passages, which are met with in our Au∣thor, are immediately transcribed from the Story or Chronicle before him. Thus in <HI>Henry the fifth,</HI> whose right to the kingdom of <HI>France</HI> is copiously demonstrated by the <HI>Archbishop.</HI>
<Q><L>——— "There is no bar</L>
<L>To make against your Highness' claim to <HI>France,</HI></L>
<L>But this which they produce from <HI>Pharamond:</HI></L>
<L>In terram <HI>Salicam</HI> mulieres nè succedant;</L>
<L>No Woman shall succeed in <HI>Salike</HI> land:</L>
<L>Which <HI>Salike</HI> land the <HI>French</HI> unjustly gloze</L>
<L>To be the realm of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Pharamond</HI></L>
<L>The founder of this law and female bar.</L>
<L>Yet their own authors faithfully affirm,</L>
<L>That the land <HI>Salike</HI> lies in <HI>Germany,</HI></L>
<L>Between the floods of <HI>Sala</HI> and of <HI>Elve,</HI> &amp;c."</L></Q>
Archbishop <HI>Chichelie,</HI> says <HI>Holingshed,</HI> "did much in∣ueie against the surmised and false fained law <HI>Salike,</HI> which the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> alledge euer against the kings of <HI>England</HI> in barre of their just title to the crowne of <HI>France.</HI> The very words of that supposed law are these, In terram <HI>Salicam</HI> mulieres nè succedant, that is to saie, Into the <HI>Salike</HI> land let not women succeed; which the <HI>French</HI> glossers expound to be the realm of <HI>France,</HI> and that this law was made by King <HI>Pharamond:</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>
whereas yet their owne authors affirme, that the land <HI>Salike</HI> is in <HI>Germanie,</HI> between the rivers of <HI>Elbe</HI> and <HI>Sala,</HI> &amp;c." p. 545.</P>
<P>It hath lately been repeated from Mr. <HI>Guthrie's</HI> "Essay upon <HI>English</HI> Tragedy," that the <HI>Portrait</HI> of <HI>Macbeth's Wife</HI> is copied from <HI>Buchanan,</HI> "whose spirit, as well as words, is translated into the Play of <HI>Shakespeare:</HI> and it had signified nothing to have pored only on <HI>Holingshed</HI> for <HI>Facts."</HI> — "Animus etiam, per se ferox, prope quotidianis conviciis uxoris (quae omnium consiliorum ei erat conscia) stimula∣batur."— This is the whole, that <HI>Buchanan</HI> says of the <HI>Lady,</HI> and truly I see no more <HI>spirit</HI> in the <HI>Scotch,</HI> than in the <HI>English</HI> Chronicler. "The wordes of the three weird Sisters also greatly encouraged him [to the Murder of <HI>Duncan</HI>], but specially his wife lay sore upon him to attempt the thing, as she that was very ambitious, brenning in unquenchable de∣sire to beare the name of a Queene." Edit. 1577. p. 244.</P>
<P>This part of <HI>Holingshed</HI> is an Abridgment of <HI>Johne Bellenden's</HI> translation of the <HI>noble clerk, Hector Boece, imprinted</HI> at <HI>Edingburgh,</HI> in <HI>Fol.</HI> 1541. I will give the passage as it is found there. "His wyfe im∣pacient of lang tary (<HI>as all wemen ar</HI>) specially quhare they ar desirus of ony purpos, gaif hym gret artation to pursew the thrid weird, that sche micht be ane
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>
quene, calland hym oft tymis febyl cowart and nocht desyrus of honouris, sen he durst not assailze the thing with manheid and curage, quhilk is offerit to hym be beniuolence of fortoun. Howbeit sindry otheris hes assailzeit sic thinges afore with maist terribyl jeopardyis, quhen thay had not sic sickernes to suc∣ceid in the end of thair laubouris as he had." p. 173.</P>
<P>But we can <HI>demonstrate,</HI> that <HI>Shakespeare</HI> had not the Story from <HI>Buchanan.</HI> According to <HI>him,</HI> the Weïrd-Sisters salute <HI>Macbeth,</HI> "Una <HI>Angusiae</HI> Tha∣num, altera <HI>Moraviae,</HI> tertia <HI>Regem."</HI>—Thane of <HI>Angus,</HI> and of <HI>Murray, &amp;c.</HI> but according to <HI>Holing∣shed,</HI> immediately from <HI>Bellenden,</HI> as it stands in <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> "The first of them spake and sayde, All hayle <HI>Makbeth</HI> Thane of <HI>Glammis,</HI> — the second of them said, Hayle <HI>Makbeth</HI> Thane of <HI>Cawder</HI>; but the third sayde, All hayle <HI>Makbeth,</HI> that hereafter shall be <HI>king of Scotland."</HI> p. 243.
<Q><L>"1 <HI>Witch.</HI> All hail, <HI>Macbeth!</HI> Hail to thee, <HI>Thane</HI> of <HI>Glamis!</HI></L>
<L>2 <HI>Witch.</HI> All hail, <HI>Macbeth!</HI> Hail to thee, Thane of <HI>Cawdor!</HI></L>
<L>3 <HI>Witch.</HI> All hail, <HI>Macbeth!</HI> that shalt be <HI>King</HI> hereafter!"</L></Q>
Here too our Poet found the equivocal Predictions, on which his Hero so fatally depended. "He had learned of certain wysards, how that he ought to
<PB N="56" REF="62"/>
take heede of <HI>Macduffe</HI>;—and surely hereupon had he put <HI>Macduffe</HI> to death, but a certaine witch whom he had in great trust, had tolde, that he should neuer be slain with <HI>man borne of any woman,</HI> nor vanquished till the Wood of <HI>Bernane</HI> came to the Castell of <HI>Dun∣sinane."</HI> p. 244. And the Scene between <HI>Malcolm</HI> and <HI>Macduff</HI> in the fourth act is almost literally taken from the <HI>Chronicle.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Macheth</HI> was certainly one of <HI>Shakespeare's</HI> latest Productions, and it might possibly have been sug∣gested to him by a little performance on the same subject at <HI>Oxford,</HI> before King <HI>James,</HI> 1605. I will transcribe my notice of it from <HI>Wake's Rex Platonicus:</HI> "Fabulae ansam dedit antiqua de Regiâ prosapiâ historiola apud <HI>Scoto-Britannos</HI> celebrata, quae narrat tres olim Sibyllas occurrisse duobus <HI>Scotiae</HI> proceribus, <HI>Macbetho</HI> &amp; <HI>Banchoni,</HI> &amp; illum praedixisse Regem fu∣turum, sed Regem nullum geniturum; hunc Regem non futurum, sed Reges geniturum multos. Vatici∣nii veritatem rerum eventus comprobavit. <HI>Banchonis</HI> enim è stirpe Potentissimus <HI>Jacobus</HI> oriundus." p. 29.</P>
<P>A stronger argument hath been brought from the Plot of <HI>Hamlet.</HI> Dr. <HI>Grey</HI> and Mr. <HI>Whalley</HI> assure us, that for <HI>this, Shakespeare must</HI> have read <HI>Saxo Gram∣maticus</HI> in <HI>Latin,</HI> for no translation hath been made into any modern Language. But the truth is, he did not take it from <HI>Saxo</HI> at all; a Novel called the
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>
<HI>Hystorie of Hamblet</HI> was his original: a fragment of which, in <HI>black Letter,</HI> I have been favoured with by a very curious and intelligent Gentleman, to whom the lovers of <HI>Shakespeare</HI> will some time or other owe great obligations.</P>
<P>It hath indeed been said, that "IF <HI>such an history ex∣ists,</HI> it is almost impossible that any poet unacquainted with the <HI>Latin</HI> language (supposing his perceptive faculties to have been ever so acute) could have caught the characteristical madness of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> described by <HI>Saxo Grammaticus,</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">"Falsitatis enim (<HI>Hamlethus</HI>) alienus haberi cupidus, ita astutiam veriloquio permiscebat, ut nec dictis veraci∣tas deesset, nec acuminis modus verorum judicio prode∣retur." This is quoted, as it had been before, in Mr. <HI>Guthrie's</HI> Essay on Tragedy, with a <HI>small</HI> variation from the <HI>Original.</HI> See Edit. <HI>Fol.</HI> 1644. p. 50.</NOTE> so happily as it is delineated by <HI>Shakespeare."</HI></P>
<P>Very luckily, our Fragment gives us a part of <HI>Hamlet's</HI> Speech to his <HI>Mother,</HI> which sufficiently re∣plies to this observation. —"It was not without cause, and juste occasion, that my gestures, countenances and words seeme to proceed from a madman, and that I desire to haue all men esteeme mee wholy de∣priued of sence and reasonable understanding, bycause I am well assured, that he that hath made no con∣science to kill his owne brother, (accustomed to mur∣thers, and allured with desire of gouernement with∣out
<PB N="58" REF="64"/>

<P>Mr. <HI>Colman,</HI> in the Preface to his elegant Transla∣tion of <HI>Terence,</HI> hath offered some arguments for the Learning of <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> which have been retailed with much confidence, since the appearance of Mr. <HI>Johnson's</HI> Edition.</P>
<P>"Besides the resemblance of particular passages scattered up and down in different plays, it is well known, that the <HI>Comedy of Errors</HI> is in great measure founded on the <HI>Menaechmi</HI> of <HI>Plautus</HI>; but I do not recollect ever to have seen it observed, that the dis∣guise of the <HI>Pedant</HI> in the <HI>Taming of the Shrew,</HI> and his assuming the name and character of <HI>Vincentio,</HI> seem to be evidently taken from the disguise of the <HI>Sycophanta</HI> in the <HI>Trinummus</HI> of the said Author;<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">This observation of Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> is quoted by his very ingenious Colleague, Mr. <HI>Thornton,</HI> in his Translation of this Play: who further remarks, in another part of it, that a passage in <HI>Romeo and Juliet,</HI> where <HI>Shakespeare</HI> speaks of the <HI>contradiction</HI> in the nature of <HI>Love,</HI> is very much in the manner of his Author: <Q><L>"Amor — mores hominum moros &amp; morosos efficit.</L><L>Minus placet quod suadetur, quod disuadetur placet.</L><L>Quom inopia'st, cupias, quando ejus copia'st, tum non velis. &amp;c."</L></Q> Which he translates with ease and elegance, <Q><L>—— "Love makes a man a fool,</L><L>Hard to be pleas'd. — What you'd persuade him to,</L><L>He likes not, and embraces that, from which</L><L>You would dissuade him. — What there is a lack of,</L><L>That will he covet; — when 'tis in his power,</L><L>He'll none on't."—</L><BIBL><HI>Act</HI> 3. <HI>Scene</HI> 3.</BIBL></Q> Let us now turn to the passage in <HI>Shakespeare:</HI> <Q><L>—"O brawling Love!

Every <HI>Sonetteer</HI> cha∣racterises <HI>Love</HI> by contrarieties. <HI>Watson</HI> begins one of his <HI>Canzonets,</HI> <Q><L>"Love is a sowre delight, a sugred griefe</L><L>A living death, an euer-dying life, &amp;c."</L></Q> <HI>Turberville</HI> makes <HI>Reason</HI> harangue against it in the same manner, <Q><L>"A fierie Frost, a Flame that frozen is with Ise!</L><L>A heavie Burden light to beare! a Vertue fraught with Vice! &amp;c."</L></Q> Immediately from the <HI>Romaunt of the Rose,</HI> <Q><L>"Loue it is an hatefull pees</L><L>A free acquitaunce without reles —</L><L><HI>An heavie burthen light to beare</HI></L><L>A wicked wawe awaie to weare:</L><L>And health full of maladie</L><L>And charitie full of envie —</L><L>A laughter that is weping aie</L><L>Rest that trauaileth night and daie, &amp;c."</L></Q> This kind of <HI>Antithesis</HI> was very much the taste of the <HI>Provençal</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Poets; perhaps it might be hinted by the Ode of <HI>Sappho</HI> preserved by <HI>Longinus: Petrarch</HI> is full of it, <Q><L>"Pace non trovo, &amp; non hó da far guerra,</L><L>Et temo, &amp; spero, &amp; ardo, &amp; son un ghiaccio,</L><L>Et volo sopra'l cielo, &amp; ghiaccio in terra,</L><L>Et nulla stringo, &amp; tuttol mondo abbraccio. &amp;c."</L><BIBL><HI>Sonetto</HI> 105.</BIBL></Q> Sir <HI>Thomas Wyat</HI> gives a translation of this Sonnet, with∣out any notice of the <HI>Original,</HI> under the title of "De∣scription of the contrarious passions in a Louer."

<P>With respect to <HI>resemblances,</HI> I shall not trouble you any further.—That the <HI>Comedy of Errors</HI> is founded on the <HI>Menaechmi,</HI> it is notorious: nor is it less so, that a Translation of it by W.

The Printer of <HI>Lang∣baine,</HI> p. 524. hath accidently given the date, 1515, which hath been copied implicitly by <HI>Gildon, Theobald, Cooke,</HI> and several others. <HI>Warner</HI> is now almost forgot∣ten, yet the old Criticks esteemed him one of "our chiefe heroical <HI>Makers."—Meres</HI> informs us, that he had "heard him termed of the best wits of both our Universities, our <HI>English Homer."</HI></NOTE> tho' Mr. <HI>Upton,</HI>

and some other advocates for his learning, have cau∣tiously dropt the mention of it. Besides this, (if in∣deed it were different) in the <HI>Gesta Grayorum,</HI> the Christmas Revels of the <HI>Gray's-Inn</HI> Gentlemen, 1594, "a <HI>Comedy of Errors</HI> like to <HI>Plautus</HI> his <HI>Menechmus</HI> was played by the Players." And the same hath been suspected to be the Subject of the <HI>goodlie Comedie of Plautus</HI> acted at <HI>Greenwich</HI> before the King and Queen in 1520; as we learn from <HI>Hall</HI> and <HI>Holingshed: — Riccoboni</HI> highly compliments the <HI>English</HI> on opening their stage so well; but unfortunately, <HI>Cavendish</HI> in his Life of <HI>Wolsey,</HI> calls it, an <HI>excellent Interlude in Latine.</HI> About the same time it was exhibited in <HI>Ger∣man</HI> at <HI>Nuremburgh,</HI> by the celebrated <HI>Hanssach</HI> the <HI>Shoemaker.</HI></P>
<P>"But a character in the <HI>Taming of the Shrew</HI> is borrowed from the <HI>Trinummus,</HI> and no translation of <HI>that</HI> was extant."</P>

would not have appealed to <HI>Plautus.</HI> Thence <HI>Shakespeare</HI> borrowed this part of the Plot, (as well as some of the phraseology) though <HI>Theobald</HI> pronounces it his own invention: there likewise he found the quaint name of <HI>Petruchio.</HI> My young Master and his Man exchange habits and characters, and persuade a <HI>Scenaese,</HI> as he is called, to personate the <HI>Father,</HI> ex∣actly as in the <HI>Taming of the Shrew,</HI> by the pretend∣ed danger of his coming from <HI>Sienna</HI> to <HI>Ferrara,</HI> con∣trary to the order of the government.</P>
<P>Still, <HI>Shakespeare</HI> quotes a line from the <HI>Eunuch</HI> of <HI>Terence:</HI> by memory too, and what is more, "pur∣posely alters it, in order to bring the sense within the compass of one line."—This remark was pre∣vious to Mr. <HI>Johnsons</HI>; or indisputably it would not have been made at all. — "Our Author had this line from <HI>Lilly</HI>; which I mention that it may not be brought as an argument of his learning."</P>

and not from <HI>Terence?</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>W.

<P>We have hitherto supposed <HI>Shakespeare</HI> the Author of the <HI>Taming of the Shrew,</HI> but his property in it is extremely disputable. I will give you my opinion, and the reasons on which it is founded. I suppose then the present Play not <HI>originally</HI> the work of <HI>Shake∣speare,</HI> but restored by him to the Stage, with the whole <HI>Induction</HI> of the <HI>Tinker,</HI> and some other occa∣sional improvements; especially in the Character of <HI>Petruchio.</HI> It is very obvious, that the <HI>Induction</HI> and the <HI>Play</HI> were either the works of different hands, or written at a great interval of time: the former is in our Author's <HI>best</HI> manner, and the greater part of the <HI>latter</HI> in his <HI>worst,</HI> or even below it. Dr. <HI>Warburton</HI> declares it to be <HI>certainly</HI> spurious: and without doubt, <HI>supposing</HI> it to have been written by <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> it must have been one of his <HI>earliest</HI> productions; yet it is not mentioned in the List of his Works by <HI>Meres</HI> in 1598.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="73"/>I have met with a facetious piece of Sir <HI>John Har∣rington,</HI> printed in 1596, (and possibly there may be an earlier Edition) called, <HI>The Metamorphosis of Ajax,</HI> where I suspect an allusion to the old Play; "Read the <HI>booke</HI> of <HI>Taming a Shrew,</HI> which hath made a number of us so perfect, that <HI>now</HI> every one can rule a Shrew in our Countrey, save he that hath hir." —I am aware, a <HI>modern</HI> Linguist may object, that the word <HI>Book</HI> does not at present seem <HI>dramatick,</HI> but it was once almost <HI>technically</HI> so: <HI>Gosson</HI> in his Schoole of Abuse, contayning a pleasaunt inuective against <HI>Poets, Pipers, Players, Jesters,</HI> and such like <HI>Cater∣pillars</HI> of a Common-wealth, 1579, mentions "twoo prose <HI>Bookes</HI> plaied at the <HI>Belsauage</HI>;" and <HI>Hearne</HI> tells us in a Note at the end of <HI>William of Worcester,</HI> that he had seen a MS. in the nature of a <HI>Play</HI> or <HI>In∣terlude,</HI> intitled, the <HI>Booke</HI> of Sir <HI>Thomas Moore."</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">I know indeed, there is extant a very old Poem, in <HI>black Letter,</HI> to which it might have been supposed Sir <HI>John Harrington</HI> alluded, had he not spoken of the Dis∣covery as a <HI>new</HI> one, and recommended it as worthy the notice of his Countrymen: I am persuaded the method in the old Bard will not be thought <HI>either.</HI> At the end of the sixth Volume of <HI>Leland's Itinerary,</HI> we are <HI>favoured</HI> by Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> with a <HI>Macaronic</HI> Poem on a Battle at <HI>Ox∣ford</HI> between the Scholars and the Townsmen: on a line of which, <Q>"Invadunt aulas <HI>bycheson cum forth</HI> geminantes,"</Q> our Commentator very wisely and gravely remarks: <HI>"Bycheson,</HI> id est, <HI>Son</HI> of a <HI>Byche,</HI> ut è Codice <HI>Rawlinso∣niano</HI> edidi.

<P><PB N="68" REF="74"/>And in fact, there is such an old <HI>anonymous</HI> Play in Mr. <HI>Pope's</HI> List. "A pleasant conceited History, called, <HI>The Taming of a Shrew</HI>— sundry times acted by the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> his Servants." Which seems to have been republished by the Remains of that Com∣pany in 1607, when <HI>Shakespeare's</HI> copy appeared at the <HI>Black-Friars</HI> or the <HI>Globe.</HI> — Nor let this seem derogatory from the character of our Poet. There is no reason to believe, that he wanted to claim the Play as his own; it was not even printed 'till some

years after his death: but he merely revived it on his Stage as a <HI>Manager. — Ravenscroft</HI> assures us, that this was really the case with <HI>Titus Andronicus</HI>; which, it may be observed, hath not <HI>Shakespeare's</HI> name on the Title-page of the only Edition publish∣ed in his life-time. Indeed, from every internal mark, I have not the least doubt but this <HI>horrible</HI> Piece was originally written by the Author of the <HI>Lines</HI> thrown into the mouth of the <HI>Player</HI> in <HI>Hamlet,</HI> and of the <HI>Tragedy of Locrine:</HI> which likewise from some assist∣ance perhaps given to his Friend, hath been unjust∣ly and ignorantly charged upon <HI>Shakespeare.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>sheet-anchor</HI> holds fast: <HI>Shakespeare</HI> himself hath left some Translations from <HI>Ovid.</HI> The Epistles, says One, of <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Helen</HI> give a sufficient proof of his acquaintance with <HI>that</HI> poet; and it may be concluded, says Another, that he was a competent judge of <HI>other</HI> Authors, who wrote in the same lan∣guage.</P>
<P>This hath been the universal cry, from Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> himself to the Criticks of yesterday. Possibly, how∣ever, the Gentlemen will hesitate a moment, if we tell them, that <HI>Shakespeare</HI> was <HI>not</HI> the Author of these Translations. Let them turn to a forgotten book, by <HI>Thomas Heywood,</HI> called <HI>Britaines Troy,</HI> printed by <HI>W.

pertinent to our Historie, says <HI>Heywood, I</HI> thought necessarie to translate."—How then came they ascrib∣ed to <HI>Shakespeare?</HI> We will tell them that likewise. The same voluminous Writer published an <HI>Apology for Actors,</HI> 4to. 1612, and in an Appendix directed to his new Printer <HI>Nic.

<P>You now hope for land: We have seen through little matters, but what must be done with a whole book?—In 1751, was reprinted "A compendious or briefe examination of certayne ordinary complaints of diuers of our Countrymen in these our days: which although they are in some parte unjust and friuolous, yet are they all by way of Dialogue

<P>This extraordinary piece was originally published in 4to, 1581, and dedicated by the Author, "To the most vertuous and learned Lady, his most deare and soveraigne Princesse, <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; being inforced by her Majesties late and singular clemency in par∣doning certayne his unduetifull misdemeanour." And by the modern Editors, to the late King; as "a Treatise composed by the most extensive and fertile Genius, that ever any age or nation produced."</P>
<P>Here we join issue with the Writers of that excel∣lent, tho' very unequal work, the <HI>Biographia Bri∣tannica:</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>I must however correct a remark in the <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Spenser,</HI> which is impotently levelled at the first Criticks of the age. It is observed from the correspondence of <HI>Spenser</HI> and <HI>Gabriel Harvey,</HI> that the Plan of the <HI>Fairy Queen</HI> was laid, and part of it executed in 1580, <HI>three</HI> years before the <HI>Gierusalemme Liberata</HI> was printed: "hence appears the impertinence of all the apologies for his choice of <HI>Ariosto's</HI> manner in preference to <HI>Tasso's!"</HI></P><P>But the fact is not true with respect to <HI>Tasso.

I suspect, that <HI>Baillet</HI> is accountable for this mistake: who in the <HI>Jugemens des Savans,</HI> Tom. 3. p. 399. mentions no Edi∣tion previous to the 4to. <HI>Venice,</HI> 1583.</P><P>It is a question of long standing, whether a part of the <HI>Fairy Queen</HI> hath been <HI>lost,</HI> or whether the work was left <HI>unfinished:</HI> which may effectually be answered by a single quotation. <HI>William Browne</HI> published some Poems in <HI>Fol.</HI> 1616, under the name of <HI>Britannia's Pastorals,</HI> "esteemed <HI>then,</HI> says <HI>Wood,</HI> to be written in a sublime strain, and for subject <HI>amorous</HI> and <HI>very pleasing."</HI>—In one of which, <HI>Book</HI> 2. <HI>Song</HI> 1. he thus speaks of <HI>Spenser:</HI> <Q><L>"He sung th' heroicke Knights of Faiery land</L><L>In lines so elegant, of such command,</L><L>That had the <HI>Thracian</HI> plaid but halfe so well,</L><L>He had not left <HI>Eurydice</HI> in hell.</L><L>But <HI>e're he ended his melodious Song,</HI></L><L>An host of <HI>Angels</HI> flew the clouds among,</L><L>And rapt this Swan from his attentive mates,</L><L>To make him one of their associates</L><L>In heauens faire Quire: where now he sings the praise</L><L>Of him that is the <HI>First and Last of Dayes."</HI></L></Q></P><P>It appears, that <HI>Browne</HI> was intimate with <HI>Drayton, Jonson,</HI> and <HI>Selden,</HI> by their poems prefixed to his Book: he had therefore good opportunities of being acquainted with the fact abovementioned. Many of his Poems re∣main in MS. We have in our Library at <HI>Emmanuel</HI> a Masque of his, presented at the Inner Temple, <HI>Jan.</HI> 13. 1614.

<P>The concurring circumstances of the <HI>Name,</HI> and the <HI>Misdemeanor,</HI> which is supposed to be the old Story of <HI>Deer-stealing,</HI> seem fairly to challenge our Poet for the Author: but they hesitate. — His claim may appear to be confuted by the date 1581, when <HI>Shake∣speare</HI> was only <HI>Seventeen,</HI> and the <HI>long</HI> experience,

<P><PB N="74" REF="80"/>The justly celebrated Mr. <HI>Warton</HI> hath favoured us, in his <HI>Life of</HI> Dr. <HI>Bathurst,</HI> with some <HI>hearsay</HI> particulars concerning <HI>Shakespeare</HI> from the papers of <HI>Aubrey,</HI> which had been in the hands of <HI>Wood</HI>; and I ought not to suppress them, as the <HI>last</HI> seems to make against my doctrine.

<P><HI>"William Shakespeare's</HI> Father was a Butcher, — while he was a Boy be exercised his Father's trade, but when he killed a Calf, he would do it in a high stile, and make a speech.

<P>I will be short in my animadversions; and take them in their order.</P>
<P>The account of the <HI>Trade</HI> of the Family is not only contrary to all other Tradition, but, as it may seem, to the instrument from the Herald's office, so frequently reprinted.— <HI>Shakespeare</HI> most certainly went to <HI>London,</HI> and commenced Actor thro' neces∣sity, not natural inclination. —Nor have we any rea∣son to suppose, that he did act <HI>exceedingly well. Rowe</HI> tells us from the information of <HI>Betterton,</HI> who was inquisitive into this point, and had very early op∣portunities of Inquiry from Sir <HI>W. Davenant,</HI> that he was no <HI>extraordinary Actor</HI>; and that the top of his performance was the Ghost in his own <HI>Hamlet.</HI> Yet this <HI>Chef d' Oeuvre</HI> did not please: I will give you an original stroke at it.

<P>And to close the whole, it is not possible, accord∣ing to <HI>Aubrey</HI> himself, that <HI>Shakespeare</HI> could have been some <HI>years a Schoolmaster in the Country,:</HI> on which circumstance only the supposition of his learn∣ing is professedly founded. He was not surely <HI>very</HI> young, when he was employed to <HI>kill Calves,</HI> and he commenced Player about <HI>Eighteen!</HI>—The truth is, that he left his Father, for a Wife, a year sooner; and had at least two Children born at <HI>Stratford</HI> before he retired from thence to <HI>London.</HI> It is therefore sufficient∣ly clear, that poor <HI>Anthony</HI> had too much reason for his character of <HI>Aubrey:</HI> You will find it in his own Ac∣count of his Life, published by <HI>Hearne,</HI> which I would earnestly recommend to any Hypochondriack;</P>

<P>Thus much for the Learning of <HI>Shakespeare</HI> with respect to the ancient languages: indulge me with an observation or two on his supposed knowledge of the modern ones, and I will promise to release you.</P>
<P>"It is <HI>evident,</HI> we have been told, that he was not unacquainted with the <HI>Italian:"</HI> but let us in∣quire into the <HI>Evidence.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="85"/>Certainly some <HI>Italian</HI> words and phrases appear in the Works of <HI>Shakespeare</HI>; yet if we had nothing else to observe, their Orthography might lead us to suspect them to be not of the <HI>Writer's</HI> importation. But we can go further, and prove this.</P>

Neither <HI>Romeo</HI> nor <HI>Juliet</HI>; neither <HI>Montague</HI> nor <HI>Ca∣pulet</HI> appears in this performance: and how came they to the knowledge of <HI>Shakespeare?</HI> — Nothing is more certain, than that he chiefly followed the Trans∣lation by <HI>Painter</HI> from the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Boisteau,</HI> and hence arise the Deviations from <HI>Bandello's</HI> original <HI>Italian.</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><P>It is remarked, that <HI>"Paris,</HI> tho' in one place called <HI>Earl,</HI> is most commonly stiled the <HI>Countie</HI> in this Play. <HI>Shakespeare</HI> seems to have preferred, for some reason or other, the <HI>Italian Conte</HI> to our <HI>Count:</HI>— perhaps he took it from the old <HI>English</HI> Novel, from which he is said to have taken his Plot." — He certainly did so: <HI>Paris</HI> is there first stiled <HI>a young Earle,</HI> and afterward <HI>Counte, Countee,</HI> and <HI>County</HI>; according to the unsettled Ortho∣graphy of the time.</P><P>The word however is frequently met with in other Writers; particularly in <HI>Fairfax:</HI> <Q><L>"As when a Captaine doth besiege some hold,</L><L>Set in a marish or high on a hill,</L><L>And trieth waies and wiles a thousand fold,</L><L>To bring the piece subjected to his will;</L><L>So far'd the <HI>Countie</HI> with the Pagan bold. &amp;c."</L><BIBL><HI>Godfrey of Bulloigne.</HI> Book 7.

It seems however from a passage in <HI>Ames's</HI> Typogra∣phical Antiquities, that <HI>Painter</HI> was not the only Translator of this popular Story: and it is possible therefore, that <HI>Shakespeare</HI> might have other assistance.</P>

<P>More hath been said concerning <HI>Shakespeare's</HI> ac∣quaintance with the <HI>French</HI> language. In the Play of <HI>Henry the fifth,</HI> we have a whole Scene in it: and in other places it occurs familiarly in the Dialogue.</P>
<P>We may observe in general, that the early Edi∣tions have not half the quantity; and every sentence, or rather every word most ridiculously blundered. These, for several reasons, could not possibly be pub∣lished by the Author;<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><P>Every writer on <HI>Shakespeare</HI> hath expressed his asto∣nishment, that his author was not solicitous to secure his Fame by a correct Edition of his performances. This matter is not understood. When a Poet was connected with a particular Playhouse, he constantly sold his Works to the <HI>Company,</HI> and it was their interest to keep them from a number of Rivals. A favourite Piece, as <HI>Heywood</HI> informs us, only got into print, when it was copied <HI>by the ear,</HI> "for a double sale would bring on a supicion of honestie." <HI>Shakespeare</HI> therefore himself published nothing in the <HI>Drama:</HI> when he left the Stage, his copies re∣mained with his Fellow-Managers, <HI>Heminge</HI> and <HI>Condell</HI>; who at their own retirement, about seven years after the death of the Author, gave the world the Edition now known by the name of the <HI>first Folio</HI>; and call the pre∣vious publications "stolne and surreptitious, maimed and deformed by the frauds and stealths of injurious im∣postors." But <HI>this</HI> was printed from the Playhouse Copies; which in a series of years had been frequently altered thro' convenience, caprice, or ignorance. We have a sufficient instance of the liberties taken by the Actors, in an old pamphlet, by <HI>Nash,</HI> called <HI>Lenten Stuffe, with the Prayse of the red Herring,</HI> 4to. 1599. where he assures us, that in a Play of his, called the <HI>Isle of Dogs, "foure acts,</HI> without his consent, or the least guesse of his drift or scope, were supplied by the Players."</P><P>This however was not his first quarrel with them. In the Epistle prefixed to <HI>Greene's Arcadia,</HI> which I have quoted before, <HI>Tom.</HI> hath a lash at some "vaine glorious Tragedians," and very plainly at <HI>Shakespeare</HI> in particu∣lar; which will serve for an answer to an observation of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> that had almost been forgotten: "It was thought a praise to <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> that he scarce ever blot∣ted a line: — I believe the common opinion of his want of learning proceeded from no better ground. This too might be thought a <HI>praise</HI> by some." — But hear <HI>Nash,</HI> who was far from <HI>praising:</HI> "I leaue all these to the mer∣cy of their <HI>Mother-tongue,</HI> that feed on nought but the crums that fall from the <HI>Translator's</HI> trencher. — That could scarcely <HI>Latinize</HI> their neck verse if they should haue neede, yet <HI>English Seneca</HI> read by Candlelight yeelds many good sentences — hee will affoord you whole <HI>Hamlets,</HI> I should say, <HI>Handfuls</HI> of tragicall speeches." —I cannot determine exactly when this <HI>Epistle</HI> was first published; but, I fancy, it will carry the original <HI>Ham∣let</HI> somewhat further back than we have hitherto done: and it may be observed, that the oldest Copy now extant is said to be "Enlarged to almost as much againe as it was." <HI>Gabriel Harvey</HI> printed at the end of the year 1592, "Foure Letters and certaine Sonnetts, especially touch∣ing <HI>Robert Greene:"</HI> in one of which his <HI>Arcadia</HI> is men∣tioned. Now <HI>Nash's</HI> Epistle must have been previous to these, as <HI>Gabriel</HI> is quoted in it with applause; and the <HI>Foure Letters</HI> were the beginning of a quarrel. <HI>Nash</HI> re∣plied, in "Strange newes of the intercepting certaine Letters, and a Convoy of Verses, as they were going <HI>privilie</HI> to victuall the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> 1593." <HI>Harvey</HI> re∣joined the same year in <HI>"Pierce's</HI> Supererogation, or a new praise of the old Asse." And <HI>Nash</HI> again, in "Have with you to <HI>Saffron-walden,</HI> or <HI>Gabriell Harvey's</HI> hunt is up; containing a full answer to the eldest Sonne of the halter-maker. 1596."</P><P>Dr. <HI>Lodge</HI> calls <HI>Nash</HI> our <HI>true English Aretine:</HI> and <HI>John Taylor,</HI> in his <HI>Kicksey Winsey, or a Lerry Come-twang,</HI> even makes an oath "by sweet Satyricke <HI>Nash</HI> his urne." — He died before 1606, as appears from an old Comedy, called, "The return from <HI>Parnassus."</HI></P></NOTE> and it is extremely probable,
<PB N="85" REF="91"/>
that the <HI>French</HI> ribaldry was at first inserted by a dif∣ferent hand, as the many additions most certainly were after he had left the Stage. — Indeed, every
<PB N="86" REF="92"/>
friend to his memory will not easily believe, that he was acquainted with the Scene between <HI>Catharine</HI> and the <HI>old Gentlewoman</HI>; or surely he would not have admitted such obscenity and nonsense.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hawkins,</HI> in the Appendix to Mr. <HI>Johnson's</HI> Edition, hath an ingenious observation to prove, that <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> supposing the <HI>French</HI> to be his, had very little knowledge of the language.</P>
<P>"Est-il impossible d'eschapper la force de ton <HI>Bras?"</HI> says a <HI>Frenchman.</HI>— <HI>"Brass,</HI> cur?" replies <HI>Pistol.</HI></P>

In his Epistle prefatory to the <HI>Gentle Doctors of Gaule,</HI> he cries out for persecution, very like <HI>Jack</HI> in that most poignant of Satires, the <HI>Tale of a Tub,</HI> "I pray you be readie quickly to cauill at my booke, I beseech you heartily calumniate my doings with speede, I request you humbly controll my method as soone as you may, I ear∣nestly entreat you hisse at my inventions, &amp;c."</NOTE> and of the latter from the Rhymes of <HI>Marot, Ronsard,</HI> and <HI>Du Bartas.</HI> — Connections of this kind were very common. <HI>Shakespeare</HI> himself assisted <HI>Ben. Jonson</HI> in his <HI>Sejanus,</HI> as it was originally written; and <HI>Fletcher</HI> in his <HI>Two noble Kinsmen.</HI></P>
<P>But what if the <HI>French</HI> scene were occasionally in∣troduced into every Play on this Subject? and per∣haps
<PB N="88" REF="94"/>
there were more than one before our Poet's. — In <HI>Pierce Penilesse his Supplication to the Diuell,</HI> 4to. 1592. (which, it seems, from the Epistle to the Printer, was not the first Edition,) the Author, <HI>Nash,</HI> exclaims, "What a glorious thing it is to have <HI>Henry the fifth</HI> represented on the Stage leading the <HI>French King</HI> prisoner, and forcing both him and the <HI>Dolphin</HI> to sweare fealty!" — And it appears from the Jests of the famous Comedian, <HI>Tarlton,</HI> 4to. 1611. that he had been particularly celebrated in the Part of the <HI>Clown</HI> in <HI>Henry the fifth</HI>; but no such Character exists in the Play of <HI>Shakespeare. — Henry the sixth</HI> hath ever been doubted; and a passage in the above-quoted piece of <HI>Nash</HI> may give us rea∣son to believe, it was previous to our Author. "How would it haue joyed braue <HI>Talbot</HI> (the terror of the <HI>French</HI>) to thinke that after he had lyen two hundred yeare in his Toomb, he should triumph again on the Stage; and haue his bones new em∣balmed with the teares of ten thousand spectators at least (at seuerall times) who in the Tragedian that represents his person, imagine they behold him fresh bleeding."—I have no doubt but <HI>Henry the sixth</HI> had the same Author with <HI>Edward the third,</HI> which hath been recovered to the world in Mr. <HI>Capell's Prolusions.</HI></P>
<P>It hath been observed, that the <HI>Giant</HI> of <HI>Rabelais</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>
is sometimes alluded to by <HI>Shakespeare:</HI> and in <HI>his</HI> time no translation was extant. — But the Story was in every one's hand.</P>
<P>In a Letter by one <HI>Laneham,</HI> or <HI>Langham,</HI> for the name is written differently, <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">It is indeed of no importance, but I suspect the for∣mer to be right, as I find it corrupted afterward to <HI>La∣nam</HI> and <HI>Lanum.</HI></NOTE> concerning the Enter∣tainment at <HI>Killingwoorth Castle,</HI> printed 1575, we have a list of the vulgar Romances of the age, "King <HI>Arthurz</HI> book, <HI>Huon</HI> of <HI>Burdeaus,</HI> Friar <HI>Rous, Howle∣glass,</HI> and GARGANTUA. <HI>Meres</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><P>This Author by a pleasant mistake in some sensible <HI>Conjectures on Shakespeare</HI> lately printed at <HI>Oxford,</HI> is quot∣ed by the name of <HI>Maister.</HI> Perhaps the Title-page was imperfect; it runs thus "Palladis Tamia. Wits Trea∣sury. Being the second part of Wits Common-wealth, By <HI>Francis Meres Maister</HI> of Artes of both Universities."</P><P>I am glad out of gratitude to this man, who hath been of frequent service to me, that I am enabled to perfect <HI>Wood's</HI> account of him; from the assistance of our <HI>Master</HI>'s very accurate List of Graduates, (which it would do honour to the University to print at the publick expense) and the kind information of a Friend from the Register of his Parish: —— He was originally of <HI>Pembroke-Hall,</HI> B. A. in 1587, and M. A. 1591. About 1602 he became Rector of <HI>Wing</HI> in <HI>Rutland</HI>; and died there, 1646, in the 81st year of his Age.</P></NOTE> mentions him as equally hurtful to young minds with the <HI>Four Sons</HI> of <HI>Aymon,</HI> and the <HI>Seven Champions.</HI> And <HI>John Taylor</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>
hath him likewise in his catalogue of <HI>Authors,</HI> pre∣fixed to Sir <HI>Gregory Nonsence.</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">I have quoted many pieces of <HI>John Taylor,</HI> but it was impossible to give their original dates. He may be traced as an Author for more than half a Century. His <HI>Works</HI> were collected in <HI>Folio,</HI> 1630. but many were printed afterward; I will mention one for the Humour of the Title. "Drinke and welcome, or the famous History of the most part of Drinkes in use in <HI>Greate Britain</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land</HI>; with an especial Declaration of the Potency, Ver∣tue, and Operation of our <HI>English</HI> Ale: with a description of all sorts of <HI>Waters,</HI> from the <HI>Ocean Sea</HI> to the <HI>Tears of a Woman.</HI> 4to. 1633." — In <HI>Wits Merriment, or Lusty Drollery,</HI> 1656. we have an "Epitaph on <HI>John Taylor,</HI> who was born in the City of <HI>Glocester,</HI> and died in <HI>Phoe∣nix Alley,</HI> in the 75 yeare of his age; you may find him, if the worms have not devoured him, in <HI>Covent Garden</HI> Church-yard." p. 130.— He died about two years before.</NOTE></P>
<P>But to come to a conclusion, I will give you an irrefragable argument, that <HI>Shakespeare</HI> did <HI>not</HI> un∣derstand <HI>two</HI> very common words in the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> languages.</P>
<P>According to the Articles of agreement between the Conqueror <HI>Henry</HI> and the King of <HI>France,</HI> the latter was to stile the former, (in the corrected <HI>French</HI> of the modern Editions,) "Nostre <HI>tres cher</HI> filz <HI>Henry</HI> Roy d' <HI>Angleterre</HI>; and in <HI>Latin, Praeclarissimus</HI> Filius, &amp;c." What, says Dr. <HI>Warburton,</HI> is <HI>tres cher</HI> in <HI>French, praeclarissimus</HI> in <HI>Latin!</HI> we should read <HI>praecarissimus.</HI> — This appears to be exceedingly true; but how came the blunder? it is a typographical one
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
in <HI>Holingshed,</HI> which <HI>Shakespeare</HI> copied; but must in∣disputably have corrected, had he been acquainted with the languages. — "Our said Father, during his life, shall name, call, and write us in <HI>French</HI> in this maner: Nostre <HI>tres chier</HI> filz, <HI>Henry</HI> Roy d' <HI>Engleterre</HI> — and in <HI>Latine</HI> in this maner, <HI>Praeclarissimus</HI> filius noster." Edit 1587. p. 574.</P>
<P>To corroborate this instance, let me observe to you, though it be nothing further to the purpose, that another error of the same kind hath been the source of a mistake in an historical passage of our Author; which hath ridiculously troubled the Criticks.</P>
<P><HI>Richard the third</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><P>Some inquiry hath been made for the first Performers of the capital Characters in <HI>Shakespeare.</HI></P><P>We learn, that <HI>Burbage,</HI> the <HI>alter Roscius</HI> of <HI>Camden,</HI> was the original <HI>Richard,</HI> from a passage in the Poems of Bishop <HI>Corbet</HI>; who introduces his Host at <HI>Bosworth</HI> de∣scribing the Battle, <Q><L>"But when he would have said King <HI>Richard</HI> died,</L><L>And call'd <HI>a Horse, a Horse,</HI> he <HI>Burbage</HI> cried."</L></Q></P>
<P>The Play on this subject mentioned by Sir <HI>John Har∣rington</HI> in his <HI>Apologie for Poetrie,</HI> 1591, and sometimes mistaken for <HI>Shakespeare's,</HI> was a <HI>Latin</HI> one, written by Dr. <HI>Legge</HI>; and acted at <HI>St. John's</HI> in our University. some years before 1588, the date of the Copy in the <HI>Museum.</HI> This appears from a better MS. in our Library at <HI>Emmanuel,</HI> with the names of the original Performers.</P><P>It is evident from a passage in <HI>Camden's Annals,</HI> that there was an old Play likewise on the subject of <HI>Richard the second</HI>; but I know not in what language. Sir <HI>Gelley Merrick,</HI> who was concerned in the harebrained business of the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> and was hanged for it with the in∣genious <HI>Cuffe</HI> in 1601, is accused amongst other things, "quod <HI>exoletam</HI> Tragoediam de tragicâ abdicatione Re∣gis <HI>Ricardi secundi</HI> in publico Theatro coram Conjuratis datâ pecuniâ agi curasset."</P></NOTE> harangues his army before the Battle of <HI>Bosworth,</HI>
<Q><PB N="92" REF="98"/>
<L>"Remember whom ye are to cope withal,</L>
<L>A sort of vagabonds, of rascals, runaways —</L>
<L>And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow</L>
<L>Long kept in <HI>Britaine</HI> at <HI>our Mother's</HI> cost,</L>
<L>A milksop, &amp;c." —</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>"Our</HI> Mother," Mr. <HI>Theobald</HI> perceives to be wrong, and <HI>Henry</HI> was somewhere secreted on the <HI>Continent:</HI> he reads therefore, and all the Editors after him,
<Q>"Long kept in <HI>Bretague</HI> at <HI>his</HI> mother's cost."</Q></P>
<P>But give me leave to transcribe a few more lines from <HI>Holingshed,</HI> and you will find at once, that <HI>Shakespeare</HI> had been there before me: — "Ye see further, how a companie of traitors, theeves, out∣laws and runnagates be aiders and partakers of his feat and enterprise. — And to begin with the erle of Richmond captaine of this rebellion, he is a Welsh milksop — brought up by <HI>my Moother's</HI> meanes and mine, like a captive in a close cage in the court of <HI>Francis</HI> duke of <HI>Britaine."</HI> p. 756.</P>
<P><HI>Holingshed</HI> copies this <HI>verbatim</HI> from his Brother Chronicler <HI>Hall,</HI> Edit. 1548. <HI>fol.</HI> 54. but his Printer
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
hath given us by accident the word <HI>Moother</HI> instead of <HI>Brother</HI>; as it is in the Original, and ought to be in <HI>Shakespeare.</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">I cannot take my leave of <HI>Holingshed</HI> without clearing up a difficulty, which hath puzzled his Biographers. <HI>Nicholson</HI> and other Writers have <HI>supposed</HI> him a <HI>Clergyman. Tanner</HI> goes further, and tells us, that he was educated at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and actually took the Degree of M. A. in 1544. — Yet it appears by his Will, printed by <HI>Hearne,</HI> that at the end of life he was only a <HI>Steward,</HI> or a <HI>Ser∣vant</HI> in some capacity or other, to <HI>Thomas Burdett</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Bromcote</HI> in <HI>Warwickshire.</HI> — These things Dr. <HI>Camp∣bell</HI> could not reconcile. The truth is, we have no claim to the education of the <HI>Chronicler:</HI> the M. A. in 1544, was not <HI>Raphael,</HI> but one <HI>Ottiwell Holingshed,</HI> who was afterward named by the Founder one of the first Fellows of <HI>Trinity College.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>I hope, my good Friend, you have by this time acquitted our great Poet of all piratical depredations on the Ancients, and are ready to receive my <HI>Con∣clusion.</HI> — He remembered perhaps enough of his <HI>school-boy</HI> learning to put the <HI>Hig, hag, hog,</HI> into the mouth of Sir <HI>Hugh Evans</HI>; and might pick up in the Writers of the time, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ascham</HI> in the Epistle prefixed to his <HI>Toxophilus,</HI> 1571, observes of them, that "Manye <HI>Englishe</HI> writers, usinge straunge wordes, as <HI>Lattine, Frenche,</HI> and <HI>Italian,</HI> do make all thinges darke and harde. Ones, says he, I communed with a man which reasoned the <HI>Englishe</HI> tongue to be en∣riched and encreased thereby, sayinge: Who will not prayse that feast, where a man shall drincke at a dinner both wyne, ale, and beere? Truly (quoth I) they be al good, euery one taken by himselfe alone, but if you put Malmesye, and sacke, redde wyne and white, ale and beere, and al in one pot, you shall make a drinke neither easye to be knowen, nor yet holsome for the bodye."</NOTE> or the course of his con∣versation
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>
a familiar phrase or two of <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Italian:</HI> but his <HI>Studies</HI> were most demonstratively confined to <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>his own Language.</HI></P>
<P>In the course of this disquisition, you have often smiled at "all such reading, as was never read:" and possibly I may have indulged it too far: but it is the reading necessary for a Comment on <HI>Shakespeare.</HI> Those who apply solely to the Ancients for this pur∣pose, may with equal wisdom study the TALMUD for an Exposition of TRISTRAM SHANDY. Nothing but an intimate acquaintance with the Writers of the time, who are frequently of no other value, can point out his allusions, and ascertain his Phraseology. The Reformers of his Text are for ever equally po∣sitive, and equally wrong. The Cant of the Age, a provincial Expression, an obscure Proverb, an obso∣lete Custom, a Hint at a Person or a Fact no longer remembered, hath continually defeated the best of our <HI>Guessers:</HI> You must not suppose me to speak at random, when I assure you, that from some forgot∣ten book or other, I can demonstrate this to you in many hundred Places; and I almost wish, that I had not been persuaded into a different Employment.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="101"/>Tho' I have as much of the <HI>Natale Solum</HI> about me, as any man whatsoever; yet, I own, the <HI>Prim∣rose Path</HI> is still more pleasing than the <HI>Fosse</HI> or the <HI>Watling Street:</HI>
<Q><L>"Age cannot wither it, nor custom stale</L>
<L>It's infinite variety." —</L></Q>
And when I am fairly rid of the Dust of topogra∣phical Antiquity, which hath continued much longer about me than I expected; you may very probably be troubled again with the ever fruitful Subject of SHAKESPEARE and his COMMENTATORS.</P>
