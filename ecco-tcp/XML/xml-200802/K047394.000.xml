<P>WHICH IS THE MAN? A COMEDY, AS ACTED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL IN COVENT-GARDEN. By Mrs. COWLEY.</P>
<P><HI>LONDON:</HI> Printed for C. DILLY, in the Poultry. 1783. [Price One Shilling and Sixpence]</P>

<PB REF="2"/>
<HEAD><HI>It having been reported, that the Comedy was written by a Military Character; a Gentleman of acknowledged genius favoured the Author with the following</HI> PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>Spoken by</HI> MR. LEE LEWES, <HI>dressed as an Officer.</HI></STAGE>
<L>CALL'D forth Thalia's standard to display,</L>
<L>And here maintain her sov'reign comic sway,</L>
<L>As Chief—I'll reconnoitre well the ground,</L>
<L>To learn what hostile lines are drawn around!</L>
<STAGE>[Surveys the House with a glass.</STAGE>
<L>That's not a dark defile in yonder glade?—</L>
<L>For should it prove a treach'rous ambuscade,</L>
<L>No <HI>puffing</HI> miners have I here in pay,</L>
<L>To sap their works, or turn their covert way;</L>
<L>No mercenary band who have been wont</L>
<L>To hack and hew like pioneers, in front!</L>
<L>With flying shells our Engineers shall try</L>
<L>That well-mann'd battlement which tow'rs so high!</L>
<STAGE>[Pointing to the Upper Gallery.</STAGE>
<L>Beneath, our point-blank shot will surely reach,</L>
<L>And in yon half-moon'd battery make a breach.</L>
<STAGE>[To the Second Gallery.</STAGE>
<L>These lovely breast-works that adorn the field,</L>
<L>To Nature's gentle summons soon must yield!</L>
<STAGE>[Side-Boxes, &amp;c.</STAGE>
<L>This advanc'd post the picket-guard to keep,</L>
<L>And that reserve, who are entrench'd chin-deep,</L>
<L>We hope to carry by a bold exertion,</L>
<L>At least amuse with some well-plann'd diversion!</L>
<STAGE>[To the Pit.</STAGE>
<L>My troops are vet'rans:—it has been their lot,</L>
<L>To form in front of service hissing-hot;</L>
<L>Who, when their ranks are gall'd, or put to flight,</L>
<L>Are sure to rally, and renew the fight,</L>
<L>Unless—and then no light-dragoons scour fleeter,</L>
<L>Their powder fails for want of true salt-petre!</L>
<L>Our plan's avow'd; it is from this firm station,</L>
<L>To gain the heights of public approbation!</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>HERE, Betty, Dick! Where are ye? Don't you see my Lord <HI>Sparkle</HI>'s car∣riage?—I shall have my lodgers disturbed with their thun∣dering.—What, in the name of wonder, can bring him here at this time in the morning?—Here he comes, look∣ing like a rake as he is!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> LORD SPARKLE <HI>(yawning).</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bid 'em turn; I shan't stay a moment.—So, Mrs. <HI>Johnson,</HI> I pull'd the string just to see how your Syl∣vans go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>As usual, my Lord; but, bless me! how early your Lordship is!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>How late, you mean.—I have not been in bed since yesterday at one!—I am going home now to rest for an hour or two, and then to the Drawing-room.—But what are the two rustics about? I have not been plagued with them these three or four days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are now out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppos'd that, or I should not have call'd.—But prithee, do they talk of returning to their native woods again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no, Sir!—The young gentleman seems to have very different ideas:—Miss, too, has great spirits, though she seems now and then at a loss what to do with herself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do with herself! Why don't you persuade her to go back to Cornwall? You should tell 'em what a vile place London is, full of snares, and debaucheries, and witch-crafts.—You don't <HI>preach</HI> to 'em, <HI>Johnson.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I do, my Lord; and their constant answer is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh, Lord <HI>Sparkle</HI> is our friend! Lord <HI>Sparkle</HI> would take it amiss if we should go; 'twould look like distrusting his Lordship."</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was ever man so hamper'd!—Two fools! to mistake common forms and civilities for attachments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear, my Lord, towards the young Lady something <HI>more</HI> than forms—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(interrupting)</STAGE>
<P> Never, upon my honour!—I kissed her; so I did all the women in the parish—the septennial ceremony. The Brother I us'd to drink vile Port with, listen to his village-stories, call his vulgarity wit, and his impudence spirit. Was not that fatigue and mortification enough, but I must be <HI>bored</HI> with 'em here in Town?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, <HI>Miss,</HI> Sir, talks of pressing invitations, and letters, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Things of course; they had influence, and got me the borough. I, in return, said she was the most charm∣ing girl in the world; that I ador'd her;—and some few things that every body says on such occasions, and nobody thinks of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it appears that Miss <HI>did</HI> think—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, 'faith: and on my writing a civil note that I should be happy to see them in Town, <HI>et caetera—</HI>which <HI>I</HI> meant to have suspended our acquaintance till the General Election—they took me at my word; and before I thought the letter had reach'd 'em, they were in my house, all joy and congratulation. I didn't chuse to be encumber'd with 'em, so placed 'em with you. The Boy was at first amu∣sing, but our Circles have had him, and I must be rid of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must say, I wish I was quit of them at present; for my constant lodger Mr. <HI>Belville</HI> came to town last night, and he wants this drawing-room to himself: he's oblig'd to share it now with Mr. <HI>Pendragon</HI> and his sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey! <HI>Belville!—</HI>'Gad, that's lucky! There is not a fellow in Town better receiv'd by the women.—Throw the girl in his way, and get quit of her at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you mean dishonestly, my Lord, you have mistaken your person: I did not live so many years with your mother to be capable of such a thing.—Ah, my Lord, if my Lady were living—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>She would scold to little purpose,—and you may spare yourself the trouble.—I tell you, I care nothing about the girl: I merely want to get rid of her, and you must assist me.— <STAGE><HI>(Mrs.</HI> Johnson <HI>turns from him with disgust)</HI></STAGE>—Hey-dey! the nicety of your Ladyship's honour is piqued! Ha! ha! ha!—the mistress of a lodging-house!<HI>—Bien drole—</HI>Ha! ha! ha! <STAGE><HI>[Exit Mrs.</HI> Johnson.</STAGE> But who is this hobbling up stairs?—Ha! old Cato the Censor, my honourable cousin!—What the devil shall I do?—No avoiding him, however.—</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mr.</HI> FITZHERBERT.</STAGE>
<P>I wish I had been out of the house, <HI>Fitzherbert,</HI> before you appeared! I know I shall not escape without some abuse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitzh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never throw away reproof, where there are no hopes of amendment—your Lordship is safe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Am I to take that for wit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitzh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; for then I fear you would not understand it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Positively, you must give me more of the felicity of your conversation: I want you to teach me some of that happy ease which you possess in your rude∣ness; 'twould be to me an acquisition. I am eternally get∣ting into the most horrid scrapes, merely by politeness and good-breeding.—Here are two persons now in this house, for instance—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitzh.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(interrupting)</STAGE>
<P> Who do <HI>not</HI> know, that the lan∣guage of what <HI>you</HI> call politeness, differs from that of truth and honour.—You see I know those to whom you allude.—But we only lose time!—Good day, my Lord!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lose time! Ha! ha! ha!—Why, of what value can time be to you? the greatest enemy you have, adding every day to your wrinkles and ill-humour. I'll prove to you now, that I have employ'd the last twelve hours to better purpose than you have. Nine of them you slept away—the last three you have been running about Town, <HI>snarling</HI> and making people uneasy with themselves;—whilst I
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
have been sitting peaceably at Weltjie's, where I have won—guess what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Half as much as you lost yesterday—a thousand or two guineas, perhaps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Guineas! Poh! you are jesting! Guineas are as scarce with us, as in the coffers of the Congress. Like them we stake with counters, and play for solid earth.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>

<P> Well!</P>

<P>Bullion is a mercantile kind of wealth, passing thro' the hands of dry-salters, vinegar-merchants, and Lord-Mayors.<HI>—Our</HI> Goddess holds a cornucopia instead of a purse, from which she pours corn-fields, fruitful vallies, and rich herds. This morning she popp'd into my dice-box a snug villa, five hundred acres, arable and pasture, with the next presentation to the living of Guzzleton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>A church-living in a dice-box!—Well, well; I suppose it will be bestow'd as worthily as it was gain'd!—Good day, my Lord, good day!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Late, Sir.—We should have been earlier, but we met with Sir Harry Hairbrain on the road, with his new fox-hounds.—Fell in with the hunt at Bagshot—broke cover, run the first burst across the heath towards Datchet;—she then took right an end for Egham, sunk the wind upon us as far as Staines, where Reynard took the road to Oxford, and we the route to Town, Sir.</P>

<P>Just risen from your pillows!—Are you not asham'd of this? A fox-hunter, and in bed at eleven!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, morose, charming, quarrelsome old friend, I am ever in character!—In the country, I defy fatigue and hardship.—Up before the lazy slut Aurora has put on her pink-coloured gown to captivate the plough-boys—scam∣per over hedge and ditch. Dead with hunger, alight at a cottage; drink milk from the hands of a brown wench, and eat from a wooden platter. In Town, I am a fine gentle∣man; have my hair exactly dressed; my cloaths <HI>au dernier gout;</HI> dine on made-dishes; drink Burgundy; and, in a word, am every-where the <HI>ton.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the worse, so much the worse, young man! To be the <HI>ton</HI> where Vice and Folly are the ruling deities, proves that you must be sometimes a fool, at others a—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(interrupting)</STAGE>
<P> Psha! you satirists, like moles, shut your eyes to the light, and grope about for the dark side of the human character: there is a great deal of good-sense and good-meaning in the world. As for its follies, I think folly a mighty pleasant thing; at least, to play the fool <HI>gracefully,</HI> requires more talents than would set up a dozen cynics.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitzh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then half the people I know must have <HI>wond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rful</HI> talents, for they have been playing the fool from sixteen to sixty.<HI>—Apropos!</HI> I found my precious kinsman Lord <HI>Sparkle</HI> here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! there's an instance of the happy effects of total indifference to the sage maxims you recommend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Happy</HI> effects do you call them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most triumphant! Who so much admired? who so much the fashion?—the general favourite of the Ladies, and the common object of imitation with the men. Is not Lord <HI>Sparkle</HI> the happy man, who's to carry the rich and charming widow Lady <HI>Bell Bloomer</HI> from so many rivals?—And will not you, after quarrelling with him half your life, leave him a fine estate at the end of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no!—I tell you, No!</P>
<STAGE>[With warmth.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, his success with the widow is certain.—He boasts his triumph every-where; and as she is such a fa∣vourite of yours, every thing else will follow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitzh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; for if she marries <HI>Sparkle,</HI> she will be no longer a favourite. Yet she receives him with a degree of
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
distinction that sometimes makes me fear it; for we fre∣quently see women of accomplishments and beauty, to which every heart yields homage, throw themselves into the arms of the debauched, the silly, and the vain.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter a</HI> SERVANT.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Beauchamp.</HI></P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitzh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I expected him to call on you this morning. You must obtain his confidence; it will assist me in my de∣signs. When I found myself disappointed in my hopes of his Lordship, I selected <HI>Beauchamp</HI> from the younger branches of my family: but of this he knows nothing, and thinks himself under high obligations to the patronage of the Peer; an error in which I wish him to continue, as it will give me an opportunity of proving them both.—But here he comes!—This way I can avoid him.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> BEAUCHAMP.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Beauchamp!—</HI>and in regimentals!—Why, prithee, <HI>George,</HI> what spirit has seized thee now? When I saw thee last, thou wert devoted to the grave profession of the Law, or the Church; and I expected to have seen thee invelop'd in wig, wrangling at the bar; or seated in a fat benefice, receiving tythe-pigs and poultry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those, <HI>Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ville,</HI> were my school-designs; but the fire of youth gave me ardors of a different sort. The heroes of the Areopagus and the Forum have yielded to those of Marathon; and I feel, that whilst my country is struggling amidst surrounding foes, I ought not to devote a life to learned indolence, that might be gloriously hazarded in her defence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(smiling.)</STAGE>
<P> I shan't give you credit now for that fine flourish.—This sudden ardor for "the pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war,"—I dare swear this heroic spirit springs from the whim of some fine Lady, who fancied you would be a smarter fellow in a cockade and gorget, than in a stiff band and perriwig.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauch.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your infinuation means that my heart has not been insensible of the charms of some fair Lady, you are right; but my transformation is owing to no whim of her's: for, oh <HI>Charles!</HI> she never yet condescended to make me the object of her thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Modest too!—Ay, you were right to give up the
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
Law.—But who, pray, may this exalted Fair-one be who never <HI>condescended?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never suffer my lips to wanton with the charm∣ing sounds that form her name. I have a kind of <HI>miserly</HI> felicity in gloting on her dear idea, that would be impaired, should it be known to exist in my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! who <HI>can</HI> be the nymph who has inspired so <HI>obsolete</HI> a passion!—In the days of chivalry it wou'd have been the <HI>ton.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will gratify you thus far: The Lady has beauty, wit, and spirit; but, above all, a <HI>mind.—</HI>Is it possible, <HI>Charles,</HI> to love a woman without a mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has she a mind for you? That is the most im∣portant question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare not feed my passion with so presumptuous a hope; yet I would not extinguish it, if I could: for it is not a love that tempts me into corners to wear out my days in complaints: it prompts me to use them for the most important purposes:—the ardors it gives me, shall be felt in the land of our enemies; they shall know how <HI>well</HI> I love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poh! poh! this is the gallantry of One Thousand One Hundred and One; the kind of passion that animated our fathers in the fields of Cressy and Poictiers.—Why, no Beauty of our age, man, will be won in this stile!—Now, suppose yourself at the Opera <STAGE>(looking through his hand)</STAGE><Q REND="inline margQuotes"> "Gad, that's a fine girl! Twenty thousand, you say? I think I'll have her. Yes, she'll do! I—I must have her! I'll call on her to-morrow and tell her so."</Q> Have you spirit and courage enough for that, my Achilles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauch.</SPEAKER>
<P>No truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then give up all thoughts of being received.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no thoughts of hazarding a reception. The pride of birth, and a few hundreds for my education, were the sole patrimony the imprudence of a father left me. My relation Lord <HI>Sparkle</HI> has procured for me a commission.—Generously to offer that and a knapsack to a Lady of five thousand a year, would be properly answered by a con∣temptuous dismission.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose she should take a fancy to your knap∣sack?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauch.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would reduce <HI>me</HI> to the necessity of de∣priving <HI>myself</HI> of a happiness I would die to obtain; for
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
never can I submit to be quartered on a Wife's fortune; whilst I have a sword to carve subsistence for myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be in the <HI>great</HI> stile; but 'tis scarcely in the <HI>polite.</HI> Will you take chocolate in my dressing-room?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauch.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I am going to take orders at my Colonel's: where shall we meet in the evening?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Faith, 'tis impossible to tell! I commit myself to Chance for the remainder of the day, and shall finish it as she directs.</P>

<P>Poor Lady Squander!

<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I missed him every where!—At four places he was just gone as I came in.—But what does it signify?—'Twas Lady <HI>Bell Bloomer</HI> he was seeking, I dare swear:—his attachment to the <HI>relict</HI> is every where the subject. Hang those widows! I really believe there's something ca∣balistical in their names.—No less than fourteen fine young fellows of fortune have been drawn into the matrimonial noose by them since last February.—'Tis well they were threatened with imprisonment, or we should not have had an unmarried Infant above seventeen, between Charing-Cross and Portman-Square.</P>

<P>Have I not cause? Till she broke upon the Town, I was at the top of fashion—you know I was. My dress, my equipage, my furniture, and myself, were the criterions

<P> But, <HI>Tiffany,</HI> she is to be at court to-day, out of mourning for the first time: I am resolved to be there.—No, I won't go neither, now I think on't.—If she shou'd really outshine me, her triumph will be increased by my being witness to it.—I won't go to St. James's; but I'll go to her route this evening, and, if 'tis possible, prevent Lord <HI>Sparkle</HI>'s being particular to her.—Perhaps that will put her in an ill humour, and then the advantage will be on my side.</P>

<P>Mercy on us! To be a chamber-maid to a <HI>Miss</HI> on the brink of Thirty requires as good politics, as being Prime Minister!

<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHAT an invaluable treasure! Those dear papers, that have lain within the frigid walls of a Convent, insensible, and uninteresting to every one around them, contain for <HI>me</HI> a world of happiness. He is in England! How little he suspects that <HI>I</HI> too am here!</P>

<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fitzherbert</HI> will be here immediately, Ma'am.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fitzherbert!</HI> Very well. Has Lady <HI>Bell</HI> finished dressing yet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(speaking exceedingly fast)</STAGE>
<P>No, Ma'am.—Mr. <HI>Crape</HI> the hair-dresser has been with her these three hours, and her maid is running here and there, and Mr. <HI>John</HI> flying about to milliners and perfumers, and the new <HI>vis-à-vis</HI> at the door to carry her Ladyship to court—Every thing black banished, and the liveries come home shining with silver; and the moment she is gone out, every body will be in such a delightful hurry about the route that her Ladyship is to give this evening; and they say all the world—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! Prithee stop! I can't wonder if Lady <HI>Bell</HI> shou'd be transported at dropping her weeds, for it seems to have turn'd the heads of the whole family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! dearee, Ma'am, to be sure! for now we shall be so gay! Lady <HI>Bell</HI> has such fine spirits!—And 'tis well she has; for the servants tell me, their old master would have broke her heart else.—They all adore her!—I wish you were a little gayer, Ma'am!—Somehow we are so dull!—'Tis a wonder so young and so pretty a Lady—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't run into impertinence.—I have neither the taste nor talents for public life that Lady <HI>Bell Bloomer</HI> has.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Laws, Ma'am, 'tis all use! <HI>You</HI> are always at home; but Lady <HI>Bell</HI> knows, that wit and a fine person are not given for a fire-side <HI>at home</HI> <STAGE>(drawling).</STAGE> She shines every

evening in half the houses of half-a-dozen parishes, and he next morning we have stanzas in the <HI>Bevy of Beauties,</HI> and sonnets, and billets-doux, and all the fine things that fine Ladies are so fond of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can bear your freedoms no longer!—Carry these flowers with my compliments, and tell her Ladyship I sent to Richmond for them, as I know her fondness for natural bouquets; and bid Harry deny me to every body this morn∣ing, except Mr. <HI>Fitzherbert.</HI></P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter Mr.</HI> FITZHERBERT.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Happily excepted, my dear Ward! But I suppose you heard my step, and threw in my name for a douceur. I can hardly believe, that when you shut your doors on youth and flattery, you would open them to a cross old man, who seldom entertains you with any thing but your faults.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>How you mistake, Sir! You are the greatest flatterer I have: your whole conduct flatters me with esteem, and love; and as you do not <HI>squander</HI> these things—</P>
<STAGE>(smiling)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>There I must correct you.—I do squander them on few objects, indeed; and they are proportionably warmer. I feel àttachments fifty times as strong as your good-humour'd smiling people, who are every one's hum∣ble servant, and every body's friend. Where is Lady <HI>Bell?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet at her toilette, I believe. My dear Sir, I am every hour more grateful to you, for having given me so charming a friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I would have you. When you came from France, I prevailed on her Ladyship to allow you her society, that you might add to the polish of elegant man∣ners the graces of an elegant mind. Here she comes! her tongue and her heels keeping time.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Lady</HI> BELL.</STAGE>
<P>Ay, ay, if all the women in the world were prating young widows, love and gallantry would die away, and our men grow <HI>reasonable</HI> and <HI>discreet.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh you monster! But I am in such divine spirits, that nothing you say can destroy 'em.—My sweet <HI>Julia,</HI> what a bouquet! Lady Myrtle will expire.—She was so envelop'd in flowers and ever-greens last night, that she look'd like the picture of fair Rosamond in her bower.—My dear <HI>Fitz,</HI> do you know we dined yesterday in Hill-street, and had the fortitude to stay till eleven!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was tired to death with the fatiguing visit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, I, on the contrary, came away with fresh relish for society. The persevering civility of Sir Andrew and the maukish insipidity of his tall daughter act like olives: You can't endure them on your palate, but they heighten the gusto of your Tokay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I advise your Ladyship to serve up Sir Andrew and his daughter at your next entertainment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I would, only one can't remove 'em with the dessert. But how do you like me? Did you ever see so delightful a head? Don't you think I shall make a thousand conquests to-day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtless, if you meet with so many fools.—But pray, which of those you have already made, will be the most flattered by all these gay insignia of your liberty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Probably, he whom it least concerns.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray tell us which is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Heavens! to answer that, requires more reflection than I have ever given the subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Should you build a temple to your lovers, I fancy we should find Lord <HI>Sparkle</HI>'s name on the altar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Lord <HI>Sparkle!—</HI>Who can resist the gay, the elegant, the all-conquering Lord <HI>Sparkle?</HI> the most distinguished feather in the plume of fashion—with∣out that barbarous strength of mind which gives impor∣tance to virtues or to vices. Fashionable, because he's well drest:—Brilliant, because he's of the first Clubs, and uses his borrowed wit like his borrowed gold, as tho' it was his own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, now, this man, whom you understand so well, you receive as tho' his tinsel was pure gold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, to be sure!—Tinsel is just as well for shew.—The world is charitable, and accepts tinsel for gold in most cases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>But in the midst of all this sunshine for Lord <HI>Sparkle,</HI> will you not throw a ray on the spirited, modest <HI>Beauchamp?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>A ray of favour for <HI>Beauchamp!—</HI>Were I so inclined, to make it welcome, I must change my fan for a spear, my feathers for a helmet, and stand forth a Thalestris.—You know <HI>his</HI> mistress is War— <STAGE>(sighing, and then reco∣vering).</STAGE>—But why do I trifle thus?—The hour of triumph is at hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>The moment of triumph!<HI>—Anglice,</HI> the mo∣ment when, having shewn myself at half the houses in St. George's, I am set down at St. James's, my fellows stand∣ing on each hand, as I descend—the whisper flying thro' the croud, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Who is she? Who is that sweet creature?—One of the four heiresses?"—"No; she's a foreign am∣bassadress."</Q> —I ascend the stairs—move slowly thro' the rooms—drop my fan—incommode my bouquet—stay to adjust it, that the <HI>little</HI> gentry may have time to fix their admiration—again move on—enter the Drawing-room—throw a flying glance round the Circle, and see nothing but spite in the eyes of the women, and a thousand nameless things in those of the men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very soul of giddiness!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very soul of happiness!—Can I be less?—Think of a widow just emerg'd from her weeds for a hus∣band to whom her <HI>sather,</HI> not her <HI>heart,</HI> united her—my jointure elegant—my figure charming—deny it if you dare!—Pleasure, Fortune, Youth, Health, all opening their stores before me; whilst Innocence and conscious Honour shall be my handmaids, and guide me in safety through the dangerous ordeal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>To your Innocence and conscious Honour add, if you have time <STAGE>(archly),</STAGE> a little Prudence, or your centinels may be surpris'd asleep, and you reduc'd to a disgraceful capitulation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I'm mistress of my whole situation, and cannot be surpris'd.—But, Heav'ns! I am losing a con∣quest every moment I stay!—The Loves and Pleasures have prepared their rosy garlands—my triumphal car is waiting—and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y proud steeds neighing to be gone.—Away to victory!—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exit with great spirit.</STAGE>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I believe her Ladyship's heart is more sensible than she allows to herself. I rally her on Lord <HI>Sparkle,</HI> but it is

Mr. <HI>Beauchamp,</HI> whose name is never mentioned but her cheeks tell such blushing truths, as she wou'd never forgive me for observing.</P>

<P>Be under no apprehensions.—Much as I'm inte∣rested in this union, your inclinations shall be attended to.—I am now going to your lover, and shall introduce him to you this morning.—Come, don't look so distress'd, child, at the approach of that period which will give you <HI>dignity</HI> and <HI>character</HI> in society.—The marriage-state is that in which your sex evinces its importance; and where, in the interesting circle of domestic duties, a woman has room to exercise every virtue that constitutes the Great and the Amiable.</P>

<P>Poh! poh! stay where you are, stay where you are! The great turnpike between Dover and Calais is a road de∣structive to this kingdom; and I wish there were toll-gates erected on its confines, to restrain with a <HI>heavy tax</HI> the number of its travellers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear the <HI>tax</HI> would be more generally felt than the <HI>benefit;</HI> for it would restrain not only the folly-mongers and the fashion-mongers, but the rational enquirer and the travelling connoisseur.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the better! so much the better!—Our travelling philosophers have done more towards destroying the nerves of their country, than all the politics of France.

thing. You used to creep into the parlour, when Father had company, hanging your head like a dead partridge; steal all round the room behind their backs to get at a chair; then sit down on one corner of it, tying knots in your handkerchief; and if any-body drank your health, rise up, and scrape your foot so—"Thank you kindly, Sir!"—</P>

<P>Why, first of all, if you should come into a draw∣ing-room, and find twenty or thirty people in the circle, you are not to take the least notice of any one.</P>

<P>No!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>No!—The servant will, perhaps, give you a chair;—if not, slide into the nearest. The conversation will not be interrupted by your entrance; for they'll take as little notice of you, as you of them.</P>

<P>Then, be sure to be equally indifferent to the coming-in of others.—I saw poor Lady Carmine one night dying with confusion, for the vulgarity and ill∣breeding of her friend, who actually rose from her chair, at the entrance of the Dutchess of Dulcet and Lady Betty Blowze.</P>

—Capital!"—Never mount to a phrase, unless to that dear delightful one, of "all that sort of thing."—The use made of that is wonderful!<HI>—"All that sort of thing,"</HI> is an apology for want of wit; it is a substitute for argu∣ment; it will serve for the point of a story, or the fate of a battle.</P>

<P>You may make her what you will. Treat her with confidence, tenderness, and respect, and she'll be an angel; be morose, suspicious, and neglectful, and she'll be—a woman.—The Wife's character and conduct is a comment on that of the Husband.</P>

<P>Yes, she is my ward, and the daughter of the friend of my youth.—I entertain parental affection for her, and give you the highest proof of my esteem in transferring to <HI>you</HI> the care of her happiness. Refuse it, if you dare.</P>

<P><HI>Where?—</HI>In France.<HI>—When?—</HI>About eight months since.<HI>—How?—</HI>By an English clergyman.<HI>—With whom?—</HI>Ah, with such a one!—Her beauty is of the Greek kind, which pleases the mind more than the eye.—Yet to the eye nothing can be more lovely.—To this charm∣ing creature add the name of <HI>Julia Manners,</HI> and you know my wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Julia Manners! Julia Manners</HI> did you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Julia Manners!</HI> I first knew her at the house of a friend in Paris, whose daughters were in the same con∣vent with herself. I often visited her at the grate; at length, by the assistance of Mademoiselle St. Val, prevailed on her to give me her hand, but was immediately torn from her by a summons from my uncle at Florence; whence I was dispatched to England on a ministerial affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, so, so, very fine! <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE>—I suppose you had the prudence to make yourself acquainted with the Lady's family, before you married her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: her family and fortune are elegant. She has a guardian, whese address the sweet Obstinate refused to give me, that she might herself reveal the marriage;—which I had reasons, however, to request her not to do, till we both arrived in England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you have not seen your bride in England?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no!—My <HI>Julia</HI> is yet in her convent. I have been preparing for her reception in Berkshire, and have written to inform her, that I would meet her at Calais; but I fear my letters have missed her, and shall therefore set out
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
for Paris, to conduct to England the woman who must give the point to all my felicities.</P>

<P>Indifference!—that's the rule.—We love, hate, quarrel, and even fight without suffering our tranquility to be incommoded;—nothing disturbs.—The keenest dis∣cernment will discover nothing particular in the behaviour of <HI>lovers</HI> on the point of marriage, nor in the <HI>married,</HI> whilst the articles of separation are preparing.</P>

<P>Disgustful apathy!—What becomes of the energies of the heart in this wretched system? Does it annihilate your feelings?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no!—I feel, for instance, that I must have Lady <HI>Bell Bloomer,</HI> and I feel curiosity to know her senti∣ments of me, of which, however, I have very little doubt: but all my art can't make her serious; she fences admira∣bly, and keeps me at the length of her foil.—To you she will be less on her guard.</P>

<P>Me I you surprise me, my Lord! How can I be of use in developing her Ladyship's sentiments?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, by sifting them. When you talk of me, see if she blushes. Mention some woman as one▪ whom I

<P><HI>Faults!</HI> Thine is chambermaid's morality, with a vengeance!—What have all my past lessons been thrown away upon thee, Innocence!—Have I not told thee, that the governing passion of the female mind is the rage of being envied? The most generous of them wou'd like to break the hearts of half-a-dozen of their friends, by the preference given to themselves.

<STAGE>(drawling)</STAGE>
<P> For a warning, quotha!—My de∣voirs to Lady <HI>Bell</HI> are of a different kind, and we under∣stand each other. I address <HI>her</HI> for a wife, because she's the fashion; and I address <HI>Julia</HI> for a mistress, because 'tis the fashion to have mistresses from higher orders than semp∣stresses and mantua-makers.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is that your only reason, my Lord, for bribing me so high?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not absolutely. I have a pique against her guardian, who, tho' he has the honour to be related to me, will not suffer me to draw on his banker for a single gui∣nea. His estates, indeed, he can't deprive me of; so as it can do no harm, I'll have the <HI>eclat</HI> of affronting him with spirit.</P>

<P>Oh Gemini! I am glad to hear that! I'd do any thing to plague Mr. <HI>Fitzherbert,</HI> and can go on now with a safe conscience!—He had like to have lost me my place once, because he thought I was flighty;—but I'll be up with him, now.</P>

<P>Now she has a friend, whom I mean at the same time to take for a mistress:—won't that be a stroke, eh!</P>

<P>Decidedly. Your life is made up of strokes! Every thing with you, my Lord, is a hit.</P>

<P>True, true! I detest a regular, mechanical mode of doing things.—Men of sense have one way of getting through life; men of genius, another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtless; and the advantage lies with the men of genius, for to their <HI>genius</HI> are all their faults imputed; nay, their faults are considered as the graceful meanderings of a mind <HI>too ethereal</HI> to be confined to the rules of com∣mon-sense and decorum;—a mighty easy way of building reputation! ha! ha! ha! You are drest with infinite malice to-day, my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Malice! Not at all.—The women now-a-days are neither caught by finery or person!—I am drest for court.—I was going to Westminster; but I hear there is to be a presentation of <HI>Misses</HI> to-day, and I would not for the world lose the dear creatures blushes on their first ap∣pearance; for, 'faith, most of them will never blush again.—Will you go?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis too late to dress: besides, I have devoted this day to adventure. I am rambling through the town, dis∣covering what new stars have appeared in the Galaxy of Beauty during my absence, and a dangerous progress it is! The rays of a pair of black eyes from a chariot in Pall-mall would have annihilated me, had not at the same instant two beautiful blue ones from a window given a fil∣lip to my sinking spirits. A fine-turn'd ancle, whose po∣lish shone thro' its neat silk stocking, encounter'd me in St. James's-street; but I was luckily relieved by a little rosy mouth, that betray'd, with a deceitful smile, teeth most murderously white. A Galatea darted by me on the right, whilst a Helen swam along on the left:—in short, from such sweet besiegers nothing could have preserved me
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
but the sweeter charms of a beloved, though absent fair-one.</P>
<STAGE>(sighing.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, I never trouble my head about absentees!—I love beauty as well as any man; but it must be all in the present tense. Shall I set you down any where? I must go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but I see your writing-things are here. If you'll permit me, I'll pen a short note to <HI>Beauchamp</HI> on bu∣siness I had forgot this morning, and dispatch it by a chairman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure. I penned a note ten minutes since to my steward, to raise the poor devils rents. Upon my soul, I pity 'em! But how can it be otherwise, whilst one is obliged to wear fifty acres in a suit, and the produce of a whole farm in a pair of buckles? Adieu!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the Ladies, as usual, brilliant—nothing so flat as the men! The horrid <HI>English</HI> custom ruins them for conversation. They make themselves members of Clubs, in the way of business; and Members of Parliament, in the way of amusement: all their passions are reserved for the first, and all their wit for the last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis better in Paris.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, 'tis quite another thing! Whilst we auk∣wardly copy the follies of the Parisians, we absurdly omit the charming part of their character. Devoted to elegance, they catch their opinions, their wit, and their bons mots from the mouths of the ladies.—'Tis in the drawing-room of Madame the Dutchess, the Marquis learns his politicks; whilst the sprightly Countess dispenses taste and philosophy to a circle of Bishops, Generals, and Abbés.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>All that may be just; yet I am mistaken, if you have not found <HI>one</HI> Englishman to reconcile you to the manners of the rest. Lord <HI>Sparkle,</HI> for instance—your Ladyship thinks, I'm sure, that <HI>be</HI> has wit at will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes, quite at will!—His wit, like his es∣sence-bottle, is a collection of all that is poignant in a thousand flowers; and, like that, is most useful, when he himself is most insipidly vacant.</P>

<P>Charming Miss <HI>Belmour,</HI> what an enliv'ning in∣timation! Where was your Ladyship on Thursday? You would have found excellent food for your satire at Mrs. <HI>Olio</HI>'s: We had all the Law Ladies from Lincoln's-inn, a dozen gold velvets from Bishopsgate, with the wives and daughters of half the M.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my entertainment was quite as good as yours! We were in Brook-street, at Lady <HI>Lau∣rel</HI>'s, and found her surrounded by her Literati of all de∣nominations.—We had Masters of Art and Misses of Sci∣ence:—on one hand, an Essayist; on the other, a Mora∣list:—there, a Poetaster; here, a Translator:—in that cor∣ner, a Philosopher; in the oth r, a Compiler of Maga∣zines.—Tropes, Epigrams, and Syllogisms flew like sky∣rockets in every direction; 'till the ambition of pre-emi∣nence lighted the flame of controversy, when they gave each other the <HI>lye literary</HI> with infinite spirit and decorum.</P>

<P>Yes, if it will bear a laugh—that's the grand art of conversation. They pretend we are fond of slander; but rob scandal of its laugh, and 'twould soon be banish'd to the second table, for the amusement of butlers and chambermaids.</P>

<P> From the terror of the eye, Madam, and the swiftness of her step, it must be a Deph∣ne. I think Atalanta's head would be more at variance with her feet; and whilst she <HI>flies,</HI> her eye would be invitingly turn'd on her pursuers.</P>

<P>I meant to have given the intelligence softened, but the agitations of my mind make it impracticable; I must, therefore, inform you in one word, Lady <HI>Bell Bloomer</HI>'s choice is made, and that choice has not fallen upon your Lordship.</P>

<P>In my rash flight this morning, my wicked Maid betray'd me into Lord <HI>Sparkle</HI>'s house.—There Mr. <HI>Beau—champ</HI> snatch'd me from ruin, and gave me a momentary asylum in his lodgings.</P>

<P>At the moment he left Paris for Florence, you re∣ceived my directions to return home: thus <HI>Belville</HI>'s letters miss'd you, and he remain'd ignorant that you were in London.</P>

<P>Value! Why, of just as much as it would bring! You thought it so valuable then, that you got me a hun∣dred extra votes on the strength of it; and you are now a little ungrateful wretch, to pretend 'twas worth nothing.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, very trifling! only the right of a Husband—The Lady so honour'd by your love-making <HI>in jest</HI> is my wife; in course, all obligations to her devolve on me.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your wife! My dear <HI>Belville,</HI> I give you joy with all my soul! You see 'tis always dangerous to keep secrets from your friends. But is any body else coming? Have I any new crimes to be accus'd of? Any more witnesses coming to the bar?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but I am a witness in a new cause, and accuse you of loading the mind of my friend <HI>Beauchamp</HI> with a sense of obligation you had neither spirit or justice to confer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell</SPEAKER>
<P>A Commission, my Lord, which was sent Mr. <HI>Beauchamp</HI> under a blank cover, by one who could not bear to see his noble spirit dependent on your caprices.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when his sentiments pointed out your Lord∣ship as his benefactor, you accepted the honour, and have laid heavy taxes on his gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what is there in all that? <HI>Beauchamp</HI> did not know to whom he was obliged; and wou'dn't it have been a most unchristian thing to let a good action run about the world belonging to nobody?—I found it a stray orphan, and so father'd it.—But you, <HI>Fitzherbert,</HI> I see are the lawful owner of the brat; so prithee take it back, and thank me for the honour of my patronage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your affected pleasantry, Lord <HI>Sparkle,</HI> may shield you from resentment, but it will not from contempt. Your effrontery—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Effrontery! Prithee make distinctions!—What in certain lines would be effrontery, in me is only the ease of Fashion; that delightful thing, which enables me at this moment to stand serene amidst your meditated storm.—
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
Come, my dear Lady <HI>Bell,</HI> let us leave these good gentry, and love ourselves amidst the delights of fashion, and the charms of <HI>bon ton.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, my Lord! As caprice is absolutely necessary to the character of a fine lady, you will not be surpris'd if I give an instance of it now; and, spite of your elegance, your fashion, and your wit, present my hand to this poor soldier—who boasts only worth, spirit, honour, and love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have a care, Madam!—Feelings like mine are not to be trifled with! Once already the hopes you have inspir'd—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>The hour of <HI>trifling</HI> is past; and surely it can∣not appear extraordinary, that I prefer the internal worth of an uncorrupted heart, to the outward polish of a mind too feeble to support itself against vice, in the seductive forms of fashionable dissipation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey-dey! what, is your Ladyship in the plot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>The plot has been deeper laid than you, my Lord, have been able to conceive. As I have the misfortune to be related to you, I thought it my duty to watch over your conduct. I have seen your plans, which generally tended to your confusion and disgrace; and many of them have been defeated, tho' you knew not by what means. But what fate does your Lordship design for these young people, de∣coy'd by you from their native ignorance and home?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let them return to their native ignorance and home as fast as they can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pend.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; hang me if I do that!—I know Life now, and Life I'll have—Hyde-Park, Plays, Operas, and all that sort of thing.—But, Old Gentleman, as you pro∣mis'd to do something for me, what think ye of a Commis∣sion?—The Captain there can't want his now; suppose you turn it over to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, young man, you shall be taken care of; but the requisites of a soldier are not those of pertness and as∣surance. Intrepid spirit, nice honour, generosity, and un∣derstanding, all unite to form him.—It is these which will make a British soldier once again the first character in Eu∣rope.—It is such soldiers who must make England once again invincible, and her glittering arms triumphant in every quarter of the globe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Bobby</HI> may do as he will—I'll go back to Cornwall directly, and warn all my neighbours to take spe∣cial
<PB N="54" REF="57"/>
care how they trust to a Lord's promises at an Election again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, great attempts and great failings mark the life of a man of spirit!—There is eclat even in my disap∣pointment to-night; and I am ready for a fresh set of ad∣ventures to-morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Incorrigible man!—But I have done with <HI>you.—Beauchamp</HI> has answered all my hopes, and the discernment of this charming woman, in rewarding him, merits the hap∣piness that awaits her; and that I may give the fullest sanc∣tion to her choice, I declare <HI>him</HI> heir to my estate. This, I know, is a stroke your Lordship did not expect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauch.</SPEAKER>
<P>And was it then to you, Sir!—The tumults of my gratitude—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your conduct has compleatly rewarded me; and in adopting you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(interrupting)</STAGE>
<P> Oh, I protest against that!—Our union would then appear a prudent, sober business, and I should lose the credit of having done a mad thing for the sake of the man—my heart prefers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>To you I resign him with pleasure: his fate is in your hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he shall continue a soldier—one of those whom Love and his Country detain to guard her dearest, <HI>last</HI> possessions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love and my Country! Yes, ye shall divide my heart!—Animated by such passions, our forefathers were invincible; and if we wou'd preserve the freedom and independence they obtain'd for us, we must imitate their virtues.</P>
