<P>YOUR title to the <HI>matrimonial prize</HI> of DUN∣MOW PRIORY, is admitted by the general voice, without the formality of the claim; and therefore I have presumed to lay it at your feet. Humble as the offering is, it carries with it the never-fading wreathe of CONJUGAL VIRTUE, which in our own isle gives lustre to a <HI>Diadem</HI>—and therefore cannot be unacceptable to any branch of the illustrious house of NORTHUMBERLAND.</P>

Perhaps, even now, when by the custom of my manor, I am about to reward the love and constancy of this happy pair, my own poor girl may be the wife of an unfeeling tyrant, and the child of penury, on a foreign shore! Why
<PB N="3" REF="8" MS="y"/>
did I, in the bitterness of my wrath, refuse to see her?—But then was there not a provocation?—To elope to France! and that with a young rake of an officer whom I never beheld!—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Tipple.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your servant, your worship!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Just.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Tipple, what news have you brought?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only, that all's done as your worship or∣dered—Fooh! fooh! how woundly hot it is this morning! My mouth is so parch'd, and my throat so dry!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Just.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Smiling.]</STAGE> The old hint for a morning draught! Eh, Tipple?—Here, William, bring a tankard of strong beer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! your worship's a sensible kind of a body: you can see the wants of a poor man with half an eye, and loves to relieve 'em—but as for your neighbour, Dr. Stingy, our Wicar, I never see the man that could tell, whether he brew'd with pale malt or brown; and that's a monstrous shame for a clargyman!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Servant, with a Tankard.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Just.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, take your liquor, Tipple, and you'll proceed the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tip.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[After drinking.]</STAGE> The rich don't want it: but it does mend a poor man's spirits sure enough.—Well then, your worship, the Flitch is hung up on the arm of the old oak, and a choice one it is! 'twas one of the last litter of the old carroty sow; it weighs twenty stone at least, and better stuff ne∣did man stick knife into.—Oh! and Nat Putty, the glazier, too, has finished painting the names of the
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
candidates upon the stocks, according to the canon law of the manor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Just.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's all very well. You must now go and find out my brother, the Major, and tell him, I shall be glad of his company to dinner, notwith∣standing our little pet this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tip.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will, your worship: but I am glad his honour, the Major, is not to be <HI>jocum tenus</HI> for your worship, he's so much upon the roguish order with the women, now and ten. I did not care to men∣tion it to your worship before; but as true as I'm alive he was a little rombustical to our Bridget, no longer ago than last Sunday was se'night, as she was coming home from church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Just.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, no doubt, for his head runs of nothing else but fighting and wenching from morning to night; though he'll meet with his match one day or other, take my word for it. But it's a little strange, methinks, Tipple, that in the course of so many centuries, no couple of our own family should have claimed this matrimonial honor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mayhap, your worship, they thought their own bacon too fat for 'em, and would not sit easy on their stomachs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Just.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it should seem, Tipple; <STAGE>[Smiling.]</STAGE>—well, do you hear any thing of the happy couple, who, or what they are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tip.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, your worship.—My wife Bridget thinks as how they been Londoners; now, for my part, I takes it to be a Lord and his spouse; such a mort of folk have been flocking from all parts to see 'em, and such a woundly sight of chaiseses, and fine cat∣tle, been come to the Red Cow and Green Man al∣ready—Oh! I'm certain it must be a lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Just.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, that can't be!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not, your worship?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Just.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because, these are not the days, Tipple, for coronets and conjugal affection to take a trip toge∣ther to <HI>Dunmow Priory;</HI> besides, the lady has de∣sired the privilege of being veiled, a modest sign, seldom or never to be found among the great folks, Tipple, depend on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Modest! not they, efecks! they'd sooner stare poor folk out of countenance, than give 'em any thing.</P>

<P>Well said, Tipple! A pretty correct por∣trait of our modern peerage!</P>

<P>None in the world, Sir. His worship want∣ed much to know who the couple were; but he seemed satisfied at last, when I told him, they de∣sired it might be kept a secret; and has consented, that you, Madam, should appear veil'd before him, not to put your modesty to the blush.</P>

<P>If that's all your fear, make yourself per∣fectly easy; for a little plot has just struck me, that cannot fail, I think, to operate effectually upon him, if I understand his character at all, in which you must not only assist, without a murmur, but act a principal part. <STAGE>[<HI>To</HI> Eliza.</STAGE></P>

<P>Why, I must confess, I do not see any great difficulty in effecting this—for the Major is a hungry fish, that rises at every fly, and if I can mu∣ster up spirits enough, I don't fear but I should be able to hook him.</P>

<P>I have proved it, Sir, by the most solemn of all appeals; nor would it raise your admiration a moment, if you knew the man, for whose love I re∣nounced, for a time, the protection of so indulgent a parent.</P>

<P>As our mutual attachment qualified us in every respect for the matrimonial prize of <HI>Dunmow Priory,</HI> we flattered ourselves, that when our claim was admitted, we might plead it in extenuation of our error, and hope for your forgiveness.</P>
