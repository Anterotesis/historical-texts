<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Lordship,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS it's an Establish'd Custom in these latter Ages, for all Writers, particularly the Poetical, to shelter their Productions under the Protection of the most Distinguish'd, whose Approbation pro∣duces a kind of Inspiration, much superior to that which the <HI>Heathenish</HI> Poets pretended to derive from their Fictitious <HI>Apollo:</HI> So it was my Ambition to Address one of my weak Performances to Your Lord∣ship, who, by Universal Consent, are justly allow'd to be the best Judge of all kinds of Writing.</P>
<P>I was indeed at first deterr'd from my Design, by a Thought that it might be accounted unpardonable Rudeness to obtrude a Trifle of this Nature to a Person, whose sublime Wisdome moderates that Council, which at this Critical Juncture, over-rules the Fate of all <HI>Europe.</HI> But then I was encourag'd by Reflecting, that <HI>Lelius</HI> and <HI>Scipio,</HI> the two greatest Men in their
<PB REF="3"/>
Time, among the <HI>Romans,</HI> both for Political and Military Virtues, in the height of their important Af∣fairs, thought the Perusal and Improving of <HI>Terence</HI>'s Comedies the noblest way of unbinding their Minds. I own I were guilty of the highest Vanity, should I presume to put my Composures in Parallel with those of that Celebrated <HI>Dramatist;</HI> But then again, I hope that Your Lordship's native Goodness and Generosi∣ty, in Condescention to the Taste of the Best and Fairest part of the Town, who have been pleas'd to be diverted by the following SCENES, will excuse and overlook such Faults as your nicer Judgment might discern.</P>
<P>And here, my Lord, the Occasion seems fair for me to engage in a Panegyrick upon those Natural and Acquired Abilities, which so brightly Adorn your Person: But I shall resist that Temptation, being conscious of the Inequality of a Female Pen to so Masculine an Attempt; and having no other Ambition than to Subscribe my self,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Author of TUNBRIDGE-WALKS.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THO' modern Prophets were expos'd of late,</L>
<L>The Author cou'd not Prophesy his Fate:</L>
<L>If with such Scenes an Audience had been fir'd,</L>
<L>The Poet must have really been Inspir'd.</L>
<L>But these, alas! are Melancholy Days</L>
<L>For Modern Prophets and for Modern Plays.</L>
<L>Yet since Prophetick Lyes please Fools o' Fashion,</L>
<L>And Women are so fond of Agitation;</L>
<L>To Men of Sense I'll Prophesy anew,</L>
<L>And tell you wond'rous things that will prove true;</L>
<L><HI>Undaunted Colonels will to Camps repair,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Assur'd, there'll be no Skirmishes this Year;</HI></L>
<L>On our own Terms will flow the wish'd-for Peace,</L>
<L>All Wars, except 'twixt Man and Wife, will cease.</L>
<L>The Grand Monarch may wish his Son a Throne,</L>
<L>But hardly will advance to lose his own.</L>
<L>This Season most things bear a smiling Face;</L>
<L>But Play'rs in Summer have a dismal Case,</L>
<L>Since your Appearance only is our Act of Grace.</L>
<L>Court Ladies will to Country Seats be gone,</L>
<L>My Lord can't all the Year live Great in Town;</L>
<L>Where wanting <HI>Opera's, Basset,</HI> and a <HI>Play,</HI></L>
<L>They'll sigh, and stitch a Gown, to pass the time away.</L>
<L>Gay City-Wives at <HI>Tunbridge</HI> will appear,</L>
<L>Whose Husbands long have labour'd for an Heir;</L>
<L>Where many a Courtier may their Wants relieve,</L>
<L>But by the Waters only they Conceive.</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>
The <HI>Fleet-street</HI> Sempstress—Toast of <HI>Temple</HI> Sparks,</L>
<L>That runs Spruce Neckcloths for Attorney's Clerks;</L>
<L>At <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Gardens will her Hours regale,</L>
<L>Sing fair <HI>Dorinda,</HI> and drink Bottl'd Ale.</L>
<L>At all Assemblies Rakes are up and down.</L>
<L>And Gamesters, where they think they are not known.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shou'd I denounce our Author's Fate to Day,</L>
<L>To cry down Prophecies, you'd damn the Play:</L>
<L>Yet Whims like these have sometimes made you Laugh,</L>
<L>'Tis Tattling all, like <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since War and Places claim the Bards that write,</L>
<L>Be kind and bear a Woman's Treat to Night;</L>
<L>Let your Indulgence all her Fears allay,</L>
<L>And none but Woman-Haters damn this Play.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN me you see one <HI>Busie-Body</HI> more;</L>
<L>Tho' you may have enough of one before.</L>
<L>With Epilogues, the <HI>Busie-Body</HI>'s Way,</L>
<L>We strive to help, but sometimes mar a Play.</L>
<L>At this mad Sessions, half condemn'd e'er try'd,</L>
<L>Some, in three Days, have been turn'd off, and dy'd.</L>
<L>In spight of Parties, their Attempts are vain,</L>
<L>For like false Prophets, they ne'er rise again.</L>
<L>Too late, when cast, your Favour one beseeches,</L>
<L>And Epilogues prove Execution-Speeches.</L>
<L>Yet sure I spy no <HI>Busie-Bodies</HI> here,</L>
<L>And one may pass since they do ev'ry where.</L>
<L>Sowr Criticks Time and Breath and Censures waste,</L>
<L>And baulk your Pleasures to refine your Taste.</L>
<L>One busie Don ill-tim'd high Tenets Preaches,</L>
<L>Another yearly shows himself in Speeches.</L>
<L>Some snivling Cits would have a Peace for spight,</L>
<L>To starve those Warriors who so bravely fight.</L>
<L>Still of a Foe upon his Knees afraid,</L>
<L>Whose well-bang'd Troops want Money, Heart and Bread.</L>
<L>Old Beaux, who none, not ev'n themselves can please,</L>
<L>Are busie still, for nothing—but to teize</L>
<L>The Young; so busie to engage a Heart;</L>
<L>The Mischief done, are busy most to part.</L>
<L>Ungrateful Wretches, who still cross one's Will,</L>
<L>When they more kindly might be busie still!</L>
<L>One to a Husband, who ne'er dreamt of Horns,</L>
<L>Shows how dear Spouse with Friend his Brows adorns.</L>
<L>Th' Officious Tell-tale Fool (he shou'd repent it)</L>
<L>Parts three kind Souls that liv'd at Peace contented.</L>
<L>Some with Law-Quirks set <HI>Houses</HI> by the Ears.</L>
<L>With Physick one what he would heal impairs.</L>
<L>Like that dark mob'd up Fry, that neighb'ring Curse,</L>
<L>Who to remove Love's Pains bestow a worse.</L>
<L>Since then this medling Tribe infest the Age,</L>
<L>Bear one awhile expos'd upon the Stage.</L>
<L>Let none but <HI>Busie-Bodies</HI> vent their Spight,</L>
<L>And with good Humour Pleasure crown the Night.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>HA! Sir <HI>George Airy!</HI> A Birding thus early, what forbidden Game rouz'd you so soon? For no lawful Occasion cou'd invite a Person of your Figure abroad at such unfashionable Hours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are some Men, <HI>Charles,</HI> whom Fortune has left free from Inquietudes, who are diligently studious to find out Ways and Means to make themselves uneasie.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible that any thing in Nature can ruffle the Temper of a Man, whom the four Seasons of the Year com∣pliment with as many thousand Pounds, nay! and a Father at Rest with his Ancestors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why there 'tis now! a Man that wants Money thinks none can be unhappy that has it; but my Affairs are in such a whimsical Posture, that it will require a Calculation of my Nativity to find if my Gold will relieve me or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha, never consult the Stars about that; Gold has a Power beyond them; Gold unlocks the Midnight Coun∣cils; Gold out-does the Wind, becalms the Ship, or fills her Sails; Gold is omnipotent below; it makes whole Armies fight, or fly; it buys even Souls, and bribes the Wretches to
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
betray their Country: Then what can thy Business be, that Gold won't serve thee in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I'm in Love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>In Love!—Ha, ha, ha, ha; In Love, Ha, ha, ha, with what, prithee, a <HI>Cherubin?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, with a Woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Woman, Good, Ha, ha, ha, and Gold not help thee?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose I'm in Love with two—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, if thou'rt in Love with two hundred, Gold will fetch 'em, I warrant thee, Boy. But who are they? who are they? come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>One is a Lady whose Face I never saw, but witty as an Angel; the other beautiful as <HI>Venus—</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a Fool—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>For ought I know, for I never spoke to her, but you can inform me; I am charm'd by the Wit of One, and dye for the Beauty of the Other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, which are you in Quest of now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I prefer the Sensual Pleasure, I'm for her I've seen, who is thy Father's Ward, <HI>Miranda.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, then I pity you; for the Jew my Father will no more part with her, and 30000 Pound, than he wou'd with a Guinea to keep me from starving.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you see Gold can't do every thing, <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, for 'tis her Gold that bars my Father's Gate a∣gainst you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if he is this avaricious Wretch, how cam'st thou by such a liberal Education?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a Souse out of his Pocket, I assure you? I had an Uncle who defray'd that Charge, but for some little Wild∣nesses of Youth, tho' he made me his Heir, left Dad my Guar∣dian till I came to Years of Discretion, which I presume the old Gentleman will never think I am; and now he has got the Estate into his Clutches, it does me no more good, than if it lay in <HI>Prester John</HI>'s Dominions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can'st thou find no Stratagem to redeem it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have made many Essays to no purpose; tho' Want, the Mistress of Invention, still tempts me on, yet still the old Fox is too cunning for me—I am upon my last Project, which if it fails, then for my last Refuge, a Brown Musquet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is't, can I assist thee?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not yet, when you can, I have Confidence enough in you to ask it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am always ready, but what do's he intend to do with <HI>Miranda?</HI> Is she to be sold in private? or will he put her up by way of Auction, at who bids most? If so, Egad, I'm for him; my Gold, as you say, shall be subservient to my Pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>To deal ingenuously with you, Sir <HI>George,</HI> I know very little of Her, or Home; for since my Uncle's Death, and my Return from Travel, I have never been well with my Father; he thinks my Expences too great, and I his Allowance too little; he never sees me, but he quarrels; and to avoid that, I shun his House as much as possible. The Report is, he intends to marry her himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can she consent to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes faith, so they say; but I tell you, I am wholly ignorant of the matter. <HI>Miranda</HI> and I are like two violent Members of a contrary Party; I can scarce allow her Beauty, tho' all the World do's; nor she me Civility, for that Con∣tempt: I fancy she plays the Mother-in-law already, and sets the old Gentleman on to do mischief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I've your free Consent to get her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay and my helping-hand, if occasion be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pugh, yonder's a Fool coming this way, let's avoid him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>What <HI>Marplot,</HI> no no, he's my Instrument; there's a thousand Conveniencies in him, he'll lend me his Money when he has any, run of my Errands and be proud on't; in short, he'll Pimp for me, Lye, for me, Drink for me, do any thing but fight for me, and that I trust to my own Arm for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay then he's to be endur'd; I never knew his Qualifications before.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><PB N="4" REF="11"/>Enter <HI>Marplot</HI> with a Patch cross his Face.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marpl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Charles,</HI> your's,—Ha! Sir <HI>George Airy,</HI> the Man in the World, I have an Ambition to be known to
<STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE>
Give me thy Hand, dear Boy—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>A good Assurance! But hark ye, how came your Beautiful Countenance clouded in the wrong place?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marpl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess 'tis a little <HI>Mal-a-propos,</HI> but no mat∣ter for that; a Word with you, <HI>Charles;</HI> Prithee, introduce me to Sir <HI>George—</HI>he is a Man of Wit, and I'd give ten Guineas to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you have 'em you mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marpl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, when I have 'em; pugh, pox, you cut the Thread of my Discourse—I wou'd give ten Guineas, I say, to be rank'd in his Acquaintance: Well, 'tis a vast Addition to a Man's Fortune, according to the Rout of the World, to be seen in the Company of Leading Men; for then we are all thought to be Politicians, or Whigs, or Jacks, or High-Flyers, or Low-Flyers, or Levellers—and so forth; for you must know, we all herd in Parties now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then a Fool for Diversion is out of Fashion, I find.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marpl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, without it be a mimicking Fool, and they are Darlings every where; but prithee introduce me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, on Condition you'll give us a true Account how you came by that Mourning Nose, I will.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I honour Men of the Sword; and I presume this Gentleman is lately come from <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Portugal—</HI>by his Scars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marpl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No really, Sir <HI>George,</HI> mine sprung from civil Fury, happening last Night into the Groom-Porters—I had a strong Inclination to go ten Guineas with a sort of a, sort of a—kind of a Milk Sop, as I thought: A Pox of the Dice, he flung out, and my Pockets being empty, as <HI>Charles</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
knows they sometimes are, he prov'd a surly <HI>North-Britain,</HI> and broke my Face for my Deficiency.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! and did not you draw?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marpl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Draw, Sir, why, I did but lay my Hand upon my Sword to make a swift Retreat, and he roar'd out. Now the Deel a Ma sol, Sir, gin ye touch yer Steel, Ise whip mine through yer Wem.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha,</P>

<P>Ha, ha, ha, ha, safe was the Word, so you walk'd off, I suppose</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marpl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, for I avoid fighting, purely to be serviceable to my Friends you know—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Friends are much oblig'd to you, Sir, I hope you'll rank me in that Number.</P>

<P>No, no, prithee let me alone to tell the Ladies—my Parts—can you convey a Letter upon Occasion, or deliver a Message with an Air of Business, Ha!</P>

<P>What, my Sister <HI>Ward?</HI> Why, her Guardian is mine, we are Fellow Sufferers: Ah! he is a covetous, cheat∣ing, sanctify'd Curmudgeon; that Sir <HI>Francis Gripe</HI> is a damn'd old—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose, Friend, you forget that he is my Father—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marpl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ask your Pardon, <HI>Charles,</HI> but it is for your sake I hate him. Well, I say, the World is mistaken in him, his Out side Piety, makes him every Man's Executor, and his In∣side Cunning, makes him every Heir's Jaylor. Egad, <HI>Charles,</HI> I'm half persuaded that thou'rt some <HI>Ward</HI> too, and never of

<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Dog is Diverting sometimes, or there wou'd be no enduring his Impertinence: He is pressing to be employ'd and willing to execute, but some ill Fate generally attends all he undertakes, and he oftner spoils an Intreague than helps it—</P>

<P>If I miscarry 'tis none of my Fault, I follow my Instructions.</P>

<P>Pish, Pox, that was an Accident.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was it, prithee?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you must know, I had lent a certain Merchant my hunting Horses, and was to have met his Wife in his Ab∣sence: Sending him alone with my Groom to make the Com∣plement, and to deliver a Letter to the Lady at the same time; what does he do, but gives the Husband the Letter, and offers her the Horses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marpl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember you was even with me, for you deny'd the Letter to be yours, and swore I had a design upon her, which my Bones paid for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Sir <HI>George,</HI> let's walk round, if you are not ingag'd, for I have sent my Man upon a little earnest Busi∣ness, and I have order'd him to bring me the Answer into the Park.</P>

<P>Business, and I not know it, Egad I'll watch him.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Madam, your Ladiship can't imagine what a wretched Disappointment we have met with: Just as I had fetch'd a Suit of my Cloaths for a Disguise, comes my old Master into his Closet, which is right against her Chamber-Door; this struck us into a terrible Fright—At length I put on a grave Face, and ask'd him if he was at leisure for his Chocolate, in hopes to draw him out of his Hole; but he snap'd my Nose off; No, I shall be busie here this two Hours; at which my poor Mistress seeing no way of Escape, order'd me to wait on your Ladiship with the sad Relation.</P>

<SPEAKER>Patch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Madam, it's his living so long in <HI>Spain,</HI> he vows he'll spend half his Estate, but he'll be a Parliament-Man, on purpose to bring in a Bill for Women to wear Veils, and the other odious <HI>Spanish</HI> Customs—He swears it is the height of Impudence to have a Woman seen bare-fac'd even at Church, and scarce believes there's a true begotten Child in the City.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha, how the old Fool torments himself! Suppose he could introduce his rigid Rules—does he think we could not match them in Contrivance? No, no; Let the Tyrant Man make what Laws he will, if there's a Wo∣man under the Government, I warrant she finds a way to break 'em: Is his Mind set upon the <HI>Spaniard</HI> for his Son-in-law still?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and he expects him by the next Fleet, which drives his Daughter to Melancholy and Despair: But, Ma∣dam, I find you retain the same gay, cheerful Spirit you had, when I waited on your Ladiship.—My Lady is mighty good humour'd too; and I have found a way to make Sir <HI>Jealousie</HI> believe I am wholly in his Interest, when my real Design is to serve her; he makes me her Jaylor, and I set her at Li∣berty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miran.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew thy Prolifick Brain wou'd be of singular Ser∣vice to her, or I had not parted with thee to her Father.</P>

<P>That's not absolutely necessary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought it was only the old strain, coaxing him still for your own, and railing at all the young Fellows about Town: In my Mind, now, you are as ill plagu'd with your Guardian, Madam, as my Lady is with her Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miran.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I have Liberty, Wench, that she wants; what would she give now to be in this <HI>dissabilee,</HI> in the—open Air, nay more, in pursuit of the young Fellow she likes, for that's my Case, I assure thee.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>In good truth—I will not, for I knew thy Fa∣ther, he was a hearty wary Man, and I cannot consent that his Son should squander away what he sav'd, to no purpose.</P>

Ha? gone! The Devil, jilted? Why, what a Tale has she invent∣ed—of <HI>Paris,</HI> Balls, and Birth-Days.—Egad I'd give Ten Guineas to know who this Gipsie is.—A Curse of my Folly—I deserve to lose her; what Woman can forgive a Man that turns his Back.</P>
