<P>Ay, but what if I know against my will? I dream'd such a dream last night about bride-cake drawn through a gold ring, throwing the stocking, whip sullabbubs, sweethearts, and pin-cushions, that I thinks, as how, I am in love with you.</P>

<P>She's handsome enough without—but now you talk of that, master Amaranthus, if every fool was to wear such a cap, would not it cause rare trade for bell∣makers—I can't help laughing to think how many great folks, who seldom say more than aye, or no, would then make a very considerable noise—How many pulpits would then ring almost as loud as the church steeple, and how many physicians would toll the knell of those patients they had kill'd.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>HOW goes the day, Register?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>REGISTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Both sun and clocks agree, that it approacheth the mid hour, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Register, tho' you have been my clerk some time, yet I don't recollect ever telling you how I came to the dignity of marriage-licencer for this district.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>REGISTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Worship never did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I travelled much—not like many modern travellers to go out a fool, and return a coxcomb—not to discover useless countries, or pick up unintelligible cu∣riosities, but to study mankind east, west, north, and south.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>REGISTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then no doubt your Worship has seen wonderful strange things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, strange enough—in France I found light hearts with empty pockets—in Italy much religion, with little morality—in Spain indolent pride, with wretched po∣verty—in Germany great courage, small sobriety—and in Holland strict oeconomy, with pitiful spirit—but of all places, Great Britain produces the most singular and extensive variety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>REGISTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what may that be, your Worship?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why a wonderful mixture of good sense and folly; industry, and extravagance; discontent and negligence; place-hunting and patriotism; elegance and frippery; plenty and want; selfishness and humanity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>REGISTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surprising mixtures in truth, Sir Gregory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="27"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then, Register, they have a favourite amongst them, called <HI>fashion,</HI> almost as changeable as their cli∣mate—One month their men stride forth with such closs trimm'd skirts, that they resemble so many curlews, all legs and no bodies; the next they are so lengthened, that <HI>petit maitres</HI> waddle forth like ducks, all bodies and no legs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>REGISTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>At that rate, Sir Gregory, one can't be sure of know∣ing an acquaintance three months together—Do they marry there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, they have the word, marriage, and a cere∣mony amongst them; but mutual inclination is seldom consulted—This makes a place, they call <HI>Doctors Com∣mons,</HI> thrive vastly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>REGISTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what do they do there, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GREGORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Divorce—that is, unmarry those couples who are tired of one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>REGISTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know, your Worship, whether such a shop would not have pretty business here.</P>

<P>So please your Worship, he courted me full three months; and because, as how, I would not have him, he first threatened to put himself away with a pistol, then with a rope, then with a razor, and last of all in the mill-pond: he frighten'd me, that's for sure, as thinking how his ghost might haunt me; but all would not do, till he proved first of all my sweethearts that came into my father's house last May-day morning—besides, that very self same night, a snail wrote the first letters of his name on our pantry-wall; so, your Worship, thinking, as how, he was fated for me, I consented.</P>

<P>Mayhap not—your eyes look well enough—but what then? Though my grand-mother was as blind as a beetle, you might see your face in her dark peepers—But, master Cupid, suppose you was to lend me your bow and arrows, I could knock down half a dozen yel∣low hammers in a trice—and that would be rare sport, I can tell you.</P>

<SPEAKER>CUPID.</SPEAKER>
<P>My shafts are of more importance and danger than to be trusted in such hands as yours—Look not all so amazed, nor wonder that you have been turn'd topsy∣turvy—Psyche's cruelty forced me to throw this con∣fusion among ye; but a dispatch by one of my mother Ve∣nus's doves having brought me favourable advices, you shall all come right at last.</P>
