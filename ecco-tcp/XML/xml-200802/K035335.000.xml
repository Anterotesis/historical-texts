<HEAD>DEDICATION. TO SOAME JENYNS, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I lately read your Disquisition on Government and Civil Liberty, it gave me much concern to find, that you had not written it in verse. Such images and such sentiments, such wit and such arguments, were surely too good to be wasted on prose. And you who have written verse so long, and with so much facility, are highly inexcusable for not having employed that talent on so important an occasion as the present, when you had taken upon you to confute <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"so many absurd principles con∣cerning government and liberty, which have of <HI>late</HI> been disse∣minated with unusual industry,"</Q>principles, let, me add, which were still more industriously disseminated at the Revolution by Locke, at the Accession by Hoadly, and a hundred years before either, by Hooker; <Q REND="margQuotes">"principles, which you say, are as false, as mischievous, as inconsistent with common sense, as with all hu∣man society, and which require nothing more than to be fairly stated, to be refuted."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5"/>
The pious poet, Herbert, I think tells us, that</P>
<Q>"A verse may catch him, who a sermon flies."</Q>
<P>Why then should you discard verse, when you intended to catch such careless readers, as would be apt to fly a sermon? Why, by dividing your discourse into five methodical heads, should you make it appear as formal as the gravest pulpit-lecture ever deli∣vered by old bishop Beveridge, or young Bishop Bagot? I protest, Mr. Jenyns, I cannot account for this strange proceeding.</P>
<P>However, that such sort of readers may read you, I have attempted to do that for your benefit and theirs, which you would not do for them, or for yourself: and, unequal as I am to the task, have drest up your two first, and, as I think, principal topics, in as easy and fashionable metre as I was capable of wri∣ting. I know you would have done this much better. But, as my work is but a fragment, I am not without my hopes, that what I have done may be a spur to your indolence, and that you may be tempted not only to correct, but complete it.</P>
<P>But when I say that I have versified you, I take a pride in boasting, that I am not your mere versifier. I take a pleasure too in owning, that you yourself led me to attempt a nobler species of composition. I had read, some years ago, your very delectable Eclogue of the 'Squire and the Parson, written on occasion of that glorious peace, the honour of making which, is to be inscribed one day (may it be a late one!) on the mausoleum of the Earl of Bute. This, Sir, led me to think of giving my present performance a dramatic cast, so far as an eclogue can
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
possess that title. On this idea, having resolved to make you my TITYRUS, I had not far to seek for a MELIBAEUS. A bro∣ther writer, who has of late endeavoured to disseminate principles, similar to some of yours, with unusual, though abortive industry, immediately occurred to my imagination. And as immediately I resolved to read his more elaborate treatise, in order to enable me to execute my plan with greater exactitude, and better pre∣servation of sentiment and character.</P>
<P>Although I must own, that this exercitation of my patience cost me many a yawn, yet I found, to my great satisfaction, that this writer allowed for true, what you hold to be false, those two first principles of Mr. Locke, that men are equal, and that men are free <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Tucker on Government,</HI> ch. 1st.</NOTE>. I concluded, therefore, that he was a very pro∣per person to dispute those points with you. Accordingly, with∣out farther ceremonial, I set you both down, not indeed sub tegmine fagi, but, for the sake of the <HI>costumé,</HI> in a snug town coffee-house, and there entered you fairly into debate.</P>
<P>If on your part, Sir, I have ever done more than elucidated any of those assertions, which you call arguments, I humbly ask your pardon: and on the Dean's, if <HI>I have made him a little too lively and spiritual,</HI> I as humbly ask his. I know nothing does so much harm to an ecclesiastic, in the road of perferment, as the bare suspicion of being witty. But, as the Divine in question has long been a dean, and has sworn that he will never be a bishop, I hope no great harm is done.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7"/>
That you may long remain on the illustrious List of Pen∣sioners, even after the useful Board, from which you derive that right, shall be no more; that, having changed from Tory to Whig in the ministry of the Duke of Newcastle, from Whig to Tory under those, or rather <HI>that</HI> of Lords Bute and North, you may now again change from Tory to Whig under the New Administration;—and (since we have it on very eloquent evi∣dence, that it is now the fashion for persons of the greatest con∣sequence to be <HI>no longer in shackles)</HI> that you may soon cease to be encumbered with your present slavish principles, is the sin∣cere and fervent wish of,</P>

<L>I controvert those five positions,</L>

Of civil rule and liberty;</L>
<L>That men are equal born—and free—</L>

Their parents have a sort of rule and jurisdiction over them, when they come into the world, and for some time after; but it is but a temporary one.

<L>The boy is born and educated;</L>
<L>And now he walks the world at large;</L>
<L>Yet has he got a free discharge?</L>
<L>No; <HI>volens nolens,</HI> as at school,</L>
<L N="200">He still must yield to civil rule;</L>
<L>A subject born, he's subject still,</L>
<L>Not govern'd by his mere self-will;</L>

<L>Or kills his man, or steals a horse,</L>

<L>Perhaps she might. Then let's suppose</L>
<L N="220">To some unpeopled isle he goes,</L>
<L>And takes a mistress in his sleeve,</L>
<L>To live as Adam did with Eve;</L>
<L>Or say, that he had luck to find</L>
<L>A hundred more of the same mind,</L>
<L N="225">To migrate with their mates by dozens,</L>
<L>And there to live like cater-cousins,</L>
<L>We will not call them sirs, and madams,</L>
<L>But a cool hundred Eves and Adams;</L>
<L>I think they would, or soon, or late,</L>
<L N="230">By <HI>quasi-compact</HI> found a state. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here the Dean turns aside to his own ingenious hypothesis, which he makes the true basis of civil government, and which, the more to disseminate it, I shall here briefly explain. He supposes, that a hundred Adams and Eves should all be produced full grown, and in <HI>conjugal pairs;</HI> and then concludes, that they would naturally herd together, and form a civil society, from their instinctive love of living together as gregarious animals. But, as some might object that another instinctive appetite would speedily disturb the peace of this society, and that Horace's <HI>tetrrima belli causa</HI> might make it a state of war, he sagely provides against this by noting, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the appetite between the sexes can have no place in the question, because it is not of that sort, which renders mankind gregarious."</Q> Yet, as he also owns, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the most solitary animals at certain seasons <HI>converse</HI> in pairs",</Q> it is necessary, for the support of his hypothesis, that all his Adams and Eves should be as chaste as turtles; and, therefore, I have called them a <HI>cool</HI> hundred, an epithet which, the reader sees, is here far from being an exple∣tive, but highly emphatical; for, if the Dean's hundred Adams and Eves were not more <HI>cool</HI> than an hundred pairs of people of fashion, whom I could mention, it is to be feared, that many of the males in his civil society, would not only be <HI>gregarious animals,</HI> but absolutely <HI>horned cattle.</HI> See Tucker on Government, p. 136.</NOTE></L>

<P>WHEREAS a late ingenious and anonymous production, entitled <HI>An Archaeological Epistle,</HI> has been attributed to my pen, I think proper to declare, that, however I may approve the political sentiments therein contained, I am above wearing any man's laurels; and that I conceive those, who do not discri∣minate between my style and that author's, have as little critical acumen, as he seems to allow to his reverend correspondent.</P>
