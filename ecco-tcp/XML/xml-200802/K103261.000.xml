<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>READER, if thou art a man of the world, this book will not please thee—it was written by those who were abstracted from mankind, and had little relish for either the ribaldry or amuse∣ments
<PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
of the present times.—Mr. Paulet was a clergyman un∣knowing in the world, and unknown to all but men like himself—the lat∣ter part of his life he read mankind chiefly in his study; for it was his unhappy fate, whenever he wished to take a wider range, to experience little more than their falsehood or infidelity.—His son, by becoming a private
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
tutor in town for a while, afforded him frequent opportunities of hearing what follies were most predominant; and from his own letters, perhaps, it may not be incurious to trace the decent sobriety of the character of the old English gentleman, when compared with the inflated maxims of the modern Indian innovator.—The daughter's correspondence likewise will not be totally unin∣structive,
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
as it may afford some re∣markable instances of the great changes that, in a short time, may be brought about from the pre∣valence of Manners over Laws, Principles, and Morality.—It may be justly urged, perhaps, that Mr. Paulet saw every thing through a contracted medium; but, however, the mind is tempered by virtue, or harmonized by religion,
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
I fear there are few good men who can survey the scenes that are continually shifting before them, without acrimony or disgust.—The mind of man in solitude is torpid and inactive, but when cast on the ocean of life, it is dissipated and infirm—restless in the pursuit of some hidden good, it wears out its sensibility by perpetual motion; and confined within the limits of an
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
unextended empire, it contracts it∣self, and becomes gloomy and des∣pondent.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT four o'clock this afternoon I was again sent for, not to pray by him, but (at my own request) to pay the last tribute to expiring friend∣ship—He had no orders to give about either his plumes or his monu∣ment—"If I have lived well, said he, my deeds will be graven on the minds of men, and I shall have the blessings of the deserving—let the poor be decently supplied on the oc∣casion with all necessaries, and if
<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
they loved me, they will not wish for superfluities—I have ever been their protector, and they would not, I am sure, convert my funeral into an hour of festivity—I feel an awe, but no grief, at my dissolution—some philosophers, it is said, have been above terrors, but I fear they were below humanity—to shudder is the part of the guilty, to stand un∣dismayed is the language of the Sto∣ic, to be humble is the duty of a man—before the mortification took place, I had need of all my resolution, but I hope in those moments I con∣fessed virtue on the rack, and suffered torture only to refine my ore from its dross—There is, I am convinced of it, now a counterpoise to all human mi∣sery—some hidden resource which
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>
the mind can best supply at its utmost exigency—I feel it now, and should think it ill exchanged for all that titles, wealth, fortune, or power could be∣stow upon me, and tho' I am journey∣ing apace to that undiscovered coun∣try, from which I never shall return, I would not wish for one hour of added life for aught but for my friends, amongst whom, my dearest Paulet, I have ever principally esteem∣ed you—thus saying, he pressed ea∣gerly my hand, looked fervently to heaven—sighed—and expired.—A scene like this awakened all my feel∣ings, and for some moments I expe∣rienced an awful something without a name—tears and grief had nearly overwhelmed me, but I have again recovered my tranquillity, for it would
<PB N="5" REF="16"/>
ill become me to fall a victim to dis∣tress, when my life and my profession demand me to make use of its instruc∣tion—I have gained by his death a trial of that fortitude, which I hope I have not altogether disgraced—what I have lost you can easily re∣count with me—He was a man, (for I must ever dwell on his character) who, though he had experienced all the falsehood of a bad world, had ne∣ver steeled his heart against the feel∣ings of humanity—he was benevolent without vanity, and generous with∣out ostentation—he had a heart, per∣haps, too susceptible of soft impres∣sions, which ever laid him open to the designs of the artful and disingenu∣ous, so that from the superiority of his understanding he derived a weak∣ness
<PB N="6" REF="17"/>
in his worldly conduct—he was warm in his resentments, but, lest he should be behind hand in reparation, paid always over price—he was skill∣ed in all the necessary truths of the religion he professed, and it was no inferior branch of his knowledge, that he was ever willing to remain igno∣rant of those deeper mysteries which its divine Author thought fit to con∣ceal from him—he was to me a pa∣tron, a benefactor, and a friend, a friend that—but I will here close the subject, entreating you, my dearest Charles, to withdraw frequently from the busy scenes of life to contemplate the character of a man, which may add fervour to virtue, zeal to religion, and confidence to truth.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FOR all what Mr. Pope says—that people never want to receive let∣ters but from London, I have the va∣nity to think you'll be glad to hear from me, tho' confined in this gloom of solitude—We have had a sad dull winter of it; my father being still quite moped for the death of poor Mr. Arlington: indeed he is a great loss to us all, but we hope soon to have ample amends made us by the great man that has just purchased his estate—he came down yesterday for the first time to view it, for he bought it only from the fine description that was given of it by the great auctioneer in London—his name is Massem—he has a sister who is come to that time
<PB N="8" REF="19"/>
of life, when you say we women be∣gin to cast long <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our shadows lengthen as the sun goes down.</NOTE> shadows—there are a Mr. and Mrs. Clip, who came with them two dependents, and a Mr. Lay∣out, a designer in taste in gardening, and no end of servants—I have only seen them as they passed by, for they stay but a day or two, as Miss Massem says she is indispensibly engaged to go with some duchess or other to the masquerade on Thursday evening next—The parish are quite delighted with their appearance; but my father seems afraid that these great folks should contaminate his flock, but I can't see why they should, for they say that they will be vastly good and charitable to the poor, and when they are down will almost entirely main∣tain
<PB N="9" REF="20"/>
them without work out of their own kitchen—I thought brother you would like to hear a little how we went on, and as you will pay no tax for this intelligence, I could not help scribbling a few lines, tho' it was on∣ly to assure you that I remain ever your affectionate sister,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sister,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Hope you would not suppose that either the diversions of town, or the dignity of my new character as pre∣ceptor,
<PB N="10" REF="21"/>
would so entirely engross my attention, as to make me forget my friends—It is true, this mode of life has not a little engaged both my at∣tention and my wonder—I wonder at every thing I see, and then I wonder that I should wonder at any thing—all here is one perpetual scene of tu∣mult, noise, and dissipation—mankind ever in pursuit of something, which when found, creates more wants than it supplies—a general siege is laid against an old offender called Time, which, though every one complains of the loss of, yet every one is in league to kill it as fast as possible—the old maid at Ranelagh may have hopes of making a conquest, and the old ma∣tron at a rout may be enraptured with spadille—but, believe me, these are
<PB N="11" REF="22"/>
only secondary considerations—to kill so much time is the principal point in view—for how can the old maid experience any real pleasure from haunting those circles where she is conscious that she is considered but as the forlorn shadow of her departed beauty—or how can the old matron receive any high gratification from returning to those tables, where she must reflect (if she has not stifled re∣flection) that she can only afford new specimens of the acidity of her tem∣per, and the fraudulency of her inten∣tions—indeed she has one consolation, that the troops she is engaged with are generally full as corrupt and con∣taminated as herself.—You will say that the old can have but few prospects and amusements—it is true, but they
<PB N="12" REF="23"/>
can have real ones, prospects ever brightening, as attraction must ever encrease, the nearer we approach the object—but you will now exclaim that I appear already to write from my dictatorial chair, and give laws in the true style of a school-master; but I can never help expatiating on this sub∣ject, for it is not so much the comet itself, as the tail of that comet that I am so much in care for—there is al∣ways some expecting niece or entrust∣ed cousin, who, to be kept out of harm's way, must be the watchful sentinel to all this scene of disorder—good Heavens! as if the mind could be more in harm's way, or more dis∣sipated than by sitting seven hours at∣tendant on a card-table, now and then admiring work, perhaps indulged by
<PB N="13" REF="24"/>
introducing her knotting, and storing her mind (for to read would be ill manners) with those remarks only that avarice, ignorance, and ill hu∣mour are continually suggesting—and what are the fruits of this miserable farrago every day's experience too fa∣tally evinces.—You think I wish to deter you from coming here—indeed I do,—for tho' the country, I fear, affords frequently no better examples, yet it is impossible to drive quite so fast on cross-roads, as it is on a turn-pike; and there are numbers who can keep themselves afloat on a gentle stream, whose strength is yet utterly insuffi∣cient to stem a torrent.—I do not doubt either the goodness of your heart, or the firmness of your inten∣tions, but remember the wisest and
<PB N="14" REF="25"/>
the best have found the inefficacy of reason against worldly seduction—nor do I mean to stifle a generous en∣deavour, or preclude that trial which is appointed to virtue—I know both their value and reward—but consider—true courage consists in combating an enemy nobly, that attacks you—it is the part of a bravado only to be affi∣duous for a contest.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Father,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Now sit down to give you some ac∣count of the pupil who is entrusted to my care—He is a young man of rank and fortune, and not totally de∣void
<PB N="17" REF="28"/>
of literary attainments—for a short time he has been at Westminster school, but (as too frequently is the case) has been so much taken off by the diversions of the town, that it was well if in the course of the week the Masters were able to remove that love of dissipation, which the young man had imbibed the preceding days of it—however, before I came to him he could tolerably construe some of the easier classics, and he is by no means deficient in point of natural abilities—by the death of his mother he is now committed to the care of an uncle, who, for a year and a half, has placed him under my direction—what my mediocrity shall be able to impart I know not; but attention will not be wanting, and I have a father ever
<PB N="18" REF="29"/>
able and willing to supply all my de∣ficiencies—my present endeavour is to improve his taste by furnishing his mind with the best criticisms on an∣cient literature, such as Warburton's on the 6th Book of Virgil, and Hurd's on the Art of Poetry.—By the aid of these books I perceive his mind to be wonderfully enlarged, and he has al∣ready remarked that the fame of the commentators ought nearly to equal the glory of their respective authors—from hence you will gather that he has Feeling, which in preference to every other consideration ought prin∣cipally to be improved.—He has just asked my opinion of the Ramblers, which, says he, I find are generally considered as pompous and pedantic—I tell him that the Ramblers are my
<PB N="19" REF="30"/>
manuals, and I can more properly ap∣ply the words of bishop Burnet to them, than to any other modern pro∣ductions,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That they are the store-house of all moral virtues."</Q>
—I fear he thinks I have strong prejudices, for he often observes that the world speaks quite otherwise—as to the world, I tell him, there are but few who are capable of judging—those that are, either through envy or other malignant passions, will rarely do jus∣tice to living authors—Johnson would be more read, was his matter as thinly spread as in other periodical publica∣tions—then he has written on party subjects, and this can never be for∣given by his vanquished opponents—Warburton is not less obnoxious on the same account—indeed so far I will
<PB N="20" REF="31"/>
accede—that the one by long dealing in words has too much encreased the vocabulary, and the other by dealing too much with mankind has at length exceeded the decent limits of all sober satire—but truth and virtue were their guides, and whilst these remain in the world, such authors will ever be considered as their brightest orna∣ments—an old gentleman was by chance present at this dialogue be∣tween my pupil and me, who hastily exclaimed, "Good God! sir, why I never heard a syllable of all this, in regard to either of them, and I have resided the greatest part of my life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bishop of Gloucester lived at Prior Park, near Bath, and the author of the Ramblers in Johnson's Court, Fleet-street.

pray be free, and call for any thing you like here—you need not stand mearly-mouthed, as if you was with some of your half-starved country 'squires—call about you, man, says he—we don't cupboard the bottoms of the bottles here—why, egad, my servants in the kitchen live grander than all the gentry hereabouts put to∣gether."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Gentry—says miss Mas∣sem—rabble you mean, brother."</Q>—I only replied, that I rarely drank wine in an afternoon—the conversation then chiefly ran on their own gran∣deur, and the ignorance and poverty of their neighbours—after tea—Mr. Layout favoured us with Remarks on Taste in Gardening: alas! how dif∣ferent from poor Mr. Arlington's (which by the bye I shall select for

you from his papers) and Miss Massem insisted on my looking at her Trou Madame table; for tho' she knew, she said, that I would not be so wicked as to play of a Sunday, yet she declared that I should look at it—I told her that I supposed it might be as inno∣cent as any other game, but that I thought the Sabbath might be full as well enployed—<Q REND="inline">"ay, but how Dr. says the 'squire—for there's no visit∣ing hereabouts, and we never go to church; though, in compliment to you, we shall always send the servants."</Q>—I hoped they would come from a bet∣ter motive—<Q REND="inline">"ay, ay, says he, those sort of people like to show their best clothes."</Q>—Mr. Layout observed that Sunday was only fit to travel on; and Miss Massem added, that at best it

another"</Q>—I certainly agreed with her that it would, if that must be the necessary consequence.—This short dia∣logue throws a strong light on their respective characters, and when I consider what a total change such a family may bring about in a vil∣lage, I reason upwards and look with horror on an infected kingdom—if time and reflection can work any improvement, I shall gradually inculcate better notions; at present, it is in vain to attempt to sow good principles in a soil not formed for their reception.—Your sister joins in all love with</P>

and his two full blown daughters—to be sure miss Massem said they meant to be very civil, but they were almost too bad to visit, however as they were her nearest neighbours, she would always endeavour to make an annual sacrifice.—As to Mr. Massem, he said it was much the same what places he visited at, for most of our country gentry kept such bad cooks, that he should always be obliged to get away as soon as possible, that he might make an early supper—and for the future, if he must visit sir John, he should always go out of principle on an Ash-Wednesday—However, they know nothing of all this, and if they did not see us laugh, I believe took the visit very kind and friendly.</P>

<P>I Thank you for every remembrance of me—but if you won't take it quite ill, I must rally you a little about <HI>day visiting</HI>—to be sure it is con∣sidered as a mark of friendship and esteem, but I believe in general that it proceeds from little more than a love of dissipation, or to gratify an idle curiosity.—I remember paying a visit of the sort you speak of, and

could not help reflecting how little amusement there could be either to the <HI>entertainers</HI> or the <HI>entertainees.</HI>—Those who are to <HI>entertain</HI> are anxious for the dignity or propriety of the treat, and where there is much anxiety there can be little or no comfort—then if any awkward circumstances should occur (as the world now goes), they know they will be the talk of the whole neighbourhood; and where servants are not always in trammels, some will spill the beer, and others trample on your favourite lap-dog.—On the other hand those who are to be <HI>entertained,</HI> as soon as they have swallowed their dinners, talked of the wine, the weather, and the roads—heard perhaps that sir John Strictly's hares are all snared, or that Dr. Mean∣well
<PB N="33" REF="44"/>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY time of late has been much taken up in assisting the executors to settle Mr. Arlington's affairs—we now find that from the very advan∣tageous sale of the estate, after paying off all the debts, there will be some∣thing left very considerable for his relations—a circumstance which, could he have known, poor man! would have greatly contributed to have brightened up the evening of his days—but to wave this melancholy subject.</P>
<P>So ignorant, Charles, was I of the world, that I did not know it was one great instance of politeness to go up to town only just to come down again,
<PB N="37" REF="48"/>
and that with such rapidity, that a by-stander might fancy that the na∣tional welfare depended on their speed—<HI>We</HI> have now brought down with us, I assure you, as part of <HI>our</HI> retinue, a domestic chaplain, Mr. <HI>Pliant</HI>—so silken, so supple, and so complying, that I could almost fancy him to say to his patron—<Q REND="inline">"Is it your pleasure, sir, to believe in God?"</Q>—He is, I find on enquiry, a distant relation, and seems thoroughly broke in to the office he is to fill—yesterday, as I was return∣ing from my usual ride, I met him, like <HI>Justice Overdo</HI> in the comedy, in quest of enormities, and we really enjoyed a very pretty kind of a chit-chat, till at length some how or other I dropped out something about servilities—<Q REND="inline">"Servilities!" says he, "now I reckon
<PB N="38" REF="49"/>
you think that I am forced to submit to some servilities as you call them—no, sir, let me tell you, my mode of life is perfectly agreeable to me—Mr. Massem keeps a good table, has the choicest liquors—and, though your country hereabouts to be sure is dull enough, yet we have always company in the house to pass away the time with—and as for business, I have nothing to do but to dust the books—clean the bird-cages, and now and then make rebusses for the ladies—indeed if we had not some amuse∣ments amongst ourselves, it would be dull enough here, for I have been sauntering about," says he, "for these two hours, and cannot meet with any one thing worthy the least observ∣ation"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Surely," says I, "sir, nature,
<PB N="39" REF="50"/>
to a mind capable of reflection like yours, every where presents a fund of entertainment—to a man, who knows how to take a ride, this blade of grass, or this declining hill af∣fords an infinite scope for contem∣plation—in this sequestered scene me∣thinks I could say with Shakespeare, that I
<Q><L>" Find tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,</L>
<L>Sermons in stones, and good in every thing."</L></Q>
but if this retired prospect delights you not, I will return with you to the top of the hill, and present you with an object that may call forth all your attention—that is at once a cure for pride, and a lecture to am∣bition;
<PB N="40" REF="51"/>
that reminds philosophy of its true end, and makes none but the ignorant tremble to behold it—it leads the languid to hope, allays the the thirst of avarice, and places wealth on its true foundation—to you and me, sir, it may be the vehicle to hap∣piness; a car more triumphant than ever graced the conquests of a Caesar, or an Alexander"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Good God! sir", says my companion, "what can you mean?—I can see nothing but a HEARSE."</Q></P>
<P>In short, Charles, as I found the present delighted him not, I thought it by no means unfair to raise his pro∣spect to Futurity.</P>

<P>I Intended by to-day's post to have sent you a string of political reports, with some large extracts from speeches said to have been lately made in the house of commons; but, as I find the former are nothing but reports, and the latter, like dying confessions, were printed beforehand, I now sit down with an absolute determination to give you nothing but the truth.</P>
<P>The grand vehicle of business in this metropolis appears to me to be a <HI>Lie</HI>—it rises in the morning with the watchman, bawling out—<HI>Half an hour past eleven o'clock,</HI> and accompanies the 'prentice home, who pulls out his
<PB N="42" REF="53"/>
watch with great eagerness to con∣vince his master that it has not yet struck <HI>twelve</HI>—through the regions of darkness, its operations perhaps are better supposed than described, for it stands not unveiled in open day-light till it is circulated through the Strand by paragraphs, postcripts, letters, and advertisements—fame, in the shape of a news-carrier, sounding the trum∣pet before it.—By its aid the trades∣man and his wife are enabled to drink their coffee, and by its aid the trades∣man and his wife are enabled to drink that coffee comfortably, for scandal, like irreligion, gives a relish to many enjoyments.—But now the whole city is in a ferment, for there its morn∣ings are monopolized, and it is <HI>ex∣changed</HI> and <HI>brokered</HI> about to greater
<PB N="43" REF="54"/>
or less advantage from its different degrees of sanctity in great wigs, and its more or less solemnity in city faces—indeed it is never a moment unemployed there but at dinner-time, when it steals away to meet the states∣man on his return from the gaming-table or the stews—with him it holds a levee, where it is decked in smiles and graces—(what it has lost in weight it has gained in politeness)—and lends to expectation, even the confidence of success—the veil indeed is never taken off, for the promiser gives a hundred to strengthen one, till time alone convinces you of the uncertainty of a future day—you now plead loudly for admittance, but to-morrow is called in to the juggler's aid, for this afternoon he is engaged to vote
<PB N="44" REF="55"/>
against <HI>the Articles,</HI> and at night he must negociate with a Jew ere he dares to show his face again before the waiter at Almack's—but his ser∣vants perhaps are town-bred, and are taught to descry want and necessity by intuition—Lying is their professed science, for what mischiefs might not ensue if through ignorance a stranger should be let in to see a patriot barter his integrity, or a fair one her reputation and her virtue—if mis∣takes like these should arise, <HI>Honour</HI> must be called in as a safe-guard here, as <HI>Goodness</HI> is the security of the city—but the evening advances, and it is now sold wholesale at theatres, lecture∣shops, and all other places of public diversion—like Scrub, it may be said to be of all professions—<Q REND="inline">"one day

it drives the coach, another it drives the plough, another it draws war∣rants, and another it draws beer"</Q>—it seems to be the desideratum of the philosopher, for it operates uni∣versally from the speech that is ad∣ministered at noon-day, to the dark slander that is only launching into whisper-hood—the poet relies upon it for his dinner, and the politician for his pay—the divine—but hold—here it can be of no use except now and then to explain a text,—till it openly stands confessed, and by a <HI>nolo episcopari</HI> becomes a passport to a bishoprick—in short, where is it not of use, except in the uncontrouled intercourse between a tender and in∣dulgent father and an ever dutiful and affectionate son,</P>

<HEAD>Remarks from the late Mr. Arling∣ton's Papers.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<LABEL>I.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Men are frequently most desirous of talking on those subjects they least understand—for the same reason per∣haps as ladies at ninety-nine affect to have the tooth-ach.</ITEM>
<LABEL>II.</LABEL>
<ITEM><HI>Addison,</HI> a man of great judgment in other branches of literature, is
<PB N="48" REF="59"/>
scarce ever right when he criticizes the old English language.</ITEM>
<LABEL>III.</LABEL>
<ITEM>No man can properly criticize Mil∣ton who has not carefully studied Euripides<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Arlington here probably alludes to <HI>Sampson Agoniftes,</HI> many passages of which appear evidently to be borrowed from thence.</NOTE>.</ITEM>
<LABEL>IV.</LABEL>
<ITEM>There ought to be an act of parlia∣ment against burying authors of emi∣nence under their own ruins—Swift will soon be an example of this.</ITEM>
<LABEL>V.</LABEL>
<ITEM>It has been objected against study∣ing Thucydides, that he wrote a large folio comprising only a very short period—the time indeed is short, but the writer made ample amends by
<PB N="49" REF="60"/>
the force of his descriptions, and the sublimity of his style—and it is a suf∣ficient encomium perhaps to say that he was studied by Demosthenes, and imitated by Sallust.</ITEM>
<LABEL>VI.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Mr. Pope's Essay on Man is certain∣ly a very masterly performance in point of poetry; but the philosophy contained in it is flimsy and uncon∣nected.</ITEM>
<LABEL>VII.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Sterne will be immortal when Ra∣belais and Cervantes are forgot—they drew their characters from the par∣ticular genius of the times—Sterne confined himself to nature only.</ITEM>
<LABEL>VIII.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Till my uncle Toby appeared I had used to assert, that no character was
<PB N="50" REF="61"/>
ever better drawn than that of sir Roger de Coverly.</ITEM>
<LABEL>IX.</LABEL>
<ITEM>A man may as well give himself the trouble to copy nature as Sterne.</ITEM>
<LABEL>X.</LABEL>
<ITEM>How much soever the ancients might abound in elegance of expres∣sion—their works are very thinly spread with sentiment.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XI.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Education should be the mirror of former prejudices.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XII.</LABEL>
<ITEM>I have frequently thought that the duty of visiting the sick should not be vested in the priest, for who knows but the constant sights of dying per∣sons may in time render their hearts,
<PB N="51" REF="62"/>
like those of butchers and surgeons, callous and void of humanity.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XIII.</LABEL>
<ITEM>A man by swearing may draw down a curse upon himself, but never one upon his neighbour.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XIV.</LABEL>
<ITEM>It is said by Tacitus, that men lose their respect for you in proportion to the favours you bestow—but as few perhaps know how to give with de∣licacy as others to receive with proper gratitude.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XV.</LABEL>
<ITEM>The parliament of England is form∣ed in a manner not totally dissimilar from that of the ancient council of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The general attention of this assembly, and the invariable object of all its modellers and directors, was to form a complete representative of all Greece; as the good of each individual was subservient to that of his community, so the good of each com∣munity was considered as subordinate to that of the whole nation. Their <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> was the man who considered himself as a member of the state, who submitted his conduct to the laws, who acted intirely under their direction, who gained popula∣rity, not by flattering the people, but by procuring their good; on the other hand the inhabitants did not confine their regards to their own private af∣fairs, they did not consider public difficulties mere∣ly as they affected their own tranquility, or that of their families; they were taught to regard their country as a common mother to whom they be∣longed no less than to their natural parents. While these principles preserved their due vigour and in∣fluence, Greece continued a really united body, happy in itself, and formidable to its enemies; but as soon as the nation began to degenerate, its repre∣sentative, of course shared in the corruption—and this degeneracy encreased so fast, that at length, we read, the most of those who were deputed to fit in this once famous council of Amphictyons, were so corrupt, that they even came prepared to earn the wages of iniquity—to devote themselves in∣tirely to the service of the crafty and the enter∣prising, who could pay them most liberally, with∣out regard to their own honour, the interest of the community, or the general good of Greece.</P>
<P>Vid. B. of Meaux, and Dr. Leland, &amp;c.</P></NOTE>

Amphictyons, or, as it is called by Demosthenes, the whole Hellenic body.</ITEM>
<LABEL><PB N="53" REF="64"/>XVI.</LABEL>
<ITEM>The character of the king of Prus∣sia, in many of the most remarkable strokes of it, strongly resembles that of Philip of Macedon.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XVII.</LABEL>
<ITEM>True politeness is the unaffected result of good nature and good sense.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XVIII.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Turnpike-roads and circulating li∣braries are the great inlets of vice and debauchery—the ladies will say
<PB N="54" REF="65"/>
this remark is quite Gothic, but their husbands feel the truth of it too forcibly.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XIX.</LABEL>
<ITEM>County races are meetings where the men assemble to quarrel about horses, and the women about pre∣cedence.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XX.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Plausibility is a more marketable quality than good sense.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XXI.</LABEL>
<ITEM>The man who bids fairest for suc∣cess, as candidate for any office where the public is principally concerned, is not he who has most friends, but he who has fewest enemies—not he whose talents raise an idea of supe∣riority, but he whose mediocrity be∣gets respect.</ITEM>
<LABEL><PB N="55" REF="66"/>XXII.</LABEL>

<ITEM>How frequently a man draws his his own character best, when he means to give you that of another person.</ITEM>

present, by the triumph of vice over virtue and religion.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XXVII.</LABEL>
<ITEM>There is no instance, but in religion, where it is a compliment to approve the profession, and abuse the practice.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XXVIII.</LABEL>
<ITEM>A malevolent man is always very lavish in his encomiums on the dead, because he thinks it is an insult to the living.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XXIX.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Mirth compared with chearfulness is as the huzza of a mob to the sober applause of a thinking people.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XXX.</LABEL>
<ITEM>As religion rises in speculation, it will lose in practice.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XXXI.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Metaphysics, however useful to detect the subtilty of others argu∣ments,
<PB N="57" REF="70"/>
are often very detrimental to the proficients in them—Reason her∣self may be lost by refinement.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XXXII.</LABEL>
<ITEM>The world generally asserts that spendthrifts have but half the for∣tune they really have, and that misers have at least twice as much.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XXXIII.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Young men are encouraged to take up general history much sooner than they ought—I would have them strongly impressed with moral vir∣tues, before they venture to read so dreadful a detail of crimes and mis∣fortunes.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XXXIV.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Foreign travel is knowledge to a wise man, and foppery to a fool.</ITEM>
<LABEL><PB N="58" REF="71"/>XXXV.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Man cannot be engaged in a deeper science than that of himself.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XXXVI.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Fashion is not only the greatest ty∣rant, but the greatest impostor.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XXXVII.</LABEL>
<ITEM>A man of bad morals can never be a patriot, for being destitute of virtue himself, he must ever wish to make his country like his own heart, a scene of anarchy and confusion.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XXXVIII.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Some authors boast that they al∣ways write in haste—but what is this but in other words to say, that they are possessed of such wonderful ta∣lents, that the world may easily com∣pound for error and neglect.</ITEM>
<LABEL><PB N="59" REF="72"/>XXXIX.</LABEL>
<ITEM>We frequently condemn old people for their love of pleasure and com∣pany—but surely the morning of life is best suited to business—the even∣ing to society.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XL.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Abuse is that tax which merit must always pay for its superiority.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XLI.</LABEL>
<ITEM>When maiden ladies come to a certain age, they do not reject the men so much from a love of virtue, as from resentment for the neglect that has long been shown them—they then begin to hate the male sex in general, from the inattention of par∣ticulars.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XLII.</LABEL>
<ITEM>In party disputes the prize is given
<PB N="60" REF="73"/>
to the most violent—but violence, we know, is the child of error.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XLIII.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Was it not well said, that Good-nature, like the God of Nature, was not always extreme, to mark what was done amiss?</ITEM>
<LABEL>XLIV.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Men often complain of the fickle∣ness of fortune—the error lies in their mistaking her benefits for perpetual gifts, instead of being grateful for a temporary loan.</ITEM>
<LABEL>XLV.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Because Plato <Q REND="inline">"reasoned well,"</Q> Cato is said to have fallen on his sword.—I fear it is because our modern infidels reason ill, that they so frequently be∣come Suicides.</ITEM>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your last <HI>kind</HI> letter, and now sit down to give you some lit∣tle account of the jaunt I have just taken with my good friends into Derbyshire.—My father, for a long time, was against my going, but Miss Massem did every thing in her power to teaze him into it.—At Derby we saw the Silk mills, and what I liked much better the New assembly room, and the China manufactory, but we staid there only a short time, for there was a low family who found out Mr. Massem, and was exceedingly troublesome and impertinent to him, so in the even∣ing we went to Kedleston, where we
<PB N="64" REF="77"/>
had a very tolerable dance—next day we saw lord Scarsdale's, which is very fine to be sure; but Miss Massem found great fault with the furniture of the house, and Mr. Layout, who was with us, allowed no part of the garden ground to be disposed in taste—Mr. Massem admired nothing but the large pillars; and captain Glan∣ville thought there was a great deal of idle money thrown away upon the library—as for myself, I liked every thing, but particularly the sideboard—from Kedleston we went to Mat∣lock, which, if it was not for the com∣pany, would, if possible, be ten times more dismal than Marleston—how∣ever, we danced and went upon the water with music, and drank tea at the boat house, and, upon the whole,
<PB N="65" REF="78"/>
passed our time very agreably—from thence we went to Chatsworth—it proved a most charming day, and we were all enraptured with the water∣works—in some places, cataracts of water fall down stairs twenty yards deep, and in others the water is forced up into the air to the most incredible height, to say nothing of the artificial tree which would have sprinkled us all over from its leaves, if it had not been out of order—from Chatsworth we went to Buxton, where we joined parties with lord Canvass and Dr. and Mrs. Grudgens—at first they took no notice of us, but as soon as they found out who Mr. Massem was, they were particularly complaisant and ci∣vil.—My lord is most exceedingly engaging—but Dr Grudgens talks of
<PB N="66" REF="79"/>
nothing but eating and preferment—and then so suspicious, that in a morning, when he played at <HI>all-fours</HI> with captain Glanville, if the hand was not out before the bell rung, he was sure to keep the cards in his pock∣et all the while he knelt down to say his prayers—indeed prayers here are merely made a farce of—for peo∣ple laugh and whisper the whole time—tho' it would not signify much if they did not, for what with the howl∣ing of dogs, the bawling of footmen, and the giggling of ladies maids in the passages, it would be utterly im∣possible to hear one syllable that the parson said—poor man!—I was really quite sorry for him, and my father would have been absolutely shocked, for the company had used to pay him
<PB N="67" REF="80"/>
more or less, just as they won or lost at cards—indeed I thought he seemed to have no advantage but that of say∣ing grace at the head of the table, whilst the ladies were fighting for the wings of the chickens.—But I must tell you one circumstance that hap∣pened about Mrs. Grudgens—one day she was very busy in carving an immense goose that stood before her, when captain Glanville desired her next neighbour to help him to some apple pye—Mrs. Grudgens, with all the good nature in the world, came immediately out of the goose, and plunged directly into the pye—to be sure she was elbow-deep in sage and onion—and the captain was so un∣lucky, for he is a man of vast wit, as to set all the company into a loud laugh
<PB N="68" REF="81"/>
by calling out—<Q REND="inline">"For heaven's sake madam stop—I asked for apple pye—I did not mean a medley one."</Q></P>

<P>I Must still think you too young to go into orders—I may be particu∣lar in my notions perhaps—but I will chearfully streighten my own circum∣stances to approve my sincerity.—It has been well observed, that
<PB N="69" REF="82"/>
<Q REND="inline">"young men are apt to mistake the completion of their academic courses for the completion of their theologic studies"</Q>—a mistake which inclines them to aspire to teach others, seeing the rather, (as St. Paul expresses it) that they ought to be taught them∣selves."—Those who are appointed to explain the oracles of God, should have attended to them most particu∣larly—otherwise they may soon be caught in the delusive snares of mo∣dern infidelity, or wax old in the pernicious system of not changing <Q REND="inline">"the posture of defence, and of keeping to strong holds."</Q>—And I am sorry to ob∣serve, that true religion has nearly suffered as much from the one as from the other—Our Saviour, per∣haps, has confined the practice of
<PB N="70" REF="83"/>
our duty within the limits of his own sermon on the mount; never∣theless, as a divine, it will be requir∣ed that you should be able to give a rational account of the faith that is in you—a rational and a cautious one let it always be, for the Scrip∣tures, in the hands of controvertists, have generally been wrested to the most infamous purposes—each man insisting on that being irreligion, which was only not consonant to his own prejudices.—St. Augustine, I know, asserts, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dictum est tamen—, non ut aliquid diceretur, sed ne taceretur.

such a saint would have said it, and this very assertion with me would invalidate his whole authority.—In regard to studying the Fathers in general, I can only say, that I hope they were sincere, but by their strange interpretations, (to say no worse of them) they have opened a door to ri∣dicule; and from their absurdities, modern infidels have sought occasion to undermine the main fabrick of re∣ligion itself.

<P>I Am just returned from Sadlers Wells, which does not only lower my idea of the times, but even of human nature—I do not so much re∣flect on the entertainment itself as it is called, as on the cruel means that must have been made use of before the managers could have procured so dreadful an exhibition—whence can arise the pleasure of seeing children suspended in the air, or tossed about
<PB N="76" REF="91"/>
at the utmost hazard of their lives to gratify the avarice of unnatural parents? But indeed the country affords almost as strong instances of cruelty, as town, for wrestling, single-stick, or even foot-ball, are never considered as di∣versions by the common people, but as attended with danger, mischief, or blood-shed;—but in town, what shocks me most, is that continual flocking to executions—in the country, from the less frequency of them, even butchers weep, but here they are ac∣counted the next diversions to Sadlers Wells; and by use men can see a monkey dangling from a wire, or a fellow-creature expiring at the gal∣lows with equal unconcern—how much care therefore should be taken to inculcate the principles of humanity
<PB N="77" REF="92"/>
in youth, a term which in general, I believe, is mistaken for cowardice; how little care indeed is taken, even amongst the higher ranks of people, who suffer their children unmercifully to treat the whole brute-creation, and then wonder that in time they be∣come cruel enemies and undutiful children—they think not how early these inhuman principles are imbibed; they begin indeed in infancy only with torturing flies, but they end in de∣lighting to view the most horrid murders of the inquisition.</P>
<P>At other places of great resort, a dog shows you what it is o'clock; bears dance minuets, and sparrows country-dances; but such exhibitions ought not to be allowed in a civi∣lized country; for no valuable dis∣coveries
<PB N="78" REF="93"/>
are likely to be made from them, that can any ways atone for the tortures which the birds or animals must experience in the training.</P>

<P>THE alterations already made at Marleston are so great, that I hard∣ly know my own village—Mr. Mas∣sem every day makes purchases of ground, no matter at what expence, that Mr. Layout may at least acknow∣ledge he has scope enough for his invention. I hear of nothing but Obe∣lisks, Statues, Gazebos, Terminations, and a Laurel-belt—they talk of taste just as if it was to be brought down in a broad-wheeled waggon, and they had nothing to do but to scatter it at random—Mr. Layout thinks there should be a clump, and there is one; the 'squire thinks it would look pretty
<PB N="80" REF="95"/>
to cut a vista through it, and it is cut; and his sister thinks she should like a dairy-house near the spot, and she builds it—so that at last it will be an <HI>Olio,</HI> a <HI>Christmas Pie,</HI> a <HI>Solomon Gundy,</HI> or perhaps a <HI>Fool's Coat</HI>—I must own, it rather grieves me to find that the grove on the right hand, where the rustic seat was, with the motto of <HI>Hae latebrae dulces &amp; si jam credis, amoenae,</HI> should be condemned to be cut down, as well as the large one, which Mr. Arlington had used to call Shenstone's Grove, for the urn to his memory was pret∣tily executed, and the placing of the statue of the Sibyl in front of it, which seemed to exclaim <HI>Procul O procul este profani!</HI> was in my opinion a very happy thought—however, they are all to be swept away, to make room,
<PB N="81" REF="96"/>
as the 'squire informs me, for a fine Mercury <HI>with his quiver,</HI> and a Her∣cules <HI>with his trident</HI>—I fear, some how or other, these Latin mottoes have called down vengeance on the groves themselves, for I am sure, that neither he nor his chaplain can construe them—instead of these ve∣nerable shades, a paltry shrubbery is to be planted, which is to be deco∣rated (as the 'squire would say), <Q REND="inline">"with all the monsters of the internal world."</Q>—By what I see of the in∣tended alterations of the water, it is destined to take any course but its own, for the merit of every thing seems to consist only in the sum it is to cost;—where the genius of the place is attended to, I am as much delighted as any man with modern
<PB N="82" REF="97"/>
improvements—but where expence is only considered, or mistaken as an∣other name for real taste, I feel so much disgust, that I turn away my eyes from false ornament, to con∣template nature herself in a simple farm, unbroke-in upon by a Mr. Lay∣out.</P>
<P>Mr. Massem has not only qualified himself to act as a Justice of the peace, but has likewise bought a seat in parlia∣ment—from this latter acquisition to his dignity, he will be enabled to do very little good or harm; but from the former, where some preparation is necessary, much mischief may ac∣crue to the neighbourhood, if he should prove, as I fear will be the case, <Q REND="inline">"a law unto himself."</Q>—indeed I am far from wishing to circum∣scribe
<PB N="83" REF="98"/>
the power of a justice, for very few are willing to act as it is with∣out pecuniary advantages,—and this I partly attribute to the great en∣crease of attornies—these sinful men in the flesh (as the Quakers call them) have stopped the free course of jus∣tice, and turned that food, which ought to have proved our nourish∣ment and support, into a disease.—What could be his motive for going into parliament (<HI>except the honour on't</HI>) I did not foresee, but Miss Massem informs me, that this will account for his civility in bowing to many of the shabby-looking people that he meets with in the streets of London—he may now call them his constituents, but I believe in reality
<PB N="84" REF="99"/>
they are no other than his own poor relations.</P>
<P>Oh! Charles, this Miss Massem is, I fear, a woman of bad principles; and though she is particularly kind and attentive to my daughter, yet I heartily wish the girl had never been introduced to her—she is artful in her conduct, violent in her prejudices, and <Q REND="inline">"made up of passions."</Q>—Her friends pretend to excuse her by say∣ing that she cannot curb herself, and that she is always the same before every body, but I should be apt to add, except her brother, from whom she has large expectations, so that you see the God of Wealth has infinitely more influence over her than the God of Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="100"/>There is a captain continually with her, whom I utterly detest; but of him more hereafter.</P>
<P>P.S. Mr. Massem has just been with me, and told me the price of his seat; and I agree with him that he has bought in very dear, for the stocks on that exchange are soon likely to fall.</P>

<P>MR. Massem's family intend to go to town immediately after Christ∣mas, to stay only a very short time, and they have been so kind as to offer to take me with them, and bear all my expences—this is a favour that I had no right in the world to expect from them; but, great as it is, I fear I shall not be able to accept it, unless you, brother, will be so good as to throw in your interest with my fa∣ther—Miss Massem has lain at him continually, but let her say what she will, he seems to have no inclination but to mew me up at Marleston—whenever I urge any thing of the
<PB N="87" REF="102"/>
necessity of my seeing more of the world, he always says he does not wish it—that he had much rather see me married to a good man, than a great one, and I believe he is as like∣ly to meet with the one as the other in this neighbourhood, unless he can persuade poor old Dr. Snore to make an offer, or the ever amiable and charming master Patty Pipkin; but perhaps he aspires so high as to think I may marry 'squire Homebrew'd, or Parson Poacher—if I should be honoured with the first, my employ∣ment would be I suppose to make tea all day long to settle his stomach, and if I take the other, I should be constantly engaged in packing up hampers of hares and partridges to send to town, to be exchanged by
<PB N="88" REF="103"/>
his correspondents for oysters and brandy.—My father seriously, I be∣lieve, means all for my good, but I am every day more and more con∣vinced that his not knowing the world, will be my greatest misfor∣tune, for I am sure Marlestone is not the place, if a woman (as Miss Mas∣sem says) is intended to make the most of herself. In short, brother, all my comfort this winter depends, upon you, for there is nobody else can persuade my father if you can't; and you must have a poor opinion indeed of me, if you think both my safety and my prudence are at stake, because I shall chance to breathe for a week or two the air of London.</P>

<P>BY all the affection I bear you, let me entreat you not to urge this London journey too far—my father is convinced that it is absolutely im∣proper, or he never would deny you; and I think you could not enjoy pleasures abroad that must be pur∣chased with uneasiness at home—perhaps he wishes not to receive such obligations, or perhaps he thinks that it will throw you into a mode of life

not calculated to promote your real happiness—whatever are his objec∣tions, I should think his sentiments should be the rule of your conduct. In regard to <Q REND="inline">"women making the most of themselves,"</Q> Miss Massem has borrowed that idea from her brother, who has been used in India to make such purchases at a public market; and indeed if the plan was as openly avowed here, in my mind it would make but very little difference—for what is running from plays to con∣certs, from concerts to routs, and from routs to the Pantheon, but being equally exposed to sale at a public market—and what is the preparation to it but the vilest prostitution of time, reason, and tranquility—the mornings are passed in selecting orna∣ments,
<PB N="91" REF="106"/>
and the conquests of the even∣ing depend on the skill of the hair∣dresser in adjusting them—how im∣portant He is considered can only be known by seeing the disappointment, vexation, and uneasiness that are oc∣casioned when, after two hours wait∣ing, the fatal message is brought, that he cannot possibly wait on the lady till next day—and what are the conquests after, all, that are to be made here—of men perhaps cha∣grined at having lost their last guinea, or of fops who have found out a new way to trim their frocks, or tye their neckloths—alas! these men are too much taken up with themselves to be sufficiently attentive to the ladies, and the Wise have long since known that, where a woman's darling passion

<P>ALL the diversions I see here con∣tribute to lower my respect for the public—whether the national ca∣pacity is weakened, or whether the encreasing numbers of the idle and the vain make it no longer necessary to consult propriety in entertain∣ments, I know not, but certain I am that the taste of the town is as de∣praved as its principles,</P>
<P>It was a complaint made, some years ago, that our Operas were dis∣graced with the lowest insipidity of composition and sing-song, and that there was nothing to be admired but the mere tricks of the performers—this must always be the case in a nation where a fidler is more estimat∣ed
<PB N="94" REF="109"/>
than a composer; but now the times are so far altered, that neither the fidler nor the music are attended to at all—if the eye is pleased, the ear and understanding are supposed to be gratified of course.—Those who chiefly frequent operas, gape out this part of the performance, and wake not till they are caught up with raptures at the unmeaning strut of a celebrated Dancer.</P>
<P>Translations of that miserable dia∣logue, which were heretofore thought only fit to be set to music, are now received at the theatres with the greatest applause, under the appella∣tion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Paulet surely forgets the West Indian, which is undoubtedly one of the best Comedies in the lan∣guage. Editor.</NOTE> of Comedy—bewilder only the attention with a quick succession of
<PB N="95" REF="110"/>
incidents, and Scotticisms, French jar∣gon, and Irish blunders, in short, a Babel of languages are sure to supply all deficiencies of wit and humour.</P>
<P>In regard to Tragedies—those that I have seen are merely indebted to the quackery of a manager for their success, indeed most of them appear to be made by the same receipt—the ingredients are a tyrant, a mar∣riage, incest, murder, and a triumph: the poetry (once thought essential) now seems to make the least part of the production—a scheme is laid be∣tween a manager, a painter, an au∣thor, and a scene-shifter to fabricate a new piece—the action must be laid in a part of the world that will best suit the scenery of the house; for, by a little dexterity in the painter, the
<PB N="96" REF="111"/>
figure of a Colossus may be easily changed into an Egyptian idol;—the next step is to consult the strength of the house, in regard to the per∣formers—as there are no tolerable men, the lady must recite at least half the play—they have an old man that can make a shift to whine out a small part, a roaring tyrant, and a d—m your blood lover, and then the scene-shifters may supply the rest—Whilst the work is perfecting, the public is informed by the News-papers that a gentleman of distinguished abilities (now abroad) will soon favour the town with a new tragedy—the first night of the performance the house is crowded in every corner of it (for mankind are not in quest of what is good, but of any Hash that they mis∣take
<PB N="97" REF="112"/>
to be a new one)—the curtain rises to soft music, the lady makes vows at the altar, the tyrant and his trumpets alarm her—she faints, and is ordered to be married.—A hermit secretes her from the tyrant—discovers himself to be her father, the lover finds out the hermitage, and the se∣cond acts ends with their embraces.—They must then embrace no more—he is her brother—she flies from him to an altar, or a tomb, (this makes variety in the puppet-show)—the ty∣rant sees her, and would absolutely bear her off, but she is rescued by her brother.—In the fourth act her brother is seized by the tyrant's guards—is imprisoned—she visits him—the guards drag her from her bro∣ther to the tyrant—he then resolves
<PB N="98" REF="113"/>
instantly to marry her—she screams, and the hermit bursts in, and pro∣mises to make an important discovery, if he will only delay the nuptials—the tyrant still persists—his guards seize the hermit—she rages, prays, and goes mad—the noise encreases, and the theatre is drowned with tears.—Expectation is now big for the fifth act—what a scene of distress!—she is absolutely forced to the altar, but there, rather than marry the tyrant, the murderer of her race, she re∣covers her senses, and murders him herself—the guards take no notice of the matter, and the house applauds her for near a quarter of an hour;—the hermit then declares that her lover is not her brother, but a young prince whom he has educated, and
<PB N="99" REF="114"/>
therefore with great piety gives his blessing on their nuptials—all then is joy and exultation—and thus, agree∣able to all the rules of Tragedy, ends this miserable happy catastrophe.—Some half dozen in the theatre per∣haps may be rather discontented, but to keep them in humour, a favourite actress takes off their attention from the play, by giving them the news of the town by way of epilogue.</P>

<P>ACCORDING to your desire I shall now endeavour to point out to you some <HI>Minutiae,</HI> as they are called, which may serve as proper hints, before you go into Holy Or∣ders—Minutiae, which not being suf∣ficiently attended to, always confirm me in the opinion that a minister is either ignorant of, or indifferent to the service he is to perform.—By the Rubrick, before the Common Prayer of the 2d of Edw. VI. it was ordered that the priest being in the quire (that is, in his own seat there) should begin with the Lord's Prayer; but early in the reign of queen Elizabeth,
<PB N="104" REF="119"/>
reading desks were set up in the body of the church, and then the Sen∣tences, Exhortation, Confession, and Absolution were generally introduced<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vide Burn's Eccles. Law.</NOTE>—in regard to the Sentences, I shall only observe that any of them are proper, but if you begin with <Q REND="inline">"If we say that we have no sin, we de∣ceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us, but if we confess our sins, He, &amp;c."</Q>—you must here supply the word <HI>God,</HI> for <HI>He</HI> has no reference. The exhortation, which must be read with dignity and earnestness, should close I think at <Q REND="inline">"heavenly Grace,"</Q> and the words <Q REND="inline">"saying after me,"</Q> should be pronounced as you are kneeling down.—The absolution
<PB N="105" REF="120"/>
should not be given, as I have fre∣quently heard it, as if the minister had power to forgive sins, but the voice must be carefully kept up till you come to <Q REND="inline">"He pardoneth and for∣giveth," &amp;c.</Q>—The Venite, which must now be considered as another exhor∣tation, was formerly used to hasten people into church, and Durandus, I think, mentions that some lazy Christians had always used to lie in bed till they heard the Venite sung.—The Psalms <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In point of composition, the 114th Psalm is a finer ode than any in Horace.</P>
<Q><P>When Israel came out of Egypt, and the house of Jacob from among strange people,</P>

<PB N="107" REF="122"/>
will arise if you do not mi∣nutely consider the sense, and keep up your voice at the end of those verses where the sentence is not com∣plete—nor is this all—the manner must be particularly attended to—a penitential Psalm should be read very differently from that of an exulta∣tion;—in regard to the lessons, there is a still greater scope—the manner of reading them, should be as va∣rious as the matter; for what can be more opposite than the commands of Pharaoh, and the supplication of Ju∣dah—this is scarce ever attended to; for most divines, I am sorry to say, read even the threatnings of Goliah with the meek voice of David—the New Testament demands that in the gospel you should plainly recite a
<PB N="108" REF="123"/>
narrative—in the fifteenth of Corin∣thians, that you should triumph in your redemption.—In the Belief, I confess, that I am much hurt that most congregations should bow at the name of Jesus, and not at that of God the Father—this—if it has any meaning, exalts the Son above the Father, which is unnecessary in a Pro∣testant country—but the custom has crept in from taking a text in St. Paul in the literal sense <Q REND="inline">"at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow," &amp;c.</Q>—Then follow the Collects—and here I must particularly take notice of that on Advent Sunday, which I hope you can repeat with the pro∣priety it deserves—when you come to that passage <Q REND="inline">"that at the last day, when He shall come again in his
<PB N="109" REF="124"/>
glorious Majesty," &amp;c.</Q> your own feelings will prompt you to throw in a suitable degree of solemnity—weigh the whole of it, I entreat you, for it is one of the finest models of petitionary composition.—When the Order for Morning and Evening Ser∣vice began with the Lord's Prayer, it ended with the third Collect for Grace—the Litany was then a sepa∣rate service, and I could almost wish that it had either remained so, or that more prayers were omitted on those days that it is appointed to be read—the recital of it however requires particular attention—oh! how fre∣quently has it offended both my ear and understanding when a minister has made a full stop at <Q REND="inline">"all uncha∣ritableness,"</Q> as if he had no need to be
<PB N="110" REF="125"/>
delivered from it."—In regard to the Communion Service, I shall at present only observe, that you should not give the Commandments from the altar—this is making the old law of more weight than the new—the code to be amended more sacred than the law explained—in short, if it must be read at all, it should be read at the beginning, not at the end; but I need not inform you that this likewise was originally a separate service. These are the chief remarks which imme∣diately occur, and which being weigh∣ed, may add propriety to the fervency of your devotion—the subject will improve upon you by attention, for though I am not so zealous as some di∣vines who assert that our service is perfect in the beauty of holiness, yet

elegance of Hurd?—You can answer, I hope, all these questions in the affirmative—let me then advise you to buy all the sermons that Man∣waring has ever published—would his pamphlets were folios! but for more common use attend to—study Bour∣dalone—the length of your discourses should not exceed twenty minutes (few hearers can keep up their atten∣tion so long), but should you be dull, heavy, uninstructive, nay I will say unentertaining, half that time will be estimated an hour—a good sermon, delivered with propriety and earnest∣ness, always attracts—even the infidel keeps his snuff-box in his pocket, and the ladies are silent about their fans; but once lose their attention, the whole air distils the dews of Mor∣pheus,
<PB N="114" REF="129"/>
the 'prentice recollects his Sa∣turday's fatigue, and his mistress is forced to pinch her husband to pre∣vent a snore—in short, though I hate both, I think volatile essence is a better ingredient in a sermon than a down∣right opiate.—But what subjects must; you choose for discourses?—here I should hesitate—by no means intro∣duce party—never preach <HI>at</HI> any body; this is the fruit of private resentment, not of Christian zeal—don't pretend to expound very difficult texts—ex∣positions of this kind become the press better than the pulpit—such disquisitions should be read, not heard—address the senses and the heart—quote not chapter and verse, but give the substance, and, if you could, the manner of St. Paul; for I am con∣vinced
<PB N="115" REF="130"/>
that he preached not like—or—but like Hinchliffe, Porteus, or Hurd;—now and then take subjects from the Bible, but most frequently from the New Testament; a good comment on any sentence in our Sa∣viour's sermon on the mount is of it∣self a full discourse, but you may make excursions—I have read ex∣cellent discourses against gaming, and very lately a most useful sermon against inhumanity to brutes. But where are you to preach?—by no means for a constancy in a village, where your principal auditors will be only a few overgrown farmers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is well Mr. Paulet has confined himself to the overgrown ones, for I humbly conceive that the middling farmers, like the middle ranks of people, were the most attentive as well as the most intelli∣gent of his audience.

<PB N="117" REF="132"/>
but I am clearly convinced that these men have greatly augment∣ed the distresses of the inferior clergy, and it is chiefly owing to them, in conjunction with attornies, that there is so much <Q REND="inline">"leading into captivity, and such complaining in our streets."</Q>—These are the only men about us, my dear Charles, who have shown neither gratitude nor affection to the memory of poor Mr. Arlington, yet are ready on every occasion to bow the knee most servilely to the Na∣bob.—This brings on melancholy re∣flections: adieu for the present, and believe me ever</P>

<P>P.S. Let me give you one more caution in regard to sermons—never introduce any thing ludicrous in them—it may be called preaching in the manner of South or Sterne, but it is a bad manner, and I pray you avoid it—Atterbury has frequently disgusted me beyond measure with vulgar allusions; and even the bishop of Gloucester, when he talks of Ho∣cus Pocus tricks, in a sermon on the resurrection.</P>

<P>I Cannot forbear sending you my earliest acknowledgements for your kind remarks—I will give them, at least, all the attention they deserve.</P>
<P>I have not only seen your neigh∣bour, Mr. Massem, but have heard him speak in the house of commons on the booksellers petition—he enlarged on the <HI>nearness</HI> and <HI>dearness</HI> of pro∣perty in general—<Q REND="inline">"that it was for that only that men had been enabled to risque every thing that was valu∣able to them in this life—that he thought authors were a very perni∣cious race of men; that they caused all that abuse on men of property that

appeared so frequently in the news∣papers, and that the booksellers were a pack of bloodhounds that set them on; that he therefore hoped neither of them would have any relief under <HI>this here</HI> bill—that he thoroughly un∣derstood this particular kind of pro∣perty; he had weighed it, and viewed it in every light, and was fully con∣vinced that the whole was merely a dispute between the statute law and the common law of the land; for his own part, therefore, he should al∣ways be for the former."</Q>—He spoke long and with great confidence, and was much better heard on the subject of <HI>property,</HI> than either a Burke or a Barré would have been, had the <HI>weight</HI> and <HI>circulation</HI> of it been materially engaged against them.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Was in hopes to have found more Remarks of Mr. Arlington's on Gardening, &amp;c. than I am at present able to send you—he evidently in∣tended to have said more on Archi∣tecture, which is absolutely necessary likewise to be thoroughly understood by the complete Master of modern Design.</P>
<P>From these papers you will see what notions the ancients held of
<PB N="122" REF="137"/>
gardening in general; but should you ever wish to dive into further parti∣culars, I will shew you a most cu∣rious book on that subject, which I have by me; the title of it is <HI>Stengel de Horto</HI>—mine is the second edition, printed in 1650.—There are a thou∣sand different receipts to make para∣dises; and his account of the gardens in Italy will much divert you: indeed I suspect that the Italian gardens are not much improved since the days of <HI>Phflaumeren.</HI>—In regard to the French gardens, you may look over a book entitled <HI>Voyage Pittoresque des Environs des Paris, par M. D. . .</HI> He be∣gins, as you would suppose a French∣man to begin, with saying,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ce n'est point un paradoxe, d'avancer que les plus beaux jardins de l'Eu∣rope
<PB N="123" REF="138"/>
sont ceux de France."</Q>—I was surprised to find in Maundrell's Travels, that there was so much ge∣nuine taste amongst the Turks.</P>
<P>Since lord Kamis and Mr. Shen∣stone published their Remarks, there has appeared a little Essay on Design in Gardening, by a gentleman of the Temple, and an octavo volume of Ob∣servations, written by Mr. Wh—ley; both of them books of merit, but the latter, I think, is too full of technical terms for a novice to en∣gage in.</P>
<P>Mr. Arlington differs in opinion from Mr. Mason, in regard to ave∣nues—this is combating great au∣thority, but if I was to decide, I should be so old-fashioned as to give my verdict against the poet. But
<PB N="124" REF="139"/>
you will say, what is all this to me, who perhaps may never have ten acres of ground in my possession, or ever cultivate any thing better than potatoes or cabbages—this may be very true, but I would be equally able to feel, and to make proper re∣marks, and to exclaim in the words of Goldsmith, that lawns, lakes, towns, fields, and woods

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GARDENING, says an ingenious au∣thor<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lord Kamis.</NOTE>, was at first an useful art"—but Eden<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sir Wm. Temple.</NOTE> was calculated for plea∣sure, and a life of labour succeeded not till after the fall.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In modern language, the garden of Alcinous might be but a kitchen-garden,"</Q> yet, as Eustathius observes, <Q REND="inline">"ornaments was sought for even there, however unsuccessfully,"</Q> unless we suppose the description given by Ho∣mer
<PB N="126" REF="141"/>
to be <Q REND="inline">"wholly poetical, and made at the pleasure of the painter, like the little island of Phaeacia."</Q></P>
<P>It would not be of much import∣ance to enquire whether the gardens of Babylon were brought into use by Semiramis, Syrus, or Belus—we find in general, that they were terraces one above the other, carried up to the height of the wall of the city, and planted with stately trees, in imi∣tation of the hanging woods, which Amyite had been accustomed to in the mountainous parts of Media.</P>
<P>As the gardens of Solomon were chiefly calculated for magnificence, and those of the Hesperides celebrated for the excellence of their fruit only, I shall venture to suppose the dawn of taste to rise with the old Bard in his description of Calypso's bower,
<Q><PB N="127" REF="142"/>
<L>Without the grot, a various sylvan scene</L>
<L>Appear'd around, and groves of living green;</L>
<L>Poplars and alders ever quiv'ring play'd,</L>
<L>And nodding cypress form'd a fra∣grant shade;</L>
<L>Four limpid fountains from the clifts distil,</L>
<L>And every fountain pours a sev'ral rill,</L>
<L>In mazy windings wand'ring down the hill:</L>
<L>Where bloomy meads with vivid greens were crown'd,</L>
<L>And glowing violets threw odours round;</L>
<L><PB N="128" REF="143"/>A scene, where if a god should cast his sight,</L>
<L>A god might gaze, and wonder with delight.</L><BIBL>Pope's Odyssey.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>It is not improbable, says Sir Wil∣liam Temple, but that the most refined pleasures of invention descended ear∣lier into Lower Asia from Damascus and Assyria—but as these nations abounded not with heroes, the poets make little or no mention of them.</P>
<P>It has been supposed, that Epicurus was the first who introduced gardens into Greece—but Pliny assures us, he was only the first who had a garden within the city of Athens, whereas before his time they were without the walls, like the <HI>Horti Suburbani</HI> of the Romans.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="144"/>In such retreats this great philoso∣pher gave the most shining precepts of morality, however misrepresented by the Stoics, or mistaken by those gross pretenders to his sect, who con∣ceived pleasure to consist only in sensuality—they served the two pur∣poses of assembling the philosopher's pupils for instruction, and of furnishing them, as Cowley well expresses it, <Q REND="inline">"with cheap and virtuous luxury."</Q></P>
<P>Nor was this luxury confined mere∣ly to the philosophers—the greatest warriours sought for hours of reflec∣tion in such retirements, and the same hands were employed in the service of agriculture, which had raised and supported the glory of their country.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="145"/>Though utility was chiefly sought for in the gardens of the philosophers, yet Virgil's Description of the Elysian Fields affords a most beautiful specimen of bold imagery and rich design.—<Q REND="inline">"The full green of the woods—the gayly il∣luminated lawn, the grove with the rapid river issuing from it; the dusky thickets, the fresh meads watered with rills, the sequestered vale rendered more solemn by the thick wood, and placid stream."</Q>—His account likewise of the old Corycians gardens makes us greatly lament, that haste should have deprived the world of his master∣ly instructions on a subject he so much admired—Father Harduin, indeed, in his Notes on Pliny, thinks the loss is amply made up to us by his brother Jesuit's Poem on Gardening, which
<PB N="131" REF="146"/>
he puts in competition with the Georgics—an opinion which will be adopted by such critics as feel no dif∣ference between the feeble descrip∣tions of—and the glowing pictures of a <HI>Mason.</HI></P>
<P>In England we have ever, till of late, most servilely copied our me∣thods of gardening from the Italians, French, Flemish, or Dutch, all of whom indeed seem to have offered nothing better in the construction of them, than <Q REND="inline">"clipt hedges, parterres, squirting fountains, true-love knots, and flourishes."</Q>—Sir William Temple seems much delighted with the taste brought in by king William, of which the evergreen quarter at Kensington remains a specimen; and offers Moore Park, in Hertfordshire, as the per∣fectest
<PB N="132" REF="147"/>
figure of a garden he ever saw—indeed he allows there may be other forms admitted wholly irre∣gular, but they must owe their beauty to some extraordinary dispositions of nature.</P>
<P>Lord Bacon does not like images cut out in juniper, or other garden∣stuff—<Q REND="inline">"they be for children," says he—"but can approve of little low hedges cut round like welts, with some pretty pyramids—and in some places fair columns upon frames of carpenter's work."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Pope severely ridicules the in∣vasion of nature, but proposes a place to be copied from, which in his time partook largely of the old absurdi∣ties<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">A full detail of them may be found in Monsr. de Phflaumeren, &amp;c</NOTE>; and whose beauties were but
<PB N="133" REF="148"/>
trifling and puerile—<HI>Stowe,</HI> when com∣pared with Versailles, might demand some share of admiration, but im∣mense would be the distance from that genuine taste which <HI>Shenstone</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vide Letters on Chivalry and Romance.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline">"and nature have brought us ac∣quainted with."</Q></P>
<P>Stowe, indeed, under its modern improvements, may be considered as a very fine specimen of taste and de∣sign, particularly by those who are unacquainted with the exquisite ele∣gance—I had almost said the absolute perfection of lord Scarsdale's.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It seems to me, says lord Kamis, far from an exaggeration, that good professors are not more essential to a college than a spacious garden, which
<PB N="134" REF="149"/>
ought to be tempered with simplicity, rejecting sumptuous and glaring or∣naments—in this respect the univer∣sity of Oxford may be deemed a per∣fect model."</Q>—That the gardens of Oxford may be as useful and effica∣cious as those of ancient Rome, for the purposes of study and application, I will by no means presume to deny—but they are certainly as artful as their buildings—they are formal with∣out unity of design, and complex without variety.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Regularity," says the same au∣thor, "is required in that part of a garden which joins the dwelling-house."</Q>—The beauties of a dwell∣ing-house arise from regularity and proportion, but the works of art and nature have a different destina∣tion
<PB N="135" REF="150"/>
—utility would suffer if the ground was not polished near the dwelling; but this polish, to speak philosophically, should be, I think inversely as the distance.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke doubts <Q REND="inline">"whether beauty be at all an idea belonging to pro∣portion"</Q>—surely the effect produced by it in architecture strikes even a common eye with pleasure—the in∣stance produced from vegetables is not much to the purpose, for it will appear from an accurate survey, that there is more regularity in the parts of flowers than is commonly ima∣gined—their forms indeed are infi∣nitely varied, but in the same plant nature seldom deviates from the laws of proportion, and some of our best botanists have actually founded much
<PB N="136" REF="151"/>
of their systems upon the proportion of the parts—so far therefore from supposing no beauty to result from proportion, we may infer that some part at least of the beauty even of vegetables arises from it.</P>
<P>It is supposed by modern rules that all avenues of course must be cut down, but I am far from thinking, that they may not frequently remain to great advantage—they must be long and wide, and should properly lead to a Gothic castle, tower, or any other large and ancient building.—I know it has been said,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide Essay on Sublime and Beautiful.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline">"that ave∣nues of a moderate length are far grander, and that a true artist should always put a generous deceit on the
<PB N="137" REF="152"/>
spectator"</Q>—but though perspective will lessen greatness in height as it gains in length<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burke.</NOTE>," yet I think it is equally certain that the duke of Mon∣tagu's avenues will be considered as far more grand than those in St. James's Park.</P>
<P>To remedy the ill effects of a straight line, an uniform curve is now adopt∣ed—but alteration is not always im∣provement—and it reminds me of the conduct of the matron, who, to prevent her daughter from drop∣ping her chin into her bosom, threw it up into the air by the aid of a steel collar—Hogarth's Analysis has as yet been read to very little purpose.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Grandeur may possibly be en∣forced by surprize<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Shenstone.</NOTE>,"</Q> but propriety
<PB N="138" REF="153"/>
will suffer for it—a magnificent build∣ing will certainly appear more mag∣nificent after viewing a cottage—but where is the connection between a dairy and a Chinese temple, a rustic seat and a Grecian altar?</P>
<P>We rarely see the whole of a building, with its furniture, confined to one ex∣pression—some minute article is for ever giving us disgust—we view an hermitage for instance;—from the gloomy entrance into it—the crucifix and other emblems placed in order—the straw-bed and old seat—we are so struck with the solemnity of the scene, that we are even in expectation of see∣ing the saint himself approach to meet us—till all of a sudden a modern din∣ing table presents itself to view, and at once destroys all our enthusiasm.—
<PB N="139" REF="154"/>
How different this from the taste of him, who thought of only putting a few rude planks together, and carv∣ing the signs of the zodiac upon them.</P>

<P>* * * * * * * *</P>

<P>Elevations of the different parts of Blenheim-house, when viewed sepa∣rately on paper, are not unworthy of the greatest architect—but, when taken together, the whole appears as a most heavy pile of building—there is no contrast, no relief, though Mr. Pope, perhaps, made too severe a re∣mark when he called it <Q REND="inline">"a quarry of stones above ground."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="155"/>Many of our modern houses have been built from Italian models, with∣out the least reference or conformity to the change of country—on account of heat in Italy, it is necessary to have but few windows—this must ever make a building not only appear heavy, but of course produce a con∣trary effect to that which ought to be sought for in a northern clime.</P>
<P>It was not always a specimen of bad taste in our ancestors that they built their houses in a valley, and moated them round about—safety in those times was principally to be considered—and improvements in mechanics had not then enabled them to live with equal convenience above hill as below.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="156"/>The common opinion at present is, that a house cannot have too much prospect; but I would carefully dis∣tinguish between looking at, and overlooking objects—the summit may be very proper for an observatory, but not always for a dwelling-house; from which all objects, I think, should be seen distinctly, without the aid of a telescope.</P>
<P>* * * * * * * *</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A garden on a flat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Kaims.</NOTE>, it is said, ought to be highly and <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The ornaments must be very carefully suited; for to dress up trifling subjects in grand and ex∣alted expressions, will, in the end, only make them appear the more contemptible.</NOTE> variously ornamented, in order to occupy the mind, and prevent its regretting the insipidity of a uniform plain.—ar∣tificial
<PB N="142" REF="157"/>
mounts in this view are com∣mon—but no person has thought of an artificial walk elevated high above the plain."</Q>—The effect of such a walk is most admirably exemplified in Mr. Gar∣rick's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But I cannot approve of the statue of Shake∣speare—surely it would have been time enough to have represented him in marble or stone, when the very Genius of Shakespeare no longer presided there.</NOTE> polished ground at Hampton.</P>
<P>There will always be a material difference where the master himself is possessed of a fine taste, when com∣pared with that of any hireling—he will more co-operate with nature—he has a better opportunity of be∣coming intimately acquainted with the Genius of his own place—a difference not to be explained on paper per∣haps, but strongly to be felt at the

<P>No wonder that our taste in Eng∣land is still to be condemned, since most of ur largest gardens are laid out by some general undertaker, who, regardless of the peculiar beauties of each situation, introduces the same objects at the same distances in all.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Art should ever be timid of over∣stepping the modesty of nature, for any thing over-done is from the pur∣pose; and though it may make the unskilful admire, cannot but make the judicious grieve—the censure of which, one (as Shakespeare observes to the actors) must in your allow∣ance
<PB N="144" REF="159"/>
yout-weigh a whole theatre of others."</Q></P>
<P>Gardening then, in its highest stage of improvement, is of the nature of an epic poem—the plan must be great, entire, and one. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dryden.</NOTE><Q REND="inline">"Even the least portions must have a reference to the whole.—Nothing of a foreign na∣ture, like the trifling conceits"</Q> which bad poets, or bad gardeners <Q REND="inline">"are always ready to introduce. By which the observer is misled into another sort of pleasure opposite to that which is designed in the general plan. One conduces to the designer's aim, the completing of his work,—the other slackens his pace, diverts him from his way, and locks him up like a knight-errant in an enchanted castle,
<PB N="145" REF="160"/>
when he should be pursuing his main adventure."</Q>—In short, as Pope says,
<Q><L>To build, to plant, whatever you in∣tend,</L>
<L>To rear the column, or the arch to bend,</L>
<L>To swell the terras, or to sink the grot;</L>
<L>In all, let nature never be forgot.</L>

<P>I Have of late forborne to give you any account of my pupil, as I could not give you a very favourable one—he is permitted by his uncle to sit up so late over-night, that he is generally unfit for business all the next day.—A circumstance has lately happened that has given me much uneasiness, though I believe I had more reason to be concerned for his principles than his safety;—a dispute arose the other evening (at cards I suspect), and words ran so high, that it was at length agreed to decide the important mat∣ter by single combat—the heroes met in form at the appointed time—their

pistols missed fire, and the seconds interposed,—and there it ended;—this, however, with the initials of their names—in couched terms—with dis∣tant observations—and short inuen∣does, makes out a very pompous pa∣ragraph for the news-papers.—I have often, in my own mind, attributed the great encrease of duelling to the accounts that are there inserted—of this I am certain, it is one cause at least, if not a principal one; but duelling will always be practised in every country <Q REND="inline">"where the dread of shame is greater than the love of glory"</Q>—for instance, now we read that <Q REND="inline">"a great dispute happened the other day at a certain great assem∣bly" (the Robinhood perhaps, or the Sixpenny Pantheon) "which was

<P>MY situation is every day more and more disagreeable to me,—my pupil has formed connections that will ruin his peace, and destroy my satisfaction,—his fortune is come too soon, and there are vulturs that al∣ready make a prey of him;—his un∣cle says he disapproves of Gaming, but is for ever speaking respectfully of the most abandoned characters of the times; and the young man is taught in the world, that to discharge any debts, but those of honour, is mecha∣nical,—to regard money is below a man of rank, when so many men without any can cut so great a figure;
<PB N="151" REF="166"/>
—it is not, I find, till men have play∣ed deep that they know the resources—then they can borrow money, and get great names to be bound with them; if one does not pay, another must,—but if none can?—they must bilk their creditors by going abroad, unless some lady of great fortune will in the mean time make herself happy by marrying a man of fashion and of the world.—This year then the whole set are again established, they contract new debts, and find out new fools to become security for the payment of them.—Whilst our nobility and gen∣try are thus squandering away their estates, what wonder is it that nego∣ciators and attorneys are purchasing all the principal seats about London—their incomes are made great by
<PB N="152" REF="167"/>
annuities, and their principal is esta∣blished by premiums—these usurers (if they have not the impudence to take seats in parliament themselves, can nevertheless carry on the sale of boroughs for their dependents; and young men thus seduced, are gene∣rally compelled to barter their dearest interests to gain petty places in the excise, perhaps at the foot of the trea∣sury-board, that they may satisfy the rapacious demands of an usurer's clerk.—Interest in the House arises from connections at Arthur's; and popu∣larity is gained in the world from the clerk's brother being a writer in the news—every day new fools admire, and new fools are every day admitted to be plundered.</P>

<P>I Shoot this letter at random—if you have left town for Bath, it will only for a while delay some uneasi∣ness.—Glanville, I had been inform∣ed,
<PB N="157" REF="172"/>
had taken such liberties with your sister, that I was determined to intercept a letter which I supposed to have come from him—it proved to be the enclosed, which I send for your perusal; in the mean time, I have made no other comment but to for∣bid my daughter from ever having any more connections with <HI>that</HI> fa∣mily.—You will see the use that is made of Lord Chesterfield's Letters, which I have read,—his mind, poor man! was a fine flower-garden, over-run with weeds—but he is dead—Mr. Stanhope is likewise dead—they are both dead—to meditate on Death is to pass the severest censure on those epistles—had he reflected on Death as frequently as on the <Q REND="inline">"Graces,"</Q> he would not, I think, have taught his

<SALUTE>My dear Susy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER you left us last night, you cannot think how captain Glan∣ville laughed at your notions of ever∣lasting constancy; and that if once you had given your affections, you was sure they could never be alienat∣ed;—do you know that he swears no woman's affections ever yet served a regular apprenticeship, and that you have arts and graces enough to make
<PB N="159" REF="174"/>
any man wind about and serpentine just as you please.—Apropos—you must read Lord Chesterfield's Letters, which I will send you,—his advice to his son in regard to the world, will hold exactly right as to any woman's management of a husband;—he says very justly <Q REND="inline">"that because man is a rational animal, you must not sup∣pose, therefore, that he always acts rationally; you must watch his weak, unguarded moments, get into his se∣crets, engage his heart, and you will easily <HI>dupe</HI> his understanding."</Q>—Dissi∣mulation is the virtue of the Great, and as you will see from these excel∣lent books, the men not only practise it, but profess it as a science; how then shall we be able to cope with them, if we do not fight with as good
<PB N="160" REF="175"/>
weapons, and play off their own arts against themselves?—Now, for in∣stance, suppose you was to marry an old bachelor—I think you might overthrow all his little systems in a fortnight—to be sure, at times, he would be restive and cross, but then you must suppose he never speaks his real sentiments; and at others he will quietly enough return to his shackles—this is what Mr. Pope means by
<Q><L>" If she rules him, never shows she rules."</L></Q></P>
<P>Why should she show it? for her time to take advantage is only when alone; before company she must al∣ways acquiesce, or the world will not be of her side; and, as Lord Chester∣field
<PB N="161" REF="176"/>
says, the world is always the <HI>dupe</HI> of deceit; and it is, therefore, much better <HI>to seem</HI> than <HI>to be.</HI>"—I knew a lady that adopted this mode of conduct exactly, and was very suc∣cessful,—to be sure, the man was very miserable, and at last, I believe, died of a broken heart; but the world, to this day, are almost unanimously agreed, that she undoubtedly made him one of the very Best of Wives.</P>
<P>For the future, leave all your let∣ters at Mary Cuttle's, and I shall be sure to receive them safe.</P>

<P><PB N="162" REF="177"/>But, my dearest Susy, I must of all things caution you against marry∣ing a Wit—it is a noxious <HI>seeing</HI> ani∣mal, against whom you may play off a whole battery of Tears, Oaths, Sighs, and Protestations, to no effect.—As to money, you must be an oeco∣nomist in <HI>his</HI> pleasures, if you mean to be extravagant in <HI>your own.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Father,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have now been near a week at Bath with my pupil—we lodge at the new hotel, called York house, which is very commodious—indeed more so, I think, than the noble one just fitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Covent-Garden, as there are
<PB N="163" REF="178"/>
more conveniencies under the same roof.—You have heard so much of the neatness and regularity of the build∣ings here, that it is unnecessary for me to expatiate upon them—the Cir∣cus and south front of the Square are beautiful beyond description; but I cannot approve the Crescent, though I must confess I never saw any build∣ing (where so many rules of architec∣ture were violated) that altogether looked so well.—To describe the man∣ners and fashions here, would be far beyond my art, though they have many peculiar to themselves—as in town, people quarrel for places and preferments, and where some great prize is held up to the aspirants; so here, for want of better employment, they have been absolutely compelled
<PB N="164" REF="179"/>
to quarrel for nothing at all—not whether one man should have more popularity or higher distinction than another, but whether he should go up the hill or down to dance his mi∣nuet; and whether the important place of master of the ceremonies should be filled by a native of Ireland or England—nay, to so great a degree has this fashion of quarrelling for no∣thing prevailed amongst the fair sex, that, not content merely with the war of the tongue, they have even des∣cended to blows—this can be attri∣buted to nothing but the extraordi∣nary Fermentation of the waters.</P>
<P>The numberless evils to which man∣kind are always by necessity exposed, should make them, one would think, at all times endeavour to unite in
<PB N="165" REF="180"/>
bands of mutual harmony, and here especially, where so many are in a perpetual state of suffering—yet here, from mere fashion, the strangest infa∣tuation prevails, even amongst inva∣lids, who fly as far as possible from the baths and the shelter of the lower town, to brave the turbulency of the mountains;—the buildings are now extended so far, that, as the Irishman would say, <Q REND="inline">"Bath is run away from itself, it is absolutely gone out of its own town;"</Q> and it may do very well for the healthful to follow it, but sure it is the greatest absurdity in the world that invalids should fly as far as possible from shelter, and from all those advantages for which Bath is so peculiarly and so justly celebrated.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="181"/>The waters (if you believe the Apo∣thecaries) are specifics for all disor∣ders; there is only one that you can possibly die of, which is Obstinacy—this becomes incurable from not tak∣ing advice enough about the use of them, when present, or by removing from the benefit of them too soon—it is true, lady <HI>Skinandbone</HI> has been coughing up her lungs here these two years, but would certainly have re∣covered, had she not <HI>obstinately</HI> refused to stay one fortnight longer; and my lord <HI>Lastlegs</HI> would absolutely have relinquished his crutches in a few days more, and hung them up in the pump-room as the most memo∣rable trophies in it—had he not <HI>obsti∣nately</HI> resolved to change these ever efficacious waters for those of Bristol.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="182"/>In regard to the diversions, there is a play-house here, where the actors (exclusive of Garrick) are in general full as good as those in town—in tra∣gedy they do not always speak with <Q REND="inline">"a good accent and good discretion,"</Q> but I have seen some characters in comedy really supported with great humour and propriety.—The new rooms are elegantly fitted up, and may be better calculated, perhaps, than any others for the purposes of dancing and gaming; but as I never partake of the latter, and not very frequently of the former, they afford me but little or no entertainment—for an evening or two I might have been delighted with the splendor of the appearance, but soon, (as some one expresses it)
<Q><PB N="168" REF="183"/>
<L>" The gay idea palls upon the sense,</L>
<L>" And coldly strikes the mind with feeble bliss."</L></Q>
In short, if I was obliged to give you my opinion of Bath, I should define it to be a place, in which though life, perhaps, may not be passed most use∣fully, it may, nevertheless, be wasted agreeably—amongst wanton widows, and debauched wives, <HI>forsaken</HI> Irish∣men, and <HI>forsaking</HI> men of quality.</P>
<P>This place is so fertile of anecdote, that I could send you volumes from it instead of epistles.</P>

<P>P.S. There is a literary society esta∣blished near Bath by a set of gentle∣men and ladies where many im∣provements

are made on the prizes that were distributed by the ancients—instead of the bay they give jessa∣mine, and instead of laurels artificial nosegays—I have not seen any of the literary productions, but hear there will soon be published a most excel∣lent didactic poem on the beautiful arch of lady Horatia Pedant's auburn eye brow.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Woburn, <DATE>Sat. Night.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS morning put a period to all my happiness—your sister—your lost unhappy sister is fled with Glan∣ville!—The care, the affection that I
<PB N="170" REF="185"/>
have ever shewn for her—all the prin∣ciples of virtue and religion that I have ever endeavoured to inculcate, have availed her nothing, and she is fled at last with Glanville.—From her infancy I have laboured to prove my∣self a kind and indulgent father; and now when I meant to reap the har∣vest of my toil—behold, this is my reward!—but I myself have been the cause—I have given up too far,—but as she had lost her mother, and my notions of life were supposed to be too contracted, the opinions of others have weighed against me, and I have relaxed my own principles to her ruin.—I have got so far on my road to town, but can hear no tidings which way they took—nor is it needful for me to inquire—I am rather flying
<PB N="171" REF="186"/>
from myself than in pursuit of her—she is for ever lost—she's ruined—she fled, alas! with Glanville.—Had his intentions been honourable, whence this secrecy?—but nothing can excul∣pate her—she knew the depth of mi∣sery into which I should be plunged, and, had she thought of marriage, would have saved my desperation.—Glanville would not marry her—he owns no ties of either honesty or ho∣nour—he could violate all engage∣ments (if he made any) and the infa∣tuated world would call it Gallantry.—All her principles were polluted—she was deaf to shame, as well as virtue, who could dare to triumph thus over the weakness of a father's heart.—Delay not, my son, to seek—to inquire—to upbraid—it is too late, alas! to
<PB N="172" REF="187"/>
recall,—and should chance or fortune cast her in your way—reproach her with her infamy—tell her that she has violated her duty to herself—to me—and if there needs an aggravation of her crime—to her God—that no pe∣nance can obliterate the stain—that she has pulled down ruin on herself and on her father, and that his tears will be drops of vengeance on her head for ever:—tell her—no, no, this may be too harsh,—tell her only that if she would return—I could forgive her.</P>

<P>I Have now no hopes of seeing you before I leave town, for I have at last got some faint intelligence of your sister, and shall set off immediately for Dover—should she have set sail (for I hear he is carrying her to France) I shall then relinquish all pursuit, and leave her to the protection of that power that can amend her heart, and assuage my sorrows—when you per∣ceive me thus torn and distracted with my grief, harbour not a thought that your sister was ever dearer to me than yourself—she is lost—and now awak∣ens all my anxiety, <Q REND="inline">"but thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine."</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LET those only talk of bearing up against afflictions, who have never felt them—there may be such situa∣tions that no principles can fortify the mind against, and under which the greatest and the best must ever fall—into such a one is your unhappy fa∣ther plunged.—I pursued my journey so much faster than I expected, (for man neither knows his weakness nor his strength) that I thought by night I should even reach Dover, but gain∣ing no tidings, I began to sink under my fatigue, and to hope only from time for that aid which philosophy could not afford me.—As I was pass∣ing through a small village, I saw all the people running out with unfeel∣ing
<PB N="175" REF="190"/>
curiosity after a poor wretch, who they told me was falling into labour—the officers, I found, were persecu∣ting her, to save expences, to the next parish, and had refused her not only harbour, but relief—no situation can dispense with our humanity—I deter∣mined, therefore, to allot some few shillings to succour, at least, if not to save this victim of distress;—as I came nearer the rabble stopped, and, for a while, I even forgot my own miseries to contemplate hers—I in∣veighed against their cruelty in the bitterest terms—broke through the crowd, and insisted on their affording her some relief—they told me <Q REND="inline">"there was no occasion, for the woman en∣treated only for to die"</Q>—I demanded that they should convey her to the
<PB N="176" REF="191"/>
next ale-house,—that I would leave my watch—my money;—my aid to carry her into it, alas! I was unable to give, for she was now from agonies, become an object too shocking for humanity to behold;—I was, at length, responsible for her charges, and the crowd were indifferent to her distress.—As soon as they had borne her in, I entreated her to take comfort—be∣wailed her miseries—assured her, that if either by leaving my watch or some money, I could procure her cordial medicine or assistance, I would relieve her—she looked up wistfully in my face, and told me she wished me only to forgive.—Think, my dearest Charles, what must be my feelings, when I found this object of misery to be no other than my poor unhap∣py
<PB N="177" REF="192"/>
daughter, whom that villain Glan∣ville had thus basely deserted—for a while, I fear, I was unable to yield that assistance as a father, that she would have found from me as a friend;—but recovering my tranquillity—I assured her that all resentments were lost in her distress; that I had even forgot she had offended me, and that if she could recover—<Q REND="inline">"Alas! says she, it is now too late, for I have languish∣ed whole days from want—without friend—without money—and without that comfort that innocence could have afforded me;"</Q> but that to see me once again was more than her fondest wishes ever formed; nor had she an∣other hope than by the blessing of a fa∣ther to look up for the forgiveness of her God."—But here I pause, for
<PB N="178" REF="193"/>
the scene became too affecting, and I believe I was carried away from her before death put a period to her dis∣tress.—Fondly bewailing her un∣timely fate, I sit by her faded corse, and shed the tender tribute of unavail∣ing tears—thinking that I still see her only as asleep—that I shall again enjoy the sweets of her converse, and that we shall again be happy—happy, in∣deed, we may be in another world, but never more in this—but I blush to refer myself only to futurity, when on earth I can feel no more comfort—Oh! Charles, think not that I mean to vindicate wrong, or that my fond∣ness gets the better of my principles—I know her errors, but will not, with a malicious world, think this the only fault that a woman can never
<PB N="179" REF="194"/>
expiate—it is not, believe me, an hor∣ror at the crime, but the pride of life that begets these distinctions. Let the cold, the selfish, and the unfriendly speak rigidly of her offences, a father could feel only for her distress.—When this first burst of my grief be∣gins to subside, I shall endeavour to take some measures for her removal; for at all adventures I resolve to bury her at Marleston, not with those ho∣nours, perhaps, as if adorned with virtue; yet, nevertheless, with a de∣cency that is due to the unfortunate; and lest <Q REND="inline">"ill tongues should hereafter be too busy with her fame"</Q> I will in∣scribe something like the following epitaph upon her tomb—<Q><PB N="180" REF="195"/>Stop—gentle maid—whoever thou art;<LB/>She that lies buried here, was once<LB/>as fair and amiable as Thyself.<LB/>Whilst she was innocent, she was happy;<LB/>but by yielding to the seduction of Man,<LB/>and of the World,—she was cut off in<LB/>the early bloom of youth,<LB/>to deter Thee<LB/>from following her<LB/>Example.</Q></P>
