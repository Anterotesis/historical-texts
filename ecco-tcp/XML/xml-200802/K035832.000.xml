<P> Why, lord, I tell you, they knows no more about the respect due to us Gentlemen Soldiers—why damme they thinks us fit for nothing but a cat-o'-nine tails, and to be hired out and shot at for five∣pence a day.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rif.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's true, as you say, Plunder; but then who have we to thank for it?—our superiors—Merit is not

rewarded—Come, my lads, here's confusion to the first inventor of jumping over heads. For my part, I say lit∣tle; but if I had been rewarded as I ought, for my be∣haviour in that there scrimmage!—Why now I suppose you have heard of poor old Blenheim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Live.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heard of him!—he is one of the disgraces of his country. There is no general to whom I would pay more respect; descended from an antient family, he inhe∣rired only a brown musket; and after having distinguished himself in most of the Great Duke of Marlborough's▪ wars, with a bravery, the admiration of every one, is, at the age of sixty-five, nobly rewarded by a brevet for Chel∣sea Hospital, whither, I am told, he is now on his way, and where his wife, a washer-woman, and his daughter a seamstress, are waiting his arrival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor old Blenheim!—Why do you think if as how I had been a general, and Blenheim had served under me, that I would have broke his poor old heart, by put∣ting a parcel of boys before him, because one was my Lord this thing's footman, and t'other carried my Lady that thing's lap dog—</P>

<P>Why to be sure there must be something wrong going on; but for my part, if they did not tax dogs, and horses, and servants, and enclose commons, they might do what they pleased, for ought I cared. What do you say, old Pedagogue?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Plun.</SPEAKER>
<P>You think, old Periwig!—for me, if I was commanding officer about and concerning the affairs of this nation, every rank and file should be made either co∣lonel or general.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Come, come, you are too violent; those at the head of affairs know when and how to manage matters a devilish deal better than you can dictate to them.</P>

<P>Ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Live.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem, my old friend, to find something pleasant in our conversation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pleasant!—Pardon me, Sir, not very pleasant, but light and airy as may be expected at your time of life—You seem to govern the nation over your bottle, and to amend the state and legislature at every bumper: you contend that others are neglected; that you are neglected yourselves. This is a partial evil not to be lamented; and if you are soldiers, you ought to be ashamed of such pal∣try considerations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Live.</SPEAKER>
<P>In your days, my friend, this might be good doctrine for aught I know; but now the case is altered, and every man thinks only of his own interest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blen.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the worse; and if the case is altered, you are properly requited; neglect ought to be your por∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>How's this do you insult us in return for our hospitality?</P>
</SP>

<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Blen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Far from it; I deal with you as a friend, and pay you with honest truth for the shelter you afford me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Live.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is something like wisdom in your re∣marks, old gentleman, but mix'd, I think, with rather too much spleen. This public spirit, which you require, is certainly a virtue, but by no means a duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blen.</SPEAKER>
<P>In your station 'tis a duty—the very founda∣tion of every military virtue.—Whoever dedicates him∣self to the service of his country, should consider his country unable to requite his services; for in fact, that which he devotes to the public good, is above all price.—No more of these complaints then—'Tis una∣voidable in counties like ours, that bravery must some∣times fall into neglect, otherwise there would be no sub∣ordination; for how could you reward as you ought an English army, unless every one could command in chief?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Live.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray who are you that talk to us in that stile?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Blen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blenheim.</P>

<P>Blenheim!—</P>

<P>Blenheim—that poor old Chelsea Pensioner, for whom but now you seemed to have so much compas∣sion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Live.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you who have been treated so ungrate∣fully, inculcate the principles of public virtue, and disin∣terested love of our country?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blen.</SPEAKER>
<P>From whom then do you expect to hear your duty—from these gentlemen, who never saw fire but in the corner of a chimney? 'Tis true I have been wrong'd, neglected, taken up, imprisoned, accused of violating the
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
King's rights, in the very moment I protected them, and that by the very man whose life I saved in battle, he who is possessed of a considerable place in the revenues, while I am groveling in this abject condition; but what signi∣fies all this? the actions of my life may be effaced from the memory of a Court, but the memory of mankind will be more retentive, and if it should not, I have the conscious remembrance, and that is sufficient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thick.</SPEAKER>
<P>A queer old codger this!—Come my honest fellows; I believe the skittle pins wait for us; good bye old rugged and tough, we'll come and smoke a pipe with you at Chelsea.</P>

<SPEAKER>Blen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I longed to see you, Sir—you are allied to a worthy young man—but I am afraid that by visiting me you will involve yourself in a danger you are not aware of—in the ruin of a man proscribed.—If a real criminal is punished, he will soon be forgotten, but if a man of blameless integrity is injured, he will be persecuted with unrelenting hatred, for the very mention of his name is a satire on the times, and his existence is to the con∣science of his enemies an unceasing remembrancer of guilt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear your words have too much truth in them; and yet in the course of human contingencies it must happen, that men of worth will occasionally be plunged in misfortune.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="30" REF="32"/>

<P>But ought that consideration to check the no∣ble ardour of a soldier? the poorest pensioner in this charity has his moments of exultation when he recollects he has fought bravely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blen.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, a love of glory is a noble passion!—but do you think the pleasure that springs from conquest has a sincere and lasting charm in it?—Alas! when a de∣luge of human blood bids the tears of natural affection flow in rivers round the land, can the mind in that situ∣ation taste of joy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Live.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never.—Yet surely when this blood is spilt in their defence, of whom nature intended us the guardians, though our sensibility may be shocked, our honour can never be stained.—In my mind, defence and reprisals are the only justifiable measures in war, while ambition is but another name for massacre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blen.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have distinguished right.—But in your pursuits after fame you will have a worse enemy to guard against than ambition—Envy!—which when you have done your duty, will make even accidents a ground of impeachment against you.—Have you done all that was possible?—You ought to have done bet∣ter.—The charge is aggravated, and the good you have done dwindles into nothing—your downfall is effected, and some worthless wretch is sure to rise upon your ruins.</P>

<P>Nay, I must insist, upon your duty, that you'll not interfere; assisting the father is one thing; but con∣senting to my son's marriage with the daughter, is an∣other; her birth, to be sure, is as good as yours; and fortune I do not regard; but—</P>

<P>Aye, aye, don't mince the matter, speak what you think of him; I assure you nobody would be so likely to blame him, for doing wrong, as I should.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Est.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wrong, Sir, you shall judge yourself whether he has done wrong or no: after all poor Blenheim's suf∣ferings, I am sure I shall never forget when his dear arm was shot, through and through, at Fontenoy; I was waiting, with some other gentlemen's wives, upon a bag∣gage-waggon; and when he was brought home, says he, wife, this is a smart wound; but I am glad I received it, for it saved my captain's life; and don't you think, after this, that he must be the cruellest, hard▪hearted old rogue—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! certainly, I never met with such an infa∣mous piece of business in my life; but, now, what plan would you have me pursue to make him do justice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Est.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, if you'll be so good, I'd have you go to him, tell him what a villain he is; and that, if he ever expects to sleep quietly in his bed, he'll come here di∣rectly, and reward my poor husband for all he has under∣gone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You may depend upon me—he shall be righted; and I don't doubt but there are many years of happiness yet in store for you.</P>

<P>Your father has been ill-treated, matters have been falsely represented to me, and he has severely suf∣fered for it; I mean to atone for my error, but I hear it is expected that I shall countenance an extravagant pas∣sion which, it seems, my only son has thought proper to entertain for you.</P>
