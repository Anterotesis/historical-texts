<HEAD>TO Mr. WILLIAM POWELL,</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following Pieces are the Production of my leisure Hours; they are imper∣fect to a Degree, too full of Expletives and Incongruity; nothing cou'd have induc'd me to have publish'd them now, but my having promis'd them my Friends these two Years; and rather than they should accuse me of being worse than my Word, I have ventur'd to expose myself to the Censure of the World, and the Judgment of the Re∣viewers; but as they are my first Produc∣tions, I could wish to be overlook'd, on the Promise they shall be my last,—when I wrote them indeed I had the Vanity (like all
<PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
young Authors) to think I was smitten with the Muses, but now to my Grief I too clear∣ly see that I have smitten them with a Stab of Disgrace; having disturb'd and made muddy the peerless Stream of <HI>Helicon.</HI> My Pretensions to Letters must appear the highest Presumption, from many Reasons; first from my humble and obscure Situation, and secondly from my being depriv'd of a Classical Education, &amp;c. for great Scholars, like great Rogues, can take such Liberties as little ones dare not think of;—I have only this one Consolation; that as my Re∣putation as an Author is but little, I have the less to loose;—I don't doubt but this will be an unwelcome Offering; but I have presum'd to inscribe it to you, because I know you bear me that Friendship, that (were you sure to derogate by such a Re∣ception) you would take it as it was meant, the only Acknowledgment I had left, in Re∣turn for the many Favours I have receiv'd, and the good Endeavours you have made to serve me, tho' they unfortunately prov'd ineffectual. Dependance on Theatres are as fatal, and as transitory as at Court; and the
<PB N="vii" REF="9"/>
Promises of a Manager are as baseless as those of a Statesman; so fond are all Degrees of apeing their Betters; this I have a Right to speak, being prompted both by Fact and Experience; I cannot say indeed I had ever any great Dependance at Court; But to my Sorrow I know it, and at this Moment feel, the fatal Consequence of depending on Theatres; and the alluring Promises (bound with the sacr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Ties of Honour and Friend∣ship) of Managers,— had I not been told by my Friends (and these too, in my Opinion, the best Judges of the age, such as Mr. <HI>Churchill,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Cibber,</HI> and your∣self) that I was possess'd of some Requisites for the Stage, I had never attempted it; prompted by this, and conscious of the Right, I as an Individual, had to an Attempt, and strenghten'd by the Obligations that the Theatres, when in a drooping State, were once under to my Father, for his many excellent and receiv'd Entertainments; I was flatter'd into Hope and Expectation, giving up all my other Connections in Life, and sacrificing all other Interests to the seeming Friendship and solemn Promises of Mr.
<PB N="viii" REF="10"/>
<HI>L</HI>—; who, like a Sorcerer, led me into a Labyrinth of Delusion, and left me to bewail my Situation in Oblivion. Could I but re∣call the whole two Years Expence, the Loss of Time, and prevent the inevitable Destru∣ction of a dear and tender Family, I would forgive the heavy Load of Anxiety, the daily Expectations, and the hourly Disap∣pointments that I met with; their Frowns of Authority, their Shafts of Impunity, their Stare of Despotism, and their Sneers of Contumely; all these I could forget, but that my Wounds still bleed, and Pain begets Remembrance.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Morning to you, Doctor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Blandford,</HI> your very humble Servant; how do you, this dull Morning? I'Gad I was threatening to go to Bed again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>To Bed, Doctor! What before you are well up? Of have your medical Studies kept you from sleeping all Night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—but I have got a nasty something hanging on my Spirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're safe enough, you know; a Dog and a Doctor, know how to choose their Physic.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>An excellent Compliment!
<STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>
As your Kind of Gentry know how to choose the best Wh—res.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your Pardon, Doctor, there is no best in the Case; the best of the bad, is not worth choosing; but if you have no more Skill in Medicines, than I have in Filles de Joye, I would not give a Fig for your Practice. Talking of the Fair, puts me in Mind of poor Miss <HI>Dan∣bury</HI>; never was so good a Heart so much depress'd: With blooming Beauty, and a Soul angelic, she drags a Life of Woe, and keeps the Shield of Virtue on her Arm; while her Hand rejects with Scorn, the tempting Bribes of gay Debauchery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, you young Rogue, you've try'd her, I suppose? But she knew you had nothing to give her but Promises, and so thought in that Case she might as well put on the Prude as not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me tell you, Doctor, that's a damn'd ill-na∣tured Surmise, and did I not think you spoke it more out of Raillery, than Sincerity, I should for ever hold the most contemptible Opinion of you as a Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you did not think I was in Earnest, did you, <HI>Ned</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—If I had!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'd have been for running me through the Body, I suppose; but I assure you the World says strange Things of the Girl.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, it is a strange World, Doctor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but from the many pitiful Tricks, that I have detected her in myself, I am determined to have no∣thing to do with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would have had (it is well known) if she would have let you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's for you now! that's like her, I did ima∣gine, indeed, (when I ceas'd to support the ungrateful Hussy, in her flaunting Expectations) she would raise some scandalous Report or other, to hurt me in my Character and Business. Oh, the Jade! had it not been for the great Regard I had for the Father, she should have shifted for herself long ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Regard for her Father!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, my Regard for her Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why what great Regard could you have for him, when I have often heard you say he died five hundred Pounds in your Debt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why tho' he was an unfortunate Man, he was an honest one, as far as his Circumstances would go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's one of the most grateful Confessions I ever heard you make of any Man before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had ever the most favourable Opinion of every Man, and was always more inclined to hide, than expose their Misfortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's well again; so shall your own Words con∣vict you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if you were inclined to think the most fa∣vourably of Man, you must in Reason think the same of Woman Kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good again; and what has poor Miss <HI>Danbury</HI> done, that every Thought of her is bad, and your best Opinion but a fordid one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, but Facts, my dear <HI>Ned,</HI> are Facts, and the general and perpetual Complaints of the World are Cir∣cumstances too glaring to be overlook'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>What the World says in those Cases, ought never to be regarded; for such Reports generally arise from the inventive Goffips of a Tea table; and there is a Species of Barbarity that reigns predominant in the Breasts of the low-minded Vulgar. Whenever they perceive an Object of Merit, that was once their Envy, under the least Misfor∣tune, they are never so happy as when doing that Person
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>
some secret Injury, or till, by some malignant Conspiracy, they have reduced them to a State of Adversity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you say that this is her Case?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, truly, for it is well known that Miss <HI>Dan∣bury</HI> was (scarce three Years ago) the Admiration and En∣vy of the Country for ten Miles round, and now, the ve∣riest Drab that was wont to think herself honoured with a Court'sy from her, will, with a provoking Sneer, tell her to shorten her Furbelows; and since they have found her whole Dependence is on you, they have injured her, by imposing on you some malicious Falsehood, on the mere Supposition of which, I find you are determined to com∣pleat her Misery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Mr. <HI>Blandford,</HI> it is not for that entirely, but from the very great Expence she has been to me of late, and as I find that hurts my Circumstances considerably, it is a Duty I owe myself not to let her ruin me entirely. I have made her many good Offers; nay I made Interest for her to a Gentleman and Lady who were going to <HI>South Ca∣rolina,</HI> where they told her she would have the greatest Op∣portunity in the World of making her Fortune; all which she ungratefully rejected; and as I am under no Manner of Obligation to her, or hers, I think I have done for her al∣ready what hundreds would not have done; in Truth therefore she must now shift for herself as well as she can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Girl! I can't blame her; 'tis strange so great a Tenderness Mr. <HI>Danbury</HI> had for her when living, that he did not make some Provision for her at his Death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the Astonishment of every one, but what could a Man do that had it not in his Power?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is still more strange, for every Body thought him a Man of Property.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, <HI>Ned,</HI> you see with what Art some People can support a false Reputatian, and when their Affairs come once to be laid open to Inspection, many a worthy Family that has trusted their All in their Hands, from too good an Opinion of their Circumstances, find too often a broken Back in the Consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I wish the dear Creature was better provi∣ded for, or that I had it in my Power to make her the hap∣piest Woman in the Universe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>How wou'd you do that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I wou'd endeavour to do it, by marrying her, and setting her above the Frowns of the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a promising Dame you wou'd get for your Pains.—Ah, <HI>Ned.</HI> I pity you I must confess.—But Plague on it, if you are so wonderfully smitten with the Wench, why don't you marry her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I am not at present possess'd of those Re∣quisites, that would be essential to our Happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a little Money, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>You suppose right; wou'd the kind Powers be pleas'd to take that dear, pious, mercenary Uncle to them∣selves, I should be glad to fill up his Vacancy here below, without any further Consideration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, my dear Boy, but your Uncle takes a deal of Care of his Constitution, and is as likely to live thirty Years longer, as yourself; you shou'd have taken better Care of the last five Hundred, <HI>Ned.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I confess if I had been as penurious as you, I probably might have increas'd it to a Thousand by this Time; and neither have done myself nor any body else any Good with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you had it now I don't think you wou'd do your∣self much Good with it by marrying Miss <HI>Danbury.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are determined, I find, to do her no Good either by Word or Deed; and therefore, Doctor, I beg you wou'd not give me any more of your cool Opinions; since you cannot give her a good Word, you shall not dare to give her a bad one in my Company without the warmest Resentment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, mighty well then; there let it drop— there let it drop; in the Name of Goodness may not one talk of Matrimony without having one's brains beat out.— Zounds I wish—I could meet with a good wife with all my Heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a special good Husband you'd make, if you thought you cou'd <HI>kill</HI> her with <HI>kindness.</HI>—If I thought you serious, now, I would help you to a good one; but what will you give me for my trouble?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give you?—What do you call a good one tho'?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Lady is not very handsome to be sure, nor yet very young; but she is worth a confounded deal of
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>
Money I assure you, and such a Woman can have nothing had about her I am persuaded, at least in your Eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>She cannot be bad that is certain, if she is rich▪ (for Money was never bestow'd on any but those that were good, and knew how to keep it when they had got it.) But how rich do you think the Lady may be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I have heard my Uncle say, that she is worth Ten Thousand Pounds at least; but don't take the least notice of it to him; for he wants to get her himself; only she thinks him rather too old. — Now such a middle∣ag'd Man as you, wou'd be the very Thing. Besides she was asking me who was our best Inoculator in this Neigh∣bourhood. I told her I knew a very infallible one, meaning you; and she has been teazing me about you ever since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Odds, so, but that is one of the most lucky Circum∣stances that cou'd have happen'd, in my Favour. Where does the Lady live, and I'll pay her a visit to-morrow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no, not for the World, she has boarded some Time in a private Family in this Neighbourhood; but as the major Part of them have not had the Smallpox, it is to be kept a profound Secret.</P>
</SP>

<P>Tell the Gentleman I'll wait on him immediately.

I faith <HI>Ned</HI> if you can bring this matter to bear, I'll make you a Present the greatest Gentleman in the Land wou'd not refuse.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that is a Pill, or a Dose of Physic, to take when I am sick, to make me the more so; for I know he has neither the Spirit or Resolution to do any thing like a Man; the yellow Mammon has caught his Soul, and Ava∣rice holds his Purse Strings. I don't know what the Hopes of getting this pretended Wife may do;—but if he shou'd put me to the Proof, I don't know where I shou'd find one that would chuse to throw herself away upon him. I must do something to deceive him, hey? let me see, Egad I think I cou'd do very well for an Old Maid myself; — An excellent thought! — but what shall I do for a Dress? — a Plague on't I have Interest enough among the fair Sex to get such a Thing as that to be sure. — The Old Maid and her Money is the Thing yet; Bait for Gudgeons with
<PB N="7" REF="17"/>
Worms, and a Miser with Gold, and you are sure to catch 'em. I'll e'en go after the Doctor, and tell him I am going to the Lady directly.

<P>So <HI>Ned</HI> is gone after the Lady.

<P>A very bad one, Sir, for aught I know, as she is a kind of a Sweet-heart of my old Master's, and is worth a Deal of Money; I don't know, if you shou'd find out where the Lady lives, but you may endeavour to rival him; the Consequence wou'd then be very bad on my Side, I believe.</P>

<P>But in the Course of his Examination it wou'd come to my Turn, and then I must confess, or tell him a Lie, which I will not do for you, or any Body else, and therefore, Sir, to avoid any Apprehensions of that Kind, it will be the best Way to say nothing at all about it.</P>

<P>I'M glad my fair one approves of my intended Stratagem, however; but her Father's Letter astonishes me; it is strange she never shew'd it me before; he informs her, (but three Hours before his Death) that he had provided for her very handsomely; instead of that we find her desti∣tute and forlorn; and, by what I understand, <HI>Pittem</HI> was the only person that attended him in his latest Hours. 'Sdeath, there must have been foul Play. <HI>Pittem</HI> is either an errant Knave, or her Father must have deceived her; but when I compare the two Characters, the first Surmise carries with it many glaring Circumstances, and the latter seems improbable; I will not rest till I am satisfied.</P>

<P>No, Doctor, though I received a letter from the Gentleman (since I saw you last) importuning me in the most pressing Manner, to introduce him; yet, from the Regard I bear you, I was determined to give you the Pre∣ference, and intended to have waited a Day or two till you had better consider'd the Matter.</P>

<P>O my dear Sir, accidents are unavoidable; Perhaps you are in Love Sir; if so it may be easily ac∣counted for; that Rogue <HI>Cupid</HI> generally leads his People blindfold, for we often read of a Gentleman or a Lady's falling into a River, or, (from the meer Imagination they are loosing their Loves) tumbling out of a two Pair of Stairs Window.</P>

<P>I do not imagine you did, Madam, but give me Leave to say, it is a very sensible, a nay a very excellent Observation indeed, Madam.—What a charming Tongue she has, if I should loose her now, I shall wish I'd never seen her.

<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No to be sure, Madam, I had not the Vanity to imagine it was Love. Pray, Madam, what might it be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Buz.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Inoculation, Sir;—I have been under the greatest Apprehensions of catching the Small-pox, for this Month past, it being almost so generally spread about the Country; and as my Cousin <HI>Ned</HI> has persuaded me that you have discovered a most infallible Method of eradicating that malignant Disorder, I have made bold to visit you on that Business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam I am infinitely oblig'd to Mr. <HI>Blandford</HI> for his kind and generous Recommendation, and more so to you, Madam, for imbibing so good an Opinion of me. —But I cou'd wish, pardon me, Madam, I cou'd wish you wou'd consent to evade the Subject of Inoculation a few Minutes, and dwell a little longer on that more excellent Topic, Love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Buz.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir if you can convince me that the Danger of the one is not more imminent to me, than the other is to you, I shall very readily comply with your Request.</P>

<P>Then, Madam, I fancy I shall prevail with you.</P>

<P>Does your Apprehensions of the Small-pox give you at present any real Pain?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Buz.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I can't say it does, Sir.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Buz.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How can that be, Sir, even supposing me the Object of your Affections, since both Passions proceed from Fear, yours of losing what you never had, and there it ends. Mine, of catching that I wou'd not wish to have; which may possibly end in Death? But however, Sir, since you are so very desirous of continuing the Theme of
<PB N="20" REF="30"/>
Love, I'll e'en set aside my Apprehensions a few Minutes, and listen to you.—I fancy it will be best to get that Part over first, least I should be discovered before I nail him for the two hundred.

<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Madam, the very illustrious Character Mr. <HI>Bland∣ford</HI> has often given you to me, made me almost in Love with you before you came; but since I have seen you, I am in Love indeed, to find you so far exceed the best of Characters.</P>
</SP>

<P>Sir, I am infinitely obliged to my Cousin <HI>Ned</HI>; but must confess he has always been very liberal in his Commendations of you.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am equally obliged to Mr. <HI>Blandford,</HI> Madam, but am afraid you have found that he has said more in my Behalf, than you find true.</P>

<P>I'm glad on't Sir, and should be very glad if it were in my Power to make you always so.</P>

<P>Then, Sir, you may depend upon it, I will do my utmost.</P>

<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose, Madam, nothing would make me so but your own Person and Liberty.</P>
</SP>

<P>Sir, I should have no Objectoin of resigning them both, were I sure they would make you happy.</P>

<P>I would venture my Happiness, nay my Life, Madam, on such a Resignation; if you would venture to give me your Hand on this fair Promise, I shall be com∣pleatly happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Buz.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then here it is with all my Heart; for to tell you the Truth, Sir, I have long been tired of the Ap∣pellation of old Maid, and most terribly afraid of dying one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>Takes her Hand and kisses it with great Eagerness.</HI>)</STAGE>
And I do assure you, Madam, the musty and fulsome Name of old Bachelor has been no less hateful to me, nor do I care how soon I get rid of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Buz.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Though I can't help thinking but I have made too brief a Capitulation; Forwardness in Women generally gives Disgust. But to be plain, you must know, Sir, I hate to be courted; the Hey day of Youth is over in me; about sixteen or seventeen Years, I us'd to take a Pleasure in denying, on purpose to obtain a Number of new and useless Solicitations, 'till at last I teaz'd my Lovers out of Patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well I declare to you, Madam, I have been serv∣ed so twenty times, for I never payed my Addresses to a young Lady in my Life, but before I could settle my Af∣fections, she tired my Patience with a feign'd Coyness, giving me the greatest Encouragement To-day, and To∣morrow wou'd hardly look at me, 'till I had dangled from Morning to Night after her, and all the Excuse she had for it was,—I should not think her too forward, but I soon let her see I could be as capricious as herself, and so broke her Acquaintaintance with a cool billet-doux, and fare∣well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Buz.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I can't help thinking this Visit was an arch Design of my Cousin <HI>Ned</HI>'s, and to get us acquainted with no other View, than what it has turn'd out; He's a strange Creature! he has great good Nature, but it is great Pity he
<PB N="22" REF="32"/>
has not a little more Oeconomy in regard to his Pocket; mo∣ney's like chaff to him, it flies with every wind that blows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>O that's an unpardonable Sin, Madam, in my Opi∣nion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Buz.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And in mine too, Sir; though his great Fau't is, I believe, being too charitable; he pretends that when he sees a Friend or a Neighbour in Distress, he can't sleep 'till he has reliev'd 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, that's an abominable Fault; for what is ano∣ther's Poverty to me? let every one take Care of them∣selves I say. Besides, giving to the Poor is the most un∣profitable Way of bestowing Charity in the World; you are sure of never having any Return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Buz.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir, very true; I've been obliged to lend him Money, at different Times, to the Amount of two hun∣dred Pounds, though it went very much against me to do it, had he not been a pretty near Relation, I wou'd not have done it on any Account. But he has certainly a deal of good Nature; and I know too that he'll pay when he has it, for I lent him a hundred and twenty Pounds before, and I must say he pay'd me very honestly again, with good Interest into the Bargain. But if I could get him to pay the good two hundred Pounds he owes me now, I should hardly risk any more with him, I think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm glad to find you are come to that Resolution, Madam, I assure you—once or twice a Person may do a good natur'd Thing, but I'd have 'em beware of the third Time, least they be flung at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Buz.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He has now given me a Note of two hundred Pounds on you, Sir; I'm amaz'd to think what he can have done for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it was a particular Kind of Business to be sure, Madam, the Purport of which I shall make bold to acquaint you with some other Opportunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Buz.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have no very great Relish for Secrets, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are not a Native of this Country I am sure, Madam; for the People here make it as great a Me∣rit to discover the Secrets of their Neighbours, as the As∣tronomers do to discover new Spots in the Sun, and take as great a Pride in declaring 'em to the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Buz.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's a very despicable Character. Pray what Time of the Day is it? I must begin to think of going,
<PB N="23" REF="33"/>
I promis'd to call on a Lady in my Way home, upon some very particular Business. I should be glad now to know your Terms of Inoculation. Perhaps it is not convenient just now, Sir, to pay the Note I mentioned.</P>

<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y Tale I take from Times of old,</L>

<L>When Pride walk'd threadbare and des∣pis'd,</L>
<L>When Folks were better exercis'd</L>
<L>Than now-a-days, when Broils and Strife</L>
<L>Defiles the Narra' of each Life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Country Villa, near a Green,</L>
<L>Inhabitants but twice Sixteen;</L>
<L>An honest 'Squire held the Hall,</L>
<L>Surrounded by a Turfen Wall,</L>
<L>The Friend and Landlord of 'em all.</L>
<L>A Neighbourhood so well inclin'd,</L>
<L>So simple, honest, and so kind,</L>
<L>Each try'd his Neighbour to excell,</L>
<L>In Friendship and in doing well.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="78" REF="87"/>
<L>As soon as Morning Dawn appear'd,</L>
<L>Or early Chanticleer was heard,</L>
<L>E'er the fond Herds began to feed,</L>
<L>Or Faires fled the rising Mead.</L>
<L>The thrifty Villagers arose,</L>
<L>And from the Bed of sweet Repose</L>
<L>They met the Labours of the Day</L>
<L>And chearful, sung the Time away;</L>
<L>At Eventide, when Work was done;</L>
<L>They all return'd at setting Sun,</L>
<L>And met upon the Plain—with Glee</L>
<L>They pip'd and danc'd upon the Lee;</L>
<L>There in a lowly simple State</L>
<L>They felt the joys that fly the Great,</L>
<L>No Load of Conscience gall'd their Breast,</L>
<L>Content and Labour gave 'em rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas now the rosy Morn of <HI>May,</HI></L>
<L>When <HI>Flora</HI> in her best Array</L>
<L>Bedeck'd each little rising Hill</L>
<L>With Cowslips sweet, or Daffodil;</L>
<L>A May-pole tall with Garlands hung,</L>
<L>And rows of Birds Eggs neatly strung,</L>
<L>Was plac'd upon a verdant Green,</L>
<L>A Tribute to the Morning's Queen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each Rustic summons forth his Fair</L>
<L>And round the Pole they all repair.</L>
<L>The 'Squire 'mongst the rest arose,</L>
<L>As 'twas his Custom to dispose</L>
<L><PB N="79" REF="88"/>Of various Gifts, upon that Day,</L>
<L>And gave good Ale and Cakes away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Twelve Garlands one small Hillock grac'd,</L>
<L>In simple Order each was plac'd.</L>
<L>The honest 'Squire now propos'd</L>
<L>That each by Choice shou'd be dispos'd;</L>
<L>Said ev'ry Swain had equal Right</L>
<L>To any Garland now in Sight</L>
<L>And all beneath, if ought shou'd be,</L>
<L>To claim his Right and Property.</L>
<L>For each some little Prize contain'd,</L>
<L>So that the Loser something gain'd,</L>
<L>Tho' some were greater than the rest,</L>
<L>Each Swain now strove to choose the best.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young <HI>Ralph</HI> a fair and comely Swain,</L>
<L>The very Hero of the Plain,</L>
<L>Beheld fair <HI>Alecy</HI> on her Way,</L>
<L>No star so bright, no Nymph so gay;</L>
<L>Her small and easy Waist was bound</L>
<L>With Wreaths most sweet; her Head was crown'd</L>
<L>With ev'ry Flower of the Field,</L>
<L>That <HI>Flora</HI>'s self to her might yield.</L>
<L>She on her Head, a Garland bore</L>
<L>Its equal ne'er was seen before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young <HI>Ralph</HI> set off full Speed to meet</L>
<L>This lovely Maid, this Nymph compleat,</L>
<L><PB N="80" REF="89"/>And struck the rest with great Surprize,</L>
<L>To see him claim her for his Prize,</L>
<L>He first bereav'd her of her Crown,</L>
<L>And claim'd the Maiden all his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now ev'ry Youngster on the Plain</L>
<L>Look'd with Envy on the Swain,</L>
<L>But all in Justice did declare</L>
<L>He won the Maid;—the Trick was fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The 'Squire pauz'd, and shook his Head,</L>
<L>His hearty smile of Humour fled</L>
<L>To see his Child another's Claim,</L>
<L>And now he 'gan himself to blame.</L>
<L>The Swain beheld the good Man's Eyes,</L>
<L>With Tears he offer'd back his Prize.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The 'Squire charm'd at such a Deed</L>
<L>Cry'd you deserve her now indeed!</L>
<L>It glads me much, young Swain to find,</L>
<L>Thou bear'st so great, so good a Mind;</L>
<L>Here take her Lad,—I murmur not</L>
<L>If she's contented with her Lot,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She smil'd Consent, and chear'd the drooping Swain,</L>
<L>She gave her Hand, her Meaning to explain.</L>
<L>The 'Squire saw, and bless'd the blooming Pair,</L>

<HEAD>CHRISTMAS EVE IN THE COUNTRY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE Mountain tops were tipt with driven Snow,</L>
<L>And Silver white were all the Vales below,</L>
<L>When, ceasing thro' the frozen Field to roam,</L>
<L>Each Country Bumpkin ambles to his Home;</L>
<L>Enjoys what oft his betters do admire</L>
<L>In Winter Time,—a comfortable Fire,</L>
<L>There with his Spouse and rosy Brats regale</L>
<L>In simple Mirth all round a Mug of Ale.</L>
<L>And now when some sage venerable 'Squire</L>
<L>Does from the Noise of this great Town retire,</L>
<L>To end his Days, forgetting King and Court,</L>
<L>And turns once more unto his youthful Sport;</L>
<L>But feels the Want of Strength, the Want of Sight,</L>
<L>And feels the Winter more severely bite,</L>
<L>Than when his Blood, some forty Years ago</L>
<L>Wou'd reek with Ardour in <HI>December</HI>'s Snow;</L>
<L>Climb the steep Hill, the flowing Riv'let fly,</L>
<L>And join with Speed the chearful Huntsman's Cry</L>
<L>'Till the deep Vally eccho'd to the Sky.</L>
<L>Less Exercise poor Man will now content,</L>
<L>Infirmity will teach him to repent;</L>
<L><PB N="82" REF="91"/>And make Attonement for a Life of Sin,—</L>
<L>At threescore Years 'tis Time sure to begin.</L>
<L>The Night approach'd, each Friend receives his Guest,</L>
<L>To drink an Health, or crack some merry Jest</L>
<L>To eat and drink in hearty free Good will,</L>
<L>And all the Troubles of the Day to kill.</L>
<L>Tho' Ven'son fumes ne'er taint their homely Board,</L>
<L>The feast on what they better can afford;</L>
<L>A good Sir Loin, a Pudding full of Plumbs,</L>
<L>Smoaking and hot upon the Table comes.</L>
<L>No Prince on Earth cou'd here refuse to eat</L>
<L>So nice the Pudding and so sweet the Meat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Once on a Time the Fire Side was grac'd</L>
<L>With six true pair of Lovers round it plac'd,</L>
<L>When biting Frost, and Snow bespread the Green,</L>
<L>The Lads here serv'd their Lasses for a Skreen,</L>
<L>By holding them as we do often see</L>
<L>The Lads in Town—their Lasses on their Knee;</L>
<L>Now each in Turn wou'd Sing a merry Song,</L>
<L>And some wou'd tell a Story very long,</L>
<L>While all attentive wou'd with Wonder hear,</L>
<L>And shew'd with Eyes of Love an Heart of Fear;</L>
<L>One who refused in his Turn to sing,</L>
<L>Told a sad Story of a murder'd King.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Another cry'd, he heard his Granny say</L>
<L>As she was passing thro' a lonely way,</L>
<L>The Night was dark and Glow-worms did appear,</L>
<L>When ev'ry Tree then added to her Fear.</L>
<L>And passing by a lonely Church Yard Wall</L>
<L>The Grave Stones mov'd, the Steeple shook and all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="83" REF="92"/>
<L>Another now began a woeful Tale</L>
<L>The very Thought of which oft turn'd him pale.—</L>
<L>Once, said he, a Lady fair and tall</L>
<L>Did walk a Nights upon our Garden Wall;</L>
<L>She sometimes like a Sow and Pigs appear'd</L>
<L>And sometimes like a Jew, with a long Beard,</L>
<L>And sometimes like a greyhound, sleek and trim,</L>
<L>Sometimes like a Lion very Grim.</L>
<L>And once my Father said he saw it stand</L>
<L>With a bleeding Heart grasp't within its Hand</L>
<L>And once he heard it like a Raven croak,</L>
<L>And thrice, they say, it to our Parson spoke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At this sad Tale, not one in all the House,</L>
<L>But even fear'd the moving of a Mouse.</L>
<L>O lack a-Day, cry'd one fair trembling Maid,</L>
<L>I fear to move, I am so much afraid.</L>
<L>Another, list'ning, thought she heard a Voice,</L>
<L>Another cry'd, I'm sure I heard a Noise.</L>
<L>Hush was the Word, while each with list'ning Fear,</L>
<L>Did, as it were, all statue-struck appear.</L>
<L>Nor Eye, nor Finger now was seen to move,</L>
<L>But each pale Maid cling'd fast about her Love;</L>
<L>And all, the more from Fear, than from Desire,</L>
<L>Mov'd by Degrees almost into the Fire.</L>
<L>A dreadful Clatter all at once was heard,</L>
<L>And in a Trice the Fire Side was clear'd;</L>
<L>Out at the Door they helter-skelter ran,</L>
<L>Nor 'till the Morning did there one return;</L>
<L>The Parson and the Clerk at Noon were brought,</L>
<L>With Faces full of Fear and Heads of Thought;</L>
<L><PB N="84" REF="93" MS="y"/>Gravely they enter'd, with a solemn Look,</L>
<L>The Parson held his Breech, the Clerk his Book,</L>
<L>And step by step with Caution star'd around,</L>
<L>Thinking most sure 'twas all inchanted Ground.</L>
<L>But first they both into the Oven peept,</L>
<L>Thinking, perhaps, it might in there have crept,</L>
<L>But turning to the Cup-board, there did lie,</L>
<L>A nice Plumb-pudding, and a Christmas Pie,</L>
<L>That Puss had in her thieving Tricks thrown down,</L>
<L>And struck with Wonder all the simple Town.</L>
<L>The Parson, with a knavish Leer and Grin,</L>
<L>Stroak'd with great Sanctity his double Chin.</L>
<L>Cry'd 'twas a Shame such Pudding should be lost,</L>
<L>And in an Instant down his Throat he tost</L>
<L>A Piece that wou'd almost have choak'd a Hog,</L>
<L>And gave old Sly the Clerk a frienldy Jog.</L>
<L>Who likewise cry'd, indeed it was a Shame,</L>
<L>And by the Priest's Example did the same.</L>
<L>Then both turn'd home with Safety and Content,</L>
<L>And left the Losers only to repent;</L>
<L>Telling 'em of the worst to make the most,</L>
<L>To rest content, by giving up the Ghost.</L>
