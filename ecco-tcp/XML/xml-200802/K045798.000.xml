<P>THE eager and almost universal Curiosity, which the late <HI>Installation</HI> of the <HI>Knights of the Order of the Garter</HI> excited in the <HI>Publick,</HI> seemed in a manner to command our Attention, and justify our Endeavors to exhibit a Representation of it in the following Masque: The Difficulty was to give an adequate Idea, in a small Compass, of the various Circumstances of this great Solemnity, consisting of the <HI>In∣stallation, Procession,</HI> and <HI>Feast.</HI></P>
<P>The late Mr. <HI>Gilbert West,</HI> published, some Years ago, a Dramatick Poem called <HI>The Institution of the Order of the Garter,</HI> which has been much admired: It was, however, impossible to bring it on the Stage as it was originally written, because, though rich in Machinery, it was little more than a Poem in Dialogue without
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
Action: Some select Parts of it however, with a few necessary Alterations, and the Addition of some comic Scenes, were thought a proper Vehicle for the different Ceremonies of this great Festival. The Scene is laid in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, who was the Founder of the Order, after having restored that of the <HI>Knights of the Round Table,</HI> which we have supposed, with some Writers, to be continued at the Institution of the Garter.</P>
<P>No Expence has been spared, nor, we hope, any Object of Attention overlooked, which might conduce to make the following Masque as short, as various, and as faithful to the original Institution as possible.</P>
<P>The Songs, Choruses, and Serious Dialogue are published, that they may be better under∣derstood from the Stage. The comic Parts which are intended merely for the Preparation of the principal Scenes, are not printed, as they would lose much of their Effect by being separated from the Action of the Performer.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>West,</HI> in order to give a greater Variety and to introduce some particular Characters into
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
his Poem, has taken (as he acknowleges in a Note) the Advantage of a Licence usually allowed to Poets, of departing a little from Chronology, and postponing the Institution of the Order for a few Years.</P>
<P>Under the Sanction of this Authority, we have ventured to make use of the same poetical Licence, by throwing the Institution of the Order as many Years backward, as Mr. <HI>West</HI> has brought it forward. We have made the Black Prince nine Years younger than he was, when he was Knighted; and we flatter ourselves that this Anachronism will be excused for the Sake of the Application.</P>
<P>Some other Liberties of less Consequence are necessarily taken for the Sake of rendering the whole more Theatrical; we have had too long an Experience of the publick Indulgence, not to know that they will be readily over∣looked, should the rest of the Performance have the good Fortune to be approved.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The following</HI> EXTRACTS <HI>from</HI> Selden's Titles of Honor, <HI>and</HI> Ashmole's Order of the Garter, <HI>are inserted to shew the Authority upon which we have founded some Part of our</HI> Installation.</HEAD>
<Q><P>AND so much the rather also, because we know by others of our own country, that in the self-same year, a solemn and great meeting of Knights was appointed by the King at Windsor Castle, for the set∣ting up of his <HI>Round Table</HI> there, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And it seems that out of the plot and purpose of this <HI>Round Table</HI> at Windsor, erected in the same year wherein the Order of the New Garter was instituted and appointed to be celebrated on St. George's day of the same year, as we may collect out of Froissart also, the Order itself had chief part at least of its original. And the other traditions touching the Garter of the Queen, or of the Countess of Kent and Salisbury, may well stand with this, thus far, that the word and the use of the Garter, began as the traditions suppose, but that the Order was raised chiefly out of this of the <HI>Round Table</HI> of that time, as out of a Seminary. For the <HI>Round Table</HI> was in special use in those ages, for the drawing together of the braver Knights and Ladies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Froissart likewise says, <HI>Et ordonna</HI> (Edward the Third) <HI>que d'an en an le jour Saint Gregore, s'en feroit la feste dedans le chateau de Vindesore, le quell chateau le Roy Artur avoit fait faire autreffois edifier et in icelui tenir la noble Table ronde,</HI> &amp;c.</P><BIBL>SELDEN, edit. 1672. pag. 658.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>King Edward the Third having designed to restore the honor of the <HI>Round Table,</HI> held a juste at Windsor, in the 18th year of his reign, (but there is an old manu∣script chronicle that has these words: King Edward in his 19th year begun his <HI>Round Table,</HI> and ordained the
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
day annually to be kept there at Whitsuntide) and this meeting, in truth, occasioned the foundation of the most noble Order of the Garter, as shall be noted by and by.</P><BIBL><HI>Ashmole,</HI> edit. 1672, pag. 96.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>He (Edward the Third) did thereupon first design (as being invited thereto by its antient fame) the restauration of King Arthur's <HI>Round Table,</HI> which he exhibited with magnificent hastiludes and general justs, to invite hither the gallant and active spirits from abroad; and upon discovery of their courage and abi∣lity in the exercise of arms, to draw them to his party, and oblige them to himself.</P>
<P>Though King Edward so far advanced the honor of a Garter, as that the Order did derive its title and denomination from it; yet it is most evident, that he founded this more famous Order, not to give reputa∣tion to, or perpetuate an effeminate occasion, but to adorn martial virtue with honor, rewards, and splen∣dor: to increase virtue and valour in the hearts of his nobility; or, as Andrew du Chesne saith, to honor military virtue with some glorious favours and rewards; that so true nobility (as is noted in the preface to the black book of the Order) after long and hazardous adventures, should not enviously be deprived of that honor which it hath really deserved; and that active and hardy youth might not want a spur in the pro∣fession of virtue, which is to be esteemed glorious and eternal.</P>
<P>Upon these grounds no doubt does our learned Selden affirm, that this Order was raised chiefly out of the <HI>Round Table</HI> of that time (the Knights thereof being in the flower of that age) as out of a seminary. </P><BIBL><HI>Ashmole,</HI> page 182.</BIBL></Q>
