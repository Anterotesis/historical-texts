<HEAD>SCRUB'S TRIP TO THE JUBILEE. SPOKEN BY MR. WESTON.</HEAD>
<L>FROM Stratford arriv'd—piping hot—gentle folks,</L>
<L>From the rarest fine shows and most wonderful jokes,</L>
<L>Your simple acquaintance, Scrub, comes to declare</L>
<L>'Twas fuller by far than our Litchfield great fair,</L>
<L>Such crouds of fine ladies, serenading and singing</L>
<L>Such firing of loud pateraroes and ringing,</L>
<L>To tell it in London must seem all a fable</L>
<L>And yet I will tell it as well as I'm able:</L>
<L>First something in linguo of schools call'd an ode;</L>
<L>All critics they told me allow'd very good,</L>
<L>One said—you may take it for truth I assure ye</L>
<L>'Twas made by the little great man of old Drury,</L>
<L>By my brother Martin—for whose sake d'ye hear,</L>
<L>This night I'd a mind for a touch at Shakespeare<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This alludes to Mr. Weston's intention of playing Richard.</NOTE>.</L>
<L>But honestly speaking I take more delight in</L>
<L>A bit of good fun, than drums, trumpets and fighting.</L>
<L>The Procession, 'twas said, would have been a fine train;</L>
<L>But could not move forwards—oh la, for the rain.</L>
<L>Such tragical, comical folks and so fine—</L>
<L>What pity it was that the sun did not shine,</L>
<L>Since ladies and baronets, aldermen, squires,</L>
<L>All went to this Jubilee full of desires,</L>
<L>In crouds as they go for to see a new play</L>
<L>And when it was done—why they all came away.</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>Don't let me forget—a main part of the show</L>
<L>Was long tailed fine comets by fam'd Angelo,</L>
<L>Some turtle I got which they call'd pashapee—</L>
<L>But honest roast beef's the best turtle for me.</L>
<L>I hate all ragouts, and, like a bold Briton,</L>
<L>Prefer good plumb pudding to ought I e'er bit on.</L>
<L>I drank too—and now I a poet may be—</L>
<L>From a charming fine cup of the mulberry tree.</L>
<L>To bed I must go—for which like a ninny</L>
<L>I paid—like my betters—no less than a guinea.</L>
<L>For rolling—not sleeping—in linen so damp</L>
<L>As struck my great toe ever since with the cramp,</L>
<L>Thus fleec'd—in my pocket I felt a great smarting</L>
<L>Yet griev'd not when I and the splinters were parting,</L>
<L>'Twas worth ten times more to hear sweet brother Martin.</L>
<L>He spoke till poor Scrub was just fit, with one eye</L>
<L>To laugh, while the other was ready to cry:</L>
<L>Which makes me now tell you without any brag</L>
<L>He's second to none but the Warwickshire wag.</L>
<L>The Jubilee over, I come to this place</L>
<L>To tell you my story and sue for your grace.</L>
<L>You never refus'd it—yet never before</L>
<L>With granting such kindness bound gratitude more.</L>
<L>I love but to own with a diligent spirit</L>
<L>Your favours have ever out-run my slight merit.<NOTE N="{inverted ⁂}" PLACE="foot">The reader will easily perceive that this Prologue is merely occasional</NOTE></L>

<P>THE Author thinks it incumbent upon him to observe, that the following Oc∣casional Piece was imagined, and put into its present State within the Space of a very few Days; and has some Reason to believe, that it would have been presented at the Theatre Roy∣al in the Hay-Market, if the Thought had been suggested in Time for Mr. FOOTE's Season.

<P>You lie—you lie, scape grace; Change-Al∣ley won't be empty; and that's the best part of Lon∣don!—A very fine thing indeed, if East India stock; South Sea; three per cents consols and lottery tickets, were left for Jubilee, which, as I have heard, is a rank piece of popery, Sir John.</P>

<P>Ay, ay, the song's well enough; but there's a blind fiddler that plays at my house who sings three times as loud; he rattles away old Roger, the hunting of the Fox, Bumper squire Jones, and Roast Beef, till he makes my great hall ring again.—Body o'me it would do any body good to hear him.</P>

<P>Lord sir, they have been all bespoke these six-weeks; would you believe it; lord Blazingstar has engaged the roost of one of our chambermaids four story high, and lady Betty Soylainet is obliged to con∣tent herself with an ostler's apartment over the stables.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great plenty my lord, of practised ladies for country gentlemen; and I make no doubt but there will be rare poaching for experienced sportsmen among unflush'd game; we shipped off from Bow-street and the garden three waggon loads last week:—Forty-five, as we call Bet Tawdry, is to pass here for a baronet's daughter—Sall Bottlenose for a young cler∣gyman's widow, Suky Trapes for a country girl, and Peggy Nimwell, all your lordship's acquaintances—for an East-India captain's lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Spangle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excellent!—the game hunted down by us gallants of fashion do well enough for mistresses, or even wives, for fellows in this part of the world, but have you fixed your eye on nothing fresh yet Longcork: no soft, blooming, languishing fair, on whom a few soft words a few promises with a silk gown or two could prevail; point out such a one, and ten gold-finches in one cage shall chirp a most engaging piece of music to reward thee.</P>

<SPEAKER>Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am bound to you, my lord, and shall have a sharp look out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Spangle.</SPEAKER>
<P>But snug let it be; for the impertinent hungry news writers do so search out and bastinado the modish failings of nobility; that a peer can not debauch his neighbour's wife or daughter with any safety; and hypocrisy is become almost as essential to us as to a Moorfields preacher.</P>

<P>Politely, flattering, I confess, my lord; bur perhaps at present I am flushed with a little ac∣cidental beauty; for about half an hour since, as I was driving my phaeton and four, at the rate of four∣teen miles an hour; an odious chimney sweeper's sa∣vage ass, set up his horrid bray, started my cream co∣lours, turned them out of the road, and tipped me head-foremost into a ditch.</P>

<P>Nothing, madam—my roan by Regulus broke down in a trial sweat last week and must for∣feit two hundred—my grey filly has put out a spavin and my bay by Sampson has slipped a shoulder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Spank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite unfortunate; I am matched against captain Clumsy a three mile heat which I expect to win hollow; for you know he rides like a woolpack.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Spang.</SPEAKER>
<P>True madam—ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Spank.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a match depending also with lord Scapegrace for five hundred a side on leaping five barred gates—bets run pretty even.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Spang.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will back your ladyship in both—six to four for any sum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Spank.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is encouragement however—and I have been in close training these six weeks—do not you think my lord the Sampsons have shewn more bottom than Foot of late?—little Gimcrack he is the star of the turf, I would freely give two thousand for him; then as a groom theres Singleton beats the globe; I hope when he dies, for he must fall as well as Alex∣ander, Marlborough, and other great men; I hope there will be a Jubilee of commemoration appoint∣ed for him at Newmarket.—I am sure he deserves it much better than the old musty scribbler Shakespeare; so fine a finger, so steady a hand, so firm a seat; in short he rides so well that if the fellow had but genteel blood in his veins I think no lady could refuse him for a husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Spang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your ladyship's approbation does his merit singular honour and the preference given against Shakespeare is most happily Judicious; no critic of
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
any delicacy, can bear the fellow's hum drum pieces now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Spank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite intolerable.—Though if some of them were turned into singing affairs they might be endured well enough, the opera of Hamlet; the opera of Othello; the opera of Richard; in short, the opera of ever thing, to banish that antiquated barbarous word Tragedy.—But my Lord, have you fixed upon your character for the masquerade yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Spang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not yet, madam; if your Ladyship, as in real life, will personate Venus; I must consequently attempt the character of Adonis.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Spank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Infinitely polite! but my choice rather bends to the Queen of the Amazons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Spang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then madam you will metamorphose me into Alexander, who was her admirer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Spank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, since I find there is no escape from your excessive gallantry it shall be so—that valuable creature Mr. Pasquin the habit-man, from Tavistock-Street is to be here with at infinite variety; if it is agree∣able to your lordship we will have a view.</P>

<P>Well I vow, Jackonet, this flying from place to place is pure. What would my old papa say now if he knew that I was come to the Jubilee?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say! why the same that all such old cuffs as he would say upon the same occasion; that you was a wild mad-headed girl, that you was a flaunting
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
baggage, that you did not know the pains required to get money, nor the value of it when got; that your head runs upon whirligigs and that you think of no∣thing but plays, assemblies fine cloaths and fine sweet∣hearts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emmel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! well I vow you take him off to a hair; if it was not for my aunt Fiddle-de-dee, I should have known no circumstance of polite life I should have been fit for nothing but mending stockings and making pies, if it was not for her I should not have you to wait on me, Jackonet.—He would have brought me up just such an unfashionable creature as himself; but nature has given me spirit, and my aunt has gi∣ven me taste; so I am resolved not to be shut up in the horrid smoke of Watling street any longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are perfectly in the right of it, madam; get yourself tranlplanted to Grosvenor, Berkley, or Cavendish Square as soon as possible; set up a vis-a-vis bespeak an elegant sedan of four hundred guin∣eas price; hire two of the handsomest chairmen, and six of the genteelest footmen than can be found; with every other article of a grand household, keep visi∣ting days, routs, &amp;c. and shine forth an ornament of the gay world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emmel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ravishing picture!—What an unreasonable mortal is this Papa of mine to think I would give up such a round of delights; for that hateful creature Om∣nium, the change broker, and his country house at Islington. Did I ever sing you a song I made upon be∣ing plagued to have him, Jackonet?</P>

<P>Admirable! Jackonet, you shall be first lady of my bed-chamber, and shall have my wedding cloaths.—Sir Charles promised to meet me here this evening, and, when the enchanting Jubilee is over, we shall fly for Scotland immediately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>A charming convenient country that, for matrimonial affairs, madam,—heigh ho!—I wish I was taking a trip there with one I know, upon the same occasion.—The invitation which carried your father into Yorkshire at this critical time was very fortunate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emmel.</SPEAKER>
<P>The luckiest thing in the world, the very name of a Jubilee would have frightened him out of his senses!—But, Jackonet—what would you have me get for the masquerade?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lard, madam! there is such a variety, that it is almost impossible to advise. When I lived with lady Bab. Rattle, she employed six hours a day for three months, and could scarce fix upon any thing at last;—one day she would be a Turk; the next a Christian; the third a Chinese; the fourth a Dutch woman; next a Heathen, Goddess; then a Savoyard; soon after a gipsy, a witch, and twenty others:—at last she thought of transforming herself into a moving bee-hive, intimating that beauty is pregnant with the stings of love—but, alas! upon entering the ball∣room, she saw two other bee-hives dancing a cotilion with the sun, the moon, a bear, an ostrich, Hamlet's ghost, and an animated butter-cask.—This had such an effect upon her, that she retired immediately, and almost fretted herself into a consumption.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emmel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor lady! such terrible shocks must hurt any constitution; I have cause enough myself; but a
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
good heart and pleasing hopes bear me up.—I would have a dress odd and whimsical—I'll make a bargain with you, Jackonet; you shall chuse for me and I'll chuse for you.</P>

<P>As you please, madam!—Bless me, yonder's one of Sir Charles's men come post haste into the yard—his master must be near at hand!</P>

<P>Oh dear! I am so tumbled and tossed with the journey—my head is in such terrible disorder,—I can't see Sir Charles in this pickle, positively.</P>

<P>If you please, madam, I'll call the chamber∣maid to shew a private room and put you to rights: in a quarter of an hour you shall look so killingly, that the baronet's impatience for Scotland shall make him think the Jubilee seven years long.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHAT! no lottery gudgeons in this town?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCRAPEALL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No no, Sir John; I could pick up nothing but a premium of ten shillings for number forty-five—they are all jubilee gudgeons here.—When I asked a bookselling fellow, who dabbles a little that way, whether he wanted any tickets—he answered—Shakespeare is to be crowned to-morrow; and his wife, before I could open my mouth again, said, there was to be a masquerade to-morrow, which eve∣ry-body would be at.—For my part, I think they are all Shakespeare-mad, and I wish we were fairly out of the town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Body o'me, why so? Can't people be merry and wise?—For my own part, I should like to stay and see the fun—ay and we will, old True-penny.—When it is over, I'll take you to such gardens, groves, and purling streams in Yorkshire, as shall make you young again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>SCRAPEALL.</SPEAKER>
<P>With your leave, Sir John, I had rather go back to London.—Pray where can you find a garden of equal value to that of Covent Garden?—Where can you match the golden grove of Lombard street?—Where meet more delightful retreats than the arbours of the Alley?—Where more comfortable walks than those of the Exchange, or a stream equal to the Thames between Bridge and Deptford? Besides, I am very uneasy about my girl, she's at the ticklish age of nineteen, has twenty thousand pounds at her own disposal, when of age, besides the inheritance of all my estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, then, friend, touch and take, ten to one, do all you can, she'll please herself at last, and throw herself away upon some poverty-struck lord, who, being out at the elbows, will marry her money to mend bad circumstances; then keep a mistress to please his inclinations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCRAPEALL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am no friend to popery, yet I wish we had nunneries amongst us to lock up head-strong young hussies.—Ah, why had not I a son? by this time he might have been thoroughly educated in those schools of useful knowledge, Lloyd's and Jonathan's—I might have lived to see him double my fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then, old boy, since you can't be sure who will get it, or how it may go, take my advice and
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
regale yourself with a little of it before you are shipped off for the other world.—Now I am here, I'm resolved to see what sort of an affair this jubilee is—though I suppose it won't be half so good as a country feast or a fox chace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCRAPEALL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor half so fine as my Lord Mayor's show, which may be seen for nothing into the bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing! prithee don't grumble so in the giz∣zard—it is my humour to see what all this bustle's about; and if you'll promise to throw off your melan∣choly face, body o'me, I'll bring you off scot free—I'll pay for both; I have three hundred pounds a quarter, and don't wish to save a shilling of it.</P>

<P>Besides, man, I never saw a coronation in my life; and, for aught I know, the crowning of king Shakespeare may be as pretty a piece of diversion as the crowning of any other king—so brush up your phiz, and we'll sally forth to see what's stirring.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PASQUIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if every freedom presented in a mulberry-box was to produce a masquerade, I could wish all the authors, actors, and critics in England were made burgesses of Stratford—I shall love the name of Shakespeare as long as I live. What a delightful bustle does this jubilee make! so many country 'squires and their ladies, who know nothing of the matter, apply for dresses, that we can fleece them genteelly—but what of that? they, in return, will rack their tenants; and the tenants consequently raise provisions; so that, upon the whole, no-body is affected but the low mechanical vulgar, whom nature has formed as mere necessary utensils for the sport and profit of us in polite spheres of life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SLEEKEM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, this promises fair to beat the royal masquerade.</P>

<P>For Mr. Alderman—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PASQUIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw, pshaw, skip all the corporation—I furnish them and their wives for nothing, which is a little hard; but as they have countenanced this polite sheep shearing, I must make other people pay for them, and the unconscionable long credit expected by most of my quality customers.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>SLEEKEM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, he says he has written six letters, dated Avon, to the Public Advertiser; six copies of verses, four epigrams, and twenty puff paragraphs to raise pub∣lic curiosity; so he claims it gratis as a right, and says, if you don't comply, he'll anatomize you; but if you do, he promises to recommend and promote masquerades as much as possible.</P>

<P>Ara, nothing at all when a body's us'd to it!—And so, as I was after telling you, cush la ma cree, when I would not give my splenters to the Raparee, he fired his pistol strait at me of one side: though as luck would have it, it did not go off neither; so I ups with little sweet lips, shillela, that never miss'd fire in its life, and giving him a stouter on the nog∣gin, I laid him as flat as a flounder, agra.</P>

<SPEAKER>PASQUIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravely done, upon my word, Sir.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> DUMPLIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Sir, it is very happy he did not get up again and murder you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Captain</HI> BLARNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, by my soul, he's safe enough for that; he's as dead as Henry the Eighth. Why, he told me himself that he was dead; and so I said, if he did not like it, he might carry himself to a surgeon, and get his head heel-tapp'd.</P>

<P>Very witty and clever, I vow.</P>

<P>I am glad you like it—Glogha too sneeshen—Musha, upon my soul, Madam, you're a very engage∣ing person, and Captain Terence Blarney (meaning myself) would be very glad of a better acquaintance with you.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> DUMPLIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your are very polite, Sir; but the loss of a good husband so lately, makes me indifferent to all the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Captain</HI> BLARNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my soul now, if you have had one good husband, it is a very good reason you should get an∣other. My poor Sheela was buried at Monaghan last Friday se'nnight was five weeks, so I came to this Jubilee to look out for another; and, if your lady∣ship's not engaged, what's the reason but we may join giblets without any balderdash pribble-prabble?</P>

<P>Lard, Sir, you overpower me;—so sudden,—so short an acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Captain</HI> BLARNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ara, what magnifies that; must not every acquaint∣ance be short before it is long?—I'm a gentleman, every inch of me; I have a pretty little estate, after the man that owns it is dead: and you see I'm as well timbered about the legs and face, as one can meet in a long summer's day.</P>

<P>My Lord, I beg ten thousand pardons, but I have been quite flustered since you left me; for that eter∣nal talker, lady Mary Tattle, fast held me so long by the ears, that I lost all patience; then, tripping one foot as I came up stairs, an officious Irishman laid hold of this arm, and grasped it in such a man∣ner with his monstrous paw, that I don't know whether it will recover strength time enough to ride my October match at Newmarket.</P>

<P>Black! black! what melancholy tales do these bring?—Your Lordship's excuse—Um—um—your sister, lady Charlotte, died this afternoon.—Poor Charlotte! she was a good-natured girl, but wanted spirit: she fell in love with a young fellow of in∣ferior station, and being crossed, pined herself into a consumption, which carried her off. Well, that's better than disgracing the family. <STAGE>Reads again</STAGE> Your ladyship's bay hunter, Buck, was seized

<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> SPANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I allow the stroke to be very affecting; but, as some alleviation, permit me to present you with my roan colt, Stag; as the phrase is, he can snuff the moon, and will take the knowing-ones in deeply,</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> SPANKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Lordship is the very essence of consolation: I'll have Stag to my leaping-bar, and throw him into training next week.—Now, if you please to divert my mind from poor Buck, we'll go into the inner warehouse-room, and fix upon our masquerade habi∣liments.—Come, Mr. Pasquin.</P>

<P>If he did not, I do, Sir; I have employed all my spare cash these five years in the stocks. Why, Sir, I have wrote two letters, dated India, to come over land, by Holland, one of which will raise that stock twenty per cent. and the other fall it thirty. Now, Sir, if you will countenance my pretensions to your daughter, I'll kill Heyder Ally, and make him conquer Madrass, as often as you please to sell out or buy in.</P>
