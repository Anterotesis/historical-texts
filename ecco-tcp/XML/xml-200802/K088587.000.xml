<DIV1 TYPE="introduction">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS Astronomical In∣strument (which is made agreeably to the <HI>Coper∣nican</HI> System, and there∣fore by me named the <HI>COPERNICUS)</HI> consists (besides the im∣moveable Circle on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utside, and the small moveable central Circle within) of ten intermediate con∣centrical <HI>Annuli,</HI> or broad circular Rings, fitted to revolve one within another; but so, as to be capable of being fix'd,
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
by small Pins, in any situation whatso∣ever. Six of the Circles toward the Center are so contriv'd, that they may be taken away, upon occasion; and yet when they are put in, they are fast con∣nected to the Frame, as well as the other, and revolve as freely as they do. There is also a Terrestrial Globe, of nine Inches Diameter, plac'd under the inner Circles, with its Hour Circle, turning along with it in its Diurnal Motion: And when those Circles are remov'd, the Globe may be so elevated and fix'd at any height, and so regula∣ted by Screws, as to be ready for the Exhibition of those Eclipses, which the six outward Circles assist us to discover; to which last does also belong a Rule, with a Groove, containing an Angle of 5° 37′ for the Moon's Path in Eclip∣ses. There is also a round Plate of Glass, with 12 Concentrical Circles therein, for the 12 Digits in Solar Eclip∣ses; whose Diameter bears the same proportion to the Diameter of the Globe, that the apparent Semidiameters of the Sun and Moon put together, do really bear to the Disk of the Earth in those Eclipses. There is, besides, a Map of the Moon, with 6 Concentrical Cir∣cles, for the 12 Digits in Lunar Eclipses;
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
whose Diameter bears the same proporti∣on to that of the Globe, which the real Diameter of the Moon bears to the real Diameter of the Earth. There is also a dark Circle, representing that Section of the Earth's Conical Shadow, along which the Moon passes in its own Eclip∣ses; and is so much less in proportion than the Diameter of the Globe, as is that of the real corresponding Cir∣cle to that of the Earth it self. There are also two Threads, with their Plum∣mets, fix'd to the Center of the Instru∣ment; of frequent use in its Operati∣ons.</P>
<P>THE Nature of the several Parts of this Instrument is as follows:</P>
<P>THE outmost, or largest Circle, which is immovable, is the <HI>Ecliptick,</HI> with its known Signs, <HI>Aries, Taurus, Gemini, &amp;c.</HI> This Circle is divided equally, from the beginning of <HI>Aries,</HI> or the <HI>Vernal Equinox,</HI> into 360 Degrees, or 12 Signs of 30 Degrees apiece; and is the Mea∣sure and Standard of the whole Instru∣ment. Every Planet, or Point, or Line being still fix'd, by knowing its Place along this Circle, either by the Signs, with the particular Degrees and Mi∣nutes,
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
or by the bare number of Degrees and Minutes from the <HI>Equinox.</HI></P>
<P>THE Second Circle is for the Months and Days of the Year; which Days being, in a manner, equal, this Circle is equally divided into 365 Parts; which is the number of Days in a <HI>Ju∣lian</HI> common Year. Nor will the <HI>Leap Year</HI> cause any great trouble, though it has one more Day in <HI>February;</HI> since it is already allow'd for in those Astrono∣mical Tables, whence all our Numbers have been transferr'd into this Instru∣ment; and any Day therein, after <HI>Fe∣bruary,</HI> is counted one farther than in the common Year. But here several things are to be noted; <HI>viz.</HI> (1.) That I suppose every Body can readily tell, in any Month of any Year, how re∣mote every Day of it is from the be∣ginning of that Year; and this both in common, and in Leap Years; and so can readily change one way of Compu∣tation for the other, as occasion shall re∣quire: Thus we know by the old Me∣morial Verses, that,
<Q><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
<L>Thirty Days hath September,</L>
<L>April, June, and November:</L>
<L>February eight and twenty alone,</L>
<L>And all the rest have thirty and one.</L></Q>
Accordingly, we can tell, that <HI>April</HI> 22<HI>d,</HI> the Day of the next total Eclipse of the Sun, in this common Year, is the 112<HI>th</HI> day of the Year: As also, that <HI>Sept.</HI> 29<HI>th,</HI> or <HI>Michaelmas</HI> day, next Year, which is <HI>Leap Year,</HI> will be the 273<HI>d</HI> Day of that Year; and so in all other Cases whatsoever. (2.) That in case we fix any one Day of the Circle rightly to that Place in the <HI>Ecliptick</HI> whereto it belongs, every other Day of the same Circle will thereby be rightly plac'd also. (3.) That I have therefore set down upon this Circle, the true Place of the <HI>Vernal Equinox,</HI> for the past Ages, as well as for the present: So that 'tis but bringing either the particular Year of our Lord it self <HI>since,</HI> or any one which proceeded it <HI>before Christ,</HI> to the beginning of <HI>Aries,</HI> or the <HI>Vernal Equinox,</HI> and the whole Circle of Months is right∣ly plac'd, with respect to the <HI>Ecliptick,</HI> for that time. (4.) That yet if we de∣sire to be exact, we must, in this case, consider further, what Year it is from <HI>Leap Year</HI> that we are concern'd with;
<PB N="6" REF="8" MS="y"/>
for if it be the first after it (which the first of each Century and Score <HI>since,</HI> and the fourth of each Century and Score <HI>before Christ</HI> always are) the Position of the Numbers is right of it self, without any more consideration: But if it be the second after it, the Circle is to be turn'd one third of a Century's Motion, or one quarter of a Day forward; if it be the third, two thirds of a Century's Motion, or one half of a Day forwards, in order to its right Position; while if it be it self Leap Year, the Circle must be tur∣ned one quarter of a Day backward, in order to such a Position. (5.) Our Astronomical Centuries, Years, Months, and Days do ever commence from the Noon foregoing; so our 10<HI>th</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> in this Instrument begins at Noon <HI>March</HI> 9<HI>th,</HI> and ends at Noon <HI>March</HI> 1O<HI>th;</HI> and is indeed reckon'd by 24 Hours intire, from the one Noon to the other. Thus, because this is the third after <HI>Leap Year,</HI> I turn this second Circle onward half a day, and find, that the <HI>Vernal Equinox</HI> happens this Year, <HI>March</HI> 9. <HI>d.</HI> 18 <HI>h.</HI> 0 <HI>m.</HI> or as we commonly reckon, on <HI>March</HI> 10. about Six of the Clock in the Morn∣ing; and that, by consequence, <HI>April</HI> 21. <HI>d.</HI> 9 <HI>h.</HI> 42 <HI>m.</HI> the time of the middle of the next great Eclipse of the Sun, corres∣ponds
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
ponds to the 13° of <HI>Taurus,</HI> in the out∣most Circle of the <HI>Ecliptick.</HI></P>
<P>THE Third Circle is the Annual Elliptick Orbit of the Earth, here right∣ly represented by a Circle; with the un∣equal Divisions of the <HI>Ellipsis,</HI> correspon∣ding to the inequality of the Earth's Motion. This Circle is fix'd to the due place of the Ecliptick by a small Arch, of the place of the <HI>Perihelion</HI>; as the Days of the Month were fix'd to the <HI>Equinox.</HI></P>
<P>THE Fourth Circle contains the Menstrual Orbit of the Moon, with its Periodical Revolution about the Earth; both in 360 Parts, and in 27 Days, 7 Hours, and 43 Minutes. The actual Divisions are here made for the mean State of the Orbit, which is variable; but Points are set at every five Degrees (to be thence supply'd at every De∣gree, and proportionably in other Ca∣ses) according to its several Degrees of Eccentricity. Upon the inner large part of this Circle there is also a Spiral Line, with the progressive mean Mo∣tion of the Moon's <HI>Apogee</HI> for a Century; with every one of the Months, and almost Days Motion also; That so
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
when we have fix'd, by a proper Table, the mean Place of the <HI>Apogee,</HI> for the beginning of any Century, we may thereby find its mean Place to any time in the same Century also, without any other Assistance whatsoever.</P>
<P>THE Fifth Circle contains, along its spiral, the mean Motion of the Moon's Nodes; and particularly, of the Ascending Node whence the Numbers begin, for an intire Century, with its Months and Days; that so when we have, by a proper Table, once fix'd that Node right for the beginning of any Century, we may, as before, be hereby enabled to place it right at any time in the same Century, without any other assistance: Only we must here note, that the Motion of the Nodes being retrograde, the Numbers on this Circle are counted backward.</P>
<P>THE Sixth Circle contains, in a spiral, the mean Motion of the Moon for the several Days in the Year, num∣ber'd at length: And the Moon's mean Motion for the distinct Years of the Century are put at the utmost edge of the Circle, for our future Benefit in this Case also.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11"/>THUS far I have describ'd the largest and principal Circles, intended for the Discovery of the New and Full Moons; and especially for the Calcula∣tion of Eclipses, both Solar and Lunar.</P>
<P>AS to those six lesser Circles that follow to the Center, they need little Explication, being all of a piece; and are indeed nothing but broad <HI>Annuli,</HI> or Rings, to contain the Orbits of such of the Primary Planets as could be put upon them; with the Orbits of all the Secondary Planets, both those about <HI>Sa∣turn,</HI> and those about <HI>Jupiter,</HI> in their due Proportions; that so, when the Sun is suppos'd in the Center, the Orbits of the Primary Planets may alone be made use of; when <HI>Saturn</HI> is there His; and when <HI>Jupiter</HI> is there His <HI>Satellites</HI> may alone be contemplated. Only we must here note several things, for the better understanding of this Part of our Instru∣ment. (1.) Because <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Orbits were too large for these inner Circles, they are represented by small Spheres, on the second and sixth larger Circles before describ'd; because <HI>Saturn</HI>'s Motion is only about 12 Degrees in a Year, or one in a Month; as also <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
only about 30 Degrees in a Year, or 2½ in a Month; there is no great necessity for these distinct Orbits, with their Motions, to be engrav'd upon these Circles; especially because of the Confusion it would introduce there. (2.) These Orbits are here Circular, or accommodated to the Planets mean Distances from the Sun; but so, that the present Places of the <HI>Aphelia</HI> and <HI>Perihelia</HI> are noted on the utmost edge of the whole Instrument, and the quan∣tity of their several constant Eccentrici∣ties are also noted where their Orbits begin; that so the little Sphere repre∣senting each Planet, may be ever plac'd nearer to or farther from the Center, as its real Distance shall require; only the Eccentricities of the <HI>Earth</HI>'s and <HI>Venus</HI>'s Orbits are too small to be here sensible. (3.) These Orbits are all represented in the Plain of the Ecliptick, as it was here necessary to do: But then the present Places of the Ascending and Descend∣ing Nodes being set down at the utmost Edge, each Planet's Inclination to the Ecliptick, and Latitude on the Earth, may be nearly discover'd for this Age at the same time; I mean this, in case we observe the quantity of the several Angles of Inclination, which those Orbits
<PB N="11" REF="13" MS="y"/>
make with the Ecliptick, which are as follows:

(4.) The seeming Motions of these <HI>Aphelia</HI> and Nodes in the Ecliptick, is only a Degree in 72 Years: 'Tis there∣fore but allowing to these <HI>Aphelia</HI> and Nodes that Motion of one Degree in 72 Years forwards, and their Places in the Ecliptick are known for all Ages. (5.) When <HI>Saturn</HI>'s Secondary Planets are concern'd, the Sun is to be suppos'd in its proper Place of the Ecliptick, at the distance of 294 Feet from the Center of the Instrument: In which Case these Orbits are in true Proportions, with regard thereto. And when <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s are concern'd, it is to be suppos'd, in the like place, at 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Feet distance, for the same purposes. At which Points, if a Lamp be plac'd, and this Instrument be mov'd in a kind of Circular Orbit about it, we shall have a just and na∣tural Representation of the Revolution
<PB N="12" REF="14" MS="y"/>
of these Primary Planets, with their Satellites, about the Sun, both in their Annual and Menstrual Motions.</P>
<P>I COME now to shew the parti∣cular Uses of this Instrument: And shall do it in the Solution of the following PROBLEMS.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="problem">
<HEAD>PROB. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">LEMMA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>To Rectifie the first moveable Circle, or that of the Months and Days, to any Moment of Time, past, present, or to come.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TURN this Circle till the given Year, exactly corresponds to the <HI>beginning of Aries,</HI> in the outmost Cir∣cle; but so, that for the second Year after <HI>Leap Year</HI> you turn it farther one third; for the third Year two thirds of a Century's Motion <HI>forwards</HI>; and for the <HI>Leap Year</HI> one third <HI>backwards,</HI> beyond that beginning of <HI>Aries.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15"/><HI>Thus, if you would Rectifie this Circle to the time of the great Solar Eclipse this Year, which is the third after Bissex∣tile, you would put a Point that is a little beyond</HI> 1701, <HI>two thirds of a Century's Motion backwarder than the beginning of</HI> Aries; <HI>by which means this Circle will be entirely Rectify'd to the time.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="problem">
<HEAD>PROB. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">LEMMA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>To Rectifie the second moveable Circle, or that of the</HI> Earth's An∣nual Orbit, <HI>with its true</HI> Ano∣maly <HI>on it, to any time past, present, or to come.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS is readily done, by bring∣ing its beginning to the time as∣sign'd in the Arch; and is so easie and obvious, as to need no farther Expli∣cation. Only it must be noted, that this Place of the <HI>Perihelion,</HI> with regard to the Earth, is the Place of the <HI>Aphe∣lion,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
with regard to the Sun; or the Place where when the Sun is, the Earth is most remote from it, whence every <HI>Anomaly</HI> is to be begun.</P>
<P><HI>Thus if you add to</HI> 3 s. 7 d. 40 m. <HI>the Place of the</HI> Perihelion, <HI>at the Commencement of this Century, or</HI> 1701, <HI>those</HI> 12 m. <HI>which is its Motion in</HI> 14 <HI>Years; you will have</HI> 3 s. 7 d. 52 m. <HI>for the Place of the</HI> Perihelion <HI>at that time. To which if you bring the beginning of this Circle, you will have this whole Circle, with the Earth's true</HI> Anomaly, <HI>or Place thereon, exactly rectify'd to the time of that Eclipse.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="problem">
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
<HEAD>PROB. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">LEMMA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>To Rectifie the third moveable Cir∣cle, which is that of the Moon's</HI> Apogee, <HI>with its true</HI> Ano∣maly, <HI>or Place upon it, to any time, past, present, or to come.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>LOOK in the proper Table for the place of the Moon's <HI>Apogee,</HI> at the beginning of the Century as∣sign'd, and accordingly fix it: Count along the Spiral that is upon it the Years, Months, and part of a Month of that Century, and lay one of your Threads over that Place; then remove the <HI>Apogee</HI> to that Thread; this will exactly shew its mean Place. After this, observe how far the Sun is from the <HI>Apogee</HI> or <HI>Perigee,</HI> and whether it have lately gone past, or is going to∣wards one of 'em, and turn the Circle accordingly forward or backward one

<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
third of that Distance. For in the former Case that quantity is to be substracted from, in the other added to the former Place, in order to have the true Place. I mean this only as we reckon 45 <HI>d.</HI> for the Limit: And remember, that the fame Equation is to be substracted, or added, for any Number that is equally distant from that Limit; as for 40 and 50, 60 and 30, 70 and 20, 80 and 10, and so in all other Cases whatsoever. Only observe, that if nearest the Limit you take considerably less, and remotest from it a very little more than one third, you will still more exactly Rectifie this Circle.</P>
<P><HI>Thus if you look for</HI> A.D. 1701. <HI>you will find the mean Place of the</HI> Apogee <HI>then to be</HI> 11<SUP>s</SUP> 8° 18′ <HI>and if you turn the Circle forward to</HI> Apr. 22. <HI>you will have the mean Place of the</HI> Apogee <HI>then. And if by turning still forwards, you add the third part of the Sun's Distance, or</HI> 7° <HI>to the former Place, you will have the true Place of the</HI> Apogee <HI>at that time,</HI> viz. 6 s. 27 d. 23 m.</P>

<DIV1 N="4" TYPE="problem">

<HEAD>PROB. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">LEMMA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>To Rectifie the fourth moveable Cir∣cle; which is that of the Moon's</HI> Nodes, <HI>for any time, past, pre∣sent, or to come.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>LOOK in the proper Table for the Place of the <HI>Ascending Node,</HI> at the beginning of the assign'd Century, and there fix it. Count along the Spi∣ral thereon backwards, the Years, Months, and part of a Month of that Century, and lay your Thread over that Place: Then bring the beginning of the Spiral, or Ascending Node, to the Thread; which will give you the mean Place of that Node. Then turn the Circle forward a 20th part of the Sun's distance from either Node, if it have lately pass'd it; or a 20th part backward, if it have not yet pass'd it: This will fix the Nodes to their true
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
Places at that time. I mean this also as we reckon here 45° the Limit; and remember, that the Equation is to be substracted or added for any Number that is equally distant from that Limit: Only Observe, that if nearest that Li∣mit you take considerably less, and remotest from it somewhat more than 1/20, you will still more exactly Rectifie this Circle.</P>
<P><HI>Thus, If you look for</HI> A.D. 1701. <HI>you will find the mean Place of the Ascending Node to be</HI> 4<SUP>s</SUP> 27° 24′. <HI>Then turn the Circle backward to</HI> Apr. 22d, <HI>and you will have the mean Place of that Node there. And if by turning still back∣ward, you substract a</HI> 20<HI>th part of the Sun's distance, or</HI> 27<GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈☐〉"/>, <HI>you will have the true Place of the Node at that time,</HI> viz. 7 s. 21 d. 9 m.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="problem">
<PB N="19" REF="21" MS="y"/>
<HEAD>PROB. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">LEMMA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>To Rectifie the fifth moveable Cir∣cle; which is that of the mean Motion of the</HI> Moon <HI>it self, for every Day of a</HI> Julian <HI>Year, for any time, past, present, or to come.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>LOOK in the proper Table for the <HI>Mean Place of the Moon,</HI> at the beginning of the Century assign'd, and there fix the Circle. Then look along the outward Edge of this Circle for the compleat number of Years of that Cen∣tury, and laying your Thread exactly over that Year, remove the Circle so far. Then count along the Spiral upon it, the number of Days and Parts till the time assign'd; over which laying your Thread, remove the Circle so far. This rectifies the Circle of the Moon's Mean Motion for that time.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22"/><HI>Thus if you look for</HI> A.D. 1701. <HI>you will find the Mean Place of the Moon to be</HI> 10 s. 15d. 20 m. <HI>whither bring the begin∣ning of the Circle accordingly. Lay then a Thread over the Number</HI> 14, <HI>and bring the former Place thereto: Then is this Cir∣cle intirely rectify'd at that time.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note, That the Moon's Motion in Hours is not distinguish'd here on the Spiral; be∣cause it may be better estimated on the Ecliptick it self.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note farther, That when you go upwards, as in the Years before the Christian</HI> Aera, <HI>contrary to what is usual, you add the Mean Motions of the Node, and substract those of the Apogee and Moon it self to and from the Epocha, to prepare the Numbers for the Instrument. But then, if you thereupon chuse proper Numbers for the beginning of each Century before, as well as after the beginning of the Christian</HI> Aera, <HI>you will have no farther Difficul∣ties in the use of the Instrument it self. Thus, if for the beginning of the</HI> 431<HI>st Year before</HI> Christ, <HI>you take</HI> 500 <HI>Years backwards for the Epocha of the Centu∣ry; and</HI> 69 <HI>compleat Years after it for the beginning of the Year it self, you will have no farther difficulty in the use of this Instrument in that case.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note also, That the three last of these Cir∣cles will as well serve for a Century backwards as forwards, from any Root, or Epocha. I mean, if the known number</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
<HI>of Degrees for any number of Years backwards in the Century, be taken on the side of the Epocha contrary to that it belong'd to, if the Years had been forwards; as every one will easily find upon the least Consideration and Trial.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note farther, That to make this Instru∣ment as ready as possible for the present Century, the Epochae of the Places of the Moon's Apogee and Ascending Node, and of the Moon it self, at the beginning of it are noted by the following Marks upon the outmost Circle,</HI> ☉ ☊ ☽, <HI>with Points at the opposite Places at the same time: And the like Marks may be made for any other Century, as occassion shall re∣quire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note lastly, That our Time is here always the Mean or Equal Time; which the more curious may correct by the known Equation-Table: But since this last is little more than a quarter of an Hour different from the other at the utmost, and almost always much less, it is ra∣ther too nice to deserve much Consideration in such an Instrument.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PROB. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>To find the</HI> Sun<HI>'s True Place in the Ecliptick, for any time, past, present, or to come.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>REctifie the two outmost moveable Circles. Look what Sign, De∣gree, and part of a Degree corresponds to the Time assign'd. Lay your two Threads over the first of <HI>Aries,</HI> and over that Place; and count the <HI>same Number</HI> along the Earth's Orbit, which you find belongs to that Number on the Eclip∣tick. This corresponds to the True Place of the Sun in the Ecliptick for that time.</P>
<P><HI>Thus, if you look for</HI> 21 h. 42 m. <HI>upon the Ecliptick on</HI> Apr. 22<HI>d. you will find over against it about</HI> 43 d. 30 m. <HI>This rec∣kon'd along the Earth's Orbit, reaches from</HI> 260 d. 10 m. <HI>which is over against the Equinox, to</HI> 302 d. 35 m. <HI>over against which last Number stands</HI> 12 d. 15 m. <HI>of</HI> Taurus; <HI>which is therefore the Sun's True Place in the Ecliptick at that time.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Thus, if you look for</HI> 111 d. 21 h. 42 m. <HI>on the fifth moveable Circle, you will find it is distant from the Moon's Apogee, along the Ecliptick, about</HI> 192 d. 40 m. <HI>which Number, taken in the Moon's own Orbit, on the third moveable Circle, corresponds to</HI> 12 d. 15 m. <HI>of</HI> Taurus, <HI>the True Place of the Moon at that time.

<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
<HI>the greatest; and the Points or Marks nearest the Apogee are the true ones: (which is nearly the Case in this Ex∣ample, and accordingly made use of in it) and when it is in the Octants, that Excentricity is in a Mean, and the Lines and Numbers themselves are right; but when it is in the Quadratures, the Points or Marks nearest the Perigee are the true Places: And so in all other in∣termediate Positions whatsoever.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>REctifie the first, second, third and fifth moveable Circles, as before directed. After that find the True Pla∣ces of the Sun and Moon for the time given, as before. If they are either the same, or directly opposite, you have the time already; if not, carry your

Threads that lie over the two Places re∣spectively, along their own Orbits, for∣wards or backwards; so that you carry the Moon's 13 Degrees and a quarter to the Sun's one; or a Day's Motion of one, to a Days Motion of the other; and so all along proportionally, <HI>i.e.</HI> somewhat above half a Degree to an Hour, till the Moon's Place overtakes the Sun's. For that Place where they are coincident, gives you the Conjun∣ction or Opposition, with the New or Full Moon.</P>
<P><HI>Thus, If you look for the Sun's Place at Noon,</HI> Apr. 21. <HI>which is, Astronomical∣ly,</HI> 21 <HI>compleat Days in that Month, you will find it about</HI> 11 d. 20 m. <HI>in</HI> Taurus. <HI>And if, in like manner, you look for the True Place of the Moon at the same time, you will find it about</HI> 28 d. 40 m. <HI>in</HI> Aries: <HI>Whence if you carry both the Threads so far as corre∣sponds to</HI> 21 h. 42 m. <HI>you will perceive that the Moon does there overtake the Sun; which shews, that at that very time, or</HI> Apr. 22 d. <HI>about a quarter be∣fore Ten in the Morning, the Sun and Moon will be in Conjunction, and it will be New Moon. But Observe, that if you do not at all know before-hand, at what time of any Month the Conjunction or Opposition will fall, you must find the distinct Places of the Sun and Moon at the beginning of the Month, and so go</HI>

You may also if you please, find the True Places of the Sun and Moon, to that last time, over again, as before directed; especially where there is a design to examin an E∣clipse at the same time; for the grea∣ter Accuracy. But Note, that if you on∣ly intend to find the time of Conjun∣ction or Opposition, in order to an Eclipse, you need not examin any Month or Days, but only such as are near one of the Nodes, or within the Limits of such E∣clipses; which Limits will be stated un∣der the next Problem.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALL the Circles first rectify'd, and the Time and Place of the True Conjunction or Opposition found, as already directed, Lay one of your Threads over that Place, and the other over the nearest Node. If that Distance be less than 16 Degrees and an half, and it be a Conjunction, there will be an Eclipse of the Sun somewhere: If it be greater, there will be no Eclipse. If that Distance be less than 10 <HI>d.</HI> 38 <HI>m.</HI> and it be an Opposition, there will be an Eclipse of the Moon: If it be more, there will be no Eclipse.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30"/><HI>Thus, it happening this Year</HI> 1715. <HI>that the Sun and Moon are in Conjunction, about a quarter before Ten o' Clock, on the next</HI> 22 d <HI>of</HI> April, <HI>and that at</HI> 8 d. <HI>distance from the Descending Node; it is evident there will at that time happen an Eclipse of the Sun. And there hap∣pening an Opposition</HI> October 31st, <HI>about a quarter past</HI> 4 <HI>in the Morning, with∣in</HI> 7 <HI>Degrees and an half of the same Node, 'tis evident there will then be an Eclipse of the Moon also.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note here, that several other Circum∣stances of Eclipses, may be discover'd by the Solution of this Problem. Thus, be∣cause the Conjunction for the next Solar Eclipse happens</HI> before <HI>the Moon has reach'd its Descending Node, 'tis plain, it must belong to the Northern Parts more than to the Southern. Because it is in a sort of a Mean Distance between that descending Node and the Limit, it will be a great and Total Eclipse, and the greatest in the Northern Temperate Zone. Because it happens near the</HI> Aphelion <HI>of the Earth, and near the</HI> Perigee <HI>of the Moon, when the appa∣rent Diameters of the Sun is smaller, and of the Moon greater than usual, it will not be Annular, but Total, and that for some few Minutes also; I mean along that Line, which the Cen∣ter of the</HI> Penumbra <HI>describes upon the Earth. And because the Solar Eclipse this Year happens here in the Day∣time, and the Lunar in the Night, they will both be visible; I mean, in</HI>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BRing <HI>London</HI> to the graduated side of the Meridian, and turn the Hour Circle till 12 o' Clock is pointed to by its Index: Then turn the Globe, with its Hour Circle, so far forward or backward, as the right Ascension be∣longing to the Distance of the Place of the Conjunction, from the beginning of <HI>Cancer</HI> or <HI>Capricorn,</HI> does require; reckoning still 15 Degrees to an Hour, and 1 Degree to 4 Minutes. Hold the Globe in that Position, and bring 12 in the Hour Circle, to the graduated edge of the Meridian again, and there fix it fast, to move with the Globe all along afterward. By this means the Index will tell you the true time, as it is coun∣ted
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
at the Meridian of <HI>London,</HI> during the whole time of the Eclipse. And Note, that the Distance from <HI>Cancer</HI> or <HI>Capricorn</HI> it self, if increas'd or dimini∣shed one 13<HI>th</HI> part, or one Degree in 13, according as the Position of the Sun and Moon shall require, will nearly give the Right Ascension; reckoning the Limit 45, as under the 3<HI>d</HI> and 4<HI>th</HI> Problems, and increasing or diminishing the Equation as there also. But Note, that this Distance it self will never err 2 <HI>d.</HI> 30 <HI>m.</HI> or 10 Minutes in time, from the Truth; nay, will usually be much nearer the same, even without any Allowance for that Correction at all.</P>

<P><HI>In any</HI> Solar <HI>Eclipse, consider'd in general, and with regard to the whole enlightened Disk of the Earth, to find when and where it will begin and end; whether it will be any where total, or every where only partial; and, if partial, how many Digits will any where be Eclipsed; with the other general Circumstances of the same.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TAKE the eleventh part of the Di∣stance of the Place of the Con∣junction from the nearest Node, for the Latitude of the Moon at the middle of the Eclipse. Remove the inner Cir∣cles; and elevate the Globe that stands beneath them, North or South, as the Case shall require. By the side Screws
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
place it in the Center or Axis of your Circles. Lay your Rule, with its Glass of 12 Circles (then set over its middle Point) and its Lamp or Candle, so that the Node may lie in a Position sui∣table to that of the Moon's Orbit at that time (which is easily known from the Observations under the last Problem); and so, that the middle Point, or that under the Center of the Glass, may be directed to the Place of the Conjuncti∣on in the Ecliptick. Turn your Globe, rectify'd as before, till the Index points to the time of the True Conjunction, already found; That is very nearly the time of the middle of the general E∣clipse. Then turn your Globe, and draw your Glass backwards any num∣ber of Minutes equally; so that an Hour in the Hour Circle may ever cor∣respond to an Hour in the Path of the Moon; and till the Shadow of the edge of the Circular Glass begins to touch the nearest Place of the Globe; for that is the Time, and that the Place, when and where the general Eclipse begins. Car∣ry both Motions forward, and observe, whether the Central bright Spot does any where touch the Globe; if it does not, the Eclipse is no where Total, and the Circles cast on the Globe will shew
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
the number of Digits eclips'd: If it does touch, note the Time and Place when and where it does so; for that is the Time, and that the Place of the entry of the Central Shadow, or total Dark∣ness upon the Earth. Do the like as to the Central Spot, or other edge of the Circles going off the Globe afterwards; this will, in like manner, shew the Time and Place of the end of Total Darkness, and of the whole Eclipse respectively And by this means all the other Circum∣stances of the general Eclipse of the Sun, may be most easily and readily discover'd and exhibited to the Eye, with the great∣est Pleasure and Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Thus, in the next great Solar Eclipse, con∣sider'd in general, you will find that it will begin in</HI> 17 d. <HI>of North Latitude, and about</HI> 90 d. <HI>westward from</HI> London; <HI>and this about</HI> 21 m. <HI>after</HI> 7, <HI>and will end in the Latitude of</HI> 40, <HI>about</HI> 98 d. <HI>to the East of</HI> London; <HI>and this at</HI> 3 m. <HI>after</HI> 12. <HI>That it will be a Total Eclipse for about</HI> 150 <HI>Miles in breadth, and that the Center of the</HI> Penumbra <HI>will go near the</HI> Lizard <HI>Point,</HI> Bristol, Stamford <HI>and</HI> Boston; <HI>and so by</HI> Stockholm <HI>and</HI> Arch∣angel, <HI>into</HI> Russia, Siberia, <HI>and</HI> East Tartary.</P>
<P><HI>Note, that if instead of a Lamp, or Candle, you make use of the Sun it self; either by placing the Instrument so, that the Rays</HI>

<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
<HI>may themselves fall parallel to the Axis of the Glass, or that they may be inclin'd to it by a reflecting</HI> Speculum, <HI>or Look∣ing-glass, it will be better.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note also, that if with a Pencil, put thro' the Axis of the Glass, you draw a Line; or with a sharp Pin or Needle therein, make Points upon the Globe, as you move it and the Glass together, you will have the Path-way ef the Center transferr'd upon the Globe; and may thereby exact∣ly find all the Places where the Eclipse will be Total, or Annular, or Central; and may easily see, from the like Lines drawn, or Marks made at any number of Digits distance, how broad the Path of any kind of partial Eclipse will be also over the whole Earth; which how enter∣taining and useful a Sight it may be to all the Curious, I leave to their own Tri∣al and Determination.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note also, That the Problem, thus solv'd, includes one main part of that famous Discovery of Sir</HI> Christopher Wren<HI>'s, Dr.</HI> Halley<HI>'s, and Mr.</HI> Flamsteed<HI>'s, publish'd by the last, and nam'd,</HI> The Construction of Solar Eclipses, <HI>without the tedious Method of Calculation.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS Problem is, in effect, alrea∣dy solv'd, under the former Pro∣blem: It being as easie to observe when the Shadow of the edge of the Glass-Circle first touches, or last leaves any Place upon the Globe; which is the beginning and ending of the Eclipse there: when the bright erect Line cros∣ses it, which is its middle there: How
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
near any Circle of Digits comes to it then: Which is the number of Digits Eclipsed there: With other the like Circumstances of that Place, as it was before to observe the same for the Eclipse in general. Nor is there any occasion for farther Directions.</P>
<P><HI>Thus the next great Solar Eclipse will be∣gin here at</HI> London, April 21. <HI>about</HI> 8 h. 7 m. <HI>in the Morning; its middle will be about</HI> 9 h. 13 m. <HI>its end about</HI> 10 h. 24 m. <HI>and it will be intirely, or very nearly Total: tho' if it be Total here, it cannot be so for much more than a single Minute of Time; as Dr.</HI> Halley<HI>'s particular Map, fitted for this Eclipse, will easily show.</HI></P>

With all the other Circumstances of the same.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TAKE away the Globe, and set the Dark Circle in its Place. Take also the Glass of 12 Circles away, and put the Map of the Moon, with its 6 Circles, in its Place. Then do in all things with this Map of the Moon, as you were order'd to do with the Glass-Circle
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
Circle before. By this means you will have all those <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Lunar E∣clipses solv'd, with greater ease, and the like pleasure, which were before re∣presented in the Solar. Nor is there any new difficulty in the Application. Only Note, that this Map of the Moon being too small to have the Names of its several Seas and Lands engraven on it, it will be convenient to have withal a larger Map of the Moon, with those Names, as an Explication of the other; which accordingly is here pro∣vided, and plac'd on one side of the dark Circle, which is us'd with it. And Note farther, that those who have a mind to be here very particular and exact, may use the larger Map of the Moon instead of the other, in case they join with it a dark Circle of 16 Inches and a quarter in Diameter: For the same Proportion which the Diameter of our smaller Moon of two Inches and an half, bears to that of our dark Cir∣cle of six Inches and two fifths, does the Diameter of that Circle, or of the larger Moon bear to that of a Circle of sixteen Inches and two fifths Diameter. Whence its plain, the larger Moon, and that largest Circle, will more exactly exhibit
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
such Lunar Eclipses than the other. Tho' I believe there will be but few, who will not be satisfy'd with the smaller dark Circle; so I have not provided the larger: Which yet Mr. <HI>Senex,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Hudson,</HI> the exact Engraver and Fra∣mer of this Instrument, will readily procure for any that desire them But then the several Circles concern'd must be ever so adjusted, that the perpen∣dicular of their Centers may still be the same with the Latitude of the Moon at the middle of the Eclipse; and that as measur'd by a Scale, which is so much larger than ours, as their Diameters are larger.</P>
<P><HI>Thus we shall find by this Instrument, that there will be an Eclipse of the Moon this Year,</HI> Octob. 31. <HI>that it will not be a Total, but a Partial Eclipse; that the Digits eclips'd will be</HI> 8, <HI>and this on the North side of the Moon's Body: That the Eclipse will begin about</HI> 2 h. 58 m. <HI>and end about</HI> 4 h. 40 m. <HI>in the Morn∣ing; and that Mount</HI> Aetna <HI>will enter the Shadow about</HI> 3 h. 8 m. <HI>and emerge about</HI> 5 h. 17 m.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="43"/><HI>Note those that would exactly imitate Na∣ture in these Lunar Eclipses, must let the Globe stand, and have a Lamp or Cir∣cle of Light, larger in Diameter than the Globe, through whose Shadow the Map of the Moon must pass. They ought also to have different Maps of the Moon out of</HI> Hevelius, <HI>to fit the diffe∣rent Librations of the Moon, or the small variety there is in that Face which is ex∣pos'd to us in different Eclipses. But since this Method would be much more troublesome, and but little more advan∣tageous or entertaining, I chose the for∣mer easie way of exhibiting these Lunar Eclipses by this Instrument, leaving the other to those among the Curious, who shall think fit to bestow any extraordina∣ry cost and trouble about it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But Note, That the Diameters of the</HI> Pe∣numbra, <HI>and of the Moon, are here still fitted to their Mean Quantity, when the Earth and Moon are about the shor∣ter Axis of their Ellipses: So that when they are near their Aphelion and Apogee, their Perihelion and Perigee; or the Earth its Aphelion, and the Moon its Perigee; the Earth its Perihelion, and the Moon its Apogee; some small Diffe∣rences will arise in the Business of E∣clipses; which yet may easily be allow'd for on a little consideration. Thus the next visible Eclipse of the Sun happening somewhat near the Earth's Aphelion, and nearer the Moon's Perigee, as the Position of their Orbits at that time in this Instrument will shew; the Moon will appear a little larger, and the Sun</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
<HI>a little smaller than ordinary; whereby the Sun will be about</HI> 3 <HI>Minutes and</HI> 3 <HI>quarters under a total Eclipse, all along the Central Path of the Moon's Shadow, and the</HI> 12 <HI>Digits on your Glass will not include the whole. In this Case you are to sup∣pose all the Circles</HI> 2 <HI>thirds of a Digit inlarg'd, and the Central Digit so much broader. Thus the next invisible Eclipse of the Sun,</HI> Octob. 16. <HI>happening some∣what near the Earth's Perihelion, and nearer the Moon's Apogee; the Moon will appear somewhat less, and the Sun somewhat greater than ordinary; so that this Eclipse will be only Annular, and not Total, and the Digits Eclipsed will not be quite</HI> 12. <HI>In this case you are to suppose all the Circles diminish'd</HI> 2 <HI>thirds of a Digit, and the Central Digit so much narrower; and the like Allowances are to be made in the Numbers upon the Path of and perpendicular to the Moon's Shadow, in the Diameter of the Moon's Map, in the Duration of Eclipses,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>which must be left to every curious Person's own esti∣mation; only with this intimation, that these Differences from the Standards here given are ever so small, and commonly so insensible, that they may be well look'd on as almost perfectly inconsiderable in the use of this or the like Instruments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yet the Latitude of the Moon will some∣times well deserve an allowance; and may be corrected by taking not much a∣bove a</HI> 12<HI>th part of the distance from the Node, near the Moon's Perigee, and al∣most a</HI> 10<HI>th near its Apogee, instead of that</HI> 11<HI>th part, which is the usual stan∣dard:</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
<HI>whence at this next Eclipse the real Latitude of</HI> 44 m. 10 s. <HI>will be here represented by</HI> 41 m. 40 s. <HI>on our Scale; and so proportionally in all Cases what∣soever.</HI></P>

<P>HAving found, as before, the <HI>Helio∣centrick</HI> Places of the other Pla∣nets, and particularly that of the <HI>Earth,</HI> noted all by several small Spheres, and having allow'd for their proper Eccen∣tricities in the sticking of those Spheres, Lay one of your Threads from the <HI>Earth</HI> to the Planet, and the other Thread laid parallel thereto from the Center, gives you the <HI>Geocentrick</HI> Place of that Planet for the time as∣signed.</P>

<HEAD>PROB. XVI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>To find the</HI> Mutual Aspects <HI>of all the Primary Planets with one another, and with the</HI> Sun <HI>and</HI> Moon; <HI>their</HI> Conjunctions, Oppositions, Trines, Quar∣tiles <HI>and</HI> Sextiles, <HI>both</HI> Helio∣centrick <HI>and</HI> Geocentrick, <HI>for any time, past, present, or to come.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS is easily done when the Pla∣ces themselves of the Primary Planets, with that of the Moon, are once found by the former Solution. Nor is there then any difficulty in noting the several Angles of distance 120°, 90° and 60°, which make the <HI>Trine, Quar∣tile</HI> and <HI>Sextile Aspect.</HI> But this Pro∣blem looks too like the Fooleries of <HI>Astrology,</HI> to deserve any nicer Explica∣tion.</P>

<HEAD>PROB. XVII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>To find whether any Primary Pla∣net, with its Satellits, be Direct, Stationary or Retrograde, at any time past, present, or to come.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving found the <HI>Heliocentrick</HI> and <HI>Geocentrick</HI> Places of the Planets, and set small Spheres to represent 'em: From the Sphere representing any Pla∣net lay two Rules or Threads, so as to touch the Earth's Orbit on both sides. If the Earth be considerably <HI>without</HI> that mixtilinear Triangle, the Planet is Di∣rect; if considerably <HI>within</HI> it, it is Re∣trograde; if <HI>about the Limit,</HI> it is Statio∣nary: or at least lately was, or soon will be so. Nor can you by this means absolutely determin, near those Limits, whether the Planet be Direct, Statio∣nary, or Retrograde. But then, by finding its Geocentrick Place two seve∣ral times within a few Days of one ano∣ther, and observing whether the Planet
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
at the latter time be farther, or in the same Place, or not so far in the Eclip∣tick as it was at the former time, you may entirely determin the Problem. Nor is the Case of the Inferior Planets much different from that of the Superi∣or ones, as to this matter. Only Note, that the Rules or Threads must be laid from the Earth to touch their Orbits; which is the <HI>Station,</HI> or Limit of the <HI>Di∣rection</HI> and <HI>Retrogradation</HI> of those Pla∣nets, and is call'd their <HI>utmost Elongation</HI>; and that the Inferior Planets Position near those Limits, are here correspon∣dent to the Earth's Position in the Su∣perior. Nor is this a Case of such dif∣ficulty, as to require any nicer Conside∣ration.</P>
<P><HI>Thus, at the time of the foremention'd E∣clipse, we shall find by this Method, that</HI> Saturn <HI>and</HI> Mars <HI>will be Retrograde; and that</HI> Jupiter, Venus <HI>and</HI> Mercury <HI>will be direct.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>FIND the Place of <HI>Saturn</HI> or <HI>Jupi∣ter</HI> in the Ecliptick, for the given time, as before. Then, by the proper Ta∣bles of their Satellits Motions about them, when they shall be made; (for we have only one Set of such Tables yet pub∣lish'd, and render'd fit for our purpose; I mean those of <HI>Cassini</HI> for <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s inner∣most) fix the beginning of their Orbits, or the small Spheres stuck there to re∣present those Satellits: Place also, or imagin a Lamp, or Candle, at the di∣stance of about 160 Feet for <HI>Saturn,</HI> and about the same number of Feet for <HI>Jupi∣ter.</HI> By this means you will have a true and noble Representation of these Sy∣stems of Secondary Planets at any time whatsoever.</P>

<HEAD>PROB. XIX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>To find the Eclipses of these Secon∣dary Planets, for any time (since their Motions have been known) past, present, or to come.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE time of Opposition is the time of the Middle of any Eclipse; and by taking away and adding the half duration of that Eclipse, you have the time of the Immersion and Emersion. 'Tis plain therefore, that finding the Opposition, does, in effect, find the Immersions, Emersions, and intire Du∣rations of those Eclipses also.</P>
<P><HI>Note, that the time of half Duration in</HI> Ju∣piter<HI>'s innermost, which is the most re∣markable Satellit in this matter, is near∣ly</HI> 1 h. 6 m. <HI>and so the whole Duration about</HI> 2 h. 12. m. <HI>perpetually.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55"/><HI>Note farther, that only one of these Appear∣ances, the Immersion or Emersion of a Satellit, is generally visible at the same time;</HI> viz. <HI>the Immersion from the Con∣junction of the Primary Planet with the Sun till its Opposition; and the Emersion from its Opposition till its Conjunction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note also, that till we have more exact and suitable Tables of the rest of these Secon∣dary Planets, it will be proper, two Nights successively, to observe the Position of as many as we can of them; and from those Observations to fix their Pla∣ces, with relation to their Primary ones, to those times. For since their Orbits, on our Instrument, gives their several Peri∣ods exactly enough; from those Periods their future Places and Positions may be found by two such Observations, for a great while; and such Positions may be with pleasure enough compar'd with a great number of other Observations af∣terwards. Nor do we wholly want an Astronomical Method, as to the most use∣ful of these Secondary Planets, which is the innermost about</HI> Jupiter; <HI>since the Tables necessary for placing the same right, and for the Eclipses for some Years to come, tho' too large for this small Ma∣nual, are publish'd in my Astrono∣my, with full Directions for their use al∣so; to which I must refer the curious Reader.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="56"/><HI>Note farther, that we are generally to look for only one of</HI> Saturn<HI>'s Satellites; there being few Glasses that can shew us any more; and none but those of the famous</HI> Cassini <HI>that can discover the two inner∣most.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note here, that</HI> Jupiter<HI>'s Planets are all in or near the Plain of his Equator, which is near the Plain of the Ecliptick it self; and that they are hardly at all Eccentrical. That</HI> Saturn<HI>'s most visible Planet, discover'd by</HI> Hugenius, <HI>is the fourth in order, or the outmost but one: as also that its Planets are in or near the Plain of its Ring, which is about</HI> 31 <HI>deg. inclin'd to the Ecliptick; and that they do not any of them appear to be very much Eccentrical neither.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And note, that our Terrestrial Globe may be so contriv'd, that it may be also us'd with an Horizon, as any other Terrestrial Globe may; and by consequence, those who buy its Celestial Fellow, may at the same time have a</HI> Pair of Globes, <HI>as well as a</HI> Co∣pernicus; <HI>which will at once save al∣most all the Charges of one Globe; and afford a Foundation for the understanding of both the principal parts of</HI> Astronomy <HI>also, I mean</HI> the Doctrine of the Sphere, <HI>to which the Globes; and</HI> the Theory of the Planets, <HI>to which our</HI> Copernicus <HI>does immediately belong.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="57"/><HI>Note lastly, That all who purchase this</HI> Co∣pernicus, <HI>and desire to have it explain'd more distinctly to them, according to the Directions in this Paper, may apply them∣selves to the Author; who will endea∣vour to make the several Parts and Uses of it easie and familiar to them.</HI></P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>IN this <HI>Appendix</HI> I have set down those <HI>Astronomical Tables,</HI> which are chiefly necessary, in order to the ready Use of the present Instrument: And they are, 1. A Table of the <HI>Mean Place</HI> of the <HI>Apogee,</HI> and of the <HI>Ascending Node</HI> of the <HI>Moon's Orbit,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Moon</HI> it self, at the beginning of every Century for 1000 Years be∣fore, and ever since the Christian <HI>Aera.</HI> 2. A Table of the middle of the general <HI>Eclipses</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> within some Hours under or over, for above half this Cen∣tury. This is deriv'd from Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>'s SAROS, or very useful Table of the first 18 Years of the same Century; and will save some trouble in the use of this Instrument, and indeed in any other method of Calculation for the same pur∣pose; which must needs be shortened by knowing the Time so nearly as is here specified. 3. A like Table of the mid∣dle of the <HI>Eclipses</HI> of the <HI>Moon,</HI> for the same interval, and deriv'd from the same Original; as well as serving to the like purpose with the former. The rest of the Astronomical Tables, any way ne∣cessary in this Instrument, may be found at the end of my <HI>Astronomical Lectures,</HI> which are now published both in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>English.</HI></P>
