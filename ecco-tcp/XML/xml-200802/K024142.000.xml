<HEAD>TO THE Worthy Inhabitants of the Parish of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s <HI>Cornhill.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN Compliance with your Request I have publish'd the following Dis∣course. That it was not design'd for the Press, will perhaps appear but too plainly in the Perusal. I am satis∣fied your kind Acceptance of it was more owing to the interesting Nature of the Subject, and the Seasonableness of the Application, than to any Merit in the Performance. That it may answer the End proposed, to <HI>bring forth in us all the Fruit of Well-doing,</HI> is the sin∣cere Wish of,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE>

<P>Fail not to be with them that weep: and to mourn with them that mourn.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S Charity, or universal Bene∣volence, is the distinguishing Mark of our holy Religion; so amongst all the various Branches of this noble and extensive Duty, there is not perhaps one more truly amiable, or more highly requisite, in every Station and Circumstance of Life, than that which I shall make the Subject of my present Discourse; which, as it is ex∣pressive of a sympathetic Tenderness peculiar to our Natures, is most emphatically stiled <HI>Hu∣manity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4"/>COMPASSION, or a friendly Sense of Sor∣row for the Misfortunes of our Fellow Crea∣tures, was originally implanted in our Minds by the great Author of them, and design'd as the Alarms of a kind and impartial Father to engage us to relieve a distress'd Brother: And hence it arises, that our Hearts, like musical Strings, feel every Vibration which is made on those of our Friend, or our Neighbour, and do as it were insensibly and involuntarily beat to each others Pleasures and Pains.</P>
<P>AMONGST our modern Pretenders to Rea∣son and Philosophy, there have not indeed been wanting Men of low and contracted Minds, of sullen and unfeeling Dispositions, who by speci∣ous Arguments, and artful Refinements, have endeavour'd to degrade the Dignity of our Na∣ture, and rob us of every social Virtue. Good-nature and Beneficence have been term'd Self-interest and Dissimulation; Humanity branded with the Name of Weakness; and Compassion derided as a Folly.</P>
<P>WHETHER it be owing to the false Philo∣sophy of such Writers, who so industriously blend the Colours of Virtue and Vice as to render it almost impossible to separate and di∣stinguish them, or to the natural Depravity of Mankind, heighten'd and inflam'd by the ill Examples of a licentious Age, or both together,
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
is hard to be determined; but certain it is, that we are at present so lost in the idle Amuse∣ments, or swallow'd up in the Debaucheries of the World, that almost all the Ties of Nature are broken through or neglected, and social Love and Affection banish'd from the Breasts of Men. Alliances are made, and Friendships contracted without that mutual Love and Since∣rity, which alone can render them lasting or a∣greeable: We are willing enough to <HI>rejoice with them that rejoice,</HI> to partake of the Hap∣piness and good Success of others; but will not <HI>weep with them when they weep, or mourn with them that mourn.</HI> Men in short are but too well acquainted with the Follies, the Vices and the Faults of their Neighbours, and only Stran∣gers to their Misfortunes.</P>
<P>THERE are Ills enough, says the selfish Man, cruel and unavoidable Ills, which fall to my own Share; why then must I increase the Burthen by bearing the Weight of others? <HI>Suf∣ficient for my Day is the Evil thereof.</HI> Thus trifling and insignificant are the Arguments of these Men, who would shelter their Pride and Inhumanity under the Mask of Prudence, and dress up the low and sordid Vice of Selfishness in the Habit of Virtue. Such have little Title to the Bene∣fits of that Nature they partake of; but are to be look'd on as Limbs cut off from the Body of Society, as wither'd and sapless Branches, which
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
yield neither Shade nor Fruit; <HI>fit only to be hew∣ed down and cast into the Fire.</HI></P>
<P>TRUE <HI>Religion and undefiled before</HI> GOD, says our SAVIOUR, <HI>is this; to visit the Fatherless and Widows in their Affliction.</HI> A Religion, which, as he taught, he practised also. He was himself a <HI>Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief:</HI> Surely he hath born our Sorrows, and suffer'd for our Iniquities; and shall we not shew that Com∣passion to our Fellow-creatures, which he so ten∣derly bestow'd on us; or dare we flatter our∣selves that, if we neglect this impartial Duty, the same all-seeing GOD, who condemns our Inhumanity, will not also punish our Ingra∣titude?</P>
<P>WEEP <HI>with them,</HI> says the wise Man; that is, with all them <HI>that weep.</HI> He does not say with our Parents, our Relations, or our Children; but embraces the whole Range of Nature, and takes in all Mankind. Even our Enemies are to be pitied and relieved. If the Man, who hath in∣jured us, falls into Affliction, we are no longer to consider him as an Adversary, whom we hate, but as a Fellow-creature we must assist. We may remember he is not our Friend, but we must not forget he is our Neighbour.</P>
<P>BUT if the Motives of Reason and Religion are not sufficient to persuade us, Self-Interest, which
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
reigns in every Breast, will exert her Powers to excite us to it. The Tear we refuse to shed over the miseries of others, GOD, and GOD only knows, how soon we may stand in need of. <HI>Great Travail is created for every Man, and an heavy Yoke is upon the Sons of Adam; from him that sitteth upon a Throne of Glory to him that is humbled in Earth and Ashes.</HI> How often does an unexpected Stroke of Fortune put an End to the most extensive Views of Happi∣ness, and change the chearful Scene of Joy and Comfort into a melancholy State of Misery and Despair! If therefore we do not pity those, who are in Affliction, when we fall into it ourselves, who will pity and relieve us? Then shall we remember the Afflictions of <HI>Joseph,</HI> and say as his Brethren did, when they came into Trouble; <HI>We are very guilty concerning our Brother, in that we saw the Anguish of his Soul, when he besought us, and would not hear; therefore is this Distress come upon us.</HI> What black and obdurate Hearts must those Men have, who can look with Indifference and Un∣concern on the Misfortunes of others? Can such Men be honour'd, esteem'd, or trusted in any of the Affairs of Life? Shall we not be always apprehensive, that Villany and Perfidiousness must be the Companions of Pride and Inhuma∣nity? Surely, to be insensible of the Miseries of others is the next Step to rejoicing in them; and the Man, who neglects us when unhappy, would not scruple to make us so.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="8"/>THAT the Duty I am recommending is an important and a necessary one, every impartial Man is, I believe, sufficiently convinced. That it is also easy and delightful, is a Truth scarce less self-evident. It is equally attainable by every Man, in every Station and Profession. A Science, which requires no Superiority of Wealth, Parts, or Knowledge, to make us Ma∣sters of. We have not all of us Riches to be∣stow on the Indigent; we cannot impart Health to the Sick, or restore Youth to the Aged; but we have all of us Eyes to look upon, Hearts to feel for and sympathize with, Tongues to speak to and comfort the Afflicted.</P>
<P>HOW great an Aversion soever the gay and unthinking Part of Mankind may have to all that is grave and melancholy, it may with the greatest Truth be asserted, that he, who is a Stranger to Sorrow, is a Stranger to the best Emotions, the noblest Feelings the human Heart is capable of receiving. In the Cup of Affliction there is always a Cordial thrown in by Providence to make the Draught less bitter, and the very Tears of Virtue administer a more solid Satis∣faction to a right Mind than Vice and Folly have Power to bestow. There is in some Men a re∣markable Tenderness of Disposition, and a Deli∣cacy of Sensation; which those, whom we falsely term the Brave and Resolute, are too often Strangers to; a Disposition which, however we
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
may sometimes ridicule and despise, is what will in the End most intimately unite and endear them to us: Those Things, which in Health and Pros∣perity may raise our Laughter and Contempt, in Sickness and Adversity meet with our Esteem and Approbation; and we seldom know the true Merit of Compassion, till we feel the Want of it.</P>
<P>AS big with Ills as human Life is, yet by the Observance of this short and important Precept of my Text, half the Miseries of Mankind might be softened or removed; for there is scarce a Misfortune we are liable to here, to which the Society, the Sympathy and Condolement of a sincere Friend cannot administer some Re∣lief:</P>
<P>IN Poverty: In Affliction, in Sickness, and in old Age.</P>
<P>IN regard to Poverty, it must indeed be con∣fess'd that the best Method of shewing our Com∣passion to those, who labour under it, is to supply their Necessities; the happy Lot of the Fortunate, whom GOD hath blessed with Abundance. But this is not the only Means, by which the Poor may be relieved. We may <HI>weep with them when they weep, and mourn when they mourn</HI>; and the tender Tear, shed by the good Man over the de∣stitute and unhappy, may perhaps give him as
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
much Consolation as that Alms, which the Proud and Unfeeling bestows on him from Osten∣tation.</P>
<P>IN Regard to Afflictions, it may be observ'd; that amongst those, which daily surrounds us, there are some of so oppressive and violent a Na∣ture as to sink the Soul into a State of the deepest Melancholy and Despair. This is, for the most Part, the Time, when the Mind, too sore to admit of Consolation, will yet find some Relief in the Condolement of a Friend. Tho' we can∣not heal the Wound, we may yet pour a Balm into it to mitigate the Pain; and here the Text points out the exact Method and Measure of our Duty. We must <HI>not fail to weep with them, that weep.</HI> At such a Time, Wit would be odious and Mirth unseasonable. We are to behave in a Manner suitable to the Situation of those we visit; to make use of all the Arts, which Friend∣ship can suggest; to soften their Sorrows; to calm the Tempest of their Grief, and sooth them if possible into Rest, Resignation and For∣getfulness.</P>
<P>IF the Sympathy and Society of a Friend can afford Comfort in Poverty and Affliction, no less is its Efficacy in the unavoidable Ills of Sickness and old Age; and I appeal to the Hearts of all who have languish'd under any of those Distempers our weak Frames are subject to, if ever the Sight of their Friends was so pleasing
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
to their Eyes, or the Voice of those, they lov'd, so sweet to their Ear as when they came in that melancholy Hour of Distress to visit and relieve them.</P>
<P>BUT if we even escape those cruel Disorders, that are the common Portion of Humanity (which how few do Experience will testify) there is, after all, the Disease of old Age to be encoun∣ter'd with; and in that Train of Ills, which attend, there is not perhaps a greater than that Solitude, which generally accompanies it. The old Man has seldom any Amusements but his own Reflections; any constant Companions but his Infirmities. Even the Bonds of natural Affection and the Ties of Kindred are found too weak to hold the Impatience of Youth by the Side of Age and Imbecillity. Here then, above all, should we exercise the Duties of Humanity and Compassion; to support the Steps of the Feeble; to raise the drooping Head, and chear the afflicted Heart. Such humane and tender Of∣fices we shall all, if we live, expect ourselves. They make the Burthen of Years more tolera∣rable; smooth the Bed of Death, and teach us to resign Life with Calmness and Tranquillity into the Hands of HIM that gave it.</P>
<P>IF ever there was a Time for the Subject of my present Discourse to demand your most seri∣ous Attention; if ever the Virtues of Huma∣nity and Compassion had room to exert all their
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
Power, and shine with distinguish'd Lustre; it is at this remarkable and melancholy Sea∣son. The very late dreadful and unforeseen Calamity, which has so alarm'd and terrify'd us, and from which we are ourselves, by the Bles∣sing of GOD, so miraculously deliver'd, call upon me to point out to you but too many most de∣serving, most unhappy Objects of your Commi∣seration. The innumerable, the almost irretrie∣vable Miseries, which Scenes of this Kind are productive of, cannot be conceived, much less express'd. I need not, I believe, exhort you to condole with, to relieve and support, by all the Means in your Power, the unfortunate Sufferers. Terror and Affright have hitherto been the only Sensations they were capable of receiving. They have not yet been sufficiently at Leisure to feel themselves unhappy, or found Time to count their Misfortunes. When those Hours come, I trust we shall not want Tears to <HI>weep with,</HI> or unfeigned Sorrow to <HI>mourn with them</HI>; and in the mean Time it highly concerns us to look nar∣rowly into ourselves. That we are now here; that we possess our Lives and Properties in Safe∣ty; whilst almost every Thing round us lies bu∣ried in Ruin and Desolation, is a signal Instance of the Divine Mercy in our Behalf.</P>
<P>ALL the Parts of this great Metropolis, which have escaped the Fury of this cruel Disaster, ought doubtless, with Hearts full of Gratitude, sincerely to acknowledge the Hand of Providence
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
in their Preservation. But it hath pleased GOD, that the small, the fortunate Number of those, to whom I now address myself, are by a Peculia∣rity of Circumstances those, who, of all Men, have the most Reason to return Thanks to Al∣mighty GOD for his late Mercies vouchsafed unto them. What Praise and Thanksgiving, what Wonder and Adoration is not due to that gracious Being, which hath thus preserved us; who when the devouring Flame had spread Misery and Destruction on our Right Hand and on our Left; when there was nothing but Tears, and <HI>complaining in our Streets,</HI> and we expected every Moment to be swallowed up in the general Ruin, thus stopt it just at our Doors, and said to the destructive Element, <HI>Hitherto shalt thou go, and no further!</HI></P>
<P>LET us then <HI>sin no more, lest a like, or perhaps a worse, Thing happen unto us.</HI> Let the Storm, which hath blown over us, and the Danger we have escaped, teach us the Things, which be∣long to our Peace. Let them stir us up to the important Duties of our Religion. Let us apply ourselves more earnestly to Prayer and Thanks∣giving. I am sure we shall be, of all Men, the most undeserving and ungrateful, if we do not now frequent this House of GOD, when it is to his gracious Mercy alone we are so visibly indebt∣ed for the Preservation of it. A Blessing our un∣fortunate Neighbours are deprived of; who have
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
not a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s Church was so much damaged by the Fire as to make it impossible to perform Divine Service there till repaired.</NOTE> Place of public Worship left, wherein to send up their sad Prayers to GOD for Succour un∣der their Afflictions.</P>
<P>To him therefore, who saved us when we had well nigh perished, let us give, as we are most bounden, continual Thanks; beseeching Him to grant that this his Tenderness towards us, may fill us with the most lively Sense of his Goodness, and the sincerest Acknowledgment of it; that we may lead a new Life, following his Commandments and walking henceforth in his Holy Ways.</P>
<P>THAT as thou, O GOD, hast in the Midst of Judgment remember'd Mercy; as thou hast saved <HI>our Souls from Death, our Eyes from Tears, and our Feet from falling,</HI> we may laud and magnify thy Holy Name, praise, bless and glo∣rify thee, and finally that, as thy Goodness hath interposed to save us in this World, thy Mercy may preserve us in that, which is to come; through JESUS CHRIST our LORD.</P>
