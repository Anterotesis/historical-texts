<HEAD>ELEGY I.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AH stay!—thy wand oblivious o'er my eyes</L>
<L>Yet wave, mild power of sleep!—my pray'r is vain;</L>
<L>She flies, the partial nurse of nature flies,</L>
<L>With all her soothing visionary train.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then let me forth; and near yon flowering thorn</L>
<L>Taste heav'n's pure breath; while rob'd in amber vest,</L>
<L>Fresh from her watry couch, the youthful morn</L>
<L>Steals on the slumbers of the drowzy east.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lo, at her presence, the strong arm of toil,</L>
<L>With glittering sickle, mows the prime of may;</L>
<L>While yon poor hirelings, for the mine's rude soil,</L>
<L>Leave to their sleeping babes their cots of clay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With sturdy step, they cheerly whistle o'er</L>
<L>The path that flings across the reedy plain,</L>
<L>To the deep caverns of that yawning moor,</L>
<L>Whose shaggy breast abhors the golden grain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<L>There, in her green dress, nature never roves,</L>
<L>Spreads the gay lawn, nor lifts the lordly pine,</L>
<L>They see no melting clouds refresh the groves,</L>
<L>No living landscape drawn by hands divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But many a fathom from the sunny breeze,</L>
<L>Their painful way in central night they wear;</L>
<L>Heave the pik'd axes on their bended knees,</L>
<L>Or sidelong the rough quarry slowly tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet while damp vapours chill each reeking brow,</L>
<L>How loudly laughs the jovial voice of mirth;</L>
<L>Pleas'd that the wages of the day allow</L>
<L>A social blaze to cheer their ev'ning hearth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There the chaste housewife, with maternal care,</L>
<L>Her thrifty distaf plies, in grave attire;</L>
<L>Blest to behold her ruddy offspring wear</L>
<L>The full resemblance of their sturdy sire,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To spread with such coarse fare their homely board</L>
<L>As fits the genius of their little fate,</L>
<L>Free from those ills that haunt their pamper'd lord;</L>
<L>To be unhappy we must first be great.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<L>In these dark caves, where heav'n's paternal hand,</L>
<L>Far from the world, their private cradle laid,</L>
<L>They toil secure: the storms that strike the land</L>
<L>With wild dismay, roll harmless o'er their head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For who, the load of weary life to bear,</L>
<L>Wou'd from these murky mansions chace the slave?</L>
<L>Who cease to breathe heav'n's pure and chearful air,</L>
<L>To be but living tenants of the grave?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet harrass'd as they are, their face still wears</L>
<L>The reverend comeliness of green old age;</L>
<L>No stains their mind from worldly science bears;</L>
<L>Their ray of knowledge gleams from nature's page.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The few plain rules her simple lessons give,</L>
<L>They still thro' life with pleas'd attention ply;</L>
<L>Their helpless offspring bid them wish to live,</L>
<L>Their breathless parents bid them learn to die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And surely heav'n, whose penetrating sight</L>
<L>Pierces the soul, and reads its inmost groan,</L>
<L>Must see content, with more sincere delight,</L>
<L>Toil in the mine, than triumph on the throne;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<L>See <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charles V. of Spain, who in the full blaze of his glory, resigned the throne to his son Philip, and retired to a convent in Estremadura.</NOTE> Charles, more pleas'd, within the convent's gloom,</L>
<L>Seeking the slaves calm nights, their temperate days,</L>
<L>And peaceful passage to the private tomb,</L>
<L>Than diadem'd with glory's crimson rays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ev'n the proud sage, whose deep mysterious brain</L>
<L>Has reason'd all the balm of hope away,</L>
<L>Convinc'd that learning's but ingenious pain,</L>
<L>Might hail their happier lot, and sighing say,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Oh had I thus, within the dark profound,</L>
<L>"By daily labor earn'd my daily food;</L>
<L>'Or with yon seedsman sow'd the quickening ground,</L>
<L>"Or cleav'd with ponderous ax the groaning wood!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Full many an hour that now, tho' sped with art,</L>
<L>"On slow and dusky pinions sullen flies,</L>
<L>"Full many an anxious wish, or pang of heart,</L>
<L>"That reason's boasted anodyne defies,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<L>"Had ne'er been born. Nor had th' uneasy mind,</L>
<L>"Pent in the prison of this mortal mould,</L>
<L>"Felt its ethereal energy confin'd,</L>
<L>"Its brightest sunshine in dark clouds enroll'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"But native sense her modest course had run;</L>
<L>"Her saintly lustre untaught virtue spread;</L>
<L>"Health crown'd my toils, and ere the day was done,</L>
<L>"Sound sleep beneath some alder's rustling shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Then, as I stole down life's declining hill,</L>
<L>"Here nature's gifts had furnish'd nature's needs,</L>
<L>"The brook's cold beverage ev'ry latent ill</L>
<L>"Had starv'd, that cloyster'd contemplation feeds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Till, in the peaceful shade of this lone bower,</L>
<L>"Or near yon shattered tower in silence laid,</L>
<L>"The orient orb, that watch'd my natal hour,</L>
<L>"Had brightly glitter'd o'er my mouldering head.</L>

<HEAD>TO SICKNESS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ELEGY II.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HOW blith the flowery graces of the spring</L>
<L>From nature's wardrobe come: and hark how gay</L>
<L>Each glittering insect, hovering on the wing,</L>
<L>Sings their glad welcome to the fields of may.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They gaze, with greedy eye, each beauty o'er;</L>
<L>They suck the sweet breath of the blushing rose;</L>
<L>Sport in the gale, or sip the rainbow shower;</L>
<L>Their life's short day no pause of pleasure knows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Like their's, dread Power, my chearful morn display'd</L>
<L>The flattering promise of a golden noon,</L>
<L>Till each gay cloud, that sportive nature spread,</L>
<L>Died in the gloom of thy distemper'd frown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yes, ere I told my two and twentieth year,</L>
<L>Swift from thy quiver flew the deadly dart;</L>
<L>Harmless it past 'mid many a blith compeer,</L>
<L>And found its fated entrance near my heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<L>Pale as I lay beneath thy ebon wand,</L>
<L>I saw them rove through pleasure's flowery field;</L>
<L>I saw health paint them with her rosy hand,</L>
<L>Eager to burst my bonds, but forc'd to yield.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet while this mortal cot of mould'ring clay</L>
<L>Shakes at the stroke of thy tremendous power,</L>
<L>Ah must the transient tenant of a day</L>
<L>Bear the rough blast of each tempestuous hour!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, shall the terrors thy pale flag unfolds,</L>
<L>Too rigid Queen! unnerve the soul's bright powers,</L>
<L>Till with a joyless smile the eye beholds</L>
<L>Art's magic charms, and nature's fairy bowers.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No, let me follow still, those bowers among,</L>
<L>Her flowery footsteps, as the goddess goes;</L>
<L>Let me, just lifted 'bove th' unletter'd throng,</L>
<L>Read the few books the learned few compose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And suffer, when thy aweful pleasure calls</L>
<L>The soul to share her frail companion's smart,</L>
<L>Yet suffer me to taste the balm that falls,</L>
<L>From friendship's tongue, so sweet upon the heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<L>Then, tho' each trembling nerve confess thy frown,</L>
<L>Ev'n till this anxious being shall become</L>
<L>But a brief name upon a little stone,</L>
<L>Without one murmur I embrace my doom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For many a virtue, shelter'd from mankind,</L>
<L>Lives calm with thee, and lord o'er each desire;</L>
<L>And many a feeble frame, whose mighty mind</L>
<L>Each muse has touch'd with her immortal fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ev'n <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. POPE.</NOTE> He, sole terror of a venal age,</L>
<L>The tuneful bard, whose philosophic soul,</L>
<L>With such bright radiance glow'd on Virtue's page,</L>
<L>Learn'd many a lesson from thy moral school.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. GRAY.</NOTE> too, who <HI>"mounts and keeps his distant way,"</HI></L>
<L>His daring mind thy humanizing glooms</L>
<L>Have temper'd with a melancholy ray,</L>
<L>And taught to warble 'mid the village tombs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yes, goddess, to thy temple's deep recess</L>
<L>I come; and lay for ever at its door</L>
<L>The siren throng of follies numberless,</L>
<L>Nor wish their flattering songs shou'd sooth me more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
<L>Thy decent garb shall oer my limbs be spread,</L>
<L>Thy hand shall lead me to thy sober train,</L>
<L>Who here retir'd, with pensive pleasure tread</L>
<L>The silent windings of thy dark domain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hither the cherub charity shall fly</L>
<L>From her bright orb, and brooding o'er my mind,</L>
<L>For misery raise a sympathizing sigh,</L>
<L>Pardon for foes, and love for humankind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then while ambition's trump, from age to age</L>
<L>Its slaughter'd millions boasts; while fame shall rear</L>
<L>Her deathless trophies o'er the bard and sage,</L>
<L>Be mine the widow's sigh, the orphan's prayer.</L>
