<HEAD>Principles and Progress of MORALITY.</HEAD>
<P>THE science of morals, like other sciences, is in a very imperfect state among savages; and arrives at maturity among enlightened nations by very slow degrees. This progress points out the historical part, as first in order: but as that history would give little satisfaction, without a rule for comparing the morals of different ages, and of different nations, I begin with the prin∣ciples of morality, such as ought to govern at all times, and in all nations. The present sketch ac∣cordingly is divided into two parts. In the first, the principles are unfolded; and the second is al∣together historical.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>HUMAN ACTIONS analysed.</HEAD>
<P>THE hand of God is no where more visible, than in the nice adjustment of our internal frame to our situation in this world. An animal is endued with a power of self-motion; and in performing animal functions, requires not any external aid. This more especially is the case of man, the noblest of terrestrial beings. His heart beats, his blood circulates, his stomach digests, evacuations proceed, &amp;c. &amp;c. By what means? Not surely by the laws of mechanism, which are far from being adequate to such operations. The operations mentioned are effects of an inter∣nal power, bestowed on man for preserving life.
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
The power is exerted uniformly, and without in∣terruption, independent of will, and without consciousness.</P>
<P>Man is a being susceptible of pleasure and pain: these generate desire to attain what is agreeable, and to shun what is disagreeable; and he is enabled by other powers to gratify his desires. One power, termed <HI>instinct,</HI> is exerted indeed with consciousness; but blindly, with∣out will, and without intention to produce any effect. Brute animals act for the most part by instinct: hunger prompts them to eat, and cold, to take shelter; knowingly indeed, but with∣out exerting any act of will, and without fore∣sight of what will happen. Infants of the hu∣man species, little superior to brutes, are, like brutes, governed by instinct: they lay hold of the nipple, without knowing that sucking will satisfy their hunger; and they weep when pain∣ed, without any view of relief<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Akin to these, are certain habitual acts done without thought, such as snuffing or grinning. Custom enables one to move the fingers on an instrument of music, without being directed by will: the motion is often too quick for an act of will. Some arrive at great perfection in the art of balancing: the slightest deviation from the just balance is instantly redressed: were a preceding act of will necessary, it would be too late. An un∣expected hollow in walking, occasions a violent shock: is not this evidence, that external motion is governed by the mind, frequently without consci∣ousness; and that in walking, the body is adjusted be∣fore-hand to what is expected?</NOTE>. Another power is governed by intention and will. In the progress from infancy to maturity, the mind opens to objects, without end, of desire and of
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
aversion, the attaining or shunning of which depend more or less on our own will. We are placed in a wide world, left to our own conduct; and we are by nature provided with a proper power for performing what we intend and will. The actions we perform by this power are term∣ed <HI>voluntary.</HI> There still remain another species of actions, termed <HI>involuntary;</HI> as where we act by some irresistible motive against our will. An action may be voluntary, though done with re∣luctance; as where a man, to free himself from torture, reveals the secrets of his friend: his confession is voluntary, though drawn from him with great reluctance. But let us suppose, that after the firmest resolution to reveal nothing, his mind is unhinged by exquisite torture; the disco∣very he makes may be justly termed <HI>involuntary:</HI> he speaks indeed; but he is compelled to it abso∣lutely against his will.</P>
<P>Man is by his nature an accountable being, an∣swerable for his conduct to God and man. In doing any action that wears a double face, he is prompted by his nature to explain the same to his relations, his friends, his acquaintance; and above all, to those who have authority over him. He hopes for praise for every right action, and dreads blame for every one that is wrong. But for what sort of actions does he hold himself ac∣countable? Not surely for an instinctive action, which is done blindly, without intention, and without will: neither for an involuntary action, because it is extorted from him against his will: and least of all, for actions done without consci∣ousness, such as those which preserve life. What only remain are voluntary actions, which are either right or wrong. Such actions are done wittingly and willingly: for these we must an∣swer,
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
if at all accountable; and for these every man in conscience holds himself bound to an∣swer.</P>
<P>And now more particularly upon voluntary actions. To intend and to will, though com∣monly held synonymous, signify different acts of the mind. Intention respects the effect: Will respects the action that is exerted for pro∣ducing the effect. It is my intention, for ex∣ample, to relieve my friend from distress: upon seeing him, it is my will to give him a sum for his relief: the external act of giving fol∣lows; and my friend is relieved, which is the effect intended. But these internal acts, though in their nature different, are always united: I cannot will the means, without intending the effect; and I cannot intend the effect, without willing the means<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To incline, to resolve, to intend, to will, are acts of the mind relative to external action. These several acts are well understood; though they cannot be de∣fined, being perfectly simple.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some effects of voluntary action follow neces∣sarily: A wound is an effect that necessarily fol∣lows the stabbing a person with a dagger: death is a necessary effect of throwing one down from the battlements of a high tower. Some effects are probable only: I labour in order to provide for my family; fight for my country to rescue it from oppressors; take physic for my health. In such cases, the event intended does not necessarily nor always follow.</P>
<P>A man, when he wills to act, must intend the necessary effect: a person who stabs, cer∣tainly intends to wound. But where the effect
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
is probable only, a man may act without in∣tending the effect that follows: a stone thrown by me at random into the market-place, may happen to wound a man without my intending it. One acts by instinct, without either will or intention: voluntary actions that necessarily produce their effect, imply intention: voluntary actions, when the effect is probable only, are sometimes intended, sometimes not.</P>
<P>Human actions are distinguished from each other by certain <HI>qualities,</HI> termed <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong.</HI> But as these make the corner-stone of morality, they are reserved to the following section.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Division of Human Actions into RIGHT, WRONG, and INDIFFERENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE qualities of right and wrong in voluntary actions, are universally acknowledged as the foundation of morality; and yet philosophers have been strangely perplexed about them. The history of their various opinions, would signify little but to darken the subject: the reader will have more satisfaction in seeing these qualities ex∣plained, without entering at all into controversy.</P>
<P>No person is ignorant of primary and secondary qualities, a distinction much insisted on by philo∣sophers. Primary qualities, such as figure, co∣hesion, weight, are permanent qualities, that ex∣ist in a subject whether perceived or not. Secon∣dary qualities, such as colour, taste, smell, de∣pend on the percipient as much as on the subject, being nothing when not perceived. Beauty and ugliness are qualities of the latter sort: they have no existence but when perceived; and, like all other secondary qualities, they are perceived in∣tuitively; having no dependence on reason nor
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
on judgment, more than colour has, or smell, or taste<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Elements of Criticism, vol. 1. p. 207. edit. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The qualities of right and wrong in voluntary actions, are secondary, like beauty and ugliness, and the other secondary qualities mentioned. Like them, they are objects of intuitive percep∣tion, and depend not in any degree on reason or on judgment. No argument is requisite to prove, that to rescue an innocent babe from the jaws of a wolf, to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, are right actions: they are perceived to be so intuitively. As little is an argument requi∣site to prove, that murder, deceit, perjury, are wrong actions: they are perceived intuitive∣ly to be so. The Deity has bestowed on man, different faculties for different purposes. Truth and falsehood are investigated by the reasoning fa∣culty. Beauty and ugliness are objects of a sense, known by the name of <HI>taste.</HI> Right and wrong are objects of a sense termed the <HI>moral sense</HI> or <HI>conscience.</HI> And supposing these qualities to be hid from our perception, in vain would we try to discover them by any argument, or process of reasoning: the attempt would be absurd; no less so than an attempt to discover colour, by reason∣ing, or taste, or smell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Every perception must proceed from some facul∣ty or power of perception, termed <HI>sense.</HI> The moral sense, by which we perceive the qualities of right and wrong, may be considered either as a branch of the sense of seeing, by which we perceive the actions to which these qualities belong, or as a sense distinct from all others. The senses by which objects are perceived, are not separated from each other by distinct bounda∣ries; and the sorting or classing them, seems to depend more on taste and fancy, than on nature. I have fol∣lowed the plan laid down by former writers; which is, to consider the moral sense as a sense distinct from o∣thers, because it is the easiest and clearest manner of conceiving it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="13"/>
Right and wrong, as mentioned above, are qualities of voluntary actions, and of no other kind. An instinctive action is beneficial, is agreeable: but it cannot properly be denominated either right or wrong. An involuntary act is hurtful to the agent, and disagreeable to the spec∣tator; but in the agent it is neither right nor wrong. These qualities also depend in no de∣gree on the event. Thus, if, to save my friend from drowning, I plunge into a river, the action is right, though I happen to come too late. And if I aim a stroke at a man behind his back, the action is wrong, though I happen not to touch him.</P>
<P>The qualities of right and of agreeable, are in∣separable; and so are the qualities of wrong and of disagreeable. A right action, accordingly, is agreeable, not only in the direct perception, but equally so in every subsequent recollection. And in both circumstances equally, a wrong action is disagreeable.</P>
<P>Right actions are distinguished by the moral sense into two kinds, viz. what <HI>ought</HI> to be done, and what <HI>may</HI> be done, or left undone. Wrong actions admit not that distinction: they are all prohibited to be done. To say that an action ought to be done, means that we are tied or obliged to perform; and to say that an action ought not to be done, means that we are restrain∣ed from doing it. Though the necessity implied in the being tied or obliged, is not physical, but
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
only what is commonly termed <HI>moral;</HI> yet we conceive ourselves deprived of liberty or freedom, and necessarily bound to act or to forbear acting, in opposition to every other motive. The neces∣sity here described is termed <HI>duty.</HI> The moral necessity we are under to forbear harming the in∣nocent, is a proper example: the moral sense de∣clares the restraint to be our duty, which no mo∣tive whatever will excuse us for transgressing.</P>
<P>The duty of performing or forbearing any ac∣tion, implies a <HI>right</HI> in some person to exact per∣formance of that duty; and accordingly, a duty or obligation necessarily infers a corresponding right. A promise on my part to pay L. 100, confers a right to demand performance. The man who commits an injury, violates the <HI>right</HI> of the person injured, which entitles him to demand reparation of the wrong.</P>
<P>Duty is twofold; duty to others, and duty to ourselves. With respect to the former, the doing what we ought to do, is termed <HI>just:</HI> the doing what we ought not to do, and the omitting what we ought to do, are termed <HI>unjust.</HI> With respect to ourselves, the doing what we ought to do, is termed <HI>proper:</HI> the doing what we ought not to do, and the omitting what we ought to do, are termed <HI>improper.</HI> Thus, <HI>right,</HI> signifying a quality of certain actions, is a genus; of which <HI>just</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> are species: <HI>wrong,</HI> signifying a quality of other actions, is a genus; of which <HI>unjust</HI> and <HI>improper</HI> are species.</P>
<P>Right actions left to our free will, to be done, or left undone, come next in order. They are, like the former, right when done; but they dif∣fer, in not being wrong when left undone. To remit a just debt for the sake of a growing family, to yield a subject in controversy rather than go to law with a neighbour, generously to return
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
good for ill, are examples of this species. They are universally approved as right actions: but as no person has a right or title to obligue us to per∣form such actions, the leaving them undone is not a wrong: no person is injured by the forbearance. Actions that come under this class, shall be termed <HI>arbitrary,</HI> for want of a more proper designation.</P>
<P>So much for right actions, and their divisions. Wrong actions are of two kinds, <HI>criminal</HI> and <HI>cul∣pable.</HI> What are done intentionally to produce mischief, are criminal: such rash or unguarded actions as produce mischief without intention, are culpable. The former are restrained by pu∣nishment, to be handled in the 5th section; the latter by reparation, to be handled in the 6th.</P>
<P>The divisions of voluntary actions are not yet exhausted. Some there are that, properly speak∣ing, cannot be denominated either right or wrong. Actions done merely for amusement or pastime, without intention to produce good or ill, are of that kind; leaping, for example, running, jumping over a stick, throwing a stone to make circles in the water. Such actions are neither approved nor disapproved: they may be termed <HI>indifferent.</HI></P>
<P>There is no cause for doubting the existence of the moral sense, more than for doubting the ex∣istence of the sense of beauty, of seeing, or of hearing. In fact, the perception of right and wrong as qualities of actions, is no less distinct and clear, than that of beauty, of colour, or of any other quality; and as every perception is an act of sense, the sense of beauty is not with grea∣ter certainty evinced from the perception of beau∣ty, than the moral sense is from the perception of right and wrong. We find this sense distributed among individuals in different degrees of perfec∣tion: but there perhaps never existed any one
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
above the condition of an idiot, who possessed it not in some degree; and were any man intirely destitute of it, the terms <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> would be to him no less unintelligible, than the term colour is to one born blind.</P>
<P>That every individual is endued with a sense of right and wrong, more or less distinct, will pro∣bably be granted; but whether there be among men what may be termed a <HI>common sense</HI> of right and wrong, producing uniformity of opinion as to right and wrong, is not so evident. There is no absurdity in supposing the opinions of men about right and wrong, to be as various as about beauty and deformity: and that this supposition is not destitute of foundation, we are led to sus∣pect, upon discovering that in different countries, and even in the same country at different times, the opinions publicly espoused with regard to right and wrong, are extremely various; that among some nations it was held lawful for a man to sell his children for slaves, and in their infancy to abandon them to wild beasts; that it was held equally lawful to punish children, even capitally, for the crime of their parent; that the murdering an enemy in cold blood, was once a common practice; that human sacrifices, impious no less than immoral according to our notions, were of old universal; that even in later times, it has been held meritorious, to inflict cruel torments for the slightest deviations from the religious creed of the plurality; and that among the most en∣lightened nations, there are considerable differen∣ces with respect to the rules of morality.</P>
<P>These facts tend not to disprove the reality of a common sense in morals: they only prove, that the moral sense has not been equally perfect at all times, nor in all countries. This branch of the history of morality, is reserved for the second
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
part. To give some present satisfaction, I shall shortly observe, that the savage state is the in∣fancy of man; during which, the more delicate senses lie dormant, leaving nations to the authori∣ty of custom, of imitation, and of passion, with∣out any just taste of morals more than of the fine arts: but nations, like individuals, ripen gradually, and acquire a refined taste in morals as well as in the fine arts: after which we find great uniformity of opinion about the rules of right and wrong; with few exceptions, but what may proceed from im∣becility, or corrupted education. There may be found, it is true, even in the most enlightened ages, men who have singular notions of morali∣ty; and there may be found the like singularity upon many other subjects: which no more af∣fords an argument against a common sense or standard of right and wrong, than a monster doth against the standard that regulates our external form, or than an exception doth against the truth of a general proposition.</P>
<P>That there is in mankind an uniformity of opinion with respect to right and wrong, is a matter of fact of which the only infallible evi∣dence is observation and experience: and to that evidence I appeal; entering only a caveat, that, for the reason above given, the enquiry be con∣fined to enlightened nations. In the mean time, I take liberty to suggest an argument from analo∣gy, That if there be great uniformity among the different tribes of men in seeing and hearing, in pleasure and pain, in judging of truth and error, the same uniformity ought to hold with respect to right and wrong. Whatever minute differences there may be to distinguish one person from ano∣ther, yet in the general principles that constitute our nature, internal and external, there is won∣derful uniformity.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="18"/>
This uniformity of sentiment, which may be termed <HI>the common sense of mankind with respect to right and wrong,</HI> is essential to social beings. Did the moral sentiments of men differ as much as their faces, they would be altogether unqualified for society: discord and controversy would be end∣less, and <HI>major vis</HI> would be the only rule of <HI>me∣um et tuum.</HI></P>
<P>But such uniformity of sentiment, though ge∣neral, is not altogether universal: men there are, as above mentioned, who differ from the com∣mon sense of mankind with respect to various points of morality. What ought to be the con∣duct of such men? ought they to regulate their conduct by that standard, or by their private con∣viction? There will be occasion afterward to ob∣serve, that we judge of others as we believe they judge of themselves; and that private conviction is the standard for rewards and punishments<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 5.</NOTE>. But with respect to every controversy about pro∣perty and pecuniary interest, and, in general, about every civil right and obligation, the common sense of mankind is the standard, and not private conviction or conscience; which I shall endeavour to make out as follows.</P>
<P>We have an innate sense of a common nature, not only in our own species, but in every species of animals. And that the fact corresponds to our sense of it, is verified by experience; for there appears a remarkable uniformity in creatures of the same kind, and a difformity, no less remark∣able, in creatures of a different kind. As that common nature is perceived to be a model or standard for each individual of the kind, it raises wonder to find an individual deviating from the common nature of the species, whether in its in∣ternal
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
or external structure: a child born with aversion to its mother's milk, is a wonder, no less than if born without a mouth, or with more than one.</P>
<P>Secondly, The innate sense mentioned dictates, that the common nature of man in particular, is invariable as well as universal; that it will be the same hereafter as it is at present, and as it was in time past, the same among all nations, and in all corners of the earth: nor are we deceived; because, allowing for slight differences occasioned by culture and other accidental circumstances, the fact corresponds to our perception.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We perceive that this common nature is <HI>right</HI> and <HI>perfect,</HI> and that it <HI>ought</HI> to be a model or standard for every human being. Any re∣markable deviation from it in the structure of an individual, appears imperfect or irregular; and raises a painful emotion: a monstrous birth, exciting curiosity in philosophers, fails not at the same time to excite aversion in every spectator.</P>
<P>This sense of perfection in the common nature of man, comprehends every branch of his nature, and particularly the common sense of mankind with respect to right and wrong; which accord∣ingly is perceived by all to be perfect, having authority over all men as the ultimate and uner∣ring standard of morals, even in contradiction to private conviction. Thus, a law in our nature binds us to regulate our conduct by that standard: its authority is universally acknowledged, as no∣thing is more common in every dispute about <HI>meum et tuum,</HI> than an appeal to it as the ultimate and unerring standard.</P>
<P>At the same time, as that standard through in∣firmity or prejudice, is not conspicuous to every individual, many are misled into erroneous opini∣ons, by mistaking a false standard for that of
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
nature. And hence a distinction between a right and a wrong sense in morals; a distinction which every one understands, but which, unless for the conviction of a moral standard, would be altoge∣ther unintelligible.</P>
<P>The final cause of this branch of our nature is conspicuous. Were there no standard of right and wrong for determining endless controversies about matters of interest, the strong would have recourse to force, the weak to cunning, and so∣ciety would be intolerable. Courts of law could afford no remedy; for without a standard of mo∣rals, their decisions would be arbitrary, and of no authority. Happy it is for men to be provided with such a standard: it is necessary in society that our actions be uniform with respect to right and wrong; and in order to uniformity of action, it is necessary that our perceptions of right and wrong be also uniform: to pro∣duce such uniformity, a standard of morals is in∣dispensable. Nature has provided us with that standard, which is daily applied by courts of law with success.</P>
<P>In reviewing what is said, it must afford great satisfaction, to find morality established upon the most solid of all foundations, viz. intuitive per∣ception, which is not only a single mental act, but is complete in itself, having no dependence on any antecedent proposition. The most accurate reasoning affords not equal conviction; for every sort of reasoning, as explained in the sketch im∣mediately foregoing, requires not only self-evident truths or axioms to found upon, but employs over and above various propositions to bring out its conclusions. By intuitive percep∣tion solely, without reasoning, we acquire know∣ledge of right and wrong; of what we may do, of what we ought to do, and of what we ought
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
to abstain from: and considering that we have thus greater certainty of moral laws, than of any proposition discoverable by reasoning, man may well be deemed a favourite of heaven, when he is so admirably qualified for acting the part that is agreeable to his Maker. The moral sense or conscience is the voice of God within us; con∣stantly admonishing us of our duty, and requi∣ring from us no exercise of our faculties but at∣tention merely. The celebrated Locke ventured what he thought a bold conjecture, That moral duties might be susceptible of demonstration: how agreeable would the discovery have been to him, that they are founded upon intuitive per∣ception, still more convincing and authoritative!</P>
<P>By one branch of the moral sense, we are taught what we ought to do, and what we ought not to do; and by another branch, what we may do, or leave undone. But society would be im∣perfect, if the moral sense stopped here. There is no particular that tends more to complete so∣ciety, than what is mentioned in the first section, viz. That every man is accountable for his con∣duct to his fellow-creatures; and he is rendered accountable by a third branch of the moral sense, which teaches him, that this is his duty. And it will be made evident afterward, in the 3d sketch, that we are accountable to our Maker, as well as to our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>To complete this theory, I add, that an action is right or wrong, independent of the actor's own opinion. Thus, when a man, excited by friendship or pity, rescues a heretic from the flames, the action is right, even though he think it wrong, from a conviction that heretics ought to be burnt. But we apply a different rule to those who act: a man is approved, and held to be innocent, when he does what he him∣self
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
thinks right; he is disapproved, and held to be guilty, when he does what he himself thinks wrong. Thus, to assassinate an atheist for the sake of religion, is a wrong action; and yet the enthusiast who commits that wrong, may be innocent: and one is guilty who, against conscience, eats meat in lent, though the action is not wrong. In short, an action is perceiv∣ed to be right or wrong, independent of the actor's own opinion: but he is approved or dis∣approved, held to be innocent or guilty, according to his own opinion.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Laws of Nature respecting our MORAL CON∣DUCT IN SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<P>A Standard being thus established for regulat∣ing our moral conduct in society, we pro∣ceed to investigate the laws that result from it. But first we take under consideration, what other principles concur with the moral sense to qualify men for society.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="23"/>
When we reflect on the different branches of human knowledge, it might seem, that of all subjects human nature should be the best under∣stood; because every man has daily opportunities to study it, in his own passions and in his own actions. But human nature, an interesting sub∣ject, is seldom left to the investigation of philo∣sophy. Writers of a sweet disposition and warm imagination hold, that man is a benevolent be∣ing, and that every man ought to direct his con∣duct for the good of all, without regarding him∣self but as one of the number<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lord Shaftesbury.</NOTE>. Those of a cold temperament, and contracted mind, hold him to be an animal entirely selfish; to evince which, examples are accumulated without end<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Helvetius,</NOTE>. Neither of these systems is that of na∣ture. The selfish system is contradicted by the experience of all ages, affording the clearest evi∣dence, that men frequently act for the sake of others, without regarding themselves, and some∣times in direct opposition to their own interest. And however much selfishness may prevail in ac∣tion, it certainly prevails not in sentiment and affection: all men conspire to put a high estima∣tion upon generosity, benevolence and other soci∣al virtues; while even the most selfish are dis∣gusted with selfishness in others, and endeavour to hide it in themselves. The most zealous pa∣tron of the selfish principle will not venture to maintain, that it renders us altogether indifferent about our fellow-creatures. Laying aside self-interest, with every connection of love and ha∣tred, good fortune happening to any one is agree∣able
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
to all, and bad fortune happening to any one is disagreeable to all. On the other hand, the system of universal benevolence, is no less con∣tradictory to experience: from which we learn, that men commonly are disposed to prefer their own interest before that of others, especially where there is no strict connection: nor do we find that such bias is opposed by the moral sense. Man in fact is a complex being, composed of principles, some benevolent, some selfish: and these principles are so justly blended in his na∣ture, as to fit him for acting a proper part in so∣ciety. It would indeed be losing time to prove, that without some affection for his fellow-crea∣tures he would be ill qualified for society. And it will be made evident afterward<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 4.</NOTE>, that uni∣versal benevolence would be more hurtful to so∣ciety, than even absolute selfishness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Many moralists enter so deeply into one passion or bias of human nature, that, to use the painter's phrase, they quite overcharge it. Thus I have seen a whole system of morals founded upon a single pillar of the inward frame; and the entire conduct of life, and all the characters in it, accounted for, sometimes from superstition, sometimes from pride, and most commonly from interest. They forget how various a creature it is they are painting; how many springs and weights, nicely adjusted and ba∣lanced, enter into the movement, and require al∣lowance to be made for their several clogs and im∣pulses, ere you can define its operation and de∣fects."</Q> <HI>Enquiry into the life and writings of Homer.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>We are now prepared for investigating the laws that result from the foregoing principles. The several duties we owe to others shall be first
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>
discussed, taking them in order, according to the extent of their influence. And for the sake of perspicuity, I shall first present them in a gene∣ral view, and then proceed to particulars. Of our duties to others, one there is so extensive, as to have for its object all the innocent part of mankind. It is the duty that prohibits us to hurt others: than which no law is more clearly dicta∣ted by the moral sense; nor is the transgression of any other law more deeply stamped with the character of wrong. A man may be hurt ex∣ternally in his goods, in his person, in his re∣lations, and in his reputation. Hence the laws, Do not steal; Defraud not others; Do not kill nor wound; Be not guilty of defamation. A man may be hurt internally, by an action that occasions to him distress of mind, or by being impressed with false notions of men and things. Therefore conscience dictates, that we ought not to treat men disrespectfully; that we ought not causelessly to alienate their affections from others; and, in general, that we ought to forbear what∣ever may tend to break their peace of mind, or tend to unqualify them for being good men, and good citizens.</P>
<P>The duties mentioned are duties of restraint. Our active duties regard particular persons; such as our relations, our friends, our benefac∣tors, our masters, our servants. It is our duty to honour and obey our parents; and to establish our children in the world with all advantages internal and external: we ought to be faithful to our friends, grateful to our benefactors, sub∣missive to our masters, kind to our servants, and to aid and comfort every one of these persons when in distress. To be obliged to do good to others beyond these bounds, must depend on po∣sitive
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>
engagement; for, as will appear afterward, universal benevolence is not a duty.</P>
<P>This general sketch will prepare us for particu∣lars. The duty of restraint comes first in view, that which bars us from harming the innocent; and to it corresponds a right in the innocent to be safe from harm. This is the great law prepa∣ratory to society; because without it, society could never have existed. Here the moral sense is inflexible: it dictates, that we ought to sub∣mit to any distress, even death itself, rather than procure our own safety by laying violent hands upon an innocent person. And we are under the same restraint with respect to the property of an∣other; for robbery and theft are never upon any pretext indulged. It is indeed true, that in ex∣treme hunger I may lawfully take food where it can be found; and may freely lay hold of my neighbour's horse, to carry me from an enemy who threatens death. But it is his duty as a fel∣low creature to assist me in distress; and when there is no time for delay, I may lawfully use what he ought to offer were he present, and what I may presume he would offer. For the same reason, if in a storm my ship be driven among the anchor-ropes of another ship, I may lawfully cut the ropes in order to get free. But in every case of this kind, it would be a wrong in me to use my neighbour's property, without resolving to pay the value. If my neighbour be bound to aid me in distress, conscience binds me to make up his loss<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This doctrine is obviously founded on justice; and yet, in the Roman law, there are two passages which deny any recompence in such cases. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Item Labeo scribit, si cum vi ventorum navis impulsa esset in funes anchorarum alterius, et nautae funes praeci∣dissent; si nullo alio modo, nisi praecisis funibus, explicare se potuit, nullam actionem dandam;"</Q> <HI>l.</HI> 29. § 3. <HI>ad leg.

Thus Celsus puts the case of a person who, to stop the progress of a fire, pulls down his neigh∣bour's house; and whether the fire had reached that house which is pulled down, or was extinguish∣ed before it got to it, in neither case, he thinks, will an action be competent from the Aquilian law."]</Q>—These opinions are undoubtedly errone∣ous. And it is not difficult to say what has occasioned the error: the cases mentioned are treated as belong∣ing to the <HI>lex Aquilia;</HI> which being confined to the reparation of wrongs, lays it justly down for a rule, That no action for reparation can lie, where there is no <HI>culpa.</HI> But had Labeo and Celsus adverted, that these cases belong to a different head, viz. the duty of recompense, where one suffers loss by benefitting another, they themselves would have had no difficulty of sustaining a claim for making up that loss.</NOTE>.</P>

The prohibition of hurting others internally, is perhaps not essential to the formation of socie∣ties, because the transgression of that law doth
<PB N="24" REF="28"/>
not much alarm plain people: but where man∣ners and refined sentiments prevail, the mind is susceptible of more grievous wounds than the bo∣dy; and therefore, without that law, a polished society could have no long endurance.</P>
<P>By adultery, mischief is done both external and internal. Each sex is so constituted, as to re∣quire strict fidelity and attachment in a mate: and the breach of these duties is the greatest exter∣nal harm that can befal them: it harms them also internally, by breaking their peace of mind. It has indeed been urged, that no harm will ensue, if the adultery be kept secret; and consequently, that there can be no crime where there is no dis∣covery. But such as reason thus do not advert, that to declare secret adultery to be lawful, is in effect to overturn every foundation of mutual trust and fidelity in the married state. It is clear beyond all doubt, says a reputable writer, that no man is permitted to violate his faith; and that the man is unjust and barbarous who deprives his wife of the only reward she has for adhering to the austere duties of her sex. But an unfaithful wife is still more criminal, by dissolving the whole ties of nature: in giving to her husband children that are not his, she betrays both, and joins per∣fidy to infidelity<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Emile, liv. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Veracity is commonly ranked among the active duties; but erroneously: for if a man be not bound to speak, he cannot be bound to speak truth. It is therefore only a restraining duty, prohibiting us to deceive others, by affirming what is not true. Among the many correspond∣ing principles in the human mind that in con∣junction tend to make society comfortable, a prin∣ciple
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>
of veracity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Truth is always uppermost, being the natural is∣sue of the mind: it requires no art nor training, no inducement nor temptation, but only that we yield to natural impulse. Lying, on the contrary, is doing vi∣olence to our nature; and is never practised, even by the worst of men, without some temptation. Speak∣ing truth is like using our natural food, which we would do from appetite although it answered no end: lying is like taking physic, which is nauseous to the taste, and which no man takes but for some end which he cannot otherwise attain. <HI>Dr. Reid's Enquiry into the human mind.</HI></NOTE>, and a principle that leads us to rely on human testimony, are two: without the latter, the former would be an useless prin∣ciple; and without the former, the latter would lay us open to fraud and treachery. The moral sense accordingly dictates, that we ought to ad∣here strictly to truth, without regard to conse∣quences.</P>
<P>It must not be inferred, that we are bound to explain our thoughts, when truth is demand∣ed from us by unlawful means. Words uttered voluntarily, are naturally relied on, as expressing the speaker's mind; and if his mind differ from his words, he tells a lie, and is guilty of deceit. But words drawn from a man by torture, are no indication of his mind; and he is not guilty of deceit in uttering whatever words may be agree∣able, however alien from his thoughts: if the author of the unlawful violence suffer himself to be deceived, he ought to blame himself, not the speaker.</P>
<P>It need scarce be mentioned, that the duty of veracity excludes not fable, nor any liberty of speech intended for amusement solely.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="30"/>
Active duties, as hinted above, are all of them directed to particular persons. And the first I shall mention is, that which subsists between a parent and child. The relation of parent and child, the strongest that can exist between indi∣viduals, binds these persons to exert their utmost powers in mutual good offices. Benevolence among other blood-relations, is also a duty; but not so indispensable, being proportioned to the inferior degree of relation.</P>
<P>Gratitude is a duty directed to the person who has been kind to us. But though gratitude is strictly a duty, the measure of performance, and the kind, are left mostly to our own choice. It is scarce necessary to add, that the active duties now mentioned, are acknowledged by all to be absolutely inflexible, perhaps more so than the restraining duties: many find excuses for doing harm; but no one hears with patience an ex∣cuse for deviating from truth, friendship, or gratitude.</P>
<P>Distress tends to convert benevolence into a du∣ty. But distress alone is not sufficient, without other concurring circumstances: for to relieve every person in distress, is beyond the power of any human being. Our relations in distress claim that duty from us, and even our neighbours: but distant distress, without a particular connection, scarce rouses our sympathy, and never is an ob∣ject of duty. Many other connections, too nu∣merous for this short essay, extend the duty of relieving others from distress; and these make a large branch of equity. Though in various in∣stances, benevolence is thus converted into a du∣ty by distress, it follows not, that the duty is al∣ways proportioned to the degree of distress. Na∣ture has more wisely provided for the support of virtue. A virtuous person in distress commands
<PB N="27" REF="31"/>
our pity: a vicious person in distress has much less influence; and if by vice he have brought on the distress, indignation is raised, not pi∣ty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Elements of Criticism, vol. 1. p. 187. edit. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>One great advantage of society, is the co-operation of many to accomplish some useful work, where a single hand would be insufficient. Arts, manufactures, and commercial dealings, re∣quire many hands: but as hands cannot be secur∣ed without a previous engagement, the perfor∣mance of promises and covenants, is, upon that account, a capital duty in society. In their ori∣ginal occupations of hunting and fishing, men liv∣ing scattered and dispersed, have seldom oppor∣tunity to aid and benefit each other; and in that situation, covenants being of little use, are little regarded: but husbandry requiring the co-opera∣tion of many hands, draws men together for mu∣tual assistance; and then covenants make a figure: arts and commerce make them more and more ne∣cessary; and in a polished society great regard is paid to them.</P>
<P>But contracts and promises are not confined to commercial dealings: they serve also to make be∣nevolence a duty; and are even extended to con∣nect the living with the dead: a man would die with regret, if he thought his friends were not bound by their promises, to fulfil his will after his death: and to quiet the minds of men with re∣spect to futurity, the moral sense makes the per∣forming such promises our duty. Thus, if I pro∣mise to my friend to erect a monument for him after his death, conscience binds me, even though
<PB N="28" REF="32"/>
no person alive be entitled to demand perfor∣mance: every one perceives this to be my duty; and I must expect to suffer reproach and blame, if I neglect my engagement.</P>
<P>To fulfil a rational promise or covenant, deli∣berately made, is a duty no less inflexible than those duties are which arise independent of con∣sent. But as man is fallible, often misled by ig∣norance or error, and liable to be deceived, his condition would be deplorable, did the moral sense compel him to fulfil every engagement, however imprudent or irrational. Here the mo∣ral sense gives way to human infirmity: it relieves from deceit, from imposition, from ignorance, from error; and binds a man by no engagement but what answers the end fairly intended.</P>
<P>The other branch of duties, viz. those we owe to ourselves, shall be discussed in a few words. <HI>Propriety,</HI> a branch of the moral sense, regulates our conduct with respect to ourselves; as <HI>Justice,</HI> another branch of the moral sense, regulates our conduct with respect to others. Propriety dic∣tates, that we ought to act up to the dignity of our nature, and to the station allotted us by Pro∣vidence: it dictates in particular, that temper∣ance, prudence, modesty, and uniformity of con∣duct, are self duties. These duties contribute to private happiness, by preserving health, peace of mind, and self-esteem; which are inestimable blessings: they contribute no less to happiness in society, by gaining the love and esteem of others, and aid and support in time of need.</P>
<P>Upon reviewing the foregoing duties respect∣ing others, we find them more or less extensive; but none so extensive as to have for their end the good of mankind in general. The most ex∣tensive duty is that of restraint, prohibiting us to harm others: but even that duty has a limited
<PB N="29" REF="33"/>
end; for its purpose is only to protect others from mischief, not to do them any positive good. The active duties of doing positive good are circumscribed within still narrower bounds, re∣quiring some relation that connects us with o∣thers; such as those of parent, child, friend, benefactor. The slighter relations, unless in pe∣culiar circumstances, are not the foundation of any active duty: neighbourhood, for example, does not alone make benevolence a duty: but supposing a neighbour to be in distress, it be∣comes our duty to relieve him, if it can be done without distress to ourselves. The duty of reliev∣ing from distress, seldom goes farther; for though we always sympathise with our relations, and with those under our eye, the distress of persons remote and unknown affects us very little. Pac∣tions and agreements become necessary, if we would extend the duty of benevolence, in any particular, beyond the limits mentioned. Men, it is true, are capable of doing more good than is required of them as a duty; but every such good must be a free-will offering.</P>
<P>And this leads to arbitrary actions, viz. those that may be done or left undone; which make the second general head of moral actions. With respect to these, the moral sense leaves us at freedom: a benevolent act is approved, but the omission is not condemned. This holds strictly in single acts; but in viewing the whole of a man's conduct, the moral sense appears to vary a little. As the nature of man is complex, partly social, partly selfish, we have an intuitive per∣ception, that our conduct ought to be con∣formable to our nature; and that in advancing our own interest, we ought not altogether to ne∣glect that of others. The man accordingly who confines his whole time and thoughts within his
<PB N="30" REF="34"/>
own little sphere, is condemned by all the world as guilty of wrong conduct; and the man him∣self, if his moral perceptions be not blunted by selfishness, must be sensible that he deserves to be condemned. On the other hand, it is possible that free benevolence may be extended beyond proper bounds. The just temperament is a sub∣ordination of benevolence to self-love: but where benevolence prevails, it commonly leads to ex∣cess, by prompting a man to sacrifice a great in∣terest of his own to a small interest of others; and the moral sense dictates, that such conduct is wrong.</P>
<P>Thus, moral actions are divided into two clas∣ses: the first regards our duty, containing actions that ought to be done, and actions that ought not to be done; the other regards arbitrary actions, containing actions that are right when done, but not wrong when left undone. The well-being of society depends more on the first class than on the second: society is indeed promoted by the latter; but it can scarce subsist, unless the former be made our duty. Hence it is, that actions only of the first class are made indispensable; those of the other class being left to our free-will. And hence also it is, that the various propensities that dispose us to actions of the first sort, are distin∣guished by the name of <HI>primary virtues;</HI> leaving the name of <HI>secondary virtues</HI> to those propensi∣ties which dispose us to actions of the other sort<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Virtue signifies that disposition of mind which gives the ascendant to moral principles. Vice signifies that disposition of mind which gives little or no as∣cendant to moral principles.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="35"/>
The deduction above given makes it evident, that the general tendency of right actions is to promote the good of society, and of wrong acti∣ons, to obstruct that good. Universal benevo∣lence is indeed not required of man; because to put that principle in practice, is beyond his ut∣most abilities. But for promoting the general good, every thing is required of him that he can accomplish; which will appear from reviewing the foregoing duties. The prohibition of harm∣ing others is an easy task; and upon that account is made universal. Our active duties are very different: man is circumscribed both in capacity and power: he cannot do good but in a slow suc∣cession; and therefore it is wisely ordered, that his obligation to do good should be confined to his relations, his friends, his benefactors. Even distress makes not benevolence a general duty: all a man can readily do, is to relieve those at hand; and accordingly we hear of distant misfor∣tunes with little or no concern.</P>
<P>At the same time, let not the moral system be misapprehended, as if it were our duty, or even lawful, to prosecute what upon the whole we reckon the most beneficial to society, balancing ill with good. The moral sense permits not a vi∣olation of any person's right, however trivial, whatever benefit may thereby accrue to another. A man, for example, in low circumstances, by denying a debt he owes to a rich miser, saves himself and a hopeful family from ruin. In that case, the good effect far outweighs the ill, or ra∣ther has no counterbalance: but the moral sense permits not the debtor to balance ill with good; nor gives countenance to an unjust act, whatever benefit it may produce. And hence a maxim in which all moralists agree, That we must not do
<PB N="32" REF="36"/>
ill to bring about even the greatest good; the fi∣nal cause of which shall be given below<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 7.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>Principles of DUTY and of BENEVOLENCE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus shortly delineated the moral laws of our nature, we proceed to an arti∣cle of great importance, which is, to enquire in∣to the means provided by our Maker for compel∣ling obedience to these laws. The moral sense is an unerring guide; but the most expert guide will not profit those who are not disposed to fol∣low. This consideration makes it evident, that to complete the moral system, we ought to be en∣dued with some principle or propensity, some impulsive power, to enforce obedience to the laws dictated by the moral sense.</P>
<P>The author of our nature leaves none of his works imperfect. In order to render us obsequi∣ous to the moral sense as our guide, he hath im∣planted in our nature the principles of duty, of benevolence, of rewards and punishments, and of reparation. It may possibly be thought, that
<PB N="33" REF="37"/>
rewards and punishments, of which afterward, are sufficient of themselves to enforce the laws of nature, without necessity of any other principle. Human laws, it is true, are enforced by these means; because no higher sanction is under com∣mand of a terrestrial legislator. But the celesti∣al legislator, with power that knows no control, and benevolence that knows no bounds, hath en∣forced his laws by means no less remarkable for mildness than for efficacy: he employs no exter∣nal compulsion; but, in order to engage our will on the right side, hath in the breast of every in∣dividual established the principles of duty and of benevolence, which efficaciously excite us to obey the dictates of the moral sense.</P>
<P>As the restraining, as well as active duties, are essential to society, our Maker has wisely orde∣red, that the principle which enforces these se∣veral duties, should be the most cogent of all that belong to our nature. Other principles may solicit, allure, or terrify; but the principle of duty assumes authority, commands, and must be obeyed.</P>
<P>As one great purpose of society, is to furnish opportunities without end of mutual aid and sup∣port, nature seconding that purpose, hath pro∣vided the principle of benevolence; which ex∣cites us to be kind, beneficent, and generous. Nor ought it to escape observation, that the Au∣thor of nature, attentive to our wants and to our well-being, hath endued us with a liberal portion of that principle. It enforces benevolence, not only to those we are connected with, but to our neighbours, and even to those we are barely ac∣quainted with. Providence is peculiarly attentive to objects in distress, who require immediate aid and relief. To the general principle of benevo∣lence, it hath superadded the passion of pity,
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>
which in every feeling heart is irresistible. To make benevolence more extensive, would be fruitless, because here are objects in plenty to fill the most capacious mind. It would not be fruitless only, but hurtful to society: I say hurt∣ful; for inability to procure gratification, rende∣ring benevolence a troublesome guest, would weaken the principle itself, and attach us the more to selfishness, which we can always gratify. At the same time, though there is not room for greater variety of particular objects, yet the fa∣culty we have of uniting numberless individuals in one complex object, enlarges greatly the sphere of benevolence: by that faculty our coun∣try, our government, our religion, become ob∣jects of public spirit, and of a lively affection. The individuals that compose the group, consi∣dered apart, may be too minute, or too distant, for our benevolence; but when comprehended in one great whole, accumulation makes them great, greatness renders them conspicuous; and affecti∣on, preserved entire and undivided, is bestowed upon an abstract object, as upon one that is sin∣gle and visible; but with much greater energy, being proportioned to its superior dignity and im∣portance. Thus it appears, that the principle of benevolence is not too sparingly scattered among men. It is indeed made subordinate to self-inte∣rest, which is wisely ordered, as will afterward be made evident<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 7.</NOTE>; but its power and extent are nicely proportioned to the limited capacity of man, and to his situation in this world; so as better to fulfil its destination, than if it were an overmatch for self-interest, and for every other principle.</P>

<HEAD>Laws respecting REWARDS and PUNISHMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>REFLECTING on the moral branch of our nature, qualifying us for society in a man∣ner suited to our capacity, we cannot overlook the hand of our Maker; for means so finely ad∣justed to an important end, never happen by chance. It must however be acknowledged, that in many individuals, the principle of duty has not vigour nor authority sufficient to stem every tide of unruly passion: by the vigilance of some passions, we are taken unguarded; deluded by the fly insinuations of others; or overwhelmed with the stormy impetuosity of a third sort. Moral evil is thus introduced; and much wrong is done. This new scene suggests to us, that there must be some article still wanting, to complete the mo∣ral system. The means provided for directing us in the road of duty have been explained: but as in deviating from the road wrongs are committed, nothing hitherto has been said, about redressing such wrongs, nor about preventing the reiteration of them. To accomplish these important ends, there are added to the moral system, laws rela∣tive
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
to rewards and punishments, and to repara∣tion; of which in their order.</P>
<P>Many animals are qualified for society by in∣stinct merely; such as beavers, sheep, monkeys, bees, rooks. But men are seldom led by instinct: their actions are commonly prompted by passions; of which there is an endless variety, social and selfish, benevolent and malevolent. And were every passion equally entitled to gratification, man would be utterly unqualified for society: he would be a ship without a rudder, obedient to every wind, and moving at random, without any ultimate destination. The faculty of reason would make no opposition: for were there no sense of wrong, it would be reasonable to gratify every desire that harms not ourselves: and to talk of punishment would be absurd; for punishment, in its very idea, implies some wrong that ought to be redressed. Hence the necessity of the moral sense, to qualify us for society: by instructing us in our duty, it renders us accountable for our conduct, and makes us susceptible of rewards and punishments. The moral sense fulfils another valuable purpose: it erects in man an unerring standard for the application and measure of re∣wards and punishments.</P>
<P>To complete the system of rewards and punish∣ments, it is necessary that a provision be made, both of power and of willingness to reward and punish. The Author of our nature hath provi∣ded amply for the former, by entitling every man to reward and punish as his native privilege. And he has provided for the latter, by a noted principle in our nature, prompting us to exercise the power. Impelled by that principle, we re∣ward the virtuous with approbation and esteem, and punish the vicious with disapprobation and contempt. So prevalent is the principle, that
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>
we have great satisfaction in rewarding, and no less in punishing.</P>
<P>As to punishment in particular, an action done intentionally to produce mischief, is criminal, and merits punishment. Such an action, being disa∣greeable, raises my resentment, even where I have no connection with the person injured; and the principle under consideration impels me to chastise the delinquent with indignation and hatred. An injury done to myself raises my re∣sentment to a higher tone: I am not satisfied with so slight a punishment as indignation and hatred: the author must by my hand suffer mischief, as great as he has made me suffer.</P>
<P>Even the most secret crime escapes not punish∣ment. The delinquent is tortured with remorse: he even desires to be punished; sometimes so ardently, as himself to be the executioner. There cannot be imagined a contrivance more effectual, to deter one from vice; for remorse is itself a grievous punishment. Self-punishment goes still farther: every criminal, sensible that he ought to be punished, dreads punishment from others; and this dread, however smothered during pros∣perity, breaks out in adversity, or in depression of mind: his crime stares him in the face, and every accidental misfortune is in his disturbed imagination interpreted to be a punishment. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us; and we would not hear: therefore is this dis∣tress come upon us.

Arthur of Montau∣ban, in love with the wife of Gilles, brother to the Duke, persuaded the Duke that his brother was laying plots to dethrone him. Gilles being imprisoned, the Duke's best friends conjured him to pity his unhappy brother, who might be imprudent, but assuredly was innocent; but in vain.

No transgression of self-duty escapes punish∣ment, more than transgression of duty to others. The punishments, though not the same, differ in degree more than in kind. Injustice is punished with remorse: impropriety with shame, which is remorse in a lower degree.

<P>So far we have been led in a beaten track; but in attempting to proceed, we are entangled in mazes and intricacies. An action well intended, may happen to produce no good; and an action ill intended, may happen to produce no mischief: a man overawed by fear, may be led to do mis∣chief against his will; and a person, mistaking the standard of right and wrong, may be inno∣cently led to do acts of injustice. By what rule, in such cases, are rewards and punishments to be applied? Ought a man to be rewarded when he does no good, or punished when he does no mis∣chief: ought he to be punished for doing mis∣chief against his will, or for doing mischief when he thinks he is acting innocently? These ques∣tions suggest a doubt, whether the standard of right and wrong be applicable to rewards and punishments.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="44"/>
We have seen that there is an invariable stan∣dard of right and wrong, which depends not in any degree on private opinion or conviction. By that standard, all pecuniary claims are judged, all claims of property, and, in a word, every de∣mand founded on interest, not excepting repara∣tion, as will afterward appear. But with respect to the moral characters of men, and with respect to rewards and punishments, a different standard is erected in the common sense of mankind, nei∣ther rigid nor inflexible; which is, the opinion that men have of their own actions. It is mentioned above, that a man is esteemed innocent in doing what he himself thinks right, and guilty in doing what he himself thinks wrong. In applying this standard to rewards and punishments, we reward those who in doing wrong are however convinced that they are innocent; and punish those who in doing right are however convinced that they are guilty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Virtuous and vicious, innocent and guilty, signify qualities both of men and of their actions. Approba∣tion and disapprobation, praise and blame, signify cer∣tain emotions or sentiments of those who see or con∣template men and their actions.</NOTE>. Some, it is true, are so perverted by bad education, or by superstition, as to espouse numberless absurd tenets, contradictory to the standard of right and wrong; and yet such men are no exception from the general rule: if they act according to conscience, they are innocent, and safe against punishment, however wrong the action may be; and if they act against consci∣ence, they are guilty and punishable, however right the action may be: it is abhorrent to every moral perception, that a guilty person be reward∣ed, or an innocent person punished.

man is compelled by fear, or by torture, to reveal the secrets of his party; he may be grieved for yielding to the weakness of his nature, contrary to his firmest resolves; but he has no check of conscience, and upon that account is not liable to punishment. And, lastly, in order that personal merit and demerit may not in any measure depend on chance, we are so constituted as to place in∣nocence and guilt, not on the event, but on the intention of doing right or wrong; and accord∣ingly, whatever be the event, a man is praised for an action well intended, and condemned for an action ill intended.</P>
<P>But what if a man intending a certain wrong, happen by accident to do a wrong he did not in∣tend; as, for example, intending to rob a warren by shooting the rabbits, he accidentally wounds a child unseen behind a bush? The delinquent ought to be punished for intending to rob; and he is also subjected to repair the hurt done to the child: but he cannot be punished for the acci∣dental wound; because our nature regulates punishment by the intention, and not by the event<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">During the infancy of nations, pecuniary com∣positions for crimes were universal; and during that long period, very little weight was laid upon intenti∣on. This proceeded from the cloudiness and obscurity of moral perceptions among barbarians, joined with the resemblance of pecuniary punishment to reparati∣on. Where a man does mischief intentionally, or is <HI>versans in illicito,</HI> as expressed in the Roman law, he is justly bound to repair all the harm that ensues, how∣ever accidentally; and from the resemblance of pecu∣niary punishment to reparation, the rule was childishly extended to punishment. But this rule, so little con∣sistent with moral principles, could not long subsist after pecuniary compositions gave place to corporal pu∣nishment; and accordingly, among civilized nations, the law of nature is restored, which prohibits punishment for any mischief that is not intentional. The English must be excepted, who, remarkably tenacious of their original laws and customs, preserve in force, even as to capital punishment, the above-mentioned rule that obtained among barbarians, when pecuniary composi∣tions were in vigour. The following passage is from Hales (Pleas of the Crown, chap. 39.) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Regularly he that voluntarily and knowingly intends hurt to the person of a man, as for example to beat him, though he intend not death, yet if death ensues, it excuseth not from the guilt of murder, or man∣slaughter at least, as the circumstances of the case happen."</Q> And Foster, in his Crown-law, teaches the same doctrine, never once suspecting in it the least deviation from moral principles. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A shooteth at the poultry of B, and by accident killeth a man: if his intention was to steal the poultry, which must be collected from circumstances, it will be murder by reason of that felonious intent; but if it was done wantonly, and without that inten∣tion, it will be barely manslaughter."</Q> (p. 259.)</NOTE>.</P>

A crime against any primary virtue is attended with severe and never-failing punishment, more efficacious than any that have been invented to enforce municipal laws: on the other hand, the preserving primary virtues inviolate, is attended with little merit. The secondary virtues are di∣rectly opposite: the neglecting them is not attend∣ed with any punishment; but the practice of them is attended with illustrious rewards. Offices of un∣deserved kindness, returns of good for ill, generous toils and sufferings for our friends or for our coun∣try, are attended with consciousness of self-merit, and with universal praise and admiration; the highest rewards human nature is susceptible of.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="47"/>
From what is said, the following observation will occur: The pain of transgressing justice, fi∣delity, or any duty, is much greater than the plea∣sure of performing; but the pain of neglecting a generous action, or any secondary virtue, is as no∣thing, compared with the pleasure of performing. Among the vices opposite to the primary virtues, the most striking moral deformity is found; among the secondary virtues, the most striking moral beauty.</P>

<HEAD>Laws respecting REPARATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE principle of reparation is made a branch of the moral system for accomplishing two ends: which are, to repress wrongs that are not criminal, and to make up the loss sustained by wrongs of whatever kind. With respect to the former, reparation is a species of punishment: with respect to the latter, it is an act of justice. These ends will be better understood, after ascer∣taining the nature and foundation of reparation; to which the following division of actions is ne∣cessary. First, actions that we are bound to per∣form. Second, actions that we perform in pro∣secution
<PB N="44" REF="48"/>
of a right or privilege. Third, indiffe∣rent actions, described above. Actions of the first kind subject not a man to reparation, whate∣ver damage ensues; because it is his duty to per∣form them, and it would be inconsistent with morality that a man should be subjected to repa∣ration for doing his duty. The laws of reparation that concern actions of the second kind, are more complex. The social state, highly beneficial by affording opportunity for mutual good offices, is attended with some inconveniencies; as where a person happens to be in a situation of necessarily harming others by exercising a right or privilege. If the foresight of harming another, restrain me not from exercising my right, the interest of that other is made subservient to mine: on the other hand, if such foresight restrain me from exerci∣sing my right, my interest is made subservient to his. What doth the moral sense provide in that case? To preserve as far as possible an equality among persons born free, and by nature equal in rank, the moral sense lays down a rule, no less beautiful than salutary; which is, That the exercising a right will not justify me for doing direct mischief; but will justify me, though I foresee that mischief may possibly happen. The first branch of the rule resolves into a pro∣position established above, viz. That no interest of mine, not even life itself, will authorise me to hurt an innocent person. The other branch is supported by expediency: for if the bare possibi∣lity of hurting others were sufficient to restrain a man from prosecuting his rights and privileges, men would be too much cramped in action; or rather would be reduced to a state of absolute inactivity. With respect to the first branch, I am criminal, and liable even to punishment: with
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>
respect to the other, I am not even culpable, nor bound to repair the mischief that happens to ensue.</P>
<P>With respect to the third kind, viz. indifferent actions, the moral sense dictates, that we ought carefully to avoid doing mischief, either direct or consequential. As we suffer no loss by forbearing actions that are done for pastime merely, such an action is <HI>culpable</HI> or <HI>faulty,</HI> if the consequent mischief was foreseen or might have been fore∣seen; and the actor of course is subjected to re∣paration. As this is a cardinal point in the doctrine of reparation, I shall endeavour to ex∣plain it more fully. Without intending any harm, a man may foresee, that what he is about to do will probably or possibly produce mischief; and sometimes mischief follows that was neither in∣tended nor foreseen. The action in the former case is not criminal; because ill intention is es∣sential to a crime: but it is culpable or faulty; and if mischief ensue, the actor blames himself, and is blamed by others, for having done what he ought not to have done. Thus, a man who throws a large stone among a crowd of people, is highly culpable; because he must foresee that mischief will probably ensue, though he has no intention to hurt any person. As to the latter case, though mischief was neither intended nor foreseen, yet if it might have been foreseen, the action is rash or uncautious, and consequently cul∣pable or faulty in some degree. Thus, if a man in pulling down an old house, happen to wound one passing accidentally, without calling aloud to keep out of the way, the action is in some de∣gree culpable, because the mischief might have been foreseen. But though mischief ensue, an action is not culpable or faulty if all reasonable precaution have been adhibited: the moral sense
<PB N="46" REF="50"/>
declares the author to be innocent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Innocent</HI> here is opposed to <HI>culpable▪</HI> in a broader sense it is opposed to <HI>criminal.</HI> With respect to punish∣ment, an action though culpable is innocent, if it be not criminal: with respect to reparation, it is not innocent if it be culpable.</NOTE> and blame∣less: the mischief is accidental, and the action may be termed <HI>unlucky,</HI> but comes not under the denomination of either right or wrong. In ge∣neral, when we act merely for amusement, our nature makes us answerable for the harm that ensues, if it was either foreseen or might with due attention have been foreseen. But our rights and privileges would profit us little, if their ex∣ercise were put under the same restraint: it is more wisely ordered, that the probability of mis∣chief, even foreseen, should not restrain a man from prosecuting his concerns which may often be of consequence to him. He proceeds ac∣cordingly with a safe conscience, and is not afraid of being blamed either by God or man.</P>
<P>With respect to rash or uncautious actions, where the mischief might have been foreseen though not actually foreseen, it is not sufficient to escape blame, that a man, naturally rash or inattentive, acts according to his character: a de∣gree of precaution is required, both by himself and by others, such as is natural to the generality of men: he perceives that he might and <HI>ought</HI> to have acted more cautiously; and his conscience reproaches him for his inattention, no less than if he were naturally more sedate and atten∣tive. Thus the circumspection natural to mankind in general, is applied as a standard to every individual; and if they fall short of that standard, they are culpable and blameable,
<PB N="47" REF="51"/>
however unforeseen by them the mischief may have been.</P>
<P>What is said upon culpable actions is equally applicable to culpable omissions; for by these also mischief may be occasioned, entitling the sufferer to reparation. If we forbear to do our duty with an intention to occasion mischief, the forbearance is criminal. The only question is, how far forbearance without such intention is culpable. Supposing the probability of mischief to have been foreseen, though not intended, the omission is highly culpable; and though neither intended nor foreseen, yet the omission is culpable in a lower degree, if there have been less care and attention than are proper for performing the duty required. But supposing all due care, the omission of extreme care and diligence is not cul∣pable.</P>
<P>By ascertaining what acts and omissions are cul∣pable or faulty, the doctrine of reparation is ren∣dered extremely simple; for it may be laid down as a rule without a single exception, That every culpable act, and every culpable omission, binds us in conscience to repair the mischief occasioned by it. The moral sense binds us no farther; for it loads not with reparation the man who is blame∣less and innocent: the harm is accidental; and we are so constituted as not to be responsible in conscience for what happens by accident. But here it is requisite, that the man be in every respect innocent: for if he intend harm, though not what he has done, he will find himself bound in conscience to repair the accidental harm he has done; as, for example, when aiming a blow un∣justly at one in the dark, he happens to wound an∣other whom he did not suspect to be there. And hence it is a rule in all municipal laws, That one <HI>versans in illicito</HI> is liable to repair every con∣sequent
<PB N="48" REF="52"/>
damage. That these particulars are wisely ordered by the Author of our nature for the good of society, will appear afterwards<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 7.</NOTE>. In ge∣neral, the rules above mentioned are dictated by the moral sense; and we are compelled to obey them by the principle of reparation.</P>
<P>We are now prepared for a more particular in∣spection of the two ends of reparation above mentioned, viz. the repressing wrongs that are not criminal, and the making up what loss is sus∣tained by wrongs of whatever kind. With re∣spect to the first, it is clear, that punishment, in its proper sense, cannot be inflicted for a wrong that is culpable only; and if nature did not pro∣vide some means for repressing such wrongs, so∣ciety would scarce be a comfortable state. Lay∣ing conscience aside, pecuniary reparation is the only remedy that can be provided against culpable omissions: and with respect to culpable commis∣sions, the necessity of reparation is still more ap∣parent; for conscience alone, without the sanc∣tion of reparation, would seldom have authority sufficient to restrain us from acting rashly or un∣cautiously, even where the possibility of mis∣chief is foreseen, and far less where it is not foreseen.</P>
<P>With respect to the second end of reparation, my conscience dictates to me, that if a man suf∣fer by my fault, whether the mischief was fore∣seen or not foreseen, it is my duty to make up his loss; and I perceive intuitively, that the loss ought to rest ultimately upon me, and not upon the sufferer, who has not been culpable in any degree.</P>
<P>In every case where the mischief done can be estimated by a pecuniary compensation, the two
<PB N="49" REF="53"/>
ends of reparation coincide. The sum is taken from the one as a sort of punishment for his fault, and is bestowed on the other to make up the loss he has sustained. But in numberless cases where mischief done cannot be compensated with mo∣ney, reparation is in its nature a sort of punish∣ment. Defamation, contemptuous treatment, per∣sonal restraint, the breaking one's peace of mind, are injuries that cannot be repaired by money; and the pecuniary reparation decreed against the wrong-doer, can only be a sort of punishment, in order to deter him from reiterating such inju∣ries: the sum, it is true, is awarded to the per∣son injured; but not as sufficient to make up his loss, which money cannot do, but only as a <HI>sola∣tium</HI> for what he has suffered.</P>
<P>Hitherto it is supposed, that the man who in∣tends a wrong action, is, at the same time, con∣scious of its being so. But a man may intend a wrong action, thinking erroneously that it is right; or a right action, thinking erroneously that it is wrong; and the question is, What shall be the consequence of such errors with respect to reparation. The latter case is clear: the person who occasionally suffers loss by a right action, has not a claim for reparation, because he has no just cause of complaint. On the other hand, if the action be wrong, the innocence of the author, for which he is indebted to an error in judgment, will not relieve him from reparation. When he is made sensible of his error, he feels himself bound in conscience to repair the harm he has done by a wrong action: and others, sensible of his error from the beginning, have the same feel∣ing: nor will his obstinacy in resisting conviction, or his dullness in not apprehending his error, mend the matter: it is well that these defects re∣lieve him from punishment, without wronging
<PB N="50" REF="54"/>
others by denying a claim for reparation. A man's errors ought to affect himself only, and not those who have not erred. Hence in general, repara∣tion always follows wrong; and is not affected by any erroneous opinion of a wrong action being right, more than of a right action being wrong.</P>
<P>But this doctrine suffers an exception with re∣spect to a man, who having undertaken a trust, is bound in duty to act. A judge is in that situa∣tion: it is his duty to pronounce sentence in eve∣ry case that comes before him; and if he judge according to the best of his knowledge, he is not liable for consequences. A judge cannot be sub∣jected to reparation, unless it can be verified, that the judgment he gave was intentionally wrong. An officer of the revenue is in the same predicament. Led by a doubtful clause in a sta∣tute, he makes a seizure of goods as forfeited to the crown, which afterward, in the proper court, are found not to be seizable. The officer ought not to be subjected to reparation, if he have act∣ed to the best of his judgment. This rule how∣ever must be taken with a limitation: a public officer who is grossly erroneous, will not be ex∣cused; for he ought to know better.</P>
<P>Reparation is due, though the immediate act be involuntary, provided it be connected with a preceding voluntary act. Example: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If A ride an unruly horse in Lincolns-inn fields, to tame him, and the horse breaking from A, run over B and grievously hurt him; B shall have an action against A: for though the mis∣chief was done against the will of A, yet since it was his fault to bring a wild horse into a frequented place, where mischief might ensue, he must answer for the consequences."</Q> Gai∣us seems to carry this rule still farther, holding in general, that if a horse, by the weakness or un∣skilfulness
<PB N="51" REF="55"/>
of the rider, break away and do mis∣chief, the rider is liable<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">l. 8. § 1. ad leg. Aquil.</NOTE>. But Gaius proba∣bly had in his eye a frequented place, where the mischief might have been foreseen. Thus in ge∣neral a man is made liable for the mischief occasi∣oned by his voluntary deed, though the immedi∣ate act that occasioned the mischief be involun∣tary.</P>

<HEAD>FINAL CAUSES of the foregoing Laws of Nature.</HEAD>
<P>SEVERAL final causes have been occasionally mentioned in preceding parts of this essay, which could not conveniently be reserved for the present section, being necessary for explaining the subjects to which they relate, the final cause for instance of erecting a standard of morals up∣on the common sense of mankind. I proceed now to what have not been mentioned, or but slight∣ly mentioned.</P>
<P>The final cause that presents itself first to view, respects man considered as an accountable being. The sense of being accountable, is one
<PB N="52" REF="56"/>
of our most vigilant guards against the silent at∣tacks of vice. When a temptation moves me, it immediately occurs, What will the world say? I imagine my friends expostulating, my enemies reviling—I dare not dissemble—my spirits sink—the temptation vanishes. 2dly, Praise and blame, especially from those we regard, are strong incentives to virtue: but if we were not accountable for our conduct, praise and blame would be seldom well directed; for how should a man's intentions be known, without calling him to account? And praise or blame, frequently ill∣directed, would lose their influence. 3dly, This branch of our nature, is the corner-stone of the criminal law. Did not a man think himself ac∣countable to all the world, and to his judge in a peculiar manner, it would be natural for him to think, that the justest sentence pronounced against him, is oppression, not justice. 4thly, This branch is a strong cement to society. If we were not accountable beings, those connected by blood, or by country, would be no less shy and reserved, than if they were mere strangers to each other.</P>
<P>The final cause that next occurs, being simple and obvious, is mentioned only that it may not seem to have been overlooked. All right actions are agreeable, all wrong actions disagreeable. This is a wise appointment of Providence. We meet with so many temptations against duty, that it is not always an easy task to persevere in the right path: would we persevere, were duty disa∣greeable? And were acts of pure benevolence disagreeable, they would be extremely rare, however worthy of praise.</P>
<P>Another final cause respects duty, in contradis∣tinction to pure benevolence. All the moral laws are founded on intuitive perception; and are so simple and plain, as to be perfectly apprehended
<PB N="53" REF="57"/>
by the most ignorant. Were they in any degree complex or obscure, they would be perverted by selfishness and prejudice. No conviction inferior to what is afforded by intuitive perception, could produce in mankind a common sense with respect to moral duties. Reason would afford no gene∣ral conviction; because that faculty is distributed in portions so unequal, as to bar all hopes from it of uniformity either in practice or in opinion. At the same time, we are taught by woful expe∣rience, that reason has little influence over the greater part of men. Reason, it is true, aided by experience, supports morality, by convincing us, that we cannot be happy if we abandon du∣ty for any other interest. But conviction seldom weighs much against imperious passion; to con∣trol which the vigorous and commanding princi∣ple of duty is requisite, directed by the shining light of intuition.</P>
<P>A proposition laid down above appears to be a sort of mystery in the moral system, viz. That though evidently all moral duties are contrived for promoting the general good, yet that choice is not permitted among different goods, or between good and ill; and that we are strictly tied down to perform or forbear certain particular acts, without regard to consequences; or, in other words, that we must not do wrong, whatever good it may produce. The final cause, which I am about to unfold, will clear this mystery, and set the beauty of the moral system in a conspicu∣ous light. I begin with observing, that as the general good of mankind, or even of the society we live in, results from many and various cir∣cumstances intricately combined, it is far above the capacity of man, to judge in every instance what particular actions will tend the most to that end. The authorising therefore a man to trace
<PB N="54" REF="58"/>
out his duty, by weighing endless circumstances good and ill, would open a wide door to partiali∣ty and passion, and often lead him unwittingly to prefer the preponderating ill, under a false ap∣pearance of being the greater good. At that rate, the opinions of men about right and wrong, would be as various as their faces; which, as observed above, would totally unhinge society. It is better ordered by Providence, even for the general good, that, avoiding complex and ob∣scure objects, we are directed by the moral sense to perform certain plain and simple acts, which are obvious to us by intuitive perception.</P>
<P>In the next place, To permit ill in order to produce greater good, may suit a being of uni∣versal benevolence; but is repugnant to the na∣ture of man, composed of selfish and benevolent principles. We have seen above, that the true moral balance depends on a subordination of self-love to duty, and of arbitrary benevolence to self-love; and accordingly every man is sensible of injustice when he is hurt in order to benefit another. Were it a rule in society, That a grea∣ter good to any other would make it an act of justice to deprive me of my life, of my reputa∣tion, or of my property, I should renounce the society of men, and associate with more harmless animals.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The true moral system, that which is displayed above, is not only better suited to the nature of man, and to his limited capacity and intelligence, but contributes more to the general good, which I now proceed to demonstrate. It would be losing time to prove, that a man entire∣ly selfish is ill fitted for society; and we have seen<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 4.</NOTE>, that universal benevolence, were it a
<PB N="55" REF="59"/>
duty, would contribute to the general good per∣haps less than absolute selfishness. Man is too limited in capacity and in power for universal be∣nevolence. Even the greatest monarch has not power to exercise his benevolence but within a very small compass; and if so, how unfit would such a duty be for private persons, who have ve∣ry little power? Serving only to distress them by inability of performance, they would endeavour to smother it altogether, and give full scope to selfishness. Man is much better qualified for do∣ing good, by a constitution in which benevolence is duly blended with self-love. Benevolence, as a duty, takes place of self-love; a regulation essential to society. Benevolence, as a virtue, not a duty, gives place to self-love; because as every man has more power, knowledge and oppor∣tunity, to promote his own good than that of others, a greater quantity of good is produced, than if benevolence were our only principle of action. This holds, even supposing no harm done to any person: much more would it hold, were we permitted to hurt some, in order to pro∣duce more good to others.</P>
<P>The foregoing final causes respect morality in general. We now proceed to particulars; and the first and most important is the law of re∣straint. Man is evidently framed for society: and as there can be no society among creatures who prey upon each other, it was necessary to provide against mutual injuries; which is effec∣tually done by this law. Its necessity with re∣spect to personal security is self-evident; and with respect to property, its necessity will appear from what follows. In the nature of every man, there is a propensity to hoard or store up things useful to himself and family. But this natural propensity would be rendered ineffectual, were he
<PB N="56" REF="60"/>
not secured in the possession of what he thus stores up; for no man will toil to accumulate what he cannot securely possess. This security is afforded by the moral sense, which dictates, that the first occupant of goods provided by nature for the subsistence of man, ought to be secure in his possession, and that such goods ought to be inviolable as his property. Thus, by the great law of restraint, men have a protection for their goods, as well as for their persons; and are no less secure in society, than if they were separated from each other by impregna∣ble walls.</P>
<P>Several other duties are little less essential than that of restraint to the existence of society. Mutual trust and confidence, without which society would be an uncomfortable state, enter into the cha∣racter of the human species; to which the duties of veracity and fidelity correspond. The final cause of these corresponding duties, is obvious: the latter would be of no use in society without the former; and the former, without the latter, would be hurtful, by laying men open to fraud and deceit.</P>
<P>With respect to veracity in particular, man is so constituted, that he must be indebted to infor∣mation for the knowledge of most things that be∣nefit or hurt him; and if he could not depend upon information, society would be very little beneficial. Further, it is wisely ordered, that we should be bound by the moral sense always to speak truth, even where we perceive no harm in transgressing that duty; because it is sufficient that harm may ensue, though not foreseen. At the same time, falsehood always does mischief: it may happen not to injure us externally in our reputation, or in our goods: but it never fails to injure us internally; for one great blessing of so∣ciety
<PB N="57" REF="61"/>
is, a candid intercourse of sentiments, of opinions, of desires, of wishes; and to admit any falsehood in such intercourse, would poison the most refined pleasures of life.</P>
<P>Because man is the weakest of all animals in a state of separation; and the very strongest in so∣ciety, by mutual aid and support to which cove∣nants and promises greatly contribute, these are made binding by the moral sense.</P>
<P>The final cause of the law of propriety, which enforces the duty we owe to ourselves, comes next in order. In discoursing upon those laws of na∣ture which concern society, there is no occasion to mention any self-duty but what relates to so∣ciety; of which kind are prudence, temperance, industry, firmness of mind. And that such qua∣lities should be made our duty, is wisely ordered in a double respect; first, as qualifying us to act a proper part in society, and next, as intitling us to good-will from others. It is the interest, no doubt, of every man, to suit his behaviour to the dignity of his nature, and to the station allot∣ted him by Providence; for such rational conduct contributes to happiness, by preserving health, procuring plenty, gaining the esteem of others, and, which of all is the greatest blessing, by gain∣ing a justly-founded self-esteem. But here inte∣rest solely is not relied on: the powerful autho∣rity of duty is added, that in a matter of the ut∣most importance to ourselves, and of some im∣portance to the society we live in, our conduct may be regular and steady. These duties tend not only to render a man happy in himself, but also, by procuring the good-will and esteem of others, to command their aid and assistance in time of need.</P>
<P>I proceed to the final causes of natural rewards and punishments. It is laid down above, that
<PB N="58" REF="62"/>
controversies about property and about other mat∣ters of interest, must be adjusted by the standard of right and wrong. But to bring rewards and punishments under the same standard, with∣out regard to private conscience, would be a plan unworthy of our Maker. It is extremely clear, that to reward one who is not conscious of merit, or to punish one who is not conscious of guilt, cannot answer any good end; and in particular, can∣not tend either to improvement or to reformation of manners. How much more like the Deity is the plan of nature, which rewards no man who is not conscious that he merits reward, and punishes no man who is not conscious that he merits pun∣ishment! By that plan, and by that only, re∣wards and punishments accomplish every good end; a final cause most illustrious! The rewards and punishments that attend the primary and se∣condary virtues, are finely contrived for support∣ing the distinction between them, set forth above. Punishment must be confined to the transgression of primary virtues, it being the intention of na∣ture, that secondary virtues be entirely free. On the other hand, secondary virtues are more high∣ly rewarded than primary: generosity, for exam∣ple, makes a greater figure than justice; and magnanimity, heroism, undaunted courage, a still greater figure. One would imagine, at first view, that primary virtues, being more essential, should be intitled to the first place in our esteem, and be more amply rewarded than secondary; and yet in elevating the latter above the former, pe∣culiar wisdom and foresight are conspicuous. Pu∣nishment is appropriated to enforce primary vir∣tues; and if these virtues were also attended with high rewards, secondary virtues, degraded to a lower rank, would be deprived of that enthu∣siastic
<PB N="59" REF="63"/>
admiration which is their chief support: self-interest would universally prevail over bene∣volence, and banish those numberless favours we receive from each other in society, which are beneficial in point of interest, and still more so by generating affection and friendship.</P>
<P>In our progress through final causes we come at last to reparation, one of the principles destin∣ed by Providence for redressing wrongs commit∣ted, and for preventing the reiteration of them. The final cause of this principle, when the mischief arises from intention, is clear: for to protect individuals in society, it is not suf∣ficient that the delinquent be punished; it is necessary over and above, that the mischief be re∣paired.</P>
<P>Secondly, Where the act is wrong or unjust, though not understood by the author to be so, it is wisely ordered that reparation should follow; which will thus appear. Considering the fallibi∣lity of man, it would be too severe to permit ad∣vantage to be taken of one's error in every cir∣cumstance. On the other hand, to make it a law in our nature, never to take advantage of er∣ror, would be giving too much indulgence to in∣dolence and remission of mind, tending to make us neglect the improvement of our rational fa∣culties. Our nature is so happily framed, as to avoid these extremes by distinguishing between gain and loss. No man is conscious of wrong, when he takes advantage of an error committed by another to save himself from loss: if there must be a loss, common sense dictates, that it ought to rest upon the person who has erred, however innocently, rather than upon the person who has not erred. Thus, in a competition among creditors about the estate of their bankrupt
<PB N="60" REF="64"/>
debtor, every one is at liberty to avail himself of every error committed by his competitor, in order to recover payment. But <HI>in lucro captando,</HI> the moral sense teacheth a different lesson; which is, that no man ought to lay hold of another's error to make gain by it. Thus, an heir finding a rough diamond in the repositories of his ancestor, gives it away, mistaking it for a common pebble: the purchaser is in conscience and equity bound to restore, or to pay a just price.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The following considerations unfold a final cause, no less beautiful than that last men∣tioned. Society could not subsist in any tolerable manner, were full scope given to rashness and ne∣gligence, and to every action that is not strictly criminal; whence it is a maxim founded no less upon utility than upon justice, That men in so∣ciety ought to be extremely circumspect, as to every action that may possibly do harm. On the other hand, it is also a maxim, That as the pros∣perity and happiness of man depend on action, activity ought to be encouraged, instead of be∣ing discouraged by dread of consequences. These maxims, seemingly in opposition, have natural limits that prevent their encroaching upon each other. There is a certain degree of attention and circumspection that men generally bestow upon affairs, proportioned to their importance: if that degree were not sufficient to defend against a claim of reparation, individuals would be too much cramped in action; which would be a great discouragement to activity: if a less degree were sufficient, there would be too great scope for rash or remiss conduct; which would prove the bane of society. These limits, which evidently tend to the good of society, are adjusted by the moral sense; which dictates, as laid down in the section of Reparation, that the man who acts with fore∣sight
<PB N="61" REF="65"/>
of the probability of mischief, or acts rashly and uncautiously without such foresight, ought to be liable for consequences; but that the man who acts cautiously, without foreseeing or sus∣pecting any mischief, ought not to be liable for consequences.</P>
<P>In the same section it is laid down, that the moral sense requires from every man, not his own degree of vigilance and attention, which may be very small, but that which belongs to the com∣mon nature of the species. The final cause of that regulation will appear upon considering, that were reparation to depend upon personal circum∣stances, there would be a necessity of enquiring into the characters of men, their education, their manner of living, and the extent of their under∣standing; which would render judges arbitrary, and such law-suits inextricable. But by as∣suming the common nature of the species as a standard, by which every man in consci∣ence judges of his own actions, law-suits about reparation are rendered easy and expediti∣ous.</P>

<HEAD>LIBERTY and NECESSITY considered with re∣spect to Morality.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING, in the foregoing sections, ascer∣tained the reality of a moral sense, with its sentiments of approbation and disapprobation,
<PB N="62" REF="66"/>
praise and blame; the purpose of the present sec∣tion is, to shew, that these sentiments are con∣sistent with the laws that govern the actions of man as a rational being. In order to which it is first necessary to explain these laws; for there has been much controversy about them, especially among divines of the Arminian and Calvinist sects.</P>
<P>Human actions, as laid down in the first sec∣tion, are of three kinds: one, where we act by instinct, without any view to consequences; one, where we act by will in order to produce some effect; and one, where we act against will. With respect to the first, the agent acts blindly, without deliberation or choice; and the external act follows necessarily from the instinctive im∣pluse<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A stonechatter makes its nest on the ground or near it; and the young, as soon as they can shift for themselves, leave the nest instinctivly. An egg of that bird was laid in a swallow's nest, fixed to the roof of a church. The swallow fed all the young equally with∣out distinction. The young stonechatter left the nest at the usual time before it could fly; and falling to the ground, it was taken up dead. Here is instinct in pu∣rity, exerting itself blindly without regard to variation of circumstances. The same is observable in our dunghill-fowl. They feed on worms, corn, and other feeds dropt on the ground. In order to discover their food, nature has provided them with an instinct to scrape with the foot; and the instinct is so regularly exercised, that they scrape even when they are set upon a heap of corn.</NOTE>. Actions done with a view to an end, are in a very different condition: in these, deliberati∣on, choice, will, enter: the intention to accom∣plish the end goes first; the will to act in order to accomplish the end is next; and the external
<PB N="63" REF="67"/>
act follows of course. It is the will then that governs every action done as means to an end; and it is desire to accomplish the end that puts the will in motion; desire in this view being com∣monly termed the <HI>motive</HI> to act. Thus, hearing that my friend is in the hands of robbers, I burn with desire to free him: desire influen∣ces my will to arm my servants, and to fly to his relief. Actions done against will come in afterward.</P>
<P>But what is it that raises desire? The answer is at hand: it is the prospect of attaining some agree∣able end, or of avoiding one that is disagreeable. And if it be again enquired, What makes an object agreeable or disagreeable, the answer is equally ready, that our nature makes it so; and more we cannot say. Certain visible objects are agreeable, certain sounds, and certain smells: other objects of these senses are disagreeable. But there we must stop; for we are far from being so intimately acquainted with our own na∣ture as to assign the causes. These hints are suf∣ficient for my present purpose: if one be curious to know more, the theory of desire, and of agree∣ableness and disagreeableness, will be found in Ele∣ments of Criticism<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With respect to instinctive actions, no person, I presume, thinks that there is any freedom, more than in acts done against will: an infant applies to the nipple, and a bird builds its nest, no less necessarily than a stone falls to the ground. With respect to voluntary actions, such as are done with a view to an end, the necessity is the same, though less apparent at first view. The external
<PB N="64" REF="68"/>
action is determined by the will: the will is de∣termined by desire: and desire by what is agreea∣ble or disagreeable. Here is a chain of causes and effects, not one link of which is arbitrary, or under command of the agent: he cannot will but according to his desire: he cannot desire but ac∣cording to what is agreeable or disagreeable in the objects perceived: nor do these qualities depend on his inclination or fancy; he has no power to make a beautiful woman ugly, nor to make a rotten carcase sweet.</P>
<P>Many good men apprehending danger to mora∣lity from holding our actions to be necessary, en∣deavour to break the chain of causes and effects above mentioned, maintaining, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That whatever influence desire or motives may have, it is the agent himself who is the cause of every acti∣on; that desire may advise, but cannot com∣mand; and therefore that a man is still free to act in contradiction to desire and to the strong∣est motives."</Q> That a being may exist, which in every case acts blindly and arbitrarily, without having any end in view, I can make a shift to conceive: but it is difficult for me even to imagine a thinking and rational being, that has affections and passions, that has a desireable end in view, that can easily accomplish this end; and yet, after all, can fly off, or remain at rest, without any cause, reason, or motive, to sway it. If such a whimsical being can possibly exist, I am certain that man is not such a being. There is perhaps not a person above the condition of a changeling, but can say why he did so and so, what moved him, what he intended. Nor is a single fact stated to make us believe, that ever a man acted against his own will or desire, who was not compelled by external violence. On the con∣trary, constant and universal experience proves,
<PB N="65" REF="69"/>
that human actions are governed by certain in∣flexible laws; and that a man cannot exert his self-motive power, but in pursuance of some de∣sire or motive.</P>
<P>Had a motive always the same influence, acti∣ons proceeding from it would appear no less ne∣cessary than the actions of matter. The various degrees of influence that motives have on dif∣ferent men at the same time, and on the same man at different times, occasion a doubt by suggesting a notion of chance. Some motives however have such influence, as to leave no doubt: a timid female has a physical power to throw herself into the mouth of a lion, roaring for food; but she is with-held by terror no less effectually than by cords: if she should rush upon the lion, would not every one conclude that she was frantic? A man, though in a deep sleep, retains a physical power to act, but he cannot exert it. A man, though desperately in love, retains a physical power to refuse the hand of his mistress; but he cannot exert that power in contradiction to his own ardent desire, more than if he were fast asleep. Now if a strong motive have a necessary influence, there is no reason for doubting, but that a weak motive must also have its influence, the same in kind, though not in degree. Some actions indeed are strangely irregular; but let the wildest action be scrutinized, there will always be discovered some motive or desire, which, however whimsical or capricious, was what influenced the person to act. Of two con∣tending motives is it not natural to expect, that the stronger will prevail, however little its excess may be? If there be any doubt, it must be from a supposition that a weak motive can be resisted arbitrarily. Where then are we to fix the boun∣dary between a weak and a strong motive? If a
<PB N="66" REF="70"/>
weak motive can be resisted, why not one a lit∣tle stronger, and why not the strongest? In Ele∣ments of Criticism<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. part 4.</NOTE> the reader will find many examples of contrary motives weighing against each other. Let him ponder these with the strictest attention: his conclusion will be, that between two motives, however nearly balanced, a man has not an arbitrary choice, but must yield to the stronger. The mind indeed fluctuates for some time, and feels itself in a measure loose: at last, however, it is determined by the more pow∣erful motive, as a balance is by the greater weight after many vibrations.</P>
<P>Such then are the laws that govern our volun∣tary actions. A man is absolutely free to act oc∣cording to his own will; greater freedom than which is not conceivable. At the same time, as man is made accountable for his conduct, to his Maker, to his fellow-creatures, and to himself, he is not left to act arbitrarily; for at that rate he would be altogether unaccountable: his will is regulated by desire; and desire by what plea∣ses or displeases him. Where we are subjected to the will of another, would it be our wish, that his will should be under no regulation? And where we are guided by our own will, would it be reasonable to wish, that it should be under no regulation, but be exerted without reason, with∣out any motive, and contrary to common sense? Thus, with regard to human conduct, there is a chain of laws established by nature, not one link of which is left arbitrary. By that wise system, man is rendered accountable: by it, he is made a fit subject for divine and human government: by it, persons of sagacity foresee the conduct of
<PB N="67" REF="71"/>
others: and by it, the prescience of the Deity with respect to human actions, is firmly esta∣blished.</P>
<P>The absurd figure men would make if they could act contrary to motives, should be suffici∣ent, one may think, to open our eyes without an argument. What a despicable figure does a per∣son make, upon whom the same motive has great influence at one time, and very little at another? He is a bad member of society, and cannot be relied on as a friend or as an associate. But how highly rational is this supposed person, compared with one who can act in contradiction to every motive? The former may be termed whimsical or capricious: the latter is worse; he is abso∣lutely unaccountable, and cannot be the subject of government, more than a lump of matter un∣conscious of its own motion.</P>
<P>Let the faculty of acting be compared with that of reasoning: the comparison will tend to soften our reluctance to the necessary influence of motives. A man sometimes blunders in reaso∣ning; but he is tied by his nature, to form con∣clusions upon what appears to him true at the time. If he could arbitrarily form a different conclusion, what an absurd reasoner would he be! Would a man be less absurd, if he had a power of acting against motives, and contrary to what he thinks right or eligible? To act in that man∣ner, is inconsistent with any notion we can form of a sensible being. Nor do we suppose that man is such a being: in accounting for any acti∣on, however whimsical, we always ascribe it to some motive, never once dreaming that there was no motive.</P>
<P>And after all, where would be the advantage of such an arbitrary power? Can a rational man wish seriously to have such a power? or can he
<PB N="68" REF="72"/>
seriously think, that God would make man so whimsical a being? To endue man with a de∣gree of self-command sufficient to resist every vicious motive, without any power to resist those that are virtuous, would indeed be a gift of va∣lue; but too great for man, because it would ex∣alt him to be an angel. But such self-command as to resist both equally, which is the present supposition, would unqualify us for being go∣verned either by God or by man. Better far to be led as rational creatures by the prospect of good, however erroneous our judgment may sometimes be.</P>
<P>Considering that man is the only terrestrial be∣ing formed to know his Maker, and to worship him, will it not sound harshly, while all other animals are subjected to divine government, and unerringly fulfil their destination, that man alone should be withdrawn from divine government, and be so framed, that neither his Maker, nor he himself, can foresee what he will do the next moment? The power of resisting the strongest motives, whether of religion or of morality, would render him independent of the Deity.</P>
<P>This reasoning is too diffuse: may it not be comprehended in a single view? it will make the deeper impression. There may be conceived different systems for governing man as a thinking and rational being. One is, That virtuous mo∣tives should always prevail over every other mo∣tive. This, in appearance, would be the most perfect government. But man is not so constitu∣ted: and there is reason to doubt, whether such perfection would in his present state correspond to the other branches of his nature<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See book 2. sketch 1. at the end.</NOTE>. Ano∣ther
<PB N="69" REF="73"/>
system is, That virtuous motives sometimes prevail, sometimes vicious; and that we are al∣ways determined by the prevailing motive. This is the true system of nature; and hence great va∣riety of character and of conduct among men. A third system is, That motives have influence; but that one can act in contradiction to every motive. This is the system I have been combat∣ing. Observe only what it resolves into. How is an action to be accounted for that is done in contradiction to every motive? It wanders from the region of common sense into that of mere chance. If such were the nature of man, no one could rely on another: a promise or an oath would be a rope of sand: the utmost cordiality between my friend and me, would be no security against his stabbing me with the first weapon that comes in his way. Would any man wish to have been formed according to such a system? He would probably wish to have been formed according to the system first mentioned: but that is denied him, virtuous motives sometimes pre∣vailing, sometimes vicious; and from the wis∣dom of Providence we have reason to believe, that this law is of all the best fitted for man in his present state.</P>
<P>To conclude this branch of the subject: In none of the works of Providence, so far as we can penetrate, is there displayed a deeper reach of art and wisdom, than in the laws of action peculiar to man as a thinking and rational being. Were he left loose, to act in contradiction to motives, there would be no place for prudence, foresight, nor for adjusting means to an end: it could not be foreseen by others what a man will do the next hour; nay it could not be foreseen, even by himself. Man would not be capable of rewards and punishments: he would not be fit∣ted,
<PB N="70" REF="74"/>
either for divine or for human government: he would be a creature that has no resemblance to the human race. But man is not left loose; for though he is at liberty to act according to his own will, yet his will is regulated by desire, and desire by what pleases and displeases. This con∣nection preserves uniformity of conduct, and confines human actions within the great chain of causes and effects. By this admirable system, liberty and necessity, seemingly incompatible, are made perfectly concordant, fitting us for society, and for government both human and divine.</P>
<P>Having explained the laws that govern human actions, we proceed to what is chiefly intended in the present section, which is, to examine, how far the moral sentiments handled in the foregoing sections are consistent with these laws. Let it be kept in view, that our moral sentiments and feel∣ings are founded entirely upon the moral sense; which unfolds to us a right and a wrong in acti∣ons. From the same sense are derived the sen∣timents of approbation and praise when a man does right, and of disapprobation and blame when he does wrong. Were we destitute of the moral sense, right and wrong, praise and blame, would be as little understood as colours are by one born blind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In an intricate subject like the present, great care should be taken to avoid ambiguities. The term <HI>praise</HI> has two different significations: in one sense it is op∣posed to <HI>blame;</HI> in another to <HI>dispraise.</HI> In the for∣mer sense it expresses a moral sentiment: in the latter, it expresses only the approving any object that pleases me. I praise one man for his candour, and blame another for being a double-dealer. These, both of them, imply will and intention. I praise a man for being acute; but for being dull, I only dispraise him. I praise a woman for beauty; but blame not any for ugliness, I only dispraise them. None of these parti∣culars imply will or intention.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="75"/>
The formidable argument that is urged, to prove that our moral sentiments are inconsistent with the supposed necessary influence of motives, is what follows. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If motives have a necessary influence on our actions, there can be no good reason to praise a man for doing right, nor to blame him for doing wrong. What foundati∣on can there be, either for praise or blame, when it was not in a man's power to have acted otherwise? A man commits murder in∣stigated by a sudden fit of revenge: why should he be punished, if he acted necessari∣ly, and could not resist the violence of the passion?"</Q> Here it is supposed, that a power of resistance is essential to praise and blame. But upon examination it will be found, that this supposition has not any support in the moral sense, nor in reason, nor in the common sense of man∣kind.</P>
<P>With respect to the first, the moral sense, as we have seen above, places innocence and guilt, and consequentty praise and blame, entirely upon will and intention. The connection between the motive and the action, so far from diminishing, enhances the praise or blame. The greater in∣fluence a virtuous motive has, the greater is the virtue of the agent, and the more warm our praise. On the other hand, the greater influ∣ence a vicious motive has, the greater is the vice of the agent, and the more violently do we blame him. As this is the cardinal point, I wish to have it considered in a general view. It is essen∣tial
<PB N="72" REF="76"/>
both to human and divine government, that the influence of motives should be necessary. It is equally essential, that that necessary influence should not have the effect to lessen guilt in the estimation of men. To fulfil both ends, guilt is placed by the moral sense entirely upon will and intention: a man accordingly blames himself for doing mischief willingly and intentionally, with∣out once considering whether he acted necessarily or not. And his sentiments are adopted by all the world: they pronounce the same sentence of condemnation that he himself does. A man put to the torture, yields to the pain, and with bit∣ter reluctance reveals the secrets of his party: another does the same, yielding to a tempting bribe. The latter only is blamed as guilty of a crime; and yet the bribe perhaps operated as strongly on the latter, as torture did on the for∣mer. But the one was compelled against his will to reveal the secrets of his party; and therefore is innocent: the other acted willingly, in order to procure a great sum of money; and therefore is guilty.</P>
<P>With respect to reason, I observe, that the argument I am combating is an appeal to a wrong tribunal: the moral sense is the only judge in this controversy, not the faculty of reason. At the same time, I should have no fear of a sen∣tence against me, were reason to be the judge. For would not reason dictate, that the less a man wavers about his duty; or, in other words, the less influence vicious motives have, the more praise-worthy he is; and the more blameable, the less influence virtuous motives have?</P>
<P>Nor are we led by common sense to differ from reason and the moral sense. A man commits murder, overcome by a sudden fit of revenge which he could not resist; will not one be led to
<PB N="73" REF="77"/>
reflect, even at first view, that the man did not wish to resist? on the contrary, that he would have committed the murder, though he had not been under any necessity? A person of plain un∣derstanding will say, What signifies it whether the criminal could resist or not, when he commit∣ted the murder wittingly and willingly? A man gives poison privately out of revenge. Does any one doubt of his guilt, when he never once re∣pented; though after administering the poison it no longer was in his power to draw back? A man may be guilty and blame-worthy, even where there is external compulsion that he cannot resist. With sword in hand I run to attack an enemy: my foot slipping, I fall headlong upon him, and by that accident the sword is pushed into his body. The external act was not the effect of Will, but of accident: but my intention was to commit murder, and I am guilty. All men acknowledge, that the Deity is necessarily good. Does that cir∣cumstance detract from his praise in com∣mon apprehension? On the contrary, he me∣rits from us the highest praise on that very ac∣count.</P>
<P>It is commonly said, that there can be no virtue where there is no struggle. Virtue, it is true, is best known from a struggle: a man who has ne∣ver met with a temptation, can be little confident of his virtue. But the observation taken in a strict sense, is undoubtedly erroneous. A man, tempted to betray his trust, wavers; but, after much doubting, refuses at last the bribe. Ano∣ther hesitates not a moment, but rejects the bribe with disdain: duty is obstinate, and will not suf∣fer him even to deliberate. Is there no virtue in the latter? Undoubtedly more than in the for∣mer.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="78"/>
Upon the whole, it appears that praise and blame rest ultimately upon the disposition or frame of mind. Nor is it obvious, that a power to act against motives, could vary in any degree these moral sentiments. When a man commits a crime, let it be supposed, that he could have resisted the prevailing motive. Why then did he not resist, instead of bringing upon himself shame and misery? The answer must be, for no other can be given, that his disposition is vicious, and that he is a detestable creature. Further, it is not a little difficult to conceive, how a man can resist a prevailing motive, without having any thing in his mind that should engage him to resist it. But letting that pass, I make the following supposition. A man is tempted by avarice to accept a bribe: if he resist upon the principle of duty, he is led by the prevailing motive: if he resist without having any reason or motive for resisting, I can∣not discover any merit in such resistance: it seems to resolve into a matter of chance or acci∣dent, whether he resist or do not resist. Where can the merit lie of resisting a vicious motive, when resistance happens by mere chance? and where the demerit of resisting a virtuous motive, when it is owing to the same chance? If a man, actuated by no principle, good or bad, and having no end or purpose in view, should kill his neighbour, I see not that he would be more accountable, than if he had acted in his sleep, or were mad.</P>
<P>Human punishments are perfectly consistent with the necessary influence of motives, without supposing a power to withstand them. If it be urged, That a man ought not to be punished for committing a crime when he could not resist; the answer is, That as he committed the crime inten∣tionally, and with his eyes open, he is guilty in
<PB N="75" REF="79"/>
his own opinion, and in the opinion of all men; and he justly suffers punishment, to prevent him or others from doing the like in time to come. The dread of punishment is a weight in the scale on the side of virtue, to counterbalance vicious motives.</P>
<P>The final cause of this branch of our nature is admirable. If the necessary influence of motives had the effect either to lessen the merit of a virtu∣ous action, or the demerit of a crime, morality would be totally unhinged. The most virtuous action would of all be the least worthy of praise; and the most vicious be of all the least worthy of blame. Nor would the evil stop there: instead of curbing inordinate passions, we should be encouraged to indulge them, as an excellent excuse for doing wrong. Thus, the moral sen∣timents of approbation and disapprobation, of praise and blame, are found perfectly consistent with the laws above mentioned that govern hu∣man actions, without having recourse to an ima∣ginary power of acting against motives.</P>
<P>The only plausible objection I have met with against the foregoing theory, is the remorse a man feels for a crime he suddenly commits, and as suddenly repents of. During a fit of bitter re∣morse for having slain my favourite servant in a violent passion, without just provocation, I ac∣cuse myself for having given way to passion; and acknowledge that I could and ought to have re∣strained it. Here we find remorse founded on a system directly opposite to that above laid down; a system that acknowledges no necessary connecti∣on between an action and the motive that produ∣ced it; but, on the contrary, supposes that it is in a man's power to resist his passion, and that he ought to resist it. What shall be said upon this point? Can a man be a necessary agent, when he
<PB N="76" REF="80"/>
is conscious of the contrary, and is sensible that he can act in contradiction to motives? This ob∣jection is strong in appearance; and would be in∣vincible, were we not happily relieved of it by a doctrine laid down in Elements of Criticism<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. part 5.</NOTE> concerning the irregular influence of passion on our opinions and sentiments. Upon examination, it will be found, that the present case may be ad∣ded to the many examples there given of this ir∣regular influence. In a peevish fit, I take excep∣tion at some slight word or gesture of my friend, which I interpret as if he doubted of my veracity. I am instantly in a flame: in vain he protests that he had no meaning, for impatience will not suffer me to listen. I bid him draw, which he does with reluctance; and before he is well prepared, I give him a mortal wound. Bitter remorse and anguish succeed instantly to rage. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What have I done? why did I not abstain? I was not mad, and yet I have murdered my innocent friend: there is the hand that did the horrid deed; why did not I rather turn it against my own heart?"</Q> Here every impression of necessity vanishes: my mind tells me that I was absolutely free, and that I ought to have smothered my pas∣sion. I put an opposite case. A brutal fellow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>eats me with great indignity, and proceeds even to a blow. My passion rises beyond the possibili∣ty of restraint: I can scarce forbear so long as to bid him draw; and that moment I stab him to the heart. I am sorry for having been engaged with a ruffian, but have no contrition nor re∣morse. In this case, my sentiments are very dif∣ferent from what they are in the other. I never
<PB N="77" REF="81"/>
once dream that I could have resisted the impulse of passion: on the contrary, my thoughts and words are, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That flesh and blood could not bear the affront; and that I must have been branded for a coward, had I not done what I did."</Q> In reality, both the actions were equal∣ly necessary. Whence then opinions and sen∣timents so opposite to each other? The irregular influence of passion on our opinions and senti∣ments, will solve the question. All violent pas∣sions are prone to their own gratification. A man affected with deep remorse abhors himself, and is odious in his own eyes; and it gratifies the pas∣sion, to indulge the thought that his guilt is be∣yond the possibility of excuse. In the first case accordingly, remorse forces upon me a conviction that I might have restrained my passion, and ought to have restrained it. I will not give way to any excuse; because in a fit of remorse it gives me pain to be excused. In the other case, there be∣ing no remorse, there is no disguise; and things appear in their true light. To illustrate this rea∣soning, I observe, that passion warps my judg∣ment of the actions of others, as well as of my own. Many examples are given in the chapter above quoted: join to these the following. My servant aiming at a partridge, happens to shoot a favourite spaniel crossing the way unseen. In∣flamed with anger, I storm at his rashness, pro∣nounce him guilty, and will listen to no excuse. When my passion is spent, I become sensible that it was merely accidental, and that the man is ab∣solutely innocent. The nurse overlays my only child, the long-expected heir to a great estate. It is with difficulty that I refrain from putting her to death: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The wretch has murdered my in∣fant, and deserves to be torn to pieces."</Q>
<PB N="78" REF="82"/>
When my passion subsides, I see the matter in a very different light. The poor woman is incon∣solable, and can scarce believe that she is inno∣cent: she bitterly reproaches herself for want of care and concern. But, upon cool reflection, both she and I are sensible, that no person in sound sleep has any self-command; and that we cannot be answerable for any action of which we are not conscious. Thus, upon the whole, we find, that any impression we may occasionally have of being able to act in contradiction to motives, is the result of passion, not of sound judg∣ment.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Upon CHANCE and CONTINGENCY,</HEAD>
<P>I HOLD it to be an intuitive proposition, That the Deity is the primary cause of all things; that with consummate wisdom he formed the great plan of government, which he carries on by laws suited to the different natures of animate and inanimate beings; and that these laws, pro∣duce a regular chain of causes and effects in the moral as well as the material world, admitting no events but what are comprehended in the original plan<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Essays on Morality and Natural Religion, part 1. essay 3.</NOTE>. Hence it clearly follows, that chance is excluded out of this world, that nothing can happen by accident, and that no event is arbitrary or contingent. This is the doctrine of the essay quoted; and, in my apprehension, well founded. But I cannot subscribe to what follows, viz. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That we have an impression of chance and con∣tingency, which consequently must be delu∣sive."</Q> I would not willingly admit any delusi∣on in the nature of man, where it is not made
<PB N="80" REF="84"/>
evident beyond contradiction; and I now see clearly, that the impression we have of chance and contingency, is not delusive, but perfectly consistent with the established plan.</P>
<P>The explanation of chance and contingency in the said essay, shall be given in the author's own words, as a proper text to reason upon. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In our ordinary train of thinking, it is certain that all events appear not to us as necessary. A multitude of events seem to be under our power to cause or to prevent; and we readily make a distinction betwixt events that are <HI>necessary, i. e.</HI> that must be; and events that are <HI>contingent, i. e.</HI> that may be, or may not be. This distinction is void of truth: for all things that fall out either in the material or moral world, are, as we have seen, alike ne∣cessary, and alike the result of fixed laws. Yet, whatever conviction a philosopher may have of this, the distinction betwixt things necessary and things contingent, possesses his common train of thought, as much as it pos∣sesses the most illiterate. We act universally upon that distinction: nay it is in truth the cause of all the labour, care, and industry, of mankind. I illustrate this doctrine by an example. Constant experience hath taught us, that death is a necessary event. The hu∣man frame is not made to last for ever in its present condition; and no man thinks of more than a temporary existence upon this globe. But the particular time of our death appears a contingent event. However certain it be, that the time and manner of the death of each individual is determined by a train of preced∣ing causes, and is no less fixed than the hour of the sun's rising or setting; yet no per∣son is affected by this doctrine.

of prolonging life, we are directed by the sup∣posed contingency of the time of death, which, to a certain term of years, we consider as de∣pending in a great measure on ourselves, by caution against accidents, due use of food, exercise, &amp;c. These means are prosecuted with the same diligence as if there were in fact no necessary train of causes to fix the pe∣riod of life. In short, whoever attends to his own practical ideas, whoever reflects upon the meaning of the following words which occur in all languages, of things <HI>possible, contingent, that are in our power to cause or prevent;</HI> whoever, I say, reflects upon these words, will clearly see, that they suggest certain per∣ceptions or notions repugnant to the doctrine above established of universal necessity."</Q></P>
<P>In order to show that there is no repugnance, I begin with defining <HI>chance</HI> and <HI>contingency.</HI> The former is applied to events that have hap∣pened; the latter to future events. When we say a thing has happened by <HI>chance,</HI> we do not mean that <HI>chance</HI> was the cause; for no person ever thought that <HI>chance</HI> is a thing that can act, and by acting produce events: we only mean, that we are ignorant of the cause, and that, for aught we see, it might have happened or not happened, or have happened differently. Aim∣ing at a bird, I shoot <HI>by chance</HI> a favourite spa∣niel: the meaning is not, that chance killed the dog, but that as to me the dog's death was acci∣dental. With respect to contingency, future events that are variable, and the cause unknown, are said to be contingent; changes of the wea∣ther, for example, whether it will be frost or thaw to-morrow, whether fair or foul. In a word, chance and contingency applied to events mean not that such events happen without any
<PB N="82" REF="86"/>
cause, but only that we are ignorant of the cause.</P>
<P>It appears to me clear, that there is no such thing in human nature as a sense of <HI>contingency;</HI> or, in other words, a sense that any thing hap∣pens without a cause: such a sense would be grossly delusive. True it is indeed, that our sense of a cause is but cloudy and indistinct with respect to certain events. Events that happen re∣gularly, such as summer and winter, rising and setting of the sun, give us a distinct impression of a cause. The impression is less distinct with respect to events less regular, such as alterations of the weather: and extremely indistinct with respect to events that seldom happen, and that happen without any known cause. But with re∣spect to no event whatever does our sense of a cause vanish altogether, and give place to a po∣sitive sense of contingency, that is, a sense of things happening without a cause.</P>
<P>Chance and contingency thus explained, sug∣gest not any perception or notion repugnant to the doctrine of universal necessity; for my igno∣rance of a cause, does not, even in my own ap∣prehension, exclude a cause. Descending to par∣ticulars, I take the example mentioned in the text, viz. the uncertainty of the time of my death. Knowing that my life depends in some measure on myself, I use all means to preserve it, by proper food, exercise, and care to prevent accidents. Nor is there any delusion here. I am moved to use these means by the desire I have to live: these means accordingly prove effectual to carry on my present existence to the oppointed period; and in that view are so many links in the great chain of causes and effects. A burning coal fall∣ing from the grate upon the floor, wakes me from a sound sleep. I start up to extinguish the fire.
<PB N="83" REF="87"/>
The motive is irresistible: nor have I reason to resist, were it in my power; for I consider the extinction of the fire by my hand to be one of the means chosen by Providence for prolonging my life to its destined period.</P>
<P>Were there a chain of causes and effects esta∣blished entirely independent on me, and were my life in no measure under my own power, it would indeed be fruitless for me to act; and the absur∣dity of knowingly acting in vain, would be a prevailing motive for remaining at rest. Upon that supposition, the <HI>ignavia ratio</HI> of Chrysippus might take place; <HI>cui si pareamus, nihil omnino agamus in vita</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The indolent principle; which if we were to follow, we should do nothing in life."</Q></NOTE>. But I act necessarily when in∣fluenced by motives; and I have no reason to forbear, considering that my actions, by produ∣cing their intended effects, contribute to carry on the universal chain.</P>

<HEAD>PROGRESS of MORALITY.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING unfolded the principles of morali∣ty, the next step is to trace out its gradu∣al progress from its infancy among savages, to its maturity among polished nations. The histo∣ry of opinions concerning the foundation of mo∣rality, falls not within my plan; and I am glad to be relieved from an article that is executed in perfection by more able hands<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dr Cudworth and Dr Smith.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>An animal is brought forth with every one of its external members; and completes its growth, not by production of any new member, but by addition of matter to those originally formed. The same holds with respect to internal members; the senses, for example, instincts, powers and faculties, principles and propensities: these are coeval with the individual, and are gradually un∣folded, some early, some late. The external senses, being necessary for self-preservation, soon arrive at maturity. Some internal senses, of or∣der for instance, of propriety, of dignity, being
<PB N="85" REF="89"/>
of no use during infancy, are not only slow in their progress toward maturity, but require much culture. Among savages they are scarce perceptible.</P>
<P>The moral sense, in its progress, differs from those last mentioned: it is frequently discovered, even in childhood. It is however slow of growth, and seldom arrives at perfection without culture and experience.</P>
<P>The moral sense not only ripens gradually with the other internal senses mentioned, but from them acquires force and additional authority: a savage makes no difficulty to kill an enemy in cold blood: bloody scenes are familiar to him, and his moral sense is not sufficiently vigorous to give him compunction. The action appears in a different light to a person who has more delica∣cy of feeling; and accordingly the moral sense has much more authority over those who have received a refined education, than over savages.</P>
<P>It is pleasant to trace the progress of morality in members of a polished nation. Objects of ex∣ternal sense make the first impressions; and from them are derived a stock of simple ideas. Affec∣tion, accompanying ideas, is first directed to par∣ticular objects, such as my brother, my wise, my friend. The mind opening by degrees, takes in complex objects, such as my country, my reli∣gion, the government under which I live; and these also become objects of affection. Our con∣nections multiply, and the moral sense gaining strength as the mind opens, regulates our duty to each of them. Objects of hatred multiply, as well as objects of affection, and give full scope to dissocial passions, the most formidable antagonists that morality has to encounter. But nature hath provided a remedy: the person who indulges malice or revenge, is commonly the
<PB N="86" REF="90"/>
greatest sufferer by the indulgence: men become wise by experience, and have more peace and satisfaction in fostering kindly affection: stormy passions are subdued, or brought under rigid dis∣cipline; and benevolence triumphs over selfish∣ness. We refine upon the pleasures of society: we learn to submit our opinions: we affect to give preference to others; and readily fall in with whatever sweetens social intercourse: we care∣fully avoid causes of discord; and overlooking trifling offences, we are satisfied with moderate reparation, even for gross injuries.</P>
<P>A nation from its original savage state, grows to maturity like the individuals above described; and the progress of morality is the same in both. The savage state is the infancy of a nation, dur∣ing which the moral sense is feeble, yielding to custom, to imitation, to passion. But a nation, like a member of a polished society, ripens gra∣dually, and acquires a taste in the fine arts, with acuteness of sense in matters of right and wrong. Hatred and revenge, the great obstacles to moral duty, raged without control, while the privilege of avenging wrongs was permitted to individu∣als<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Historical Law-tracts, tract 1.</NOTE>. But hatred and revenge yielding gradu∣ally to the pleasures of society, and to the grow∣ing authority of the moral sense; and benevolent affections prevailed over dissocial passions. In that comfortable period, we hear no more of cru∣elty as a national character: on the contrary, the aversion we have to an enemy, is even in war ex∣ercised with moderation. Nor do the stormy passions ever again revive; for after a nation be∣gins to decline from its meridian height, the pas∣sions
<PB N="87" REF="91"/>
that prevail are not of the violent kind, but selfish, timorous, and deceitful.</P>
<P>Morality however has not to this day arrived to such maturity as to operate between nations with equal steadiness and vigour as between indi∣viduals. Ought this to be regretted as an im∣perfection in our nature? I think not: had we the same compunction of heart for injuring a nation as for injuring an individual, and were injustice equally blameable as to both, war would cease, and a golden age ensue; than which a greater misfortune could not befal the human race<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book 2. Sketch 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the progress from maturity to a declining state, a nation differs widely from an individual. Old age puts an end to the latter: there are ma∣ny causes that weaken the former; but old age is none of them, if it be not in a metaphorical sense. Riches, selfishness, and luxury, are the diseases that weaken prosperous nations: these diseases, following each other in a train, corrupt the heart, dethrone the moral sense, and make an anarchy in the soul: men stick at no expence to purchase pleasure; and they stick at no vice to supply that expence.</P>
<P>Such are the outlines of morality in its pro∣gress from birth to burial; and these outlines I propose to fill up with an induction of particu∣lars. Looking back to the commencement of ci∣vil society, when no wants were known but those of nature, and when such wants were amply pro∣vided for; we find individuals of the same tribe living innocently and cordially together: they had no irregular appetites, nor any ground of strife.
<PB N="88" REF="92"/>
In that state, moral principles joined their influ∣ence with that of national affection, to secure individuals from harm. Savages accordingly, who have plenty of food, and are simple in ha∣bitation and clothing, seldom transgress the rules of morality within their own tribe. Diodorus Siculus, who composed his history recently after Caesar's expedition into Britain, says, that the inhabitants dwelt in mean Cottages covered with reeds or sticks; that they were of much sincerity and integrity, contented with plain and homely fare; and were strangers to the excess and lux∣ury of rich men. In Friezeland, in Holland, and in other maritime provinces of the Nether∣lands, locks and keys were unknown, till the in∣habitants became rich by commerce: they con∣tented themselves with bare necessaries, which every one had in plenty. The Laplanders have no notion of theft. When they make an excur∣sion into Norway, which is performed in the summer months, they leave their huts open, without fear that any thing will be purloined. Formerly, they were entirely upright in their only commerce, that of bartering the skins of wild beasts for tobacco, brandy, and coarse cloth. But being often cheated by strangers, they begin to more cunning. Crantz, describing the inha∣bitants of Iceland before they were corrupted by commerce with strangers, says, that they lived under the same roof with their cattle; that eve∣ry thing was common among them except their wives and children; and that they were simple in their manners, having no appetite but for what nature requires. In the reign of Edwin King of Northumberland, a child, as historians report, might have travelled with a purse of gold, with∣out hazard of robbery: in our days of luxury, want is so intolerable, that even fear of death is
<PB N="89" REF="93"/>
not sufficient to deter us. All travellers agree, that the native Canadians are perfectly disinter∣ested, abhorring deceit and lying. The Califor∣nians are fond of iron and sharp instruments; and yet are so strictly honest, that carpenter-tools left open during night, were safe. The sa∣vages of North America had no locks for their goods: they probably have learned from Euro∣peans, to be more circumspect. Procopius bears testimony<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Historia Gothica, lib. 3.</NOTE>, that the Sclavi, like the Huns, were innocent people, free of all malice. Plan Carpin, the Pope's ambassador to the Cham of Tartary, ann. 1246, says, that the Tartars are not addicted to thieving; and that they leave their goods open without a lock. Nicholas Da∣mascenus reports the same of the Celtae. The original inhabitants of the island Borneo, expel∣led by the Mahometans from the sea-coast to the center of the country, are honest, industrious, and kindly to each other: they have some notion of property, but not such as to render them co∣vetous. Pagans in Siberia are numerous; and, though grossly ignorant, especially in matters of religion, they are a good moral people. It is rare to hear among them of perjury, thieving, fraud, or drunkenness; if we except those who live among the Russian Christians, with whose vices they are tainted. Strahlenberg<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Description of Russia, Siberia, &amp;c.</NOTE> bears testimony to their honesty. Having employed a number of them in a long navigation, he slept in the same boat with men whose names he knew not, whose language he understood not, and yet
<PB N="90" REF="94"/>
lost not a particle of his baggage. Being obliged to remain a fortnight among the Ostiacs, upon the river Oby, his baggage lay open in a hut in∣habited by a large family, and yet nothing was purloined. The following incident, which he also mentions, is remarkable. A Russian of To∣bolski, in the course of a long journey, lodged one night in an Ostiac's hut, and the next day on the road missed his purse with a hundred ru∣bles. His landlord's son, hunting at some distance from the hut, found the purse, but left it there. By his father's order, he covered it with branch∣es, to secure it in case an owner should be found. After three months, the Russian re∣turning, lodged with the same Ostiac; and men∣tioning occasionally the loss of his purse, the Ostiac, who at first did not recollect his face, cried out with joy, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Art thou the man who lost that purse? my son shall go and shew thee where it lies, that thou mayest take it up with thine own hand."</Q> The Hottentots<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Kolben.</NOTE> have not the least notion of theft: tho' im∣moderately fond of tobacco and brandy, they are employed by the Dutch for tending warehouses full of these commodities. Here is an instance of probity above temptation, even among sava∣ges in the first stage of social life. Some indi∣viduals are more liberally endued than others with virtuous principles: may it not be thought, that in that respect nature has been more kind to the Hottentots than to many other tribes? Spa∣niards, settled on the sea-coast of Chili, carry on a commerce with neighbouring savages, for bri∣dles, spurs, knives, and other manufactures of
<PB N="91" REF="95"/>
iron; and in return receive oxen, horses, and even children for slaves. A Spaniard carries his goods there; and after obtaining liberty to dis∣pose of them, he moves about, and delivers his goods, without the least reserve, to every one who bargains with him. When all is sold, he intimates his departure; and every purchaser hurries with his goods to him; and it is not known that any one Indian ever broke his en∣gagement. They give him a guard to carry him safe out of their territory, with all the slaves, horses, and cattle he has purchased. The sava∣ges of Brazil are faithful to their promises, and to the treaties they make with the Portuguese. Upon some occasions, they may be accused of error and wrong judgment, but never of injus∣tice nor of duplicity.</P>
<P>While the earth was thinly peopled, plenty of food, procured by hunting and fishing, promoted population; but as population lessens the stock of animal food, a savage nation, encreasing in num∣bers, must spread wider and wider for more game. Thus tribes, at first widely separate from each other, approach gradually till they become neighbours. Hence a new scene with respect to morality. Differences about their hunting fields, about their game, about personal injuries, mul∣tiply between neighbours; and every quarrel is blown into a flame, by the aversion men natural∣ly have to strangers. Anger, hatred, and re∣venge, find now vent, which formerly lay latent without an object: dissocial passions prevail without control, because among savages morality is no match for them; and cruelty becomes pre∣dominant in the human race. Ancient history accordingly is full of enormous cruelties; wit∣ness the incursions of the northern barbarians into the Roman empire; and witness the incursions
<PB N="92" REF="96"/>
of Genhizcan and Tamerlane into the fertile countries of Asia, spreading destruction with fire and sword, and sparing neither man, wo∣man, nor infant.</P>
<P>Malevolent passions daily exercised against per∣sons of a different tribe, acquiring strength by exercise, came to be vented against persons even of the same tribe; and the privilege long enjoyed by individuals, of avenging the wrongs done to them, bestowed irresistible force upon such passi∣ons<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Historical Law-tracts, tract 1.</NOTE>. The history of ancient Greece presents nothing to the reader but usurpations, assassinati∣ons, and other horrid crimes. The names of many famous for wickedness, are still preserved; Atreus, for example, Eteocles, Alcmeon, Phe∣dra, Clytemnestra. The story of Pelops and his descendants, is a chain of criminal horrors: du∣ring that period, parricide and incest were ordi∣nary incidents. Euripides represents Medea vow∣ing revenge against her husband Jason, and laying a plot to poison him. Of that infamous plot the chorus express their approbation, justifying every woman who, in like circumstances, acts the same part.</P>
<P>The frequent incursions of northern barbarians into the Roman empire, spread desolation and ru∣in through the whole. The Romans, from the highest polish degenerating into savages, assumed by degrees the cruel and bloody manners of their conquerors; and the conquerors and conquered, blended into one mass, equalled the grossest bar∣barians of ancient times in ignorance and brutali∣ty. Clovis, King of the Franks, even after his conversion to Christianity, assassinated without remorse his nearest kinsman. The children of
<PB N="93" REF="97"/>
Clodomir, ann. 530, were assassinated by their two uncles. In the thirteenth centuary, Ezzeli∣no de Aromano obtained the sovereignty of Pa∣dua, by massacring 12,000 of his fellow-citizens. Galeas Sforza, Duke of Milan, was assassinated ann. 1476 in the cathedral church of Milan, af∣ter the assassins had put up their prayers for cou∣rage to perpetrate the deed. It is a still stronger proof how low morality was in those days, that the Pope himself, Sextus IV. attempted to assas∣sinate the two brothers, Laurent and Julien de Medicis; chusing the elevation of the host as a proper time, when the people would be busy about their devotions. Nay more, that very Pope, with unparalleled impudence, excommu∣nicated the Florentines for doing justice upon the intended assassins. The most sacred oaths were in vain employed as a security against that horrid crime. Childebert II. King of the Franks, en∣ticed Magnovald to his court, by a solemn oath that he should receive no harm: and yet made no difficulty to assassinate him during the gaiety of a banquet. But these instances, however horrid, make no figure compared with the massacre of St Bartholomew, where many thousands were in∣humanly and treacherously butchered. Even so late as the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, as∣sassination was not held in every case to be crimi∣nal. Many solicitous applications were made to general councils of Christian clergy, to declare it criminal in every case; but without success. Fer∣dinand King of Aragon and Navarre, after re∣peated assassinations and acts of perfidy, obtained the appellation of <HI>Great:</HI> so little authority had the moral sense during those dark ages.</P>
<P>But it is scarce necessary to mention particular instances of the overbearing power of malevolent passions during such ages. An opinion, formerly
<PB N="94" REF="98"/>
universal, that the innocent may be justly involv∣ed in the same punishment with the guilty, is of itself irrefragable evidence, that morality once had very little influence when opposed by revenge. There is no moral principle more evident, than that punishment cannot be inflicted with justice but upon the guilty; and yet in Greece, the in∣volving of the innocent with the guilty in the same punishment, was authorised even by posi∣tive law. By an Athenian law, a man commit∣ting sacrilege, or betraying his country, was ba∣nished with all his children<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Meurseus de legibus Atticis, lib. 2. cap. 2.</NOTE>. And when a ty∣rant was put to death, his children suffered the same fate<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eod. lib. 2. cap. 15.</NOTE>. The punishment of treason in Macedon, was extended against the criminal's relations<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Quintus Curtius, lib. 6. cap. 11.</NOTE>. Hanno, a citizen of Carthage, formed a plot to enslave his country, by poison∣ing the whole senate at a banquet. He was tor∣tured to death; and his children, with all his re∣lations, were cut off without mercy, though they had no accession to his guilt. Among the Japan∣nese, a people remarkably ferocious, it is the practice to involve children and relations in the punishment of capital crimes. Even Cicero, the chief man for learning in the most enlighten∣ed period of the Roman republic, and a celebra∣ted moralist, approves that practice: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nec vero me fugit, quam sit acerbum parentum scelera filiorum poenis lui: sed hoc praeclare legibus comparatum est, ut caritas liberorum amiciores

<P>I embrace the present opportunity to honour the Jews, by observing, that they were the first peo∣ple we read of, who had correct notions of mo∣rality with respect to the present point. The following law is express: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Deuteronomy xxiv. 16.</NOTE>."</Q> Amaziah, King of Judah, gave strict obedience to that law, in avenging his fa∣ther's death: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And it came to pass as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father. But the children of the mur∣derers he slew not; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Mo∣ses<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Kings, chap. 14.</NOTE>."</Q><PB N="96" REF="100"/> There is an elegant passage in Eze∣kiel to the same purpose<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chap. 18.</NOTE>: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten four grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge? As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel. The soul that sinneth, it shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the fa∣ther, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him."</Q> Among the Jews however, as among other nations, there are in∣stances without number, of involving innocent children and relations in the same punishments with the guilty. Such power has revenge, as to trample upon conscience, and upon the most ex∣press laws. Instigated with rage for Nabal's in∣gratitude, King David made a vow to God, not to leave alive of all who pertained to Nabal any that pisseth against the wall. And it was not any compunction of conscience that diverted him from his cruel purpose, but Nabal's beautiful wife, who pacified him<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Samuel, chap. 25.</NOTE>. But such contradiction between principle and practice, is not peculiar to the Jews. We find examples of it in the laws of the Roman empire. The true principle of pu∣nishment is laid down in an edict of the Emperors

<P>Human nature is not so perverse, as without veil or disguise to punish a person acknowledged to be innocent. An irregular bias of imagination, which extends the qualities of the principal to its accessories, paves the way to that unjust prac∣tice<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Elements of Criticism, chap. 2. sect. 5.</NOTE>. That bias, strengthened by indignation against an atrocious criminal, leads the mind ha∣stily to conclude, that all his connections are partakers of his guilt. In an enlightened age, the clearness of moral principles fetters the imaginati∣on from confounding the innocent with the guilty. There remain traces however of that bias, though not carried so far as murder. The sentence pro∣nounced against Ravilliac for assassinating Henry IV. of France, ordains, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That his house be erazed to the ground, and that no other build∣ing be ever erected upon that spot."</Q> Was not

<P>Murder and assassination are not only destruc∣tive in themselves, but, if possible, still more destructive in their consequences. The practice of shedding blood unjustly, and often wantonly, blunts conscience, and paves the way to every crime. This observation is verified in the an∣cient Greeks: their cruel and sanguinary charac∣ter, rendered them little regardful of the strict rules of justice. Right was held to depend on power, among men as among wild beasts: it was conceived to be the will of the gods, that superior force should be a lawful title to domi∣nion; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for what right can the weak have to what they cannot defend?"</Q> Were that max∣im to obtain, a weak man would have no right to liberty nor to life. That impious doctrine was avowed by the Athenians, and publicly as∣serted by their ambassadors in a conference with the Melians, reported by Thucydides<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lib. 5.</NOTE>. Ma∣ny persons act as if force and right were the same; but a barefaced profession of such a doc∣trine, is uncommon. In the Eumenides, a tra∣gedy of Eschylus, Orestes is arraigned in the Areopagus for killing his mother. Minerva, president of the court, decrees in favour of Orestes: and for what reason? <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Having no Mother myself, the murder of a mother toucheth not me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Athens, from the nature of its government as established by Solon, was rendered uncapable of any regular or consistent body of laws. In every case, ci∣vil and criminal, the whole people were judges in the last resort. And what sort of judges will an ignorant multitude make, who have no guide but passion and prejudice? It is vain to make good laws, when such judges are interpreters. Anacharsis, the Scythian, being present at an assembly of the people, said, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It was singular, that in Athens, wise men pleaded cau∣ses, and fools determined them."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> In the tragedy of E∣lectra,

Orestes, consulting the Delphic oracle about means to avenge his father's murder, was enjoined by Apollo to forbear force, but to em∣ploy fraud and guile. Obedient to that injunc∣tion, Orestes commands his tutor to spread in Argos the news of his death, and to confirm the same with a solemn oath. In Homer, even the great Jupiter makes no difficulty to send a lying dream to Agamemnon, chief of the Greeks. Dissimulation is recommended by the goddess Minerva<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Odyssey, book 13.</NOTE>.

Hec∣tor calls upon his brother for another lance; but in vain, for Deiphobus was not there. The Greeks in Homer's time must have been strange∣ly deformed in their morals, when such a story
<PB N="101" REF="105"/>
could be relished<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon the story of Jupiter being deceived by Juno in the 14th book of the Iliad, Pope says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he knows not a bolder fiction in all antiquity, nor one that has a greater air of impiety."</Q> Pope it would seem was little acquainted with antiquity: for such acts of impiety were common among the Greeks; and in particular the incident mentioned in the text, is not only more impious, but also a more gross violation of the laws of morality.</NOTE>. A nation begins not to po∣lish nor to advance in morality, till writing be common; and writing was not known among the Greeks at the siege of Troy. Nor were the morals of that people, as we see, much purified for a long time after writing became common. When Plautus wrote, the Roman system of mo∣rals must have been extremely impure. In his play termed <HI>Menaechmi,</HI> a gentleman of fashion having accidentally got into his hands a lady's robe with a gold clasp, instead of returning them to the owner, endeavours to sell them without shame or remorse. Such a scene would not be suffered at present, except among pick-pockets. Both the Greeks and Carthaginians were held by the Romans to be artful and cunning. The Ro∣mans continued a plain people, with much sim∣plicity of manners, when the nations mentioned had made great progress in the arts of life; and it is a fad truth, that morality declines in propor∣tion as a nation polishes. But if the Romans were later than the Greeks and Carthaginians in the arts of life, they soon surpassed them in eve∣ry sort of immorality. For this change of man∣ners they were indebted to their rapid conquests. The sanguinary disposition both of the Greeks and Romans, appears from another practice, that
<PB N="102" REF="106"/>
of exposing their infant children, which conti∣nued till humanity came in some measure to pre∣vail. The practice continues in China to this day, the populousness of the country throwing a veil over the cruelty; but from the humanity of the Chinese, I conjecture, that the practice will be found rare. The Jews, a cloudy and peevish tribe, much addicted to bloodshed, were misera∣bly defective in moral principles. Take the fol∣lowing examples out of an endless number re∣corded in the bocks of the old Testament. Jael, wife of Heber, took under her protection Sisera general of the Canaanites, and engaged her faith for his security. She put him treacherously to death when asleep; and was applauded by Debo∣rah the prophetess for the meritorious action<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Judges iv. 5.</NOTE>. That horrid deed would probably have appeared to her in a different light, had it been commit∣ted against Barac, general of the Israelites. Da∣vid, flying from Saul, took refuge with Achish, King of Gath; and though protected by that King, made war against the King's allies, say∣ing, that it was against his own countrymen of Judah. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And David saved neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings to Gath. And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him: there∣fore he shall be my servant for ever<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">I Samuel, xxvii. 11.</NOTE>."</Q> This was a complication of ingratitude, lying, and treachery. Ziba, by presents to king Da∣vid, and by defaming his master Mephibosheth, procured from the king a gift of his master's in∣heritance;
<PB N="103" REF="107"/>
though Mephibosheth had neither trimmed his beard, nor washed his cloaths, from the day the king departed till he returned in peace. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And it came to pass, when Mephi∣bosheth was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest thou not with me, Mephibosheth? And he answered, My lord, O king, my ser∣vant deceived me; for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame, and he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king. But my lord the king is an an∣gel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes. For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table: what right therefore have I to cry any more unto the king?"</Q> David could not possibly atone for his rashness, but by restoring to Mephibosheth his inheritance, and punishing Ziba in an exemplary manner. But hear the sentence: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Samuel, xix. 24.</NOTE>."</Q> The same king, after par∣doning Shimei for cursing him, and swearing that he should not die; yet upon his death-bed enjoined his son Solomon to put Shimei to death: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Now therefore hold him not guiltless; but his hoary head bring thou down to the grave with blood<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Kings, ii. 9.</NOTE>."</Q> I wish not to be misapprehend∣ed,
<PB N="104" REF="108"/>
as intending to censure David in particular. If the best king the Jews ever had, was so mi∣serably deficient in morality, what must be thought of the nation in general? When David was lurking to avoid the wrath of Saul, he be∣came acquainted with Nabal, who had a great stock of cattle. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He discharged his followers,"</Q> says Josephus<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Antiquities, book 6.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"either for avarice, or hun∣ger, or any pretext whatever, to touch a sin∣gle hair of them; preaching still on the text of doing justice to all men, in conformity to the will of God, who is not pleased with any man that covets or lays violent hands on the goods of his neighbour."</Q> Our author pro∣ceeds to acquaint us, that Nabal having refused to supply David with provisions, and having sent back the messengers with a scoffing answer, Da∣vid in great rage made a vow, that he would de∣stroy Nabal with his house and family. Our au∣thor observes, that David's indignation against Nabal, was not so much for his ingratitude, as for the virulence of an insolent outrage against one who had never injured him. And what was the outrage? It was, says our author, that Na∣bal enquiring who the said David was, and being told that he was one of the sons of Jesse, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, yes,"</Q> says Nabal, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"your run-away servants look upon themselves to be brave fellows, I warrant you."</Q> Strange looseness of morals! I mean not David, who was in wrath, but Jose∣phus writing sedately in his closet. He every where celebrates David for his justice and piety, composes for him the very warm exhortation mentioned above: and yet thinks him not guilty
<PB N="105" REF="109"/>
of any wrong, in vowing to break every rule of justice and humanity, upon so slight a provocati∣on as a scoffing expression, such as no man of temper will regard.</P>
<P>European nations, who originally were fierce and sanguinary like the Greeks and Jews, had the same cloudy and uncorrect notions of right and wrong. It is scarce necessary to give instan∣ces, the low state of morality during the dark ages of Christianity being known to all. In the time of Louis XI. of France, promises and en∣gagements were utterly disregarded, till they were sanctified by a solemn oath: nor were such oaths long regarded; they lost their force, and were not relied on more than simple promises. All faith among men seemed to be at an end. Even those who appeared the most scrupulous about character, were however ready to grasp at any subterfuge to excuse their breach of engage∣ment. And it is a still stronger proof of self-de∣ceit, that such subterfuges were frequently pre∣pared beforehand, in order to furnish an excuse. It was a common practice some ages ago, to make private protestations, which were thought sufficient to relieve men in conscience from being bound by a solemn treaty. Charles, afterward Emperor of Germany, during his minority, gave authority to declare publicly his accession to a treaty of peace, between his grandfather Max∣imilian and the King of France: but at the same time protested privately, before a notary and wit∣nesses, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That notwithstanding his public acces∣sion to the said treaty, it was not his intention to be bound by every article of it; and parti∣cularly, that the clause reserving to the King of France the sovereignty of certain territories in the Netherlands, should not be binding."</Q> Is it possible Charles could be so blind, as not to
<PB N="106" REF="110"/>
see, that such practice, if it have any effect, must destroy all faith among men? What better was this than what was practised by Robert King of France in the tenth century, to free his sub∣jects from the guilt of perjury? They swore upon a box of relics, out of which the relics were privately taken. Correa, a Portuguese ge∣neral, made a treaty with the King of Pegu; and it was agreed, that each party should swear to observe the treaty, laying his hand upon the sa∣cred book of his religion. Correa swore upon a collection of songs, and by that vile stratagem thought that he was not bound. The inhabitants of Britain were so loose formerly, that a man was not reckoned safe in his own house, without a mastiff to protect him from violence. Mastiffs were permitted even to those who dwelt within the king's forests; and to prevent danger to the deer, there was in England a court for <HI>Lawing</HI> or <HI>expeditation</HI> of mastives, <HI>i. e.</HI> for cutting off the claws of their fore-feet, to prevent them from running<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Carta de Foresta, cap. 6.</NOTE>. The trial and condemnation of Charles I. in a pretended court of justice, how∣ever audacious and unconstitutional, was yet an effort toward regularity and order. In the prece∣ding age, the king would have been taken off by assassination or poison. Every prince in Europe had an officer whose province it was to secure his master against poison. A lady was appointed to that office by Queen Elizabeth of England; and the form was, to give to each of the servants a mouthful to eat of the dish he brought in. Poi∣son must have been frequent in those days, to make such a regulation necessary. To vouch still more clearly the low ebb of morality during that
<PB N="107" REF="111"/>
period, seldom it happened that a man of figure died suddenly, or of an unusual disease, but poi∣son was suspected. Men conscious of their own vicious disposition, are prone to suspect others. The Dauphin, son to Francis I. of France, a youth of about eighteen, having overheated him∣self at play, took a great draught of iced water, and died of a pleurisy in five days. The death was sudden, but none is more natural. The sus∣picion however of poison was universal; and Montecuculi, who attended the young prince, was formally condemned to death and executed for it; for no better reason, than that he had at all times ready access to the prince.</P>
<P>Considering the low state of morality where dissocial passions bear rule, as in the scenes now displayed, one would require a miracle to recover mankind out of such anarchy. But, as observed above<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book 2. sketch 1.</NOTE>, Providence brings order out of confu∣sion. The intolerable distress of a state of things where a promise, or even an oath, is a rope of sand, and where all are set against all<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hobbes.</NOTE>, made people at last sensible, that they must either re∣nounce society altogether, or qualify themselves for it, by checking their dissocial passions. Find∣ing from experience, that the gratification of so∣cial affections exceeds greatly that of cruelty and revenge, men endeavoured to acquire a habit of self-command, and of restraining their stormy passions. The necessity of fulfilling every moral duty was recognised: men listened to conscience, the voice of God in their hearts: and the moral sense was cordially submitted to, as the ultimate
<PB N="108" REF="112"/>
judge in all matters of right and wrong. Saluta∣ry laws and steady government contributed to per∣fect that glorious revolution: private conviction alone would not have been effectual, not at least in many ages.</P>
<P>From that revolution is derived what is termed <HI>the law of nations,</HI> meaning certain regulations dictated by the moral sense in its maturity. The laws of our nature refine gradually as our nature refines. The putting an enemy to death in cold blood, is averse to improved nature, though com∣mon while barbarity prevailed. It is held infamous to use poisoned weapons, though the moral sense made little opposition while rancour and revenge were ruling passions. Aversion against strangers is taught to vary its object, from individuals to the nation that is our enemy: I bear enmity against France; but dislike not any one French∣man, being conscious that it is the duty of sub∣jects to serve their king and country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In one of our ill-concerted descents upon France during the late war, signal humanity appeared, in for∣bearing to burn a manufactory of sails and ropes, be∣longing to the King; because it would have destroyed an adjoining building of the same kind belonging to a private manufacturer.</NOTE>. In distri∣buting justice, we make no distinction between natives and foreigners: if any partiality be in∣dulged, it is in favour of the helpless stranger.</P>
<P>But cruelty is not the only antagonist to mora∣lity. There is another, less violent indeed, but more cunning and undermining; and that is the hoarding-appetite. Before money was introduced, that appetite was extremely faint: in the first stage of civil society, men are satisfied with plain necessaries; and having these in plenty, they think
<PB N="109" REF="113"/>
not of providing against want. But money is a species of property, so universal in operation, and so permanent in value, as to rouse the appe∣tite for hoarding: love of money excites industry; and the many beautiful productions of industry, magnificent houses, splendid gardens, rich gar∣ments, inflame the appetite to an extreme. In the thirteenth century, so obscured was the moral sense by rapacity and avarice, that robbery on the high-way, and the coining false money, were in Germany held to be privileges of great lords. That perjury was common in the city of London, especially among jurymen, makes a preamble in more than one statute of Henry VII. In <HI>the Dance of Death,</HI> translated from the French in the said king's reign, with additions adapted to English manners, a juryman is introduced, who, influenced by bribes, had often given a false ver∣dict. And the sheriff was often suspected as ac∣cessory to the crime, by returning for jurymen persons of a bad character. Carew, in his ac∣count of Cornwall, says, that it was an ordinary article in an attorney's bill, to charge <HI>pro amicitia vicecomitis</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"For the friendship of the sheriff."</Q></NOTE>. Perjury in jurors of the city of London, is greatly complained of. Stow informs us, that, in the year 1468, many jurors of that city were punished, and papers fixed on their heads, declaring their offence, of being corrupted by the parties to the suit. He complains of that corruption as flagrant in the reign of Elizabeth, when he wrote his account of London. Fuller, in his English Worthies, mentions it as a pro∣verbial saying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That London juries hang half, and save half."</Q> Grafton, in his Chronicle,
<PB N="110" REF="114"/>
mentions, that the chancellor of the Bishop of London being indicted for murder, the Bishop wrote a letter to Cardinal Wolsey, begging his interposition for having the prosecution stopt, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"because London juries were so corrupted, that they would find Abel guilty of the murder of Cain."</Q> In that period, the morals of the English were in every particular extremely loose. We learn from Strype's annals<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vol. 4.</NOTE>, that in the county of Somerset alone, forty persons were ex∣ecuted in one year for robbery, theft, and other felonies, thirty-five burnt in the hand, thirty-seven whipped, one hundred and eighty-three discharged, though most wicked and desperate persons; and yet that the fifth part of the felo∣nies committed in that county were not brought to trial, either from cunning in the felons, indolence in the magistrate, or foolish lenity in the people; that other counties were in no better condition, and many in a worse; and that commonly there were three or four hundred able-bodied vagabonds in every county, who lived by theft and rapine. Harrison computes, that in the reign of Henry VIII. seventy-two thousand thieves and rogues were hanged; and that in Elizabeth's time there were only hanged yearly between three and four hundred for theft and robbery. At present, there are not forty hanged in a year for these crimes. The same author reports, that in the reign of Eli∣zabeth, there were computed to be in England ten thousand gypsies. In the year 1601, com∣plaints were made in parliament, of the rapine of the justices of peace; and a member said, that this magistrate was an animal, who, for half a dozen of chickens, would dispense with a dozen
<PB N="111" REF="115"/>
of penal statutes. The people of Whidah, in Guinea, are much addicted to pilfering. Bosman was told by the King, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That his subjects were not like those of Ardrah, who on the slightest umbrage will poison an European. This, says he, you have no reason to apprehend here: but take care of your goods; for so expert are my people at thieving, that they will steal from you while you are looking on."</Q> The Caribbeans, who know no wants but what nature inspires, are amazed at the industry of the Eu∣ropeans in amassing wealth. Listen to one of them expostulating with a Frenchman in the fol∣lowing terms: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How miserable art thou, to ex∣pose thy person to tedious and dangerous voy∣ages and to suffer thyself to be oppressed with anxiety about futurity! An inordinate appetite for wealth is thy bane; and yet thou art no less tormented in preserving the goods thou hast acquired, than in acquiring more: fear of robbery or shipwreck suffers thee not to enjoy a quiet moment. Thus thou growest old in thy youth, thy hair turns gray, thy forehead is wrinkled, a thousand ailments afflict thy body, a thousand distresses surround thy heart, and thou movest with painful hurry to the grave. Why art thou not content with what thy own country produceth? Why not contemn super∣fluities, as we do?"</Q></P>
<P>To control the hoarding appetite, which when inflamed is the bane of civil society, the God of nature has provided two efficacious principles; the moral sense, and the sense of property. The hoarding appetite, it is true, is more and more inflamed by beautiful productions in the progress of art: but, on the other hand, the senses men∣tioned growing to maturity, have a commanding influence over the actions of men; and, when
<PB N="112" REF="116"/>
cherished in a good government, are a sufficient counterbalance to the hoarding appetite. The an∣cient Egyptians enjoyed for ages the blessings of good government; and moral principles were among them carried to a greater degree of refine∣ment, than at present even in our courts of equi∣ty. It was made the duty of every one, to suc∣cour those who were unjustly attacked: even pas∣sengers were not exempted. A regulation among them, that a man could not be imprisoned for debt, was well suited to the tenor of their laws and manners: it could not have taken place but among an honest and industrious people. In old Rome, though remarkable for temperance and au∣sterity of manners, a debtor could be imprisoned, and even sold as a slave, for payment of the debt; but the Patricians were the creditors, and the poor Plebeians were held in woful subjection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A bankrupt in England who pays three fourths of his debt, and obtains a certificate of his good behavi∣our, is discharged of all the debts contracted by him before his bankruptcy. Such regulation was perhaps not unsuitable to the moderation and frugality of the period when it was made. But luxury and external show, have now become our ruling passions; and to supply our extravagance, money must be procured at any rate. Trade in particular has degenerated into a species of gaming; men venturing their all, in hopes of a lucky hit to elevate them above their neighbours. And did they only venture their own, the case would not be deplorable; they venture all they can procure upon credit; and by that means, reduce to beggary many an innocent family: with respect to themselves, they know the worst of it, which is to be cleared from their debts by a certificate. The morals of our people are indeed at so low an ebb, as to require the most se∣vere laws against bankruptcy. When a man borrows a sum, it is implied in the covenant, that all his ef∣fects
present and future shall lie open to the creditor; for which reason, it is contradictory to justice, that a creditor should be forced to discharge his debtor with∣out obtaining complete payment. Many debtors, it is true, deserve favour; but it ought to be left to the hu∣manity of creditors, and not to be forced from them by law. The debtor, at the same time, may be safely left to the humanity of his creditors: for if he have con∣ducted his affairs with strict integrity, and with any de∣gree of prudence, there will scarce be found one man so hard-hearted, as to stand out against the laudable and benevolent intentions of his fellow-creditors. Nay, if he have any regard to character, he dares not stand out: he would be held as a monster, and be abhorred by all the world. To leave a bankrupt thus to the mercy of his creditors, would produce the most salutary ef∣fects. It would excite men to be strictly just in their dealings, and put an end to gaming, so destructive to credit; because misbehaviour in any of these particu∣lars would set the whole creditors against their debtor, and leave him no hope of favour. In the late bankrupt∣statute for Scotland, accordingly, the clause con∣cerning the certificate was wisely left out, as un∣suitable to the depraved manners of the present times.</NOTE>. The
<PB N="113" REF="117"/>
moderation of the inhabitants of Hamburgh, and their public spirit, kept in vigour by a free government, preserve morality among them en∣tire from taint or corruption. I give an illustrious instance. Instead of a tax upon trade or riches, every merchant puts privately into the public chest, what he thinks ought to be his contributi∣on: the total sum seldom falls short of expectati∣on; and among that numerous body of men, not one is suspected of contributing less than his pro∣portion. But luxury has not yet got footing in that city. A climate not kindly, and a soil not fertile, enured the Swiss to temperance and to
<PB N="114" REF="118"/>
virtue. Patriotism continues their ruling passion: they are fond of serving their country; and are ho∣nest and faithful to each other: a law-suit among them is a wonder; and a door is seldom shut un∣less to keep out cold.</P>
<P>The hurtful effects of the hoarding appetite with respect to individuals, make no figure com∣pared with its poisonous influence upon the pub∣lic, in every state enriched by conquest or by com∣merce; which I have had more than one oppor∣tunity to mention. Overflowing riches unequally distributed, multiply artificial wants beyond all bounds: they eradicate patriotism: they foster luxury, sensuality, and selfishness, which are com∣monly gratified at the expence even of justice and honour. The Athenians were early corrupted by opulence; to which every thing was made subservient. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is an oracle,"</Q> says the chorus in the Agamemnon of Eschylus, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that is not purchased with money."</Q> During the infancy of a nation, vice prevails from imbecility in the moral sense: in the decline of a nation, it pre∣vails from the corruption of affluence.</P>
<P>In a small state, there is commonly much virtue at home, and much violence abroad. The Ro∣mans were to their neighbours more baneful than famine or pestilence; but patriotism in them oc∣casioned great integrity at home. An oath when given to fortify an engagement with a fellow∣citizen, was more sacred at Rome than in any other part of the world<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">L'Esprit des loix, liv. 8. ch. 13.</NOTE>. The censorian office cannot succeed but among a virtuous peo∣ple; because its rewards and punishments have no influence but upon those who are ashamed of
<PB N="115" REF="119"/>
vice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the fifteenth century, the French clergy from the pulpit censured public transactions, and even the conduct of their king, as our British clergy did in the days of Charles I. and II. They assumed the privilege of a Roman censor; but they were not men of such au∣thority as to do any good in a corrupted nation.</NOTE>. As soon as Asiatic opulence and luxury prevailed in Rome, selfishness, sensuality, and avarice, formed the character of the Romans; and the censorian power was at an end. Such re∣laxation of morals ensued, as to make a law ne∣cessary prohibiting the custody of an infant to be given to the heir, for fear of murder. And for the same reason, it was held unlawful to make a covenant <HI>de hereditate viventis.</HI> These regulati∣ons prove the Romans to have been grossly cor∣rupt. Our law is different in both articles; because it entertains not the same bad opinion of the people whom it governs. Domitius Enobarbus and Appius Pulcher were consuls of Rome in the 699th year; and Memmius and Calvinus were candi∣dates for succeeding them in that office. It was agreed among these four worthy gentlemen, that they should mutually assist each other. The con∣suls engaged to promote the election of Mem∣mius and Calvinus: and they, on the other hand, subscribed a bond, obliging themselves, under a penalty of about L. 3000 Sterling, to procure three augurs, who should attest, that they were present in the comitia when a law passed, invest∣ing the consuls with military command in their provinces; and also obliging themselves to pro∣duce three persons of consular rank, to depose, that they were not only present in the senate, but actually in the number of those who signed a de∣cree,
<PB N="116" REF="120"/>
conferring on the consuls the usual procon∣sular appointments. And yet the law made in the comitia, and the decree in the senate, were pure fictions, never even spoken of. Infamous as this transaction was, Memmius, to answer some political purpose, was not ashamed to divulge it to the senate. This same Memmius, however, continued to be Cicero's correspondent, and his professed friend. <HI>Proh tempora! proh mores!</HI> But power and riches were at that time ruling pas∣sions and the principles of morality were very lit∣tle regarded.</P>
<P>It is needless to dissemble, that selfishness, sen∣suality, and avarice, must in England be the fruits of great opulence, as in every other coun∣try; and that morality cannot maintain its autho∣rity against such undermining antagonists. Custom-house-oaths have become so familiar among us, as to be swallowed without a wry face; and is it certain, that bribery and perjury in electing par∣liament-members, are not approaching to the same cool state? In the infancy of morality, a promise makes but a slight impression: to give it force, it is commonly accompanied with many so∣lemnities<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Historical Law-tracts, tract 2.</NOTE>; and in treaties between sovereigns, even these solemnities are not relied on without a solemn oath. When morality arrives at maturi∣ty, the oath is thought unnecessary; and at pre∣sent, morality is so much on the decline, that a solemn oath is not more relied on, than a simple promise was originally. Laws have been made to prevent such immorality, but in vain: because none but patriots have an interest to support them; and when patriotism is banished by cor∣ruption, there is no remaining spring in govern∣ment
<PB N="117" REF="121"/>
to make them effectual. The statutes made against gaming, and against bribery and corruption in elections, have no authority over a degenerate people. Nothing is studied, but how to evade the penalties; and supposing statutes to be made without end for preventing known evasi∣ons, new evasions will spring up in their stead. The misery is, that such laws, if they prove abor∣tive, are never innocent with regard to consequen∣ces; for nothing is more subversive of morality as well as of patriotism, than a habit of disregarding the laws of our country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lying and perjury are not in every case equally cri∣minal; at least are not commonly reckoned so. Lying or perjury, in order to injure a man, is held highly cri∣minal; and the greater the hurt, the greater the crime. To relieve from punishment, few boggle at a lie or at perjury: sincerity is not even expected; and hence the practice of torture. Many men are not scrupulous about oaths, when they have no view but to ob∣tain justice to themselves: the Jacobites, that they might not be deprived of their privileges as British sub∣jects, made no great difficulty to swallow oaths to the present government, though in them it was perjury. It is dangerous to withdraw the smallest peg in the moral edifice; for the whole will totter and tumble. Men creep on to vice by degrees. Perjury, in order to support a friend, has become customary of late years; witness fictitious qualifications in the electors of parliament-men, which are made effectual by perjury: yet such is the degeneracy of the present times, that no man is the worse thought of upon that account. We must not flatter ourselves that the poison will reach no farther; a man who boggles not at perjury to serve a friend, will in time become such an adept, as to com∣mit perjury in order to ruin a friend when he becomes an enemy.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But pride sometimes happily interposes to stem the tide of corruption. The poor are not asham∣ed
<PB N="118" REF="122"/>
to take a bribe from the rich; nor weak states from those that are powerful, disguised only un∣der the name of <HI>subsidy</HI> or <HI>pension.</HI> Both France and England have been in the practice of securing the alliance of some foreign princes by pensions; and it is natural in the ministers of a pensioned prince, to receive a gratification for keeping their master to his engagement. England never was at any time so inferior to France, as to suffer their king to accept a pension, whatever private trans∣actions might be between the kings themselves. But the ministers of England thought it no dispa∣ragement, to receive pensions from France. E∣very minister of Edward IV. of England received a pension from Louis XI.; and they made no difficulty of granting a receipt accordingly. The old Earl of Warwick, says Commines, was the only exception: he took the money, but refused a receipt. Cardinal Wolsey had a pension both from the Emperor and from the King of France: and his master Henry was vain, that his minister was so much regarded by the first powers in Eu∣rope. During the reigns of Charles II. and of his brother James, England made so despicable a figure, that the ministers accepted pensions from Louis XIV. A king void of virtue was never well served. King Charles, most disgraceful∣ly accepted a pension from France? what scruple could his ministers have? Britain, governed by a king eminently virtuous and patriotic, makes at present so great a figure, that even the lowest minister would disdain a pension from any foreign prince. Men formerly were so blind as not to see, that a pension creates a bias in a minister, against his master and his country. At present, men are so quick-sighted as clearly to see, that a foreign pension to a minister is no better than a bribe; and it would be held so by all the world.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="123"/>
In a nation enriched by conquest or commerce, where selfish passions always prevail, it is diffi∣cult to stem the tide of immorality: the decline of virtue may be retarded by wholesome regula∣tions; but no regulations will ever restore it to its meridian vigour. Marcus Aurelius, Emperor of Rome, caused statues to be made of all the brave men who figured in the Germanic war. It has long been a practice in China, to honour persons eminent for virtue, by feasting them an∣nually at the Emperor's expence. A late Empe∣ror made an improvement: he ordered reports to be sent him annually, of men and women who when alive had been remarkable for public spirit or private virtue, in order that monuments might be erected to their memory. The following re∣port is one of many that were sent to the Empe∣ror. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"According to the order of your Majesty, for erecting monuments to the honour of wo∣men, who have been celebrated for conti∣nence, for filial piety, or for purity of man∣ners, the viceroy of Canton reports, that in the town of Sinhoei, a beautiful young wo∣man, named <HI>Leang,</HI> sacrificed her life to save her chastity. In the fifteenth year of our Em∣peror Canghi, she was dragged by pirates into their ship; and having no other way to es∣cape their brutal lust, she threw herself head∣long into the sea. Being of opinion, that to prefer honour before life is an example worthy of imitation, we purpose, according to your Majesty's order, to erect a triumphal arch for that young woman, and to engrave her story upon a large stone, that it may be preserved in perpetual remembrance."</Q> At the foot of the report is written, <HI>The Emperor approves.</HI> Pity it is, that such regulations should ever prove abortive, for their purpose is excellent.

they would need angels to put them in execution. Every deviation from a just selection enervates them; and frequent deviations render them a subject of ridicule. But how are deviations to be prevented, when men are the judges? Those who distribute the rewards will prefer their friends, and overlook those of greater merit. Like the censorian power in Rome, such regula∣tions, after many abuses, will sink into con∣tempt.</P>
<P>Two errors, which infested morality in dark times, have occasioned much injustice; and I am not certain, that they are yet totally eradicated. The first is an opinion, That an action derives its quality of right and wrong from the event, without regard to intention. The other is, That the end justifies the means; or, in other words, That means, otherwise unlawful, may be law∣fully employed to bring about a good end. With an account of these two errors, I shall close the present historical sketch.</P>
<P>That intention is the circumstance which qua∣lifies an action, and its author, to be criminal or innocent, is made evident in the first part of the present sketch, and is now admitted to be so by every moral writer. But rude and barbarous na∣tions seldom carry their thoughts beyond what falls under their external senses: they conclude an action to be right that happens to do good, and an action to be wrong that happens to do harm; without ever thinking of motives, of will, of intention, or of any circumstance that is not obvious to eye-sight. From many passages in the Old Testament it appears, that the external act only, with its consequences, were regarded. Isaac, imitating his father Abraham, made his wife Rebecca pass for his sister. Abimelech, King of the Philistines, having discovered the
<PB N="121" REF="125"/>
imposture, said to Isaac, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What is this thou hast done unto us? One of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldst have brought guiltiness upon us<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Genesis, chap. 26.</NOTE>."</Q> Jonathan was condemned to die for transgressing a prohibition he never heard of<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Samuel, xiv. 44.</NOTE>. A sin of ignorance, <HI>i. e.</HI> an action done without ill inten∣tion, required a sacrifice of expiation<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Leviticus, chap. 4.</NOTE>. Saul being defeated by the Philistines, fell on his own sword: the wound not being mortal, he prevail∣ed on a young Amalekite, to pull out the sword, and to dispatch him with it. Josephus<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Book 3. of Antiquities.</NOTE> says, that David ordered the criminal to be delivered up to justice as a regicide.</P>
<P>The Greeks appear to have wavered greatly about intention, sometimes holding it essential to a crime, and sometimes disregarding it as a cir∣cumstance of no moment. Of these contradic∣tory opinions we have pregnant evidence in the two tragedies of Oedipus; the first taking it for granted, that a crime consists entirely in the ex∣ternal act and its consequences; the other hold∣ing intention to be indispensable. Oedipus had killed his father Laius, and married his mother Jocasta; but without any criminal intention, be∣ing ignorant of his relation to them. And yet history informs us, that the gods punished the Thebans with pestilence, for suffering a wretch so grossly criminal to live. Sophocles, author of both tragedies, puts the following words in the mouth of Tiresias the prophet.<Q><PB N="122" REF="126"/>
<L>—Know then,</L>
<L>With those he loves, unconscious of his guilt,</L>
<L>Is yet most guilty.</L></Q> And that doctrine is espoused by Aristotle in a later period, who holding Oedipus to have been deeply criminal, though without intention, is of opinion, that a more proper subject for tragedy never was brought upon the stage. Nay as a philosopher he talks currently of an involuntary crime. Orestes, in Euripides, acknowledges him∣self to be guilty in killing his mother; yet asserts with the same breath, that his crime was inevi∣table, a necessary crime, a crime commanded by religion.</P>
<P>In Oedipus Coloneus, the other tragedy menti∣oned, a very different proposition is maintained. A defence is made for that unlucky man, agreeable to sound moral principles, that, having had no bad intention, he was entirely innocent; and that his misfortunes ought to be ascribed to the wrath of the gods.<Q><L>Thou who upbraid'st me thus for all my woes,</L>
<L>Murder and incest, which against my will</L>
<L>I had committed; so it pleas'd the gods,</L>
<L>Offended at my race for former crimes.</L>
<L>But I am guiltless; can'st thou name a fault</L>
<L>Deserving this? For, tell me, was it mine,</L>
<L>When to my father, Phoebus did declare,</L>
<L>That he should one day perish by the hand</L>
<L>Of his own child; was Oedipus to blame,</L>
<L>Who had no being then? If, born at length</L>
<L>To wretchedness, he met his sire unknown,</L>
<L>And slew him, that involuntary deed</L>
<L>Can'st thou condemn? And for my fatal mar∣riage,</L>
<L>Dost thou not blush to name it? was not she</L>
<L><PB N="123" REF="127"/>
Thy sister, she who bore me, ignorant</L>
<L>And guiltless woman! afterwards my wife,</L>
<L>And mother to my children? What she did, she did unknowing.</L>
<L>But, not for that, nor for my murder'd father,</L>
<L>Have I deserv'd thy bitter taunts: for, tell me,</L>
<L>Thy life attack'd, wouldst thou have staid to ask</L>
<L>Th' assassin, if he were thy father? No;</L>
<L>Self-love would urge thee to revenge the insult.</L>
<L>Thus was I drove to ill by th' angry gods;</L>
<L>This, shou'd my father's soul revisit earth,</L>
<L>Himself would own, and pity Oedipus.</L></Q> Again, in the fourth act, the following prayer is put up for Oedipus by the chorus.<Q><L>—O grant,</L>
<L>That not oppress'd by tort'ring pain</L>
<L>Beneath the stroke of death he linger long;</L>
<L>But swift, with easy steps, descend to Styx's drear abode;</L>
<L>For he hath led a life of toil and pain;</L>
<L>May the just gods repay his undeserved woe.</L></Q> The audience was the same in both plays. Did they think Oedipus to be guilty in the one play, and innocent in the other? If they did not, how could both plays be relished? if they did, they must have been grossly stupid.</P>
<P>The statues of a Roman Emperor were held so sacred, that to treat them with any contempt was high treason. This ridiculous opinion was carried so far out of common sense, that a man was held guilty of high treason, if a stone thrown by him happened accidentally to touch one of these statues. And the law continued in force till abrogated by a rescript of Severus Antoni∣nus<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">l. 5. ad leg. Jul. Majest.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="128"/>
In England, so little was intention regarded, that casual homicide, and even homicide in self-defence, were capitally punished. It requires strong evidence to vouch so absurd a law; and I have the strongest, viz. the act of 52<SUP>o</SUP> Henry III. cap. 26. converting the capital punishment into a forfeiture of moveables. The same gross blunder continued much longer to be law in Scot∣land. By act 19. parl. 1649, renewed act 22. parl. 1661, the capital punishment is converted to imprisonment, or a fine to the wife and chil∣dren. In a period so late as the Restoration, strange blindness it was, not to perceive, that homicide in self-defence, being a lawful act, jus∣tified by the strictest rules of morality, subjects not a man to punishment, more than the defend∣ing his property against a robber; and that ca∣sual homicide, meaning homicide committed in∣nocently without ill intention, may subject him to reparation, but never to any punishment, mild or severe.</P>
<P>The Jesuits in their doctrines seem to rest on the external act, disregarding intention. It is with them a matter of perfect indifference, from what motive men obey the laws of God; and that the service of those who obey from fear of punishment, is no less acceptable to the Deity, than of those who obey from a principle of love<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">External show made a great figure, when nothing was regarded but what is visible.

<P><PB N="125" REF="129"/>
The other error mentioned above, is, That the end justifies the means. In defence of that proposition, it is urged, that the character of the means is derived from the end; that every action must be right which contributes to a good end, and that every action must be wrong which con∣tributes to an ill end. But those who reason thus, ought first to consider, whether reasoning be at all applicable to the present subject. Rea∣son is the true touchstone of truth and falsehood; but the moral sense is the only touchstone of right and wrong; and to maintain, that reason is our guide in judging of right and wrong, is no less absurd than to maintain, that the moral sense is our guide in judging of truth and falsehood. The moral sense dictates, that on no pretext whatever is it lawful to do an act of injustice, or any wrong<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the first part of this sketch, sect. 2. at the end.</NOTE>: and men, conscious that the moral sense governs in matters of right and wrong, submit implicitly to its dictates. Influ∣enced however by the reasoning mentioned, du∣ring the nonage of the moral sense, men did wrong currently in order to bring about a good end; witness pretended miracles and forged writ∣ings, urged without reserve by every sect of Christians against their antagonists. And I am sorry to observe, that the error is not totally era∣dicated: missionaries employed in converting in∣fidels to the true faith, are little scrupulous about the means: they make no difficulty to feign pro∣digies in order to convert those who are not mov∣ed by argument. Such pious frauds tend to sap the very foundations of morality.</P>

<P>AS no branch of knowledge can vie with the∣ology, either in dignity or importance, it justly claims to be a favourite study with every person endued with true taste and solid judgment. From the time that writing was invented, natural religion has employed pens without number; and yet in no language is there found a com∣plete history of it.

<HEAD>Existence of a DEITY.</HEAD>
<P>THAT there are beings, one or many, powerful above men, has been generally believed among the various tribes of men: I may say universally believed, notwithstanding what is
<PB N="127" REF="131"/>
reported of some gross savages; for reports re∣pugnant to the common nature of man, require more able vouchers than a few illiterate voyagers. Among many savage tribes, there are no words but for objects of external sense: is it surprising, that such people are incapable to express their re∣ligious perceptions, or any perception of internal sense? and from their silence can it be fairly pre∣sumed, that they have no such perception<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the language even of Peru, there is not a word for expressing an abstract idea, such as <HI>time, endurance, space, existence, substance, matter, body.</HI> It is no less defective in expressing moral ideas, such as <HI>virtue, jus∣tice, gratitude, liberty.</HI> The Yameos, a tribe on the river Oroonoko, described by Condamine, use the word <HI>poettarraroincouroac</HI> to express the number three, and have no word for a greater number. The Brasilian lan∣guage is nearly as barren.</NOTE>? The belief of superior powers, in every country where there are words to express it, is so well vouched, that in fair reasoning it ought to be taken for granted among the few tribes where language is deficient. Even the grossest idolatry affords to me evidence of that belief. No nation can be so brutish as to worship a stock or a stone, merely as such. The visible object is always imagined to be connected with some invisible power; and the worship paid to the former, is as representing the latter, or as in some manner connected with it. Every family among the ancient Lithuanians, en∣tertained a real serpent as a household god; and the same practice is at present universal, among the negroes in the kingdom of Whidah: it is not the serpent that is worshipped, but some deity im∣agined to reside in it. The ancient Egyptians were not idiots, to pay divine honours to a bull
<PB N="128" REF="132"/>
or a cat, as such: the divine honours were paid to a deity, as residing in these animals. The sun is to man a familiar object: as it is frequently obscured by clouds, and totally eclipsed during night, a savage readily conceives it to be a great fire sometimes flaming bright, sometimes obscured, and sometimes extinguished. Whence then sun∣worship, once universal among savages? Plainly from the same cause: it is not properly the sun that is worshipped, but a deity who is supposed to dwell in that luminary.</P>
<P>Taking it then for granted, that our belief of superior powers has been long universal, the im∣portant question is, From what cause it proceeds. A belief so universal, and so permanent, cannot proceed from chance, but must have a cause ope∣rating constantly and invariably upon all men in all ages. Philosophers, who believe the world to be eternal and self-existent, and imagine it to be the only deity, though without intelligence, endeavour to account for our belief of superior powers, from the terror that thunder and other elementary con∣vulsions raise in savages; and thence conclude that such belief is no evidence of a deity. Thus Lucretius,<Q><L>Praeterea, cui non animus formidine divum</L>
<L>Contrahitur? cui non conripunt membra pavore,</L>
<L>Fulminis horribili cum plaga torrida tellus</L>

And Petronius Arbiter,<Q><L>Primus in orbe deos fecit timor: ardua coelo</L>

Savages, grossly ignorant of causes and effects, take fright at every unusual appearance, and re∣cur to some malignant power as the cause. Now, if the authors quoted mean only, that the first perception of deity among savages is occasioned by fear, I heartily subscribe to their opinion. But if it was their meaning, that such perceptions proceed from fear solely, without having any other cause, I wish to be informed, from what source is derived the belief we have of superior benevolent beings. Fear cannot be the source: and it will be seen anon, that though malevolent deities were first recognised among savages; yet that in the progress of society, the existence of benevo∣lent deities was universally believed. The fact is certain; and therefore fear is not the sole
<PB N="130" REF="134"/>
cause of our believing the existence of superior be∣ings.</P>
<P>It is beside to me evident, that the belief even of malevolent deities, once universal among all the tribes of men, cannot be accounted for from fear solely. I observe, first, That there are many men, to whom an eclipse, an earthquake, and even thunder are unknown: Egypt in particular, though the country of superstition, is little or not at all acquainted with the two latter. Nor do such appearances strike terror into every one who is acquainted with them. The universality of the belief, must then have some cause more universal than fear. I observe next, That if the belief were founded solely on fear, it would die away gradually as men improve in the knowledge of causes and effects. Instruct a savage, that thun∣der, an eclipse, an earthquake, proceed from na∣tural causes, and are not threatenings of an incens∣ed deity; his fear of malevolent beings will va∣nish; and with it his belief in them, if founded solely on fear. Yet the direct contrary is true: in proportion as the human understanding ripens, our belief of superior powers, or of a Deity, turns more and more firm and authoritative; which will be made evident in the chapter imme∣diately following.</P>
<P>Philosophers of more enlarged views, and of deeper penetration, may possibly think, that the operations of nature, and the government of this world, which loudly proclaim a Deity, may be sufficient to open the eyes of the grossest savages, and to convince them that there is a Deity. And to give due weight to the argument, I shall relate a conversation between a Greenlander and a Da∣nish missionary, mentioned by Crantz in his his∣tory of Greenland. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is true,"</Q> says the Green∣lander, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we were ignorant Heathens, and knew
<PB N="131" REF="135"/>
little of a God, till you came. But you must not imagine, that no Greenlander thinks about these things. A kajak<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">A Greenland boat.</NOTE>, with all its tackle and implements, cannot exist but by the la∣bour of man; and one who does not under∣stand it, would spoil it. But the meanest bird requires more skill than the best kajak; and no man can make a bird. There is still more skill required to make a man: by whom then was he made? He proceeded from his pa∣rents, and they from their parents. But some must have been the first parents: whence did they proceed? Common report says, that they grew out of the earth: if so, why do not men still grow out of the earth? And from whence came the earth itself, the sun, the moon, the stars? Certainly there must be some being who made all these things, a being more wise than the wisest man."</Q> The reasoning here from effects to their causes, is sta∣ted with great precision; and were all men equal∣ly penetrating with the Greenlander, such reaso∣ning might perhaps be sufficient to account for the belief of Deity, universally spread among all sa∣vages. But such penetration is a rare quality among savages; and yet the belief of superior powers is universal, not excepting even the gross∣est savages, who are altogether incapable of rea∣soning like our Greenland philosopher. Natural history has made so rapid a progress of late years, and the finger of God is so visible to us in the va∣rious operations of nature, that we do not readily conceive how even savages can be ignorant: but it is a common fallacy in reasoning, to judge of others by what we feel in ourselves. And to
<PB N="132" REF="136"/>
give juster notions of the condition of savages, I take the liberty to introduce the Wogultzoi, a people in Siberia, as exhibiting a striking picture of savages in their natural state. That people were baptized at the command of Prince Gaga∣rin, governor of the province; and Laurent Lange, in his relation of a journey from Peters∣burgh to Pekin ann. 1715, gives the following account of their conversion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I had curiosity,"</Q> says he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to question them about their worship before they embraced Christianity. They said, that they had an idol hung upon a tree, before which they prostrated themselves, rais∣ing their eyes to heaven, and howling with a loud voice. They could not explain what they meant by howling; but only that every man howled in his own fashion. Being inter∣rogated, Whether, in raising their eyes to heaven, they knew that a god is there, who sees all the actions, and even the thoughts of men; they answered simply, That heaven is too far above them to know whether a god be there or not; and that they had no care but to provide meat and drink. Another question was put, Whether they had not more satisfac∣tion in worshipping the living God, than they formerly had in the darkness of idolatry; they answered, We see no great difference; and we do not break our heads about such mat∣ters."</Q> Judge how little capable such ignorant savages are, to reason from effects to their causes, and to trace a Deity from the operations of nature. And it may be added with great certainty, that could they be made in any degree to conceive such reasoning, yet so weak and obscure would their conviction be, as to rest there without mov∣ing them to any sort of worship; which however
<PB N="133" REF="137"/>
among savages goes hand in hand with the belief of superior powers.</P>
<P>To sum up this argument: As fear is a cause altogether insufficient for the belief of Deity, universal among all tribes; and as reasoning from effects to their causes can have no influence upon ignorant savages; what cause remains but nature itself? To make this belief universal, the image of the Deity must be stamped upon the mind of every human being, the ignorant equally with the knowing: nothing less is sufficient. And the perception we have of Deity must proceed from an internal cause, which may be termed the <HI>sense of Deity.</HI></P>
<P>Included in the sense of Deity, is the duty we are under to worship him. And to enforce that duty, the principle of devotion is made a part of our nature. All men accordingly agree in wor∣shipping superior beings, however they may dif∣ser in the mode of worship. And the universa∣lity of such worship, proves devotion to be an innate principle.</P>
<P>The perception we have of being accountable beings, arises from another branch of the sense of Deity. We expect approbation from the Deity when we do right; and dread punishment from him when guilty of any crime; not excepting the most occult crimes, hid from every mortal eye. From what cause can dread proceed in that case, but from belief of a superior being, aveng∣er of wrongs? That dread, when immoderate, disorders the mind, and makes every unusual mis∣fortune pass for a punishment inslicted by an invi∣sible hand. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear: there∣fore is this distress come upon us. And Reu∣ben

He drove his people to despair with oppressive taxes, treacherously assassinated several of his ba∣rons, and loaded others with chains. During prosperity, his conscience gave him little disqui∣et; but in adversity, his crimes stared him in the face, and made him believe that his distresses pro∣ceeded from the hand of God, as a just punish∣ment. He was terrified to distraction, when Charles VIII. of France approached with a nu∣merous army: he deserted his kingdom; and fled to hide himself from the face of God and man.</P>
<P>But admitting a sense of Deity, is it evidence to us that a Deity actually exists? The answer is, That it is complete evidence. So framed is man as to rely on the evidence of his senses<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Essays on Morality and Natural Religion, part 2. sect. 3.</NOTE>; which evidence it is not in his power to reject, were he even disposed to be a sceptic. And ex∣perience confirms our belief; for our senses, when in order, never deceive us.</P>
<P>The foregoing sense of Deity is not the only evidence we have of his existence: there is addi∣tional evidence from other branches of our na∣ture. Inherent in the nature of man are two passions, devotion, of which the Diety is the im∣mediate and only object; and dread of punish∣ment, when one is guilty of any crime. These passions would be idle and absurd were there no
<PB N="135" REF="139"/>
Deity to be worshipped or to be dreaded: they would be illusory passions, having no object: they would be the single instance of such irregu∣larity; and grossly irregular it would be, to be endued with passions or principles contrived for no end or purpose. Man makes a capital figure; and is the most perfect being that inhabits this earth: how then is it possible to believe, that he should be endued with passions contradictory to the regular and beautiful laws which govern all other things here? It is not credible. The pas∣sions mentioned, both of them, direct us to a Deity, and afford us irresistible evidence of his existence.</P>
<P>Thus our Maker leaves no work of his imper∣fect: he has revealed himself to us, in a way perfectly analagous to our nature: in the mind of every human creature, he has lighted up a lamp, which renders him visible even to the weakest sight. Nor ought it to escape observation, that here, as in every other case, the conduct of Pro∣vidence to man, is uniform. It leaves him to be directed by reason, where liberty of choice is permitted: but in matters of duty, he is provi∣ded with guides less fallible than reason: in per∣forming his duty to man, he is guided by the mo∣ral sense; in performing his duty to God, he is guided by the sense of Deity. In these mirrors, he perceives his duty intuitively.</P>
<P>It is no slight support to this doctrine, that if there really be a Deity, it is highly presumable, that he will reveal himself to man, fitted by na∣ture to adore and worship him. To other ani∣mals, the knowledge of a Deity is of no impor∣tance: to man, it is of high importance. Were we totally ignorant of a Deity, this world would appear to us a mere chaos: under the govern∣ment of a wise and benevolent Deity, chance is
<PB N="136" REF="140"/>
excluded; and every event, the result of esta∣blished laws, is perceived to be the best on the whole. Good men submit to whatever happens, without repining, trusting that every event is or∣dered by divine Providence: they submit with entire resignation; and such resignation is a sove∣reign balsam to every misfortune.</P>
<P>The sense of Deity resembles our other senses, which lie dormant till a proper object present itself. When all is silent about us, the sense of hearing is dormant; and if from infancy a man were confined to a dark room, he would be as ignorant of the sense of seeing, as one born blind. Among savages, the objects that rouse the sense of Deity, are uncommon events above the power of man; an earthquake, for example, a hurricane, a total eclipse of the sun, a sudden swell of a river that prevents their escape from an impending enemy. A savage, if he be acquain∣ted with no events but what are familiar, has no perception of superior powers; but thunder rat∣tling in his ears, or the convulsion of an earth∣quake, rouses in him the sense of Deity, and di∣rects him to some superior being as the cause of these dreadful effects. The savage, it is true, errs in ascribing to the immediate operation of a Deity, things that have a natural cause: his er∣ror however is evidence that he has a sense of Deity, no less pregnant, than when he more just∣ly attributes to the immediate operation of Deity, the formation of man, of this earth, of all the world.</P>
<P>The sense of Deity, like the moral sense, makes no capital figure among savages; the per∣ceptions of both senses being in them faint and obscure. But in the progress of nations to matu∣rity, these senses turn more and more vigorous, so as among enlightened nations to acquire a com∣manding
<PB N="137" REF="141"/>
influence; leaving no doubt about right and wrong, and as little about the existence of a Deity.</P>
<P>The obscurity of the sense of Deity among savages, has encouraged some sceptical philoso∣phers to deny its existence. It has been urged, That God does nothing by halves; and that if he intended to make himself known to man, the sense of Deity would produce equal conviction with that of seeing or hearing. When we argue thus about the purposes of the Almighty, we tread on slippery ground, where we seldom fail to stumble. What if it be the purpose of the Deity, to afford us but an obscure glimpse of his being and attributes? We have reason from analogy to con∣jecture, that this may be the case. From some particulars mentioned above<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book 2. sketch 1.</NOTE>, it appears at least probable, that entire submission to the moral sense, would be ill-suited to man in his present state; and would prove more hurtful than benefi∣cial. And to me it appears evident, that to be conscious of the presence of the Great God, as I am of a friend whom I hold by the hand, would be inconsistent with the part that Providence has destined me to act in this life. Reflect only on the restraint one is under, in presence of a superior, suppose the King himself: how much greater our restraint with the same lively impression of God's awful presence! Humility and veneration would leave no room for other passions: man would be no longer man; and the system of our present state would be totally subverted. Take another instance: Such a conviction of future re∣wards and punishments as to overcome every in∣ordinate desire, would reduce us to the condition
<PB N="138" REF="142"/>
of a traveller in a paltry inn, having no wish but for day-light to prosecute his journey. For that very reason, it appears agreeable to the plan of Providence, that we should have but an obscure glimpse of futurity. As the same plan of Provi∣dence is visible in all, I conclude with assurance, that a certain degree of obscurity, weighs nothing against the sense of Deity, more than against the moral sense, or against a future state of rewards and punishments. Whether all men might not have been made angels, and whether more hap∣piness might not have resulted from a different system, lie far beyond the reach of human knowledge. From what is known of the con∣duct of Providence, we have reason to presume, that our present state is the result of wisdom and benevolence. So much we know with certainty, that the sense we have of Deity and of moral duty, correspond accurately to the nature of man as an imperfect being; and that these senses, were they absolutely perfect, would unhinge his nature, and convert him into a very different being.</P>
<P>A theory espoused by several writers ancient and modern, must not be overlooked; because it pre∣tends to compose the world without a Deity; which would reduce the sense of Deity to be de∣lusive, if it have any existence. The theory is, That the world, composed of animals, vegetables, and brute matter, is self-existent and eternal; and that all events happen by a necessary chain of causes and effects. In this theory, though wisdom and benevolence are conspicuous in every part, yet the great work of planning and executing the whole, is understood to have been done blindly without intelligence or contrivance. It is scarce necessary to remark, that this theory, assumed at pleasure, is highly improbable, if not absurd;
<PB N="139" REF="143"/>
and yet that it is left naked to the world without the least cover or support. But what I chiefly in∣sist on is, that the endless number of wise and be∣nevolent effects, displayed every where on the face of this globe, afford to us complete evidence of a wise and benevolent cause; and as these effects are far above the power of man, we necessarily ascribe them to some superior being, or in other words to the Deity<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">First sketch of this third book, sect. 1.</NOTE>. And this is sufficient to remove the present objection against the ex∣istence of a sense of Deity. But I am not satisfied with this partial victory. I proceed to observe, that nothing more is required but the proof of a Deity, to overturn the supposition of self-exist∣ence in a world composed of many heterogeneous parts, and of a chain of causes and effects framed without intelligence or foresight, though full of wisdom and contrivance in every part. For if a Deity exist, wise and powerful above all other beings, self-existence ought to be his peculiar at∣tribute; and no person of rationality will have any hesitation in rejecting the self-existence of such a world, when so natural a supposition lies in view, as that the whole is the operation of the truly self-existent Being, whose power and wisdom are fully adequate to that arduous task.</P>
<P>Many gross and absurd conceptions of Deity that have prevailed among rude nations, are urged by some writers as another objection against a sense of Deity. That objection shall not be overlooked; but it will be answered to better pur∣pose, after these gross and absurd conceptions are
<PB N="140" REF="144"/>
examined; which shall be done in the chapter im∣mediately following.</P>
<P>The proof of a Deity from the innate sense here explained, differs materially from what is con∣tained in essays on morality and natural reli∣gion<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Part 2. sect. 7.</NOTE>. The proof there given is founded on a chain of reasoning, altogether indepen∣dent on the innate sense of Deity. Both equal∣ly produce conviction; hut as a sense operates intuitively without reasoning, the sense of Deity is made a branch of human nature, in order to enlighten those who are incapable of a long chain of reasoning; and to such, who make the bulk of mankind, it is more convincing, than the most perspicuous reasoning to a philoso∣pher.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Progress of Opinions with respect to DEITY.</HEAD>
<P>THE sense of Deity, like many other deli∣cate senses, is in savages so faint and ob∣scure as easily to be biassed from truth. Among them, the belief of many superior beings, is uni∣versal.
<PB N="141" REF="145"/>
And two causes join to produce that belief. The first is, that being accustomed to a plurality of visible objects, men, mountains, trees, cattle, and such like, they are naturally led to imagine the same plurality in things not visible; and from that slight bias, slight indeed but natu∣ral, is partly derived the system of Polytheism, universal among savages. The other is, that sa∣vages know little of the connection between causes and effects, and still less of the order and govern∣ment of this world: every event that is not fami∣liar, appears to them singular and extraordinary; and if such event exceed human power, it is with∣out hesitation ascribed to a superior being. But as it occurs not to a savage, nor to any person who is not a philosopher, that the many various events exceeding human power and seemingly unconnect∣ed, may all proceed from the same cause; they are readily ascribed to different beings. Pliny as∣cribes Polytheism to another cause, viz. the con∣sciousness men have of their imbecility: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Our powers are confined within narrow bounds: we do not readily conceive powers in the Deity much more extensive; and we supply by num∣ber what is wanting in power."</Q> Polytheism, thus founded, is the first stage in the progress of theology; for it is embraced by the rudest savages, who have neither capacity nor in∣clination to pierce deeper into the nature of things.</P>
<P>The next stage is distinguishable from others, by a belief that all superior beings are malevolent. Man by nature weak and helpless, is prone to fear, dreading every new object and every unusu∣al event. Savages, having no protection against storms, tempests, or other external accidents, and having no pleasures but in gratifying hunger, thirst, and animal love, have much to fear, and
<PB N="142" REF="146"/>
little to hope. In that disconsolate condition, they attribute the bulk of their distresses to invisible beings, who in their opinion must be malevolent. This seems to have been the opinion of the Greeks in the days of Solon; as appears in a conver∣sation between him and Croesus King of Lydia, mentioned by Herodotus in the first book of his history. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Croesus, said Solon, you ask me about human affairs; and I answer as one who thinks that all the gods are envious, and disturbers of mankind."</Q> The negroes on the coast of Guinea, dread their deities as tyrants and oppressors: having no conception of a good deity, they attribute the few blessings they re∣ceive, to the soil, to the rivers, to the trees, and to the plants. The Lithuanians continued Pagans down to the fourteenth century; and worshipped in gloomy woods, where their deities were held to reside. Their worship probably was prompt∣ed by fear, which is allied to gloominess or darkness. The people of Kamskatka acknowledge to this day many malevolent deities, having little or no notion of a good deity. They believe the air, the water, the mountains, and the woods, to be inhabited by malevolent spirits, whom they fear and worship. The savages of Guiana ascribe to the devil even their most com∣mon diseases; nor do they ever think of another remedy, but to apply to a sorcerer to drive him away. Such negroes as believe in the devil, paint his images white.</P>
<P>Conviction of superior beings, who, like men, are of a mixed nature, sometimes doing good, sometimes mischief, constitutes the third stage. This came to be the system of theology in Greece. The introduction of writing among the Greeks, while they were little better than savages, produced a compound of character and
<PB N="143" REF="147"/>
manners, that has not a parallel in any other na∣tion. They were acute in science, skilful in fine arts, extremely deficient in morals, gross beyond conception in theology, and superstitious to a de∣gree of folly; a strange jumble of exquisite sense and absurd nonsense. They held their gods to resemble men in their external figure, and to be corporeal. In the 21st book of the Iliad, Mi∣nerva with a huge stone beats Mars to the ground, whose monstrous body covered seven broad acres. As corporeal beings, they were supposed to re∣quire the nourishment of meat, drink, and sleep. Homer mentions more than once the inviting of gods to a feast: and Pausanias reports, that in the temple of Bacchus at Athens, there were fi∣gures of clay, representing a feast given by Am∣phyction to Bacchus and other deities. The in∣habitants of the island Java are not so gross in their conceptions, as to think that the gods eat the offerings presented to them: but it is their opinion, that a deity brings his mouth near the offering, sucks out all its savour, and leaves it tasteless like water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All Greek writers, and those in their neighbour∣hood, form the world out of a chaos. They had no such exalted notion of a deity as to believe, that he could make the world out of nothing.</NOTE>. The Grecian gods, as de∣scribed by Homer, dress, bathe, and anoint, like mortals.

Juno's dress is most poetically described, Iliad, book 14. It was also universally believed, that the gods were fond of women, and had many children by them. The ancient Germans thought more sensibly, that the gods were too high to re∣semble men in any degree, or to be confined within the walls of a temple. Led by the same impressions of deity, the Greeks seem to have thought, that the gods did not much exceed themselves in knowledge. When Agesilaus jour∣neyed with his private retinue, he usually lodged in a temple; making the gods witnesses, says Plutarch, of his most secret actions. The Greeks thought, that a god, like a man, might know what passed within his own house; without knowing any thing passing at a greater distance. Agamemnon, in Eschylus, putting off his travel∣ling habit, and dressing himself in splendid pur∣ple, is afraid of being seen and envied by some jealous god. We learn from Seneca, that peo∣ple strove for the seat next to the image of the deity, that their prayers might be the better heard. But what we hae chiefly to remark up∣on this head, is, that the Grecian gods were, like men, held capable of doing both good and ill. Jupiter, their highest deity, was a ravish∣er of women, and a notorious adulterer. In the second book of the Iliad, he sends a lying dream to deceive Agamemnon. Mars seduces Venus by bribes to commit adultery<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Odyssey, book 8.</NOTE>. In the
<PB N="145" REF="149"/>
Rhesus of Euripides, Minerva, disguised like Venus, deceives Paris by a gross lie. The ground-work of the tragedy of Xuthus is a lying oracle, declaring Ion, son of Apollo and Creusa, to be the son of Xuthus. Orestes in Euripides, having slain his mother Clytemnestra, excuses himself as having been misled by Apollo to com∣mit the crime. <Q REND="inline">"Ah!"</Q> says he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"had I con∣sulted the ghost of my father, he would have dissuaded me from a crime that has proved my ruin, without doing him any good."</Q> He con∣cludes with observing, that having acted by Apol∣lo's command, Apollo is the only criminal. In a tragedy of Sophocles, Minerva makes no diffi∣culty to cheat Ajax, by promising to be his friend, while underhand she is serving Ulysses, his bitter enemy. Mercury, in revenge for the mur∣der of his son Myrtilus, entails curses on Pelops the murderer, and on all his race<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The English translator of that tragedy, observes it to be remarkable in the Grecian creed, that the gods punish the crimes of men upon their innocent posterity.</NOTE>. In general, the gods, every where in Greek tragedies, are partial, unjust, tyrannical, and revengeful. The Greeks accordingly have no reserve in maltreat∣ing their gods. In the tragedy of Prometheus, Jupiter, without the least ceremony, is accused of being an usurper. Eschylus proclaims pub∣licly on the stage, that Jupiter, a jealous, cruel, and implacable tyrant, had overturned every thing in heaven; and that the other gods were reduced to be his slaves. In the Iliad, book 13. Mene∣laus addresses Jupiter in the following words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O father Jove! in wisdom, they say, thou excellest both men and gods. Yet all these
<PB N="146" REF="150"/>
ills proceed from thee; for the wicked thou dost aid in war. Thou art a friend to the Trojans, whose souls delight in force, who are never glutted with blood."</Q> The gods were often treated with a sort of contemptuous fami∣liarity, and employed in very low offices. No∣thing is more common, than to introduce them as actors in Greek tragedies; frequently for tri∣vial purposes: Apollo comes upon the stage most courteously to acquaint the audience with the subject of the play. Why is this not urged by our critics, as classical authority against the rule of Horace, <HI>Nec deus intersit nisi dignus vindice no∣dus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Nor let a god in person stand display'd,</L>
<L>Unless the labouring plot deserve his aid.</L><BIBL>FRANCIS.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Homer makes very useful servants of his gods. Minerva, in particular, is a faithful at∣tendant upon Ulysses. She acts the herald, and calls the chiefs to council<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Odyssey, book 8.</NOTE>. She marks the place where a great stone fell that was thrown by Ulysses<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Book 8.</NOTE>. She assists Ulysses to hide his trea∣sure in a cave<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Book 13.</NOTE>, and helps him to wrestle with a beggar<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Book 18.</NOTE>. Ulysses being tossed with cares in bed, she descends from heaven to make him fall asleep<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Odyssey, book 20.</NOTE>.

Jupiter, book 17. of the Iliad, is intro∣duced comforting the steeds of Achilles for the death of Patroclus. It appears from Cicero<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1. De natura deorum.</NOTE>, that when Greek philosophers began to reason about the deity, their notions were wonderfully crude. One of the hardest morsels to digest in Plato's philosophy, was his doctrine, That God is incorporeal; which by many was thought ab∣surd, for that, without a body, he could not have senses, nor prudence, nor pleasure. The religious creed of the Romans seems to have been little less impure than that of the Greeks. It was a ceremony of theirs, in besieging a town, to evocate the tutelar deity, and to tempt him by a reward to betray his friends and votaries. In that ceremony, the name of the tutelar deity was thought of importance; and for that reason, the tutelar deity of Rome was a profound se∣cret<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The form of the <HI>evocatio</HI> follows. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Tuo duc∣tu, inquit, Pythie Apollo, tuoque numine instinc∣tus, pergo ad delendam urbem Veios: tibique hinc decimam partem praedae voveo.

the Parthian war, reports, that Antony, redu∣ced to extremity by the Parthians, lifted up his eyes to heaven, and besought the gods, that if any of them were jealous of his former happi∣ness, they would pour their vengeance upon his head alone, and suffer his army to escape. The story of Paris and the three goddesses gives no favourable impression, either of the morals or re∣ligion of the Romans. Juno and her two sister∣deities submit their dispute about beauty to the

shepherd Paris, who conscientiously pronounces in favour of Venus. But

<L><HI>Judicium Paridis, spretaeque injuria formae.</HI></L></Q>
Juno, not satisfied with wreaking her malice against the honest shepherd, declares war against his whole nation. Not even Eneas, though a fu∣gitive in foreign lands, escapes her fury. Their great god Jupiter is introduced on the stage by Plautus, to deceive Alcmena, and to lie with her in the shape of her husband. Nay, it was the opinion of the Romans, that this play made much for the honour of Jupiter; for in times of national troubles and calamities, it was common∣ly acted to appease his anger;—a most preg∣nant instance of the gross conceptions of that warlike people in morality, as well as in religion.</P>
<P>A division of invisible beings into benevolent and malevolent, without any mixture of these qualities, makes the fourth stage. The talents and feelings of men, refine gradually under good government: social amusements begin to make a figure: benevolence is highly regarded; and some men are found without gall. Having thus acqui∣red a notion of pure benevolence, and finding it exemplified in some persons, it was an easy step in the progress of theological opinions, to bestow the same character upon some superior beings. This led men to distinguish their gods into two kinds, essentially different; one entirely benevo∣lent, another entirely malevolent; and the diffe∣rence between good and ill, which are diametri∣cally opposite, favoured that distinction. For∣tunate events out of the common course of na∣ture, were accordingly ascribed to benevolent de∣ities; and unfortunate events of that kind, to
<PB N="150" REF="154"/>
malevolent. In the time of Pliny the elder, ma∣levolent deities were worshipped at Rome. He mentions a temple dedicated to <HI>Bad Fortune,</HI> ano∣ther to the disease termed a <HI>Fever.</HI> The Lace∣demonians worshipped <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Fear,</HI> and the people of Cadiz <HI>Poverty</HI> and <HI>Old Age;</HI> in order to deprecate their wrath. Such gods were by the Romans termed <HI>Averrunci,</HI> as putting away evil.</P>
<P>Conviction of one supreme benevolent Deity, and of inferior deities, some benevolent, some malevolent, is the fifth stage. Such conviction, which gains ground in proportion as morality ri∣pens, arises from a remarkable difference be∣tween gratitude and fear. Willing to show my gratitude for some kindness proceeding from an unknown hand, several persons occur to my con∣jectures; but I always fix at last upon one person as the most likely. Fear is of an opposite nature: it expands itself upon every suspicious person, and blackens them all equally. Thus, upon pro∣vidential good fortune above the power of man, we naturally rest upon one benevolent Deity as the cause; and to him we confine our gratitude and veneration. When, on the other hand, we are struck with an uncommon calamity, every thing that possibly may be the cause, raises terror in us. Hence the propensity in savages to multi∣ply objects of fear; but to confine their grati∣tude and veneration to a single object. Grati∣tude and veneration, at the same time, are of such a nature, as to raise a high opinion of the person who is their object; and when a single in∣visible being is understood to pour out blessings with a liberal hand, good men, inflamed with gratitude, put no bounds to the power and bene∣volence of that being. And thus one supreme benevolent Deity comes to be recognised among the more enlightened savages. With respect to
<PB N="151" REF="155"/>
malevolent deities, as they are supposed to be numerous, and as there is no natural impulse for elevating one above the another, they are all of them held to be of an inferior rank, subordinate to the supreme Deity.</P>
<P>Unity in the supreme being hath, among phi∣losophers, a more solid foundation, viz. unity of design and of order in the creation and govern∣ment of this world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All things in the universe are evidently of a piece. Every thing is adjusted to every thing; one design prevails through the whole: and this uniformity leads the mind to acknowledge one author; because the conception of different authors without distinction of attributes or operations, serves only to perplex the imagination, without bestowing any satisfaction on the understanding. <HI>Natural history of Religion, by David Hume, Esquire.</HI></NOTE>. At the same time, the pas∣sion of gratitude, which leads even savages to the attribute of unity in the supreme being, prepares the mind for relishing the proof of that unity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded on the unity of his works.</P>
<P>The belief of one supreme benevolent Deity, and of subordinate deities benevolent and male∣volent, is and has been more universal than any other religious creed. I confine myself to a few instances; for a complete enumeration would be endless. The different savage tribes in Dutch Guiana, agree pretty much in their articles of faith. They hold the existence of one supreme Deity, whose chief attribute is benevolence; and to him they ascribe every good that happens. But as it is against his nature to do ill, they be∣lieve in subordinate malevolent beings, like our devil, who occasion thunder, hurricanes, earth∣quakes, and who are the authors of death, dis∣eases,
<PB N="152" REF="156"/>
and of every misfortune. To these de∣vils termed in their language <HI>Yowahoos,</HI> they di∣rect every supplication, in order to avert their malevolence; while the supreme Deity is entire∣ly neglected: so much more powerful among sa∣vages, is fear than gratitude. The North-Ame∣rican savages have all of them a notion of a su∣preme Deity, creator and governor of the world, and of inferior deities, some good, some ill. These are supposed to have bodies, and to live much as men do, but without being subjected to any distress. The same creed prevails among the negroes of Benin and Congo, among the people of New Zeland, among the inhabitants of Java, of Madagascar, of the Molucca islands, and of the Caribbee islands. The Chingulese, a tribe in the island of Ceylon, acknowledge one God creator of the universe, with subordinate deities who act as his deputies: agriculture is the pecu∣liar province of one, navigation of another. The creed of the Tonquinese is nearly the same. The inhabitants of Otaheite, termed <HI>King George's island,</HI> believe in one supreme Deity; and in inferior deities without end, who preside over particular parts of the creation. They pay no adoration to the supreme Deity, thinking him too far elevated above his creatures to concern himself with what they do. They believe the stars to be children of the sun and moon, and an eclipse to be the time of copulation. According to Arnobius, certain Roman deities presided over the various operations of men. Venus presided over carnal copulation; Puta assisted at pruning trees; and Peta in requesting benefits; Nemes∣trinus was god of the woods, Nodutus ripened corn, and Terensis helped to thresh it; Vibilia assisted travellers; orphans were under the care of Orbona, and dying persons, of Naenia; Ossi∣lago
<PB N="153" REF="157"/>
hardened the bones of infants; and Mellonia protected bees, and bestowed sweetness on their honey. The inhabitants of the island of Formo∣sa recognise two deities in company; the one a male, god of the men, the other a female god∣dess of the women. The bulk of their inferior deities are the souls of upright men, who are con∣stantly doing good, and the souls of wicked men, who are constantly doing ill. The inland negroes acknowledge one supreme being, creator of all things; attributing to him infinite power, infinite knowledge, and ubiquity. They believe that the dead are converted into spirits, termed by them <HI>Iananini,</HI> or protectors, being appointed to guard their parents and relations. The ancient Goths, and several other northern nations, ac∣knowledged one supreme being; and at the same time worshipped three subordinate deities; Thor, reputed the same with Jupiter; Oden, or Woden, the same with Mars; and Friga, the same with Venus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Regnatur omnium Deus, caetera subjecta atque parentia;</Q> <HI>Tacitus de moribus Germanorum, cap.</HI> 39. [<HI>In English thus:</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"One God the ruler of all; the rest inferior and subordinate."]</Q></NOTE>. Socrates, taking the cup of poison from the executioner, held it up toward heaven, and pouring out some of it as an oblation to the su∣preme Deity, pronounced the following prayer: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I implore the immortal God that my translati∣on hence may be happy."</Q> Then turning to Crito, said, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O Crito! I owe a cock to Escu∣lapius, pay it."</Q> From this incident we find that Socrates, soaring above his countrymen, had attained to the belief of a supreme benevolent Deity. But in that dark age of religion, such purity is not to be expected from Socrates him∣self,
<PB N="154" REF="158"/>
as to have rejected subordinate deities, even of the mercenary kind.</P>
<P>Different offices being assigned to the gods, as above mentioned, proper names followed of course. And when a god was ascertained by a name, the busy mind would naturally proceed to trace his genealogy.</P>
<P>As unity in the Deity was not an established doctrine in the countries where the Christian re∣ligion was first promulgated, Christianity could not fail to prevail over Paganism; for improve∣ments in the mental faculties lead by sure steps, though slow, to one God.</P>
<P>The sixth stage is, the belief of one supreme benevolent Deity, as in that immediately forego∣ing, with many inferior benevolent deities, and one only who is malevolent. As men improve in natural knowledge, and become skilful in tra∣cing causes from effects, they find much less ma∣lice and ill-design than was imagined: humanity at last prevails, which, in connection with im∣proved knowledge, banishes the suspicion of ill-design, in every case where an event can possibly be explained without it. In a word, a settled opinion of good prevailing in the world, produ∣ced conviction among some nations, less ignorant than their neighbours, and less brutal, that there is but one malevolent subordinate deity, and good subordinate deities without number. The anci∣ent Persians acknowledged two principles; one all good and all powerful, named <HI>Hormuz,</HI> and by the Greeks corruptly <HI>Oromazes;</HI> the other evil, named <HI>Ahariman,</HI> and by the Greeks <HI>Ari∣manes.</HI> Some authors assert, that the Persians held these two principles to be coeternal: others, that Oromazes first subsisted alone, that he crea∣ted both light and darkness, and that he created Arimanes out of darkness. That the latter was
<PB N="155" REF="159"/>
the opinion of the ancient Persians, appears from their Bible, termed the <HI>Sadder;</HI> which teaches, That there is one God supreme over all, many good angels, and but one evil spirit. Plutarch acquaints us, that Hormuz and Ahariman, for ever at variance, formed, each of them, crea∣tures of their own stamp; that the former creat∣ed good genii, such as goodness, truth, wisdom, justice; and that the latter created evil genii, such as infidelity, falsehood, oppression, theft. This system of theology, commonly termed the <HI>Manichean system,</HI> is said to be also the religious creed of Pegu, with the following addition, that the evil principle only is to be worshiped; which is abundantly probable, as fear is a predominant passion in barbarians. The people of Florida be∣lieve a supreme benevolent Deity, and a subordi∣nate deity that is malevolent: neglecting the for∣mer, who, they say, does no harm, they bend their whole attention to soften the latter, who, they say, torments them day and night. The in∣habitants of Darian acknowledge but one evil spi∣rit, of whom they are desperately afraid. The Hottentots, mentioned by some writers as altoge∣ther destitute of religion, are, on the contrary, farther advanced toward its purity, than some of their neighbours. Their creed is, That there is a supreme being, who is goodness itself; of whom they have no occasion to stand in awe, as he is incapable by his nature to hurt them; that there is also a malevolent spirit, subordinate to the former, who must be served and worshipped in order to avert his malice. The epicurean doc∣trine with respect to the gods in general, That being happy in themselves, they extend not their providential care to men, differs not widely from what the Hottentot believes with respect to the supreme being.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="160"/>
Having traced the sense of deity, from its dawn in the grossest savages, to its approaching maturity among enlightened nations, we proceed to the last stage of the progress, which makes the true system of theology; and that is, con∣viction of a supreme being, boundless in every perfection, without any subordinate deities, be∣nevolent or malevolent. Savages learn early to trace the chain of causes and effects, with res∣pect to ordinary events: they know that fasting produces hunger, that labour occasions weariness, that fire burns, that the sun and rain contribute to vegetation. But when they go beyond such familiar events, they lose sight of cause and ef∣fect: the changes of weather, of winds, of heat and cold, impress them with a notion of chance: earthquakes, hurricanes, storms of thunder and lightning, which fill them with terror, are as∣cribed to malignant beings of greater power than man. In the progress of knowledge, light be∣gins to break in upon them: they discover, that such phenomena, however tremendous, come under the general law of cause and effect, and that there is no ground for ascribing them to malignant spirits. At the same time, our more refined senses ripen by degrees: social affections come to prevail; and morality makes a deep im∣pression. In maturity of sense and understand∣ing, benevolence appears more and more; and beautiful final causes are discovered in many of nature's productions, that formerly were thought useless, or perhaps destructive: and the time may come, we have solid ground to hope that it will come, when doubts and difficulties about the government of Providence, will all of them be cleared up; and every event be found condu∣cive to the general good. Such views of Provi∣dence banish malevolent deities; and we settle at

last in a most comfortable opinion; either that there are no such beings; or that, if they exist and are permitted to perpetrate any mischief, it is in order to produce greater good. Thus, through a long maze of errors, man arrives at true religion, acknowledging but one Being, su∣preme in power, intelligence, and benevolence, who created all other beings, to whom all other beings are subjected, and who directs every e∣vent to answer the best purposes. This system is true theology<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pliny seems to relish the doctrine of unity in the Deity; but is at a loss about forming any just concep∣tion of him, sometimes considering the world to be our only deity, sometimes the sun.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having gone through the different stages of re∣ligious belief, in its gradual progress toward truth and purity, I proceed to a very important article, viz. The history of tutelar deities. The belief of tutelar deities preceded indeed several of the stages mentioned, witness the tutelar deities of Greece and Rome; but as it is not connected with any one of them exclusive of the rest, the clearness of method required it to be postponed to all of them. This belief, founded on selfishness, made a rapid progress after property in the goods of fortune was established. The Greeks, the Ro∣mans, and indeed most nations that were not mere savages, appropriated to themselves tutelar deities, who were understood to befriend them upon all occasions; and, in particular, to fight for them against their enemies. The Iliad of Homer is full of miraculous battles between the Greeks and Trojans, the tutelar deities mixing with the contending parties, and partaking of every dis∣aster, death only excepted, which immortals could
<PB N="158" REF="162"/>
not suffer. The <HI>lares, penates,</HI> or household∣gods, of Indostan, of Greece, and of Rome, bear witness, that every family, perhaps every person, was thought to be under the protection of a tute∣lar deity. Alexander ab Alexandro gives a list of tutelar deities. Apollo and Minerva were the tutelar deities of Athens; Bacchus and Hercules of the Boeotian Thebes; Juno of Carthage, Samos, Sparta, Argos, and Mycené; Venus of Cyprus; Apollo of Rhodes, and of Delphos; Vulcan of Lemons; Bacchus of Naxus; Nep∣tune of Tenedos, &amp;c. The poets testify, that even individuals had tutelar deities:<Q><L>Mulciber in Trojam, pro Troja stabat Apollo:</L>
<L>Aequa Venus Teucris, Pallas iniqua fuit.</L>
<L>Oderat Aeneam, propior Saturnia Turno;</L>

man has a tutelar deity of his own termed <HI>Manitou,</HI> who is constantly invoked during war to give him victory over his enemies. The Natches, bordering on the Missisippi, offer up the skulls of their enemies to their god, and deposite them in his temple. They consider that being as their tutelar deity who assists them against their ene∣mies, and to whom therefore the skull of an enemy must be an acceptable offering. Though they worship the sun, who impartially shines on all mankind; yet such is their partiality, that they consider themselves as his chosen people, and that their enemies are his ene∣mies.</P>
<P>A belief so absurd shows woful imbecility in human nature. Is it not obvious, that the great God of heaven and earth, governs the world by inflexible laws, from whence he never can swerve in any case, because they are the best possible in every case? To suppose any family or nation to be an object of his peculiar love, is no less impi∣ous, than to suppose any family or nation to be an object of his peculiar hatred: they equally ar∣raign Providence of partiality. Even the Goths had more just notions of the Deity. Totila, re∣commending to his people justice and humanity, says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Quare sic habete, ea quae amari ab hominibus solent ita vobis salva fore, si justitiae reverentiam servaveritis.

<P><PB N="160" REF="164"/>
That God was once the tutelar deity of the Jews, is true; but not in the vulgar acceptation of that term, importing a deity chosen by a peo∣ple to be their patron and protector. The ortho∣dox faith is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That God chose the Jews as his peculiar people, not from any partiality to them, but that there might be one nation to keep alive the knowledge of one supreme Deity; which should be prosperous while they adhered to him, and unprosperous when they declined to idolatry; not only in order to make them persevere in the true faith, but also in order to exemplify to all nations the conduct of his Providence."</Q> It is certain, however, that the perverse Jews claimed God Almighty as their tutelar deity, in the vulgar acceptation of the term. And this error throws light upon an inci∣dent related in the Acts of the Apostles. There was a prophecy firmly believed by the Jews, that the Messiah would come among them in person to restore their kingdom. The Christians gave a different sense to the prophecy, viz. that the king∣dom promised was not of this world. And they said, that Christ was sent to pave the way to their heavenly kingdom, by obtaining forgiveness of their sins. At the same time, as the Jews held all other nations in abhorrence, it was natural for them to conclude, that the Messiah would be sent to them only, God's chosen people; for which reason, even the apostles were at first doubtful
<PB N="161" REF="165"/>
about preaching the gospel to any but to the Jews<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the 10th and 11th chapters of the Acts of the Apostles.</NOTE>. But the apostles reflecting, that it was one great purpose of the mission, to banish from the Jews their groveling and impure notion of a tutelar deity, and to proclaim a state of future happiness to all who believe in Christ, they pro∣ceeded to preach the gospel to all men: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive, that God is no respecter of per∣sons: but in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Acts of the Apostles, x. 34.</NOTE>."</Q> The foregoing reasoning, however, did not satisfy the Jews: they could not digest the opinion, that God sent his Messiah to save all nations; and that he was the God of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews. They stormed against Paul in particular for inculcating that doc∣trine<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Acts of the Apostles, chap. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Considering that religion in its purity was estab∣lished by the gospel, is it not amazing, that even Christians fell back to the worship of tutelar deities? They did not indeed adopt the absurd opinion, that the supreme Being was their tutelar deity: but they held, that there are divine per∣sons subordinate to the Almighty, who take under their care nations, families, and even individuals; an opinion that differs not essentially from that of tutelar deities among the Heathens. That opini∣on, which flatters self-love, took root in the fifth century, when the deification of saints was intro∣duced,
<PB N="162" REF="166"/>
similar to the deification of heroes among the ancients. With regard to matters spiritual, as well as temporal, people are fond of friends to be their intercessors; and with regard to the Deity, deified saints were thought the properest inter∣cessors. Temples were built and dedicated to them, and solemn rites of worship instituted to render them propitious. It was imagined, that the souls of deified saints are at liberty to roam where they list, and that they love the places where their bodies are interred; which accordingly made the sepulchres of the saints a common ren∣dezvous of supplicants. What paved the way to notions so absurd, was the gross ignorance that clouded the Christian world after the northern barbarians became masters of Europe. In the seventh century, the bishops were so illiterate as to be indebted to others for the shallow sermons they preached; and the very few of that order who had any learning, satisfied themselves with com∣posing insipid homilies, collected from the wri∣tings of Augustin and Gregory. In the ninth century, matters grew worse and worse; for these saints, held at first to be mediators for Christians in general, were now converted into tutelar deities in the strictest sense. An opinion prevailed, that such saints as are occupied about the souls of Christians in general, have little time for indivi∣duals; which led every church, and every pri∣vate Christian, to elect for themselves a particular saint, as their peculiar patron or tutelar deity. That practice made it necessary to deify saints without end, in order to furnish a tutelar deity to every individual. The dubbing of saints, became a new source of abuses and frauds in the Christian world: lying wonders were invented, and fabulous histories composed, to celebrate exploits that never were performed, and to glorify persons that never
<PB N="163" REF="167"/>
had a being. And thus religion among Christians, sunk down into as low a state as it had been among Pagans.</P>
<P>There still remains upon hand a capital branch of our history; and that is idolatry, which pro∣perly signifies the worshipping visible objects as deities. But as idolatry evidently sprung from religious worship, corrupted by the igno∣rant and brutish, it will make its appearance with more advantage in the next section, of which religious worship is the subject.</P>
<P>We have thus traced with wary steps, the gra∣dual progress of theology through many stages, corresponding to the gradual openings and im∣provements of the human mind. But though that progress in almost all countries appears uni∣form with respect to the order of succession, it is far otherwise with respect to the quickness of suc∣cession: nations, like individuals, make a pro∣gress from infancy to maturity; but they advance not with an equal pace, some making a rapid course toward perfection in knowledge and in re∣ligion, while others remain ignorant barbarians. The religion of Hindostan, if we credit history or tradition, had advanced to a considerable de∣gree of purity and refinement, at a very early pe∣riod. The Hindostan Bible, termed <HI>Chatahbhade</HI> or <HI>Shastah,</HI> gives an account of the creation, lapse of the angels, and creation of man; instructs us in the unity of the Deity, but denies his pre∣science as being inconsistent with free-will in man; all of them profound doctrines of an illu∣minated people; to establish which a long course of time must have been requisite, after wandering through errors without number. Compared with the Hindows in theology, even the Greeks were mere savages. The Grecian gods were held to be little better than men, and their history, as
<PB N="164" REF="168"/>
above mentioned, corresponds to the notion en∣tertained of them.</P>
<P>In explaining the opinions of men with respect to Deity, I have confined my view to such opi∣nions as are suggested by principles or biasses that make a part of common nature; omitting many whimsical notions, no better than dreams of a roving imagination. The plan delineated shows wonderful uniformity in the progress of religion through all nations. That the whimsical notions mentioned are far otherwise, is not wonderful. Take the following specimen. The Kamskatkans are not so stupidly ignorant, as to be altogether void of curiosity. They sometimes think of na∣tural appearances.—Rain, say they, is some de∣ity pissing upon them; and they imagine the rain∣bow to be a party-coloured garment, put on by him in preparing for that operation. They be∣lieve wind to be produced by a god shaking his long hair about his head with violence. Such tales will scarce amuse children in the nursery. The inhabitants of the island Celebes formerly acknowledged no gods but the sun and the moon, which were held to be eternal. Ambition for superiority made them fall out. The moon being wounded in flying from the sun, was delivered of the earth.</P>
<P>Hitherto of the gradual openings of the human mind with respect to Deity. I close this section with an account of some unsound notions concern∣ing the conduct of Providence, and concerning some speculative matters. I begin with the for∣mer.</P>
<P>In days of ignorance, the conduct of Providence is very little understood. Far from having any notion, than the government of this world is carried on by general laws, which are inflexible because they are the best possible, every impor∣tant
<PB N="165" REF="169"/>
event is attributed to an immediate interpo∣sition of the Deity. As the Grecian gods were thought to have bodies like men, and like men to require nourishment; they were imagined to act like men, forming short-sighted plans of operati∣on, and varying them from time to time according to exigencies. Even the wise Athenians, had an utter aversion for philosophers who attempted to account for effects by general laws: such doc∣trine they thought tended to fetter the gods, and to prevent them from governing events at their pleasure. An eclipse being held to be a prognos∣tic given by the gods of some grievous calamity, Anaxagoras was accused of Atheism for attempt∣ing to explain the eclipse of the moon by natural causes: he was thrown into prison, and with dif∣ficulty was relieved by the influence of Pericles. Protagoras was banished Athens for maintaining the same doctrine. Procopius overflows with signal interpositions of Providence; and Agathias, beginning at the battle of Marathon, sagely main∣tains, that from that time downward, there was not a battle lost, but by an immediate judgment of God, for the sins of the commander, or of his army, or of one person or other. Our Savi∣our's doctrine with respect to those who suffered by the fall of the tower of Siloam, ought to have opened their eyes; but superstitious eyes are never opened by instruction. At the same time, it is deplorable that such belief has no good in∣fluence on manners: on the contrary, never doth wickedness so much abound as in dark times. A curious fact is related by Procopius<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Historia Gothica, lib. 1.</NOTE> with re∣spect to that sort of superstition. When Rome was besieged by the Goths, and in danger of de∣struction,
<PB N="166" REF="170"/>
a part of the town-wall, declining from the perpendicular, was in a tottering condi∣tion. Belisarius, proposing to fortify it, was op∣posed by the citizens, affirming, that it was guarded by St. Peter. Procopius observes, that the event answered expectation; for that the Goths, during a tedious siege, never once at∣tempted that weak part. He adds, that the wall remained in the same ruinous state at the time of his writing. Here is a curious conceit:—Peter created a tutelar deity, able and willing, for the sake of his votaries, to counteract the laws by which God governs the material world. And for what mighty benefit to them? Only to save them five or fifty pounds in rebuilding the crazy part of the wall.</P>
<P>It is no less inconsistent with the regular course of Providence, to believe, as many formerly did, that in all doubtful cases the Almighty, when appealed to, never fails to interpose in fa∣vour of the right side. The inhabitants of Con∣stantinople, ann. 1284, being split into parties about two contending patriarchs, the Emperor ordered a fire to be made in the church of St So∣phia, and a memorial from each party to be thrown into it; never doubting, but that God would save from the flames the memorial of the party whose cause he espoused. But, to the ut∣ter astonishment of all beholders, the flames paid not the least regard to either of the memorials. The same absurd opinion gave birth to the trial by fire, by water, and by singular battle. And it is not a little remarkable, that such trials were common among many nations that had no inter∣course one with another: even the enlightened people of Indostan try crimes by dipping the hand of a suspected person in boiling oil.—Such uni∣formity is there with respect even to superstitious
<PB N="167" REF="171"/>
opinions. Pope Gregory VII. insisting, that the Kings of Castile and Aragon should lay aside their Gothic liturgy for the Romish, the matter was put to trial by singular battle; and two champions were chosen, to declare by victory the opinion of God Almighty. The Emperor Otho I. observing the doctors to differ about a a point of law, viz. the right of representation in land-estates, appointed a duel; and the right of representation gained the victory. If any thing can render such a doctrine palatable, it is the be∣lieving in a tutelar deity, who with less absurdity may interpose in behalf of a favourite opinion, or of a favourite people. Appian gravely reports, that when the city of Rhodes was besieged by Mithridates, a statue of the goddess Isis was seen to dart flames of fire upon a bulky engine, raised by the besiegers to overtop the wall.</P>
<P>Historians mention an incident that happened in the island Celebes, founded on a belief of the same kind with that above mentioned. About two centuries ago, some Christian and some Ma∣hometan missionaries made their way to that island. The chief king, struck with the fear of hell taught by both, assembled a general council; and extending his hands toward heaven, addres∣sed the following prayer to the supreme being. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Great God, from thee I demand nothing but justice, and to me thou owest it. Men of dif∣ferent religions have come to this island, threatening eternal punishment to me and my people if we disobey thy laws. What are thy laws? Speak, O my God, who art the au∣thor of nature: thou knowest the bottom of our hearts, and that we can never intentionally disobey thee. But if it be unworthy of thy essence to employ the language of men, I call upon my whole people, the sun which gives
<PB N="168" REF="172"/>
me light, the earth which bears me, the sea which surrounds my empire, and upon thee thyself, to bear witness for me, that in the sincerity of my heart I wish to know thy will; and this day I declare, that I will ac∣knowledge as the depositaries of thy oracles, the first ministers of either religion that shall land on this island."</Q></P>
<P>It is equally erroneous to believe, that certain ceremonies will protect one from mischief. In the dark ages of Christianity, the signing with the figure of a cross, was held not only to be an antidote against the snares of malignant spirits, but to inspire resolution for supporting trials and calamities: for which reason no Christian in those days undertook any thing of moment, till he had used that ceremony. It was firmly believed in France, that a gold or silver coin of St Louis, hung from the neck, was a protection against all diseases: and we find accordingly a hole in every remaining coin of that king, for fixing it to a ri∣band. In the minority of Charles VIII. of France the three estates, ann. 1484, supplicated his Majesty, that he would no longer defer the being anointed with the holy oil, as the favour of Hea∣ven was visibly connected with that ceremony. They affirmed, that his grandfather Charles VII. never prospered till he was anointed; and that Heaven afterward fought on his side, till the En∣glish were expelled out of his kingdom. The high altar of St Margaret's church in the island of Icolmkill, was covered with a plate of blue marble finely veined; which has suffered from a superstitious conceit, that the smallest bit of it will preserve a ship from sinking. It has accor∣dingly been carried off piece-meal; and at pre∣sent there is scarce enough left-to make an experi∣ment. In the Sadder, certain prayers are enjoin∣ed
<PB N="169" REF="173"/>
when one sneezes or pisses, in order to chase away the devil. Cart-wheels in Lisbon are composed of two boards clumsily cut in a cir∣cular form, and nailed together. Though the noise is intolerable, yet the axles are never grea∣sed, because the noise, say they, frightens the devil from hurting their oxen.</P>
<P>Nay, so far has superstition been carried, as to found a belief, that the devil by magic can control the course of Providence. A Greek bi∣shop having dreamed, that a certain miracle had failed by magic, the supposed magician and his son were condemned to die, without the least evi∣dence but the dream. Montesquieu collects a number of circumstances, each of which, though all extremely improbable, ought to have been clearly made out, in order to prove the crime<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">L'Esprit des loix, lib. 12. ch. 5.</NOTE>. The Emperor Theodore Lascaris, imagi∣ning magic to be the cause of his distemper, put the persons suspected to the trial of holding a red-hot iron without being burnt. In the capi∣tularies of Charlemagne, in the canons of seve∣ral councils, and in the ancient laws of Norway punishments are enacted against those who are supposed able to raise tempests, <HI>Tempestarii.</HI> During the time of Catharine de Medicis, in the court of France there was a jumble of politics, gallantry, luxury, debauchery, superstition, and Atheism. It was common to take the resem∣blance of enemies in wax, in order to torment them by roasting the figure at a slow fire, and pricking it with needles. If an enemy happened in one instance of a thousand to pine and die, the charm was established for ever. Sorcery and witchcraft were so universally believed in En∣gland,
<PB N="170" REF="174"/>
that in a preamble to a statute of Henry VIII. ann. 1511, it is set forth, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That smiths, weavers, and women, boldly take upon them great cures, in which they partly use sorcery, and witchcraft."</Q> The first printers, who were Germans, having carried their books to Pa∣ris for sale, were condemned by the parliament to be burnt alive as sorcerers; and did not escape punishment but by a precipitant flight. It had indeed much the appearance of sorcery, that a man could write so many copies of a book, with∣out the slightest variation.</P>
<P>There are many examples of extraordinary vir∣tues being attributed to certain things, in them∣selves of no significancy. The Hungarians were possessed of a golden crown, sent from heaven with the peculiar virtue, as they believed, of bestow∣ing upon the person who wore it, an undoubted title to be their king.</P>
<P>But the most extraordinary effort of absurd su∣perstition, is a persuasion, that one may control the course of Providence, by making a down∣right bargain with God Almighty to receive from him <HI>quid pro quo.</HI> A herd of Tartars in Siberia, named by the Russians <HI>Baravinskoi,</HI> have in every hut a wooden idol, termed in their language <HI>Shei∣tan,</HI> about eighteen inches high, to which they address their prayers for plenty of game in hunt∣ing, promising to give it, if successful, a new coat or a new bonnet: a sort of bargain abun∣dantly brutish; and yet more excusable in mere savages, than what is made with the Virgin Ma∣ry by enlightened Roman Catholics; who, upon condition of her relieving them from distress, promise her a waxen taper to burn on her altar. Philip II. of Spain made a vow, that, upon con∣dition of gaining the battle of St Quintin, he would build the Monastery of Escurial; as if an
<PB N="171" REF="175"/>
establishment for some idle monks, could be a motive with the great God to vary the course of his Providence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Having gained the battle of St Quintin on the festival of St Laurence, Philip reckoned himself obliged to the saint for this victory, no less than to God Al∣mighty; and accordingly, he not only built the mo∣nastery he had vowed, but also a church for the saint and a palace for himself, all under one roof: and what is not a little ludicrous, the edifice is built in resem∣blance of a gridiron, which, according to the legend, was the instrument of Laurence's martyrdom.</NOTE>. Beside the absurdity of think∣ing that such vows can have the effect to alter the established laws of Providence, they betray a most contemptible notion of the Deity, as if his favours, like a horse, or a cow, could be pur∣chased with money.</P>
<P>But however loose and disjointed, events ap∣pear to the ignorant, when viewed as past, or as passing, future events take on a very differert appearance. The doctrine of prognostics is evidently founded upon a supposition, that fu∣ture events are unalterably fixed; for otherwise that doctrine would appear absurd, even to the most ignorant. There is no bias in human na∣ture that has greater influence, than curiosity about futurity; which in dark ages governs with∣out control: men with no less folly than industry have ransacked the earth, the sea, the air, and even the stars, for prognostics of future events. The Greeks had their oracles, the Romans their augurs, and all the world their omens. The Grecian oracles and Roman auguries are evi∣dently built upon their belief of tutelar deities; and the numberless omens that influence weak people in every country, seem to rest upon the
<PB N="172" REF="176"/>
same foundation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is no wonder that the Romans were superstiti∣ously addicted to omens and auguries: like mere sa∣vages, they put no value upon any science but that of war; and, for that reason, they banished all philoso∣phers, as useless members of society. Thus, that nation, so fierce and so great in war, surrendered themselves blindly to superstition, and became slaves to imaginary evils. Even their gravest historians were deeply tainted with that disease.</NOTE>. Ancient histories are stuffed with omens, prodigies, and prognostics: Livy overflows with fooleries of that kind. Endless are the adverse omens reported by Appian of Alexandria, that are said to have given warn∣ing of the defeat of Crassus by the Parthians; and no fewer in number are those which hap∣pened at the death of the Emperor Hadrian, if we believe Spartianus. Lampridius, with great gravity, recites the omens which prognosticated that Alexander Severus would be Emperor: he was born the same day on which Alexander the Great died: he was brought forth in a temple de∣dicated to Alexander the Great: he was named <HI>Alexander;</HI> and an old woman gave to his mother, a pigeon's egg of a purple colour produced on his birth-day. A comet is an infallible prognostic of the death of a king. But of what king? Why, of the king who dies next. Suetonius, with the solem∣nity of a pulpit-instructor, informs us, that the death of the Emperor Claudius was predicted by a comet; and of Tiberius, by the fall of a tower during an earthquake. Such opinions, which indeed have some foundation in our na∣ture, take fast hold of the mind, when envigo∣rated by education and example. Even philo∣sophy is not sufficient to eradicate them but by slow degrees: witness Tacitus, the most pro∣found

of all historians, who cannot forbear to usher in the death of the Emperor Otho, with a foolish account of a strange unknown bird appear∣ing at that time. He indeed, with decent reserve, mentions it only as a fact reported by others; but from the warm style of his narrative it is evi∣dent, that the story had made an impression up∣on him. The ancient Germans drew many of their omens from horses: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Proprium gentis, equorum presagia ac monitus experiri.

<P>With respect to prophecies in particular, one appology may be made for them, that no other prognostic of futurity is less apt to do mischief. What Procopius<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gothica Historia, lib. 1.</NOTE> observes of the Sybilline oracles, is equally applicable to prophecies in general, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it is above the sagacity of man to explain any of them before the event hap∣pen."</Q> After perusing many, he gives the following reason, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Matters are there handled,"</Q> says he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not in any order, nor in a continued discourse: but after mentioning the distresses of Africa, for example, they give a slight touch at the Persians, the Romans, the Assy∣rians; then returning to the Romans, they fall slap-dash upon the calamities of Britain."</Q> A curious example of this observation, is a book of prophecies composed in Scotland by Thomas Learmont, commonly called <HI>Thomas the Rhymer,</HI> because the book is in rhyme. Plutarch, in the life of Cicero, reports, that a spectre appeared to Cicero's nurse, and foretold, that the child would become a great support to the Roman
<PB N="175" REF="179"/>
state; and most innocently he makes the follow∣ing reflection: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This might have passed for an idle tale, had not Cicero demonstrated the truth of the prediction;"</Q> which in effect is saying, that if a prediction happen to prove ture, it is a real prophecy; if otherwise, that it is an idle tale. There have been prophecies not altogether so well guarded as the Sybilline oracles. Napier, inventor of the logarithms, found the day of judgment predicted in the Revelation; and named the very day; which unfortunately he survived. He made another prediction, but prudently named a day so dis∣tant, as to be in no hazard of blushing a second time. Michel Stifels, a German clergyman, spent most of his life in attempting to discover the day of judgment; and at last announced to his parishioners, that it would happen within a year. The parishioners, resolving to make the best of a bad bargain, spent their time merrily, taking no care to lay up provisions for another year; and so nice was their calculation, as at the end of the year to have not a morsel remain∣ing, either of food or of industry. The famous Jurieu has shewn great ingenuity in explaining prophecies; of which take the following in∣stance. In his book, intitled, <HI>Accomplishment of the prophecies,</HI> he demonstrates, that the beast in the Apocalypse, which held the <HI>poculum aureum plenum abominationum</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"The golden cup full of abominations."</Q></NOTE>, is the Pope; and his reason is, that the initial letters of these four Latin words compose the word <HI>papa;</HI> a very singular prophecy indeed; that is a prophecy in Latin, but in no other language. The candid reader will advert, that such prophecies as relate
<PB N="170" REF="180"/>
to our Saviour, and tend to ascertain the truth of his mission, fall not under the foregoing reason∣ing; for they do not anticipate futurity, by producing foreknowledge of future events. They were not understood till our Saviour ap∣peared among men; and then they were clearly understood as relative to him.</P>
<P>There is no end of superstition in its various modes. It was believed universally in dark times, that by certain forms and invocations, the spirits of the dead could be called upon to reveal future events. A lottery in Florence, gainful to the go∣vernment, and ruinous to the people, gives great scope to superstition. The purchaser of tickets, in order to be successful, must fast six and thirty hours, must repeat a certain number of Ave Ma∣ries and Pater Nosters, must not speak to a living creature, must not go to bed, must continue in prayer to the Virgin, and to saints, till some pro∣pitious saint appear and declare the numbers that are to be successful. The ticket-holder, fa∣tigued with fasting, praying, and expectation, falls asleep. Occupied with the thoughts he had when awake, he dreams that a saint appears, and mentions the numbers that are to be success∣ful. If he be disappointed, he is vexed at his want of memory; but trusts in the saint as an infallible oracle. Again he buys tickets, again falls asleep, again sees a vision, and again is dis∣appointed.</P>
<P>Lucky and unlucky days, which were so much relied on as even to be marked in the Greek and Roman calendars, make an appendix to prophe∣cies. The Tartars never undertake any thing of moment on a Wednesday, being held by them unlucky. The Nogayan Tartars hold every thir∣teenth year to be unlucky: they will not even wear a sword that year, believing that it would
<PB N="177" REF="181"/>
be their death; and they maintain, that none of their warriors ever returned who went upon an expedition in one of these years. They pass that time in fasting and prayer, and during it ne∣ver marry. The inhabitants of Madagascar have days fortunate and unfortunate with respect to the birth of children: they destroy without mer∣cy every child that is born on an unfortunate day.</P>
<P>I close this important article with a reflection that ought to make an impression upon every ra∣tional mind. The knowledge of future events, as far as it tends to influence our conduct, is in∣consistent with a state of trial, such as Providence has allotted to man in this life. It would deprive him of hopes and fears, and leave him nothing to deliberate upon, nor any end to prosecute. In a word, it would put an end to his activity, and reduce him to be merely a passive being. Provi∣dence therefore has wisely drawn a veil over fu∣ture events, affording us no light for prying into them but sagacity and experience.</P>
<P>These are a few of the numberless absurd opi∣nions about the conduct of Providence, that have prevailed among Christians, and still prevail a∣mong some of them. Many opinions no less ab∣surd have prevailed about speculative points. I confine myself to one or two instances; for to make a complete list would require a volume. The first I shall mention, and the most noted, is transubstantiation; which though it has not the least influence on practice, is reckoned so essen∣tial to salvation, as to be placed above every mo∣ral duty. The following text is appealed to as the sole foundation of that article of faith. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my bo∣dy.
<PB N="178" REF="182"/>
And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it: for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fa∣ther's kingdom<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">St Matthew, xxvi. 26. &amp;c.</NOTE>."</Q> That this is a meta∣phor, must strike every one: the passage cannot even bear a literal meaning, considering the fi∣nal clause; for surely the most zealous Roman believes not, that Christians are to drink new wine with their Saviour in the kingdom of hea∣ven. At the same time, it is not so much as in∣sinuated, that there was here any miraculous tran∣substantiation of the bread and wine into the bo∣dy and blood of our Saviour; nor is it insinua∣ted, that the apostles believed they were eating the slesh of their master, and drinking his blood. St. John, the favourite apostle, mentions not a word of this ceremony, which he certainly would not have omitted, had he imagined it an essential article of faith.</P>
<P>But supposing transubstantiation to be more clearly expressed in this text, than it really is; yet men of good understanding will be loth to ad∣mit a meaning that contradicts their five senses. They will reflect, that no man now living ever saw the original books of the new testament; nor are they certain, that the editions we have, are copied directly from the originals. Every remove from them is liable to errors, which may justly create a suspicion of every text that contradicts reason and common sense. Add, that the bulk of Christians have not even a copy from the ori∣ginal
<PB N="179" REF="183"/>
to build their faith upon, but only a tran∣slation into another language.</P>
<P>And this leads to what chiefly determined me to select that instance. God and nature have be∣stowed upon us the faculty of reasoning, for di∣stinguishing truth from fasehood. If by reason∣ing with candor and impartiality, we discover a proposition to be true or false, it is not in our power to remain indifferent: we must judge, and according to our judgment we must pro∣nounce. I say more, to pronounce is a duty we owe to our Maker; for to what purpose has he bestowed reason upon us, but in order to direct our belief? At the same time, we may depend on it as an intuitive truth, that God will never impose any belief on us, contradictory not only to our reason, but to our senses.</P>
<P>The following objection however will perhaps relish more with people of plain understanding. Transubstantiation is a very extraordinary mi∣racle, reiterated every day and in every corner of the earth, by priests not always remarkable either for piety or for morality. Now I demand an answer to the following plain question: To what good end or purpose is such a profusion of miracles subservient? I see none. But I disco∣ver a very bad one, if they have any influence; which is, that they accustom the Roman Catho∣lics to more cruelty and barbarity, than even the grossest savages are ever guilty of: some of them indeed devour the flesh of their enemies; but none of them, the flesh of their friends, especi∣ally their greatest friend. But to do justice to people of that religion, I am confident, that this supposed miracle has no influence whatever upon their manners: to me it appears impossible for any man seriously to believe, that the bread and wine used at the Lord's supper, is actually con∣verted
<PB N="180" REF="184"/>
into the body and blood of our Saviour. The Romish church requires the belief of tran∣substantiation; and a zealous Catholic, out of pure obedience, <HI>thinks</HI> he believes it. Convince once a man that salvation depends on belief, and he will believe any thing; that is, he will ima∣gine that he believes: <HI>Credo quia impossibile est</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A traveller describing the Virgin Mary's house at Loretto, has the following reflection. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When there are so many saints endued with such miraculous powers, so many relics, and so many impregnated wells, each of them able to cure the most danger∣ous diseases; one would wonder, that physicians could live there, or others die. But people die here as elsewhere; and even churchmen, who preach upon the miracles wrought by relics, grow sick and die like other men."</Q> It is one thing to believe, it is another thing to fancy that we believe. In the year 1666 a Jew named <HI>Sabatai Levi</HI> appeared at Smyrna, pretending to be the true Messiah, and was acknowledged to be such by many. The Grand Sig∣nior, for proof of his mission, insisted for a miracle; proposing that he should present himself as a mark to be shot at, and promising to believe that he was the Messiah, if he remained unwounded. Sabatai, declin∣ing the trial, turned Mahometan to save his life. But observe the blindness of superstition: though Sabatai was seen every day walking the streets of Constanti∣nople in the Turkish habit, the Jews insisted that the true Sabatai was taken up into heaven, leaving only behind him his shadow; and probably they most pi∣ously fancied that they believed so.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>That our first reformers, who were prone to differ from the Romish faith, should adopt this doctrine, shows the supreme influence of super∣stition. The Lutherans had not even the excuse of inattention: after serious examination, they added one absurdity more; teaching, that the
<PB N="181" REF="185"/>
bread and wine are converted into the body and blood of our Saviour, and yet remain bread and wine as at first; which is termed by them <HI>con∣substantiation.</HI> I am persuaded, that at this time not a single man of them harbours such a thought.</P>
<P>Many persons, proof against a serious argu∣ment, are sufficiently clear-sighted to discover falsehood when put in a ridiculous light. It re∣quires, I am sensible, a very delicate hand to at∣tack a grave subject with ridicule as a test of truth; and for that reason, I forbear to offer any thing of my own. But I will set before my readers some excerpts from a book of absolute authority with Roman Catholics. Though tran∣substantiation be there handled in the most seri∣ous manner, with all the ceremonies and puncti∣lios that naturally flow from it, yet to my taste, nothing can be contrived to give it a more ridi∣culous appearance. The book is the Roman Missal, from which the following is a literal translation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P REND="margQuotes">"Mass may be deficient in the matter, in the form, in the minister, or in the action. First, in the matter. If the bread be not of wheat, or if there be so great a mixture of other grain that it cannot be called wheat-bread, or if any way corrupted, it does not make a sa∣crament. If it be made with rose-water, or any other distilled water, it is doubtful whe∣ther it make a sacrament or not. Though corruption have begun, or though it be lea∣vened, it makes a sacrament, but the celebra∣tor sins grievously."</P>
<P REND="margQuotes">"If the celebrator, before consecration, ob∣serve that the host is corrupted, or is not of wheat, he must take another host: if after consecration, he must still take another and

swallow it, after which he must also swallow the first, or give it to another, or preserve it in some place with reverence. But if he have swallowed the first before observing its defects, he must nevertheless swallow also the perfect host; because the precept about the perfection of the sacrament, is of greater weight than that of taking it fasting. If the consecrated host disappear by an accident, as by wind, by a mi∣racle, or by some animal, another must be con∣secrated."</P>
<P REND="margQuotes">"If the wine be quite sour or putrid, or made of unripe grapes, or be mixed with so much water as to spoil the wine, it is no sacrament. If the wine have begun to sour or to be cor∣rupted, or be quite new, or not mixed with water, or mixed with rose-water or other dis∣tilled water, it makes a sacrament, but the ce∣lebrator sins grievously."</P>
<P REND="margQuotes">"If the priest, before consecration, observe that the materials are not proper, he must stop, if proper materials cannot be got; but after consecration, he must proceed, to avoid giv∣ing scandal. If proper materials can be pro∣cured by waiting, he must wait for them, that the sacrifice may not remain imper∣fect."</P>
<P REND="margQuotes">"Second, in form. If any of the words of consecration be omitted, or any of them be changed into words of a different meaning, it is no sacrament: if they be changed into words of the same meaning, it makes a sacrament; but the celebrator sins grievously."</P>
<P REND="margQuotes">"Third, in the minister. If he does not in∣tend to make a sacrament, but to cheat; if there be any part of the wine, or any water that he has not in his eye, and does not intend to consecrate; if he have before him eleven

wafers, and intends to consecrate only ten, not determining what ten he intends: in these cases the consecration does not hold, because intenti∣on is requisite. If he think there are ten only, and intends to consecrate all before him, they are all consecrated; therefore priests ought al∣ways to have such intention. If the priest, thinking he has but one wafer, shall, after the consecration, find two sticking together, he must take them both. And he must take off all the remains of the consecrated matter; for they all belong to the same sacrifice. If in consecrating, the intention be not actual by wandering of mind, but virtual in approaching the altar, it makes a sacrament: though priests should be careful to have intention both virtual and actual."</P>
<P REND="margQuotes">"Beside intention, the priest may be deficient in disposition of mind. If he be suspended, or degraded, or excommunicated, or under mortal sin, he makes a sacrament, but sins grievously. He may be deficient also in disposition of body. If he have not fasted from midnight, if he have tasted water, or any other drink or meat, even in the way of medicine, he cannot celebrate nor communicate. If he have taken meat or drink before midnight, even though he have not slept nor digested it, he does not sin. But on account of the perturbation of mind, which bars devotion, it is prudent to re∣frain."</P>
<P REND="margQuotes">"If any remains of meat, sticking in the mouth, be swallowed with the host, they do not pre∣vent communicating, provided they be swal∣lowed, not as meat, but as spittle. The same is to be said, if in washing the mouth a drop of water be swallowed, provided it be against our will."</P>
<P REND="margQuotes"><PB N="184" REF="188"/>
"Fourth, in the action. If any requisite be wanting, it is no sacrament; for example, if it be celebrated out of holy ground, or upon an altar not consecrated, or not covered with three napkins; if there be no wax candles; if it be not celebrated between day-break and noon; if the celebrator have not said mattins with lauds; if he omit any of the sacerdotal robes; if these robes and the napkins be not blessed by a bishop; if there be no clerk pre∣sent to serve, or one who ought not to serve, a woman for example; if there be no chalice, the cup of which is gold, or silver, or pewter; if the vestment be not of clean linen adorned with silk in the middle, and blessed by a bi∣shop; if the priest celebrate with his head co∣vered; if there be no missal present, though he have it by heart."</P>
<P REND="margQuotes">"If a gnat or spider fall into the cup after consecration, the priest must swallow it with the blood, if he can: otherwise, let him take it out, wash it with wine, burn it, and throw it with the washings into holy ground. If poison fall into the cup, the blood must be poured on tow or on a linen cloth, remain till it be dry, then be burnt, and the ashes be thrown upon holy ground.

<P REND="margQuotes">"If the blood freeze in winter, put warm cloths about the cup: if that be not sufficient, the cup in boiling water."</P>

<P>As the foregoing article has beyond intention swelled to an enormous size, I shall add but one other article, which, at the same time, shall be extremely short; and that is the creed of Athana∣sius. It is a heap of unintelligible jargon; and yet we are appointed to believe every article of it, under the pain of eternal damnation.

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>RELIGIOUS WORSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>IN the foregoing chapter are traced the gradual advances of the sense of Deity, from its im∣perfect state among savages to its maturity among
<PB N="186" REF="190"/>
enlightened nations, displaying to us one great being to whom all other beings owe their exis∣tence, who made the world, and who governs it by the most perfect laws. And our perception of Deity, arising from that sense, is fortified by an intuitive proposition, that there necessarily must exist some being who had no beginning. Consi∣dering the Deity as the author of our existence, we owe him gratitude; considering him as gover∣nor of the world, we owe him obedience: and up∣on these duties is founded the obligation we are under to worship him. Further, God made man for society, and implanted in his nature the mo∣ral sense to direct his conduct in that state. From these premises, may it not with certainly be infer∣red to be the will of God, that men should obey the dictates of the moral sense in fulfilling every duty of justice and benevolence? These moral duties, it would appear, are our chief business in this life; being enforced not only by a moral but by a religious principle.</P>
<P>Morality, as laid down in a former sketch, con∣sists of two great branches, viz. the moral sense, which unfolds our duty to man, and an active moral principle, which prompts us to perform that duty. Natural religion consists also of two great branches, viz. the sense of Deity, which unfolds our duty to our Maker, and the active principle of devotion, which prompts us to perform our duty to him. The universality of the sense of Deity proves it to be innate: the same reason proves the principle of devotion to be innate; for all men agree in worshipping superior beings, whatever difference there may be in the mode of worship.</P>
<P>Both branches of the duty we owe to God, that of worshipping him, and that of obeying his will with respect to our fellow-creatures, are
<PB N="187" REF="191"/>
summed up by the Prophet Micah in the following emphatic words. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good: and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, to love mer∣cy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"</Q> The two articles first mentioned, are moral duties re∣garding our fellow-creatures; and as to such, what is required of us by the Lord is to do our duty to others, not only as directed by the moral sense, but as being the will of our Maker, to whom we owe absolute obedience. That branch of our duty is reserved for a second section: at present we are to treat of religious worship, included in the third article, viz. the walking humbly with our God.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Religious Worship.</HEAD>
<P>THE obligation we are under to worship God, or to walk humbly with him, is, as observed above, founded on the two great princi∣ples of gratitude and obedience; both of them re∣quiring fundamentally a pure heart, and a well∣disposed mind. But heart-worship is alone not sufficient: there are over and above required ex∣ternal signs, testifying to others the sense we have of these duties, and a firm resolution to perform them. That such is the will of God, will appear as follows. The principle of devotion, like most of our other principles, partakes of the imperfec∣tion
<PB N="188" REF="192"/>
of our nature: yet however faint originally, it is capable of being greatly invigorated by culti∣vation and exercise. Private exercise is not suf∣ficient. Nature, and consequently the God of na∣ture, require public exercise or public worship: for devotion is infectious, like joy or grief<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Elements of Criticism, vol. 1. p. 180. edit. 5.</NOTE>; and by mutual communication in a numerous as∣sembly, is greatly invigorated. A regular habit of expressing publicly our gratitude and resignation, never fails to purify the mind, tending to wean it from every unlawful pursuit. This is the true motive of public worship; not what is commonly inculcated, viz. That it is required from us, as a testimony to our Maker of our obedience to his laws: God, who knows the heart needs no such testimony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arnobius <HI>(Adversus gentes, lib.</HI> 1.) accounts ratio∣nally for the worship we pay to the Deity: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Huic omnes ex more prosternimur, hunc collatis precibus adoramus, ab hoc justa, et honesta, et auditu ejus condigna, deposcimus. Non quo ipse desideret sup∣plices nos esse, aut amet substerni tot millium vene∣rationem videre. Utilitas haec nostra est, et commo∣di nostri rationem spectans. Nam quia proni ad cul∣pas, et ad libidinis varios appetitus, vitio sumus in∣firmitatis ingenitae, patitur se semper nostris cogitati∣onibus concipi: ut dum illum oramus, et mereri ejus contendimus munera, accipiamus innocentiae vo∣luntatem, et ab omni nos labe delictorum omnium amputatione purgemus."</Q>—[<HI>In English thus:</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is our custom to prostrate ourselves before him; and we ask of him such gifts only as are consistent with justice and with honour, and suitable to the character of the Being whom we adore. Not that he re∣ceives pleasure or satisfaction from the humble ve∣neration of thousands of his creatures. From this we ourselves derive benefit and advantage; for be∣ing the slaves of appetite, and prone to err from the weakness of our nature, when we address our∣selves to God in prayer, and study by our actions to merit his approbation, we gain at least the wish, and the inclination, to be virtuous."]</Q></NOTE>. I shall only add upon the general
<PB N="189" REF="193"/>
head, that lawgivers ought to avoid with caution the enforcing public worship by rewards and pu∣nishments: human laws cannot reach the heart, in which the essence of worship consists: they may indeed bring on a listless habit of wor∣ship, by separating the external act from the internal affection, than which there can be nothing more hurtful to true religion. The utmost that can be safely ventured, is to bring public worship under censorian powers, as a matter of police, for preserving good order, and for preventing bad example.</P>
<P>The religion of Confucius, professed by the <HI>literati</HI> and persons of rank in China and Ton∣quin, consists in a deep inward veneration for the God or King of heaven, and in the practice of every moral virtue. They have neither temples, nor priests, nor any settled form of external wor∣ship: every one adores the supreme Being in the manner he himself thinks best. This is indeed the most refined system of religion that ever took place among men. There is however an invin∣cible objection against it, which is, that it is not fitted for the human race: an excellent religi∣gion it would be for angels; but is far too refin∣ed, even for sages and philosophers.</P>
<P>Proceeding to deviations from the genuine wor∣ship required by our Maker, and gross deviations there have been, I begin with that sort of wor∣ship which is influenced by fear, and which for that reason is universal among savages. The A∣merican
<PB N="190" REF="194"/>
savages believe, that there are inferior deities without end, most of them prone to mis∣chief: they neglect the supreme Deity because he is good; and direct their worship to soothe the malevolent inferior deities from doing harm. The inhabitants of the Molucca islands, who be∣lieve the existence of malevolent invisible beings subordinate to the supreme benevolent Being, confine their worship to the former, in order to avert their wrath; and one branch of their worship is, to set meat before them, hoping that when the belly is full, there will be less incli∣nation to mischief. The worship of the inhabi∣tants of Java is much the same. The negroes of Benin worship the devil, as Dapper expresses it, and sacrifice to him both men and beasts. They acknowledge indeed a supreme Being, who crea∣ted the universe, and governs it by his Provi∣dence: but they regard him not; <Q REND="inline">"for,"</Q> say they, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is needless, if not impertinent, to in∣voke a being, who, good and gracious, is in∣capable of injuring or molesting us."</Q></P>
<P>The austerities and penances that are practised in almost all religions, spring from the same root. One way to please invisible malignant powers, is to make ourselves as miserable as possible. Hence the horrid penances of the Faquirs in Hindostan, who outdo in mortification whatever is reported of the ancient Christian anchorites. Some of these Faquirs continue for life in one posture: some never lie down: some have always their arms raised above their head: and some mangle their bodies with knives and scourges. The town of Jagrenate in Hindostan is frequented by pil∣grims, some of them from the distance of 300 leagues, which they travel, not by walking or riding, but by measuring the road by the length of their bodies; in which method of loco-moti∣on,
<PB N="191" REF="195"/>
some of them consume years, before they complete their pilgrimage. A religious sect made its way some centuries ago into Japan, termed <HI>Bubsdoists,</HI> from <HI>Bubs,</HI> the founder. This sect has prevailed over the ancient sect of the Sintos, chiefly by its austerity and mortifications. The spirit of this sect inspires nothing but excessive fear of the gods, who are painted prone to ven∣geance, and always offended. The people of that religion pass most of their time in torment∣ing themselves, to expiate imaginary faults; and they are treated by their priests with despotism and cruelty, that is not paralleled but by the in∣quisitors of Spain. The manners of the people are fierce, cruel, and unrelenting, such as never fail to be inspired by horrible superstition. The notion of invisible malevolent powers, formerly universal, is not to this hour eradicated, even among Christians; for which I appeal to the fastings and flagellations among Roman-Catholics, held by them to be an essential part of religion. People infected with religious horrors, are never seriously convinced, that an upright heart and sound morality make the essence of religion. The doctrine of the Jansenists, concerning re∣pentance and mortification, shows evidently, however they may deceive themselves, that they have an impression of the Deity as a malevolent being. They hold the guilt contracted by Adam's fall to be a heinous sin, which ought to be expia∣ted by acts of mortification, such as the torturing and macerating the body with painful labour, ex∣cessive abstinence, continual prayer and contem∣plation. Their penances, whether for original or voluntary sin, are carried to extravagance; and they who put an end to their lives by such severi∣ties, are termed the sacred victims of repentance, consumed by the fire of divine love. Such sui∣cides
<PB N="192" REF="196"/>
are esteemed peculiarly meritorious in the eye of Heaven; and it is thought, that their suf∣ferings cannot fail to appease the anger of the Deity. That celibacy is a state of purity and perfection, is a prevailing notion in many coun∣tries: among the Pagans, a married man was forbid to approach the altar, for some days after knowing his wife; and this ridiculous notion of pollution, contributed to introduce celibacy among the Roman-Catholic priests. The Empe∣ror Otho, <HI>anno</HI> 1218, became a signal penitent: but instead of atoning for his sins by repentance and restitution, he laid himself down to be trod under foot by the boys of his kitchen; and fre∣quently submitted to the discipline of the whip, inflicted by monks. The Emperor Charles V. toward the end of his days, was sorely depressed in spirit with fear of hell. Monks were his only companions, with whom he spent his time in chanting hymns. As an expiation for his sins, he in private disciplined himself with such severi∣ty, that his whip, found after his death, was tinged with his blood. Nor was he satisfied with these acts of mortification: timorous and illiberal solicitude still haunting him, he aimed at some∣thing extraordinary, at some new and singular act of piety, to display his zeal, and to merit the fa∣vour of Heaven. The act he fixed on was as wild as any that superstition ever suggested to a distempered brain: it was to celebrate his own obsequies. He ordered his tomb to be erected in the chapel of the monastery: his domestics marched there in a funeral procession, holding black tapers: he followed in his shroud: he was laid in his coffin with much solemnity: the ser∣vice of the dead was chanted; and he him∣self joined in the prayers offered up for his <HI>requiem,</HI> mingling his tears with those of his at∣tendants.
<PB N="193" REF="197"/>
The ceremony closed with sprinkling holy water upon the coffin; and the assistants re∣retiring, the doors of the chapel were shut. Then Charles rose out of the coffin, and stole privately to his apartment.</P>
<P>The history of ancient sacrifices is not so accu∣rate, as in every instance to ascertain upon what principle they were founded, whether upon fear, upon gratitude for favours received, or to solicit future favour. Human sacrifices undoubtedly belong to the present head: for being calculated to deprecate the wrath of a malevolent deity, they could have no other motive but fear; and indeed they are a most direful effect of that pas∣sion. It is needless to lose time in mentioning in∣stances, which are well known to those who are acquainted with ancient history. A number of them are collected in Historical Law-tracts<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Tract 1.</NOTE>: and to these I take the liberty of adding, that the Cimbrians, the Germans, the Gauls, particularly the Druids, practised human sacrifices; for which we have the authority of Julius Caesar, Strabo, and other authors. A people upon the Missisippi, named <HI>Tensas,</HI> worship the sun; and, like the Natches their neighbours, have a temple for that luminary, with a sacred fire in it, conti∣nually burning. The temple having been set on fire by thunder, was all in flames, when some French travellers saw them throw children into the fire, one after another, to appease the incensed deity. The Prophet Micah<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chap. 6.</NOTE>, in a passage partly quoted above, inveighs bitterly against such sacrifices: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Wherewith shall I come before
<PB N="194" REF="198"/>
the Lord, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt∣offerings, with calves of a year old? will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good: and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"</Q></P>
<P>The ancient Persians acknowledged Oromazes and Arimanes as their great deities, authors of good and ill to men. But I find not that Ari∣manes, the evil principle, was ever an object of any religious worship. The Gaures, who pro∣fess the ancient religion of Persia, address no wor∣ship but to one God, all-good and all-powerful.</P>
<P>Next, of worshipping the Deity in the charac∣ter of a mercenary being. Under that head come sacrifices and oblations, whether prompted by gratitude for favours received, or by self-interest to procure future favours; which, for the reason mentioned, I shall not attempt to distinguish. As the deities of early times were thought to resem∣ble men, it is not wonderful, that men endea∣voured to conciliate their favour, with such offe∣rings as were the most acceptable to themselves. It is probable, that the first sacrifices of that kind were of sweet-smelling herbs, which in the fire emitted a flavour, that might reach the nostrils of a deity, even at a distance. The burning in∣cense to their gods, was practised in Mexico and Peru; and at present is practised in the pe∣ninsula of Corea. An opportunity so favourable for making religious zeal a fund of riches to the priesthood, is seldom neglected. There was no difficulty to persuade ignorant people, that the
<PB N="195" REF="199"/>
gods could eat as well as smell: what was offered to a deity for food, being carried into the temple was understood to be devoured by him.</P>
<P>With respect to the Jewish sacrifices of burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, sin-offerings, peace-offerings, heave-offerings, and wave-offerings, these were appointed by God himself, in order to keep that stiff-necked people in daily remem∣brance of their dependence on him, and to pre∣serve them if possible from idolatry. But that untractable race did not adhere to the purity of the institution: they insensibly degenerated into the notion that their God was a mercenary being; and in that character only, was the worship of sacrifices performed to him: the offerings menti∣oned were liberally bestowed on him, not singly as a token of their dependence, but chiefly in order to avert his wrath, or to gain his favour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is no mention in ancient authors of fish be∣ing offered to the gods in sacrifice. The reason I take to be, that the most savoury food of man was reckon∣ed the most agreeable to their gods; that savages never thought of fish till land-animals became scarce; and that the matter as well as form of sacrifices were esta∣blished in practice, long before men had recourse to fish for food.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The religious notions of the Greeks were equally impure: they could not think of any means for conciliating the favour of their gods, more efficacious than gifts. Homer paints his gods as mercenary to an extreme. In the fourth book of the Iliad, Jupiter says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Of these cities, honoured the most by the soul of Jove, is sa∣cred Troy. Never stands the altar empty be∣fore me, oblations poured forth in my pre∣sence, savour that ascends the skies."</Q> Speak∣ing
<PB N="196" REF="200"/>
in the fifth book of a warrior, known after∣ward to be Diomedes, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Some god he is, some power against the Trojans enraged for vows unpaid: destructive is the wrath of the gods."</Q> Diomedes prays to Minerva, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"With thine arm ward from me the foe: a year old heifer, O Queen, shall be thine, broad-fronted, unbro∣ken, and wild: her to thee I will offer with prayer, gilding with gold her horns."</Q> Pre∣cisely of the same kind, are the offerings made by superstitious Roman Catholics to the Virgin Mary, and to saints. Electra, in the tragedy of that name, supplicates Apollo in the following terms.<Q><L>—O! hear Electra too;</L>
<L>Who, with unsparing hand, her chicest gifts</L>
<L>Hath never fail'd to lay before thy altars;</L>
<L>Accept the little All that now remains</L>
<L>For me to give.</L></Q></P>
<P>The people of Hindostan, as mentioned above, atone for their sins by austere penances; but they have no notion of presenting gifts to the Deity, nor of deprecating his wrath with the blood of animals. On the contrary, they reckon it a sin to slay any living creature; which reduces them to vegetable food. This is going too far; for the Deity could never mean to prohibit animal food, when man's chief dependence originally was upon it. The abstaining, however, from animal food, shows greater humanity in the religion of Hindostan, than of any other known country. The inhabitants of Madagascar are in a stage of religion, common among many nations, which is, the acknowledging one supreme benevolent Deity, and many malevolent inferior deities. Most of their worship is indeed addressed to the
<PB N="197" REF="201"/>
latter; but they have so far advanced before se∣veral other nations, as to offer sacrifices to the supreme Being, without employing either idols or temples.</P>
<P>Philosophy and sound sense, in polished nati∣tions, have purified religious worship, by banish∣ing the profession at least of oblations and sacrifi∣ces. The Being that made the world, governs it by laws that are inflexible, because they are the best possible; and to imagine that he can be mo∣ved by prayers, oblations, or sacrifices, to vary his plan of government, is an impious thought, degrading the Deity to a level with ourselves: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hear, O my people, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God. I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he-goat out of thy fold: for every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.

<P><PB N="199" REF="203"/>
This is a proper place for the history of idola∣try; which, as will anon appear, sprung from religious worship, corrupted by men of shallow understanding and gross conceptions, upon whom things invisible make little impression.</P>
<P>Savages, even of the lowest class, have an impression of invisible powers, though they can∣not form any distinct notion of them. But such impression is too faint for the exercise of devo∣tion. Whether inspired with love to a good be∣ing, or with fear of an ill being, savages are not at ease without some sort of visible object to ani∣mate them. A great stone served that purpose originally; a very low instrument indeed of reli∣gious worship; but not altogether whimsical, if it was introduced, which is highly probable, in the following manner. It was an early and a na∣tural custom among savages, to mark with a great stone, the place where their worthies were interred; of which we have hints every where in ancient history, particularly in the poems of Os∣sian. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Place me,"</Q> says Calmar, mortally wounded, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"at the side of a stone of remem∣brance, that future times may bear my same, and the mother of Calmar rejoice over the stone of my renown."</Q> Superstition in later times having deified these worthies, their vota∣ries, rejoicing as formerly over the stones dedi∣cated to them, held these stones to be essential in every act of religious worship performed to
<PB N="200" REF="204"/>
their new deities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frequent mention is made of such stones in the poems of Ossian. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But remember, my son, to place this sword, this bow, and this horn, within that dark and narrow house marked with one gray stone."</Q> <HI>p.</HI> 55. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whose same is in that dark-green tomb?

In the same poems we find stones made instruments of worship. The spi∣rit of Loda is introduced threatening Fingal: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fly to thy land, replied the form: receive the wind and fly. The blasts are in the hollow of my hand: the course of the storm is mine. The King of So∣ra is my son: he bends at the stone of my power."</Q> <HI>p.</HI> 200.</NOTE>. Tradition points out many stones in different parts of the world, that were used in religious worship. A large stone worship∣ped by the Pessenuntians, a people of Phrygia, under the name of <HI>Idaea mater,</HI> was, upon a so∣lemn embassy to that people, brought to Rome; it being contained in the Sybilline books, that un∣less the Romans got possession of that goddess, they never would prevail over Hannibal. And Pausanias mentions many stones in Greece, dedi∣cated to different divinities; particularly thirty square stones in Achaia, on which were engraved the names of as many gods. In another place, he mentions a very ancient statue of Venus in the island Delos, which, instead of feet, had only a square stone. This may appear a puzzling cir∣cumstance in the history of Greece, considering that all the Grecian gods were originally mortals,
<PB N="201" REF="205"/>
whom it was easy to represent by statues: but in that early period, the Greeks knew no more of statuary than the most barbarous nations. It is perhaps not easy to gather the meaning of sa∣vages, with respect to such stones: the most na∣tural conjecture is, that a great stone, dedicated to the worship of a certain deity, was considered as belonging to him. This notion of property had a double effect: the worshippers, by con∣nection of ideas, were led from the stone to the deity: and the stone tended to fix their wander∣ing thoughts. It was probably imagined, over and above, that some latent virtue communicated to the stone, made it holy or sacred. Even a∣mong enlightened people, a sort of virtue or sanctity is conceived to reside in the place of worship: why not also in a stone dedicated to a deity? The ancient Ethiopians, in their wor∣ship, introduced the figure of a serpent as a sym∣bol of the deity: two sticks laid cross represent∣ed Castor and Pollux, Roman divinities: a jave∣lin represented their god Mars; and in Tartary, formerly, the god of war was worshipped under the symbol of an old rusty sabre. The ancient Persians used consecrated fire, as an emblem of the great God. Though the negroes of Congo and Angola have images without number, they are not however idolaters in any proper sense: their belief is, that these images are only organs by which the deities signify their will to their vo∣taries.</P>
<P>If the use that was made of stones and of other symbols in religious worship, be fairly represented, it may appear strange, that the ingenious Greeks sunk down into idolatry, at the very time they were making a rapid progress in the fine arts. Their improvements in statuary, one of these arts, was the cause. They began with attempting to
<PB N="202" REF="206"/>
carve heads of men and women, representing their deified heroes; which were placed upon the stones dedicated to these divinities. In the progress of the art, statues were executed complete in every member; and at last, statues of the gods were made, expressing such dignity and majesty, as in∣sensibly to draw from beholders a degree of devo∣tion to the statues themselves. Hear Quintilian upon that subject. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"At quae Polycleto defue∣runt, Phidiae atque Alcameni dantur. Phidias tamen diis quam hominibus efficiendis melior artifex traditur: in ebore vero, longe citra aemulum, vel si nihil nisi Minervam Athenis aut Olympium in Elide Jovem fecisset, cujus pulchritudo adjecisse aliquid etiam receptae re∣ligioni videtur; adeo majestas operis deum aequavit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The deficiencies of Polycletus were made up in Phidias and Alcamenes. Phidias is reckoned to have had more skill in forming the statues of gods than of men. In works of ivory he was unrival∣led, although there had been no other proofs of his excellence than the statue of Minerva at Athens, and the Jupiter Olympius in Elis. Its beauty seems to have added to the received religi∣on; the majestic statue resembling so much the god himself."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> Here is laid a foundation for ido∣latry: let us trace its progress. Such statues as are represented by Quintilian, serve greatly to en∣slame devotion; and during a warm fit of the religious passion, the representation is lost, and the statue becomes a deity; precisely as where King Lear is represented by Garrick: the actor vanishes; and, behold! the King himself. This is not singular. Anger occasions a metamorphosis still more extraordinary: if I happen to strike my gouty toe against a stone, the violence of the pain
<PB N="203" REF="207"/>
converts the stone for a moment into a voluntary agent; and I wreak my resentment on it, as if it really were so. It is true, the image is only con∣ceived to be a deity during the fervour of devoti∣on; and when that subsides, the image falls back to its original representative state. But frequent instances of that kind, have at last the effect among illiterate people, to convert the image into a sort of permanent deity: what such people see, makes a deep impression; what they see not, little or none at all. There is another thing that concurs with eye-sight, to promote this delusion: devotion, being a vigorous principle in the human breast, will exert itself upon the meanest object, when none more noble is in view.</P>
<P>The ancient Persians held the consecrated fire to be an emblem only of the great God: but such veneration was paid to that emblem, and with so great ceremony was it treated, that the vulgar came at last to worship it as a sort of deity. The priests of the Gaures watch the consecrated fire day and night: they keep it alive with the purest wood, without bark: they touch it not with sword nor knife: they blow it not with bellows, nor with the mouth: even the priest is prohi∣bited to approach it, till his mouth be covered with fine linen, lest it be polluted with his breath: if it happen to go out, it must be re∣kindled by striking fire from flint, or by a burning glass.</P>
<P>The progress of idolatry will more clearly ap∣pear, from attending to the religion of the Greeks and Romans. The Greeks, as mentioned above, made use of stones in divine worship, long before idolatry was introduced: and we learn from Var∣ro, that for a hundred and seventy years after Numa, the Romans had no statues nor images in their temples. After statues of the gods came
<PB N="204" REF="208"/>
in fashion, they acquired by degrees more and more respect. The Greek and Roman writers, talk of divine virtue being communicated to sta∣tues; and some of the Roman writers talk famili∣arly, of the <HI>numen</HI> of a deity residing in his statue. Arnobius, in his book against the Gentiles, intro∣duces a Gentile delivering the following opinion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We do not believe, that the metal which com∣poses a statue, whether gold, or silver, or brass, is a god, But we believe, that a so∣lemn dedication brings down the god to inha∣bit his image; and it is the god only that we worship in that image."</Q> This explains the Roman ceremony, of inviting to their side the tutelar deities of towns besieged by them, termed <HI>evacatio tutelarium deorum:</HI> the Romans, cruel as they were, overflowed with superstition; and as they were averse from combating the tutelar dei∣ties even of their enemies, they endeavoured to gain these deities by large promises, and assurance of honourable treatment. As they could not hope that a statue would change its place, their notion must have been, that by this ceremony, the tute∣lar deity might be prevailed upon to withdraw its <HI>numen,</HI> and leave the statue a dead lump of matter. When Stilpo was banished by the Areopagus of Athens for affirming, that the statue in the tem∣ple of Minerva was not the goddess, but a piece of matter carved by Phidias; he surely was not condemned for saying, that the statue was made by Phidias, a fact universally known: his heresy consisted in denying that the <HI>numen</HI> of Minerva re∣sided in the statue. Augustus, having twice lost his fleet by storm, forbade Neptune to be carried in procession along with the other gods; ima∣gining he had avenged himself of Neptune, by neglecting the favourite statue in which his <HI>numen</HI> resided.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="209"/>
When saints in the Christian church were dei∣fied, even their images became objects of wor∣ship; from a fond imagination, that such wor∣ship draws down into the images, the souls of the saints they represent: which is the same doctrine that Arnobius, in the passage above mentioned, ascribes to the Gentiles; and is not widely diffe∣rent from the belief of the Pagan Tartars and Ostiacs, by and by to be mentioned. In the ele∣venth century, there was a violent dispute about images in the Greek church; many asserting, that in the images of our Saviour and of the saints, there resides an inherent sanctity, which is a pro∣per object of worship; and that Christians ought not to confine their worship to the persons re∣presented, but ought also to extend it to their images.</P>
<P>As ignorant and savage nations can form no conception of Deity, but of a being like a man, only superior in power and greatness, images are made of the Deity in several nations conformable to this conception. It is easy to make some re∣semblance of a man; but how is power and greatness to be represented? To perform this with propriety, would require a Hogarth. Savages go more bluntly to work: they endeavour to re∣present a man with many heads, and with a still greater number of hands. The northern Tartars seem to have no deities but certain statues or ima∣ges coarsely formed out of wood, and bearing some distant resemblance to the human figure. To palliate so gross an absurdity, as that a god can be fabricated by the hands of man, they ima∣gine this image to be endued with a soul: to say whence that soul came, would puzzle the wisest of them. That soul is conceived to be too ele∣vated for dwelling constantly in a piece of matter: they believe that it resides in some more honou∣rable
<PB N="206" REF="210"/>
place; and that it only visits the image or idol, when it is called down by prayers and sup∣plications. They sacrifice to this idol, by rub∣bing its mouth with the fat of fish, and by offer∣ing it the warm blood of some beast killed in hunting. The last step of the ceremony is, to honour the soul of the idol with a joyful shout, as a sort of convoy to it when it returns home. The Ostiacs have a wooden idol, termed, <HI>The Old Man of Oby,</HI> who is guardian of their fishery: it hath eyes of glass, and a head with short horns. When the ice dissolves, they crowd to this idol, requesting that he will be propitious to their fi∣shery. If unsuccessful, he is loaded with re∣proaches: if successful, he is entitled to a share of the capture. They make a feast for him, rubbing his snout with choice fat; and, when the entertainment is over, they accompany the soul of the idol a little way, beating the air with their cudgels. The Ostiacs have another idol, that is fed with milk so abundantly, as to come out on both sides of the spoon, and to fall down upon the vesture; which, however, is never washed, so little is cleanliness thought essential to religion by that people. It is indeed wonderfully absurd, to think, that invisible souls require food like hu∣man creatures; and yet the same absurdity pre∣vailed in Greece.</P>
<P>The ancient Germans, a sober and sensible people, had no notion of representing their gods by statues, nor of building temples to them. They worshipped in consecrated groves<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Tacitus de moribus Germanorum, cap. 9.</NOTE>. The Egyptians, from a just conception that an invisi∣ble being can have no resemblance to one that is
<PB N="207" REF="211"/>
visible, employed hieroglyphical figures for de∣noting metaphorically the attributes of their gods; and they employed, not only the figures of birds and beasts, but of vegetables; leeks, for example, and onions. This metaphorical adjunct to religi∣on, innocent in itself, sunk the Egyptians to the lowest degree of idolatry. As hieroglyphical fi∣gures, composed frequently of heterogeneous parts, resemble not any being human or devine; the vulgar, losing sight of the emblematic signifi∣cation, which is not readily understood but by poets and philosophers, took up with the plain fi∣gures as real divinities. How otherwise can it be accounted for, that the ox, the ape, the onion, were in Egypt worshipped as deities? But this must be understood of the vulgar only. It is scarce supposable, that the better sort of people could think so grossly; and we have the authority of Plutarch for doubting. In his chapter upon Isis and Osiris, he observes, that the Egyptians worshipped the bull, the cat, and other animals; not as divinities, but as representatives of them, like an image seen in a glass; or, as he expresses it in another part of the same chapter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"just as we see the resemblance of the sun in a drop of water."</Q> However this be, the Egyptian wor∣ship is an illustrious instance of the influence of devotion: how powerful must it be in its purity, when even in a wrong direction, it can force its way against every obstacle of common sense! And such respect was paid to these animals, if we can trust Diodorus Siculus, that in a great famine, the Egyptians ventured not to touch the sacred ani∣mals, though they were forced to devour one an∣other. The veneration paid to a cow in Hindostan arose probably from the same cause, viz. its hav∣ing been used as a symbol of the Deity. A snake of a particular kind, about a yard long, and about
<PB N="208" REF="212"/>
the thickness of a man's arm, is worshipped by the Whidans in Guinea. It has a large round head, piercing eyes, a short pointed tongue, and a smooth skin, beautifully speckled. It has a strong antipathy to all the venomous kind; in other re∣spects, innocent and tame. To kill them being a capital crime, they travel about unmolested, even into bedchambers. They occasioned, ann. 1697, a ridiculous persecution. A hog, teased by one of them, gnashed it with his tusks till it died. The priests carried their complaint to the king; and no one presuming to appear as counsel for the hogs, orders were issued for slaughtering the whole race. At once were brandished a thousand cutlasses; and the race would have been extirpated, had not the king interposed, representing to the priests, that they ought to rest satisfied with the innocent blood they had spilt. Rancour and cruelty never rage more violently, than under the mask of reli∣gion.</P>
<P>It is amazing how prone the most polished na∣tions formerly were to idolatry. The Tyrians, besieged by Alexander, chained down Hercules, their tutelar deity, to prevent him from deserting to the enemy; which is said to have been also practised in Sparta. The city of Ambracia being taken by the Romans, and every statue of their gods being carried to Rome; the Ambracians complained bitterly, that not a single divinity was left them to worship. How much more rational are the Hindostan bramins, who teach their dis∣ciples, that idols are emblems only of the Deity, intended merely to fix the attention of the po∣pulace!</P>
<P>The first statues in Greece and Tuscany, were made with wings, to signify the swift motion of the gods. These statues were so clumsy, as
<PB N="209" REF="213"/>
scarce to resemble human creatures, not to talk of a divinity. But the admirable statues exe∣cuted in later times, were imagined to resemble most accurately the deities represented by them: whence the vulgar notion, that gods have wings, and that angels have wings.</P>
<P>I proceed to what in the history of idolatry may be reckoned the second part. Statues, we have seen, were at first used as representatives only of the Deity; but came afterward to be metamorphosed into divinities. The absurdity did not stop there. People, not satisfied with the visible deities erected in temples for public worship, became fond to have private de∣ities of their own, whom they worshipped as their tutelar deities; and this practice spread so wide, as that among many nations every family had household gods cut in wood or stone. Eve∣ry family in Kamskatka has a tutelar deity in the shape of a pillar, with the head of a man, which is supposed to guard the house against malevolent spirits. They give it food daily, and anoint the head with the fat of fish. The Prophet Isaiah<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chap. 44.</NOTE> put this species of deification in a most ridi∣culous light: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He burneth part thereof in the fire: with part thereof he roasteth flesh: of the residue he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down, worshipping, and praying to it, and saith, Deliver me, for thou art my god."</Q> Multiplication could not fail to sink household-gods into a degree of contempt: expectation of good from them, might produce some cold ceremonial worship; but there could be no real devotion at heart. The Chinese man∣ner of treating their household-gods, will vouch
<PB N="210" REF="214"/>
for me. When a Chinese does not obtain what he prays for, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thou spiritual dog,"</Q> he will say, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I lodge thee well, thou art beaufully gild∣ed, treated with perfumes and burnt-offer∣ings; and yet thou with-holdest from me the necessaries of life."</Q> Sometimes they fasten a cord to the idol, and drag it through the dirt. The inhabitants of Ceylon treat their idols in the same manner. Thor, Woden, and Friga, were the great deities of the Scandinavians. They had at the same time inferior deities, who were sup∣posed to have been men translated into heaven for their good works. These they treated with very little ceremony, refusing to worship them if they were not propitious; and even punishing them with banishment; but restoring them after a time, in hopes of amendment. Domestic idols are treated by the Ostiacs not more reverently than by the people mentioned. But they have public idols, some particularly of brass, which are high∣ly reverenced: the solidity of the metal is in their imagination connected with immortality; and great regard is paid to these idols, for the knowledge and experience they must have ac∣quired in an endless course of time.</P>
<P>Saints, or tutelar deities, are sometimes not better treated among Roman Catholics, than among Pagans. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When we were in Portugal,"</Q> says Captain Brydone, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the people of Castel∣branco were so enraged at St Antonio, for suf∣fering the Spaniards to plunder their town, contrary, as they affirmed, to his express agreement with them, that they broke many of his statues to pieces; and one that had been more revered than the rest, they took the head off, and in its stead placed one of St Francis. The great St Januarius himself was in immi∣nent danger, during the last famine at Naples.
<PB N="211" REF="215"/>
They loaded him with abuse and invective; and declared point-blank, that if he did not procure them corn by such a time, he should be no longer their saint."</Q> The tutelar saint of Cattania, at the foot of Mount Etna, is St Agatha. A torrent of lava burst over the walls, and laid waste great part of that beautiful city. Where was St Agatha at this time? The peo∣ple say, that they had given her just provocation; but that she has long ago been reconciled to them, and has promised never to suffer the lava to hurt them again. At the foot of Mount Etna, a sta∣tue of a saint is placed as a memorial, for having prevented the lava from running up the mountain of Taurominum, and destroying that town; the saint having conducted the lava down a low val∣ley to the sea.</P>
<P>When a traveller once happens to deviate from the right road, there is no end of wandering. Porphyrius reports, that in Anubis, an Egyptian city, a real man was worshipped as a god; which is also asserted by Minucius Foelix, in his apolo∣gy for the Christians. A thousand writers have said, that the Tartars believe their high-priest, termed <HI>Dalai Lama,</HI> to be immortal. But that is a mistake: his death is published through the whole country; and couriers, sent even to Pekin, intimate it to the Emperor of China: his effigy, at the same time, is taken down from the portal of the great church, and that of his successor is put in its stead. The system of the metempsy∣chosis, adopted in that country, has occasioned the mistake. They believe, that the holy spirit, which animates a Dalai Lama, passes upon his death into the body of his successor. The spirit therefore is believed to be immortal, not the bo∣dy. The Dalai Lama, however, is the object of profound veneration. The Tartar princes are
<PB N="212" REF="216"/>
daily sending presents to him, and consulting him as an oracle: they even undertake a pilgrimage in order to worship him in person. In a retired part of the temple, he is shown covered with precious stones, and sitting cross-legged. They prostrate themselves before him at a distance, for they are not permitted to kiss his toe. The priests make traffic even of his excrements, which are greedily purchased at a high price, and are kept in a golden box hanging from the neck, as a charm against every misfortune. Like the cross of Jesus, or the Virgin's milk, we may believe, there never will be wanting plenty of that preci∣ous stuff to answer all demands: the priests out of charity will furnish a quota, rather than suffer votaries to depart with their money for want of goods to purchase. The person of the Japan Pope, or Ecclesiastical Emperor, is held so sa∣cred, as to make the cutting his beard, or his nails, a deadly sin. But absurd laws are never steadily executed. The beard and the nails are cut in the night-time, when the Pope is supposed to be sleeping; and what is taken away by that operation, is understood to be stolen from him, which is no impeachment upon his Holiness.</P>
<P>That the Jews were idolaters when they so∣journed in the land of Goshen, were it not pre∣sumable from their commerce with the Egypti∣ans, would however be evident from the history of Moses. Notwithstanding their miraculous deliverance from the Egyptian king, notwith∣standing the daily miracles wrought among them in the wilderness; so addicted were they to a visible deity, that, during even the momentary absence of Moses conversing with God on the mount, they fabricated a golden calf, and worshipped it as their god. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And the Lord said unto Moses, Go, get thee down: for thy people which
<PB N="213" REF="217"/>
thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I com∣manded them: they have made them a mol∣ten calf, have worshipped it, have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxxii. 7.</NOTE>."</Q> The history of the Jews shows how difficult it is to reclaim from idolatry a brutish people, addicted to superstition, and and fettered by inveterate habit. What profusi∣on of blood, to bring that obstinate and perverse people to the true religion! all in vain. The book of Judges, in particular, is full of reitera∣ted relapses, from their own invisible God, to the visible gods of other nations. And in all pro∣bability, their anxious desire for a visible king, related in the first book of Samuel, arose from their being deprived of a visible god. There was a necessity for prohibiting images<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Deuteronomy, xvi. 22.</NOTE>; which would have soon been converted into deities visi∣ble: and it was extremely prudent, to supply the want of a visible god, with endless shews and ce∣remonies; which accordingly became the capital branch of the Jewish worship.</P>
<P>It appears to me from the whole history of the Jews, that a gross people are not susceptible but of a gross religion; and without an enlightened un∣derstanding, that it is vain to think of eradicating superstition and idolatry. And after all the co∣venants made with the Jews, after all the chas∣tisements and all the miracles lavished on them, that they were not however reclaimed from the
<PB N="214" REF="218"/>
most groveling idolatry, is evident from the two golden calves fabricated by Jeroboam, saying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Kings, xii. 28.</NOTE>."</Q> The people also of Judah fell back to idol-worship un∣der Rehoboam, son of Solomon<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Kings, xiv. 23.</NOTE>. Jehu, king of the ten tribes, did not tolerate the wor∣ship of other gods<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">2 Kings, x. 25.</NOTE>; but he continued to wor∣ship the two golden calves fabricated by Jerobo∣am<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">2 Kings, x. 29.</NOTE>. Down to the days of King Hezekiah, the Jews worshipped the brazen serpent erected by Moses in the wilderness. The Jews seem in∣deed to have been a very perverse people: the many promises and threatenings announced by their prophets, and the many miracles wrought among them, had no permanent effect to restrain them from idolatry; and yet, during their cap∣tivity in Babylon, several of them submitted to be burnt alive, rather than to join in idol wor∣ship<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Daniel, chap. 3.</NOTE>. Captivity cured them radically of ido∣latry; and from that period to this day, they have not been guilty of a single relapse. Xiphilin, in his abridgement of Dion Cassius, relating their war with Pompey, many centuries after the Ba∣bylonish captivity, gives the following account of them. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Their customs are quite different from those of other nations. Beside a peculi∣ar
<PB N="215" REF="219"/>
manner of living, they acknowledge none of the common deities: they acknowledge but one, whom they worship with great venerati∣on. There never was an image in Jerusalem; because they believe their God to be invisible and ineffable. They have built him a temple of great size and beauty, remarkable in the following particular, that it is open above, without any roof."</Q></P>
<P>There lies no solid objection against images among an enlightened people, when used merely to rouse devotion. But as images tend to per∣vert the vulgar, they ought not to be admitted into churches: pictures are less liable to be mis∣apprehended; and the Ethiopians accordingly in∣dulge pictures, though they prohibit statues, in their churches. The general council of Frank∣fort permitted the use of images in churches; but strictly prohibited any worship to be addres∣sed to them. So prone however to idolatry are the low and illiterate, that the prohibition lost ground both in France and in Germany; and idol-worship became again general.</P>
<P>It is extremely probable, that the sun and moon were early held to be deities, and that they were the first visible objects of worship. It must indeed be acknowledged, that of all the different kinds of idolatry, it is the most excusable. Up∣on the sun depends health, vigour, and cheerful∣ness: during his retirement, all is dark and dis∣consolate: when he performs his majestic round, to bless his subjects, and to bestow fecundity up∣on every animal and vegetable, can a mere sa∣vage with-hold gratitude and veneration! Hear an old Pagan bard upon that subject. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O thou who rollest above, round as the shield of my fathers! Whence are thy beams, O sun, thy everlasting light? Thou comest forth in thy
<PB N="216" REF="220"/>
awful beauty, and the stars hide their faces: thou movest alone, for who can be a compa∣nion of thy course? The oaks of the moun∣tain fall: the mountains decay with years: the ocean shrinks and grows again: the moon herself is lost in heaven: but thou art for ever the same, rejoicing in the brightness of thy course. When tempests darken the world, when thunder rolls, and lightning flies, thou lookest in thy beauty from the clouds, and laughest at the storm<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ossian.</NOTE>."</Q> Worship to the sun as a real deity, was in former times univer∣sal; and prevails in many countries even at pre∣sent. The American savages worship the sun, as sovereign of the universe, known by the name of <HI>Ariskoui</HI> among the Hurons, and of <HI>Agriskoué</HI> among the Iroquois. They offer him tobacco, which they term <HI>smoking the sun:</HI> the chief man in the assembly lights the calumet, and offers it thrice to the rising sun; imploring his protection, and recommending the tribe to his care. The chief proceeds to smoke; and every one smokes in his turn. This ceremony is performed on im∣portant occasions only: less matters are reserved for their Manitou. The Missisippi people offer to the sun the first of what they take in hunting; which their commander artfully converts to his own use. The Apalachites, bordering on Flori∣da, worship the sun; but sacrifice nothing to him that has life: they hold him to be the parent of life, and think that he can take no pleasure in the destruction of any living creature: their de∣votion is exerted in perfumes and songs. The Mexicans, while a free people, presented to the
<PB N="217" REF="221"/>
sun a share of their meat and drink. The inha∣bitants of Darien believe in the sun as their god, and in the moon as his wife, paying equal adora∣tion to each. The people of Borneo worship the sun and moon as real divinities. The Samo∣ides worship both, bowing to them morning and evening in the Persian manner.</P>
<P>But if the sun and moon were the first objects of idolatry, knowledge and reflection reformed many from the error of holding these luminaries to be deities. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That original intelligence,"</Q> say the Magians, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"who is the first principle of all things, discovers himself to the mind and understanding only: but he hath placed the sun as his image in the visible universe; and the beams of that bright luminary, are but a faint copy of the glory that shines in the high∣er heavens."</Q> The Persians, as Herodotus reports, had neither temples, nor altars, nor images: for, says that author, they do not think, like the Greeks, that there is any resem∣blance between gods and men. The Gaures, who to this day profess the ancient religion of Persia, celebrate divine worship before the sa∣cred fire, and turn with peculiar veneration to∣ward the rising sun, as the representative of God; but they adore neither the sun, nor the sacred fire. They are professed enemies to every image of the Deity cut with hands: and hence the ha∣vock made by the ancient Persians, upon the sta∣tues and temples of The Grecian gods. Such sublimity of thought was above the reach of other uninspired nations, excepting only the Hin∣dows and Chinese.</P>
<P>I close the history of idolatry with a brief re∣capitulation of the outlines. Admitting the sun and moon to have been the first objects of idola∣try, yet as Polytheism was once universal, they
<PB N="218" REF="222"/>
make only two of the many gods that were eve∣ry where worshipped. We have seen, that the sacred fire was employed in the worship of the sun, and that images were employed in the worship of other deities. Images were originally used for the sole purpose of animating devotion: such was their use in Persia and Hindostan; and such was their use in every country among philo∣sophers. The Emperor Julian, in an epistle to Theodore concerning the images of the gods says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We believe not that these images are gods: we only use them in worshipping the gods."</Q> In the progress toward idolatry, the next step is, to imagine, that a deity loves his image, that he makes it his residence, or at least communicates some virtue to it. The last step is, to imagine the image itself to be a deity; which gained ground imperceptibly as statuary advanced to∣ward perfection. It would be incredible that men of sense should ever suffer themselves to be im∣pressed with so wild a delusion, were it not the overbearing influence of religious superstition. <HI>Credo quia impossible est,</HI> is applicable to idolatry as well as to transubstantiation. The worship∣ping the sun and moon as deities, is idolatry in the strictest sense. With respect to images, the first step of the progress is not idolatry: the next is mixed idolatry: and the last is rank idolatry.</P>
<P>So much upon idolatry. I proceed to what approaches the nearest to it, which is worship addressed to deified mortals. The ancient gods were exalted so little above men, that it was no hard task for the imagination to place in heaven, men who had made a figure on earth. The Grecian heaven was entirely peopled with such men, as well as that of many other nations. Men are deified every day by the Romish church, under the denomination of saints: per∣sons
<PB N="219" REF="223"/>
are frequently selected for that honour who scarce deserved a place on earth, and some who never had a place there. The Roman Catholics copy the Pagans, in worshipping these subordi∣nate divinities by prayers and oblations: and they are well rewarded, by being taken under protec∣tion of these saints in quality of tutelar deities. One branch of the office bestowed on these saints, is to explain the wants of their votaries to the King of heaven, and to supplicate for them. The mediatorial office prevails with respect to earthly potentates, as well as heavenly: being struck with awe and timidity in approaching those exalted above us, we naturally take hold of some intermediate person to solicit for us. In ap∣proaching the Almighty, the mind, sinking down into humility and profound veneration, stops short, relying upon some friend in heaven to in∣tercede in its behalf. Temples among the Co∣chin-Chinese are constructed with a deep and dark niche, which is their <HI>sanctum sanctorum.</HI> They hold, that no representation, whether by painting or sculpture, can be made of God, who is invisible. The niche denotes his incomprehen∣sibility; and the good men placed by them in heaven, are believed to be their intercessors at the throne of grace. The prayers of the Chingu∣lese are seldom directed to the supreme being, but to his vicegerents. Intercessors, at the same time, contribute to the ease of their votaries: a Roman Catholic need not assume a very high tone in addressing a tutelar saint chosen by him∣self.</P>
<P>False notions of Providence have prompted groveling mortals to put confidence in mediators and intercessors of a still lower class, viz. living mortals, who by idle austerities have acquired a reputation for holiness. Take the following in∣stance,
<PB N="220" REF="224"/>
the strongest of the kind that can be fi∣gured. Louis XI. of France, sensible of the approach of death, sent for a hermit of Calabria, named <HI>Francisco Martarillo;</HI> and throwing him∣self at the hermit's feet in a flood of tears, en∣treated him to intercede with God, that his life might be prolonged; as if the voice of a Cala∣brian friar, says Voltaire, could alter the course of Providence, by preserving a weak and per∣verse soul in a worn-out body.</P>
<P>Having discussed the persons that are the ob∣jects of worship, the next step in order is, to take under view the forms and ceremonies em∣ployed in religious worship. Forms are necessa∣ry where-ever a number of persons join in one operation: they are essential in an army, and lit∣tle less essential at public worship. The use of ceremonies is to excite devotion: but to pre∣serve a just medium, requires great delicacy of taste; for though ceremonies are necessary at public worship to prevent languor, yet superflui∣ty of ceremonies quenches devotion, by occupy∣ing the mind too much upon externals. The Ro∣man-Catholic worship is crowded with ceremo∣nies: it resembles the Italian opera, which is all sound, and no sentiment. The Presbyterian form of worship is too naked: it is proper for philosophers more than for the populace. This is fundamentally the cause of the numerous secessi∣ons from the church of Scotland that have made a figure of late: people dislike the established forms, when they find less comfort in public worship than is expected; and without being sensible of the real cause, they chuse pastors for themselves, who supply the want of ceremonies by loud speaking, with much external fervor and devotion.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="225"/>
The frequent ablutions or washings among the Mahometans and others, as acts of devotion, show the influence that the slightest resemblances have on the ignorant. Because purification, in several languages, is a term applicable to the mind as well as to the body, shallow thinkers, misled by the double meaning, imagine that the mind, like the body, is purified by water.</P>
<P>The sect of Ali use the Alcoran translated into the Persian language, which is their native tongue. The sect of Omar esteem this to be a gross im∣piety; being persuaded, that the Alcoran was written in Arabic, by the Angel Gabriel, at the command of God himself. The Roman Catho∣lics are not then the only people who profess to speak nonsense to God Almighty; or, which is the same, who profess to pray in an unknown tongue.</P>
<P>At meals, the ancients poured out some wine as a libation to the gods: Christians pronounce a short prayer, termed a <HI>grace.</HI></P>
<P>The gross notion of Deity entertained by the ancients, is exemplified in their worshipping and sacrificing on high places; in order, as they thought, to be more within sight. Jupiter in Homer praises Hector for sacrificing to him fre∣quently upon the top of Ida; and Strabo observes, that the Persians, who used neither images nor altars, sacrificed to the gods in high places. Ba∣lak carried Balaam the prophet to the top of Pis∣gah, and other mountains, to sacrifice there, and to curse Israel. The votaries of Baal always worshipped in high places. Even the sage Taci∣tus was infected with that absurdity. Speaking of certain high mountains where the gods were worshipped, he expresses himself thus: <HI>Maxime</HI>
<PB N="222" REF="226"/>

<P>Ceremonies that tend to unhinge morality, be∣long more properly to the following section, treating of the connection between religion and morality.</P>
<P>It is now full time to take under consideration an objection to the sense of Deity hinted above, ar∣guing from the gross conceptions of deity among many nations, that this sense cannot be innate. The objection is not indeed stated in the follow∣ing passage, borrowed from a justly celebrated author; but as it may be implied, the passage shall be fairly transcribed. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The universal pro∣pensity to believe invisible intelligent power, being a general attendant on human nature, if not an original instinct, may be considered as a kind of stamp which the Deity has set upon his work; and nothing surely can more dignify mankind, than to be the only earthly being who bears the stamp or image of the universal Creator. But consult this image as it commonly is in popular religions: how is the Deity disfigured! what caprice, ab∣surdity, and immorality, are attributed to him<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Natural History of Religion.</NOTE>!"</Q> A satisfactory answer to the objecti∣on implied in this passage, will occur, upon re∣collecting the progress of men and nations from infancy to maturity. Our external senses, neces∣sary for self-preservation, soon arrive at perfec∣tion: the more refined senses of propriety, of right and wrong, of Deity, of being accountable
<PB N="223" REF="227"/>
creatures, and many others of the same kind, are of slower growth: the sense of right and wrong in particular, and the sense of Deity, seldom reach perfection, but by good education and much study. If such be the case among en∣lightened nations, what is to be expected from sa∣vages who are in the lowest stage of understand∣ing? To a savage of New Holland, whose sense of deity is extremely obscure, one may talk with∣out end of a being who created the world, and who governs it by wise laws; but in vain; for the savage will be never the wiser. The same savage hath also a glimmering of the moral sense, as all men have; and yet in vain will you dis∣course to him of approbation and disapprobation, of merit and demerit: of these terms he has no clear conception. Hence the endless aberrations of rude and barbarous nations, from pure religion as well as from pure morality. Of the latter there are many instances collected in the prece∣ding tract; and of the former, instances still more plentiful in the present tract. The sense of deity in dark times has indeed been strangely dis∣torted by certain biasses and passions that enslave the rude and illiterate: but these yield gradually to the rational faculty as it ripens, and at last leave religion free to sound philosophy. Then it is that men, listening to the innate sense of deity purified from every bias, acquire a clear convic∣tion of one supreme Deity who made and go∣verns the world.</P>
<P>The foregoing objection then, impartially con∣sidered, weighs not against the sense of deity more than against the moral sense. If it have weight, it resolves into a complaint against Providence for the weakness of the sense of deity in rude and illiterate nations. If such complaint be solidly founded, it pierces extremely deep: why have
<PB N="224" REF="228"/>
not all nations, even in their nascent state, the sense of deity, and the moral sense, in purity and perfection? why do they not possess all the arts of life without necessity of culture or experience? why are we born poor and helpless infants, in∣stead of being produced complete in every mem∣ber, internal and external, as Adam and Eve were? The plan of Providence is far above the reach of our weak criticisms. I shall only observe, that as, with respect to individuals, there is a progress from infancy to maturity; so there is a similar progress in every nation, from its savage state to its maturity in arts and scien∣ces. A child that has just conceptions of the Deity and of his attributes, would be a great miracle; and would not such knowledge in a sa∣vage be equally so? Nor can I discover what benefit a child or a savage could reap from such knowledge; provided it remained a child or a sa∣vage in every other respect. The genuine fruits of religion, are gratitude to the Author of our be∣ing, veneration to him as the supreme Being, ab∣solute resignation to the established laws of his Providence, and chearful performance of every duty: but a child has not the slightest idea of gratitude nor of veneration, and very little of moral duties; and a savage, with respect to these, is not much superior to a child. The formation and government of the world, as far as we know, are excellent: we have great reason to presume the same with respect to what we do not know; and every good man will rest satisfied with the following reflection, That we should have been men from the hour of our birth, complete in every part, had it been conformable to the sys∣tem of unerring Providence.</P>

<HEAD>Morality considered as a branch of duty to our Maker.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING travelled long on a rough road, not a little fatiguing, the agreeable part lies before us; which is, to treat of morality as a branch of religion. It was that subject which induced me to undertake the history of natural religion; a subject that will afford salutary in∣struction, and will inspire true piety, if instruc∣tion can produce that effect.</P>
<P>Bayle starts a question, Whether a people may not be happy in society, and be qualified for good government, upon principles of morality singly, without any sense of religion? The question is ingenious, and may give opportunity for subtile reasoning; but it is useless, because the fact supposed cannot happen. The principles of morality and of religion are equally rooted in our nature: they are indeed weak in children and in savages; but they grow up together, and ad∣vance toward maturity with equal steps. Where∣ever the moral sense is in perfection, a sense of religion cannot be wanting; and if a man who has no sense of religion, live decently in society, he is more indebted for his conduct to good tem∣per than to sound morals.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="230"/>
We have the authority of the Prophet Micah, formerly quoted, for holding, that religion, or, in other words, our duty to God, consists in do∣ing justice, in loving mercy, and in walking hum∣bly with him. The last is the foundation of re∣ligious worship, discussed in the foregoing section: the two former belong to the present head. And if we have gratitude to our Maker and Benefac∣tor, if we owe implicit obedience to his will as our rightful sovereign, we ought not to separate the worship we owe to him, from justice and benevolence to our fellow-creatures; for to be unjust to them, to be cruel or hard-hearted, is a transgression of his will, no less gross than a total neglect of religious worship. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Master, which is the great commandment in the law?

<P>Morality is thus included in religion. Some nations, however, leave not this proposition to reasoning or conviction, but ingross many moral duties in their religious creed. In the 67th chap∣ter of the Sadder, a lie is declared to be a great sin, and is discharged even where it tends to bring about good. So much purer is the morality of the ancient Persians than of the present Jusuits. The religion of the people of Pegu, inculcates charity, forbids to kill, to steal, or to injure others. At∣tend to the consequence: that people, fierce ori∣ginally, have become humane and compassionate. In a sacred book of the ancient Persians, it is written, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If you incline to be a saint, give good education to your children; for their virtuous actions will be imputed to you."</Q> The people of Japan pay great respect to their parents; it being an article in their creed, That those who fail
<PB N="229" REF="233"/>
in duty to their parents, will be punished by the gods. In these two instances, religion tends greatly to connect parents and children in the most intimate tie of cordial affection. The reverence the Chinese have for their ancestors, and the ce∣remonies performed annually at their tombs, tend to keep them at home, and prevent their wander∣ing into foreign countries.</P>
<P>Superstitious rites in some religions, are suc∣cessfully employed to enforce certain moral du∣ties. The Romans commonly made their solemn covenants in the capitol, before the statue of Ju∣piter; by which solemnity he was understood to guarantee the covenant, ready to pour out venge∣ance upon the transgressor. The Burates, a people in Grand Tartary, have a custom, which is, to de∣mand an oath upon a mountain, held to be sacred. They are firmly persuaded, that the person who swears a falsehood, will not come down alive. The Essenes, a Jewish sect, bound themselves by a solemn oath, to shun unlawful gain, to be faith∣ful to their promises, not to lie, and never to harm any one. In Cochin-China, the souls of those who have been eminent for arts or arms, are worshipped. Their statues are placed in the tem∣ples; and the size of a statue is proportioned to the merit of the person represented. If that custom be executed with candour, there can∣not be a nobler incitement to public spirit. The Egyptians did not reach the thought of honouring virtue after death; but they dis∣honoured vice, by prohibiting it from the Elysian fields.</P>
<P>The salutary influence of religion on morality, is not confined to pure religion, whether by its connection with morality in general, or by incul∣cating particular moral duties. There are many religious doctrines, doubtful or perhaps erroneous,
<PB N="230" REF="234"/>
that contribute also to enforce morality. Some followers of Confucius ascribe immortality to the souls only of the just; and believe that the souls of the wicked perish with their bodies. In the second chapter of the Sadder, it is written, that a man whose good works are more numerous than his sins, will go to paradise; otherwise that he will be thrust into hell, there to remain for ever. It adds, that a bridge erected over the great abyss where hell is situated, leads from this earth to pa∣radise; that upon the bridge there stands an angel, who weighs in a balance the merits of the passen∣gers; that the passenger whose good works are found light in the balance, is thrown over the bridge into hell; but that the passenger whose good works preponderate, proceeds in his journey to paradise, where there is a glorious city, gar∣dens, rivers, and beautiful virgins, whose looks are a perpetual feast, but who must not be en∣joyed. In the fourth chapter of the Sadder, good works are zealously recommended in the following parable. Zeradusht, or Zoroaster, being in com∣pany with God, saw a man in hell who wanted his right foot. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh my Creator," said Zoro∣aster, who is that man who wants the right foot? God answered, He was the king of thirty-three cities, reigned many years, but never did any good, except once, when, seeing a sheep tyed where it could not reach its food, he with his right foot pushed the food to it; upon which account, that foot was saved from hell."</Q> In Japan, those of the Sinto religion be∣lieve, that the souls of good men are translated to a place of happiness, next to the habitation of their gods. But they admit no place of torment; nor have they any notion of a devil, but what animates the fox, a very mischievous animal in that country. What then becomes of the souls
<PB N="231" REF="235"/>
of ill men? Being denied entrance into heaven, they wander about to expiate their sins. Those of the Bubsdo religion believe, that in the other world, there is a place of misery as well as of hap∣piness. Of the latter, there are different degrees, for different degrees of virtue; and yet, far from envying the happier lot of others, every inhabi∣tant is perfectly satisfied with his own. There are also different degrees of misery; for justice requires, that every man be punished according to the nature and number of his sins. <HI>Jemma O</HI> is the severe judge of the wicked: their vices ap∣pear to him in all their horror, by means of a mirror, named <HI>the mirror of knowledge.</HI> When souls have expiated their sins, after suffering long in the prison of darkness, they are sent back into the world, to animate serpents, toads, and such vile animals as resembled them in their former existence. From these they pass into the bodies of more innocent animals; and at last are again suffered to enter human bodies; after the disso∣lution of which, they run the same course of hap∣piness or misery as at first. The people of Benin, in Africa, believe a man's shadow to be a real being, that gives testimony after death for or against him; and that he accordingly is made happy or miserable in another world. A religi∣ous belief in ancient Greece, that the souls of those who are left above ground without rites, have no access to Elysium, tended to promote humanity; for those who are careful of the dead, will not be altogether indifferent about the living.</P>
<P>Immense are the blessings that men in society reap, from the union of pure religion with sound morality: but however immense, I boldly affirm, that they scarce counterbalance the manifold evils that society has suffered from impure religion,
<PB N="232" REF="236"/>
indulging and even encouraging gross immorali∣ties. A few of the most glaring instances shall be selected. The first I shall mention is, the holding religion to consist in the belief of points purely speculative, such as have no relation to good works. The natural effect of that doctrine is, to divorce religion from morality, in manifest contradiction to the will of God. What avails it, for example, to the glory of God, or to the hap∣piness of mankind, whether the conception of the Virgin Mary was maculate or immaculate? The following few instances, taken out of a large heap, are controversies of that kind, which mi∣serably afflicted the Christian church for ages, and engendered the bitterest enmity, raging with destruction and slaughter among brethren of the same religion. In the fifth century, it was the employment of more than one general council, to determine, whether <HI>the mother of God,</HI> or <HI>the mother of Christ,</HI> is the proper epithet of the Virgin Mary. In the sixth century, a bitter con∣troversy arose, whether Christ's body was corrup∣tible. In the seventh century, Christians were divided about the volition of Christ, whether he had one or two Wills, and how his Will operated. In the eighth and ninth centuries, the Greek and Latin churches divided about the Holy Ghost, whether he proceeded from the Father and Son, or only from the Father. In the eleventh century, there arose a warm contest between the Greek and Latin churches, about using unleavened bread in the eucharist. In the fourteenth century, it was controverted between Pope John XXII. and the divines of his time, whether souls in their inter∣mediate state see God, or only the human nature of Christ. Franciscans have suffered death in multitudes about the form of their hood. It was disputed between the Dominicans and Franciscans,
<PB N="233" REF="237"/>
whether Christ had any property. The Pope pronounced the negative proposition to be a pesti∣lential and blasphemous doctrine, subversive of Catholic faith. Many councils were held at Con∣stantinople, to determine what sort of light it was that the disciples saw on Mount Tabor: it was solemnly pronounced, to be the eternal light with which God is encircled; and which may be term∣ed his energy or operation, but is distinct from his nature and essence. A heap of propositions in the creed of St Athanasius, as far as intelligible, are merely speculative, such as may be adopted or rejected, without the least danger to religion, or to morality; and yet we are commanded to be∣lieve every one of them, under the pain of eter∣nal damnation. An endless number of such pro∣positions, adopted by the Romish church, clearly evince, that Christianity was in that church held to consist entirely in belief, without any regard to good works<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The great weight that was laid upon orthodoxy, ap∣pears from a triumphal arch erected over the tomb of Charlemagne, upon which was the following inscription: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here lies the body of Charles, a great and orthodox emperor."</Q></NOTE>. Whether the Alcoran was eter∣nal, or whether it was created, is a dispute that has occasioned much effusion of Mahometan blood. The Calif Mamoun, with many doctors, held it to have been created; but the greater number insisted, that being the word of God, it must like him be eternal. This opinion is em∣braced by the present Mahometants, who hold all who deny it to be infidels. There is among men great uniformity of opinion in matters of impor∣tance. Religious differences are generally about trifles, where liberty ought to be indulged with∣out
<PB N="234" REF="238"/>
reserve<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Elements of Criticism, vol. 2. p. 493. edit. 5.</NOTE>; and yet upon these trifles, are founded the bitterest enmities. It ought therefore to be a fundamental law in every church, to abstain from loading its creed with articles that are not essential; for such articles tend to era∣dicate brotherly love, and to convert into bit∣ter enemies, men who are fundamentally of the same faith.</P>
<P>In the next place shall be mentioned, certain articles of faith that tend to sap the very founda∣tion of one or other moral duty. What, for ex∣ample, can more effectually promote cruelty, than the creed of the Idaans, a people in the island of Borneo, That every person they put to death must attend them as a slave in the other world? This belief makes them prone to war, and occasions assassinations without end. Accor∣ding to the creed of the savages in Canada, the killing and burning enemies are what chiefly en∣title them to be happy in another world, and that he who destroys the greatest number, will be the most happy. At the same time, they have no notion of greater happiness there, than plenty of game, great abundance of all things without la∣bour, and full gratification of every sensual ap∣petite. The Scandinavians had no notion of greater bliss in another world, than to drink beer out of the skull of an enemy, in the hall of Wo∣den, their tutelar deity: can hatred and revenge in this world be more honourably rewarded? The doctrine of tutelar deities is equally produc∣tive of hatred and revenge: relying on a superi∣or power who espouses all my quarrels, I put no bounds to my resentment, and every moral duty in opposition is trampled under foot. The
<PB N="235" REF="239"/>
following creed of the inhabitants of the Marian or Ladrone islands, is a great encouragement to cowardice. Heaven, according to that creed, is a region under the earth, filled with cocoa-trees, sugar-canes, and variety of other delicious fruits. Hell is a vast furnace, constantly red hot. Their condition in the other world depends not on good or bad actions, but on the manner of their death. Those who die a natural death, go straight to heaven: they may sin freely, if they can but se∣cure their persons against violence. But war and bloodshed are their aversion, because those who suffer a violent death go straight to hell. In ma∣ny ancient nations, a goddess was worshipped, whose province it was to promote animal love without regard to matrimony. That goddess was in Greece termed <HI>Aphrodité,</HI> in Rome <HI>Venus,</HI> and in Babylon <HI>Militta.</HI> To her was sacrificed, in some countries, the virginity of young women; which, it was believed, did secure their chastity for ever after. Justin mentions a custom in the island of Cyprus, of sending young women at stated times to the sea-shore; where they prosti∣tuted themselves as a tribute to Venus, that they might be chaste the rest of their lives. His words are, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pro reliqua pudicitiae libamenta Veneri soluturas<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lib. 18. cap. 5.</NOTE>."</Q> In other nations, a small number only were prostituted, in order to secure to the remainder, a chaste and regular life. This explains a custom among the Babylonians, which, far from being thought a religious act, is held as a proof of abandoned debauchery. The custom was, That every woman once in her life, should prostitute herself in the temple of the goddess Mylitta. Herodotus reports, that there∣by
<PB N="236" REF="240"/>
they became proof against all temptation. And Aelian observes the same of the Lydian la∣dies. <HI>Credat Judaeus Apella.</HI> Margaret Poretta, who in the fourteenth century made a figure among the Beguines, preached a doctrine not a little favourable to incontinence. She undertook to demonstrate, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the soul, when absorbed in the love of God, is free from the restraint of law, and may freely gratify every natural appetite, without contracting guilt;"</Q> a cordial doctrine for a lady of pleasure. That crazy person, instead of being laughed at, was burnt alive at Paris. In the fifteenth century, a sect termed <HI>brethren and sisters of the free spirit,</HI> held, That modesty is a mark of inhering corruption; and that those only are perfect, who can behold nakedness without emotion. These fanatics ap∣peared at public worship, without the least co∣vering. Many tenets professed by the Jesuits, open a door to every immorality. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Persons truly wicked, and void of the love of God, may expect eternal life in heaven; provided only they be impressed with fear of divine an∣ger, and avoid heinous crimes through the dread of future punishment."</Q> Again, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Per∣sons may transgress with safety, who have a probable reason for transgressing, such as any plausible argument. A judge, for example, may decide for the least probable side of a question, and even against his own opinion, provided he be supported by any tolerable au∣thority."</Q> Again, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Actions intrinsically evil, and contrary to divine law, may however be innocently performed, by those who can join, even ideally, a good end to the performance. For example, an ecclesiastic may safely com∣mit simony, by purchasing a benefice, if to the unlawful act, he join the innocent purpose
<PB N="237" REF="241"/>
of procuring to himself a subsistence. A man who runs another through the body for a slight affront, renders the action lawful, if his mo∣tive be honour, not revenge."</Q> A famous Je∣suit taught, that a young man may wish the death of his father, and even rejoice at his death, pro∣vided the wish proceed, not from hatred, but from fondness of his father's estate. And ano∣ther Jesuit has had the effrontery to maintain, that a monk may lawfully assassinate a calumnia∣tor, who threatens to charge his order with scan∣dalous practices.</P>
<P>A doctrine that strikes at the root of every moral duty, as well as of religion itself, is, That God will accept of a composition for sin; a doc∣trine that prevailed universally during the days of ignorance. Compositions for crimes were coun∣tenanced by law in every country<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Historical law tracts, tract 1.</NOTE>; and men, prone to indulge their passions, flattered them∣selves, that they might compound with God for sinning against him, as with their neighbours for injuring them. Those who have no notion of any motive but interest, naturally think it to be equally powerful with the Deity. An opinion prevailed universally in the Christian church, from the eighth century down to the Reforma∣tion, that liberal donations to God, to a saint, to the church, would procure pardon even for the grossest sins. During that period, the build∣ing churches and monasteries was in high vogue. This absurd or rather impious doctrine, proved a plentiful harvest of wealth to the clergy; for the great and opulent, who are commonly the boldest sinners, have the greatest ability to com∣pound for their sins. There needs nothing but such an opinion, to annihilate every duty, whe∣ther
<PB N="238" REF="242"/>
moral or religious; for what wicked man will think either of restitution or of reformation, who can purchase a pardon from Heaven with so little trouble? Louis XI. of France was remark∣ably superstitious, even in a superstitious age. To ingratiate himself with the Virgin Mary, he surrendered to her the county of Boulogne with great solemnity. Voltaire remarks, that godli∣ness consists, not in making the Virgin a Coun∣tess, but in abstaining from sin. Composition for sins is a doctrine of the church of Rome, boldly professed without disguise. A book of rates, published by authority of the Pope, contains sta∣ted prices for absolutions, not excepting the most heinous sins that men are capable to commit. So true is the observation of Aeneas Silvius, after∣ward Pope Paul II. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nihil est quod absque argento Romana curia det: ipsa manuum im∣positio, et Spiritus Sancti dona, venduntur; nec peccatorum venia nisi nummatis impen∣ditur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There is nothing to be obtained from the court of Rome, but by the force of money: even the ceremony of consecration, and the gifts of the Holy Ghost, are sold; and the remission of sins is bestowed only on those who can pay for it."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> Of all the immoral atonements for sin, human sacrifices are the most brutal; devi∣ating no less from the purity of religion, than from the fundamental principles of morality. They wore out of use as kindly affections pre∣vailed; and will never again be restored, unless we fall back to the savage manners of our forefa∣thers. Composition for crimes, once universal, is now banished from every enlightened nation. Composition for sins, was once equally univer∣sal; and I wish it could be said, that there are
<PB N="239" REF="243"/>
now no remains of that poisonous opinion among Christians: the practice of the church of Rome will not permit it to be said. Were men deeply convinced, as they ought to be, that sincere re∣pentance and reformation of manners are the on∣ly means for obtaining pardon, they would never dream of making bargains with the Almighty, and of compounding with him for their sins.</P>
<P>In the practice of religion, the laying too great weight on forms, ceremonies, and other external arbitrary acts, has an unhappy tendency on mo∣rality. That error has infected every religion. The Sadder, the Bible of the Gaures, prohibits calumny and detraction, lying, stealing, adulte∣ry, and fornication. It however enervates mo∣rality and religion, by placing many trifling acts on a level with the most important duties. It en∣joins the destruction of five kinds of reptiles, frogs, mice, ants, serpents, and flies that sting. It teaches, that to walk barefoot profanes the ground. Great regard for water is enjoined: it must not be used during the night; and when set upon the fire, a third part of the pot must be empty, to prevent boiling over. The bra∣mins have wofully degenerated from their origi∣nal institutions, thinking at present, that religion consists in forms and ceremonies. As soon as an infant is born, the word <HI>Oum</HI> must be pronounc∣ed over it; otherwise it will be eternally misera∣ble: its tongue must be rubbed with consecrated meal: the third day of the moon, it must be car∣ried into open air, with its head to the north. The inhabitants of Formosa believe in hell; but it is only for punishing those who fail to go naked in certain seasons, or who wear cotton instead of silk. In the time of Ghenhizcan, it was held in Tartary a mortal sin, to put a knife into the fire, to whip a horse with his bridle, or to break one
<PB N="240" REF="244"/>
bone with another; and yet these pious Tartars held treachery, robbery, murder, to be no sins. A faction in Aegina, a Greek commonwealth, treacherously assassinated seven hundred of their fellow-citizens. They cut off the hands of a miserable fugitive, who had laid hold of the altar for protection, in order to murder him without the precincts of the temple. Their trea∣cherous assassinations made no impression: but though they refrained from murder in the temple, yet by profaning it with blood, says Herodotus, they offended the gods, and contracted inexpia∣ble guilt. Would one believe, that a tribunal was established by Charlemagne more horrible than the inquisition itself? It was established in Westphalia, to punish with death every Saxon who eat meat in lent. The same law was esta∣blished in Flanders and in French-county, the be∣ginning of the seventeenth century.</P>
<P>Listen to a celebrated writer upon that poiso∣nous conceit. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is certain, that in every reli∣gion, however sublime, many of the votaries, perhaps the greatest number, will still seek the divine favour, not by virtue and good mo∣rals, which alone can be acceptable to a per∣fect being, but either by frivolous observan∣ces, by intemperate zeal, by rapturous ecsta∣sies, or by the belief of mysterious and ab∣surd opinions. When the old Romans were attacked with a pestilence, they never ascrib∣ed their sufferings to their vices, or dreamed of repentance and amendment. They never thought that they were the general robbers of the world, whose ambition and avarice made desolate the earth, and reduced opulent nati∣ons to want and beggary. They only created a dictator in order to drive a nail into a door; and by that means they thought that they had
<PB N="241" REF="245"/>
sufficiently appeased their incensed deity<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Natural History of Religion, by David Hume, Esquire.</NOTE>."</Q> Thus, gradually, the essentials of religion wear out of mind, by the attention given to forms and ceremonies: these intercept and exhaust the whole stock of devotion, which ought to be re∣served for the higher exercises of religion. The neglect or transgression of mere punctilios, are punished as heinous sins; while sins really hei∣nous are suffered to pass with impunity. The Jews exalted the keeping their sabbath holy, above every other duty; and it was the general belief, that the strict observance of that day was alone sufficient to atone for every sin. The command of resting that day, was taken so lite∣rally, that they would not on that day defend themselves even against an assassin. Ptolomy, son of Lagus, entered Jerusalem on the Jewish sabbath, in a hostile manner without resistance. Nor did experience open the eyes of that foolish people. Xiphilin, relating the siege of Jerusa∣lem by Pompey, says, that if the Jews had not rested on the sabbath, Pompey would not have been successful. Every Saturday he renewed his bat∣teries: and having on that day made a breach, he marched into the town without opposition. One cannot help smiling at an Amsterdam Jew, who had no check of conscience, for breaking open a house, and carrying off money; and yet being stopped in his flight by the sabbath before he got out of the territory, he most piously rest∣ed, till he was apprehended, and led to the gal∣lows. Nor are the Jews to this day cured of that frenzy. In some late accountsfrom Constantino∣ple, a fire broke out in a Jew's house on Satur∣day:
<PB N="242" REF="246"/>
rather than profane the sabbath, he suffe∣red the flames to spread, which occasioned the destruction of five hundred houses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together. And Jesus laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.

The Lord then said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering? and ought not this woman, whom Satan hath bound, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath-day?"</Q> <HI>Luke,</HI> xiii. 11.</NOTE>. We laugh at the Jews, and we have reason; and yet there are many well-meaning Protestants, who lay the whole of religion upon punctual attendance at public worship. Are the Roman Catholics less superstitious with respect to the place of worship, than the Jews are with respect to the day of wor∣ship? In the year 1670, some Arabians, watch∣ing an opportunity, got into the town of Dieu when the gates were opened in the morning. They might easily have been expelled by the ca∣non of the citadel; but the Portuguese governor was obliged to look on without firing a gun, be∣ing threatened with excommunication, if the least mischief should be done to any of the chur∣ches. The only doctrines inculcated from the Romish pulpit down to the Reformation, were the authority of holy mother church; the merit of the saints, and their credit in the court of hea∣ven; the dignity, glory, and love of the blessed Virgin; the efficacy of relics; the intolerable fire of purgatory; and the vast importance of
<PB N="243" REF="247"/>
indulgences. Relying on such pious acts for ob∣taining remission of sins, all orders of men rush∣ed headlong into vice<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">An ingenious writer pleasantly observes, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That a croifade was the South-sea project of former times: by the latter, men hoped to gain riches without industry: by the former, they hoped to gain heaven without repentance. amendment of life, or sanctity of manners."</Q> <HI>Sir David Dalrymple, a judge in the court of session.</HI></NOTE>; nor was there a single attempt to stem the current of immorality; for the traffic of indulgences could not but flourish in proportion to the growth of sin. And thus was religion set in direct opposition to morality. St Eloy, bishop of Noyon in the seventh century, and canonized by the church of Rome, delivers the following doctrine. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He is a good Christi∣an who goes frequently to church; who pre∣sents his oblations upon the altar; who tastes not the fruit of his own industry till part be consecrated to God; who, when the holy festivals approach, lives chastely even with his own wife for several days; and who can re∣peat the creed and the Lord's prayer. Re∣deem then your souls from destruction, while you have the means in your power: offer pre∣sents and tithes to churchmen: come more frequently to church: humbly implore the pa∣tronage of saints. If you observe these things, you may, in the day of judgment, go with confidence to the tribunal of the eternal Judge, and say, Give to us, O Lord, for we have given unto thee."</Q> A modern author subjoins a proper observation. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We see here a very ample description of a good Christian, in which there is not the least mention of the love
<PB N="244" REF="248"/>
of God, resignation to his will, obedience to his laws, nor of justice, benevolence, nor charity."</Q> Gross ignorance and wretched su∣perstition prevailed so much even in the fourteenth century, that people reckoned themselves secure of salvation, if at the day of judgment they could show any connection with monks. Many at the point of death, made it their last request, to be admitted into the mendicant order, or to be inter∣red in their burial-place. Religion need not asso∣ciate with morality, if such silly practices be suf∣ficient for obtaining the favour of God. Is this less absurd than the Hindostan belief, That the water of the Ganges hath a sanctifying virtue; and that those who die on its banks, are not only exempted from future punishment, but are waft∣ed straight to paradise?</P>
<P>Forms and ceremonies are visible acts, which make a deep impression on the vulgar. Hence their influence in reasoning and in morality, as we have seen in the two sketches immediately forego∣ing; and hence also their influence in religion. Forms and ceremonies are useful at public worship; but they ought not to take place of essentials. Peo∣ple however, governed by what they see and hear, are more addicted to external acts of devotion, than to heart-worship, which is not known but by reflection.</P>
<P>It will be no excuse for relying so much on forms and ceremonies, that they are innocent. In themselves they may be innocent; but not so in their consequences. For they have by such reli∣ance a violent tendency to relax the obligations of morality. Religious rites that contradict not any passion, are keenly embraced, and punctually per∣formed; and men, flattering themselves that they have thus been punctual in their duty to God, give vent to their passions against men. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They

pay tithes of mint, and anise, and cummin; but omit the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matthew, xxiii. 23.</NOTE>."</Q> Upon such a man religion sits extremely light. As he sel∣dom exercises any act of genuine devotion, he thinks of the Deity with ease and familiarity: how otherwise is it accountable, that the plays, term∣ed <HI>Mysteries,</HI> could be relished, where mean and perhaps dissolute persons are brought on the stage, acting Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and even God himself? These divine persons were certainly not more regarded, than the Grecian gods, who frequently made part of the <HI>Dramatis personae</HI> in Greek plays. Many other facts might be urged, to prove the low ebb of religion in those days: I select one or two, which probably will af∣ford some amusement to the reader. Bartolus, the famous lawyer, in order to shew the form of proceeding in a court of justice, imagines a pro∣cess between the devil and mankind. The devil cites mankind to appear at the tribunal of Jesus Christ, claiming them as belonging to him by Adam's fall. He swells in rage, demanding whe∣ther any one dares appear in their behalf. Against the Virgin Mary, offering herself as their advocate, the devil makes two objections; first, That being the mother of the Judge, her influ∣ence would be too great; second, That a woman is debarred from being an advocate: and these ob∣jections are supported by numberless quotations from the <HI>Corpus Juris.</HI> The Virgin, on her part, quotes texts permitting women to appear for wi∣dows, orphans, and for persons in distress. She is allowed to plead for mankind, as coming under the last article. The devil urges prescription, as
<PB N="246" REF="250"/>
having been in possession of mankind ever since the fall. The Virgin answers, That a <HI>mala-fide possessor</HI> cannot acquire by prescription. Prescrip∣tion being repelled, the parties go to the merits of the cause, which are learnedly discussed with texts from the Pandects. The memoirs of the French academy of Belles Letters<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vol. 18.</NOTE> have the following story. A monk returning from a house which he durst not visit in day-light, had a river to cross. The boat was overturned by Satan, and the monk was drowned when he was beginning to invocate the Virgin Mary. Two devils having laid hold of his soul, were stopped by two angels. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My Lords,"</Q> said the devils, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"true it is, and not a fable, that God died for his friends; but this monk was an enemy to God, and we are carrying him to hell."</Q> After much altercati∣on, it was proposed by the angels, to refer the dispute to the Virgin Mary. The devils were willing to accept of God for judge, because he would judge according to law. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But from the Virgin Mary,"</Q> said they, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we expect no justice: she would break to atoms every gate of hell, rather than suffer one to remain there a moment who pays any worship to her image. She may say, that black is white, and that puddled water is pure.—God never contradicts her. The day on which God made his mo∣ther, was a fatal day to us."</Q></P>
<P>People who profess the same religion, and differ only in forms and ceremonies, may justly be compared to neighbouring states, who are com∣monly bitter enemies to each other, if they have any difference. At the same time, dissocial pas∣sions never rage so furiously, as under the mask of
<PB N="247" REF="251"/>
religion; for in that case they are held to be me∣ritorious, as exerted in the cause of God. This observation is but too well verified in the disputes among Christians. However low religion was in the dark ages, yet men fought for forms and cere∣monies as <HI>pro aris et focis.</HI> In the Armenian form of baptism, the priest says at the first immersion, <HI>In name of the Father;</HI> at the second, <HI>In name of the Son;</HI> at the third, <HI>In name of the Holy Ghost.</HI> This form is bitterly condemned by the Romish church, which appoints the three persons of the Trinity to be joined in the same expression, in to∣ken of their union. Strahlenberg gives an ac∣count of a Christian sect in Russia, which differs from the established Greek church in the follow∣ing particulars. First, In public worship they repeat <HI>Halleluia</HI> but twice; and it is a mortal sin to repeat it thrice. Second, In celebrating mass, not five but seven loaves ought to be used. Third, The cross stamped upon a mass-loaf ought to have eight corners. Fourth, In signing with the cross at prayers, the end of the ring-finger must be joined to the end of the thumb, and the two intermediate fingers be held out at full length. How trifling are these differences! and yet for such differences, all who dissent from them are held unclean, and no better than Pagans: they will not eat nor drink with any of the established church; and if a person of that church happen to sit down in a house of theirs, they wash and purify the seat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Christians, occupied too much with external forms, have corrupted several of the fine arts.

There are few sects founded
<PB N="248" REF="252"/>
upon more triival differences than the Turkish and Persian Mahometans. The epithets given to the Persians by the Turks are, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Forsaken of God, Abominable, Blasphemers of the Holy Pro∣phet;"</Q> and so bitter is their enmity to the Per∣sians, that the schools of the seraglio are open to young men of all nations, those of Persia alone excepted. The Persians are held to be such apostates from the true faith, as to be utterly past recovery: they receive no quarter in war, being accounted unworthy of life or slavery. Nor do the Persians yield to the Turks in hatred. Whe∣ther coffee be or be not prohibited in the Alcoran, has produced much controversy in the Mahome∣tan church, and consequently much persecuting zeal. A mufti, not fond of coffee, declared it, like wine, to have an inebriating quality, and therefore was virtually prohibited by Mahomet. Another mufti, fond of coffee for its exhilarating virtue, declared it lawful; <Q REND="inline">"because,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"all things are lawful that are not expressly pro∣hibited in the Alcoran."</Q> The coffee-houses in Constantinople, were for a long period alternate∣ly opened and shut, according to the taste of the reigning mufti; till coffee at last, surmounting all obstacles, came to be an established Mahome∣tan liquor. Religion thus runs wild, whenever it loses sight of its true ends, that of worshipping God, and that of being just to man. The Hin∣dows hate the Mahometans for eating the flesh of cows: the Mahometans hate the Hindows for eating the flesh of swine. The aversion that men of the same religion have at each other for the most
<PB N="249" REF="253"/>
trivial differences, converts them frequently into brutal savages. Suppose, for example, that a poor man, reduced to the extremity of hunger, makes a greedy meal of a dead horse, a case so deplorable would wring every heart. And yet, let this be done in Lent, or on a meagre day—Behold! every zealot is instantly metamorphosed into a devil incarnate. In the records of St Clau∣de, a small district of Burgundy, is engrossed a sentence against a poor gentleman named <HI>Claude Guillon.</HI> The words are, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Having considered the process, and taken advice of the doctors of law, we declare the said Claude Guillon duly convicted for having carried away and boiled a piece of a dead horse, and of having eat the same on the 31st March, being Saturday."</Q> And he was beheaded accordingly 28th July 1629; notwithstanding a defence above all ex∣ception, That he committed that irregularity to preserve his life. How was it possible for the monsters to persuade themselves, that this sen∣tence was agreeable to God, who is goodness it∣self!</P>
<P>No less prejudicial to morality, than the rely∣ing too much on forms and ceremonies, is the treating some sins with great severity; neglecting others equally heinous, or perhaps more so. In a book of rates for absolution, mentioned above, no just distinction is made among sins; some ve∣nial sins being taxed at a higher rate than many of the deepest dye. For example, the killing father, mother, brother, sister, or wife, is tax∣ed at five gross; and the same for incest with a mother or sister. The lying with a woman in the church is taxed at six gross; and at the same time, absolution for usury is taxed at seven gross, and for simony at no less than sixteen gross<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A gross is the third part of a ducat.</NOTE>.</P>

A maxim adopted by many pious persons, has a smiling appearance, but in its consequences is hurtful both to religion and morality; which is, That to testify our veneration for the Deity, and zeal for his service, the performing public and private worship, and the fulfilling moral duties, are not alone sufficient; that over and above we are bound to fast, to do penance, to honour the priesthood, and to punish the enemies of God, <HI>i. e.</HI> those who differ from us in principles or practice. This maxim, which may be termed <HI>the doctrine of supererogation,</HI> is finely illustrated by an author mentioned above. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The duties which a man performs as a friend or parent, seem merely owing to his benefactor or chil∣dren; nor can he be wanting to these duties without breaking through all the ties of nature and morality. A strong inclination may prompt him to the performance: a sentiment of or∣der and moral beauty joins its force to these natural ties: and the whole man is drawn to his duty without any effort or endeavour. Even with regard to the virtues which are more austere, and more founded on reflecti∣on, such as public spirit, filial duty, tempe∣rance, or integrity: the moral obligation, in our apprehension, removes all pretence to religious merit: and the virtuous conduct is esteemed no more than what we owe to socie∣ty, and to ourselves. In all this, a supersti∣tious man finds nothing which he has properly performed for the sake of his Deity, or which can peculiarly recommend him to the divine favour and protection. He considers not, that the most genuine method of serving the Divinity is by promoting the happiness of his creatures. He still looks out for some more immediate service of the supreme Being: and
<PB N="251" REF="255"/>
any practice recommended to him, which ei∣ther serves to no purpose in life, or offers the strongest violence to his natural inclinations; that practice he will the more readily em∣brace, on account of those very circumstan∣ces, which should make him absolutely reject it. It seems the more purely religious, that it proceeds from no mixture of any other mo∣tive or consideration. And if for its sake he sacrifices much of his ease and quiet, his claim of merit appears still to rise upon him, in proportion to the zeal and devotion which he discovers. In restoring a loan, or paying a debt, his divinity is no wise beholden to him; because these acts of justice are what he was bound to perform, and what many would have performed, were there no God in the universe. But if he fast a day, or give him∣self a sound whipping, this has a direct refe∣rence, in his opinion, to the service of God. No other motive could engage him to such au∣sterities. By these distinguished marks of de∣votion, he has now acquired the divine fa∣vour; and may expect in recompence, pro∣tection and safety in this world, and eternal happiness in the next<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Natural History of Religion.</NOTE>."</Q> My yoke is easy, saith our Saviour, and my burden is light.

But enthusiasts are not easily persuaded, that to make ourselves happy in the exercises of piety and benevolence, is the most acceptable ser∣vice to God that we can perform. In loading re∣ligion

Law, up∣on Christian perfection, enjoins such unnatural austerity of manners, as to be subversive both of religion and morality: loose education is not more so. Our passions, when denied their pro∣per exercise, are apt to break their fetters, and to plunge us into every extravagance: like the body, which squeezed in one part, swells the more in another. In the same way of thinking, the pious Jeremy Taylor, treating of mortifica∣tion, prescribes it as the indispensable duty of a Christian, to give no indulgence even to the most innocent emotions; because, says he, the most indifferent action becomes sinful, when there is no other motive for the performance but barely its being pleasant. Could a malevolent deity contrive any thing more severe against his vota∣ries?</P>
<P>In the same spirit of supererogation, holidays have been multiplied without end, depriving the working poor of time, that would be more use∣fully employed in providing bread for themselves and families. Such a number of holidays, beside contradicting Providence, which framed us more for action than contemplation, have several poiso∣nous effects with respect to morality. The mo∣ral sense has great influence on the industrious, who have no time for indulging their irregular ap∣petites: the idle, on the contrary, are obvious to every temptation. Men likewise are apt to assume great merit from a rigid observance of
<PB N="253" REF="257"/>
holidays and other ceremonies; and having thus acquired, in their opinion, the favour of God, they rely on his indulgence in other matters which they think too sweet for sinners.</P>
<P>Monastic institutions are an improvement upon holidays: the whole life of a monk is intended to be a holiday, dedicated entirely to the service of God. The idleness of the monastic state a∣mong Christians, opens a wide door to immora∣lity.</P>
<P>In the third section, penances are handled as a mode of worship, for obtaining pardon of sin. But they are sometimes submitted to by the inno∣cent, in order to procure from the Almighty still more favour than innocence alone is intitled to; in which view they are evidently a work of su∣pererogation. They seem to have no bad effect with respect to religion, as distinguished from morality: the body is indeed cruciated unnecessa∣rily; but if enthusiasts voluntarily submit to bodily distresses, they have themselves only to blame. With respect to morality, their bad tendency is not slight. Those who perform extraordinary acts of devotion, conceive them∣selves peculiarly entitled to the favour of God. Proud of his favour, they attach themselves to him alone, and turn indifferent about every other duty. The favourite of a terrestrial potentate, assumes authority; and takes liberties that pri∣vate persons dare not venture upon: shall a fa∣vourite of Heaven be less indulged? The Fa∣quirs in Hindostan submit to dreadful penances; and, holding themselves secure of God's favour, they are altogether indifferent about the duty they owe to their neighbour. So much are they above common decency, as to go about naked, not even concealing what modesty forbids us to expose. The penances enjoined in the Romish
<PB N="254" REF="258"/>
church, such as fasting and flagellation, have evidently the same bad tendency<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A sect of Christians, styled <HI>Flagellantes,</HI> held, that flagellation is of equal virtue with baptism and the other sacraments; that it will procure forgiveness of sin; that the old law of Christ is to be abolished, and a new law substituted; enjoining the baptism of blood to be administered by whipping.</NOTE>. With re∣spect to fasting in particular, to what good pur∣pose it can serve, except to gluttons, is not rea∣dily conceived. Temperance in eating and drink∣ing is essential to health: too much or too little are equally noxious, though their effects are dif∣ferent. Fasting therefore ought never to be en∣joined to the temperate as a religious duty, be∣cause it cannot be acceptable to a benevolent Deity. Listen to a great prophet on that sub∣ject. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness; ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.

Wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?

<P><PB N="255" REF="259"/>
The most extraordinary penance of all, is ce∣libacy, considered as a religious duty. Many fa∣thers of the church declare against matrimony. St. Jerom in particular says, That the end of matrimony is eternal death; that the earth in∣deed is filled by it, but heaven by virginity. The intemperate zeal of many primitive Christi∣ans led them to abstain from matrimony, and even from conjugal caresses, if they had the misfor∣tune to be married; believing that the carnal ap∣petite is inconsistent with pure religion. Edward the confessor was sainted, for no better reason than the abstaining from matrimonial duties. Jovinian, in the fourth century, taught, that all who observe the laws of piety and virtue laid down in the gospel, have an equal title to happi∣ness in another life: consequently, that those who pass their days in celibacy and mortification, are in no respect more acceptable to God than those who live virtuously in marriage without mortification. He published his opinions in a book, against which Jerom wrote a bitter and abusive treatise, still extant. These opinions were condemned by the church, and by St. Am∣brose, in a council at Milan; and Jovinian was banished by the Emperor Honorius. Such ridi∣culous self-denial was not confined to Christians. Strabo mentions a sect among the Thracians, who made a vow of perpetual virginity; and were much respected on that account. Garci∣lasso mentions virgins in Peru consecrated to the sun: a vestal guilty of frailty was buried alive, her lover hanged, and the inhabitants of the town where she lived put to the sword. Among all the absurd acts of mortification, the present af∣fords the strongest instance of superstition tri∣umphing over common sense; for what can be more inconsistent with common sense, not to talk
<PB N="256" REF="260"/>
of religion, than an endeavour to put an end to the human species? Some glimpses of reason have abated the zeal of enthusiasts for celebacy; but have not totally extirpated it, for celibacy of the clergy remains to this day a law in the Ro∣mish church. It cannot however seriously be thought the will of our benevolent God, that his priests should be denied the exercise of natural powers, bestowed on all for a most valuable pur∣pose. This impious restraint, which contradicts the great law of <HI>Increase and multiply,</HI> has opened the door to gross debauchery in the pastors of the Romish church, though ecclesiastics ought of all men to be the most circumspect in their con∣duct. Men restrained from what is necessary and proper, are more prone than others to break out into gross irregularities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An ingenious writer, mentioned above, makes the following observation. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The celibacy of ecclesia∣stics was originally introduced by some superstitious refinements on the law of God and nature. Could men have been kept alive without eating or drink∣ing, as well as without marriage, the same refine∣ments would have prohibited ecclesiastics from eat∣ing and drinking, and thereby have elevated them so much nearer to the state of angels. In process of time, this fanatical interdiction became an in∣strument of worldly wisdom: and thus, as frequent∣ly happens, what weak men began, politicians com∣pleted."</Q> <HI>Sir David Dalrymple.</HI></NOTE>. Marriage is warm∣ly recommended in the laws of Zoroaster. Chil∣dren are said to be a bridge that conducts men to heaven; and a man who has no children, is held to be under the power of Ahriman.

<P>The celibacy of the clergy was countenanced by the Pope; and enforced from a political con∣sideration,
<PB N="257" REF="261"/>
That it united the whole clergy into one firm body under his spiritual Majesty. How short-sighted is man? It was justly esteemed at the time to be the corner-stone of Papal power; and yet became the chief cause of its downfall. Celibacy precipitated the Romish clergy into adultery, fornication, cunning, dissimulation, and every secret vice. Will men of such man∣ners be listened to, when they preach purity to their hearers? There was no medium, but ei∣ther to reform their own manners, or to give every indulgence to the laity. But the ignorance and superstition of the latter, rendered the for∣mer secure in their own opinion. The restora∣tion of learning broke the charm. Men begin∣ning to think for themselves, were provoked at the dissolute lives of their pastors, and raised a loud cry against them, not yet thinking of their doctrines. Reformers were burnt as heretics; and clergymen were held to be emissaries from Satan, to establish his throne upon earth. Knox, that violent reformer, believed seriously, that Cardinal Beaton was <HI>a conjured enemy to Christ Jesus.</HI> Providence brings good out of ill. Had not the clergy been dissolute, poor Christians might have laboured under ignorance and ecclesi∣astical thraldom to this hour. Our reformers, beginning with their pastors, extended insensibly their hatred to the doctrines taught by their pas∣tors. Every article of faith was sifted: the chaff was separated from the corn; and a reformation was established upon the scriptures, rejecting every innovation of the Romish church.</P>
<P>There is not mentioned in history a more impu∣dent attack upon moral principles, than a privilege assumed by the Bishop of Rome, to disengage men from their oaths and promises: it is not a greater
<PB N="258" REF="262"/>
stretch to disengage them from every duty, whe∣ther of morality or of religion. The barons of Va∣lentia, dreading a persecution against the industri∣ous Moors, their tenants, obtained the following clause to be in their king's coronation-oath: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he should not expel the Moriscos, nor force them to be baptized; that he should never desire to be relieved from the oath by a dispensation from the Pope, nor accept a dispensation if offe∣red."</Q> The Emperor Charles V. took this oath solemnly in presence of his nobles; and yet accepted a dispensation from the Pope, absolving him from the oath, and from the guilt of perjury in breaking it. Augustus King of Poland, in the treaty of Altramstadt, renounced the kingdom of Poland to his competitor Stanislaus. The defeat of the King of Sweden at Poltowa, was an invi∣ting opportunity to renew his pretensions. A so∣lemn treaty stood in his way; but the Pope re∣moved that obstacle, by annulling the treaty, and setting him at liberty. The Pope has been known even to bestow that wonderful privilege upon others. Pope Pascal II. having with a so∣lemn oath renounced the right of investitures, empowered the cardinals to declare his oath null. Bishops also, imitating their superior, have assu∣med the privilege of dispensing with moral du∣ties. Instances are not rare, of curates being au∣thorized by their bishop to entertain concubines, paying for each a regular tax of a crown yearly. Nay, in some provincial synods, they are enjoin∣ed to keep concubines, in order to prevent scan∣dal. Common prostitutes, licensed in the city of Leghorn, have a church peculiar to themselves, and must not enter into any other. They follow their trade with the utmost freedom; except in passion-week, during which they must forbear sinning, under pain of banishment.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="263"/>
The power of bestowing kingdoms, assumed by the bishop of Rome, was an encroachment on the rules of justice, no less bold. Christian prin∣ces, not many ages ago, esteemed the Pope's gift to be their best title of property. In the year 1346, the Venetians requested the Pope's per∣mission to carry on commerce in Asia, and to purchase there pepper and cinnamon. The Pope not only granted their request, but pronounced anathemas upon any who should dare to inter∣fere in that commerce. Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, applied to Pope Alexander VI. to vest in them the property of America, discovered un∣der their auspices by Columbus. The Pope ha∣ving formerly made a grant to the kings of Por∣tugal, of their discoveries in the East Indies, both grants were held sacred; and it came to be stre∣nuously disputed, under which of the grants the Molucca islands were comprehended. Both grants proceed upon a narrative, of the power bestow∣ed by Almighty God on the Pope as successor to St Peter and vicar of Christ. To imagine, that the Almighty would bestow such powers on the Bishop of Rome, or on any human being, shews gross ignorance of the common rights of man∣kind, and of the government of Providence.</P>
<P>The grossest of all deviations, not only from sound morality but from pure religion, and the most extensive in its baneful effects, is a doctrine embraced by established churches, not many ex∣cepted, That because heretics are odious in the sight of God, it is the duty of the orthodox to extirpate them root and branch. Observe the consequence: people who differ from the esta∣blished church, are held to be obstinate sinners, deserving punishment here as well as hereafter. The religion of every country is changeable; and the religion at present dominant may soon be
<PB N="260" REF="264"/>
under depression; which of course subjects all mankind to the rigour of persecution. An in∣vention more effectual for extirpating the hu∣man race, is not within the reach of human pow∣ers: the horror of human sacrifices is as nothing in comparison.</P>
<P>The old Romans, far from having any notion of persecution, adopted the gods of every nation they conquered. A learned writer<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Morinus.</NOTE> observes, that as the number of their gods increased with their conquests, it is possible that they might have worshipped all the gods in the world. Their be∣lief in tutelar deities produced that effect. Titus Livius mentions a sect of Bacchanals that spread through Italy. They performed their ceremonies during night, men and women mix∣ing in the dark after intemperate eating and drink∣ing. Never did wicked wretches deserve more exemplary punishment; yet listen to the follow∣ing decree of the Roman senate, breathing the true spirit of toleration. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ne qua Bacchana∣lia Romae, neve in Italia essent. Si quis tale sacrum, solenne, et necessarium duceret, nec sine religione et piaculo se id omittere posse; apud praetorem urbanum profiteretur; praetor senatum consuleret.

If liberty be granted him by the senate when no fewer than a hundred senators are present, let him per∣form the sacrifice, but privately, in presence of no greater number than five persons. Let there be no public fund for them, nor any who shall preside as priest or master of the rites."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> The Jews however were prone to
<PB N="261" REF="265"/>
persecution; for though they considered the Su∣preme Being as their tutelar deity, yet the malig∣nity of their nature prevailed to make them hold in abhorrence the worship of every other god. Even among themselves, they were abundantly disposed to war; and nothing kept within bounds the Pharisees, the Sadduces, and the Essenes, their three sects, but terror of the Roman pow∣er. The Christian religion implies toleration in its very nature and principles; but being corrup∣ted by ignorance, interest, and superstition, it became prone to persecution, above all others. Christian sects were enflamed against each other to a degree of brutality; the most opposite to peace and brotherly love, inculcated in the gos∣pel. It was propagated by the orthodox, that Arius expired in a common jakes, and that his entrails burst out. The same is related of Hune∣ric King of the Vandals, a zealous Arian; with the following addition, that being possessed with the devil, whom he had glutted with the blood of many martyrs, he tore his flesh off with his teeth, and ended his wretched life in the most excruciating, though justly deserved, torments. The falsehoods every where spread during the fourteenth century against the Jews, such as their poisoning the public fountains, killing Christian
<PB N="262" REF="266"/>
infants, and drinking their blood, with many other falsehoods of the same stamp, were invent∣ed and greedily swallowed through the influence of religious hatred. The greater part of perse∣cutions have been occasioned in the same man∣ner; for men are not so desperately wicked, as to approve of persecution, unless when blinded by intemperate zeal. The same religious hatred produced the assassination of the Duke of Guise, and of two Henrys, Kings of France; produced the gun-powder plot; and produced the most horrid deed that ever was perpetrated among men, the massacre of St. Bartholomew<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monsieur de Tavannes, afterward Mareschal of France, was a great partisan of the Queen-mother, and so active in the massacre, that with his own hand he murdered no fewer than seventeen Huguenots.

<P>No false principle in religion has shed more in∣nocent, or rather virtuous blood, than that of persecuting heretics; <HI>i. e.</HI> those who differ in any article from the religion established by law. The doctrine of burning heretics, is in effect the professing to burn men highly virtuous; for they must be so in an eminent degree, who submit to be burnt alive, rather than be guilty even of dissimulation. The Mahometan practice of con∣verting people by the sword, if not more rati∣onal, is at least more manly. Louis IX. of France, one of its best princes, would have been a greater blessing to his people, had he been less
<PB N="263" REF="267"/>
pious: he had an implacable aversion to here∣tics, against whom he thought it more proper to employ racks and gibbets, than argument and persuasion. Torquemada, that infernal inquisi∣tor of Spain, brought into the inquisition, in the space of fourteen years, no fewer than 80,000 persons; of whom 6000 were condemned to the flames, and burnt alive with the greatest pomp and exultation. Of that vast number, there was perhaps not a single person, who was not more pure in religion, as well as in morals, than their outrageous persecutor. Hunter a young man about nineteen years of age, was one of the unhappy victims to the zeal of Queen Mary of England for Popery. Having been inadvertently betrayed by a priest to deny transubstantiation, he abscon∣ded, to keep out of harm's way. Bonner, that arch-hangman of Popery, threatened ruin to the father, if he did not deliver up the young man. Hunter, hearing of his father's danger, made his appearance; and was burnt alive, instead of be∣ing rewarded for his filial piety. A woman of Guernsey was brought to the stake, without re∣gard to her big belly; which bursting by the tor∣ture, she was delivered in the midst of the flames. One of the guards snatched the infant from the fire: but the magistrate who attended the execution, ordered it to be thrown back; be∣ing resolved, he said, that nothing should sur∣vive which sprung from a parent so obstinately heretical. Father Paul (Council of Trent, book 5.) computes, that in the Netherlands alone, from the time that the edict of Charles V. was promulgated against the reformers, fifty thousand persons were hanged, beheaded, buried alive, or burnt, on account of religion. Some Faquirs, crazed with opium and fanaticism, have been known with poisoned daggers to fall upon
<PB N="264" REF="268"/>
uncircumcised Europeans, and to put every one to death whom they could master. In the last century, a Faquir at Surate murdered, within the space of a minute, seventeen Dutch sailors with seventeen stabs of a dagger. We think with horror of human sacrifices among the ancient Pa∣gans; and yet we behold them every day among Christians, rendered still more horrid by the most atrocious torments that religious hatred can de∣vise.</P>
<P>The great motive to such cruelties, is the su∣perstitious and absurd notion, that heretics are God's enemies; which makes it thought an ac∣ceptable service to God, not only to persecute them by fire and sword in this world, but to deli∣ver them over to Satan in the world to come. Another circumstance enflames religious hatred; which is, that neighbours are either intimate friends or bitter enemies. This holds with a slight variation in sects of the same religion: however minute their differences be, they can∣not be intimate friends; and therefore are bitter enemies: the nearer they approach to unison, if not entirely concordant, the greater in proportion is their mutual natred. Such hatred, subduing the meek spirit of Christianity, is an additional cause for persecution. Blind zeal for what is be∣lieved to be the only true religion, never disco∣vers error nor innocence in those who differ, but perverseness and criminal obstinacy. Two reli∣gions totally different, like two countries in op∣posite parts of the globe, produce no mutual enmity. At the siege of Constantinople by the Turks, ann. 1453, the Emperor, in order to procure assistance from the princes of the Latin church, ordered mass to be celebrated in one of his churches according to the form used in Rome. The people with great indignation protested,
<PB N="265" REF="269"/>
that they would rather see the Turks in their churches, than the hat of a cardinal.</P>
<P>The history of the Waldenses, tho' well known, cannot be too often repeated. In the twelfth cen∣tury, a merchant of Lyons, named <HI>Peter Valdo,</HI> dissatisfied with the pomp and ceremonies of the Romish church, ill suited, in his opinion, to the humility of a Christian, retired to a desert in the high country of Provence, with several poor peo∣ple his disciples. There he became their spiritu∣al guide, instructing them in certain doctrines, the same that were afterward adopted by the Pro∣testants. Their incessant labour subdued the bar∣ren soil, and prepared it for grain as well as for pasture. The rent which in time they were ena∣bled to pay for land that afforded none originally, endeared them to their landlords. In 250 years, they multiplied to the number of 18,000, occu∣pying thirty villages, beside hamlets, the work of their own hands. Priests they had none, nor any disputes about religion: neither had they occa∣sion for a court of justice, as brotherly love did not suffer them to go to law: they worshipped God in their own plain way, and their innocence was secured by incessant labour. They had long enjoyed the sweets of peace and mutual affection, when the reformers of Germany and Geneva sent ministers among them; which unhappily laid them open to religious hatred, the most unrelent∣ing of all furies. In the year 1540, the parlia∣ment of Provence condemned nineteen of them to be burnt for heresy, their trees to be rooted up, and their houses to be razed to the ground. The Waldenses, terrified at this sentence, applied in a body to Cardinal Sadolet, bishop of Carpentras; who received them kindly, and obtained from Francis I. of France, a pardon for the persons under sentence of death, on condition of abjur∣ing
<PB N="266" REF="270"/>
heresy. The matter lay over five years; when the parliament, irritated at them for perse∣vering in their tenets, prevailed on the King to withdraw his pardon. The sentence was execut∣ed with great rigour; and the parliament, laying hold of that opportunity, broke through every restraint of law, and commenced a violent perse∣cution against the whole nation. The soldiers began with massacring old men, women, and children, all having fled who were able to fly; and proceeded to burn their houses, barns, and corn. There remained in the town of Cabriere sixty men and thirty women; who having surren∣dered upon promise of life, were butchered each of them without mercy. Some women who had taken refuge in a church, were dragged out, and burnt alive. Twenty-two villages were reduced to ashes; and that populous and flourishing di∣strict, became once more a desert.</P>
<P>To conceive this horrid scene in all its defor∣mity, the people persecuted ought to be compar∣ed with the clergy their persecutors; for the civil magistrate was the hand only that executed their vengeance: on the one side, an industrious peo∣ple, pure in their morals, and no less pure in their religion: on the other, proud pampered priests, abandoned without shame to every wick∣edness, impure in their morals, and still more impure in their religion—the world never furnish∣ed such another contrast. Had the scene been reversed, to make these wretches suffer persecu∣tion from the Waldenses—but that people were too upright and too religious for being persecutors. The manners of the Christian clergy in general, before the Reformation, enlivens the contrast. The doctrine promulgated during the dark times of Christianity, That God is a mercenary being; and that every person, however wicked, may ob∣tain
<PB N="267" REF="271"/>
pardon of his sins by money, made riches flow into the hands of ecclesiastics in a plentiful stream. And riches had the same effect upon the Christian clergy that they have upon all men, which is, to produce pride, sensuality, and pro∣fligacy: these again produced dissipation of mo∣ney, which prompted avarice, and every inven∣tion for recruiting exhausted treasures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, many of the clergy dealt in merchandise; and, being free of taxes, engrossed all. In the Netherlands particularly, there was a great cry, that monasteries were convert∣ed into shops and ware-houses, and the mansions of secular priests into tap-houses and inns.</NOTE>. Even as early as the eighth century, the Christian clergy, tempted by opulence, abandoned them∣selves to pleasure, without moderation; and far exceeded the laity in luxury, gluttony, and lust. When such were the pastors, what must have been the flock! Rejoice, O Scotland, over the poverty and temperance of thy pastors. During that period, the clergy could read, and, like parrots, they could mumble prayers in Latin: in every other respect, they rivalled the laity in ignorance. They were indeed more cunning than the laity; and understood their interest better, if to covet riches at the expence of probity, de∣serve that name. Three articles were established that made religion an easy service. First, That faith is the essence of religion, without regard to good works; and hence the necessity of being strictly orthodox, which the church only could determine. Second, Religious worship was re∣duced to a number of external ceremonies and forms, which, being declared sufficient for salva∣tion, absolved Christians from every moral duty.
<PB N="268" REF="272"/>
Remark, that a priest is always the chief person in ceremonial worship. The third article, That God is a mercenary being, is mentioned above, with its necessary consequences. These articles brought about a total neglect, both in clergy and laity, not only of morality, but of every essen∣tial religious duty. In fine, there never was a religion that deviated more from just principles, than that professed by Christians during the dark ages. Persecution reached none but the sincerely pious and virtuous.

And behold a man bent with age, coming from the way of the wilder∣ness
<PB N="269" REF="273"/>
leaning on a staff. And Abraham arose, and met him, and said unto him, Turn in, I pray thee, and wash thy feet, and tarry all night; and thou shalt arise early in the morn∣ing, and go on thy way. And the man said, Nay; for I will abide under this tree. But Abraham pressed him greatly: so he turned, and they went into the tent: and Abraham baked unleavened bread, and they did eat. And when Abraham saw that the man blessed not God, he said unto him, Wherefore dost thou not worship the most high God, creator of heaven and earth? And the man answered and said, I do not worship thy God, neither do I call upon his name; for I have made to myself a God, which abideth always in mine house, and provideth me with all things. And Abraham's zeal was kindled against the man, and he arose, and fell upon him, and drove him forth with blows into the wilderness. And God called unto Abraham, saying, Abraham, where is the stranger? And Abraham answer∣ed and said, Lord, he would not worship thee, neither would he call upon thy name; there∣fore have I driven him out from before my face into the wilderness. And God said, Have I borne with him these hundred ninety and eight years, and nourished him, and clothed him, notwithstanding his rebellion against me; and couldst not thou, who art thyself a sinner, bear with him one night?"</Q> The historical style of the Old Testament is here finely imitat∣ed; and the moral must strike every one who is not sunk in stupidity and superstition. Were it really a chapter of Genesis, one is apt to think, that persecution could never have shown a bare face among Jews or Christians. But alas! that is a vain thought. Such a passage in the Old
<PB N="270" REF="274"/>
Testament, would avail as little against the ran∣corous passions of men, as the following passages in the New Testament, tho' persecution cannot be condemned in terms more explicit. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Him that is weak in the faith, receive you, but not to doubtful disputations. For one believ∣eth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. Let not him that eat∣eth, despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not, judge him that eateth. Who art thou that judgest another man's ser∣vant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let eve∣ry man be fully persuaded in his own mind. But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, every one to give an account of him∣self to God. I know, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing unclean, to him it is unclean. The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Epistle of Paul to the Romans, chap. 14.</NOTE>."</Q> Our Saviour himself declared against persecution in the most express terms. The Jews and Samari∣tans were of the same religion; but some trivial differences in the ceremonial part of worship, rendered them odious to each other. Our Savi∣our being refused lodging in a village of Samaria, because he was travelling to Jerusalem, his disci∣ples James and John said, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lord, wilt thou that
<PB N="271" REF="275"/>
we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?"</Q> But he rebuked them, and said, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Son of man is not come to destroy means lives, but to save them<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Luke, ix. 54.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>It gives me real concern, that even the hot fire of persecution, did not altogether purify our Reformed clergy from that satanical spirit. No sooner were the Dissenters settled in New Eng∣land, where they fled to avoid persecution, than they set on foot a persecution against the Quakers, no less furious than what they themselves had suffered at home. Nor did the Reformed clergy in Scotland lose sight of that magisterial autho∣rity, which had been assumed by their predeces∣sors of the Romish church, on the ridiculous pre∣text, of being ambassadors to men from Jesus Christ. Upon a representation, ann. 1646, from the commission of the kirk of Scotland, James Bell and Colin Campbell, bailies of Glasgow, were committed to prison by the parliament, merely for having said, that kirk-men meddled too much in civil matters. Could a despotic prince have exerted a more arbitrary act? but the church was all-powerful in those days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Toleration in religion, though obvious to com∣mon understanding, was not however the production of reason, but of commerce. The advantage of tolera∣tion for promoting commerce, was discovered long be∣fore by the Portuguese. They were too zealous Ca∣tholics to venture so bold a measure in Portugal; but it was permitted in Goa, and the inquisition in that town was confined to Roman Catholics.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="276"/>
I would do justice to every church, not except∣ing that of Rome; and it is doing that church no more but justice to acknowledge, that the spirit of persecution was not more eminent in it, than zeal for making converts. The former is retiring out of the world; and I wish it most profound rest, never again to revive. People begin to be ashamed of it, as of a garment long out of fa∣shion. Let the other continue for amusement: it is innocent; and if it do no good, it is not productive of so much harm.</P>
<P>The desire of making converts proceeds from two different causes. In superstitious zealots, it proceeds from an opinion, that all who differ from them are in the road to damnation: for which reason, there is a rage of making converts among Roman Catholics; who, without ceremony, de∣liver over to the flames of hell, every person who is not of their communion The other cause is more natural: every man thinks himself in the right, especially in matters of consequence; and for that reason, he is happy to find others of his opinion<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Elements of Criticism, vol. 2. p. 493. edit. 5.</NOTE>. With respect to the first cause, I beg attention to the following considerations; not with any hope of converting zealots, but to pre∣vent, if possible, others from becoming such. In none of the works of God is variety more hap∣pily blended with uniformity, than in the forma∣tion of man. Uniformity prevails in the human face with respect to eyes, nose, mouth, and other capital parts: variety prevails in the expressions of these parts, serving to distinguish one person from another, without hazard of error. In like manner, the minds of men are uniform with re∣spect to their passions and principles; but the va∣rious
<PB N="273" REF="277"/>
tones and expressions of these, form diffe∣rent characters without end. A face destitute of a nose or of a mouth, is monstrous: a mind de∣stitute of the moral sense, or of a sense of reli∣gion, is no less so. But variety of expression in different faces, is agreeable: because we relish variety; and a similar variety in the expressions or tones of passion, ought to be equally agreeable. Endless differences in temper, in taste, and in mental faculties, that of reason in particular, produce necessarily variety in sentiment and in opinion. Can God be displeased with such vari∣ety, when it is his own work? He requires no uniformity except with respect to an upright mind and clear conscience, which are indispensable. Here at the same time is discovered an illustrious final cause. Different countenances in the hu∣man race, not only distinguish one person from another, but promote society, by aiding us to chuse a friend, an associate, a partner for life. Differences in opinion and sentiment, have still more beneficial effects: they rouse the attention, give exercise to the understanding, and sharpen the reasoning faculty. With respect to religion in particular, perfect uniformity, which furnish∣eth no subject for thinking nor for reasoning, would produce languor in divine worship, and make us sink into cold indifference. How fran∣tic then is the rage of making proselytes? Let every man enjoy his native liberty, of thinking as well as of acting; free to act as he pleases, provided he obey the rules of morality; equally free to think as he pleases, provided he obey the great God as his maker and master, and acknow∣ledge the necessary connection of religion with morality. Strict uniformity in other matters, may be compared to a spring-day, calm and se∣rene; neither so hot as to make us drop a gar∣ment,
<PB N="274" REF="278"/>
nor so cold as to require an addition; no wind to ruffle, nor rain to make shelter necessary. We enjoy the sweet scene for a moment: we walk, we sit, we muse;—but soon fall asleep. Agitation is the element of man, and the life of society. Let us not attempt to correct the works of God: the attempt will betray us into absurd errors. This doctrine cannot be better illustra∣ted than by a conversation, reported by the Jesuit Tachard, between the king of Siam, and a French ambassador, who, in his master's name, urged that king to embrace the Christian religion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am surprised,"</Q> said his Majesty of Siam, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the King of France, my good friend, should interest himself so warmly in what con∣cerns God only. He hath given to his crea∣tures different minds and different inclinations, which naturally lead them two differ in opinion. We admire variety in the material world: why not equally admire it in matters of religi∣on? Have we not then reason to believe, that God takes pleasure in all the different forms of worship? Had it been the intention of God to produce uniformity in religion, he would have formed all men with the same mind."</Q> Bernier introduces some Gentiles of Hindostan defending their religion much in the same manner: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That they did not pretend their law to be universal; that they did not hold ours to be false, as, for aught they knew, it might be a good law for us; and that God probably made many roads to heaven."</Q></P>
<P>With respect to the other cause above mentio∣ned, viz. the desire of putting people in the right road. To reason others into our religious principles, is natural; but it is not always pru∣dent. I wish my neighbour to be of my opinion, because I think my opinion right: but is there no
<PB N="275" REF="279"/>
danger of undermining his religious principles, without establishing better in their stead? Ought I not to restrain my desire of making converts, when the attempt may possibly reduce them to abandon religion altogether, as a matter of utter uncertainty? If a man of clear understanding has by some unhappy means been led into error, that man may be set right by fair reasoning: but beware of endeavouring to convert people of low parts, who are indebted for their creed to parents, to education, or to example: it is safer to let them rest as they are.</P>
<P>At any rate, let us never attempt to gain pro∣selytes by rewards nor by terror: what other ef∣fect can such motives produce, but dissimulation and lying, parents of every secret crime? The Empress of Russia uses a method for converting her Pagan subjects of Kamskatka, no less agree∣able than effectual; which is, to exempt from taxes for ten years, such of them as profess the Christian religion. This practice may be politi∣cal; but it tends not to advance religion, and is destructive of morality. Terror, on the other hand, may be equally effectual, but is not alto∣gether so agreeable. The people of Rum, one of the Hebrides, were Papists till the beginning of the present century, when in one day they were all proselyted to the Protestant faith. Ma∣clean of Coll, their chieftain, went to the island with a Protestant minister, and ordered all the inhabitants to appear on Sunday at public worship. They came, but refused to hear a Protestant mi∣nister. The chieftain reasoned with them: but finding that his reasonings made no impression, he laid hold of the most forward; and having made a deep impression on him with his cane, pushed him into the church. The rest followed like meek lambs; and from that day have conti∣nued
<PB N="276" REF="280"/>
firm Protestants. The Protestantism of Rum is styled by their Popish neighbours, the faith of the <HI>yellow stick.</HI></P>
<P>To apply rewards, terror, or any other means, for making proselytes, except fair reasoning, ap∣pears to me a strange perversion. Can God be pleased with such means, or can any rational man justify them? What then should move any one to put them in practice? I should be utterly at a loss to answer the question, but for a fact men∣tioned more than once above, that the rude and illiterate, judge by sight only, and not by reflec∣tion, which makes them lay weight on the exter∣nal visible act, without thinking of intention, because it is not visible. In truth, the bulk of mankind rest upon the external profession of reli∣gion: they never dip into the heart, nor consider how that stands affected. What else is it but the external act merely, that moves the Romish mis∣sionaries to baptize the infants of savages even at the moment of expiring? which they prosecute with much pious ardour. Their zeal merits ap∣plause, but by no means their judgment. Can any rational person seriously believe, that the dip∣ping a savage or an infant in water, will make ei∣ther of them a Christian, or that the want of this ceremony will precipitate them into hell? The Lithuanians, before their conversion to Christia∣nity worshipped serpents, every family entertain∣ing one as a household god. Sigismundus, in his commentaries of Muscovy, reports the fol∣lowing incident. A converted Christian having persuaded a neighbour to follow his example, and in token of his conversion to kill his serpent, was surprised at his next visit, to find his convert in the deepest melancholy, bitterly lamenting that he had murdered his god, and that the most dreadful calamities would befal him. Was this
<PB N="277" REF="281"/>
person a Christian more than nominally? At the end of the last century when Kempfer was in Ja∣pan, there remained but about fifty Japan Chri∣stians, who were locked up in prison for life. These poor people knew no more of the Christi∣an religion, but the names only of our Saviour and of the Virgin Mary; and yet so zealous Christians were they, as rather to die miserably in jail, than to renounce the name of Christ, and be set at liberty.</P>
<P>I cannot with satisfaction conclude this sketch, without congratulating my present countrymen of Britain, upon their knowledge of the intimate connection that true religion has with morality. May the importance of that connection, always at heart, excite us to govern every action of our lives by the united principles of morality and re∣ligion:—what a happy people would we be!</P>

<HEAD>SCOTCH ENTAILS considered in Moral and Political views.</HEAD>
<P>MAN is by nature a hoarding animal; and to secure to men what they acquire by honest industry, the sense of property is made a branch of human nature<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book 1. sketch 3.</NOTE>. During the in∣fancy of nations, when artificial wants are un∣known, the hoarding appetite makes no figure. The use of money produced a great change in the human heart. Money having at command the goods of fortune, introduced inequality of rank, luxury, and artificial wants without end. No bounds are set to hoarding, where an appetite for artificial wants is indulged: love of money be∣comes
<PB N="279" REF="283"/>
the ruling passion: it is coveted by many in order to be hoarded; and means are absurdly converted into an end.</P>
<P>The sense of property, weak among savages, ripens gradually till it arrives at maturity in po∣lished nations. In every stage of the progress, some new power is added to property; and now for centuries, men have enjoyed every power over their own goods, that a rational mind can desire<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Historical law tracts, tract 3.</NOTE>: they have the free disposal during life; and even after death by naming an heir. These powers are sufficient for accomplishing e∣very rational purpose: they are sufficient for commerce, and they are sufficient for benevo∣lence. But the artificial wants of men are bound∣less: not content with the full enjoyment of their property during life, nor with the prospect of its being enjoyed by a favourite heir, they are anxi∣ously bent to preserve it to themselves for ever. A man who has amassed a great estate in land, is miserable at the prospect of being obliged to quit his hold: to sooth his diseased fancy, he makes a deed securing it for ever to certain heirs; who must without end bear his name, and pre∣serve his estate entire. Death, it is true, must at last separate him from his idol: it is some con∣solation, however, that his will governs and gives law to every subsequent proprietor. How repugnant to the frail state of man, are such swollen conceptions! Upon these however are founded entails, which have prevailed in many parts of the world, and unhappily at this day in∣fest Scotland. Did entails produce no other harm but the gratification of a distempered appetite for property, they might be endured, though far
<PB N="280" REF="284"/>
from deserving approbation: but, like other transgressions of nature and reason, they are pro∣ductive of much mischief, not only to commerce, but to the very heirs for whose benefit it is pre∣tended that they are made.</P>
<P>Considering that the law of nature has bestow∣ed on man, every power of property that is ne∣cessary either for commerce or for benevolence, how blind was it in the English legislature to add a most irrational power, that of making an en∣tail! But men will always be mending; and when a law-giver ventures to tamper with the laws of nature, he hazards much mischief. We have a pregnant instance above, of an attempt to mend the laws of God, in many absurd regu∣lations for the poor; and that the law authorising entails, is another instance of the same kind, will be evident from what follows.</P>
<P>The mischievous effects of English entails were soon discovered: they occasioned such injustice and oppression, that even the judges ventured to relieve the nations from them, by an artificial form, termed, <HI>fine and recovery.</HI> And yet, though no moderate man would desire more power over his estate than he has by common law, the legi∣slature of Scotland enabled every land-proprietor to fetter his estate for ever; to tyrannize over his heirs; and to reduce their property to a sha∣dow, by prohibiting alienation; and by prohi∣biting the contracting debt, were it even to re∣deem the proprietor from death or slavery. Thus many a man, fonder of his estate than of his wife and children, grudges the use of it to his natural heirs, reducing them to the state of mere life-renters. Behold the consequences. A num∣ber of noblemen and gentlemen among us, lie in wait for every parcel of land that comes to market. Intent upon aggrandizing their family,
<PB N="281" REF="285"/>
or rather their estate, which is the favourite ob∣ject, they secure every purchase by an entail; and the same course will be followed, till no land be left to be purchased. Thus every entailed estate in Scotland becomes in effect a mortmain, admitting additions without end, but absolutely barring any alienation; and if the legislature in∣terpose not, the period is not distant, when all the land in Scotland will be locked up by entails, and withdrawn from commerce.</P>
<P>The purpose of the present essay, is to set be∣fore our legislature, coolly and impartially, the destructive effects of a Scotch entail. I am not so sanguine as to hope, that men, who convert means into an end, and avariciously covet land for its own sake, will be prevailed upon to re∣gard, either the interest of their country or of their posterity: but I would gladly hope, that the legislature may be roused to give attention to a national object of no slight importance.</P>
<P>I begin with effects of a private or domestic nature. To the possessor, an entail is a constant source of discontent, by subverting that liberty and independence, which all men covet, with re∣spect to their goods as well as their persons. What can be more vexatious to a proprietor of a great land-estate, than to be barred from the most laudable acts, suitable provisions for exam∣ple to a wife or children? not to mentiom num∣berless acts of benevolence, that endear indivi∣duals to each other, and make society comforta∣ble. Were he ever so industrious, his fields must lie waste; for what man will lay out his own money upon an estate that is not his own? A great proportion of the land in Scotland is in such a state, that by laying out a thousand pounds or so, an intelligent proprietor may add a hundred pounds yearly to his rent-roll. But an entail ef∣fectually
<PB N="282" REF="286"/>
bars that improvement: it affords the proprietor no credit; and supposing him to have the command of money independent of the estate, he will be ill-fated if he have not means to em∣ploy it more profitably for his own interest. An entail, at the same time, is no better than a trap for an improvident possessor: to avoid altogether the contracting debt, is impracticable; and if a young man be guided more by pleasure than by prudence, which commonly is the case of young men; a vigilant and rapacious substitute, taking advantage of a forfeiting clause, turns him out of possession, and delivers him over to want and misery.</P>
<P>But an entail is productive of consequences still more dismal, even with respect to heirs. A young man upon whom the family estate is en∣tailed, without any power reserved to the father, is not commonly obsequious to advice, nor pati∣ently submissive to the fatigues of education: he abandons himself to pleasure, and indulges his passions without control. In one word, there is no situation more subversive of morals, than that of a young man, bred up from infancy in the certainty of inheriting an opulent fortune.</P>
<P>The condition of the other children, daughters especially, is commonly deplorable. The pro∣prietor of a large entailed estate, leaves at his death children who have acquired a taste for sumptuous living. The sons drop off one by one, and a number of daughters remain, with a scanty provision, or perhaps with none at all. A colla∣teral male heir succeeds, who after a painful search is discovered in some remote corner, qua∣lified to procure bread by the spade or the plough, but entirely unqualified for behaving as master of an opulent fortune. By such a metamorphosis,
<PB N="283" REF="287"/>
the poor man makes a ludicrous figure; while the daughters, reduced to indigence, are in a si∣tuation much more lamentable than are the brats of beggars.</P>
<P>Our entails produce another domestic evil, for which no proper remedy is provided. The sums permitted in most entails to younger children, however adequate when the entail is made, be∣come in time too scanty, by a fall in the value of money, and by increase of luxury; which is pe∣culiarly hard upon daughters of great families: the provisions destined for them will not afford them bread; and they cannot hope to be suitably matched, without a decent fortune. If we ad∣here to entails, nunneries ought to be provided.</P>
<P>But the domestic evils of an entail make no figure compared with those that respect the pub∣lic. These in their full extent would fill a vo∣lume: they are well known; and it may be suf∣ficient to keep them in view by some general hints.</P>
<P>As observed above, few tenants in tail can command money for improvements, however profitable. Such discouragement to agriculture, hurtful to proprietors of entailed estates, is still more so to the public. It is now an established maxim, That a state is powerful in proportion to the product of its land: a nation that feeds its neighbours, can starve them. The quantity of land that is locked up in Scotland by entails, has damped the growing spirit of agriculture. There is not produced sufficiency of corn at home for our own consumption: and our condition will be∣come worse and worse by new entails, till agri∣culture and industry be annihilated. Were the great entailed estates in Scotland, split into small properties of fifty or a hundred pounds yearly
<PB N="284" REF="288"/>
rent, we should soon be enabled, not only to sup∣ply our own markets, but to spare for our neigh∣bours.</P>
<P>In the next place, our entails are no less sub∣versive of commerce than of agriculture. There are numberless land-estates in Scotland of one, two, or three hundred pounds yearly rent. Such an estate cannot afford bare necessaries to the pro∣prietor, if he pretend to live like a gentleman. But he has an excellent resource: let him apply to any branch of trade, his estate will afford him credit for what money he wants. The profit he makes, pays the interest of the money borrowed, with a surplus; and this surplus, added to the rent of his estate, enables him to live comfort∣ably. A number of land-proprietors in such cir∣cumstances, would advance commerce to a great height. But alas! there are not many who have that resource: such is the itch in Scoland for en∣tailing, as even to descend lower than one hun∣dred pounds yearly. Can one behold with pa∣tience, the countenance that is given to selfish wrong-headed people, acting in direct opposition to the prosperity of their country? Commerce is no less hurt in another respect: when our land is withdrawn from commerce by entails, every prosperous trader will desert a country where he can find no land to purchase; for to raise a fami∣ly by acquiring an estate in land, is the ultimate aim of every merchant, and of every man who accumulates money.</P>
<P>Thirdly, An entail is a bitter enemy to popu∣lation. Population is generally proportioned to the number of land-proprietors. A very small portion of land, managed with skill and industry, affords bread to a numerous family; and the great aim of the frugal proprietor, is to provide
<PB N="285" REF="289"/>
a fund for educating his children, and for estab∣lishing them in business. A numerous issue, at the same time, is commonly the lot of the tem∣perate and frugal; because they are strangers to luxury and voluptuousness, which enervate the body, and dry up the sources of procreation. This is no chimera or fond imagination: traverse Europe; compare great capitals with distant provinces; and it will be found to hold univer∣sally, that children abound much more among the industrious poor, than among the luxurious rich. But if division of land into small properties, tend to population; depopulation must be the neces∣sary consequence of an entail, the avowed intent of which is to unite many small properties in one great estate; and consequently, to reduce land-proprietors to a small number.</P>
<P>Let us, in the fourth place, take under consi∣deration, the children of land-holders with re∣spect to education and industry; for unless men be usefully employed, population is of no real advantage to a state. In that respect, great and small estates admit no comparison. Children of great families, accustomed to affluence and luxu∣ry, are too proud for business; and were they even willing, are incapable to drudge at a labo∣rious employment. At the same time, as the father's hands are tied up by his entail from af∣fording them means to subsist as persons of rank, they become a burden on the family, and on the state, and can do no service to either, but by dy∣ing. Yet there are men so blind, or so callous, as to be fond of entails. Let us try whether a more pleasing scene will have any effect upon them. Children of small land-holders, are from infancy educated in a frugal manner; and they must be industrious, as they depend on industry
<PB N="286" REF="290"/>
for bread. Among that class of men, education has its most powerful influence; and upon that class a nation chiefly relies, for its skilful artists and manufacturers, for its lawyers, physicians, divines, and even for its generals and statesmen.</P>
<P>And this leads to consider, in the fifth place, the influence that great and small estates have on manners. Gentlemen of a moderate fortune, connected with their superiors and inferiors, im∣prove society, by spreading kindly affection through the whole members of the state. In such only resides the genuine spirit of liberty, abhorrence equally of servility to superiors and of tyranny to inferiors. The nature of the British government, creates a mutual dependence of the great and small on each other. The great have favours to bestow: the small have many more, by their privilege of electing parliament-men; which obliges men of high rank to affect popula∣rity, if they have none at heart. This connec∣tion produces good manners at least between dif∣ferent ranks, and perhaps some degree of cordia∣lity. Accumulation of land into great estates, produces opposite manners: when all the land in Scotland is swallowed up by a number of gran∣dees, and few gentlemen of the middle rank are left; even the appearance of popularity will va∣nish, leaving pride and insolence on the one hand, and abject servility on the other. In a word, the distribution of land into many shares, accords charmingly with the free spirit of the British con∣stitution; but nothing is more repugnant to that spirit, than overgrown estates in land.</P>
<P>In the sixth place, Arts and sciences can never flourish in a country, where all the land is en∣grossed by a few men. Science will never be cultivated by the dispirited tenant, who can scarce
<PB N="287" REF="291"/>
procure bread; and still less, if possible, by the insolent landlord, who is too self-sufficient for in∣struction. There will be no encouragement for arts: great and opulent proprietors, fostering am∣bitious views, will cling to the seat of govern∣ment, which is far removed from Scotland; and if vanity make them sometimes display their gran∣deur at their country-seats, they will be too deli∣cate for any articles of luxury but what are fo∣reign. The arts and sciences being thus banish∣ed, Scotland will be deserted by every man of spirit who can find bread elsewhere.</P>
<P>In the seventh place, Such overgrown estates will produce an irregular and dangerous influence with respect to the House of Commons. The parliament-boroughs will be subdued by weight of money; and with respect to county-elections, it is a chance if there be left in a county as many land-holders capable to elect, and to be elected, as even to afford a choice. In such circumstan∣ces, will our constitution be in no danger, from the ambitious views of men elevated above others by their vast possessions? Is it unlikely, that such men, taking advantage of public discord, will become an united body of ambitious oppres∣sors, overawing their sovereign as well as their fellow-subjects? Such was the miserable condi∣tion of Britain, while the seudal oligarchy sub∣sisted: such at present is the miserable condition of Poland: and such will be the miserable condi∣tion of Scotland, if the legislature afford not a remedy.</P>
<P>If the public interest only were to be regarded, the axe ought to be applied, cutting down en∣tails to the very root: but a numberless body of substitutes are interested, many of whom would be disinherited, if the tenants in tail had power.
<PB N="288" REF="292"/>
To reconcile as much as possible these opposite in∣terests, it is proposed, that the following articles be authorised by a statute. First, That the act of parliament 1685 be repealed with respect to all future operations. Second, That entails al∣ready made and completed, shall continue effec∣tual to such substitutes as exist at the date of the act proposed; but shall not benefit any substitute born after it. Third, That power be reserved to every proprietor, after the act 1685 is at an end, to settle his estate upon what heirs he thinks proper, and to bar these heirs from altering the order of succession; these powers being inherent in property at common law.</P>
<P>At the same time, the prohibiting entails will avail little, if trust-deeds be permitted in their utmost extent, as in England. And therefore, in order to re-establish the law of nature with re∣spect to land property, a limitation of trust-deeds is necessary. My proposal is, That no trust-deed, directing or limiting the succession of heirs to a land-estate, shall be effectual beyond the life of the heirs in existence at the time.</P>

<HEAD>SKETCH II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Government of ROYAL BOROUGHS in Scotland.</HEAD>
<P>BY a royal borough is in Scotland understood an incorporation that hold their lands of the crown, and are governed by magistrates of their own naming. The administration of the annual revenues of a royal borough, termed the <HI>common good,</HI> is trusted to the magistrates; but not with∣out control. It was originally subjected to the review of the Great Chamberlain; and accord∣ingly the chap. 39. § 45. of the <HI>Iter Camerarii,</HI> contains the following articles, recommended to the Chamberlain to be enquired into. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Giff there be an good assedation and uptaking of the common good of the burgh, and giff faith∣ful compt be made thereof to the community of the burgh; and giff no compt is made, he whom and in quhaes hands it is come, and how it passes by the community."</Q> In pursu∣ance of these instructions, the Chamberlain's precept for holding the ayr, or circuit, is direct∣ed to the provost and bailies, enjoining them, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to call all those who have received any of the town's revenues, or used any office within the
<PB N="290" REF="294"/>
burgh, since the last chamberlain-ayr, to an∣swer such things as shall be laid to their charge."</Q> <HI>Iter Camer. cap.</HI> 1. And in the third chapter, which contains the forms of the chamberlain-ayr, the first thing to be done after fencing the court, is, to call the bailies and serjeants to be challen∣ged and accused from the time of the last ayr.</P>
<P>This office, dangerous by excess of power, being suppressed, the royal boroughs were left in a state of anarchy. The magistracy, being now no longer under any check or control, was covet∣ed by noblemen and gentlemen in the neighbour∣hood; who, under the name of office-bearers, laid their hands on the revenues of the borough, and converted all to their own profit. This cor∣ruption was heavily complained of in the reign of James V.; and a remedy was provided by act 26. parl. 1535, enacting, 1 st, That none be qualified to be provost, bailie, or alderman, but an indwelling burgess. 2dly, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That no inha∣bitant purchase lordship out of burgh, to the terror of his comburgesses. And, 3dly, That all provosts, bailies, and aldermen of boroughs, bring yearly to the chequer at a day certain, the compt-books of their common good, to be seen and considered by the Lords Auditors, giff the same be spended for the common well of the burgh, or not, under the penalty of losing their freedom. And that the said pro∣vosts, bailies, and aldermen, warn yearly, fifteen days before their coming to the che∣quer, all those who are willing to come for examining the said accounts, that they may impugn the same, in order that all murmur may cease in that behalf."</Q> And to enforce these regulations, a brieve was issued from the chancery, commanding the magistrates to present
<PB N="291" REF="295"/>
their accounts to the exchequer, and summoning the burgesses to appear and object to the same.</P>
<P>A defect in this statute made it less effectual than it was intended to be. Magistrates, to a∣void the penalty, brought the count-books of their common good to the exchequer; but they brought no rental of the common good to found a charge against them. This defect was reme∣died by act 28. parl. 1693, containing the follow∣ing preamble. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the royal boroughs, by the male-administration of their magistrates, have fallen under great debts and burdens, to the diminution of their dignity, and the disa∣bling of them to serve the crown and govern∣ment as they ought; and that the care, over∣sight, and control of the common good of bo∣roughs, belong to their Majesties by virtue of their prerogative-royal; therefore, for pre∣venting the like abuses and misapplications in all time thereafter, their Majesties statute and ordain, That every burgh-royal, shall, be∣twixt this and the first of November next, bring to the Lords of Treasury and Exchequer, an exact account of charge and discharge, sub∣scribed by the magistrates and town-clerk, of their whole public-good and revenues, and of the whole debts and incumbrances that affect the same."</Q> This completed the remedy, by putting means into the hands of the Barons of Exchequer, to control the accounts enjoined by the former statute to be yearly given in.</P>
<P>The foregoing regulations are kept in obser∣vance. Every year a precept issues from the ex∣chequer, signed by one of the Barons, addressed to the director of the chancery, requiring him to make out a brieve for every royal borough. The brieve is accordingly made out, returned to the
<PB N="292" REF="296"/>
exchequer, and sent to the several sheriffs, to be served in all the royal boroughs within their bounds, as directed by the statute. These brieves are accordingly so served by the sheriffs; and particularly it is a constant form in most of the royal boroughs, to issue a proclamation, fif∣teen days before the day named for appearance in exchequer, warning the inhabitants to repair there, in order to object to the public accounts of the town: and further, in order to give them opportunity to frame objections, the book and accounts are laid open for these fifteen days, to be inspected by all the inhabitants.</P>
<P>We learn from the records of exchequer, that from the year 1660 to the year 1683, accounts were regularly given in to exchequer, in obedi∣ence to the statute. The town of Edinburgh on∣ly having failed for some short time, Captain Thomas Hamilton merchant there, by an action in exchequer, compelled the magistrates to pro∣duce upon oath their treasurer's accounts, which were accordingly audited. And we also learn, that from the Restoration down to the Union, a clerk to the borough-roll was appointed by the crown, whose proper business it was to examine and audite the accounts of the boroughs.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the foregoing salutary regula∣tions, and the form constantly practised to make them effectual, the boroughs of late years have forborn to present their accounts in exchequer; hoping that they would be overlooked by the English court of exchequer, established in Scot∣land after the Union; which accordingly happen∣ed. This neglect in the court of exchequer is greatly to be regretted, because it reduces the royal boroughs, by the male-administration of their magistrates, to the same miserable condition
<PB N="293" REF="297"/>
that is so loudly complained of in the statutes above mentioned. It is undoubtedly in the pow∣er of the Barons to restore good government to the boroughs, by compelling the magistrates to account yearly in the court of exchequer, accord∣ing to the foregoing regulations. And to that end no more is necessary, but to signify publicly that they are resolved hereafter to put these re∣gulations in execution.</P>
<P>How beneficial that step would be to this coun∣try in general, and to the royal boroughs in par∣ticular, will appear from considering, first, the unhappy consequences that result from suffering magistrates to dispose of the town's revenues, without any check or control; and next the good effects that must result from a regular and care∣ful management, under the inspection of the King's judges.</P>
<P>The unhappy consequences of leaving magis∣trates without any check or control, are too visible to be disguised. The revenues of a royal bo∣rough are seldom laid out for the good of the town, but in making friends to the knot who are in possession of the magistracy; and in rioting and drunkenness, for which every pretext is laid hold of, particularly that of hospitality to stran∣gers. Such mismanagement tends to idleness, and corruption of manners; which accordingly are remarkable in most royal boroughs. Nor is the contagion confined within the town: it com∣monly spreads all around.</P>
<P>Another consequence, no less fatal, of leaving magistrates to act without control, is a strong desire in every licentious burgess, of stepping into the magistracy, for his own sake, and for that of his friends. Hence the factions and animosi∣ties that prevail in almost all the royal boroughs;
<PB N="294" REF="298"/>
which are violently and indecently pursued, without the least regard to the good of the com∣munity.</P>
<P>The greatest evil of all, respects the choice of their representatives in parliament. A habit of riot and intemperance, makes them fit subjects to be corrupted, by every adventurer who is willing to lay out money for purchasing a seat in parlia∣ment. Hence the infamous practice of bribery at elections, which tends not only to corrupt the whole mass of the people, but, which is still more dreadful, tends to fill the House of Com∣mons with men of dissolute manners, void of probity and honour.</P>
<P>But turning from scenes so dismal, let us view the beautiful effects that result, from an adminis∣tration regularly carried on, as directed by the statutes above mentioned. The revenues of the royal boroughs are supposed to be above L. 40,000 yearly. And were this sum, or the half of it, prudently expended, for promoting arts and in∣dustry among the numerous inhabitants of royal boroughs, the benefit, in a country so narrow and poor as Scotland, would be immense: it would tend to population, it would greatly in∣crease industry, manufactures, and commerce, beside augmenting the public revenue. In the next place, as there would be no temptation for designing men to convert the burden of magistra∣cy into a benefit, faction and discord would va∣nish; and there would be no less solicitude to shun the burden, than at present is seen to obtain it. None would submit to the burden but the truly patriotic, men who would chearfully bestow their time, and perhaps their money, upon the pub∣lic; and whose ambition it would be to acquire a
<PB N="295" REF="299"/>
character, by promoting industry, temperance, and honesty, among their fellow-citizens.</P>
<P>And when the government of the royal bo∣roughs comes to be in so good hands, bribery, which corrupts the very vitals of our constitution, will be banished of course. And considering the proper and constitutional dependence of the roy∣al boroughs upon the king's judges, we may have reasonable assurance, that few representatives will be chosen, but who are friends to their coun∣try and to their sovereign.</P>

<HEAD>SKETCH III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Plan for improving and preserving in order the HIGHWAYS in Scotland.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="preface">
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HIghways have in Scotland become a capital ob∣ject of police, by the increase of inland com∣merce, upon which bad roads are a heavy tax. Hap∣pily for our country, no person is ignorant of this truth; and we see with pleasure the fruits of their conviction in various attempts, publick and private, to establish this valuable branch of police upon the best footing. As this will be found no easy task, it may reasonably be hoped, that men of genius will seriously apply themselves to it, and in general that every person will freely produce such hints as occur to them. In the latter view the following plan is offered to the public: and if, from the various pro∣posals that have been or shall be published, an effec∣tive plan can be framed, such as completely to an∣swer its purpose, it may safely be pronounced, that it will produce more benefit to this country, than has been produced by any other single improvement since the union of the two kingdoms.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="plan">
<PB N="297" REF="301"/>
<P N="1">1. THE justices of peace, commissioners of supply, the sheriff or stewart depute, and the first magistrate of royal boroughs, shall be commissioners for making and repairing high∣ways, bridges, and ferries, in the several shires and stewartries. All the powers given by law to the justices of peace, and commissioners of sup∣ply, with respect to highways, bridges, and fer∣ries, shall be transferred to them; and any two shall be a quorum, except where a greater num∣ber is required by this act.</P>
<P N="2">2. The sheriff or stewart depute shall appoint the first day of meeting of the said commission∣ers, as soon as may conveniently be after the date of the act, by an intimation at each parish∣church upon a Sunday at the close of the fore∣noon-service. And the last Tuesday of March shall yearly thereafter be a day of meeting at the head borough of the shire or stewartry, in place of the first or third Tuesday of May appointed by former acts. The commissioners shall ap∣point a preses, convener, and clerk: and they shall be impowered to adjourn themselves from time to time.</P>
<P N="3">3. The commissioners, at their first meeting, shall set about a division of the shire or stewartry into two or more districts, as they see convenient. And if they cannot overtake this work at that meeting, they shall appoint proper persons to form a plan of the intended divisions, which plan shall be reported to the commissioners at their next meeting, in order to be approved or altered by them. This being settled, the commissioners shall appoint the heritors in these several districts, or any three of them, to meet on a certain day and place, to make lists of the whole publick
<PB N="298" REF="302"/>
roads within their respective districts, and to settle the order of reparation, beginning with those that are the most frequented. The pro∣ceedings of these district-meetings must be re∣ported to the commissioners, at their next meet∣ing; who are empowered to settle the order of reparation, in case of variance among the heri∣tors; and also to add any road that may have been omitted. And they shall record a scheme or plan of the whole roads in the shire, thus en∣listed, with their resolutions thereupon, to be seen in the clerk's hands <HI>gratis.</HI> But upon any just cause appearing in the course of administra∣tion, the commissioners shall be empowered to alter or vary this plan, provided it be at a meeting previously appointed for that purpose, and where three fifths at least of the commissioners are pre∣sent.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the sheriff or stewart neglect to appoint the first meeting of the commissioners, he shall incur a penalty of L. 100, upon a summary complaint to the court of session by any one he∣ritor of the shire; with costs of suit, the one half to the plaintiff, and the other half to be ap∣plied by the commissioners for the purposes of this act. If the commissioners fail to meet at the day appointed by the sheriff or stewart, or fail to divide the shire or stewartry into districts, within six months of their first meeting, the sheriff or stewart depute, under the foresaid penalty, shall be bound to do that work himself; and also to appoint the heritors in the several districts, or any three of them, to make lists of the public roads as above mentioned, and to report their resolu∣tions to him; and he is empowered to settle the order of reparation, in case of variance among the heritors. If the heritors fail to meet, and to
<PB N="299" REF="303"/>
make a list of the roads as aforesaid, this work shall be performed by the sheriff or stewart depute him∣self. And he shall be indemnified of whatever ex∣pences he is at in prosecuting the said work, out of the sums that are to be levied by authority of this act, in manner after mentioned, with an additio∣nal sum for his own trouble, to be named by the circuit-judges.</P>
<P N="5">5. No person shall act as a commissioner upon this statute, but who has an estate within the county of L. 200 Scots valuation, or is heir∣presumptive to such an estate, or is named a commissioner <HI>virtute officii,</HI> under the penalty of L. 20 Sterling <HI>toties quoties,</HI> to be prosecuted be∣fore any competent court, by a popular action, with costs of suit; the one half to the plaintiff, the other half to the purposes of this act.</P>
<P N="6">6. Whereas the sum of 10d. directed by the act 1669 to be imposed upon each L. 100 of va∣lued rent, is insufficient for the purposes therein expressed; and whereas the six days statute-work for repairing the highways is in many re∣spects inconvenient; therefore instead of the 10d. and instead of the statute-work, the com∣missioners, together with the heritors possessed of L. 200 Scots of valued rent, five, whether com∣missioners or heritors, making a quorum, shall annually, upon the said last Tuesday of March, assess each heritor in a sum not exceeding</P>
<P>upon each L. 100 valued rent; the assess∣ment imposed on the heritors to be levied by the collector of supply, along with the cess, and by the same legal remedies. The heritors are enti∣tled to relieve themselves of the one half of the said assessment, by laying the same upon their tenants, in proportion to their rents; an heri∣tor being always considered as a tenant of the land he has in his natural possession.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="300" REF="304"/>
7. With respect to boroughs of royalty, regality, and barony, and large trading villa∣ges, the commissioners are empowered to levy from each householder, a sum not exceeding 2 s. yearly, more or less in proportion to the assessment of the shire, to be paid within forty days after notice given, under the penalty of double, besides expence of process. Provided, that any of these householders who have coun∣try farms, by which they contribute to relieve their landlords as above mentioned, shall be ex∣empted from this part of the assessment.</P>
<P N="8">8. If the commissioners and heritors neglect to assess their shire, or name so small a sum as to be an elusory assessment, insufficient to an∣swer the purposes of this act, the court of jus∣ticiary, or the circuit judges, are in that case empowered and required to lay on the highest assessment that is made lawful by this act. In case of a total omission, the commissioners and heritors who, by neglecting to convene with∣out a good cause of absence, have occasioned the said omission, shall be subjected each of them to a penalty of L. 20 Sterling. And to make these penalties effectual, the trustees for fish∣eries and manufactures are appointed to sue for the same before the court of session, and to ap∣ply the same, when recovered, to any useful purpose within the shire, especially to the pur∣poses of this act. And to preserve the said fines entire for the public service, the trustees shall be entitled to costs of suit.</P>
<P N="9">9. The sums levied as aforesaid shall be laid out annually upon the highways, bridges, and ferries, for making, repairing, or improving the same; proceeding regularly with the reparation according to the scheme or plan ordered as above to be settled in each shire and stewartry.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="301" REF="305"/>
10. With respect to roads that are not the first in order, and for which there is no interim provision by this act during reparation of the more frequented roads, the commissioners are impowered to exact from cottars and day-labour∣ers their statute-work according to the acts pre∣sently in force, to be applied to those secondary roads. The statute-work is not to be demanded unless for this purpose; and is to cease totally after the highways have, by means of the pre∣sent act, been once totally repaired.</P>
<P N="11">11. The commissioners and heritors, at all their meetings, shall bear their own charges.</P>
<P N="12">12. The clause in the act 1661, empowering heritors, at the sight of the sheriff, to cast about highways for their convenience, shall be repealed; and it shall be declared unlawful, in time coming, to turn about or change any high∣way, unless for the benefit of the public, as by shortening it, carrying it through firmer ground, or making it more level; and to that purpose the commissioners shall be impowered to turn about highways, as also to widen the same, not exceeding thirty feet, free of ditches. But the commissioners shall have no power to carry a road through any house, garden, or∣chard, or pleasure-ground.</P>
<P N="13">13. The commissioners shall have power to take from the adjacent lands, stones, sand, gra∣vel, or other materials for making the highways, paying always for the damage done.</P>
<P N="14">14. With respect to high-roads which bound the properties of neighbouring heritors, and which it may be found necessary to alter or wid∣en, the commissioners shall be empowered to adjudge to one heritor any small bits of ground cut off from the other by the road so altered;
<PB N="302" REF="306"/>
and if land cannot be given for land, to make a compensation in money, valuing the land at the current price of the country.</P>
<P N="15">15. In order to prevent water stagnating on the highways, the commissioners shall be impow∣ered to make ditches or drains through neigh∣bouring grounds; and such ditches or drains shall be preserved entire by the proprietors of the land, or at their charges.</P>
<P N="16">16. As the aforesaid assessment, after repair∣ing the highways, may not be sufficient for build∣ing bridges, or making ferries, where rivers are large; any five of the commissioners may, for building bridges, or making ferries, establish a pontage or toll; so much for horses, so much for horned cattle, and so much for sheep, and the double for each beast in a wheel-carriage. Upon the credit of the toll the said commissioners may borrow money, to be employed wholly upon the bridge or ferry where the toll is gathered. But before borrowing the money, an estimate must be made of the expence of the work. After the work is finished, the sum bestowed on it must be ascertained: an accurate account must be kept of the gradual payment of this sum by the toll; and when it is completely paid, the commissioners must declare the bridge or ferry to be free.</P>
<P N="17">17. The determinations of the commissioners shall be final, unless complained of in manner following.</P>
<P N="18">18. If any heritor apprehend that undue pre∣ference is given to a certain highway, or con∣ceive himself aggrieved by an order or sentence of the commissioners, it shall be lawful for him, within forty days of the act complained of, to enter a complaint in the court of session; and the
<PB N="303" REF="307"/>
judgment upon such complaint shall be final. But such complaint shall only be effectual for da∣mages, and shall not stay execution of the work. At the same time, no complaint shall be admitted till security be given to pay full costs, in case the plaintiff be found in the wrong.</P>
<P N="19">19. Former laws concerning highways, brid∣ges, or ferries, to continue in force, unless as far as altered by this act.</P>
<P N="20">20. An annual state of what is done by virtue of this act, made up by the commissioners, or their clerk, shall, before the last Tuesday of March, be laid before the trustees for fisheries and manufactures, in order to be made a part of their annual report to the King; and these trus∣tees shall direct proper persons to inspect what work is done upon the high-roads, and in what manner. Upon any misapplication or embezzle∣ment of the money levied, any neglect in levy∣ing, or any wrong done to the public, contrary to the intention of this act, the trustees are re∣quired to set on foot and prosecute what redress is competent in law or equity, provided the prosecution be commenced within a year after the offence.</P>

<PB N="304" REF="308"/>
<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS on the preceding PLAN.</HEAD>
<P>THE laws in Scotland relating to this branch of public police, are numerous; some en∣acted while Scotland was a separate kingdom, some after its union with England. It is not the purpose of this paper to enter into a detail of the various regulations established by these laws: they are generally known; and in the late abridgment of our statute-law, they are all recapitulated with brevity and precision. It shall suffice cursorily to observe, that the acts made during the reign of Charles II. form the ground-work of our regulations concerning highways: the latter acts are little more than explanatory of the former.</P>
<P>It seems to have been the plan of the legisla∣ture, that highways should be repaired by those who are employed in husbandry; and ac∣cordingly, the six days annual labour is, in the statutes of Charles II. imposed upon them only.</P>
<P>This was a measure not ill suited to the state of Scotland at that period. During the last century, we had little inland commerce to re∣quire
<PB N="305" REF="309"/>
good roads, except that of corn carried to market; and for that reason, it was natural to impose upon husbandmen the burden of re∣pairing highways. These persons, at the same time, passing the whole summer in idleness, unless when called to perform personal services to capricious and unfeeling landlords, could not think it a hardship to have some part of their time employed in serving themselves instead of their landlords.</P>
<P>That annual labour upon highways, limited to a few days, should be required from men in that condition, appears not unjust. And why may we not suppose the legislature at that time capable of such enlarged views, as to prefer this method for repairing highways, in order to bring on gradually a habit of labour and indu∣stry? But the condition of Scotland at pre∣sent differs widely from what it was in the reign of Charles II.; and the regulations for repairing highways which were then proper, have, by alteration of circumstances, become both unjust and inexpedient.</P>
<P>Unjust they have become in a high degree. Inland commerce, which begins to flourish in Scotland, is greatly promoted by good roads; and every dealer, and indeed every traveller, profits by them. But no men are less interested in good roads than day-labourers, or those who are commonly called <HI>cottars;</HI> and yet these chiefly are burdened with the reparation. Such men, at the same time having commonly many children, find it difficult to support their fami∣lies, even with their utmost industry. No∣thing can be more unjust, than to impose up∣on such men an annual tax of six days labour for repairing roads, the goodness of which
<PB N="306" REF="310"/>
contributes little or nothing to their conveni∣ence.</P>
<P>Our present laws are inexpedient, as well as unjust. In the first place, a tax of this na∣ture discourages the propagation of children, in which the strength of a state consists: the poor labourer ought to be encouraged with a reward, instead of being discouraged with a tax. In the next place, cottars called out to perform the statute-work, obey with reluct∣ance, and trifle away time without doing any thing effectual. To enforce the law, and to compel such men to labour, is grievous to the gentlemen who are empowered to execute the law: they cannot punish with rigour or firm∣ness, men who have so good reason to decline the service: they are soon disgusted with be∣ing taskmasters, and the generality desist alto∣gether.</P>
<P>Laws concerning private property are always kept in observance, and they execute them∣selves, as is commonly expressed, because there are always a multitude of individuals strongly interested to have them executed. But in making public laws, the great difficul∣ty has ever been, to lay down effectual mea∣sures for putting them in execution; and by what means to make such laws execute them∣selves, is one of the most intricate problems in politics. Our laws concerning highways, are eminently defective in that respect: and accordingly, though most of them have exist∣ed near a century, they never have at any pe∣riod been executed to any extent. Take the following specimen, among many that may be urged, of this defect. Overseers are forced into service under a penalty, in order to com∣pel
<PB N="307" REF="311"/>
the peasants to perform faithfully their six-days labour. To hope any good from a reluc∣tant overseer set over a set of reluctant labou∣rers, is a fond conceit: it is much if his re∣sentment tempt him not to encourage their idleness. In vain would we expect, that any overseer, without a suitable reward, will ex∣ert himself in promoting the work.</P>
<P>To remedy the hardship of laying the bur∣den of reparation upon those who are least¦able and least benefited, and at the same time to make this remedy effectual, is the purpose of the foregoing plan. And upon considering the matter in its different views, the only me∣thod that promises success, appears to be a county-tax laid upon land according to the va∣luation, and a capitation-tax on the inha∣bitants of boroughs. These taxes relieve the labouring poor, and lay the burden where it ought to be laid: and the law will execute it∣self, if that effect can be hoped from any pub∣lic law. Effectual measures are laid down for levying the tax: and, if once levied, there is no danger of its being allowed to lie unem∣ployed in the hands of the collector; for eve∣ry heritor will be anxious to have some part employed for his benefit. The danger will rather be of factious disputes about the distri∣bution. This danger also is attempted to be prevented; and, it is hoped, with success.</P>
<P>Some narrow-minded persons may possibly grudge a tax, that loads the present generation for the advantage of those who come after: but is it rational to grudge, that others should benefit by measures evidently calculated for advancing our own interest? Let us suppose, that the heritors of a shire were to concert
<PB N="308" REF="312"/>
measures in common, for improving their lands: to make good roads would be one effec∣tual measure; for supposing the reparation to cost L. 5000, their estates would be bettered double that sum.</P>
<P>To conclude: It is not to be expected that any regulations concerning highways, or con∣cerning any branch of police, can be so fram∣ed as to please every individual. Wise men are practicable men, to use an expression of Lord Bacon, and will make concessions in or∣der to promote a general good, if without such concessions it cannot be obtained. Better far to have a good law, though in our opinion defective in some articles, than to have no law at all, or, which is worse, a law eminently de∣fective, unjust, and inexpedient.</P>
