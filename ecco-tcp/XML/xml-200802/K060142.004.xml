<HEAD>I. A brief Geographical Account of <HI>Scotland.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>SCOTLAND</HI> is bounded on the North by the <HI>Irish</HI> Sea and <HI>England,</HI> from which it is divided by <HI>Solway Firth,</HI> and the Rivers <HI>Esk</HI> and <HI>Kexsop</HI>; on the West Border, by the <HI>Cheviot</HI> Hills in the <HI>Middle Marches</HI>; and by the lower Parts of the <HI>Tweed,</HI> on the East Border. On the East it is bounded by the <HI>German</HI> Sea; on the North by the <HI>Deucaledonian</HI> Sea; and on the West, by the great Western Ocean.</P>
<P>Its greatest Length from <HI>Dungsby-head</HI> or <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Grot</HI>'s-<HI>house</HI> in <HI>Caithness,</HI> to the <HI>Mull</HI> of <HI>Gal∣loway</HI> towards <HI>Ireland,</HI> is no more than about 215 <HI>Scots</HI> Miles; but if we reckon directly North from
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
<HI>Dumfries,</HI> or the said <HI>Mull</HI> of <HI>Galloway,</HI> to the ut∣most Parts of <HI>Caithness,</HI> or <HI>Strathnavern,</HI> the Length will not be so much; and less still, if we reckon from <HI>Berwick</HI> to either of these Places.</P>
<P>Its Breadth, from the Point of <HI>Ard-na-murchan</HI> near the Isle of <HI>Mull,</HI> about the middle Part of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the West, to <HI>Buchan-ness</HI> in the East Parts, towards the North, is about 140 <HI>Scots</HI> Miles; but the Sea running up into the Land, or the Land thrusting out into the Sea in many Places, makes the Breadth of it every-where else very various and dis∣proportionable; for in the South Parts it is seldom 100 Miles over, and in the North Parts, beyond <HI>In∣verness,</HI> not so many; so that there is no House above 40 or 45 Miles from salt Water.</P>
<P>Besides the main Land, there are about 300 Islands, some of them very considerable, which may be di∣stinguished into several Classes: The Western Islands called <HI>Hebrides,</HI> or <HI>Aebudae,</HI> by <HI>Latin</HI> Authors; the <HI>Orcades,</HI> or <HI>Orkney</HI> Islands: the Islands of <HI>Shetland,</HI> or <HI>Zetland,</HI> and some few in the Firth of <HI>Forth.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Country abounds in Lakes and Rivers, many whereof running into Creeks and Arms of the Sea, (which in several Places are very wide and deep) afford great and commodious Opportunities for Fishing and Shipping: But 'tis much to be regretted, that the Land is neither cultivated, nor the Fishing and Shipping carried on and improved, to so much Advantage as might be expected.</P>
<P>Tho' the Soil is not generally so level and fruitful as that of <HI>England,</HI> yet the South Parts of <HI>Scotland</HI> are far more pleasant than, and preferable to, the North Parts of <HI>England</HI>; and there are every∣where all Things necessary for human Life: And not only sufficient for the Inhabitants, but also to export and exchange for such foreign Commodities as the People want, and to return considerable Sums.</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
<HEAD>II. Of the most remarkable Lakes and Rivers in <HI>Scotland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE most remarkable Lakes in <HI>Scotland</HI> are <HI>Loch-tay,</HI> and <HI>Loch-ness,</HI> and <HI>Loch-levin:</HI> Which all send forth Rivers of the same Name with themselves: <HI>Loch-lomond,</HI> which sends forth the River of <HI>Lo∣mond</HI>; and <HI>Loch-iern,</HI> which sends the River <HI>Iern.</HI> 'Tis observed, that <HI>Loch-ness, Loch-tay,</HI> and <HI>Loch-iern,</HI> seldom freeze.</P>
<P><HI>Loch-myrton</HI> in <HI>Galloway</HI> is another, and remark∣able for this, That one Part of it generally freezes in the Winter-season, and the other Part seldom does.</P>
<P>There is a <HI>Loch</HI> in <HI>Straith-errach,</HI> in the Lord <HI>Lovat</HI>'s Lands, which never freezes, however severe the Frost be, till <HI>February</HI>; and then, in one Night's time, it freezes all over; and if the Frost continue two Nights, the Ice grows very thick. There is a Lake of the same Nature call'd <HI>Lochmonar,</HI> in the Earl of <HI>Cromarty</HI>'s Lands in the North; and there is another Lake in <HI>Straglash,</HI> at a Place call'd <HI>Glencanich,</HI> in a high Ground betwixt the Tops of two Mountains, the middle of which Lake is always frozen through∣out the Summer, notwithstanding the strong Re∣flexions of the Sun-beams from the Mountains, which melt the Ice at the Sides of the Lake. The Ground round the Lake has a constant Verdure, as if there were a perpetual Spring; and Cattle grow sooner fat by that Grass than any-where else: And this is so much the more remarkable, that there are several other Lakes in the Neighbourhood, of as high a Situation, wherein no such thing is seen.</P>
<P>In <HI>Linlithgowshire</HI> is a Lake call'd <HI>Loch-coat Lough,</HI> from whence a Stream runs under a neigh∣bouring Mountain, the Murmur of which is heard among the Stones; and after it has run thus under
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
Ground for about two hundred Paces, it issues with great Force from a Fountain about three Feet broad, and forms a Stream which turns a Water-mill.</P>
<P>For the Conveniency of Trade and Fishing, there are so many Inlets of the Sea, that there is scarce any Part of it, as I have said, above 40 Miles distant from some Bay, Creek, or Arm of the Ocean; and these afford many Harbours, several of them very good, and capable of receiving Men of War, and Ships of the greatest Burden.</P>
<P>The principal Rivers in <HI>Scotland</HI> are TAY, which divides it in the Middle, and running by <HI>Scone, Perth,</HI> and <HI>Dundee,</HI> empties itself into the <HI>German</HI> Ocean. In the Southern Parts, the FORTH and TWEED run into the same; CLYDE runs into the Western Sea; as ESK, ANNAND, NITH, KEN, DEE, and CREE, do into the <HI>Irish.</HI> In the North, DEE and DON run into the <HI>German</HI> Ocean, as SPEY and NESS do into <HI>Murray</HI> Firth.</P>
<P>The most convenient for Trade are TAY, which is navigable to <HI>Perth</HI>; FORTH and CLYDE, which, if join'd by a Canal, near the Place where the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> formerly built their Wall of about 30 Miles long, to defend their Province from the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts,</HI> would open a Communication betwixt the East and West Seas, to the great Advancement of the Commerce of the whole Island. There was much Talk of it about the Time of the <HI>Union</HI>; but as it would undoubtedly be attended with very great Charges, and other Difficulties, the Project seems to be laid quite aside.</P>
<P>I am the briefer in my Account of the Lakes and Rivers in <HI>Scotland,</HI> because I shall be obliged to be more particular upon them in their respective Places.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
<HEAD>III. Of the Fisheries in <HI>Scotland,</HI> include∣ing that of Pearls.</HEAD>
<P>THE Salmon-fishery is particularly the Boast and Delight of the <HI>Scots</HI>; insomuch that for it they too much neglect all the rest.</P>
<P>Their SALMON are accounted the best in <HI>Europe,</HI> and tho' their Barrels be a Third less than that of <HI>Berwick,</HI> yet they have yielded 10 Livres more <HI>per</HI> Barrel, in <HI>France</HI>; partly because of their Goodness, and partly because better cured, wherein the Magi∣strates and Town-council of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> take a very particular Care. Salmon abound not only in the navigable Rivers of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but in those which are less, in most Parts of the Kingdom; and they valued them so much formerly, that in several of their old Acts of Parliament they forbad selling them to <HI>England,</HI> except for Gold. <HI>Clyde</HI> abounds with Salmon, for which the Town of <HI>Renfrew</HI> has been famous; and Bishop <HI>Lesley,</HI> in his Description of <HI>Scotland,</HI> says, They used, in his Time, to em∣ploy sixty Vessels in Fishing most of Spring and Sum∣mer; but 'tis much short of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> where the same Author says, the Rivers <HI>Dee</HI> and <HI>Don</HI> exceed all those of the Kingdom for Number and Goodness of Salmon: For which he assigns this Reason, That they delight in clear Streams, which occasions our Rivers in <HI>Scotland</HI> to abound more with Salmon than those of other Countries where the Rivers are more muddy. The other Places, most remarkable for Sal∣mon-fishing in <HI>Scotland,</HI> are in the <HI>Dovern</HI> at <HI>Bamf,</HI> the Rivers <HI>Nesse, Nairn, Findorn, Lossey</HI> and <HI>Spey</HI> in <HI>Murray</HI>; the latter abounds with Salmon for 60 Miles together. <HI>Lochlomond</HI> in <HI>Lenox</HI> is remark∣able for Salmon of an excellent Taste, <HI>Loch-ou</HI> in <HI>Argyll,</HI> the like: And there is good Salmon-fishing in the Rivers <HI>Lough</HI> and <HI>Speynie</HI> in <HI>Lochaber,</HI> in the
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Bay of <HI>Cromarty,</HI> near <HI>Dingwal</HI> Castle, and in the Rivers <HI>Tay</HI> and <HI>Tweed,</HI> and other smaller Rivers in the bordering Counties. They have marl'd or speckled Salmon in <HI>Harries, North-vist</HI> and <HI>Benbecula.</HI> And in the Isle of <HI>Sky,</HI> there are no less than 30 Rivers all abounding with Salmon.</P>
<P>As to their COD-fishing, Mr. <HI>Spruel</HI> (an eminent <HI>Scots</HI> Merchant, who laid an Account of the Pro∣duct of the Kingdom for Trade before their Parlia∣ment, some Years ago) says, he was inform'd by a <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Man, who use to buy those Fish and Salt on the <HI>Scots</HI> Coast, that he has sometimes got four thousand cur'd Fish in a Voyage, at 1<HI>d.</HI> or 2<HI>d.</HI> apiece, and retail'd them again from 18<HI>d.</HI> to 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> apiece; which shews what vast Advantage might be made of this Trade, since the <HI>Scots</HI> Cod are reckon'd as good or better than those of <HI>Newfoundland.</HI> And what contibutes much to the Cheapness of this and the Herring-fishery in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is, that they are caught with fewer Hands, and Vessels of far less Expence, than Doggers, which must be well mann'd and strong, because oblig'd to lie at Sea; whereas the <HI>Scots</HI> catch those Fish in their own Creeks, Bays and Harbours, where few Hands and open Vessels are for the most part sufficient, because they are seldom exposed to any Danger by Storms, being al∣ways near the Shore, and laid up at Night.</P>
<P>HERRINGS abound on all the Coasts of the King∣dom, but especially on the Western Isles, which are reckon'd the best and fattest, tho' not so large as those taken on the Eastern and Northern Coasts. The <HI>Scots</HI> Herring-fishing is accounted the best in the World, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> have got a great Part of their Wealth by it.</P>
<P>A Fishery was attempted in the Isles by King <HI>Charles</HI> I. in Conjunction with some Merchants; and a Magazine was erected for that Use in <HI>Hermetra,</HI> one of the <HI>Harries</HI> Islands, and another in the Isle of
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
<HI>Vacksay</HI>; but the unhappy Civil War coming on, it was not prosecuted. It was renew'd by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and succeeded well for a Time: The Fish they caught were accounted the best in <HI>Europe,</HI> and yielded a Price accordingly; but the King with∣drawing his Money afterwards, to supply his pressing Occasions, the Merchants were displeased at it, and differing among themselves, did also withdraw theirs; which ruin'd the Design.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Dutch</HI> Families settled in the Village of <HI>Stornway,</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Lewes,</HI> soon after that Prince's Restoration; and so much improved the In∣habitants in the Fishing Trade, during the small Time of their Abode there, that they still exceed all those of the neighbouring Isles and Continent; they brought the Natives a great deal of Money likewise, for their Sea and Land-Fowl: But King <HI>Charles</HI> II. being prevail'd on to send away the <HI>Dutch,</HI> it was a great Loss to the Country.</P>
<P>Herrings are sometimes bought in the Isles for 6<HI>d. per</HI> Barrel, and when cured and sent abroad, yield from 25 to 40<HI>s. per</HI> Barrel; and sometimes 36000 Barrels of white Herrings have been exported to <HI>France</HI> from <HI>Clyde</HI> in a Season, besides what were exported from <HI>Dunbar,</HI> and other Parts of the King∣dom, to <HI>France,</HI> and other Nations; which may serve as a Specimen to shew how capable that Trade is of Improvement, especially considering the Situa∣tion of the West of <HI>Scotland</HI> and the Isles, from whence they may be a Month sooner at Market with them, than from any Part of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI>; which, with the Advantage of taking and curing them cheaper and sooner than the <HI>Dutch</HI> can possibly do, considering how far they have to sail backward and forward, what Risques they run at Sea, and what Numbers of Tenders they are obliged to send to and again betwixt their own Country, and their Doggers with Provisions, Salt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they might soon be out∣done
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
in that profitable Trade by the Inhabitants of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who may lie ashore at Night, and land their Fish as soon as caught, without any Dan∣ger from Tempests or Enemies; many of those Bays where the Herring abound, being very safe for Ships to ride in.</P>
<P><HI>Whales</HI> in abundance frequent the Islands of <HI>Flad∣den, Orkney</HI> and <HI>Lewes:</HI> One hundred and fourteen run ashore on the Island of <HI>Orkney</HI> at one time, in the Year 1691.</P>
<P><HI>Cod, Tusk,</HI> and <HI>Ling,</HI> are caught in vast Plenty upon all their Coasts.</P>
<P><HI>Haddocks, Sturgeon, Turbut, Trouts, Perch, Pike, Scate, Greyberd, Maycril, Keeling, Whiting, Sea-urchin, Cat-fish, Cockpadle, Lyths, Spirlings, Soles, Flukes, Garvie, Eels,</HI> are also caught on the <HI>Scotish</HI> Coasts in great Plenty, for Home-consumption.</P>
<P><HI>Otters,</HI> whose Skins are useful for Muffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are very numerous in the Isles.</P>
<P>Shell-fish of all sorts, as <HI>Lobsters, Crabs, Oysters,</HI> are also found in vast Quantities in the Western Islands; the latter so large, that they must be cut in three or four Pieces, to be eaten.</P>
<P><HI>Cockles, Muscles, Limpets, Wilks, Scollops,</HI> and <HI>Spouts,</HI> are cast up by the Tide in such Numbers on the Isles, that the People cannot consume them.</P>
<P>PEARL being the Product of Fish, it is proper to discourse of the <HI>Scots</HI> Pearl here. Mr. <HI>Spruel,</HI> the Merchant above-mentioned, who understood the Pearl-trade best of any Man in that Kingdom, having dealt in it above forty Years, says, He has sometimes given a hundred Rixdollars, which is near 25<HI>l.</HI> for one <HI>Scots</HI> Pearl; and that he had <HI>Scots</HI> Pearl as fine, clear, and more transparent, than any Oriental Pearl. Tho' the latter be more easily match'd, because they are all of a yellow Water, yet Foreigners covet <HI>Scots</HI> Pearl. The more Wrinkles there are in a Pearl-shell, the more Sign it is of the
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
Age and Goodness of a Pearl; for the smooth Shells are young and barren: Therefore he proposed, that a Law should be made to forbid the Fishing of young Pearl; for the longer they stay in the Water, the more valuable they are: So that he would have no Shells taken up less than four Inches in Length, or two or three in Breadth; and that none should be allowed to offer any Pearl to be sold, that weighs less than five Grains; which is as reasonable as Laws to prevent the taking of the young Fry of Salmon, since Pearl are of much more Value. And that they might have Time to grow and increase, he proposes, That Pearl-fishing should be forbid, except once in ten Years at least; because he has been sorry to see some Thousands of young Pearls offer'd to Sale, that were of no manner of Value; whereas, had they lain in the Waters their due Time, they might have been worth from four to fifty Crowns apiece.</P>
<P>Pearl is found in most Places of the Nation where Salmon are taken; and once in twenty Years, he says, there is a great Pearl-fishing in <HI>Scotland.</HI> This does not hinder, but that Pearl-shells of the Size he proposes, or larger, may be taken up at any time when found; and these are probably to be had among the unfrequented Isles.</P>
<P>Particular Places where Pearl abound, are the Rivers in the Isle of <HI>Skye,</HI> where they are frequently found in black Muscles, especially in the Rivers <HI>Kilmartin</HI> and <HI>Ord,</HI> where Pearls have lately been found of 20<HI>l. per</HI> Piece; and in a fresh-water Lake near the South-side of <HI>Loch-einardstad.</HI> In that same Island there are also Muscles that breed Pearl.</P>
<P>Tho' the small Pearl be not so useful for Orna∣ment, yet they may be of very good Use in Physick, and make a fine Article in the Apothecary's Bills, being reputed the chief of all Cordials, and very good against the Plague, violent and pestilential Fe∣vers, Fluxes, Heart-burning, Giddiness of the Head,
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
Trembling of the Heart, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is sufficient to shew, that the Pearl-fishery well deserves Encourage∣ment, since we may be supply'd with it much cheaper at Home, than from the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="account">
<HEAD>IV. Of the Cattle, Horses, Fowls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of <HI>Scotland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Country in general abounds in Flocks of Sheep, and Herds of Cattle; which are gene∣rally black, except in Corn-soils, where they sel∣dom breed or keep any more than are necessary for the Plough or the Pail. But 'tis observable, that such as are bred in the Corn-countries, are much larger than those bred in other Parts, and equal in Size to those bred in some Parts of <HI>England,</HI> even where the Land seems to be better.</P>
<P>In general, their Sheep and Cattle are much smaller than those of <HI>England,</HI> especially in Pasture-lands; yet are they of a far sweeter and more de∣licious Taste. The <HI>Highlanders</HI> bring great Num∣bers of them yearly into the Lowlands, where some are fatted; but the Bulk of them, and also many of those bred in the Lowlands, are sent into divers Parts of <HI>England,</HI> especially to <HI>St. Faith's</HI> near <HI>Nor∣wich,</HI> where they turn out to good Account; as I have observed in its Place.</P>
<P>They have also very many <HI>Hogs,</HI> and an in∣credible Number of <HI>Goats,</HI> particularly in the North and Highlands; the latter they eat themselves, but the former they pickle and export, as they likewise do vast Quantities of <HI>salt Beef.</HI></P>
<P>In the Southern Counties there are no <HI>Deer,</HI> ex∣cept in Gentlemens Parks; but every-where else, they are in great Plenty.</P>
<P>They breed great Numbers of <HI>Horses,</HI> especially in <HI>Galloway</HI> and the <HI>Highlands</HI>; small indeed, but capable of great Fatigue, especially if we consider,
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
that they are not only more proper for the Saddle, and other Uses in that Country, which, being hilly, will not admit, in many Places, of Teams and Carriages; but are more hardy than Horses of a larger Size, and will thrive upon what would starve great Horses. Nevertheless, in many Places of the <HI>Lowlands</HI> they can breed Horses fit for War, Coach, or Carriage.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> has not only Plenty of <HI>domestick Fowl,</HI> such as are common to other Countries; but many that are peculiar to themselves, especially in the Islands, where they are in such Multitudes as the Inhabitants can neither consume nor vend half of them; but their Trade for them will still increase, as it has done since the <HI>Union.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>Fowl</HI> and <HI>Eggs</HI> afford a large Fund of Trade for Food, and their <HI>Feathers</HI> for Bedding and other Uses: Their Fat is made use of by the Inhabitants not only in many Cases where Oil is necessary, but likewise for Physick.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="account">
<HEAD>V. Of the Linen and Woollen Manufa∣ctures of <HI>Scotland.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>FLAX</HI> abounds in <HI>Scotland,</HI> so that besides what they consume themselves, they export great Quan∣tities of <HI>Linen,</HI> brown and whitened; which is one of the greatest Manufactures of the Kingdom, and, if duly regulated and encouraged, as it is more and more since the <HI>Union,</HI> might save a great deal of Money in the Island, besides what it may bring in to it; for the <HI>Scots</HI> have improved their <HI>Linen Manufacture</HI> much of late; and besides fine Linen, make very good <HI>Holland, Cambrick, Muslins</HI> plain and striped, <HI>Ca∣licoes, Damask, Ticken</HI> for Beds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> white and dyed <HI>Threads, Laces, Tape,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Spruel</HI> (in his <HI>Account current betwixt</HI> Scotland <HI>and</HI> England) says, He has known, out of a Pound
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
of Flax of <HI>Scots</HI> Growth, which cost but 12<HI>d.</HI> six Spangles of fine Yarn spun, which was sold at <HI>Glas∣gow</HI> at about 4<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d. per</HI> Spangle; which made the Product of that 12<HI>d.</HI> to the Spinners 28<HI>s.</HI> and, made into fine Muslin, that same Pound of Flax amounted to 10 or 12 Dollars, which is 2<HI>l.</HI> 16<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> or 2<HI>l.</HI> 16<HI>s.</HI> the Charges of Weaving and Whitening de∣ducted. He adds, That from one Pound of <HI>Scots</HI> Flax, Lace-makers have made <HI>Lace</HI> to the Value of 8<HI>l.</HI> Sterling; which is sufficient to shew how much the Linen Manufacture may be improv'd there, and how many poor Women, who are not capable of employing themselves otherwise, may get a Liveli∣hood by it, and what Money it may bring into the Nation.</P>
<P>Their HEMP is also capable of being improved, not only to save Money in the Island, which is exported for <HI>Canvas, Sailcloth,</HI> &amp;c. but also to export, and to make <HI>Nets</HI> for their Fishery, and other Uses.</P>
<P>The numerous and large Flocks of Sheep they have in <HI>Scotland</HI> produce abundance of WOOL, from whence come Manufactures of several Sorts; as <HI>Broad-cloth, Coarse</HI> or <HI>Housewife's-cloth, Fingrims, Serges, Bays, Crapes, Temmin,</HI> Glasgow <HI>Plaids, Worsted Camblets,</HI> and other Stuffs and <HI>Stockens</HI> for Home-consumption and Export; besides their <HI>Tallow</HI> and <HI>Skins.</HI> Their Wool in general is not so good as that of <HI>England</HI>; yet they have brought their Broad-cloth lately to a great Perfection, but can never equal <HI>England</HI> in that Part of Woollen Manu∣facture: Nevertheless it is very proper for <HI>Serges, Bays, Camblets, Shaloons,</HI> and other Stuffs; and by due Regulation is capable of great Improvement for a foreign Trade. They are come to a great Perfection in making <HI>Stuffs</HI>; and for <HI>Plaids,</HI> I shall observe by-and-by, they exceed all the World.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15"/>An Instance of what great Improvement may be made of their Wool, we have from Mr. <HI>Spruel</HI> (in his <HI>Account current</HI>); <HI>viz.</HI> That they make such fine Worsted Stockens at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> that they yield 10, 15, 20, and 30<HI>s.</HI> a Pair for Womens Stockens; which is sufficient to shew, that they are capable of making Stockens at lower Rates, especially consider∣ing that they have store of very good Wool brought thither from the Highlands and Isles; which because sold at the Cross of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> is commonly called <HI>Cross-Wool.</HI> The most remarkable Places besides in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for good Wool, are <HI>Galloway</HI> and <HI>Tweedale</HI>; from which great Improvement might be made in <HI>Bays, Serges</HI> and <HI>Shaloons.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> Plaids are a Manufacture in which they exceed all Nations, as I have said, both as to Colour and Fineness. They have of late been pretty much fansied in <HI>England,</HI> for <HI>Beds, Hangings, Window-curtains,</HI> and <HI>Night-gowns,</HI> for both Sexes; so that Attempts have been made at <HI>Norwich</HI> to imitate them; but they fall much short of the <HI>Scots</HI> in Co∣lour, Fineness, and Workmanship, as is evident at first Sight. Their greatest Trade for their Woollen Manufactures, and other Commodities, has for many Years been with the <HI>United Netherlands,</HI> where they have a <HI>Conservator,</HI> who serves both for a Consul and Envoy, to take care of the Affairs of their Trade, being part of the antient Privileges they enjoyed by Treaties with the Dukes of <HI>Burgundy</HI> and others, when Sovereigns of the <HI>Netherlands.</HI> From this Trade the Towns of <HI>Rotterdam</HI> and <HI>Ter-veer</HI> have acquired considerable Wealth; in Return for which, the <HI>Scots</HI> have been always well esteemed in those Provinces; and the States allow them Churches, and Maintenance for their Ministers.</P>

<HEAD>VI. Of the Grain and Pulse of <HI>Scotland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE WHEAT of <HI>Scotland</HI> is so excellent, that <HI>Joseph Scaliger,</HI> who had been in the Country, says, No Bread in <HI>Europe</HI> is comparable to what is made of it, for Whiteness, Lightness, and easy Digestion. It abounds in the <HI>Mers, Lothian, Ga∣vrie,</HI> &amp;c. so that they have not only enough for their own Consumption, but for Exportation.</P>
<P>OATS are the most universal Grain of the King∣dom, and exceed those in <HI>England,</HI> for all Uses. They grow very well every-where, and in such Quantities as afford a considerable Fund for Export, both in Grain and Meal, and make very good Bread and Drink.</P>
<P>PEASE they have in great Plenty, both for their own Consumption, and for Exportation; and they are so good of the Kind, that in some Parts of the Country the labouring Husbandmen make good nourishing Bread of them.</P>
<P>BEANS they have also in great plenty for their own Use, and for Export.</P>
<P>BARLEY grows likewise very well in <HI>Scotland</HI>; but they sow more of that Sort they call <HI>Beer,</HI> which has four Rows of Grain upon an Ear; whereas Barley has but two: Of this they make good <HI>Bread, Broth, Ale,</HI> and <HI>Beer,</HI> and export great Quantities.</P>
<P>RYE grows also very well in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and makes good Bread; but this they don't cultivate so much as they do the Grains above-mentioned.</P>

<P>THE most remarkable Mountains of <HI>Scotland</HI> are the <HI>Grampian</HI> Mountains, which run from East to West, from near <HI>Aberdeen</HI> to <HI>Cowal</HI> in <HI>Argyllshire,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
almost the whole Breadth of the Kingdom, famous for the Battle fought on them betwixt the <HI>Romans</HI> and the ancient <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Caledonians,</HI> under the Conduct of <HI>Galgacus,</HI> as we find in <HI>Tacitus.</HI> The next most remarkable Chain of Mountains are those of <HI>Lam∣mermoor,</HI> which run from the Eastern Coast in the <HI>Mers</HI> a great way West. Next to these are <HI>Pentland</HI> Hills, which run thro' <HI>Lothian,</HI> and join the Moun∣tains of <HI>Tweedale</HI>; and these again are join'd by others, which run thro' the whole Breadth of the Island. Other remarkable Mountains are those called <HI>Cheviot</HI> Hills, in the Border betwixt the two King∣doms: <HI>Drumbenderlaw</HI> and <HI>North-Berwicklaw,</HI> both in <HI>East-Lothian; Arthur</HI>'s-<HI>seat</HI> in <HI>Mid-Lothian; Cairn-apple</HI> in <HI>West-Lothian; Tentock</HI> in <HI>Clydsdale; Brinmore</HI> in <HI>Argyll</HI>; the <HI>Ochel</HI> Mountains in <HI>Perth∣shire</HI>; the <HI>Lowmonds</HI> and <HI>Largolaw</HI> in <HI>Fife</HI>; in <HI>An∣gus, Dundeelaw,</HI> and Part of the <HI>Grampians</HI>; in <HI>Caithness, Ord</HI>; and, in the <HI>Orkney</HI> Islands, the Mountains of <HI>Hoy.</HI></P>
<P>There are many large Woods of OAK in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which afford Materials for <HI>Building</HI> and <HI>Shipping,</HI> and for the Husbandman's Use; and the Country is very improveable this way, if Planting were more encouraged; however, they have at present not only such as are fit for the Uses above-mentioned, but also for <HI>Pipe-staves</HI> and <HI>Barrels</HI>; and their <HI>Bark</HI> is of Use to the <HI>Tanners,</HI> great Quantities of which are annually exported to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and elsewhere. They have likewise ASH Trees, ELMS, and others, fit for <HI>Building,</HI> and other <HI>domestick</HI> Uses; and great Forests of FIR, which afford Materials for <HI>Building</HI> and <HI>Shipping</HI>; and might, with due Care, afford <HI>Pitch</HI> and <HI>Tar,</HI> without being obliged to bring such large Quantities from the <HI>Northern</HI> Countries, as is usually done by the Inhabitants of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>There were formerly many great Woods in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> among which the Forest of <HI>Caledonia</HI> was

famous; but there are now scarce any Remains of it.</P>
<P>The Woods are more rare than formerly in the Southern Parts of the Kingdom; of which the most remarkable now left are those of <HI>Hamilton, Ca∣lendar,</HI> and <HI>Torwood:</HI> But in the North, especially in <HI>Perthshire, Lochaber, Badenoch,</HI> and <HI>Mar,</HI> there are many Forests, some of them 20, and some 30 Miles in Length.</P>
<P>They have abundance of <HI>Fruit-trees</HI> of all Sorts, in their Gardens and Orchards, and might, by Im∣provement, not only have sufficient to afford them Fruit for Home-consumption, but also Cyder for their own Drinking and Export.</P>

<HEAD>VIII. Of the Medicinal Waters, Fountains, Springs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE more remarkable Medicinal Fountains in <HI>Scotland</HI> are <HI>Moffat Wells,</HI> which spring from the Top of a Rock near the Town of that Name in <HI>Annandale.</HI> The Wells are two in Number, near one another; the higher Well runs through whitish and crystalline Stones, and the lower through black ones, resembling Marcasites of Antimony: The Smell of the Water is like that of Gunpowder, and it dyes Silver of a black Colour. To the Stones of the upper Well grows a Matter resembling stinking Sul∣phur of Antimony, of a yellowish red Colour; the Stones of the lower Well are of the Colour of An∣timony, and some of them contain a metallick Mat∣ter, that sparkles like Antimony. Where the Stream of the lower Well runs down into a neighbouring Brook, there sticks to the Rock a whitish Salt, and perhaps a nitrous Matter, which has the diuretick Virtue of the Water. Those Waters also purge by Stool and Vomit, and are very good against Colick and Nephritick Pains, because they powerfully re∣move
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
the Obstructions of the Bowels. They are outwardly applied to Ulcers, and against Pains in the Joints; they are strongest in their Operation in the driest Season of the Summer and Autumn, but are not so good in a rainy, or in the Winter-season.</P>
<P><HI>Mahon</HI>'s <HI>Well,</HI> near St. <HI>Mahon</HI>'s Church, has the same Virtue, but does not operate so strongly; and there is a Well of the same Nature discover'd not many Years ago at <HI>Hallyards,</HI> within six Miles of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Kinghorne</HI> a very clear and cold Water flows from the Clefts of a Rock, which quickly passes through the Body; is of excellent Use for recovering a lost Appetite, and against the Gravel and Stone; it is outwardly applied to watry and itching Eyes, and against Redness and Pimples in the Face: The fa∣mous Dr. <HI>P. Anderson</HI> wrote upon its Usefulness. There flows also from the same Rock a whitish vis∣cid Liquor, which is an excellent Cosmetick.</P>
<P><HI>Arthrey Well,</HI> two Miles North of <HI>Stirling,</HI> flows from a Mountain; where is a Copper Mine, with some Mixture of Gold and Silver: The Water is very cold, and being tinctur'd with the Minerals it flows through, is of Use against outward Distempers.</P>
<P>In <HI>Glenelg,</HI> at a Place called <HI>Achignigle,</HI> is a Stream which turns Holly into a greenish Stone of which they make Moulds for casting Musket-bullets, and Melting-pots for melting Brass, and other Metals, and Whirls for Womens Spindles.</P>
<P>There is a petrifying Fountain near the Castle of <HI>Slaine,</HI> the Water of which, dropping from a natural Cave, presently turns into Pyramids of Stones, which are brittle, and make good Lime; there is another in <HI>Hamilton</HI> Wood, the Stones made by which re∣semble putrid Moss.</P>
<P>At <HI>Monkton,</HI> near <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> is a Well, called <HI>The routing Well</HI>; because of the Noise it makes be∣fore Tempests, from the Part of the Well which
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
looks to that Quarter of the Sky, from whence the Tempest is to blow.</P>
<P>There is another on the West-side of <HI>Campsey</HI> Hills, which divides <HI>Stirlingshire</HI> from <HI>Lenox</HI>; whose Water makes People drunk.</P>

<HEAD>X. Of the Customs, Manners, Language, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the <HI>Scots.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Scots</HI> are divided into HIGHLANDERS, who call themselves the antient <HI>Scots</HI>; and into LOWLANDERS, who are a Mixture of antient <HI>Scots, Picts, Britons, French, English, Danes, Germans, Hungarians,</HI> and others.</P>
<P><HI>Buchanan</HI> describes the Customs of the <HI>High∣landers</HI> graphically thus: In their Diet, Apparel, and Houshold-furniture they follow the Parsimony of the Ancients; they provide their Diet by Fishing and Hunting, and boil their Flesh in the Paunch or Skin of a Beast: While they hunt, they eat it raw, after having squeez'd out the Blood. Their Drink is the Broth of boil'd Meat, or Whey they keep some Years, and drink it plentifully in their Enter∣tainments; but most of them drink Water. Their Bread is of <HI>Oats</HI> and <HI>Barley,</HI> the only Grain pro∣duced in their Country, which they prepare very artfully: They eat a little of it in the Morning, and contenting themselves with that, hunt, or go about their Business without eating any more till Night. They delight most in Cloaths of several Colours, especially strip'd; the Colours they affect most, are Purple and Blue. Their Ancestors, as do most of them still, made use of Plaids very much variegated; but now they make them rather of dark Colours, resembling that of the Crops of Heath, that they may not be discovered while they lie in the Heaths waiting for their Game. Being rather wrapped up than co∣vered with those Plaids, they endure all the Rigours of the Seasons, and sometimes sleep covered all over
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
with Snow. At Home they lie upon the Ground, having under them Fern or Heath (covered with a Sheet or Blanket); the latter laid with the Roots undermost, so as it is almost equal to Feathers for Softness, but much more healthful; for the Quality of Heath being to draw out superfluous Humours, when they lie down weary and faint upon it at Night, they rise fresh and vigorous in the Morning. They affect this hard way of sleeping; and if at any time they come into other Places of the Country, where there is better Accommodation, they pull the Coverings off the Bed, and lie down upon them wrapped in their Plaids, lest they should be spoiled by this barbarous Effeminacy, as they call it.</P>
<P>The LOWLANDERS partake much of the Temper of the People, of whom we have mentioned them to be composed, but most resemble the <HI>French,</HI> oc∣casioned by the long League betwixt the two Na∣tions, their mutual Commerce, frequent Intermar∣riages, and Custom of travelling into <HI>France</HI> to study the Law, and other Sciences, and by their affecting to serve in the <HI>French</HI> Armies. But since the Union of the Crowns, the <HI>English</HI> Customs, and Way of Living, have obtained much in the <HI>Lowlands,</HI> where the <HI>English</HI> Tongue has been their natural Language for above 600 Years; but still retains more ancient <HI>Saxon</HI> and <HI>French.</HI> This being extraordinary, and perhaps singular, that a foreign Language should prevail in a Country altogether independent of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and where the Inhabitants are of another Lineage, and maintained such fierce and long Wars to preserve their distinct Sovereignty; the <HI>Scotish</HI> An∣tiquaries and Historians give the following Reasons of it:<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The frequent <HI>Saxon</HI> Auxiliaries sent to assist the <HI>Picts</HI> against the <HI>Scots,</HI> which occasion'd many of those <HI>Saxons</HI> to settle in the <HI>Lowlands</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> then possessed by the <HI>Picts.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="22" REF="23"/>2. The last considerable Effort made by the <HI>Picts,</HI> in Conjunction with the <HI>English,</HI> to recover their Country against <HI>Donald</HI> V. of <HI>Scotland</HI>; who, after he had defeated the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Picts</HI> upon the River <HI>Jedd</HI> in <HI>Tiviotdale,</HI> neglecting to improve his Vi∣ctory, was afterwards surprised by them near <HI>Berwick,</HI> and taken Prisoner after a great Slaughter of his Men. Upon this Success, the <HI>English,</HI> under the Conduct of <HI>Osbreth</HI> and <HI>Ella,</HI> possessed themselves of the Country as far as <HI>Dumbarton,</HI> without restoring the <HI>Picts</HI>; the major Part of which retired to <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> and the Remainder were cut off by the <HI>English,</HI> to prevent their calling in Foreigners. Thus the <HI>English</HI> continued in Possession of that Part of the Country, from the Year 858, till about the Year 875; when King <HI>Gregory the Great</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> recovered the Country; and the <HI>Scotish</HI> Proprietors, the Possession of their Estates: But willingly entertained the <HI>English</HI> Commonalty and Husbandmen, who were as desirous to stay, their own Country being, at that time, infested by the <HI>Danes</HI>; and they rather chose to be under the Do∣minion of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who were Christians, than under that of the <HI>Danes,</HI> who were Pagans.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Great Numbers of the <HI>English</HI> came into <HI>Scot∣land</HI> to assist King <HI>Malcolm</HI> III. against the Usurper <HI>Macbeth,</HI> whom he rewarded after his Victory with Possessions in <HI>Scotland.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. A great many <HI>English</HI> came to <HI>Scotland</HI> after the <HI>Norman</HI> Conquest, with <HI>Edgar Atheling,</HI> and his Sister <HI>Margaret,</HI> who was afterwards married to King <HI>Malcolm</HI> above-mentioned; which makes the Reasons of the <HI>Scots</HI> Historians for the prevailing of the <HI>English</HI> Language in the Lowlands of <HI>Scotland,</HI> very probable.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>It has been gaining Ground upon the old <HI>Scots</HI> Language ever since, which is now confined to the Highlands and the Isles, where most of those of
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
Note do also understand <HI>English:</HI> Tho' about 100 Years ago, the old People in <HI>Galloway</HI> generally understood the <HI>Erse</HI> or ancient <HI>Scots</HI> Language, which is now worn quite out.</P>

<HEAD>XI. Of the Religion and Ecclesiastical Government of <HI>Scotland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Estabished Religion</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> since the Revolution, and confirmed by the Act of <HI>Union,</HI> is what is called <HI>The Presbyterian</HI>; being a Church Government by <HI>Pastors, Teachers, Elders,</HI> and <HI>Deacons.</HI> Before the Revolution, the Church was govern'd by Bishops; but they not coming so readily into the new Settlement, as the Presbyterians did, were abolished.</P>
<P>The Ecclesiastical Courts, as they now stand, are Four; <HI>viz.</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>Kirk Session,</HI> consisting of the Minister, Elders, and Deacons in each Parish, who consider the Affairs of the Parish as a Religious Society. They judge in all Matters of lesser Scandals, can suspend from the Communion, and regulate all Par∣ticulars relating to publick Worship and the Poor.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The <HI>Presbytery,</HI> which consists of the Minister, and one Elder, from five to ten, twelve or more neighbouring Parishes, who chuse one of these Mi∣nisters to be Praeses or Moderator. Here are tried Appeals from the Kirk Sessions; and here they in∣spect into the Behaviour of the Ministers and Elders within their respective Bounds. They supply vacant Parishes, ordain Pastors, examine and license School-masters, and young Students, for probationary Preachers; and judge when, or on whom, to inflict the greater Excommunication.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The <HI>Provincial Synod.</HI> This is composed of all the Members of several adjacent Presbyteries. It meets twice a Year at some principal Place
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
within its Bounds: Is open'd by a Sermon. Their Business is to receive Correspondents from the neigh∣bouring Synods, who are a Check upon one an∣other; to determine Appeals from the <HI>Presbyteries</HI> in their District; to inquire into, and censure the Behaviour of the Presbyteries themselves. They likewise have Power to transport or remove a Mi∣nister from one Place to another; which often oc∣casions great Disturbance. Hence lie Appeals, how∣ever, to</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The <HI>General Assembly,</HI> the highest Ecclesiastical Power in the Kingdom, in which presides a Lord-Commissioner, a Man of the first Quality, as a Representative of the King's Person. All the Mem∣bers of this are annually elected: and the last Mo∣derator opens the new Sessions with a Sermon.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The same Discipline, as to the main of the several Forms and Proceedings, was observed in the Episco∣pal Times, only they had no Lay-Elders; the Bishop, or his Deputy, being a Minister, or Ministers, within the Bounds, presided in all Presbyteries and Diocesan Synods, as the Archbishop of <HI>St. Andrews</HI> did in the National or General Assemblies. For it must be observed, that Episcopacy in <HI>Scotland</HI> dif∣fered from the same Thing in <HI>England</HI>; for here it was as low as the Nature of an Episcopal Church could admit. The Bishops were <HI>sine quibus non</HI>; they had no Lay-chancellors, but did all Things <HI>Presbyterorum Consilio.</HI></P>
<P>The Number of Churches in <HI>Scotland</HI> since the Reformation, is much less than it was before. How∣ever, there are none now of peculiar or exempt Jurisdiction. They are about 950, beside some few Chapels, which make up 68 Presbyteries, included in 13 <HI>Provincial Synods,</HI> which formerly were divided into <HI>two Provinces,</HI> under two Archbishops, and twelve Bishops, as follow:

<P>THE Order of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> or the <HI>Thistle,</HI> by reason of its great Antiquity, and memorable Institution, is, upon all Occasions, called, <HI>The most Antient and most Noble Order of the Thistle,</HI> being founded, as all the <HI>Scots</HI> Historians assert, by <HI>Achaius</HI> the 65th King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> after a signal Victory obtained over the <HI>Saxons, Anno</HI> 819. and dedicated to St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> the Patron or tutelar Saint of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>This Order came at length to shine forth in fuller Splendor in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> V. who was himself a most splendid and magnificent Prince. He caused the Collar of the Order to be composed of two antient Badges or Symbols of the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts</HI>; <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Thistle,</HI> and <HI>Sprigs</HI> of <HI>Rue</HI>; but about the Time of the Reformation it fell into Desuetude, and was scarcely used by the Knights then; being so very zealous for the Reformed Religion, that they left their Order where they laid down their Popery, and it was never after reassumed till the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> VII. who, for the better regulating of the Order in all its Proceedings, signed a Body of Sta∣tutes, and appointed the Knights Brethren to wear the Image of St. <HI>Andrew</HI> upon a blue watered tabby Ribband; and likewise named the Royal Chapel, or Abbey Church of <HI>Holy-rood-house,</HI> to be the Chapel of the Order (the old Church of <HI>St. Andrews</HI> being ruined at the Reformation); for which End it was put in excellent Repair, but was divested of all its beau∣tiful Ornaments by a furious Rabble at the late Revolution.</P>
<P>Her late Majesty Queen <HI>Anne</HI> was pleased to re∣vive the said Order upon the 31st of <HI>December</HI> 1703. and signed a Body of Statutes, wherein the Colour
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
of the Ribband was charged from Blue to Green, to make a Distinction between this Order, and that of the <HI>Garter:</HI> all which Statut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the late King <HI>George</HI> I. was pleased to confirm, with some additional ones, among which, was that of adding Rays of Glory to surround the whole Figure of <HI>St. Andrew,</HI> which hangs at the Collar. And tho' from the Time of the Reformation, both Elections and Installments had been dispensed with, his Majesty was pleased to order, that for the future Chapters for Election shall be held in the Royal Presence; to which End he commanded the great Wardrobe to provide the Knights Brethren, and Officers of the Order, with such Mantles, as are appointed by the Statutes of the Order.</P>

<HEAD>XIII. Of the Civil Government of <HI>Scotland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>College of Justice,</HI> commonly called, <HI>The Sessions,</HI> consists of a President, and Fourteen fix'd Senators or Judges, called <HI>Ordinary Lords of Session,</HI> and Two Extraordinary Lords; and they have Seven Clerks of Session, and Six other inferior Officers. Before this Court all civil Causes are tried at stated Times. And they determine Causes by Acts of Parliament, and the Custom of the Nation; and where these are defective, they determine according to the Imperial and Civil Law, not according to the Rigour of the Letter, but according to Equity and Justice. There lies no Appeal from this Court, but to the Parliament; and the Presence of Nine Judges is required to make their Decree valid. The Parlia∣ment has full Power to affirm or reverse, with Costs not exceeding 200<HI>l.</HI> Sterling.</P>
<P>This Court has distributive Justice only, both in Law and Equity; but no Authority as to Life or Limb, unless for some Faults competent to them∣selves. Since the Union, Lords of Session are ap∣pointed
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
a Committee for planting of Churches, and Valuation of Tythes.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Justiciary,</HI> commonly called, <HI>The Justice</HI> or <HI>Criminal Court,</HI> consists of Five Lords of the Session, and the Justice-General and Justice-Clerk. They try all Crimes. All Prosecutions in this Court are raised by the King's Advocate; and the greatest Traitor is, here, allow'd Advocates to plead for him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Court of Exchequer</HI> was established in pur∣suance of the <HI>Act of Union,</HI> in the 6th Year of Queen <HI>Anne</HI>; and has the same Power, Authority, Privi∣lege, and Jurisdiction of the Revenue of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as the Court of Exchequer in <HI>England</HI> has over the Revenues there. The Judges have also the Power of passing Signatures, Gifts, and Tutories, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Court consists of a Chief, and Four other Barons; and it has Two Remembrancers, a Clerk of the Pipe, Attorneys, Auditors, and other Officers.</P>
<P>The Officers of State are:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Keeper of the Seal, and his Officers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Lord Privy-Seal, and his Officers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Lord Clerk-Register, and his Officers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Lord Advocate.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>Faculty of Advocates</HI> enjoy many and great Privileges with the rest of the College of Justice; and have a Dean, a Treasurer, Clerk, Curator, and other Officers.</P>
<P><HI>Writers of the Signet</HI> are those who subscribe all Writs and Summons's that pass the Signet; and they, as well as the Advocates, are capable of being made ordinary Lords.</P>
<P>Besides the above National Judges, every particular County or Shire has a chief Magistrate, or his Depute, ordinary Judge in all Cases Civil and Cri∣minal; but there lies an Appeal from this Magi∣strate, in most Cases, to the Session and Court of Justiciary.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31"/>The <HI>Sheriff</HI> is, in effect, the supreme Justice of Peace, to whom the Law principally intrusts the securing the Quiet and Tranquillity of the Part of the Kingdom of which he is Sheriff. King <HI>James</HI> VI. and King <HI>Charles</HI> I. bought in some, and de∣signed to buy in all the rest, of these heretable She∣riffalties; but most of them yet remain in the great Families of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Bailiffs, Stewards, and Constables, in their re∣spective Districts, have the same Liberty as Sheriffs in their Shires.</P>
<P>There are Three Sorts of Burghs; <HI>viz. Burghs Royal, Burghs of Regality,</HI> and <HI>Burghs of Barony</HI>; every one whereof is a Corporation, and holds Courts, tho' only the Royal Burghs send Members to Parliament.</P>
<P>The <HI>Royal Burghs</HI> are one intire Body, govern'd by, and accountable to, one general Court, called, <HI>The Convention of Burrows,</HI> which is annually held generally at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and have Cognizance of all Matters relating to the Trade and Interest of all the Burghs in general.</P>
<P><HI>Regalities</HI> are Fews granted by the King to some particular Subjects, whose Authority and Jurisdiction are very large and extensive, both in Civil and Cri∣minal Cases; and the Lord, or his Baillie, has not only the Power of <HI>Furca &amp; Fossa,</HI> Pit and Gallows, but a Jurisdiction with the Magistrate <HI>in Civilibus.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>Burghs of Barony,</HI> every one that holds a Barony of the Crown, has a Court wherein lesser Causes, both Civil and Criminal, are tried, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Commissariot Courts</HI> are a kind of Ecclesia∣stical Courts. The Commissaries of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> who are Four, particularly try Causes of Matrimony and Adultery, in order to a plenary Divorce, not only <HI>à thoro &amp; mensâ,</HI> but even <HI>à vinculo matrimonii</HI>; so that the innocent Party may marry, as if the offend∣ing Party were naturally dead.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32"/>The <HI>Court of Admiralty</HI> is a supreme Court, in all the Causes competent to its own Jurisdiction; and the Lord High-Admiral is the King's Lieutenant and Justice-General upon the Seas, and in all Ports, Harbours and Creeks of the same, and upon fresh Water and navigable Rivers below the first Bridge, or within Flood-mark. And no Appeal lies to the Court of Session for Maritime Matters. All Maritime Causes, Crimes, Faults, Trespasses, Quar∣rels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are triable before the Lord-Admiral's Judge, (for he himself never judges in Person) by the Civil Law and Customs of <HI>Scotland.</HI> Neverthe∣less, there are some particular Jurisdictions of Ad∣miralty hereditary in some great Families; as the Duke of <HI>Argyll,</HI> who is Admiral of the <HI>Western Isles</HI>; the Earl of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> of the Shire of that Name; the Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Zet∣land,</HI> &amp;c. And such Men of War as come up the Firth of <HI>Forth,</HI> for guarding and securing the Coasts, receive Orders from the Lord-Provost of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>By the 6th of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> Justices of Peace are established in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with the same Authority as those in <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>FROM the foregoing Particulars you will perceive, Sir, that this Part of the united Kingdom is far from being so inconsiderable a Country as some would have it thought, who know nothing of the Matter, and give themselves the Licence of making National Reflections; an ungenerous Vice, to which the <HI>English</HI> are but two much addicted, as well with regard to <HI>this</HI> as a <HI>neighbouring Kingdom,</HI> and a still nearer <HI>Principality.</HI> You will observe, that there are but few Things wanting to make <HI>Scotland</HI> as populous, and as full of Trade, Shipping, and Wealth, in proportion, as most, if not the best, Counties in <HI>England.</HI> Those few Things, indeed, are very difficult, if not impossible, to be obtained, as Things stand; particularly,

<ITEM>1. A Change in the Disposition of the common People, from a Desire of Travelling Abroad, to an industrious and diligent Application to Labour at Home.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Stock and Substance to encourage that Applica∣tion. Sloth is not a Disease of the Nation. The <HI>Scots</HI> are as diligent, as industrious, as apt for Labour and Business, and as capable of it, when they are Abroad, as any People in the World; and why should they not be so at Home?

<HEAD>LETTER II. CONTAINING A Description of the <HI>Merse,</HI> the Two <HI>Lothians,</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh, Leith,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> AM just now entered <HI>Scotland</HI> by the ordinary Way of <HI>Berwick,</HI> which stands on the North Side of the River <HI>Tweed,</HI> and has a Bridge by which it is joined to <HI>Northumberland.</HI> It was originally a <HI>Scots</HI> Town, and is to this Day no Part of <HI>England</HI>; but has divers distinct Customs and Privileges, and is mentioned in all Statutes and Pro∣clamations as a Place or Liberty of itself, distinct from <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales.</HI> It was formerly the chief Town of the <HI>Merse,</HI> which to this Day is called the Shire of <HI>Berwick.</HI> It was often taken from, and retaken by the <HI>Scots</HI>; but the last time it fell into the <HI>English</HI> Hands, which was long before the Union of the Two Crowns in the Person of King <HI>James</HI> VI. they fortified it more strongly than it had been formerly, and manned it with a sufficient Garison, so that all the Attempts of the <HI>Scots</HI> to regain it afterwards, proved ineffectual. It is a Place of no extraordinary
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
Trade, tho' a great Thorough-fare. It has but one Church, which is under the Jurisdiction of the Bishop, and in the Gift of the Dean and Chapter of <HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as we get out of the Town, we enter on <HI>Scots</HI> Ground, tho', in Times of War, it used to be part of what was called <HI>Debateable Land,</HI> and on that Account but thinly inhabited; for the Borderers of each Kingdom often made Inroads on one another, notwithstanding that a great Number of Men, at an incredible Trouble and Expence, kept Watch every Night; besides which, there were Watch-towers all along the Borders at proper Distances, and several Laws relating to the Borders made by Commissioners from both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>The first Thing we observed was the Sea on the Right-hand, and the River <HI>Tweed,</HI> which fetches a Reach Northward, on the Left. The Land between lies so high, that in stormy Weather 'tis very bleak and unpleasant, having little or no Shelter: How∣ever, the Land, compared to what we left in <HI>Northum∣berland,</HI> or what we soon found farther in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is good.</P>
<P>The first Town in <HI>Scotland</HI> is <HI>Mordington,</HI> a poor sorry Village; yet gives the Title of Lord to a Branch of the noble Family of <HI>Douglas.</HI> The present Lord lives in <HI>England,</HI> and is so well known, that I need say no more of him.</P>
<P>From the Brow of a very high and steep Hill, we had a large View into <HI>Scotland</HI>; but we were wel∣comed to it by such a Gust of Wind, that it obliged us to quit our Horses in real Apprehension of being blown off; besides, the Wind blowing full North, and the Road turning toward the same Quarter, it blew directly in our Faces. I can truly say, I never was sensible of so exceeding keen and sharp a Cold; for it pierced our very Eyes, so that we could scarcely keep them open.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45"/>When we went down the Hill, the first Town we came to is almost as perfectly <HI>Scots,</HI> as if you were an hundred Miles North of <HI>Edinburgh</HI>; and there is very little Appearance of any thing <HI>English</HI> there, either in Customs, Habits, Usages of the People, or in their way of Living, Eating, or Behaviour. And there are very few <HI>English</HI> Familes to be found among them.</P>
<P>On the contrary, you have in <HI>England</HI> abundance of <HI>Scots</HI> Men, <HI>Scots</HI> Customs, Words, Habits, and Usages; nay, even the Buildings in the Towns and Villages all over <HI>Northumberland</HI> imitate the <HI>Scots</HI>; witness their building their Houses with the Stairs going up to the second Story on the Outside of the House, that one Family may live below, and an∣other above, without going in at the same Door (which is the <HI>Scots</HI> way of Living); as you may see in <HI>Alnwick, Wirkworth,</HI> and several other Towns; witness also their setting their Corn in great Numbers of small Stacks without Doors, not making use of Barns, but only a particular Building, which they call a Barn, tho' no more than a Threshing-floor, into which they rake one of these small Stacks at a time, and thresh it out.</P>
<P>The first Town is called <HI>Ayton,</HI> from the small River <HI>Ay,</HI> on whose Bank it stands. The Church was ruin∣ous, and quite destitute of a Roof. The Heritors being of different Opinions, contributed not a little to the Dilapidation. Such as were episcopally inclined were very backward in contributing their Share, and the Presbyterians thought it hard the Whole should lie upon them; so that, between the two, the Roof fell to the Ground. However, the Minister preached in a Barn to the Generality of the Parishioners, and such as were otherwise inclined, heard Episcopal Ministers in the Houses of some of the neighbouring Gentry.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="46"/>About Three Miles farther East is a small Harbour, with a Town called <HI>Eymouth, Aymouth,</HI> or <HI>Haymouth,</HI> where a Fort was formerly raised to curb the Garison of <HI>Berwick.</HI> This Town gave Title of Baron to the late Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>; but the Patent being granted only to him, and the Heirs-male of his own Body, the Honour extinguished with him. It is a good Fishing-town, and affords a good Harbour for Fishing-vessels. In Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, the <HI>French</HI> held it, and fortified it, as it was the first Port in <HI>Scotland</HI> they could safely land their Supplies at, for the Queen-mother; but they were obliged to quit that, and the Kingdom, some time after, by a Treaty, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> supporting the Reformers against her.</P>
<P>From this Bridge we enter upon a most desolate, and, in Winter, frightful Moor for Travellers, espe∣cially Strangers, called <HI>Coldingham Moor,</HI> upon which, for about Eight Miles, you hardly see a Hedge or a Tree, and you meet with but one House all the Way, and that not a House of Entertainment.</P>
<P><HI>Coldingham,</HI> whence this Moor derives its Name, was an old Monastery, built by <HI>Edgar,</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> about the Year 1100, and famous for its Lady Abbess <HI>Ebba,</HI> of whom they tell us the follow∣ing Story.</P>
<P>This Lady was the Daughter of <HI>Edelfred,</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland</HI>; and, when her Father was taken Prisoner by the Pagan <HI>Mercians,</HI> she got into a Boat in the <HI>Humber,</HI> with three other Women, and, by their own Prayers only, were miraculously preserved, and carried as far as <HI>Scotland,</HI> where, under a Pro∣montory, they were driven on Shore by a Storm, and their Boat dashed in Pieces.</P>
<P>When they got ashore, they laboured with their Hands, and made themselves a little Hut to lodge in; they continued their religious way of Living, and the Country People sustained them with Food; till at
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>
length, acquiring a great Character by their San∣ctity and Austerity, they were addressed to far and near for their Prayers; and, by the Charity of the People, got enough to build a religious House at <HI>Coldingham.</HI></P>
<P>Here, as Fame says, when the cruel <HI>Danes</HI> came on Shore, the religious Lady (who, it seems, was very beautiful too!) cut off her Nose and upper Lip, and made all her Nuns do the same, in order to pre∣serve their Chastity. Whereupon the barbarous <HI>Danes,</HI> enraged at their Zeal, fired their Nunnery, and burnt them all alive. From this Lady, who, it is said, was sainted for these Sufferings, the Promontory where she landed is to this Day called <HI>St. Ebbe's Head,</HI> and vulgarly, by our Sailors, <HI>St. Tabbe's.</HI> There was once, upon the Point of this Promontory, a strong Fort called <HI>Fast-castle,</HI> belonging to the Earl of <HI>Hume</HI>; but it has been some time demolished.</P>
<P>A little to the North-west is the Town and Castle of <HI>Duns,</HI> remarkable for the Birth of <HI>John Duns Scotus, Anno</HI> 1274. some of whose Family are still in Being there. He was a Frier Minor, and the greatest Scholar of his Age. <HI>Scaliger</HI> says, there was nothing his Genius was not capable of. But his chief Study was in Points more nice than necessary, whereupon he was called <HI>Doctor Subtilis.</HI> His Fol∣lowers, called <HI>Scotists,</HI> were great Opposers of the <HI>Thomists,</HI> another Set of Scholasticks, so named from <HI>Thomas Aquinas.</HI> He studied at <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI> and died of an Apoplexy at <HI>Cologn.</HI> After <HI>Berwick</HI> was taken by the <HI>English,</HI> the Sheriff-Court was kept here, which was but lately removed to a Mar∣ket-town, called <HI>Greenlow</HI>; which is also a Royal Burgh, and the principal in the Shire, belonging to the Earl of <HI>Marchmont.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Duns</HI> was also remarkable for the Encampment of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Army, under General <HI>Lesley,</HI> assembled to oppose King <HI>Charles</HI> I. when he came to the
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
<HI>English</HI> Borders with an Army, to <HI>persuade</HI> that Kingdom to Obedience. It has the best weekly Market for Cattle in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and is a Place of the best Trade in this County.</P>
<P><HI>Coldstream</HI> is also a Market-town, in this County of <HI>Merse,</HI> where was antiently an Abbey. <HI>Eccles</HI> likewise had another: and <HI>Ersilton</HI> is noted for the Birth-place of the Rhyming Poet <HI>Lermouth,</HI> so much admired by the Vulgar <HI>Scots. Hume</HI> was formerly the Residence of the Earls of that Name, which they derived from the Town, and they had a strong Castle there, now demolish'd.</P>
<P>The inconsiderate Vanity of the ancient <HI>Scotish</HI> Gentry and Nobility, of deriving their Names from the Places of their Residence, had this Inconvenience attending it, that in a few Generations, it lost the old Name of the Family from which these <HI>Changelings</HI> (may I, without Affront, call them?) descended. Thus the <HI>Dunbars</HI> and <HI>Humes,</HI> originally the same, came to be thought two distinct ones. In like man∣ner, the <HI>Gordons, Swintons, Ridpaths, Nisbets,</HI> and the <HI>Spotswoods,</HI> as some say, tho' all of the same Original, must have lost the Knowledge of it, had it not been for Tradition, or the Armorial Bearings of the several Families, which bespeak them to be of the same Lineage. This Hint may serve once for all, as to those Families called of <HI>that Ilk</HI>; <HI>i. e.</HI> whose Surname and paternal Estate, are the same, and are generally esteemed ancient and honourable.</P>
<P>The County of <HI>Merse,</HI> or <HI>March,</HI> formerly gave Title of Earls of <HI>March,</HI> to the Family of <HI>Dunbar,</HI> who, according to <HI>Camden,</HI> derived their Origin from the famous <HI>Gospatrick,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who retired into <HI>Scotland</HI> on the <HI>Norman</HI> Conquest, and was honoured with the Earldom of <HI>March,</HI> and Castle of <HI>Dunbar,</HI> by the then King <HI>Malcolm Can∣more,</HI> whence his Posterity took the Name; while another Branch, being possessed of the Barony of
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
<HI>Hume,</HI> assumed that for their Surname, which they still retain. <HI>George de Dunbar</HI> being proscribed in the Reign of <HI>James</HI> I. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Title of Earl of <HI>March</HI> was conferred on the Duke of <HI>Albany,</HI> then on the Family of <HI>Stewart</HI> and <HI>Lenox</HI>; which being extinct, King <HI>William</HI> III. conferred it on <HI>William Douglas,</HI> Brother of the Duke of <HI>Queens∣bury,</HI> whose Son now enjoys it.</P>
<P>Having passed over <HI>Coldingham Moor,</HI> called also <HI>Lambermoor,</HI> the Lowlands of <HI>East-Lothian</HI> shew themselves from the Top of a steep Hill, and give a Prospect of a fruitful and pleasant Country. As soon as we come down the Hill, there is a Village, called <HI>Cockburnspath,</HI> or <HI>Cobberspath,</HI> where Nature forms a very steep and difficult Pass, and where a thousand Men well armed, and boldly doing their Duty, could keep out a very great Army, if there was occasion for it.</P>
<P>The next Shire is that of <HI>East-Lothian</HI>; and the first House of any Note we met with in it, was that of <HI>Dunglass,</HI> the Seat of Sir <HI>James Hall.</HI> We began here to see, that <HI>Scotland</HI> was not naturally so barren, as some People represent it; but might be made equal even to the richest, most fruitful, most pleasant, and best improved Part of <HI>England,</HI> if the <HI>Scots</HI> had the same Methods of doing it, and were as good Husbandmen, as the <HI>English</HI>; and this might easily be brought to pass, would the Gentry set about it, as this Gentleman has, in part, already done.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the Soil hereabout is very good, and the Sea-ware, as they call the Weeds which the Sea casts up, abundantly supplies the Defect of Marl, Chalk, or Lime-stone; for by laying this continually on the Land, they plough every Year, without letting it lie fallow, as we do; and I found they had as much Corn, as our Ploughmen express it, as could stand upon the Ground.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50"/>The next Town of Note is <HI>Dunbar,</HI> a Royal Burgh, which, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is much the same with what we call a Corporation in <HI>England,</HI> and sends Members to Parliament in like manner; only, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> these Burghs have some particular Privileges separate to themselves; as that, for Example, of holding a Sort of Parliament, called a <HI>Convention of Burghs,</HI> a Method taken from the Union of the <HI>Hans Towns</HI> in the North, in which they meet and concert Measures for the publick Good of the Towns, and of their Trade, and make By-laws, or Acts and Declarations, which bind the whole Body. Not have they lost this Privilege by the Union with <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> but it is preserved entire, and is now many ways more advantageous to them than it was before, as their Trade is like to be, in time, more con∣siderable. But this I have taken notice of in an∣other Place.</P>
<P>This Town of <HI>Dunbar</HI> is a handsome well-built Town, situated in the Mouth of the River <HI>Forth,</HI> on the South-side towards the <HI>German</HI> Ocean. It is a very considerable Port, and of great Advantage to all Ships in the River, in case of Stress of Weather; but yet its Entrance was so difficult by steep Rocks, in the Mouth of the Harbour, that the Corporation had exhausted itself by endeavouring to cut through them; and being unable to proceed further in it; and at the same time, the Town-house and School of the Town being run to Decay, and the Town itself destitute of fresh Water: To answer all these good Purposes, they procured an Act to pass, in the Year 1718. intituled, <HI>An Act for laying a Duty of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pennies</HI> Scots, <HI>or one</HI> 6<HI>th Part of a Penny, upon every Pint of Ale or Beer that shall be sold within the Town of</HI> Dunbar; <HI>for improving and preserving the Harbour, and repairing the Town-house, and building a School, and other publick Buildings there; and for supplying the said Town with fresh Water.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="51"/>This Duty has been of very great Service to the Town, and has enabled them to make a great Pro∣gress in the intended Improvements; but the prin∣cipal Works, which were to dig up Part of a Rock at the Bottom of the Harbour, to carry out the great Pier to the Rock called <HI>The Beacon Rock,</HI> to cut the Slope of the Island down to a Perpendicular, and to supply the Town with fresh Water, remaining un∣done; and the Act expiring in the Year 1738. the same was continued for 25 Years longer, by an Act passed 10 <HI>Geo.</HI> II. which will, it is hoped, per∣fect all that remains undone.</P>
<P>They had here a great Herring-fishery, which has decayed very much of late Years; and they cure Herrings here, as they do at <HI>Yarmouth</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> tho' I can't say they cure them so well, nor are they so fit for keeping and sending on long Voyages. The Herrings themselves may indeed make a little Differ∣ence, being generally larger and fatter than those of <HI>Yarmouth</HI>; which makes it more difficult to cure them, so as to keep in a hot Climate, and on a long Voyage. Here was formerly a strong Castle, which was demolish'd by Act of Parliament during the Minority of King <HI>James</HI> VI.</P>
<P>Between the Town and the great Road stands a little, but pleasant and agreeable Seat of the Duke of <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> called <HI>Broxmouth,</HI> with a Park well planted in Vista's and Walks; for the Gentlemen of <HI>Scotland</HI> are now set upon planting Forest-trees, as well for Ornament as Profit. And here I would give an useful Hint to the Gentlemen who plant Trees in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Want of which, as I have observed at several great Houses and Parks in that Country, is the Reason they do not thrive, as they might otherwise do: And this is, by securing the young Trees by a triangular Frame seven or eight Feet high, which is made by setting three large Stakes about them in an equilateral Triangle, and
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
Tree and all, with Haybands, to defend the Bark, fasten'd together at the Top. Then, as the Tree stands in the Centre of the Triangle, which way soever the Wind blows, the Root is not shaken, or the Earth moved and loosened about it.</P>
<P>For want of this, the Tree being left without Support before it has taken Root, the Winds shake it every way, and loosen the Earth about it, so that it gets no Time to strike. This is the Reason why, in many of the Gentlemens Parks, I saw the Trees stunted and balked, though they had been planted many Years.</P>
<P>On the South-west Side of this Town, under the Mountains, near a Place called <HI>Dun-hill,</HI> is the Field where the Battle of <HI>Dunbar</HI> was fought between <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> and General <HI>Lesly,</HI> Commander of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, where the desperate Few (for <HI>Crom∣well</HI>'s Army was not above 8000 Men) defeated and totally overthrew the great Army of the other Side, killed 6000 of them, and took 10000 Prisoners, to the Surprize of the World.</P>
<P>Here we turned out of the Way, to see the Mar∣quis of <HI>Tweedale</HI>'s fine Park at <HI>Yester,</HI> or <HI>Zester</HI>; in the Centre of which stands a very noble House, but in a too low Situation.</P>
<P>The old Earl of <HI>Tweedale,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. having seen the Plans of <HI>Greenwich</HI> and <HI>St. James</HI>'s Parks, was so pleased with them, that, as soon as he went down into <HI>Scotland,</HI> he laid out the Plan and Design of all those noble Walks and Forests of Trees, which he planted here. A Gentleman whose Judgment I can depend upon, told me, that if ever those Trees came to be worth but Six-pence apiece, they would be of more Value than the Fee Simple of the whole paternal Estate of the Family. Nor is this unlikely, if it be true, that his Lordship, and his immediate Successor, planted above 6000 Acres of Land with Fir-trees; and where-ever any
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
of them failed, they were constantly renewed the next Year.</P>
<P>The Park itself is said to be eight Miles round, and exceeds, in many respects, the new Park at <HI>Rich∣mond</HI> in <HI>Surrey:</HI> But the Plantation of Fir is not con∣fined to this Estate; for the Family has another Seat at <HI>Pinkey</HI> near <HI>Musselburgh,</HI> where the same Lord planted also a great Number of Trees, as his Suc∣cessors have likewise done at another Seat, which they have in <HI>Fife,</HI> near <HI>Aberdour.</HI></P>
<P>As this Planting is a great Encouragement to the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> to improve their Estates by the same Method, so we find abundance of Gentlemen follow the Example; insomuch that you hardly see a House of Note, especially in the South Parts of this Country, but is adorned with Groves and Walks of Fir-trees about it; by which we may reasonably ex∣pect, that in a little time <HI>Scotland</HI> will have no need to send to <HI>Norway</HI> for Timber and Deal, but will have sufficient of her own, and, perhaps, be able to furnish <HI>England</HI> too with considerable Quantities.</P>
<P>From this Town of <HI>Dunbar</HI> to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the Country may be reckoned as fruitful, pleasant, and rich, as any in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or, indeed, as most in <HI>England.</HI> The Sea is on the Right-hand at a moderate Distance, and the Hills on the Left, far∣ther off, which are habitable, and feed large Flocks of Sheep, and have many open Roads leading over them from <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and other Parts, towards <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The most material Thing this Country wants, is more inclosed Pastures, by which the Farmers would be enabled to keep a sufficient Stock of Cattle well foddered in the Winter, and thereby not only be fur∣nished with Store of Butter, Cheese, and Beef for the Market, but likewise by the Dung of the Beasts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nrich their Soil, according to the unanswerable
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
Maxim in grasing, That Stock upon Land improves Land.</P>
<P>Two other Articles would increase and enrich them, which they seldom or never practise:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Folding their Sheep within moveable Hurdles.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Fallowing their ploughed Land.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The first would fatten the Ground, and the latter destroy the Weeds; which would be of great Service to the Land at a Distance from the Sea, where they have not the Benefit of Sea-weed, which I have just now mentioned.</P>
<P>But at present, for want of Inclosures, they have no Winter Provision for black Cattle, and therefore the Farmers have no Dairies, no Butter or Cheese, in any Quantity, and no Heaps of Dung in their Yards to return upon the Land for its Improvement. Thus a good Soil is impoverished for want of Husbandry.</P>
<P>From <HI>Dunbar</HI> we pass another River <HI>Tyne,</HI> which, to distinguish it from the two <HI>Tynes</HI> in <HI>Northumber∣land,</HI> I shall call <HI>Scots Tyne,</HI> tho' not so distinguished here. It rises in the Hills near <HI>Yester,</HI> and watering part of the fine and pleasant Vale I mentioned be∣fore, runs by <HI>Haddingtoun,</HI> a Royal Burgh, and an old, half-ruined Town, with the Remains of an old Nunnery. It was formerly large, handsome, and well-built, and reckoned very strong; for besides the Walls of Stone, which were in those Times esteemed very good, the <HI>English</HI> fortified it with Lines and Bastions, four of which latter were very large, as may be seen by what remains of them to this Day. It had also a large Ditch, and was so strong, that the <HI>English,</HI> commanded by Sir <HI>George Wilford,</HI> de∣fended it against a great Army of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> tho' his Garison were almost all swept away by the Plague, till he was relieved from <HI>England,</HI> when he quitted it, after demolishing the Fortifications.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55"/>They have a good Stone-bridge here over the <HI>Tyne,</HI> tho' the River is but small. The Church was large, but has suffered in the Ruin of the rest, and but part of it is repaired, tho' big enough for the Num∣ber of Inhabitants. There are in it some Monu∣ments remaining of the Duke of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> and other <HI>Maitlands,</HI> ancient Lords of this Part of the Country; but as the Choir of the Church is open and defaced, they have suffered with the rest.</P>
<P>In and about this Place I saw something of a Ma∣nufacture, and a Face of Industry, which was the first I had hitherto seen the least Appearance of in <HI>Scotland</HI>; particularly, here was a Woollen Manu∣facture, erected by a Company or Corporation for making Broad-cloth, which they call <HI>English</HI> Cloth: And as they had <HI>English</HI> Workmen, and <HI>English</HI> Wool, they really made it very good; but I cannot say they could bring it so cheap to the Market as they do in <HI>England.</HI> This was the Reason, that tho' before the late Union, the <HI>English</HI> Cloth being pro∣hibited upon severe Penalties, their own Cloth sup∣plied them very well; yet, as soon as the Union was made, by which the <HI>English</HI> Trade was opened, the Clothiers from <HI>Worcester, Gloucester, Wilts, Somer∣set,</HI> and <HI>Devonshire,</HI> brought in their Goods, and underselling the <HI>Scots,</HI> those Manufacturies were not able to stand it. However, the People turn their Hands to other Things, are still employed in Spin∣ning, Dying, Weaving, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and carry on a good deal of that Sort of Business.</P>
<P>On the North-side of the Mouth of the <HI>Forth,</HI> stand the Remains of <HI>Tantallon</HI> Castle, infamous in the <HI>Scots</HI> History for being the Seat of Rebellion in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> V. Hence came the odd Fancy among the Soldiers, That the Drums beating the <HI>Scots</HI> March, which was invented by the King's Soldiers, when they marched against the Earl of <HI>Angus,</HI> who held out this Castle against him, say,
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
<HI>Ding down Tantallon.</HI> But it is now no more a Fortress, being intirely demolished.</P>
<P>Over-against this, in the Mouth of the same River, stands a steep Rock, called the <HI>Bass,</HI> inaccessible on all Sides, except by one narrow Passage. It was formerly slightly fortified, rather to prevent its being made a Retreat for Pirates and Thieves, than for any Use it could be of to command the Sea; for the Entrance of the <HI>Forth</HI> is so wide, that Ships can go in and out, without the least Danger of being hurt by any thing that could be offered from the <HI>Bass.</HI></P>
<P>In the Times of the late King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and his Brother King <HI>James</HI> VII. it was made a State-Prison, where the Western People, called in those Days <HI>Cameronians,</HI> were confined, for being in Arms against the King. And after the Revolution a despe∣rate Crew of People got Possession of it; and having a large Boat, which they hoisted up upon the Rock, or let down at Pleasure, committed several Piracies, took a great many Vessels, and held out the last of any Place in <HI>Great Britain</HI> for King <HI>James:</HI> But their Boat being at last either seized or lost, and not being seasonably supplied with Provisions from <HI>France,</HI> as they used to be, they were obliged to surrender.</P>
<P>The <HI>Solan</HI> Geese are the principal Inhabitants of this Island, a Fowl rare as to its Kind; for they are not found any-where in <HI>Britain</HI> that I can learn, ex∣cept here, in some of the lesser Islands in the <HI>Orcades,</HI> and in the Island of <HI>Ailzye,</HI> in the Mouth of the <HI>Clyde.</HI> They come as certainly at their Season, as the Swallows or Wood-cocks, with this Difference, (if what the People there tell us may be depended on) that they generally come exactly to the very same Day of the Month.</P>
<P>They feed mostly on Herrings, and therefore 'tis observed, they come just before or with them, and go away with them likewise, tho', 'tis evident, they do not follow them; for they go all away to the
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
North, but whither, is not known. As they live on Fish, so they eat like Fish, which, together with their being so exceeding fat, makes them, in my Opinion, a very coarse Dish, rank, ill-relished, and soon gorges the Stomach. But here they are look'd upon as a Dainty.</P>
<P>It is a large Fowl, rather bigger than an ordinary Goose. 'Tis web-footed, but its Bill is pointed like a Crane or Heron, only much thicker, and not above five Inches long. When they are coming, they send some before to fix their Mansion, which, for that Reason, are called <HI>Scouts.</HI> The Inhabitants are careful not to disturb them till they have built their Nests, and then they are not to be frightened by any Noise whatsoever. They lay but one Egg at a time, which they so dextrously fix by one End to a Point of the Rock in the middle of the Nest, that if it be pulled off, 'tis difficult to fix it so any more. They hatch it, by holding it fast under one Foot, and seldom leave it till it be hatched. The Fish caught by the old ones often serve the Inhabitants for Food, and the Sticks they bring to make their Nests supply them with Fewel. They make great Profit both of the Flesh and Feathers of their young ones, which are taken from their Nests by one let down the Rock with a Rope. When young, they are of an ash Colour; but when old, white.</P>
<P>At the Top of the Rock is a fresh-water Spring, with a small Warren for Rabbets; but the Bottom of it is almost worn through by the Tide. It was for∣merly the Possession, and sometimes the Seat, of the antient Family of <HI>Lawder,</HI> who a long time refused to sell it, tho' often solicited to it by several Kings. King <HI>James</HI> VI. told the then Laird, <HI>He would give him whatever he pleased to ask for it</HI>; whereby that Gentleman had a fine Opportunity of making a good Bargain: But after he had told his Majesty, That he would sell it upon these Terms, and the King desiring
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
to know what he would ask, he answered, <HI>Your Majesty must e'en resign it to me; for I'll have the ald Craig</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> Rock) <HI>back again.</HI> However, the Fa∣mily, at last, coming to Decay, it was purchased by King <HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>From hence, keeping the Shore of the <HI>Forth,</HI> due West, we find a Range of large and populous Vil∣lages all along the Coast, almost as far as <HI>Leith.</HI></P>
<P>All this Part of the Country is delightfully spread with the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen; as the Duke of <HI>Roxburgh</HI>'s near <HI>Dunbar,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Had∣dington</HI>'s at <HI>Tinningham,</HI> the Lord <HI>Beilhaven</HI>'s at <HI>Beilhaven,</HI> and that of the Family of <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> Earl of <HI>Stair,</HI> who have fine Seats at the Burgh of <HI>North Berwick,</HI> (where there is a small, but pretty good Market) <HI>Hales,</HI> and in the Neighbourhood of this Place.</P>
<P>The House and Estate of <HI>Dirleton,</HI> now in the Family of <HI>Nisbet,</HI> is pleasantly seated in this Part of the Country; as is <HI>Ormistoun,</HI> a thriving little Town, belonging to the Family of <HI>Cockburn</HI>; round which they have a handsome Estate, so well planted and improved, that I don't remember to have ever seen a more beautiful Spot of Ground. They have also a pretty good Seat here; but when I saw it, it was very much out of Repair.</P>
<P>I must here add, the antient and noble Houses of <HI>Seton</HI> and <HI>Winton,</HI> both Palaces (for so they deserve to be called) of the late Earl of <HI>Winton,</HI> who did so many weak and rash Things in the Affair of the late Rebellion. They are now in a State of Ruin, as is the Estate on which they stand, which, for its Value, is as fine as any in <HI>Scotland,</HI> lying all conti∣guous with itself, and valued at almost 5000<HI>l. Sterling per Annum</HI>; but all being under Forfeiture, it was sold to the <HI>York-Buildings</HI> Company. The fine Gates, and Stone Wall, were demolished by the Govern∣ment, after it had been made a Garison by the
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>
Highlanders, who from hence began their hare∣brain'd March to <HI>England,</HI> which Expedition ended at <HI>Preston.</HI> The Name <HI>Seton</HI> was given the Fa∣mily from the Term <HI>Set-on,</HI> which one of the An∣cestors of it used to the Soldiers he commanded, when entering upon an Engagement. They were reckoned a very gallant, as well as loyal Family; and no true <HI>Scotsman</HI> can well omit telling the memorable Story, That in the Year 1332. when <HI>Edward</HI> II. came before <HI>Berwick,</HI> where Sir <HI>Alexander Seton</HI> was then Governor, he summoned him to surrender, and threatened to hang his two Sons, whom he had among his Hostages, if he delayed. Accordingly a Gallows was erected near the Town Wall, and the young Men led forth. Tenderness for his Children began to move the Governor, when his Lady (of the Name of <HI>Cheyne</HI>) came and told him, <HI>He and she were both young enough to have more Children; but if he surren∣dered, he could never recover his Honour.</HI> Upon this, he refused, and the Tyrant cruelly murdered the young Gentlemen; but the Lady was rewarded with Two Sons afterwards.</P>
<P>The Towns upon this Coast, as I said, stand very thick; and there are two or three Articles of Trade which render them more populous, and more con∣siderable, than they would otherwise be.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. There are great Quantities of white Fish taken and cured all along this Coast; and I observed, that they were very well cured, merchantable, and fit for Exportation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. There is great Plenty of Coal in the Hills, so near the Sea, that the Carriage is easy, a great deal of which is carried to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and other Towns thereabouts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They make very good Salt at almost all the Towns upon the Shore; as at <HI>Seton, Cockenny, Prestonpans,</HI> and several other Places. They have a
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>
very great Trade for this Salt to <HI>Norway, Ham∣burgh, Bremen,</HI> the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and even <HI>Holland</HI>; and the Number of Ships loaded with it here yearly is very considerable.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. They take great Quantities of Oysters here also, with which they not only supply the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> but carry abundance of them in large open Boats, called <HI>Cobles,</HI> as far as <HI>Newcastle upon Tyne</HI>; from whence they generally bring back Glass Bottles.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>At several of these Villages are little Moles and Harbours, or Peers, built up at a considerable Ex∣pence, for securing the Ships that come to load Salt, and other Goods; as at <HI>North Berwick, Aberlady, Preston, Prestonpans,</HI> which is also noted for good Malt Liquor, <HI>Cockenny, Port-seton,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Country hereabouts is both pleasant and po∣pulous, and full of Gentlemens Houses; among which is <HI>Salton,</HI> belonging to Mr. <HI>Fletcher.</HI></P>
<P>We came next to <HI>Musselburgh,</HI> an antient <HI>Burgh of Regality.</HI> In this Town are many Hands em∣ployed in the Woollen Manufacture, especially in coarse Stuffs for the Use of the Poor; and they have continued many Years successfully this Branch of Trade without any Rival.</P>
<P>A little West from this lies <HI>Fisher-raw,</HI> so called from a very large Row of Houses mostly inhabited by Fishermen, who were formerly more numerous here than at present; for the Muscle Trade, which was of old reckoned very valuable, is now given over; and their chief Business, at present, consists in catching Cods, Haddocks, Whitings, and some few Shell-fish.</P>
<P>More to the South are two small Villages, called <HI>New-bigging</HI> and <HI>Good-speed-all</HI>; but they are so nearly joined to <HI>Musselburgh</HI> and <HI>Fisher-raw,</HI> that a
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
Stranger would take them to be all one continued Town. Nevertheless, they have not had a Church since the Reformation, but are only a Part of the Parish of <HI>Inveresk,</HI> an adjoining Village, so called, because it stands on the River <HI>Esk,</HI> which, tho' it be sometimes so full of Water as to overflow its Banks, yet, being rapid, it is not made navigable.</P>
<P>This Village enjoys so good an Air, that the emi∣nent Dr. <HI>Pitcairn</HI> called it the <HI>Montpelier</HI> of <HI>Scot∣land.</HI> It is very full of People, and there are several very handsome Houses and Gardens in it, which invite the Citizens of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to take Lodgings here in the Summer, as the <HI>Londoners</HI> do at <HI>Ken∣sington-gravel-pits, Hampstead, Hackney,</HI> and <HI>High-gate.</HI></P>
<P>But the Glory and Beauty of this Parish is <HI>Pinkey,</HI> which formerly belonged to <HI>Seton,</HI> Earl of <HI>Dumferm∣line,</HI> but now to the Marquis of <HI>Tweedale,</HI> who usually resided here before his House at <HI>Yester</HI> was finished; which, tho' it be the most magnificent Building, yet is not so agreeably situated as <HI>Pinkey,</HI> which stands near the Sea, just as we enter into <HI>Musselburgh.</HI></P>
<P>In the Court before the House is a large Stone Well, covered with an Imperial Crown of Stone, supported by Pillars of the <HI>Ionick Order.</HI> The great Hall on the Right, as you enter, is adorned with Views of the great Cities of <HI>Italy</HI>; and in a Drawing-room adjoining to it, is a Billiard-table. The great Stair-case on the Left is balustraded with Iron, and crowded with Pictures.</P>
<P>The first Apartment consists of a Dining-room, Drawing-room, and Bed-chamber, all very spaci∣ous, curiously wainscotted with Oak, and hung with the Seasons in Tapestry, of the small Figures, and best Sort. The Bed is of crimson Velvet in an Alcove, neatly supported with Pillars. The Chim∣neys are of Marble, and above that of the Dining-room
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
is painted the finest Inside of a Church that is any-where to be seen.</P>
<P>The great Gallery is very long and spacious, the Ceiling whereof is full of <HI>Latin</HI> Inscriptions suitable to the several Paintings. Here is a Family Picture of the Lord <HI>Seton,</HI> with his Four Sons and Daughters, by <HI>Hans Holbein</HI>; Mr. <HI>Henderson,</HI> the Covenanter, by <HI>Vandyke</HI>; the whole Length of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and his Chancellor, the Earl of <HI>Dumfermline,</HI> in his Robes, by the same Hand. The first Earl of <HI>Twee∣dale,</HI> with his Eight Sons and Seven Daughters, all in one Picture, as big as the Life, takes up almost one End of the Room. There are fine Altar-pieces, Passion-pieces, and others of that Kind, that were saved from Plunder out of Monasteries at the Refor∣mation. Here is likewise a good Picture of the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and another of the Duke of <HI>Lau∣derdale,</HI> (who married his only Child to the Heir of this Family) with great Numbers of Family Pictures of the <HI>Hays</HI> and <HI>Setons.</HI> There is also well preserved the genealogical Tree of the Family, from the Year 970. to this Time; <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Hays, Giffards,</HI> and <HI>Frazers.</HI> But many of the Pictures have been of late carried to <HI>Yester.</HI></P>
<P>The Parterre behind the House is very large, and nobly adorned with Ever-greens, and on each Side of it spacious Gardens. The Whole stands in a Park above three Miles in Circumference, well planted with an incredible Number of Fir-trees, and walled round with Stone. I confess, if I had been Owner of <HI>Pinkey,</HI> I should hardly have built <HI>Yester</HI>; for <HI>Pin∣key</HI> stands nobly, and has a commanding Prospect, not only over the adjacent Country, but also of the Coast of <HI>Fife,</HI> over the Sea, at nine Miles Distance: Whereas <HI>Yester,</HI> as I have said, lies in a Bottom, and all its Views bounded within itself. <HI>Yester,</HI> 'tis true, is the antient Seat of the Family, whose Title to <HI>Pinkey</HI> is but late, and (some say) was precarious.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="63"/>Near this Place was fought a Battle by <HI>Edward Seymour,</HI> Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> when he came to force the <HI>Scots</HI> into the Marriage of their young Queen <HI>Mary</HI> with his Nephew King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. which was, by-the-by, a very coarse way of Wooing. Here was a great Slaughter of the <HI>Scots:</HI> But tho' the <HI>English</HI> won the Battle, yet they lost their Prize; for the young Queen was privately embarked, carried to <HI>France,</HI> and afterwards married to the Dauphin, who became King <HI>Francis</HI> II.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> call this the Battle of <HI>Musselburgh</HI>; but some <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen, riding out with us, to shew us the Place where the Action was begun and ended, we all agreed, that the <HI>Scots</HI> are in the right, who call it the Battle of <HI>Pinkey.</HI></P>
<P>I now approached the capital City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI>; but must say a Word or two of its Situation, before I enter it. Standing then at a small Distance, and taking a View of it from the East, you have really but a very confused Idea of the City, because the Situation being in Length from East to West, and the Breadth ill-proportioned to it, you view it under the greatest Disadvantage possible; whereas, if you turn a little to the Right-hand towards <HI>Leith,</HI> you have a very handsome Prospect of it; and from the South you see it to yet more Advantage, because it is increased on that Side with new Streets.</P>
<P>At the Extremity of the East-end of the City stands the Palace of <HI>Holy-rood-house</HI>; leaving which, a little to the Left, you come thro' a populous Sub∣urb to the Entrance, called the <HI>Water-port.</HI> From hence, turning West, the Street goes on in a strait Line, thro' the whole City to the Castle. It is above a Mile in Length, and is, perhaps, the largest, longest, and finest Street, for Buildings, and Number of Inhabitants, in the World.</P>
<P>From the Palace Door, which stands on a Level with the lowest of the plain Country, the Street
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
begins to ascend very gradually, being no-where steep; but this Ascent being continued for so long a Way, it is easy to understand, that the further Part must necessarily be very high; for the Castle, which stands, as it were, at the Extremity West, as the Palace does East, makes, on all the three Sides, (that only excepted, which joins it to the City) a frightful and impassable Precipice.</P>
<P>Together with this continued Ascent, you are to suppose the Edge or Top of the Ascent so narrow, that the Street, and the Row of Houses on each Side, take up the whole Breadth; so that which way soever you turn, you go down Hill imme∣diately; which is so steep, that it is very troublesome to those who have not very good Lungs, to walk in those Side-lanes, which they call <HI>Wynds.</HI> By this Description you will perceive, that the City stands upon the narrow Ridge of a long ascending Mountain.</P>
<P>On the North-side of the City, towards the West-end of it, where the Castle stands, is a Lough, or Lake of Water; which has a small Brook that runs thro' it, so that it cannot be said to be quite stand∣ing. There was formerly another Lake on the South-side of it, which, being now filled up, is built into a Street, tho' so much lower than the high Street, that, as I said before, the Lanes between them are very steep.</P>
<P>The Town is so antient, that no History has recorded when, by whom, or on what Occasion, it was built; yet, it seems most natural to conclude, that such a Situation could not be chosen, but for a Retreat from the Outrages and Attempts of the <HI>Britons, Saxons, Danes,</HI> or other Enemies; for having an impregnable Castle at the West-end, and a Lake on either Side, the Inhabitants had nothing to defend but the Entrance at the East-end, which it was easy to fortify.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="65"/>If this was not the Reason for chusing the Situa∣tion, what should have hindered them from building the City in a pleasant, delightful Valley, with the Sea flowing up to one Side, and a River running thro' the Middle of it? such as that Space of Ground between it and the Sea, where the Town of <HI>Leith</HI> stands. There they would have had a noble, plea∣sant, and most useful Situation, a very fine Harbour for their Trade, a good Road in the <HI>Firth</HI> for their Ships of Burden; a pleasant River, which, with small Art and Charge, might have been so drawn round the City as to have filled its Ditches, and made its Fortifications almost impregnable, as the <HI>French</HI> did, when they fortified <HI>Leith.</HI> Or had they gone to the South-side of the City, and extended it to∣wards <HI>Libertoun</HI> and <HI>Goodtrees,</HI> they had found a Plain large enough to have contained another <HI>London,</HI> watered on the South-part with a pleasant Brook, capable, by the Help of Pipes, to have conveyed Water into every Street and House.</P>
<P>These Things they did not foresee, or not under∣stand in those Days; but, regarding immediate Safety, fixed on the Hill, as a sure Strength, formed by Nature, ready at their Hand. By this means, the City lies under such Inconveniencies as are made a Subject of Scorn and Reproach by some, as if the People delighted in Stench and Nastiness; whereas, were any other People to live under the same Unhap∣piness of a rocky and mountainous Situation, a Throng of Buildings from six to ten Stories high, a Difficulty of obtaining Water, (that little they have being to be carried up to the uppermost Apartments) we should find a <HI>London</HI> or a <HI>Bristol</HI> as dirty as <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> and, perhaps, less able to make their Dwel∣ling tolerable, at least in so narrow a Compass; for tho' many Cities have more People in them, yet, I believe, there is none in the World, where so many People live in so little Room.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="66"/>On the North-side of the City, as I have said, is a spacious, rich, and pleasant Plain, extending from the Lake, which joins it, to the River of <HI>Leith,</HI> at the Mouth of which is the Town of <HI>Leith,</HI> at the Distance of a long <HI>Scots</HI> Mile. Here, were not the North-side of the Hill which the City stands on, so exceeding steep, that it is not only impassable for Carriages, but can hardly be clambered up on Foot, and were the Lake filled up, as that on the other Side is, the City might have been extended upon the Plain below, and fine Streets would, no doubt, have been built: Nay, I question much, whether, in time, the high Streets would not have been for∣saken, and the City, as I may say, run all out of its Gates to the North.</P>
<P>This might have been the Consequence, if the City had been in a State of Increase; for had their Trade flourished, as was reasonably expected, if the Business of <HI>Darien</HI> had succeeded, or upon the Union, the Inhabitants would have likewise increased.</P>
<P>Having thus considered the City in its outward Appearance, and in its Situation, I must look next into its Inside, where we shall find it (notwithstand∣ing all its Discouragements and Disadvantages) a large, populous, noble, rich, and even Royal City. The main Street, as above, is the most spacious and best inhabited in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Buildings are surprising for their Strength, their Beauty, and their Height, and are mostly of Free-stone; yet so firm, that tho' they stand so high, and in a Country where Storms and violent Winds are so frequent, 'tis very rare, and only on such Occasions as I shall mention by-and-by, that any Damage is done here.</P>
<P>From the Palace-gate Westward, this Street is called the <HI>Canongate,</HI> as belonging to the Canons of the Abbey, which is a kind of Suburb by itself, as <HI>Southwark</HI> is to <HI>London.</HI> In this Part of the Street, tho' otherwise not so well inhabited as the City itself,
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
are several very magnificent Houses of the Nobility, built for their Residence when the Court was here. Of these the Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI>'s, the Earl of <HI>Winton</HI>'s, the Duke of <HI>Roxburgh</HI>'s, the Earl of <HI>Panmure</HI>'s, and the Earl of <HI>Murray</HI>'s, are the chief: The first and last are very large and princely Build∣ings, all of Free-stone, large in Front, and have good Gardens behind them.</P>
<P>At the Upper or West-end of this Street, where it joins to the City, is a Gate, which, like <HI>Ludgate,</HI> parts the City from the Suburb, but does not dis∣continue the Street, which rather widens, and is more spacious, when you are thro' the Gate, than before. This is the famous <HI>Nether-bow Port,</HI> whose Doors were like to have been taken away by the Par∣liament, when the Affair of Captain <HI>Porteous</HI> was under their Consideration, as I shall mention more particularly by-and-by.</P>
<P>Just at this Gate, on the Outside, are two Streets, one of which is called <HI>St. Mary Wynd,</HI> and the other <HI>Leith Wynd</HI>; the first leads out of the City, South, into the great Road for <HI>England,</HI> by the Way of <HI>Kelso</HI>; and at the Foot of it is a Gate turning West∣ward into the low Street, called the <HI>Cowgate,</HI> be∣cause the Cattle are driven thro' it to and from the great Market-place: The other leads North into a Suburb, called the <HI>Calton,</HI> from whence there is a very handsome Gravel-walk, 20 Feet broad, con∣tinued to the Town of <HI>Leith,</HI> which is kept in Re∣pair at the publick Charge, and no Horses suffered to come upon it.</P>
<P>We now enter the City at the <HI>Nether-bow Port,</HI> and have an open View up the high Street. It must not be expected I should describe all the Buildings of the City; I shall therefore touch upon some few, and go on. The first of any Note is a fine House on the South-side of the Street, a little within the Gate, belonging to the Marquis of <HI>Tweedale,</HI> with a
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
Plantation of Lime-trees behind it, the Place not allowing Room for a large Garden: Adjoining to this are very good Buildings, which, if set out in handsome Streets, would adorn a very noble City; but being crouded together in narrow Wynds and Alleys, deserve no Notice.</P>
<P>A little further, on the same Side, is the <HI>Trone</HI> Kirk; and near it, in the Middle of the Street, stands the Guard-house, where two Companies of disci∣plined Men, cloathed and armed like Grenadiers at the Charge of the Town, do Duty every Night, and keep the publick Peace of the City.</P>
<P>About Mid-way between the <HI>Nether-bow</HI> and the Castle, is the great Church, which, before the Re∣formation, was Collegiate, and dedicated to <HI>St. Gyles</HI>; but it was afterwards divided into several Preaching-places, and Districts of the City were allotted to them, so as to be parochial. When King <HI>Charles</HI> I. erected a new Bishoprick at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> which be∣fore that time was in the Diocese of <HI>St. Andrews,</HI> it was made a Cathedral, and the Dean was Forenoon Minister of that Part of it, called the <HI>New Kirk,</HI> which is the Choir, Chancel, or Eastern Part. In it is a noble Gallery for the King, or his Commis∣sioner. Here also the Magistrates assemble, and the Judges in their Habits, in time of Session. In a large Chapel, on the South-west Part of this Church, the General Assembly hold their Sessions, as does also the Commission of the Assembly, in the Interval be∣tween the General Meetings.</P>
<P>The great Cross under the Tower is called the <HI>Old Kirk</HI>; and the Front or West-part of the great Church is divided into two Parts: That on the South is called the <HI>Tolbooth Kirk,</HI> and that on the North <HI>Haddo's Hole,</HI> from the Laird of <HI>Haddo,</HI> (Grandfather to the present Earl of <HI>Aberdeen</HI>) who being a great Royalist and Anti-covenanter, was kept Prisoner in a Vault there, till he was beheaded.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="69"/>The Steeple in the Middle is very high, and of good Architecture; the Summit of it resembles an Impe∣rial Crown. Here they have a Set of Bells, which are not rung out as in <HI>England,</HI> (for that way of Ringing is not known in this Country) but are played upon by the Hand with Keys, like a Harpsichord, the Person playing having great Leather Covers to his Fists, by which he is able to strike with the more Force. They play all manner of Tunes very musi∣cally, and the Town gives a Man a yearly Salary for playing upon them from half an Hour after Eleven, till half an Hour after Twelve, every Day, <HI>Sundays</HI> and <HI>Holidays</HI> excepted.</P>
<P>On the South-side of this Church (formerly the Church-yard) is a Square of very fine Buildings, called the <HI>Parliament Close,</HI> the West and South-sides of which are mostly taken up with the Parliament-house, the several Courts of Justice, the Council-chamber, the Exchequer, the publick Registers, the Court for the Royal Boroughs to assemble in, the Lawyers Library, the Post Office, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The great Church makes up the North-side of the Square, and the East and Part of the South-side is built into pri∣vate Dwellings very stately, lofty, and strong, being seven Stories high to the Front of the Square, and the Hill they stand on having a very steep Descent, some of them are no less than fourteen Stories high backwards. In the middle of this Square is an Eque∣strian Statue of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. which is reckoned the finest of its kind in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament-house is a stately, convenient, and large Structure. Over its Entrance are the Arms of <HI>Scotland</HI> well cut, with <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> on each Side, for Supporters; and this Inscription, <HI>Stant his felicia regna</HI>; importing, that these Virtues make Kingdoms happy. And under the Arms was this Motto, <HI>Unio Unionum</HI>; relating not only to the Union of the two Crowns, but signifying, that
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
their Advice was necessary for the Maintenance of it. The Room for meeting of the Parliament had, on that Occasion, a high Throne for the Sovereign, or the Commissioner, with Benches on each Side for the Nobility and Bishops, and Forms conve∣niently placed in the Middle, for the Commoners. Without the Area was a Pulpit for Sermons to the Parliament, on particular Occasions; and be∣hind the Pulpit a large Partition for others, be∣sides Members, to hear the Sermons, and Debates of the House, when they thought fit to allow it. This Building, in some measure, resembles <HI>Westminster-hall,</HI> and tho' not quite so large, has a much more curious Roof. In the South or Upper-end, one of the ordinary Judges sits every Week in Session-time, to hear Causes in the first Instance: But when the Parliament sat, that Court was removed to another Part of the Hall. At the West-end of it are kept the Sheriff and Commissary Courts. Near the North-end is the Town Council-house or <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> and over it is the Justciary or Criminal Court. At the South-east Part of the Parliament-house, is a Door from what they call the <HI>Outer-house</HI> (where the Lord Ordinary sits) into the <HI>Inner,</HI> where sit the other Fourteen Judges, or Lords of Session; which is the supreme Civil Judicature of <HI>Scotland.</HI> Over which are Apartments for the Lords of Exchequer, and for the Privy-council when in Being.</P>
<P>In the Lower-part under the Parliament-house, is a noble Library of Books and MSS. belonging to the College of Justice, or Gentlemen of the Law.</P>
<P>Near the Council-chamber stands the Royal Ex∣change, made up of a double Row of Shops, and another Exchange inferior to this.</P>
<P>The great Opening into the high Street, being the only Passage into it for Coaches, is at the North-east Corner, a little from which is the Market-cross, where all their Proclamations and publick Acts are
<PB N="70" REF="71"/>
read and published by Heralds and Sound of Trum∣pet. Here is the great Parade, where Gentlemen meet for Business or News, as at the Exchange, every Day from Eleven to One.</P>
<P>Near the West-end of the great Church stands the <HI>Tolbooth,</HI> or common Prison, as well for Criminals as for Debtors. It was formerly the Place of Resi∣dence for the Provost of <HI>St. Gyles's,</HI> as most of the adjacent Houses were for the Canons and Choiristers of that Church.</P>
<P>The great Church and this Prison both standing in the middle of the Street, the Breadth and Beauty of it is for some Space interrupted; but those Build∣ings past, the Street opens again to its former Breadth, and is now called the <HI>Lawn-market,</HI> from the <HI>Linen-market</HI> being kept here. This Part of the Street extends West to a narrower one, which leads to the <HI>Castle-hill.</HI> At the Upper-end of it is a Stone Build∣ing appropriated to several publick Offices of lesser Value, called the <HI>Weigh-house</HI>; for below Stairs are Ware-houses, with publick Weights and Scales for weighing heavy Goods.</P>
<P>Here the high Street parts into two, one of which leads to the Castle Hill, as already noticed, and the other turns South-west, and descending gradually, leads to the <HI>Grass-market,</HI> a Place very like <HI>Smith∣field</HI> in every respect, where is kept a weekly Mar∣ket for Black Cattle, Sheep, Horses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Street, which is called the <HI>West-bow,</HI> is inhabited mostly by wholesale Dealers in Iron, Pitch, Tar, Oil, Hemp, Flax, Linseed, Drugs, Woads, and such-like heavy Goods.</P>
<P>This City hath seven Gates, or Ports, as they are here called, <HI>viz.</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>Nether-bow Port:</HI> This is the chief Gate; it was magnificently built in 1606. and adorn'd with Towers on both Sides. This is the Entrance from the
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
Palace, and the principal Suburb called the <HI>Canon-gate.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The <HI>Cow-gate Port,</HI> at the East-end, likewise gives Entrance to the Street of that Name, leading to the Abbey by a Backway.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The <HI>Potter-row Port,</HI> gives Entrance to the Suburb so called, and leads to <HI>Dalkeith, Kelso,</HI> &amp;c. Southward.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The <HI>Society Port,</HI> called so from the Society of Brewers, who have a great square Court near it, with stately Houses and Buildings round it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The <HI>West Port,</HI> the only Gate at the West-end of the City, which leads thro' a large Suburb to <HI>Glasgow, Sterling, Queens-ferry,</HI> and from thence to the West and North Highlands.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The <HI>New Port,</HI> at the East-end of the Lake, leading Northward towards a Village called <HI>Mouter's Hill</HI> and <HI>Leith.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. The <HI>College-Kirk Port,</HI> leading also to <HI>Leith.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Markets here are very well supplied with all the Necessaries of Life, and are mostly kept in distinct Market-places walled in, and reserved for the parti∣cular Things they are appointed for; such as
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Meal Market.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Flesh Market.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Poultry Market.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The Fish Market.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The Corn Market.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The Leather Market.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Besides these, there is a Weekly Market for all Sorts of Woollen Manufactures, and Linen Cloth, kept in that Part of the high Street called the <HI>Lawn Market,</HI> just now mentioned. There is also in the same Street, below the Cross, an Herb and Fruit Market kept every Morning, but abates before Noon, so that it is no Incumbrance. The Market for Black Cattle, Sheep, Horses, and Grass, is kept in that
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
large Space of Ground within the <HI>West Port,</HI> called the <HI>Grass Market,</HI> as I have already mentioned.</P>
<P>On the South-side of the City, towards the East-end, stands a large Building, erected at the Charge of the Surgeons and Apothecaries of this City, in which is their great Hall, hung round with the Pi∣ctures of all the Surgeons of this Place that have been since this Building was founded. Here they have also a Theatre for Dissections, and a Chamber of Rarities, in which there are several Skeletons of uncommon Creatures, a Mummy, and other Cu∣riosities.</P>
<P>Near the <HI>Potter-row Port</HI> stands the College, or University. It consists of three Courts, two lower, and one higher, equal to the other two. These Courts are encompassed with neat Buildings for the Use of such Students as please to lodge in them; for they don't live in common, nor are they obliged to reside, but only to attend their Classes at certain Hours. There is a high Tower over the great Gate, looking to the City.</P>
<P>The <HI>Publick Schools</HI> are large and commodious; there are Accommodations for Students, handsome Dwellings for the Professors, and fine Gardens for their Recreation. It was founded in 1580. by King <HI>James</HI> VI. upon a Petition from the City, to grant them a Charter with the Privilege of an University; but the Foundation was not perfected till 1582. The Persons established by the Foundation were, a Principal or Primate, a Professor of Divinity, four Regents or Masters of Philosophy, and a Professor of Philology called <HI>Prof. Humaniorum Literarum,</HI> or Regent of Humanity. In 1640. the Town added a Professor of Mathematicks. To which have been lately added Professors of Ecclesiastical History, Civil Law, Theoretical and Practical Me∣dicine, Chymistry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Dignity of Chancellor
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>
and Vice-chancellor of the University is in the Lord-Provost and Town Council.</P>
<P>They have a very good Library, which was founded by <HI>Clement Little,</HI> one of the Commissaries of <HI>Edinburgh</HI>; since which it is much increased by Donations from the Citizens, Persons of Quality, and others, who had their Education there. The Library is neatly kept, well furnished with Books, put in very good Order, cloister'd with Wire Doors, which none but the Keeper can open, which is more commodious, and less encumbering, than Multitudes of Chains, commonly used in other Libraries. The Books given by the grand Benefactors, are kept in distinct Apartments, and the Donor's Name over them in Letters of Gold.</P>
<P>Over the Books hang the Pictures of several Princes, and of the most eminent Reformers at Home and Abroad; and near them is kept the Skull of the fa∣mous <HI>Buchanan,</HI> very intire, and so thin, that the Light may be seen thro' it. It was deposited there by Mr. <HI>Adamson,</HI> formerly Principal of the University, who procured it to be taken out of his Grave, and fastened some <HI>Latin</HI> Verses to it in Commendation of that celebrated Historian. There is also the Ori∣ginal of the <HI>Bohemian</HI> Protest against the Council of <HI>Constance,</HI> for burning <HI>John Hus</HI> and <HI>Jerom</HI> of <HI>Prague, Anno</HI> 1417. with 105 Seals of <HI>Bohemian</HI> and <HI>Moravian</HI> Grandees annexed to it. It was pro∣cured by a <HI>Scots</HI> Gentleman in his Travels, and given to the University.</P>
<P>Under the Library was the King's Printing-house, for Bibles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> At the farther End of the Library is a Stair-case, which leads to the higher and lower Common Halls, where they hold their Commence∣ments and College Entertainmenrs. In this Place are several Maps, Globes, Books, and Rarities; and among others a crooked Horn, cut out of a Woman's Head when fifty Years old, and who lived twelve
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
Years after it. It is several Inches long, and was taken out of her Head by a Surgeon, <HI>Anno</HI> 1671. Here also are Lectures read, Exercises performed, and Apartments for the Professor of Divinity to teach his Pupils in, and for a select Library proper for Divines.</P>
<P>In this higher Common Hall, which is a very spa∣cious Room, are placed such Books as have been bought by, or given to the College, since the Li∣brary below was full; and in the South-end of it is a curious and noble Museum, collected by the very eminent Sir <HI>Andrew Balfour,</HI> who was once Tutor to the famous Earl of <HI>Rochester.</HI> It contains a vast Treasure of Curiosities of Art and Nature, domestick and foreign, from almost all Parts of the World, and is greatly valued by the Virtuoso's, containing some Rarities that are not to be found, either in those of the <HI>Royal Society</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> or the <HI>Ashmolean</HI> at <HI>Oxford.</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Sibbald,</HI> having a mind to engraft his Name and Merit, on that of the celebrated <HI>Balfour,</HI> made a Present of a great Number of Shells, and other Curiosities, to the College, on Condition the Magistrates would print the Account of it, called, <HI>Auctarium Musei Balfouriani e Museo Sib∣baldiano</HI>; to which I refer the Reader.</P>
<P>Eastward from the College is the High-School, well endow'd, and with proper Apartments for one Master and four Ushers, who teach Youth Grammar and Rhetorick.</P>
<P>In <HI>Gray's-close,</HI> near the <HI>Cowgate Port,</HI> is the Mint-house, in a large Court, with neat and con∣venient Buildings, and other Accommodations for the Master, Officers, and Workmen. It is now disused for that Purpose; and is a Sanctuary, or Place of Privilege.</P>
<P>At a small Distance from the College are two neat Hospitals, with pretty Gardens to each of them; and a little further is the Church-yard of the <HI>Franciscans,</HI> or <HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y-friars,</HI> the common Burial-place for the
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
whole City within the Walls, where are a great many fine and curious Monuments. It contains about two Acres of Ground.</P>
<P>Adjoining to it is <HI>Heriot's Hospital,</HI> a large and stately Building, the most magnificent of its Kind in the World, adorned with a consecrated Chapel, large Walks, delightful Greens, and pleasant Gardens. It was built by the Rev. Dr. <HI>Balcanqual,</HI> to whom <HI>George Heriot,</HI> Jeweller to King <HI>James</HI> VI. left near 17000 Pounds, to be disposed of in pious Uses, which that worthy Dean did by building and endowing this House, and giving Statutes to it, which he ordered should be <HI>unalterable.</HI> 'Tis a Nursery for an inde∣finite Number of the Sons of Freemen, who are maintained, cloathed, and educated in useful Learning, till they are fit for Apprenticeships, or to go to the University, where they are allowed handsome Salaries and Exhibitions.</P>
<P>On the South-side of the City, in the way to <HI>Leith,</HI> is a beautiful Collegiate Church, built by Queen <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Guelders,</HI> Queen to King <HI>James</HI> II. and dedicated to the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> but now Parochial, tho' nothing but the Church Part was ever finished.</P>
<P>Near it is <HI>St. Thomas's Hospital</HI>; wherein old decayed Citizens, and their Widows, are very de∣cently provided for, and allowed a Chaplain.</P>
<P>Over-against it is <HI>Bridewell,</HI> or the House of Cor∣rection, in which dissolute People undergo Discipline, and are kept to hard Labour. There is an Apart∣ment in it for lunatick and distracted Persons.</P>
<P>Of late Years, Mrs. <HI>Hare</HI> left a noble Benefaction for a new Hospital for Female Orphans of decay'd Freemen; which created a laudable Emulation in many others, whose united Contributions have raised another, for the same good Purpose.</P>
<P>An Infirmary, called the <HI>Royal Infirmary,</HI> after the Example of those at <HI>London, Winchester,</HI> &amp;c. has been lately erected at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> by the liberal
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
Contribution of many well-disposed Persons; and there was so general a Good-will to the Work, that the like Spirit has hardly ever been known any-where. The Proprietors of several Stone-Quarries made Pre∣sents of Stone to it, others of Lime. Merchants contributed Timber. The Wrights and Masons were not wanting in their Contributions: The neighbour∣ing Farmers agreed to carry Materials <HI>gratis:</HI> The Journeymen Masons contributed their Labour for a certain Quantity of hewn Stones; and as this Under∣taking is for the Relief of the diseased, lame, and maimed Poor, even the Day-labourers would not be exempted, but conditioned to work a Day in a Month <HI>gratis</HI> to the Erection. The Ladies too con∣tributed in their own way to it; for they appointed an Assembly for the Benefit of the Work; and it be∣ing well-attended, every one contributed bountifully to it. It has met with no small Encouragement from the Nobility and Gentry; and his Majesty was pleased to give 100<HI>l.</HI> towards it: So that it is really a noble Work, and is now in a flourishing Condition. The following is the Inscription on the first Stone:
<Q><HI>The Royal Infirmary at</HI> Edinburgh,<LB/><HI>Founded</HI> Aug. 2. 1738.<LB/><HI>Earl</HI> Cromarty, <HI>G. M.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Another necessary Charity was setting on foot, as a Correspondent writes me word, in a Letter dated <HI>Edinburgh, July</HI> 24. 1740. and it is to be hoped will be attended with the desired Success. The following is an Abstract of the Letter: <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"Amongst the several pious and commendable Designs which have of late Years been form'd for the Relief of the Helpless and Forlorn, Pity it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that one Case, as claimant as any, <HI>viz.</HI> the INCURABLES, has hitherto escaped publick No∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/>: Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se poor Creatures have, in common

with the others above-mention'd, every thing that can move Sympathy, being equally destitute of Health, Subsistence, and Care, but with this one distinguishing Aggravation of their Calamity, that they are <HI>without Hope,</HI> which is the finishing Stroke of Distress, and changes Misfortune into Misery. When the Learned in Physick and Sur∣gery have pronounced their Diseases <HI>desperate</HI> and <HI>irremediable,</HI> and when upon that Account they have been <HI>set out</HI> of the <HI>Infirmary,</HI> or <HI>refused Ad∣mittance into it,</HI> as being without Compass of the Power of Medicine, or Skill of the Physician to recover them, many of them have no Houses of their own, where they may languish out the tedious Remains of a comfortless Life; so that if they do not soon die in the <HI>Streets</HI> or <HI>Fields,</HI> they must wander to Places where they can have neither <HI>Ministers</HI> nor <HI>Physicians</HI> to bring them that Assistance, and those <HI>Softenings,</HI> which may make unavoidable Death more easy and happy to them.</P><P>"The Consideration of this moving Case being suggested at a late Meeting of some Persons in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> they (touch'd with Compassion of their Fellow-Creatures in such dismal Circum∣stances, and thankful for the Goodness of God to themselves, in preserving them from such Distress) judged it worthy of Attention, and propos'd to raise by Subscription a Fund for this charitable Use, to be under the Guardianship and Administration of the Governors of the <HI>Orphan-Hospital</HI> at <HI>Edin∣burgh.</HI>"</P></Q></P>
<P>What will be done in this Case, I cannot judge; but my Friend has set it forth with so much honest Warmth, and good Sense, that nothing need be added to it, to shew the Necessity of so excellent a Design.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="79"/>The Physicians were incorporated in 1682. by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and have their College near the <HI>Nether-bow</HI> in the <HI>Fountain-close.</HI> They are deserv∣edly esteemed learned and able, and give not place to the Physicians of any Country. The late Dr. <HI>Pitcairn</HI> has left behind him ample Testimonies of his Skill in Nature and Medicine, and bore a Cha∣racter that no Man of his Time, abroad or at home, eclipsed.</P>
<P>On the North-side of the City is an excellent Physick-garden, containing some thousands of Exo∣tick Plants and Simples. The late learned and in∣dustrious Mr. <HI>James Sutherland,</HI> its then Intendant, published an Account of it in 1684. under the Title of <HI>Hortus Medicus Edinburgensis.</HI> They are all dis∣posed into the most rational Method, according to that of the learned Dr. <HI>Morison,</HI> the late <HI>Oxford</HI> Botanist, a Native of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The City is govern'd by a Lord-Provost, whose Office is much the same as that of the Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI>; four Bailiffs, who, besides the Power of Aldermen in the Government of this City, have that of Sheriffs, and a common Council, ordinarily consisting of twenty-five Persons, but extraordina∣rily of thirty-eight. All these are chosen annually; and the Provost, Dean of Guild, and Treasurer, are to be Merchants; or if any Tradesman be chosen, he must quit his Trade, and not return to it with∣out Leave of the Magistrates and Town-Council; and he must also be a Year or two a Member of the common Council. No one is to continue in the Council above two Years at a time, except he be a Member of it by virtue of a superior Office. The Bailiffs are to be chosen indifferently out of twelve Candidates proposed, and none is to be elected Deacon of any of the fourteen incorporated Trades, except he has been Master of his Trade two Years at least; and
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>
must not continue Deacon above two Years at a time. The fourteen incorporated Trades are;

The Magistrates are chosen annually upon the <HI>Tuesday</HI> next after <HI>Michaelmas-day,</HI> by thirty-eight Electors, whereof twenty are to be Merchants and Tradesmen, who are to chuse such as in their Con∣science they think best qualify'd; and these Magi∣strates, and the Town-Council, have the Administra∣tion of the Government, except in some reserved Cases; as the Election of Magistrates, Dean of Guild and Treasurer, and setting of Fews or Leases, giving Boundaries and Places, and other publick Matters; in which Cases they are to consult the fourteen Deacons of Trades.</P>
<P>None of the Merchants or Traders are to have any particular Conventions, or make any By-laws among themselves without Consent of the Magistrates and Town-Council, except to chuse their own Deacons at the appointed Time, to make Persons free of their Trade, or to try their Work; and one of the Com∣missioners for Parliament was always to be chosen out of the Tradesmen, and another out of the Merchants. The Auditors of Accounts are to be chosen out of an equal Number of both. The Lord-Provost, Dean of Guild, and Treasurer, are not to continue longer than two Years at a time; and the Bailiff must be one Year a Bailiff, one Year old Bailiff, and one Year free of Office. Before the Union, the
<PB N="80" REF="81"/>
Lord-Provost for the Time being was always one of the Privy Council.</P>
<P>The Trained Bands of the City consist of sixteen Companies; besides which they have a standing Com∣pany of Town Guards.</P>
<P>And here it will be proper to take notice of the notorious Riot committed in this City on the 7th of <HI>Sept.</HI> 1736. in relation to Capt. <HI>Porteous,</HI> which made so much Noise, and brought down upon this famous City the Resentment of the Legislature of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The Case was this: One <HI>Andrew Wilson</HI> was con∣demned for a Robbery of the publick Money, com∣mitted on the Highway; and on <HI>Wednesday,</HI> the 14th of <HI>April</HI> 1736. the Day appointed for his Ex∣ecution, the Magistrates, being apprehensive that a Rescue would be attempted, ordered Capt. <HI>John Porteous,</HI> at the Head of a Detachment of the City Guard, to attend the Execution; and Powder and Ball were delivered to them for that Purpose. That while <HI>Wilson</HI> was hanging, the Populace, insisting he should be cut down before the usual Time, and being refused, attempted to do it by Force, and meeting Opposition from the Captain and his Guard, they outrageously pelted them with Stones, and hurt several of the Detachment. That hereupon the Captain order'd them, as he was accus'd, but which he deny'd, to fire; and upon the Mob continuing their Insults, and the Captain's Men firing over their Heads to intimidate them, the Captain order'd them to level their Pieces, and fired himself, both which however he deny'd; and by that means six Persons were mortally wounded, and fourteen others very desperately maimed and hurt. That hereupon the Captain was brought to his Tryal, and on a very solemn Hearing, was found guilty of firing a Gun himself, and ordering his Men to fire; and so was condemn'd to be hang'd upon a Gibbet, on the
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
8th of <HI>Sept.</HI> 1736. The Captain drew up a Petition to her late Majesty, then Regent of the Kingdom, in the Absence of the King; and insisted on his Innocency, praying for Mercy; and great Appli∣cation having been made to her Majesty for changing the Sentence to Transportation, a Reprieve for six Weeks, was granted. Which arriving, on the 2d of <HI>September,</HI> at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> occasion'd the most extraordinary Riot that ever was known or heard of, all Circumstances considered, except that at <HI>York</HI> against the <HI>Jews,</HI> mentioned in its Place.</P>
<P>For, on the 7th of <HI>September,</HI> the Night before the Captain was to be executed, had he not been reprieved, about ten at Night, some Men by Surprize enter'd the City, seized all the Fire-arms, Battle-axes, and Drums belonging to the City Guard.</P>
<P>The Mob hereupon, in a few Minutes, lock'd and secur'd all the City Gates, and with Drums beating an Alarm, attempted with Hammers, and other Instruments, to force open the [<HI>Tolbooth</HI>] Pri∣son-door: But failing, they desperately set Fire to it, and burnt it. When they entered the Prison, they made the Under-keeper open the double Locks of the Apartment where the Captain was. He begg'd in vain to be spared till the Afternoon; and making some Resistance, they dragg'd him down Stairs by his Legs, and hurried him away. This was about eleven at Night, and they march'd out with Lights before them. In their Way to the <HI>Grass-market,</HI> passing by a Barber's Sign-post, some called out to hang him up there; but it was resolved to hang him where the Murders, for which he was condemn'd, were committed. So they proceeded to the Place where, on Executions, the Gallows used to be fixed; where they kept him above a Quarter of an Hour, till they open'd a Shop, and brought out a Rope, one End of which they threw over a Sign∣post about 20 Feet high. He desir'd some Time to
<PB N="82" REF="83"/>
prepare for Death; but was answer'd, They would al∣low him no more than those had who were shot. They then pull'd him up in the Dress in which they found him; <HI>viz.</HI> a Night-gown and Cap: His Hands not being ty'd, he fix'd them betwixt his Neck and the Rope, whereupon one with a Battle-ax struck at his Hands. They then let him down, and he having on two Shirts, they wrapt one of them about his Face, and ty'd his Arms with his Night-gown, and then pull'd him up again, where he hung next Morning till Day-light; when he was cut down, and carried to the <HI>Grey-fryars</HI> Church. Upon in∣specting his Body, it appear'd his Left-shoulder was wounded, his Back discolour'd, and his Neck broke. He deny'd his giving Orders to fire, with his last Breath.</P>
<P>It was observ'd, that this Mob was under a stricter Concert, and better Conduct, than usual; for, march∣ing along to the Execution, the unhappy Man ob∣serving a Gentleman of his Acquaintance, he gave him a Purse of twenty-three Guineas, which he desir'd might be deliver'd to his Brother; which they offer'd not to obstruct. They left indeed the Prison∣doors open, whereby several Prisoners escaped; but after they had perpetrated the unprecedented Fact, they left the Arms and Drums at the Place of Exe∣cution, where they were found next Morning. Moreover, during the Tumult, Parties of armed Men, with Drums, patrolled in the different Streets, to prevent any Surprize from the King's Forces quarter'd in the Suburbs. The Magistrates, attended with several of the Burgesses, attempted, as was said, to disperse the Mob; but were pelted with Stones, and threaten'd with Fire-arms, if they did not re∣tire. After the Execution was over, they went to the Lord-Provost's House, and telling him they were satisfy'd, departed, without offering any other Violence. Nay, it was said, that to do the Act
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
with more Decency, having no Clergyman, they order'd two of the gravest among them to exhort the unhappy Man, as they carry'd him to Exe∣cution.</P>
<P>The Boldness, Secrecy, and Conduct of this En∣terprize, was the most extraordinary Instance of its kind that ever was known; and the Keeper de∣claring, that tho' the Persons who first enter'd, and demanded the Keys, wore Leather Aprons, but were otherwise well dress'd, it made some imagine, that Persons above the vulgar Rank had a hand in it.</P>
<P>Be this as it would, the Insult on the Sovereign Authority was too flagrant to be overlook'd. Pro∣clamations, with Rewards of 200<HI>l.</HI> Sterling, were issued for apprehending the Rioters; and when the Parliament met, vigorous Measures were taken in the Affair. The Lord-Provost was order'd up to <HI>London</HI> in Custody, the Magistrates were order'd up also, to attend the House of Lords at <HI>London</HI>; and finally, an Act of Parliament was passed, to disable <HI>Alexander Wilson,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> from holding or enjoying any Office of Magistracy in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> or <HI>Great Britain</HI>; a new Provost was injoin'd to be chosen, and a Fine of Two thousand Pounds levied upon the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for the Use of the Widow of Captain <HI>Porteous,</HI> as Punishments for their respective Re∣missnesses in not endeavouring to prevent this Insult on Sovereignty, and all lawful Authority.</P>
<P>This Act, however, passed not without great De∣bates; and as some thought it impossible to prevent a Design so well concerted, and so suddenly and boldly executed, they were of Opinion, that the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> was treated with too much Severity. But, after all, it could not be expected, but that the Legislature should shew the highest Indignation against so insolent a Riot.</P>
<P>This Act was passed in the 10th Year of his Ma∣jesty, and in the same Session was also passed another,
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>
for the more effectual bringing to Justice any Per∣sons concern'd in this strange Attempt; in which Fugitives not surrendering were made liable to Death: The concealing of those who should be declared Fugitives, was also made Death: This Act was to be read before Morning Sermon in every Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> every <HI>Sunday</HI> for a Year: Impeachers were to be encouraged, and discharged; Informers re∣warded with 200<HI>l.</HI> Sterling for every Person they should convict, and be admitted Witnesses.</P>
<P>But so secretly was this dark Affair managed, that I don't remember any body has suffer'd on the Ac∣count; and the reading of the Act was but indif∣ferently digested by many in that Kingdom.</P>
<P>Greater Severity was intended; such as the im∣prisoning, as well as disqualifying the Lord-Provost for a Year; for abolishing the Town-Guard of the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and for taking away the Gates of the <HI>Nether-bow</HI> Port, and keeping open the same. But the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> was happily saved from this Disgrace.</P>
<P>It is now Time to return to our Subject.</P>
<P>The Churches in this populous City and Suburbs are Twelve, including the Chapel of the Castle: The Ministers about Twenty; besides Three Chapels.</P>

<P><PB N="85" REF="86"/>There are also about twenty Meeting-houses of the Episcopal Party; for tho' Presbytery be the established Religion of <HI>Scotland</HI> since the Revolution, yet a great Number of the People of all Ranks are not of that Opinion, especially in the Nothern Parts.</P>
<P>The Churches are always very full; for the People in this Country do not wander about on the Sabbath-days, as in <HI>England.</HI> They have also one very good Custom as to their Behaviour in Church, which I wish was practised in <HI>England:</HI> If any Person comes in after Divine Service is begun, he takes no Notice of any body, nor any body of him; whereas we make our Bows and Cringes, even in the Middle of our Prayers. Not that the <HI>Scots</HI> want Manners; for they shew them more properly after the Sermon is done, and the Blessing given, when they all look round upon their Friends, especially to Persons of Distinction, and make their Civilities as courteously as we do.</P>
<P>The City is encompassed with a kind of <HI>Roman</HI> Wall on every Side, except the North, where it is secur'd by a Lake.</P>
<P>The Castle only, and the Palace, remain to be mentioned. The first is strong both by Situation and Art, but far from being impregnable, as has been experienced more than once. It was formerly called the <HI>Maiden</HI> Castle, because the <HI>Pictish</HI> Kings kept their Daughters in it. Still more antiently, it was called <HI>Alatum Castrum,</HI> or the <HI>Winged Castle,</HI> per∣haps from its Form, and standing on so high a Hill, as it were in the Air: It is situated at the West-end of the City, as we have said, where the Rock rises to a high and large Summit. 'Tis inaccessible on the South, West, and North. The Entrance is from the Town, where the Rock is also very high, and is defended by a round Battery, and an Out∣work at the Foot of it. In the Castle is a Royal Palace of hewn Stone, where are kept the Regalia,
<PB N="86" REF="87"/>
and chief Records of State, as also the Magazine for the Arms and Ammunition of the Nation.</P>
<P>A Chapel is also in it for the Use of the Garison; and it is furnished with Water by two Wells in the Rock. From the Castle is a delightful Prospect over the City and neighbouring Country, and to the River of <HI>Forth,</HI> from whence it is saluted by such Men of War as come to anchor in <HI>Leith</HI> Road. The Governor is always a Person of prime Quality, and General of the Forces.</P>
<P>The Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, Fort-Ma∣jor, and some other Officers, have very good Apart∣ments; and there are deep Vaults in the Rock, which, they say, are Bomb-proof.</P>
<P>The Palace, called <HI>Holy-rood-house,</HI> is a very handsome Building, rather convenient than large. The Entrance is majestick, and over the Gate is a large Apartment, which the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> claims as Hereditary Keeper of the Palace. Within this is a large, irregular Court, where are Coach-houses and Stables, which, I think, are very improperly placed here; for if they had stood farther off, either in the Park, or without the Out-gate, and a Barrack, or Guard-house, like the Horse-Guards at <HI>White-hall,</HI> built in their Stead, it would have been much more becoming a Royal Palace.</P>
<P>This may be called the <HI>Escurial</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> being both a Royal Palace, and an Abbey, founded by King <HI>David</HI> I. for Canons Regular of St. <HI>Austin,</HI> who named it <HI>Holy-rood-house.</HI> The Entrance from the great outer Court, already described, is adorned with Pillars of hewn Stone, under a Cupola in the Form of an Imperial Crown, balustraded on each Side a-top. The Fore-part has two Wings, on each of which are two Turrets; that towards the North was built by King <HI>James</HI> V. whose Name it bears in Letters of Gold, and that towards the South (as well as all the rest) by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. whereof Sir
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>
<HI>William Bruce</HI> was Architect. The inner Court is very stately, all of Free-stone well hewed, with Piazzas round it, from which there are Entries into the several Apartments, truly royal and magnificent; but above all, the Long Gallery is very remarkable, being adorned with the Pictures of all the <HI>Scots</HI> Kings from <HI>Fergus</HI> I. to <HI>James</HI> VII. inclusive, by masterly Hands. Those Kings that were eminent, and all the Race of <HI>Stuarts,</HI> are in full Length; the others are but Busto's.</P>
<P>You turn to the Right to the Royal Apartments, as at <HI>St. James</HI>'s; and the Stair-case and Guard-room run exactly as there, but far more lofty and magnificent. Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Apartment (as He∣reditary Keeper) is in the double Tower to the North, and the great Council Chamber in the Tower to the South. The Earl of <HI>Perth,</HI> when Chancellor, in the late King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign, converted this noble Room into a Popish Chapel, and his Apartment be∣hind it was the Jesuits School, which being demolished by the Mob at the Revolution, has been neglected ever since. The Chimney-pieces are all of Marble, and the Apartments two Pair of Stairs for the Officers of State are very well kept, being lent to many of the Nobility, who now live in them.</P>
<P>Behind this Palace, the Conventual Church makes a Wing to the North, and Eastward from it is <HI>St. Anne's-yard,</HI> which was designed to be branched out into Gravel-walks, adorned with Statues; but the Revolution coming on, attended with a long and expensive War, and afterwards the Union with <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> prevented its being put in Execution.</P>
<P>The Church is very high to the Roof, and the Pillars are as exquisite as those of <HI>St. George</HI>'s Chapel at <HI>Windsor.</HI> It is an antient, very reverend, but de∣clining Fabrick, and used only as a Burial-place for Persons of Quality. In it King <HI>James</HI> VI. was
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
crowned by Bishop <HI>Hepburn,</HI> assisted by <HI>John Knox,</HI> as was King <HI>Charles</HI> I. by Archbishop <HI>Spotswood.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI> VII. began to erect a magnificent Throne here for the Sovereign, and twelve Stalls for the twelve Knights Companions of the most noble and antient Order of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> or <HI>the Thistle,</HI> which he had revived after a long Disuse: The finest Carvers and other Masters in <HI>Europe</HI> were employed in it. But at the Revolution the Rabble demolished all, and ransacking every Corner, fell upon a Vault quite built up, so as not to be known what it cer∣tainly was, in which were found the Bodies of King <HI>James</HI> V. and <HI>Magdalene</HI> of <HI>Valois,</HI> his first Queen, together with Lord <HI>Darnley</HI>'s, all embalmed and preserved in Pickle; whereby the Malice of <HI>Buchanan,</HI> and others, to blacken Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Memory, was discovered; for she gave him a Royal Funeral suitable to his high Dignity, and did not carry him by Porters privately to a common Burial-place, as that Author had asserted.</P>
<P>The adjoining Park is about four Miles in Circum∣ference; but, which is very odd, there is neither Deer nor Tree in it, and, tho' it be very mountain∣ous, affords good Pasture for Cattle. There is a very high and craggy Rock in it, near half a Mile to the Top, called <HI>Arthur</HI>'s <HI>Seat,</HI> from <HI>Arthur,</HI> the <HI>British</HI> King, who, they say, used to view the adja∣cent Country from thence.</P>
<P>This Palace, or Abbey, and Park, is Sanctuary for Debtors; and no one, but by the King's Order only, can arrest any Man, who has entered his Name in an Office kept there for that Purpose.</P>
<P>It may not be amiss to observe, that according to several Acts of Parliament, divers great publick Works have been undertaken, and mostly brought to Per∣fection, for the Benefit of the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and Town of <HI>Leith,</HI> and their Vicinities, within these few Years past, by Benefit partly of the easy <HI>Scotish</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="90"/>
Tax of Two-pence <HI>Scots</HI> on every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Ale and Beer sold in the said City: And partly of the Discontinuance of what they called the <HI>Petty-port-Customs</HI> there; some of which Works are as follow:</P>
<P>The Magistrates have, at a great Expence, col∣lected the Springs, and renew'd the Pipes which convey Water to the Town; rebuilt the Fountains in the High-street; inlarged the Harbour of <HI>Leith,</HI> and deepened its Chanel; have built several hundred Feet of Key there in a very sufficient manner; have built two new Churches; have paved, at a great Expence, with Causey-stone, the whole High-streets and Ways leading to their City; have made a good Highway from <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to <HI>Leith</HI>; have built a large Workhouse for the Poor, to be employed in Manufacture, and endow'd the same with 300<HI>l. per Annum.</HI> Also have settled Salaries on the Law Professor at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and Stipends on the Mi∣nisters of the two new Churches; have rebuilt the City Walls; and taken Measures for paying their old Debts, as well as those incurred on account of the Rebellion in 1715.</P>
<P>They further proposed also, by means of this Fund, to narrow the noxious Lake on the North-side of the City, commonly called the <HI>North Loch,</HI> into a Canal of running Water; to erect a Street of Communi∣cation to the Fields, on the North-side of the City; to build a proper Hall for the Court of Justiciary, and an Edifice for the publick Records; to establish a Salary to a Professor of Civil History, and <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities; another to a Professor of <HI>Scots</HI> Law, and other publick-spirited Purposes. And all this is provided for and established by an Act, which passed 9 <HI>George</HI> I. <HI>Anno</HI> 1722. confirming and con∣tinuing a <HI>Scotish</HI> Act of Parliament 1693. and an Act of 3 <HI>George</HI> I. to which Act of 9 <HI>George</HI> I. we refer the Reader.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="91"/>I shall just stop to mention an odd Circumstance that was of fatal Consequence to the poor Dogs about <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and <HI>Leith,</HI> in the Month of <HI>April</HI> 1738. A mad Bull-bitch having bitten many Dogs in the <HI>Flesh-market,</HI> to prevent the bad Consequences that might follow, the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> issued a Proclamation, ordering all the Dogs in that Incor∣poration to be forthwith put to Death, under Penalty of 5<HI>l.</HI> Sterling, and Imprisonment to the Owners, for twelve Calendar Months; and to prohibit all Persons from keeping Dogs for thirty Days from that Time: And the Magistrates of <HI>Leith</HI> joining in the Order, nothing was to be seen for several Days, but chasing, hacking, slashing, hanging, and drowning of Dogs; and great Lamentations were heard from divers, for the Loss of their favourite Puppies; for with such Zeal was this Order executed, that the Ladies had enough to do to preserve any of their Lap-dogs; and, as it was, many Gentlemen got rid by it of formidable Rivals.</P>
<P>I shall also take notice here of the Mischiefs done by a terrible Storm, which happen'd <HI>Jan.</HI> 14. 1739. in this City, and the adjacent Parts, of the like of which we have hardly any Example. The Wind began to blow pretty hard between Eleven and Twelve the preceding Night, and before One it rose to a complete Hurri∣cane, and continued with surprising Fury till Four in the Morning.</P>
<P>As the Houses in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> are built high, they suffered considerable Damage. The Leads which cover'd the stately Building in the <HI>Parliament-Close,</HI> were carried off the Roofs, some of them more than forty Feet in Dimensions. The <HI>Canon-gate</HI> Church suffered exceedingly, and the fine Portico there was almost demolish'd. The Consternation was heighten'd by the Alarm of the Fire-Drum; for the Brewery at the East-end of the Meadow, belonging to one Mr. <HI>Bryson,</HI> taking Fire, the Wind increased
<PB N="91" REF="92"/>
the Flame, insomuch that the Water-works proved so many useless Machines; so that the Brewery and House were consumed, and some low Houses at a considerable Distance catching the Flame, were like∣wise reduced to Ashes. Nor was the Fire confined to that Quarter; for, near the <HI>Canon-mills,</HI> on the opposite Part of the Town, a Farm-house, belong∣ing to one Mrs. <HI>Angus,</HI> likewise took Fire, which consum'd it together with the Corn-stacks and Out∣houses. These Fires happen'd not thro' any Negli∣gence, but were intirely occasion'd by the Impetuo∣sity of the Wind, which having got Entrance to the Houses, scatter'd the Fire, and set it in a Glow. A large new House at the Back of the <HI>Canon-gate,</HI> consisting of five Stories, was intirely beaten down. This was the more remarkable, as it had been twice destroy'd before; and the Owner had built it so strongly, that she promis'd herself Security against any Accidents of that kind. The Buildings in the Castle were prodigiously damaged; their fine Lead Coverings were carried off, and thrown upon the Rocks; the Magazine was almost demolish'd, and other considerable Damages done. The Houses at the <HI>Multries-hill,</HI> which lay much exposed, were almost all unroofed, and the new Play-house was quite uncover'd.</P>
<P>This violent Tempest confined not itself to this City: At <HI>Leith</HI> it produced likewise very dismal Effects; several Houses were damaged, and the End of one struck down; the Lead-mill was uncover'd; several of the Ships in the Harbour broke loose, and with such Violence, that they carried along with them the great Iron Rings to which they were fasten'd.</P>
<P>The Shire of <HI>Aire</HI> produced no less dismal Ac∣counts; at <HI>Irvine</HI> it blew so hard, that many of the Ships suffer'd much, and many of the Buildings in the Town were thrown down. At <HI>Aire</HI> the Loss was much greater; a general Havock was made among
<PB N="92" REF="93"/>
the Houses and Shipping, most of which suffer'd; and the <HI>Anne</HI> Galley, bound for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> drove on Shore, and was dash'd to Pieces; but the Crew were happily saved.</P>
<P>The like dismal Account they gave from the <HI>Merse,</HI> where the Storm occasion'd a terrible De∣struction, few Houses being left undestroy'd, and several Churches blown down, and Numbers smo∣thered in the Ruins, and a general Havock made among the Sheep and Cattle.</P>
<P>This Storm did very great Damage in other Parts of the Island, in <HI>South</HI> as well as <HI>North Britain</HI>; but the Effects of it at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> were so terribly remarkable, that we thought the above Particulars would not be amiss to insert here.</P>
<P>Now we are on the Subject of melancholy Acci∣dents, the Reader will excuse me for the following Account of a very deplorable one, which happen'd at <HI>Kirkaldy, Jan.</HI> 7. 1739-40.</P>
<P>It is a well-known Custom, that in these Parts, the first <HI>Monday</HI> of the Year is always observed with uncommon Gaiety and Mirth, and in Consequence becomes a Holy-day to Apprentices and Servants, fourteen of which, belonging to <HI>Path-head,</HI> a little Village adjacent to <HI>Kirkaldy,</HI> having got a little Money, went to divert themselves with a common Amusement among Boys, by throwing up <HI>Thistles or Crowns:</HI> The Place they chose was a Cave, or a large Hollow below a rocky Eminence. As they were thus innocently amusing themselves, the Rock tumbled down, and crush'd them to-pieces. 'Tis scarce possible to form an Idea of the ghastly Sight which their mangled Bodies exhibited. Parents could not distinguish the Corpses of their own Children. The Parts of some who were close together when the Rock fell, were so mingled, that there was no Di∣stinction; and the Carnage was the most dismal that could be imagined. One escap'd by his being at a
<PB N="93" REF="94"/>
greater Distance from the Rock; but his Leg was broke in a vast Number of Places. This fatal Cata∣strophe caused an extraordinary Grief, especially as some Parents lost two, others all their Children.</P>
<P>The following odd Accident happen'd at <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> in <HI>September</HI> 1740. A Soldier belonging to the Regiment in the <HI>Canon-gate,</HI> went to the King's Park on a Sheep-stealing Expedition, where he un∣luckily happen'd to engage with a large headstrong Ram, near one of the Precipices at <HI>Arthur</HI>'s <HI>Seat,</HI> mention'd above, which push'd him headlong from the Top of the Rock, so that they both fell down together, and had their Necks broken. The un∣happy Fellow was found next Morning with a Hand∣ful of the Ram's Wool clench'd in his Fist.</P>
<P>We next visited <HI>Leith,</HI> the Sea-port of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> which is a large and populous Town, or rather two Towns; for the River or Harbour parts them: but they are joined by a stately Stone-bridge, to which Ships of Burden may come, and, at High-water, lay their Sides close to the Shore.</P>
<P>Here is a very fine Quay, well wharfed up with Stone, and fenced with Piles, able to discharge much more Business than the Place can supply, tho' the Trade is far from being inconsiderable. At the Mouth of the Harbour is a very long and well-built Pier, or Head, which runs out beyond the Land a great way, and defends the Entrance into the Har∣bour from being filled up with Sand, as it would otherwise be, when the Wind blows hard at North-east. There are also Ranges of Piles, or Break-waters, as the Seamen call them, on the other Side of the Harbour, all which are kept in good Repair; and by this means the Harbour is preserved, and kept open, in spite of a flat Shore, and a large Swell of the Sea.</P>
<P>On the other Side of the Bridge are the Remains of a strong Castle, built by <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> to com∣mand
<PB N="94" REF="95"/>
the Port, which is not yet so far demolished, but that a little Expence would soon restore it. Here the late Rebel Highlanders made a bold Stop, and took Possession of it for one Night; but not finding their Friends in the City in any Condition to join them, and the Troops preparing to attack them, they quitted it in the Night, and marched off to the Earl of <HI>Winton</HI>'s House, as I have already related.</P>
<P>This Town was once very strong; for the <HI>French</HI> held it for some Years against the Reformers, but were at last driven out by an Army which Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> sent from <HI>England</HI> to assist the Protestants. It is under the Jurisdiction of the Magistrates of <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> and is govern'd by a Bailiff under them.</P>
<P>At <HI>Leith</HI> the Firth is seven Miles over, and holds that Breadth for five or six Miles; but is narrower a little beyond <HI>Cramond,</HI> and at <HI>Queen's-ferry</HI> is re∣duced to two Miles in Breadth. This Place is a very good Town as well as Ferry, and a Corporation, or Royal Burgh. Near the Water of <HI>Leith</HI> is a good Copper Mine.</P>
<P>At <HI>Cramond,</HI> just mention'd, and in the Lands of <HI>Inglestown,</HI> as well as at other Places in this County, <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities have been found; particu∣larly, near the former Place were dug up two Stones, late in Sir <HI>Robert Sibbald</HI>'s Yard at <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> upon one of which is a Laurel Crown, and on the other a <HI>Roman Securis:</HI> they are sup∣posed to have been Part of a Pillar erected in <HI>Domitian</HI>'s Time, when <HI>Agricola</HI> was in these Parts. Near this Place, in the Beginning of <HI>De∣cember</HI> 1740. a Whale between 50 and 60 Feet in Length, and 16 in Depth, was cast on Shore; whose Mate afterwards, tumbling about above the Ferry, was heard to make a hideous Moan, as is supposed, for its Loss.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and this Town the Country is thronged with the Seats of Noblemen and Gentle∣men;
<PB N="95" REF="96"/>
among which the Marquis of <HI>Annandale</HI> has a very pretty one, with a fine Garden inclosed with a Brick Wall, a thing hardly to be seen any-where else in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the want of which is the Reason why the Wall-fruit does not thrive so well as it would otherwise do; for the Stone does not hold the Warmth of the Sun, after it is gone, as the Bricks do.</P>
<P>But the Beauty of this Part of the Country is <HI>Hop∣ton</HI> House, built upon a delightful Plain, on the Bank of the River. It was originally a Square, but there are two Wings lately joined to it, which add greatly to the Beauty of the Building. The Situation is so extremely good, and gives so elegant a Prospect as well to the Sea as to the Land, that nothing can be finer. It is exquisitely finished both within and without; and there are some Pieces of curious Painting in it, besides a great Number of Family Pictures. The Stables and Riding-place are by far the finest and most magnificent in <HI>Scotland</HI>; and his Lordship, who de∣lights in good Horses, has the best, without Compa∣rison, in all the Country. <HI>Hawthornden</HI> also is cele∣brated for its Caves hewn out of the Rock, and <HI>Roslin</HI> for a great stately Chapel.</P>
<P>From hence the Firth widens again, and soon after is three or four Miles wide, and makes a safe and deep Road, with good Anchor-ground, where, if there was a Trade to answer it, a thousand Sail of Ships of any Burden might safely ride.</P>
<P>On the South-shore, upon a narrow Point of Land running into the Water, stands <HI>Blackness</HI> Castle, wherein State-prisoners were confined in former Times, especially such as were taken up for reli∣gious Differences, many of whom miserably perished here, either by the Unhealthiness of the Place, Want of Conveniencies, or something worse. This Castle might be of Use, if the Harbour was frequented; but
<PB N="96" REF="97"/>
as it is not, there seems to be no Occasion for it at present.</P>
<P>Farther West is <HI>Borrows-toun-ness,</HI> a long Town, consisting only of one Street, which is extended along the Shore, close to the Water. It has been, and still is, a Town of the greatest Trade to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>France</HI> of any in <HI>Scotland,</HI> except <HI>Leith</HI>; but it suffers very much of late by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Trade being carried on so much by way of <HI>England.</HI> However, if the <HI>Glasgow</HI> Merchants would settle a Trade to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh</HI> in the Firth, by bringing their foreign Goods by Land to <HI>Alloway,</HI> and exporting them from thence, as they proposed some Time ago, 'tis very likely the <HI>Borrows-toun-ness</HI> Men would come into Business again; for as they have the most Shipping, so they are the best Seamen in the Firth, and are very good Pilots for the Coast of <HI>Holland,</HI> the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and the Coast of <HI>Norway.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S I entered the East-side of <HI>Scotland</HI> at <HI>Berwick upon Tweed,</HI> and have car∣ried on my Account through the <HI>Lo∣thians,</HI> so, having travelled over the West Part at another Journey, when I went from <HI>England</HI> by a different Road, I shall here give you the Particulars of that also.</P>
<P>Passing the River <HI>Esk,</HI> or (as it is commonly called) the <HI>Solway Firth,</HI> beyond <HI>Carlisle,</HI> we entered <HI>Scot∣land</HI> on the Side of <HI>Dumfriesshire.</HI> The Division of this County into <HI>Eskdale, Nithsdale,</HI> and <HI>Annan∣dale,</HI> is but the ordinary marking out the Rivers <HI>Esk, Annan,</HI> and <HI>Nith,</HI> as I observed of the Rivers <HI>Teesdale, Tyndale, Swaledale,</HI> and others, in the North of <HI>England</HI>; for the whole Province makes but one Shire; <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>Dumfries.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="99"/>The <HI>Esk</HI> is a pretty large River, and gives Name to the South-east Part of this County; but we saw very little near it, worth our Notice, except <HI>Kirsop,</HI> a very small Town on a River of the same Name, which afterwards falls into the <HI>Esk,</HI> and is famous for being the Place where, by a Treaty, after the Battle of <HI>Pinkey,</HI> the Limits or Borders of the two King∣doms were settled; tho' the Borderers did not long observe it, but robbed and plundered one another upon all Occasions, as Opportunity offered.</P>
<P>This River soon leaves <HI>Scotland,</HI> and running into the <HI>English</HI> Border, empties itself into the <HI>Solway</HI> Firth, which receives all the Rivers on this Part of the Island, as well from <HI>England</HI> as from <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The first Place of Note we came to in <HI>Scotland</HI> was <HI>Annand,</HI> the chief Town of <HI>Annandale,</HI> which, being a Sea-port, and having a good Harbour, was once a Town of pretty good Trade; but it was often taken by the <HI>English,</HI> who, at last, burnt it to the Ground in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. from which it never recovered. Here was a good Salmon Fishery, and a Trade to <HI>Ireland</HI> by the <HI>Isle of Man</HI>; but most of the Merchants, and Men of Substance, being removed to <HI>Dumfries</HI> the Town continues, to all Appearance, in a State of irrevocable Decay.</P>
<P>The Town and Castle of <HI>Lockmaben</HI> is a Royal Burgh as well as <HI>Annand.</HI> Three Parts of it are surrounded by Lakes, which afford excellent Fish, and one particularly which is found no-where else. The Castle, as well as that of <HI>Annand,</HI> is now demolished.</P>
<P><HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffet</HI> is remarkable for its medicinal Springs. They rise from the Top of a Rock near the Town: There are two Wells near one another. The Waters purge and vomit, and are very good against Colicky and Nephritical Pains, powerfully removing Ob∣structions in the Bowels. They are applied out∣wardly to Ulcers, and for Pains in the Joints. They
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>
have more Virtue in dry Seasons, and in Summer and Autumn, than in Winter and rainy Weather.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Rivel</HI> also deserves to be mention'd, on account of a very good Salt made out of a parti∣cular Sand there, which they gather up and boil.</P>
<P>From <HI>Annand,</HI> keeping the Sea as close as we could to the Left, we went on due West to <HI>Dum∣fries,</HI> a Sea-port Town at the Mouth of the River <HI>Nid,</HI> or <HI>Nith,</HI> which gives Name to the third Di∣vision of the County, called <HI>Nithsdale</HI>; but this Town is the Capital of the whole Shire, and in∣deed of all the South-west Part of <HI>Scotland.</HI> Here, as in some few other Ports on this Side of the Island, the Benefits of Commerce, obtained to this Country by the Union, appear much more visible than on the East-side.</P>
<P><HI>Dumfries</HI> was always a good Town, with large Streets, and full of reputable and wealthy Merchants, who trade into foreign Parts, and employ a con∣siderable Number of Ships, especially since they have embarked in Trade to <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> Plantations. This Town is also advantageously situated for an Increase of Commerce on the River <HI>Nid,</HI> or <HI>Nith</HI>; for tho' it stands near two Leagues from the Sea, yet the Tide flows up to the Town, and Ships of Burden come close up to the Key, and about four Miles below it the largest Merchant-ships in <HI>Britain</HI> may ride in Safety.</P>
<P>Over the River <HI>Nith,</HI> is a very fine Stone-bridge, at this Place, with nine Arches, and so broad, that two Coaches may go abreast on it. Here they have also an Exchange for the Merchants, a handsome Church, a <HI>Tolbooth</HI> or Prison, and a Town-hall for the Use of the Magistrates. They had formerly a Woolen Ma∣nufacture here; but the Union has, in great mea∣sure, suppressed these Things in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> supplying them much better and cheaper: yet, at the same time, it must be observed, that the <HI>Scots</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>
have more than an Equivalent by an open Trade to <HI>England,</HI> and all the <HI>English</HI> Plantations.</P>
<P>The Castle in this Town is very old, yet is still pretty good and strong. This Castle, as well as that at <HI>Carlavrok,</HI> near the Mouth of the River, which has been a very magnificent Structure, belonged for∣merly to the antient Family of the <HI>Maxwells,</HI> Earls of <HI>Nithsdale,</HI> the only remaining Branch of which, being unhappily embarked in the late Rebellion, and taken in Arms at <HI>Preston,</HI> made his Escape out of the Tower, and is now abroad, under Forfeiture.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the Town of <HI>Dumfries</HI> exerted themselves in a distinguishing manner for the present Establishment, in the Year 1715. fortify'd the Town at a great Expence, and provided themselves with Arms and Ammunition: This involving them in a larger Debt, an Act passed, <HI>Anno</HI> 1716. for laying a Duty of Two Pennies <HI>Scots</HI> upon every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Ale or Beer sold within the Town and its Privileges, for paying the said Debts, and for building a new Church, the other being not capacious enough to hold the Inhabitants; and also to make a convenient Harbour there, for the Preser∣vation of Ships, and Improvement of Trade.</P>
<P>This Act enabled them to make some Progress in the design'd Projections; but the Town having been forced to rebuild Part of their old Church, the Council-house and Prison, which were become ruinous, they were render'd unable to proceed in the most useful Parts of their Undertaking; and as the Act expired in the 10th of King <HI>George</HI> II. they procured the same to be continued in that Session for 25 Years longer; and also an additional Duty on the Tonnage of Shipping, and on Goods imported and exported into and out of the Port of <HI>Dumfries:</HI> Which they hope will enable them completely to finish all they intended.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102"/>There are many considerable Woods in this Coun∣ty, the chief of which is <HI>Holy Wood,</HI> where was an Abbey, which gave Surname to the famous Astro∣loger <HI>Johannes de Sacro Bosco,</HI> or <HI>Holy Wood. Drumlanrick</HI> also, the noble Palace of the Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> is remarkable for its Wood of Oak six Miles long.</P>
<P>At this Town the River <HI>Nith</HI> parts the Stewarty of <HI>Galloway,</HI> and the Shire of <HI>Dumfries</HI>; and in the middle of the Bridge over it, is a Gate, which is the Limit between them. This Neighbourhood of <HI>Galloway,</HI> which is a great and rich Province, pro∣motes the Trade of this Place very much.</P>
<P>In <HI>November</HI> 1740. here was a great Struggle, in View to the Elections of Members for the succeeding Parliament, and the Town of <HI>Dumfries</HI> signaliz'd themselves by the following extraordinary Act; which we shall give, without making any Remarks upon it, or the Occasion of it:<Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"At <HI>Dumfries, August</HI> 23. 1740. The said Day, the Deacon Convener, and Deacons of the seve∣ral Corporations, having the Advice and Consent of the Grand Committee, and of the Community and whole Members of the Corporations, taking to their Consideration the Reports and Suspicions now going current upon Persons setting up for Deacons, and the offering, and giving or pro∣mising Compliments, Rewards, Gifts, Remu∣nerations, and good Deeds by themselves, or Trustees interposed, or Persons for their Behoof, either at this present, or at a greater Distance, with Prospect and View of the Election for the five Burghs, for the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> when the ensuing Session is determined; and being desirous to suppress such Methods, and any Report thereof; do, according to all Laws, Divine and Human, Equity and Reason, enact and declare, and be it enacted and declared by
<PB N="102" REF="103"/>
these Presents, That after the Date hereof, no Person or Persons, Members of the several Cor∣porations, whether Deacon, late Deacon, Box-master, late Box-master, Masters, late Masters, or other Members who are qualified to elect, or be elected, in any Station of the Corporation, shall give, promise, offer, or accept, by himself, or any interposed Persons, Relations, or others for their Behoof, or being meaned for the Behoof of the Person, who may be thought capable to receive or give a Vote, either to put himself into any Station of his Corporation, or capaciate him to vote therein, or in Council of the Burgh, for any Person in, of the Council, or out of the Council, any Money, valuable Subject, as Re∣munerations, Reward and Compliment, for any good Deed or Promotion to any Station or Office whatsoever, under the Pain of such Persons, who shall be found giving or receiving, promising or accepting, as above, their being dismissed and re∣moved from their Stations, and losing their Votes in the Corporations: Besides, if Deacon, or in order to promote themselves in that Station, to pay to the General Box-master the Sum of Thirty Pounds Sterling Money; and this to be prosecuted before the Convener and Deacons, or Civil Judge, at their Option, by the General Box-master, and the Probation be by Oath, Writ, or Witnesses, if the same can be found: And these Presents are signed by the Deacons, as instructed by their Corporations, and in their Name, Place and Day aforesaid."</P></Q></P>
<P>We could not pass <HI>Dumfries,</HI> without going out of our Way to see the Castle of <HI>Drumlanrig,</HI> the fine Palace of the Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> just mentioned, which stands at 12 Miles Distance, upon the same River. The Vale on either Side is pleasant, and tolerably good: But when these rapid Rivers over∣flow
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
their Banks, they do not, like <HI>Nile,</HI> or even like the <HI>Thames,</HI> and other Southern Streams, fatten and enrich the Soil; but, on the contrary, they lodge so much Sand and Splinters of Stone upon the Surface of the Earth, and among the Roots of the Grass, that it spoils and beggars it; nay, the Water is sometimes hurried on with such Force, that it washes the best Part of the Earth away, where the Soil is light.</P>
<P><HI>Drumlanrig</HI> is like a fine Picture in a dirty Grotto, or an Equestrian Statue set up in a Barn. It is en∣vironed with Mountains, which have the wildest and most hideous Aspect of any in all the South Part of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>We were not so surprised with the Height of the Mountains, and the Barrenness of the Country be∣yond them, as we were with the Manners of the People, who are not so polished here, as in the other Parts of <HI>Scotland.</HI> But what was most wonderful, was to see so glorious a Palace, with such fine Gar∣dens, and every thing about it so truly magnificent, standing in a wild and mountainous Country, where nothing but what was desolate and dismal could be expected. However, the Situation, like that of <HI>Chatsworth</HI> in <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> is certainly a Foil to the Buildings, and sets them off with greater Advantage.</P>
<P>If you come to the Palace by the Road, which leads to it from <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> you pass the River <HI>Nith,</HI> which is there both broad and deep, over a stately Stone-bridge, erected by the noble Founder of the Castle, and Builder of the House, the first Duke of <HI>Queensberry.</HI></P>
<P>The Building is Four-square, with Roundels in the inner Angles of the Court, in every one of which is a Stair-case, and a kind of Tower on the Top. It stands on the Summit of a rising Ground, which is beautifully laid out in Slopes and Terraces. At the Extent of the Gardens are Pavilions and Banquet∣ing-houses
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
exactly answering to one another; and the Greens, Espaliers, and Hedges, are in great Perfection.</P>
<P>The Apartments are fine and richly furnished. The Gallery is filled from one End to the other with Family Pictures of the Duke's Ancestors, most of them at full Length, and in their Robes of State, or of Office. <HI>William,</HI> the first of the Family, was a younger Son of <HI>James</HI> Earl of <HI>Dowglas,</HI> who got the Barony of <HI>Drumlanrig</HI> by a Deed from his Father, as his Portion, in the Time of King <HI>Robert</HI> III. He was afterwards sent Embassador to <HI>England</HI> to ran∣som King <HI>James</HI> I. who was detained there. In the Year 1708. the late Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> was created Duke of <HI>Dover,</HI> as also Marquis of <HI>Beverly,</HI> and Baron of <HI>Rippon,</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The next Trip we made was to <HI>Galloway,</HI> so called from the <HI>Gauls,</HI> from whom the antient In∣habitants descended. It is divided into two different Districts; that towards the West is called the Shire of <HI>Wigton,</HI> and the other towards the East, which, as I said before, begins at the middle of the Bridge of <HI>Dumfries,</HI> is called the Stewarty of <HI>Kirkcudbright,</HI> of which the <HI>Maxwells,</HI> Earls of <HI>Nithsdale,</HI> were Heretable Stewards. The Country hereabouts seems one continued Heath, proper for Grazing small Cattle, which are generally sold in <HI>England</HI>; and where-ever you perceive a Grove of Trees, you may depend upon it there is a Laird's House near it, which are mostly old Towers of Stone, strongly built, to prevent a Surprize from Inroads, which were frequent between the two Nations, before the Death of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>The first Town of Note on the Coast is <HI>Kirkcud∣bright:</HI> Tho' its Situation is extremely convenient for carrying on a very advantageous Commerce, we saw nothing but a Harbour without Ships, a Port without Trade, and a Fishery without Nets. This
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
is owing partly to the Poverty, and partly to the Disposition of the Inhabitants, who are indeed a sober, grave, religious Sort of People, but have no Notion of acquiring Wealth by Trade; for they strictly obey the Scriptures in the very Letter of the Text, by <HI>being content with such Things as they have.</HI> The River <HI>Dee,</HI> which enters the Sea here, and forms the Harbour, comes out of the Mountains near <HI>Carrick,</HI> and is so full of Turnings and Meanders, that, tho' it is not above 70 Miles in a Line, it runs near 200 Miles in its Course.</P>
<P>The Country of <HI>Galloway</HI> lies due West from <HI>Dumfries</HI>; and as that Part of it they call the <HI>Upper Galloway</HI> runs out farther into the <HI>Irish</HI> Seas than the rest, all that Bay on the South-side may be reckoned Part of <HI>Solway Firth,</HI> as all on the North-side is called the <HI>Firth of Clyde,</HI> tho' near 50 Miles from the River itself.</P>
<P>The Western <HI>Galloway,</HI> or the Shire of <HI>Wigton,</HI> runs out with a Peninsula so far into the Sea, that from the utmost Shores you see the Coast of <HI>Ireland</HI> as plain as you see <HI>Calais</HI> from <HI>Dover. Port Patrick,</HI> which is the ordinary Place for the Ferry or Passage to <HI>Belfast</HI> and other Ports in <HI>Ireland,</HI> has a tolerable good Harbour, and a safe Road; but there is very little Use for it; the Packet-boat, and a few fishing Vessels, are the Sum of its Navigation. There was nothing here to invite our Stay; for 'tis a mean dirty homely Place: and as we had no Business but to see the Coast, we came away very ill satisfied with our Accommodation. Upon a Hill near the Town, we could plainly see <HI>Ireland</HI> to the South-west, the Coast of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> and the <HI>Isle of Man</HI> to the South-east, and the <HI>Isle of Ila,</HI> and the Mull of <HI>Kintyre,</HI> to the North-west.</P>
<P>As we passed into the Peninsula, we stopt at <HI>Stranrawer,</HI> situate on the North-side of the Isthmus, which is formed by two Arms of the Sea; one on
<PB N="106" REF="107"/>
the North-side, called <HI>Lochrain</HI>; and the other on the South, called the Bay of <HI>Glenluce.</HI> On each Side of this Isthmus is an excellent Road for Ships: But we could discover no Genius in the People for Trade, or for Sea Affairs of any Kind.</P>
<P>Six Miles South of <HI>Wigton</HI> lies <HI>Whithern,</HI> the antient <HI>Candida Casa,</HI> a Royal Burgh, but very poor, especially since the Dissolution of the Priory. In this Town was the Seat of the Bishop of <HI>Galloway,</HI> which was founded by St. <HI>Ninian</HI> about 1200 Years ago.</P>
<P>But tho' the People of <HI>Galloway,</HI> especially on the Sea Coast, are much to blame for not falling in to Commerce, Navigation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet they are not quite idle; for they are great Cultivators of the Earth, and Breeders of Cattle, of which they send above 50000 Head every Year to <HI>England.</HI> Besides, they have the best Breed of strong, low, punch Horses in <HI>Britain,</HI> if not in <HI>Europe,</HI> which are from thence called <HI>Galloways.</HI> These Horses, which are very much bought up in <HI>England,</HI> are remarkable for be∣ing good natural Pacers, strong, easy Goers, hardy, gentle, well-broken, and, above all, not apt to tire.</P>
<P>Proceeding from <HI>Lower Galloway</HI> hither, we had like to have been driven down the Stream of a River, tho' a Countryman went before for our Guide; for the Water swelled upon us as we passed, and the Stream was very strong, so that we were obliged to turn our Horses Heads to the Current, and sloping over, edg'd near the Shore by Degrees; whereas, if our Horses had stood directly cross the Stream, they could not have kept their Feet. The Inhabitants follow Fishing, as well in the Sea, as in the Ri∣vers and Loughs, which lie every-where under the Hills; it which, about <HI>September,</HI> they catch an in∣credible Number of excellent Eels; by which they are no less Gainers, than by their little Horses.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="108"/>This Part of the Country is very mountainous, and some of the Hills prodigiously high; but they were all covered with Sheep, and other Cattle, the Gentlemen hereabouts being the greatest Sheep-masters, (for so they call themselves) and the greatest Breeders of Black Cattle and Horses, in the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>We now entered the Shire of <HI>Aire,</HI> full North from the Mull, or North-point of <HI>Galloway:</HI> And as we, before, coasted the South Bay, or Firth of <HI>Sol∣way,</HI> which parts <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Scotland,</HI> so now we coasted the Firth of <HI>Clyde,</HI> which, for near 60 Miles, lies on the West-side of the Shore, standing away North-east from the Point of the Mull. This Shire is divided into three great Bailleries; <HI>viz. Car∣rick, Kyle,</HI> and <HI>Cunningham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Carrick</HI> is a more fruitful and better cultivated Country than <HI>Galloway,</HI> and not so mountainous; but it does not so much abound in Cattle, especially Sheep and Horses. Tho' there is no considerable Port in this Part of the Country, yet the People begin to trade here, and those who live towards the Coast are great Fishermen, and are employed by the Mer∣chants of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> and other Places, to catch Her∣rings for them. <HI>May-bole</HI> is the chief Town; but tho' it stands on the Coast, it has no Harbour, and is poor and decayed. The Market is pretty good, because there are many Gentlemen in the Neigh∣bourhood, and the Coast near it full of People; but the Houses are mean, low, and very coarse. The Family of <HI>Kennedy,</HI> Earls of <HI>Cassils,</HI> are or were Lords of great Part of the Country, and have a good an∣tient Seat; but we did not go to see it.</P>
<P>Coming to the North Bounds of <HI>Carrick,</HI> we passed the River <HI>Dun</HI> over a Bridge of one Arch, con∣sisting of 90 Feet; which is much larger than the <HI>Rialto</HI> at <HI>Venice,</HI> or the middle Arch of the great Bridge at <HI>York.</HI> We found many large ones in this
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>
Country, tho' I think, none so large as this, except at <HI>Glasgow</HI> and <HI>Stirling.</HI> This Bridge led us into the County of <HI>Kyle,</HI> the second Division of the Shire of <HI>Aire.</HI> Here I observed, that, contrary to our Ex∣pectation, we found, the farther North we travelled, the Country was the finer, better, and richer.</P>
<P><HI>Kyle</HI> is more populous than <HI>Carrick</HI>; and the Soil being better here, and the Country more plain and level, so on the Banks of the River there are abun∣dance of Gentlemens Seats, tho' most of them are built Castle-wise, because of Enemies. But that Fear being now over, they begin to plant and inclose after the Manner of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> Writers tell us a long Story of a great Battle in this Country between <HI>Coilus,</HI> or <HI>Kylus,</HI> a <HI>British</HI> King, and their <HI>Fergus</HI> I. where the former was killed, and from thence the Country took his Name. Many Monuments of this Battle are still to be seen here. The Place where were it was fought is called <HI>Coil-field</HI>; a Church near it, is called <HI>Coil-town</HI> Kirk. The River near which it was won, and which falls into the River <HI>Aire,</HI> four Miles above the Town of <HI>Aire,</HI> is called <HI>Coil</HI>; a Lake not far from it, near which the <HI>Scots</HI> encamped, is called <HI>Lake Fergus.</HI> A Trumpet resembling a crooked Horn, which has a very shrill Sound, was digged up in the Field of Battle, and is still kept in the Laird of <HI>Caprington</HI>'s House, called <HI>Coil-field,</HI> and made use of to call his Servants and Workmen together. Here, or, as some say, at <HI>Largis</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Clyde,</HI> was another bloody Battle in the Year 1263. between King <HI>Alexander</HI> III. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Acho,</HI> King of <HI>Norway,</HI> who came to the Port of <HI>Aire</HI> with a great Fleet of Ships, and 20,000 Men, who, after ravaging the Country, was routed, and lost both his Army, and 140 Ships. At this last Battle, an <HI>Irish</HI> Gentleman, of the Name of <HI>Mackenzie,</HI> behaved so well, that King <HI>Alexander</HI> gave him the
<PB N="109" REF="110"/>
Lands of <HI>Kintail,</HI> which continued in the Possession of the Earl of <HI>Seaforth,</HI> his Successor, till the late Earl taking Part with the Pretender, his Estate became forfeited. From this brave <HI>Irishman,</HI> are descended the numerous Name of <HI>Mackenzie.</HI></P>
<P>Over the River <HI>Aire</HI> is a Bridge of Four Arches, near the new Town; and South of the Bridge stands the old Town of <HI>Aire</HI> or <HI>Erigena,</HI> famous for its Antiquity and Privileges. It has a very large Jurisdiction of near 64 Miles, reaching from the Mouth of <HI>Clyde</HI> to the Borders of <HI>Galloway.</HI> It stands on a sandy Plain, but has pleasant green Fields two Miles South and North of it. In the Fields betwixt the Mouth of the River <HI>Dun</HI> and <HI>Aire,</HI> stands a very beautiful Church. The Town has a very good Harbour in the River, and lies conveniently for Trade: And 'tis easy to see, that it has been much larger, than it is at present. It is now like an old Beauty, and shews the Ruins of a good Face, but is still decaying every Day; and from having been the fifth best Town in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as the Townsmen say, it is now the fifth worst; which is owing to the Decay of its Trade: So true it is, that Commerce is the Life of Cities, of Nations, and even of Kingdoms. What was the Reason of the Decay of Trade in this Place, is not easy to determine, the People themselves being either unwilling or unable to tell. Here, over the River <HI>Irvin,</HI> which divides <HI>Aire</HI> from <HI>Cunningham,</HI> is a good Bridge of four Arches. <HI>Aire</HI> is noted for the treacherous Murder of many Noblemen and Gentle∣men by the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Wallace</HI>'s Time; when they were called together during a Truce (after <HI>Edward</HI> I. had over-run the Country) on Pretence of holding a Court of Justice, and were treacherously hanged one after another, as they entered the King's large Barns, where the Court was held.</P>
<P>This was as severely, as justly, revenged by <HI>Wal∣lace,</HI> with whom, as Warden of <HI>Scotland,</HI> they had
<PB N="110" REF="111"/>
made the Truce, and whom they endeavoured to entice thither by their Charter of Peace, as they had done a great many others of Quality. But he, having Notice of what had passed, surprised them that very Night in their Jollity, rejoicing that they had, as they thought, by these treacherous Murders, secured <HI>Scotland</HI> for ever; and having set Guards round the Barn, that none should escape, he burnt all the <HI>English</HI> in them. The Ruins of those Barns are still shewn here.</P>
<P><HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> built a Citadel at <HI>Aire,</HI> well fortify'd with a Fosse, and a Stone Wall. At the Restoration it was demolished; and at present only some Houses, and Angles of the Ramparts, are standing.</P>
<P>Two Miles North of <HI>Aire</HI> Town stands <HI>Kincase,</HI> which has been, from Time immemorial, a Place of Retirement for Leprous Persons.</P>
<P>From <HI>Aire,</HI> keeping still North, we came to <HI>Irwin,</HI> upon a River of the same Name. Here they have a Port, which formerly was in much better Condition than it had been for some Years past, the Harbour being so much decay'd by Length of Time, and other Accidents, that the Trade of the Town began to decay; for the Water not being confined to its proper Chanel, the Harbour became so choaked up with Sand-Banks, that it was of little Use to what it had been; so that Ships of very small Burden were freqently shut up for several Months in the River, before they could sail out to Sea. At the same time the Town-house, Church, Streets, and other publick Works, as the common Gaol, and one of the Arches of the Bridge, were all in a ruinous Condition: All which occasion'd an Act of Parliament to pass in the Ninth of King <HI>George</HI> II. for laying a Duty of Two-pennies <HI>Scots</HI> upon every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Ale or Beer sold in the Town of <HI>Irvin,</HI> and its Liberties; and a Duty of a Penny Sterling
<PB N="111" REF="112"/>
upon every Ton of Coals shipped off for Trans∣portation. By which means the Harbour will soon be restored to its pristine Goodness, and the Town to its former flourishing Condition. But thus much must be said, that notwithstanding the declining Condition of its Harbour, before this Act passed, it carried on a greater Trade, than most of the Ports between <HI>Aire</HI> and <HI>Dumfries.</HI> Their chief Trade is in <HI>Scots</HI> Coal, which they export in great Quantities to <HI>Ireland</HI>; for the neighbouring Hills abound with this Commodity. <HI>Irvin</HI> is the Capital of that Di∣vision of the Shire of <HI>Aire,</HI> which they call <HI>Cun∣ningham,</HI> and is really within the Firth of <HI>Clyde,</HI> tho' not actually within the River itself. The Name of <HI>Cunningham</HI> signifies, <HI>the King's Habitation,</HI> from the Beauty of its Situation.</P>
<P>As it has more Trade than the other Parts I have been speaking of, so it is better built. Here are two handsome Streets, a good Quay, and a capacious Har∣bour. The Country is rich and fruitful, filled with Gentlemens Seats and well-built Houses; and where∣ever you turn your Eye, you see nothing but beauti∣ful Enclosures, pleasant Pastures, and Grass Grounds, so that we thought ourselves in <HI>England</HI> again. It is said, this inclosing the Ground was owing to the <HI>English</HI> Soldiers, who were placed here and in <HI>Kyle</HI> by <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> (for at <HI>Aire</HI> he built a Citadel, as I have said); these prompted and encouraged the People to inclose and improve their Lands, and in∣structed them in the Manner of Husbandry practised in <HI>England,</HI> which they have not forgot to this Day.</P>
<P>A very extraordinary Storm of Thunder and Lightning happened here, on the 26th of <HI>November</HI> 1740. which deserves to be taken notice of, for the Terror it occasion'd, it being equally uncommon for the Season of the Year, and the Climate.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="113"/>At Noon began to fall a very heavy Rain, which ended in such a Shower of large Hail, that every body betook themselves to Shelter from its Violence. This was followed with a sudden and most dread∣ful Flash of Fire, and Crack of Thunder. The Lightning accompanied the Thunder, which did not continue rolling, as usually, short and quick; but the Noise seemed greater and more frightful, than as if all the Ordnance on Earth had been at one Instant discharged. The Whole seemed to break upon the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> and Steeple; drove in much of the Roof on two Sides, so as Waggons might pass thro'; the Steeple was much shattered, and the Crevices large. The Town-clock was broke to Pieces, the Work either calcin'd or melted. The strong Door of the Prison was burst up (notwithstanding its large iron Bars). A Lad of Fourteen was killed as he stood at a Win∣dow, and his Cloaths intirely consumed; his Brother, aged Twelve, was thrown down near by him; an∣other Brother was struck blind; their Aunt had all her Cloaths burnt to Ashes on one Side, and even her Skin flay'd off, worse than could have been done by any Blistering-plaister; her other Side seem'd untouch'd. 'Tis observable, that not one Bone of any of them was broken, tho' every Hair was singed, and that the sulphureous Stench about them was intolerable. Many other Persons were also grievously hurt. Two Sailors coming from the Quay, said, that a large Pillar of Fire struck them in the Face, which brought them to their Knees. One Mr. <HI>Cunningham</HI> said, it appear'd to him as a most voluminous Pillar of Fire, proceeding quick as from the Mouth of Cannon; and, that he thought, from the uncommon Smoke over the <HI>Tolbooth,</HI> that it had been all on Fire; he was thrown down, and his Foot much hurt. The People had scarce recovered their Senses, when two other Cracks of Thunder gave fresh Grounds of Terror; so that it was apprehended the
<PB N="113" REF="114"/>
General Judgment approached, and every one pro∣strated themselves in Humility, imploring Mercy from on high; but these last, tho' terrible and un∣common, were nothing to the first. Great hewn Stones were carried violently out of the Steeple to Baillie <HI>Nesbitt</HI>'s House, where they left Impressions.</P>
<P>A little from <HI>Irvin</HI> stood <HI>Kilmarnock</HI> Castle, the Seat of the Family of the <HI>Boyds,</HI> Earls of <HI>Kilmar∣nock,</HI> which on the 15th of <HI>March</HI> 1738-9. was intirely consumed, with the Furniture, and a curious Collection of Books in MSS. nothing being saved but the Charter-chest. On the other Side is the Castle of <HI>Eglington,</HI> the Seat of the antient Family of the <HI>Montgomeries,</HI> Earls of <HI>Eglington.</HI> On the North-east Borders of this County, where it joins to <HI>Clydsdale,</HI> is the Castle of <HI>London,</HI> the noble and beautiful Seat of the Earl of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Bay of <HI>Clyde</HI> stands the Town of <HI>Largis,</HI> famous for the Defeat of the <HI>Norwegians</HI> by King <HI>Alexander</HI> III. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which some give to <HI>Kyle,</HI> as we have said above.</P>
<P><HI>Kilmaers,</HI> in the same County, is the Seat of the noble and antient Family of <HI>Cunningham,</HI> Earls of <HI>Glencairn. Camden</HI> says, that the Family derives its Original from one of that Name concerned in the Murder of <HI>Thomas à Becket,</HI> who fled into <HI>Scotland</HI> on that Account, and therefore bear an Episcopal Pall in their Arms; but it is plain from their Motto, <HI>Over, Fork, over,</HI> that it is a Fork, and not an Epi∣scopal Pall: and the Family, no doubt, is of a much higher and nobler Original.</P>
<P>In the Sea lies <HI>Lady Isle,</HI> where is great Plenty of Rabbets and Fowl, but no Inhabitants.</P>
<P>With the Division of <HI>Cunningham</HI> I quitted the Shire of <HI>Aire,</HI> which is, without Exception, one of the pleasantest Counties in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Joining to it North, and bordering on the <HI>Clyde</HI> itself, lies the Shire, or rather Barony of <HI>Renfrew,</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="115"/>
which was the antient Estate of the <HI>Stuarts</HI> before they succeeded to the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI>; and his Royal Highness the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> among other Titles, is now styled Baron of <HI>Renfrew.</HI> It is a pleasant, rich, and populous Country; and tho' the Soil is not thought to be so good as in <HI>Cunningham,</HI> yet that is abundantly recompensed by the Neigh∣bourhood of <HI>Glasgow</HI> and the <HI>Clyde,</HI> and the great Commerce of both.</P>
<P>We kept our Rout from <HI>Irvin</HI> along the Coast, as near as we could; so that we saw all the Firth of the <HI>Clyde,</HI> and the very Opening itself, which is just at the West-corner of this County. There are some Villages and Fishing Towns within the Mouth of this River which have good Business.</P>
<P>The first Town of Note is called <HI>Greenock,</HI> which seems not to be an antient Place, but to be grown up in later Years by being a good Road for Ships to ride in that come into, and go out from <HI>Glasgow,</HI> as Ships for <HI>London</HI> do in the <HI>Downs.</HI> The Town is well-built, has many rich trading Families in it, and a Castle to command the Road. It is the chief Place in the West of <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Herring Fishing; and the Merchants of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> who are concerned in it, employ their Vessels for catching and curing the Fish, and for carrying them Abroad to Market afterwards; and their being ready on all Hands to go to Sea, makes them often leave the Care of their own Ships to the <HI>Greenock</HI> Men, who are good Seamen, and excellent Pilots for those difficult Seas.</P>
<P>At the West-end of a Bay on the Firth is a small Town, called <HI>Gowrock,</HI> where is a noted Road and Harbour lately fitted up.</P>
<P><HI>Paisley</HI> also stands in this County on the River <HI>Cart</HI>; and, tho' no Borough, is larger than <HI>Renfrew</HI>; and was formerly noted for its noble Abbey of the Order of <HI>Cluny</HI>; the Monks of which wrote a Chronicle called, <HI>The black Book of Paisley.</HI> The
<PB N="115" REF="116"/>
Abbey and Church, with fair Gardens and Orchards, and a little Park for fallow Deer, are all inclosed with a Stone Wall about a Mile in Circuit: The Water of the River <HI>Whitecart,</HI> upon which <HI>Paisley</HI> stands, is commended for its Largeness, and the Pearls frequently found thereabouts, and three Miles above. They commonly fish for them in Summer∣time, and meet with them in a Shell-fish larger than an ordinary Muscle, at the Bottom of the Water. It lies on the West-side of <HI>Clyde</HI> over-against <HI>Glas∣gow.</HI> The Remains of the Abbey are still to be seen, and the Town bears the Marks of having been fortified. At the West-end of the Town are the Remains of a large <HI>Roman</HI> Camp and <HI>Praetorium,</HI> supposed to be vaulted underneath, because the Ground, when trod upon, sounds hollow. Here it was <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> was defeated by her re∣bellious Subjects under the Bastard Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> from whence she took Refuge in <HI>England,</HI> and was there most <HI>inhospitably</HI> imprisoned for several Years, and at last beheaded. In the Lands of <HI>Newyards,</HI> near <HI>Paisley,</HI> on a high Ground, is a Fountain noted for ebbing and flowing with the Tide.</P>
<P>The Country between <HI>Paisley</HI> and <HI>Glasgow,</HI> on the Bank of <HI>Clyde,</HI> I take to be one of the most agreeable Places in <HI>Scotland</HI> for its Situation, Ferti∣lity, Healthiness, and for the Benefits it receives from the Neighbourhood of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> and the Sea.</P>
<P>I am now come to the Bank of <HI>Clyde</HI>; but my Method here, as in <HI>England,</HI> forbids my wandering North, till I have given you a full View of the South. The <HI>Clyde</HI> and the <HI>Forth</HI> may be said to cross <HI>Scotland</HI> here, their two Firths not being above 20 Miles distant from one another, which, if joined, would divide it very near in the Centre.</P>
<P>Nor can I refrain mentioning how easy a Work it would be to make a Navigation from the <HI>Forth</HI> to the <HI>Clyde,</HI> joining the two Seas, as the King of
<PB N="116" REF="117"/>
<HI>France</HI> has done in a Place five hundred times more difficult, namely, from <HI>Tholouse</HI> to <HI>Narbonne</HI>; and as the late Czar of <HI>Muscovy, Peter,</HI> justly surnamed <HI>The Great,</HI> did in several Places of infinitely greater Difficulty and Expence. What an Advantage in Commerce would this be? It would establish a Trade between <HI>Ireland</HI> and the Merchants in <HI>Glasgow,</HI> and open a Communication between the West-coast of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the East of <HI>England,</HI> even to <HI>London</HI>; nay, several Ports of <HI>England</HI> on the <HI>Irish</HI> Sea, from <HI>Liverpool</HI> Northward, would all trade with <HI>London</HI> by such a Canal. It would take up a Volume to lay down the several Advantages that would imme∣diately accrue from such a Navigation, and in par∣ticular in Times of War; but it must lie till Poste∣rity, by the rising Greatness of their Commerce, shall not only feel the Want of it, but find them∣selves inclinable, as well as able, to effect it.</P>
<P><HI>Glasgow</HI> is the Emporium of the West of <HI>Scotland,</HI> being, for its Commerce and Riches, the second in this Northern Part of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> It is a large, state∣ly, and well-built City, standing on a Plain, in a manner four-square; and the four principal Streets are the fairest for Breadth, and the finest built, that I have ever seen in one City together. The Houses are all of Stone, and generally uniform in Height, as well as in Front. The lower Stories for the most part stand on vast square <HI>Dorick</HI> Columns, with Arches which open into the Shops, adding to the Strength, as well as Beauty, of the Building. In a Word, 'tis one of the cleanliest, most beautiful, and best-built Cities in <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>It stands on the Side of a Hill, sloping to the Ri∣ver; only that Part next the River, for near one-third of the City, is flat, and by this means, ex∣posed to the Water upon any extraordinay Flood: It is situated upon the East Bank of the <HI>Clyde,</HI> which is not navigable to the Town but by small Vessels.
<PB N="117" REF="118"/>
Its Port therefore is <HI>Newport-Glasgow,</HI> which stands near the <HI>Clyde</HI>'s Mouth, and is an Harbour for Ships of the greatest Burden. Here it is on a good Wharf or Quay the Merchants load and unload. Their Custom-house is also here, and their Ships are here repaired, laid up, and fitted out either here or at <HI>Greenock,</HI> where Work is well done, and Labour cheap.</P>
<P>The City is join'd to the Suburbs on the West Bank of the <HI>Clyde</HI> by the noble Bridge I have mentioned.</P>
<P>Where the four principal Streets meet, the Cros∣sing makes a very spacious Market-place, as may be easily imagined, since the Streets are so large. As we come down the Hill from the North-gate to this Place, the Tolbooth and Guild-hall make the North-west Angle, or Right-hand Corner of the Street, which is now rebuilt in a very magnificent Manner. Here the Town-council sit, and the Magistrates try such Causes as come within their Cognizance, and do all their other publick Business. So that, as will be easily conceived, the Tolbooth stands in the very Centre of the City. It is a noble Structure of hewn Stone, with a very lofty Tower, and melodious hourly Chimes. All these four principal Streets are adorned with several publick Buildings.</P>
<P>But the chief Ornament of this City is the Col∣lege or University, a most magnificent and stately Fabrick, consisting of several Courts. The Front to the City is of hewn Stone, and excellent Archi∣tecture. Its Precincts were lately inlarged by some Acres of Ground purchased for it by publick Money; and it is separated from the rest of the City by a very high Wall.</P>
<P>It owes its Erection to Archbishop <HI>Turnbull,</HI> and was legally founded by King <HI>James</HI> II. in 1453. by virtue of a Bull from Pope <HI>Nicolas</HI> V. granting it all the Privileges, Liberties, Honours, Immunities,
<PB N="118" REF="119"/>
and Exemptions, given by the Apostolical See to the College of <HI>Bononia,</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> for teaching Uni∣versal Learning. A Rector, a Dean of the Faculty, a Principal or Warden, who was to teach Theology, three Philosophy-Professors, were established by the first Foundation; and afterwards some Clergymen taught the Civil and Canon Law there.</P>
<P>In 1577. King <HI>James</HI> VI. established a Principal, three Professors of Philosophy, four Bursars, a Steward to furnish their Table, a Servant for the Principal, a Janitor to look after the Gate, and a Cook.</P>
<P>The Family of <HI>Hamilton</HI> gave some of the Ground on which the College stands, with an adjacent Field.</P>
<P>Kings, Parliaments, the City of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> several of the Archbishops, and many particular Persons, have been Benefactors to it.</P>
<P>In 1662. the Earl of <HI>Dundonald</HI> gave 1000<HI>l.</HI> Sterling to it, for the Maintenance of poor Scholars. The great <HI>Buchanan,</HI> and the famous <HI>Cameron</HI> had, among other eminent Men, their Education here.</P>
<P>Several fine <HI>Roman</HI> Stones, digged up in the Latter-end of 1740. near <HI>Kirkentilloch,</HI> with very curious Inscriptions, have been removed to this Uni∣versity, where before was a good Collection of Pieces of Antiquity, chiefly found near the same Place.</P>
<P>In the higher Part of the City stands the great Church, formerly Cathedral and Metropolitan, de∣dicated to St. <HI>Mungo,</HI> who was Bishop here about the Year 560. It is a magnificent and stately Edifice, and surprises the Beholders with its stupendous Big∣ness, and the Workmanship of the Artizan. The several Rows of Pillars, and the exceeding high Spire which rises from a square Tower in the middle of the Cross, shew a wonderful Piece of Architecture. It is now divided into several Preaching-places, one above the other.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="120"/>Near the Church stands a ruinous Castle, formerly the Residence of the Archbishop, who was legal Lord or Superior of the City, which stands on his Ground, and from whom it received its first Charter, and many Privileges. It is encompassed with an ex∣ceeding high Wall of hewn Stone, and has a fine Prospect into the City.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Montrose</HI> has so great an Interest here, and in the Country round, that he is, in a Civil Sense, Governor of this City, as he is legally of their University, and much beloved in these Parts.</P>
<P><HI>Glasgow</HI> is a City of Business, and has the Face of Foreign as well as Domestick Trade; nay, I may say, 'tis the only City in <HI>Scotland,</HI> at this Time, that ap∣parently increases in both. The Union has, indeed, answered its End to them, more than to any other Part of the Kingdom, their Trade being new formed by it; for as the Union opened the Door to the <HI>Scots</HI> into our <HI>American</HI> Colonies, the <HI>Glasgow</HI> Merchants presently embraced the Opportunity; and tho', at its first concerting, the Rabble of this City made a formidable Attempt to prevent it, yet afterwards they knew better, when they found the great Increase of their Trade by it; for they now send near 50 Sail of Ships every Year to <HI>Virginia, New England,</HI> and other <HI>English</HI> Colonies in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>But if this City could have a Communication with the Firth of <HI>Forth,</HI> so as to send their Tobacco and Sugar by Water to <HI>Alloway</HI> below <HI>Stirling,</HI> as they might from thence again to <HI>London, Holland, Ham∣burgh,</HI> and the <HI>Baltick,</HI> they would very probably in a few Years double their Trade.</P>
<P>The Share they have in the Herring Fishery is very considerable; and they cure their Herrings so well, and so much better than they are done in any other Part of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that a <HI>Glasgow</HI> Herring is esteemed as good as a <HI>Dutch</HI> one.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="121"/>I have no room to inlarge upon the Home Trade of this City, which is very considerable in many Things. I shall therefore touch at some few Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Here are two very handsome Sugar-baking Houses, carried on by skilful Persons, with large Stocks, and to a very great Perfection. Here is likewise a large Distillery for distilling Spirits from the Melasses drawn from Sugars, by which they enjoyed a vast Advantage for a Time, by a reserved Article in the Union, freeing them from <HI>English</HI> Duties.</P>
<P N="2">2. Here is a Manufacture of Plaiding, a Stuff cross∣striped with yellow, red, and other Mixtures, for the Plaids or Veils worn by the Women in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Here is a Manufacture of Muslins, which they make so good and fine, that great Quantities of them are sent into <HI>England,</HI> and to the <HI>British</HI> Plantations, where they sell at a good Price. They are generally striped, and are very much used for Aprons by the Ladies, and sometimes in Head-cloaths by the meaner Sort of <HI>Englishwomen.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Here is also a Linen Manufacture; but as that is in common with all Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which im∣prove in it daily, I will not insist upon it as a Pe∣culiar here, tho' they make a very great Quantity of it, and send it to the Plantations as their principal Merchandize: Nor are the <HI>Scots</HI> without a Supply of Goods for sorting their Cargoes to the <HI>English</HI> Co∣lonies, without sending to <HI>England</HI> for them; and it is necessary to mention it here, because it has been objected by some, that the <HI>Scots</HI> could not send a sortable Cargo to <HI>America,</HI> without buying from <HI>England</HI>; which, coming thro' many Hands, and by a long Carriage, must consequently be so dear, that the <HI>English</HI> Merchants can undersell them.</P>
<P>It is very probable indeed, that some Things can∣not be had here so well as from <HI>England,</HI> so as to make out such a sortable Cargo as the <HI>Virginia</HI> Mer∣chants
<PB N="121" REF="122"/>
in <HI>London</HI> ship off, whose Entries at the Cu∣stom-house consist sometimes of two hundred Parti∣culars, as Tin, Turnery, Milanery, Upholstery, Cutlery, and other <HI>Crooked-lane</HI> Wares; in short, somewhat of every Thing, either for Wearing or House-furniture, building Houses or Ships.</P>
<P>But tho' the <HI>Scots</HI> cannot do all this, we may reckon up what they can furnish, which they have not only in sufficient Quantities, but some in greater Perfection than <HI>England</HI> itself.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They have Woollen Manufactures of their own, such as <HI>Stirling</HI> Serges, <HI>Musselburgh</HI> Stuffs, <HI>Aberdeen</HI> Stockens, <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Shalloons, Blankets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Trade with <HI>England</HI> being open, they have now all the <HI>Manchester, Sheffield,</HI> and <HI>Birmingham</HI> Wares, and likewise the Cloths, Kerseys, Half-thicks, Duffels, Stockens, and coarse Manufactures of the North of <HI>England,</HI> brought as cheap or cheaper to them by Horse-packs, as they are carried to <HI>London,</HI> it being at a less Distance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They have Linens of most Kinds, especially Diapers and Table-linen, Damasks, and many other Sorts not known in <HI>England,</HI> and cheaper than there, because made at their own Doors.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. What Linens they want from <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Ham∣burgh,</HI> they import from thence as cheap as the <HI>English</HI> can do, and for Muslins, their own are very acceptable, and cheaper than in <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Gloves they make better and cheaper than in <HI>England</HI>; for they send great Quantities thither.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Another Article, which is very considerable here, is Servants, which they can transport in greater Plen∣ty, and upon better Terms, than the <HI>English,</HI> with∣out the scandalous Art of Kidnapping, Wheedling, Betraying, and the like; for the poor People offer themselves fast enough, and think it their Advantage, as it certainly is, to serve out their Times soberly in the foreign Plantations, and then become diligent
<PB N="122" REF="123"/>
Planters for themselves; which is a much wiser Course than to turn Thieves, and then be trans∣ported to save them from the Gallows. This may be given as a Reason, and, I believe, it is the only one, why so many more of the <HI>Scots</HI> Servants, who go over to <HI>Virginia,</HI> settle and thrive there, than of the <HI>English</HI>; which is so certainly true, that if it holds on for many Years more, <HI>Virginia</HI> may be rather called a <HI>Scots</HI> than an <HI>English</HI> Plantation.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I might mention many other Particulars; but this is sufficient to shew, that the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants are not at a Loss how to make up sortable Cargoes to send to the Plantations; and that if we can outdo them in some things, they are able to outdo us in others. If they are under any Disadvantages in the Trade I am speaking of, it is that they may not, perhaps, have so easy a Vend and Consumption for the Goods they bring back, as the <HI>English</HI> have at <HI>London, Bristol,</HI> or <HI>Liverpool</HI>; for which Reason they have lately set up a Wharf at <HI>Alloway</HI> in the <HI>Forth,</HI> whence they send their Tobacco and Sugars thither by Land-car∣riage, and ship them off from thence for <HI>Holland, Hamburgh,</HI> or <HI>London,</HI> as the Market offers; and in∣deed they carry on a profitable Trade with <HI>England</HI> in Tobacco, which from the Difference of Duty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they do with no small Advantage.</P>
<P>Now, tho' the carrying their Tobacco and Sugars several Miles over Land may be some Disadvantage, yet, if, on the other hand, it be calculated how much sooner the Voyage is made from <HI>Glasgow</HI> to the Capes of <HI>Virginia,</HI> than from <HI>London,</HI> the Difference will be made up in the Frieght, and in the Expence of the Ships, especially in time of War, when the Chanel is thronged with Privateers, and the Ships wait to go in Fleets for fear of Enemies; for the <HI>Glasgow</HI> Ves∣sels are no sooner out of the Firth of <HI>Clyde,</HI> but they stretch away to the North-west, are out of the Road of the Privateers immediately, and are often at the
<PB N="123" REF="124"/>
Capes of <HI>Virginia</HI> before the <HI>London</HI> Ships get clear of the Chanel. Nay, even in times of Peace, there must always be allowed, one time with an∣other, at least fourteen or twenty Days Difference in the Voyage, both going out and coming in, which, taken together, is a Month or six Weeks in the whole Voyage; and considering Wear and Tear, Victuals and Wages, this makes a considerable Difference in the Trade.</P>
<P>One thing still I must take notice of, before I quit <HI>Glasgow.</HI> I have mentioned, more than once, the Duties laid on Ale and Beer sold in divers Towns in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the Benefit and publick Emolument of the said Towns; but have here to take Notice of the like Duty laid for a different Purpose, that is to say, for a Punishment: The Case was this:</P>
<P>When the Malt-Duty was extended for the first time to <HI>Scotland,</HI> it occasioned much murmuring; and particularly <HI>Daniel Campbell,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who lived at <HI>Glasgow,</HI> and was Member for that Town, having given his Vote for it in Parliament, the Po∣pulace rose, enter'd his House, destroy'd all his Goods and Furniture, and committed other Acts of Vio∣lence and Outrage.</P>
<P>This the Legislature resenting as a Defiance of lawful Authority, an Act passed in the 12th of King <HI>George</HI> I. 1725. to take from the Town of <HI>Glasgow</HI> the Benefits of an Act before passed, for laying a Duty of two Penies <HI>Scots</HI> on every Pint of Ale or Beer brewed for Sale in the said City and its Privi∣leges; and vesting it for the Remainder of the Term, which was for thirteen Years to come, (<HI>viz.</HI> from 1725. to 1738.) in his Majesty, to be put under the Commissioners of Excise, in order to raise the Sum of 6080<HI>l.</HI> for satisfying the Damages and Losses sustained by Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> in the said Riot; but it was provided, that when the said Sum was paid, the Duty of Two Penies <HI>Scots</HI> was to return, for the
<PB N="124" REF="125"/>
Remainder of the Term, to the Magistrates, for the Purposes for which they were originally granted. This occasioned no good Blood, it may be believed, between the City and Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>; but yet, this was not the last time this City had the Honour to be represented in Parliament by the same Gentleman, as it is joined with the Burghs of <HI>Renfrew, Ruglen,</HI> and <HI>Dunbarton!</HI>—So placable, and so forgiving, are the generous <HI>Scotish</HI> Nation! or, at least, so little Title has the City of <HI>Glasgow</HI> in particular to the National Motto of <HI>Scotland!</HI>—Nor did this good Behaviour of theirs turn out to its Disadvantage; for in the 9th of <HI>George</HI> II. a new Act passed, continuing the former Act for Twenty-five Years longer, and ex∣tending it to the Villages of <HI>Gorbells,</HI> and <HI>Port Glasgow,</HI> both which Places were in the Jurisdiction of the City, and reaped all their Advantages from its Neighbourhood; the latter especially, at which the People of <HI>Glasgow</HI> had built, and constantly maintained, a very commodious Harbour, and yet were neither of them in the former Act.</P>
<P>From <HI>Glasgow</HI> I went eight Miles Southward to <HI>Hamilton,</HI> a Town pleasant and well-built, the Church of which is the Burying-place of the Noble Family of <HI>Hamilton.</HI> But it is chiefly noted for its fine Palace, the Seat of the Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> premier Peer in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and nearly related to the Royal Family of the <HI>Stuarts.</HI> The House at pre∣sent is large, tho' Part of the Design is yet unfinished. It has a fair Front, with two Wings, and two more are laid out in the Ichnography of the Building, which are not yet begun.</P>
<P>The Front is very magnificent, all of white Free-stone, with regular Ornaments according to the Rules of Art. The Wings are very deep, and when the other two are added, the Sides of the House will be like two large Fronts rather than Wings. The Apartments are very noble, and more fit for
<PB N="125" REF="126"/>
the Court of a Prince, than the House of a Subject. The Pictures, the Furniture, and other Decorations are exquisitely fine, and suitable to the Dignity of the great Possessors. The late Duchess, marrying a Branch of the Family of <HI>Dowglas,</HI> obliged him to take the Name of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and so continue the Estate in her Name. Her Grace had six Sons, four of whom were Peers either by Birth or Creation; <HI>viz.</HI> The late Duke, who was killed in a Duel with Lord <HI>Mohun, Anno</HI> 1712. <HI>Charles,</HI> late Earl of <HI>Selkirk,</HI> so created by King <HI>James</HI> VII. <HI>John,</HI> Earl of <HI>Ruglen</HI>; and <HI>George,</HI> late Earl of <HI>Orkney.</HI> The other two were Lord <HI>Basil,</HI> and Lord <HI>Archibald,</HI> late one of the Lords of the Admiralty.</P>
<P>The Situation of the House has all the Advantage imaginable; for it stands in a plain Country, near enough to the Banks of <HI>Clyde</HI> to enjoy the Prospect of its Stream, and yet far enough from it to be out of the Reach of its Torrents and Floods.</P>
<P>The great Park is about seven Miles in Circum∣ference, and noted for its fine Oaks and Firs, and the small River <HI>Aven</HI> runs thro' it. It is walled round with Stone, and well stock'd with Deer. The lesser Park is rather a great Inclosure, than a Park; tho' this, as well as the other, is extremely well planted with Trees. The Gardens are finely de∣signed, but I can't say they are so well finished and kept, as those at <HI>Drumlanrig.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ruglen</HI> is another Town in this County, which gives Title of Earl to a Branch of the Family of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> as has been said.</P>
<P>Here is also the Town and Castle of <HI>Dowglas,</HI> which gives Title and Surname to the Dukes of <HI>Dowglas:</HI> Of which Family more anon.</P>
<P><HI>Crawford Lindsey,</HI> in this County, gives Title also to the Earl of <HI>Crawford,</HI> who claims Precedency as first Earl.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="127"/>In <HI>Crawford-Moor,</HI> Gold has been found in the Sand of the Brooks after Rain, and that in pretty large Pieces, and they dug up <HI>Lapis Lazuli</HI> there. The Remains of a <HI>Roman</HI> Causeway are to be seen in this County from one End to the other.</P>
<P>We then turned to the Left for <HI>Stirlingshire,</HI> and, after passing the <HI>Clyde,</HI> came to <HI>Kilsyth,</HI> a good plain Country Burgh, tolerably well-built, but not large, near which the Marquis of <HI>Montross</HI> gave a great Overthrow to the Covenanters in the Civil Wars. Here, upon a particular Occasion, we went to see the antient Seat of <HI>Calendar,</HI> which seems now in its Decline. The Town of <HI>Falkirk</HI> is near <HI>Calendar</HI> House, but has nothing remarkable in it, except the other old decayed House of the Earl of <HI>Calendar.</HI></P>
<P>Here we plainly saw the Remains of the antient Work, which they call <HI>Severus</HI>'s Wall, <HI>Adrian</HI>'s Wall, or <HI>Graham</HI>'s Dyke, for it is known by all these; built by the <HI>Romans</HI> cross this narrow Part of the Country, and fortified with Redoubts and Stations to defend the South Country from the In∣cursions of the <HI>Picts, Irish,</HI> and other wild Nations, in the <HI>Highlands.</HI> This Wall reached from <HI>Dunbriton Firth</HI> (so they called the Firth of <HI>Clyde</HI>) to the <HI>Forth,</HI> and was several times repaired, till the De∣struction of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire in <HI>Britain,</HI> with which it perished. Yet neither this, while it stood, nor the stronger one at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> called <HI>Severus</HI>'s Wall, could so well preserve the Country from the Invasion of <HI>Picts</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> but the <HI>Romans</HI> were often obliged to send powerful Succours to the Relief of the distressed <HI>Britons. Camden</HI> thinks, that this Wall was built by <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> who being adopted by <HI>Adrian,</HI> assumed his Name. Be this as it will, 'tis certain, that in all the <HI>Scotish</HI> Histories, it is called <HI>Graham</HI>'s <HI>Dyke.</HI></P>
<P>The Manner of the Wall is best understood by Mr. <HI>Pont</HI>'s Description in Dr. <HI>Gibson</HI>'s (now Lord
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
Bishop of <HI>London</HI>) Translation of <HI>Camden</HI>'s <HI>Britannia,</HI> p. 959. First, there appears a Ditch of 12 Feet wide before the Wall, towards the Enemies Country; the Wall is 10 Feet thick, but it is not known how high it was at first: There is a paved Way at the Foot of the Wall, five Feet broad, Watch-towers within Call of one another, where Centinels kept Watch Day and Night; a Court of Guard to lodge a sufficient Number of Soldiers against all sudden Alarms, and a Void within, for the Soldiers Lodg∣ings. Besides these, there are along the Wall great and noble Forts, strongly intrench'd, and tho' within the Wall, able to receive a whole Army together. The Forts which remained in Mr. <HI>Pont</HI>'s Time, who traced them all, were these; one at <HI>Langtoun,</HI> a Mile East of <HI>Falkirk</HI>; one just at <HI>Rouintree Burn∣head</HI>; one at <HI>Wester-Gowden,</HI> about <HI>St. Helen</HI>'s Chapel; one at the <HI>Croykill</HI>; a very great one at the Top of the <HI>Banhill</HI>; one at <HI>Atchindevy</HI>; one at <HI>Kirkintilloch,</HI> or <HI>Kaerpencolloch</HI>; one at <HI>East-Calder</HI>; one at <HI>Hilltoun-Calder</HI>; one at <HI>Balmudy</HI>; one at <HI>Simerstone,</HI> and over <HI>Kilvin</HI> River, and <HI>Carestoun</HI>; one at <HI>Atermynie</HI>; one at <HI>Balcastle,</HI> over-against <HI>Banhil</HI>; one at <HI>Kaellybe,</HI> over-against <HI>Croy-hill</HI>; one at the <HI>Roch-hill,</HI> over-against the <HI>West-wood</HI>; a large one at <HI>Bankyir,</HI> over-against <HI>Castle-Cairy</HI>; one at <HI>Dumbase:</HI> In the Ruins of that at <HI>Bankyir</HI> was found a large Iron Shovel, or some Instrument resembling it, so weighty that it could hardly be lifted by one Man. At the same Fort also were discover'd several Sepulchres covered with large rough Stones; and at <HI>Dun-Chroe Chyr,</HI> by <HI>Mony-Abroch,</HI> were formerly large Buildings. The Length of the Wall was 36 <HI>Scots</HI> Miles, beginning between <HI>Queen's Ferry</HI> and <HI>Abercorn</HI>; it ranged along West by the <HI>Grange</HI> and <HI>Kineil,</HI> to <HI>Innereving,</HI> so on to <HI>Falkirk</HI>; from whence it proceeded directly to the Forest of <HI>Cumernald</HI>; next, it ran to the great Fort at the <HI>Banhill,</HI> where have
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
been found several Stones, some with Pictures en∣graven upon them, and with Inscriptions. From whence it went to the <HI>Peel</HI> of <HI>Kirkintilloch,</HI> the greatest Fort of all, and so Westward to <HI>Dumbarton,</HI> with a great Ditch upon the North-side of the Wall all along. It had also many square Fortifications in form of <HI>Roman</HI> Camps.</P>
<P>From <HI>Kilsyth</HI> we mounted the Hills, black and frightful as they were, to find the Road over the Moors and Mountains to <HI>Sterling</HI>; and being directed by Guides, we came to the River <HI>Carron.</HI> The Chanel of a River appeared, indeed, and looked as if it had been cut out by Art thro' horrid Precipices, to mark out a Course for the Water; but yet not a Drop was at that time to be seen. Great Stones, square, and formed as if cut out by Hand, of a pro∣digious Size, lay scattered in a confused manner in the very Course of the River, which, as we were told, the Fury of the Water, at other times, had hurried down from the Mountains. If so, they must have been some Ages upon their Jouney down the Stream; for 'tis not probable, that a Flood often comes with a Force sufficient to move such Stones as these, unless a great Quantity of Ice, as well as Water, comes down upon them together. But in all Probability, they are not not driven down by the Force of the Water at all; but are <HI>Roman</HI> Monu∣ments; of which more by-and-by.</P>
<P>Here we passed another Bridge of one Arch, not quite so large as that we saw in <HI>Galloway,</HI> but very like it. 'Tis finely built of Free-stone, but the Shores being flat, it rises so high, that it is not every Head can bear to ride over it. But there was a Necessity of building it with one Arch only; for no Piers in the middle of the Chanel could have borne the Shock of the great Stones, which sometimes come down this Stream.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="130"/>From hence, descending on the North-side, we had a View of the Firth of <HI>Forth</HI> on our Right, and of the Castle of <HI>Stirling</HI> on our Left. In going to the latter, we passed the Water of <HI>Bannockburn,</HI> fa∣mous in the <HI>Scots</HI> History for the great Battle fought here between King <HI>Robert de Bruce,</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> Army commanded by King <HI>Edward</HI> II. in Person, in which the <HI>English</HI> were utterly overthrown, and that with so terrible a Slaughter, that tho' it was the greatest Army that ever marched from <HI>England</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> very few escaped, and the King with much ado saved himself by Flight. How he could save himself by a little Boat, (as Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> says) I can∣not understand, there being no River near, that had any Boats in it, but the <HI>Forth</HI>; and then the King must have fled North, whereas, to be sure, he fled to <HI>England</HI> with all the Speed he could. He might, indeed, have made use of a Boat to pass the <HI>Tweed,</HI> but that was at least 50 Miles from the Field of Battle.</P>
<P>Whether the <HI>Scots</HI> magnify this Victory or not, is not my Business to inquire. 'Tis certain that the <HI>English</HI> Army was totally overthrown here; for they lost 50000 Men, among whom were abundance of their Nobility and Gentry.</P>
<P>This Place is also remarkable for the execrable Murder of King <HI>James</HI> III. whose young Son was by some discontented Nobles worked up to this im∣pious Deed. But when his Understanding ripened, he saw the Action in its proper Light, and was so greatly affected by it, that he did Penance for ever after by constantly wearing an Iron Chain near his Flesh.</P>
<P><HI>Sterling</HI> was our next Stage, an antient Town, and an important Pass, which, together with <HI>Dumbarton,</HI> is the Defence of the Lowlands against the High∣lands; for, as one very knowingly said, <HI>Dumbarton</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
is the Lock of the Highlands, and <HI>Stirling</HI> Castle keeps the Key. The Town is situated, exactly as <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> on the Ridge of a Hill, sloping down on both Sides, and the Street gradually ascending from the East to the Castle, which is at the West-end. It is large and well-built, and tho' it is antient, yet the Buildings are not unlike those of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The Church is also a very spacious Building, but not Collegiate. It stands in the upper Part of the Town, towards the End, is of good Architecture, and adorned with a lofty Tower. There was for∣merly a Church, or rather a Collegiate Chapel, in the Castle, and likewise a private Chapel, or Oratory, in the Palace, for the Royal Family; but they have been long disused.</P>
<P>The Castle is not so very difficult of Access as that at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> but is esteemed equally strong; for the Works are capable to mount more Cannon, and there is a Battery that commands the Bridge, which is of the utmost Importance, and seems to have been the main End and Purpose for which it was built. The Walls, and all the Outworks, are so firm, that they seem in as good Condition, as if they had been lately built.</P>
<P>The Palace and Royal Apartments are very magni∣ficent, but are all in Decay, and likely to continue so. This is at present also the Fate of the Palaces of <HI>Linlithgow, Falkland, Dumfermling,</HI> and all the other Royal Houses in <HI>Scotland, Holy-rood-house</HI> at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> excepted.</P>
<P>In the Park adjoining to the Castle were formerly large Gardens. The Figure of the Walks and Grass-plots is still plainly to be seen.</P>
<P>The Park here is large, and walled about, as most of the Parks in <HI>Scotland</HI> are; but there is little or no Wood in it. The Earls of <HI>Mar,</HI> of the Name of <HI>Ereskin,</HI> who claims to be Hereditary Keeper of the King's Children, and of this Castle, had a House
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
at the upper End of the Town, very finely situated for Prospect, but not for Security, being too near the Castle; for were the Castle ever to suffer a close Siege, and be vigorously defended, it would run a great Risque of being demolished on one Side or other; besides, this Nearness to the Castle makes the Site more confused to the Eye.</P>
<P>From a pretty little Flower-garden upon one of the Bastions on the North-side of the Castle, we had a most agreeable Prospect over the Valley, and of the Meanders, Turnings, or Reaches of the Ri∣ver <HI>Forth,</HI> which are extremely beautiful. They are so spacious, and return so near themselves with so regular and exact a Sweep, that, I believe, the like of it is not to be seen in <HI>Britain,</HI> and perhaps, not in <HI>Europe,</HI> especially in so large a River. The <HI>Seine,</HI> indeed, between <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Roan,</HI> fetches a Sweep something like these, and some Miles longer, but then it is but one; whereas here are three double Reaches, which makes six Returns together, and each of them above three <HI>Scots</HI> Miles in Length: And as the Bows are almost equal for Breadth, as the Reaches are for Length, it makes the Figure complete. It is an ad∣mirable Sight indeed, and continues from a little be∣low the great Bridge at <HI>Stirling</HI> to <HI>Alloway,</HI> the Seat of the Earls of <HI>Mar.</HI> The Form of this Winding may be conceived by the Length of the Way; for it is twenty-four Miles from <HI>Stirling</HI> to <HI>Alloway</HI> by Water, and hardly four Miles by Land.</P>
<P>One would think these large Windings of the Stream would check the Tide very much; but, on the contrary, we found the Tide of Flood make up very strong under <HI>Stirling-bridge,</HI> tho' it does not flow above seven or eight Miles farther; for the Stream grows narrow apace, and the rapid Current of all Rivers in this Country checks the Tide, when it comes into narrow Limits: The same is the Case in the <HI>Tyne</HI> at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and the <HI>Tweed</HI> at <HI>Berwick,</HI>
<PB N="132" REF="133"/>
in both which, tho' the Tide flows as strong in at the Mouth of these Rivers as in this, yet the Navigation goes not near so far up.</P>
<P>The Bridge of <HI>Stirling</HI> has only four Arches; but they are very large, and the Chanel widens consi∣derably below it. At <HI>Alloway</HI> it is above a Mile broad, and deep enough for Ships of any Burden; so that the <HI>Glasgow</HI> Merchants are certainly in the right to settle Warehouses there, and ship off their Goods for the Eastern Countries.</P>
<P>I was very curious to inquire into the Course of this River, as I had been before into that of the <HI>Clyde,</HI> to see if there was a Possibility of uniting their Waters for an Inland Navigation; because I had ob∣served that the Charts and Plans of the Country brought them almost to meet. But when I came to survey the Ground exactly, I found the Map-makers greatly mistaken, and that they had not only given the Situation and Courses of the Rivers wrong, but the Distances also. However, upon the whole, I saw plainly, that notwithstanding several Circum∣stances which might obstruct it, and cause the Work∣men to fetch some winding Turns out of the Way, yet a Canal of about 18 Miles would fairly join the Rivers, and make a clear Navigation from the <HI>Irish</HI> to the <HI>German</HI> Sea; and that this could be done with∣out any considerable Obstruction; for they would not have Occasion for above four Sluices in the whole Way, and those only to head a Bason, or Re∣ceptacle, to contain a Flush of Water, to push on the Vessels either way, as Occasion required.</P>
<P>How easy such a Work would be, and how ad∣vantageous, not to <HI>Scotland</HI> only, but even to <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Thing itself will explain at first Sight. I could enter upon particular Descriptions of the Work, and answer all the Objections raised from the great Quantity of Waters in the Winter, and the
<PB N="133" REF="134"/>
Force and Fury of their Streams; but I have no room for it here.</P>
<P>There is a very considerable Manufacture at <HI>Stir∣ling</HI> for Serges or Shalloons, which they make and dye very well; nor has the <HI>English</HI> Manufacture for Shalloons broke in so much upon them as it was ap∣prehended it would. This Manufacture is a great Support to the poor People that are employed in it, who are thereby enabled to live very comfortably.</P>
<P>The Family of <HI>Ereskine</HI> is very considerable here; for besides the Earls of <HI>Mar</HI> and <HI>Buchan,</HI> there are several Gentlemen of Quality of that Name.</P>
<P>We had here a very fine Prospect both East and West: Eastward we could plainly see the Castle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the Hill, called <HI>Arthur</HI>'s <HI>Seat,</HI> in the Royal Park at <HI>Holy-rood-house</HI>; and Westward we could see <HI>Dumbarton</HI> Castle. To the Northward we saw <HI>Dumblane,</HI> and the Field of Battle, called <HI>Sheriffmuir,</HI> between it and <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>But our Business was not to the North yet; for having a Part of the Border to view, we went from <HI>Stirling</HI> to the South-east, over some of the same Hills we passed at our coming hither, that we might leave nothing behind to oblige us to come this Way again. The Duke of <HI>Argyll</HI> has a small House here, which the Family call the <HI>Lowland House,</HI> to distin∣guish it from the many Seats they are possessed of in the Highlands. This Seat belonged formerly to the Earls of <HI>Stirling.</HI> The County round it, South of the <HI>Forth,</HI> is called <HI>Stirlingshire,</HI> or <HI>Strivelingshire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stirling</HI> was one of the Boundaries of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire in <HI>Britain,</HI> as appears by the Inscription on a Stone below the Castle, towards the Bridge, import∣ing, That one of the Wings of their Army kept Guard there. On the Right of the Town stood the noble Abbey of <HI>Cambuskenneth.</HI> The River <HI>Carron,</HI> which I mentioned before, is famous for some <HI>Roman</HI> Monuments, particularly two little Hills,
<PB N="134" REF="135"/>
called by the Vulgar <HI>Dunipace, i. e.</HI> Hills of Peace, and two Miles lower is a round Edifice of Stone, which, by the Description, resembles what the <HI>Romans</HI> called the <HI>Temple of Terminus.</HI> But <HI>Buchanan</HI> thinks, they were rather Monuments of some great Actions performed here.</P>
<P>From <HI>Stirling</HI> we went directly to <HI>Linlithgow,</HI> a large Town, well built, with a stately Town-house, but most famous for the noble Palace of the Kings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which is the least decayed of all the rest; for King <HI>James</HI> VI. repaired, or rather rebuilt it; and his two Sons Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> and Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> afterwards King of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> had Apartments here, which a Traveller may easily distinguish by the different Coats of Arms, especially over those called the <HI>Prince's Lodgings.</HI></P>
<P>This Palace stands on a rising Ground, which runs into the Lake, in form of an Amphitheatre, and has a Descent resembling Terrace-walks. There are two Towers at each Corner of the Court, with Apartments, and a curious Fountain in the Middle, adorned with several fine Statues, from whence the Water rises to a good Height. A noble Park also belongs to it.</P>
<P>The Church of St. <HI>Michael</HI> makes a Part of this Building, and is a Wing on the Right-hand of the first Court, as the proper Offices make the Left. The Inner-court is very large and elegant for the Taste of the Times. In the Middle of this is the large Fountain I have mentioned, which still shews the Remains of some good Carving, and other Orna∣ments.</P>
<P>Here King <HI>James</HI> V. restored the Order of the Knights of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> as the Order of Knights of the <HI>Bath</HI> lately was in <HI>England,</HI> and erected a Throne and Stalls for them in St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s Church, making
<PB N="135" REF="136"/>
it the Chapel of the Order. He was likewise the first who ordered the <HI>Thistle</HI> to be added to the Badge of the Order, and the Motto, <HI>viz. Nemo me impune lacesset,</HI> which is worn about it in the Royal Arms, was of his Invention. This Prince seems to have been very much honoured in the World; for he wore the Badges of three Orders besides his own; <HI>viz.</HI> That of the <HI>Garter,</HI> conferred upon him by his Uncle, the King of <HI>England</HI>; that of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> by the Emperor, then King of <HI>Spain</HI>; that of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> by the King of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>In his Time the <HI>Green Ribband</HI> was worn by the Knights Companions of this Order; but King <HI>James</HI> VII. changed it to the <HI>Blue,</HI> like that of the Knights of the Garter in <HI>England.</HI> After the Union, Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> the Sovereign of both, to distinguish them, restored the Green Ribband, and intended to have called a Chapter of the Order, to bring it once more to its full Lustre, but was pre∣vented by Death.</P>
<P>In this Town the Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> Lord Regent, was murdered with a Musket-bullet shot by one <HI>Hamilton.</HI> This Earl was a natural Son of King <HI>James</HI> V. and aspiring to the Crown, joined with the Reformers, having first got the Revenues of the Convents of <HI>St. Andrews</HI> and <HI>Pittenweem,</HI> whereof he was Abbot, or Prior, secured to him and his Heirs. His Ambition and Intrigues were the chief Cause of almost all the Troubles of Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign. But I shall have Occasion to mention him in another Place.</P>
<P>At <HI>Linlithgow</HI> is a great Linen Manufacture, as there is at <HI>Glasgow</HI>; and the Water of the Lake here is esteemed so extraordinary for Bleaching or Whitening of Linen Cloth, that a vast deal of it is brought hither from other Parts of the Country for that Purpose. This Lake is situate on the North-side of the Town, and between it and the Palace
<PB N="136" REF="137"/>
are Terrace-walks, which are so beautiful, that a more delightful Place can scarce be seen.</P>
<P>In the Year 1722. An Act passed for laying Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> on every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Ale or Beer sold in <HI>Linlithgow,</HI> and its Liberties, in order to repair the publick Buildings, which were run to Decay, such as the Church and Town-house, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to supply such Parts of the Town with fresh Water, as want it; to pave and amend the Streets, and also the Avenues within a Mile round the Town; for discharging the Town-Debts, and other necessary Purposes. Great Pro∣gress was made in these laudable Undertakings by virtue of this Act; but the End being not sufficiently attained, nor likely to be, at the Expiration of the Act, these Duties were farther continued for 21 Years more, by an Act which passed in the Year 1733. which, it is not doubted, will completely an∣swer all the proposed Ends, to the great Advantage of the Town and Country.</P>
<P><HI>Forfichen,</HI> formerly the Residence of the Knights of <HI>Malta,</HI> is two Miles South-west from <HI>Linlithgow.</HI></P>
<P>Near a Place called <HI>Kips,</HI> South from this Town, is an antient Chapel or Altar of great unpolished Stones, leaning so as to support one another. The Vulgar call them <HI>Arthur's Oven</HI>; but the Learned think them to be a Temple of <HI>Terminus,</HI> built by the <HI>Romans</HI>; and others still there are, who con∣jecture them to be a Temple of the <HI>Celts</HI> or <HI>Druids.</HI> Near this Chapel or Altar is a Circle of great Stones, and on two adjacent Hills are the Remains of old Camps, with great Heaps of Stones, and antient Graves, which some think <HI>Roman</HI> Works.</P>
<P>About four Miles North from <HI>Linlithgow</HI> lies the Castle of <HI>Abercorn,</HI> supposed to be the <HI>Kebercurnig</HI> of <HI>Bede,</HI> where began the <HI>Roman</HI> Wall, thought to be begun by <HI>Severus.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Linlithgow</HI> we turned to the Right, and following the <HI>Clyde</HI> upwards, from a little above
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
<HI>Hamilton,</HI> where we were before, we came into the Shire of <HI>Clydsale.</HI> This Tract has some Remains of <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquity; for from <HI>Errick-stone</HI> to <HI>Mauls Mitre,</HI> which borders upon the Shire of <HI>Renfrew,</HI> are evident Footsteps of a <HI>Roman</HI> Causeway for seve∣ral Miles together; and there is a Tradition, that another <HI>Roman</HI> Street went from <HI>Lanark</HI> to the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Camp near <HI>Falkirk.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lanark</HI> is the Capital of this County, but is no extraordinary Town; its Bridge, however, is very remarkable. It was built at a vast Expence by the Inhabitants: But the violent Current of the Water rendering the keeping it in Repair too chargeable for the Town to support, and making it require fre∣quent Reparations, an Act of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Parliament passed, <HI>Anno</HI> 1703. impowering them to collect Tolls for Pontage, in order to keep up the same. This Act was in Force for 19 Years, and there was so much Reason for it, and the Bridge was of so great Use to the County, that tho' the Duties expired in the Year 1722. yet the Rates were voluntarily paid for many Years; till some Disputes arising with some selfish Persons, who wanted to reap the Fruits of other Peoples Labour for nothing, an Act was passed, in the 10th of King <HI>George</HI> II. for enabling the Ma∣gistrates to repair and maintain so useful a Work. This Act is to continue in Force for 31 Years, and is so reasonable, that it ought, and perhaps will be, perpetuated: For the Rates are only 6<HI>d.</HI> Sterling for every Coach or Chariot drawn by four or more Horses; 2<HI>d.</HI> for every Cart or Wheel-carriage; 1<HI>d.</HI> for every Sledge or Horse loaded or unloaded; Two-thirds of a Peny for every Ox, Cow, or Bull; One-sixth of a Peny for every Calf, Hog, Sheep or Lamb; and the same for every Foot Passenger; who must be a worse Beast than any I have named, to grudge it for so great a Convenience.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="139"/>A little below this Town the River <HI>Dowglas</HI> falls into the <HI>Clyde,</HI> and gives the Name of <HI>Dowglasdale</HI> to the Lands near it. In a dull Vale near this River stands a very old Castle, which has been the paternal Seat of the great Family of <HI>Dowglas</HI> for above a thou∣sand Years, for which Reason it is still kept in Re∣pair: But by the frequent Additions to the Building, it is become such a wild irregular Mass, that, at a Distance, it seems rather like a Town than a single Fabrick; tho' the Apartments are very noble.</P>
<P>The complete History of this Family would take up a Volume by itself, as it actually has in a late Work, where the Heroes of the Name are fully set forth, and all the illustrious Actions they have been concerned in. I shall only observe, that there are no less than Seven Branches of this Family in the Peerage of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> namely, the Duke of <HI>Dowglas,</HI> who is Chief of the Name, the Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> and <HI>Dover,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Morton, Dum∣barton,</HI> and <HI>March,</HI> and the Lords <HI>Mordington</HI> and <HI>Forfar,</HI> the latter of whom was unhappily killed at the Fight near <HI>Dumblaine,</HI> against the Pretender.</P>
<P>The Country abounds with Coals, Peat and Lime∣stone; but what turns to the greatest Profit, are the Lead-mines belonging to the Earl of <HI>Hopton</HI>; not far from which (after Rains) the Country People find Pieces of Gold, some of which are of a con∣siderable Bigness. This is thought to be what <HI>Cam∣den</HI> calls <HI>Crawford-Moor,</HI> where <HI>Lapis Lazuli</HI> is daily dug up with little Trouble, as I have said.</P>
<P>Here we left the last-mentioned wild Place on the Right, and went Westward into the Shire of <HI>Peebles.</HI> The first Town we came to of any Note was <HI>Peebles,</HI> which stands on the Bank of the <HI>Tweed,</HI> and is Capital of the County. The Town is small, and but very indifferently built or inhabited, yet there are some good Houses in it. It was formerly re∣markable for three Churches, three Gates, three
<PB N="139" REF="140"/>
Streets, and three Bridges, of which that over <HI>Tweed</HI> has five Arches.</P>
<P>The Country hereabouts is very hilly; but those Hills are covered with Sheep, which are a principal Part of the Estates of the Gentry. A great Quantity of them are sent into <HI>England,</HI> to the great Damage of the Poor, who are thereby deprived of the Ad∣vantage of manufacturing their Wool. They used formerly to export it to <HI>France</HI>; but by the Act of Union, the Exportation of it was prohibited upon the severest Penalties; and to make the Gentlemen of the Southern Counties amends for this Loss, a great Sum of Money was at that time granted them as an Equivalent, as I have mentioned before, to encourage them to set the Poor to work.</P>
<P>This County of <HI>Tweedale</HI> has two remarkable Lakes in it; the one called <HI>West-water Lake,</HI> abounds so with Eels and other Fish, about <HI>August,</HI> that, during a West Wind, they come out in such Shoals into a small River which runs from the Lake, that, we were told, they are ready to overthrow the People who go in to catch them. The other is <HI>Lochgenen Lake,</HI> upon <HI>Genen-hill,</HI> which falls into <HI>Annandale</HI> from a Precipice of 250 Feet high, that many times Fishes are killed by the Fall of the Water.</P>
<P>The <HI>Frazers</HI> were Ancestors by Marriage to the Family of <HI>Tweedale</HI>; and of this Name was that great Captain, who contributed so much to the Victory which the <HI>Scots</HI> obtained in one Day over three <HI>English</HI> Armies at <HI>Rosbin</HI> 1301. during <HI>Wal∣lace</HI>'s Administration.</P>
<P><HI>Merlin</HI> is said to be buried in the Church-yard of <HI>Drumelzier,</HI> in this County; and according to an old Prophecy, <HI>That the Kingdoms should be united, when</HI> Tweed <HI>and</HI> Pausel <HI>met at his Grave,</HI> they say that it happened so by an Inundation, when King <HI>James</HI> VI. came to the Crown of <HI>England, Anno</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
1603. the only time, before or since, it ever did so.</P>
<P>Some Remains of Antiquity are visible in this County. The Place called <HI>Randal</HI>'s <HI>Trench</HI> seems to have been a <HI>Roman</HI> Camp, and a Causeway leads from it half a Mile together to the Town of <HI>Lyne.</HI></P>
<P>In this County are two very lively Monuments of the Vanity of human Glory. The first is the Foun∣dation of a prodigious Building (more like a Royal Palace, than the Seat of a private Nobleman) begun by the Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> whose Head was no sooner cut off, than his Design perished; for it has never since been carried on.</P>
<P>The other is the Palace of <HI>Traquair,</HI> built and finished by the late Earl of <HI>Traquair,</HI> for some Years Lord High Treasurer of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and a Person in the highest Posts both of Honour and Profit in the Kingdom, who yet lost all by the Fatality of the Times; for growing into universal Dislike by his Conduct under King <HI>Charles</HI> I. he sunk into the most abject Condition of human Life, even to want Bread, and to take Alms, and died in those miserable Cir∣cumstances about a Year before the Restoration. The House is noble, the Design great, and well finished; but the Owner was soon turned out of it by his Enemies, who thought the sparing his Life an Act of great Mercy.</P>
<P>Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI> represents this Earl as a very mean-spirited Man, and one that suffered himself to be made so vile a Tool in other Peoples Mischiefs, that he fell unpitied. 'Tis very remarkable, that he was despised even by the Party which he had served, and but too faithfully adhered to.</P>
<P>Here we saw the Ruins of the once famous Abbey of <HI>Melross,</HI> the Greatness of which may be a little guessed at by the vast Extent of its Remains. One may still distinguish many noble Parts of the Mo∣nastery, particularly the great Church or Chapel, as
<PB N="141" REF="142"/>
large as some Cathedrals, the Choir of which is vi∣sible, and 140 Feet in Length, besides what may have been pulled down at the East-end; and by the Thickness of the Foundations there must have been a large and strong Tower, or Steeple, in the Centre of the Church. There are likewise several Frag∣ments of the House itself; and the Court, and other Buildings are so visible, that 'tis easy to know it was a most magnificent Place in its Day.</P>
<P>Following the Course of the <HI>Tweed,</HI> we passed by abundance of antient Seats of Gentlemen, whose Possessions are large in this Country; such as that of the Family of <HI>Dowglas,</HI> of whom one is called <HI>Dow∣glas</HI> of <HI>Cavers,</HI> who is Hereditary Sheriff of the County; and who shews the Standard of the brave Lord <HI>Dowglas,</HI> who was killed at the Battle of <HI>Ot∣terburn,</HI> falsely, as the <HI>Scots</HI> say, called <HI>Cheviot Chase</HI> (which I have mentioned in <HI>Vol.</HI> III.) just as he had gained the Victory; as also the Mace of Iron he fought with.</P>
<P>The Country, South-east from <HI>Tweedale,</HI> is called <HI>Tiviotdale,</HI> or the Shire of <HI>Roxburgh.</HI> In which are some Footsteps of <HI>Roman</HI> Encampments, and a Military Way runs from <HI>Hounam</HI> to <HI>Tweed,</HI> called <HI>the</HI> Roman <HI>Causeway,</HI> and vulgarly, <HI>the rugged Causeway.</HI></P>
<P>The Town and Castle of <HI>Roxburgh</HI> are both now demolished. They were famous in the History of both Nations, during their mutual Wars, when the Town was frequently taken and retaken, and in the Siege of which King <HI>James</HI> II. of <HI>Scotland</HI> was killed by the bursting of a Gun.</P>
<P><HI>Jedburgh</HI> is a Royal Burgh, on the River <HI>Jed.</HI> It was one of those Towns that suffered in the Re∣bellion in 1715. and being beside in Debt, and its Revenue small to answer its Outgoings; and it being well situated for manufacturing coarse Wool; but greatly suffering for want of fresh Water; and
<PB N="142" REF="143"/>
its publick Buildings, Bridges, Streets, and Works, greatly out of Repair; for these Reasons, and also to enable the Inhabitants to erect Workhouses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the Manufacture aforesaid, an Act passed 1720. imposing a Duty of Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> upon every Pint of <HI>Scots</HI> Ale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be vended within the said Town and its Liberties; and it now reaps the good Effects of it.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Roxburgh</HI> has a very great Estate. His Grace's House, called <HI>Fleurs,</HI> has been finely embellished of late Years, and is a noble Seat; and the Country about it, which was formerly wild and rugged, is now greatly impaired and cultivated, and fine Plantations of Trees and Vista's surround the House,</P>
<P>From hence we came to <HI>Kelso,</HI> a handsome Mar∣ket-town upon the Bank of <HI>Tweed,</HI> which, being so near the <HI>English</HI> Border, and having one of the great Roads from <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to <HI>Newcastle</HI> lying thro' it, which is a nearer Way by far than by that thro' <HI>Berwick,</HI> is a considerable Thorough-fare to <HI>England.</HI> They only want a good Bridge over the <HI>Tweed</HI>; for at present they have only a Ferry just at the Town, and a good Ford thro' the River a little below it.</P>
<P>The Country about <HI>Kelso</HI> is very pleasant and fruitful on both Sides the <HI>Tweed.</HI> The River here does not part <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Scotland</HI>; but you are upon <HI>Scots</HI> Ground for four Miles, or thereabouts, on the South-side of the <HI>Tweed</HI>; and the farther West, the more the <HI>Tweed</HI> lies within the Limits of the Country.</P>
<P>From <HI>Kelso</HI> we went North, where we passed thro' <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> a long Valley on both Sides of the little River <HI>Lauder,</HI> from whence the Family of <HI>Maitland,</HI> first Earls, then Dukes, and now Earls again, took their Title.</P>
<P>The Country is good here, and fenced with Hills on both Sides. The River <HI>Lauder</HI> runs through it, keeping its Course due North.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="144"/>The Town of <HI>Lauder</HI> is a Royal Burgh, the Seat of the Commissariot; and very pleasantly situ∣ated. 'Tis remarkable for the Execution done upon the Minions of King <HI>James</HI> III. who, headed by the Earls of <HI>Angus,</HI> took them out of the Court, and hang'd them over <HI>Lauder-bridge.</HI> The Seat of the noble Family of <HI>Maitland,</HI> Earls of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> is called <HI>Lauderfort:</HI> It is a stately House, about the Middle of the Valley, on the River, but not large.</P>
<P>We kept the great Road over a high Ridge of Mountains, from whence we had a plain View of <HI>Mid-Lothian.</HI> One of these Mountains is called <HI>Soutra-hill,</HI> and belongs to a Branch of the Family of <HI>Maitland,</HI> the elder Brother of which House was a Gentleman of great Merit, and raised himself by his personal Accomplishments to the highest Posts in the Army. At the Battle of <HI>Treves</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> Army, under the Mareschal <HI>de Cre∣qui,</HI> was defeated by the <HI>Germans,</HI> commanded by the old Duke of <HI>Zell,</HI> he had the Misfortune to lose one of his Hands, which he supplied with another of Steel, from whence he was called <HI>Handy Mait∣land.</HI> About the Time of the Union he was Lieu∣tenant-General of the Queen's Armies, Colonel of a Regiment of Foot, and Governor of <HI>Fort-William</HI> and <HI>Inverlochy.</HI></P>
<P>I could not pass this Way to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> without going off a little to the Right, to see two very fine Seats. One of them is an old Abbey belonging to the Marquis of <HI>Lothian,</HI> of the antient Name of <HI>Ker,</HI> a younger Branch of the House of <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> at <HI>Newbottle</HI>; whose Predecessor, <HI>Mark Ker,</HI> being Abbot of it, turned Protestant, and got it settled on him and his Heirs. 'Tis an old Building, but finely situated among the most agreeable Walks and Rows of Trees, all full grown, and contains one of the best chosen Collections of Pictures, Statues, and Busts, in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="145"/>About a Mile from hence is the Duke of <HI>Buc∣cleugh</HI>'s House at <HI>Dalkeith,</HI> without Exception the finest and largest new-built House in <HI>Scotland.</HI> It was built by the late Duchess, Relict of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> on the Ground where the old Castle of <HI>Dalkeith</HI> stood, which was the Estate of the Great Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> Regent of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who was be∣headed under King <HI>James</HI> VI. by an Engine he himself had introduced into this Country, as I have mentioned, at <HI>Halifax,</HI> in <HI>Vol.</HI> III. He suffered for being accessory to, and acquainted with the bar∣barous Design of the Lord <HI>Darnley</HI>'s Murder.</P>
<P>This Palace stands on a rising Ground on the Edge of the River <HI>North-Esk,</HI> from whence it overlooks the Plain, with a Majesty like that of <HI>Windsor</HI> on the Bank of the <HI>Thames,</HI> making some Allowance for the Difference of the two Rivers. The Park is very large, and beautified with Water-works, <HI>Jets d' Eau,</HI> and a Canal, the expensive Work of the late Duchess, and the present Duke.</P>
<P>The Inside of this magnificent Palace is answerable to the Grandeur of the Family, being very richly furnished, and adorned with many fine Paintings, especially of the Ladies of the <HI>English</HI> Court, and some Royal Originals.</P>
<P>Just beyond the Park is <HI>Dalkeith,</HI> a pretty large Market-town, and the more considerable for being so near <HI>Edinburgh</HI>; for great Quantities of Pro∣visions are brought hither from the Southern Countries, which are sold here, and afterwards sent to that City.</P>
<P>I will conclude this Letter with the following Inscription on the Tombstone of one <HI>Margaret Scott,</HI> who died in the Town of <HI>Dalkeith February</HI> 9. 1738.<Q><PB N="145" REF="146"/>

<HEAD>LETTER IV. CONTAINING A Description of the antient <HI>Caledonia,</HI> or Northern Part of <HI>Scotland</HI>; and particu∣larly of the Shires and Towns of <HI>Fife, St. Andrews, Perth, Dumblain, Alloway, Culross, Scone, Angus, Dundee, Mon∣trose, Aberdeen, Buchan, Murray, El∣gin, Inverness,</HI> and the <HI>Highlands,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> AM now to enter the true and real <HI>Caledonia</HI>; for that Part of the Country on the North of the Firth of <HI>Forth</HI> is alone called by that Name, and was antiently known by no other.</P>
<P>I crossed the River at <HI>Queensferry,</HI> seven Miles West of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> into the Shire of <HI>Fife</HI>; and as the most considerable Places in this County are on the Sea-side, or near it, I directed my Journey East along the Coast. The first Place we came to was the Burgh of <HI>Innerkeithin,</HI> an an∣tient walled Town, with a spacious Harbour opening from the East into the River, which has been lately
<PB N="147" REF="148"/>
much neglected for want of Trade. The Town however is large, and still populous.</P>
<P>I can't pass over a tragical Story, which happened in this Town in the Reign of the late Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> The Master of <HI>Burleigh</HI> (so the eldest Son of a Lord or Viscount is called, while the Father is living) fell in Love with a young Woman in his Father's Family, but could not prevail with her either to marry him, or to sacrifice her Virtue to him; which being known, she was sent away, and he persuaded to travel. However, before his Departure, he de∣clared she should be his Wife at his Return; and if any one else should marry her in his Absence, he would murder him. This passed without much Notice, and the young Woman was soon after mar∣ried to a School-master in this Town.</P>
<P>The Gentleman returned, and understanding who was her Husband, went to his House at Noon-day, pull'd out a Pistol, and shot him dead on the Spot, making his Escape unmolested.</P>
<P>But a Proclamation being afterwards issued, with a Reward of 200<HI>l.</HI> for apprehending him, he was at last taken, and tried at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> by the Lords of the Justiciary, and condemned to have his Head cut off. Great Intercession was made to the Queen for his Pardon, which proving ineffectual, he found means to make his Escape out of the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> disguised in his Sister's Cloaths, the Night before he was to have been executed.</P>
<P>After that, he appeared in the late Rebellion, and was in the Battle of <HI>Dumblane,</HI> or <HI>Sheriffmuir,</HI> but escaped again with his Life, tho' his Estate, which was but small, was forfeited among the rest.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Innerkeithin,</HI> a little within the Land, stands the antient Town of <HI>Dumfermling,</HI> which is now in a very ruinous State. For, 1. Here is a decayed Monastery, which before the Reformation was very large, but then demolished, saving a Part, which
<PB N="148" REF="149"/>
was turned into a Parochial Church; and even that is now decayed, and with it the Monuments of se∣veral Kings and Queens of <HI>Scotland</HI>; particularly, that of <HI>Malcolm</HI> III. who founded the Monastery.</P>
<P N="2">2. Here is a decayed Court, or Royal Palace, of the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI>; but by whom built, is uncer∣tain. Almost all King <HI>James</HI> the Sixth's Children were born in it, particularly King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and the Princess <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> afterwards Queen of <HI>Bohemia</HI>; and his Queen made this Place her particular Resi∣dence, and had it settled upon her as her Jointure: Here she built herself an Apartment over the Arch of the great Gate for her particular Retirement, having a Gallery reaching from it to the Royal Lodgings. All is now ruinous.</P>
<P N="3">3. Here is a decayed Town, the natural Conse∣quence of the Decay of the Palace. The Treat∣ment King <HI>Charles</HI> II. met with here, from the Covenanters, was sufficient to make him take a Disgust to the Place.</P>
<P>The Church has still a venerable Face, and at a Di∣stance seems a mighty Pile, the Building being once vastly large. What is left appears too heavy for the present Dimensions. The Church itself is said to be as long as the Cathedral of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> designed by the Model of that at <HI>Glasgow</HI>; but I rather think, that at <HI>Glasgow</HI> was designed by the Model of this at <HI>Dumfermling</HI>; for it seems the most antient.</P>
<P>The People are poor, but would be poorer, if they had not the Manufacture of Linen for their Support, the Diaper and better Sort of Linen-trade being carried on here, and in the neighbouring Towns, with more Hands than ordinary. The Marquis of <HI>Tweedale</HI> has a great Estate in these Parts, and is hereditary Chamberlain or Keeper of the Royal House.</P>
<P>The Rocking Stone, near <HI>Balvaird</HI> in <HI>Fife,</HI> was a remarkable Curiosity. It was broken by <HI>Oliver</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>
<HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Soldiers, and then it was discovered, that its Motion was performed by an egg-shaped Extube∣rance in the Middle of the under Surface of the upper Stone, which was inserted in a Cavity in the Surface of the lower Stone. As the lower Stone was flat, the upper was globular; and not only a just Pro∣portion in the Motion was calculated from the Weight of the Stone, and the Wideness of the Ca∣vity, as well as the oval Figure of the inserted Pro∣minence; but the vast Bulk of the upper Stone ab∣solutely conceal'd the Mechanism of the Motion; and, the better still to impose on the Vulgar, there were two or three surrounding flat Stones, tho' that only in the Middle was concerned in the Feat. By this pretended Miracle they condemn'd of Perjury, or acquitted, as their Interest or Affection led them; and often brought Criminals to confess what could be no other way extorted from them.</P>
<P>From turning East, we saw many Seats of private Gentlemen, and some of Noblemen, particularly one belonging to the Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> at <HI>Aberdour</HI>; which fronts the <HI>Firth</HI> to the South, and the Grounds belonging to it reach down to the Shore.</P>
<P>From this Part of the <HI>Firth,</HI> to the Mouth of <HI>Innerkeithin</HI> Harbour, is a very good Road for Ships, the Water being deep, and the Ground good; but the Western Part, which they call <HI>St. Margaret's Bay,</HI> is a steep Shore and rocky, there being 20 Fathom Water within a Ship's Length of the Rocks. So that if a South-east Wind blows hard, it may be dangerous riding in it: But this Wind blows so seldom, that the Ships often venture it.</P>
<P>He that will view the County of <HI>Fife,</HI> which is wedg'd in by the <HI>Forth</HI> and the <HI>Tay,</HI> and shoots out far into the East, must, as I said before, go round the Coast; and yet there are four or five Places of Note in the Middle of the County, which are su∣perior to all the rest, and must not be omitted: <HI>Kin∣ross,</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="151"/><HI>Lessly, Falkland, Melvil, Balgony,</HI> and <HI>Cow∣par</HI>; the last a Town, the others great Houses, and one, <HI>viz. Falkland,</HI> a Royal Palace, and once the most in Request of all the Royal Houses in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>English</HI> Reader will be surprised to hear of such Numbers of Palaces; but however mean our Thoughts may be of the <HI>Scots</HI> Court in antient Times, their Kings had more fine Palaces than most Princes in <HI>Europe</HI>; for in the Time of King <HI>James</HI> IV. they had all in good Repair and in Use, the several Royal Palaces of <HI>Holy-rood-house,</HI> and the Castle at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the Royal Palace in the Castle at <HI>Sterling, Linlithgow, Dumfermling, Falkland, Scone,</HI> the Castles of <HI>Dumbarton, Blackness,</HI> and <HI>Inverness.</HI></P>
<P>Besides lesser Seats and Hunting-houses, of which King <HI>James</HI> V. had several; and the several Palaces of Earl <HI>Morton</HI> and others, which were forfeited into the King's Hands.</P>
<P>The South Coast of the County of <HI>Fife</HI> abounds with Towns; and the following Thirteen are Royal Burghs, <HI>viz. Innerkeithin, Bruntisland, King∣born, Kirkaldy, Dysart, Pittenweem, Anstruther Wester, Anstruther Easter, Kilrinny, Crail, St. An∣drews,</HI> all on the Coast, <HI>Dumfermling</HI> and <HI>Cowpar</HI> in the midst of the County. And it contains also these other Towns of Note; <HI>viz. Toryburn, Aber∣dour,</HI> the two <HI>Weemys's, Levinsmouth, Ely, St. Monan's,</HI> and <HI>Newburg on the Tay:</HI> And it has in it four Presbyteries; <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Cowpar, St. Andrews, Kirkaldy</HI> and <HI>Dumfermling.</HI></P>
<P>The Shire itself takes its Name from <HI>Fyfus,</HI> sur∣named <HI>Duffus,</HI> to whom it was granted by King <HI>Kenneth</HI> II. for his Valour against the <HI>Picts,</HI> about the Year 840. His Posterity were first called Thanes of <HI>Fife,</HI> and afterwards Earls by <HI>Malcolm</HI> II. about the Year 1057. and endow'd with greater
<PB N="151" REF="152"/>
Privileges than any other Earls of the Kingdom, be∣cause of their extraordinary Services: A famous Monument of which, was that called <HI>Clan Mac∣duff's Cross,</HI> on the publick Road near <HI>Abernethy,</HI> to which if any within the 9th Degree to the great <HI>Macduff,</HI> who was the chief Instrument of subdu∣ing the Tyrant <HI>Macbeth,</HI> should have recourse in case of Manslaughter, he was to be pardon'd on paying a small Number of Cattle. This Monument had an Inscription importing those Privileges, now worn out, and was in such antiquated Terms, mixed with Macaronick, or half <HI>Latin</HI> Words, that few Men now living would have been able to make it out.</P>
<P>From this <HI>Macduff</HI> the Families of <HI>Dowglas, Weemys,</HI> and the Clan <HI>Chattau,</HI> are said to be de∣scended. The Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> is hereditary Sheriff of <HI>Fife.</HI></P>
<P>Having seen <HI>Aberdour,</HI> I took a Turn, at a Friend's Invitation, to <HI>Lessly</HI>; but by the Way stopt at <HI>Kin∣ross,</HI> where we had a View of two Things worth noting. <HI>First,</HI> The famous Lake or Lough, called <HI>Lough Leven,</HI> in an Island of which stands the Castle, where Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> commonly known in <HI>England</HI> by the Name of Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> was con∣fined by the first Reformers, being first compelled to quit her Favourite <HI>Bothwell,</HI> and afterwards her Crown; but from which she found means to make her Escape, tho', as it prov'd, <HI>Out of the Frying-pan into the Fire.</HI></P>
<P>The Lough itself is worth seeing; 'tis very large, being above 10 Miles in Circumference, in some Places deep, and famous for Fish. Formerly it had good Salmon, but now chiefly Trouts, Perch, Pikes, and other small Fry; out of it flows the River <HI>Leven,</HI> which runs from thence to <HI>Lessly.</HI></P>
<P>At the West-end of the Lake, (the Gardens reaching down to the very Water's Edge) stands the most beautiful and regular Piece of Architecture
<PB N="152" REF="153"/>
(for a private Gentleman's Seat) in all <HI>Scotland</HI>; I mean the House of <HI>Kinross,</HI> belonging to Sir <HI>John Hope Bruce,</HI> Bart. The Town, which has a very good Market and a Street tolerably well built, lies at a little Distance from the House, so as not to obtrude upon its Privacy, and yet so as to be ready to wait upon its Call. 'Tis all Beauty; the Stone is white and fine, the Order regular, the Contrivance elegant, the Workmanship exquisite. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Lines, in∣tended for a Compliment on his Friend's Poetry, are here literally true.
<Q><L><HI>Strong</HI> Dorick <HI>Columns form the Base,</HI></L>
<L>Corinthian <HI>fills the upper Space;</HI></L>
<L><HI>So all below is</HI> Strength, <HI>and all above is</HI> Grace.</L></Q></P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Bruce,</HI> the Surveyor-General of the Works, the <HI>Wren</HI> of <HI>North Britain,</HI> was the Founder, as well as Architect, of this House. That Gentleman has left many noble Monuments of his admirable Skill and Taste in those Parts; such as the Palace of <HI>Holy-rood</HI> at <HI>Edinburgh</HI>; the House of <HI>Rothes,</HI> and this at <HI>Kinross,</HI> besides several others.</P>
<P>The Situation of this House of <HI>Kinross</HI> would be disliked by some for its being so very near the Water, insomuch that sometimes, when the Lake is swelled by Winter Rains, and melted Snows, it reaches to the very Gardens; but as the Country round is dry, free from stagnated Boggs, and unhealthy Marshes, this is of very little Inconvenience, if any. Sir <HI>William</HI> planted Numbers of Fir-trees upon the Land round his House, which the present Possessor, Sir <HI>John Hope Bruce,</HI> is as careful to improve as his Grandfather was to plant. Posterity will find the Advantage of this Taste, which, if it spreads as it has begun, will in time make <HI>Scotland</HI> a second <HI>Norway</HI> for Fir; for the Lowlands, as well as the Highlands, will be overspread with Timber.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="154"/>From <HI>Kinross</HI> I came to <HI>Lessly,</HI> where I had a full View of the Palace of the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> built in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. by the said Sir <HI>William Bruce.</HI></P>
<P>Here it was King <HI>James</HI> II. when Duke of <HI>York,</HI> lodged, most part of the Time, when he was obliged by his Brother to retire into <HI>Scotland</HI>; and his Apartments are still called the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Lodgings.</P>
<P>The Magnificence of the Inside of this House is unusually great; but what is very particular, is the long Gallery, which is the full Length of one Side of the Building, and is filled with Paintings, but especially (as that is at <HI>Drumlanrig</HI>) of the great Ancestors of the House of <HI>Rothes,</HI> or <HI>Lessly,</HI> at full Lengths, and in their Robes of Office.</P>
<P>The Rooms of State at <HI>Kinross</HI> are well supply'd with very fine and valuable Pictures, many of which are of Princes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but most, if not all the full Lengths in this Gallery of <HI>Rothes,</HI> are of the Family, and the immediate Ancestors, of the present Earl, most of them having been Peers, and possessed of the greatest Places of Trust in <HI>Scotland,</HI> from the Year 1320. to 1725. so that you may imagine there may well be enough to furnish a Gallery.</P>
<P>Tho' the House is magnificent, I cannot say the Situation of it is so advantageous as that of some other Seats; for it has no excellent Prospect from the grand Town, tho' it stands on the Banks of the <HI>Leven</HI> just where another smaller River joins it.</P>
<P>The Park on the South-side is very beautiful, six Miles in Circumference, walled round and diversified with little Woods of Fir-trees, which have Vistas reaching thro' them up to the House. The Gardens are at the East-end of the House, well designed and planted, extending to the Angle where the two Rivers meet; so that they are watered on the North and East-side, and on the South are parted
<PB N="154" REF="155"/>
with a Wall from the Park, the West-end of them beginning from the House.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Lessly</HI> (seated at a small Distance West from the House, or a little North-west) has a good Market, but is, in no other respect, consider∣able. The House aforesaid is the principal Glory of the Place.</P>
<P>From <HI>Lessly,</HI> we turn'd South to the Coast, and came to <HI>Bruntisland,</HI> situated in the middle of the North-side of the River <HI>Forth,</HI> just opposite to <HI>Leith</HI>; so that we have from hence a fair Prospect as well of the Road of <HI>Leith,</HI> as of the City and Castle of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> Here is a very commodious Harbour, which has no Bar, but enters, as if it had been made by Hand, into the Centre of the Town; so that the Ships lie with their broad Sides to the very Houses; and it is the common Port of Safety to all Ships that happen to be forced up the Firth by Storms or contrary Winds: And Ships trading on this Coast frequently winter here. The Water is commonly 18, and at Spring-tides, 26 Feet deep within the Harbour; so that it is capable of receiving and careening the largest Men of War. The Town is adorned also with a beautiful Church, and has a large Town-house and Gaol. But the Harbour having suffered much by Time, and by Storms; and the Church, Town-house and Gaol, becoming ruinous, an Act passed <HI>Anno</HI> 1719. for laying a Duty of Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> upon every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Beer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> sold within the Town and Liberties, for increasing the Revenues, restoring the Harbour, and repairing the publick Structures above-mentioned.</P>
<P>Here is a Manufacture of Linen, as there is upon all the Coast of <HI>Fife,</HI> and especially for Green-cloth, as it is called, which has been several Years in great Demand in <HI>England</HI> for Printing or Painting, in the room of Calicoes, which are prohibited there.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="156"/>Next to <HI>Bruntisland,</HI> upon the same Coast, is <HI>Kinghorn,</HI> noted for its Thread Manufacture, which the Women chiefly carry on; the Men being gene∣rally Seamen upon all this Coast, as high as the <HI>Queen's-Ferry.</HI></P>
<P>Great Numbers of Porpoises are seen almost con∣stantly in this Firth, which the Men make a Practice of shooting, and then bring on Shore, and boil their Fat into Train Oil, as they do Whales, and several other great Fish, which they sometimes meet with thereabout. But the <HI>Firth</HI> affords a much more re∣gular Fishing-trade lower down; of which in its Place.</P>
<P>The Ferry from <HI>Leith</HI> to the Shore of <HI>Fife,</HI> is fixed in <HI>Kinghorn,</HI> which is of considerable Advantage to it; tho' sometimes the Boats by Stress of Weather, are driven into <HI>Bruntisland.</HI></P>
<P>East of this Town is <HI>Kirkcaldy,</HI> a larger, more populous, and better-built Town than the other, and indeed, than any on this Coast. It consists chiefly of one Street running along the Shore, from East to West, a full Mile, very well built. It has some considerable Merchants in it, in the most extensive Sense of the Word, besides others that deal very largely in Corn, exporting great Quantities of it both to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI> Others again trade in Linen to <HI>England,</HI> who in Return bring back all needful Supplies of foreign Manufactures.</P>
<P>Here are several Coal-pits, not only in the Neigh∣bourhood, but even close to the very Sea, at the West-end of the Town, and where, one would think, the Tide should make it impossible to work them. At the East-end of the Town is a convenient Yard for building and repairing of Ships, and farther on, several Salt-pans for boiling and making Salt.</P>
<P><HI>Dysert</HI> boasts, as I said, of being a Royal Burgh; but notwithstanding it is a very decaying Corpo∣ration; the only Support of it is, that the Lord
<PB N="156" REF="157"/>
<HI>Dysert,</HI> the Landlord, has a good Salt-work here, and in the Lands adjoining an excellent Vein of <HI>Scotch</HI> Coal; both which are easily put on Ship-board at a small Wharf adjoining. This, I think, is the whole Trade of the Town, except what arises from a few Nail-makers and Hard-ware Workers.</P>
<P>I take the Decay of most of these Sea-port Towns, which 'tis evident have made a much better Figure in former Times, to be owing to the removing of the Court and Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> which has been doing ever since the Junction of the Kingdoms under the same Prince in <HI>James</HI> I. and VI. and more completely by the Union. Their Sea-port Towns had, before, a Trade; when their Court was magnificent; when their Nobility built fine Houses, and lived in them. They then exported Goods infinitely more in Value, than what they re∣ceived; and therefore the Balance was evidently on their Side; whereas, now, the Union has open'd a Door to all the <HI>English</HI> Manufactures, and suppressed many of the <HI>Scots</HI>; has prohibited their Wool going abroad, and yet scarcely takes it off at home. If the Cattle are sent to <HI>England,</HI> the Money is too generally spent there likewise. The Troops raised here are in <HI>English</HI> Service, and <HI>Scotland</HI> receives no Premium for the Levies, which she might have done, had they been sent abroad, as the <HI>Swiss</HI> and other Nations do at this time.</P>
<P>But the Benefits that will attend its principal Ports on the Repairs of their Harbour, and publick Struc∣tures, by the many Acts already passed, and every Session of Parliament passing, by the Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> levied for those Purposes, will in time, very probably, turn the Scale in favour of the Union, and increase the Trade of this Part of the United Kingdom, as by virtue of that Act it stands on the same foot of Advan∣tage with <HI>England,</HI> and has so many good Ports, to receive Shipping, and carry on a Commerce with

foreign Parts, as well as Coastwise to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> Of this the Towns of <HI>Glasgow, Dundee, Dumfries, Irvin, Dunbar, Pittenweem, Montrose, Inverness, Elgin, Aberbrothock, Bruntisland, La∣nark, Linlithgow,</HI> &amp;c. will bear Testimony, as I have and shall observe in their proper Places. In∣deed 'tis pity but <HI>Scotland</HI> should find its Account in this respect, in general; for it must be own'd, as I have in part observed before, that it has a plentiful Product for Exportation; and were the Issue of that Product returned and consumed at home, it must necessarily grow rich and flourish.</P>
<P>To take only a short View of the Commodities it exports into foreign Countries, <HI>England</HI> included; for I am now considering <HI>Scotland</HI> as if not united:<LIST>
<ITEM>Carried to <HI>England</HI>; Corn, Black Cattle, Sheep, Wool; Linen of several Sorts; some Woolen Ma∣nufactures, Stockens in particular.</ITEM>
<ITEM>To <HI>Holland, Bremen,</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh</HI>; Corn, Lead, Salt, Coal, barrell'd Pork, and Salmon.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Note, The <HI>Dutch</HI> buy the barrell'd Pork from <HI>Aberdeen</HI> for Victualling their <HI>East-India</HI> Ships, it being much better cured than that from any other Country.</ITEM>
<ITEM>To <HI>Norway,</HI> Salt, Oatmeal, Salmon, Lead, Stockens, and Linen.</ITEM>
<ITEM>To <HI>Sweden, Dantzick,</HI> and <HI>Riga</HI>; Salt, Woolen Manufactures of <HI>Sterling</HI> and <HI>Aberdeen.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>To <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Streights</HI>; Herrings pickled; barrell'd and dry'd Salmon; Herrings, and White-fish.</ITEM>
<ITEM>To <HI>France</HI>; Coal, Salt, Lead, Herrings, White-fish, and Wool.</ITEM>
<ITEM>For all these Exportations the Returns are, or at least were, before the Union;</ITEM>
<ITEM>From <HI>England</HI>; Pewter, Block-tin, Wrought Iron, Glass Ware, Sugars, Tobacco, Drugs and Dyers Stuffs.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="158" REF="159"/>All the <HI>English</HI> Woolen and Silk Manufactures were prohibited upon the severest Penalties; so that the Returns from <HI>England</HI> in Goods were very small; the grand Return from thence was in Specie: And 'tis known, that above an Hundred Thousand Pounds was paid into <HI>Scotland</HI> every Year for Cattle only.</ITEM>
<ITEM>From <HI>Holland</HI>; some fine Linens; but not much, because of their own. Lace, and fine Threads, Gimp, Incle, <HI>&amp;c. East-India</HI> Goods, Linseed, and Lint, or Flax, Linseed-oil, Train-oil, and Whalebone.</ITEM>
<ITEM>From <HI>Norway,</HI> Pitch and Tar, Deals and Firr Timber.</ITEM>
<ITEM>From <HI>Sweden,</HI> Iron in Bars, and Copper, Deals and Timber.</ITEM>
<ITEM>From <HI>Dantzick, Koningsberg, Riga, Narva,</HI> and <HI>Petersburg</HI>; Plank, call'd East Country Clap-board, or Wainscot, Oak Timber, and in Quarters; Hemp, Pitch, Tar, Turpentine, Sturgeon, and Flax.</ITEM>
<ITEM>From <HI>France</HI>; Wine, Brandy, Apples, (Rennets) Resin, Cork, Paper, Wrought Silks, Raw Silks, Toys, Perfumes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>From the Royal Canal thro' <HI>France</HI>; Oil and <HI>Italian</HI> Pickles from <HI>Leghorn.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>From <HI>Hamburgh</HI>; Staves for Casks, Clap-board, <HI>Rhenish</HI> Wine, and Old Hock.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>All these Sorts of Goods are returned into <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> but the Quantities are very small: The chief Articles, to sum up all in a little, are,</P>
<P>From <HI>England,</HI> Sugar and Tobacco; from <HI>France,</HI> Wine and Brandy; from the East Country, Naval Stores; from <HI>Sweden,</HI> Iron and Copper; from <HI>Nor∣way,</HI> Deals and Timber; from <HI>Holland,</HI> Lint and Linseed.</P>
<P>Now these put together, if I am rightly informed, do not balance the Lead, Coal, and Salt, which they export every Year: So that the Balance of Trade must stand greatly to the Credit of the <HI>Scots</HI> Account, which would be all returned into <HI>Scotland</HI> in <HI>Specie</HI>
<PB N="159" REF="160"/>
every Year, if there was not a neighbouring Gulph, into which it is all sunk. And what a Figure would such an Advantage of running Cash be able to make?</P>
<P>I have already touched upon the Advantages, that will probably accrue to <HI>Scotland</HI> by the Method they have fallen upon of augmenting and repairing their Ports and Harbours, by virtue of the Two-penies Tax; and some will further add, to balance the Dis∣advantages they lie under from the Union, that it is now establish'd in a lasting Tranquillity; and an End put to those Wars that used to lay waste the Borders of both Nations; that this will give En∣couragement to the Improvement of the Land, and consequently of raising the Value of Estates; that the Taxes are easy and ascertained; that the Charges of defending the Country both Abroad and at Home lie upon <HI>England</HI>; and the <HI>West-India</HI> Trade abun∣dantly pours in Wealth upon her. And all this is true; but, is it not Pity, for all that, that her own Nobility should not, like true Patriots, lend a helping Hand to the rising Advantage of their own Country, and spend some of the large Sums they get in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> in erecting Manufactures, employing the Poor, and propagating the Trade at Home, which they may see plainly has made their united Neighbours of <HI>England</HI> so much exceed them?</P>
<P>But to return to our Travels: We came next to a Village called the <HI>Wester-Wemys,</HI> belonging to the Earl of <HI>Wemys,</HI> whose House stands a little farther East, on the Top of a high Cliff, with its Front looking down upon the Sea. At the West-end of this Cliff, is a small Plain, once a Bowling-green, where the late Earl, being Admiral, had some small Field-pieces planted to answer Salutes. Behind the House is a small and irregular Court-yard, with two Wings of Building, being Offices to the House on one Side, and Stables on the other. Gardens there are none, only a large well-planted Orchard, be∣tween
<PB N="160" REF="161"/>
which and the House, the Road goes on to <HI>Easter-Wemys.</HI></P>
<P>From thence you come to another Village, called <HI>Buckhaven,</HI> inhabited by Fishermen, who are em∣ploy'd wholly in catching fresh Fish every Day in the <HI>Firth,</HI> and carrying them to <HI>Leith</HI> and <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Markets. The Buildings are but a miserable Row of Cottages; yet there is scarce a poor Man in it; but they are in general so very clownish, that to <HI>be of the College of</HI> Buckhaven, is become a Proverb.</P>
<P>Here we saw the Shore of the Sea covered with Shrimps, like a thin Snow; and as you rode among them, they would rise like a kind of Dust, and hop like Grashoppers, being scared by the Footing of the Horse.</P>
<P>The Fishermen of this Town have a great many Boats of all Sizes, which lie upon the Beach un∣rigged, ready to be fitted out every Year for the Herring Season, in which they have a very great Share.</P>
<P>Beyond this is the <HI>Ely,</HI> a little Town, but a very safe and good Harbour, firmly built of Stone, almost like the <HI>Cobb</HI> at <HI>Lime,</HI> tho' not projecting into the Sea so much as that. It stands a little on the West-side of the Mouth of the <HI>Leven</HI>; the Salmon of which River are esteemed the best in this Part of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>To this Town the Earl of <HI>Wemys</HI> brings his Coal, which he digs about two Miles off, on the Banks of the River <HI>Leven</HI>; as also what little Salt he can make. The Coal-works are greatly prejudiced by the breaking in of the Water, notwithstanding the immense Charges they have been at to prevent that Inconvenience.</P>
<P>The People, who work in the Coal Mines in this Country, partly from their Poverty and hard Labour, and partly from the black Hue which they get from the Coal, make such a frightful Appearance,
<PB N="161" REF="162"/>
that their own Countryman <HI>Drumond</HI> of <HI>Hawthornden,</HI> in his famous Macaronick Poem, called <HI>Polemo-Mid∣dinia,</HI> thus describes them:
<Q><L><HI>Coale-hewers</HI> Nigri, <HI>Girnantes more</HI> Divelli.</L></Q></P>
<P>From hence we have several small Towns on the Coast, as <HI>Criel</HI> or <HI>Crail, Anstruther</HI> or <HI>Anster,</HI> as 'tis usually called, also the Port of <HI>Pittenweem</HI>; these are all Royal Burghs.</P>
<P><HI>Pittenweem</HI> is a Port and Harbour very conve∣niently situated near the Mouth of the <HI>Forth,</HI> in the Shire of <HI>Fife</HI>; and great Quantities of Herring, Cod, and other Fish, are taken here. But it has had two great Difficulties to encounter with; that is to say, the low Situation of the Town, close on the Harbour, by which means the Inhabitants were at a great and constant Expence beyond their Abi∣lity, to maintain a Pier, and other Works, to de∣fend both the Shipping and its People: The other, that the Entrance was very narrow and strait, and several Rocks lay in the Way of the Shipping, which was a great Hindrance to its Trade and Commerce. But in the Year 1719. an Act passed for laying a Duty of Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> upon every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Ale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> sold within the Town and its Liberties, for remedying these Inconveniences.</P>
<P>Over-against this Shore, and in the Mouth of the <HI>Forth,</HI> opposite to the Isle of the <HI>Bass,</HI> lies the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> known to Mariners by a Light-house upon it. The only constant Inhabitant is said to be the Man maintained there by the Government to take care of the Fire in the Light-house. It was famous in former Times for barren Women going to St. <HI>Adrian</HI>'s Shrine there.</P>
<P>Here the <HI>French</HI> Fleet lay with some Assurance, with the <HI>Pretender</HI> on board, in 1708. when the <HI>English</HI> Squadron approaching, the Four o'clock Gun gave the Alarm; upon which they immediately
<PB N="162" REF="163"/>
weighed, got under Sail, and made the best of their Way, the <HI>English</HI> pursuing in vain.</P>
<P>The Shore of the <HI>Firth</HI> or <HI>Frith</HI> ends here, and the <HI>Aestuarium</HI> or Mouth opening, the Land of <HI>Fife</HI> falls off to the North, making a Promontory of Land, which the Seamen call <HI>Fifeness,</HI> looking East on the <HI>German</HI> Ocean, after which the Coast bends away North, and the first Town you come to is <HI>St. Andrew</HI>'s, an antient, and once flourishing City, the Metropolis of all <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Seat of the first University, and before the Revolution an Arch∣bishop's See.</P>
<P>It is remarkable for a fine Situation, surrounded with extensive Corn-fields abounding in excellent Wheat and Barley, and the pleasant Downs, called the <HI>Links,</HI> lying on the Sea-side towards the North. The famous Physician <HI>Cardan</HI> esteemed it the heal∣thiest Town he ever lived in, having Occasion to experience it some Months, when he came over from <HI>Italy,</HI> at the Request of the Pope, to prescribe to Archbishop <HI>John Hamilton,</HI> whom he recovered of a Consumption. And twenty Years before, it had the Approbation of the most eminent Physicians of the Country, when a House was fitted up here for the Reception of <HI>Magdalen,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Francis</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> who married <HI>James</HI> V. King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in 1537. but that Lady died shortly after her Arrival at <HI>Holy-rood-house</HI> in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and never reached <HI>St. Andrews.</HI></P>
<P>The Town of old consisted of four large Streets lying from East to West, almost parallel to one an∣other. The Northermost of the four, called <HI>Swal∣low-street,</HI> tho' formerly the principal, is now totally ruined, not so much as one House remaining. The other three by their Regularity do not seem to have been a fortuitous Concourse of Houses, as most of the other Towns of this Country do; all of them terminating Eastward at the Cathedral, which look
<PB N="163" REF="164"/>
upon each other, and seem to lament their decaying Condition. For tho' the Town was heretofore about two Miles in Circumference, there remain now hardly 1000 Houses; and of those near 200 are become ruinous, and not habitable. The Num∣ber of Inhabitants still amount to above 4000, but many of them have nothing to do; there being neither Trade nor Manufactures in the Place, tho' at the same time it has a Harbour, but capable only of small Vessels. Near the Town is plenty of Free-stone, of which all the Houses are built.</P>
<P>Before the Reformation, this City was crouded both on account of Trade and Religion, Pilgrims coming hither in great Numbers to visit the Relicks of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> said to be brought over by St. <HI>Regu∣lus,</HI> about the End of the fourth Century, from <HI>Pa∣tras</HI> in <HI>Greece,</HI> where that Apostle suffered Martyr∣dom. Here were three religious Houses, a <HI>Fran∣ciscan, Dominican,</HI> and <HI>Augustine</HI> Priory, the last founded by <HI>Robert,</HI> Bishop of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> who died 1139. and was established upon some of the Revenues formerly belonging to the antient <HI>Culdees</HI> of this Place. <HI>James Stewart,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> and Regent of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was, in his younger Days, Prior of it. This Monastery was more like the magnificent Palace of a Prince, than a Convent of Monks professing Poverty, as appears still by its Ruins, and particularly by the Wall that encompassed it of fine hewn Stone, with many Battlements and Turrets.</P>
<P>Here is now only one Parish Church, that of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> remaining; but there are two others, which are rather Chapels, one to <HI>St. Salvator's</HI> Col∣lege; of which, however, no Use is made, it having no Endowment, and the Provost of that College being often a Layman, even in a Presbyterian Sense. The other is the Chapel belonging to <HI>St. Leonard's</HI> College, the Provost whereof must be a Minister.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="165"/>The Church of the <HI>Holy Trinity</HI> is an antient and stately Edifice built with fine Free-stone in form of a Cross, and has at the West-end a handsome Spire in good Repair. In it is a fine Monument of Archbishop <HI>Sharpe,</HI> who was assassinated upon a Moor, as he was coming Home in his Coach: It was erected by the Archbishop's Son, Sir <HI>William Sharpe,</HI> Bart. who to secure it from the Fate he feared it might be liable to, mortified 6000 Merks to the City of <HI>St. Andrews</HI> to keep it in constant Repair; which has had its intended Effect; for the Magistrates are very careful of it, and would be very severe upon any who should attempt to deface it.</P>
<P>On the North-side of the Town was the old Castle, of which now nothing is remaining but the Walls, built by <HI>Roger,</HI> Bishop of <HI>St. Andrews,</HI> who died 1202. being the second Son of <HI>Robert Beaumont,</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> and Chancellor of <HI>Scotland.</HI> It was re∣paired by Cardinal <HI>Bethune,</HI> and Archbp. <HI>Hamilton</HI>; the former of whom procured <HI>George Wishart</HI> to be burnt here in the Parade, while from his Window he glutted his Eyes with so horrid a Spectacle; but was himself afterwards assassinated, 1546. in the same Place; to revenge whose Death, the Queen Regent permitted it to be attacked by the <HI>French,</HI> from whom it suffered greatly. But at the Reformation it suffered more, and its Ruin has been completed since the Revolution.</P>
<P>To the East of the Castle are the Ruins of the stately Cathedral founded by Bishop <HI>Arnold,</HI> who died 1163. and finished by Bishop <HI>Lambertoun,</HI> who died 1328. It was in Length from East to West 370 Feet, and the Cross from South to North 180; its Breadth 65, and its Heighth 100 Feet; tho' some draw another kind of Ichnography, and make it seven Feet longer, and two broader, than <HI>St. Peter's</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI>; and for the Height, as well as the Beauty of its Pillars, and the Symmetry and Proportion of
<PB N="165" REF="166"/>
the Whole, it was one of the best <HI>Gothick</HI> Structures in the World.</P>
<P>It was sometimes called <HI>Kill-ri-mont,</HI> from the Church built by <HI>Hergust</HI> King of the <HI>Picts</HI> in the fourth Century; but the Name of <HI>St. Andrews</HI> has prevailed for many Ages. The Cathedral was near demolished at the Reformation; but was repaired, in some measure, by the succeeding Archbishops; but since the Revolution it has been intirely in Ruins, as we now see it.</P>
<P>Near the Ruins of the Cathedral are still remain∣ing the Walls of the most antient Chapel of <HI>St. Rule,</HI> with the great square Spire still very intire. It is in Height 105 Feet, and made of such large and durable Stones, that tho' it was built so many Ages ago, yet so little has it suffered by the Injuries of the Weather, that a small Sum would save it from falling for many Ages to come: And as this is probably one of the most antient Monuments of Christianity in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> it is Pity it should go to Ruin for want of a suitable Reparation. This besides would be the most proper Chapel and Chapter-house for the noble Knights of the most antient Order of the Thistle, since under the Patronage of the Apostle St. <HI>Andrew</HI> (whose Relicks were preserved at this Place) that Order of Knighthood had its Rise and Foundation; and by King <HI>James</HI> VII's Letters Patents reviving and re∣storing this noble Order, which were dated at <HI>Windsor</HI> the 26th of <HI>May</HI> 1687. it appears the Knights of the <HI>Thistle,</HI> or St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> formerly held their Chapters in the great Church of <HI>St. Andrews</HI>; which being demolished, his said Majesty ordered them for the future, to be kept at the Chapel Royal of <HI>Holy-rood-house.</HI></P>
<P>This City is famous particularly for its University, consisting of three Colleges, founded by <HI>Henry Wardlaw,</HI> Bishop of <HI>St. Andrews,</HI> in the Year 1412. It obtained very ample Privileges and Immunities
<PB N="166" REF="167"/>
from Pope <HI>Benedict</HI> XIII. which were afterwards confirmed to them by King <HI>James</HI> I. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and by several other succeeding Kings. During Episcopacy the Archbishops were Chancellors of it. The Rector is chosen yearly, and by the Statutes ought to be one of the Principals of the three Colleges here, called <HI>St. Salvator's, St. Leonard's,</HI> and the <HI>New College.</HI></P>
<P><HI>St. Salvator's</HI> College was founded by <HI>James Kennedy,</HI> Bishop of <HI>St. Andrews, Anno</HI> 1448. who erected the Edifice, furnished it with costly Orna∣ments, and endowed it with sufficient Revenues for a Doctor, a Batchelor, and Licentiate of Divi∣nity, four Professors of Philosophy, and eight poor Scholars. The Earl of <HI>Cassils</HI> settled a Maintenance for a Professor of Philosophy. It has a good Library founded by Dr. <HI>Sheen.</HI> The Edifice itself is a most stately Pile of fine hewn Stone, has a large vaulted Chapel covered with Free-stone, and over it is a very lofty Spire. The common Hall and Schools are vastly large; and the Cloisters and private Lodg∣ings for Masters and Scholars have been very magni∣ficent and convenient; but the Fabrick is of late become very much out of Repair, nor is the College Revenue able to support it.</P>
<P><HI>St. Leonard's</HI> College was founded by <HI>John Hep∣burne,</HI> Prior of <HI>St. Andrews,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> V. with Salaries for a Principal or Warden, four Professors of Philosophy, and eight poor Scholars. A Professor of Philology was added by Sir <HI>John Scot</HI> of <HI>Scots-tarvet,</HI> with a liberal Salary. He also augmented the Library very considerably; and Sir <HI>John Wedderburn,</HI> at his Death, left a great Col∣lection of Books to it. <HI>Fordun's</HI> MS. of the <HI>Scotish</HI> History is in this Library.</P>
<P>The <HI>New College</HI> was founded by Archbishop <HI>Bethune,</HI> Uncle to the Cardinal of that Name, with Endowments for a Principal and Professor of
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>
Divinity, and some Students in the same Faculty; for no Philosophy is taught in this College.</P>
<P>These last two Colleges, having a better Revenue to support them, than that of <HI>St. Salvator,</HI> are in much better Repair. In the latter, King <HI>Charles</HI> I. held a Parliament, in a large spacious Room able to seat 400 Persons in regular Order, and it still retains the Name of the <HI>Parliament Room.</HI></P>
<P>A Professor of Mathematicks was of late Years added to this University; as was also, not long since, a Professor of Medicine, with a handsome Endowment by his Grace <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Chandos</HI>; whom the University, upon the Death of the Duke of <HI>Athol,</HI> in Gratitude, chose to be their Chancellor; which Office is during Life; and to that alone, and that of his Vice-Chancellor, belongs the conferring of all University Degrees.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>James Gregory,</HI> Professor of Mathematicks in this University, famous for his Knowledge in that Science, has erected in the College Gardens, a com∣modious Observatory, and furnished it with good Mathematical Instruments.</P>
<P>It has produced many learned Men; among others, the famous Lord <HI>Napier,</HI> who invented the Loga∣rithms, Sir <HI>Robert Murray,</HI> Sir <HI>Andrew Balfour,</HI> and the great Lawyer Sir <HI>George Mackenzie.</HI></P>
<P>The Harbour here has suffered so much by the Encroachments of the Sea, that I fear it will never be sufficiently repaired. The Pier is founded upon a Rock of Free-stone, in Length about 440 Feet; but this Rock extends itself into the Sea 500 Feet further, on the Point of which stands a Beacon; and the great Rolling of the Sea, breaking over the Rock, between the Pier-end and this Beacon, makes the Harbour very dangerous. In the Year 1728. it was proposed to be repaired, and the Pier carried as far as the Beacon, and a Brief was granted for that
<PB N="168" REF="169"/>
Purpose. But the Collections were too small to make any great Advances.</P>
<P>By all we have said, it will appear, that this antient City, and its University too, are in a very declining State. The Archbishop's Seat, and Eccle∣siastical Courts kept there, beside the great Resort of Pilgrims to the Convents, brought great Business thither, which being now disused, and one new College erected at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and another at <HI>Aber∣deen,</HI> contribute much to the Decay of both. The City enjoys still some Privileges by the original Charter, yet extant, whereby it was incorporated by King <HI>David, Anno</HI> 1153.</P>
<P>From <HI>St. Andrews</HI> we proceeded on to two very agreeable Seats belonging to the present Earl of <HI>Le∣ven</HI>; one called <HI>Melvil,</HI> and the other <HI>Balgony. Melvil</HI> is a regular and beautiful Building, after the Model of Sir <HI>William Bruce</HI>'s House at <HI>Kinross,</HI> de∣scribed before. <HI>Balgony</HI> is an antient Seat, formerly belonging to the Family of <HI>Lessly</HI>; and if not built, was inlarged and repaired by General <HI>Alexander Lessly,</HI> noted for his Services in <HI>Germany,</HI> under <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden</HI>; and at last, against King <HI>Charles</HI> I.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Leven</HI> runs hard by the Walls of the House, and makes the Situation very pleasant. The Park is large, but not well planted; at least, the Trees do not thrive.</P>
<P>From hence we went North to <HI>Cowpar,</HI> the Shire Town, and turned to the North-east Part of the Country, to see the Ruins of the famous Monastery of <HI>Balmerinoch,</HI> of which Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> takes Notice; but we saw nothing worth our Observation, the very Ruins being almost eaten up by Time. The Mona∣stery was founded by Queen <HI>Ermengred,</HI> Wife of King <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Hence we came to the Bank of another <HI>Firth,</HI> called the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Tay,</HI> which opening to a large
<PB N="169" REF="170"/>
Breadth at its Entrance, as the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> does, draws in afterwards, as that does at the <HI>Queen's-ferry,</HI> and makes a Ferry over at the Breadth of two Miles to the Town of <HI>Dundee</HI>; and then the <HI>Firth</HI> widening again just as that of the <HI>Forth</HI> does also, continues its Breadth from four to six Miles, till it comes almost to <HI>Perth,</HI> as the other does to <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>This River <HI>Tay</HI> is, without Exception, the largest River in <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' not of the longest Course; for it rises out of the Mountains, near the Edge of <HI>Argyllshire</HI>; and running first North into the District of <HI>Braidalbin,</HI> there receiving many other Rivers, spreads itself into a large Lake, called <HI>Lough Tay,</HI> extending near 40 Miles in Length, and traversing the very Heart of <HI>Scotland,</HI> comes into the Sea near this Place: Now, as I design to keep in this Part of my Work to the East Coast of the Country, I must for the present quit the <HI>Tay,</HI> keeping a little on the hither Side of it, and go back to that Part of the Country which lies to the South, and East of <HI>Dum∣barton</HI> or <HI>Lenoxshire</HI>; so drawing an imaginary Line from <HI>Sterling-bridge,</HI> due North, thro' the Heart of the Country, to <HI>Inverness,</HI> which I take to lie almost due North and South.</P>
<P>In this Course I moved from the Ferry mentioned above, to <HI>Perth,</HI> lying upon the same <HI>Tay,</HI> but on the hither Bank. It was formerly called <HI>Johnston,</HI> or <HI>St. John's Town,</HI> from an old Church, dedicated to the Evangelist St. <HI>John,</HI> which is still remaining, and so big as to make two Parochial Churches, and can serve the whole Town for their publick Worship.</P>
<P><HI>Perth</HI> is the second Town of <HI>Scotland</HI> for Dignity. Near it stood antiently the Town of <HI>Berth,</HI> which being overflowed by an Inundation of the <HI>Tay,</HI> oc∣casioned the building of this, where it now stands.</P>
<P>The chief Business of this Town at present is the Linen Manufacture; which is so considerable here, that all the neighbouring Country is employed in it,
<PB N="170" REF="171"/>
and it is the Wealth of the whole Place. The <HI>Tay</HI> is navigable up to the Town for Ships of good Burden; and they ship off here vast Quantities of Linen, for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Salmon taken here, and all over the <HI>Tay,</HI> are extremely good, and the Quantity prodigious. They carry them to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and to all the Towns where they have no Salmon, and barrel up great Quantities for Exportation: The Merchants of this Town have also a considerable Trade to the <HI>Baltick</HI> and <HI>Norway.</HI></P>
<P>This Town was for some time the Seat of the late Rebellion; but by a peculiar Felicity the Townsmen got so much Money by both Parties, that they have ever since been enriched by it, as appears not only from particular Families, but from the publick and private Buildings which they have raised since that time; particularly a new <HI>Tolbooth</HI> or <HI>Town-hall.</HI></P>
<P>It will seem a little strange to us in the South, that any Place should be enriched by a Rebellion; but a few Words will explain it. It must be observed, that the <HI>Pretender</HI> and his Troops having their Quarters hereabouts a considerable time, occasioned a great Consumption of Victuals and Drink, which are so plentiful in these Parts, that 'tis frequent for Towns to petition the Government to have Regi∣ments of Soldiers quarter'd upon them; tho' in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> nothing gives greater Uneasiness.</P>
<P>Again, as the <HI>Pretender</HI> was here and at <HI>Scone,</HI> it occasioned a great Confluence of Persons of Note, who gathered about him, waiting the Issue of his Fortunes, till they found the Storm gathering from the South, and no probable Means to resist it, and then they shifted off as they could.</P>
<P>While they resided here, Lodgings in the Town lett at such a Rate, as was never known before; Provisions were dear, Trade brisk; and had it lasted two or three Months longer, it would have made all the Towns rich in the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="172"/>When this Cloud was dispersed, the Victors enter'd; new Officers succeeded the routed Party. Still the Head Quarters were here; and afterwards the <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops continued here most Part of the Winter. All this while the Money flowed in, and the Town made their Market on both Sides; they were Gainers even by War and Foreigners!</P>
<P>The Linen Trade, which we have mentioned before, has mightily increased since the Act of Par∣liament in <HI>England,</HI> for suppressing the Use of printed Calicoes; in the room of which <HI>Scotch</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Linens have been bought and printed in <HI>England:</HI> So that the Worsted and Silk Weavers in <HI>London</HI> seem to have had very little Benefit by the Act.</P>
<P>At <HI>Ardock</HI> in <HI>Perthshire</HI> are the Remains of a <HI>Roman</HI> Camp; and near <HI>Perth</HI> is a <HI>Roman</HI> Way, where several Medals, sepulchral Urns, and other Monuments of Antiquity, have been found.</P>
<P>From <HI>Perth,</HI> I went South to that Part which they call <HI>Clackmanan,</HI> lying West from <HI>Dumfermling,</HI> and extending itself towards <HI>Sterling</HI> and <HI>Dumblain,</HI> none of which Part I had gone over before.</P>
<P>North-eastward from <HI>Perth</HI> to <HI>Brechen</HI> lies a Vale which they call <HI>Strathmore,</HI> esteemed the most fruit∣ful in Corn of all that Part of the Country: Here are a great many Gentlemens Seats, tho' on the North-side of the <HI>Tay,</HI> particularly the noble Palace of <HI>Glames,</HI> the Hereditary Seat of the Family of <HI>Lyon,</HI> Earls of <HI>Strathmore.</HI> The Heir in Reversion now enjoys the Title and Estate, tho' it very nar∣rowly escaped being forfeited; for the elder Brother entertained here the <HI>Pretender</HI> very magnificently, making up for him and his Retinue fourscore and eight Beds, and afterwards espoused his Cause so strenuously, that he lost his Life in his Service, at the Battle of <HI>Sheriff-muir.</HI> The Estate, being en∣tailed, descended to the second Son, or younger Brother, who is now Earl of <HI>Strathmore.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="173"/>It is one of the finest old-built Palaces in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and by far the largest. When you see it at a Distance, it is so full of Turrets and lofty Buildings, Spires and Towers, some plain, others shining with gilded Tops, that it looks not like a Town, but a City; and the Appearances seen thro' the long Vista's of the Park are so different, that you would not think it the same House any two Ways together.</P>
<P>The great Avenue is a full half Mile, planted on either Side with several Rows of Trees. When you come to the outer Gate, you are surprised with the Beauty and Variety of the Statues and Busts, some of Stone, some of Brass, some gilded, some plain. The Statues in Brass are four, one of King <HI>James</HI> VI. one of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. booted and spurred, as if going to take Horse at the Head of his Army; one of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. habited like that in the <HI>Royal Exchange, London</HI>; and one of King <HI>James</HI> VII. after the Pattern of that which is at <HI>Whitehall.</HI></P>
<P>From hence I came away South-west, and crossing the <HI>Tay</HI> below <HI>Perth,</HI> but above <HI>Dundee,</HI> came at last to <HI>Dumblain,</HI> a Town pleasantly situated, on the Banks of the River <HI>Allan</HI>; but without any sort of Trade. It contains the Ruins of a Church of ex∣cellent Workmanship; but within our own Memory it was made famous by the Battle fought between the Army of King <HI>George</HI> I. under the Command of the Duke of <HI>Argyll,</HI> and the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Forces under the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> on <HI>Sheriff-muir,</HI> between this Place and <HI>Sterling.</HI> We took a full View of the Field of Battle, and could not but reflect with Surprize, that a Rabble of <HI>Highlanders</HI> appearing in Rebellion, armed in Haste, and headed by a Person of no Ex∣perience in War, should come so near to the over∣throwing an Army of regular disciplined Troops, and led on by experienced Officers, and so great a General.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174"/>From hence I proceeded on in Sight of <HI>Sterling-bridge</HI>; but leaving it on the Right-hand, turned away East to <HI>Alloway,</HI> where the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> had a noble Seat, and where the Navigation of the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Forth</HI> begins. This is, as I hinted before, within four Miles of <HI>Sterling</HI> by Land, and scarcely within 24 by Water, occasioned by those uncommon Me∣anders and Reaches in the River, which gives so beautiful a Prospect from the Castle of <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>This fine Seat was formerly called the Castle of <HI>Alloway,</HI> but is now so completely modernized, that no Appearance of a Castle remains.</P>
<P>The Gardens of <HI>Alloway</HI> House are by much the finest in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and not out-done by any in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> consisting of above 40 Acres of Ground; and the adjoining Wood, which is adapted to the House in Avenues and Vistas, above three times as much.</P>
<P>Here is a Harbour where Ships of Burden safely ride. The <HI>Glasgow</HI> Merchants have erected Ware-houses, to which they bring their Tobacco and Sugars by Land, and then ship them for <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Ham∣burgh,</HI> or the <HI>Baltick,</HI> or <HI>England,</HI> as they find the Market.</P>
<P>The High-street of <HI>Alloway</HI> reaches down to this Harbour, and is a very spacious, well-built Street, with Rows of Trees finely planted all the Way. Here are several Testimonies of the Goodness of their Trade, as particularly a large Deal-yard, or Place for laying up all Sorts of <HI>Norway</HI> Goods, which shews that they have a Commerce thither. They have large Ware-houses of naval Stores; such as Pitch, Tar, Hemp, Flax, two sawing Mills for cutting or slitting of Deals; and a Rope-walk, for making all Sorts of Ropes and Cables for rigging and fitting Ships; with several other Things, which con∣vinces us they are no Strangers to other Trades, as well by Sea as Land.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="175"/>East from <HI>Alloway,</HI> is a small County, called <HI>Clackmannanshire,</HI> from the Head Burgh, and is Part of <HI>Fife.</HI> The Country is plain, the Soil fertile; most of it proper for Pasture; and what lies below the <HI>Orchil-hills,</HI> producing Corn very well. But the Shire is chiefly known for yielding the best of Coal, and the greatest Quantity of it, of any Country of <HI>Scotland</HI>; so that it is carried, not only to <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> but also to <HI>England, Holland,</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> But while the Freight from <HI>Scotland</HI> is so dear, and the Tax in <HI>England</HI> so heavy, the Price of these Coals must always be so high at <HI>London,</HI> as will not fail to restrain the Consumption.</P>
<P>On this Shore of the <HI>Firth,</HI> farther down, stands the neat and agreeable Town of <HI>Culross,</HI> lying in Length by the Water-side, like <HI>Kirkaldy,</HI> being likewise a Trading Town, as Trade must be under∣stood in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Here is a pretty Market, a plen∣tiful Country behind it, and the navigable <HI>Firth</HI> before it. The Coal, the Linen Manufacture, and Plenty of Corn, will always keep something of Trade alive upon the whole Coast.</P>
<P>Here is a very noble Seat belonging to the <HI>Bruces,</HI> Earls of <HI>Kincairn,</HI> and is well worth a Traveller's Notice; and indeed these Instances of Magnificence are so frequent in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that were we to dwell upon each of them, such of our Readers as know nothing of <HI>Scotland</HI> would be apt to think we were too partial in its Favour. But it is certain, that no Gentry or Nobility in the World exceeded the <HI>Scots,</HI> while an independent Kingdom, in noble Houses, and all manner of Magnificence; as their Families for Antiquity of Descent hardly have any Equals in any one Country on Earth.</P>
<P><HI>Culross</HI> is a Royal Burgh in the Shire of <HI>Perth,</HI> but in the Confines of <HI>Fife,</HI> famous for a Branch of the Iron Manufacture in making Girdles, <HI>i. e.</HI> broad round Plates, on which they bake their oaten Cakes.
<PB N="175" REF="176"/>
They told me of Mines of Copper, and of Lead, lately discovered in <HI>Fife,</HI> and of Silver also: But I could not learn that any of them were actually wrought. It is, however, not improbable, but that there are such Mines; and particularly the two <HI>Lo∣mons,</HI> which are remarkable Mountains in this Shire, seem to promise Metal in their Bowels, if they were thoroughly searched. They rise up like two Sugar-loaves in the Middle of a plain Country, not far from <HI>Falkland,</HI> and give a View of the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> South, and the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Tay</HI> North, and are seen from <HI>Edinburgh</HI> very plain.</P>
<P>Having made this little Excursion to the South from <HI>Perth,</HI> you may suppose me now returned Northward again; and we proceeded to <HI>Scone,</HI> that antient Seat of Royal Ceremony, where almost all the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> were crowned, since the Con∣quest of the <HI>Picts.</HI></P>
<P>The celebrated Wooden Chair, with the Stone in it, was brought away from hence, as is well known, by the victorious King <HI>Edward</HI> I. and placed in <HI>Westminster-Abbey,</HI> where it now is; but the <HI>Scotish</HI> Royal Blood succeeding to the <HI>English</HI> Crown, in the Person of King <HI>James</HI> I. of <HI>England,</HI> and VI. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> verify'd the following prophetick Distich, tho' at the Time, it was accounted no small Loss and Disgrace to the Kingdom. The Lines were these:
<Q><L><HI>Ni fallat Fatum, Scoti quocunque locatum</HI></L>
<L><HI>Invenient Lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem.</HI></L></Q>
Thus translated by the <HI>Scots:</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Unless old Prophets fail, and Wizards Wit decay,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Where-e'er this Stone is found, the</HI> Scots <HI>shall reign for ay.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>It is said to have been first dignified by K. <HI>Kenneth,</HI> who having fought a bloody Battle here with the <HI>Picts,</HI> in which he gave them a great Overthrow, sat down to rest him upon this Stone, after he had
<PB N="176" REF="177"/>
been tired with the Slaughter of the Enemy; upon which his Nobles came round him to congratulate his Success; and in Honour to his Valour, crowned him with a Garland of Victory; from whence he dedicated the Stone to the Coronation of all the future Kings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> hoping from this Omen, that they should, like him, be victorious over all their Enemies.</P>
<P>But the better Sort of <HI>Scots</HI> Historians say, their Kings brought it from <HI>Ireland</HI> into <HI>I-Colm-Kill</HI> in the Isles, and from thence to <HI>Scone</HI> or <HI>Scoon,</HI> when they had subdued the <HI>Picts.</HI></P>
<P>The Palace of <HI>Scoon,</HI> tho' antient, is not so much decay'd as those I have already spoken of; and the <HI>Pretender</HI> found it very well in Repair for his Use. Here he lived and kept his Court, in all the State and Appearance of a Sovereign; but it was a short-lived Splendor; for in 20 Days he was obliged to quit the Kingdom, by the Advance of the Royal Army. In this Palace is the longest Gallery in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Ceiling painted, but the Painting very old.</P>
<P>The Building is large, the Front being above 200 Feet; it has two extraordinary fine square Courts, besides others, which contain the Offices, Out∣houses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Royal Apartments are spacious and large; but the whole Building is intirely after the antient Manner.</P>
<P>From <HI>Scoon</HI> to <HI>Dunkeld</HI> is so little a Way, that we could not help visiting it, being the Place where a Skirmish was fought between the Forces of King <HI>William,</HI> after the Revolution, and some of the Viscount of <HI>Dundee</HI>'s Men, who pursued the King's Forces, as they were obliged to retire from <HI>Gilli∣cranky,</HI> after Lord <HI>Dundee</HI> himself had been killed there. The Duke of <HI>Athol</HI> has a noble old House here, in one of the Courts of which that Part of the Action happened.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="178"/>Here was formerly a beautiful and magnificent Cathedral Church, dedicated to St. <HI>Columba,</HI> the Seat of a Bishop, whose Chapter or Prebendaries were <HI>Culdees,</HI> or <HI>Black Monks</HI>; but they are now dissolved, and most Part of the Church in Ruins.</P>
<P><HI>Dunkeld</HI> is the chief Market-town of the <HI>High∣lands,</HI> and supposed to have been formerly the chief Town of <HI>Caledonia.</HI> It is situated on the North∣side of the <HI>Tay,</HI> at the Foot of the <HI>Grampian</HI> Hills, and is surrounded with pleasant Woods.</P>
<P>Upon the River <HI>Tay</HI> also lies <HI>Errol,</HI> the Seat of the Earl of that Name, chief of the antient Family of <HI>Hay,</HI> who derive their Origin from a famous Pea∣sant, who in the Reign of <HI>Kenneth</HI> III. being at Plough with his two Sons, and perceiving the <HI>Scots</HI> fleeing before the <HI>Danes,</HI> he and his two Sons stopt their Flight, renew'd the Battle, and gained the Victory; for which they had the Lands of <HI>Errol</HI> bestowed upon them; and the Family Arms is three bloody Shields, supported by two naked Men with Yokes, in Remembrance of this famous Victory; the Father and two Sons having no other Weapons when they put themselves at the Head of the flying <HI>Scots,</HI> but the Yokes they took from their Ploughs. Of this Family are, besides the Earls of <HI>Errol,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Tweedale,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Kinnoul,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But our determined Rout lay up the Eastern Shore, and thro' the Shires adjacent on that Side, as parti∣cularly <HI>Angus, Mearns, Marr, Aberdeen, Buchan,</HI> and so, as I laid it out before, to <HI>Inverness.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> tells us, That the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Tay</HI> was the utmost Boundary of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire in <HI>Britain:</HI> That <HI>Julius Agricola,</HI> the best of Generals, under <HI>Do∣mitian,</HI> the worst of Emperors, tho' he pierced far∣ther, and traversed by Land into the Heart of the <HI>Highlands,</HI> yet seeing no End of a barbarous Coun∣try, and no Advantage by the Conquest of it, with∣drew, and here fixed the <HI>Roman</HI> Eagles; that he
<PB N="178" REF="179"/>
frequently harassed the <HI>Picts</HI> by Excursions and In∣roads, but always returned to his Post here, making the <HI>Tay</HI> his Frontier.</P>
<P>But our <HI>English Caesars</HI> have outgone the <HI>Romans</HI>; for <HI>Edward</HI> I. as is said before, passed the <HI>Tay,</HI> and rifled the Abbey at <HI>Scoon</HI>; and, if we may believe History, penetrated into the remotest Parts, which, however, I take to be only the remotest Parts of what was then known to the <HI>English</HI>; for as to the <HI>Highlands,</HI> the Mountains of <HI>Loquhaber, Ross, Mur∣ray, Sutherland,</HI> and <HI>Caithness,</HI> we read nothing of them: From these Retreats the <HI>Scots</HI> always returned, <HI>Antaeus</HI> like, with double Strength after every De∣feat; till in the next Reign they overthrew his Suc∣cessor <HI>Edward</HI> II. at <HI>Bannockbourn,</HI> and drove the <HI>English</HI> out of the whole Country; following them over <HI>Tweed</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> and ravaging the Coun∣ties of <HI>Northumberland</HI> and <HI>Cumberland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> indeed, (according to the Motto of a noble House in <HI>Scotland, Rode Through</HI>) pene∣trated to the remotest Part of the Island; and that he might even literally rule it with a Rod of Iron, built Citadels and Forts in all the Angles and Ex∣tremes, where he found it needful to place his sta∣tionary Legions, just as the <HI>Romans</HI> did; as at <HI>Leith,</HI> at <HI>St. Andrew's,</HI> at <HI>Inverness, Perth, Aire,</HI> and seve∣ral other Places. We have since seen the Forces of King <HI>George</HI> I. making the same Rout, nay, ferrying over into the Western, and North-western Islands; here again imitating the Prudence of the old <HI>Romans,</HI> who employ'd their Soldiery in mend∣ing Roads, and making Causeways over Mountains, that were before thought inaccessible.</P>
<P>Where Armies have marched, there's Room enough, no doubt, for Travellers. With this Assu∣rance therefore, we chearfully crossed the <HI>Tay.</HI></P>
<P>We left <HI>Strathern,</HI> with the little Country of <HI>Menteith</HI>; for our Return, and went down into
<PB N="179" REF="180"/>
<HI>Angus</HI> to <HI>Dundee,</HI> a pleasant, large, populous City, which as it stands well for Trade, so it has as large a Share of it, as most Towns in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that as well Foreign as Domestick.</P>
<P>It is exceeding populous, full of stately Houses, and large handsome Streets; particularly four very good ones, with a large Market-place in the Middle, the largest and fairest in <HI>Scotland,</HI> except that of <HI>Aberdeen.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants have a very large Correspondence with <HI>England,</HI> and ship off a great deal of Linen thither; and a great Quantity of Corn is sent from hence to <HI>England,</HI> as well as to <HI>Holland.</HI> They have likewise a good Share of the <HI>Norway</HI> Trade; and as they are concerned in the Herring Fishery, they consequently have some East Country Trade, <HI>viz.</HI> to <HI>Dantzick, Koningsberg, Riga,</HI> &amp;c. They send Ships also to <HI>Sweden,</HI> and import Iron, Copper, Tar, Pitch, Deals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from the several trading Ports of that Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Country behind them called the <HI>Carse,</HI> or the <HI>Carse of Gowry,</HI> with the Vale mentioned above of <HI>Strathmore,</HI> abounds in Corn, which the Port of <HI>Dundee</HI> ships off in large Quantities, when a Crop allows it, to the great Advantage of the Gentlemen as well as Farmers; for as the Gentlemen receive all their Rents in Kind, they would find a great Diffi∣culty sometimes to dispose of it, if the Merchants here did not ship it off, either for <HI>London</HI> or <HI>Amsterdam.</HI></P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Dundee</HI> stands at a little Distance from the <HI>Tay</HI>; but they are joined by a Causeway or Walk, well paved with flat Free-stone, such as the Side-ways in <HI>Cheapside</HI> and <HI>Cornhill</HI>; and Rows of Trees are planted on either Side of the Walk, which makes it very agreeable. On one Part of this Walk are very good Warehouses for Merchandizes, espe∣cially for heavy Goods; and also Granaries for Corn
<PB N="180" REF="181"/>
of which sometimes they have a vast Quantity laid up here; and these, being near the Harbour, are con∣venient, as well for the housing of Goods, when landed, as for the easy shipping off what lies for Exportation.</P>
<P>The Harbour of <HI>Dundee</HI> was formerly very good and safe; but of late Years became so ruinous and choaked up with Sand, that it would not contain, as antiently, Ships of Burden, except at the highest Tides; and its Piers were so out of Repair, that Ships could not lie in it with Safety. At the same time the Tolbooth and publick Gaol were so much decay'd, that they were obliged to be pulled down; and the Town, being greatly in Debt besides, could not rebuild the same. Wherefore, to answer all these good Purposes, and to pave the Streets, dis∣charge their Debts, and provide Salaries for School-masters to instruct their Children, an Act passed, <HI>Anno</HI> 1731. for continuing the Duties imposed by a former Act, then near expired, of Two-penies <HI>Scots,</HI> upon every Pint of Ale and Beer sold within the Town and its Privileges, for 25 Years longer. And the Inhabitants now reap the Benefit of it, and will still more, when the proposed Works are abso∣lutely perfected.</P>
<P>This Town was storm'd and plunder'd of great Riches by <HI>Cromwell</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> Army.</P>
<P>The great Church was formerly collegiate, and a very large Building; but part of it was demolished in the Civil War; the Remainder is divided into three Churches for the present Use of the Citizens.</P>
<P>They have also a Meeting-house or two for the Episcopal Worship; for you are to take it once for all, that North of <HI>Tay,</HI> there are far more of the Episcopal Persuasion than are to be found in the South; and the farther North, the more so.</P>
<P>The Tower upon the great Church here is a handsome square Building, large and antient, and
<PB N="181" REF="182"/>
very high, and is a good Ornament to the City: It resembles the great Tower upon the Cathedral of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> but not quite so high. There is a fine and well-endowed Hospital for decay'd Townsmen of <HI>Dundee,</HI> where they are well taken care of, and provided for. The <HI>Pretender</HI> was in this City soon after his Landing, and staid here some time, before he advanced to <HI>Scoon.</HI></P>
<P>It was the Birth-place of <HI>Hector Boetius,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> Historian; a Man famous in his Time, and whose Work was antiently more in Esteem, than of late. It gave the Title of Viscount to <HI>Graham</HI> of <HI>Clavers,</HI> who commanded the Forces that ap∣peared for the late King <HI>James</HI> at the Revolution, and was killed at the Battle of <HI>Gillicranky,</HI> which I have mentioned.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Dundee,</HI> in the Mouth of the River, lies <HI>Brochty-craig,</HI> formerly well-fortify'd, and noted now for a noble Salmon-fishery in its Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>It is 20 <HI>Scots</HI> Miles from <HI>Dundee</HI> to <HI>Montrose,</HI> the Way pleasant, the Country fruitful, and filled with Gentlemens Houses. Among these is the noble Palace of <HI>Panmure,</HI> forfeited in the late Re∣bellion by the unfortunate Earl of that Name, who was wounded in the Fight near <HI>Dumblain.</HI> The Surname of the Family is <HI>Maul</HI>; and <HI>Maulsburgh,</HI> a small Town near <HI>Montrose,</HI> is called from it.</P>
<P>The Town and Port of <HI>Montrose</HI> was our next Stage, standing upon the Eastmost Shore of <HI>Angus,</HI> open to the <HI>German,</HI> or the <HI>Caledonian</HI> Ocean, and at the Mouth of the little River of <HI>Southesk,</HI> which makes the Harbour.</P>
<P>This Town is well situated for Trade, and has a good Harbour, and the Inhabitants always carried on an advantageous Trade with <HI>Norway.</HI> But as it was still capable of great Improvements, were a Dock to be made for the Conveniency of Shipping; and if good fresh Water could be procured for it, of which
<PB N="182" REF="183"/>
it stood in very great Want; and the two Hills that defend the Town against Inundations, having also suffered by Tempests; the Corporation procured an Act, <HI>Anno</HI> 1719. for laying a Duty of Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> upon every Pint of Ale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> sold within the Town and its Privileges, for effecting these good Purposes.</P>
<P>The Town is adorned with fine Buildings, and has an Hospital for the poorer Inhabitants. It gives Title of Duke, as it did formerly of Earl and Mar∣quis, to the Chief of the antient and noble Family of <HI>Graham.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Fleet first made Land at this Port, when they had the <HI>Pretender</HI> on board, in the Reign of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> having over-shot the Mouth of the <HI>Firth</HI> so far, whither they at first designed; but this Mistake, which some thought a Misfortune, was certainly a Deliverance to them; for as on one hand it gave time to the <HI>English</HI> Fleet to come up with them before they could enter the <HI>Firth,</HI> so it left them time and room also to make their Escape; which, if they had gone up the <HI>Firth,</HI> they could never have done, but must inevitably have been burnt and de∣stroyed, or taken by the <HI>British</HI> Fleet under Sir <HI>George Byng,</HI> which was superior to them in Force.</P>
<P>The Royal Burgh of <HI>Aberbrothock</HI> on this Coast, besides being famous for the stately Ruins of the greatest Abbey in <HI>Scotland,</HI> deserves to be mentioned for its convenient Situation for Trade; which in∣duced, some Years since, the Inhabitants to lay the Foundation of a new Harbour, the old one being so decayed, that it was hazardous even for small Ves∣sels to sail into it. But the Work exceeding their Abilities, they procured Contributions towards so good a Design; but still all proving short of what was requisite to complete the Work, and the Town having run itself into Debt by what it had done, and at the same time the publick Streets and
<PB N="183" REF="184"/>
Causeways, as well as the Town-house and Gaol, being in a very ruinous Condition, they procured an Act to pass in the 11th of King <HI>George</HI> II. for laying a Duty of Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> upon every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Ale or Beer sold within the Town and Liberties, which was to commence in <HI>May</HI> 1738. and to con∣tinue for 25 Years, for bringing to Effect these good Purposes. And we may say, that of late so many of these Acts have passed, that <HI>Scotland</HI> will in a few Years, if harassed by no intestine Broils, and continuing in Peace, make a better Figure than it has done for Centuries past.</P>
<P>The Abbey was formerly endowed with great Re∣venues by King <HI>William</HI> I. who was buried here under a stately Monument.</P>
<P>In the inner Parts of the Shire, to the Westward, is <HI>Forfar</HI> the County Town, and <HI>Brechin</HI> formerly a Bishop's See, made so by K. <HI>David,</HI> and where some Part of a small Cathedral is still standing. It is seated upon the River <HI>Southesk,</HI> over which it has a stately Bridge of two Arches, and is considerable for its Salmon and Cattle-markets. It is also memorable for a great Victory obtained here over the <HI>Danes,</HI> by the Chief of the Family of <HI>Keith,</HI> Earl Mareschal, who having killed their General, was advanced to great Honours by <HI>Malcolm</HI> II. There was a high Stone erected over the Grave of the <HI>Danish</HI> General, which is still called <HI>Camus's Cross,</HI> from his Name; and at 10 Miles Distance is another Cross, over the Grave of another eminent <HI>Danish</HI> Warrior; and both of them have antique Letters and Pictures upon them.</P>
<P>From <HI>Montrose</HI> the Shore lies due North to <HI>Aber∣deen:</HI> In the Way is the Castle of <HI>Dunnoter,</HI> once a strong Fortification upon an high Precipice of a Rock. The Castle was surrounded with invincible Walls, (said the honest <HI>Scot,</HI> who shewed us the Road to it) having Towers at proper Distances,
<PB N="184" REF="185"/>
after the old Way of fortifying Towns. The Earl Mareschal, of the Name of <HI>Keith,</HI> was Lord of this Castle, as also of a good House near it, and a great Estate: But what he had, is now gone; for, being in the Rebellion, his Estate was forfeited, and his Lordship, making his Escape, went into the Service of <HI>Spain,</HI> in which he still continues. But we ought to observe, that his Brother, going into the Service of <HI>Russia,</HI> made such a Figure there, that he is a Lieutenant-General in that Empire, and greatly esteemed for his personal Bravery and Conduct. This Gentleman making, lately, a Visit to <HI>England,</HI> was received with great Marks of Distinction and Favour, by the Court and Nobility; and may be truly said to be one of the best Generals that the late Czarina, who yet had many excellent Commanders, had Rea∣son to boast of.</P>
<P><HI>Dunnoter</HI> Castle is now demolished. It is situated in the Shire of <HI>Kincardin</HI> called the <HI>Merns.</HI> The County is noted for its Timber, having in it up∣wards of Five Millions of Fir-trees, besides vast Numbers of other Kinds, planted within these 70 Years by the Gentry, at and about their Seats, and which they are yearly adding to, and improving. <HI>Kincardin</HI> was formerly the County-town; but that Advantage now, by Statute, belongs to <HI>Stonehyne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Innerbervy,</HI> on the Coast, was made a Royal Burgh by King <HI>Alexander</HI> III.</P>
<P><HI>Paldykirk,</HI> so called from <HI>Palladius,</HI> first Bishop of the <HI>Scots,</HI> is noted for its annual three Days Fair: The principal Commodity brought to it is coarse Cloth, which is commonly transported to the <HI>Netherlands.</HI></P>
<P>On the Lands of <HI>Arbuthie</HI> and <HI>Redeloak,</HI> are some Trenches to be seen, cast up by the <HI>Danes</HI> at one of their Invasions: And round the Hill of <HI>Urie</HI> is a deep Ditch, where the <HI>Scots</HI> encamped.</P>
<P><HI>Fordun</HI> lies also in this County, famous in antient Times for the Reliques of the aforesaid St. <HI>Palladius.</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="186"/>
It is also noted for being the Surname of <HI>John For∣dun,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> Historian, Author of the Book called <HI>The Scots Chronicon,</HI> to which all succeeding Histo∣rians of this Nation have been much obliged.</P>
<P>The Earl Mareschal was hereditary Sheriff of this Country.</P>
<P>We proceeded then to <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> a Place so emi∣nent, that it commands some Stay upon it. It stands at the Mouth of two Rivers, and is divided into two Towns or Cities, one called the <HI>New,</HI> the other the <HI>Old Aberdeen,</HI> about a Mile distant from each other; one situate on the River <HI>Don,</HI> the other on the River <HI>Dee,</HI> from whence they are more properly called <HI>Aberdon</HI> and <HI>Aberdeen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aberdon,</HI> or the <HI>Old Town,</HI> lies a Mile Northward from <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> or the <HI>New Town,</HI> and is sometimes called <HI>Bon-accord,</HI> from its Motto. It is situated in the Mouth of the River <HI>Don,</HI> which is remarkable for the Multitude of Salmon and Perch taken in it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Old Town</HI> must, without doubt, be very antient; for they tell us the <HI>New Aberdeen</HI> is supposed to be upwards of 1200 Years old, tho' none of their Registers mention the particular Time of its being built, or by whom. The Cities are not equally situated for Trade, one of the Rivers being broader than the other; and it is the common Opinion, that Part of the old City, called <HI>the Monastery,</HI> was washed down by the Sea, so that it obliged the Citizens to build farther off: That accordingly they built the <HI>New Aberdeen</HI> upon the Bank of the other River, upon a Piece of hilly Ground: But this is all Con∣jecture, and has Probability only for its Support.</P>
<P><HI>Old Aberdeen</HI> was formerly the Bishop's Seat, and has a Cathedral, commonly called <HI>St. Machar</HI>'s, a large and stately Structure, which was antiently much more magnificent: it suffered greatly at the Time of the Reformation, and more since the Re∣volution.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="187"/>The chief Ornament of this Town is the <HI>King's College</HI> on the South Side of it, a neat and stately Structure.</P>
<P>The Church and Steeple are built of hewn Stone, and the Summit of the latter resembles an Imperial Crown. The Windows of the Church were for∣merly esteemed for their Paintings; and something of their Splendor still remains. In the Steeple are two Bells of extraordinary Bigness, besides others.</P>
<P>Close to the Church is a Library well furnished with Books.</P>
<P>This College was founded by Bishop <HI>Elphinston,</HI> in the Year 1500. and the greatest Part built by him; but King <HI>James</HI> IV. taking the Patronage upon him, it was called <HI>The King's College.</HI> The Bull for it was procured from Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> VI. in 1510. endowing it with as ample Privileges as those of <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Bononia.</HI></P>
<P>There are in this College a Principal, a Sub-prin∣cipal, who is also one of the Regents, three other Regents, or Professors of Philosophy, a Professor of Humanity or Philology, a Professor of Divinity, a Doctor of Physick, a Professor of the Oriental Tongues, a Professor of the Civil Law, and a Pro∣fessor of the Mathematicks. Dr. <HI>Frazer</HI> has lately been a great Benefactor to it.</P>
<P><HI>New Aberdeen</HI> is about a Mile distant, as we have said, from the <HI>Old,</HI> situated at the Mouth of the River <HI>Dee.</HI> It is the County Town, and by Con∣sequence the Seat of the Sheriffs Courts. It exceeds all the Cities in the North of <HI>Scotland</HI> for Large∣ness, Extent and Beauty. It stands in a wholsome Air, has a great Revenue from its Salmon-fishery, and the Inhabitants are generally very courteous. It stands upon three Hills; the main Part upon the highest, and the Skirts of it extend into the Plain. The Houses are neatly built, are generally four Stories high, or more, and have for the most part
<PB N="187" REF="188"/>
Gardens and Orchards belonging to them, which makes the City pleasant and healthful, and the Pro∣spect of it beautiful at a Distance.</P>
<P>From a round Hill, at the West End of the City, flow two Springs, one of clear Water, and another with Water, which, in Taste and Quality, comes very near the <HI>Spaw</HI> in <HI>Germany:</HI> Dr. <HI>William Barclay</HI> wrote a Treatise concerning it.</P>
<P>In the High-street is a Church built of Free-stone, and good Architecture.</P>
<P>In this City stands the <HI>Marshal College,</HI> founded by <HI>George</HI> Earl Marshal, in the Year 1593. to which the City has added many Buildings at their own Charge.</P>
<P>In this College, which is a distinct University of itself, are a Principal, four Professors of Philosophy, a Professor of Divinity, and a Professor of Mathe∣maticks, and there is lately added a Professor of Physick. It has a very good Library, which was founded by the City, inlarged by the Gifts of several learned Men, and furnished with Mathematical Instruments.</P>
<P>In this City is also a Grammar School, founded by Dr. <HI>Dune,</HI> having one Master and three Ushers. There is also a Musick School.</P>
<P>The Church called <HI>St. Nicolas</HI>'s, is a handsome Edifice of Free-stone, with a lofty Steeple, re∣sembling a Pyramid; it was formerly divided into three Churches. The Body of this Church is adorned with a Tower, and a Steeple with Pinacles.</P>
<P>Here is also a Prison and a Work-house belonging to the Town, likewise an Alms-house, and three Hospitals; and near the Harbour stands the Custom-house. The Market-place is very beautiful and spacious, and the Streets adjoining are very handsome, and most of the Houses are built of Stone, four Stories high, with handsome Sash-windows, and are very well furnished within; the Citizens here
<PB N="188" REF="189"/>
being as gay, as genteel, and perhaps as rich, as in any City in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Bridge at <HI>Old Aberdeen,</HI> over the <HI>Don,</HI> con∣sists of one immense Arch of Stone, sprung from two Rocks, one on each Side, which serve as a Buttment to the Arch, so that it may be said to have a Foundation coeval with Nature, and which will last as long. The other Bridge is upon the River <HI>Dee,</HI> West above <HI>New Aberdeen,</HI> and has seven very stately Arches.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and indeed of almost all this Country, are generally of the Episcopal Per∣suasion; so that, were it not for the legal Establish∣ment, the Presbyterian Preachers would have but few Hearers, and slender Incomes: Almost every Parish has a Meeting-house, where the Liturgy is read: At <HI>Aberdeen</HI> and <HI>Peterhead</HI> they have beautiful Chapels, and even Organs.</P>
<P>Near the City is a stately Stone Bridge of seven Arches over the <HI>Dee,</HI> built by Bishop <HI>Gawin Dumbar.</HI></P>
<P>The Air of this County, to those who were born in a hotter, seems cold, but is in itself healthful and temperate. The Winter is milder than can be ex∣pected from such a Climate, which seems a Wonder to <HI>Danes, Poles,</HI> and <HI>Prussians,</HI> when they come into this Country, and consider that with them, during the Winter, there is nothing but perpetual Frost and Snow. The Soil in general is not un∣fruitful, if duly cultivated; it produces Wheat, Rye, Barley, Oats in abundance, Pease and Beans; nor do they want Roots and Herbs for Food and Physick; and foreign Plants grow very well there, as daily Experience testifies. The mountainous Part of the County affords very good Pasturage, and the other as good Corn.</P>
<P>The adjoining Sea not only furnishes them with plenty of Fish, but reproaches them with their Negligence, when they see the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleets conti∣nually
<PB N="189" REF="190"/>
fishing on the Coasts, from whence they reap great Gain; but 'tis the Humour of the Inhabitants to apply themselves to the Salmon-fishing, and to neglect that of all other Sorts.</P>
<P>The Quantity of Salmon and Perches, taken in both Rivers, is a kind of Prodigy. The Proprietors are united into a Company, there being so many Shares, of which no Person can enjoy above one at a time. The Profits are very considerable, the Salmon being sent abroad into different Parts of the World, particularly into <HI>England, France,</HI> the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and several other Places.</P>
<P>The Herring-fishing is a common Blessing to all this Shore of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and is like the <HI>Indies</HI> at their Door, were it properly used, by the <HI>Scots</HI> in gene∣ral: But I must observe, that by this, however, the Merchants of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> are able to carry on a Trade to <HI>Dantzick</HI> and <HI>Koningsberg, Riga</HI> and <HI>Narva, Wy∣bourgh</HI> and <HI>Stockholm.</HI></P>
<P>They have also a very good Manufacture of Linen, and likewise of Worsted Stockens, which they send to <HI>England</HI> in great Quantities, and of which they make some so fine, that I have seen them sold for 14, 20, and 30 Shillings a Pair. They also send them over to <HI>Holland,</HI> and into the North and East Seas, in large Quantities.</P>
<P>They have also a particular Export here of Pork, pickled and packed up in Barrels, which they sell chiefly to the <HI>Dutch</HI> for the victualling their <HI>East-In∣dia</HI> Ships and their Men of War, the <HI>Aberdeen</HI> Pork having the Reputation of being the best cured, for keeping on very long Voyages, of any in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>They export also Corn and Meal; but they ge∣nerally bring it from the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Murray,</HI> or <HI>Cro∣marty,</HI> the Corn coming from about <HI>Inverness,</HI> where they have great Quantities.</P>
<P>In a word, the People of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> are universal Merchants, so far as the Trade of the Northern Part
<PB N="190" REF="191"/>
of the World will extend; and it may be esteemed the third City in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that is, the next after <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and <HI>Glasgow.</HI></P>
<P>This Shire contains in it <HI>Mar,</HI> with its Appurte∣nances, <HI>Birse, Glentaner, Glenmuick, Strathdee, Strathdon, Braes</HI> of <HI>Mar</HI> and <HI>Cromar,</HI> most part of <HI>Buchan, Formartin, Garioch,</HI> and <HI>Strathbogy.</HI></P>
<P>The latter is a large and antient Barony, watered by the Rivers <HI>Dovern</HI> and <HI>Bogy</HI>; it was erected into an Earldom by King <HI>James</HI> VI. in favour of the Chief of the noble and antient Family of <HI>Gordon,</HI> whom he afterwards created Marquis of <HI>Huntley. Strathbogy</HI> is very fruitful in Corn and Pasturage, and is remarkable for the fine Linen-yarn spun by the Women there, and sold to the Merchant.</P>
<P>It is mostly inhabited by <HI>Gordons,</HI> Vassals to the Duke of <HI>Gordon,</HI> who has a magnificent Castle here, called <HI>Strathbogy,</HI> from the Name of the County. There are of this Name, besides the Duke, the Earls of <HI>Sutherland, Aboyn, Aberdeen,</HI> and late Viscount of <HI>Kenmure</HI>; likewise a great many Gen∣tlemen of Note in other Parts of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The County of <HI>Mar</HI> gave Title of Earl to the Chief of the Family of <HI>Erskine.</HI> The Sheriffdom is the King's Gift.</P>
<P>In <HI>Aberdeenshire</HI> are Quarries of spotted Marble and Slate, and Pearls are found in their Rivers of a large Size, and fine Colour.</P>
<P>There was formerly a Mint at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> as ap∣pears by several Pieces of Coin with the <HI>Aberdeae</HI> upon them, kept in the Closets of the Curious.</P>
<P>Other Towns in this County are;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Kintore,</HI> a Royal Burgh on the <HI>Don,</HI> which gives the Title of Earl to a Branch of the Family of <HI>Keith.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Inverary,</HI> made a Royal Burgh by King <HI>Robert Bruce.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="191" REF="192"/>3. <HI>Peterhead,</HI> with a good Harbour.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>We ought not to omit, that on the 30th of <HI>October</HI> 1721. an accidental Fire broke out in <HI>Aber∣deen,</HI> whereby the Commissary-Clerk's Office was suddenly consumed, and at the same time the Re∣gisters and Records of all Testaments and Confirma∣tions, all Acts of Curacy, Judicial Deeds, and other Writs and Evidences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were intirely burnt and destroyed; which unhappy Accident being likely to be attended with pernicious Effects to Persons Rights and Properties, an Act passed 8 <HI>George</HI> I. for supply∣ing the Records so burnt or lost; and another in the 9th of the same Reign, for making the former more effectual.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> had suffered much by the publick Commotions in <HI>Scotland,</HI> after the Revolu∣tion took place, so that an Act for laying the Duty of Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> on every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Ale and Beer sold within the Town, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had been imposed by the <HI>Scotish</HI> Parliament in 1695. and continued by the same in 1707. for enabling them to discharge the Debts incurred on that Occasion. And the last Act being near expired, and Debts still remaining unpaid, an Act passed 1731. for continuing the said Duties, for the following good Purposes; <HI>viz.</HI> for paying off the remaining Debts of the Town; for building a new Pier on the North-side of the Harbour, for repairing the old Pier on the South-side, which was very much sunk and decay'd; for repair∣ing the great Church, called the <HI>Old Church,</HI> which was in a very decayed Condition; for rebuilding the Town-house, which was also in a very bad State; and for maintaining and carrying on other publick Works for the Benefit of the Town. This Act is to remain in Force for 25 Years; and it may be easily judged, that the Town of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> will be much improved, when the proposed Works are all absolutely completed.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="193"/>From <HI>Aberdeen</HI> the Coast goes on to a Point of Land, which is the farthest North-east Part of <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI> and is called by the Sailors <HI>Buchanness,</HI> being in the Shire or County of <HI>Buchan,</HI> Part of which belongs to <HI>Aberdeenshire.</HI> It was to this Point the <HI>French</HI> Squadron, with the <HI>Pretender</HI> on board, in the Reign of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> kept their Flight in Sight of the Shore, being thus far pursued by Sir <HI>George Byng</HI> with the <HI>English</HI> Fleet; but from hence they steer'd away North-east as if for the <HI>Norway</HI> Coast, when the <HI>English</HI> Admiral, seeing no Probability of coming up with them, gave over the Chace; but they altered their Course in the Night, stood away South, and came back to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> whence they set out.</P>
<P>On the South-side of the Water of <HI>Eugic</HI> stands <HI>Peterhead,</HI> with a Road which will hold 100 Sail of Ships; and at this Place it is High-water, when the Moon is directly South. In many Places of this Shire are great Stones placed circularly, one of the largest in the Middle towards the South, which have the Air of Places of Worship in the Ages of Hea∣thenism. The dropping Cave of <HI>Slanes</HI> is very re∣markable, of the petrify'd Substance whereof is made excellent Lime.</P>
<P>This Country, however remote, is full of No∣bility and Gentry, and their Seats are seen even unto the extremest Shores: The Family of <HI>Frazer</HI> carries its Name to <HI>Frazerburgh,</HI> in the very Northermost Point of the Country. <HI>Ereskines,</HI> Earls of <HI>Marr,</HI> had their Family-seat at <HI>Kildrummy,</HI> in the County of <HI>Marr,</HI> a little South of this Part of the County, where the late unhappy Earl first set up his Standard for the <HI>Pretender.</HI> The <HI>Hayes,</HI> Earls of <HI>Errol,</HI> are in <HI>Buchan</HI>; and the Family of <HI>Forbes</HI> Lord <HI>Forbes,</HI> and <HI>Forbes</HI> Lord <HI>Pitsligo,</HI> are still farther, and the latter on the very Shore of the <HI>Caledonian</HI> Ocean. The <HI>Gordons</HI> and <HI>Keiths</HI> are very numerous also in these Parts.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194"/>Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> relates, that on the Coast of this Country a great Piece of Amber was driven on Shore by the Force of the Sea, as big (to use his own Words) <HI>As an Horse.</HI> I shall add nothing to the Story, because it is hard to give Credit to it: it is enough that I name my Author; for I could not learn from the Inhabitants, that they ever saw any more of it.</P>
<P>I ought not to omit <HI>Innerury,</HI> belonging to <HI>Garioch</HI> in <HI>Aberdeenshire,</HI> being the <HI>Scotsman</HI>'s Boast; for here <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> tho' sick, and carried in a Horse-litter, defeated <HI>John Cummins,</HI> and those who ad∣hered to him, in Favour of <HI>Edward</HI> I. of <HI>England</HI>; who held <HI>Scotland</HI> in Subjection. This was the first Victory King <HI>Robert</HI> obtained, and laid the Foun∣dation of the Overthrow of the <HI>English</HI> Usurpation in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Near the same Place also in 1411. <HI>Alexander Steuart,</HI> Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> defeated <HI>Donald</HI> of the Isles, in the bloody Battle of the <HI>Harlow.</HI></P>
<P>From hence, the East Shore of <HI>Scotland</HI> being at an End, the Land tends away due West; and the Shire of <HI>Bamff</HI> beginning, you see the Towns of <HI>Bamff, Elgin, Frazersburg,</HI> and the famous Mona∣stery of <HI>Kinloss,</HI> where the murdered Body of King <HI>Duff</HI> was after many Years dug up, and discovered to be his by various Tokens.</P>
<P>The Shire of <HI>Bamff</HI> deserves some Notice for the following Particulars; for that in it is situated <HI>Strathyla,</HI> which drives a great Trade in Lime, and fat Cattle; and it abounds so with Lime-stone, that they build their Houses with it. They carry on a Trade in fine Linen also, by means of their weekly Markets at <HI>Keith,</HI> a neighbouring Village. Upon the Banks of the <HI>Spey,</HI> which runs thro' this County, lies the <HI>Bog of Gicht,</HI> now called <HI>Gordon Castle,</HI> the noblest Palace in the North, being the Duke of <HI>Gordon</HI>'s chief Seat, adorned with pleasant Gardens, and a great Park. The Castle appears so large, that
<PB N="194" REF="195"/>
it looks more like a Town than a Nobleman's Seat. The Duke is Proprietor of this Part of the County. <HI>Strathave</HI> is the paternal Inheritance of his Fa∣mily: And his Grace has a fine Estate, and other Seats hereabouts. The late Duke had a little embroiled himself with the Affairs of 1715, and his Son, then Marquis of <HI>Huntley,</HI> still more; but got off without a Forfeiture, by his Prudence and good Fortune.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Cullen,</HI> an antient Royal Burgh, stands in the Shire of <HI>Bamff.</HI> It is chiefly noted for its fruitful Soil, and Salmon-fishing; for having no Port, it has little Trade, except for its Corn and Salmon.</P>
<P>The Shire itself takes Name from <HI>Bamff,</HI> a Burgh Royal, seated at the Mouth of <HI>Doverne</HI> in the <HI>Boyne,</HI> where the Sheriff holds his Courts. In it are the Ruins of an old Castle, near which is the Abbey of <HI>Deer,</HI> formerly belonging to the <HI>Cistercian</HI> Monks, and founded by <HI>William Cumin,</HI> Earl of <HI>Buchan.</HI> In <HI>Belvenie</HI> is found the Stone of which Alum is made, and in the County of <HI>Boyne</HI> great Quarries of spotted Marble have been discovered.</P>
<P><HI>Buchan</HI> is Part in <HI>Aberdeenshire,</HI> Part in the Shire of <HI>Bamff,</HI> one of its principal Towns is <HI>Frazersburgh,</HI> and <HI>Peterhead</HI> is another. The latter is a good Market-town, with a Port, and small Harbour with two little Piers for Fishing; but being so near <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> has not those Helps and Advantages, that might be otherwise probably given to it; so that at low Water it is all dry, and the smallest Ships lie aground in it.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Saltoun</HI> has very lately built, (1738) at <HI>Frazersburgh,</HI> a most excellent new Pier and Bulwark, all of Free-stone; which renders that Harbour as safe and commodious as any on the East Coast; so that 30 Ships may winter there at once, with great Safety: The Water at full Sea is 18 or 20 Feet.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="196"/>From the Point of Land, called <HI>Buchanness</HI> the Ships begin their Accounts for their several Voyages; what they call their Departure: As in <HI>England,</HI> they do from <HI>Wintertonness,</HI> on the North-east Part of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and from the <HI>Downs</HI> for the Voy∣ages to the Southward.</P>
<P>From <HI>Fifeness,</HI> which is the Northermost Point, on the Mouth of <HI>Edinburgh Firth,</HI> being the Souther∣most Land of <HI>Fife</HI> to this Point of <HI>Buchanness,</HI> the Land lies almost due North and South, and the Shore is the Eastermost Land of <HI>Scotland.</HI> The Distance between them is 33 Leagues, 1 Mile, which is just 100 Miles; tho' the Mariners say, that measuring by the Sea, it is but 28; and from <HI>Wintertonness,</HI> near <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> to this Point call'd <HI>Buchanness,</HI> is just 300 Miles.</P>
<P>The River or <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Tay</HI> opens into the Sea, about four Leagues North from <HI>Fifeness</HI>; and as there is a Light-house on the <HI>Isle of May,</HI> as I have said before, in the Mouth of the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Forth</HI> at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> a little South of this Point, call'd <HI>Fife∣ness</HI>; there are likewise two Light-houses at the Entrance of the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Tay,</HI> for the Directions of the Sailors, when they are bound into that River, and particularly for their avoiding the two Sands, which lie off from the South-side of the Entrance.</P>
<P><HI>Buchanness</HI> is generally also the first Land of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which the Ships make in their Voyages Home from <HI>Archangel</HI> in <HI>Russia,</HI> or from their Whale-fishing Voyages to <HI>Greenland</HI> and <HI>Spits-bergen</HI> in the North Seas: And near this Point, at <HI>Pitsligo,</HI> a great Ship was cast away in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, bound Home from <HI>Archangel,</HI> having on board the first Embassador sent by the Great Duke of <HI>Muscovy</HI> to any of the Christian Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> he being commissioned to treat with Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> for a League of Peace and Commerce. He likewise lost a most valuable Present, designed for the Queen, of
<PB N="196" REF="197"/>
rich and costly Furrs, in those Days, reputed in∣estimable. The Embassador was happily saved, and brought on Shore by the People of <HI>Pitsligo</HI>; but the Ship and all the Goods were lost.</P>
<P>From this Point of Easterly Land all that great Bay, or Inlet of the Sea, reaching quite to the North of <HI>Scotland,</HI> is called <HI>Murray Firth,</HI> and the Northermost Point is <HI>Dungsby-head,</HI> which is the North-east Point of <HI>Caithness,</HI> and opens to <HI>Pentland Firth.</HI> By <HI>Pentland Firth</HI> you are to understand the Passage of the Sea beyond <HI>Caithness,</HI> between <HI>Scot∣land</HI> and the Isles of <HI>Orkney.</HI> What is call'd <HI>Murray Firth,</HI> is not, like many others, the Mouth of a River, as that of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> or <HI>Tay,</HI> but is an open Bay in the Sea, as the Bay of <HI>Biscay,</HI> or the Gulph of <HI>Mexico</HI> are; and reaches, as I have said, from <HI>Peters-head,</HI> to <HI>Dungsby-head,</HI> opposite to the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> the Distance of 79 Miles; but it is almost twice as far by Land, because of the Depth of that Bay, which obliges us to travel from <HI>Pitsligo</HI> West, near 70 Miles, till we come to <HI>Inverness.</HI></P>
<P>This County of <HI>Buchan</HI> is more to be taken Notice of from what is to be seen on the Sea Shore than in the Land; for the Country is moun∣tainous, and in some Places not very fertile; but as we coasted along West, we came into a much better Country, particularly the Shires of <HI>Bamff,</HI> which I have already mention'd, <HI>Elgin,</HI> and the County of <HI>Murray,</HI> from whence the Bay I just now described, is called <HI>Murray Firth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Murray</HI> is a pleasant Country, the Soil fruitful, water'd with fine Rivers, and full of good Towns, and Gentlemens Seats more than could be expected in so remote a Part of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>This Country is a Plain for between 20 and 30 Miles together, and the Soil is by that means render'd more fruitful and rich, and the Tempera∣ture of the Air more soften'd, than in other Parts of
<PB N="197" REF="198"/>
<HI>Scotland</HI>; insomuch that the Harvest here, and in the Vale of <HI>Strathbogy,</HI> and all the Country to <HI>Inver∣ness,</HI> is observed to be more early than in <HI>Northum∣berland,</HI> nay, than in <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> and even some Parts of the more Southerly Counties in <HI>England</HI>; as particularly in the East of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Sussex.</HI> As a Confirmation of this, I affirm that I have seen the new Wheat of this Country and <HI>Inverness</HI> brought to Market to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> before the Wheat at <HI>Edin∣burgh</HI> has been fit to reap; and yet the Harvest about <HI>Edinburgh</HI> is thought to be as forward as in most Parts, even of <HI>England</HI> itself. In a Word, it is usual in <HI>Murray</HI> and the Country about it, to begin with their Harvest in the Month of <HI>July,</HI> and it is not very unusual to have new Corn fully ripe and thresh'd out, shipped off, and brought to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to Sale, within the Month of <HI>August.</HI></P>
<P>The River <HI>Lossie</HI> in this County is famous for Sal∣mon; there being annually pickled and exported from 80 to 100 Lasts, all taken in a few Months of the Sum∣mer, and in a Space of one Mile, at a Village called <HI>Germach.</HI> It abounds with Fish to the very Head; but still the greatest Quantity is used for home Con∣sumption, and taken either with hooked Tridents by Day, or Wicker Baskets, or little Boats covered with Hides, by Night. None but the Natives, who are used to them, will venture into those Boats. The common Drink in these Parts is Ale, and sometimes Beer, and they have good <HI>French</HI> Wine very cheap, as I and my Company experienced; but the Inha∣bitants prefer <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> of their own extracting from Ale-dregs and Spices, to much richer Wines than the <HI>French</HI>; of this they drink plentifully themselves, and are very liberal of it to their Friends. And a Bottle of this Liquor, and some Cheese, will make a <HI>Murray</HI> Man undertake the greatest Winter-Journeys, without wishing for any other Provision.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="199"/>This County is divided into two Shires; the greater, called the Shire of <HI>Elgin</HI>; the other, the Shire of <HI>Nairn.</HI> The Town of <HI>Nairn</HI> lies on the Mouth of the River of that Name; along which lie the Seats of many Persons of Quality.</P>
<P>Near the Castle of <HI>Caddel</HI> or <HI>Calder,</HI> on that River, is a Vein of Free-stone, and many Signs of Copper.</P>
<P><HI>Tarnaway</HI> Castle, on the River <HI>Findorn,</HI> in this County, is an old Castle and Seat belonging to the Earls of <HI>Murray.</HI></P>
<P>A little lower on the other Side, stands the Burgh of <HI>Forress,</HI> in an exceeding pleasant Situation. The Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> formerly resided here, in a Castle that is now gone to Ruin; and lower, formerly, stood the noble Abbey of <HI>Kinloss.</HI></P>
<P>On the Road to <HI>Forress</HI> is a large Pillar of one Stone, being a Monument of a Victory obtained by King <HI>Malcolm Mac Kenneth</HI> over <HI>Sueno</HI> King of <HI>Denmark</HI>; the Inscription is now worn out. Be∣twixt this Place and <HI>Elgin,</HI> are numberless Seats of the Quality.</P>
<P>In this rich County, on the River <HI>Lossie,</HI> which rises a few Miles above it, and empties itself into the Sea a few Miles below it, lies <HI>Elgin,</HI> formerly a Bishop's See. It is situated in a very fruitful Soil, tho' somewhat sandy. The Ruins of the Castle are still to be seen on the East End of the Town; tho' demolish'd so long ago, as the Wars of the <HI>Danes.</HI> There was a noble Cathedral here, which for Large∣ness, Splendor, Magnificence and Workmanship, had hardly its Equal in the Kingdom. The usual Place of Residence of the Bishop was at the Castle of <HI>Spynie,</HI> within a Mile of the Town, a very noble Seat, with fine Gardens and Woods.</P>
<P>But tho' the Town of <HI>Elgin</HI> has Reason to be proud of its Situation, it was not very rich in its Town Revenues; for it had long laboured under
<PB N="199" REF="200"/>
heavy and burdensome Debts; which being increased by the Rebellion in 1715. put a Stop to divers of its new publick Works, and made several others run into Decay. At the same time the River <HI>Lossie</HI> having very insufficient Banks, the Chanel of it became choaked with Sand, which made it subject to overflow; and moreover, the Harbour of <HI>Lossie</HI> itself, which may be called the Port of <HI>Elgin,</HI> lying not far from it, became ruinous and decayed, to the great Prejudice of Persons trading in the <HI>Murray</HI> Firth, as well as to the Town. For all these Reasons, and in order to inlarge and im∣prove, as well as repair, the said Harbour of <HI>Lossie,</HI> an Act passed in the Year 1721, laying a Duty of Two-penies <HI>Scots</HI> on every <HI>Scots</HI> Pint of Ale or Beer, that should be vended within the said Town and its Liber∣ties; so that it bids fair to make as flourishing a Figure as it has done for Centuries past.</P>
<P>Above <HI>Elgin, Forress</HI> and <HI>Nairn,</HI> lies that Part of the Country called, <HI>The Bra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Murray,</HI> no way comparable to the lower Part for Fruitfulness; and beyond this are Mountains, Woods, and green Valleys; particularly <HI>Strathherin,</HI> well inha∣bited, and abounding with little Towns and Vil∣lages, and <HI>Strathnairn,</HI> a still better Soil, and possessed by several Gentlemen. <HI>Strathherin</HI> also abounds with Lakes, Mountains and Streams.</P>
<P>In this County lies <HI>Lochmoy,</HI> with an Island, where the Laird of <HI>Mackintosh</HI> (a Name well known in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> as well as <HI>Scotland,</HI> by means of the famous Bri∣gadier of that Name, who was taken Prisoner at the Battle of <HI>Preston,</HI> escaped out of <HI>Newgate,</HI> and lately died in Peace in <HI>Scotland</HI>) has his Seat. This Tribe is called <HI>Clan Chattau</HI>; and are numerous in this County.</P>
<P>But to say a few Words more of <HI>Elgin,</HI> before we leave this County: Gentlemen of all Parties and Opinions, as if this Town was the Court for this Part of the Island, leave their Highland Habitations in the Winter, and come to live at <HI>Elgin,</HI> with very
<PB N="200" REF="201"/>
engaging Freedom; so that it is a Place of greater Resort than could be imagined, at the Distance of 450 measured Miles from <HI>London,</HI> and more, if we must go by <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>This rich Country continues with very little In∣termission, till we come to <HI>Strathnairn,</HI> or the Valley of <HI>Nairn,</HI> where it extends a little farther in Breadth towards the Mountains, and is not inferior to the other in Fruitfulness: From the western Part of this County you may observe that the Land goes away again to the North; and, as if you were to enter into another Island beyond <HI>Britain,</HI> you find a large Lake or Inlet from the Sea of <HI>Murray,</HI> going on West, as if it were to cut through the Island; for we could see no End of it, nor could some of the Country-people tell us how far it reached, but that it went beyond <HI>Lochaber:</HI> So that we thought, till our Maps and further Inquisition informed us, it had joined the Western Ocean.</P>
<P>After we had travelled about twelve Miles, and descended from a rising Ground, upon which we then were; we perceived the Lake contracted in one par∣ticular Place to the ordinary Size of a River, as if designed by Nature to give Passage to the Inhabitants to converse with the Northern Part; and then it opened again to its former Breadth, and continued in the Form of a large Lake, as before, for many more Miles than we could see; being in the Whole, according to Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> 23 Miles long; but if it be taken on both Sides the Pass, 'tis above 35 Miles in Length.</P>
<P>This Situation must necessarily make the narrow Part a most important Pass, from the more Southerly Parts of <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Northern Countries, which are beyond it. We have been told, the <HI>Romans</HI> ne∣ver conquered thus far, and the Conquests of <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> have been much magnified on this Ac∣count; but if what Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> records, and is confirmed by other Accounts from the Men of
<PB N="201" REF="202"/>
Learning and Observation, be true, this must be a Mistake; for we are told, that near <HI>Bean</HI> Castle in the County of <HI>Nairn,</HI> there was found, in the Year 1406. a fine Marble Vessel curiously carved, which was full of <HI>Roman</HI> Coins of several Sorts; also several old Forts or Mounts have been seen here, which, by their Remains, evidently shewed themselves to be <HI>Roman.</HI></P>
<P>I now entered the Shire of <HI>Inverness,</HI> abounding with large Woods of Firr and Oak, and having in it some Iron Mines. It contains <HI>Badenock, Locha∣ber,</HI> and the South and West Parts of <HI>Rosse,</HI> and the Isle of <HI>Sky</HI>; of all which I shall speak, as they offer in the Course I took.</P>
<P>In the narrow Pass mentioned above, over the Lake stands the Town and Fortress of <HI>Inverness,</HI> that is, a Town on the inner Bank of the River <HI>Ness.</HI> The Situation of it (as I have said before) intimates, that it is a Place of Strength; and accord∣ingly it has a Castle, founded in antient Times to command the Pass: And some Authors write, that it was antiently a Royal House for the Kings of <HI>Scotland.</HI> Be that as it will, <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> thought it a Place of such Importance, that he built a strong Citadel here, and kept a stated Garison always in it, and sometimes more than a Garison; finding it needful to have a large Body of his old veteran Troops posted here to preserve the Peace of the Country, and keep the <HI>Highlanders</HI> in Awe, which they did effectually all his Time.</P>
<P>It is observed, that at the End of those troublesome Days, when the Troops on all Sides came to be dis∣banded, and the Men dispersed, abundance of <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Soldiers settled in this fruitful Part of the Country, from whence it received two Advantages:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They learnt the Art of Husbandry in full Per∣fection, which they did not understand before; which, with the Help of a rich Soil, has rendered this Part
<PB N="202" REF="203"/>
of the Country more fruitful than the rest of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> to this Day. And to this it is in some measure owing, that the Harvest is so early, and the Corn so good, as is observed above.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Soldiers initiated them thus into the Arts and Industry of the Husbandman, so they left them the <HI>English</HI> Accent upon their Tongues, which they likewise preserve to this Day; for they speak perfect <HI>English,</HI> even much better than in the most Southerly Provinces of <HI>Scotland</HI>; nay, some will say, as well as at <HI>London</HI> itself.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Their Tongue is not only <HI>Anglicised,</HI> but their Palates too; their Way of Eating and Cookery, Dress and Behaviour, is according to the Southern Mode: I wish they do not, in time, degenerate into Luxury, and forget that military Original which first reformed them.</P>
<P>The Fort which was then built, and afterwards demolished, has been restored since the Revolution, and a Garison was always kept here by King <HI>William,</HI> for the better regulating the <HI>Highlands</HI>; which Post was of singular Importance in the Time of the In∣surrection of the Earl of <HI>Marr</HI> for the <HI>Pretender</HI>; when, tho' his Party took it, they were driven out again by the Country with the Assistance of the Earl of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> and several other of the Nobility and Gentry, who stood fast to the King's Interest.</P>
<P><HI>Inverness</HI> may be said to be a pleasant, clean, and well-built Town. There are some Merchants in it, and it has a good Share of Trade. In it the Sheriff keeps his Court. It consists of two large handsome Streets, and has a stately Stone Bridge of seven large Arches over the River <HI>Ness,</HI> where (as I said before) it grows narrow between the Sea and the Lake. The Water of this River is almost always warm, and all the Year long is never so cold as to freeze; nay, in the sharpest Winter, if Cakes of Ice are thrown into it, they will be quickly thaw'd by its
<PB N="203" REF="204"/>
Warmth. Small Vessels may come up to the Town; but larger Ships, which often come thither for Corn, are forced to lie at some Distance East from it.</P>
<P>But it has been lately improved, and is still far∣ther improving; for in the Year 1718 an Act passed, for laying a Duty of a Sixth of a Peny Sterling on every Pint of Ale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> sold within the Town and its Privileges, for building a Church and making a Harbour there. The Preamble to the Act, giving a Description of the Place, and the Reasons of applying for it, I shall insert, and is to the fol∣lowing Effect:</P>
<P>That the Town of <HI>Inverness</HI> is situate near the Sea, and very capable of Improvements in its Trade and Commerce, and having but a very small publick Revenue, incumbered with Debts, and those in∣creased by the Expence the Inhabitants were at in opposing the Rebellion of 1715. And the Church of the said Town, beside, being ruinous, was not large enough to contain the Inhabitants; for the effecting of these good Purposes the said Act was passed.</P>
<P>This Act was to be in Force for 19 Years only; and the first five Years it produced so well, that the Magistrates of <HI>Inverness</HI> entered upon a Design greatly to inlarge and improve their Harbour; in order to which they purchased Grounds, rented Quarries, built Boats for transporting Stone, deepened their Harbour, erected Bulwarks and Quays; so that it was made much more commodious than ever: But the next 13 Years the Produce of the Duties was so low, occasioned by the excessive Use of run Tea and Brandy, which People could buy so cheap, that the Consumption of Beer and Ale was greatly lessened, and they having run much behind-hand, were forced to apply for a further Continuation of the Act; and accordingly, in the 11th Year of King <HI>George</HI> II. an Act passed for continuing the same for
<PB N="204" REF="205"/>
21 Years more, for paying the Debts contracted, and effecting the other good Purposes I have mentioned. Which, when done, will make <HI>Inver∣ness</HI> a Place of as great Account as any in the North of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>When we are over the Bridge of <HI>Inverness,</HI> you enter that which we truly call the North of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> and others the North <HI>Highlands</HI>; in which are several distinct Shires, but cannot call for a par∣ticular Description, because they are all one un∣distinguished Range of Mountains and Woods, over∣spread with vast and almost uninhabited Rocks and Steeps filled with Deer innumerable of various Kinds; among which are some of those the Antients called <HI>Harts</HI> and <HI>Roebucks,</HI> with over-grown Stags and Hinds of the Red-deer Kind.</P>
<P>Before I describe this frightful Country, it is ne∣cessary to observe, that <HI>Scotland</HI> may be divided into four Districts, which I have not seen any of our Geographers do before me; yet, I believe, may not be an improper Measurement for such as would form a due Idea of the Whole in their Minds.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>South-land,</HI> or that Part of <HI>Scotland</HI> South of the River <HI>Tay,</HI> drawing a Line from the <HI>Tay,</HI> about <HI>Perth,</HI> to <HI>Loch-lomond,</HI> and down to <HI>Dumbar∣ton,</HI> and the Bank of <HI>Clyde.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The <HI>Middle,</HI> or <HI>Mid-land,</HI> being all the Country from the <HI>Tay</HI> and the <HI>Lough-lomond,</HI> North to the Lake of <HI>Ness</HI> and <HI>Aber,</HI> including a long Slope to the South, taking in the Western <HI>Highlands</HI> of <HI>Argyll</HI> and <HI>Lorn,</HI> and the Isles of <HI>Isla</HI> and <HI>Jura.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The <HI>North-land,</HI> being all the Country be∣yond <HI>Inverness,</HI> and the <HI>Lough</HI> or River <HI>Ness,</HI> North, drawing the Line over the narrow Space of <HI>Glen∣gary</HI>; between the <HI>Ness</HI> and <HI>Aber,</HI> and bounded by them both from the Eastern to the Western Sea.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="205" REF="206"/>4. The <HI>Islands,</HI> being all the Western and North∣ern Islands, the <HI>Hebrides, Skye, Orkneys,</HI> and other Isles of <HI>Shetland.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>According to this Description, having passed the Bridge over the River <HI>Ness,</HI> I am now entered on the third Division of <HI>Scotland</HI> called the <HI>North-land.</HI> Here are not only the best Hawks of all Kinds, but Eagles in great Numbers, which prey upon the young Fawns when they fall first, and upon Wild Fowl, with which this Part of the Country abounds.</P>
<P>The Rivers and Lakes also in this Country are so prodigiously full of Salmon, that it is hardly credible what Quantities are taken in the <HI>Spey,</HI> the <HI>Nairn,</HI> the <HI>Ness,</HI> and other Rivers hereabout.</P>
<P>The several Countries beyond the <HI>Ness</HI> are, <HI>Ross, Sutherland, Strathnavern, Caithness,</HI> and beyond those the Islands of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Shetland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sutherland</HI> is called the Shire of <HI>Dornoch,</HI> from the chief Town of the Province called <HI>Dornoch,</HI> a Royal Burgh, noted for a Castle belonging to the Earl of <HI>Sutherland</HI>; for its Cathedral Church for the Diocese of <HI>Caithness,</HI> which once was Part of this Shire; and for its four annual Fairs. It has three remarkable Forests, besides abundance of other Woods, which afford pleasant Hunting and Fowling. One sort of Bird is peculiar to this Country, called <HI>Knug,</HI> which resembles a Parrot, and digs its Nest in the Trunks of Oak, with its Beak. There are about 60 Lakes in this County: The greatest is <HI>Lochskin,</HI> 14 Miles in Length; in many of them are Islands very pleasant for Summer Habitations. In the Isle of <HI>Brora,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Sutherland</HI> has a House, which he makes use of when he comes to hunt Deer, which abound in it; and in some of the Lakes and Rivers of this County, as well as in the Rivers of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and <HI>Rosse,</HI> are found Pearls of great Value. In short, this Shire so abounds with Lakes, Rivers, and Bays, that there is scarce a Farm in the whole County,
<PB N="206" REF="207"/>
but is washed either with fresh or salt Water, so that the Inhabitants have Store of Fish and Fowl. The Beer or Big in this County is reckoned excellent. It has also Silver Mines, and excellent Iron Mines, Coal Mines, and Quarries of Free-stone, but much neglected. It has many commodious Harbours for Ships to export its Commodities; which are Cod, Salmon, salt Beef, Wool, Skins, Hides, Tallow, Butter, Cheese, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Bays and Coasts also abound with Seals, have sometimes Whales, and Shell Fish of all sorts.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Sutherland</HI> has a Castle beyond <HI>In∣verness,</HI> called <HI>Dunrobin,</HI> situate on the Eastern Shore, of which his Lordship was sent down by Sea to take an early Possession in the late Rebellion; and which if he had not done, would soon have fallen into the Hands of the late Earl of <HI>Marr</HI>'s Party; but his coming timely thither, prevented him and the Country on that Side, from joining the Troops of the <HI>Pretender.</HI> In the Gardens of this Seat, tho' so Northerly, Saffron grows very well, and comes to Maturity.</P>
<P><HI>Strathnavern</HI> is Part of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> and derives its Name from <HI>Strath,</HI> a Valley, situated on the River <HI>Navern,</HI> which runs thro' it. The Country is moun∣tainous, and formerly was noted for breeding greater Numbers of ravenous Wolves than any other in <HI>Scotland.</HI> The Bays and Rivers are full of Fish; it is very woody, and many Lakes are in the Val∣leys. There are several Monuments in it, of Victories gained over the <HI>Danes,</HI> particularly one at <HI>Enbo,</HI> which is a Stone Cross, said to be over a <HI>Danish</HI> King. The Inhabitants are great Hunters, and despise those who are not; so that Venison with them is a common Dish. The Situation of the Country not admitting of Towns, the Inhabitants live up and down in small Villages. On the Northern Coast of this County are several Islands.
<PB N="207" REF="208"/>
Of the many Lakes, <HI>Lochnavern</HI> and <HI>Lochyol</HI> are the largest, and the latter affords an Island which is inhabited in the Summer time. <HI>Borwe</HI> and <HI>Young,</HI> are the Places of most Note, the latter the principal Seat of the Lord <HI>Rea,</HI> Chief of the <HI>Mackays,</HI> who is the principal Proprietor of <HI>Strathnavern</HI>; but holds it of the Earl of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> to whose eldest Son it gives the Title of Lord. The Earls of <HI>Suther∣land</HI> were formerly of the Name of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> to the Heiress of which a Son of the House of <HI>Gordon</HI> mar∣ried, from whom the present Earl is descended. They have a long time claimed Precedency, as the first Earls of the Kingdom, and in order to recover it, have re-assumed their former Name. They have great Royalties, as being Admirals of that, and some of the neighbouring Counties, and all the Gentlemen of <HI>Sutherland</HI> hold of them. Lord <HI>Duffus</HI> is descended of this Family. The Earl is Hereditary Sheriff of it. The County has several Mountains of white Marble, as we were told.</P>
<P>North of the Mouth of the River <HI>Nesse,</HI> is the famous <HI>Cromarty</HI> Bay, or <HI>Cromarty</HI> Firth, noted for being the finest Harbour, with the least Business, perhaps, of any in <HI>Britain.</HI> It is 15 Miles long, and in many Places two Miles broad; and, like <HI>Milford-haven</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> is able to receive the Royal Navy of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> both to go out and come in with Safety; but, for want of Trade, this noble Harbour, which by Geographers and Mariners, is called <HI>Portus Salutis,</HI> or <HI>the Harbour of Safety,</HI> is become almost useless.</P>
<P>The Shire of <HI>Cromarty</HI> is denominated from a Royal Burgh, standing upon the Firth of <HI>Cromarty.</HI> The Waters of <HI>Connel</HI> are celebrated for the Pearls found in them. Of great Part of this County the Earl of <HI>Cromarty</HI> is Sheriff and Proprietor. The Straths or Valleys upon the Water-side abound with Woods. Particularly, upon the Hills is great
<PB N="208" REF="209"/>
Store of all sorts of Game; also near <HI>Alserig,</HI> upon the Waters of <HI>Braan,</HI> and on the <HI>Carron,</HI> are great Woods of Fir.</P>
<P>All the County beyond the River <HI>Nesse,</HI> and the <HI>Loch</HI> flowing into it, is called <HI>Caithness,</HI> and extends to the Northermost Land in <HI>Scotland.</HI> It is divided from <HI>Sutherland</HI> by the Mountain <HI>Ord,</HI> and a Tract of Mountains running from it as far as <HI>Knochfin.</HI></P>
<P>Some People tell us they have Lead, Copper, and Iron in this Part of <HI>Scotland</HI>; and I am very much inclined to believe it; but it seems reserved for a future and more industrious Age to search into it. Should a Time come, when these hidden Treasures of the Earth shall be discovered and improved, this Part of <HI>Scotland</HI> would be no longer esteemed poor; for such a Production would soon change the Face of Things, bring Wealth and Commerce to it, fill the Harbours with Ships, the Towns with People, and by consuming the Provisions, occasion the Soil to be cultivated, the Fish cured, the Cattle con∣sumed at Home, and thereby diffuse Prosperity all around them.</P>
<P>Our Writers have represented the Inhabitants here wild and barbarous: They were so formerly, per∣haps; but we see the <HI>Mackenzies, Macleods, Suther∣lands, M<SUP>c</SUP> Leans, M<SUP>c</SUP> Donalds, Gordons, M<SUP>c</SUP> Keys, Macfergusons, M<SUP>c</SUP> Intoshes,</HI> and others sprung from thence, equally accomplished for the Court or Camp.</P>
<P>It must be owned, here are but few Towns; the People live dispersed in Clans under a kind of Vas∣salage, submitting to their Lords as their lawful Monarchs, and many of them acknowledge no other; tho' this too, is in a manner got over, and the Clans are less dependent on their Chiefs, than they used to be, by virtue of an Act of Parliament made for that very Purpose.</P>
<P>Their Employment is chiefly Hunting for their Food, tho' they also breed large Quantities of Black
<PB N="209" REF="210"/>
Cattle, with which they pay their Lairds or Leaders the Rent of the Lands. These Cattle are driven annually to <HI>England</HI> to be sold, and are bought up chiefly in the Counties of <HI>Norfolk, Suffolk,</HI> and <HI>Essex</HI>; as I have mentioned in several Places in my <HI>Tour.</HI></P>
<P>There are many little Towns and Villages, besides Gentlemens Seats in <HI>Caithness,</HI> as far North as it is: But the People are more addicted to good Living within Doors, than to shewy Edifices, or fine Seats. The best House in it, is Castle <HI>Sinclair,</HI> so called from the Name of the Earls of <HI>Sinclair,</HI> whose Seat it is, and they have several other Castles in the County. The Lord <HI>Sinclair</HI> of <HI>Ravensheugh</HI> in <HI>Fife</HI> is chief of the Name. His Ancestors formerly possessed <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Shetland,</HI> and were allied to the Royal Family of <HI>Denmark.</HI> But one of the Family squandered away his Estate, and among the rest, these Islands; and got for it the inglorious Title of, <HI>William the Waster.</HI> The chief Town and Royal Burgh in <HI>Caithness</HI> is <HI>Wick</HI> or <HI>Weich,</HI> whence it is called the Shire of <HI>Weich.</HI> This Town lies conveniently for Trade, and has a good Harbour for Ships on the Eastern Coast. It is the Residence of the Sheriff, or his Officer.</P>
<P><HI>Thurso,</HI> another Town with a good Harbour, lies also on the Northern Coast, in a little Bay. The Isles of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Shetland,</HI> I refer to the Account of the Isles.</P>
<P>And I shall observe, once for all, that I am the more particular in my Description of these Northern Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> because they are least known, and less valued and esteemed than they deserve.</P>
<P>This County is surrounded with the Sea, and those two great Inlets of Water, mentioned above, called the <HI>Ness</HI> and the <HI>Abre:</HI> So that it forms a Peninsula, by means of that small Neck of Land of about eight Miles long, which Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> calls the <HI>Garrow</HI> or <HI>Glengarrough,</HI> others <HI>Glengary.</HI> Were
<PB N="210" REF="211"/>
it not for this, the whole Division of the <HI>North∣land</HI> would be a distinct Island, separated from all the rest of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as effectually as the <HI>Ork∣neys</HI> or the Isle of <HI>Skye</HI> is from this.</P>
<P>That Part which lies to the East, is open to the Sea, without Cover; the West and the North are, in a manner, surrounded with Out-works as a Defence to break off the raging Ocean from the North; for the Western Islands on one Side, and the <HI>Orkneys</HI> on the other, lie as so many advanced Fortifications or Redoubts, to combat that Enemy at a Distance.</P>
<P>From <HI>Dunrobin</HI> Castle you have nothing of Note offers itself, either by Sea or Land, but an extended Shore lying North and South, without Towns, and without Harbours; and as there are none of the former to be found, so there are none of the last wanting.</P>
<P>The Land thus extended lies North and South to <HI>Dungsby-head,</HI> which is the utmost Extent of it, on the East-side of <HI>Britain</HI> North, and is distant from <HI>Cromarty</HI> 18 Leagues North. From this Point of <HI>Dingsby</HI> or <HI>Dungsby-head,</HI> as I observed before of <HI>Buchan</HI> and <HI>Winterton,</HI> the Sailors take their Distances, and keep their Accounts in their going farther North; <HI>e. g.</HI></P>
<P>From this Point of <HI>Dingsby-head</HI> to the <HI>Fair-isle</HI> or <HI>Faro,</HI> which is the first of <HI>Shetland,</HI> or the last of the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> (call it which you will; for it lies be∣tween both) is 25 Leagues, or 75 Miles.</P>
<P>From the same <HI>Dungsby-head</HI> to <HI>Sumburgh-head,</HI> that is, to <HI>Shetland,</HI> is 32 Leagues, or 96 Miles, and to <HI>Lerwick</HI> Fort in <HI>Shetland</HI> 110 Miles.</P>
<P>Thus from <HI>Buchanness</HI> to <HI>Sumburgh-head</HI> in <HI>Shet∣land,</HI> is 47 Leagues.</P>
<P>And from <HI>Wintertonness</HI> near <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> to <HI>Buchanness,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> is just 100 Leagues. So from <HI>Winterton</HI> to <HI>Shetland</HI> is 147 Leagues, or 431 Miles.</P>
<P>I am now to observe, that we are here at the ex∣tremest Point of the Island of <HI>Great Britain</HI>; and
<PB N="211" REF="212"/>
that here the Land bears away West, leaving a large Streight or Sea, which they call <HI>Pictland,</HI> or <HI>Pentland Firth,</HI> and which divides between the Island of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the Isles of the <HI>Orkneys</HI>; a Passage broad and fair; for 'tis not less than five Leagues over, and has a sufficient Depth of Water for Ships to sail in: But the Tides are so fierce, so uncertain, and the Gusts and sudden Squalls of Wind so fre∣quent, that very few Merchant Ships care to venture thro' it, and the <HI>Dutch East-India</HI> Ships, which come North about, (as 'tis called) in their Return from <HI>India,</HI> keep all farther off, and chuse to come by <HI>Fair-isle,</HI> in the Passage between the Islands of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Shetland</HI>; whither they generally send their Men of War to meet them, being sure of not missing them in so narrow a Passage.</P>
<P>But the Passage here is much broader, being at least nine Leagues from North <HI>Ranalsha,</HI> the farthest Island of the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> to <HI>Fair-isle,</HI> and five more from <HI>Fair-isle</HI> to <HI>Shetland:</HI> So that it is 14 Leagues clear open Sea between the <HI>Orkneys</HI> and <HI>Shetland,</HI> with only a small Island in the Way, which has nothing dangerous about it.</P>
<P>In the Passage between the Land's End of <HI>Britain</HI> and the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> is a small Island, which our Mari∣ners call <HI>Stroma,</HI> Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> and others, <HI>Sowna</HI>; and is much spoken of as dangerous for Ships: But I see no room to record any thing of that kind, any more than the Report, that it is haunted by Witches and Spirits, which draw Ships on Shore to their Misfortune.</P>
<P>At <HI>Dungsby-head</HI> is the most Northerly Land of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> where, in the Month of <HI>June,</HI> after a clear Day, we could see to read the smallest Print, and to write distinctly, all Night long, without the Help of a Candle.</P>
<P>No wonder the antient Mariners, be they <HI>Phoe∣nician</HI> or <HI>Carthaginian,</HI> who knew nothing of the Motion of the heavenly Bodies, when they were
<PB N="212" REF="213"/>
driven thus far, were surprised to find they had lost the steady Rotation of Day and Night, which they thought had spread over the whole Globe. They imagined the <HI>Elysian</HI> Fields must lie this Way, when they found they were come already to the Realm of everlasting Day.</P>
<P>From hence West we go along the Shore of the <HI>Firth,</HI> which they call <HI>Pentland,</HI> where is the famous House called <HI>John a Grot</HI>'s. We set our Horses Feet into the Sea, on the most Northerly Land, as the People say, of <HI>Britain,</HI> tho', I think, <HI>Dungsby∣head</HI> is as far North. 'Tis certain, however, the Difference is but very small, being either of them in the Latitude of 59⅙ North, and <HI>Shetland</HI> reaching above two Degrees farther. The Dominions of <HI>Great Britain</HI> are extended from the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> in the Latitude of 50 Degrees, to the Isles of <HI>Unsta</HI> in <HI>Shetland,</HI> in the Latitude of 61 Degrees 30 Minutes, being 10 Degrees, or full 600 Miles, in Length; which Island of <HI>Unst</HI> or <HI>Unsta,</HI> being the most remote of the Isles of <HI>Shetland</HI> to the North-east, lies 167 Leagues from <HI>Wintertonness</HI> in <HI>Nor∣folk.</HI></P>
<P>Here we found, however mountainous and wild the Country appeared, the People extremely well furnished with Provisions, especially four Sorts in great Plenty; two of them sufficient for a common Table, the other two the Splendor of the greatest
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Very good Bread, as well Oat Bread as Wheat, tho' the last not so cheap as the first.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Venison exceeding plentiful, and at all Seasons, young or old, which they kill with their Guns where∣ever they find it, for there is no Restraint; on which Account all the Highlanders have Fire-arms, and become excellent Marksmen.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Salmon in such Plenty as is scarce credible, and consequently so cheap, that to those who have any Substance to buy with, it is not worth giving
<PB N="213" REF="214"/>
themselves any Trouble to catch it. This they eat fresh in the Season, and at other times cured by being dried in the Sun, and so preserved all the Year.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. They have no want of Cows and Sheep, but the latter are so wild, that sometimes, were they not, by their own Disposition, used to flock together, they would be much harder to kill than the Deer.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>From hence to the West Point of the Passage to <HI>Orkney</HI> is near 20 Miles, which may be called the End of the Island of <HI>Britain,</HI> which faces directly to the North Pole, so that the Tail of the <HI>Great Bear</HI> is seen just over your Head. The Day is here, in Summer, said to be 18 Hours long, the Sun remaining so long above the Horizon; and when he is set, he makes so small an Arch of a Circle below the Horizon, that it is much above a Twilight all the Night; but it must be remembered, that the dark Nights take in Winter their Turn, and are protracted to as great a Degree.</P>
<P>Yet it is observable here, that they have more temperate Winters, generally speaking, than we have in the most Southerly Part of the Island; and parti∣cularly, the Water in some of the Rivers, as in the <HI>Ness,</HI> for Example, never freezes (as I have observed before); which is accounted for from the Nearness of the Sea, which filling the Air with salt Vapours, sheathes, as it were, the acute Particles of the Cold.</P>
<P>For the same Reason the Snows are not so deep, nor do they lie so long upon the Ground, as in other Places. The Summits indeed of the high Hills, whither these Vapours cannot reach, are continually covered with Snow, and perhaps have been so for many Ages, so that this Country, if any in the World, agrees with the following Description:
<Q><L><HI>— Vast wat'ry Lakes, which spread below,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And Mountains cover'd with eternal Snow.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="215"/>On the most inland Parts of this Country, espe∣cially in the Shire of <HI>Ross,</HI> they have vast Woods of Fir-trees for 15 or 20 Miles in Length, not planted by Mens Hands, as I have described in the Southern Part of <HI>Scotland</HI>; but as they came out of the Hands of Nature, and nourished by her Hand-maid, Time. If we may believe the Inhabitants, they are large enough to make Masts for the biggest Ships; and yet are of no Service, merely for want of the Con∣venience of Water-carriage to bring them away. But methinks, rather than they should remain an use∣less Burden to the Earth, they might be cut down and burnt, from whence might be drawn vast Quan∣tities of Pitch, Tar, Rosin, Turpentine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is of easier Carriage, and would well answer the Trouble. Indeed an Attempt has been made of this kind for Pot-ash; but it did not succeed, rather thro' the Fault of the Undertakers at <HI>London,</HI> than any thing else.</P>
<P>And now leaving the Northern Prospect, we pass the opposite Point West from <HI>Dungsby-head,</HI> and which the People call <HI>Farro-head,</HI> tho' Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> calls these two Points by two different Names: The East Point, or <HI>Dungsby-head,</HI> he calls <HI>Virvedrum Promontorium.</HI> The West Point, or <HI>Farro-head,</HI> he calls <HI>Sarvedrum Promontorium.</HI></P>
<P>From hence the vast Western <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean appears, for which the Geographers have not agreed upon a Name, there being no Country to derive it from.</P>
<P>And now we were to turn our Faces South; for as to the Islands of this Sea, which make the fourth Division of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as I mentioned before, I shall take notice of them under one Head, in the Con∣clusion of my <HI>Tour.</HI></P>
<P>In our Attempt to come down to the Southward by the Coast of <HI>Tayne,</HI> and the Shire of <HI>Ross,</HI> we should have been extremely disappointed, and per∣haps
<PB N="215" REF="216"/>
have been obliged to get a Ship or Bark, to have carried us round the Isle of <HI>Skye</HI> into <HI>Locha∣ber,</HI> had it not been for the extraordinary Courtesy of some of the Gentlemen of the Country.</P>
<P>On the other hand, we unexpectedly met here some <HI>English</HI> Men, who were employ'd by Merchants in the South, to take and cure a large Quantity of White-fish, and afterwards of Herrings, on account of Trade. Here we had not only the Civility of their Assistance and Accommodation in our Journey, but the Pleasure of seeing what Progress they made in their Undertaking.</P>
<P>As for the Herrings, the Quantity of them was prodigious. The Shoal was beginning to come, when we first came to the Head of <HI>Pentland Firth</HI>; and in a Fortnight's time, the Body of their num∣berless Shoals began to appear; but before we left the Coast, you would have ventur'd to say of the Sea, as they do of the River <HI>Tibiscus,</HI> or <HI>Thiesse</HI> in <HI>Hun∣gary,</HI> that it was one third Water, and two thirds Fish. The Operation of taking them could hardly be called Fishing; for they did little more than dip for them into the Water, and take them up. I make no Scruple to say, that if there had been 10,000 Ships to have loaded with them, they might all have been filled. The Fish did not seem to stay, but passed on to the South, that they might supply other Parts, and make way also for those innumerable Shoals which were to come after.</P>
<P>Had the Quantity of White-fish been any way proportioned to the Herrings, there would, no doubt, have been such Encouragement to the Merchants, that they would never have given it over; but they found it would not fully answer: Not but that there were great Quantities of Cod, and the Fish were size∣able and good; but as they are taken with Hook and Line, they could not with any Dispatch get a suffi∣cient
<PB N="216" REF="217"/>
Loading, or lay up enough in large Quanti∣ties in the Season.</P>
<P>The Bay of <HI>Tayne</HI> is unsafe for Ships, runs a great way up into the County, divides <HI>Rosse</HI> from <HI>Suther∣land,</HI> and ends at the Promontory of <HI>Tarbat.</HI> We found the Town of <HI>Tayne,</HI> and some other Villages, tolerably well inhabited, and some Trade also, oc∣casioned principally by the Communication with the Western Islands, and also by the Herring-fishing, the Fishing-boats from other Parts often putting into those Ports; for all their Coast is full of Loughs and Rivers, and other Openings, which make very good Harbours for Shipping; and what is remarkable, some of those Loughs are infinitely full of Herrings, even where, as they tell us, they have no Commu∣nication with the Sea, so that they must have, in all Probability, been put into them alive by some parti∣cular Hands, and have multiplied there, as we find at this Time, if they have not some Communi∣cations with the Sea, which are not discovered to the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>We could understand no more of what the Peo∣ple commonly said on this Side, than if we had been in <HI>Morocco</HI>; all the Remedy we had was, that we found most of the Gentlemen spoke <HI>French,</HI> and some few broad <HI>Scotish.</HI> It was indeed upon other Accounts much for our Convenience to make the common People believe we were <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Should we go about here to give you an Account of the Religion of the People in this Country, it would be an unpleasant Work, and perhaps scarce gain Credit. You would hardly believe, that in a Christian Island, as this is said to be, there should be People who know so little of the Christian Religion, as not to distinguish <HI>Sunday</HI> from a common Day of Labour, or the Worship of God from an ordinary Meeting for Conversation. I am unwilling to re∣cord so ungrateful a Truth, which may in time find
<PB N="217" REF="218"/>
Redress; but I cannot but say that his Majesty's Gift of 1000<HI>l.</HI> paid annually to the Assembly of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for sending Ministers or Missionaries for the propagating Christian Knowledge in the <HI>High∣lands,</HI> is certainly one of the most needful Charities that could have been thought of, and truly worthy of a King; and, if prudently applied, as there is Reason to believe it is, may in time dispel that Cloud of Ignorance that has so far overspread this unhappy Part of the Country. The People have the <HI>Bible</HI> in their own Language, the IRS; and the Missionaries are obliged to preach to them, and examine and catechise their Children in the IRS Language, so that we are not to despair of having this Country as well instructed in time as other Parts of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The Shire of <HI>Tayne,</HI> with the little Shire of <HI>Cromarty,</HI> and part of the Shire of <HI>Inverness,</HI> com∣prehends the whole Country called <HI>Rosse.</HI> The first Tract towards the South-west in the County of <HI>Rosse,</HI> is <HI>Kintail,</HI> separated from the Isle of <HI>Skye</HI> by a narrow Firth. Next is a little Track called <HI>Gle∣nelebeg,</HI> the paternal Estate of the Earl of <HI>Seaforth,</HI> whose chief Seat is called <HI>Castle Ylendoven,</HI> lying in an Island of the above-mentioned Firth. Farther North, on the same Coast, lies <HI>Loch-ew,</HI> with thick Woods, where Iron was formerly made. A little farther North, <HI>Loch-brien</HI> runs into this County, and is remarkable for its noble annual Fishery of Herrings.</P>
<P>The Peninsula which lies betwixt the Bay of <HI>Cromarty</HI> and <HI>Murray</HI> is called <HI>Ardmeanach,</HI> upon the Shore of which stands the Town called, <HI>the Chanonry of Ross,</HI> formerly a Bishop's See. It is plea∣santly situated in a Valley betwixt fruitful Hills. It had once a stately Cathedral and Castle, where the Bishop dwelt. Here the late Earl of <HI>Seaforth</HI> had a noble House. <HI>Beaulieu,</HI> formerly a pleasant and rich Abbey, lies near the Mouth of the River
<PB N="218" REF="219"/>
<HI>Farrar,</HI> and is now possessed by the Lord <HI>Lovat.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Seaforth</HI> had near it a Castle called <HI>Kildun.</HI> There are other Seats of antient Families in this County, which my Compass will not let me describe, and I shall mention them at the latter End of my <HI>Tour,</HI> in a general List, that you may be enabled to form an Idea of the numerous Families of Gentry which <HI>Scotland</HI> produces.</P>
<P>On this Coast is the Isle of <HI>Skye,</HI> lying from the West-north-west, to the East-south-east, and bear∣ing upon the main Island, only separated by a nar∣row Streight of Water; something like as the Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> is separated from the County of <HI>Southampton.</HI> We left this on our Right, and crossing the Moun∣tains, came, with as little Stay as we could, to the Loughs called <HI>Lochyol,</HI> and <HI>Lochlochy,</HI> which run thro' that large Country called <HI>Lochaber,</HI> that is, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver</HI> the Lochs, and which some affect to call the River <HI>Aber</HI> or <HI>Abre, i. e.</HI> the Water which, as I said above, assists, with <HI>Loughness,</HI> or <HI>Lochness,</HI> to separate the North Land of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from the middle Part.</P>
<P>This is a long and narrow Inlet of the Sea, in Length above 24 Miles, the Depth unknown, which opening from the <HI>Irish Sea</HI> South-west, meets the River <HI>Abre,</HI> or, as the <HI>Scots</HI> much more properly express it, the Water of <HI>Abre</HI>; for it is rather a large Lake or <HI>Loch</HI> than a River, and receives innumerable small Rivers into it. It rises in the Mountains of <HI>Ross,</HI> or of <HI>Glengary,</HI> within five or six Miles from the Shore of the <HI>Lochness,</HI> or the Water of <HI>Ness,</HI> which is a long and narrow Lake like itself; and as the <HI>Ness</HI> runs away East to <HI>Innerness,</HI> and so into the great Gulph called <HI>Murray Firth,</HI> so the <HI>Abre,</HI> becoming presently a <HI>Loch</HI> or Lake, always goes away more to the Southward, and sloping South-west, runs into the <HI>Irish Seas,</HI> as above.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="220"/><HI>Lochaber</HI> is 50 Miles in a strait Line from <HI>Inver∣lochy</HI> to <HI>Inverness,</HI> and is one of the most barren Countries in <HI>North Britain,</HI> tho' the People have Wood, Goats and Deer in Plenty. <HI>Glenco</HI> is almost the only Town in it; noted for the barbarous and inhuman Massacre perpetrated there by K. <HI>William</HI>'s Soldiers, quartered in those Parts, and who cut off Men, Women and Children without Mercy. A Massacre that made a great Noise, and was uni∣versally detested; and what made it still the more odious was, that the Commander in that bloody Work found Friends enough to screen him from the Inquiry that was attempted to be made into the horrid Fact, in order to find out who gave him his Orders for it.</P>
<P><HI>Lochaber</HI> is noted in History for <HI>Banco,</HI> its gallant Thane, about the Year 1050, who was murdered by the Tyrant <HI>Macbeth,</HI> because of a Prophecy, <HI>That his Posterity should enjoy the Crown for a long Series of Years:</HI> Which accordingly happened; for his Son flying into <HI>Wales,</HI> married the Prince of <HI>North Wales</HI>'s Daughter; by whom he had <HI>Walter,</HI> afterwards Steward of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from whom the Royal Family of <HI>Stuart</HI> was descended. It was on this Story that our celebrated <HI>Shakespeare</HI> founded his Tragedy called <HI>Macbeth.</HI></P>
<P>On this Water of <HI>Abre,</HI> just at the Entrance of the <HI>Loch,</HI> was antiently a Fort built to curb the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> on either Side, called <HI>Inverlochy.</HI> It was formerly of great Strength, and yet often de∣stroy'd by the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Norwegians.</HI> And at the Revolution, King <HI>William</HI> caused it to be rebuilt, or rather erected a new Fort there, which is called <HI>Castle William,</HI> as the Village is <HI>Mary-burgh</HI>; and there is always a good Garison kept in it for curbing the <HI>Highlanders.</HI> It is so situated, that tho' it may indeed be blocked up by Land, and distressed by a
<PB N="220" REF="221"/>
Siege, yet, as it is open to the Sea, it may constantly receive Supplies by Shipping.</P>
<P>From <HI>Inverlochy</HI> to <HI>Lochness</HI> has General <HI>Wade,</HI> with the most commendable Industry and Pains, thro' almost inaccessible Mountains, and Mosses, and Morasses, made a most convenient Road, which even surpasses (the County consider'd) what the <HI>Romans</HI> had done with their several Military Ways; and shews, that the Soldiery might be made useful even in Times of Peace, and rather a Benefit than a Burden to the Country; and at the same time so inure them to Toil, Labour, and Hardiness, as would render them fitter for their Country's Service in Time of War. To defend this Road from the Rage of the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> and at the same time to keep them in Awe, the General built a regular For∣tification, which is called <HI>Fort Augustus.</HI> By this means the <HI>Highlands,</HI> which before were inaccessi∣ble but by <HI>Highlanders,</HI> who eluded always the Re∣sentment of their Pursuers, are easily entered, and traversed at the Pleasure of the King's Forces; and even the noted <HI>Rob Roy</HI> himself, (so famous for his Excursions and Plunders on the <HI>Lowlands,</HI> and the King's Friends, and who, notwithstanding the Pro∣clamations, and Rewards issued for apprehending him, could never be taken) were he alive, would not be able now to find a Place of Refuge from his Pursuers. And this must be in time a great Help to the civilizing of the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> as the Schools established among them (of which more by-and-by) will be another.</P>
<P>At this Place we take our Leave of the Third Division, which I call the North Land of <HI>Scotland</HI>; for this Fort, being on the South-side of the <HI>Loch∣aber,</HI> is therefore called <HI>Innerlochy,</HI> as the other for the like Reason was called <HI>Innerness.</HI></P>
<P>We have nothing now remaining for a full Survey of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but the Western Part of the Middle
<PB N="221" REF="222"/>
Division of <HI>Scotland</HI>; and this, tho' a large Country, yet affords not an equal Variety with the Eastern Part of the same Division.</P>
<P>To traverse the Remainder of this Country, I must begin upon the <HI>Upper Tay,</HI> as we may justly call it, where I left off, when I turned away East; and here we have in especial manner the Countries of <HI>Badenach, Athol</HI> and <HI>Braidalbin:</HI> This is a hilly Country indeed; but as it is water'd by the <HI>Tay,</HI> and many other pleasant Rivers which fall into it, there are several fruitful Valleys interspersed among the Hills; nor are even the <HI>Highlands</HI> themselves, or the <HI>Highlanders</HI> the Inhabitants, any thing so wild, untaught, or untractable, as we have been made to believe, and as are to be found in the North Land Division, that is to say, in <HI>Strathnavern, Ross, Tain,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Athol</HI> is Lord, I had almost said King, of this Country; and has the greatest Number of Vassals, of any Nobleman in this, or any Part of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The late Duke was always an Opposer of the Union in the Parliament holden at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> for passing it into an Act; but he did not carry his Opposition to a Height of Tumult and Rebellion. If he had, as some were forward to have had him done, he would possibly at that time have bid fair to have prevented the Conclusion of it: But the Hour was come, when the Calamities of War, which for so many hundred Years had vexed the two Nations, were to have an End; and tho' the <HI>English</HI> Govern∣ment had never less Power than then in <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet the Affair was carried thro' with a high Hand, all the little Tumults and Disorders of the Rabble, as well at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> as at <HI>Glasgow,</HI> and other Places, being timely suppressed, and others by prudent Management prevented.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="223"/>The Duke has several fine Seats in this Country; as first at <HI>Dunkeld,</HI> upon the <HI>Tay,</HI> which I mentioned before, where there was a Fight between the regular Troops and the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> in the Beginning of the Reign of King <HI>William</HI>; another at <HI>Huntingtour,</HI> in the <HI>Strathern,</HI> or Valley of <HI>Ern,</HI> where the Duke has a fine Park, and great Store of Deer; which may be called his Hunting-seat, whither he some∣times retires for Sport.</P>
<P>He has another Seat at the Castle of <HI>Blair,</HI> far∣ther North, and beyond the <HI>Tay,</HI> on the Edge of <HI>Braidalbin,</HI> upon the Banks of a clear and fine River, which falls into the <HI>Tay</HI> a few Miles lower.</P>
<P>The Country of <HI>Braidalbin</HI> has not so much as a single Village in it of ten Houses; yet from its <HI>Latin</HI> Name <HI>Albania,</HI> gives oft-times the Title of Duke to some of the Royal Family; 'tis seated very near the Centre of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and is alledged to be the highest Ground in it, for that the Rivers which rise here, are said to run every Way from this Part, some into the <HI>Eastern,</HI> and some into the <HI>Western</HI> Seas.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grampian</HI> Mountains here are said to cut thro' <HI>Scotland.</HI> As the Country is rough and uncultivated, the Inhabitants are a hardy Race of Men, who make excellent Soldiers, when they are listed abroad in regular and disciplined Troops; and I must add, that they are much civilized from what they were formerly. These Mountains abound with Flocks of Black Cattle, Sheep, Horses, and Goats. The Beef and Mutton are of a delicious Taste, and the Wool is valued for its Whiteness and Softness.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Athol,</HI> tho' he had not (till of late) an Estate equal to some of the Nobility, yet was Master of more of the Superiorities, as they are called here, than many of those who have twice his Estate; and I have been told, that he can bring a Body of above 6000 Men together in Arms at very little Warning.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="224"/>The Pomp and Grandeur in which this noble Per∣son lives, is not to be imitated in <HI>Great Britain</HI>; for he is served like a Prince, and maintains a greater Equipage and Retinue, than five times his Estate would support in another Country.</P>
<P>The Duke has also another Seat in <HI>Strathern,</HI> which is called <HI>Tullibardin,</HI> and which gives Title of Marquis to the eldest Son of the House of <HI>Athol,</HI> for the Time being. At the lower Part of this Country the River <HI>Ern</HI> falls into the <HI>Tay,</HI> and greatly increases its Waters. This River rises far West, on the Frontiers of the Western <HI>Highlands</HI> near <HI>Glengyl,</HI> and running thro' that pleasant Coun∣try called <HI>Strathern,</HI> falls into <HI>Tay,</HI> below <HI>St. Johnston.</HI></P>
<P>The present Duke is the only Peer that I know of, that is so by Statute, rather than Patent; for his eldest Brother, the Marquis of <HI>Tullibardin,</HI> being attainted for his Adherence to the <HI>Pretender,</HI> the Title would of course have failed; but that (toge∣ther with the Estate) it was settled by Act of Parlia∣ment on the second Brother, who is also Lord of, or King in, the <HI>Isle of Man,</HI> and also Lord <HI>Strange</HI> of <HI>Knocking,</HI> to both which he succeeded by the Death of his Cousin <HI>James</HI> late Earl of <HI>Derby.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after the <HI>Ern</HI> shoots forth from the Moun∣tains, it spreads itself into a <HI>Loch,</HI> as most of those Rivers do, called <HI>Lochern</HI>; and then runs by <HI>Duplin</HI> Castle, the Seat of the Earl of <HI>Kinnoul,</HI> whose eldest Son is thence called Lord <HI>Duplin.</HI> The present Earl of <HI>Kinnoul,</HI> when Lord <HI>Duplin,</HI> mar∣ried the Daughter of the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> when Lord High Treasurer of <HI>England</HI>; and was, on that Occasion, made a Peer of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> by the Title of Lord <HI>Hay</HI> of <HI>Peperdon.</HI> His Estate here is a very good one, but not attended with Vassals and Superiorities, as, I observed, the Duke of <HI>Athol</HI>'s is. The several Owners of this Seat having been pretty
<PB N="224" REF="225"/>
much used to reside in it, have adorned it at several times, each according to his particular Genius. It has lately received a new Decoration, two Wings being added for Offices as well as Ornament.</P>
<P>The old Building is spacious, the Rooms large, and Ceilings lofty, filled with Furniture suitable to its outward Magnificence, particularly with abun∣dance of fine Paintings, some of the Royal Family, among which is one of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. with a Let∣ter in his Hand, held out to his Son the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> afterwards King <HI>James</HI> VII. which they said he was to have carried to <HI>France.</HI> There is also a Statue in Brass of the same King on Horse-back; a Picture of <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI>; another of Gene∣ral <HI>Monk,</HI> both from the Life. There is also a whole Length of that Earl of <HI>Kinnoul,</HI> who was Lord Chancellor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> VI. and King <HI>Charles</HI> I. with several other Pieces of <HI>Italian</HI> Masters of great Value.</P>
<P><HI>Duplin</HI> Castle is remarkable also for the greatest Defeat the <HI>Scots</HI> ever received from the <HI>English,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward Baliol,</HI> whom the <HI>English</HI> came to assist. In this Battle fourscore of the Family of <HI>Lindsay</HI> perished, and of the Family of <HI>Hay</HI> so many, that the Name had been extinguished, had not the Chief left his Lady with Child.</P>
<P>From this Place we went to <HI>Brechin</HI> in <HI>Angus,</HI> formerly mentioned, an antient Town with a Castle finely situated; but the Grandeur of it is lost; the Family of <HI>Panmure,</HI> to whom it belonged chiefly, having forfeited it in the late Rebellion.</P>
<P>Here I shall mention the Cataract near <HI>Blair Drum∣mond</HI> on the <HI>Keith,</HI> which empties itself into the <HI>Tay,</HI> which makes so great a Noise among the Rocks, that it stuns those who come near it.</P>
<P>We were now, after a long Mountain-ramble, come down to the <HI>Lowlands,</HI> and into a pleasant and agreeable Country; but as we had yet another
<PB N="225" REF="226"/>
Journey to take Westward, we had a like Prospect of a rude and wild Part of <HI>Scotland</HI> to go thro'.</P>
<P>The <HI>Highlands</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> may be divided into two Parts, the West <HI>Highlands</HI> and the North <HI>High∣lands</HI>; the latter I have spoken of at large, contain∣ing the Countries of <HI>Athol, Lochaber, Badenach, Strathspey, Innerness, Ross, Sutherland,</HI> and <HI>Strath∣navern,</HI> together with the Isles of <HI>Skye, Lewis,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The West <HI>Highlands</HI> contain the Shires or Coun∣ties of <HI>Dunbritton</HI> or <HI>Dunbarton,</HI> alias <HI>Lenox, Bute,</HI> and <HI>Argyll,</HI> which last contains the Districts of <HI>Cowal, Knapdale, Lorn</HI> and <HI>Cantyre</HI>; the Isles of <HI>Mull, Jura, Isla,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Braidalbin</HI> is sometimes reckoned a Part of the North, and sometimes of the West <HI>Highlands.</HI></P>
<P>On the Banks of the River <HI>Ern</HI> lies a very plea∣sant Vale, which continues from the <HI>Tay,</HI> quite up to the <HI>Highlands,</HI> called by <HI>Claudian, Glacialis Ierne</HI>; but now, according to the Usage of <HI>Scotland, Strath∣ern,</HI> or the Vale of <HI>Ern.</HI> 'Tis an agreeable Country, has many Gentlemens Seats on both Sides the River; but being near the <HI>Highlands,</HI> has often suffered by Depredations in former Times.</P>
<P>In it are many <HI>Roman</HI> Camps; particularly one at <HI>Ardoch</HI>; besides a <HI>Roman</HI> Highway, towards <HI>Perth.</HI> Several <HI>Roman</HI> Medals have also been found there, and of late two <HI>Tabulae</HI> curiously enamelled with a Sepulchral Stone. The <HI>Ochil-hills,</HI> which run along the South Parts of <HI>Perthshire,</HI> abound with Metals and Minerals; particularly they find good Copper, and <HI>Lapis Calaminaris</HI>; and at <HI>Glen-lion</HI> they meet with Lead. Here is great Want of Coal; but their excellent Peat, and abundance of Wood, supply that Defect.</P>
<P>The Family of <HI>Montrose,</HI> whose Chief was sacri∣ficed for the Royal Cause in the late Civil Broils, had a strong Castle here called <HI>Kincardin,</HI> which was demolished in those Wars, and is not rebuilt. The
<PB N="226" REF="227"/>
Castle of <HI>Drummond</HI> is almost in the same Condition, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng deserted by its Owners; the two late Earls of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>th,</HI> Father and Grandfather of the present Earl, were forced into Exile for adhering to the late King <HI>James</HI> II. and the <HI>Pretender.</HI> King <HI>James</HI> had the latter in such Esteem, that he not only made him a Duke, and Knight of the Garter, but Governor to the <HI>Chevalier.</HI></P>
<P>The Western <HI>Highlands,</HI> properly so called, are the only remaining Part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which as yet I have not touched upon. This is that particular Country, which a certain Man in King <HI>James</HI> II.'s Time called the Kingdom of <HI>Argyll,</HI> complimenting King <HI>James</HI> upon having conquered two Kings, when he suppressed the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> whom in Derision they called the little King of <HI>Lime,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Argyll,</HI> whom they called, with much more Propriety, the great King of the <HI>Highlands.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' the greatest Part of these Western <HI>High∣lands</HI> may be said to be subject to the House of <HI>Argyll,</HI> or, to speak more properly, to the Family or Clan of the <HI>Campbells,</HI> of whom the Duke of <HI>Argyll</HI> is the Chief, yet some of the Western Gen∣tlemen are not so blindly guided by their Chiefs as those in the North; nor, when led on, are they so apt to commit Outrages and Violence.</P>
<P>But tho' the People are different in these Western and Northern <HI>Highlands,</HI> the Countries are much alike; only in the former there are not such extensive Woods of Fir-trees, nor such Quantities of large Eagles.</P>
<P>The People also dress alike in both, in the <HI>Plaid</HI> and the <HI>Trouse</HI>; go naked from below the Knee to the Mid-thighs; wear a Durk and a Pistol at their Girdle, and a Target at their Shoulder.</P>
<P>Some reckon the Shire of <HI>Braidalbin</HI> to belong, as I have said, to these Western <HI>Highlands</HI>; not that it is West in its Situation, for it is rather North; but,
<PB N="227" REF="228"/>
I suppose, because one Part of it is inhabited by the <HI>Campbells,</HI> whose Clan, as I have observed, generally possesses most of the West <HI>Highlands.</HI></P>
<P>But if they claim the Country, they will have no Reason to boast of the People, who are, if I may give my Opinion, some of the most barbarous and ill-governed of all the <HI>Highlands</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI>; desperate in Fight, fierce in Conversation, apt to quarrel, mischievous, and even Murderers in their Passion.</P>
<P>At the Fight which happened at <HI>Gillekranky</HI> in <HI>Athol,</HI> against the Viscount of <HI>Dundee,</HI> they tell us a Story of a Combat between an <HI>English</HI> Soldier and a <HI>Highlander.</HI> The <HI>Englishman</HI> understood the Back-sword very well, but the <HI>Scotchman</HI> re∣ceived all the Blows upon his Target; and yet at the same time laid so hard at his Antagonist with his Broad-sword, that he cut him in two or three Places; at which the <HI>Englishman</HI> enraged, rather than dis∣couraged, cried out to him, <HI>You Dog, come out from behind the Door, and fight like a Man</HI>; but the <HI>Scot,</HI> tho' as brave as the other, knew better things; he pursued him, in short, so closely, that he was just going to kill him, when some of the Regi∣ment, that saw him distressed, came up and rescued him, and took the <HI>Highlander</HI> Prisoner.</P>
<P>It is hard to say whether the Northern or Western <HI>Highlanders</HI> make the best Soldiers. 'Tis certain they both of them are defrauded of an Honour due to them, when we attribute several gallant Atchieve∣ments to the <HI>Irish</HI> Battalions Abroad, which were performed by the <HI>Scots.</HI> Thus in particular 'tis said, the <HI>Irish</HI> Troops beat the <HI>Germans</HI> out of <HI>Cremona,</HI> after they had got Possession of the Town, and had taken the <HI>French</HI> General, the Marshal <HI>Viller<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> Prisoner: That the <HI>Irish</HI> Battalions in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Service behaved gallantly in <HI>Sicily,</HI> and so on many extraordinary Occasions. Now tho' it is true, that
<PB N="228" REF="229"/>
the <HI>Scots</HI> came originally from <HI>Ireland,</HI> yet 'tis to be observed, that these Soldiers were most of them <HI>Scots Highlanders,</HI> who, upon all Occasions get over into <HI>France,</HI> there list among the <HI>Irish</HI> Troops; nay, in the late Wars, it has been observed, whole Regiments of <HI>Highlanders</HI> have been raised for the Service, who, when they were got Abroad, would take the first Opportunity to desert, and go over to the <HI>French,</HI> and so list in the <HI>Irish</HI> Battalions, their original Countrymen, and who still speak the same Language.</P>
<P>Leaving the Country about <HI>Brechin,</HI> and the <HI>Lowlands</HI> of <HI>Strathern,</HI> we went away West; but were presently interrupted by a vast inland Sea, ra∣ther than a Lake, called <HI>Lochlomond.</HI> It is indeed a Sea, and look'd like it from the Hills from whence we first descry'd it. It contains thirty Islands, three of which have Churches, and several of the rest are inhabited. The chief is <HI>Inchmurin,</HI> about two Miles and a half in Length, fruitful in Corn and Grass, and abounds with Deer, which the <HI>Scotish</HI> Kings were accustomed to hunt there. The others most remarkable are <HI>Nachastel,</HI> so called from the old Castle in it. <HI>Inchdavanan,</HI> noted for Broom, abundance of wild Berries, pleasant Habitations, Gardens and Fruit-trees. <HI>Inchonnaugan,</HI> noted for Birch-trees and Corn-fields. <HI>Inchnolaig,</HI> noted for Yew-trees, which grow no-where else in these Islands. And <HI>Rouglash,</HI> where the Laird of <HI>Macfarlan</HI> has a handsome Seat on the East-side of the Lake. <HI>Kil∣maronoch,</HI> a fine Seat once belonging to the Earls of <HI>Cassils</HI>; but now to the Earl of <HI>Dondonald. Bucha∣nan-castle,</HI> and several others.</P>
<P>This Lake or Loch is one of the largest in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> being more than 20 Miles long, and generally eight Miles in Breadth, tho' at the North End of it 'tis not near so broad. It receives many Rivers
<PB N="229" REF="230"/>
into it, but empties itself into the Firth of <HI>Clyde,</HI> at one Mouth.</P>
<P>This Lake abounds with Fish of several Sorts, particularly a Sort called <HI>Poans,</HI> and by some <HI>Pol∣lacks,</HI> peculiar to it; a Kind of Eel, very delicious to eat. This gave Occasion to the Mistake of Au∣thors, who said this Lake had Fish without Fins. So the Beams fastened together in some Places of the Lake, by the Inhabitants, and covered with Turf, for them to have recourse to in time of War, and to move from Part to Part, gave Rise to the Fable of floating Islands here.</P>
<P>The famous <HI>Grampian</HI> Mountains begin near this Lake, and run Northward towards <HI>Aberdeen.</HI></P>
<P>The County of <HI>Lenox,</HI> on which this Lake lies, is in Length about 24 Miles, and in Breadth about twenty. The lower Part is very fertile in Corn; the higher is hilly, moorish, and more fit for Pasture. It is the paternal Estate and Property of the <HI>Stuarts,</HI> and extends itself from both Sides the <HI>Levin,</HI> which is the River that (as I said before) empties the <HI>Loch∣lomond</HI> into the <HI>Clyde.</HI> On this Side, Eastward, <HI>Lenox</HI> joins to <HI>Monteith,</HI> which is Part of <HI>Perthshire,</HI> and runs up for some Length on the East-side of the <HI>Loch,</HI> and on the West-side it extends to the Edge of the <HI>Lochloing,</HI> and a great way North, almost to the Mountains of <HI>Lochaber.</HI></P>
<P>All our Writers of the Description of <HI>Lenox</HI> in∣large upon its Family of <HI>Stuarts,</HI> as proceeding from the Royal Line of <HI>Scotland</HI>; and, in some re∣spect, the Royal Line may be said to proceed from this House, <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Darnley,</HI> eldest Son of <HI>Matthew</HI> Earl of <HI>Lenox,</HI> having been married to Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> by whom he was Father of King <HI>James</HI> the Sixth and First. He was most barbarously murdered; the Queen was unjustly blamed for it; whereas <HI>Murray</HI> projected it, <HI>Bothwell</HI> put it in Execution, <HI>Morton</HI> and others were privy to it; as
<PB N="230" REF="231"/>
the said Earl <HI>Morton,</HI> and others who suffered for it, declared at the last.</P>
<P>From this Earl <HI>Matthew</HI> descended <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> and <HI>Richmond,</HI> who dying without Issue, in 1672. the Estate and Honour devolved to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. as Heir at Law, which he conferred on his natural Son by the Duchess of <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and to whom he gave the Surname of <HI>Lenox</HI>; from whom is descended the present Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> and <HI>Lenox.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Buchanans,</HI> among many illustrious Names, are originally of this County, whence the famous <HI>George Buchanan,</HI> one of the great Ornaments of his Age for all polite Learning, and not hitherto equalled by any Poet or Historian since his Time, for smooth and elegant <HI>Latin.</HI> But his excessive Bias for the Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> and his inveterate Prejudice against the unfortunate Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> has quite lost him the Title of Impartiality; insomuch, that his History of <HI>Scotland</HI> was condemned by Act of Parliament, when first published, <HI>Anno</HI> 1582. Whence Sir <HI>George Mackenzie</HI> took Occasion to say, He was both <HI>Decus &amp; Dedecus Patriae,</HI> the <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Disgrace</HI> of his <HI>Country.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dunbarton</HI> is the County Town of <HI>Lenoxshire.</HI> It was once considerable for its Trade, which is now much decay'd; but is still remarkable for its Castle, one of the strongest by Nature in <HI>Europe</HI>; being secured by the River on one Side, the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Clyde</HI> on the other, by an impassable Morass on the third, and the fourth is a Precipice: Of this Castle the Earl of <HI>Hay</HI> is Governor.</P>
<P>Take <HI>Buchanan</HI>'s Description of it, to the follow∣ing Effect: Betwixt the Conflux of <HI>Clyde</HI> and <HI>Leven</HI> is a Plain about a Mile long, at the End of which, where the Rivers join, is a Rock with two Sum∣mits; on the Westermost is a Watch-tower, afford∣ing an extended Prospect into the neighbouring
<PB N="231" REF="232"/>
Country. The Eastern Summit is lower; and be∣twixt them are Steps cut out of the Rock, passable only by one Man at a time. When any Part is cut or falls off from the Rock, it emits a sulphureous Smell. At the upper Part of the Castle is a great Rock of Loadstone. The Rock is very steep on all Sides but towards the <HI>Clyde,</HI> where the Ascent is more easy; and betwixt the two Rocks is a Space of Ground inclosed by Art and Nature, which contains many Houses, makes a safe Harbour for Ships, under Protection of the Castle, and opens a Passage for Boats to the very Gate. On the Ascent in the Middle are Houses which look like another Castle, separated from the former. The same serves for a Ditch on the West, and the <HI>Clyde</HI> on the South; and the Tide comes up to the East-side; and on the North, where the Rock is steep, is a green Plain. Three Wells are in the Castle always flowing with Water, besides many Springs; so that it may well be deemed impregnable. The Town lies about half a Mile from it, on the Bank of the <HI>Levin.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Wall, which begins at <HI>Abercorn,</HI> runs thro' this County, and ends at <HI>Kilpatrick</HI> on <HI>Clyde,</HI> a Regality of the Lord <HI>Blantyre</HI>'s.</P>
<P>We now entered the large extended Country of <HI>Argyll,</HI> or the Western Islands, commonly called, <HI>the Shire of Innerary,</HI> from the principal Town, where the Duke of <HI>Argyll</HI> has his Residence. It comprehends, as I have said, <HI>Argyllshire, Knapdale, Caval, Kintyre,</HI> and <HI>Lorn,</HI> with the Western Isles of <HI>Coll, Illcollimkil, Isla, Jura, Lismore, Mull, Te∣reff,</HI> and <HI>Wyst.</HI> It is 120 Miles long, and 40 broad. It joins to <HI>Perthshire</HI> on the East, to <HI>Lochaber</HI> on the North-east, to the Isles on the North-west, and to the <HI>Irish</HI> Sea on the South.</P>
<P><HI>Kintyre</HI> is a Peninsula, which runs 30 Miles out into the <HI>Irish</HI> Sea, and is no more than 13, some say 16 Miles from <HI>Ireland. Campbel-town,</HI> made a
<PB N="232" REF="233"/>
Royal Burgh by King <HI>William,</HI> with a safe Har∣bour for Ships, lies in this County. <HI>Camden</HI> says, the People of this Part, formerly made Excursions into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and possessed themselves of the Pro∣vinces of <HI>Gline</HI> and <HI>Rowle.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Knapdale</HI> joins to <HI>Kintyre</HI> on the North by a narrow Neck of Land, scarce a Mile over, thro' which the People of the Country draw their small Vessels, to avoid sailing round to <HI>Kintyre.</HI> It abounds with Lakes and Bays, several of which contain Islands and Castles; and the Soil is generally fitter for Pasturage than Cultivation; yet it produces Corn in great Plenty.</P>
<P><HI>Lorn</HI> is the pleasantest and most fruitful Part of the Shire of <HI>Argyll.</HI> The Castle of <HI>Dunstafage</HI> stands in this County, formerly a Royal Seat, where several of the antient Kings are buried. The Family of <HI>Campbell</HI> was made Earls by King <HI>James</HI> II. of <HI>Scot∣land.</HI> They were a long time Lords Justices Gene∣ral of the Kingdom; but surrendered that Office to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. on a valuable Equivalent, besides having the Jurisdiction of <HI>Argyll</HI> and the Isles, and are still Great Masters of the King's Houshold in <HI>Scotland.</HI> They derive their Surname from the Castle of <HI>Campbell,</HI> and according to <HI>Camden,</HI> their Pedigree from the antient Kings of <HI>Argyll,</HI> by a long Series of Ancestors. The Earl of <HI>Loudon,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Braidalbin,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Isla,</HI> and other great Men, are of this Family.</P>
<P>The whole Shire of <HI>Argyll,</HI> taking in the above Parts, has seven Bays of the Sea entering into it, called, by the Inhabitants, <HI>Lochs</HI>; the chief is <HI>Lochfyn,</HI> famous for the Number and Goodness of its Herrings; it is said to be about 40 Miles in Length, and at the narrowest Place about four in Breadth. <HI>Lochew,</HI> according to Bishop <HI>Lesly,</HI> is almost as large as <HI>Lochlomond,</HI> and contains twelve Islands, in one of which is the Castle of <HI>Enconel,</HI> in another
<PB N="233" REF="234"/>
that of <HI>Gleurquhart,</HI> and where it enters the Sea, abounds with Salmon. The Sea-coast of <HI>Argyll,</HI> or as far as <HI>Lochfyn,</HI> abounds with high Rocks, and black Mountains covered with Heath, which afford Pasturage for Black Cattle and Deer. The Black Cattle run for the most part wild, but are excellent Meat; and their Fat, when boiled, does not congeal, as others, but continues for some Days like Oil. The Inhabitants make great Profit of them by selling them to the <HI>Lowlanders.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Argyll</HI> is hereditary Sheriff of this County. 'Tis an old Right of this Family, that when they marry any Daughter, their Vassals are obliged to pay their Portion, and are taxed in order to it, according to the Number of their Cattle.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Mull</HI> of <HI>Cantyre</HI> you see <HI>Ireland</HI> very plain, it being not above 15 or 16 Miles from the Point of Land, which they call the <HI>Mull,</HI> to the Fair <HI>Foreland,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Colrain,</HI> on the North of <HI>Ireland.</HI> In the Mouth of this Sea of <HI>Clyde</HI> lies a Rock, somewhat like the <HI>Bass</HI> in the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Forth,</HI> or of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> not for Shape, but for this Particular, that at the <HI>Bass</HI> the <HI>Solan</HI> Geese are noted to come in the Season of the Fishery, and then fly back again. This Island is called the <HI>Ailzey.</HI></P>
<P>I shall here mention the Isles of <HI>Bute</HI> and <HI>Arran. Buchanan</HI> says, that of <HI>Bute</HI> is eight Miles long, and four broad; Bishop <HI>Lesly,</HI> that it is 10 Miles long. It is fruitful in Corn and Pasturage. It has a Royal Burgh called <HI>Rothsay,</HI> with an antient Castle. From this the Royal Family of <HI>Stuart</HI> is supposed to derive their Origin: And Duke of <HI>Rothsay</HI> is now one of the Titles of the Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> It has another Castle called the Castle of <HI>Kermes,</HI> and four Churches. This Island lies in the Mouth of the <HI>Clyde,</HI> eight Miles West from <HI>Arran,</HI> and is re∣markable for its Herring-fishing. The Isle of <HI>Bute</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="235"/>
gives Title of Earl to a Branch of the noble Family of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who is the chief Proprietor, and he∣retable Coroner of the Island, and has a Seat at <HI>Rosa</HI>; as <HI>Callartine</HI> has at <HI>Kermes,</HI> and <HI>Stuart</HI> of <HI>Ascog</HI> another. Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> before she married Lord <HI>Darnley,</HI> conferred upon him the Title of Duke of <HI>Rothsay.</HI> Near <HI>Bute</HI> are two small Islands, called <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Little Cumbrays,</HI> the Property of the Earl of <HI>Glasgow.</HI></P>
<P>The Isle of <HI>Arran,</HI> which with <HI>Bute</HI> make up one Sheriffdom, lies also in the Mouth of the <HI>Clyde,</HI> 24 Miles in Length, and near 16 broad, fruitful in Corn and Pasturage. It is very well inhabited on the Coast, and is a safe and good Harbour, covered by <HI>Lamlash</HI> or the <HI>Holy Isle.</HI> It has two Churches, and several Castles, of which that of <HI>Brodich</HI> is the strongest and most noted, and is the Residence of the <HI>Hamilton</HI> Family when in these Parts, who also have a Forest here containing about 400 Head of Deer; and the Island gives Title of Earl to the Duke of that Name. The Island has several Rivers in it, which abound with Salmon, as the Sea about it does with Herrings, Cod and Whitings.</P>
<P>The People are Protestants, speak the <HI>Irish</HI> Language, and are still composed of several Tribes or Clans. The most ancient are <HI>Mac-Lewis,</HI> of <HI>French</HI> Extraction, in <HI>English</HI> named <HI>Fullerton,</HI> and Lairds of <HI>Kirk-Michael,</HI> where they reside.</P>
<P>These two Islands are surrounded with a tumultous and dangerous Sea, especially in a hard South-west Wind, which brings the Sea rolling in upon them in a frightful manner. But the above Harbour of <HI>Lamlash</HI> stands them in great stead in this Case.</P>
<P>Now we are upon these Western Coasts, I shall mention, that in the Month of <HI>August</HI> 1740. an Attempt was made by Diving, to come at one of the largest Ships of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Armada, stranded in 1588. on these Coasts. Another was dived for some
<PB N="235" REF="236"/>
Years ago; but the Sand being loose, it turned to little or no Account. The other, which was lost near <HI>Portin-cross,</HI> was begun to be searched after by Sir <HI>Archibald Grant,</HI> and Captain <HI>Roe,</HI> in <HI>August</HI> 1740. and the following was the Account that was transmit∣ted to us, which we the rather insert, as it gives some Notion of the Operation by the Diving-engine.</P>
<P>The Country People had preserved by Tradition the Spot pretty near where she sunk, and gave them all the Information they were able: Immediately the Divers went to Work, and swept for her, which they do thus: They have a long Line, which they sink with Leads; one End of the Rope is fixed to one Boat, and the other End to another; they row; and whatever interrupts them, the Diver goes down to make a Discovery. They soon happened on the Place where the Ship lay, which is scarce a Quarter of a Mile from the Shore, in ten Fathom and a Foot Water. Captain <HI>Roe</HI> immediately went down, and found the Vessel to be very intire, to have a great Number of Guns on board, but to be full of Sand. The first Thing he fixed upon was a Cannon, which lay upon the Sand at the Head of the Ship: To this he fixed his Tongs, which are made of strong Bars of Iron; they are open when they are let down, and have Teeth which join into one another. As soon as they are fixed upon any thing, he gives the Signal, when they are made to shut, and the heavier the Subject, the closer they hold. The Cannon was drawn up with a good deal of Difficulty; it measures full nine Feet, is of Brass, greenish-coloured, but nothing the worse. On the Breach there is a <HI>Rose,</HI> with an <HI>E</HI> on the one Side and an <HI>R</HI> on the other, with this Inscription, <HI>Richard and John Philips, Brethren, made this Piece, Anno</HI> 1584. But we may be allowed to observe, That by the <HI>E. R.</HI> on the Cannon, which denotes <HI>Eliz. Regina,</HI> and the <HI>Rose,</HI> as also the <HI>English</HI> Inscription of the Makers, it should seem
<PB N="236" REF="237"/>
to us, that it could not belong to the Armada; but rather to some <HI>English</HI> Ship, that might have been cast away there. Ten of these Brass Cannon, and ten Iron ones, have been since carried into <HI>Dublin</HI>; and they hope to recover sixty out of this Ship. The Guns were all charged, and the Metal of some, by lying so long under Water, moulders away like Clay.</P>
<P>Several People have scraped the Iron Guns, which are as mouldy as Bricks; and by keeping the Metal some time in their Hands, it grows so hot, that they are not able to bear it; but when it is exposed two or three Hours in open Air, it loses all its burning Quality. This is accounted for in the following Manner; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Tournefort,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Physician, in his <HI>Voyage to the Levant,</HI> Part I. says: It is certain, that the Filings of Iron, steeped in common Water, will grow considerably warm, and much more so in Sea Water. And if you mingle therewith some Sulphur powdered, you will really see this Mixture burn.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> in the last Edition of his <HI>Opticks, Pag.</HI> 354. says: That even the gross Body of Sul∣phur, powdered with an equal Weight of Iron Filings, and a little Water made into a Paste, acts upon the Iron; and in five or six Hours grows too hot to be touched, and emits a Flame.</P>
<P>Now it is certain, that cast Iron contains a great deal of Bitumen or Sulphur in its Composition, and that Iron in its sensible Quality effects Heat, and cannot be perceived without the Admission of Air; which is the Reason why the Scrapings should grow hot, altho' the Guns are actually cold to the Touch.</P>
<P>As I have given Accounts of several publick Cha∣rities, and other laudable Institutions, in the Southern Parts of <HI>Britain,</HI> it would be inexcusable not to mention the Society in <HI>Scotland</HI> for propagating Christian Knowledge in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> it being one of the worthiest Designs of the present Age; and as
<PB N="237" REF="238"/>
we shall include in it also a Description of the said <HI>Highlands,</HI> and of the <HI>Scots</HI> Islands besides; we cannot insert it in a more proper Place. It is comprehended in a Letter written <HI>June</HI> 1739. from a Gentleman who is a great Encourager of this noble Institution, to his Friend; and is as follows: <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"The Extent of the <HI>Highlands</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> is much greater than has commonly been imagined: From the <HI>Mull</HI> of <HI>Kintyre</HI> to <HI>Farohead</HI> in <HI>Strath∣navern,</HI> is more than 200 Miles in a strait Line from South to North; and from <HI>Farohead</HI> to <HI>John a Grot</HI>'s House, is above 60 Miles along the North and Northern Coast of the Continent: Be∣sides, there is a vast Number of inhabited Islands, of which some are both large and populous: For instance, <HI>Jura</HI> is 24 Miles long; <HI>Isla,</HI> 16; <HI>Mull,</HI> 24; <HI>Skye,</HI> 48; <HI>Long-Island,</HI> comprehending <HI>Bara, Southuist, Northuist,</HI> and <HI>Lewes,</HI> 100; and many others, from two to 12 Miles in Length. The Isles of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Zetland</HI> are to be considered by themselves; for to <HI>Orkney</HI> alone belong thirty-three inhabited Islands, one of which is 24 Miles, and another 12, in Length. In <HI>Zetland</HI> there are about 30 inhabited Islands, some of which are six, others seven Miles long. Many of these Islands lie at considerable Distances from the Con∣tinent, and from one another, and are in Extent about one half of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>"In this large Track of Country, Ignorance and Superstition greatly prevail: In some Places, the Remains even of Paganism are still to be found; and in many others, the Reformation from Po∣pery has never yet obtained. The Parishes where Ministers are settled, are commonly of very great Extent, some 30, 40, 50 Miles long, and ge∣nerally divided by impassable Mountains and Lakes; so that most of the Inhabitants, being
<PB N="238" REF="239"/>
destitute of all Means of Knowledge, and with∣out any Schools to educate their Children, are intirely ignorant of the Principles of Religion and Virtue, live in Idleness and Poverty, have no Notion of Industry, or Sense of Liberty; are subject to the Command of their Popish disaffected Chieftains, who have always opposed the propa∣gating Christian Knowledge, and the <HI>English</HI> Tongue, that they might with less Difficulty keep their miserable Vassals in a slavish Dependence. The poorer Sort have only the <HI>Irish</HI> Tongue, and little Correspondence with the civilized Parts of the Nation, and only come among them to pillage the more industrious Inhabitants: They are brought up in Principles of Tyranny and Arbitrary Government, depend upon foreign Papists as their main Support, and the native <HI>Irish</HI> as their best Correspondents and Allies. This has been the Source of all the Rebellions and Insurrections in that Country since the Revolution.</P>
<P>"On the other hand, they are naturally of a quick Genius, of great bodily Strength, inured to Hardship. Their Country is commodiously situated for the noblest Fishery in the World, of which our Neighbours have made immense Profit. They have Mines and Woods, and great Quan∣tity of Black Cattle, and vast Tracks of im∣proveable Land, which lie waste for want of Industry in the People, and not considering the Advantage of their Situation. They are a nu∣merous and prolifick People; and, if reformed in their Principles and Manners, and usefully em∣ployed, might be made a considerable Accession of Power and Wealth to <HI>Great Britain.</HI> Some Clans of <HI>Highlanders,</HI> well instructed in the Arts of War, and well affected to the Government, would make as a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e and formidable a Body for their

Country's Defence, as <HI>Great Britain,</HI> or <HI>Swit∣zerland,</HI> or any Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> are able to produce.</P>
<P>"In the Year 1701, some Gentlemen of <HI>Edin∣burgh</HI> first considered of proper Methods for civilizing and reforming them; and agreed, that the setting up of Schools in different and con∣venient Places, for the instructing of their Youth in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue, and Principles of the Christian Religion, and disposing them to Virtue and Industry, would be the most likely and effectual Means. They joined in a voluntary Subscription among themselves, and engaged as many others in it as they could, which laid the first Foundation of this great and publick Design. They soon found the Work too heavy a Burden for a few private Hands, and made Application to her late Majesty Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> who was graciously pleased to approve and recommend the same by her Royal Proclamation, in the Year 1708: and in 1709. granted her Letters Patent, constituting and appointing a certain Number of the Sub∣scribers to be a Society, or Body Politick, by the Name of, <HI>The Society in</HI> Scotland <HI>for propagating Christian Knowledge in the Highlands, and Islands, &amp;c.</HI> with full Powers to receive Donations of Money, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to purchase Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> not ex∣ceeding 2000<HI>l.</HI> a Year; and with the Profits and yearly Interest of the same to erect and maintain Schools, with many other Privileges and Regula∣tions. The Lords of Session, or Judges in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> according to her Majesty's Commission, nominated 82 Subscribers to be the first Members of the Society, all of them Persons of the best and most distinguished Characters; who at their first General Meeting chose a President, a Trea∣surer, a Secretary, and other Officers. They also chose a Committee of Fifteen, who meet every
<PB N="240" REF="241"/>
Month, or oftener, as they have Occasion. There is a General Meeting of the whole Society every three Months, when they assume new Members, make general Regulations, give Orders to the Committee, and receive their Accounts. All Proceedings, both of the Committee, and of the General Meeting, are recorded in distinct Books, which are always open to the Examination of every Contributor. The Names of the Con∣tributors are kept in a distinct Register with an Account of the several Benefactions.</P>
<P>"In the Year 1710. they began to settle Schools in such Places as had never been reformed from Heathenism: And their capital Stock having yearly increased by the liberal Contributions of many Persons of all Ranks in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and amounting to above 10000<HI>l.</HI> most of which is laid out upon good Security, they have increased their Schools in Proportion. Their Number at present is about 100, where above 4000 are taught <HI>gratis,</HI> to read, write, Arithmetick, and Psalmody. Many of the poorer Scholars have a weekly Al∣lowance for their Maintenance, and Cloaths and Books provided for them. Great Care is taken, that the School-masters are Men of Probity, Ca∣pacity, and well affected to the Government; and they are obliged, besides the teaching the Children in the Schools, to instruct those in the Principles of Religion who are too old to come to School, and at too great a Distance from the Parish Church. Many Popish Parents have at length permitted their Children to be instructed.</P>
<P>"This Society has appointed Persons of Cha∣racter and Consideration to be Visitors of their Schools, and to examine the Conduct and Dili∣gence of the School-masters, and the Proficiency of the Scholars, and to transmit Accounts to them at <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> All possible Care is taken to
<PB N="241" REF="242"/>
manage the Money to the best Advantage, not a Farthing being diverted to any other Purpose; and all the principal Officers of the Society serve <HI>gratis.</HI> The Success of the Undertaking has answered all the Pains and Expence of the Society: There appears a great Disposition in the rising Generation to be instructed; many have learned to read the Scriptures, and attend Divine Service in <HI>English,</HI> where formerly the <HI>Irish</HI> Tongue was only understood. Several of the Scholars are ca∣pable of assisting the Masters; and some of them of being Masters of the Society's Schools. Many of them have attained to such Degrees of Know∣ledge, as to be admitted to the Celebration of the Lord's Supper. The Face of Reformation and Virtue begins to appear every-where; and there is Reason to apprehend, that in a few Years, Ig∣norance, Popery, and the <HI>Irish</HI> Language, will be utterly extirpated; and in their stead, Virtue, Loyalty, and Industry, will take Place.</P>
<P>"Nevertheless, the present Fund is far from be∣ing sufficient to the Vastness of the Design, as appears from the Report of the Commissioners, appointed by his late Majesty King <HI>George, Anno</HI> 1716, to inquire into the State of the <HI>Highlands</HI> and Islands of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in pursuance of an Act of Parliament of the preceding Session, who gave it as their Opinion, That no Method was so likely to reduce these Countries to a State of Peace among themselves, and hearty Subjection to the present Government, as that of establish∣ing Schools among them; and that over and above the present Number, one hundred and fifty more were absolutely necessary to render the Design fully effectual.</P>
<P>"This Report had so good an Effect, that it was enacted, (<HI>Anno</HI> 4 <HI>Georgii</HI>) in the Act for vesting the forfeited Estates in Trustees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'That a
<PB N="242" REF="243"/>
Sum not exceeding 20000<HI>l.</HI> shall be appropriated towards making a capital Stock, for a yearly In∣terest or Income, out of the Moneys which shall arise by Sale of the said Estates which are in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> towards erecting and maintaining Schools in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> &amp;c. And in the Act (6 <HI>Georgii</HI>) for laying a Duty on wrought Plate, there is a Pro∣viso, That nothing therein shall invalidate the said Provision for Schools in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> &amp;c. But notwithstanding this charitable Provision of the Legislature, 'tis much to be lamented, that neither that Country, nor this Society, ever reaped any Benefit by it, the Produce of the said Estates having been applied to other Purposes; whereby the reforming and civilizing of that Country is left to depend very much on private Contribution.</P>
<P>"I must not forget to observe, That the Society's Charter extends to Popish and Infidel Countries beyond the Seas, and that four Missionaries are maintained for converting the native <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>America</HI> to the Christian Faith; three of which are stationed on the Frontiers of <HI>New England,</HI> between our Settlements and those of <HI>French Canada,</HI> by which Means the <HI>Indians</HI> in those Parts will more easily be kept in Subjection to our Government. The Charge of these three is in a great measure defrayed out of an Estate left to the Society by a late worthy Clergyman in <HI>England</HI> for that Purpose. The other Missionary is in∣tirely supported at the Society's Charge in the new Colony of <HI>Georgia</HI>; where several of the poorer People are gone to reside.</P>
<P>"And to render this Design more fully a national Benefit, his present Majesty, from an earnest Desire to promote the Good of his Subjects in all Parts of his Dominions, was graciously pleased, in the Year 1738, to grant his Royal additional
<PB N="243" REF="244"/>
Charter, to cause such Children as they should find proper, to be instructed in Husbandry, House∣wifry, and Manufactures. The Society is taking all proper Measures for erecting Working-schools; and have good Encouragement to hope, that the landed Gentlemen in the <HI>Highlands</HI> and Isles will not suffer themselves to be outdone by their Protestant Neighbours in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who took the first Hint from their Design; but will, like them, let out and make Grants of small Parcels of Ground to build their Schools, and for Kitchen-gardens and Agriculture; and for the raising of Hemp and Flax for the Linen Manufacture, which is now so greatly improved in that Country. This is the distinct State of the Case, in all the Cir∣cumstances and Steps of it.</P>
<P>"As this Undertaking is not the Work of a Party or Faction, but the common Cause of Christianity, and an Attempt to civilize vast Numbers of People, near half a Million, and make them useful to Society, who have been in a great measure useless, and in some Circum∣stances very hurtful to it; 'tis apprehended, That the Wealthy and Well-disposed, who have an hearty Zeal for the Honour of God, and the Good of the Souls of Men, a true Love for their Country, and the publick Welfare, or a due Concern for the Protestant Religion, and the pre∣sent happy Establishment, cannot easily find any Instance of Usefulness more likely to turn to Account, or capable of answering more noble and extensive Purposes of Good."</P></Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> SHALL now present you with as brief and accurate an Account as I can give you of the Islands of most considerable Note, lying adjacent, or belonging to this Northern Part of the Island of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> beginning, first, with</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Western Isles of <HI>Scotland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THese Islands lie in the <HI>Deucaledonian</HI> Sea, and were called, by some, <HI>Hebrides.</HI> The most Southern of them is the <HI>Isle of</HI> MAN, which for several Generations has belonged to Families, who have been Homagers to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> for it: Wherefore I shall pass it by with these Re∣marks, That when it became intirely subject to the <HI>English,</HI> it kept a distinct Bishop of its own, whose Successors continued the Title of <HI>Episcopi Sodorenses,</HI> as well as added that of <HI>Mannenses,</HI> as if they had been Bishops of the <HI>Isles</HI> also, whose Cathedral was at <HI>Sodor</HI>; and as many of the Towns therein are called by <HI>Scots</HI> Names, so at present it belongs to a <HI>Scots</HI> Peer, <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Athol,</HI> who lately suc∣ceeded to this Isle, as Heir at Law to his Cousin <HI>James</HI> Earl of <HI>Derby.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="255"/>The Isles of BUTE and ARRAN I have already mentioned.</P>
<P>AILSA, or <HI>Islesay,</HI> in the Mouth of the <HI>Clyde,</HI> is a steep Rock, something resembling the <HI>Bass</HI> in the Mouth of <HI>Forth,</HI> being inaccessible in all Places, but only by one Pass, and not inhabited, except at one time of the Year, when a great Fleet of Vessels come thither to fish for Cod. It abounds with Va∣riety of Sea-fowl, especially <HI>Solan</HI> Geese, and has Multitudes of Rabbets. It belongs to the Earl of <HI>Cassil,</HI> who receives, by the Produce of Hogs, Fowl, Down, and Fish, about 100 Marks <HI>Scots</HI> yearly from hence.</P>
<P>Near the Isle of <HI>Bute</HI> lie two Islands, called CUMBRA, the <HI>Greater</HI> and <HI>Lesser</HI>; the first is about a Mile in length, has a Church in it, and a Well, the Waters of which are reckoned, by the Natives, good against all Diseases: The other Island is less, and both belong to <HI>Montgomery</HI> of <HI>Skelmerly</HI>; the larger is fruitful in Corn, and the smaller abounds with Deer.</P>
<P>Near the Isle of <HI>Arran,</HI> is FLADA, a small Island, which abounds with Rabbets.</P>
<P>South-west from <HI>Bute</HI> lies MERNOCK, about a Mile long, and half a Mile broad, fruitful in Corn.</P>
<P>About a Mile from the Promontory of <HI>Kintyre</HI> lies AVONA, which signifies, <HI>a good Harbour.</HI> The <HI>Danes</HI> came hither with their Fleets, when they were Masters of the Isles.</P>
<P>The next remarkable Island is GIGAIA, four Miles from <HI>Kintyre,</HI> six Miles in Length, and a Mile and a half in Breadth. The Inhabitants are Protestants. There is a Church in this Island, and a Sepulchre for the <HI>Macneils,</HI> the Proprietors of it. <HI>Corkir,</HI> which dyes a Crimson Colour, and <HI>Crostil,</HI> which dyes a Philamote, grow upon the Stones here. The Soil is good for Pasture and Arable. They have also a Medicinal Well, which they esteem a Catholicon.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="256"/>A Quarter of a Mile South lies CARY, about a Mile in Compass, has good Pasturage, and abounds with Rabbets. It belongs to the Family of <HI>Mac∣alister.</HI></P>
<P>JURA lies twelve Miles from <HI>Gigaia,</HI> is 20 Miles long, and six or seven broad; it belongs to the Duke of <HI>Argyll,</HI> and makes Part of the Shire of that Name. This is very barren, but reckoned one of the whol∣somest Places in <HI>Scotland:</HI> Here Women seldom die in Child-bed; and one <HI>Macrain</HI> died in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. who had been 180 <HI>Christmas's</HI> in one House. It abounds with many Deer, has good Pasturage for other Cattle, has many good Springs, and one against Nauseousness of the Stomach and Stone. Here are two very high Mountains, called <HI>The Paps of</HI> JURA; which are noted Sea-marks for a very great Way. From <HI>March</HI> to <HI>September</HI> the Air is perfectly pure. There are very good Salmon in the Rivers of this Island. They have one Church here, called <HI>Killearn.</HI> The Inhabitants, who speak <HI>Irish,</HI> and wear the Plaid and Bonnet, are Pro∣testants.</P>
<P>Two Miles from <HI>Jura</HI> lies SCARBA, four Miles long, and one broad; noted for its extraordinary Tides, and the Longevity of its Inhabitants; one of whom, a Woman, lived 140 Years.</P>
<P>Near to these lie many Islands of less Note, which I have not room to name. LISMORE, or <HI>Lessimore,</HI> the Seat of the Bishop of <HI>Argyll,</HI> who from thence was called <HI>Episcopus Lismorensis,</HI> is about eight Miles long, and two broad, and lies Eastward from <HI>Mull</HI> in the Mouth of <HI>Lock-yol,</HI> which goes up to <HI>Inner∣lochy</HI> in <HI>Lochaber.</HI></P>
<P>BERNERA, formerly a Sanctuary in Popish Times, has a noble Wood of Yew. In this Isle, which is five Miles in Circumference, and lies about two Leagues to the South of <HI>Harries,</HI> were, as Mr. <HI>To∣land</HI> relates, two Ravens, which beat off all Birds
<PB N="256" REF="257"/>
of Prey; and when their Young are able to fly abroad, they expel them also out of the Island; but not without many Blows, and a great Noise. In this Island, moreover, there is a fresh-water Lake, called <HI>Lochbruist,</HI> where many Land and Sea∣fowl build. There were, according to the same Au∣thor, a couple of Ravens like the former in a small Isle near <HI>North-Vist</HI>; as also upon the Isle of <HI>Troda</HI> near <HI>Skye.</HI></P>
<P>South-west from <HI>Jura</HI> lies ILA, 24 Miles long, in some Places eight, and in others sixteen broad; it abounds with Corn and Cattle, has Store of Deer and Lead Mines, with Lime-stone in vast Quantities. It has several Rivers, that abound with Salmon, and other Fish of several Sorts. In the Centre of it lies <HI>Lochfinlagan,</HI> three Miles in Circumference. It abounds with Salmon, Trouts, and Eels, and has an Island in it, where <HI>Macdonald,</HI> King of the Isles, had his Residence, and made it the Seat of his Go∣vernment: The Ruins of whose Court are still to be seen here. There are several fresh-water Lakes in this Island, with Forts upon them. It has also a Medicinal Well, much frequented by the Natives for all Diseases. There are several Caves here, one of them capable of holding 200 Men. The Country is indifferently fruitful. It lies lower than <HI>Jura</HI>; consequently is wetter and less wholsome. The In∣habitants are Protestants. There are four Churches and a Chapel in this Island, the most remarkable of which is St. <HI>Columbus</HI>'s Church. It gives the Title of Earl to a Son of the Family of <HI>Argyll</HI>; but <HI>Campbel</HI> of <HI>Calder</HI> is the chief Proprietor, and also Steward of the Crown here.</P>
<P>There are many small Islands about this, which we cannot mention.</P>
<P>Two Leagues North <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Ila</HI> lies COLONSA, sepa∣rated from <HI>Oransa</HI> only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>de of Flood. It is four Miles in Length, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> broad, not so fruitful
<PB N="257" REF="258"/>
as the other. There is one Church besides two ruinous Chapels in this Isle; some fresh-water Lakes abounding with Trouts; and several Forts. The Proprietor is the Duke of <HI>Argyll,</HI> and the Inhabi∣tants Protestants.</P>
<P>ORANSA is four Miles in Circumference, and fruitful in Corn and Grass: It has also a Church and a Chapel, and had formerly a Monastery dedicated to St. <HI>Columbus.</HI> The Proprietor is <HI>Macduffi.</HI></P>
<P>Farther West lies the small Isle of DOWHIRTA. The Natives have a Tradition that <HI>Pygmies</HI> once lived here. The Duke of <HI>Argyll</HI> is Proprietor.</P>
<P>North-east from <HI>Ila</HI> lies the Isle of MULL, 24 Miles in Length, and near as much in Breadth: It lies in the Shire of <HI>Argyll.</HI> The Air is temperate, cold, and moist, but qualified by fresh Breezes from the Mountains. The Natives, when the Season is moist, take a large Dose of <HI>Aquavitae</HI> for a Cor∣rective, and chew a Piece of Charmel Root when they intend to be merry, to prevent Drukenness. This Island in general affords good Pasturage for Cat∣tle of all Sorts. They have a great many Deer, and abound with Wild-fowl, and very fine Hawks. Their Horses are little, but very sprightly; their Black Cattle excellent Meat. Their Corn is Barley and Oats. It formerly abounded with Wood, but most of it is now cut. The Heaths, besides Pasturage for Cattle, afford good Fuel for the Natives. The Bay of <HI>Duart,</HI> on the West-side, is a good Anchor∣ing-place. Upon this stands the Castle of <HI>Duart,</HI> the Seat of the Head of the antient Family of <HI>Maclean,</HI> who were the chief Proprietors of this Island; but Sir <HI>John Maclean</HI> having forfeited, it is now possessed by the Duke of <HI>Argyll.</HI> There are two other Castles, and several Anchoring-places about this Island. It has several Rivers, which afford Salmon, and abound with black Muscles, which breed Pearl. There are also some fresh-water Lakes in it, which afford
<PB N="258" REF="259"/>
Trout, Eels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Several lesser Isles lie about it, and in its Bays, several of which are very fruitful, and some are impregnable. The Bay called <HI>Lochleffan</HI> abounds with Herring and Shell-fish. The Inha∣bitants of this Isle profess Protestantism, and have two Parish Churches, besides several ruinous Places, formerly used for Devotion. In the Sound or Bay of <HI>Mull,</HI> betwixt this Isle and <HI>Lochaber,</HI> a great Ship called the <HI>Florida,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Spanish Armada,</HI> was lost in the Year 1588. Persons from several Places have often dived for her, and found good Ac∣count in the Guns, and other valuable Effects they have got out of her. I have already mentioned, <HI>Pag.</HI> 235. the further Attempts of this Nature by Captain <HI>Roe.</HI></P>
<P>Near this lies the Island of ST. COLUMBUS, two Miles in Length, and about a Mile broad: It abounds in all Things produced in this Climate, was noted for antient Monuments, and particularly as being the Residence of <HI>St. Columbus,</HI> famous for his Discipline and Sanctity. It had two Monasteries, one for Men, and another for Women, besides several Chapels endowed by the Kings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of the Isles: It is called in the <HI>Irish</HI> Language <HI>I-colm-kil</HI>; some call it <HI>Iona:</HI> It contains now about 30 poor Families. The Bishops of the Isl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> had formerly their Seat here: This Island is famous in History for being a Seminary of Ecclesiasticks, and in a manner the Mother Church of all the Dominions of the <HI>Scot</HI> and <HI>Picts</HI>; and tho' the Abbot was only a Presbyter, yet all the Clergy of the Province, and Bishops themselves, were subject to him, as is mentioned by <HI>Bede.</HI> The Church dedicated to St. <HI>Mary,</HI> is in∣tirely demolished, and overgrown with Grass and Weeds; nor is there any regular Place of Worship in the whole Island. Here the Vicar of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>bee,</HI> as Dean of the <HI>Isles,</HI> used three or four times a Year to catechize and preach to the People. The old Mona∣stery,
<PB N="259" REF="260"/>
or College of Monks, was a Place of great Sanctity and Privilege, of which temporal Privileges the Abbot was Superior, and in many things exempt from the Bishop, being subject only to the Pope, or his Delegates. The Bishops of the <HI>Isles</HI> were called <HI>Episcopi Sodorenses,</HI> from <HI>Sodor,</HI> which is usually said to have been a Village in this Island: But I very much question it; for some Criticks say, it should be <HI>Soterenses,</HI> from the Church dedicated <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to our Saviour, which however seems too learned an Etymology for the Time of building the Church; or from St. <HI>Ouren</HI>'s Church, which, by Corruption, or an easy Transition, might soon dwindle from <HI>San∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urensis</HI> into <HI>Sodorensis.</HI> If this Conjecture be true, then <HI>St. Ouren</HI>'s was the <HI>Cathedral,</HI> and the Church in the Abbey, <HI>Conventual</HI> only.</P>
<P>Six Miles West from this Island lies TYRE-TY, eight Miles long, and three broad; it is reckoned to be the most plentiful of all the Islands in Necessaries of human Life, abounding with Corn, Cattle, Fish, and Fowl. Here is a fresh-water Lake, with an Island and an old Castle in it, and an Harbour for Long-boats, which are used in that Country. It formerly belonged to the Family of <HI>Maclean,</HI> but now to the Duke of <HI>Argyll.</HI> There is one Church in this Island, called <HI>Sorabi,</HI> whereof the Dean of the <HI>Isles</HI> was Minister. The People are Protestants: they are not very healthy, as the Country lies low.</P>
<P>Near this are two Islands, called KERNIBERG, so strong by Nature, that a little Art would make them impregnable.</P>
<P>About half a League to the North-east lies the Island of COLL, ten Miles long, and two broad, and is very fruitful: It has several Rivulets, which afford Salmon, and a fresh-water Lake, that has Trouts and Eels. The Proprietor is a Branch of the Family of <HI>Maclean.</HI> The Inhabitants are Pro∣testants. They have a Notion here, that <HI>Tyre-ty</HI>
<PB N="260" REF="261"/>
breeds more Women than Men, and <HI>Coll</HI> more Men than Women; so that they may people each other without the Assistance of their Neighbours. The Coasts of this Island abound with larger Cod and Ling, than are to be found on the Coasts of the neighbouring Isles and Continent.</P>
<P>North from this lies the Isle of RUM, six Miles long, and four broad: It is mountainous and heathy, but the Coast is arable and fruitful: It is but thinly inhabited, and the Sea Fowl lay their Eggs in such Quantities, that in the Spring any one may gather what Number he pleases. The Rivulets of this Island afford Salmon, and there is plenty of Land and Sea Fowl, especially those called <HI>Puffins:</HI> There are also abundance of Deer in the Mountains. The Proprietor is <HI>Maclean</HI> of <HI>Coll,</HI> and the Inhabitants are Protestants.</P>
<P>Half a Mile from <HI>Rum</HI> lies CANNEY, two Miles long, and one Mile broad, surrounded with an high Rock, but plentiful in Corn and Grass, and the Coasts abound with Cod and Ling. In the North-end there is a Rock of Loadstone, as some think, because it disorders the Needle of the Compass, when any Ships come near it. It has one Church, and good Anchorage on the North-east. The Pro∣prietor is one of the <HI>Macdonalds,</HI> and the Inhabitants Papists.</P>
<P>MUCK lies South-west of <HI>Rum,</HI> is about four Miles in Circumference, fruitful in Corn and Grass, surrounded with Rocks, and noted for good Hawks.</P>
<P>EGG lies not far from <HI>Coll,</HI> is three Miles in Length, and a Mile and a half in Breadth, and the Whole pretty good for Pasturage and Cultiva∣tion. On the South-end of it is a Mountain, and on the Top of that a high Rock, of about 150 Paces in Circumference, with a fresh-water Pool in the Middle of it; there is only one Pass up to it, so that it is a natural Fort. On the South-west Side
<PB N="261" REF="262"/>
of the Isle is a Cave, capable of containing some Hundreds of People, and there are several Medi∣cinal Wells in this Island. The Proprietors are some of the <HI>Macdonalds:</HI> the Inhabitants bigotted Papists.</P>
<P>North from this lies SKYE, 42 Miles long, and in some Places 20, in others 30 Miles broad. It is separated from the Shire of <HI>Inverness,</HI> to which it belongs, by a Firth so narrow, that a Man may easily call from one Side to the other. It is navi∣gable by the largest Ships of War. The Current there is so violent, that no Vessel is able to sail against it, tho' the Wind prove ever so fair, so that the Tide must always be observed. The way of Ferrying Cows in the narrow Ferry, called the <HI>Kyle,</HI> where the Tide is very rapid, is thus: They tie a Withe about the Cow's Lower-jaw, and bind five of them together; after which, a Man in the End of a Boat holds the Withe that ties the foremost, and rows over, carrying in the Space of a few Hours, at Low-water, three or four Hundred Cows. The Country is populous, the People handsome, and very healthy. Almost all the Inhabitants of <HI>Skye</HI> are Protestants. None of them possess any Land. It is very high Ground, as well on the Coast as up in the Country, where there are seven lofty Mountains, which lie near one another, almost in the Centre of the Island. It has a great deal of arable Land, which yields a good Increase; so that they supply the neighbouring Continent with Barley and Oats. It has many excellent Bays and Harbours for the Con∣veniency of Fishing, and other Trade, and about 30 Rivers, which afford Salmon.</P>
<P>ST. COLUMBUS's Lake has an Island and a Chapel in it. Most of the Bays abound with Herrings all the Summer; the Natives dry, and preserve them without Salt for eight Months, without any other Art than taking out their Guts, tying a Rush about
<PB N="262" REF="263"/>
their Necks, and hanging them up by Pairs upon a Rope of Heath across the House. Cod, Ling, Mackrel, Haddock, Whiting, Turbet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> abound on this Coast, as do Oysters, and all other Sorts of Shell-fish. There are many large Caves in this Island, from the Roof of some of which there drops a Water, which petrifies into a white limy Sub∣stance; one of them in <HI>Slate,</HI> called the <HI>Golden Cave,</HI> is said to be seven Miles long. There are abundance of old Forts on the Coast, which seem to have been erected by the <HI>Danes</HI>; they stand on rising Grounds, and so near one another, that by a Beacon fired on any one of them, the Notice of any approaching Danger by Invasion was imme∣diately spread thro' the whole Island. There are also several little Houses of Stone built under Ground, for hiding People and their Goods in time of War; and others above Ground capable only of holding one Person, which seem to have been designed for Con∣templation. There are several of the <HI>Druids</HI> Houses yet intire in the Isle of <HI>Skye,</HI> and in some other Isles. The Vulgar in the Islands still shew a great Respect for these Houses, and never come to the ancient sacri∣ficing Carns, but they walk three times round them from East to West, according to the Course of the Sun. The Cattle here are Horses, Cows, Sheep, Goats, and Hogs; the Cows frequently feed on the Sea-weed, and observe the Tide of Ebb for that End, as exactly as any Man can do. This Island abounds with Land and Water-fowl of many Sorts, and among others they have Hawks and Eagles. It belongs to Sir <HI>Alexander Macdonald,</HI> some of whose Ancestors were called Kings of the <HI>Isles</HI>; the middle Parts belong to <HI>Mackinnon</HI> of that Ilk, and the North-west Parts belong to <HI>Macleod</HI>; all three Chiefs of their several Clans.</P>
<P>SOTA-BRITIL lies a quarter of a Mile South of <HI>Skye,</HI> is five Miles in Circumference, full of Bogs,
<PB N="263" REF="264"/>
and fitter for Pasturage than Cultivation. On the West-side it is covered with Wood. The Coasts of this Island abound with Cod and Ling.</P>
<P>On the North-side of <HI>Skye</HI> lies SCALPA, five Miles in Circumference: It has Wood in several Parts of it, and is fruitful in Corn and Grass.</P>
<P>A little farther North lies RAARSAY, seven Miles long, and three broad; it has much Wood, and is fitter for Pasture than Cultivation. On the East-side of it is a Spring, which runs down from a Rock, and petrifies into a fine white Lime, of which it yields great Quantities. Here is also a Quarry of good Stone. On the West-side are abundance of Caves, where People lodge who go thither in the Summer upon the Account of Fishing, or Grazing of Cattle. There are several Forts in this Island, some of which are naturally very strong. The Proprietor is a Cadet of the Family of <HI>Macleod,</HI> and is as much respected by the Inhabitants, as if he were a Prince.</P>
<P>A Quarter of a Mile farther North lies RONA, three Miles in Length: 'Tis fruitful in Pasturage, and the Rocks about it are of Hectick Stone.</P>
<P>ALSVIG lies on the South-west Corner of <HI>Skye,</HI> is two Miles in Circumference, fruitful in Corn and Grass, and noted for the vast Shoals of Herrings about it, which sometimes entangle the Fishing-boats.</P>
<P>FLADDA, two Leagues distant, is but two Miles in Compass, but much noted for its Fishing of all Sorts, and for big Whales, which pursue the Fish on the Coast of it. The Sea Fowl called <HI>Coulternebs,</HI> are very numerous here, and a great Flock of Plovers come hither from <HI>Skye,</HI> in the Beginning of <HI>September,</HI> and return again in <HI>April.</HI> There are several Rocks about this Island, particularly one, called <HI>The round Table,</HI> about half a Mile in Cir∣cumference, with a fresh-water Spring, which makes
<PB N="264" REF="265"/>
an impregnable Fort, there being only one Way to climb up to it, by one Man at a time. The Na∣tives of <HI>Skye,</HI> and the neighbouring Islands have a peculiar way of curing the Distempers which are incident to them, by Simples of their own Product, wherein they are successful to a Miracle: They have also several Medicinal Wells; but I have not room to insist upon these things.</P>
<P>Eighty Miles West from <HI>Skye</HI> lie nine Islands, the chief of which is VATERSA, which beside many other Conveniences, has a large Harbour, capable of the greatest Ships, where at stated times great Numbers of Fishermen meet from the neighbouring Countries.</P>
<P>Two Miles from <HI>Vatersa</HI> lies BARRA, seven Miles long, and three broad, called so from St. <HI>Bar,</HI> the tutelar Saint: It is fruitful in Corn, and noted for its Cod-fishing. The Sea enters this Island at a small Chanel, and afterwards inlarges itself into a round Bay, in which is an Island, with a very strong Castle. It has a good Harbour on the North-east Side, where is Plenty of Fish; and the Rivulets on the East-side abound with Salmon.</P>
<P>About a Quarter of a Mile South from <HI>Barra</HI> lies KISMUL, the Seat of <HI>Macneil</HI> of <HI>Barra,</HI> which is encompassed with a Stone Wall two Stories high; within which there is a Tower, a Hall, a Magazine, and other Houses. They have a Church in this Island, and a Chapel, where the <HI>Macneils</HI> are buried. The Natives are Papists, and generally very ignorant and superstitious.</P>
<P>Here are several other less Islands belonging to <HI>Macneil,</HI> some of them fruitful enough in Corn and Grass, others left for Pasturage, and some of them remarkable for fishing of Ling and Cod. The Inhabitants are very healthful and hospitable: they have abundance of Sea-fowl, and when they kill any of them for Use, they salt them with the
<PB N="265" REF="266"/>
Ashes of burnt Sea-ware, which preserves them from Putrefaction. <HI>Macneil</HI> holds his Lands of Sir <HI>Alexander Macdonald</HI> of <HI>Slate,</HI> to whom he pays 40<HI>l. Scots, per Annum,</HI> and a Hawk, if required, and is obliged to furnish him with a certain Number of Men on extraordinary Occasions.</P>
<P>Betwixt <HI>Barra</HI> and <HI>Vist</HI> lie fourteen small Islands, not very considerable.</P>
<P>A little North of <HI>Barra</HI> lies SOUTH-VIST, 21 Miles long, in some Places three, and in others four Miles broad. The East-side is mountainous, but the West plain and arable. The Island abounds with fresh-water Lakes, which have plenty of Fowl and Fish, parti∣cularly Trouts and Eels. In several of them are Islands with Forts. There is one Lake three Miles long, into which the Sea has made its way, tho' the People did all they could to hinder it. The Inhabit∣ants are healthy. One Man lately lived 130 Years, and retained his Understanding. The <HI>Irish</HI> Tongue is here spoken in great Perfection. The <HI>Macdonalds,</HI> descended from the antient Kings of these Islands, are Proprietors, and with the Inhabitants profess the Popish Religion. The Soil is generally sandy, but yields a good Produce of Barley, Oats, and Rye. Ambergris is sometimes found upon the Coast.</P>
<P>Betwixt this Island and <HI>North-vist,</HI> two Miles North, lies BENBECULA: The Ground is all plain and sandy betwixt them, except two little Chanels about Knee-deep at a Tide of Ebb; but the Whole is navigable by Boats at a Tide of Flood, and there lie several small Islands on the East of these Chanels. <HI>Benbecula</HI> is three Miles long, and three broad: it has a Bay on the East-side for small Vessels, where Her∣rings are sometimes taken. The East Part of this Island is arable; it has several fresh-water Lakes well stored with Fish and Fowl, and some small Forts upon the Islands in those Lakes. The Natives are Papists, and the Proprietor is one of the <HI>Macdonalds.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="267"/>A little North of this Island lies <HI>North-vist,</HI> be∣longing to Sir <HI>Alexander Macdonald,</HI> nine Miles long, and about thirty in Circumference. It is fitter for Pasturage than Cultivation on the East Part, where it is mountainous; but the West-side is plain and arable, and where it is not ploughed, is covered with Clover, Daisy, and Variety of other Plants, very pleasant to the Sight, and of a very fragrant Smell; and affords good Pasturage. The Grain here is Barley, Oats, and Rye, which yields from ten to thirty-fold; and there is no doubt, but Wheat would grow here very well. This Island has several Bays on the East-side, where Ships may ride; the chief of which are <HI>Loch-eport, Loch-rona,</HI> and <HI>Loch-maddes</HI>; the latter is capable of Hundreds of Vessels of the greatest Size: 400 Vessels have been loaden with Herrings there in a Season. Cod, Ling, and all Sorts of Fish, that frequent the Western Seas, are to be found here. There is a small Island in this Bay, upon which a Magazine was erected for carry∣ing on a Fishery in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. There is such a Number of fresh-water Lakes in this Island, as can hardly be believed; they are generally well stored with Trouts and Eels, and, which is more strange, with Cod, Ling, and other Sea∣fish, brought in to them by the Spring-tides. These Lakes have many small Islands, which abound with Variety of Land and Sea Fowl; and some of them have Islands with Forts: It has also several Rivers, which afford Salmon, and some of them speckled, with large Scales. The Inhabitants are Protestants.</P>
<P>There are several other lesser Islands, which lie on both Sides of <HI>North-vist,</HI> the most remarkable of which is EOUSMIL, on the West, a Rock about a Quarter of a Mile in Circumference, noted for its Seal-fishing about the End of <HI>October,</HI> where three hundred and twenty are sometimes taken at once.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="268"/>Three Leagues and a half farther West lie nine or ten more Rocks, which abound with Sea Fowl, and great Numbers of Seals.</P>
<P>A little farther North lies BORERA, four Miles round; it has a fresh-water Lake well stored with large Eels. This Island affords the largest and best Sort of Dulse. It is possessed by the Family of <HI>Maclean.</HI></P>
<P>Half a League South from this lies LINGAY, which furnishes the neighbouring Islands with Peat for Fewel. It has abundance of Black Cattle, that make excel∣lent Meat; the Natives salt it in the Hides, which, they say, preserves it, and makes it taste better than when salted in Casks. This Island abounds also with Deer, Sea and Land Fowl of all Sorts; among the rest, with Hawks, Eagles, and Swans. The Inhabitants of <HI>South</HI> and <HI>North-vist</HI> are generally well proportioned and healthful, and many of them live to a great Age; they are very hospitable and kind to Strangers.</P>
<P>The Isle of LEWES derives its Name from the <HI>Irish</HI> Word <HI>Leog,</HI> signifying <HI>a Lake,</HI> with which this Island abounds; it is by the Islanders commonly called the <HI>Long Island:</HI> it is near 100 Miles from North to South, and from 13 to 14 in Breadth; it is reckoned part of the Shire of <HI>Ross</HI>; but the Isle of <HI>Lewes,</HI> properly so called, is but 36 Miles in Length, and 10 or 12 broad, belonging to the Earl of <HI>Sea∣forth.</HI> It reaches from the North of <HI>Bowling-head</HI> to the South of <HI>Hassiness.</HI> The Southern Part is named <HI>Harries.</HI> The Air is temperately cold and moist, and the Natives use commonly a Dose of <HI>Usquebaugh</HI> for a Corrective. The Island is healthful, especially in the Middle, from South and North; it is arable on the West-side for about 16 Miles on the Coast, and is likewise plain and arable in several Places in the East: It is fruitful in Corn, and yields a good Increase; their common Grain is Barley, Oats, and Rye; and they have also Flax and Hemp. There are several convenient Bays and Harbours here,
<PB N="268" REF="269"/>
particularly <HI>Lochstornvay,</HI> on the East-side, in the Middle of the Island; the <HI>Birkin Island,</HI> seven Miles Southward; <HI>Locheolmkil,</HI> three Miles farther South; <HI>Lochsefort</HI> and <HI>Lochcarlvay,</HI> 24 Miles South-west. This Bay is remarkable for great Numbers of Cod, Ling, and Whales, which frequent it; and all the Bays and Coasts abound with Cod, Ling, Herring, and all other Sorts of Fish taken in the Western Seas, besides Plenty of Shell-fish of all Sorts, in such vast Numbers, that the Inhabitants are not able to consume them. Coral and Pearl-shells are also found in the Bays and Coasts. There are several extraordinary Springs and Fountains in this Island, and abundance of Caves on the Coasts, which Ot∣ters, Seals, and Fowl frequent in great Numbers. That Obelisk (if I may call it so) in the Parish of <HI>Barvas</HI> in the Island of <HI>Lewes,</HI> called <HI>The Thrushel∣stone,</HI> is very remarkable; being not only above 20 Feet high, but likewise almost as much in Breadth, which no other comes near. The <HI>Dun,</HI> or Fortification built on an Eminence in <HI>St. Kilda,</HI> which is an old Fort, is about 18 Leagues distant from <HI>North Vist,</HI> and 20 from the Middle of <HI>Lewes,</HI> or <HI>Harries,</HI> to be seen only in a very fair Day, like a blueish Mist; but a large Fire there would be visible at Night, as the ascending Smoke by Day. In this same Isle (where are many such <HI>Duns</HI>) North of the Village of <HI>Brago,</HI> is a round Fort composed of huge Stones, three Stories high; that is, it has three hollow Passages one over another, within a prodigious thick Wall quite round the Fort, with many Windows and Stairs.</P>
<P>Here also, at the Village of <HI>Classerniss,</HI> is a Druidical Temple extremely remarkable. The Circle consists of 12 Obelisks, about seven Feet high each, and distant from each other six Feet. In the Centre stands a Stone 13 Feet high, in the perfect Shape of the Rudder of a Ship. Directly
<PB N="269" REF="270"/>
South from the Circle, stand four Obelisks running out in a Line, another such Line due East, and a third to the West; the Number and Distances of the Stones being in these Wings the same: so that this Temple, the most intire that can be, is at the same time both round and winged. But to the North, reach (by way of Avenue) two strait Ranges of Obelisks, of the same Bigness and Distances with those of the Circle; yet the Ranges themselves are eight Feet distant, each consisting of 19 Stones, the 39th being in the Entrance of the Avenue. This Temple stands astronomically, denoting the 12 Signs of the Zodiack, and the four principal Winds, sub∣divided each into four others; by which, and the 19 Stones, on each side the Avenue, representing the Cycle of 19 Years, it appears to have been dedicated principally to the Sun, but subordinately to the Seasons, and the Elements; particularly to the Sea, and the Winds, as is manifest by the Rudder in the Middle.</P>
<P>This Island abounds with Cows, Horses, Sheep, Goats and Hogs; the Black Cattle are small, but very prolifick, and make excellent Meat; the Horses are likewise smaller than on the Continent, but as serviceable for all domestick Uses, and live very hard, having little to feed upon in the Spring but Sea-ware. The Inhabitants are well proportioned, and in ge∣neral healthful and strong, and of a sanguine Com∣plexion; they are very quick of Apprehension, and Lovers of Poesy and Musick: They are dextrous at Swimming, Volting, and Archery, and make stout, able Seamen.</P>
<P>In a little Island near the greater one of <HI>Lewes,</HI> were a couple of Eagles, which would never suffer any other of their Kind to continue in the Place; driving away their own young ones, as soon as they were able to fly. The Natives said, That those Eagles were so careful of their Habitation, that they
<PB N="270" REF="271"/>
never killed any Sheep or Lamb in the Island, tho' the Bones of Lambs, Fawns, and Wild-fowl, were frequently found in and about their Nests; so that they made their Purchase in the opposite Islands, the nearest of which is a League distant.</P>
<P>There are many other lesser Islands, which lie round this; the chief of which are, GARVE, in the Mouth of <HI>Lochcarlvay,</HI> a high Rock, half a Mile in Compass, affording good Pasturage, and naturally a strong Fort: the two BERNERA's, one two Miles, and the other four Miles long, and four Miles broad; both fruitful in Corn and Grass.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Carlvay Bay</HI> lie four small Islands, which belong to the Inhabitants of <HI>Lewes,</HI> who go thither every Summer, and bring from thence great Store of Fowls, Eggs, Down, Feathers, and Quills; one of them is called the ISLAND OF PYGMIES, be∣cause many little Bones, resembling those of Men, are digged out of the Ground there.</P>
<P>Twenty Leagues from the Point of <HI>Nesse</HI> in <HI>Lewes</HI> lies <HI>Rona,</HI> a Mile long, and half a Mile broad: it has a Hill on the West Part, which makes it visible from <HI>Lewes</HI> in the Summer-time. It was inhabited by about five Families, who had the Island and the Fishery about it divided among them, and were very exact and nice in their Properties; and when their Number increased, the Supernumeraries were sent to their Landlord in <HI>Lewes,</HI> who once a Year sends the Minister of his Parish, and a Servant, to visit them, and bring his Rents, which are paid in Barley-meal sewed up in Skins, Sea Fowl, and some Fish, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They have a Chapel dedicated to St. <HI>Ronan,</HI> in which they repeat the Lord's Prayer, Creed, and Ten Commandments every <HI>Lord's-day. Buchanan</HI> says, That the Inhabitants were, in his Opinion, the only People in the World, who never wanted any thing, and were satisfied with their Condition, having Plenty of all that they desired; being equally
<PB N="271" REF="272"/>
ignorant of Luxury and Avarice, and possessing, thro' their Freedom from Vices, that Innocence and Tranquillity of Mind, which others can scarcely attain unto by great Labour, and with the Help of the best Instructions. Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> affirms, in his <HI>Description of the Western Islands,</HI> That antient Race of poor People was all destroyed about 40 Years ago, in the following manner: First, A Swarm of Rats, none knows how, came into the Island, and eat up all their Corn. In the next Place, some Seamen landed, and robbed them of what Provisions they had left. By this means they all died before the usual Time of the Arrival of the Boat from <HI>Lewes</HI>; upon which another Colony was sent thither.</P>
<P>Four Leagues East from <HI>Rona</HI> lies SOULISKER, a Rock, a Quarter of a Mile in Circumference, which abounds with vast Numbers of Sea Fowl, particularly <HI>Solan</HI> Geese. On this Rock there builds one Fowl not found elsewhere, called <HI>Colk</HI>; it is less than a Goose, and all covered with Down, but of different Colours, which it casts when it hatches; it has a Tuft on its Head resembling that of a Peacock, and a Train longer than that of a House-cock. There were formerly 24 Churches in <HI>Lewes</HI> and <HI>Harries,</HI> and the Islands belonging to them: but, alas! to our Shame may it be said, as Papists were prosecuted or discouraged, Profaneness gained Ground of Superstition, and one sort of Ignorance succeeded another; for few or no Ministers being sent with suitable Provision and Encouragement, Places of religious Worship became ruinous, and the Service of God, and the Edification of the People, very much neglected; so that several Parishes in the <HI>Highlands</HI> and <HI>Isles,</HI> at present, are 20, 30, or near forty Miles long, and very often without any Minister at all.</P>
<P>That Part which is called HARRIES, produces the same Sorts of Corn, but with a greater Increase than <HI>Lewes.</HI> The West-side is for the most part arable
<PB N="272" REF="273"/>
on the Coast. It has a noble Harbour called <HI>Scalpa,</HI> a Mile and a half long, and a Mile broad; and there are two other Harbours within three Leagues of it, which abound with Oysters, and other Shell∣fish. They have excellent Springs here, some of which are Medicinal; one particularly near <HI>Marvag</HI> is excellent for restoring a lost Appetite, and one near <HI>Borve,</HI> good against the Colick and Gravel. There are several Caves on the Mountains, and on each side of the Coast, and in the middle of a high Rock, capable of holding 50 Men; has two Wells, and but a narrow Pass to it by climbing up the Rock; so that in Time of War it is an impregnable Fort. There are likewise several antient Forts in this Island. The Hills and Mountains abound with Deer, which none are allowed to hunt without Leave from <HI>Mac∣leod,</HI> the Proprietor. <HI>Metricks,</HI> a four-footed Crea∣ture, about the Size of a large Cat, are pretty nu∣merous here; their Skins are very fine, of a brown Colour, and make good Fur; and 'tis said, the Dung of this Animal yields a Scent like Musk. There are abundance of Otters and Seals here, great Plenty of Land and Sea Fowl, and among others, Eagles, and very good Hawks. The Inhabitants both of <HI>Lewes</HI> and <HI>Harries</HI> are Protestants.</P>
<P>There are other Islands of small Extent belonging to the <HI>Harries,</HI> the chief of which are BERNERA, two Leagues to the South; it is five Miles in Cir∣cumference, very fruitful in Barley and Rye, and yields sometimes from 20 to 30 Fold. There are two Chapels in this Island.</P>
<P>Half a League from thence to the Westward lies PABBAY, three Miles in Circumference, and fruit∣ful in Corn and Grass: It has also two Chapels.</P>
<P>Half a League to the North lies SELLAY, a Mile in Circumference; it yields extraordinary Pasture for Sheep, which it fattens very soon, and those bred there have very large Horns.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="274"/>TARANSAY, a League farther North, is three Miles round, fruitful in Corn and Grass, and yields much yellow Talc.</P>
<P>There are several other Islands in the Neighbour∣hood, of two or three Miles in Circumference each, all tolerably fruitful in Corn and Pasturage; parti∣cularly HERMATRA, where a Magazine for the Fishery was erected in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I.</P>
<P>Eighteen Leagues West from <HI>North-vist,</HI> and 20 from <HI>Harries,</HI> lies the Island called ST. KILDA, or HIRTA; as <HI>This Hirta</HI> is the most North-west, so <HI>Dow Hirta</HI> is the most South-west of all the <HI>Scots</HI> Islands. The first, properly called <HI>St. Kilda,</HI> is two Miles long and one broad, faced round with a steep Rock, except at the Bay on the South-east, where Vessels enter. The Land rises high in the Middle, and there are several Fountains of good Water on each side the Island. Their Grain is Oats and Bar∣ley, the latter accounted the largest in the <HI>Western Isles.</HI> The Inhabitants are about two hundred in Number, very well proportioned and comely. They are Protestants, and very zealous, according to their Knowledge, which is but small for want of In∣struction. They are very regular and just in their Conversation, and Strangers to Luxury and Excess, being ignorant of the Use of Money. They have a Chapel, where they assemble on the <HI>Lord's-day,</HI> to hear the Lord's Prayer, Creed, and Ten Com∣mandments; and neither work themselves, nor will allow any Stranger to work, on that Day. It be∣longs to the Laird of <HI>Macleod,</HI> the Chief of that antient Clan, who commonly makes some Cadet of his Family Steward of this Island, to receive his Rents, which are paid in Fish, Fowl, Feathers, Wool, Butter, Cheese, Cattle, and Corn: and the Steward's Deputy is, in his Absence, the chief Man of the Island; and generally, except when a Minister is sent thither from <HI>Harries,</HI> baptizes and
<PB N="274" REF="275"/>
marries. They have an Altar and Crucifix in their Chapel, which have continued there since the Time of Popery; and tho' they pay no Worship to the Crucifix, yet they swear decisive Oaths, by laying their Hands upon it, and take the Marriage Oath in the same manner. Not long ago an illiterate Fel∣low, one of the Natives, imposed upon their Igno∣rance, by pretending that St. <HI>John the Baptist,</HI> and the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> had appeared to him, and taught him Sermons, Prayers, and Hymns: the latter, he alledged, were effectual to secure Women against Mis∣carriage; and his Price for teaching them was a Sheep. He told them of a little Hill, where St. <HI>John</HI> and the Virgin appeared to him: And made them believe, that if any of their Black Cattle or Sheep came near to taste the Grass of that Hill, they must immediately be killed and eaten; and it was necessary, that he himself should always partake of the Treat. He was discovered at last by his lewd Attempts upon several Women; and being, by <HI>Macleod</HI>'s Order, transported from thence to <HI>Harries,</HI> he made publick Confession of his Im∣posture in several Churches, and seemed to be very penitent, but was not allowed to return any more. Their Houses are low, built of Stone, and a Cement of dry Earth, and covered with Turf, thatched over with Straw. They make their Beds in the Walls of their Houses, and lie commonly on Straw, tho' they have great Plenty of Feathers and Down. They live all together in a little Village, on the East-side of the Island, in good Harmony; are very exact and nice in their several Properties, and allow no Encroachment upon one another, nor will they admit of it from their Landlord, or his Steward, but pay exactly what they agree on. The Island is naturally strong, and, with a little Art, might be made impregnable. There is an old Fort at the South-end of the Bay.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="276"/>In the Island of <HI>St. Kilda</HI> is the House of a Druidess, built all of Stone, without Lime, or Mor∣ter, or Earth to cement it; it is also arched, and of a conick Figure, but open at the Top, and a Fire∣place in the Middle of the Floor. It cannot con∣tain above nine Persons, to sit easy by each other. From the Side of the Wall go off three low Vaults, separated from each other by Pillars, and capable of containing five Persons apiece.</P>
<P>Just such another House in all respects, but much larger, and grown over with a green Sod on the Outside, is in <HI>Borera,</HI> an Isle adjacent to <HI>St. Kilda,</HI> which was the Habitation of a Druid.</P>
<P>At the North-end of <HI>St. Kilda,</HI> were a cou∣ple of Eagles, who drove away all others of the same Kind, even their own Progeny; and brought their Prey from other Parts, without plundering the Place of their own Residence.</P>
<P>They have two other Islands which belong to them, one called SOA, about half a Mile from the West∣side of <HI>St. Kilda,</HI> a Mile in Circumference, and very high and steep all round.</P>
<P>The other is called BORERA, lies about two Leagues North of <HI>St. Kilda,</HI> is about a Mile in Circumference, and most of it surrounded with a high Rock. All three afford good Pasturage, and abound with prodigious Numbers of Sea Fowl from <HI>March</HI> till <HI>September.</HI> They have <HI>Solan</HI> Geese in such Numbers, that they keep about 20,000 annually in little Stone Houses, built on purpose for them, and for preserving their other Fowl, Eggs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The latter they preserve some Months in the Ashes of Peat, and they preserve their Fowl without Salt: They eat the <HI>Solan</HI> Geese Eggs raw, and say they are good Pectorals. They have another Bird here, called <HI>Fulmar,</HI> about the Size of a Moor-hen: it picks its Food out of live Whales, and other Fishes. When any one approaches them, they spout out
<PB N="276" REF="277"/>
pure Oil from their Bills, which the Natives have a way to catch, when they surprise the Fowl; and make use of it for their Lamps, and likewise as a Remedy against Rheumatick Pains, Aches, and other Distempers. It serves them also for Vomits and Purges, for Swellings or Strains, and discussing of Tumours; in all which Cases, they say, it is very successful. Both Sexes have a Genius for Poesy, are very hospitable to Strangers, and charitable to their own Poor, for whose Maintenance they all contri∣bute in Proportion. They have but one Boat be∣longing to the Island, in which every Man has a Share proportionable to the Rent he pays. The Men are generally strong, are stout Rowers, and will tug a long time at the Oar without Intermission. They use no Compass, but take their Measure from the Sun, Moon, or Stars, and chiefly from the Courses of the Flocks of the Sea Fowl, because they know very well to what Rocks or Islands they resort. They are excellent at climbing of Rocks, being accustomed to it from their Infancy, in order to catch the Fowl which build on them. They have two Ropes, which belong to them in common for climb∣ing the Rocks; they are 24 Fathoms in Length each, and covered with Cows Hides salted, to pre∣vent their being cut by the Rocks. The Men climb by turns, and bring home some Thousands of Eggs and Fowls at a time. They also make Gins of Horse-hair, for catching the Fowl; yet sometimes they lose their Lives by climbing. The richest Man in the Isle has not above eight Cows, eighty Sheep, and two or three Horses. They have no Money, but barter with one another for what they want.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Martin,</HI> to whom I am obliged for most of these Particulars relating to the Islands, (for it cannot be supposed I could think of entering every one of them in Person) gives an Account of that called the SECOND SIGHT, which, he says, is a Representa∣tion,
<PB N="277" REF="278"/>
by way of Vision, of something to come, and makes such a strong Impression upon the Seers, that they cannot see or think of any thing else while the Vision lasts; and they appear chearful, or other∣wise, according to the Nature of the Object repre∣sented; they use no previous Means to attain it, and to most of them 'tis very troublesome. The Instances of the Truth of this <HI>Second Sight,</HI> as 'tis called, are so many, and so frequent, that it can scarcely be disputed. 'Tis certainly a strange Illu∣sion; but I shall not venture to give my Opinion about it; only observing, with others, that this Fa∣culty decays in Proportion as Christianity increases among them, and as they improve in Knowledge. Some of the People, to whom those Visions have been frequent, have learned by Experience, as we were told, to determine the Time when the Things represented shall come to pass. The Reverend Mr. <HI>John Frazer,</HI> the late Dean of the <HI>Isles,</HI> has writ a small Treatise upon this Subject, called <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>We shall conclude our Description of these Islands with an Extract from Mr. <HI>Toland</HI>'s Specimen of his <HI>History of the Druids</HI>; where he treats in general of the Properties of all these Isles, whither, it seems, he had intended to have travelled, in order to perfect his History, and rescue many valuable Pieces of An∣tiquity from utter Oblivion.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, says that Gentleman, no Country abounds more with the Necessaries of Life, and at less Labour or Charge, than the <HI>Hebrides.</HI> In the first place, there is known to be, in those Islands, a prodigious Plenty of Flesh and Fish. Their Cattle of all Sorts (as Cows, Sheep, Goats, and Hogs) are exceeding numerous and prolifick; small indeed of Size, as are likewise their Horses, but of a sweet and delicious Taste. So are their Deer, which freely range in Herds on the Mountains. No Place can
<PB N="278" REF="279"/>
compare with this for tame and wild Fowl, there being of the latter no-where in the World a greater Diversity, many Sorts of them extremely beautiful, and rare, or utterly unknown, elsewhere. The like may be said of their various amphibious Animals. Numberless are their Fountains and Springs, Rivulets, Rivers and Lakes, very wholsome in their Waters, and every-where superabounding with Fish, especi∣ally the most delicate, as Trout and Salmon: nor is it by Herrings alone that all <HI>Europe</HI> knows no Seas to be better stored, nor with more Kinds, from the Shrimp to the Whale; as no Harbours or Bays are superior, whether regard be had to Number or Com∣modiousness. Add to this their Variety of excellent Roots and Plants, particularly those of marine Growth, every one of them serving for Food or Physick. Their Pastures are so kindly, that they might live on Milk alone, with that inconceivable Quantity of Eggs they yearly gather off the desert Rocks and Islets. Bread is plentiful enough. The Ground is generally allow'd to be much richer, than on the <HI>Scotish</HI> Continent, some Parts whereof are not seldom supply'd hence with Corn.</P>
<P><HI>Lewes</HI> is very fruitful; and tho' Barley, Oats, and Rye, be the only Grain sown there at present, yet the Ground both in that, and most of the other Islands, is fit to bear Wheat, and consequently Legumes of all sorts. 'Tis truly amazing they have any Crop at all, considering how unskilful they are in Agriculture, how destitute of the properest In∣struments to till the Ground, and that they scarce use any other Manure but Sea-wreck or Tangles. From the Ignorance of the Inhabitants in these re∣spects, as also in planting, inclosing and draining, many fruitful Spots lie uncultivated; but they are abundantly supply'd with choice Eatables, and the most nourishing Shell-fish.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="280"/>In <HI>Bernera,</HI> near <HI>Harries,</HI> the Produce of Barley is many times from 20 to 30 fold. In <HI>Harries</HI> and <HI>South-vist</HI> one Barley-grain sometimes produces from 7 to 14 Ears, as in <HI>North-vist</HI> from 10 to 30 fold in a plentiful Year. At <HI>Corchattan</HI> in <HI>Skye</HI> the Increase amounted once to 35. If the Ground be laid down for some time, it gives a good Crop with∣out Dunging, some Fields not having been dung'd in 40 Years. A small Tract of Ground, at <HI>Skerry-breek,</HI> in the said Isle of <HI>Skye,</HI> had yielded 100 fold. With regard to their Pastures, nothing is more common than for an Ewe to have two Lambs at a time. Besides the ordinary Rent a Tenant paid, it was a Custom in the Islands, if any of his Cows or Sheep brought two young ones at a time, one of them was to go to the Landlord; who, on his part, was obliged, if any of his Tenants Wives bore Twins, to take one of them into his own Family. Even the wild Goats on the Mountains (for such there are in <HI>Harries</HI>) are observed to bring forth their Young twice a Year. From hence 'tis evident, that those Islands are capable of great Improvement, as they abound likewise in many Curiosities, espe∣cially in Subjects of Philosophical Observation. Nor is it less plain by the many antient Monu∣ments remaining among them, and the Marks of the Plough reaching to the very Tops of the Moun∣tains, (which the artless Inhabitants think incapable of Culture) that in remote Ages they were in a far more flourishing Condition than at present. The Ruins of spacious Houses, and the numerous Obelisks, old Forts, Temples, Altars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> undeniably prove this; besides that the Country was formerly full of Woods, as appears by the great Oak and Firr-trees daily dug out of the Ground, and by many other Tokens, there being several Woods and Coppices still remaining in <HI>Skye, Mull,</HI> and other Places. The Inhabitants are not to be mended in the Pro∣portion
<PB N="280" REF="281"/>
of their Persons; no preposterous Bandages distorting them in the Cradle, nor hindering Nature from duly forming their Limbs; which is the Rea∣son, that bodily Imperfections of any sort are very rare among them. Neither does any over-officiously preventive Physick, in their Infancy, spoil their original Constitution; whence they have so strong a Habit of Body, that one of them requires treble the Dose, as will purge any Man in the South of <HI>Scotland.</HI> But what contributes above all things to their Health and Longevity, is constant Temper∣ance and Exercise. Their Food is commonly fresh, and their Meals two a Day, Water being the ordi∣nary Drink of the Vulgar. They cure all Disorders of the Body by Simples of their own Growth, and by proper Diet or Labour. Hence they are stout and active, dextrous in all their Exercises; as they are withal remarkably sagacious, cholerick, but easily appeased, sociable, good-natured, ever-chear∣ful, and having a strong Inclination to Musick. They are hospitable beyond Expression, entertaining all Strangers, of what Condition soever, <HI>gratis</HI>; the Use of Money being still in some of those Islands unknown, and, till a few Ages past, in all of them. They have no Lawyers or Attorneys. The Men and Women plead their own Causes; and a very speedy Decision is made by the Proprietor, who is perpetual President in their Courts, or by his Bailiff, as his Substitute.</P>
<P>The present (says Mr. <HI>Toland</HI>) is the 35th Lord of <HI>Barra</HI> by uninterrupted lineal Descent, a thing whereof no Prince in the World can boast; and he is regarded as no mean Potentate by his Subjects, who know none greater than he. When the Wife of any of them dies, he has immediate recourse to his Lord, representing first his own Loss in the Want of a Female Companion; and next, that of <HI>Macneil,</HI> his Lord, himself, if he should not go on to beget
<PB N="281" REF="282"/>
Followers for him. Hereupon <HI>Macneil</HI> finds out a suitable Match (neither Side ever disliking his Choice, but accepting it as the highest Favour); and the Marriage is celebrated without any Courtship, Portion or Dowry: but they never fail to make merry on such Occasions, with a Bottle or more of Usquebaugh. On the other hand, when any Woman becomes a Widow, she is, upon the like Application, soon provided with an Husband, and with as little Ceremony. <HI>Macneil</HI> also supplies any of his Tenants with as many Milch-cows, as he may chance to lose by the Severity of the Weather; or by other Misfortunes. He takes likewise into his own Family, and maintains to the Day of their Death, as many old Men, as thro' Age or Infirmity become unfit for Labour, an House being built hard-by on Purpose for them.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Northern Isles of <HI>Scotland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE come now to the Isles of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Shetland.</HI> The <HI>Orkneys,</HI> called by the <HI>Latins Orcades,</HI> have the <HI>Caledonian</HI> Ocean on the West, the <HI>German</HI> Ocean on the East, the Sea that divides them from <HI>Shetland,</HI> on the North, and <HI>Pentland</HI> Firth, 24 Miles long, and 12 Miles broad, which divides them from the main Land of <HI>Scotland,</HI> on the South. Antient Authors differ about their Number. <HI>Pliny</HI> reckoned them Forty, <HI>Orosius</HI> Thirty-three; but it appears by later Discoveries, that they are only Twenty-eight. They lie in Longitude 22 Deg. 11 Min. Latitude 59 Deg. 2 Min. The longest Day is 18 Hours and some odd Minutes: The Win∣ters, as in most small Islands, and indeed always near the Sea, are generally more subject to Rain than Snow. The Frost and Snow do not continue long, but the Wind is very boisterous; and it rains
<PB N="282" REF="283"/>
sometimes not by Drops, but by violent Spouts of Water.</P>
<P>STROMA lies so near the Coast of <HI>Caithness,</HI> that it was always possessed by the Earls of that County, and therefore not reckoned among the <HI>Orcades.</HI> This is a small Island, but not unfruitful. Authors are not agreed as to the Reason of giving the Name of <HI>Pentland Firth</HI> to that Streight, in Breadth about 12 Miles, which lies between the <HI>Orcades</HI> and the main Land; some say, it is a Corruption of the Word <HI>Pictland Firth,</HI> which was so called, because the <HI>Picts</HI> formerly inhabited those Islands, and part of the neighbouring Continent, and that many of them perished here, when repulsed by the antient Inhabitants of <HI>Orkney.</HI> Others think <HI>Pentland Firth</HI> the proper Name, and it was so denominated from the Highlands or Hills in the North of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by which it is bounded on one Side, for the same Rea∣son that the high Hills, which take their Rise some Miles South-west of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> are called <HI>Pentland Hills.</HI> This Firth is remarkable for its swift, vio∣lent, and contrary Tides, occasioned by the Multi∣tude of the Isles, and the Narrowness of the Passage, which makes it very dangerous, especially to Stran∣gers; and, which is remarkable, the Whirlpools, with which this Firth abounds, occasioned, as is thought, by some <HI>Hiatus's</HI> in the Earth below, are most dangerous in a Calm, and whirl the Boats or Ships round, till they swallow them up; but if there be any Wind, and the Boat under Sail, they are passed without Danger. The Mariners, who use to carry Passengers between the main Land and the Isles, if at any time they are driven near those Whirlpools by the Tide, throw a Barrel, Oar, Bundle of Straw, or any other bulky Thing that comes to hand, into the Whirlpools, which make them smooth enough till the Vessel pass over them; and what is thus cast in, is generally found floating again a Mile or two
<PB N="283" REF="284"/>
distant. The different Tides in this Firth are reckoned twenty-four, and run with such impetuous Force, that no Ship under Sail, with the fairest Wind, is able to make way against them; yet the Natives on both Sides, who know the proper Sea∣sons, pass this Firth every Day safely, except when the Weather is tempestuous.</P>
<P>The first of the <HI>Orkney</HI> Islands is SOUTH RONALSA, six Miles long and five broad, fruitful in Corn, and well inhabited; it has a safe Harbour on the North-side, but the South-east has the dangerous Rocks called <HI>Pentland Skerries</HI>; it abounds with Cattle, and has two united Parish Churches, whereof the Dean was Minister.</P>
<P>A little to the South-west lies SWINNA, a small Island, fruitful in Corn, capable of maintaining a few Husbandmen, and their Families; has a good Fishing on its Coasts, and is noted for a good Slate Quarry. The Whirlpools near this Island are called the <HI>Wells of Swinna.</HI></P>
<P>Beyond <HI>Swinna</HI> lie WAYES and HOY, which are but one Isle, 12 Miles long, and full of high Moun∣tains: that Part called <HI>Wayes</HI> is fruitful, and very well inhabited. This Island has several good Har∣bours, particularly that called <HI>North Hope,</HI> one of the best in the World, and properest for those who design a Fishing-trade. That Part called <HI>Hoy,</HI> from which it is only separated by a Spring-tide, has the highest Mountains in <HI>Orkney,</HI> and the deepest Val∣leys, which strike a Terror into Strangers, who have Occasion to travel that Way. On these Moun∣tains there are many Sheep, which run wild, and are scarcely to be caught by any Art. On <HI>Rora∣head,</HI> a high and rugged Promontory in this Island, an extraordinary Fowl, which the Inhabitants call <HI>Lyer,</HI> builds its Nest; it is about the Size of a Duck, and so fat, that it seems to be nothing else; the In∣habitants admire it much, and venture their Lives
<PB N="284" REF="285"/>
to climb for it by Ropes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is reckoned deli∣cious Food, eaten with Vinegar and Pepper. On a barren Heath in this Island lies an oblong Stone, in a Valley between two moderate Hills, called, by way of Contraries, <HI>The dwarfy Stone.</HI> It is 36 Feet long, 18 Feet broad, and 9 Feet high. No other Stones are near it. 'Tis all hollow'd within, having a Door on the East-side two Feet square, with a Stone of the same Dimension lying about two Feet from it, which was intended, no doubt, to close this Entrance. Within there is cut out, at the South-end of it, the Form of a Bed and Pillow, capable of holding two Persons; as at the North-end is another Bed, both very neatly done. Above, at an equal Distance from both, is a large round Hole, which is supposed not only to have been designed for letting in Light and Air when the Door was shut; but likewise for letting out Smoke from the Fire, for which there is a Place made in the Middle between the two Beds. The Marks of the Workman's Tool appear every-where; and the Tradition of the Vulgar is, that a Giant and his Wife had this Stone for their Habitation; tho' the Door alone destroys this Fancy, which is wholly groundless every way besides. Just by it is a clear and pleasant Spring, for the Use of the Inhabitant.</P>
<P>From the Top of these Hills the Sun is to be seen all Night about the Summer Solstice. On the North Part of this Island are a Church, a Gentleman's Seat, and several Farm-houses, as also divers Lakes, which abound with Fish, especially Trouts.</P>
<P>Three Miles from <HI>South Ronalsay</HI> lies BURRA, three Miles long, and one broad, fruitful in Corn and Pasturage, and affords excellent Fewel. <HI>Stewart</HI> of <HI>Mains</HI> built a noble and sumptuous Stone House here. This Isle abounds with Rabbets, and has a Chapel, but belongs to the Parish of <HI>South Ronal∣say.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="286"/>West from this lies FLOTTA, 5 Miles long, and 3 and a half broad, most of it encompassed with high Rocks; it has a Church and a Gentleman's Seat, and abounds with excellent Land-fowl in its Heaths; but has little Corn-ground, and not many Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Near this lie FAIRA, CAVA, and GRANSEY, fruitful and pleasant, tho' small Islands.</P>
<P>We pass by several <HI>Holms,</HI> as they call them, which are left for Pasturage; and come to POMONA, the largest of the <HI>Orkney</HI> Islands, and for that Rea∣son called <HI>The Main-land</HI>; it is 24 Miles long; in some Places nine, and in others six Miles broad; it is very fruitful, and well inhabited; tho' there are no Trees in all these Islands, but what grow in the Bishop's Gardens at <HI>Kirkwall,</HI> in this Island, the only Town in <HI>Orkney,</HI> a Royal Borough, long pos∣sessed by the <HI>Norwegians,</HI> pleasantly situated upon a Bay, near the Middle of it; it is about a Mile in Length, and is the Seat of Justice, where the Sheriffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> keep their Courts. It consists of one Street, which is narrow; but the Houses are well built, and most of them covered with Slate. The Crown had formerly a very strong Castle here, which is now in Ruins. Near the Castle stands a stately House, formerly the Bishop's Seat; and near to that a Palace, which was begun by <HI>Patrick Stewart,</HI> Earl of <HI>Orkney,</HI> in the Year 1574. but not finished, because of his untimely Death: Several Rooms of it have been curiously painted with Scripture Stories. At the North-end of the Town is a Fort built by the <HI>English,</HI> during <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI>'s Administration, ditch'd about with a Breastwerk, and other Fortifi∣cations, on which they have some Canon planted, for the Defence of the Harbour. There is a stately Cathedral Church here, called by the Name of <HI>St. Magnus,</HI> who, the Natives say, was their first Apostle: it is very magnificent for this Part of the World, and built of hewn Stone, excellently
<PB N="286" REF="287" MS="y"/>
polished; it has fourteen Pillars on each Side, and a Steeple erected on four larger Pillars in the Middle, with fine Bells in it: there are so many Turnings, that it is hard for a Stranger to find the same Way out or in. Here is a publick Grammar-school; they have a Charter for two weekly Markets, and an annual Fair, which holds three Days. The Town is governed by a Provost, four Bailiffs, and a Common-council. This Island has nine Parish-churches, many Promontories and Bays, and several Mines of good white and black Lead; it has also several Gentlemens Seats, and divers Lakes and Ri∣vulets, which abound with Salmon and other Fish. It has four very good Harbours; <HI>viz.</HI> one at <HI>Kirk∣wall,</HI> both large and safe; another at <HI>Deersound,</HI> very large, with good Anchorage, and capable of receiving the greatest Fleets; the third is at <HI>Graham</HI>'s <HI>Hall</HI>; and the fourth at <HI>Kerston,</HI> which is very com∣modious and well fenced against all Winds. In this Island are two Temples, where the Natives believe by Tradition, that the Sun and Moon were worship∣ped; which Belief of theirs is very right, since the lesser Temple is semicircular. The greater is 110 Paces diameter. There are two green Mounts erected at the East and West-end of it; and round each of the Temples a Trench or Ditch is drawn, like that about <HI>Stone-kenge.</HI> Many of the Stones are about 20 or 24 Feet in Height above the Ground, about five in Breadth, and a Foot or two in Thickness. Some of them are fallen down; and the Temples are one on the East, and the other on the West-side of the Lake of <HI>Stennis,</HI> where it is shallow and fordable, there being a Passage over by large stepping Stones. Near the smaller Temple (which is on the East-side of the Lake, as the greater on the West) stand two Stones of the same Bigness with the rest; thro' the Middle of one of which runs a large Hole, by which Criminals and Victims were tyed.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="288"/>East from <HI>The Main-land</HI> lies COPPINSHA, a small Island, but fruitful in Corn and Grass, has good Fishing, and abounds with Fowl; it is very con∣spicuous to Seamen, as is the Holm to the North-east of it, called <HI>The Horse of Coppinsha.</HI></P>
<P>North from <HI>The Main-land</HI> lies SHAPINSHA, five or six Miles long, and three broad; it has a very safe Harbour, and a Parish-church.</P>
<P>To the South-east lies STRONSA, six Miles long, and three broad, well known, because of its good Harbours, to those who frequent this Country and <HI>Shetland</HI> for Fishing: it is very fruitful, and well inhabited, and has a Rock belonging to it called <HI>Outkerrie,</HI> remarkable for its good Fishery.</P>
<P>A little North of it lies a little pleasant Isle, called PAPA STRONSA, very fruitful, and well inhabited.</P>
<P>Farther North lies SANDA, about 12 Miles long, and eight Miles broad, well inhabited, and has two Harbours; it abounds with Cattle, Hay, and Fish; but the Inhabitants are obliged to bring their Fewel from EDA, which lies East of it: It is ten Miles long, and in some Places five Miles broad; there is good Salt made here, and it abounds with Fish and Fowl, but not with Corn and Grass.</P>
<P>Three Miles West from <HI>Kirkwall</HI> lies DAMSEY, a small, but fruitful Island, and abounds with Fish.</P>
<P>To the North-west lies ROUSA, eight Miles long, and six broad; it has many Promontories, and high Hills; but on the Coast is fruitful, and well in∣habited; it abounds also with Fowl, Fish, and Rabbets.</P>
<P>There are several other Islands in the Neighbour∣hood, which are fruitful enough for their Extent.</P>
<P>Eight Miles North from <HI>Kirkwall</HI> lies EGLISHA, three Miles long, and two broad; it has a safe Road for Ships, is very pleasant and fruitful, and has a Parish-church.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="289"/>Five Miles North-east lies NORTH-FARA, three Miles long; it is but thinly inhabited, but affords the common Commodities of the Country.</P>
<P>SOUTH-FARA, which lies near <HI>Burra,</HI> is much of the same Extent and Nature.</P>
<P>North from <HI>Eglisha</HI> lies WESTRA, eight Miles long, in some Places five, and in others three Miles broad; it is well inhabited, abounds with Corn, Cattle, Fish and Rabbets, has a strong Castle, with a convenient Harbour.</P>
<P>Two Miles North-east lies PAPA-WESTRA, three Miles long, a Mile and a half broad, is well inhabited, has a good Harbour, and together with the other <HI>Westra,</HI> makes up a Parish. In this Island stand, near a Lake, (now called <HI>St. Tredwell's Loch</HI>) two Obelisks, in one of which is a Hole used by the Heathens for the Tying of Criminals and Victims; and behind them, lying on the Ground, a third Stone, hollowed like a Trough.</P>
<P>The People of the <HI>Orcades</HI> are generally health∣ful, stout, and well proportioned; they are more numerous than can reasonably be imagined. <HI>Bleau,</HI> in his <HI>Atlas,</HI> says, they mustered 10000 Men at once, near <HI>Kirkwall,</HI> fit to carry Arms, besides those that were left to cultivate the Ground. The Commodities which they export yearly, are Butter, Tallow, Hides, Barley, Malt, Oatmeal, Fish, salted Beef, Pork, Rabbet-skins, Otter-skins, white Salt, Stuffs, Stockens, Wool, Hams, Quills, Down, Feathers, <HI>&amp;c. Molucca</HI> Beans, figured Stones, and peculiar Sorts of Fish and Fowls are found here. The <HI>Claik</HI> Geese, or <HI>Barnacles,</HI> which are reckoned to breed in the Trunks of Trees, or in the Timber of old Ships, and have been so frequently seen about these and the neighbouring Islands, have occasioned abundance of Wrangling among the Learned. Some of them have denied the Matter of Fact, and boldly asserted, there could be no such thing in Nature, as
<PB N="289" REF="290"/>
that Birds should proceed from Trees; others, who could not resist the Evidence of so many Persons of Credit, who had seen and attested the hanging of Birds of that sort to the Trunks of Trees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have had recourse to such strange Philosophical Notions for explaining this Phaenomenon, as still made the thing more ridiculous and incredible. But there are two ways to solve this Difficulty, found out by modern Authors, both of which seem very probable: The first is the <HI>Concha Anatifera,</HI> mentioned by Sir <HI>Robert Sibbald,</HI> in his <HI>Natural History of</HI> Scotland, <HI>Book</HI> III. <HI>Part</HI> ii. <HI>Cap.</HI> 12. wherein he says, that those Shells stick to Sea-ware, or Logs of Fir, and suck Nourishment from them; that the Animal contained in those Shells, is a Fish, but unshapely, and sends out such a Multitude of Feet, as resemble Hair, which the unwary Observer takes for Fea∣thers; and of this Animal Sir <HI>Robert</HI> has given us a Cut in the End of his Book. Dr. <HI>Wallis,</HI> in his Description of <HI>Orkney,</HI> has done the like, and tells us, he has seen some Thousands of those <HI>Conchae,</HI> sticking to Logs of Wood driven ashore in that Country. But the Solution given by a late Author, in his <HI>Curiosities of Nature and Art in Husbandry and Gardening,</HI> lately printed at <HI>London,</HI> p. 311. seems still to be more plain, if the Fact be true, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Barnacles</HI> lay their Eggs as Fish do theirs, and leave them at the Mercy of the Waves; and that as they float, they stick to what they meet, especially rotten Wood, Sea-ware, and other mari∣time Plants, upon which we may observe a glutinous Substance; and that they are hatched there by the Heat of the Sun.</P>
<P>The People of the <HI>Orcades,</HI> generally speaking, are very civil and industrious, hospitable, sober, and religiously disposed. Tho' the Air be sharp and cold, yet it may be called temperate. They are generally long-lived, the Women handsome, bearing Children
<PB N="290" REF="291"/>
sometimes at sixty Years. They are seldom afflicted with Fevers, Stone, or Gout; but are often liable to the Scurvy, Agues, and Consumptions. They generally speak the <HI>English</HI> Tongue after the <HI>Scots</HI> way; but many antient People of the poorer Sort, speak the <HI>Norn,</HI> or <HI>Norway,</HI> or old <HI>Danish</HI> Tongue, which has been continued from the first Planters of these Islands. They have plenty of Black Cattle, Sheep, Swine, Rabbets, Geese, and several sorts of Fish. They export great Quantities of Oil, Butter, and salt Flesh, which turn to good Account. Their Corn-land is every-where inclosed; and without these Inclosures their Sheep and Swine, and most of their Cattle, go loose, without an Herdsman.</P>
<P>They formerly had their own Kings, after the Manner of the <HI>Picts,</HI> who were harassed by the <HI>Romans</HI>; but by the Injury of Time, or Negligence of Writers, only two are come to the Knowledge of Posterity, <HI>viz. Bladus,</HI> or <HI>Balus,</HI> and <HI>Ganus,</HI> who was cotemporary with <HI>Caractacus,</HI> the 18th King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the first Century.</P>
<P>These Isles, 'tis likely, were under their own Princes, (of the <HI>Pictish</HI> Blood) till they were subdued by King <HI>Kenneth Macalpin,</HI> about the Year 840. But <HI>Anno</HI> 1099. <HI>Donald Bane</HI> having assigned them to the King of <HI>Norway,</HI> for assisting him in his Usurpation, the <HI>Norwegians</HI> invaded them; and were Masters for about 164 Years, when <HI>Magnus,</HI> King of <HI>Norway,</HI> sold all again to <HI>Alexander,</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who gave the Property hereof to a Nobleman, surnamed <HI>Speire,</HI> an Heiress of whose Family brought it to the <HI>Sinclairs,</HI> or <HI>St. Clares,</HI> one of whom carried the Title of Prince of <HI>Orkney,</HI> Duke of <HI>Old<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nburgh, &amp;c.</HI> and married a Daughter of the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s. But one of his Successors having forfeited, the Title and Estate fell to the Crown; tho', in Truth, the <HI>Scots</HI> reap'd but little Profit by them, being often disturbed by the Kings
<PB N="291" REF="292"/>
of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> who claimed the Sove∣reignty; and, in some measure, continued possessed of it, till the Marriage of King <HI>James</HI> III. with a Daughter of <HI>Denmark,</HI> when they were first mort∣gaged for a great Sum, due then by the Contract; and thereafter, upon her bringing forth a Son (after∣wards King <HI>James</HI> IV.) the intire Right to them was surrendered to King <HI>James</HI> III. which was far∣ther confirmed to King <HI>James</HI> VI. upon his marry∣ing <HI>Anne</HI> his Queen, the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Daughter. The Earldom of <HI>Orkney,</HI> and Lordship of <HI>Zetland,</HI> continued in the Crown, till Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> being to marry <HI>James Hepburn,</HI> Earl of <HI>Bothwell,</HI> by fatal Advice of her Privy Council, advanced him to the Dignity of Duke of <HI>Orkney.</HI> After his Death, King <HI>James</HI> VI. created a natural Son of King <HI>James</HI> V. Earl; which failing in his Son, it returned to the Crown: and, <HI>Anno</HI> 1647. <HI>William Dowglass,</HI> Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> having advanced, as he said, great Sums to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. procured this Country in Mortgage for his Money; but it was redeemed, and, by Act of Parliament, all re-annexed to the Crown, <HI>Anno</HI> 1669. excepting what belonged to the Bishop; which Act suppressed the Office of <HI>Sheriff,</HI> and erected one with a different Name, <HI>viz.</HI> to be called, <HI>The Stewartry of</HI> Orkney <HI>and</HI> Zetland. But the said Country, by the Union-Parliament, was dissolved from the Crown, and her late Majesty thereupon granted the same to the then Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> for Payment of the yearly Sum of 500<HI>l.</HI> and appointed him Steward and Justicier within the Bounds thereof. Under the Stewards are some Judges of his Creation and Appointment, called <HI>Bailiffs:</HI> In every Parish and Isle there is one. Their Office is to oversee the Manners of the Inhabitants, to hold Courts, and to determine in Civil Matters, to the Value of 10<HI>l. Scots</HI> (16<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d. English</HI>); but if the Matter be above, it is referred to the Steward,
<PB N="292" REF="293"/>
or his Deputy. Under and subservient to those Bailiffs, are six or seven of the most honest and in∣telligent Persons within the Parish, called <HI>Lawright∣men.</HI> These, in their respective Bounds, have the Oversight of the People, in manner of Constables, and inform the Bailiff of such Enormities as occa∣sionally happen, which the latter punishes according to the Importance and Circumstances of the Fault; and if it be above his Limits, or the Extent of his Power, he sends the Delinquent to the Seat of <HI>Ju∣stice,</HI> which is held, as we hinted, at <HI>Kirkwall,</HI> by the Steward, or his Deputy. These <HI>Lawrightmen</HI> have a Privilege inherent to their Office, by the Custom of the Country, which is not usual else∣where; and this is, if there be any Suspicion of Theft, they take some of their Neighbours with them, during the Silence of the Night, and make Search for the Theft, which is called <HI>Ransacking,</HI> from <HI>Ransaka,</HI> which is to make Inquiry, in the antient <HI>Danish:</HI> they search every House they come to, and seizing him upon whom the Theft is found, bring him to the Seat of <HI>Justice.</HI></P>
<P>The Christian Religion was not only preached, but planted very early in these Isles: for we find <HI>Servanus</HI> (or St. <HI>Serf</HI>) was their Bishop, and Pre∣ceptor to the famous <HI>Kentigern,</HI> (whom, in a familiar way, he called <HI>Mongah,</HI> or <HI>Mungo,</HI> in his vulgar Tongue) who founded the Bishoprick of <HI>St. Asaph</HI> in <HI>Wales</HI> about the Year 560. and who had been also Bishop of <HI>Glasgow.</HI> And, <HI>Anno</HI> 1071. the People of <HI>Orkney</HI> sent one of their Clergy to <HI>York,</HI> with Let∣ters, desiring that Archbishop (who was then, in <HI>Fact,</HI> possessed of a Jurisdiction over the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>) to consecrate him to be their Bishop. The last <HI>Popish</HI> Bishop was <HI>Adam Hepburn,</HI> who con∣formed to the Reformation, and lived many Years after it. He was an eminent Man in his Time, a Lord of Council and Session; he crowned King
<PB N="293" REF="294"/>
<HI>James</HI> VI. was Father to the Lord <HI>Holy-rood-house,</HI> where he was Abbot, and where his Tomb remains to this Day. The brave Lieutenant General <HI>George Hamilton,</HI> Field Marshal of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> lately deceased, was Earl of <HI>Orkney.</HI></P>
<P>Eighty Miles farther North lie the Isles of SHET∣LAND; betwixt them lies the FAIR ISLE, which rises up in three high Promontories, and is seen both in <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Shetland.</HI> They lie in 61 and 62 Degrees of North Latitude, and have <HI>Norway</HI> on the East, which is the nearest Part of the Continent of <HI>Europe.</HI> There are in all Forty-six Islands, Forty Holms, or lesser Isles, left for Pasturage, and Thirty Rocks frequented only by Fowl.</P>
<P>The first of these Islands, called THE MAIN∣LAND, is 60 Miles long, and, in some Places, 16 broad: it runs into the Sea with abundance of Promontories: it is best inhabited, and cultivated, on the Shore; but the inner Part is mountainous, and full of Lakes or Bogs, which makes travelling there to Strangers dangerous. The Air is cool and piercing; yet many of the Inhabitants live to a great Age. About the Summer Solstice they have so much Light all Night, that they can see to read by it. The Sun sets between Ten and Eleven at Night, and rises between One and Two in the Morning; and, on the other hand, the Day is so much shorter, and the Night longer in the Winter; which, with the Violence of the Tides, and the Tempestuousness of the Seas, deprives them of all foreign Correspondence from <HI>October</HI> to <HI>April,</HI> during which Time they know nothing of what passes in the other Parts of the World. A known Instance of this was, that tho' the Revolution happened to begin in <HI>November,</HI> they knew nothing of it till the <HI>May</HI> following, when a Fisherman, who arrived there, told them of it; and then they imprisoned him, in order to try him for spreading such News.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="295"/>They are much subject to the Scurvy, by eating too much Fish; but Nature has furnished them with great Quantities of Scurvygrass for an Antidote. They have little Corn of their own Growth, and therefore import great Quantities from <HI>Orkney.</HI> Their common Drink is Whey, which they barrel up, and keep in cold Cellars; this makes it very strong, so that it quickly turns their Heads. Some of them keep for their Drink Butter-milk mixed with Water, and this they call <HI>Bland.</HI> The better Sort have good Beer and Ale, of which they are very liberal to Strangers. They have abundance of the Fish of all Sorts on their Coasts for most Part of the Year: those that abound most are Cod, Ling, and Herring. They have also Shell-fish of all Sorts, with Whales, Seals, Sea-calves, and Otters; and in the Winter-time they burn Oil of Fish instead of Candle. They abound with all Sorts of Fowl, except Heath-cocks; and other Fowls which fre∣quent Heaths, will not live there when brought thi∣ther, tho' they have abundance of Heath. They have Store of Geese, and many Sorts of Ducks. They have Plenty of little Horses, which they call <HI>Schelties,</HI> very fit for the Husbandman's Use, and pace naturally. They make coarse Cloth, Stockens, and knit Gloves for their own Use, and also for Sale to the <HI>Norwegians.</HI> Their Grain is Oats and Big, but most of the latter. They have abundance of Black Cattle and Sheep. Their Ewes are very pro∣lifick, and for the most part bring forth two, and sometimes three Lambs at once. Their Fewel is Turf, Peat, and Heath. Their chief Trade of Export consists in Fish, by the Produce of which they pay their Rent, and purchase Necessaries. Their native Language is old <HI>Gothick,</HI> or <HI>German,</HI> as was also that of <HI>Orkney</HI>; but they generally now speak <HI>English.</HI> In their Customs and Habit they much resemble the <HI>Germans,</HI> but the better Sort
<PB N="295" REF="296"/>
imitate the <HI>Scots Lowlanders.</HI> Their Religion is Protestant, and they are generally, as well as the <HI>Orkney-men,</HI> very devout. There were few or no Presbyterians in these Parts before the Year 1700. when new Missionaries came, and ejected the old Clergy; yet the People did not care to hear them, so long as they had any body else. They make use of no Physicians; and if at any time they receive Wounds, they cure themselves. There are two little Towns in this Island; the first and oldest is <HI>Scalloway,</HI> on the West-side of the Island, where there is a Castle four Stories high: the Inhabitants are about an hundred in Number. The second and largest is <HI>Lerwick,</HI> which by their Fishing-trade is increased now to about three hundred Families.</P>
<P>There are several antient Monuments in these Islands, and particularly those called <HI>Picts Houses,</HI> which we have not room to insist upon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch, Hamburghers,</HI> &amp;c. come hither to fish in <HI>June,</HI> and go away again in <HI>August</HI> and <HI>September</HI>; and sometimes there are two thousand Busses fishing in <HI>Brassa</HI>'s Sound at once.</P>
<P>The most remarkable of the other Islands here, are, ZEAL, commonly called YELL, eighteen Miles long, and nine broad: it has three Churches, and several Chapels. And,</P>
<P>Farther North lies VUIST, much of the same Dimensions, plain, pleasant to the Eye, fruitful, and well inhabited. It is the pleasantest of the <HI>Shetland</HI> Isles, has three Churches, and as many Harbours. The Inhabitants say, no Cats will live in it.</P>
<P>TRONDA lies over-against <HI>Scalloway</HI>; it is three Miles long, and two broad.</P>
<P>A little North-east lies WALSEY, three Miles long, and as many broad.</P>
<P>On the East of <HI>Brassa</HI>'s Sound lies GREAT RULE, eight Miles long, and two broad: it has a good Harbour.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="297"/>Six Leagues West from <HI>The Main-land</HI> lies FOULA, three Miles in Length.</P>
<P>More to the East lies BRASA, five Miles long, and two broad: it has some arable Ground, and two Churches.</P>
<P>BURRAY is three Miles long, has good Pasturage, abounds with Fish on the Coast, and has a Church in it. No Mice will live here; and, 'tis said, they forsake the Place, where-ever the Earth of it is brought.</P>
<P><HI>Shetland</HI> is divided into twelve Parishes; but there are many more Churches and Chapels in it. This Country, like <HI>Orkney,</HI> has no Wood in it; but they have some Fish and Fowl peculiar to them∣selves. The Inhabitants are very bold in venturing to Sea at all Seasons for Fish, and in climbing the Rocks for Fowl.</P>
<P>It has been debated among the Learned, whether these Islands, the <HI>Orcades,</HI> or the North-east Coast of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was the THULE of the Antients; but we have not room to give an Account of the Argu∣ments for the several Hypotheses, nor to consider which of them are most conclusive; tho' it ought to be observed, that Sir <HI>Robert Sibbald</HI> has in a man∣ner demonstrated, that the North-eastern Parts of <HI>Scotland</HI> were what the Antients called so. For thus speaks <HI>Claudian,</HI> of <HI>Theodosius,</HI> Father of the Emperor of that Name:
<Q><L><HI>Ille Caledoniis posuit qui castra pruinis.</HI></L>
<L><HI>— Maduerunt Saxone fuso</HI></L>
<L><HI>Orcades, incaluit Pictorum sanguine Thule,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Scotorum cumulos flevit glacialis Ierne.</HI></L></Q><Q><L>In <HI>Caledonian</HI> Frosts encamp'd he stood,</L>
<L>When <HI>Orkney</HI> Isles were dy'd with <HI>Saxon</HI> Blood:</L>
<L>Then THULE with the <HI>Pictish</HI> Gore grew hot,</L>
<L>Icy <HI>Strathern</HI> bemoan'd each slaughter'd <HI>Scot.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="298"/><HI>Silius Italicus</HI> takes notice, in <HI>Thule,</HI> of a Custom well known among the antient <HI>Britons</HI> and <HI>Cale∣donians:</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Coerulus haud aliter cum dimicat incola Thules,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Agmina falcifero circumvenit acta covino.</HI></L></Q><Q><L>So, when the azure Son of <HI>Thule</HI> wars,</L>
<L>He circles Armies driv'n in pointed Cars.</L></Q></P>
<P>The chief Families in <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Shetland</HI> are the <HI>Bruces, Sinclairs, Mouats, Nivets, Chyneys, Stuarts, Grahams, Moodies, Dowglasses, Honeymans, Trails, Bakies, Southerlands, Craigies, Youngs, Buchanans, &amp;c.</HI> But the most antient, and, I may say, original, are the <HI>Fletts, Hackrews, Richens, Feas, Skolas, Grottes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the Mouth of the River FORTH lie seve∣ral Islands, the most considerable of which is the MAY: it was formerly dedicated to St. <HI>Adrian,</HI> who was martyred there by the <HI>Danes,</HI> and afterwards a religious Place was built in Memory of him. The Monks gave out, that barren Women, who came thither annually to worship at St. <HI>Adrian</HI>'s Shrine, would thereby be cured of their Barrenness; and it was frequented upon that Account by Women in the Popish Times. But whether St. <HI>Adrian</HI> or the Monks had the most Influence in curing their Bar∣renness, I determine not. Yet that fond, silly Per∣suasion obtained so much Credit, that <HI>Wood,</HI> of <HI>Largo,</HI> who was a noted Sea Captain, had a Charter of several Lands from King <HI>James</HI> IV. to be in Readiness upon Call to attend his Majesty and the Queen while they visited St. <HI>Adrian.</HI> This Island is a Mile long from North to South, and about a Quarter of a Mile broad: it lies seven Miles from
<PB N="298" REF="299"/>
the Coast of <HI>Fife,</HI> has a fresh-water Spring, and a small Lake. There grows no Corn here; but in the Summer it affords Pasturage for an hundred Sheep, and twenty Black Cattle. The West-side is inaccessible, because of high Rocks; but the East∣side is plain, and has four Places where Boats may arrive, one of them a safe Harbour for Ships during a strong West Wind. Fish of all Sorts are numerous on the Coast of this Island, and it abounds with Fowl, particularly those called Skarts, Dunters, Gulls, Scouts, and Kittawaax; the latter is about the Size of a Dove, and in <HI>July</HI> is prefer'd to a Par∣tridge. The Scouts are somewhat less than a Duck, but their Eggs are larger than those of a Goose, and being boiled hard, eat very well with Vinegar and Parsley. This Island of <HI>May</HI> formerly belonged to the Priory of <HI>Pittenweem,</HI> but was granted in Fee by King <HI>Charles</HI> I. to <HI>Cunningham</HI> of <HI>Barns,</HI> with Liberty to build a Light-house there for the Benefit of Ships; for the Maintenance of which they were to allow 2<HI>d. per</HI> Tun. A Tower of 40 Foot high is built there for that End, with a Fire every Night; and the first Builder was cast away, in returning from thence to his House in <HI>Fife,</HI> by a Tempest which some poor old Women were executed for raising.</P>
<P>The BASS lies next; but I have given an Account of it already.</P>
<P>Higher up in the <HI>Forth</HI> lies INCHKEITH, betwixt <HI>Fife</HI> and <HI>Lothian,</HI> a Mile and a half long, and about half a Mile broad: the Soil is fat, and produces good Grass, and abundance of physical Herbs. It has four fresh-water Springs, and as many Harbours, one towards each Quarter: it rises in the Middle, and has a strong Stone Fort raised upon it by Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> There is a Stone Quarry here, which sends forth a strong sulphurous Smell, when any Pieces are broken off, but very fit for Building. There are
<PB N="299" REF="300"/>
great Shoals of Fish round the Coasts of this Island, and abundance of Oysters during the Winter. This Island had its Name from the noble Family of <HI>Keith,</HI> whose Founder had this Island, with the Barony of <HI>Ceith-mareschal</HI> in <HI>Lothian,</HI> and the Hereditary Dig∣nity of Earl Mareschal of <HI>Scotland</HI> conferr'd upon him by King <HI>Malcolm</HI> II. in the Year 1010. for his Valour in the Battle against the <HI>Danes</HI> at <HI>Bar</HI> in <HI>Angus.</HI> It came afterwards to the Crown, and was given by King <HI>Robert</HI> II. to <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Lyon</HI> of <HI>Glames,</HI> the Chief of that Family, with the Barony of <HI>Kinghorn,</HI> upon his marrying that Prince's Daughter. It is since in other Hands. It is observed, that Horses grow fat here in a little time.</P>
<P>Higher up, within two Miles of <HI>Aberdour,</HI> lies an Island, called ST. COLM'S INCH, as being dedicated to St. <HI>Columba:</HI> it had formerly a famous Abbey, with large Endowments, but it is now ruined; and upon the Alienation of Abbey Lands, was given to the Lord <HI>Downs,</HI> a Branch of the Family of <HI>Stuart.</HI></P>
<P>Higher up lies INCHGARVY, between two Pro∣montories, near the <HI>Queen's Ferry</HI>; it was also fortified, and the Guns of the Forts could reach the Shore or both Sides, so that no Ships could safely pass it without Leave.</P>
<P>On the Top of an high rocky Hill, at the West∣end of the Islands of <HI>Orkney,</HI> near the Village of <HI>Skeal,</HI> there is a sort of Pavement consisting of Stones variously figured, some like an Heart, others like a Crown, a Leg, a Weaver's Shuttle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It takes up above a Quarter of a Mile in Length, and from 20 to 30 Feet in Breadth. In removing any of these Stones, the Figure is as neat on the Under∣side, as the Upper, and being as big as the Life, all of one Colour, or a reddish Kind of Stone, pitched in a reddish Earth, and the Pavemen so very long, it cannot be any of the tessellated or chequer'd
<PB N="300" REF="301"/>
Works of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Part of a Garden Wall is decorated with these Stones, and many of them are taken away by the neighbouring Gentry, to set them up like <HI>Dutch</HI> Tiles in their Chimneys; so that, at this rate, in less than a Century, this Pavement will in all likelihood subsist only in Books.</P>
<P>It has been long observed, that the Islands of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> especially the Western, lie more conveniently for carrying on, and bringing the Fishing-trade to Perfection, than any other Parts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> I. began the Experiment, in Con∣junction with a Company of Merchants; but that Design miscarried by the Civil War, which unhappily broke out at that Time. The next At∣tempt was made by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. who also joined with some Merchants; and this succeeded well for a Time. Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> assures us, from such as saw the Fish that were caught by that Company, that they were reputed the best in <HI>Europe</HI> of their Kind, and accordingly bore a greater Price. But this Design was ruin'd thus: The King having Occasion for Money, was advised to withdraw that which was employ'd in the Fishery; at which the Merchants being displeased, and disagreeing likewise among themselves, they also withdrew their Money, and that Design has never been renewed since that Time.</P>
<P>But the Revival of this Undertaking will, in all Probability, be one of the Blessings which this Island will reap by the late happy Union. What can't <HI>English</HI> Money, and <HI>Scotish</HI> Industry, effect!</P>
<P>The settling a Fishery in those Parts will raise a Nursery of stout and able Seamen in a very short time, to serve the Government on all Occasions. A new Colony need not be planted there; for the Inhabitants of the <HI>Western Isles</HI> are reckoned to be about 50,000; many of whom have no Employ∣ment, and are generally dextrous at the Oar, and
<PB N="301" REF="302"/>
only want to be furnished with proper Materials for the Fishing-trade, which would encourage the setting up other Manufactures. The Commodious∣ness and Safety of the numerous Bays and Harbours in those Isles seem as if Nature had designed them for promoting Trade. They have such abundance of Turf and Peat for Fewel, as would furnish Salt-pans with Fire all the Year round. The Coast of each Island affords many thousand Loads of Sea-ware, which, if preserved, might be successfully used for making Glass, and likewise Kelp for Soap. Several of the Islands afford great Quantities of fine Clay; which, if improved, might turn to a good Account in making Earthen-ware of all Sorts. Cod and Ling, as well as lesser Fish, are to be had on the Coasts of the lesser as well as the greater Islands; and what has been said of the <HI>Western Isles,</HI> may be said likewise of the Isles of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Shetland.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus concluded our Tour thro' the whole Island, we shall, in order to render the same more complete, subjoin the following Articles, respecting as well the <HI>Southern</HI> as <HI>Northern</HI> Parts thereof; and begin first with the following</P>
