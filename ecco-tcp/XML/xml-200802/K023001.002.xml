<HEAD>TO Mr. POPE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT great Philosopher, and Honour of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, the Lord Chancellor <HI>Bacon,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his <HI>Essay</HI> on <HI>Deformity.</HI></NOTE> gives it us as his Opinion, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That <HI>Deformed Persons</HI> are commonly <HI>even</HI> with <HI>Nature,</HI> for as <HI>Nature</HI> hath done <HI>ill</HI> by them, so <HI>do</HI> they by <HI>Nature,</HI> being for the most part (as the Scripture saith) <HI>void of natural Affection,</HI> and so they have Revenge of Nature. Certainly, there is a Consent between the Body and the Mind, and where <HI>Nature</HI> erreth in the one, she ventureth in the other;—<HI>Ubi</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="7"/>
<HI>peccat in uno, periclatur in altero.</HI> But because there is in Man an Election touch∣ing the Frame of his Mind, and a Ne∣cessity in the Frame of his Body; the Stars of natural Inclination are sometimes obscured by the Sun of Discipline and Virtue: Therefore it is good to consider <HI>Deformity,</HI> not as a Sign which is more deceivable, but as a Cause which seldom faileth of the Effect. Whosoever hath any thing fixed in his Person that doth induce Contempt, hath also a perpetual Spur in himself, to rescue and deliver himself from Scorn. Therefore all <HI>De∣formed Persons</HI> are extreme Bold. First, in their own Defence, as being exposed to Scorn; but in Process of Time, by a Ge∣neral Habit. Also it stirreth in them In∣dustry, and especially of this kind, to watch and observe the Weakness of others, that they may have somewhat to repay. Again, in their Superiors, it quencheth Jealousy towards them, as Persons that they think they may at Pleasure despise; and it layeth their Competitors and Emu∣lators asleep, as never believing they should be in a Possibility of Advance∣ment, till they see them in Possession; so that upon the Matter, in a great Wit, <HI>Deformity</HI> is an Advantage to rising; Kings in antient Times (and at this present in
<PB N="vii" REF="8" MS="y"/>
some Countries) were wont to put great Trust in <HI>Eunuchs;</HI> because they that are envious towards All, are more obnoxious and officious towards One. But yet their Trust towards them hath rather been as to good Spyals, and good Whisperers, than good Magistrates and Officers; and much like is the Reason of <HI>Deformed Persons.</HI> Still the Ground is, they will, if they be of Spirit, seek to free themselves from Scorn, which must be either by Virtue or Malice; and therefore, let it not be marvelled, if sometimes they prove ex∣cellent Persons; as was <HI>Agesilaus, Zanger</HI> the Son of <HI>Solyman, Aesop, Gasca,</HI> Presi∣dent of <HI>Peru;</HI> and <HI>Socrates</HI> may go like∣wise amongst them; with others.'</Q></P>
<P>His Lordship observes, that these Men were Instances of the most exalted Virtue; but I wish I was not obliged to say, that You are a Precedent of the most depraved Vice. For a Demonstration of which, I shall regularly proceed, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>You very well know, Sir, that in the Year 1717, when the <HI>Court-Poems,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Basset-Table,</HI> The <HI>Toilet,</HI> and The <HI>Drawing-Room</HI>) were published, upon your sending for me to the <HI>Swan-Tavern</HI> in <HI>Fleet∣street,</HI> in Company with Mr. <HI>Lintot,</HI> and en∣quiring into the Publication of that Pam∣phlet, I then frankly told you, that those
<PB N="viii" REF="9" MS="y"/>
Pieces, were by Mr. <HI>Joseph Jacobs,</HI> a Dis∣senting Teacher, given to Mr. <HI>John Old∣mixon,</HI> who sent the same to be published by Mr. <HI>James Roberts</HI> in <HI>Warwick-Lane;</HI> and that my Neighbour Mr. <HI>Pemberton,</HI> and <HI>myself,</HI> had each of us a Share, with Mr. <HI>Oldmixon,</HI> in the said Pamphlet. For this you were pleased to treat me, with half a Pint of Canary, antimonially prepared; for the emetic Effects of which, it has been the Opinion of all Mankind, you de∣served the Stab. My Purgation was soon over, but yours will last (without a timely Repentance) till, as the <HI>Ghost</HI> says in <HI>Ham∣let; with all your Imperfections on your Head you are called to your Accompt; and your Of∣fences purged by Fire.</HI> Yet notwithstanding your Behaviour to me, in turning this Mat∣ter into Ridicule, and making me the Sub∣ject of several of your Libels, all which I have equally despised, I made you an Offer of Reconciliation, tho' You yourself was the Aggressor.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Evidenced by my Letter of the 22d of March last.</NOTE></P>
<P>You were by me acquainted, that you had disobliged a Gentleman, the Initials of whose Name were <HI>P.T.</HI> who to shew his Resentment, was resolved to publish a large Collection of your Letters. To this
<PB N="ix" REF="10"/>
you thought fit, suitable to your former Behaviour, to return me a very imperti∣nent and false Answer, (in the <HI>Grubstreet Journal, Daily Journal,</HI> and <HI>Daily Post Boy</HI>) that you believed the whole to be a <HI>Forgery,</HI> and should not trouble yourself at all about it. In the last of which Papers, on the 5th of <HI>April,</HI> I gave you a full Re∣ply, to which it was not in your Power to rejoin. What Steps were afterwards taken in this Affair, I shall impartially relate.</P>
<P><HI>P.T.</HI> (from whom I had not heard in two Years before) wrote me a Letter, that you should soon be convinced of your Mi∣stake, and being indisposed himself, ap∣pointed <HI>R.S.</HI> to be his Agent. <HI>An Ac∣count of which whole Transaction</HI> I have laid before the Public in the <HI>Initial Correspon∣dence.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the 2d. Volume of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Letters, &amp;c. Printed by Mr. <HI>Curll.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>On the 12th of <HI>May</HI> last I published the said Collection of your Letters, and on the same Day, upon your being told by a Gen∣tleman, who saw you in the Court of Re∣quests at <HI>Westminster,</HI> that it was pretty plain the Letters published were no <HI>Forgeries;</HI> you very pertly reply'd, <HI>so much the worse.</HI>

But you have met a <HI>Second</HI> Defeat before that most August Assembly, as you did in your <HI>first</HI> Attack, relating to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s Works.</P>
<Q><L>Therefore, confess you have a <HI>Tartar</HI> caught,</L>
<L>Be, once, sincere; and frankly own your Fault.</L></Q>
<P>You say, Sir, <HI>It will be but Justice to you, to believe, that nothing more is yours</HI> than what you have owned, <HI>notwithstanding all that hath been publish'd in your Name, or ad∣ded to your Miscellanies since 1717, by any Bookseller whatsoever.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Your Booksellers <HI>ab origine</HI> are indeed pretty numerous, <HI>viz.

<PB REF="18"/>
<HEAD>A True NARRATIVE of the Method by which Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s Letters have been published.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T has been judged, that to clear an Af∣fair which seemed at first sight a little my∣sterious, and which, tho' it concerned only <HI>one Gentleman</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr <HI>Pope</HI> is the Son of a Trader, and so is Mr <HI>Curll—par nobile.</HI></NOTE>, is of such a Con∣sequence, as justly to alarm every Person in the Nation, would not only be ac∣ceptable as a <HI>Curiosity,</HI> but useful as a <HI>Warning,</HI> and perhaps flagrant enough as an <HI>Example,</HI> to induce the LEGISLATURE to prevent for the future, an Enormity so prejudicial to every private Subject, and so destructive of Society itself.</P>
<P>This will be made so plain by the ensuing Papers, that it will scarce be needful to attend them with any Reflexi∣ons, more than what every Reader may make.</P>
<P>In the Year 1727, <HI>Edmund Curll,</HI> Bookseller, publish∣ed a Collection of several private Letters of Mr <HI>Pope</HI> to <HI>Henry Cromwell,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> which he obtained in this Manner.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Cromwell</HI> was acquainted with one Mrs <HI>Thomas,</HI> to whom he had the Indiscretion to lend these Letters, and who falling into Misfortunes seven Years after, sold them to Mr <HI>Curll,</HI> without the Consent either of Mr <HI>Pope</HI> or Mr <HI>Cromwell</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">These Letters were a free Gift; so that there was not any Occasion to ask the Consent of either of those Parties. Mr <HI>Curll</HI> purchased them as justly as Mr <HI>Lintot</HI> did the Copy of Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Homer,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>. [See the Letters in the Preface to <HI>Vol.</HI> I.]</P>
<P>This Treatment being extreamly disagreeable to Mr <HI>Pope,</HI> he was advised to re-call any Letters which might happen to be preserved by any of his Friends, particularly those written to Persons deceased, which would be most subject to such an Accident. Many of these were returned him.</P>
<P>Some of his Friends advised him to print a Collection himself, to prevent a worse; but this <HI>he would by no means</HI>
<PB N="ii" REF="19" MS="y"/>
<HI>agree to</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is a notorious Falshood, for it will be proved that the Books sold by <HI>R.S.</HI> to Mr <HI>Curll,</HI> were printed at Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s Expence.</NOTE>. However, as some of the Letters served to revive several past Scenes of Friendship, and others to clear the Truth of <HI>Facts</HI> in which he had been misrepresented by the common Scriblers, he was induced to preserve a few of his own Letters, as well as of his Friends. These, as I have been told, he inserted in Two Books, some Originals, others Copies, with a few Notes and Extracts here and there added. In the same Books he causes to be copied some small Pieces in Verse and Prose, either of his own, or his Correspondents; which, tho' not finished enough for the Public, were such as the Partiality of any Friend would be sorry to be deprived of.</P>
<P>To this Purpose, an Amanuensis or two were employed by Mr <HI>Pope,</HI> when the Books were in the Country, and by the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> when they were in Town.</P>
<P>It happened soon after, that the <HI>Posthumous Works</HI> of Mr <HI>Wycherley</HI> were published, in such a Manner, as could no way increase the Reputation of that Gentleman, who had been Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s first Correspondent and Friend; and several of these Letters so fully shewed the State of that Case, that it was thought but a Justice to Mr <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s Memory to print a few, to discredit that Imposition. These were accordingly transcribed for the Press from the <HI>Manuscript Books</HI> above-mentioned.</P>
<P>They were no sooner printed but <HI>Edmund Curll</HI> looked on these too as his Property; for a Copy is extant, which he corrected in order for another Impression, interlin'd, and added marginal Notes to, in his own Hand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is another Falshood, Mr <HI>Curll</HI> only gave a Copy of this Pamphlet to <HI>R.S.</HI> to shew <HI>P.T.</HI> that he had reprinted those Letters which came out in 1728, and corrected the <HI>Errata</HI> therein.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He then advertised a-new the Letters to Mr <HI>Cromwell,</HI> with <HI>Additions,</HI> and promis'd Encouragement to all Per∣sons who should send him more<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Falshood the <HI>Third.</HI> Mr <HI>Curll</HI> defies any Man living to produce any such Advertisement.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This is a Practice frequent with Booksellers, to swell an Author's Works, in which they have some Property, with any Trash that can be got from any Hand; or where they have no such Works, to procure some. <HI>Curll</HI> has in the same manner since advertised the <HI>Letters</HI> of
<PB N="iii" REF="20"/>
Mr <HI>Prior,</HI> and Mr <HI>Addison.</HI> A Practice highly deserving some Check from the Legislature; since every such Adver∣tisement, is really a <HI>Watch-word</HI> to every <HI>Scoundrel</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">None can be more a <HI>Scoundrel</HI> than the Writer of this Narrative, as the many Falshoods detected in it will prove.</NOTE> in the Nation, and to every <HI>Domestic</HI> of a Family, to get a Penny, by producing any Scrap of a Man's Writing, (of what Nature soever) or by picking his Master's Pocket of Letters and Papers.</P>
<P>A most flagrant Instance of this kind was the Adver∣tisement of an intended Book, called <HI>Gulliveriana Secunda;</HI> where it was promis'd, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that <HI>any Thing,</HI> which <HI>any Body</HI> should send as Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s, or Dr <HI>Swift</HI>'s, should be printed and inserted <HI>as Theirs.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>By these honest means, Mr <HI>Curll</HI> went on increasing his Collection<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Stupid Impertinence! what has Mr <HI>Curll</HI> to do with Dean <HI>Smedley</HI>'s Book called <HI>Gulliveriana?</HI> or with the Conduct of any other Person? nor was Mr <HI>Curll</HI> any ways concern'd in printing <HI>Gulliveriana.</HI></NOTE>; and finding (as will be seen hereafter) a farther Prospect of doing so, he retarded his Edition of Mr <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Letters, till the 22d of <HI>March,</HI> 1734-5, and then sent Mr <HI>Pope</HI> the following Letter, the first he ever received from him<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">A greater Favour than Mr <HI>Pope</HI> deserved at his Hands.</NOTE>.</P>

The <HI>Inclosed</HI> were two Scraps of Paper, supposed to be <HI>P.T.</HI>'s (a feigned Hand) the first containing this Adver∣tisement.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">LEtters of <HI>Alexander Pope,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and several eminent Hands. From the Year 1705, to 1727.

Curll</HI>'s when the Book is publish'd.</Q></P>
<P>The other Paper was a Scrap of some Letter in the same Hand, which expressed <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a Dissatisfaction at <HI>Curll</HI> for not having printed his Advertisement."</Q>—What more cannot be seen, for the rest is cut off close to the Writing.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s Friends imagin'd that the whole Design of <HI>E. Curll</HI> was to get him but to look on the Edition of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Letters, and so to print it as <HI>revis'd</HI> by Mr <HI>Pope</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doubtless that was Mr <HI>Curll</HI>'s Intent, or he need not have acquainted Mr <HI>Pope</HI> with his Design of printing a new Edition.</NOTE>, in the same manner as he sent an <HI>obscene Book</HI> to a <HI>Reverend Bishop,</HI> and then advertis'd it as <HI>corrected</HI> and <HI>revis'd</HI> by him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Falshood the <HI>Fourth.</HI> One hundred Guineas shall be paid to this Nar∣rative-Writer if he can produce any such Advertisement of Mr <HI>Curll</HI>'s. This is founded on a merry Story, and the Fact as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Mr <HI>Henry Hoare,</HI> eldest Son of Sir <HI>Richard Hoare,</HI> came to Mr <HI>Curll</HI> and told him, that Dr <HI>Robinson,</HI> then Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> heard he was concern'd in printing an Edition of the Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI>'s Poems. Mr <HI>Curll</HI> told Mr <HI>Hoare,</HI> that he was, among other Bookssellers and Printers, (<HI>viz.</HI> Mr <HI>Darby,</HI> in <HI>Bartholomew-Close,</HI> Mr <HI>Bettesworth,</HI> in <HI>Pater-noster-row,</HI> Mr <HI>Rivington,</HI> in <HI>St Paul's Church-yard,</HI> Mr <HI>Pemberton,</HI> in <HI>Fleet-street,</HI> &amp;c.) concerned in an Edition of that Nobleman's Works. But likewise told Mr <HI>Hoare,</HI> that he would get a Book interleav'd for my Lord Bishop, and whatever his Lordship saw amiss, if he would be pleased to strike out any Lines, or Poems therein, such Leaves should be re-printed, and render'd conformable to his Lordship's Opinion. Away goes Mr <HI>Hoare,</HI> overjoy'd with this Message from Mr <HI>Curll,</HI> with a tender of his Duty to the Bishop, and opens his Credentials; upon hearing which the Bishop smil'd, and made the following Reply to Mr <HI>Hoare.</HI> Sir, I am told that Mr <HI>Curll</HI> is a shrewd Man, and should I revise the Book you have brought me, he would publish it as approv'd by me. This no doubt Mr <HI>Curll</HI> might justly have done, for what∣ever is not condemn'd is approv'd; a Standing-Maxim This, in Civil, Canon, and Common Law.</P></NOTE>. Or if there was any such Proposal from
<PB N="v" REF="22" MS="y"/>
<HI>P.T. Curll</HI> would not fail to embrace it, perhaps pay for the Copy with the very Money he might draw from Mr <HI>P—</HI> to suppress it, and say <HI>P.T.</HI> had kept another Copy. He therefore answer'd the only way he thought it safe to correspond with him, by a public Advertisement in the <HI>Daily Post-Boy</HI> [<HI>Daily Journal,</HI> and <HI>Grub-street Journal</HI>].</P>
<P><HI>E. Curll</HI> return'd an impertinent Answer<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">It was universally allow'd to be a very pertinent one.</NOTE> in the same Paper the next Day, denying that he <HI>endeavour'd to corre∣spond with Mr</HI> P. and affirming that he wrote by <HI>Directi∣on,</HI> but declaring that he would <HI>instantly print the said Col∣lection.</HI> In a few Days more he publish'd the <HI>Advertise∣ment of the Book</HI> as above, with this Addition, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>E.C.</HI> as before in the like Case, will be faithful."</Q></P>
<P>He now talk'd of it every where, said <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That <HI>P.T.</HI> was a LORD<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This is false: <HI>E.P.</HI> is a Nobleman, <HI>P.T.</HI> is a Scrub.</NOTE>, or a PERSON of CONSEQUENCE, who printed the Book at a <HI>great Expence,</HI> and sought no Profit, but <HI>Revenge</HI> on Mr <HI>Pope, who had offended him:</HI>"</Q> particularly, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That some of the Letters would be such as both <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State would take Notice of;</HI> but that <HI>P.T.</HI> would by no means be known in it, that he never would once be <HI>seen</HI> by him, but treated in a very <HI>secret Manner.</HI>"</Q> He told some Persons that sifted him in this Affair, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he had convers'd only with his Agent, a Clergyman of the Name of <HI>Smith,</HI> who came, as he said, from <HI>Southwark.</HI>"</Q> With this Person it was that <HI>Curll</HI> transacted the Affair, who before all the Letters of the Book were deliver'd to <HI>Curll,</HI> in∣sisted on the Letters of <HI>P.T.</HI> being return'd him, to se∣cure him from all possibility of a Discovery, as appears from a following Letter.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Pope,</HI> on hearing of this <HI>Smith,</HI> and finding when the Book came out, that several of the Letters could only have come from the <HI>Manuscript Book</HI> before-mentioned, publish'd this Advertisement.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">WHEREAS a Person who signs himself <HI>P.T.</HI> and another who writes himself <HI>R. Smith,</HI> and passes for a Clergyman, have transacted for some time past with

<P>I Have not ever met with any thing more inconsistent than the several Proposals of your Letters. The first bearing Date <HI>Oct.</HI> 11th, 1733, gives some Particulars of Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Life,</HI> which I shall shortly make a public Use of, in his Life now going to the Press.</P>
<P>The second of your Letters of <HI>Nov.</HI> 15th, 1733, in∣forms me, That if I would publish an Advertisement of a Collection of Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s Letters in your Custody, the Originals should be forthwith sent me, and for which you would expect no more than what would pay for a Tran∣script of 'em.</P>
<P>In your third Letter of the fourth Instant, you ground∣lessly imagine I have attempted to betray you to Mr <HI>Pope;</HI> say, you have printed these Letters yourself, and now want to be handsomely allow'd for the Copy, <HI>viz.</HI> 3 <HI>l.</HI> a Score, which is 2 <HI>l.</HI> more than they cost printing; appoint a Meeting at the <HI>Rose</HI> on the 22d Instant, where I was to

I fear no such Be∣settings either of him or his Agents. That the paying of Seventy five Pounds would bring you to Town in a Fortnight, would I be so silly as to declare it. By your last Letter, of last Night, a Gentleman is to be at my Door at 8 this Evening, who has full Commission from you.</P>
<P>You want seventy five Pounds for a Person you would serve; that Sum I can easily pay, if I think the Purchase would be of any Service to me. But in one Word, Sir, I am engaged all this Evening, and shall not give myself any further Trouble about such jealous, groundless, and dark Negotiations. An HONOURABLE and OPEN DEALING is what I have been always used to, and if you will come into such a Method, I will meet you any where, or shall be glad to see you at my own House, other∣wise apply to whom you please.</P>

<PB N="xiv" REF="31"/>
3. I did not own the Books came from <HI>a-cross the Water,</HI> nor ever <HI>nam'd you,</HI> all I said was, that the Books came <HI>by Water.</HI> 4. When the Books were seiz'd I sent my Son to convey a Letter to you, and as you told me every body knew you in <HI>Southwark,</HI> I bid him make a <HI>strict Enquiry,</HI> as I am sure you wou'd have done in such an Exigency. 5. Sir I HAVE ACTED JUSTLY in this Affair, and that is what I shall always think wisely. 6. I will be kept no longer in the dark: <HI>P.T.</HI> is <HI>Will o' the Wisp;</HI> all the Books I have had are imperfect; the first 50 had no Titles nor Prefaces, the last five Bundles seiz'd by the Lords contain'd but 38 in each Bundle, which amounts to 190, and 50, is in all but 240 Books. 7. As to the Loss of a future Copy, I despise it, nor will I be concern'd with any more such dark suspicious Dealers. But now, Sir, I'll tell you what I will do; when I have the Books per∣fected which I have already receiv'd, and the rest of the Impression, I will pay you for them. But what do you call this Usage? First take a Note for a Month, and then want it to be chang'd for one of Sir <HI>Richard Hoare</HI>'s—My Note is as good, for any Sum I give it, as the BANK, and shall be as punctually paid. I always say, <HI>Gold is better than Paper,</HI> and 20 <HI>l.</HI> I will pay if the Books are perfect to-morrow Morning, and the rest sent, or to Night is the same thing to me. But if this dark Converse goes on, I will instantly <HI>reprint the whole Book,</HI> and as a Supplement to it, <HI>all the Letters</HI> P.T. <HI>ever sent me,</HI> of which I have <HI>exact Copies;</HI> together with <HI>all your Originals,</HI> and give them in upon Oath to my Lord-Chancellor. You talk of <HI>Trust; P.T.</HI> has not repos'd any in me, for he has my Money and Notes for im∣perfect Books. Let me see, Sir, either <HI>P.T.</HI> or your∣self, or you'll find the <HI>Scots</HI> Proverb verify'd: <Q><L>Nemo me impune lacessit.</L></Q></P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN pursuance to your Advertisement de∣siring such Accounts of Mr <HI>Pope as his Deserts demand,</HI> I send you these <HI>Anecdotes,</HI> the Truth of which I can testify (and will, if called upon) as having been his School∣fellow my self at the time.</P>
<P>The fact is very remarkable, as it is a proof of that <HI>natural spleen</HI> which consti∣tutes his <HI>Temperament,</HI> and from which he has never deviated in the whole course of his Life.</P>
<P>The last School he was put to, before the twelfth Year of his Age, was in <HI>De∣vonshire-Street</HI> near <HI>Bloomsbury,</HI> there I also was, and the late Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> at the same time. It was kept by one <HI>Bromley,</HI> a <HI>Popish Renegado,</HI> who had been a Par∣son, and was one of <HI>King James's</HI> Con∣verts in <HI>Oxford,</HI> some Years after that Prince's Abdication; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Name was <HI>William Bromley,</HI> Son of <HI>Henry Brom∣ley,</HI> of <HI>Holt</HI> in <HI>Worcestershire</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> He was entered a Gen∣tleman-Commoner of Christ-Church-College, <HI>Oxon,</HI> 1673.

him, he went a <HI>Travelling-Tutor</HI> to the present Lord <HI>Gage.</HI></P>
<P>Mr <HI>Alexander Pope</HI> before he had been four Months at this School (or was able to construe <HI>Tully's Offices</HI>) employed his Muse in satirizing his Master. It was a Libel of at least one hundred Verses, which a Fellow-Student having given information of, was found in his pocket, and the young Satirist was soundly whipp'd, and kept a Prisoner to his Room seven days; where∣upon his Father fetch'd him away, and I have been told, he never went to School more.</P>
<P>How much <HI>past Correction</HI> has wrought upon him, the World is Judge; and how much <HI>present</HI> Correction might, may be collected from this sample. I thought it a curious Fact, and therefore it is at your service, as one of the Ornaments of this excellent Person's Life.</P>

<SALUTE>Mr CURLL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UNderstanding you propose to write the Life of Mr <HI>Pope,</HI> this is only to inform you I can send you divers Memoirs which may be serviceable, if your design be really to do him neither Injustice nor shew him Favour.</P>
<P>I was well acquainted with his Father, and with the first part of his own Life, tho' since he hath treated me as a Stran∣ger.</P>
<P>It is certain some late Pamphlets are not fair in respect to his Father. He was of the younger Branch of a Family in good repute in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and related to the Lord <HI>Downe,</HI> formerly of the same Name. He was as he hath told Me himself, [and he was very different from his Son, a modest and plain honest Man] a Posthumous Son, and left little provided for, his elder Bro∣ther having what small Estate there was, who afterwards studied and died at <HI>Ox∣ford.</HI> He was put to a Merchant in <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> and acquired a moderate Fortune by Merchandize, which he quitted, at the Re∣volution, in very good Circumstances, and retired to <HI>Windsor-Forest,</HI> where he pur∣chased a small Estate, and took great de∣light
<PB N="9" REF="41"/>
in Husbandry and Gardens. His Mo∣ther was one of the seventeen Children of <HI>William Turnor,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> formerly of <HI>Burfit-Hall</HI> in the *** Riding of <HI>Yorkshire.</HI> Two of her Brothers were killed in the Civil-Wars.</P>
<P>This is a true Account of Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s Family and Parentage; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Oxford</HI> Antiquary informs us, that, <HI>Thomas Pope,</HI> the young Earl of <HI>Downe,</HI> died in St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s Parish in <HI>Oxford,</HI> 28 <HI>Dec.</HI> 1660, aged 38 Years leav∣ing behind him one only Daughter named <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who was first married to <HI>Henry-Francis Lee</HI> of <HI>Dich∣ley</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> and afterwards to <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Lindsey.</HI> The Earldom of <HI>Downe,</HI> went to <HI>Thomas Pope,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> his Uncle, who, likewise, leaving no Male-Issue, the Estate went away among <HI>Three</HI> Daughters; the <HI>Second</HI> of whom was married to Sir <HI>Francis North,</HI> afterwards Lord <HI>North</HI> of <HI>Guilford.</HI> Both these Earls of <HI>Downe</HI> were buried at <HI>Wroxton,</HI> near <HI>Banbury,</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire</HI> with their Ancestors.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Troubled you with a Line some time since, concerning your design of the Life of Mr <HI>Pope:</HI> to which I desired your Answer in <HI>the Daily Advertiser</HI> of <HI>Thursday</HI> the 18th. Inst. <HI>Oct.</HI> I do not intend my self any other Profit in it, than that of doing Justice to, and on, that Person, upon whom, Sir, you have constantly bestowed some Care, as well as Pains in the Course of your Life; and I intend him the like for his Conduct towards me.</P>
<P><HI>A propos,</HI> to his Life, there have lately fal∣len into my hands a large Collection of his Letters, from the former part of his Days till the Year 1727, which being more con∣siderable than any yet seen, and opening very many Scenes new to the World, will alone make a perfect and the most Au∣thentic Life and Memoirs of him that could be.</P>
<P>To show you my Sincerity and deter∣minate Resolution of assisting you herein,
<PB N="11" REF="43"/>
I will give you an Advertisement which you may publish, if you please, forthwith; and, on your so doing, the Letters shall be sent you. They will make a four of five Shilling Book; yet I expect no more than what will barely pay a Transcriber, that the Originals may be preserved in mine, or your Hands, to vouch the Truth of them.</P>
<P>I am of opinion these alone will contain his whole History (if you add to them, what you formerly printed of those to <HI>H. Cromwell,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>); but you must put out an <HI>Advertisement,</HI> for otherwise I shall not be justified, to some people who have in∣fluence, and on whom I have some De∣pendance; unless it seem to the public Eye as no entire Act of mine. But I may be justified and excused, if, after they see such a Collection is made by you, I acknow∣ledge I sent some Letters to contribute thereto.</P>
<P>They who know what has passed betwixt Mr <HI>Pope,</HI> and Me formerly, may otherwise think it dishonourable I should set such a Thing a-foot. Therefore print the Ad∣vertisement I here send you; and you shall instantly hear from, or see me.</P>

The old Gentleman, P.T. not calling upon me, I did not put the <HI>Advertisement,</HI> into any News-Paper, and this whole Transaction lay dormant near two Years. But upon regulating some Papers in my Scritoire, about the Close of <HI>March</HI> 1735, this <HI>Advertisement</HI> came to my Hands, and reflecting within my self that the Re∣sentment between Mr <HI>Pope</HI> and me, tho' from the first ungenerously taken up by him, had continued much too long, being al∣most eight Years, I was willing to lay hold of an Opportunity for proposing an Ac∣commodation. Accordingly, I wrote to Mr <HI>Pope</HI> and inclosed the abovementioned <HI>Advertisement</HI> in the Hand-writing of P.T. and desired his Answer which he thought fit in a very ungentleman-like Manner to return me in three Papers, viz the <HI>Grub-Street Journal.</HI> The <HI>Daily Journal,</HI> and the <HI>Daily Post-Boy;</HI> in the last of which I replied <HI>April</HI> 5th.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Appendix</HI> No. I. and II.</NOTE></P>
<P>Upon this Incident, P.T. renewed his Correspondence, and sent me word he had seen an <HI>Advertisement</HI> of Mr <HI>Pope</HI> which related to him, and that Mr <HI>Pope</HI> should soon see the <HI>Collection of Letters</HI> published, for that, upon my <HI>not advertising them</HI> he

had been persuaded to print them himself, and offered me the refusal of the Impression, his Demands for which were 75 pounds, and added, that a Person should meet me at the Rose Tavern in <HI>Bridges-Street,</HI> and bring me, at a Day appointed, one of the Books in sheets. But on the Day appointed I received a Countermand, that he thought he had lost his Wits by making such an Appointment, and seemed in a terrible Pa∣nic lest Mr <HI>Pope</HI> should send some of his <HI>Twickenham-Bravoes,</HI> to assault us; but how Mr <HI>Pope</HI> was to know of this Meeting is the Cream of the Jest. I sent him word that I commiserated his fears, but as to my own part, I did not at all dread any <HI>Assassination</HI> whatever from Mr <HI>Pope,</HI> even tho' it were a <HI>Poetical One.</HI> To this P.T. rejoined, that a Gentleman should call at my House precisely at eight in the Evening in a Week's Time; but in the Interim I received the following Letter, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>YOU see how earnest <HI>P.T.</HI> is to have these Books out, therefore you will re∣ceive by the Bearer some Titles. By one a-Clock, you shall have more Books; but he must insist on some Money to pay the Printer. The Number I shall bring you will be near 200, be at home at 12, for I may get them before. I am,</P>

According to the Request herein, I staid at home; and, about one o'Clock, <HI>R.S.</HI> sent for me to the <HI>Standard Tavern</HI> in <HI>Leicester-Fields,</HI> where I paid him ten pounds, and gave him a negotiable Note for fifteen pounds, payable in a Month, as he desired.</P>
<P>We had not been together half an hour, before two Porters brought to the Tavern five Bundles of Books upon a Horse, which R.S. told me came by Water. He ordered the Porters to carry them to my House and my Wife took them in. They contained but 38 Books in each bundle making in the 5 Bundles 190 Books (all wanting the Letters to Mess. <HI>Jarvas, Digby, Blount</HI> and Dr <HI>Arbuthnot</HI>'s Letter). But he said they contained 50 in each Bun∣dle, which with 50 I had before (without Titles or Prefaces,) made 300, and gave me the following Receipts.</P>

<P>About two a Clock, on the very Day of Publication, the 12th Instant, all the Books that were in my Custody were seized by a Warrant from the House of Lords, and my self, and Mr <HI>John Wilford,</HI> Publisher of the Post-Boy, were both ordered to attend their Lordships, the next Day; which we did accordingly. Mr <HI>Wilford,</HI> and the Prin∣ter of the <HI>Post-Boy,</HI> whom he brought with him, were upon Examination dischar∣ged. But the Lords Resolving themselves into a Committee, I was ordered to at∣tend the next Day.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr CURLL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>13 May 1735.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS SOON as I heard of our Misfor∣tune of the Books being seiz'd, I posted away to P.T. he said he found his great Caution was but necessary: but tho' he knew Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s Interest with the Great, he apprehended only his personal Re∣venge, or a Chancery Suit; (knowing he would spare no Cost to gratify his Re∣venge)
<PB N="20" REF="52"/>
he said, if you had been more cautious, than to <HI>name Lords</HI> in your Advertisement, this could not have hap∣pen'd; but since it has happen'd, you shall not only find him punctual, but <HI>Gene∣rous.</HI> He immediately sent me with Money to pay off the Printer, and I have the whole Impression in my hands: I then found that the Rogue had deliver'd your last Parcel imperfect: but I will bring you both those Sheets, and the whole Impression, the very first day they can be safely deliver'd you.</P>
<P>P.T. says he never intended any more Advantage, but meerly not to be out of pocket. (Except you had been willing to gra∣tify me a little), but now he will be Just, and act handsomely to you, tho' ever so much to his own Loss: provided you keep secret our whole Transaction—As it is plain that <HI>Pope</HI>'s whole Point is only to <HI>suppress the Books,</HI> and find out <HI>who gave the Letters.</HI> You will intirely disappoint him in both, if, whatever Questions the Lords ask, you will answer no more than thus: <HI>that you had the Letters</HI> from <HI>different Hands,</HI> some of which you <HI>paid</HI> for, that <HI>you printed these as you did Mr Cromwell's</HI> before, without Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s ever <HI>gainsaying</HI> it; and that as to the <HI>Originals, many you can</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="53"/>
<HI>shew now,</HI> and the rest you can <HI>very speedily.</HI></P>
<P>It is well that an Accident hinders you at present from the Originals, which now, they would seize. P.T. thinks it was indiscreet to advertise the Originals so very quick as the first Day, until you ac∣tually had them, which by his own fal∣ling ill, he cou'd not come at so soon in the place where they lay.</P>
<P>The Lords cannot stop the Books above two or three Days, if at all.</P>
<P>And P.T's wonderful Caution as it hap∣pens, will enable you to sell them what∣ever Orders they may make. For he, apprehending Injunctions in Chancery might suppress the Book, had already prin∣ted <HI>another Title and Preface,</HI> which throws the Publication intirely off you, and might be safely vended even in that Case.</P>
<P>In short, if you absolutely conceal all that has passed between P.T. Me, and Your self, you win the old Gentleman for ever. For his whole Heart is set upon publishing the Letters, not so much for this Volume as, <HI>in Ordine ad</HI> to much more important Correspondence that will follow, <HI>viz.</HI> with SWIFT, late Lord OX....D Bp. ROCHESTER, and Lord BOL.</P>

<P>WE heartily congratulate you on your Victory over the Lords, the <HI>Pope,</HI> and the Devil: for we have sure Information, that the Books will be restor'd to you either this day, or to morrow—The old Gentleman is charm'd with your Be∣haviour yesterday; only thinks it wrong that he hears you own'd the <HI>Books were sent to your Wife</HI> by an unknown Hand.—This may induce Enquiry and Suspicion of some dark Transaction; and be thought shuffling. The Lords will think you more sincere, and 'twill have a betrer Air, to say, <HI>you had the Originals and Copies from different Hands, and that some you paid for, some were given you, and you printed them in your own Right.</HI>—You can suffer no more for printing than for publi∣shing
<PB N="23" REF="55"/>
them, and the Lords can't touch a Hair of your Head.</P>
<P>All that <HI>P.T.</HI> can apprehend is that <HI>Pope</HI> may obtain an Injunction in Chan∣cery, against <HI>E. Curll</HI> by Name, not∣withstanding which, those Books may be selling, which have not your Name, with the Preface which he provided for that Pur∣pose.</P>
<P>And you cannot but observe when you read that Preface, that at the same Time, that it makes you not Publisher, it yet proves your Right to <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s <HI>Letters.</HI></P>
<P>This is as lucky as can be, and <HI>Pope</HI> cannot obtain an Injunction without own∣ing himself, in the Bill, Author of the Let∣ters, which will serve you to prove the Let∣ters genuine.</P>
<P>If you observe all the old Gentleman's Directions you will soon be fully acquaint∣ed both with his Person and Designs; in the mean Time, to shew you he will take off the Mask, and clear the <HI>Mysterium magnum</HI> you complain of, I have his Leave to tell you these things which he would have, writ to you himself, but
<PB N="24" REF="56" MS="y"/>
that his Arm is now disabled by the Rheumatism.</P>
<P>He is no Man of Quality, but conversant with many, and happening to be concern'd with a noble Lord (a Friend of Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s) in handing to the Press his Letters to <HI>Wy∣cherley,</HI> he got some Copies over and above. This Incident put first into his Head the Thought of collecting more, and afterwards finding you did not comply in printing his Advertisement, he went on with it by him∣self. Found <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Answers in the same Lord's Possession, with many others, which he printed as near as possible to correspond with the Letter and Paper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Observations he made in some Pa∣ragraphs <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were necessary, the same things being repeated in other Letters, either of this or the next Volume, particu∣larly the Original of the Letter to Mr <HI>Walsh</HI> is in his Hand.</P>
<P>I hope to have some of his Originals when we meet. The Books that Rascal sent imperfect, you shall have perfected on your first Desire by a Line to <HI>Dicks;</HI> in which you are disir'd to send us Word of what you now think of the Honour and Candour of</P>

He says you did not follow the In∣structions he sent you, in not owning the Printing; which tho' in your Letter you seem to think nothing, yet joyn'd to your having own'd to others, that you had them from a-cross the Water, was al∣most all that you could discover.

Judge too if you have done wisely, to hazard, by your blabbing, the Loss of a future Copy of immense Value, which I much doubt he will ever let you have. He has positively enjoyn'd me not to trust my self with you till better Assurance: and the best way for my Part that I know you can give any Assurance is, to send the 20 pound first, to <HI>Dicks Coffee-House,</HI> in a Note on Mr <HI>Hoare,</HI> by 10 to-morrow morning; and to show P.T. that you trust him as absolutely in that small Sum, as he has
<PB N="27" REF="59" MS="y"/>
done you in a much greater. As soon as you do this (and not before) he'll send all the things you desire, which I believe he would never have done after your naming me, and coming so near, as <HI>Southwark,</HI> but for his being so earnest to have the Book publish'd.</P>
<P>In one Word he has put it upon this Test.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ABOUT the Time that Mr <HI>Wycherley</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> I troubled you with a Letter of mine, in hopes of prevailing with you to continue, the Favour of your's. But I now write, to convince you that Si∣lence is not always the surest Guard against Impertinence: I have too great a Sense of those many Civilities receiv'd from you, to desist from expressing it, till I receive more: For you not only have acquainted me with many of my Errors in scribbling, but with some in my Conduct; and I owe to you the Knowledge of Things infinitely more of Concern to myself, than any thing of mine can be to others. The Advantage I have obtain'd from both might endanger your be∣ing put upon an endless Trouble of criti∣cizing on the rest of my Faults, and there∣fore you have reason to make some delay with those now under your Examination. Tho' I never cou'd expect you shou'd once look up∣on them, but when you were perfectly at Leisure; yet so much Assurance your for∣mer Kindness had given me, that I was un∣der some Apprehensions for your Health, on
<PB N="6" REF="84" MS="y"/>
the Score of your Silence; and I desir'd Mr <HI>Wycherley</HI> to inform me on that Sub∣ject; which he did not, either through For∣getfulness, or else believing I shou'd be soon in Town. And I had certainly been there before this Time, had it been in my Pow∣er to comply with his most obliging Invi∣tation, and my Desires of seeing him and you. But since I find I must not hope for that Satisfaction till after <HI>Christmas,</HI> I en∣treat you will not, in the mean time, let me be so unhappy as to doubt of your Wel∣fare; which is the sole Business of this Let∣ter, that (to make you some amends for the unconscionable Length of my last) shall not add a Word more but that which I hope you will ever believe, that I am,</P>

<P>I Receiv'd the Favour of your kind Letter, wherein I find you have oblig'd me be∣fore I expected it, in reviewing the Papers I sent you; I have been ask'd, I believe twenty times, by Sir <HI>William Trumbull</HI> for a Sight of that Translation, but have de∣ferr'd it till I cou'd supply the blank Spa∣ces I left in the fair Copy, by your Ap∣probation. If therefore you will send it inclos'd to Mr <HI>Thorold</HI> the Tobacconist in <HI>Duke-street,</HI> to be sent me by the Coach, as soon as you can conveniently; it will come very opportunely; since I find I can no longer refuse to show it to Sir <HI>William</HI> with any Decency. I am mightily pleas'd with your Objection to my attributing Friendship to Dogs, yet think the Want of Equality is no Obstacle to the Friend∣ship of some Country Gentlemen of my Acquaintance, with theirs▪ I am extreamly impatient to enjoy your agreeable Conver∣sation, and to let you know how much I prefer it to any here, where indeed Dogs and Men are much on a Level, only the first have more Good-nature and more Sa∣gacity. If I were not at this instant very

But what you tell me of her Relations Account of the State of her Mind, is not to be wonder'd at. 'Tis the easiest Way they have to make some seeming Excuse for a shameful Indolence and Neglect of afflicted Virtue, to represent it as willing to suffer, and endure the Cross. Alas, Sir! These good People of large Estates, and little Souls, have no mind to ease her, by bear∣ing it off her Shoulders by a generous Assistance! OUr Saviour himself did not refuse to be eas'd of the Weight of Part of his Cross; tho' perhaps <HI>Simon</HI> of <HI>Cyrene</HI> might alledge to the <HI>Jews</HI> that 'twas Christ's Desire to bear it all himself; and he, for his Part, might be willing to go quietly on his Journey, without the Trouble.—</P>

<P>BEing informed by a Person of great Worth and Quality that you design∣ed to publish a <HI>Collection</HI> of <HI>Original Let∣ters,</HI> &amp;c. from the best Hands since the <HI>Restauration,</HI> I here therefore transmit some very good ones which I am possessed of, that I may contribute my little Mite there∣to. And I am the more encouraged to pursue my first Intentions of sending you the inclosed Papers, especially those from Mr <HI>Dryden,</HI> (from the great Usefulness of such an Undertaking) who, notwithstand∣ing he was the Honour and Ornament of his Country; yet, misled by the Vices of that Age, had been too great a Libertine in many of his Writings; but dearly did he repent of it before he died (as certainly all must who have but even the Princi∣ples of Natural Religion, when they come to take a serious View of Eternity) he was continually bewailing the Impossibility of calling in all his Works, and making a thorough Reformation, and therefore took all Opportunities of deterring others from treading in his Steps; nay, some∣times his Zeal carried him so far as to

chide, even when there was no Occasion, as witness one of his Letters to me, who had desired his Correction of some Ver∣ses, and had innocently said they were written in Imitation of Mr <HI>Behn</HI>'s Num∣bers. I own I was pleased with the Ca∣dence of her Verse, tho' at the same Time I no ways approved the Licentious∣ness of her Morals. But you will see how severe he is upon me for it; and I am very certain if he had lived but a few Months longer, he would have pub∣lished a <HI>Treatise</HI> by Way of <HI>Recantation;</HI> which, as he often used to say, was <HI>the only Method whereby he could redeem his Crime, and prevent a growing Evil.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The FEAST of TRIMALCHIO.</HEAD>
<P>GLUTTED with the public Di∣versions, of Theatres, Amphithea∣tres, and Bacchanalian Revels, we visited the most Sacred Palaces of Monarchy, and beheld with aweful Reverence, the public Banquettings of these earthly Gods! we saw the August Emperor at his Meals, and we did see the People gape as he did eat; I truly wondered that they should betray so much of the Imperfection of human Nature, to the Multitude, who by this might discover that Kings differed not at all from common Men. The Luxury of the Nation encouraged no Entertainment which we did not partake of, our Ears
<PB N="44" REF="122"/>
were feasted with the most wanton and las∣civious Strains of Instruments and Voices, and we could perceive the Passions these Airs inspired in the Faces of an Hun∣dred Beauties almost naked to the Waist; and now we purposed to retire, and enjoy a Week's Interval from the Fatigues of Pleasure, when a Slave came to inform us, that his Master, <HI>Caius Pompeius Trimal∣chio</HI> invited us to a Repast, where every Man might speak his mind. He is, says the Slave, a Man of infinite Humour, and a most excellent Politician I assure you. Having drest our selves, we bid him conduct us to his Master; but in our way thither, the streets were greatly thronged with Horse∣men, who had been hunting and were now returning from the Chace; I was wholly taken up with the Homage that was paid to one of the Sportsmen, and the Gran∣deur of his Equipage, when <HI>Menelaus,</HI> a Nobleman and one of his Attendants, steps up to us, presenting a Gentleman, saying this is he with whom you are to dine.</P>
<P>He was a portly Man, somewhat Gouty, and accosted every body with an affected Smile; upon our Appearance he made an offer of alighting to receive us, when the greater part of his Retinue dismounted in an instant; some of them held his Bridle, others took hold of his Stirrup,
<PB N="45" REF="123"/>
the rest bent their Backs, reclined their Heads, and threw themselves into the resemblance of so many Horse-Blocks, seeming to court his Foot to tread upon their Necks, about which they wore a chain, loose and careless, to denote the pleasure they took in their Servitude. You may imagine this Submission reduced the Cavalcade to some disorder; for my part, I was quite abashed, having never seen the like, so flung my self upon the Ground, a∣mongst the rest, as did my Companions, in which we were very lucky, for I afterwards understood it was a Ceremony required of every body that were to be his Guests. We were soon raised up, mounted on led Horses, and the Troop renewed it's former Order, marching re∣gularly into a Court-Yard, where we dismounted; and walking to the En∣trance of the Portico read this In∣scription:</P>
<P>If any Slave shall say <HI>AYE</HI> or <HI>NO,</HI> contrary to the Will of his Master, he shall be stript of his Livery and lose his Wages.</P>
<P>At the entrance of the Hall was a Glass Room, which I took to be the Porter's Lodge, and admired the Contrivance, but was presently convinced of my Mistake, when raised by Pullies to the Roof, I
<PB N="46" REF="124"/>
discovered it to be a most stupendious Lanthorn.</P>
<P>We advanced to the Stair-case, where a Market-Place was described, with Slaves setting upon Benches to the <HI>right</HI> and <HI>left,</HI> to be BOUGHT and SOLD, <HI>Trimalchio</HI> hard by with a Whip and Bridle; a little farther was represented how he first learnt to spell, and beyond that was <HI>Mercury</HI> hold∣ing him up by the Chin and placing him on a Throne; <HI>Fortune</HI> presented him with a <HI>Cornucopia</HI> and the <HI>three fatal Sisters,</HI> spun a Thread of Gold. He was in different places painted as a Judge, a General, and a Priest; the whole was excellently performed, and highly finished: surfeited with this fulsom Pageantry, as we proceeded, a Slave, stript of his Livery, cast himself at our feet, imploring our Protection, protesting his Fault was Inad∣vertency only, that being roused from sleep, and asked a question he knew nothing of, he had said NO when he should have said YES. We were saluted by him in the Di∣ning-Room with thanks for the Obliga∣tion, which he told us was well bestowed, for, says he, the Wine, my Lord drinks, you shall anon find to be in the disposal of his Servants; having viewed the Side∣board, the huge Piles of massy Plate, and spacious Cisterns, double gilt, on which
<PB N="47" REF="125"/>
<HI>Trimalchio</HI>'s Arms and Name were engra∣ven, and it's weight markt on each peice, we all seated ourselves, except <HI>Trimalchio,</HI> for whom the chief Place was reserved. At the striking up of a Band of Music he made his Entrance, <HI>My Friends,</HI> says he, <HI>I have business to dispatch, but came thus soon, lest my Absence should make you uneasy.</HI> Now the Servants entered sweating be∣neath the ponderous Dishes, which they seemed hardly able to support; the flesh of Bulls, Calves, Sheep, Deer, and other Qua∣drupeds; all Kinds of Fish and Fowl, were stewed for the Juices they contained, which, blended into one Fluid, formed a most delicious Soup. Near, in a golden Charger were an hundred mangled Vipers, buried in their own blood; in other Dishes were the Palates of <HI>Cuckows,</HI> the Rumps of <HI>Wheat-Ears,</HI> the Brains of <HI>Nightingales,</HI> Cavear of <HI>Todpoles,</HI> an <HI>Onocrotalon,</HI> the Hump of a <HI>Camel,</HI> the Proboscis of an <HI>Ele∣phant,</HI> and a <HI>Sow</HI>'s Paps. I knew not a seventh part of this Course; the greatest share of which was scrambled away before it could be distinctly viewed; a Slave in the Hurry threw down a golden Dish, and stooping to take it up, <HI>Trimalchio</HI> gave him a sound Box on the Ear, and ordered it to be swept out of the Room; the Sal∣vers rang, and Wine went briskly round,
<PB N="48" REF="126"/>
when, every body said something in praise of this Service, this Applause was followed with a second, and that indifferent consi∣dering the Place, the Novelty of it however drew our Attention, it was a round Table on which were placed the <HI>twelve Signs</HI> in their proper Order, upon each of which the Disposer had put some thing suitable. Upon ARIES was a <HI>Sheep's-Head;</HI> upon TAURUS, a <HI>Chine</HI> of <HI>Beef;</HI> upon GEMINI, <HI>Lamb's-Stones</HI> and <HI>Kidneys;</HI> upon CANCER, a <HI>Ducal-Coronet;</HI> upon LEO, the <HI>African-Fruit;</HI> upon VIRGO, <HI>Sausages;</HI> upon LIBRA, a <HI>Pair of Scales,</HI> in the <HI>one</HI> a <HI>Pudding,</HI> in the <HI>other</HI> a Panegyric; upon SCORPIO, a <HI>Sprat;</HI> upon SAGITTARIUS, a <HI>Hare;</HI> upon CAPRICORN, a <HI>Lobster;</HI> upon AQUARIUS, a <HI>Goose;</HI> upon PISCES, two <HI>Mullets;</HI> and in the middle, a Plate of <HI>sweet Herbs.</HI> Now <HI>Trimalchio,</HI> intreated us to be merry, called for more Wine, and larger Glasses, the Company were highly elevated, several Courses followed too nau∣seous and tedious to relate. I asked one of the Guests who that <HI>Woman</HI> was, that scutled up and down the Room, her Name is FORTUNATA, says he, she is the Wife of <HI>Trimalchio,</HI> she measures her Money by the Bushel; and yet she sprang from a Dunghil not long since, no Man would have touched her with a Pair of Tongs;
<PB N="49" REF="127"/>
now she is his Heaven, his <HI>all</HI> in <HI>all!</HI> what she says must be truth, she's a <HI>Wagtail,</HI> a meer <HI>Shrew,</HI> a <HI>Magpye,</HI> whom she loves, she loves; and whom she loves <HI>not,</HI> she hates. <HI>Trimalchio</HI> knows not half his Income, nor extent of his Estate.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sun,</HI> himself, surveys it not at once, but travels for the view; a <HI>Crow</HI> can∣not fly over it in a Week; he buys no∣thing, yet owns the whole Town, inha∣bits it all, and is himself the People. A twentieth part of his Tenants don't know their Landlord; there are <HI>Thirty</HI> Degrees amongst his Servants; he has <HI>twenty-six</HI> Domestic-Chaplains, and <HI>three Orders</HI> of his Favourites, whom he teaches to jump over a Stick; he is himself a Lover of Peace; for when the <HI>Alemains</HI> and <HI>Gauls</HI> were at war, he sent and desired to be Friends.</P>
<P>Upon this, another <HI>Orator</HI> arose and thus delivered himself. The World, the whole World, cannot be ignorant of the Vir∣tues of our Patron CAIUS. The Govern∣ment of Provinces, the high Trusts and principal Employments of <HI>Rome,</HI> are not bestowed by Favour but Merit, nothing is now considered but Integrity and Worth. What good Work is left undone? The luminous Dignitaries of the Church, the im∣mortal Charges of the War, the Trade and flourishing Opulency of the People, the
<PB N="50" REF="128"/>
increasing Glory and Grandeur of the State! These our <HI>Romans</HI> shall record to Perpetuity, the Honours of <HI>Trimalchio,</HI> which consist not in his many eminent and great Employments, but in his transcen∣dent Liberality, profound Policy, and the ardent and unextinguished Love he bears his Country, in whose uncorrupt hands we are as Counters, and what just now stood for Millions shall at his pleasure dwindle to Cyphers. We had now got our full Dose, and were grown sick of this fulsom Slave; when <HI>Trimalchio</HI> leaning on his Elbow thus spoke—<HI>This Wine,</HI> said he, <HI>is good; and Fish should swim: let's be merry, and exercise our Lungs as well as Teeth. Well,</HI> Peace be with my Master's bones, <HI>say I, who made a Man of me. You can tell me nothing which I don't know, I never was outwitted; for, I am a thorough Master of the Practicks!</HI> Here he explained the <HI>Heavens</HI> by <HI>Banquets,</HI> and shewed us the Influence of each <HI>Sign</HI> upon our Nativity. Clapping our Hands and hollooing we rang an universal Peal to his Applause, and swore all the <HI>Philosophers</HI> and <HI>Astro∣logers</HI> in the World were Fools to him; upon this, he called for his Will, and or∣der'd it to be read, this set the whole Fa∣mily in Tears, and their howling was as grievous, as their Joy before had been ex∣cessive;
<PB N="51" REF="129"/>
he repeated his Epitaph himself, which he assured us was of his own composing; no doubt, says he, you won∣der how I became so Great! conside∣ring my Age, for these Teeth I lost, when I was a Boy, and I have prospe∣red ever since. I was ever bold and con∣fident, because a <HI>Fortune-teller</HI> inform'd me, <HI>how long I had to live.</HI> He run on thus for a great while, when one, behind, thus whispered me. This <HI>Trimalchio,</HI> says he, is a pitiful Scoundrel, and his Re∣tinue a Pack of Rascals, he became the mighty despicable thing he is, by Fawning, Wriggling, Whispering, In∣triguing, Bargaining, and Backbiting; no honest Man can Eat, Drink, Sleep, or enjoy the Light of the Sun without paying an EXCISE for the support of his Luxury: as if the Gifts of Providence were at his sole Disposal. Sir, continued he, I ne∣ver would wish for a better Estate, than the Property of Printing his <HI>Last Dying Speech.</HI> This Fellow's Bluntness made me smile, and the Company withdrawing to the Baths, <HI>Gito, Ascyltos,</HI> and my self, took this opportunity of stealing away, un∣perceiv'd, among the Croud.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Paris <DATE>Nov. 23, 1732.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will wonder to see me in Print; but how could I avoid it? The Dead and the Living, my Friends and my Foes, at home and abroad, call upon me to say something; and the Reputa∣tion of an History, which I, and all the World value, must have suffered, had I continued silent. I have printed <HI>here,</HI> in hopes that somebody afterward may venture to reprint in <HI>England,</HI> notwithstanding those two frightening Words at the Close of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Name.</NOTE>
<PB N="2" REF="160"/>
Whether that happens or not, it is fit you should have a Sight of it, who I know will read it with some degree of Satisfaction, as it is mine, tho' it should have (as it really has) nothing else to recommend it. Such as it is, <HI>Extremum hoc munus morientis habeto;</HI> For that may well be the Case, considering that within a few Months I am entring in∣to my Seventieth Year; after which, even the Healthy and the Happy cannot much de∣pend upon Life, and will not, if they are wise, much desire it. Whenever I go, you will lose a Friend, who loves and values you ex∣tremely, if in my Circumstances I can be said to be lost to any one, when dead, more than I am already whilst living. I expected to have heard from you by Mr. <HI>Morice,</HI> and wondered a little that I did not; but he owns himself in a Fault, for not giving you due Notice of his Motions. It was not amiss that you forbore writing to me on a Head, wherein I promis'd more than I was able to perform. Disgraced Men fancy sometimes, that they preserve an Influence, where, when they endeavour to exert it, they soon see their Mistake. I did so, my good Friend, and acknowledge it under my Hand. You sounded the Coast and found out my Error, it seems, before I was aware of it; but enough on this Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="161"/>
What are you doing in <HI>England</HI> to the Ho∣nour of Letters? and particularly what are you doing? <HI>Ipse quid audes? Quae circum∣volitas agilis Thyma?</HI> Do you pursue the moral Plan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Essay on Man.</NOTE> you marked out, and seemed sixteen Months ago so intent upon? Am I to see it perfected ere I die? And are you to enjoy the Reputation of it while you live? Or do you rather chuse to leave the Marks of your Friendship, like the Legacies of a Will, to be read and enjoy'd only by those who survive you? Were I as near you as I have been, I should hope to peep into the Manuscript before it was finished. But alas! there is and will ever probably be, a great deal of Land and Sea between us. How many Books have come out of late in your Parts, which you think I should be glad to peruse? Name them: the Catalogue, I believe, will not cost you much Trouble. They must be good ones indeed to challenge any Part of my Time, now I have so little of it left. I, who squandred whole Days heretofore, now hus∣band Hours, when the Glass begins to run low, and care not to mis-spend them on Trifles. At the End of the Lottery of Life, our last Minutes, like Tickets left in the
<PB N="4" REF="162"/>
Wheel, rise in their Valuation. They are not of so much worth, perhaps, in them∣selves, as those which preceded, but we are apt to prize them more, and with Reason. I do so, my dear Friend, and yet think the most precious Minutes of my Life are well employ'd, in reading what you write. But this is a Satisfaction I cannot much hope for, and therefore must betake myself to others, <HI>which</HI> are less entertaining. Adieu, Dear Sir, and forgive me engaging with one, whom you, I think, have reckoned among the Heroes of the <HI>Dunciad.</HI> It was necessary for me either to accept of his dirty Challenge, or to have suffer'd in the Esteem of the World by declining it. My Respects to your Mother; I send a Paper for Dean <HI>Swift,</HI> if you have an Opportunity, and think it worth your while to convey it. My Country at this Di∣stance seems to me a strange Sight, I know not how it appears to you, who are in the midst of the Scene, and yourself a Part of it; I wish you would tell me. You may write safely to Mr. <HI>Morice,</HI> by the honest Hand that conveys this, and will return into these Parts before <HI>Christmas;</HI> sketch out a rough Draught of it, that I may be able to judge, whether a Return to it be really eligible, or whether I should not, like the Chymist in the Bottle, upon hearing Don <HI>Quevedo</HI>'s Account
<PB N="5" REF="163"/>
of <HI>Spain,</HI> desire to be corked up again. After all, I do and must love my Country, with all its Faults and Blemishes; even that Part of the Constitution, which wounded me un∣justly, and itself thro' my Side, shall ever be dear to me. My last Wish will be like that of Father <HI>Paul, Esto perpetua;</HI> and when I die at a Distance from it, it will be in the same manner as <HI>Virgil</HI> describes the expiring <HI>Peloponnesian,</HI>
<Q><L>Sternitur, &amp; dulces moriens reminiscitur Argos.</L></Q></P>
<P>Do I still live in the Memory of my Friends, as they certainly do in mine? I have read a good many of your Paper Squabbles about me, and am glad to see such free Conces∣sions on that Head, tho' made with no View of doing me a Pleasure, but merely of loading another.</P>

<P>In a second Passage, said to be taken from <HI>page</HI> 227. of the History itself, Mr. <HI>Old∣mixon</HI> is represented as expressing himself thus.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>This Discovery does little Honour to the three Divines named in the Letter,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>As Mr.</HI> ATTERBURY, <HI>heretofore Bishop of</HI> Rochester, <HI>one of the Three, is still living, he will not probably be insensible of so grievous an Ac∣cusation; and the Public expects from him such Accounts of it, as even the Interest of his own Reputation seems to require. If he is silent on this Occasion, there can be no doubt, but that the Falsification is proved; and should he not be silent, what he shall say, to clear up this Matter, must be very strong, to destroy the Credit of such a Testimony.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Being called upon in this public Man∣ner, I myself obliged to declare, that the foregoing Account, in all its Parts, as far as I am any ways concerned, is entirely
<PB N="13" REF="171"/>
false and groundless; for I never saw my Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s History in Manuscript, ei∣ther before, or since the Edition of it; nor ever read a Line of it, but in Print. It was impossible, therefore, that I should deal with Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> in the Manner repre∣sented, with whom (as far as I can recol∣lect) I never exchanged one Word in all my Life; and whom I know not that I ever saw, till after the Edition of that Hi∣story. If therefore he expressed himself to this Purpose, in his last Moments (as I charitably hope he did not) he wronged me extremely, and died with a Lie in his Mouth.</P>
<P>This Vindication of the Truth and my∣self, is necessary, since I happen to survive the two other worthy Persons mentioned. Were they alive, they would, I doubt not, be equally able and ready to clear themselves from so foul an Aspersion. As to one of them, Dr. <HI>Smallridge,</HI> the late Bishop of <HI>Bristol,</HI> no Suspicion of this kind can possibly rest on his Memory, because he was not any ways concerned in preparing that History for the Press; but as much a Stranger to the Contents of it, as I myself was, till it came forth in Print. I speak with the more Assurance on this Head, be∣cause my great Intimacy with him, as my Contemporary, both at <HI>Westminster</HI> and <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> gave me all the Advantages
<PB N="14" REF="172"/>
requisite towards knowing the Truth of what I say: With Dr. <HI>Aldrich,</HI> the third Person accused, I was acquainted more at a distance: However, being called upon in the Manner I am, I will add also what has come to my Knowledge, with regard to the Share He and Others had in the Publi∣cation of that History.</P>
<P>The Revising of the Manuscript (writ∣ten, as I have heard, not very correctly) was committed to the Care of Bishop <HI>Sprat,</HI> and Dean <HI>Aldrich,</HI> by the late Earl of <HI>Ro∣chester,</HI> who himself also assisted in that Re∣visal, from the Beginning to the End of the Work: So that any Changes, made in it, must have had the Consent of those three Persons. They were Men of Probity and Truth, and incapable of conspiring in a De∣sign to impose on the Publick. I can cite nothing, that is material in this Point, from the Mouth of the <HI>Earl,</HI> with whom I rarely conversed; but the <HI>Bishop</HI> and the <HI>Dean,</HI> to whom I severally succeeded in the Deaneries of <HI>Christ-Church</HI> and <HI>West∣minster,</HI> and in the See of <HI>Rochester,</HI> have occasionally more than once assured me, that no Additions whatsoever were made to the Manuscript History: And even the <HI>Earl,</HI> in his Preface to the first Volume (for His I take it to be, tho' no Name is af∣fixed to it) has publickly protested his In∣nocence
<PB N="15" REF="173"/>
in this respect, where he declares, that <HI>They who put forth the History</HI> (he means himself and his Brother, as ap∣pears from what follows) <HI>durst not take upon them to make any Alterations in a Work of this Kind, solemnly left with them to be pub∣lished, whenever it should be published, as it was delivered to them.</HI></P>
<P>Could he, and the two other Persons by him employed, be supposed to have made any Additions, notwithstanding such Assu∣rances to the contrary, yet their good Sense (if not their Integrity) would have pre∣vented, at least, their re-touching those <HI>Characters,</HI> which are allowed to be the most distinguished and beautiful Part of the Work, and to have something of Ori∣ginal in them, that is not to be imitated. The After-strokes of any less able Pencil, intermix'd with those of the first Masterly Hand, would soon be discovered: And yet I am persuaded, the most discerning Eye can find out no Traces of such a Mixture; no, not in the Character of Mr. <HI>Hampden,</HI> even in those Words, at the Close of it, against which Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI> so warmly de∣claims: They are perfectly in the Style and Manner of my Lord <HI>Clarendon;</HI> they contain nothing new in them, but only sum up, in short, what he had scattered through different Parts of the two first Volumes. Let the Reflections there made be never so
<PB N="16" REF="174"/>
severe, they may naturally be supposed, in the Warmth of Composure, to have come from the Pen of an Historian, who had himself with Zeal opposed Mr. <HI>Hampden</HI>'s Measures, and both seen and felt the sad Consequences of them: But that the Edi∣tors of his History, no ways concerned in those Transactions, should, 60 Years after∣wards, coolly and deliberately make such a needless Insertion, is not to be imagined.</P>
<P>The Complaint, on this and other Heads, should have been brought against these Editors, while it was capable of be∣ing thoroughly examined; at present, it comes a little too late, unless it were better supported: Their very Characters, to those who knew them, and the Nature of the Evidence, to those who did not, will be judged a sufficient Confutation of it: For, pray, what is this Evidence? It consists in an <HI>Hear-say from a Person, superior to all Suspicion,</HI> it seems, but <HI>too illustrious to be named:</HI> In an Appeal to <HI>another very honour∣able Person,</HI> to <HI>a Reverend Doctor now liv∣ing,</HI> and <HI>to a Gentleman of Distinction, both for Merit and Quality;</HI> none of whose Names are thought fit to be owned: The only one produced in the Case, is that of Mr. <HI>Smith, the Author of an excellent Tra∣gedy;</HI> but certainly not an Author of Rank and Weight enough to blast the Credit of
<PB N="17" REF="175"/>
such an excellent History: Of what Use can this Testimony be to his Purpose (even supposing the Account of it exact) when it is undoubtedly false, as to two of the three Persons it is levelled at, Dr. <HI>Small∣ridge</HI> and myself: and may therefore be justly presumed alike false, as to the third, Dr. <HI>Aldrich?</HI> Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> appears to have been so little in the Secret of the Edition of that Book, as not to have known even the Hands thro' which it passed; and is not therefore to be rely'd upon in his Ac∣counts of any other Circumstances relating to it, especially with regard to Dr. <HI>Aldrich,</HI> his Governor at <HI>Christ-Church;</HI> for whom his Personal Aversion, and the true Reasons of it, are too well understood to need ex∣plaining. I forbear saying any thing harsh of one, not able to answer for himself; but many, now alive, who knew them both, know how improbable, and altoge∣ther incredible it is, that Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> should have had the least Share in Dr. <HI>Aldrich</HI>'s Confidence, on so nice, or, indeed, on any Occasion. The Gentleman, who seems to be <HI>convinced of the Truth of Mr.</HI> Smith<HI>'s Assertions,</HI> by his having pointed out and <HI>underlined</HI> the Passages, <HI>in Print,</HI> which he said he was employ'd (by the three succes∣sive Deans) to <HI>interpolate and alter,</HI> in Ma∣nuscript, must surely have been very wil∣ling
<PB N="18" REF="176"/>
to be convinced; otherwise, he would not have taken a mere <HI>Assertion</HI> for a Proof, in such a Cause, and from such a Person. The Story of this Death-bed Declaration slept for about twenty Years; near thirty have passed since the History of the Re∣bellion was published (I mean the first Part of it) and not a few, since the Death of every Person that either was, or is falsly said to have been, concerned in that Publica∣tion, myself only excepted. I might, pro∣bably, at the Distance of <HI>Montpelier,</HI> where I was when Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI> wrote, never have heard of what he lays to my Charge (Intel∣ligence of that kind being, as he knows, not very open to me) or, should it reach me, I might yet, in my present Circumstances, be supposed not over-sollicitous to appear in the Disproof of it. The Delay of the Accusation therefore, if without Design, was not without its Advantages; and had it been deferred a little longer, till I was not only out of the Way, but out of the World, it had had a still fairer Chance to∣wards being uncontradicted, and conse∣quently credited. I have lived to hear this idle Tale, and to bear witness against it: There is no Vanity in hoping, that, old as I am, I shall outlive the Belief of it. An <HI>Holland</HI> Journal gave me the first Notice how I had been treated, and by that Means
<PB N="19" REF="177"/>
an Opportunity of vindicating myself; which I was the rather determined not to decline, because I suffer'd in Company with others, Men of great Note and Merit, thro' whose Sides the Authority of a noble and useful Part of our <HI>English</HI> History was struck at. Where I only am aspersed and wrong'd, I can, I thank God, more easily practise Patience, and submit to Indignities and Injuries in Silence. A foreign Wri∣ter has used me, in this Case, with greater Civility, and Temper, than Mr. <HI>Oldmixon,</HI> whom I know not that I have ever offended. I forgive him his ill Words, and his hard Thoughts, and only desire him for the fu∣ture not to indulge himself in ill-natur'd Relations of this Kind, without better Vouchers. His Attack on me, and on the Dead, who he thought might be insulted with equal Safety, is no Proof of a generous and worthy Mind; nor has he done any Honour to his own History, by the fruit∣less Pains he has taken to discredit that of my Lord <HI>Clarendon;</HI> which, like the Character of its Author, will gain Strength by Time; and will be in the Hands and Esteem of all Men, when Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI>'s unjust Censure of it will not be remembered, or not regarded.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Endeavours, that I may for∣get my Misfortunes, are truly Noble. It would be to deserve them to fly from Resolution. They shall not depress me, but I must help to bear what you tell me lies so heavy upon my Friends. I preserve a Mean, which is the Excellence, Justice and Fitness of all things in the Moral System,</P>
<L>Virtue's a Mean, and Vice is an Excess,</L>
<L>In doing more than's fit, or doing less.</L>
<P>To Poetise, my Friend, is no Mark of a depressed Fancy or excessive Sorrow, but a sort of a Comical Way of treating things serious, not after the subtle Fashions of those you speak of, that would magnify Nature by depressing the Deity; who, set∣ting forth their necessary Agreement, make unnecessary Strife; with Reverence do I mention these things, and know,</P>
<L>How the great Love of Nature fills thy Mind,</L>
<L>And Universal Kindness to thy Kind.</L>
<P><PB N="21" REF="179"/>
I am, while thus Juvenile, an Advocate for, and not a Railer against Extremes; these Symptoms strongly bode a second Youth, that vapours with a feeble and de∣fective Flame; it is the innervated Arm of <HI>Priam,</HI> impotently raised against the thun∣dering Rage of youthful <HI>Pyrrhus.</HI></P>
<P>However this Epistle, my Dear Friend, shall not become more tawdry by its not being of a Piece, for I will conclude with answering your last serious Question, with another Scrap of Poetry.</P>
<L>Whate'er the Soul of Nature has design'd,</L>
<L>And wrought on Matter, is the Effect of Mind;</L>
<L>The Form of Substance, is the Former's Art,</L>
<L>Hence Beauty and Design that strike the Heart;</L>
<L>There's nought in simple Matter to delight,</L>
<L>'Tis the fair Workmanship that takes the Sight.</L>
<L>The beautiful Effect of Mind alone,</L>
<L>Is comely, and in all things comely shown.</L>
<L>Where Mind is not, there Horror needs must be,</L>
<L>For Matter formless, is Deformity.</L>

<HEAD>EXTRACTS of several ORIGINAL LETTERS, written about the Year 1727, by Bishop <HI>Atterbury,</HI> to an ingenious <HI>French</HI> Gentleman, for whom he had a great Esteem.</HEAD>
<P>—THE Book<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs &amp; Reflexions, <HI>Sur les principaux Evenemens du Regne de</HI> Louis XIV.</NOTE> I now restore you, gave me Pleasure when I read it. The Turn is Natural and Familiar, and there is an Air of Truth in all he says; but, I think, not the Hand of a Master. He tells his Tale, not like a Man who knows any thing of the Rules of Writing well, but as an easy Companion at a Table. I say of his Style, what he says of his Fi∣gure, <HI>Ma figure, qui n' êtoit pas déplaisante, quoique je ne fusse pas du premier Ordre des Gens bien faits....</HI> i.e. My Figure, which did not displease, tho' I could not be ranked among handsome People of the first Class. Tho' not of the first (or even second) order
<PB N="23" REF="181"/>
of good Writers, he is yet agreeable.... I cannot possibly digest his taking Notice, p. 145. of the <HI>Chevalier de Rohan</HI>'s fine Legs. An Observation, that I should have expe∣cted rather from the Pen of a fine Lady, and which shews that the <HI>Marquis</HI> was in his Nature a little too intent on such Trifles. He is sensible of it, and excuses himself in the Words which follow; but that Excuse serves only to shew the Strength of the Im∣pression he was under in this respect, since he had Judgment enough to see the Fault, and commits it notwithstanding ...... Though I see he is manifestly piqu'd against <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. and his Minister <HI>Louvois,</HI> yet I am apt to believe him in all he says of both of them. His Resentment seems to carry him no farther than to give him the Privilege of speaking what he knew to be true; and, as the World goes, he that al∣lows himself to censure the Great even thus far, must say a great deal of Ill of them... <HI>Of several</HI> French <HI>Poets he speaks thus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rousseau</HI> appears to me still a greater Poet, the more I consider him. His Talents are unconfined, and enable him in every sort of writing to which he turns himself equally to excel. But the old hard Words he makes use of puzzle me often (who care not to consult a Dictionary) and chiefly in his Allegories.... <HI>Chaulieu, La Fare</HI> and
<PB N="24" REF="182"/>
<HI>Chapelle,</HI> have many Graces of the easy and natural Style, but I do not think them so perfect in their way as <HI>Rousseau</HI> is in his; nor (to tell you the Truth) do I take such Plea∣sure in reading them. The Letters particu∣larly of <HI>Chaulieu,</HI> &amp;c. are not Master-pieces in their kind, and many of his little Copies of Verses have nothing extraordinary in them. The Copy which touched me most is the Ode on <HI>Fontenay.</HI>
<Q><L>Muses qui dans ce lieu champetre, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>I cannot but observe, that under all <HI>Chaulieu</HI>'s seeming Gaiety, there is an Air of Melancholy which breaks out by Fits, and shews he was not at Ease in his own Mind. He endeavours to conceal it, and acts the Brave; but his Readers, with a little Pe∣netration, may see through the Disguise. The Fears of Death haunt him perpetually, and appear even in those Places, where he says, he is not afraid of it. I should be glad to know how he died, whether with the same Courage he commends in Lady <HI>Mazarine.</HI> I should guess not, by the Observations I have made of him.</P>
<P>After perusing a Dissertation of Mr. <HI>de Boze,</HI> the Bishop makes the following Remark.</P>
<P>This Book, I find, was written two and thirty Years ago, and therefore it is no wonder
<PB N="25" REF="183"/>
that it should not be equal to the later Per∣formances of the same Author. One may say of it as <HI>Tully</HI> speaks of his Collection of Pa∣radoxes; <HI>Non tale est hoc opus ut in arte poni possit, quasi illa Minerva Phidiae; sed tamen, ut ex eâdem officinâ exisse appareat.</HI> Though it be not of the same Value with his other Works, yet it is such, as that one may per∣ceive the same Workman's Hand and Skill in it. He chose a little contracted Subject; and had not Room therefore to shew his Talents at full length in managing it. And yet, narrow and dry as his Subject is, he has, by making several little Digressions, and by taking Occasion to say many things which were not necessary to his Point, rendered it, not only instructive but entertaining.
<Q><L>In tenui labor, at tenuis non gloria, si quem</L>
<L>Numina laeva sinunt, auditque vocatus Apollo.</L></Q>
Whether his forth <HI>Gordean</HI> be a Reality or a Phantom; whether he owes his very being to this Gentleman, or is only rescued from Oblivion, and brought again to Life by him, let the Antiquaries determine: I am so easy and indolent as not to think it of much Moment, which Way such Facts are settled; nor should I have thought what is written on this Point worth read∣ing, if this Author had not writ it. In all
<PB N="26" REF="184"/>
he writes, one sees the same Candor and Impartiality; the same Learning, good Sense and Exactness. If the Argument he handles be not of Importance, he makes it so by his manner of handling it. So that I could wish, instead of four Books, he had written forty: as old as I am, and as many other things as I have to do, I should read all of them.... I have perus'd <HI>(says the Bishop in another Letter)</HI> the Book about <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the Work intitled, <HI>Reflexions critiques sur la Poesie &amp; la Peinture,</HI> by <HI>Abbé du Bos.</HI> A new Edition of it, with Corrections and Additions, has been published by the Author, since the writing of this Letter.</NOTE> Poetry and Painting, with Attention. It is written in a very good Goût, and has ex∣cellent things in it. I have been pleased with no Book so much that has fallen in my way, since I came into <HI>France.</HI> How∣ever, I could wish those philosophical Rea∣sonings had been omitted; they belong ra∣ther to a Member of the Academy of Sci∣ences, than to one of the Forty, and per∣haps will neither convince nor please in such a Performance. The Author seems to have gone too deep in that sort of Refle∣ctions, and sometimes not to have gone deep enough in others, which relate more immediately and naturally to his Subject. Forgive this Freedom, but it
<PB N="27" REF="185"/>
is my real sense of the Matter. Besides, there is, I think, a want of Method in the whole<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author has changed the Order and Disposition of his Work, in the last Edition of it.</NOTE>; and the 19th Section, which is so long, is to me a little obscure. The many learned Citations there, do not clear, but cloud the Author's Meaning, I am apt to imagine that in the musical Part of it, he speaks of what he does not himself tho∣roughly understand; for if he does, he would probably have expressed himself so, that his Reader also would have understood it, which, (as to me at least) is not the Case. In one thing I differ from him es∣sentially; my fixed Opinion is, that the Re∣putation of all Books which are perfectly well writ, comes Originally from the Few, and not from the Many; and I think I could say a good deal in Defence of that Opinion...... I see him here, and every where, under the Image of
<Q><L>.... Urbani parcentis viribus, atque</L>
<L>Extenuantis eas consultò.</L></Q>
He seldom speaks out, where he is likely to offend, but contents himself oftentimes rather to infinuate, than affirm; and makes
<PB N="28" REF="186"/>
use of other Mens Words to express his own Sense, where he is unwilling too openly to own it, or too strongly to press it. <HI>Ab arte suâ non recessit,</HI> as <HI>Tully</HI> says of <HI>Aris∣toxenus.</HI> Even in his Judgment of the <HI>Belles Lettres</HI> he plays the Politician.... I could not but observe, how in the last Section but one, he has furnished Mr. <HI>de Voltaire</HI> with the Hint of his Poem on the <HI>Ligue...</HI> Upon the whole, I repeat my Thanks to you for the great Satisfaction which the reading of these <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The last Edition is in Three Volumes.</NOTE> two Volumes has given me.... As to Mr. <HI>Arnauld</HI>'s Piece, intitled, <HI>Reflexions sur l'Eloquence,</HI> though what he says there be sensible and just; yet I do not see much of the great Man in it, and had no great Pleasure in perusing it.</P>
<P>The following Remarks are made upon Mr. <HI>Fontenelle</HI>'s Manner of Writing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I return you, Sir, the two Eloges, which I have perused with Pleasure. I borrow that Word from your Language, because we have none in our own that exactly expresses it. By the Account I had of those Pieces, I imagined them very different from what I find them. Mr. <HI>Fontenelle</HI>'s Talents, as to the Knowledge of Nature, Mathematicks, and the <HI>Belles Lettres,</HI> are sufficiently under∣stood.
<PB N="29" REF="187"/>
But I take notice particularly of the Art and Address with which he con∣ducts himself in nice Points, and the pru∣dent and political Views by which his Pen is guided; a Quality, that does not often belong to Men who have spent so much of their time in studying the Arts and Sciences. He has been misinformed as to one little Particular, in the short Draught he has given us of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s Figure. The <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The very lively and piercing Eye.</NOTE><HI>oeil fort vif, &amp; fort perçant,</HI> which he gives him, did not belong to him, at least not for twenty Years past, about which time I first came acquainted with him. In∣deed, in the whole Air of his Face and make, there was nothing of that penetra∣ting Sagacity which appears in his Compo∣sures. He had something rather languid in his Look and Manner, which did not raise any great Expectation in those who did not know him. I see Mr. <HI>Fontenelle</HI> speaks wa∣rily as to the MSS. relating to Antiquity, History and Divinity, which Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> left behind him: I wish, for the Honour of our Country, that they may be as excellent in their Kind as those he published. But I fear the Case is otherwise, and that he will be found to have been a great Master only
<PB N="30" REF="188"/>
in that one way to which he was by Na∣ture inclined. It is enough for us poor limited Creatures, if we remarkably excel in any one Branch of Knowledge. We may have a Smattering of more; but it is beyond the Lot of our Nature, to attain any Perfection in them. Mr. <HI>Fontenelle</HI>'s Praise of Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s Modesty (and of Mo∣desty in general) is to me the most pleasing Part of that Description he has given us of him. It is that Modesty which will teach us to speak, and think of the Antients with Reverence, especially if we happen not to be thoroughly acquainted with them. Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> certainly was, and his great Veneration for them was one distinguishing Part of his Character, which I wonder (or rather, I do not wonder) that Mr. <HI>Fontenelle</HI> has omitted. His Opinion of them was, that they were Men of great Genius and superior Minds, who had carried their Discoveries (particularly in Astronomy and other Parts of Mathematicks) much farther than now appears from what remains of their Wri∣tings. One may apply to them, what was said by an old learned Man, to one of less Knowledge and fewer Years, who insulted him, <HI>I have forgot more Knowledge than ever you had.</HI> More of the Antients is lost, than is preserved, and perhaps our new Disco∣veries are not equal to those old Losses.—
<PB N="31" REF="189"/>
But this was not what I had in my Thoughts, when I sat down to write: my Intention was only to express the Satisfa∣ction I had in the Perusal of what I re∣turn, of which I could say more, if the End of the Page did not admonish me to tell you how much I am &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Book intitled, <HI>Dissertation sur la Mu∣sique des Anciens,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the Abbé <HI>de Chateneuf.</HI></NOTE> I send you back, is writ∣ten in a very sensible and agreeable Manner, with a fine Turn of Thoughts and Words, as far as I am able to judge. I could wish only that the Writer had been a greater Master of his Subject, so as to have given us di∣stincter and fuller Accounts of it, which would have left no Doubts upon the Minds of his Readers. I am satisfied that a Pen like his would have been able to express the most nice and difficult Points of which he treats in a Way equally instructive and pleasing, and have opened to us in Dialogue the Mysteries of Music, as easily and fami∣liarly as Monsieur <HI>Fontenelle</HI> has done those of Astronomy. The Picture of <HI>Leontium,</HI> with which the Reflections conclude, is ex∣quisitely drawn; not only <HI>con Studio,</HI> but <HI>con Amore,</HI> as the <HI>Italians</HI> speak of the fa∣vourite
<PB N="32" REF="190"/>
Pieces of their best Masters. One would think the Book was written on pur∣pose for the sake of the Character at the End of it: as the most material Part of a Letter is sometimes carelesly thrown into a Postscript...... I dare say <HI>Madamoiselle</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A celebrated <HI>French</HI> Actress.</NOTE> <HI>Lenclos</HI> was of the Au∣thor's Acquaintance. Hear-say could not have furnished him with so lively a De∣scription of her. There is something in the Picture, that shews, it was painted by the Life, and not copied from another.... One thing he says of her, P. 9. (pardon the Remark) seems in some degree appli∣cable to himself. His Words are very good, and therefore I transcribe them. <Q REND="inline"><HI>Son gout en le conduisant de fleur en fleur, comme les Abeilles, lui fait courir indifferemment tous les pays, &amp; tous les siecles.

<P>Let me ask you for my own Information, whether <HI>tourner de tous les sens,</HI> be a proper Phrase in that Case. To me it seems to spoil the Metaphor. He cites some Au∣thorities, which I am at a Loss to explain; particularly p. 58. that of <HI>Varro de Repub. Rom. L.</HI> 1. <HI>C.</HI> 1. Sure he does not mean the antient <HI>Varro,</HI> who wrote nothing that I know of, under that Title. He is beholden, I find, to the long Chapter of <HI>Abbé du Bois,</HI> where the antient Authorities, relating to his Subject, are collected; and he has
<PB N="34" REF="192"/>
made a free Use of them. But my Inten∣tion was, to tell you rather what pleased me in the Book, than what I disliked.</P>
<P>From what I have read (in these Books) and other Pieces, since I came on this side of the Water, I have conceived a much greater Opinion of the Bishop of <HI>Meaux,</HI> than I had while in <HI>England,</HI> and give him readily the Preference to all those Writers of the Church of <HI>France</HI> which I am acquainted with. He is an universal Genius, and manages every thing he takes in Hand, like a Master. Good Sense, and sound Reflections attend all he says; which is expressed in the most agreeable and beautiful Manner, without any of the Pomp or Paint of false Oratory. He has particularly the Secret of knowing, not only what to say, but what not to say; the hardest Task even of the most exact and excellent Writers! ... But you know him, Sir, better than I; and I should be to blame therefore in attempting any Part of his Character, did not Gratitude forbid me to return your Books, without giving you an Account of the Pleasure I had in perusing them. Even the Lady's Memoirs relating to our <HI>English</HI> Princess, gave me a good deal; particularly that Part of them, where the Story of her Death is told, in as natural and affecting a Manner,
<PB N="35" REF="193"/>
I think, as is possible. It has such a me∣lancholy Air of Truth in it, as, at the same Time that it gives Conviction, moves Com∣passion; and one can no more read it, than one could have been present at the sad Scene of it, without Tears. I really pre∣fer the Bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI>'s Funeral Oration, to those of <HI>Flechier</HI> or <HI>Bourdaloüe;</HI> tho' I think he would have wrote still better, had he imitated them less; for, by that means, he now and then heightens his Expression a little too much, and becomes unnatural. I gave you one Instance of that when I saw you last.</P>
<P>The more I read of the Bishop of <HI>Meaux,</HI> the more I value him, as a great and able Writer, and particularly for that Talent of taking as many Advantages of an Adver∣sary, and giving him as few as any Man, I believe, that ever entered the Lists of Con∣troversy. There is a serious Warmth in all he says, and his manner of saying it, is noble and moving; and yet I question, after all, whether he sometimes is in good Earnest. Pardon that Freedom, Sir, I have read him with Attention, and watch∣ed him narrowly. I have read all the Bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI>'s <HI>Pieces</HI> that have been procured for me: and will wait for the rest, till I can have them from your Hands. In the mean time, I will read
<PB N="36" REF="194"/>
worse Books, that I may relish his the more, when I return to them; tho', to speak the Truth, I know no Writer in your Tongue, that has less need to have his Reader so prepared for him. Do you hear nothing from your Friend <HI>Voltaire?</HI> Is <HI>England</HI> as well pleased with him, as it was? And is he as well pleased with <HI>Eng∣land?</HI> Or, does the Satisfaction on one side abate, in Proportion as it lessens on the other? When will the second Edition of his <HI>Henriade</HI> come out? Will it afford us a better Monument to the Memory of that Prince, and a nobler Likeness, than the Statue on <HI>Pont-neuf?</HI> It will, if it be as well finished as it should be. For<Q><L>Non magis expressi vultus per ahenea signa,</L>
<L>Quàm per vatis opus mores animique virorum</L>
<L>Clarorum apparent.</L></Q></P>
<P>But the Spirit of Pedantry is coming upon me, and it is time therefore that I tell you, I am &amp;c.</P>
<P>I find the very last Works of that great Man, <HI>the Bishop of</HI> Meaux are inferior to the rest; but, nevertheless, I would be Master of all he certainly wrote. It is useful to observe even the Defects of First-rate Writers, as well as their Excel∣lencies. There is an ill-natured Pleasure in
<PB N="37" REF="195"/>
finding, that, as far exalted above us as they are, they sometimes sink down to our Level. The Bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI> studied Critical Knowledge late, with respect to the Inter∣pretation of Scripture; and was never therefore so true a Master of it, as he was of the Way of interpreting it by the Stream of Tradition. But the older he grew, the more admired he was; and that led him to think himself equal to every Man, in eve∣ry thing; and particularly to write Books in <HI>Latin,</HI> and Comments on Scripture, in both which ways I find him unequal to himself; and I dare say, that is the Opi∣nion of candid and judicious Persons in your Communion.</P>
<P>Our Friend, Father <HI>Courayer,</HI> has been pursued with Mandements, Censures and Arrêts; nor have they, I fear, yet done with him. I am concerned for the Fate of so valuable a Man, and so excellent a Writer, whose Views, I am persua∣ded, were innocent and good, however in the Manner of executing them, he comes to have given so much Offence. The twenty Bishops that have censured him, seem to decline that Part of the Dis∣pute which relates to the Validity of our <HI>English</HI> Ordinations. However, they have not spared the Church of <HI>England,</HI> on other Accounts, but have represented her
<PB N="38" REF="196"/>
in a more disadvantageous Light than she deserves; purely, I suppose, for want of knowing her. They cite the Bishop of <HI>Meaux,</HI> and cite those Works of his, which were written expresly against us; which surely is a very odd Way of representing our Sentiments; just as if I should quote Monsieur <HI>Claude</HI>'s Words, from any Pieces of his written against the Church of <HI>France,</HI> to prove what she held in any Doctrine of Importance. I should think it became me rather to produce the Writers of that Church, and the Acts and Monuments of it, for my Vouchers. The twenty Bishops have taken this Method, once or twice; and if they had taken it always, they would have been less liable to Mistakes in their Re∣presentations of us. What the Bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI> says, with regard to our Polity and Affairs, is not always to be rely'd on; for he was not a Master of that Subject. He was a very great Man; nor would he have lessened his Character, not to have aimed sometimes at seeming to know, what he really did not, in Matters that lay a little out of his Compass. Excuse the Freedom I take with the Censurers, and the Autho∣rity on which they build, in relation to our Matters; because I have good Reason to think, that they have paid a Deference to it, at the Expence of Truth. My Know∣ledge
<PB N="39" REF="197"/>
is very limited; and yet it would be no Presumption in me to say, that I know better than the Bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI> did, what is the Constitution, and what are the Prin∣ciples and Tenets of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> But enough of these Reflections, into which the Mention of Father <HI>Courayer</HI> has led me.</P>

<P>GRatissimus est mihi, Juvenis Eximie, tuus in Atrii hujusce Vestibulo occur∣sus, gratissima Oratio; quâ non tam me quàm Aedem hanc, quae bonorum semper ingeniorum nutrix habita est; ornari gau∣deo. Facile adducer ut credam; caeteros qui tuae Aetati suppares sunt, Alumnos, tibi esse quam simillimos. Ea si me haud fefellerit spes, vos ego vicissim omnia quae∣cunque a me proficisci poterint studiorum vestrorum hortamenta ac proemia, fidenter sperare jubeo.</P>

Is certè sum, qui literatam juventutem ad op∣tima quaeque feliciter nitentem summa cum voluptate intueri soleam, quique adeo cres∣centi indies vestri ordinis laudi impensè faveam. Multa de mirifico vestro erga Ar∣tes reconditas amore, de laudabili studi∣orum cursu, ac progressione discendi a Viro Optimo, Aedis hujusce Sub-Decano dignis∣simo me auditurum confido, cujus quidem Vigilantiae at{que} Industriae siqua etiam a nobis subsidia possint offerri habebit ille me cu∣rarum suarum omnium ac Consiliorum So∣cium, &amp; non inertem, ubi opus est, Ad∣jutorem.</P>

Si quis ita{que} tuo hoc dicendi artificio deceptus, meas esse putet, quae a te percensentur, virtutes, mea quae celebrantur praeconia, nolo illum in tanto errore versari; alia tibi erat Ratio, aliud longè consilium, ut tuo scilicet dum funge∣reris Officio, mihi interim meum subindi∣cares, &amp; in id totus incumberes, ut intelli∣gant qui te perorantem audiunt, non quis ego sim, sed cujusmodi is esse debeat, qui florentissimae huic Aedi cum dignitate prae∣sideat, qui tam numeroso aut doctorum aut discentium Gregi Custos admotus, tuendae Religioni, excolendis Moribus, Literis pro∣movendis ritè invigilet. Arduum sanè opus! cui tamen proficiendo in promptu erant quae sumeris.

<HEAD>TO His Excellency the Right Honourable THOMAS Lord PARKER, Lord High Chancellor of GREAT-BRITAIN, one of his Majesty's Lords Justices. LONDON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Henley, near Ludlow, <DATE>Aug. 4. 1719.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Taking <HI>London</HI> in my Way between <HI>Lewes</HI> and <HI>Kingston,</HI> came to your Lordship's House the Morning before I went to <HI>Kingston,</HI> but your Lordship was then sitting. I did then intend to have in∣formed your Lordship of what occurred in the Circuit thitherto, relating to the Pub∣lick, especially in <HI>Kent:</HI> and after I came from <HI>Kingston,</HI> I found your Lordship was gone out of Town; and before your Re∣turn I set out for my Country-concerns here in <HI>Shropshire,</HI> 'till near next Term; so that what Account I give your Lordship must be by Letter.</P>
<P>Tho' your Lordship has heard how the Verdict went in the Tryal at <HI>Ro∣chester,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Occasioned by a Charity-Sermon preached there, by one <HI>Hendley</HI> of <HI>Istington.</HI> He died not long after.</NOTE>
<PB N="55" REF="213"/>
 yet perhaps it may not be unaccept∣able to your Lordship, to have some Abstract of the Matter arising in it. I began at six in the Morning, by my Appointment, and held till twelve. The Court was very full of Clergymen, and a great Auditory; and I gave both Sides Liberty to expatiate as they pleased, especially the Defendants, that they might not say but that they had a full and fair Tryal. Most of the Witnes∣ses for the Prosecution were unwilling, and did prove the Facts but meanly; but af∣terwards the Witnesses for the Defendants did, upon questioning, prove all the Facts very fully upon all the Defendants, viz. <HI>Hendley</HI> the Preacher, the School-master and the two Collectors, being all who were served with Process. Serjeant <HI>Comins,</HI> Sir <HI>Const. Phipps</HI> and Mr. <HI>Blunden,</HI> Defendants, after an Harangue upon the Vertue of Cha∣rity, and how essential to Christianity (tho' I thought the Texts they cited proved ano∣ther sort of Charity, viz. Good-Nature and Good-Neighbourhood, but I thought it not proper then to take Notice of the Distinction) they insisted chiefly,</P>
<P N="1">1. That it would discourage all Chari∣ty, and Charity-Schools, which would thus be in Danger of Subversion.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="56" REF="214"/>
2. That every Parson might order Col∣lections, in his own Parish, for what Cha∣rities he please, especially if approved of by the Bishop.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the Rubrick in the Communion Service, a Common-Prayer Book being pro∣duced in Court, does imply that the Par∣son and the Bishop are intrusted in Col∣lections of Charity in the Church; for it says, that if the Parson and Church-war∣dens disagree in the Distribution, the Bishop shall determine.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the Parson of the Parish, and also the Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> did give <HI>Hendley</HI> Leave to preach this Sermon, for this Purpose.</P>
<P N="5">5. That tho' the Sermon was done, yet the Prayer for the holy Catholic Church at the Communion Table was not quite finish∣ed, as were not also the Sentences for ex∣citing Charity, when Mr. <HI>Farrington,</HI> the Justice of Peace, interrupted the Colle∣ction.</P>
<P N="6">6. That the two present Archbishops have preached Charity-Sermons, in <HI>London,</HI> for the Children of other Parishes there.</P>
<P N="7">7. That there is no Precedent of such an Indictment ever before.</P>
<P>Too much Time was spent on both Sides, relating to what Power the Bishops had antiently in the Distribution even of
<PB N="57" REF="215"/>
Tythes and Profits relating to the Church, and their Rights to licence Preaching, and to direct what is to be done in Churches, and that Laymen are not to intermeddle there.</P>
<P>Serjeant <HI>Darnel,</HI> Mr. <HI>Baines</HI> and Mr. <HI>Marsh</HI> were <HI>pro Rege.</HI> The Substance of what they all said is herein mentioned, in∣termixed with my own Thoughts in my summing up to the Jury.</P>
<P>I first said, that there were three Things much insisted on by the Defendants Coun∣sel, and answered by the Counsel on the other Side, which I thought ought to be pared off and put out of the Case, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. All Jealousy of discouraging all Cha∣rity and Charity-Schools; for that they re∣mained just as they were before, as long as they kept within the Bounds of their pro∣per Parishes. But tho' this Case was quite of a different Nature, relating to arbitrary Collections, and that in other Parishes, and the coming of fifty Boys and Girls toge∣ther begging for that Purpose; and if this was practised, it might do more Harm to Charity-Schools, by making them odious to their Parishes, whose Poor would be in∣jured, by lessening the Charity to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. It ought to be put out of the Case, whether Mr. <HI>Hendley</HI> was authorized to preach there, or not; for that I thought
<PB N="58" REF="216"/>
it the same Case if the Parson of the Pa∣rish himself had then preached, [It was at my Tongue's End, <HI>if the Bishop himself had preached,</HI> as indeed it was the same; but I thought it better not to heat the Question by a Supposal of the Bishop's preaching] for that the Preaching was not the Point, being used only to excite giving; but the true Point was, whether the Collection was without lawful Authority; and therefore the Collecting of it in the Church is not a Jot better, in Point of Law, than if the fifty Boys and Girls had stood at the Mar∣ket-place, and the Collectors had there re∣ceived the Charity of whom they could assemble about them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another Matter I thought proper to be pared off (tho' so much debated on both Sides) whether it was a Crime (I suppose the Crime suggested in the Bishop of <HI>Ro∣chester</HI>'s Court) to interrupt the Collection before the Prayer for the holy Catholic Church, and the Sentences for Charity, were fully read, since they thought, that if such Collecting is an unlawful Act, the proper Time to stop it is just when it be∣gins, or soon after, as here was done by Mr. <HI>Farrington;</HI> for otherwise Common-Prayer, or a Sermon might be used to ju∣stify and give a Sanction to any unlawful Act, and this Stop might as well have
<PB N="59" REF="217"/>
been in the Middle of the Common-Prayer, or of the Sermon, in case the unlawful Collection had then begun: so that the true Point is, whether the Collection was unlawful; and upon that all the Case de∣pends.</P>
<P>As for the Assertion, that every Parson of a Parish may order Collections, in his Parish for Charities, when and for what he pleases; I declared my Opinion, that he could not; it not being any Part of his Function, like reading Prayers, Preaching, Christening, Burying, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd I knew not how he was made Judge of the Times and Objects of all Charities within his Parish, tho' he might preach as much as he pleased upon the general Duty of Charity.</P>
<P>As to the Rubrick in the Communion Service, I said, I thought that was to be taken <HI>secundum subjectam materiam,</HI> viz. the ordinary Collection at the Communion, which is ever then used to be made for the Poor of that Parish, but should not extend to every Collection the Parson should ap∣point for any foreign Charity, and that I did not till now hear that the Clergy did claim such a Power. And farther I said, that I thought those Words of the Rubrick did not imply such a Power in the Parson; for the Words being [the Money given at the Offering shall be disposed of to such
<PB N="60" REF="218"/>
pious and charitable Uses as the Parson and the Church-wardens shall think fit, where∣in if they disagree, it shall be disposed of as the Ordinary shall appoint.] Such a Power of appointing a Collection at Plea∣sure is as much implied in the Church-wardens as in the Parson, for they have as much Liberty to disagree from the Par∣son in the Distribution, as the Parson has to disagree from them; and so the Church-wardens might also appoint Collections for what Charities they pleased: but that I thought that the Parson and Church-wardens, either jointly or severally, could not appoint any Collection for Charity otherwise than in common Form for the Poor of their own Parish, and that those are the charitable Uses intended by the Ru∣brick, and particularly at the Communion, to the Service of which those Words of the Rubrick are subjoined. [I hope your Lordship, on reading that Part of the Ru∣brick at the End of the Communion Ser∣vice will be of my Opinion, which I then suddenly declared, as to the Implication, and do not since alter, unless otherwise convinced.]</P>
<P>As to what was mentioned of the two present Archbishops, it was for the Poor of the same Town, tho' of a different Pa∣rish: and all the Circumstances of those
<PB N="61" REF="219"/>
Cases do not now appear, nor were they litigated, as this Case is.</P>
<P>As to the Objection, that there is no Precedent of such an Indictment ever before.</P>
<P>Sol.—There never was such an At∣tempt before, that fifty Boys and Girls should go into another Parish, in another County, and make a kind of Migration in such a Body, really begging, tho' with great Formality. And tho' much might be said (as the Counsel for the King in∣sisted) to bring them within the Statute of Vagrants, especially seeing the Stat. of 39. <HI>Eliz.</HI> C. 4. Paragr. 2. says, That all Persons calling themselves Scholars, going about begging, shall be accounted Va∣grants: yet I judged it not proper to put the Case upon that Point, when I thought it so clear otherways, and fit so to be men∣tioned.</P>
<P>I also told the Jury, that this Case did consist of two Parts: the first but parti∣cular, and the other very general.</P>
<P>As to the particular, it is relating to the Maintenance of the Poor, which is not of a Spiritual Nature, but a mere Lay-Con∣cern, and relating to the Civil Govern∣ment; and the several Acts of Parliament do plainly esteem it as such, by ordering the Rates and Collections for the Poor, and
<PB N="62" REF="220"/>
putting the whole Managment into the Lay Hands of the Justices of the Peace, and the Over-seers of the Poor, who are to be nominated by the Justices of the Peace, and accountable to them, and by their Directions to set the Poor at Work, if they thought proper; and therefore a Justice of Peace, being then in the Church, might well take it to be a Matter within his Jurisdiction, and that he might stop such a new and extraordinary Proceeding, newly begun among the Clergy, relating to the Maintenance of the Poor, and a Col∣lection made by Strangers, without the Consent or Assistance of the Church-war∣dens or Over-seers of the Poor of that Parish.</P>
<P>But this Case, if under a general Con∣sideration, is of a vast Extent, and mighty Consequence to the King and the People, and at which the very Legislature may take great Umbrage. The levying of Mo∣ney is the tenderest Part of our Constitu∣tion, and if it may be done arbitrarily, under the Shew and Form of Charity, (which may comprize all good Works and all good Intentions) it cannot be said whi∣ther it may go, any more than it can be said whither these fifty Boys and Girls may go: for as, by the same Reason, they may go into all the Parishes in <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="221"/>
so Collections, as for Charities, may be set up in all the Churches in <HI>England</HI> by the Clergy, as often as they please: and tho' it be said, it is all but Voluntary giving, yet it is a sort of Compulsion, by the Solemni∣ty in the Church, and vying with others, and being marked out, if refusing, or giving meanly.</P>
<P>In the Time of <HI>Charles</HI> I. the Parlia∣ment took great Offence at some Attempts for free Gifts to the Crown; and we hear that Cardinal <HI>Alberoni</HI> is now setting up the like all over <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>But besides, here in <HI>England</HI> no Collection, even for Charity (unless for the Poor of the same Parish) is, by Law, to be made, but by the Leave and Permission of the King, gathering of Money being so nice a Mat∣ter, that it must not be done, even for Cha∣rity, without his Leave, in the most com∣passionate Cases; and thence the antient Method of Briefs, under the Great Seal, has been used, even upon extreme great Losses by Fire. And the Stat. of 4 and 5 of <HI>Anne,</HI> have put the whole Manage∣ment of Briefs under the Regulation of the Court of Chancery, and impower the lay∣ing great Fines upon the Offenders. But this Method were giving a Go-by to all Royal Licences, and putting it in the Pow∣er of the Clergy to do all Acts of Charity of
<PB N="64" REF="222"/>
themselves at the Expence of the People, and to be sole Judges of the Occasions, and to make what Application and Ac∣count they please.</P>
<P>I told the Jury, that I was very clear of Opinion, in Point of Law, this was a Case of dangerous Consequence, and was an Invasion not only on the King's Pre∣rogative, but also upon the Legislature, and that I thought the Defendants Guilty.</P>
<P>The Jury stayed out but a little while and brought them in all Guilty. I then told the Defendants Counsel, that if they did not like my Opinion, in Point of Law, they might bring their Writ of Er∣ror; and the Indictment being so special, it did equal a special Verdict, and they might have the Opinion of a special Court, if they pleased.</P>
<P>I then set a Fine of a Noble upon each Defendant, I saying, it was so small only because it was made a Question; but now that a Verdict had settled it, there would be very heavy Fines upon those who should presume to offend in like Manner hereafter. Yet I heard that some Gentlemen in the Town had thereupon said, that I had been too favourable to them by so small Fines: but it was far from my Intention of any Favour to them, but of Service to the King; whereas, if great, it might have been said,
<PB N="65" REF="223"/>
that, while they were prosecuted for levy∣ing Money on the People, the Prosecution was only to levy Money upon them, when it was really to settle the Point: and great Fines might have raised Compassion, and perhaps a Collection for them. It would be great Satisfaction to me if your Lord∣ship be of the same Opinion with me, as to the Smallness of the Fines; I am sure I intended it for the best.</P>
<P>I gave Mr. <HI>Woodford</HI> a News-Paper, wherein was an Advertisement, which I thought very fit to be shewed to Superiors: that the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> had issued a Cir∣cular Letter, to all his Clergy, to collect Charities in their Parishes for the poor Vi∣carages in <HI>England,</HI> which I thought much of a Kin to the late Collection in <HI>Kent,</HI> or rather more dangerous, not only by raising a vast Sum of Money (if the like in all Dioceses) but also by marking out People how far affected to the Church throughout <HI>England,</HI> and casting some Reflection upon Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Bounty, and upon a benefi∣cial Explanation after by his present Ma∣jesty, yet as if to be supported by begging: and this done in a Time of Taxes, which must appear the more heavy after such Collections; and the Clergy would thus gain a Power of raising Money as they please, and applying it as they please. How
<PB N="66" REF="224"/>
this Project goes on I know not; but sure it ought to be stopped: and for that Pur∣pose, a Thing very apposite was mentioned in the Debate of the late Tryal in <HI>Kent,</HI> That commonly about <HI>Christmas,</HI> when it is hard with the Poor for want of Work, in great Frost and Snow, then the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> does send a Circular Letter, to the Parishes within the Bills of Mortality, to make Collections for the Poor, to be put into the Hands of the Lord Mayor. But it was also alledged in the same Tryal, that, pre-cedent to such Circular Letter, of that Bishop, the King sends a Letter, un∣der his Sign Manual, to that Bishop, au∣thorizing and requiring him so to do. This deserves to be inquired into, and, if true, it is a Case in Point against this new Letter of the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> if without the King's Licence.</P>
<P>A Man of <HI>Rochester,</HI> worth nothing, was convicted before me of drinking the Pretender's Health. I ordered him to be whipped, in open Market, twice, till his Back was bloody, with a Month between the first and second Whipping.</P>
<P>And at <HI>Lewes,</HI> a Man of <HI>Rye</HI> was con∣victed before me for drinking the Health of King <HI>James</HI> the Third, and saying, he knew no such Person as King <HI>George.</HI> He had run out a good Estate by Looseness, and
<PB N="67" REF="225"/>
had nothing left but an Annuity of thirty Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> for his Life. I fined him a hundred Pounds, and committed him till paid, and that he should find good Sureties for his good Behaviour for three Years next after the Payment of the Fine. I told him, that by his paying a hundred Pounds to King <HI>George,</HI> he would certainly know there is such a Person.</P>
<P>Your Lordship's Notion, against setting a State Offender in the Pillory, was certainly very right, and did so convince me, that I have ever since ordered corporal or pecuniary Punishments upon them, as having a better Effect upon shameless People, and without giving the Mob an Opportunity to be trou∣blesome.</P>
<P>I declared in all my Charges in this Circuit, as I did the two last Terms at <HI>Westminster,</HI> that the Number of base Libels, and sedi∣tious Papers, is intolerable, and that now a quicker Course will be taken about them; for that now the Government will not be so much troubling itself to find out the Authors of them, but as often as any such Papers are found on the Tables of Coffee-Houses, or other News-Houses, the Master of the House shall be answerable for such Papers, and shall be prosecuted as the Pub∣lisher of them, and let him find out the Author, Letter-Writer, or Printer, and
<PB N="68" REF="226"/>
take Care, at his Peril, what Papers he takes in.</P>
<P>This last was a Maiden Home-Circuit, which had not been known before, and is to be attributed to the late good Law of Transportation, which is well put in Ex∣ecution in the Counties near <HI>London,</HI> whence Transporting is easy, but not so well in other Parts of <HI>England.</HI> The Treasury would save much Money, partly by paying fewer Rewards of forty Pounds, and partly by not long maintaining Fel∣lows in Gaol, if some Rates were agreed to be given to Merchants to carry them off speedily.</P>
<P>Your Lordship's Order of Notification, to the Justices of Peace, had a very good Effect, for they appeared much better this Circuit than formerly, especially in <HI>Surrey,</HI> where I told them, that I would request your Lordship, that you would please to acquaint his Majesty, at his Return, how very well, in particular, his Justices of Peace in <HI>Surrey</HI> had appeared, upon his Pleasure being notified to them for that Purpose.</P>
<P>I did, in all my Charges, inform the Audience of the Occasion and Necessity of that Notification, for that there was grown a Sort of general Neglect, all over <HI>England,</HI> of the Appearance of the Justices of Peace
<PB N="69" REF="227"/>
at the Assizes, when the Judges had often Matters to inform them of, by Command of his Majesty; and Trials of Felons were often imperfect, by the Non-attendance of the committing Justice of Peace; and that their Attendance was a Respect due to the King and his Government, upon those solemn Occasions: and that it is no Hard∣ship upon them; there being three Excuses, which will be readily admitted, if, upon the Call, mentioned to the Court, barely upon the Word of some other Justice, or Proof upon Oath by some other Person. <HI>viz.</HI> 1. If not fit to travel, by Age or want of Health. 2. If living out of the County. 3. If then actually out of the County. But if Justices of Peace shall remain at home, about their private Affairs, or to avoid the Trouble of a Journey to the Assizes, it ought to be looked on as a Neglect of the Duty of their Office: for they are not called only to notify to the People, that they are in Commission, but to answer to their Names in Person.</P>
<P>Many of those in Commission do not act, and have not taken the Oath of Of∣fice: whereupon I ordered, in open Court, each Clerk of the Peace, against next Term, to transmit to your Lordship a List of such as reside in the County, and refuse to act; yet that he does, in the mean time,
<PB N="70" REF="228"/>
know of them, if they persist in such Re∣fusal; that so it may be their own doing if they are put out of the Commission, after his Majesty's Favour to them in being put in.</P>
<P>I fear I have tired your Lordship with this long, tho' abridged, Account: but your Lordship's Pardon will be an Addition to all your former Favours, to</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="creed">
<PB N="122" REF="280"/>
<HEAD>My CREED.</HEAD>
<P>I <HI>Believe</HI> in One God, Omniscient, Om∣nipotent, All-Merciful; and that Crea∣tor whose Name is Blessed, is One, and there is no Unity like His; who alone Was, Is, and Will be my God. Who by his Almighty Power in one Moment created the Heaven and Earth; whose second Thoughts cannot be more perfect than his first; and, therefore,</P>
<P>I <HI>Believe</HI> that He, the Same Instant He, replenished the World with Human Crea∣tures, Male and Female; as well as with Beasts of the Earth, and Fowls of the Air; and that his Mercy on his poor Creatures is so great, that he ordained none of them to feel the Fury of his Wrath.</P>
<P>I <HI>Believe</HI> his Wisdom to be so great, that He contrived at that Instant the Frame of all Things so wisely, that on no Manner of Event, or Accident whatsoever, he will alter his first Design of Nature, to produce that which is called a Miracle.</P>
<P>I <HI>Believe</HI> him so powerful, that without the Assistance of Angels, Devil, or any
<PB N="123" REF="281"/>
other inferior Beings, He is able to punish the Evil and reward the Good done by us Mortals; and that the same Breath of his Nostrils can annihilate all which He crea∣ted: But, if it so please Him, it may be as much to his Glory to have the World endure to Eternity.</P>
<P>I <HI>Believe</HI> the Historical Books (Part of the Old Testament) to be wrote, as other Books are, by faithful Historians; and that they contain certain select things worthy of Observation, and for Instruction, in order to the directing our Affairs in this World, and the Adoration of one God. And for the rest, which contain the Prophesies of several Persons, they were wrote according to the Style of the <HI>Eastern</HI> Nations, to re∣duce the <HI>Jews</HI> to good Living, and from the Idolatry and evil Customs of their Neighbour-Nations; and see no Reason why some of those Books called <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> should not be admitted into the same Au∣thority with the rest; since they contain as good Precepts, and the Historical Parts better confirmed by the <HI>Roman</HI> Authors of the same Time.</P>
<P>As for them of the New-Testament, I <HI>Believe</HI> they were wrote by the Followers of a Great Man, to make the rest of the World believe what they, through their Zeal and Love for his Person, saw through a
<PB N="124" REF="282"/>
Magnifying Glass, and for so much there∣of as relates to Precepts of Life and Con∣versation, very good.</P>
<P>I <HI>Believe</HI> Christ to have been a great and good Man; conceived, born, died, and was buried as other Holy-Men. For I cannot think him God Omniscient, since he Him∣self saith, that <HI>he did not know the time of the Day of Judgment, but the Father only.</HI> (Mark, Cap. 13. v. 32.)</P>
<P>I <HI>Believe</HI> he may be preferred to a nearer Participation in the Beatific Vision of God, than the rest of good Men, to incline them to live peaceably and inoffensively in this World, and to the Adoration of an Eternal Being.</P>
<P>I <HI>Believe</HI> the several Religions of this World, so far as they center in the Wor∣ship of his Holy-Name, and conduce to well Living, to be equally acceptable to him.</P>
<P>I <HI>Believe</HI> no Person hath Power to remit Sins but God himself.</P>
<P>I think the Mercy of God so much a greater Attribute than his Justice, that he will not punish eternally for a temporary Fault; since most Transgressions against the Law of Nature, meet with some Part of their Punishment in this World, and that there cannot be a Rational Being, who can deny a Deity and the Providence thereof.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<P>IF obliging Expressions, fine Wit, and noble Sentiments can tempt; you have the most infallible Way of compelling your Friends to write to you, of any body I know; yet should my Ignorance in the Modes of writing cause you to esteem me less, I shall repent my having learnt to write.</P>
<P>Your excellent Judgment, and the Diffi∣dence I justly bear to my own Abilities, al∣ways put a Check to that sincere and ho∣nest Warmth I am impatient to address you with: But when I reflect on your many Friendly Indulgencies, and see two kind Let∣ters of yours now before me (both un∣answer'd) I plunge in Ink, lest my Silence should be more criminal than Impertinence itself. Remember, however, it is in com∣pliance to your Request, and no fancied Skill of mine, in drawing Characters. You are

<P>Ought I not, my Friend, to be cautious in discovering the Blemishes and Defects of this my native Spot, to One so resolutely deter∣mined to Publish all the Truths he knows of it, even the worst, with the Sincerity and Ju∣stice of an unconcerned Historian. Now, methinks, I see you smile, and ask me, What is it you thus endeavour to conceal? Is not the Fidelity of your Island become a Proverb; your Policy a Jest; your Politeness, Wantonness and Mimickry; your Commerce, a Combination of protected Thieves, the Bane of Industry and Trade? Nor is there any other Sign of Divinity or Liberty re∣maining with you, except the opening of your Churches and the Courts of Justice; in a Word it is become the Characteristic of the <HI>English;</HI> that they account it less Glo∣rious to act wisely, than to defend the do∣ing otherwise. Yes, there is too much Truth in your Remarks, the Remembrance of Vir∣tue is almost lost, and if any retain Senti∣ments of Honesty and Religion they must be very secret, if they would escape the

Public Laughter. This may be an Excuse for the Son of your Friend; he came Green upon the Stage, was hurried into the Triumph of Vice, and bore down by the Torrent of Corruption, his Beauty and Comeliness of Parts

They were the prevailing Party, in whose Society he squander'd an Estate dishonourably, and now (I had almost said deservedly) seeks a servile Maintenance from that Sink—a Court—his fall occasioned this Reflection of mine on Beauty; with which I'll conclude.</P>
<L>Beauty doth recommend, the Bearer to</L>
<L>Our Notice; and works a kind Impression</L>
<L>On all Spectators, in its own Behalf.</L>
<L>But if it bring not Matter of more Worth,</L>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL the Books which have been Pub∣lished here, worthy Notice, I have constantly sent as you directed; if I have with-held my Opinion of their Merit, as you complain, it was for many Reasons I judged it unnecessary. Why do you so continually attack my Vanity, by the Compliments you pay my Judgment? But since you seek some Particulars of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> whose Writings I profess, amongst Thousands, to be an Ad∣mirer of, as I have often intimated; I will take this Occasion to inform you what I know concerning him. Many Pieces of his, The Essay on Criticism. The Rape of the Lock. The Essays and Dissertations on <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI> have appeared in your Parts: and one Proof of their Excellency, is their being na∣turalized by Persons of very eminent Ability and Rank<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See our former Volume.</NOTE>. Other Languages<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They have been translated both into <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian.</HI></NOTE> are inrich'd
<PB N="154" REF="312"/>
with these and others of his Works; yet, would you believe it, He has translated <HI>Homer,</HI> preserved the Sublimity, Strength, Harmony, Closeness, and every other Ex∣cellence of that venerable Poet, without knowing a Syllable of <HI>Greek;</HI> and with an absolute Ignorance of the <HI>English.</HI> His Essay on Criticism, is a smooth Repetition of <HI>Vida's</HI> Nonsense. His Pastorals are no Pasto∣rals. Nor is he a Poet. These things are brayed about our Street. The <HI>Asinorum cre∣pitus,</HI> the Din of <HI>Grubstreet,</HI> Pretenders to Poetry, and false Critics, have arose to poison our Judgments; some say he is too little to write Well; others that he has only a Knack of writing, and these Wretches all write themselves, to convince us it is without a Knack; Cellars are full of their Mur∣murings, where, like so many merciless Chy∣mists, they violently rack and torture Na∣ture to confess some Worth she has not in her. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is accounted by those, not his Enemies, of over-much Borrowing; this you will rather praise then disapprove, when you shall know, that the finest Thoughts of the best Writers were never made use of by him, till he had improved and made them bet∣ter.

<P>FORGIVE me, if I obtrude my Advice; think not of Publishing, as yet. Your Works, like fine Painting and Wine, will ripen into more Worth by Age; you should certainly complete the Catastrophe. I re∣joice you have resisted the Temptation offer'd; it would be Madness to throw an Appearance of Partiality on the Face of your Performance, which you have so bravely avoided in every other Part. The Devil is black enough in his real Character; the truer you can paint him, the more damnable he will appear. I can but laugh to see what an Appearance Kings, and Mi∣nisters, (the Guardians of Kings) make, when they are shewn in History, strip'd of Courtiers and Attendants. If in their Lives they had few sure Friends, after their Deaths they shall have fewer. It is then that are Glory is taken from their Heads, and their Pride trampled on. Are they not

I was the other Day at a Great Man's Levée; it made me shudder: He was corpulent and gross of Body; and seem'd to me as if Fatning for some Sacrifice. I then thought a corrupt Minister, surrounded by his Creatures and Mercenaries, like the Man, who by unlaw∣ful Practices had obtained the Services of evil Spirits, and thinks it noble to be at∣tended on by Friends, but yet expects in the End, that they will tear him to Pieces.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>N.B.</HI> Here I strongly smell another Plot, and Abbe <HI>C—n,</HI> certainly lives at <HI>Twickenham.</HI> By the Help of <HI>Fortunatus</HI>'s <HI>Cap,</HI> Mr. <HI>POPE</HI> has made the Tour of St. <HI>Omers,</HI> in order, <HI>1.</HI> to <HI>satyrize</HI> the Conduct of the present Ministry; <HI>2.</HI> to <HI>white∣wash</HI> himself; and, <HI>3.</HI> to <HI>compliment</HI> his Friend Mr. <HI>Gay,</HI> to whom the Three foregoing Letters were written, as surely as those in the former Volume: For the <HI>Works</HI> of his <HI>Friend,</HI> and the <HI>Catastrophe</HI> of his <HI>Play,</HI> evidently allude to the <HI>Beggars Opera.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>I Shall now begin to trouble you of∣ten, believing you are settled in the Office, which will be another Sort of Life than that in <HI>France;</HI> but when I consider you have so worthy a Person, and so good a Friend to act under, I then think nothing can stand in Conpetition with it. I shall be every Day more sen∣sible of the Loss of you here, which I hope you will make up to me, by let∣ting me hear often from you. I have acquainted my Lord <HI>Jersey</HI> with what pas∣sed in Relation to me and the <HI>Portugal</HI> Embassador in the Apartment of Monsieur <HI>de Torcy.</HI> He is going away, else it would be impossible but there must be farther Disputes of that Nature. The first Opportunity I have, I shall certainly return his Rudeness. When you can do it conveniently, put my Lord <HI>Jersey</HI> in

Mind of what we have often discoursed about, in Relation to the Affairs of <HI>France,</HI> and what he was so kind as to say he would prevent, if possible, when I had the Honour of seeing him last. You can easily imagine I shall not be able to obtain any Thing of this Court, if Matters of Moment must be only transacted by Mon∣sieur <HI>de Tallard.</HI> Not that I am desirous of knowing more than what he would think proper, in the Post I am in. I need not tell you that as a great Expence is necessary here, so an Esteem for the Person is as much; and I flatter myself I) shall not forfeit it, unless this Court finds I am only here to make a Show.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>de Tallard</HI> is daily expected, and it may be will still make his Com∣plaints, as formerly, of the Delays he meets with in <HI>England.</HI> If so, I can now answer him much better, by what I have seen since my coming here.</P>
<P>The Day of Parade is near, and, with the Help of the Advice you give me, it will go well. The Calash is done, and I like it; though I assure you the Coaches I brought from <HI>England</HI> do exceed it in gilding, painting and carving. All who see it do own, and the <HI>French</HI> confess, they cannot come up to our gilding, though they pretend theirs will last longer. I

<P>HAving writ so lately, by Mr. <HI>Stan∣hope,</HI> to the Earl of <HI>Jersey,</HI> I do not trouble him now. I must desire you to make my Excuse, and acquaint him with the Contents of this. There is no∣thing at present acting at <HI>St. Germains,</HI> King <HI>James</HI> being not well, and wholly giving himself up to Devotions and Pray∣ers. The Wound, which was very large, is healed; but it is thought they have done it too soon, because the same Hu∣mours run all over his Body, sometimes in his Stomach, Legs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He is ex∣tremely broke, and most Men are of Opi∣nion he cannot recover, though he may go on some Time as he is. Father <HI>Cosme</HI> is run away with fifty thousand Livres, which he had in his Hands, and which he was to distribute among the <HI>Irish.</HI> They think he may be gone for <HI>England,</HI> since he cannot be safe in any other Place.

If I learn any Thing of him you shall hear from me: nevertheless it may not be improper to make some Inquiry after him; and you will find by my former Accounts where his Acquaintance live in <HI>London.</HI> I was Yesterday at <HI>Versailles,</HI> where I made a Compliment to the King and the rest of the Court, it being New-Years Day.

<P>WE have this Morning two Posts from <HI>France,</HI> of the 20th and 23d. My Lord <HI>Jersey</HI> commands me to acknowledge your Letter to him; and to tell you, that the House of Lords sit∣ting so late, and he being obliged, after

its rising, to go to <HI>Kensington,</HI> is the Rea∣son why he does not write to you. You will see, by the Inclosed, what a Day's Work has been performed in the House of Commons; the <HI>Irish</HI> Grants to be reassumed, and not even the third Part of them to be reserved to the King; and the Ministry, some of our Friends parti∣cularly, meaned and aimed at in the latter Part of their Vote. This all comes like a Torrent; and the few who would, can∣not. In the House of Lords, the King is a little more civilly used. As to the Business of <HI>Darien,</HI> his Majesty is at least justified in his Letters to the Governors of the Plantations. Thus we are, my good Lord, scrambling, and doing our best on one Side against the other, who are very troublesome, not to say danger∣ous.</P>
<P>We hear of the Complaints you make from Monsieur <HI>de Tallard,</HI> and prepare to redress them as well as we can. As to the Persons mentioned in your Letter, Care will be taken.</P>
<P>The King has not yet seen Lord <HI>Bazil,</HI> or any Address from him. I do not hear that this Lord's Countrymen are quieter: I know not how far your House's Resolu∣tion of to Day will go towards calming them. I am ever, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

the King, he answered very civilly, but smartly: I have not yet the Words, but shall send them with the first.

<P>OUR long Session is this Day, God be thanked, finished; the <HI>Irish</HI> Grants resumed, and the Commons satis∣fied, at least for some Time. Yesterday was indeed a great Crisis, from the Morn∣ing, when it was doubtful if the Lords would adhere to their Amendments or no; the Commons fell directly upon Impeach∣ing. The Persons they named were my

Lords <HI>Portland</HI> and <HI>Albemarle,</HI> the Arti∣cles upon which they were going, for pro∣curing for themselves exorbitant Grants. In this State the Affair lasted till after the second Conference with the Lords; and immediately upon the Managers re∣turning from the Conference, the House, though they thought the Lords would recede, locked themselves up till ten at Night, of which you see the good Effects in the Votes. They threw Fire about at every Body, had a great Mind to fling at our Friend <HI>Charles;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Late Earl of <HI>Halifax.</HI></NOTE> you see what they would have done to my Lord Chan∣cellor, and how Duke <HI>Schomberg</HI> and Lord <HI>Portland</HI> suffer in their Address, that Strangers shall not be Privy-Counsellors.

<P>The Affair upon which I came into <HI>France,</HI> will be quite ended to Night. Your Lordship will pretend, in any Dis∣course you may have on that Subject, to think it was quite ended three Weeks since, or at least, that you heard nothing to the contrary. I hope my Lord <HI>Man∣deville</HI>

take the Opportunity of Mr. <HI>Chetwynd</HI>'s Return, to tell your Lordship what I know of the State of Things here. That we shall have a new Parliament is, I think, certain; at least as far as I can see into the Matter. What Sort of Parliament it may prove, I cannot any Ways foresee; but sure there never was so much Work, as at present, in securing Parties and bri∣bing Elections. Whig and Tory are rail∣ing, on both Sides, so violent, that the Government may easily be over-turned by the Madness of either Faction. We take it to be our Play to do nothing against common Sense or common Law, and to be for those who will support the Crown, rather than oblige their Party; and in order to this, Men are preferred who are looked upon to be honest and moderate. In this Number (whether with Reason or not, Time must decide) we comprehend our Lord-Keeper and our new Secretary. Lord <HI>Rochester</HI> and Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> are in the Cabinet-Council; the latter is at the Head of the Treasury; the former (we take it for granted) is to go Lord-Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> though it be yet a Secret. The two Companies are to be brought to an Agreement. (if possible) and Mr. <HI>Montague</HI>'s being made a Peer (we take for granted) may con∣tribute
<PB N="37" REF="356"/>
to this Union, since, being in the House of Commons, he would make an ill Figure, if he either declined to sup∣port the new, or should find too great an Opposition in his endeavouring so to do. As to the Great Affair, I presume the King will wholly defer it to the Parlia∣ment, and act conjointly with their Con∣sent, which I take to be the only Method. All that I can say more on this Head is, that I take it to be happy for the King, that the Will is preferred, by the <HI>French,</HI> at a Time when every Body was peevish against the Court (though with Reason God knows) about the Treaty. Count <HI>Tallard</HI> makes a foolish Figure here: I do not know, as yet, what he says to the King on this Occasion; but every Body observes his Excellency to be very melan∣choly and desponding, and one may judge he has Reason to be so, as to his own Particular, concerning the Part he has been made to act, however his Country in general may approve their Monarch's Breach of Truth and Treaty. This I think is the present Figure of our Affairs, which I am glad to write to so good a Friend as my Lord <HI>Manchester,</HI> though to most of the World here, I am of Opi∣nion that to say least is to do best. Your Friend my Lord <HI>Jersey</HI> grows very much
<PB N="38" REF="357"/>
a Minister, and is in a fair Way of being very great. As to my own Affairs, I have a great many Friends who would set me up at <HI>Cambridge:</HI> I know I shall find great Opposition from Mr. <HI>Ham∣mond</HI>'s Party there, and great Trouble, in case I should throw him out, from those Men, who will never be satisfied, let me act as I will or can.

<OPENER><DATELINE>Tunbridge-Wells, <DATE>Aug. 28, 1698.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HAving your Majesty's Permission to try if the Waters would contribute to the Re-establishment of my Health, I was just got to this Place when I had the Honour of your Commands. I thought the best Way of executing them would be to communicate to my Lord <HI>Orf.</HI> Mr. <HI>Mont.</HI> and the D. of <HI>Shrew.</HI> (who before I left <HI>London</HI> had agreed upon a Meet∣ing about that Time) the Subject of my Lord <HI>P</HI>'s Letters, at the same Time let∣ting them know how strictly Your Ma∣jesty required, that it should remain an inviolable Secret.</P>
<P>Since them Mr. M. and my Secretary are come down hither; and, upon their whole Discourse, three Things have prin∣cipally occurred, and are humbly suggest∣ed to your Majesty.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the entertaining a Proposal of this Nature seems to be attended with very many ill Consequences, if the <HI>F.</HI> did not act a sincere Part. But we were soon at Ease as to any Apprehension of this Sort; being fully assured Your Majesty
<PB N="42" REF="361"/>
would not act but with the utmost Nice∣ty in an Affair wherein the Glory, and the Safety of <HI>Europe</HI> were so highly con∣cerned.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second Thing considered was, the very ill Prospect of what was like to happen upon the Death of the King of <HI>Sp.</HI> in Case nothing was done, previously, towards the providing against that Acci∣dent, which seemed probably to be very near; the King of <HI>F.</HI> having so great a Force, in such a Readiness, that he was in a Condition to take Possession of <HI>Sp.</HI> before any other Prince could be ready to make a Stand. Your Majesty is the best Judge, whether this be the Case, who are so perfectly informed of the Circumstances of Parts abroad. But so far as relates to <HI>England,</HI> it would be Want of Duty not to give Your Majesty this clear Account, That there is a Dead∣ness and Want of Spirit in the Nation universally, so as not at all to be disposed to the Thought of entering into a new War, and that they seemed to be tired out with Taxes, to a Degree beyond what discerned, till it appeared upon the Occasion of the late Elections. This is the Truth of the Fact, upon which Your Majesty will determine what Resolutions are proper to be taken.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="43" REF="362"/>
3. That which remained was, the Con∣sideration what would be the Condition of <HI>Europe,</HI> if the Proposal took Place. Of this we thought ourselves little capa∣ble of judging: But it seemed, that if <HI>Si∣cily</HI> was in the Hands of the <HI>F.</HI> they would be entirely Masters of the <HI>Levant</HI> Trade; that if they were possessed of <HI>Final,</HI> and those Ports on that Side, whereby <HI>Milan</HI> would be intirely shut out from Relief or any other Commerce, that Duchy would be of little Signification in the Hands of any Prince; and that if the King of <HI>F.</HI> was in Possession of any Part of <HI>Guipuscoa,</HI> which is mentioned in the Proposal, besides the Ports he would have in the Ocean, it does seem he would have as easy a Way of invading <HI>Sp.</HI> on that Side, as he now has on the Side of <HI>Catalonia.</HI> But it is not to be hoped, that <HI>F.</HI> will quit its Pretences to so great a Succession, without considera∣ble Advantages; and we are all assured your Majesty will reduce the Terms as low as can be done, and make them as far as is possible in the present Circum∣stances of Things, such as may be some Foundation of the future Quiet of the Kingdom; which all your Subjects can∣not but be convinced is your true Aim. If it could be brought to pass, that <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="363"/>
might be some Way a Gainer by this Transaction, whether it was by the Elec∣tor of <HI>Bavaria</HI> (who is the Gainer by your Majesty's Interposition in this Trea∣ty) his coming to an Agreement to let us have some Trade to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Planta∣tions, or in any other Manner, it would wonderfully indear your Majesty to your <HI>English</HI> Subjects.</P>
<P>It does not appear, in Case this Nego∣ciation should proceed, what is to be done on your Part, in Order to make it take Place; whether any more be re∣quired than that the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> sit still, and <HI>F.</HI> itself is to see it executed; and if that be so, what Security ought to be expected, that, if our being nearer the <HI>French</HI> be successful, they will con∣fine themselves to the Terms of the Trea∣ty, and not attempt to make farther Ad∣vantages of their Success.</P>
<P>I have put the Seal to the Commission, without expecting the Return of the Warrant. The Commission is written by Mr. Secretary, and no Creature has the least Knowledge of any Thing, besides the Persons already named. I pray God give your Majesty Honour and Success in all your Undertakings.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had not Time to write to you from <HI>Dusseldorp,</HI> neither was their any Thing material that required Haste. I came thither on the 4th, about Noon; and I had an Audience of the Elector this Evening: where, after a Compliment in the Name of her Majesty, I acquainted him with my Orders, in Relation to his Interests at the Court of <HI>Vienna;</HI> and that the Queen's Minister, who was go∣ing to reside there, would have the same Instructions. He expressed a very great Sense of her Majesty's Goodness to him, and he did enter into the whole Matter of his Right to the <HI>Upper-Palatinate,</HI> with some Warmth, complaining of the Usage of that Court. He mentioned, be∣sides his several Titles, also a Treaty between the late Emperor and him, where∣in it is agreed, that he shall be put in Pos∣session:
<PB N="49" REF="368"/>
which is since renewed by the present Emperor. I told him, it was of the last Importance, that his Troops in <HI>Italy</HI> should be immediately recruited; that her Majesty did not doubt but he had put it in such a Method as that I might find them so at my Arrival in <HI>Italy.</HI> I must confess that I very much fear it, though I am persuaded he will do all that is pos∣sible, for he seemed not to disguise the Difficulties he was under; as that his Of∣ficers were but lately arrived from <HI>Italy,</HI> and that the last Accounts he had, were that his Troops were at the Blockade of <HI>Cremona;</HI> that he was buying a Battalion at <HI>Onspach,</HI> and that nothing should be wanting that was in his Power to do. As to the Affair on the <HI>Upper-Rhine,</HI> he says, there will be an Army of 60,000 Men; that the Emperor will make his 12,000; the <HI>Circles</HI> have agreed on 20,000. This, with the Rest who are there, and will be there, makes up the Num∣ber: That there was also Care taken for a sufficient Quantity of Ammunition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> His two chief Ministers were to see me, and I did find them agree in every Thing the Elector had told me. I did press them also about the Recruits in <HI>Italy.</HI> The next Day I had an Audience of the Electoress, and in the Evening I took
<PB N="50" REF="369"/>
Leave of both them. I need not mention the Expressions they both made Use of in Relation to her Majesty, and how great a Sense they should ever have of it. The Electoress recommended to me the Inte∣rest of their House, and also that of <HI>Flo∣rence.</HI> I found by the Elector, that the Great Duke had agreed to pay 100,000 Pistoles; but that the <HI>Imperial</HI> Court insisted on 300,000, which he thought very extravagant, and which they seemed to own at <HI>Vienna,</HI> but that they thought it just, since he contributed, and was one of the chief Instruments in procuring the Will in Favour of the Duke of <HI>Anjou.</HI> That they threatened to send Troops thi∣ther, as also to <HI>Genoua,</HI> in Case they would not pay what was demanded. I cannot tell what may be the Consequence, in Case the <HI>Imperial</HI> Court should carry this Matter too far. But if these Sums are actually employed in carrying on the War in <HI>Italy,</HI> we have no great Reason to complain. The Elector of <HI>Mayence</HI> being at <HI>Bamberg</HI> I shall not wait on him, but to-morrow I shall set out for <HI>Vienna,</HI> where I shall certainly be in ten Days. I suppose the Wind has been contrary, for I have received no Letters, nor shall I now till I come to <HI>Vienna,</HI> where I shall pursue my Instructions, and acquaint you how I find Matters there.

<P>I Arrived here on the 21st, and had been here sooner, had I not met with contrary Winds on the <HI>Danube;</HI> though I find it would have been much the same Thing; for this Week every one is in De∣votion. I have nevertheless seen Monsieur <HI>Zinzendorf,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>Wratislaw,</HI> and did not fail to take the first Opportunity to shew them the ill Consequence to the intended Design of prosecuting the War into <HI>France,</HI> should they first undertake that of <HI>Naples;</HI> and I did acquaint them with the Orders I had received from her Majesty. As for Count <HI>Zinzendorf,</HI> he was not so positive as the latter; but they both agreed in this; that it would not in the least prejudice that Undertaking: for, since the <HI>French</HI> were intirely out of <HI>Italy,</HI> there were Troops sufficient for both: that Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> was to stay, though his Presence would have been of very great Consequence: that they had given their Reasons to Monsieur <HI>Dopf,</HI> which they hoped would satisfy her Majesty, as
<PB N="52" REF="371"/>
also the States-General. I had a great Deal of Discourse on that Subject, with the latter, who I fear has no great Opi∣nion of the Project, concerted with the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI> When I pressed that Matter, he did say, that, by the grand Alliance, that of <HI>Naples</HI> was first to be undertaken, and that the Emperor was not able to sustain this War with some Assistance of that Nature: that every Thing was ready here, and they had Rea∣son to believe they should succeed with a small Number of Troops. I do not doubt but her Majesty is already informed of the Reasons they alledge, and I cannot but think, though they do not positively own it, that the Orders are already gone to <HI>Italy.</HI> I have not as yet seen the Prince of <HI>Salms,</HI> he being indisposed.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY the last Post I acquainted my Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> with my Pro∣ceedings here; and I have every little to add. The Emperor returns from <HI>Luxen∣burg</HI> to-day, and I suppose I shall have my Audience of the Empress to-morrow. That of the Empress Dowager is over. Here are no Letters yet from <HI>England,</HI> so that I continue, as often as I see the Ministers, to persuade them to lay aside the Expedition to <HI>Naples,</HI> which I believe they will do, unless it be approved of by her Majesty. What makes them more zealous in that Matter is, the Apprehen∣sion that, in <HI>Holland,</HI> they might be brought to consent to the dismembering it from the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy; and if once they are in Possession of it, <HI>England</HI> will never consent to it. They flatter themselves that, upon their appearing, the People will declare. As to the in∣tended Expedition into <HI>France,</HI> it is cer∣tain that this Court has sent the Recruits they promised, as also the Mounting for
<PB N="54" REF="373"/>
their Horse. They also assure me, that they are doing what is necessary in Re∣lation to their Magazines: but I am con∣fident that, in this, they will fall short; and I can easily perceive, that their Mean∣ing is only till their Troops can enter into <HI>France,</HI> and then they must subsist themselves, or we must do it; which I find is the true Reason which makes them say, that of <HI>Provence</HI> is most prac∣ticable, because, as I suppose, they think they can be subsisted by our Fleet. They assure me, that what is agreed on will be performed. They wait, with a great Deal of Impatience the Success of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough.</HI> Count <HI>Piper</HI> did deliver a Memorial to the Emperor's Mi∣nisters, in Relation to the Battalion of <HI>Muscovites,</HI> in such Terms that he could not receive it. They did afterwards make some Alterations, but in Substance it is the same. You will soon see the true In∣tentions of this Court, in Relation to the Malecontents; for they have seemed of late to desire an Accommodation; but it was on such Terms that they might easily judge were impossible. So that Matter is at an End, and they have procured a Bull, from the Pope, for the excommu∣nicating of Prince <HI>Rogotzky,</HI> and the Rest of the considerable Men of the Catholics.
<PB N="55" REF="374"/>
Whether it goes so far as to all who ad∣here to them, I cannot tell. This is at present a Secret, but I suppose it will soon be otherwise, if they intend it shall have any Effect. I should imagine that they will not find their Account in it. It may be the Means to exasperate them, and it may possibly induce them to quit that Religion.</P>
<P>I am doing all I can in the Affair of the Duke of <HI>Savoy:</HI> I hope I shall soon bring it to some Conclusion. I wait to see what Orders I shall receive, for I believe there are some to come which do not please this Court. After that I shall go to <HI>Turin.</HI> I find they intend to send Count <HI>Galas</HI> for the <HI>Hague,</HI> and Count <HI>Questenberg</HI> for <HI>England.</HI> This is what Monsieur <HI>Galas</HI> does not like, and his Gentleman of the Horse is come here on that Account.

<P>I Received this Morning the Honour of your Excellency's Letter of <HI>April</HI> 30. I am heartily glad your Excellency has had so much Success as to shake that Court from their speculative Expedition against <HI>Naples:</HI> but I am very sorry, that the Misfortune of our Army in <HI>Spain</HI> is an irresistible Argument to lay aside whol∣ly that Project. The Accounts we have of this Disaster are only got from <HI>France;</HI> yet they bring too many Marks of Truth not to be credited, so far as that we have received a very great Loss there. The Queen has done all that is possible on the sudden Event; and, in this great Uncer∣tainty, Orders are gone, this Night, to encourage the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> to keep firm to the Alliance, and likewise to <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> to consult with them the best Way to recover the Blow: But all this will be to no Purpose, unless the Emperor will exert himself on this Occasion, not only to lay aside the Expedition to <HI>Naples,</HI> to push vigorously into <HI>France,</HI> but also to

<P>Christianity, common Humanity, and my Profession obliges me to do every Bo∣dy all the real Service I can; but the Civility, the kind and friendly Welcome, which you have always received me with, does more particularly oblige me to do all I can to promote your Satisfaction; therefore let me put you in a Way to be
<PB N="63" REF="382"/>
easy in this World, and happy in the next. Don't imagine now that you are fated to be unhappy: There's no such Thing: God puts it in all our Powers to be happy; it is we make ourselves mise∣rable: The Reason we don't find Happi∣ness, is, that we seek it <HI>without</HI> us, and would rather bring Things to agree with our Humour, than suit our Humour to what happens. Let us do as <HI>Mahomet</HI> did, when he called to the Mountain to come to him, to shew a Miracle to his gaping Disciples, and the sullen Moun∣tain did not stir: He said to them, with all the Chearfulness in the World, since the Mountain will not come to <HI>Mahomet, Mahomet</HI> shall go to the Mountain; and so climbing up he pleased the People, and was perfectly satisfied himself. Since therefore Happiness is to be found only within, give me Leave to draw your Picture, by setting the Mirror of Truth before you; which if you view atten∣tively, and without Partiality, you'll find your Happiness and lay hold of it: I don't mean your outward Form; or what fluttering Fellows call Roses, Lillies, Dia∣monds, Pearls, Balls of Snow, and Bow∣ers of Bliss; should I attempt it I might do you as much Wrong as the Painter has done: I don't mean what may be seen or
<PB N="64" REF="383"/>
felt, but what may be heard or under∣stood: Your Inside therefore is doubly, composed of <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Self,</HI> which God having made, united together like Man and Wife: Now they can never be parted from one another whilst Life continues, and yet they often jar by the Devil's sub∣tle Arts, who continually endeavours to set them at Variance; in which when he succeeds he makes a Person miserable: But when <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Self</HI> go Hand in Hand, <HI>Soul,</HI> like a good Husband, by his strong Reason, governing with easy Sway, and <HI>Self,</HI> diffident of her own Strength, gladly submitting to be govern∣ed; how bless'd are both! Guardian Angels attend to protect them, and no∣thing from without can disturb their Hap∣piness: But if <HI>Soul</HI> happens to be pusil∣lanimous or tyrannical; or if <HI>Self</HI> gets it in her Head to wear the Breeches, then all the Guardian Angels leave <HI>Self,</HI> and the Devil sends Evil Genii to take Pos∣session, and stir up all the Passions to be∣come Tormentors of <HI>Self,</HI> which before that, were all her Servants very submissive and useful when <HI>Soul</HI> helped to keep them under. On the other Hand, the Evil Genii are so continually contending with harrassing <HI>Soul</HI>'s Guardians, that they grow tired, and soon sleep, regardless of
<PB N="65" REF="384"/>
their Charge; then does Unhappiness fill the whole mortal Frame; then it is we feel all the Racks and Tortures possible; and if we are now and then easy, it is when we are in most Danger; it is then the black Genii have put on the Apparel of the sleeping Angel, and makes us mis∣take Evil for Good: This is my poor Friend's Case at present; but <HI>Soul</HI> has still Force enough left to overcome <HI>Self,</HI> and Reason to bring it to a right Tem∣per, if we can but rouse <HI>Soul</HI>'s Guardi∣ans to our Assistance, which we will do, by drawing <HI>Self</HI>'s Picture as it is at pre∣sent; but I am afraid you'll scarce know or own it, on Account of its Deformity: But if you do know it, and bring it to an <HI>Examen,</HI> a little Conversation with <HI>Soul</HI> will strangely mend it, and then Reason will make the Colours have a quite contrary Effect to Sir <HI>Godfrey Kneller</HI>'s; for they will brighten and beautify by Time, and the Picture which was shock∣ing will become the Admiration of all Beholders. I have been thus long before I begin to draw, to prepare you; and in Order to make you read with Patience, I promise you that <HI>Soul</HI>'s Picture which follows after this, will please better.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="385"/>
First then, <HI>Self</HI> is plaguy forgetful▪ she does not remember that ever she was younger or handsomer; she does not re∣member that ever she was worse in Cir∣cumstances, and much unhappier than she is at present; she does not remember the Time when she was much less respected than she is at present; she does not re∣member that she was taught, and should believe, that Religion is the most useful Thing in Life; and I am afraid poor <HI>Self</HI> has forgot to say her Prayers.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly, Self</HI> is very vain and arrogant; for <HI>Self</HI> does not attribute her good Suc∣cess to the Blessing and unbounded Mercy of Providence, but fancies that all is ow∣ing to Wit and Beauty, and a fine Voice; but to snow you how much <HI>Self</HI> is mis∣taken, tho' you may have these Qualities, remember, that the Captain is no Judge, and all is a Gift from Heaven: It is a Sign of too much Arrogance in <HI>Self,</HI> to let the World, and every new Ac∣quaintance see, that she manages All, by too often exposing the Weakness of her Consort; for tho' some may praise that Spirit which conquers a Man, others will put wrong Constructions upon it, not only reflecting upon <HI>Self's Choice,</HI> which calls her Judgment in Question, but say hard Things, tho' very undeserved;
<PB N="67" REF="386"/>
and <HI>Self</HI> wont believe it without she hears it; however, when <HI>Soul</HI> gets the Ma∣nagement again, <HI>Self</HI> will only do it in Cases of Necessity, and before particular Friends.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, Self</HI> is very short-sighted, and a little Dust, called <HI>Praise,</HI> thrown into her Eyes, makes her quite blind; for otherwise she would not do the very same Thing she blames and dislikes in Others: <HI>Self</HI> will often swallow down a Heap of Flattery offer'd by Sneerers, drink Poison because sweeten'd with Honey, and believes the Givers to be sincere, tho' the next Moment they expose the Credulity of the Person who they here have been praising: If they call her a Goddess, she believes herself Divine, and expects to be worshipped; if the next that comes pays no Homage, but is more sincere, and gives Advice or Re∣proof, he is called an Enemy, or at least said to be very ill bred; and if any comes to mortify her with direct Contradiction, she could crush him to Atoms, and if she has no Power to hurt him, she will tear and pinch her own Flesh. Tho' it was ridiculous in <HI>Teague</HI> to say, <HI>Arra Faith my Master, was my very good Friend and a Man of Sense, and I am a very ho∣nest Man;</HI> and in somebody else to say, <HI>Do you know what it is to affront one of</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="387"/>
<HI>my Character, I am a S—;</HI> yet if <HI>Self</HI> could remember, she often says the very same Things in other Words. But when <HI>Soul</HI> teaches, <HI>Self,</HI> even as a Dart thrown from an Enemy that wounds, may be made useful; if the Point be taken off, it will prove a good Walking-Cane to help <HI>Self</HI> to go upright.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly, Self</HI> is very passionate, and therefore cannot bear to be controul'd; she thinks him an Enemy that does it in Earnest, and believes he can be no Friend that does it in Jest: She miscalls her Passions, not to part with them; Rage she calls High-Spirit and Courage; and filling in with her Humour, True Friend∣ship; but she is a great Coward; tho' she can scratch and tear: If I mistake not, <HI>Self</HI> is terribly afraid of <HI>Self,</HI> and the Thoughts of being alone is a most uncomfortable Prospect: To have One that we can unbosom to without Reserve or Fear, may be called having a Friend; but it is not natural Friendship to have One that shall love where we love, and hate because we hate, without any Re∣gard to the Unreasonableness of every Passion, or the Justice or Injustice of Af∣fection and Resentment; this is by no Means to be called Friendship; it is only a Union of Interest; God forbid that
<PB N="69" REF="388"/>
should be called Friendship. Can High∣waymen be called Friends? Yet they do all this, they sing together, they kill together, they eat, drink, and whore together; but as they don't act upon Principle, upon the least Jar, or falling out, they hang one another. Friendship is a Virtue, and nothing of Crime can be consistent with it: Follies and Weaknes∣ses we cannot be without in this L se; but a true Friendship is to pity and forgive, not to encourage them: It is having a Slave and fawning Parasite, not a Fri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, to have such a One as <HI>Self</HI> calls so: A True Friend will advise, and repro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ and condemn <HI>Self</HI> for the Sake of <HI>Soul,</HI> even to the Hazard of disobliging <HI>Self:</HI> A Friend must help us to curb our Passions, refuse Assistances in Things unjust, en∣deavour to engage Heaven in our Cause, when just, and never let us alone till we apply also to the Almighty Power, and make Him our common Friend: In a Word, Friendship is directed by Right Reason, and cannot consist without Chris∣tianity.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly, Self</HI> is a great Fop and agreat Slattern: <HI>Soul</HI> has given her very good Cloaths, fine Ornaments, plain and neat, but <HI>Self</HI> either leaves them, like a Slut, in every Corner of the House; or
<PB N="70" REF="389"/>
when she puts them on, she does bedizen them with Lace and Embroidery, Frin∣ges and Ruffles, Patches, and Powder, that you can hardly see enough of the Garment to distinguish the excellent Stuff which it is made of: <HI>Soul</HI> has given her a fine Gown, called <HI>Good Humour,</HI> whose Outside was a celestial Blue, called <HI>Meekness,</HI> Lin'd with a white Persian, called <HI>Humility;</HI> what does <HI>Self,</HI> but throws off the Outside, saying it was foolish Stuff, and tramples the Lining under Foot, so that one could scarce know it: <HI>Soul</HI> had given her a Stomacher, call∣ed <HI>Sincerity,</HI> and charg'd her to wear it only on <HI>Sundays</HI> and Holy-Days, and never to put it on without serpentine Lace, called <HI>Discretion,</HI> with a Charge to let other People discover it, and not do as Court Ladies commonly do by their Cloaths, that is, shew them to all their Acquaintance as soon as they get them; but the giddy Thing wears it every Day, loses her Lace, and, as Children do, cries every Moment, who see my fine Stomacher; so that it must be a discerning Eye that knows it to be genuine: <HI>Soul</HI> gives her a fine Snuff-Box, in the Shape of a Heart, full of plain <HI>Spanish</HI> Snuff; <HI>Self</HI> throws it out, and fills it with Gunpowder and Hel∣lebore: <HI>Soul</HI> gives her a Censor full of
<PB N="71" REF="390"/>
Balm, called <HI>Gratitude,</HI> charging her to turn the Pipe of it upwards, and set it on Fire twice a Day, to make the Smoke of it rise up to Heaven; assuring her, that she would then find such a Fragrancy spread around, that would cure all Dis∣tempers of Mind, and ease all bodily Pain; but poor <HI>Self</HI> said there was too much Trouble in the Management of it; that she had forgot her Instructions, and the Book was too big that gave an Ac∣count of it; that there was indeed a Place where People met to use their Cen∣sors, but she had more Inclination to sleep, than manage her Censor, when she came there; and therefore thought it better to stay at Home: Since that, <HI>Self</HI> has never been rightly easy.</P>
<P>SOUL<HI>'s PICTURE in MINIATURE.</HI></P>
<P><HI>SOUL</HI> is honest, generous, grateful, unwilling to do, but unwilling to bear Wrong; sincere and open, but wants Help to distinguisn and correct the Faults of <HI>Self,</HI> and has not enough been used to reason and reflect, which makes us some∣times mistake Right for Wrong; but let him put on Passions and Consideration, and once rouse his good Qualities, and <HI>Self</HI> will be reformed and re-united; the
<PB N="72" REF="391"/>
Angels will resume their Charge; Hell will be baffled, Heaven will rejoice, and Earth will honour and admire: If <HI>Soul</HI> will learn to forgive, he will learn to be easy; and such is the Pleasure of the Victory over <HI>Self,</HI> in that Case, that it is worth all the Pains, and none know but those who have felt it: It is of the Nature of Gene∣rosity, but far superior; without Forgive∣ness here, there is no Forgiveness in Hea∣ven, with it there is endless Joy, and Hu∣mility is the Way to Exaltation here and hereafter: To become Good, consider how many you may see excel you in Good∣ness, on whom Heaven has not bestowed the Tenth Part of what you enjoy, to make yourself happy; nor can you mur∣mur, when you consider how many, far more deserving than yourself, in every Respect, are infinitely more miserable than ever you was in your Life. I don't doubt but the good Sense you are Mistress of, will make you know, when you read, and consider what I have said; and I hope you will believe I wish you as well, and am as much Your Friend, as any one living.</P>

<HEAD>A KEY To the FIRST VOLUME of Mr. POPE's Literary Correspondence.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1727 Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> purcha∣sed a Collection of Mr. <HI>Popes</HI>'s Let∣ters to <HI>Henry Cromwell,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> writ∣ten between the Years 1708, and 1711. These Letters Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> in his Re∣marks on the <HI>Dunciad</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BOOK II. Verse 66.</NOTE> says, were pro∣cured by one Mrs. <HI>Thomas,</HI> while he was almost a Boy, which the Author was ashamed of as very trivial Things; full not only of Levities, but of wrong Judg∣ments of Men and Books, and only excu∣sable from the Youth and Inexperience of the Writer.</P>
<P>We desire the Reader to observe, That Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> being born on the 8th of <HI>June</HI> 1688, and the last of his Letters to Mr. <HI>Cromwell,</HI> bearing Date <HI>December</HI> 21 1711, proves Him to have been in the 23d Year of his Age. How inexperi∣enced a Writer he was at that Time, we
<PB N="74" REF="393"/>
shall not determine, but in the Year 1728 Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> himself published some Letters, which he wrote to Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> before he was 17 Years of Age: So that his Ex∣perience, like a Crab, goes backwards: Monstrous Absurdity!</P>
<P>The Letters between Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> open our Literary Corre∣spondence, about which there has been such an <HI>Eclat.</HI> There is little more to be seen in these Letters, but that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> rubs the old Bard's Back, and he in return chucks our young Poetical Saplin under the Chin.</P>
