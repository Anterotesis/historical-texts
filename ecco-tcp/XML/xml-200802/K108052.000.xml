<HEAD>AN ANSWER To Some OBJECTIONS OF A <HI>Moderate ENQUIRER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Robert Snow,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE received a Paper subscribed by thee, and directed to the Church or People of God called <HI>Quakers,</HI> &amp;c. Which Paper contains some <HI>Objections,</HI> which (thou sayst) thou hast heard spoken against us, and wherein thou desirest to be sa∣tisfied. To which we say, It is no strange Thing to us to be spoken against by the World's Teachers, that being no more than befel the People of God, in the First breaking forth of Christianity in the World, Of whom it was said, <HI>Acts</HI> 28. 22. <HI>As concerning this Sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</HI> But we are willing to endeavour thy Satisfaction, by Answering the <HI>Objections.</HI></P>
<P>The First is, <HI>You own no Day, either the First or Last, as a Sabbath to the Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer:</HI> The Sabbath (which was the seventh or last Day of the Week) was given to the <HI>Jews, Ex.</HI> 16. 29. <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 4. Not to the <HI>Gentiles, Psal.</HI> 147. 19, 20. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 19. and was to last (as other typical Or∣dinances
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
were) <HI>untill the time of Reformation, Heb.</HI> 9. 10. <HI>till the Seed should come, Gal.</HI> 3. 19. <HI>which was Christ. ver.</HI> 16. <HI>the Lord of the Sabbath, Mat.</HI> 12. 8. <HI>who, in the Fulness of time, did blot out the Hand-writing of Ordi∣nances,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and took it out the Way, nailing it to his Cross, Col.</HI> 2. 14. From whence the Apostle thus in∣fers, <HI>Let no man therefore judge you</HI> (the Saints and faithful Brethren, <HI>Col.</HI> 1. 2.) <HI>in Meat or in Drink, or in respect of an Holy Day, or of the New Moon or of the Sabbath Days, Col.</HI> 2. 16. which, says he, <HI>are a Shadow of things to come, but the Body is of Christ. ver.</HI> 17. Thus was that <HI>Sabbath,</HI> which was given by God, to his People the <HI>Jews,</HI> ended and taken away by Christ, before the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were called to be his People. And as for the <HI>First Day</HI> of the Week, we do not read in the Holy Scriptures, that it is called the <HI>Sabbath-Day,</HI> or commanded to be kept and observed for a <HI>Sabbath,</HI> as the <HI>Seventh Day</HI> had been. But, on the contrary, we find the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> writing to the <HI>Romans,</HI> who were <HI>Gentiles</HI> (though not without some mixture of believing <HI>Jews</HI> amongst them, as appears, <HI>Acts</HI> 18. 2.) says, <HI>One Man esteems one Day above an∣other</HI> (there was the believing <HI>Jew</HI>) <HI>Another esteem∣eth every Day alike</HI> (there was the believing <HI>Gentile.</HI>) Well, what then! Doth he commend the Former of these, and condemn the Latter? No but he says, <HI>Let every Man be fully perswaded in his own Mind,</HI> Rom. 14. 5. And in the 4<HI>th.</HI> 10<HI>th.</HI> and 13<HI>th.</HI> verses disswades them from judging one another about the Observing, or not observing a Day, as well as about the Eating, or not eating of Meats; and seems to lay no more Stress upon the one, than the other. And if the Drift of the Apostle's discourse there be heedfully minded, it will appear that, as he sets him who believed he might eat all Things, with him that esteemed every Day a like; and him that esteemed one Day above another, with him that eat Herbs: So he imputes the Weakness to the Latter, <HI>ver.</HI> 2. and sets himself on
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
the other side, saying, <HI>We then that are strong ought to bear the Infirmities of the Weak,</HI> Chap. 15. 1. And he tells the <HI>Galatians</HI> (which though a <HI>Gentile Chureh,</HI> had also <HI>Jewish</HI> Believers in it) <HI>I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you Labour in vain,</HI> Gal. 4. 11. Why so? <HI>Ye observe Days and Months, and Times, and Years,</HI> says he, <HI>ver.</HI> 10. So jealous was the Apostle, lest any that had been gathered from outward Obser∣vations, and from a shadowy State, should imbon∣dage themselves again in Shadows, and fall short of injoying the Substance, which is the true Gospel <HI>Rest that remains to the People of God,</HI> Heb. 4. 9. Which in the next verse is described to be, Their <HI>Ceasing</HI> from their <HI>own Works, as God did from his. Into which Rest we</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>that have helieved, do en∣ter, ver.</HI> 3. and in the 11. verse he presses others to labour to enter into that Rest. Now when the Apostle says, There Remains a Rest, it plainly implies that the former Rest, the outward Sabbatical Rest, did not remain, but was passed away and gone. Nor is it reasonable to suppose, that the Rest here men∣tioned, which is said to Remain to the People of God, was an outward Bodily Resting from outward Bodily Labour, on what soever Day; both, as that would be but to change one Type or Figure for an∣other, and, as the entring into this Rest is set forth in the Text, as a Matter of Labour and Difficulty, <HI>ver.</HI> 11. as it is indeed, yet blessed be the Lord, he hath enabled some, that have believed in his Name, and subjected to his Power, to enter into this Rest, in this his Day; and many are pressing after it, as the true, abiding Gospel-Rest, which the Legal Sab∣bath was but a Type or Shadow of.</P>
<P>The 2. OBJECTION is, <HI>You deny the Scriptures to be any Rule for Man or Woman to walk by, so as to di∣rect them to the saving of their Souls.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer,</HI> In this we are misrepre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ented. We sin∣cerely own, love and regard the Holy Scriptures, be∣lieving
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
with the Apostle, that <HI>they were given by In∣spiration of God, and are profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteous∣ness, that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good Works,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 16, 17. and that <HI>they are able to make wise unto Salvation, through Faith that is in Christ Jesus, ver.</HI> 15. And great be∣nefit and delight we sind in them, reading them in the openings of that Divine Spirit, by which they were given forth. We are so far from denying them to be <HI REND="blackletterType">any</HI> Rule, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that we acknowledge them to contain <HI REND="blackletterType">many</HI> excellent Rules, Precepts, Doctrines and Instructions, directing Man and Woman how to walk, that they may obtain the Salvation of their Souls. Yet we do not say (as some have done) that the Scriptures are the <HI>only</HI> Rule, or the <HI>chief</HI> and <HI>principal</HI> Rule: because we dare not give the Hon∣our and Office of the Holy Spirit unto the Scriptures; For the Scriptures themselves declare, That <HI>it is the Office of the Holy Spirit to guide Believers into all Truth, John.</HI> 16. 13. And indeed, the true Meaning and Benefit of the Scriptures themselves is not at∣tained to in the Reading of them, unless the Spirit that gave them forth do open them, and unseal the Mysteries contained in them. So that the Holy Spi∣rit is greater than the Scriptures, and therefore we cannot but give the chief Place unto him. For he is able to manifest himself unto Man, and to lead man into the Way of Salvation, either with and by the Scriptures, or without them, as he pleases: But the Scriptures cannot do that without the Operation of the Holy Spirit. Justly therefore do we affirm the Spirit of God, to be the <HI>Chief</HI> Rule, and yet acknow∣ledge the Holy Scriptures to be a true Rule, and pro∣per Instrument in the Hand of the Spirit, to direct Men and Women how they ought to walk, to obtain Salvation to their Souls, as the Spirit of the Lord makes use of the Scriptures to that End.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6"/>The 3d OBJECTION is, <HI>You deny the Resurrection of this mortal Body, that this Mortal shall not put on Immortality.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer,</HI> In this also we are misrepresented: We do not deny, but own the Resurrection of the Dead; Believing, with the Apostle, that <HI>This Corruptible shall put on Incorruption, and this Mortal shall put on Immortality,</HI> 1 Cor. 15. 54. And indeed, if we did not believe this, we might well say (as he did) <HI>If in this Life only we have Hope in Christ, we were of all Men most miserable,</HI> ver. 19. <HI>And, Why stand we in jeopar∣dy every Hour,</HI> ver. 30. But the Lord knows, and we have openly and sincerely declared, that we believe and own the Resurrection of the Dead, according as the Holy Scriptures testify concerning it; Which say, <HI>Thou sowest not that Body that shall be, but bare Grain</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But God giveth it a Body as it hath pleased him, and to every Seed his own Body,</HI> ver. 37, 38. <HI>It is sown a natural Body; it is raised a Spiritual Body,</HI> ver. 44. the reason of which follows <HI>ver.</HI> 50. namely, <HI>That Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, neither doth Corruption inherit Incorruption.</HI> And as we firmly believe this; So we take this to be sufficient, without being so curiously inquisitive as he, who would needs ask, <HI>How are the Dead raised up? and with what Body do they come?</HI> ver. 35. and was called <HI>Fool</HI> for his Pains, <HI>ver.</HI> 36.</P>
<P>The 4th OBJECTION is, <HI>You suffer Women to be your Teachers, that were forbid by the Apostle, for he says, that they should keep silence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer,</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> of old had a strong Persuasion (grounded upon some misunderstood Places of Scrip∣ture) that the Salvation of God was confined to them, and belonged not at all to the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> And this Opinion had prevailed so far upon them, that even those of them that received the Gospel could not easily shake it off. In so much that, after <HI>Peter</HI> had been with <HI>Cornelius</HI> the <HI>Centurion,</HI> and was come
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
back again to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> he was called before the Church for it, <HI>they that were of the Circumcision con∣tending with him,</HI> and <HI>saying, Thou went'st in to Men uncircumcised, and did'st eat with them,</HI> Act. 11. 2, 3. To whom, having related the Occasion and Particulars of that Matter, he concludes his Defence thus, <HI>For as much then as God gave them the like Gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Je∣sus Christ, what was I, that I could withstand God?</HI> ver. 17. And in the next verse it follows, <HI>when they heard these Things they held their Peace, and glo∣risied God,</HI> &amp;c. This Answer, which the Apostle gave in that Case, may be suitable (we think) for us to give in this Case, to such as (from some misunder∣stood Places of Scripture) are offended at us for Suf∣fering Women to speak in our Assemblies, <HI>viz.</HI> For as much as God hath given them the like Gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, what are we that we should withstand God? God, by his Servant <HI>Joel,</HI> in the Time of the Law, had made this Promise, with Relation to the Times of the Gospel, <HI>viz. And it shall come to pass afterwards (or in the last Days, as</HI> Peter <HI>repeats it,</HI> Act. 2. 17.) <HI>that I will pour out my Spirit upon all Flesh, and your Sons and your Daughters shall prophecy, your old Men shall dream Dreams, your young Men shall see Visions: And also upon the Servants and upon the Handmaids in these Days will I pour out my Spirit,</HI> Joel 2. 28, 29. (And they shall prophecy, adds <HI>Peter,</HI> Act. 2. 18.) Here was no Distinction of Sex made; But this Promise of <HI>pouring out the Spirit,</HI> and of <HI>prophesying</HI> thereby, is extended as expresly and fully to the Daughters as to the Sons, to the Handmaids as to the Servants. And this the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> doth expresly apply to that great <HI>pouring forth of the Spirit upon the Church,</HI> at the Pentecost immediately after Christ's Ascen∣sion, saying, <HI>This is that which was spoken by the Pro∣phet Joel,</HI> Acts 2. 16. Now at that great and emi∣nent
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
pouring forth of the Spirit it appears the Wo∣men were not excluded: For when, after the Ascen∣tion, the Apostles and Disciples were returned from Mount <HI>Olivet</HI> to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> it is said, <HI>These all con∣tinued with one Accord in Prayer and Supplication with the Women, and Mary the Mother of Jesus,</HI> &amp;c. Acts 1. 14. The Number of the Names together being a∣bout an hundred and twenty, ver. 15. <HI>And when the Day of Pentecost was fully come, they were <HI REND="blackletterType">all</HI> with one Accord in one Place,</HI> Chap. 2. 1. and in vers. 3. it is said, the cloven <HI>Tongues sate upon <HI REND="blackletterType">each</HI> of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance,</HI> ver. 4. Here was no Distinction made; no shutting out the Women; but all were together, all received the Gift of the Spirit, and began to <HI>Speake with other Tongues as the Spirit gave them ut∣terance.</HI> Nor was it thus only at that time, and up∣on that extraordinary Occasion, but continued in the Church afterwards. For we read <HI>that Philip the Evangelist had four Daughters that did Prophesy;</HI> Acts 21. 8, 9. <HI>Phebe,</HI> a Woman, is recommended by the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> to the Church at <HI>Rome,</HI> not only as a <HI>Sister,</HI> but as a <HI>Servant of the Church,</HI> Rom. 16. 1. <HI>Priscilla,</HI> a Woman, is called by the same Apostle, <HI>My Helper</HI> (or Fellow Labourer) <HI>in Christ Jesus,</HI> ver. 3. <HI>Tryphena</HI> and <HI>Tryphosa,</HI> two godly Women, are saluted by him as <HI>Labourers in the Lord;</HI> And of the beloved <HI>Persis,</HI> another Holy Woman, he testi∣fies, that <HI>she laboured much in the Lord,</HI> ver. 12. The same Apostle, in his Epistle to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> says, <HI>I intreat thee also, true Yoke Fellow, help those Women which laboured with me in the Gospel,</HI> Phil. 4. 3. Which is the Phrase by which the Apostle doth frequently express his own Ministry, And which he particu∣larly applies to <HI>Timotheus,</HI> whom he calls <HI>Our Bro∣ther and Minister of God, and our Fellow Labourer in the Gospel of Christ,</HI> 1 Thes. 3. 2. Which is a clear Evi∣dence
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
that those Women, that had received the Gift of Prophesy, did minister therein to the Edification of the Church, as well as the Men. Nay the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> in that very Epistle, wherein he is thought by some to discountenance <HI>Womens Preaching,</HI> doth give Directions for the Manner of their <HI>Preaching</HI> or <HI>Pro∣phesying,</HI> viz. <HI>That they should do it with their Heads covered.</HI> For having first said, <HI>Every Man praying or prophesying, having his Head covered, dishonoureth his Head,</HI> 1 Cor. 11. 4. He adds, <HI>But every Woman that Prayeth or Prophesyeth with her Head uncovered dis∣honoured her Head,</HI> ver. 5. This puts it out of doubt, that Womens <HI>Praying</HI> and <HI>Prophesying</HI> in the Church, was at that Time both lawful and usual, as well as Mens.</P>
<P>Now, that by <HI>Prophesying</HI> here is meant <HI>Preaching</HI> (not barely foretelling Things to come) may not only be inferred from the use of the same Word in the verse foregoing, where, being spoken of Men, it is granted on all Hands to intend <HI>Preaching</HI> (and from thence the general practice of <HI>Mens Preaching uncovered</HI> is defended) but may also fairly be con∣cluded, from the explanation the Apostle gives of it, in Chap. 14. ver. 31. where he tells that Church in general, <HI>We may all Prophesy one by one that</HI> all <HI>may</HI> learn; Which manifests that by <HI>Prophesying</HI> he in∣tended <HI>Preaching</HI> or <HI>Teaching,</HI> that being the proper way or means of <HI>Learning.</HI> And in the Beginning of that Chapter, where he prefers <HI>Prophesying</HI> before <HI>Speaking whith Tongues,</HI> ver. 1. and 5. he says, <HI>He that Prophesyeth, Speaketh unto Men, to Edification, and Exhortation, and Comfort,</HI> ver. 3. And, <HI>He that Pro∣phesyeth, Edifieth the Church,</HI> ver. 4. which plainly shew that by <HI>Prophesying</HI> he meant <HI>Preaching</HI> or <HI>Teaching,</HI> that being the proper means or way of E∣difying. And therefore, seeing he not only allowed Women to <HI>Prophecy,</HI> but directed and advised them how they should perform it <HI>Chap.</HI> 11. 5. and that in
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
this Place <HI>Prophesying</HI> and <HI>Preaching</HI> appear to be one and the same Thing, it is unreasonable to suppose he denied them the Liberty of <HI>Preaching,</HI> being gifted and called thereunto. As for those Words of his, 1 Cor. 14. 34. <HI>Let your Women keep silence in the Churches: sor it is not permitted unto them to speak; but to be under Obedience, as also saith the Law.</HI> Ob∣serve first, that those Words, [<HI>as also saith the Law</HI>] relate only to the Womens being under <HI>Obedience,</HI> not to their keeping <HI>silence</HI> in the Church: For that was never enjoyned them in the Law, but they were permitted to speak in the Congregation; And both <HI>Miriam,</HI> who was a Prophetess, did sing the Tri∣umphs of the Lord, in the publick Congregation, <HI>Ex.</HI> 15. 20. 21. And <HI>Deborah,</HI> who was a Prophetess, did recount the noble Acts of the Lord, and cele∣brate his Praises in a Triumphant Song, <HI>Judges</HI> 5. Read also what <HI>Hanna</HI> spake in the House of the Lord in <HI>Shiloh,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2. And <HI>Anna,</HI> who was a Pro∣phetess, did not only give thanks unto the Lord, but spake of Christ to all them that looked for Redem∣ption in <HI>Jerusalem, Luke</HI> 2. 38. This was direct <HI>Preaching,</HI> and that <HI>in the Temple.</HI> So that the Wo∣men were not enjoyned <HI>silence</HI> under the Law, but were permitted to <HI>Speak.</HI> In the next Place, con∣sider what Speaking it was that was forbidden by the Apostle in that Place, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 34. which from his following Words will appear to be, not a Speak∣ing of the Words of Life and Salvation, not a Speak∣ing as the Spirit of God gives utterance; but speak∣ing disorderly, asking Questions unseasonably, and out of place; not speaking for the Edification of Others, but speaking for their own Information on∣ly: for he immediately adds, <HI>If they will learn any Thing, let them ask their Husbands at home,</HI> ver. 35. These Words [<HI REND="blackletterType">learn</HI> and <HI REND="blackletterType">ask</HI>] plainly shew, that the Speaking here condemned was not a Speaking the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of the Gospel for the Edification of the
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
Church; but <HI>asking Questions</HI> for their own Satis∣faction, which they might have done at home, but not there: therefore he adds, <HI>For it is a Shame for Women to speak in the Church.</HI> And so indeed it was, in such a disorderly manner as they speake, to inter∣rogate or Catechise either the Minister, or their Husbands, openly in the Church; to ask the Meaning of this, or call for an Explanation of that, which might look like a throwing off their Obedience to their Husband, and must needs Occasion Disorders and Confusion in the Assembly; which we may per∣ceive was the Thing that troubled the Apostle, and which he laboured to reform: for he said before, <HI>God is not the Author of Confusion, but of Peace,</HI> ver. 33. and he concludes the Chapter with this Admonition, <HI>Let all Things be done decently and in Order:</HI> So that it was the disorderly Practice of some Women in that Church which he reproves, who, it seems, when any Thing was spoken which they did not understand, would interpose, and <HI>ask Questions</HI> for information Sake, which was uncomely in them, offensive and troublesome to the Congregation. This sort of <HI>Speak∣ing</HI> was not permitted them, but was a Shame to them, and from which they ought to have kept silence <HI>in the Church.</HI> And <HI>if they will learn any Thing,</HI> says he, <HI>let them ask their Husbands at home.</HI> Of like import are those other Words, of the same Apostle to <HI>Timo∣thy,</HI> and probably on the same Occasion. <HI>Let the Wo∣man,</HI> says he, <HI>learn in silence with all Subjection. But I suffer not a Woman to teach, nor to usurp Authority over the Man, but to be in silence,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 11, 12. For hence it appears still, that the Occasion they took of speaking, was under pretence of <HI REND="blackletterType">learning,</HI> wherein they took an undue Liberty to <HI>ask Questions,</HI> as if they would catechise or teach their Husbands. But though the Apostle would not suffer such sort of Speaking in the Church, as might give Occasion to any to think that the Women did cast off the Obe∣dience
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
they owed, and did usurp Authority over their Husbands; nor after such a manner, as might breed Confusion in the Congregation (for he was so watchful against that, that he enjoyns the Man to be silent in that Case, as well as the Woman. <HI>If any Man,</HI> says he, <HI>speak in an unknown Tongue,—let one interpret. But if there be no Interpreter, let him keep silence in the Church;</HI> 1 Cor. 14. 27, 28. Yet we have before shewed, that he allowed of <HI>Women prophesy∣ing,</HI> and that by <HI>Prophesying,</HI> he meant <HI>Preaching.</HI> We have also given many Instances of Women that laboured in the Work of the Gospel in that Day; and could, from a living and sure experience, multi∣ply Instances of many Women in this Day, whom the Lord hath committed the Word of Life and Re∣conciliation unto, and who, in the quickning Power and Vertue thereof, have sounded forth the same, to the awakening of many that were a sleep in Sin, and turning of many <HI>from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God,</HI> who are now become living Seals of their Ministry. Neither would this seem so strange as it doth to some, did they duly consider, That <HI>God is no Respecter of Persons.</HI> But that, as, in the <HI>old Creation,</HI> Male and Female were Created in the Image of God: So, in the <HI>new Creation,</HI> Male and Female are all one in Christ Jesus, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 28. But, as they that contended with <HI>Peter,</HI> for conversing with the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> when they had heard his Defence, held their Peace, and glorified God, saying, <HI>Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted Repentance unto Life, Acts</HI> 11. 18. So, we hope they that have taken Offence at us, for suffering Women to <HI>speak</HI> in the Church, when they shall have duly and impartially weighed, what is herein offered for their Satisfaction, will hold their Peace (as to any Opposition thereunto) and glorify God, saying, <HI>Then hath God committed unto Women also the Word of Reconciliation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13"/>The fifth Objection is, <HI>You are a People that have gained Health to your Immortal Souls, and are sure of Heaven, when the Scriptures say, that</HI> the Righteous Man falls seven times a Day; <HI>and the Apostle</HI> Paul <HI>said that</HI> Sin was still actually in him.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> We do not desire to boast of any Attain∣ments. Yet we cannot but confess, to the Glory of God, and the Praise of his Holy Name, that His saving Health hath appeared in this his Day, and we (through his Mercy) have tasted of it. Christ, the Saviour, is manifested in Spirit, and we (through Grace) have felt the healing Virtue of his Divine Life and Power. Through the tender Mercy of our God, the Day-spring from on high hath visited us, and hath given Light to us that sate in Darkness and in the Shadow of Death, and hath guided our Feet into the way of Peace, and hath helped us to make our Calling and Election sure. As for the Scripture thou mentionest, we do not find that the Scripture saith, <HI>The Righteous Man falls seven times a Day;</HI> but in <HI>Prov.</HI> 24. 16. we find it thus written, <HI>For a Just Man falleth seven times, and riseth up a∣gain; but the Wicked shall fall into Mischief.</HI> And as the Verse before shews the Occasion of these Words, where it is said, <HI>Lay not wait, O wicked Man, against the Dwelling of the Righteous: spoil not his resting place.</HI> So the latter Part of this 16th Verse [<HI>but the wicked shall fall into Mischief</HI>] implies, that the just Man doth not fall, as the wicked Man does, <HI>into Mischief.</HI> And seeing all Sin is Mischief, it seems as if the Fall here spoken of the just Man, were not a <HI>falling into Sin,</HI> but into some outward Calamity or Exercise. However the Place speaks nothing of <HI>daily</HI> or <HI>continual falling.</HI> Nor do we remember that <HI>Paul</HI> doth use that very Expression concerning him∣self, <HI>viz. That Sin was still actually in him;</HI> though we know that he doth, in divers places, run through, as it were, and open the various States and Travels
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
of the Soul; in some of which he cried out, <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver,</HI> &amp;c! But he rested not there, but quickly breaks forth into a Rejoycing, and cries out, <HI>I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord,</HI> Rom. 7. 24, 25. And then in the next Chapter, having said, <HI>There is no Condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit,</HI> he says expresly con∣cerning himself. <HI>For the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death,</HI> ver. 2. And again, <HI>Thanks be to God, which giveth us the Victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> 1 Cor. 15. 57. This <HI>Victory</HI> we press after; this <HI>Freedom from the Law of Sin and Death,</HI> we la∣bour and travel to attain unto, by a Subjection through Divine Assistance) to the <HI>Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>The 6th Objection is, <HI>Why your Teachers perswade you, that all other People are in a barren and desolate Condition, and are out of Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> Our Teachers do not perswade us so; nor do we Judge so of all other People: For we our selves were gathered out of various Professions, States and Conditions; and some of us, who had been seeking after the Lord in other Professions, can remember, that before we were thus gathered to this divine Principle of <HI>Light,</HI> which the Lord hath set up, in this his Day, as an Ensign for the Na∣tions to be gathered unto, and to walk in: we were not wholly barren and desolate; but had, at Seasons, some touches and tasts of the Vertue of that hidden Life, which we were then Strangers to; the Lord having regard to the Sincerity of our Hearts, and answering, in some measure, the Breathings of our Souls to him; so far, at least, as to cherish and keep alive those good Desires which were begotten in us, and to beget in us a greater Hunger and Thirst after him. And it is not hard to us to believe, that

so it may be with others at this Day, who have an Integrity to the Lord, though not acquainted with his Outgoings, and Manifestations of himself in this Dispensation of <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Life:</HI> And both our Prayers to God the Father, in and through his Son Jesus Christ, and our Labour and Endeavours, in the Openings of his Love and Life in our Hearts, are, that all these, in whatsoever Profession, may be drawn off from all the dry Hills and barren Mountains, and gathered into the true Sheepfold. For we remember our Saviour said, <HI>Other Sheep I have, which are not of this Fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my Voice; and there shall be one Fold, and one Shepherd,</HI> Joh. 10. 16. The Lord grant, that none of these may mistake his Voice, or disobey it.</P>
<P>The last Objection is, <HI>You deny all outward Ordi∣nances, as</HI> Baptism, <HI>and the</HI> Six Principles, <HI>that were taught to the first primitive Christians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> The Dispensation of the Law was <HI>out∣ward,</HI> and the Ordinances appertaining to that Dis∣pensation were <HI>outward</HI> also: But the Dispensation of the Gospel is spiritual and <HI>inward,</HI> and the Or∣dinances appertaining to this Dispensation are of a spiritual Nature. The <HI>Baptism with Water</HI> was <HI>John</HI>'s, and came up under the Dispensation of the Law, nor did properly belong to the Gospel Dis∣pensation, though for a time, by Condescention, continued, as Circumcision, and some other Legal Rites, were. And this was that Baptism which <HI>Paul</HI> says Christ sent him not to baptize with, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 17. But the <HI>Baptism of Christ,</HI> the true Gospel-Baptism, that by which the true Believer is bap∣tised into Jesus Christ, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. 3. and buried with him into Death, ver. 4. <HI>The one Baptism,</HI> Eph. 4. 5. <HI>is the Baptism with the Holy Ghost and with Fire,</HI> and is plainly distinguished from the Baptism with Wa∣ter, both by <HI>John,</HI> to whom the Water-Baptism
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
belonged, and by Christ, to whom the Spirit-Bap∣tism belonged. For <HI>John</HI> said, <HI>I indeed baptize you with Water unto Repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose Shoos I am not worthy to bear: He shall Baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with Fire,</HI> Mat. 3. 11. And Christ, as <HI>Luke</HI> records a little before his Ascention, said, <HI>John truly bap∣tized with Water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence,</HI> Acts 1. 5. which was the Promise of the Father, <HI>ver.</HI> 4. delivered by Christ to his Apostles and Disciples, just before his parting from them, <HI>Luke</HI> 24. 49. Let it therefore be fairly considered, 1. That the Dispensation of the Gospel is <HI>Spiritual,</HI> and therefore the Ordinances belonging to it should be so too. 2 That in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 19. (From which place the Commission for Water-Baptism is usually fetched) there is no mention of Water. 3. That Baptism with Water is no where in Scripture called Christ's Baptism. 4. That Bap∣tism with Water is frequently called <HI>John's Baptism.</HI> 5. That the Baptism with the Holy Ghost is called <HI>Christ's Baptism.</HI> 6. That the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> acknow∣ledges but <HI>One Baptism,</HI> Eph. 4. 5. which cannot be supposed to be that with <HI>Water,</HI> since then he must exclude the Baptism of the <HI>Spirit.</HI> 7. That the A∣postle <HI>Peter,</HI> speaking of the Baptism that saves, says expresly, <HI>It is not the putting away the Filth of the Flesh,</HI> 1 Pet. 3. 21. (which it is the Property of Water to do) as if he had said, <HI>The Baptism which now saves us is not Water-Baptism.</HI> 8. That Bap∣tism with Water is no where expresly commanded in Scripture, as it would doubtless have been, had it been intended by Christ for a Gospel Ordinance. 9. That tho' it was sometimes used after Christ's Ascention, yet that cannot authorize the use of it now, any more than of Circumcision, and other Legal Ordinances, which, in Condescention to the Weakness of Believers in that Day, were also used
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
after Christ's Ascention, yet are confest by all not to be in force now. For <HI>John,</HI> as himself said, was to <HI>decrease,</HI> Joh. 3. 30. which related to his Ministry or Dispensation, not to his Person. Now a <HI REND="blackletterType">De∣creasing</HI> implies a growing less, or wearing away by degrees, not all on a suddain; or at once; and therefore no wonder, if his Water-Baptism was continued for a time, even after Christ's Baptism of the Holy Spirit took place. But as Christ's Baptism was to <HI>increase,</HI> so <HI>John</HI>'s was to <HI>decrease,</HI> till Christ's came to be <HI>all in all,</HI> and <HI>John</HI>'s Water Bap∣tism wholly to give place. Let these things, we say, be duly weighed, and we hope we shall not be blamed, for leaving the Baptism of <HI>John,</HI> and cleaving to the Baptism of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Six Principles</HI> thou mentionest, seeing thou hast not declared what they are, it cannot be expected we should speak to them at this time. But we recommend to thee that holy divine Principle of <HI REND="blackletterType">Light</HI> wherewith Christ <HI>lighteth every Man that cometh into the World,</HI> Joh. 1. 9. <HI>In which Light the Nations of them that are saved shall walk,</HI> Rev. 21. 24. And we heartily desire thou mayst walk therein.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF TYTHES in General.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>THE only Command from God, that we read of in Holy Scripture, for the Payment of Tythes, was given by <HI>Moses,</HI> to the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> in the time of the <HI>Levitical Law.</HI> Then God first reserved to himself the Tythe of the Land of Ca∣naan, <HI>Lev.</HI> 27. 30. Which he did for this reason, that, intending to take the Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> more peculiarly into his Service (as he did, <HI>Numb.</HI> 3. 6. in stead of, or in exchange for all the First born of <HI>Israel,</HI> ver. 12. 13. and 45. and Chap. 8. ver. 18. Having before re∣served and appropriated the First born to himself, <HI>Ex.</HI> 13. 2.) he might bestow those Tythes on the <HI>Levites,</HI> for and towards the Maintenance of that whole Tribe, as a Reward for their Service in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, <HI>Numb.</HI> 18. 21. 31. and in lieu of, and Compensation for, their Part or Share of and in the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> which thereupon they were expresly cut off from, ver. 20, 23, 24.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now although it was grounded on a Principle of Moral Justice and Equity, that the <HI>Levites,</HI> thus engaged in a continual Attendance on a publick Ser∣vice, and shut out from their Share in the Inheritance of the promised Land should receive a sufficient
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
Maintenance from them, for whom they performed that Service, and who enjoyed their Part of the Land: Yet the ascertaining of the <HI>Quot a</HI> of that Maintenance to the exact proportion of a <HI>Tenth Part</HI> of the Increase of the Land, was not grounded on Moral Justice, but had its dependence on the Ceremonial Law, adapted and limited to the Polity of that Dispensation and People only. And that it might not be extended be∣yond its appointed Time and Bounds, it pleased the Di∣vine Wisdom, to subject it to such Ceremonial Cir∣cumstances, as plainly rank it amongst those carnal Ordinances (Rites or Ceremonies) which were impos∣ed, but <HI>till the Time of Reformation,</HI> Spoken of <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 10. For as God appointed the <HI>Levites</HI> to be offered for a <HI>Wave-Offering,</HI> by <HI>Moses,</HI> in the Name and on the behalf of the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> when he said to <HI>Moses, Thou shalt bring the Levites to the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and thou shalt gather the whole Assembly of the Children of Israel together; And thou shalt bring the Levites before the Lord, and the Children of Israel shall put their Hands upon the Levites: And Aaron shall offer</HI> (in the Margin <HI>Wave) the Levites before the Lord, for an Offering</HI> (in the Margin, <HI>Wave-Offering) of the Children of Israel; that they may execute the Service of the Lord,</HI> Num. 8. 9, 10, 11. So the Tythes, which were assigned for the Maintenance of the <HI>Le∣vites,</HI> were to be first offered, by the People, as an <HI>Heave-Offering</HI> unto the Lord. (<HI>The Tythes of the Chil∣dren of Israel, which they offer as an Heave-Offering unto the Lord, I have given to the Levites,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Numb.</HI> 18. 24.) And even the Tythes of those Tythes, which the <HI>Levites</HI> were to yield unto the <HI>Priests,</HI> were to be offered, by the <HI>Levites,</HI> as an <HI>Heave-Offering</HI> to the Lord, before the <HI>Priests</HI> might have them. <HI>Thus speak unto the Levites</HI> (said God to Moses) <HI>and say unto them, When ye take of the Children of Israel the Tythe which I have given you from them for your Inheritance; Then ye shall offer up an Heave-Offering of it for the Lord, even</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
<HI>a tenth Part of the Tythe. And this your Heave-Offer∣ing shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the Corn of the threshing Floor,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Thus ye also shall offer an Heave-Offering unto the Lord, of all your Tythes, which ye receive of the Children of Israel: And ye shall give there of the Lord's Heave-Offering to Aaron the Priest,</HI> ver. 26, 27, 28. This makes it evident, beyond doubt∣ing, that the Tythes, which were given by the People to the <HI>Levites,</HI> and by the <HI>Levites</HI> to the <HI>Priests,</HI> un∣der the Law, had their Dependence on the Ceremo∣nial Law, as that Priesthood had; And were to stand no longer than that Law and that Priesthood stood: Which was but till <HI>Shiloh</HI> came, and by the Offering of himself once for all, had put an end to all the sha∣dowy Offerings under that Law.</P>
<P N="3">3. This the Author of the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> did so well understand, that he positively declared, that <HI>the Levitical Priesthood being changed, there was made of Necessity a Change also of the Law,</HI> (of that Law, by which that Priesthood and the Maintenance of it had stood) See <HI>Heb.</HI> 7. 12. And 'tis also evident from Scripture and Primitive Antiquity that neither the Apostles themselves, nor (for some ages after them) any of the Christians, did meddle with, or at all con∣cern themselves about Tythes; But let them totally fall as they did the other abrogated Part, <HI>viz.</HI> Offer∣ings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and of the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Moses.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. But after that the Mystery of Iniquity, which in the Apostles time began to work (2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2. 7.) had wrought to that Degree amongst some Christians, and had drawn them so far from the Purity and Sim∣plicity of the Gospel, as to form and model the Church in many things, by and according to the <HI>Jewish</HI> Pat∣tern amongst other Ceremonial Parts of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Religion, which had been abolished by the Coming and Death of Christ. Tythes were preached up again (about the latter end of the fourth Century, and be∣ginning of the fifth) by some, at first, under the No∣tion
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
of Alms and Charity (because part of the Tythes under the Levitical Law, were appointed for the Maintenance of the Fatherless, the Widow and the Stranger, <HI>Deut.</HI> 14. 28, 29.) And by others, as then still due by the Mosaic Law, which had required them to be paid to the Levitical Priesthood. Which Plea afterwards (Corruptions increasing in the Church, and in those especially who were called the <HI>Church-Men,</HI> or <HI>Clergy</HI>) more and more prevailing, the Payment of Tythes was re-introduced, as due by those Levitical Laws, which had been given to the <HI>Israelites</HI> of old. And upon that Bottom, Tythes have stood, been claimed and the Claim defended unto this Day.</P>
<P N="5">5. Now, not only he that thus claims, and receives Tythes; but he that consents to, and complies with such Claim, by paying Tythes thus brought in, and thus claimed, doth thereby implicitly, and vertu∣ally (at least) deny that Christ has put an End to the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> and consequently that he is come, and hath suffered in his Flesh for Mankind. And that this may appear as plain as is possible, I shall draw the Matter into an Argument, thus: <LIST>
<ITEM>To uphold any Thing, as still in force, which was to be taken away, and cease at and by the Death of Christ, is to deny that Christ is come and hath suffered in his Flesh for Mankind.</ITEM>
<ITEM>But to receive, or pay Tythes now, is to uphold a Thing, as still in force, which was to be taken away, and cease at and by the Death of Christ:</ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore to receive, or pay Tythes now, is to deny that Christ is come, and hath suffered in his Flesh for Mankind.</ITEM>
</LIST> The <HI>Major</HI> must be granted, and the <HI>Minor</HI> I thus prove.<LIST>
<ITEM>Whatsoever was <HI>a part</HI> of the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> was to be taken away, and cease at and by the Death of Christ;</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="21" REF="22"/>
But Tythes were a part of the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Moses;</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore Tythes were to be taken away, and cease at and by the Death of Christ:</ITEM>
</LIST> The <HI>Major</HI> here again is unexceptionable; And the <HI>Minor</HI> is thus proved.<LIST>
<ITEM>Every <HI>Heave-Offering</HI> among the <HI>Jews</HI> was <HI>a Part</HI> of the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Moses;</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>But Tythes were an <HI>Heave-Offering</HI> among the <HI>Jews,</HI> Num. 18. 24.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore Tythes were <HI>a Part</HI> of the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Moses.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="6">6. By this it appears, that without regard had of the Person to whom, or the Use for which Tythes are paid, the paying of Tythes (as well as the re∣ceiving them) being <HI>a Part</HI> of the abrogated Ceremo∣nial Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> imports a denyal of the Coming, and Death of <HI>Christ.</HI> Hence it is, that Tythes have been, and are commonly called <HI>Antichristian,</HI> or <HI>a∣gainst Christ.</HI> And hence hath risen that saying (often used not only by our antient Friends, but by some of the Martyrs long before) <HI>viz. He that pays Tythes, doth thereby deny that Christ is come in the Flesh.</HI> That Conclusion could not have been drawn, from the pay∣ing of Tythes to a wrong Ministry, or for a wrong use only, though such Payment be evil: Nor could any thing justify that Inference, but the Considera∣tion that Tythes, depending on the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> which must of Necessity and in course fall, and cease when Christ suffered; the paying of Tythes carries in it a supposal, that that Law is not yet cea∣sed, but is still in force: and consequently that Christ, whose Death must needs have ended it, is not yet come, nor has yet suffered in his Flesh for Mankind.</P>
<P N="7">7. That other Objection, not less weighty than common against paying Tythes to the <HI>Clergy,</HI> so call∣ed, <HI>viz.</HI> The unlawfulness of upholding a false Mi∣nistry, to perform a false Worship (being it self so
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
clear and plain, that it needs no illustration) I shall, in this Discourse, no further meddle with, than to observe in my way, how far it may affect those Ty∣thes also, which the <HI>Impropriators</HI> claim. Wherefore having premised what is said before concerning Tythes in general, to what Hand, or for what Use so∣ever paid, let us now inquire into those Tythes, which are called <HI>Impropriate.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Impropriate <HI>TYTHES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT these Tythes, which are claimed by the <HI>Impropriators,</HI> are of the same Nature, and stand originally on the same Root and Ground, on which the other Tythes stand, which are claimed and exacted by the <HI>Priests,</HI> is evident from hence, that they were all heretofore, these as well as those, claim∣ed by, and paid to some or other of the <HI>Romish Clergy,</HI> or their Appendices, the Religious Orders (so called) and upon the same Foot. That is, These <HI>Impropriate Tythes</HI> were paid to those Religious Orders or Houses, as being due to God, by vertue, of the <HI>Levitic-Law;</HI> as well as the other Tythes were paid to the <HI>Parish-Priests,</HI> on the same supposed Right, from the same Law. But how these Ththes came to those Religious Houses first, and how afterwards from them to the <HI>Impropriators,</HI> is next to be inquired.</P>
<P>Until the <HI>Lateran Council</HI> (so named, because it was holden in the <HI>Pope's</HI> Palace at <HI>Rome,</HI> called the <HI>Lateran</HI>) in the Year 1215. It was in the choice of eve∣ry Man to give his Tythes to what Church he pleased, so he gave them to some Church. And even after that Council, the <HI>Popes,</HI> as Heads of that Church, by their dispencing Power, did give leave to such as would sue, and pay for it, to give their Tythes from the <HI>Parish-Priest,</HI> to such Order of Religious People (whe∣ther <HI>Monks, Friers,</HI> or <HI>Nuns</HI>) as they were best affected to. By which means, the <HI>Parish-Priests</HI> (called <HI>Seculars,</HI>)
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
and those of the several Religious Orders (called by a general Title, <HI>Regulars</HI>) being left to scramble, as they could, for maintenance, the <HI>Regulars (mendicant Fryers,</HI> and others) swarming in all Places, and pre∣tending, at least, to greater Sanctity, and Austerity of Life, than the <HI>Parish-Priests,</HI> prevailed with the People, either living or dying, to give not only very considerable Estates in Lands, but also the Tythes of other Lands, and of whole Parishes, from the <HI>Pa∣rish-Priests,</HI> to their Religious Houses or Convents.</P>
<P>The Tythes, or Parsonages, so given, were then called <HI>Appropriations,</HI> because they were appropriated to this, that, or the other Religious House or Con∣vent. And I have read, that there were in <HI>England</HI> about 3845 Parsonages thus appropriated. And as Tythes were then held to be <HI>due to God and holy Church;</HI> and those Religious Orders were reputed a part of that Church: So the Tythes, as well as the Lands thus given them, were continued to them, and possessed by them, till that general Storm arose, in K. <HI>Henry</HI> 8. his time, which overturned those Religious Houses and Orders together. And here, by the way, it may be noted, That while those Religious Houses stood, a great part of the Lands which had been given to them, were, by Papal Authority, exempted from paying Tythes: Whence it is, that many of those Estates, which had belonged to those Religious Houses, remain discharged from the Burden of Tythes still.</P>
<P>As Tythes were set up here on the Authority of the <HI>Levitic Law,</HI> and in imitation of the <HI>Jewish Pra∣ctice,</HI> consonant to that Law: So while those Reli∣gious Houses stood, and the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Power prevailed here, not only the <HI>Seculars</HI> or <HI>Parish-Priests,</HI> but all those <HI>Regulars</HI> who received Tythes, were bound to pay the <HI>Tenths</HI> out of the Tythes they received to the Head of their Church, the <HI>Pope</HI> as the <HI>Levites,</HI> under the Ceremonial Law, were required to do to the Priests.</P>
<P>But after that K. <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. (upon a Quarrel be∣tween
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
the <HI>Pope</HI> and him, about his Divorce from his first Queen <HI>Catharine,</HI> which he earnestly desired, and the <HI>Pope</HI> would not grant) fell off from the <HI>Pope</HI> (though not from <HI>Popery:</HI> For after that, he retained the most pernicious Doctrines of the <HI>Romish Church,</HI> contained in the six Articles, and burnt some for de∣nying them) he threw off the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Supremacy here, and assumed it to himself; declaring himself, and being declared, first by the <HI>Clergy</HI> in their <HI>Convoca∣tion,</HI> and soon after by <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> in <HI>Parlia∣ment. The only Supream Head in Earth of the Church of England.</HI> This was done by the Statute of 26 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. c. 1. And therein it is enacted. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the King, his Heirs and Successors, Kings of this Realm, shall be taken, accepted and reputed the only Supream Head in Earth of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> And shall have and enjoy, annexed and united to the Imperial Crown of this Realm, as well the Title and Stile thereof, as all Honours, Dignities, Praeeminences, Ju∣risdictions, Privileges, Authorities, Immunities, Pro∣fits and Commodities to the said Dignity of Su∣pream Head of the same Church belonging and ap∣pertaining.

the Settlement of the <HI>Tenths</HI> (that other part of the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Revenue) upon the King, follows, in the same Statute, in these Words.</P>

<P>Thus were these two great Pillars of <HI>Papal Su∣premacy (First Fruits</HI> and <HI>Tenths)</HI> transferr'd from the <HI>Pope,</HI> (the old Head,) to the King, (the new Head of the Church,) to support and maintain that Headship in him, as they had done before in the <HI>Pope.</HI> Which Ecclesiastical Headship the King was no sooner possessed of, than he began to exercise it a∣mongst those Religious Orders; Suppressing (as <HI>Her∣bert,</HI> in his Life, p. 379. relates) the <HI>Observant Fryers</HI> at <HI>Greenwich, Canterbury, Richmond</HI> and o∣ther Places, and substituting the <HI>Augustines</HI> in their

<P>The Statute, which countenanced this Proceed∣ing, is the 27. of <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. cap. 28.

Seeing the Storm arising, which then threatned, and soon after brought Destruction on those Orders, thought it better Policy to comply with the times, and surrender upon Terms, in hopes to save something, than hold out to the last (as many did) and lose all.</P>
<P N="10">10. And indeed, the suppressing of those 376 lesser Mo∣nasteries, struck so great a Fear into the greater, that the Statute made four Years after (31 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. cap. 13.) whereby the Rest of the Religious Houses were given to the King, recites, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That divers and sundry Ab∣bots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of their own free and voluntary Mind, since the fourth of <HI>Feb.</HI> in the 27 of his Reign, had by due Order of Law, and by their sufficient Writ∣ings of Record, under their Convent and common Seals, severally given, granted and confirmed to the King his Heirs and Successors for ever, All their said Monasteries, Abbeys, Priories, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all the Mannors, Lord-ships, Lands, Tenements, <HI>Tythes,</HI> &amp;c. to them belonging; and had voluntarily renounc∣ed, left and forsaken the same.'</Q> And therefore, in the said Statute it is enacted, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the King shall have, hold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All such late Monasteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all the Sites, Circuits, Manners, Lands, Tenements, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> thereunto belonging.'</Q> In the ennumeration of the Particulars whereof, (which are many) <HI>Tythes,</HI> Parsonages, appropriate, and Vicarages are expresly mentioned. All which (as likewise all other Religi∣ous Houses, with the Revenues thereof, which should there after be dissolved, suppressed, relinquished, for∣feited, or given to the King, and which by that Sta∣tute are settled on him) he was to hold and enjoy,
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
in as large and ample Manner, and Form, as the late Abbots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had held or of right ought to have held, the same, in Right of their said late Monasteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. From hence this Observation arises. That since those Religious Orders did hold the <HI>Tythes</HI> which they possessed, upon the supposed Right of their being due <HI>to God and Holy Church,</HI> which they held themselves, and were by others holden to be a part of; and the King received those <HI>Tythes</HI> and <HI>Parsonages</HI> (amongst the rest of the Revenues of the Religious Houses) as well those that were resigned to him by the Govern∣ours of those Houses themselves, as the rest which by Act of Parliament he took, upon the same Right on which those Religious Orders had holden them: He also must hold them upon that supposed Right of their being due <HI>to God and Holy Church;</HI> which he then held himself, and was holden by all, both <HI>Clergy</HI> and <HI>Laity,</HI> to be the only <HI>Supream Head</HI> of here in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> And as upon that supposed Right (of their be∣ing <HI>due to God and Holy Church)</HI> on which the Reli∣gious Houses held them, they passed them from those Houses to the King, as <HI>supream Head of the Church:</HI> So on the same supposed Right (of their being <HI>due to God and Holy Church)</HI> they passed from the King, as <HI>supream Head of the Church,</HI> to those (whether <HI>Spiri∣tual</HI> or <HI>Lay</HI> Persons) unto whom the King granted them. For they stuck not long in the King's Hand: But he, of his own meer Motion, Liberality and Be∣nignity (as the Statute in the 33d Year of his Reign, cap. 39. relates) had by that time freely given and granted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> unto divers and sundry of the Lords and Nobles, as well <HI>Spiritual</HI> as <HI>Temporal,</HI> and unto divers and many other Persons and Bodies politick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> divers and many sundry Honours, Castles, Ma∣nors, Lands, Tenements, and among the rest, <HI>Re∣ctories,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="12">12. But great care was taken to retain, and keep up the Character of <HI>Spirituality,</HI> which had formerly been
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
stamped upon those <HI>Rectories, Parsonages,</HI> and other Revenues by <HI>Tythes,</HI> into what Hands soever they were passed. And therefore, by the Statute of 32 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. cap. 7. in case of with-holding, or denying to pay the Tythes, all Persons claiming them <HI>(Impropria∣tors,</HI> as well as <HI>Priests)</HI> are restrained from suing in the <HI>Temporal Courts,</HI> and limitted to the <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> or <HI>Spiritual Courts</HI> only, for the Recovery of them.</P>
<P>And that they might still have Dependence upon the <HI>Supremacy,</HI> care was taken, from the first, by the Statute of 27 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. cap. 27. That none of these Estates, which then had come, or should come, from any of those Religious Houses to the King, should pass from him by Grant to any Person whatsoever, without an express Reservation of a <HI>Tenth.</HI> And in a subsequent Statute (33 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. cap. 39.) complaint being made that, altho' out of those Grants, which the King had made to sundry Persons, of Honours, Castles, Mannors, Lands, Tenements, Rectories, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (which were under the Survey of the <HI>Court of Aug∣mentations)</HI> the <HI>Tenths</HI> had been reserved; yet the Persons unto whom such Grants had been made, though they had quietly enjoyed and taken the Issues and Profits of those Lands, Rectories, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had not paid the reserved Rents to the King: Provision was made in that Statute, by several <HI>Forfeitures</HI> and <HI>No∣mine-Poenae</HI>'s to enforce the Payment thereof.</P>
<P>Nor was Care taken of the <HI>Ecclesiastical Head</HI> (the <HI>King)</HI> only, but of the <HI>Ecclesiastical Members</HI> (the <HI>Clergy)</HI> also: Many, if not most, of which had Pen∣sions, or Portions issuing out of those Parsonages, Re∣ctories, or other spiritual Benefices (as they were counted) which the Religious Orders held: for, be∣sides that upon the increasing of those <HI>Appropriations,</HI> whereby the <HI>Parish Priests</HI> were pinch'd, there had been Provision made early, in the time of K. <HI>Richard</HI> the <HI>Second,</HI> for the <HI>Vicars,</HI> as well as for the <HI>Poor;</HI> the Statute of 15 <HI>Ric.</HI> 2. 6. directing, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That, upon the
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
<HI>Appropriation</HI> of such Churches, the <HI>Diocaesian</HI> of the Place (or Bishop of the Diocess) shall ordain, according to the value of such Churches, a conve∣nient Sum of Money to be paid, and distributed Yearly, of the Fruits and Profits of the same Churches, to the poor Parishioners; and also, that the Vicar be well and sufficiently endowed.'</Q> Which Statute (so far, at least, as concerned the Vicars) was afterwards confirmed by another Statue of 4. <HI>Hen.</HI> 4. cap. 12. which expresly ordains, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the Statute of Appropriation of Churches, and of the Endow∣ment of Vicars in the same, made the 15th Year of K. <HI>Ric.</HI> the 2<HI>d</HI> be firmly holden, and put in due Exe∣cution:'</Q> I say, besides these, the Stat. of 34 and 35 of <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. cap. 19. takes notice, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the Arch-Bi∣shops, Bishops, Arch-Deacons and other Ecclesia∣stical Persons, of both Provinces of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> having formerly, in right of their Churches received out of the late Monasteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> divers Pensions, and other Profits, had after the Dissoluti∣on of those Houses, been disturbed, and denied of the having, receiving, and gathering of the said Pen∣sions,'</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whereupon it is, in the said Statute, enacted, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That if any Person or Persons, being Far∣mer or Occupier of any Mannors, Lands, Tene∣ments, Parsonges, Benefices, or other Hereditaments of any of the said late Monasteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by the King's Gift, Grant, Sale, Exchange, or other wise, out of which any such Pensions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have been here∣tofore lawfully going, answered or paid to any of the Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Arch-Deacons, and o∣ther Ecclesiastical Persons abovesaid, do, at any time after the First Day of <HI>April</HI> next coming, wil∣fully deny the Payment thereof, Then it shall be lawful for the said Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Arch-Deacons, or other Ecclesiastical Persons aforesaid, being so denied to be satisfied and paid there of, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to proceed in the Ecclesiastical Courts, for the re∣covery thereof.'</Q></P>
<P N="14"><PB N="32" REF="33"/>
14. By which Statute, all Pensions payable to Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Arch-Deacons, or other Ecclesiasti∣cal Person, that had been possessed thereof, at or within Ten Years next before the time of the Disso∣lution of the Monasteries, out of the Parsonages, Re∣ctories, or Tythes holden by the said Monasteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are confirmed and assured to such Arch-Bishops, Bi∣shops, Arch-Deacons, and other Ecclesiastical Per∣sons still.</P>
<P N="15">15. So that, upon the whole, besides what hath been said of Tythes in general, with respect to the <HI>Judaizing,</HI> and denying of Christ, by the paying thereof (which extends alike to all <HI>Tythes,</HI> those claimed by the <HI>Impro∣priator,</HI> as well as those claimed by the <HI>Priest)</HI> the <HI>Im∣propriate Tythes</HI> being generally charged, either with some Payment to the <HI>Vicars,</HI> for enlarging of their <HI>Stipends,</HI> or with <HI>Pensions</HI> to the Arch-Bishops, Bi∣shops, Arch-Deacons, and other Ecclesiasticks: all such of them as are so charged, come under the same Objection, that is made against paying to the Priest, <HI>viz.</HI> The upholding of a false Ministry, to perform a false Worship. And if any <HI>Impropriation</HI> may be supposed to be free from all those Charges: yet all <HI>Impropriators,</HI> as well as <HI>Priests,</HI> being bound to pay the reserved <HI>Tenths</HI> to the King, as <HI>Supream Head of the Church</HI> (which were wont before to be paid to the <HI>Pope,</HI> while he was owned for <HI>Head of the Church)</HI> the paying of Tythes to an <HI>Impropria∣tor,</HI> is a <HI>Recognizing,</HI> and <HI>acknowledging</HI> of a Man (Bad or Good, <HI>Popish</HI> or <HI>Protestant,</HI> as it happens) to be the only <HI>Supream Head on Earth of the Church</HI> Which is to set an <HI>Human Head</HI> to a <HI>Spiritual Body:</HI> and to divest and deprive our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> of his undoubted Right, who the Apostle says expres∣ly, is <HI>the Head of the Body, the Church,</HI> Col. 1. 18. <HI>And that not of Man's making or appointing; but God</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>hath given him to be the Head over all things to the Church, which is his Body,</HI> Ephes. 1. 22, 23.</P>
