<HEAD>DEDICATION.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FLY, comic scenes! where distant Ganges laves</L>
<L>Hindostan's golden shores, with hallow'd waves;</L>
<L>Where palms gigantic rear their tufted heads,</L>
<L>And nature in colossal vegetation spreads,</L>
<L>Where rich ananas court the Indian's eye,</L>
<L>And groves of citrons fan the fev'rish sky,</L>
<L>Where rattling canes around the riv'lets play,</L>
<L>And the centennial aloe drinks the day!</L>
<L>In their deep shades bid Lucidorus smile,</L>
<L>His heavy sense of <HI>distant</HI> hours beguile.</L>
<L>Bid him not think, because I gaily write,</L>
<L>That heavy hours to him, to me, are light;</L>
<L>My native spirits, bounding from repose,</L>
<L>Bear me, unwilling, where Castalia flows.</L>
<L>I love to weep, love the soft feast of grief,</L>
<L>Court mournful thoughts, nor ever wish relief;—</L>
<L><HI>Sadness</HI> I woo, yet still the phantom flies,</L>
<L>And <HI>joy</HI> seduces, whilst I ask for sighs.</L>
<L><PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
But Hymen frowns, and joy no longer cheers,</L>
<L>Weeping, I sink—Thalia drinks my tears:</L>
<L>He tears my heart; she my rapt soul inspires;</L>
<L>He chills with grief; she fills me with her fires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, Lucidorus! pass <HI>my</HI> distant hours—</L>
<L>By turns subdued, the slave of rival powers;</L>
<L>And thus hath nature in my little frame</L>
<L>Still various been, and variously the same.</L>
<L>My heart so keenly feels, 'twere death to live,</L>
<L>Did not bright spirits its strong sense relieve.</L>
<L>Through THESE capricious, desultory, gay,</L>
<L>As though I felt not, glides th' unconscious day;</L>
<L>Through THIS I droop, I sadden, and complain,</L>
<L>Dragging, with pensive steps, life's length'ning chain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In blithesome mood <HI>"More Ways than One"</HI> had birth,</L>
<L>Offspring of brilliant morns, and eves of mirth;</L>
<L>The laughing muse in sprightliest vein was by,</L>
<L>And "quips, and cranks," lay lurking in her eye.</L>
<L>O! may her spirit from its pages dart,</L>
<L>Dance o'er your nerves, and live within your heart!</L>

<L>SOME <HI>eau de luce!</HI> Your fans, dear ladies, pray!</L>
<L>Strait from Parnassus—'tis a dev'lish way!</L>
<L>I might have strode our Pegasus's back,</L>
<L>But the poor devil's grown so mere a hack;</L>
<L>So often call'd upon—taught such strange paces,</L>
<L>That alter'd woefully, alack, his case is!</L>
<L>In former times, but once or twice a-year</L>
<L>The fiery steed was summon'd to appear;</L>
<L>Then in elegiac <HI>pas grave</HI> seen dancing,</L>
<L>Or in a comedy-curvet came prancing:</L>
<L>A tragedy each spring, a birth-day ode,</L>
<L>Was all his bus'ness on the Muse's road:</L>
<L>But now, such hurrying, helter-skelter work—</L>
<L>Each cart-horse moves with a genteeler jirk;</L>
<L>So—in a word, your patience not t' abuse,</L>
<L>We've sent our Pegasus to learn of <HI>Hughes.</HI></L>

<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
<L>My business here?—Plainly and flatly this—</L>
<L>To beg your Honours not to frown or hiss.</L>
<L>Thalia sent me, and it makes me sad,</L>
<L>For <HI>"entre nous,</HI> (says I) the thing is bad."</L>
<L>"Tut, fool!" the Muse replies—"this powder take,</L>
<L>"Long I've reserv'd it for a last dear stake—</L>
<L>"This powder take—dear Mercury, be quick"—</L>
<L>Here 'tis—a mighty spell, in this slim stick.</L>
<L>Scarce had she left me, when Melpomé came—</L>
<L>"Jove's Messenger, (says she) I'm in a flame!</L>
<L>"I know where Thal' has sent you—never sham it,</L>
<L>"But bribe 'em, God of Thieves! bribe 'em to damn it!"</L>
<L>"No, Madam, damn me, if I do!" I cry'd—</L>
<L>She aim'd a blow, I bow'd, and hither hied.</L>

<L>Now for my spell—</L>
<STAGE>[Blows some powder out of his caduceus.</STAGE>
<L>There 'tis—I see it spread!</L>
<L>'Tis felt in ev'ry heart—in ev'ry head!</L>
<L>Now shall you fancy character and wit;</L>
<L>Taste in the boxes, humour in the pit.</L>
<L>You'll fancy, friends, that 'tis so droll and funny—</L>
<STAGE>[To the upper gallery.</STAGE>
<L>And you, that you've some substance for your money:</L>
<STAGE>[To the gallery.</STAGE>
<L>But should the charm dissolve e'er the play ends,</L>

<P>Preakfasted?—Yes, Sir! Though we live at the court end of the town, we have prought up all our Welch customs. Our master hates Lonton manners, and Lonton laties. What is your pusiness, goot Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>A business he will probably like, though it may concern a London lady. Acquaint him that the writings are engross'd, and that I have brought them, to fill up the blanks, and sign.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLERK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, in the fashionable course of things, how long may it be before I shall draw up the arti∣cles of separation for this young couple? It sometimes falls out for the good of the profession, that the happy pair see but one Christmas together. Nay, I have more than once in my time, engross'd the articles of marriage and separation with the same goose quill.</P>
<P>So, here comes the father of the bridegroom, to pore over the writings, I suppose. Come, good, <HI>wary</HI> Sir; if you don't quicken your motions, the young gentleman will excuse your cares;—every movement of that cane speaks a week's delay.</P>

<P>Well, you may add the names in the next room; but I shan't sign 'till I have look'd your parch∣ments cantiously over. No loop-holes for cavils—no expressions that will bear <HI>ingenious</HI> explanations. Defend me from the ingenuity of lawyers!</P>

<P>Mr. Calipash a surfeit fever—hum! with the help of bark and aromatics, it may be pro∣longed three weeks, without injury to the patient.—As to old lady Juniper, frequent visits will be useful,—for in one tapping more she'll come to the dregs; and for my friend, Mrs. Langrish, if I can't prevail on her to prate less, she won't last me another spring.—That woman will talk two hours without breathing, to describe the effects of an emetic; and, if I did not lower her now and then by a gentle cathartic, she'd evaporate through the lingual organs, like air through a cracked bladder.</P>

<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER>FEELOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Names, and sums, why are they wanting?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EVERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that one may be clear. Your niece has thirty thousand pounds; and you agree that she shall be mine on paying you one-third for your consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FEELOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>One half.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EVERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>No,—one-third. I am sure ten thousand pounds for a simple <HI>aye</HI> is very well; we know a place, where they'd say aye for half the money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FEELOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, don't libel your betters, till you are poor, and want a pension. As to our affair, consi∣der every thing. You know I boarded Arabella, with two sisters, at a village in Cornwall, who could teach her nothing but her sampler; the sole employment of her life, for sixteen years, has been her needle, with the occasional reliefs of making seed-cake, and stewing codlings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EVERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know all that—I know all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FEELOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, you know, but you don't draw the inference. Let me tell you that a girl who can't write, who never heard of Point or Brussels; whose only game at cards is <HI>beggar my neighbour;</HI> and who thinks the Play-house, Ranelagh, and Vauxhall, the three great turnpikes to the devil, is a better fortune with <HI>fifteen,</HI> than a town bred miss with <HI>thirty</HI> thousand pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EVERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, 'tis in vain to argue. Here take the parchments,—fill up the blanks, and write your name. Shall I see my little Bell?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FEELOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure. Call down my Niece. Tell her my Lord Penmanmeaur is here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EVERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>How shall we manage when she finds that I am not a lord, and that she will not be a ladyship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FEELOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho! that's easily managed with such
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
a novice. Tell her that a peerage, like the parliament, lasts but seven years, and that your time is up. Here she comes! so, Arabella, here's his lordship.</P>

<SPEAKER>EVERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>My pretty Bell, my pretty Bell! why so sad?—on the verge of riding under your own coronet,—why so sad?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am always sad, I think. They told me, when I left Cornwall, I was coming to London to be very happy, but indeed I was happier there. In the mornings I rambled in the woods, and used to listen to the sweet birds till they made me weep;—in the even∣ings I walk'd by moonlight.—Oh! how I love moon∣light walks! with the distant village sounds dying on the ear, till, like the soft shades of the flowers, they could hardly be distinguish'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EVERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you may have moon-light in Lon∣don, when it is not foggy; and sounds of all sorts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>But my uncle never suffers me to stir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FEELOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, to be sure—not till you are mar∣ried.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EVERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor then neither, without your hus∣band.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor then neither! why they tell me, but I don't care about it, that when I am married I must pay visits, and receive company, and ride in Hyde Park, and be always in public, without once thinking of my husband.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>EVERG.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[apart</STAGE> Doctor! five thousand must be added for that.</P>

<P>Why, how now, hussey!—who has been putting these wicked notions into your head?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
<SPEAKER>ARAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, sure they can't be wicked, for the Rector's wife and daughters over the way do so; and go out in fine carriages, and have cards on Sundays.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FEELOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hussey! hussey! that's a Bishop's fa∣mily—a parish priest dared not be so wicked for his ears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EVERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, doctor, don't be so harsh—my little pet will be a good girl. I have convinced her that she was made on purpose to be my wife; and that it will be the duty of my wife to hate gadding, and particu∣larly to hate all young fellows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—you said <HI>particularly</HI> those with cock∣ades and gorgets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EVERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I?—then I was too slack. They are all the same—the gorgeted, the scarf'd, the broad bands, and the narrow bands; if they are young, you must hate them all—and if they presume to talk non∣sense to you, make me your secret keeper, and then I shall be able to hold you up, as the exact model of a perfect wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FEELOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and, like other models, it will be very badly copied. But pray, mistress, in this pretty lesson of your's, where do you find any thing about your visitings, and gadding about, in the libertine stile you were just now speaking of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EVERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no;—no modest woman receives visits from any but relations; nor, amongst those, from none of a remoter degree than uncles and aunts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, not a Cousin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EVERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not if it's a male cousin.—Oh horrid! a male cousin in the family of a young married woman is a worse monster than a man-tiger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
<SPEAKER>ARAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Mr. Bellair is <HI>not</HI> my Cousin,—so I may let him come without any harm:—Oh! how I shall like to support his poor aching head on my bosom; and, when he is fainting, to give him cordials, and weep over him till he recovers.</P>
<STAGE>[aside.</STAGE>

<P>What are you saying, Arabella?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was only conning my lesson, Sir; that part of it is so pretty, that, whenever I think on it, I sigh, and feel so melancholy!—and yet 'tis a melancholy sweeter than all the pleasure I have ever tasted.</P>

<P>Very well.

<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, they are so used to wonders, you may make them believe any thing; but have you never yet found a moment to convince <HI>the Lady,</HI> that you have as much health and assurance as any man in town?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never,—nor do I know that I yet wish it, for I should then lose the luxury of her tender assistances, the soft pressure of her hand, and the tear dropping from her blue eye on my cheek, whilst she believes me in a state of insensibility—How can I bear to give up all that?</P>

<P>Faith, I don't know.</P>

<P>Then to hear her sigh, and ask her uncle, in the teaderest accents, <HI>"if nothing can be done for me?"</HI> I swear, a direct avowal of her passion would not give me such transport. How charming! to witness na∣ture's

<P>One of our first poets is very welcome to have sung, or said it. But give me a woman whose soul is <HI>all inform'd,</HI> and alive to every enjoyment of taste and feeling!

<P>Where?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>To call on Sir Marvel Mushroom. I pay him a visit once in six months, stay six minutes; and laugh, after I have left him, six hours.</P>

<P>Been in London a month, and not know Sir Marvel! Why, Sir Marvel was the other day a grocer, or an ironmonger, or a cheesemonger, I don't remem∣ber which—near one of the city gates, I don't remember where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is he now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Now!</HI> a man of figure, Sir—a man of ex∣pence. To be seen every morning in Hyde Park, on a little Galloway, followed by two servants on a brace of hunters. Every noon in a phaeton, making the circuit of St. James's-street, Pall Mall, and the Hay Market; and every night, in every place where a ticket or effron∣tery can admit him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but where's the peculiarity of all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, all that's nothing—the <HI>captivating</HI> part of the Knight is to come. At the youthful age of forty some relation left him a large estate:—He threw off his apron, drove to his domains in a post chaise <HI>and six,</HI> roasted bullocks, broach'd hogsheads, &amp;c. &amp;c. was next year sheriff for the county, and car∣ried up an address—This accounts for his title.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! Well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>His Honour now found it necessary to <HI>read,</HI> on the penalty of being silent wherever he went—to
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
which his loquacity could not submit. He accordingly buys every author on every subject; peruses poetry, tactics, philosophy, botany, cookery, agriculture; and, to shew that he can read, is for ever quoting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tiresome enough!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all—as <HI>he</HI> manages, 'tis most plea∣sant; for beginning to read so late in life, with the <HI>ad∣vantage</HI> of a very bad memory, he makes the happiest mistakes imaginable. His head contains an olio of arts and sciences, so mingled and confused that he constantly speaks of one thing for another; and if Boyle or Cla∣rendon are mention'd, ten to one but he'll give ye an old catch as a specimen of their talents.</P>

<P>Well but, monsieur, have you thought of a subject for me to day—You can't conceive how bril∣liant I was at Mrs. Flanconade's yesterday.

<P>Critically so—perhaps not; but she is <HI>more—</HI>she is <HI>captivating!</HI> Her voice is melody; and there is elegant mind in every motion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Elegant</HI> mind, do you call it? I am sure her's is a most insolent one.—I knew her abroad; and this woman, who in your opinion is made up of melody, sweetness, and witchery, is the most perverse, the most capricious, the most proud, the—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tut! tut! that is to say, you have been her slave, and a <HI>neglected</HI> one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, there is hardly a man of your acquaint∣ance who will not subscribe to my opinion of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The strongest proof of her charms, and of her power. I adore her for being hated by all the men who have had the presumption to sigh for her. There is a degree of impurity in a woman who smiles on, and listens to, all who choose to make love to her. When I marry, my wife must bring me an ear as unessayed as her heart; and the first whispers of love that reach her, must be from my lips.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, carry your whispers to Miss Archer, kneel, sigh, weep, and—be despised!</P>

<P>Yes, I flatter myself I have taste that way. We have moderns who pretend to paint—ha, ha!—save us from modern painters!—the antique is the thing! Now, for a portrait painter, there's nobody like that little droll fellow, Erasmus; he gave us flesh and blood to the life!—But for a cabinet piece, give me a Dutch Fair by Scipio Africanus. What is he laugh∣ing at? he behaves very oddly!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must excuse him—unhappily igno∣rant—has read nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! I'll offer him my library. My

dear Sir, you'll pardon me; but one can make no figure without reading. In such a place as Leyden, you can have had no opportunities—My library is at your service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do me a most particular favour, Sir Marvel. Well chosen, I am sure it must be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, as to that—yes, yes, Sir—aye, Mr. Carlton, you have seen my library. All the poets from Mecaenas to Shaftsbury. All the dramatic writers of name—including Shakespear, Lycurgus, and Pliny.—Read <HI>well,</HI> Sir; and after you have read, begin to write.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Write!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes; one is not finish'd without it—every body writes. One cannot put one's head into company without meeting half a dozen ode-writing misses, and matrons who compose essays—but satire is my forte.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then <HI>you</HI> write, Sir Marvel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Trifles! trifles! There is a thing of mine in the papers to-day. You know, for every body knows, Miss Archer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know she is the most haughty, affected creature living; and to-day I gave her in doggerel—mark that—in <HI>doggerel;</HI> heroic verse would have been too dignified for the subject. There she is, in the poet's corner, at full length.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Satirize Miss Archer!—surely you have not dared.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes I have. Why not satirize Miss Ar∣cher? I satirize myself sometimes, and answer it again the next day.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>By Heaven! on reflection, it pleases me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, to tell you the truth, there is ano∣ther reason—Now I shall surprise ye, I know;—I hardly expect ye to believe me—but—in short, she has actually refused <HI>me!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Refused you! Nay then, Carlton, you may as well give it up—You'll hardly expect to succeed where Sir Marvel has failed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I don't know that—I don't know that; those capricious women generally choose the worst—You know the proverb—dainty dogs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Delicate! So 'tis revenge, then—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, revenge—But I still continue to vi∣sit her in a friendly way; for she's fashionable, and one finds the first dash there: Besides, I have such good-nature and generosity about me, that I never can be out of humour with people to their faces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>In course, you don't mean to acknowledge your satire. But is it very severe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, tears her like a bramble bush.</P>

<P>Most particularly so:—In short, I want to be introduced to her, and I know no better way.</P>

<P>Yes, yes, she feels it.—I am not surprised at it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Miss Juvenile, I am surprised that people will give opinions so rashly. Miss, the person who wrote this little <HI>morceau</HI> is remarkable for his skill in <HI>belles lettres.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> JUV.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Belles lettres!—</HI>skill in <HI>bell metal</HI> might do for such lines as these—they might be hammer'd out of any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, ma'am! very well! I must beg leave to say, that it is not so agreeable to hear the talents of one's friends slighted.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> JUV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! you are mighty liberal;—in general 'tis the most agreeable treat a friend can

<P>Nay, if you wont believe me, come this evening and see him here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> JUV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, really now, it is surprising!—I did not think he had possess'd so much ill-nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ill-nature! Let me tell you, Miss Juvenile, private ill-nature may be a public good. To make people's time pass happily is very benevolent, and if it was not for a little pleasant thing of this sort, now and then in a morning, people's chocolate would be as dull and infipid as the Ve—Venetian black broth.</P>

<P>Spartan, I fancy you mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spart—gad! that's very true; what a ridiculous mistake!—ha, ha, ha! Thank ye, Miss—thank ye. Yes, I remember now, the Venetians were those who joined the Macedonians in the war against Philip;—how could I make such a mistake!—ha, ha, ha!</P>

<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you really mean to persuade the

innocent thing, that running away with <HI>Harry Bellair</HI> is the most honourable step she can take?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>At least the happiest; for does she not love me? What is her fate if she stays? She will be huddled, in less than three days, into a marriage, with a passion in her heart, adding bitterness to disgust and mortifica∣tion.</P>

<SP>

<P>Where would you place her to be in safety?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a friend in town, the gravity of whose character will be a shield to her's. I have ne∣glected him since I came from Leyden, but I'll go and make it up with him this very day. Let that pass—now to my question; will you assist in the <HI>enleve∣ment?</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I am not summon'd to the adorable Archer. If my scheme there takes place—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's really too absurd! If she believes you to be the author of that vile abuse, and invites you, it must be to poison you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't care with what <HI>view</HI> it is, if I am but invited;—I shall be sure, at least, not to rank with the brilliant captains, the Sir Tommys, and Sir Neddys, who are receiv'd, court'sey'd to, and forgot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, you'll certainly be remember'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am convinced that a woman who has been admired all over Europe, and returns with an untouch'd heart, is not to be won by flattery, or by stooping to her power. 'Tis <HI>pride</HI> secures her, and her pride must be taken down, before Love can find a vulnerable place for his darts.</P>

<P>Oh, I found her as inflammable as one of Montgolfier's balloons. The whole town had been with her—the whole town is mad about my satire!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then 'tis in vain for me to hope for the credit of being it's author—it is not in mortal wight to lend so much reputation, for half an hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, but you are mistaken—I disclaim'd it—disclaim'd all the glory—and she desires this even∣ing to see the incomparable author.—So you will, Pyramus like, drive, for one day, the chariot of the Sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I?—will she see me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>She pants for an interview: the beauteous Helen was not more desirous of receiving Leander, when he swam every night-across the Mediterranean. I have promised to carry you this evening. But be sure you don't give me as the poet, 'till I give the word.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing can be farther from my design—You shall gather your laurels when you please. I prize this mode of introduction so highly, that I know not how to return the favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Lord, nothing can be so easy. I hear you have a pretty poetical quill, and that you some∣times write Latin verses;—publish a volume, and call it mine.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll consider it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may throw in a touch of Greek, too. I should learn Greek, for the pleasure of reading Ovid, but their d—d crooked characters are so alike, that one may as well attempt to learn Spanish, of Dutch mack∣erel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear friend, I am too impatient to give the time I ought to your erudition;—I had rather hold a convention with my taylor and valet than with Ovid and Horace; and had rather this night be as well drest as <HI>Count Grammont,</HI> than as well read as <HI>Doctor Johnson.</HI></P>

<P>Dear me, how can you think so? Spiders are frightful creatures, but young men are not frightful. When my uncle took me out in his chariot, they looked at me so kindly! If I had been their sister, they could not have seemed to like me better.</P>

<P>No, they would not then have liked you so well. But you are very ignorant, Bell; very ignorant, indeed! However, you have time enough to improve.—When you are Lady Penmanmaure, you'll be quite a different thing. Good by'e, pretty Bell! you shall see me again to-night.</P>

<P>MY sweet harp, I must abandon thee! That rap announces my satyrist. Ha, ha!

<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, a mere trifle! not worth mentioning, Sir Marvel. Miss Archer, I hear you have been a traveller; and that, when in Italy, they persuaded you to visit some of the Levant Islands. I wonder, when so far, your taste did not carry you to Greece! You can conceive nothing so charming as the Grecian women!—nothing so interesting as their style of living!—you would have found all Arcadia realiz'd.</P>

<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I endeavoured to persuade a fair Greek, that the fate of my countrywomen was happier than their's.—"Oh, it is impossible," said she; "their liberty makes them <HI>capricious,</HI> and their power over the men <HI>assuming;</HI> they grow old in planning new con∣quests, and, alive <HI>only</HI> to the pleasure of admiration, seldom taste the exquisite bliss of true passion."

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Juvenile!—'tis no wonder I did not immediately recollect you in that dress, when I left you in a white frock. I saw your brother well at Vienna. You play, Miss Archer. I am charm'd that you prefer the harp—'tis so graceful for the lady—so advantageous for the voice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[In a pet]</STAGE> Why 'tis downright jingle!—a wooden cimbal is a better thing! I thought to have heard nothing but what concern'd my ver—I mean your verses; and here you have whisk'd us to Padua, then to Greece, then we had a swing to Vienna in Turkey, and now we must have a Canterbury tale about the merits of the Welch harp. Why, I tell you, Miss Archer, <HI>this</HI> is the gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> JUV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Miss Archer, <HI>this</HI> is the gentle∣man,

who travell'd all over Europe, to qualify himself to write an epigram on you;—I think he might have managed the matter without going so far for his wit.</P>

<P>Heavens! how could this man! <STAGE>[aside]</STAGE> Miss Juvenile means to be severe upon you, Sir, but don't be disheartened.

<P>Yes, indeed;—we learn those kind of

<P>Yes, so he is, a very great deceiver; for he brought me here to Lord Panmanmawr, and call'd him Mr. Evergreen;—and now he won't marry me himself, and wants to force me to marry the old lord. <STAGE>[Weeping.</STAGE></P>

<P>Your patient, Sir, is as well as a patient can be, who is out of the reach of his d—d Doctor. No further occasion for asses milk, stimulatives, balsamics, or coolers.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, poor Doctor!—no more fees—he has given you the <HI>go-by</HI> fairly. Is it not a shame that a man of your prowess in the fields of Galen, should not be able to conquer such a pitiful hectic as drove him him out of the world? why, a physician ought to have the diseases at his call, and whistle them on and off, as a huntsman does his hounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, 'twas a crying sin, to let such a spirited fine young fellow be kick'd out of life by a rascally little feveret! An old woman would have cured him; but such an obstinate confidence in the skill of the renown'd Doctor Feelove! He died full of resentment, and his last words were—"Toss the Doctor in a blanket."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FEELOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can forgive that—I can forgive that—but I can't forgive your illiberality, Sir. An old wo∣man cure him! It was not in the power of all the phy∣sicians between London and the Alps to cure him;—not an herb, gum, wood, or fungus in the whole me∣dicopeia, that could have given him breath two days longer.</P>

<P>Why, Sir, there is a vile story in cir∣culation, which, if true, would sink me beneath the lowest med'cine grinder—beneath a mixer of eggs and turpentine—beneath the cork in a julep bottle; nothing less than that Bellair is in perfect health, and so alive to youth and beauty, as to have run away with my niece—they say <HI>that!</HI></P>

<P>Preserve him! you might as well have expected my skill in physic to have preserv'd the French bank from breaking.</P>

<P>Well, notwithstanding my affected petulance at your entrance, I am highly gratified that Bellair is where he is—and I'll recommend you to all my friends and acquaintance. But I wonder the loss of your niece sits so lightly, my little Hippocrates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FEELOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir, I have a great heart—a pro∣digious great heart! its feelings are for the faculty. A girl may run away from an uncle without reproach to him; but when a patient runs away from the sentence of his physician, the reputation of the doctor must soon run after him.</P>

<P>Aye, you may well wonder—'tis more than one in ten would do. Come, come—lower the scorn of that brow, and hear reason.</P>

<P>I'll hear nothing, Sir, and I insist on your leaving this house instantly.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha!—that's unreasonable, consider∣ing where you are. But, come! I'll allow you half a dozen ill-humoured things, and then you shall attend to me.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> ARCHER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can the monster mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mean! why to marry you, Petulance! to give you a right to plague me for ever. What an acquisition, for a woman of spirit! Oh, I feel al∣ready the horrors of my future fate, but I am resolv'd to go through it—I <HI>will</HI> go through it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> ARCHER.</SPEAKER>
<P>You imagine that the whimsicalness of this must excuse its freedom, Mr. Carlton, but be assured—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho, pho, don't let us waste time;—the plain English of our situation is this;—you are a coquette, and I am a man of the world; you would like to make me act like a fool, and I am determined to make you act like a woman of sense—a proof that I am the best Christian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> ARCHER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Sir—very well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I admired you, the first moment I beheld you, but resolv'd not to be made a dangler—which, if I had approach'd you in the common modes of court∣ship, would have inevitably followed.—I, therefore, took the road you have seen, and in consequence you'll condescend to <HI>be</HI> happy, and <HI>make</HI> happy, a year or two sooner than your coquetry would have allow'd.</P>

<P>Yes; and that in spite of all those pretty affected airs—they are <HI>but</HI> affected, charmer, you know,

for, at this moment, you feel that I have a kind of re∣sistless impudence about me, which you love for its novelty.</P>

<P>If I thought it possible, Sir—The wretch reads my very heart.</P>
<STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nothing but a wish to <HI>convince</HI> me of it, could bring you to my lodgings; you see the ef∣fects of carrying airs too far. You used me in the morning with such barbarity, that your heart, hard as it is, was smote with the reflection, and then you run after me again to make it up. Oh, you dear commi∣serating—</P>

<P>Is it possible that you did not know it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> ARCHER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Know it! Heaven and earth! how can you dare think that I did? I came to visit Miss Mel∣ville, whom I attended here this morning, without the most distant idea, that—Bless me! what an imputa∣tion has the interest I took in her welfare, subjected me to? I shall never cease to regret the occasion.</P>
</SP>

<P>Nor I to bless it. How many tedious long months of hopes and fears, caprices and coquetry, have I been saved by it?</P>

<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, oh, you are agreed! see the effect of a few good stanzas—'twas my poetry, Madam, not his, upon my honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> ARCHER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What poetry?</P>

<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that little jeu d' esprit, you know, which was publish'd yesterday, about you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> ARCHER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! was not <HI>that</HI> Mr. Carlton's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; he beg'd to pass for the author, but it was my own composition entirely; without the as∣sistance of any mortal man, whatever—deny it, Mr. Carlton, if you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> ARCHER.</SPEAKER>
<P>So those wretched lines were yours? It was you who chose to represent me to the public in so odious and hateful a light!—</P>

<P>You had better have been quiet, Sir Marvel.</P>

<P>Why, this is dev'lish odd! when they passed for yours, she never said one word against them; and now they are mine, they are wretched, and odious, and hateful!</P>

<P>No, indeed, my dear creature,—but pray what brought you to Mr. Carlton's lodgings?</P>

<P>Business, Ma'am, I assure you. Pray, Sir, step this way, <STAGE><HI>[to</HI> CARLTON.]</STAGE> Here are the verses which you promis'd to get into the news-paper for me.—I have spent this whole day in polishing them.</P>

<P>My dear Madam, Sir Marvel has much more interest that way than I have.</P>

<P>Oh, I'll get 'em in—I'll get 'em in, never fear. Let me see. <STAGE>[She endeavours to snatch them.]</STAGE> "Description of Sir Marvel Mushroom, or the Crip∣plegate Knight." What, Madam, me!—me!—am I a subject for a news-paper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> JUV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes;—or for a comedy, if I could write one. You are rich in folly, Sir Marvel, and would be a treasure to the public.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Madam, you will not dare—you will not dare. Oh, the license given to these d—d newspapers! I'll get a seat in parliament, in order to vote against the freedom of the press.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> ARCHER.</SPEAKER>
<P>So would all those wretches feel, who tear the minds of the inoffensive or the worthy—were <HI>they</HI> to be stretched on the rack, to which they so unfeelingly devote others.</P>

<P>No; you must earn it by long and

<P>Indebted to her! No, 'tis to me. <HI>I</HI> wore the cloak, and <HI>I</HI> was pinch'd and pull'd whilst she escap∣ed. One can neither have credit from one's verses or one's good nature.</P>
