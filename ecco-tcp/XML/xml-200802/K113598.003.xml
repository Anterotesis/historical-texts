</FIGURE> CHAP. XXIV. EDWARD VI.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY the eighth was succeeded on the throne by his only son Edward the sixth, now in the ninth year of his age. The late king in his will, which he expected would be absolute∣ly obeyed, fixed the majority of the prince at the completion of his eighteenth year; and in the mean time appointed sixteen executors of his will, to whom, during the miniority, he
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
entrusted the government of the king and kingdom. But the vanity of his aims was soon discovered; for the first act of the execu∣tors was to chuse the earl of Hertford, who was afterwards made duke of Somerset, as protector of the realm, and in him was lodg∣ed all the regal power, together with a pri∣vilege of naming whom he would for his privy council.</P>
<P>This was a favourable season for those of the reformed religion; and the eyes of the late king were no sooner closed, than all of that persuasion congratulated themselves on the event. They no longer suppressed their sentiments, but maintained their doctrines openly, in preaching and teaching, even while the laws against them continued in full force. The protector had long been regarded as the secret parti∣zan of the reformers; and, being now freed from restraint, he scrupled not to express his intention of correcting all the abuses of the ancient religion, and of adopting still more the doctrines propagated by Luther. His power was not a little strengthened by his success a∣gainst an incursion of the Scotch, in which about eight hundred of their army were slain; and the popularity which he gained upon this occasion, seconded his views in the further pro∣pagation
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
of the new doctrines. But the cha∣racter of Somerset did not stand in need of the mean supports of popularity acquired in this manner, as he was naturally humble, civil, affable, and courteous to the meanest suitor, while all his actions were directed by motives of piety and honour.</P>
<P>The protector, in his schemes for advancing the reformation, had always recourse to the counsels of Cranmer, who; being a man of moderation and prudence, was averse to vio∣lent changes, and determined to bring over the people by insensible innovations to his own peculiar system. The person who op∣posed with the greatest authority any farther advances towards reformation, was Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, who, though he had not obtained a place at the council-board, yet from his age, experience, and capacity, was regarded by most men with some degree of veneration. Upon a general visitation of the church, which had been commanded by the primate and protector, Gardiner defended the use of images, which was now very openly attacked by the protestants; he even wrote an apology for holy water; but he particu∣larly alleged, that it was unlawful to make any change in religion during the king's mi∣nority.
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
This opposition of Gardiner drew on him the indignation of the council; and he was sent to the Fleet prison, where he was used with much harshness and severity.</P>
<P>These internal regulations were in some measure retarded by the war with Scotland, which still continued to rage with some violence. But a defeat, which that nation suffered at Musselborough, in which above ten thousand perished in the field of battle, induced them to sue for peace, in order to gain time; and the protector returned to settle the business of the reformation, which was as yet only be∣gun. But, though he acquired great po∣pularity by this expedition, he did not fail to attract the envy of several noblemen, by procuring a patent from the young king his nephew, to sit in parliament on the right hand of the throne, and to enjoy the same honours and privileges which had usually been granted the uncles of kings in England. However, he still drove on his favourite schemes of refor∣mation, and gave more consistency to the te∣nets of the church. The cup was restored to the laity in the sacrament of the Lord's supper; private masses were abolished; the king was empowered to create bishops by letters patent. Vagabonds were adjudged to be slaves for
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
two years, and to be marked with a red hot iron; an act commonly supposed to be levelled a∣gainst the strolling priests and friars. It was enacted also, that all who denied the king's supremacy, or asserted the pope's, should, for the first offence, forfeit their goods and chat∣tels, and suffer imprisonment during pleasure; for the second offence they were to incur the pain of premunire, and for the third offence to be at∣tainted of treason. Orders were soon after is∣sued by the council that candles should no lon∣ger be carried about on Candlemas day, ashes on Ash Wednesday, or palms on Palm Sun∣day. These were ancient superstitious prac∣tices, which led to immoralities that it was thought proper to restrain. An order also was issued for the removal of all images from the churches, an innovation which was much desired by the reformers, and which alone, with regard to the populace, amounted almost to a change of the established religion. The people had for some time been extremely dis∣tracted by the opposite opinions of their preach∣ers; and as they were totally incapable of judg∣ing the arguments advanced on either side, and naturally regarded every thing they heard at church, as of the greatest authority, much confusion and fluctuation resulted from this
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
uncertainty. The council first endeavoured to remove the inconvenience by laying some restraints upon preaching; but finding this ex∣pedient fail, they imposed a total silence upon preachers, which however, was removed by degrees, in proportion as the reformation gain∣ed ground among the people.</P>
<P>But these innovations, evidently calculated for the good of the people, were not brought about without some struggles at home, while the protector was but too busily employed against the Scotch, who united with, and se∣conded by France, still pushed on their inroads with unremitting animosity. Besides, there was still an enemy that he had yet to fear more than any of the former; and this was his own brother, lord Thomas Seymour, the ad∣miral, a man of uncommon talents, but proud, turbulent, and untractable. This no∣bleman could not endure the distinction which the king had always made between him and his elder brother; so that they divided the whole court and the kingdom by their oppo∣site cabals and pretensions. By his flattery and address, he had so insinuated himself into the good graces of the queen dowager, that, forgetting her usual prudence and decency, she married him immediately upon the decease of
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
the late king. This match was particularly displeasing to the elder brother's wife, who now saw that while her husband had the pre∣cedency in one place, she was obliged to yield it in another. His next step was to cabal and make a party among the nobility, who, as they hated his brother, fomented his ambition. He then bribed the king's domestics to his inter∣est; and young Edward frequently went to his house, on pretence of visiting the queen. There he ingratiated himself with his sovereign by the most officious assiduities, particularly by supplying him with money to distribute a∣mong his servants and favourites, without the knowledge of his governor. In the protector's absence with the army in Scotland, he made it his business to redouble all his arts and insinua∣tions; and thus obtained a new patent for admiral, with an additional appointment. Sir William Paget perceiving the progress he daily made in the king's affection, wrote to the protector on the subject, who finished the campaign in Scotland with all possible dis∣patch, that he might return in time to coun∣ter-work his machinations. But before he could arrive in England, the admiral had engaged in his party several of the princi∣pal nobility, and had even prevailed on the
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
king himself to write a letter to the two houses of parliament with his own hand, desiring that the admiral might be appointed his governor; but the council being apprized of his schemes, sent deputies to assure him, that if he did not desist they would deprive him of his office, send him prisoner to the Tower, and prosecute him on the last act of parliament, by which he was subject to the penalty of high treason, for attempting to disturb the peace of the govern∣ment. It was not without some severe struggles within himself, and some menaces divulged a∣mong his creatures, that he thought proper to submit, and desired to be reconciled to his bro∣ther. Yet he still nourished the same designs in secret; and his brother, suspecting his sin∣cerity, employed spies to inform him of all his private transactions.</P>
<P>But it was not in the power of persuasions or menaces to shake the admiral's unalterable views of ambition. His spouse, the queen∣dowager, had died in child-bed; and this ac∣cident, far from repressing his schemes, only seemed to promote them. He made his ad∣dresses to the Princess Elizabeth, afterwards so revered by the English; and it is said that she listened to his insinuations, contrary to the will of her father, who had excluded her the suc∣cession,
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
in case she married without the consent of council. The admiral, however, it is sup∣posed, had projects of getting over that objection; and his professions seemed to give reason to believe that he intended aiming at regal authority. By promises and persuasions he brought over many of the principal nobili∣ty to his party; he neglected not even the most popular persons of inferior rank; and he com∣puted that he could on occasion command the service of ten thousand men among his ser∣vants, tenants, and retainers. He had already provided arms for their use; and having en∣gaged in his interests Sir John Sharrington,<MILESTONE N="1548" UNIT="A.D."/> master of the mint at Bristol, a very corrupt man, he flattered himself that money would not be wanting.</P>
<P>Somerset being well ascertained of all these alarming circumstances, endeavoured by every expedient that his power or his near connec∣tion could suggest, to draw him from his de∣signs. He reasoned, he threatened, he heap∣ed new favours upon him; but all to no pur∣pose. At last he resolved to make use of the last dreadful remedy, and to attaint his own brother of high treason. In consequence of this resolution, and secretly advised to it by Dudley, earl of Warwick, a wicked ambitious
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
man, who expected to rise upon the downfall of the two brothers, he deprived him of his office of high-admiral and signed a warrant for committing him to the Tower. Yet still the protector suspended the blow, and shewed a reluctance to ruin one so nearly connected with himself: he offered once more to be sincerely re∣conciled, and give him his life, if he was con∣tented to spend the remainder of his days in re∣tirement and repentance. But finding himself unable to work on the inflexible temper of his brother by any methods but severity, he order∣ed a charge to be drawn up against him, con∣sisting of thirty-three articles; and the whole to be brought into parliament, which was now be∣come the instrument by which the admini∣stration usually punished their enemies. The charge being brought first into the house of lords, several peers, rising up in their places, gave an account of what they knew concern∣ing lord Seymour's conduct, and his criminal words and actions. There was more difficulty in managing the prosecution in the house of commons; but upon receiving a message from the king, requiring them to proceed, the bill passed in a very full house, near four hundred voting for it, and not above nine or ten against it. The sentence was soon after executed, by
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
beheading him on Tower-Hill. His death, however, was, in general, disagreeable to the nation, who considered the lord Seymour as hardly dealt with, in being condemned upon general allegations, without having an opportunity of making a defence, or con∣fronting his accusers. But the chief odium fell upon the protector; and it must be owned that there was no reason for carrying his seve∣rity to such a length as he did.</P>
<P>This obstacle being removed, the protector went on to reform and regulate the new system of religion, which was now become the chief concern of the nation. A committee of bishops and divines had been appointed by the coun∣cil to frame a liturgy for the service of the church; and this work was executed with great moderation, precision, and accuracy. A law was also enacted, permitting priests to marry; the ceremony of auricular confession, though not abolished, was left at the discretion of the people, who were not displeased at being freed from the spiritual tyranny of their instructors; the doctrine of the real presence was the last tenet of popery that was wholly abandoned by the people, as both the clergy and laity were loth to renounce so miraculous a benefit, as it was asserted to be. However, at last, not
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
only this, but all the principal opinions and prac∣tices of the Catholic religion, contrary to what the scripture authorizes, were abolished; and the reformation, such as we have it, was almost entirely completed in England.<MILESTONE N="1549" UNIT="A.D."/> With all these innovations the people and clergy in general acquiesced; and Gardiner and Bonner, were the only persons whose opposition was thought of any weight; they were, therefore, sent to the Tower, and threatened with the king's fur∣ther displeasure in case of disobedience.</P>
<P>But it had been well for the credit of the reformers, had they stopt at imprisonment only. They also resolved to become persecutors in turn; and although the very spirit of their doctrines arose from a freedom of thinking, yet they could not bear that any should controvert what they had been at so much pains to establish. A commission was granted to the primate and some others, to search after all anabaptists, heretics, or contemners of the new liturgy. Among the number of those who were supposed to incur guilt upon this oc∣casion, was one Joan Boucher, commonly call∣ed Joan of Kent; who was so extremely ob∣stinate, that the commissioners could gain no∣thing upon her. She had maintained an ab∣struse metaphysical sentiment, that Christ, as
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
man, was a sinful man; but as the Word he was free from sin, and could be subject to none of the frailties of the flesh with which he was cloathed. For maintaining this doctrine, which none of them could understand, this poor ig∣norant woman was condemned to be burnt to death as an heretic. The young king, who it seems had more sense than his ministers, refus∣ed at first to sign the death warrant; but being at last pressed by Cranmer, and vanquished by his importunities, he reluctantly complied; de∣claring, that if he did wrong, the sin should be on the head of those who had persuaded him to it. The primate, after making a new effort to reclaim the woman from her opinions, and finding her obstinate against all his arguments, at last committed her to the flames. Some time after, one Van Paris, a Dutchman, being accused of an heresy called Arianism, was con∣demned to the same punishment. He suffered with so much satisfaction, that he hugged and caressed the faggots that were consuming him; and died exulting in his situation.</P>
<P>Although these measures were intended for the benefit of the nation, and in the end turn∣ed out entirely to the advantage of society; yet they were at that time attended with many in∣conveniences, to which all changes, whatsoever,
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
are liable. When the monasteries were sup∣pressed, a prodigious number of monks were ob∣liged to earn their subsistence by their labour; so that all kinds of business were overstocked. The lands of the monasteries, also, had been formerly farmed out to the common people, so as to employ a great number of hands; and the rents being moderate, they were able to maintain their families on the profits of agri∣culture. But now these lands being possessed by the nobility, the rents were raised; and the farmers perceiving that wool was a better com∣modity than corn, turned all their fields into pasture. In consequence of this practice, the price of meal arose, to the unspeakable hardship of the lower class of people. Beside, as few hands were required to manage a pasture farm, a great number of poor people were utterly deprived of subsistence, while the nation was filled with murmurs and complaints against the nobility, who were considered as the sources of the gene∣ral calamity. To add to these complaints, the rich proprietors of lands proceeded to enclose their estates; while the tenants, regarded as an useless burthen, were expelled their habita∣tions. Even cottagers, deprived of the com∣mons on which they formerly fed their cattle, were reduced to misery; and a great decay of
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
people as well as a diminution of provisions, was observed in every part of the kingdom. To add to this picture of general calamity, all the good coin of the kingdom was hoarded up or exported abroad; while a base metal was coined at home, or imported from abroad in great abundance; and this the poor were obliged to receive in payment, but could not disburse at an equal advantage. Thus an universal dif∣fidence and stagnation of commerce took place; and nothing but loud complaints were heard in every quarter.</P>
<P>The protector, who knew that his own pow∣er was to be founded on the depression of the nobility, espoused the cause of the sufferers. He appointed commissioners to examine whe∣ther the possessors of the church-lands had ful∣filled the conditions on which those lands had been sold by the crown; and ordered all late enclosures to be laid open on an appointed day. As the object of this commission was very disagreeable to the gentry and nobility, they called it arbitrary and illegal; while the com∣mon people, fearing it would be eluded, and being impatient for redress, rose in great num∣bers, and sought a remedy by force of arms. The rising began at once, in several parts of England, as if an universal conspiracy had
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
been formed among the people. The rebels in Wiltshire, were dispersed by Sir William Herbert; those of Oxford and Gloucester, by lord Gray of Wilton; the commotions in Hampshire, Sussex, Kent, and other counties, were quieted by gentle methods; but the dis∣orders in Devonshire and Norfolk were the most obstinate, and threatened the greatest danger. In the first of these counties, the in∣surgents amounting to ten thousand men, were headed by one Humphry Arundel, an expe∣rienced soldier; and they were still more en∣couraged by sermons, which gave their revolt the air of a religious confederacy. They ac∣cordingly sent a set of articles to court, which, in general, demanded an abolition of the statutes lately made in favour of the reformation; but the ministry rejected their demands with con∣tempt, at the same time offering a pardon to all that would lay down their arms and return to their habitations. But the insur∣gents were now too far advanced to recede; and still encouraged by the monks, who were with them they laid siege to Exeter, car∣rying before them crosses, banners, holy-wa∣ter, candlesticks, and other implements of their ancient superstition; but the town was gal∣lantly defended by the inhabitants. In the
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
mean time, lord Russel had been sent against them with a small body of forces; and being reinforced by lord Gray and others, he attack∣ed, and drove them from all their entrench∣ments. Great slaughter was committed upon these deluded creatures, both in the action and the pursuit. Arundel, their leader, and several others, were sent to London, where they were condemned and executed. Many of the in∣ferior sort were put to death by martial law. The vicar of St. Thomas, one of the principal incendiaries, was hanged on the top of his own steeple, arrayed in his popish habits, with his beads at his girdle.</P>
<P>The sedition at Norfolk appeared still more alarming. The insurgents there a∣mounted to twenty thousand men; and as their forces were numerous, their demands were exorbitant. They required the suppres∣sion of the gentry, the placing new counsel∣lors about the king, and the establishment of their ancient rights. One Ket, a tanner, had assumed the priority among them; he erected his tribunal near Norwich, under an old oak, which was termed the Oak of Reformation. He afterwards undertook the siege of Nor∣wich, which having reduced, he imprisoned the mayor, and some of the principal citizens.
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
The marquis of Northampton was first sent down against them, but met with a repulse; the earl of Warwick followed soon after, at the head of six thousand men, and soon coming to a general engagement, put them entirely to the rout. Two thousand of them fell in the fight and pursuit; Ket was hanged at Nor∣wich castle, nine of his followers on the boughs of the Oak of Reformation; and the insurrection, which was the last in favour of popery, was thus entirely suppressed.</P>
<P>But though the suppression of these insur∣rections seemed to be very favourable to the interests of the protector, yet the authority which the earl of Warwick gained in quelling that of Norfolk, terminated in Somerset's ruin. Of all the ministers, at that time in the council, Dudley, earl of Warwick, was the most artful, ambitious, and unprincipled. Resolved at any rate to possess the principal place under the king, he cared not what means were to be used in acquiring it. However, unwilling to throw off the mask, he covered the most exor∣bitant views under the fairest appearances. Having associated himself with the earl of Southampton, he formed a strong party in the council, who were determined to free them∣selves from the controul the protector assumed
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
over them. That nobleman was, in fact, now grown obnoxious to a very prevailing party in the kingdom. He was hated by the nobles for his superior magnificence and power; he was hated by the Catholic party for his regard to the Reformation; he was disliked by many for his severity to his brother, besides the great estate he had raised at the expence of the church and the crown, rendered him obnoxious to all. The palace which he was then building in the Strand, served also by its magnificence, and still more by the unjust methods that were taken to raise it, to expose him to the censures of the public. The parish church of St. Mary, with three bishop's houses, were pulled down to furnish ground and materials for the struc∣ture. Several other churches were demolish∣ed, to have their stones employed to the same purpose; and it was not without an insurrec∣tion, that the parishioners of St. Margaret's Westminster, prevented their church from being pulled down to make room for the new fabric.</P>
<P>These imprudences were soon exaggerated and enlarged upon by Somerset's enemies. They represented him as a parricide, a sacrilegious tyrant, and an unjust usurper upon the pri∣vileges of the council and the rights of the king. In consequence of this, the lord St.
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
John, president of the council, the earls of War∣wick, Southampton, and Arundel, with five counsellors more, met at Ely-House; and as∣suming to themselves the whole power of the council, began to act independent of the pro∣tector,<MILESTONE N="Octob. 6. 1549."/> whom they pretended to consider as the author of every public grievance. They wrote letters to the chief nobility and gentry of England, informing them of the present measures, and requiring their assistance. They sent for the mayor and aldermen of London, and enjoined them to concur in their measures, which they represented as the only means of saving the nation. The next day several others of the council joined the seceding members; and the protector now began to tremble, not for his authority, but his life.</P>
<P>He had no sooner been informed of these transactions, than he sent the king to Windsor, and armed the inhabitants of Hampton and Windsor also for his security. But finding that no man of rank, except Cranmer and Paget, adhered to him, and that the people did not rise at his summons, perceiving that he was in a manner deserted by all, and that all resistance was fruitless, he resolved to apply to his enemies for pardon. This gave fresh strength and confidence to the par∣ty
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
of Warwick; they assured the king, with the humblest professions of obedience, that their only aim was to put the council on the same footing on which it had been ordained by the will of their late sovereign, and to rescue his authority from the hands of a man who had assumed all power to himself. The king, who never much cared for Somerset, gave their ad∣dress a favourable reception; and the protec∣tor was sent to the Tower, with some of his friends and partizans, among whom was Cecil, afterwards earl of Salisbury. Mean while the council ordered six lords to act as governors to the king, two at a time officiating alternate∣ly. It was then, for the first time, that the earl of Warwick's ambition began to appear in full splendour; he set himself forward as the prin∣cipal promoter of the protector's ruin, and the other members, without the least opposition, permitted him to assume the reins of govern∣ment.</P>
<P>It was now supposed that Somerset's fate was fixed, as his enemies were numerous, and the charges against him of the most heinous nature. The chief article of which he was accused, was his usurpation of the govern∣ment, and the taking all power into his own hands; several others of a slighter tint were
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
added to invigorate this accusation, but none of them could be said to amount to the crime of high treason. In consequence of these, a bill of attainder was preferred against him in the house of lords; but Somerset contrived, for this time, to elude the rigour of their sen∣tence, by having previously, on his knees, confessed the charge before the members of the council. This confession, which he sign∣ed with his own hand, was alleged and read against him at the bar of the house, who once more sent a deputation to him, to know whe∣ther the confession was voluntary or extorted. Somerset thanked them for their candour; owned that it was his voluntary act, but stre∣nuously insisted, that he had never harboured a sinister thought against the king or the com∣monwealth. In consequence of this confes∣sion, he was deprived of all his offices and goods, together with a great part of his landed estate, which was forfeited to the use of the crown. This fine on his estate was soon after remitted by the king, and Somerset once more, contrary to the expectation of all, recovered his liberty. He was even re-admitted into the council; happy for him, if his ambition had not revived with his security.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25"/>The catholics were extremely elevated at the protector's fall; and they began to enter∣tain hopes of a revolution in their favour. But they were mistaken in their opinion of Warwick, who now took the lead, as ambi∣tion was the only principle in his breast; and to that he was resolved to sacrifice all others. He soon gave instances of his disregard in reli∣gious points, by his permitting Gardiner to un∣dergo the penalties prescribed against disobe∣dience. Many of the prelates, and he among the rest, though they made some compliances, were still addicted to their ancient communion. A resolution was therefore taken to deprive them of their sees; and it was thought proper to begin with him, in order to strike a terror into the rest. He had been now for two years in prison, for having refused to inculcate the duty of obedience to the king during his mi∣nority; and the council took this opportunity to send him several articles to subscribe, a∣mong which was one, acknowleging the jus∣tice of the order for his confinement. He was likewise to own, that the king was supreme head of the church; that the power of mak∣ing and dispensing holidays was a part of the prerogative; and that the Common Prayer Book was a godly and commendable form. Gar∣diner
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
was willing to put his hand to all the articles, except that by which he accused him∣self, which he refused to do, justly perceiving that their aim was either to ruin or dishonour him. For this offence he was deprived of his bishopric, committed to close custody; his books and papers were seized; all company was denied him; and he was not even per∣mitted the use of pen and ink. This severity, in some measure, countenanced those which this prelate had afterwards an opportunity of retaliating when he came into power.</P>
<P>But the reformers did not stop here: the rapacious courtiers, never to be satisfied, and giving their violence an air of zeal, deprived, in the same manner, Day, bishop of Chichester, Heathe of Worcester, and Voisy of Exeter. The bishops of Landaff, Salisbury, and Co∣ventry came off something more advantage∣ously, by sacrificing the most considerable share of their ecclesiastical revenues. Not only the revenues of the church, but the libraries also, underwent a dreadful scrutiny. The libraries of Westminster and Oxford were ordered to be ransacked, and purged of the Romish missals, legends, and other superstitious vo∣lumes; in which search great devastation was made even in useful literature. Many vo∣lumes
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
clasped in silver were destroyed for the sake of their rich bindings; many of geo∣metry and astronomy were supposed to be ma∣gical, and met no mercy. The university, unable to stop the fury of these barbarians, silently looked on, and trembled for its own security.</P>
<P>Warwick was willing to indulge the nobi∣lity with these humiliations of the church; and perceiving that the king was extremely attached to the reformation, he supposed that he could not make his court to the young monarch better than by a seeming zeal in the cause. But he was still stedfastly bent on en∣larging his own power; and as the last earl of Northumberland died without issue or heirs, Warwick procured for himself a grant of his ample possessions, and obtained the title also of duke of Northumberland. The duke of Somerset was now the only person he wish∣ed to have entirely removed; for though fallen as he was by his late spiritless conduct, yet he still preserved a share of popularity that rendered him formidable to this aspirer. In∣deed Somerset was not always upon his guard against the arts of Northumberland; but could not help now and then bursting out into invectives, which were quickly carried to his
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
secret enemy. As he was surrounded by Northumberland's creatures, they took care to reveal all the designs which they had them∣selves first suggested; and Somerset soon found the fatal effects of his rival's resentment. He was, by Northumberland's command, arrested with many more, accused of being his partizans; and he was, with his wife the dutchess, also thrown into prison. He was now accused of having formed a design to raise an insurrection in the North; of attacking the train-bands on a mus∣ter day; of plotting to secure the Tower, and to excite a rebellion in London. These charges he strenuously denied; but he con∣fessed to one of as heinous a nature, which was, that he had laid a project for murdering Northumberland, Northampton, and Pem∣broke, at a banquet, which was to be given them by lord Paget. He was soon after brought to a trial before the marquis of Win∣chester, who sat as high-steward on the occa∣sion, with twenty-seven peers more, including Northumberland, Pembroke, and Northamp∣ton, who were at once his judges and accusers. He was accused with an intention to secure the person of the king, and re-assume the ad∣ministration of affairs, to assassinate the duke of Northumberland, and raise an insurrection
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
in the city. He pleaded not guilty to the first part of the charge, and of this he was accord∣ingly acquitted; but he was found guilty of conspiring the death of a privy-counsellor, which crime had been made felony in the reign of Henry the seventh; and for this he was condemned to be hanged. The populace see∣ing him re-conveyed to the Tower without the ax, which was no longer carried before him, imagined that he had been entirely ac∣quitted; and in repeated shouts and acclama∣tions manifested their joy; but this was sud∣denly damped, when they were better inform∣ed of his doom. Care in the mean time had been taken to prepossess the young king a∣gainst his uncle; and lest he should relent, no access was given to any of Somerset's friends, while the prince was kept from reflection by a series of occupations and amusements. At last the prisoner was brought to the scaffold on Tower-hill, where he appeared, without the least emotion, in the midst of a vast con∣course of the populace, by whom he was belov∣ed. He spoke to them with great composure, protesting that he had always promoted the ser∣vice of his king, and the interests of true re∣ligion, to the best of his power. The people attested their belief of what he said, by cry∣ing
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
out, <Q REND="inline">"It is most true."</Q> An universal tumult was beginning to take place; but So∣merset desiring them to be still, and not to in∣terrupt his last meditations, but to join with him in prayer, he laid down his head, and submitted to the stroke of the executioner. Sir Ralph Vane, and Sir Miles Partridge, were hanged; and Sir Michael Stanhope, with Sir Thomas Arundel, were beheaded, as being his accom∣plices.</P>
<P>Nothing could have been more unpopular than the measure of destroying Somerset, who, though many actions of his life were very ex∣ceptionable, yet still consulted the good of the people. The house of commons was parti∣cularly attached to him; and of this Northum∣berland was very sensible. He therefore re∣solved to dissolve that parliament, and call another that would be more obsequious to his will. For this purpose he engaged the king to write circular letters to all the sheriffs, in which he enjoined them to chuse such men as he and the privy-council should recommend. With this despotic mandate the sheriffs im∣mediately complied; and the members return∣ed, fully answered Northumberland's expecta∣tions. He had long aimed at the first autho∣rity; and the infirm state of the king's health
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
opened the prospects to his ambition. He represented to that young prince that his sisters Mary and Elizabeth, who were appointed by Henry's will to succeed in failure of direct heirs to the crown, had been both declared il∣legitimate by parliament; that the queen of Scots, his aunt, stood excluded by the king's will, and being an alien also, lost all right of succeeding; that as the three princesses were thus legally excluded, the succession naturally devolved to the marchioness of Dorset, whose next heir was the lady Jane Grey, a lady every way accomplished for government, as well by the charms of her person, as the virtues and acquirements of her mind. The king, who had long submitted to all the politic views of this designing minister, agreed to have the succession submitted to council, where Nor∣thumberland hoped to procure an easy concur∣rence.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as the king's health decli∣ned, the minister laboured to strengthen his own interests and connexions. His first aim was to secure the interests of the marquis of Dorset, father to Lady Jane Gray, by procu∣ring for him the title of duke of Suffolk, which was lately become extinct. Having thus obliged this nobleman, he then proposed
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
a match between his fourth son, lord Guilford Dudley, and the lady Jane Gray, whose inte∣rests he had been at so much pains to advance. Still bent on spreading his interests as widely as possible,<MILESTONE N="1553" UNIT="A.D."/> he married his own daughter to lord Hastings; and had these marriages solem∣nized with all possible pomp and festivity. Mean while, Edward continued to languish; and several fatal symptoms of a consumption began to appear. It was hoped, however, that his youth and temperance might get the better of his disorders; and from their love the people were unwilling to think him in danger. It had been remarked indeed by some, that his health was visibly seen to decline, from the time that the Dudleys were brought about his person. The character of Northumberland might have justly given some colour to suspi∣cion; and his removing all, except his own emissaries, from about the king, still farther encreased the distrusts of the people. Nor∣thumberland, however, was no way uneasy at their mumurs; he was assiduous in his at∣tendance upon the king, and professed the most anxious concern for his safety; but still drove forward his darling scheme of transfer∣ring the succession to his own daughter-in-law. The judges who were appointed to draw up
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
the king's letters patent for that purpose, warmly objected to the measure; and gave their reasons before the council. They begged that a parliament might be summoned, both to give it force, and to free its partizans from danger; they said, that the form was invalid, and would not only subject the judges who drew it, but every counsellor who signed it, to the pains of treason. Northumberland could not brook their demurs; he threatened them with the dread of his authority; he called one of them a traitor, and said, that he would fight in his shirt with any man on so just a cause, as that of the lady Jane's succession. A method was therefore found out of screening the judges from danger, by granting them the king's pardon for what they should draw up; and at length, after much deliberation, and some re∣fusals, the patent for changing the succession was completed. Thus, by this patent, Mary and Elizabeth were set aside; and the crown was settled on the heirs of the dutchess of Suf∣folk, for the dutchess herself was contented to forego her claim.</P>
<P>Northumberland having thus far succeeded, thought physicians were no longer serviceable in the king's complaint; they were dismissed by his advice; and Edward was put into the hands
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
of an ignorant woman, who very confidently undertook his cure. After the use of her me∣dicines, all the bad symptons encreased to a most violent degree; he felt a difficulty of speech and breathing; his pulse failed, his legs swelled, his colour became livid, and many other symptoms appeared of his approaching end. He expired at Greenwich, in the six∣teenth year of his age, and the seventh of his reign, greatly regretted by all, as his early vir∣tues gave a prospect of the continuance of an happy reign.<MILESTONE N="July 6, 1553."/> What were the real qualities of this young prince's heart there was no time to discover; but the cultivation of his understan∣ding, if we may credit historians, was amazing. He was said to understand the Greek, Latin, French, Italian, and Spanish languages. He was versed in logic, music, natural philosophy, and theology. Cardan, the extraordinary scho∣lar and visionary, happening to pay a visit to the English court, was so astonished at his early progress, that he extols him as a prodigy of nature. It is probable, however, that so much flattery as he received would have con∣tributed to corrupt him, as it had formerly corrupted his father.</P>

<P>THE death of Edward only served to prepare fresh troubles for a people that had hitherto greatly suffered from the depravity of their kings, or the turbulence of their nobili∣ty. The succession to the throne had hitherto been obtained partly by lineal descent, and partly by the aptitude for government in the person chosen. Neither quite hereditary, nor
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
quite elective, it had made ancestry the pretext of right, while the consent of the people was necessary to support all hereditary pretensions. In fact, when wisely conducted, this is the best species of succession that can be conceiv∣ed, as its prevents that aristocracy, which is ever the result of a government entirely elec∣tive; and that tyranny, which is too often esta∣blished, where there is never an infringement on hereditary claims.</P>
<P>Whenever a monarch of England happened to be arbitrary, and to enlarge the prerogative, he generally considered the kingdom as his property, and not himself as a servant of the people. In such cases it was natural for him at his decease to bequeath his dominions as he thought proper, making his own will the stan∣dard of his subjects' happiness. Henry the eighth, in conformity to this practice, made his will, in which he settled the succession mere∣ly according to his caprice. In that, Edward his son was the first nominated to succeed him; then Mary, his eldest daughter, by Catharine of Spain; but with a special mark of conde∣scension, by which he would intimate her ille∣gitimacy. The next that followed was Eli∣zabeth, his daughter by Anne Bullen, with the same marks, intimating her illegitimacy
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
also. After his own children, his sister's chil∣dren were mentioned; his younger sister the dutchess of Suffolk's issue were preferred before those of their elder sister the queen of Scotland, which preference was thought by all to be neither founded in justice, nor supported by reason. This will was now, however, set aside by the intrigues of Northumberland, by whose advice a will was made, as we have seen; in fa∣vour of lady Jane Gray, the dutchess of Suf∣folk's daughter, in prejudice of all other clai∣mants. Thus, after the death of this young monarch, there were no fewer than four prin∣cesses who could assert their pretensions to the crown. Mary, who was the first upon Henry's will, but who had been declared illegitimate by an act of parliament, which was never repealed. Elizabeth was next to succeed, and though she had been declared illegitimate, yet she had been restored to her rights during her father's life-time. The queen of Scotland, Henry's eldest sister, was first in right, supposing the two daugh∣ters illegitimate, while lady Jane Gray might alledge the will of the late king in her own favour.</P>
<P>Of these, however, only two put in their pretensions to the crown. Mary relying on the justice of her cause, and lady Jane
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
upon the support of the duke of Northumber∣land, her father-in-law. Mary was strongly bigotted to the popish superstitions, having been bred up among church-men, and hav∣ing been even taught to prefer martyrdom to a denial of belief. As she had lived in continual restraint, she was reserved and gloomy; she had, even during the life of her father, the resolution to maintain her sentiments, and re∣fused to comply with his new institutions. Her zeal had rendered her furious; and she was not only blindly attached to her religious opi∣nions, but even to the popish clergy who main∣tained them. On the other hand, Jane Gray was strongly attached to the reformers; and though yet but sixteen, her judgment had at∣tained to such a degree of maturity, as few have been found to possess. All historians agree that the solidity of her understanding, improv∣ed by continual application, rendered her the wonder of her age. Ascham, tutor to Elizabeth, informs us, that coming once to wait upon lady Jane at her father's house in Leicestershire, he found her reading Plato's works in Greek, while all the rest of the fami∣ly were hunting in the Park. Upon his tes∣tifying his surprize at her situation, she assured him that Plato was an higher amusement to
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
her than the most studied refinements of sen∣sual pleasure; and she, in fact, seemed born for philosophy, and not for ambition.</P>
<P>Such were the present rivals for power; but lady Jane had the start of her antagonist. Nor∣thumberland now resolving to secure the suc∣cession, carefully concealed the death of Ed∣ward, in hope of securing the person of Mary, who, by an order of council, had been requir∣ed to attend her brother during his illness; but being informed of his death, she immediately prepared to assert her pretensions to the crown. This crafty minister, therefore, finding that farther dissimulation was needless, went to Sion-house, acccompanied by the duke of Suffolk, the earl of Pembroke, and others of the nobility, to salute lady Jane Gray, who resided there. Jane was in a great measure ignorant of all these transactions; and it was with equal grief and surprize that she received intelligence of them. She shed a flood of tears, appeared inconsolable, and it was not without the utmost difficulty that she yielded to the entreaties of Northumberland, and the duke her father. At length, however, they exhorted her to consent, and next day conveyed her to the Tower, where it was then usual for the kings of England to pass some days after
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
their accession. Thither also all the members of the council were obliged to attend her; and thus were in some measure made prisoners by Northumberland, whose will they were under a necessity of obeying. Orders were given al∣so for proclaiming her throughout the king∣dom; but these were but very remissly obey∣ed. When she was proclaimed in the city, the people heard her accession made public without any signs of pleasure, no applause en∣sued, and some even expressed their scorn and contempt.</P>
<P>In the mean time Mary, who had retired, upon the news of the king's death, to Kenning-Hall in Norfolk, sent circular letters to all the great towns and nobility in the kingdom, re∣minding them of her right, and commanding them to proclaim her without delay. Having taken these steps, she retired to Framlingham-Castle in Suffolk, that she might be near the sea, and escape to Flanders in case of failure. But she soon found her affairs wear the most promising aspect. The men of Suffolk came to pay her their homage; and being as∣sured by her, that she would defend the laws and the religion of her predecessor, they en∣listed themselves in her cause with alacrity and affection. The people of Norfolk soon
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
after came in; the earls of Bath, and Suffex, the eldest sons of lord Wharton, and lord Mor∣daunt joined her; and lord Hastings, with four thousand men, which were raised to op∣pose her, revolted to her side. Even a fleet that had been sent to lie off the coast of Suf∣folk to prevent her escaping, engaged in her service; and now, but too late, Northumber∣land saw the deplorable end of all his schemes and ambition.</P>
<P>This minister, with the consent of the coun∣cil, had assembled some troops at Newmarket, had set on foot new levies in London, and ap∣pointed the duke of Suffolk general of the army, that he might himself continue with, and overawe the deliberations of the council. But he was turned from this manner of managing his affairs, by considering how unfit Suffolk was to head the army; so that he was obliged himself to take upon him the military command. It was now, therefore, that the council being free from his influence, and no longer dreading his imme∣diate authority, began to declare against him. Arundel led the opposition, by represent∣ing the injustice and cruelty of Northumber∣land, and the exorbitancy of his ambition. Pembroke seconded him with declarations, that he was ready to fight all of a contrary opi∣nion;
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
the mayor and aldermen, who were sent for, readily came into the same measures; the people expressed their approbation by shouts and applauses; and even Suffolk himself, find∣ing all resistance fruitless, threw open the gates of the Tower, and joined in the general cry. Mary's claims now became irresistible, in a little time she found herself at the head of forty thousand men; while the few who at∣tended Northumberland, continued irresolute; and he even feared to lead them to the en∣counter.</P>
<P>Lady Jane, thus finding that all was lost, resigned her royalty, which she had held but ten days, with marks of real satisfaction, and retired with her mother to their own habita∣tion. Northumberland, also, who found his affairs desperate, and that it was impossible to stem the tide of popular opposition, attempted to quit the kingdom; but he was prevented by the band of pensioner guards, who inform∣ed him that he must stay to justify their con∣duct in being led out against their lawful sove∣reign. Thus circumvented on all sides, his cunning was now his only resource; and he began by endeavouring to recommend himself to Mary, by the most extravagant protesta∣tions of zeal in her service. He repaired to
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
the market-place in Cambridge, and proclaim∣ing her queen of England, was the first to throw up his cap in token of joy. But he reaped no advantage from this mean duplicity; he was the next day arrested in the queen's name by the earl of Arundel, at whose feet he fell upon his knees, begging protection with the most abject submission. His three sons, his brother, and some more of his followers were arrested with him, and com∣mitted to the Tower of London. Soon after, the lady Jane Gray, the duke of Suffolk her father, and lord Guildford Dudley her hus∣band, were made prisoners by order of the queen, whose authority was now confirmed by universal assent.</P>
<P>Northumberland was the first who suf∣fered for opposing her, and was the person who deserved punishment the most. When brought to his trial, he openly desired permis∣sion to ask two questions of the peers, who were appointed to sit on his jury; <Q REND="inline">"Whether a man could be guilty of treason, who obeyed orders given him by the council under the great seal? and, whether those who were involv∣ed in the same guilt with himself, could act as his judges?"</Q> Being told that the great seal of an usurper was no authority; and that his
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
judges were proper, as they were unimpeached, he acquiesced, and pleaded guilty. At his execution, he owned himself a papist; and ex∣horted the people to return to the catholic faith, as they hoped for happiness and tran∣quility. Sir John Gates, and Sir Thomas Palmer, two infamous tools of his power, suf∣fered with him; and the queen's resentment was appeased by the lives of three men, who had forfeited them by several former crimes. Sen∣tence was pronounced against lady Jane, and lord Guildford, but without any intention for the present of putting it in execution; the youth and innocence of the persons, neither of whom had reached their seventeenth year, pleaded powerfully in their favour.</P>
<P>Mary now entered London, and with very little effusion of blood, saw herself joyfully proclaimed, and peaceably settled on the throne. This was the crisis of British happi∣ness; a queen whose right was the most equit∣able, in some measure elected by the people, the aristocracy of the last reign almost wholly suppressed, the house of commons by this means reinstated in its ancient authority, the pride of the clergy humbled, and their vices detected, peace abroad, and unanimity at home. This was the flattering prospect of Mary's ac∣cession,
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
but soon this pleasing phantom was dissolved. Mary was morose, and a bigot; she was resolved to give back their former power to the clergy; and thus once more to in∣volve the kingdom in all the horrors it had just emerged from. The queen had promised the men of Suffolk, who first came to declare in her favour, that she would suffer religion to remain in the situation in which she found it. This promise, however, she by no means intend∣ed to perform; she had determined on bring∣ing the sentiments of the people to correspond with her own; and her extreme ignorance rendered her utterly incapable of doubting her own belief, or of granting indulgence to the doubts of others. Gardiner, Bonner, Tonstal, Day, Heath, and Vesey, who had been con∣fined, or suffered losses for their catholic opi∣nions, during the late reigns, were taken from prison, re-instated in their sees, and their for∣mer sentences repealed. On pretence of dis∣couraging controversy, she silenced, by her prerogative, all preachers throughout Eng∣land, except such as should obtain a particu∣lar licence; which she was previously deter∣mined to grant only to those of her own per∣suasion. Men now, therefore, foresaw that the Reformation was to be overturned; and though
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
the queen still pretended that she would grant a general toleration, yet no great favour could be expected by those who were hateful to her from inveterate prejudices.</P>
<P>The first steps that caused an alarm among the protestants, was the severe treatment of Cranmer, whose moderation, integrity, and vir∣tues, had made him dear, even to most of the catholic party. A report being spread, that this prelate, in order to make his court to the queen, had promised to officiate in the Latin service, he drew up a declaration, in which he entirely cleared himself of the asper∣sion indeed, but incurred what was much more terrible, the queen's resentment. On the pub∣lication of this paper, Cranmer was thrown into prison, and tried for the part he had act∣ed, in concurring among the rest of the coun∣cil, to exalt lady Jane, and set aside the right∣ful sovereign. This guilt he had in fact in∣curred; but as it was shared with a large body of men, most of whom were not only uncen∣sured, but even taken into favour; the malig∣nanty of the prosecution was easily seen through. Sentence of high treason was, therefore, pro∣nounced against him; but it was not then exe∣cuted, as this venerable man was reserved for a more dreadful punishment. Shortly after,
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
Peter Martyr, a German reformer, who had in the late reign been invited over to England, seeing how things were likely to go, desired leave to return to his native country. But the zeal of the catholics, though he had escap∣ed them, was malignantly, though harmlessly, wrecked upon the body of his wife, which had been interred some years before at Oxford. It was dug up by public order, and buried in a dunghill.<MILESTONE N="159" UNIT="A.D."/> The bones also of Bucer and Fa∣gius, two foreign reformers, were about the same time committed to the flames at Cam∣bridge. The greater part of the foreign pro∣testants, took early precautions to leave the kingdom; and many of the arts and manu∣factures, which they successfully advanced, fled with them. Nor were their fears without foundation; a parliament, which the queen called soon after, seemed willing to concur in all her measures; they at one blow repealed all the statutes with regard to religion, which had passed during the reign of her predecessor: so that the national religion was again placed on the same footing, on which it stood at the death of Henry the eighth.</P>
<P>While religion was thus returning to its primitive abuses, the queen's ministers, who were willing to strengthen her power by a ca∣tholic
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
alliance, had been for some time look∣ing out for a proper consort. The person on whom her own affections seemed chiefly placed was the earl of Devonshire; but that noble∣man either disliking her person, or having al∣ready placed his affections on her sister Eliza∣beth, neglected all overtures to such an alli∣ance. Cardinal Pole, who, though invested with that ecclesiastical dignity, was still a lay∣man, and a person of high character for vir∣tue, generosity, and attachment to the catho∣lic religion, was next thought of. But as he was in the decline of life, the queen soon dropped all thoughts of him. The person last thought of, and who succeeded, was Phi∣lip, prince of Spain, and son of the celebrated Charles the fifth. In order to avoid as much as possible any disagreeable remonstrances from the people, the articles of marriage were drawn as favourably as possible to the interests and honour of England; and this in some mea∣sure stilled the clamours that had already been begun against it. It was agreed, that though Philip should have the title of king, the ad∣ministration should be entirely in the queen; that no foreigner should be capable of enjoy∣ing any office in the kingdom; that no inno∣vation should be made in the English laws,
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
customs, and privileges; that her issue should inherit, together with England, Burgundy, and the Low Countries; and that if Don Carlos, Philip's son by a former marriage, should die, the queen's issue should then enjoy all the dominions possessed by the king. Such was the treaty of marriage, from which poli∣ticians foresaw very great changes in the system of Europe; but which in the end came to nothing, by the queen's having no issue.</P>
<P>The people, however, who did not see so far, were much more just in their surmises, who saw that it might be a blow to their li∣berties and religion. They loudly murmured against it, and a flame of discontent was kindled over the whole nation. Sir Thomas Wyatt, a Roman catholic, at the head of four thousand insurgents, marched from Kent to Hyde Park, publishing, as he went forward, a declaration against the queen's evil counsel∣lors, and against the Spanish match. His first aim was to secure the Tower; <MILESTONE N="1554" UNIT="A.D."/> but his rashness undid him. As he marched forward through the city of London, and among the narrow streets without suspicion, care was taken by the earl of Pembroke to block up the way behind him by ditches and chains thrown a∣cross, and guards placed at all the avenves to
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
prevent his return. In this manner did this bold demagogue pass onward, and sup∣posed himself now ready to reap the fruits of his undertaking, when, to his utter confusion, he found that he could neither go forward, nor yet make good his retreat. He now, therefore, perceived that the citizens, from whom he had expected assistance, would not join him; and losing all courage in this exigency, he surrendered at discretion.</P>
<P>The duke of Suffolk was not less guilty also; he had been joined in a confederacy with Sir Peter Carew, to make an insurrection in the counties of Kent, Warwick, and Leices∣ter; but his confederate's impatience engaging him to rise in arms before the day appointed, Suffolk vainly endeavoured to excite his de∣pendants; but was so closely pursued by the earl of Huntingdon, that he was obliged to disperse his followers; and being discovered in his retreat was led prisoner to London, where he, together with Wyatt, and seventy persons more, suffered by the hand of the exe∣cutioner. Four hundred were conducted be∣fore the queen with ropes about their necks; and falling on their knees received pardon, and were dismissed.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="51"/>But what excited the compassion of the peo∣ple most of all, was the execution of lady Jane Gray, and her husband lord Guilford Dudley, who were involved in the punishment, though not in the guilt, of this insurrection. Two days after Wyatt was apprehended, lady Jane and her husband were ordered to prepare for death. Lady Jane, who had long before seen the threatened blow, was no way sur∣prised at the message, but bore it with heroic resolution; and being informed that she had three days to prepare, she seemed displeased at so long a delay. On the day of her execu∣tion her husband desired permission to see her; but this she refused, as she knew the parting would be too tender for her fortitude to with∣stand. The place at first designed for their execution was without the Tower; but their youth, beauty, and innocence being likely to raise an insurrection among the people, orders were given that they should be executed with∣in the verge of the Tower. Lord Dudley was the first that suffered; and while the lady Jane was conducting to the place of execu∣tion, the officers of the Tower met her, bear∣ing along the headless body of her husband streaming with blood, in order to be inter∣red in the Tower-chapel. She looked on
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
the corpse for some time without any emo∣tion; and then, with a sigh, desired them to proceed. John Gage, constable of the Tower, as he led her to execution, desired her to be∣stow on him some small present, which he might keep as a perpetual memorial of her. She gave him her tablets, where she had just written three sentences on seeing her husband's dead body, one in Greek, one in Latin, and one in English, importing, that she hoped God and posterity would do him and their cause justice. On the scaffold she made a speech, in which she alledged that her offence was not the having laid her hand upon the crown, but the not rejecting it with sufficient constancy; that she had less erred through ambition than filial obedience; that she wil∣lingly accepted death as the only atonement she could make to the injured state; and was ready by her punishment to shew, that in∣nocence is no plea in excuse for deeds that tend to injure the community. After speak∣ing to this effect, she caused herself to be dis∣robed by her women, and with a steady serene countenance submitted to the executioner.</P>
<P>The enemies of the state being thus sup∣pressed, the theatre was now opened for the pretended enemies of religion. The queen
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
being freed from apprehensions of an insurrec∣tion, began by assembling a parliament, which upon this, as upon most occasions, seemed only met to give countenance to her various severities. The nobles, whose only religion was that of the prince who governed, were easily gained over; and the house of commons had long been passive under all the variations of regal caprice. But there was a new enemy started up against the reformers in the person of the king, who, though he took all possible care to conceal his aversion, yet secretly influ∣enced the queen, and enflamed all her pro∣ceedings. Philip had for some time been come over; and had used every endeavour to encrease that share of power which he had been allowed by parliament, but without ef∣fect. The queen, indeed, who loved him with a foolish fondness that sat but ill on a person of her years and disagreeable person, endea∣voured to please him by every concession she could make or procure; and finding herself incapable of satisfying his ambition, she was not remiss in concurring with his zeal; so that heretics began to be persecuted with inquisi∣torial severity.<MILESTONE N="1554" UNIT="A.D."/> The old sanguinary laws were now revived, which had been rejected by a former parliament. Orders were given that
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
the bishops and priests who had married should be ejected, that the mass should be restored, that the pope's authority should be established, and that the church and its privileges, all but their goods and estates, should be put upon the same foundation on which they were be∣fore the commencement of the reformation. As the gentry and nobles had already divided the church-lands among them, it was thought inconvenient, and indeed impossible, to make a restoration of these.</P>
<P>At the head of those who drove such mea∣sures forward were Gardiner, bishop of Win∣chester, and cardinal Pole, who was now re∣turned from Italy. Pole, who was nearly al∣lied by birth to the royal family, had al∣ways conscientiously adhered to the catholic religion, and had incurred Henry's displea∣sure, not only by refusing his assent to his mea∣sures, but by writing against him. It was for this adherence that he was cherished by the pope, and now sent over to England as legate from the holy see. Gardiner was a man of a very different character; his chief aim was to please the reigning prince, and he had shewn already many instances of his prudent confor∣mity. He now perceived that the king and queen were for rigorous measures; and he
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
knew that it would be the best means of pay∣ing his court to them, even to out-go them in severity. Pole, who had never varied in his principles, declared in favour of toleration; Gardiner, who had often changed, was for punishing those changes in others with the ut∣most rigour. However, he was too prudent to appear at the head of a persecution in per∣son; he therefore consigned that odious of∣fice to Bonner, bishop of London, a cruel, brutal, and ignorant man.</P>
<P>This bloody scene began by the martyrdom of Hooper, bishop of Gloucester, and Ro∣gers, prebendary of St. Paul's. They were examined by commissioners appointed by the queen, with the chancellor at the head of them. It was expected by their recantation that they would bring those opinions into dis∣repute which they had so long inculcated; but the persecutors were deceived; they both con∣tinued stedfast in their belief, and they were accordingly condemned to be burnt, Rogers in Smithfield, and Hooper in his own diocese at Gloucester. Rogers, beside the care of his own preservation, lay under very power∣ful temptations to deny his principles, and save his life, for he had a wife whom he ten∣derly loved, and ten children; but nothing
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
could move his resolution. Such was his se∣renity after condemnation, that the jailors, we are told, waked him from a sound sleep upon the approach of the hour appointed for his execution. He desired to see his wife before he died; but Gardiner told him that being a priest he could have no wife. When the fag∣gots were placed around him, he seemed no way daunted at the preparation; but cried out,

When Hooper was tied to the stake a stool was set before him with the queen's pardon upon it, in case he should relent; but he ordered it to be re∣moved, and prepared chearfully to suffer his sentence, which was executed in its full se∣verity. The fire, either from malice or ne∣glect, had not been sufficiently kindled; so that his legs and thighs were first burned, and one of his hands dropped off, while with the other he continued to beat his breast. He was three quarters of an hour in torture, which he bore with inflexible constancy.</P>
<P>Sanders and Taylor, two other clergymen, whose zeal had been distinguished in carrying on the reformation, were the next that suf∣fered. Taylor was put into a pitch-barrel; and before the fire was kindled, a faggot from
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
an unknown hand was thrown at his head, which made it stream with blood. Still, how∣ever, he continued undaunted singing the thirty-first psalm in English, which one of the spectators observing, struck him a blow on the side of the head, and commanded him to pray in Latin. Taylor continued a few mi∣nutes silent with his eyes stedfastly fixed up∣ward, when one of the guards, either through impatience or compassion, struck him down with his halbert, and thus happily put an end to his torments.</P>
<P>The death of these only served to encrease the savage appetite of the popish bishops and monks, for fresh slaughter. Bonner, bloated at once with rage and luxury, let loose his vengeance without restraint; and seemed to take a pleasure in the pains of the unhappy sufferers; while the queen, by her letters, ex∣horted him to pursue the pious work without pity or interruption. Soon after, in obe∣dience to her commands, Ridley, bishop of London; and the venerable Latimer, bishop of Worcester, were condemned together. Rid∣ley had been one of the ablest champions for the reformation; his piety, learning, and soli∣dity of judgment, were admired by his friends, and dreaded by his enemies. The night be∣fore
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
his execution, he invited the mayor of Ox∣ford and his wife to see him; and when he beheld them melted into tears, he himself ap∣peared quite unmoved, inwardly supported and comforted in that hour of agony. When he was brought to the stake to be burnt, he found his old friend Latimer there before him. Of all the prelates of that age, Latimer was the most remarkable for his unaffected piety, and the simplicity of his manners. He had never learned to flatter in courts; and his open re∣buke was dreaded by all the great, who at that time too much deserved it. His sermons, which remain to this day, shew that he had much learning, and much wit; and there is an air of sincerity running through them, not to be found elsewhere. When Ridley began to comfort his ancient friend; Latimer, on his part, was as ready to return the kind office. <Q REND="inline">"Be of good cheer, brother, cried he, we shall this day kindle such a torch in England, as I trust in God, shall never be extinguished."</Q> A furious bigot ascended to preach to them and the people, while the fire was preparing; and Rid∣ley gave a most serious attention to his dis∣course. No way distracted by the prepara∣tions about him, he heard him to the last; and then told him, that he was ready to answer all
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
that he had preached upon, if he were permitted a short indulgence; but this was refused him. At length fire was set to the pile: Latimer was soon out of pain, but Ridley continued to suffer much longer, his legs being consumed before the fire reached his vitals.</P>
<P>One Thomas Haukes, when conducted to the stake, had agreed with his friends, that if he found the torture supportable, he would make them a signal for that purpose in the midst of the flames. His zeal for the cause in which he suffered was so strong, that when the spectators thought him near expiring, by stretching out his arms, he gave his friends the signal that the pain was not too great to be borne. This example, with many others of the like constancy, encouraged multitudes not only to suffer, but even to aspire after mar∣tyrdom.</P>
<P>But women seemed persecuted with as much severity even as men. A woman in Guernsey, condemned for heresy, was delivered of a child in the midst of the flames. Some of the spec∣tators, humanely ran to snatch the infant from danger; but the magistrate, who was a papist, ordered it to be flung in again, and there it was consumed with the mother.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="60"/>Cranmer's death followed soon after, and struck the whole nation with horror. This prelate, whom we have seen acting so very conspicuous a part in the reformation, during the two preceding reigns, had been long de∣tained a prisoner, in consequence of his imput∣ed guilt in obstructing the queen's succession to the crown. But it was now resolved to bring him to punishment; and to give it all its ma∣lignity, the queen ordered that he should be punished for heresy, rather than for treason. He was accordingly cited by the pope, to stand his trial at Rome; and though he was kept a prisoner at Oxford, yet upon his not appear∣ing, he was condemned as contumacious. But his enemies were not satisfied with his tortures, without adding to them the poignancy of self-accusation. Persons were, therefore, employed to tempt him by flattery and insinuation; by giving him hopes of once more being received into favour, to sign his recantation, by which he acknowledged the doctrines of the papal supremacy and the real presence. His love of life prevailed. In an unguarded moment he was induced to sign this paper; and now his enemies, as we are told of the devil, after hav∣ing rendered him completely wretched, resolv∣ed to destroy him. But it was determined be∣fore
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
they led him out to execution, that they should try to induce him to make a recanta∣tion in the church before the people. The un∣fortunate prelate, either having a secret inti∣mation of their design, or having once more re∣covered the native vigour of his mind, entered the church, prepared to surprize the whole au∣dience by a contrary declaration. Being placed in a conspicuous part of the church, a sermon was preached by Cole, provost of Eaton, in which he magnified Cranmer's conversion as the immediate work of heaven itself. He as∣sured the archbishop, that nothing could have been so pleasing to God, the queen, or the people; he comforted him, that in case it was thought fit he should suffer, that numberless dirges and masses should be said for his soul; and that his own confession of his faith would still more secure his soul from the pains of purgatory. During this whole rhapsody, Cran∣mer expressed the utmost agony, anxiety, and internal agitation; he lifted up his eyes to heaven, he shed a torrent of tears, and groan∣ed with unutterable anguish. He then began a prayer, filled with the most pathetic expres∣sions of horror and remorse: he then said he was well apprized of his duty to his sove∣reign; but that a superior duty, the duty which
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
he owed his Maker, obliged him to declare that he had signed a paper contrary to his con∣science: that he took this opportunity of at∣toning for his error, by a sincere and open re∣cantation; he was willing, he said, to seal with his blood that doctrine, which he firmly believed to be communicated from heaven; and that as his hand had erred, by betraying his heart, it should undergo the first punishment. The as∣sembly, consisting chiefly of papists, who hoped to triumph in the last words of such a con∣vert, were equally confounded and incensed at this declaration. They called aloud to him to leave off dissembling; and led him forward amidst the insults and reproaches of his au∣dience, to the stake at which Latimer and Rid∣ley had suffered. He was resolved to triumph over their insults by his constancy and forti∣tude; and the fire beginning to be kindled round him, he stretched forth his right-hand, and held it in the flames till it was consum∣ed, while he frequently cried out, in the midst of his suerings, <Q REND="inline">"That unworthy hand;"</Q> at the same time exhibiting no appearance of pain or disorder. When the fire attacked his body, he seemed to be quite insensible of his tortures; his mind was occupied wholly upon the hopes of a future reward. After his body was destroyed, his heart
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
was found entire; an emblem of the constan∣cy with which he suffered.</P>
<P>These persecutions were now become odious to the whole nation; and, as it may be easily supposed, the perpetrators of them were all willing to throw the odium from themselves upon others. Philip, sensible of the hatred which he must incur upon this occasion, endea∣voured to remove the reproach from himself by a very gross artifice. He ordered his con∣fessor to deliver in his presence a sermon in favour of toleration; but Bonner in his turn would not take the whole of the blame, and retorted the severities upon the court. In fact, a bold step was taken to introduce a court similar to that of the Spanish inquisition, that should be empowered to try heretics, and condemn them without any other form of law but its own authority. But even this was thought a method too dilatory in the present exigence of affairs. A proclamation issued against books of heresy, treason, and sedition decla∣red, that whosoever having such books in his possession did not burn them without reading, should be esteemed rebels, and suffer accord∣ingly. This, as might be expected, was at∣tended with bloody effects, whole crowds were executed, till even at last the very magis∣trates,
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
who had been instrumental in these cruelties, at last refused to lend their assistance. It was computed, that during this persecution, two hundred and seventy-seven persons suffer∣ed by fire, besides those punished by imprison∣ment, fines, and confiscations. Among those who suffered by fire were five bishops, twenty-one clergymen, eight lay gentlemen, eighty-four tradesmen, one hundred husbandmen, fifty-five women, and four children.</P>
<P>All this was terrible; and yet the temporal affairs of the kingdom did not seem to be more successful. From Philip's first arrival in England the queen's pregnacy was talked of; and her own extreme desire that it should be true, induced her to favour the report. When Pole, the pope's legate, was first intro∣duced to her, she fancied the child stirred in her womb; and this her flatterers compared to the leaping of John the Baptist in his mo∣ther's belly, at the salutation of the Virgin. The catholics were confident that she was preg∣nant; they were confident that this child should be a son; they were even confident that heaven would render him beautiful, vi∣gorous, and witty. But it soon turned out that all their confidence was ill founded; for the queen's supposed pregnancy was only the
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
beginning of a dropsy, which the disordered state of her health had brought upon her.</P>
<P>This opinion of the queen's pregnancy was all along carefully kept up by Philip, as it was an artifice by which he hoped to extend his authority in the kingdom. But he was mista∣ken: the English parliament, however lax in their principles at that time, harboured a con∣tinual jealousy against him, and passed repeat∣ed acts, by which they ascertained the limits of his power, and confirmed the authority of the queen. Ambition was his only ruling passion; and the extreme fondness of the queen for his person was rather permitted by him than desired. He only wanted to make her inclinations subservient to the purposes of his power; but finding her unable to satisfy him in that hope, he no longer treated her with any return of affection, but behaved to her with apparent indifference and neglect. At length, tired with her importunities and jea∣lousies, and finding his authority extremely limited in England, he took hold of the first opportunity to leave her, and went over to the emperor his father in Flanders. In the mean time, the queen's passion encreased in proportion to the coolness with which it was returned. She passed most of her time
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
in solitude, where she gave vent to her sor∣rows, either by tears or by writing fond epistles to Philip, who, except when he wanted money, seldom returned her any answer. To supply his demands upon these occasions, she took several very extorting methods by loans, which were forced from several whom she thought most affectionate to her person, or best able to spare it. She offered the English merchants at Antwerp fourteen per cent. for a loan of thirty thousand pounds, and yet was mortified by a refusal.</P>
<P>She was more successful in her attempts to engage the English in a war with France, at the instigation of her husband, although in the end it turned out to her utter confusion. A war had just been commenced between Spain and that kingdom; and Philip, who took this occasion to come over to England, declared, that if he were not seconded by England at this crisis, he would never see the country more. This declaration greatly heightened the queen's zeal for promoting his interests; and though she was warmly opposed in this measure by cardinal Pole, and the rest of her council, yet, by threatening to dismiss them all, she at last succeeded. War was declared against France, and preparations were every
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
where made for attacking that kingdom with vigour.<MILESTONE N="1557" UNIT="A.D."/> An army of ten thousand men was raised, and supplied by various methods of ex∣tortion, and sent over into Flanders.</P>
<P>A battle gained by the Spaniards at St. Quintin seemed to promise great success to the allied arms; but soon an action, performed by the duke of Guise in the midst of winter, turn∣ed the scale in favour of France, and affect∣ed, if not the interests, at least the honour of England in the tenderest point. Calais had now for above two hundred years been in possession of the English; it had been made the chief market for wool, and other British com∣modities; it had been strongly fortified at different times, and was then deemed im∣pregnable. But all the fortifications, which were raised before gunpowder was found out, were very ill able to resist the attacks of a re∣gular battery from cannon; and they only continued to enjoy an ancient reputation for strength, which they were very ill able to maintain. Coligny, the French general, had remarked to the duke of Guise, that as the town of Calais was surrounded by marshes, which during winter were impassable, except over a dyke guarded by two castles, St. Aga∣tha and Newnam Bridge; the English were,
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
of late, accustomed, to save expence, to dis∣miss a great part of the garrison at the ap∣proach of winter, and recall them in spring. The duke of Guise upon this, made a sudden and unexpected march towards Calais, and assaulted the castle of St. Agatha with three thousand arquebusiers. The garrison was soon obliged to retreat to their other castle of New∣nam Bridge, and shortly after compelled to quit that post, and to take shelter in the city. Mean while a small fleet was sent to block up the entrance of the harbour; and thus Calais was invested by land and sea. The governor, lord Wentworth, made a brave defence; but his garrison being very weak, they were unable to resist an assault given by the French, who made a lodgement in the castle. On the night following, Wentworth attempted to recover this post; but having lost two hundred men in the attack, he was obliged to capitulate; so that in less than eight days, the duke of Guise recovered a city that had been in possession of the English since the time of Edward the third, and which he had spent eleven months in besieging. This loss filled the whole kingdom with murmurs, and the queen with despair; she was heard to say, that when dead, the name of Calais would be found engraven on her heart.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="69"/>These complicated evils, a murmuring peo∣ple, an encreasing heresy, a disdainful husband, and an unsuccessful war, made dreadful depre∣dations on Mary's constitution. She began to appear consumptive, and this rendered her mind still more morose and bigotted. The people now therefore began to turn their thoughts to her successor; and the princess Elizabeth came into a greater degree of con∣sideration than before. During this whole reign, the nation was in continual apprehen∣sions with regard not only to the succession, but the life of this princess. The violent hatred of the queen broke out upon every occasion; while Elizabeth, conscious of her danger, past her time wholly in reading and study, entirely detached from business. Proposals of marriage had been made to her by the Swedish ambas∣sador, in his master's name; but she referred him to the queen, who leaving it to her own choice, she had the magnanimity to reserve herself for better fortune. Nor was she less prudent in concealing her sentiments of reli∣gion, and in eluding all questions relative to that dangerous subject. She was obnoxious to Mary for two reasons; as she was next heir to the throne, it was feared she might aspire to it during her sister's life-time; but it was
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
still more reasonably apprehended that she would, if ever she came to the crown, make an innovation in that religion, which Mary took such pains to establish. The bishops, who had shed such a deluge of blood, foresaw this; and often told Mary that her destroying meaner heretics was of no advantage to the state, while the body of the tree was suffered to remain. Mary saw and acknowledged the cogency of their arguments, confined her sister with proper guards, and only waited for some fresh insurrection, or some favourable pretext, to destroy her. Her own death prevented the perpetration of her meditated cruelty.</P>
<P>Mary had been long in a very declining state of health; and having mistaken her drop∣sy for a pregnancy, she made use of an impro∣per regimen, which had encreased the disor∣der. Every reflection now tormented her. The consciousness of being hated by her sub∣jects, the prospect of Elizabeth's succession, whom she hated, and, above all, her anxiety for the loss of her husband, who never intend∣ed to return; all these preyed upon her mind, and threw her into a lingering fever, of which she died, after a short and unfortunate reign of five years, four months, and eleven days, in the forty-third year of her age. Cardinal
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
Pole, whose gentleness in power we have of∣ten had occasion to mention, survived her but one day. She was buried in Henry the se∣venth's chapel, according to the rites of the church of Rome.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1558" UNIT="A.D."/> WERE we to adopt the maxim of the catholics themselves, that evil may be done for the production of good, one might say that the persecutions in Mary's reign were permitted only to bring the kingdom more generally over to the protestant religion. No∣thing could preach so effectually against the cruelty and vices of the monks, as the actions
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
of the monks themselves. Wherever heretics were to be burnt, the monks were always pre∣sent, rejoicing at the flames, insulting the fal∣len, and frequently the first to thrust the flam∣ing brand against the faces of the sufferers. The English were effectually converted by such sights as these from their ancient super∣stitions. To bring the people over to any opinion, it is only necessary to persecute, instead of attempting to convince. The peo∣ple had formerly been compelled to embrace the protestant religion, and their fears induced them to conform; but now almost the whole nation were protestants from inclination.</P>
<P>Nothing, therefore, could exceed the joy that was diffused among the people upon the accession of Elizabeth, who now came to the throne without any opposition. She had been at Hatfield, when informed of her sister's death; and, hastening up to London, was re∣ceived by the multitude with universal acclama∣tions. Elizabeth had her education in that best school, the school of adversity; and she had made the proper use of her confinement. Being debarred the enjoyment of pleasures a∣broad, she sought for knowledge at home; she cultivated her understanding, learned the languages and sciences; but of all the arts which she acquired, that of concealing her
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
opinions, of checking her inclinations, of dis∣pleasing none, and of learning to reign, were the most beneficial to her.</P>
<P>This virgin monarch, as some historians have called her, upon entering the Tower according to custom, could not refrain from remarking on the difference of her present, and her former fortune, when she was sent there as a prisoner, and from whence she had so narrowly escaped. She had also been scarce proclaimed queen, when Philip, who had been married to Mary, but who ever testified a partiality in favour of Elizabeth, ordered his ambassador in London, the duke of Feria, to make her proposals of marriage from his master. What political motives Elizabeth might have against this marriage, are not mentioned; but certain it is, that she neither liked the person, nor the religion of her admirer. She was willing at once to enjoy the pleasures of independence, and the vanity of numerous solicitations. But while these were her views, she returned him a very obliging, though evasive answer; and he still retained such hopes of success, that he sent a messen∣ger to Rome, with orders to solicit the dis∣pensation.</P>
<P>Elizabeth had, from the beginning, resolved upon reforming the church, even while she was
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
held in the constraints of a prison; and now, upon coming to the crown, she immediately set about it. But not to alarm the partizans of the catholic religion all at once, she retain∣ed eleven of her sister's council; and, in or∣der to balance their authority, added eight more who were known to be affectionate to the protestant religion. Her particular adviser, however, was Sir William Cecil, secretary of state, a man more earnestly employed in the business than the speculations of the times; and whose temper it was to wish for any religion that he thought would contribute to the welfare of the state. By his advice, therefore, she immediately recalled all exiles, and gave liberty to all prisoners who were con∣fined on account of religion. She next pub∣lished a proclamation, by which she forbade all preaching without a special licence. She also suspended the laws so far as to have a great part of the service to be read in English,<MILESTONE N="1559" UNIT="A.D."/> and forbade the host to be any more elevated in her presence. A parliament soon after com∣pleted what the prerogative had begun; act after act was passed in favour of the reforma∣tion; and in a single session the form of reli∣gion was established as we at present have the happiness to enjoy it.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76"/>The opposition which was made to these religious establishments was furious, but feeble. A conference, of nine doctors on each side, was proposed and agreed to, in presence of the lord keeper Bacon. They were to dispute public∣ly upon either side of the question; and it was resolved that the people should hold to that which came off with the victory. Disputations of this kind never carry conviction to either par∣ty; so much is to be said, and so wide is the field that both sides have to range in, that the strength of both is exhausted before the en∣gagement may be properly said to begin. The conference therefore came to nothing; the ca∣tholics declared that it was not in their power to dispute a second time upon topics, on which they had gained a former victory; while the protestants, on the other side, ascribed their caution to their fears. Of nine thousand four hundred beneficed clergymen, which were the number of those in the kingdom, only fourteen bishops, twelve archdeacons, fifteen heads of colleges, and about eighty of the parochial clergy, chose to quit their preferments rather than give up their religion. Thus England was seen to change its belief in religion four times since the beginning of the reign of Henry the eighth. <Q REND="inline">"Strange, says a foreign writer,
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
that a people so resolute, should be guilty of so much inconstancy; that the same people, who this day assisted at the execution of here∣tics, should the next, not only think them guiltless, but conform to their systems of think∣ing."</Q></P>
<P>Elizabeth was now fixed upon a protestant throne; and had consequently all the catholic powers of Europe her open or secret enemies France, Scotland, the pope, and even Spain itself, began to think of combining against her. Her subjects of Ireland were concealed enemies; and the catholic party in England, though professing obedience, were yet ready to take the advantage of her slightest misfortunes. These were the dangers she had to fear; nor had she formed a single alliance to assist her, nor possessed any foreign friends that she could safely rely on. In this situation, therefore, she could hope for no other resource but what pro∣ceeded from the affection of her own subjcts, her own insight into her affairs, and the wis∣dom of her administration. From the beginning of her reign, she seemed to aim at two very difficult attainments; to make herself loved by her subjects, and feared by her courtiers. She resolved to be frugal of her treasury; and still more sparing in her rewards to favourites.
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
This at once kept the people in good humour; and the great too poor to shake off their inde∣pendence. She also shewed, that she knew how to distribute both rewards and punishments with impartiality; that she knew when to sooth, and when to upbraid; that she could dissem∣ble submission, but preserve her prerogatives. In short, she seemed to have studied the people she was born to govern, and even shewed that she knew when to flatter their foibles to secure their affections.</P>
<P>Her chief minister was Robert Dudley, son to the late duke of Northumberland, whom she seemed to regard from capricious mo∣tives, as he was possessed neither of abilities nor virtue. But to make amends, the two favourites next in power, were Bacon and Ce∣cil, men of great capacity and infinite appli∣cation: they regulated the finances, and di∣rected the political measures with foreign courts, that were afterwards followed with so much success.</P>
<P>A state of permanent felicity is not to be ex∣pected here; and Mary Stuart, commonly called Mary queen of Scots, was the first per∣son that excited the fears or the resentment of Elizabeth. We have already mentioned, that Henry the seventh married his eldest
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
daughter, Margaret, to James, king of Scot∣land, who dying, left no issue that came to ma∣turity except Mary, afterwards surnamed Queen of Scots. At a very early age, this prin∣cess being possessed of every accomplishment of person and mind, was married to Francis, the dauphin of France, who dying, left her a widow at the age of nineteen. As Elizabeth had been declared illigitimate by Henry the eighth, Francis, in right of his wife, began to assume the title of king of England; nor did the queen of Scots, his consort, seem to decline sharing in this empty appellation. But though no∣thing could have been more unjust than such a claim, or more unlikely to succeed, Eliza∣beth, knowing that such pretensions might pro∣duce troubles in England, sent an ambassador to France, complaining of the behaviour of that court in this instance. Francis, however, was not upon such good terms with Elizabeth as to forego any claims that would distress her; and her ambassador was sent home with∣out satisfaction. Upon the death of Francis, Mary, the widow, still seemed disposed to keep up the title; but finding herself exposed to the persecutions of the dowager queen, who now began to take the lead in France, she determin∣ed to return home to Scotland, and demanded
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
a safe passage from Elizabeth through Eng∣land. But it was now Elizabeth's turn to re∣fuse; and she sent back a very haughty an∣swer to Mary's request. From hence a deter∣mined personal enmity began to prevail be∣tween these rival queens, which subsisted for many years after, until at last the superior for∣tune of Elizabeth prevailed.</P>
<P>As the transactions of this unfortunate queen make a distinguished part in Elizabeth's history, it will be necessary to give them greater room than I have hitherto given to the occurences of Scotland. The reforma∣tion in England having taken place, in Scot∣land, also, that work was begun, but with cir∣cumstances of greater animosity against their ancient superstitions. The mutual resentment which either party, in that kingdom, bore to each other, knew no bounds; and a civil war was likely to end the dispute. It was in this di∣vided state of the people, that Elizabeth, by giving encouragement to the reformers, gain∣ed over their affections from their natural queen, who was a catholic, and who conse∣quently favoured those of that persuasion. Thus religion at last effected a sincere friend∣ship between the English and Scotch, which neither treaties, nor marriages, nor the vicini∣ty
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
of situation, was able to produce. The re∣formers, to a man, considered Elizabeth as their patroness and defender, and Mary as their per∣secutor and enemy.</P>
<P>It was in this situation of things, that Mary returned from France to reign at home in Scotland, entirely attached to the customs and manners of the people she left; and conse∣quently very averse to the gloomy severity which her reformed subjects affected, and which they fancied made a proper ingredient in reli∣gion. A difference in religion between the sovereign and the people is ever productive of bad effects; since it is apt to produce con∣tempt on the one side, and jealousy on the other. Mary could not avoid regarding the four manners of the reformed clergy, who now bore sway among the people, without a mix∣ture of ridicule and hatred; while they, on the other hand, could not look tamely on the gaie∣ties and levities which she introduced among them, without abhorrence and resentment. The jealousy thus excited, began every day to grow stronger; the clergy waited only for some in∣discretion in the queen to sly out into open op∣position; and her indiscretion but to soon gave them sufficient opportunity.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="82"/>After two years had been spent in alter∣cation and reproach, between Mary and her subjects, it was resolved upon at last by her council, that she should look out for some alliance, by which she might be sheltered and protected against the insolence and misguided zeal of her spiritual instructors.<MILESTONE N="1564" UNIT="A.D."/> After some deliberation, the lord Darnley, son to the earl of Lenox, was the person in whom their opinions and wishes centered. He had been born and educated in England, was now in his twentieth year, was cousin-german to the queen; and what perhaps she might admire still more, he was extremely tall. Elizabeth was secretly no way averse to this marriage, as it freed her from the dread of a foreign al∣liance; but when informed that it was actual∣ly concluded and consummated, she pretended to testify the utmost displeasure; she menaced, complained, protested; seized all the earl of Lenox's English estate, and threw the countess and her second son into the Tower. This du∣plicity of conduct was common enough with Elizabeth; and on the present occasion, it serv∣ed her as a pretext for refusing Mary's title to the succession of England, which that prin∣cess had frequently urged, but in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83"/>But notwithstanding Elizabeth's complaints and resentment, Mary was resolved to indulge her own inclinations, and, struck with the beauty of Darnley's figure, the match was driven forward with all expedition; and some of the first weeks of their connexion seemed to promise an happy union for the rest of their lives. However, it was not without some op∣position from the reformers that this marriage was completed. It was agitated, whether the queen could marry without the consent of the people? Some lords rose up in arms to pre∣vent it; but being pursued by a superior force, they found themselves obliged to abandon their country, and take refuge in England. Thus far all was favourable to Mary; and thus far she kept within the bounds of strict virtue. Her enemies were banished, her ri∣val over-ruled, and she herself married to the man she loved.</P>
<P>While Mary had been dazzled by the pleas∣ing exterior of her new lover, she had entirely forgot to look to the accomplishments of his mind. Darnley was but a weak and ignorant man; violent, yet variable in his enterprizes; insolent, yet credulous, and easily governed by flatterers; devoid of all gratitude, because he thought no favours equal to his merit; and
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
being addicted to low pleasures, he was equally incapable of all true sentiments of love and tenderness. Mary, in the first effusions of her fondness, had taken a pleasure in exalting him beyond measure; but having leisure afterwards to remark his weakness and his vices, she be∣gan to convert her admiration into disgust; and Darnly, enraged at her encreasing cold∣ness, pointed his vengeance against every per∣son he esteemed the cause of this change in her sentiments and behaviour.</P>
<P>There was then in the court one David Rizzio, the son of a musician at Turin, him∣self a musician, who finding it difficult to subsist by his art in his own country, had fol∣lowed the ambassador from that court into Scotland. As he understood music to perfec∣tion, and sung a good bass, he was introdu∣ced into the queen's concert, who was so taken with him, that she desired the ambassa∣dor, upon his departure, to leave Rizzio be∣hind. The excellence of his voice soon pro∣cured him greater familiarities; and although he was by no means handsome, but rather ugly, the queen seemed to place peculiar con∣fidence in him, and ever kept him next her person. Her secretary for French dispatches having some time after fallen under her dis∣pleasure,
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
pleasure, she promoted Rizzio to that office, who, being shrewd, sensible, and aspiring be∣yond his rank, soon after began to enter∣tain hopes of being promoted to the im∣portant office of chancellor of the kingdom. He was consulted on all occasions; no favours could be obtained but by his intercession, and all suitors were first obliged to gain Rizzio to their interests, by presents, or by flattery. It was easy to prevail upon a man of Darn∣ley's jealous uxorious temper, that Rizzio was the person who had estranged the queen's af∣fections from him; and a surmise once con∣ceived became to him a certainty. He soon therefore consulted with some lords of his party, stung as he was with envy, rage, and resentment; and they not only fanned the con∣flagration in his mind, but offered their assist∣ance to dispatch Rizzio. George Douglas, natural brother to the countess of Lenox, the lords Ruthven and Lindsey, settled the cir∣cumstances of this poor creature's assassination among them; and determined that, as a pu∣nishment for the queen's indiscretions, the mur∣der should be committed in her presence. Mary was at this time in the sixth month of her pregnancy, and was then supping in pri∣vate, at table with the countess of Argyle,
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
her natural sister, some other servants, and her favourite Rizzio. Lord Darnly led the way into the apartment by a private stair-case, and stood for some time leaning at the back of Mary's chair. His fierce looks and unexpect∣ed intrusion greatly alarmed the queen, who, nevertheless, kept silence, not daring to call out. A little after lord Ruthven, George Douglas, and the other conspirators, rushed in, all armed, and shewing in their looks the brutality of their intentions. The queen could no longer restrain her terrors, but demanded the reason of this bold intrusion. Ruthven made her no answer; but ordered Rizzio to quit a place of which he was unworthy. Riz∣zio now saw that he was the object of their vengeance; and trembling with apprehension took hold of the queen's robes to put himself under her protection, who, on her part, strove to interpose between the assassins and him. Douglas, in the mean time, had reached the unfortunate Rizzio; and snatching a dagger from the king's side, while the queen filled the room with her cries, plunged it in her pre∣sence into Rizzio's bosom, who, screaming with fear and agony, was torn from Mary by the other conspirators, and dragged into the anti-chamber, where he was dispatched with
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
fifty-six wounds. The unhappy princess con∣tinued her lamentations; but being informed of his fate, at once dried her tears, and said she would weep no more, for she would now think of revenge. The insult indeed upon her person and honour, and the danger to which her life was exposed on account of her pregnancy, were injuries so atrocious and so complicated, that they scarce left room for pardon.</P>
<P>This act of violence was only to be punish∣ed by temporizing; she pretended to forgive so great a crime; and exerted the force of her natural allurements so powerfully, that her husband submitted implicitly to her will. He soon gave up his accomplices to her resent∣ment, and retired with her to Dunbar, while she, having collected an army, which the con∣spirators had no power to resist, advanced to Edinburgh, and obliged them to fly into Eng∣land, where they lived in great poverty and distress. They made application, however, to the earl of Bothwell, a new favourite of Mary's; and that nobleman, desirous to streng∣then his party by the accession of their inter∣est, was able to pacify her resentment, and he soon after procured them liberty to return home.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="88"/>The vengeance of the queen was implacable to her husband alone; his person was before disagreeable to her; and having persuaded him to give up his accomplices, she treated him with merited disdain and indignation. But it were well for her character and happiness had she rested only in despising; she secretly resolved on a severer revenge. The earl Both∣wel, who was now become her favourite, was of a considerable family in Scotland; and though not distinguished by any talents, civil or military, yet he made some noise in the dissensions of the state, and was an opposer of the reformation. He was a man of profligate manners, had involved his fortune in great debts, and had reduced himself to beggary by his profusion. This nobleman, notwithstanding, had ingratiated himself so far with the queen, that all her measures were entirely directed by his advice and authority. Reports were even spread of more particular intimacies; and these gave such uneasiness to Darnley, that he left the court, and retired to Glasgow, to be no longer a spectator of her excesses. But this was not what the queen aimed at; she was determined upon more ample punishment. Shortly after, all those who wished well to her character, or repose to their country, were ex∣tremely
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
pleased, and somewhat surprised, to hear that her tenderness for her husband was revived; and that she had taken a journey to visit him, during his sickness there. Darnley was so far allured by her behaviour on this oc∣casion, that he resolved to part with her no more; he put himself under her protection, and soon after attended her to Edinburgh, which it was thought would be a place more favourable to his declining health. She lived in the palace of Holyroood-house; but as the situation of that place was low, and the con∣course of persons about the court necessarily attended with noise, which might disturb him in his present infirm state, she fitted up an a∣partment for him in a solitary house at some distance, called the Kirk of Field. Mary there gave him marks of kindness and attachment; she conversed cordially with him, and she lay some nights in a room under him. It was on the ninth of February that she told him she would pass that night in the palace, because the marriage of one of her servants was to be there celebrated in her presence. But dread∣ful consequences ensued. About two o'clock in the morning the whole city was much alarmed at hearing a great noise; the house in which Darnley lay was blown up with gun∣powder.
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
His dead body was found at some distance in a neighbouring field, but without any marks of violence or contusion. No doubt could be entertained but that Darnley was murdered; and the general suspicion fell upon Bothwell as the perpetrator.</P>
<P>All orders of the state, and the whole body of the people, began to demand justice on the supposed murderer; the queen herself was not entirely exempt from the general suspicion; and papers were privately stuck up every where, ac∣cusing her of being an accomplice. Mary, more solicitous to punish others than defend her∣self, offered rewards for the discovery of those who had spread such reports; but no rewards were offered for the discovery of the murderers. One indiscretion led on to another; Bothwell, though accused of being stained with her hus∣band's blood, though universally odious to the people, had the confidence, while Mary was on her way to Stirling, on a visit to her son, to seize her at the head of a body of eight hundred horse, and to carry her to Dunbar, where he forced her to yield to his purposes. It was then thought by the people that the mea∣sure of his crimes was complete; and that he who was supposed to kill the queen's husband, and to have offered violence to her person,
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
could expect no mercy; but they were asto∣nished upon finding, instead of disgrace, that Bothwell was taken into more than former fa∣vour; and, to crown all, that he was married to the queen, having divorced his own wife to procure this union.</P>
<P>This was a fatal alliance to Mary; and the people were now wound up by the complica∣tion of her guilt, to pay very little deference to her authority. The protestant teachers, who had great power, had long borne great animosity towards her; the opinion of her guilt was by that means more widely diffused, and made the deeper impression. The princi∣pal nobility met at Stirling; and an association was soon formed for protecting the young prince, and punishing the king's murderers. Lord Hume was the first in arms; and lead∣ing a body of eight hundred horse, suddenly environed the queen and Bothwell, in the cas∣tle of Borthwick. They found means, how∣ever, to make their escape; and Bothwell, at the head of a few forces, meeting the associa∣tors within about six miles of Edinburgh, was obliged to capitulate, while Mary was con∣ducted by the prevailing party into Edin∣burgh, amidst the insults and reproaches of the populace. From thence she was sent a
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
prisoner to the castle of Lochlevin, situated in a lake of that name, where she suffered all the severities of an unkind keeper, and an up∣braiding conscience, with a feeling heart. Both∣well, however, was more fortunate; he fled during the conference, unattended to Dunbar, where fitting out a few small ships, he sub∣sisted among the Orkneys for some time by piracy. Being pursued thither, and his do∣mestics taken, who made a full discovery of his crimes, he escaped himself in an open boat to Denmark, where he was thrown into prison, lost his senses, and died miserably about ten years afterwards.</P>
<P>In this situation, Mary was not entirely without protection and friends. Queen Eli∣zabeth, who now saw her rival entirely hum∣bled, began to relent; she was seen to reflect on the precarious state of royal grandeur, and the danger of encouraging rebellious subjects; she, therefore, sent Sir Nicholas Throgmorton as her ambassador to Scotland, to interpose in her behalf; but the associated lords thought proper to deny him, after several affected de∣lays, all access to Mary's person. However, though he could not confer with her, he pro∣cured her the best terms with the rebellious lords that he could, which was, that she should
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
resign the crown in favour of her son, who was as yet a minor; that she should appoint the earl of Murray, who had from the begin∣ing testified an hatred to lord Darnly, as re∣gent of the kingdom; and as he was then in France, that she should appoint a council till his arrival. Mary could not think of resign∣ing all power without a plentiful effusion of tears; but at last signed what was brought to her, even without inspection. In consequence of this forced resignation, the young prince was proclaimed king, under the title of James the sixth. The queen had now no hopes but from the kindness of the earl of Murray; but even here she was disappointed; the earl, upon his return, instead of comforting her, as she expected, loaded her with reproaches, which reduced her almost to despair.</P>
<P>The calamities of the great, even though justly deserved, seldom fail of creating pity, and procuring friends. Mary, by her charms and promises, had engaged a young gentle∣man, whose name was George Douglas, to assist her in escaping from the place where she was confined: and this he effected, by convey∣ing her in disguise in a small boat, rowed by himself, a-shore. It was now that the news of her enlargement being spread abroad, all
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
the loyalty of the people seemed to revive once more. As Bothwell was no longer associated in her cause, many of the nobility, who expect∣ed to succeed him in favour, signed a bond of association for her defence; and in a few days she saw herself at the head of six thou∣sand men.</P>
<P>The earl of Murray, who had been declared regent, was not slow in assembling his forces; and although his army was inferior to that of the queen of Scots, he boldly took the field against her. A battle was fought at Langside, near Glasgow, which was entirely decisive in his favour; and he seemed to merit victory by his clemency after the action. Mary, now totally ruined, fled southwards from the field of battle with great precipitation; <MILESTONE N="1568" UNIT="A.D."/> and came with a few attendants to the borders of Eng∣land, where she hoped for protection from Elizabeth, who had upon some recent occa∣sions declared in her favour.</P>
<P>With these hopes she embarked on board a fishing boat in Galloway, and landed the same day at Wirkington in Cumberland, a∣bout thirty miles distant from Carlisle, whence she immediately dispatched a messenger to London, craving protection, and desiring liber∣ty to visit the queen. Elizabeth being inform∣ed
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
of her misfortunes and retreat, deliberat∣ed for some time upon the proper methods of proceeding, and resolved at last to act in a friendly, yet cautious manner. She immedi∣ately sent orders to lady Scrope, sister to the duke of Norfolk, a lady who lived in that neighbourhood, to attend on the queen of Scots; and soon after dispatched lord Scrope himself, and sir Francis Knolles, to pay her all possi∣ble respect. Notwithstanding these marks of distinction, the queen refused to admit Mary into her presence, untill she had cleared her character from the many foul aspersions that it was stained with. It might, perhaps, have been Elizabeth's duty to protect, and not to examine, her royal fugitive. However, she acted entirely under the direction of her coun∣cil, who observed, that if the crimes of the Scot∣tish princess were really so great as they were re∣presented, the treating her with friendship would but give them a sanction; if she was found guiltless upon trial, every enterpize, which friendship should inspire in her defence, would be considered as laudable and glorious.</P>
<P>Mary was now, though reluctantly, obliged to admit her ancient rival as an umpire in her cause; and the accusation was readily under∣taken by Murray the regent, who expected
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
to remove so powerful an assistant as Eliza∣beth, by the atrociousness of Mary's offences. This extraordinary conference, which delibe∣rated on the conduct of a foreign queen, was managed at York; three commissioners being appointed by Elizabeth, nine by the queen of Scots, and five by the regent, in which he himself was included. These conferences were carried on for some time at the place first ap∣pointed; but after a while, Elizabeth, either unwilling to decide, as she would thus give up the power she was now possessed of, or perhaps desirous of throwing all light possible upon Mary's conduct, ordered the commissi∣oners to continue their conferences at Hamp∣ton-court, where they were spun out by affect∣ed delays. Whatever might have been the cause of protracting this conference in the beginning is not known; but many of the proofs of Mary's guilt, which were suppressed at York, made their appearance before the board at Hampton. Among other proofs, were many letters and sonnets written in Mary's own hand to Bothwell, in which she discovers her knowledge of Darnley's intended murder, and her contrivance to marry Both∣well, by pretending a forced compliance. These papers, it must be owned, are not free
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
themselves from suspicion of being a forgery; yet the reasons for their authenticity seem to prevail. However this be, the proofs of Mary's guilt appearing stronger, it was thought proper to engage her advocates to give answers to them; but they, contrary to expectation, refused, alledging, that as Mary was a sove∣reign princess, she could not be subject to any tribunal, not considering that the aim of this conference was not punishment, but reconcilia∣tion; that it was not to try Mary, in order to inflict penalties, but to know whether she was wor∣thy of Elizabeth's friendship and protection. Instead of attempting to justify her conduct, the queen of Scots laboured nothing so much as to obtain an interview with Elizabeth; conscious that her insinuations, arts, and ad∣dress, of all which she was a perfect mistress, would be sufficient to persuade her royal sister, and stand in place of innocence. But as she still persisted in a resolution to make no de∣fence, this demand was finally refused her.</P>
<P>She still, however, persisted in demanding Elizabeth's protection; she desired that either she should be assisted in her endeavours to re∣cover her authority, or that liberty should be given her for retiring into France, there to make trial of the friendship of other princes.
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
But Elizabeth, sensible of the danger which attended either of these proposals, was secretly resolved to detain her still in captivity, and she was accordingly sent to Tuthury castle, in the county of Stafford, where she was put un∣der the custody of the earl of Shrewsbury; there she gave her royal prisoner hopes of one day coming into favour, and that unless her own obstinacy prevented, an accommodation might at last take place.</P>
<P>But this unhappy woman was fated to no∣thing but misfortunes; and those hopes of ac∣commodation which she had been given to ex∣pect, were still put off by some sinister accident. The factions of her own subjects in Scotland tended not a little to alarm the jealousy of Elizabeth, and encrease the rigours of Mary's confinement. The regent of Scotland, who had been long her inveterate enemy, happen∣ing to be assassinated, in revenge of a private in∣jury, by a gentleman of the name of Hamilton, upon his death the kingdom relapsed into its former anarchy. Mary's party once more as∣sembled themselves together, and became mas∣ters of Edinburgh. They even ventured to∣wards the borders of England, where they committed some disorders, which called upon the vigilance of Elizabeth to suppress. She
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
quickly sent an army commanded by the earl of Suffex, who entering Scotland, principally chastised all the partizans of the captive queen, under a pretence that they had offended his mistress by harbouring English rebels.</P>
<P>But the designs and arts of Elizabeth did not rest here; while she kept up the most friendly correspendence with Mary, and the most warm protestations of sincerity passed between them, she was far from either assisting her cause, or yet from rendering it desperate. It was her interest to keep the factions in Scot∣land still alive, to weaken the power of that restless and troublesome nation; for this pur∣pose she weakened the party of the queen, that had now promised to prevail, by tedious negociations; and in the mean time procur∣ed the earl of Lenox to be appointed regent, in the room of Murray who was flain.</P>
<P>This attempt, which promised to be favour∣able to Mary, proved thus unsuccessful, as well as another, which was concerted near the place of her captivity. The duke of Norfolk was the only peer who enjoyed that highest title of nobility in England; and the qualities of his mind corresponded to his high station. Beneficent, affable, and generous,<MILESTONE N="1568" UNIT="A.D."/> he had ac∣quired the affections of the people; and yet
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
from his moderation, he had never alarmed the jealousy of the sovereign. He was at this time a widower, and being of a suitable age to espouse the queen of Scots, her own at∣tractions, as well as his interests, made him desirous of the match. But the obtaining Eli∣zabeth's consent, previous to their nuptials, was considered as a circumstance essential to his aims. But while this nobleman made al∣most all the nobility of England confidants to his passion, he never had the prudence, or the courage, to open his full intentions to the queen herself. On the contrary, in order to suppress the surmises that were currently reported, he spoke contemptuously of Mary to Elizabeth; affirmed that his estates in England were of more value than the revenue of the whole kingdom; and declared, that when he amused himself in his own tennis-court at Norwich, he was a more magnificent prince than a Scottish king. This duplicity only served to enflame the queen's suspicions the more; and finding that she gave his professions no great degree of credit, he retired from the court in disgust. Repenting, however, soon after of this mea∣sure, he was resolved to return, with a view of regaining the queen's good graces; but on the way, he was stopt by a messenger from the
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
queen, and soon commited to the Tower under the custody of Sir Henry Nevil.</P>
<P>But the duke of Norfolk was too much beloved by his partizans in the North, to be confined without an effort made for his release. The earls of Westmorland and Northumber∣land had prepared measures for a rebellion; had communicated their design to Mary and her ministers; had entered into a correspon∣dence with the duke of Alva, governor of the Low Countries, and had obtained his promise of men and ammunition. But the vigilance of Elizabeth's ministers was not to be eluded; or∣ders were immediately sent for their appear∣ance at court, and now the insurgent lords per∣ceiving their schemes discovered, were obliged to begin their revolt before matters were en∣tirely prepared for its opening. They accord∣ingly published a manifesto, in which they al∣ledged, that no injury was intended against the queen, to whom they vowed unshaken al∣legiance; but that their sole aim was to re-es∣tablish the religion of their ancestors, to remove all evil counsellors from about the queen's person; and to restore the duke of Norfolk to his liberty and the queen's favour. Their num∣ber amounted to four thousand foot, and six∣teen hundred, horse; and they expected to be
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
joined by all the catholics in England. But they soon found themselves miserably unde∣ceived; the queen's conduct had acquired the general good will of the people, and she now perceived that her surest support was the jus∣tice of her actions. The duke of Norfolk himself, for whose sake they had revolted, used every method that his circumstances would permit, to assist and support the queen; the in∣surgents were obliged to retire before her forces to Hexham; and hearing that reinforcements were upon their march to join the royal army, they found no other expedient but to disperse themselves without a blow. Northumberland fled into Scotland, and was confined by the re∣gent to the castle of Lochlevin; Westmorland, after attempting to excite the Scotch to revolt, was obliged to escape into Flanders, where he found protection. This rebellion was follow∣ed by another, led on by lord Dacres, but with as little success. Some severities were used against these revolters, and it is said, that no less than eight suffered by the hands of the executioner on this occasion. The queen was so well pleased with the duke of Norfolk's be∣haviour,<MILESTONE N="1569" UNIT="A.D."/> that she now released him from the Tower; allowed him to return home, only exacting a promise from him, not to proceed
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
any farther in his pretensions to the queen of Scots.</P>
<P>But the queen's confidence was fatal to this brave, but undesigning nobleman. He had not been released above a year, when new pro∣jects were set on foot by the enemies of the queen and the reformed religion, secretly fo∣mented by Rodolphi, an instrument of the court of Rome, and the bishop of Ross, Mary's minister in England. It was concerted by them, that Norfolk should renew his designs upon Mary, to which it is probable he was prompt∣ed by passion; and this nobleman entering into their schemes, he from being at first only ambitious, now became criminal. It was mu∣tually agreed, therefore, that the duke should enter into all Mary's interests; while on the other hand, the duke of Alva promised to transport a body of six thousand foot, and four thousand horse, to join Norfolk as soon as he should be ready to begin. This scheme was so secretly laid, that it had hitherto entirely escaped the vigilance of Elizabeth, and that of secretary Cecil, who now bore the title of lord Burleigh. It was found out merely by accident; for the duke having sent a sum of money to lord Herreis, one of Mary's partizans in Scot∣land, omitted trusting the servant with the con∣tents
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
of his message; and he finding, by the weight of the bag, that it contained a larger sum than the duke mentioned to him, began to mistrust some plot, and brought the money, with the duke's letter, to the secretary of state. It was by the artifices of that great statesman, that the duke's servants were brought to make a full confession of their master's guilt; and the bishop of Ross soon after, finding the whole discovered, did not scruple to confirm their testimony. The duke was instantly committed to the Tower, and ordered to prepare for his trial. A jury of twenty-five peers unanimously passed sentence upon him; and the queen, four months after, reluctantly signed the warrant for his execution. He died with great calm∣ness and constancy; and though he cleared himself of any disloyal intentions against the queen's authority, he acknowledged the justice of the sentence by which he suffered. A few months after, the duke of Northumberland be∣ing delivered up by the regent, underwent a similar trial, and was brought to the scaffold for his rebellion. All these ineffectual struggles in favour of the unfortunate queen of Scots, seemed only to rivet the chains of her con∣finement; and she now found relief only in the resources of her own mind, which distress
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
had contributed to soften, refine, and improve. From henceforth she continued for several years a precarious dependent on Elizabeth's suspicions; and only waited for some new ef∣fort of her adherents to receive that fate, which political, and not merciful motives seemed to prolong.</P>

</FIGURE> CHAP. XXVII. ELIZABETH (Continued.)</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus far attended the queen of Scotland, whose conduct and misfortunes make such a distinguished figure in this reign, we now return to some transactions, prior in point of time, but of less consideration.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this reign, the Hugo∣nots, or reformed party in France, were oblig∣ed
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
to call in the protection of the English; <MILESTONE N="1562" UNIT="A.D."/> and in order to secure their confidence, as they were possessed of the greatest part of Normandy, they offered to put Havre into the queen's hands, a proffer which she immediately ac∣cepted. She wisely considered, that as that port commanded the mouth of the river Seine, it was of much more importance than Calais; and she could thus have the French still in her power. Accordingly three thousand English took possession of Havre and Dieppe, under the command of Sir Edward Poinings, but the latter place was found so little capable of being defended, that it was immediately aban∣doned. But Havre itself was obliged to capi∣tulate shortly after. Although the garrison was reinforced, and was found to amount to six thousand men; and every means was em∣ployed for putting the town in a posture of defence against the French army that was pre∣paring to besiege it, yet it felt a severer ene∣my within its walls; for the plague had got into the town, and committed such havock among the soldiers, that an hundred were com∣monly seen to die of it in one day. The gar∣rison, being thus dispirited and diminished to fifteen hundred men, finding the French army indefatigable in their approaches, were obliged
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
to capitulate; and thus the English lost all hopes of ever making another establishment in the kingdom of France. This misfortune was productive of one still more dreadful to the nation, for the English army carried back the plague with them to London, which made such ravages, that twenty thousand persons died there in one year.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1563" UNIT="A.D."/> This, if we except the troubles raised upon the account of Mary, seems to have been the only disaster that, for above thirteen years, any way contributed to disturb the peace of this reign. Elizabeth, ever vigilant, active, and re∣solute, attended to the slightest alarms, and re∣pressed them before they were capable of pro∣ducing their effect. Her frugality kept her independent, and her dissimulation (for she could dissemble) made her beloved. The opinion of the royal prerogative was such, that her commands were obeyed as statutes; and she took care that her parliaments should ne∣ver venture to circumscribe her power. In her schemes of government she was assisted by lord Burleigh, and Sir Anthony Bacon, two of the most able ministers that ever directed the affairs of England; but while she com∣mitted, to them all the drudgery of duty, her favourite Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, en∣grossed
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
all her favour, and secured all the ave∣nues to preferment. All requests were made through him; and nothing given away with∣out his consent and approbation. His merits, however, were by no means adequate to his successes; he was weak, vain, and boastful; but these qualities did no injury to the state, as his two co-adjutors were willing, while he maintained all the splendour of office, to se∣cure to themselves the more solid emolu∣ments.</P>
<P>During this peaceable and uniform govern∣ment, England furnishes but few materials for history. While France was torn with inter∣nal convulsions; while above ten thousand of the Hugonots were massacred in one night, in cool blood, on the feast of St. Bartholomew, at Paris; while the inhabitants of the Low Countries had shaken off the Spanish yoke, and were bravely vindicating their rights and their religion; while all the rest of Europe was teeming with plots, seditions, and cruel∣ty; the English, under their wise queen, were enjoying all the benefits of peace, extending commerce, improving manufactures; and set∣ing an example of arts and learning to all the rest of the world. Except the small part, therefore, which Elizabeth took in foreign
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
transactions, there scarce passed any occurence which requires a particular detail.</P>
<P>There had for some time arisen disgusts between the court of England and that of Spain. Elizabeth's having rejected the suit of Philip, might probably have given rise to these distrusts; and after that, Mary's claim∣ing the protection of that monarch, tended still more to widen the breach. This began, as usual on each side, with petty hostilities; the Spaniards, on their part, had sent into Ireland a body of seven hundred of their nation, and Italians, who built a fort there; but were soon after cut off to a man, by the duke of Or∣mond. On the other hand the English, under the conduct of Sir Francis Drake, assaulted the Spaniards in the place where they deemed themselves most secure, in the New World. This was the first Englishman that sailed round the globe; and the queen was so well pleased with his valour and success, that she accepted a banquet from him at Deptford, on board the ship which had atchieved so memorable a voyage.</P>
<P>In this manner, while hostilities were daily multiplying between Spain and England; and while the power of Spain, as well as the mo∣narch's inclinations, were very formidable to
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
the queen, she began to look out for an al∣liance that might support her against such a dangerous adversary. The duke of Anjou had long made pretensions to Elizabeth; and though she was near twenty-five years older than he, he took the resolution to prefer his suit in person, and paid her a visit in secret at Greenwich. It appears, that though his figure was not advantageous, his address was pleas∣ing. The queen ordered her ministers to fix the terms of the contract; a day was appointed for the solemnization of their nuptials, and every thing seemed to speak an approaching union. But Elizabeth could not be induced, as that event appeared to approach, to change her condition; she appeared doubtful, irreso∣lute, and melancholy; she was observed to pass several nights without any sleep, till at last her settled habits of prudence prevailed over her ambition, and the duke of Anjou was dismissed.</P>
<P>The queen thus depriving herself of a fo∣reign ally, looked for approbation and assist∣ance from her own subjects at home. Yet even here she was not without numberless enemies, who either hated her for religion, or envied her for success. There were seve∣ral conspiracies formed against her life, many
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
of which were imputed to the intrigues of the queen of Scots, at least it is certain that her name was used in all. Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland, brother to him beheaded some years before, and Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, son to the unfortunate duke of Norfolk, fell under suspicion; and the latter was, by order of council, confined to his own house. Francis Throgmorton, a private gen∣tleman, was committed to custody, on ac∣count of a letter which he had written to the queen of Scots; and shortly after confessing his guilt, he was condemned and executed. Soon after William Parry, a catholic gentle∣man, who had on a former occasion received the queen's pardon, was found engaged in a desperate conspiracy to assassinate his sovereign and benefactor. He had consulted upon the justice and expediency of this vile measure both with the pope's nuncio and legate, who exhorted him to persevere in his resolution, and extremely applauded his design. He, therefore, associated himself with one Nevil, who entered zealously into the design; and it was determined to shoot the queen, while she was taking the air on horseback. But while they were watching an opportunity for the execution of their purpose, the earl of West∣moreland
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
happened to die in exile; and as Nevil was next heir to the family, he began to entertain hopes, that by doing some accept∣able service to the queen, he might recover the estate and honours which had been forfeited by the rebellion of the last earl. He betrayed the whole conspiracy to the ministers; and Parry being thrown into prison confessed the guilt both to them, and to the jury who tried him. He was shortly after condemned and executed.</P>
<P>These attempts, which were entirely set on foot by the catholic party, served to encrease the severity of the laws against them. Popish priests were banished the kingdom; those who harboured or relieved them were declared guilty of felony; and many were executed in consequence of this severe edict. Nor was the queen of Scots herself without some share of the punishment. She was removed from un∣der the care of the earl of Shrewsbury, who had always been indulgent to his prisoner, par∣ticularly with regard to air and exercise; and she was committed to the custody of Sir Amias Paulett, and Sir Drue Drury, men of honour, but inflexible and rigid in their care and at∣tention.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="114"/>These conspiracies served to prepare the way for Mary's ruin, whose greatest misfortunes proceeded rather from the violence of her friends, than the malignity of her enemies. Elizabeth's ministers had long been wait∣ing for some signal instance of the captive queen's enmity, which they could easily convert into treason; and this was not long wanting.<MILESTONE N="1586" UNIT="A.D."/> About this time one John Ballard, a popish priest, who had been bred in the English seminary at Rheims, resolved to com∣pass the death of a queen, whom he consider∣ed as the enemy of his religion; and with that gloomy resolution came over into England in the disguise of a soldier, with the assumed name of captain Fortescue. He bent his endea∣vours to bring about at once the project of an assassination, an insurrection, and an invasion. The first person he addressed himself to was Anthony Babington, of Dethick, in the county of Derby, a young gentleman of good family, and possessed of a very plentiful fortune. This person had been long remarkable for his zeal in the catholic cause, and in particular for his attachment to the captive queen. He there∣fore came readily into the plot, and procured the concurrence and assistance of some other associates in this dangerous undertaking. Barn∣well,
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
a gentleman of a noble family in Ire∣land, Charnock, a gentleman of Lancashire, Abington, whose father had been cofferer to the household, and chief of all John Savage, a man of desperate fortunes, who had served in the Low Countries, and came into England under a vow to destroy the queen. He indeed did not seem to desire any associate in the bold enterprize, and refused for some time to per∣mit any to share with him in what he esteemed his greatest glory. He challenged the whole to himself; and it was with some difficulty that he was induced to depart from his preposterous ambition. The next step was to apprize Mary of the conspiracy formed in her favour; and this they effected by conveying their letters to her by means of a brewer that supplied the fa∣mily with ale, through a chink, in the wall of her apartment. In these, Babington informed her of a design laid for a foreign invasion, the plan of an insurrection at home, the scheme for her delivery, and the conspiracy for assas∣sinating the usurper by six noble gentlemen, as he termed them, all of them his private friends, who, from the zeal which they bore the catholic cause, and her majesty's service, would undertake the tragical execution. To these Mary replied, that she approved highly of the design; that the gentlemen might ex∣pect
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
all the rewards which it should be ever in her power to confer; and that the death of Elizabeth was a necessary circumstance, pre∣vious to any further attempts either for her delivery, or the intended insurrection.</P>
<P>Such was the scheme laid by the conspira∣tors; and nothing seemed so certain as its se∣crecy and its success. But they were all mi∣serably deceived; the active and sagacious mi∣nisters of Elizabeth were privy to it in every stage of its growth, and only retarded their discovery till the meditated guilt was ripe for punishment and conviction. Ballard was ac∣tually attended by one Maude, a catholic priest, who was a spy in pay with Walsingham, se∣cretary of state. One Polly, another of his spies, had found means to insinuate himself among the conspirators, and to give an exact account of their proceedings. Soon after one Giffard a priest came over, and discovering the whole conspiracy to the bottom, made a ten∣der of his service to Walsingham. It was he that procured the letters to be conveyed thro' the wall to the queen, and received her answers; but he had always taken care to shew them to the secretary of state, who had them deci∣phered, and took copies of them all.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="117"/>The plot being thus ripe for execution, and the evidence against the conspirators incontest∣ible, Walsingham resolved to suspend their pu∣nishment no longer. A warrant was accord∣ingly issued out for the apprehending of Bal∣lard; and this giving the alarm to Babington, and the rest of the conspirators, they covered themselves with various disguises, and endea∣voured to keep themselves concealed. But they were soon discovered, thrown into prison, and brought to trial. In their examination they contradicted each other, and the leaders were obliged to make a full confession of the truth. Fourteen were condemned and exe∣cuted, seven of whom died acknowledging their crime.</P>
<P>The execution of these wretched men only prepared the way for one of still greater im∣portance, in which a captive queen was to sub∣mit to the unjust decisions of those who had no right, but that of power, to condemn her. Though all England was acquainted with the detection of Babington's conspiracy, every ave∣nue to the unfortunate Mary was so strictly guarded, that she remained in utter ignorance of the whole matter. But her astonishment was equal to her anguish, when sir Thomas Gor∣ges, by Elizabeth's order, came to inform her
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
of the fate of her unhappy confederates. She was at that time mounted on horse-back, going a-hunting; and was not permitted to return to her former place of abode, but con∣ducted from one gentleman's house to another, till she was lodged in Fotheringay castle, in Northamptonshire, where the last scene of her miserable tragedy was to conclude.</P>
<P>The council of England was divided in opinion about the measures to be taken a∣gainst the queen of Scots. Some members proposed, that as her health was very infirm, her life might be shortened by close confine∣ment; therefore to avoid any imputation of vio∣lence or cruelty, the earl of Leicester proposed that she should be dispatched by poison; but the majority insisted on her being put to death by legal process. Accordingly a commission was issued to forty peers, with five judges, or the major part of them, to try and pass sen∣tence upon Mary, daughter and heir of James the fifth, king of Scotland, commonly called queen of Scots, and dowager of France.</P>
<P>Thirty six of these commissioners arriving at the castle of Fotheringay,<MILESTONE N="Nov. 11, 1586."/> presented her with a letter from Elizabeth, commanding her to sub∣mit to a trial for her late conspiracy. Mary perused the letter with great composure; and
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
as she had long foreseen the danger that hung over her, received the intelligence without emotion or astonishment. She said, however, that she wondered the queen of England should command her as a subject, who was an inde∣pendent sovereign, and a queen like herself. She would never, she said, stoop to any con∣descension which would lessen her dignity, or prejudice the claims of her posterity. The laws of England, she observed, were unknown to her; she was destitute of counsel; nor could she conceive who were to be her peers, as she had but one equal in the kingdom. She add∣ed, that instead of enjoying the protection of the laws of England, as she had hoped to ob∣tain, she had been confined in prison ever since her arrival in the kingdom; so that she derived neither benefit, nor security from them. When the commissioners pressed her to submit to the queen's pleasure, otherwise they would proceed against her as contumacious, she declared she would rather suffer a thou∣sand deaths, than own herself a subject to any prince on earth. That, however, she was ready to vindicate herself in a full and free parliament, as for aught she knew, this meet∣ing of commissioners was devised against her life, on purpose to take it away with a pretext
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
of justice. She exhorted them to consult their own consciences, and to remember that the theatre of the world was much more extensive than that of the kingdom of England. At length, the vice-chamberlain Hatton vanquish∣ed her objections, by representing that she in∣jured her reputation by avoiding a trial, in which her innocence might be proved to the satisfaction of all mankind. This observation made such an impression upon her, that she agreed to plead, if they would admit and al∣low her protest, of disallowing all subjection. This, however, they refused; but they satisfied her, by entering it upon record, and thus they proceeded to a trial.</P>
<P>The principal charge against her was urged by serjeant Gaudy, who accused her with knowing, approving, and consenting to Ba∣bington's conspiracy. This charge was sup∣ported by Babington's confession, by the co∣pies which were taken of their correspondence, in which her approbation of the queen's mur∣der was expresly declared, by the evidence of her own two secretaries, Nau, a Frenchman, and Curle, a Scotchman, who swore that she received Babington's letters, and that they had answered them by her orders. These were still further confirmed by the testimony of Bal∣lard
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
and Savage, to whom Babington had shewn these letters, declaring them to have come from the captive queen. To these charges Mary made a sensible and reso∣lute defence; she said Babington's confession was extorted from his fears of the torture, which was really the case; she alledged, that the letters were forgeries; and she defied her secretaries to persist in their evidence, if brought into her presence. She owned, indeed, that she had used her best endeavours to recover her liberty, which was only pursuing the dic∣tates of nature; but as for harbouring a thought against the life of the queen, she treated the idea with horror. During the course of the trial, as a letter between Mary and Babington was reading, mention was made in it of the earl of Arundel and his brothers. On hearing their names she shed a flood of tears, exclaiming, Alas! what hath the noble house of the Howards endured for my sake! She took occasion also to observe, that his let∣ter might have been a base contrivance of Walsingham's, who had frequently practised both against her life and her son's. Walsing∣ham thus accused rose up, and protested that his heart was free from malice; that he had never done any thing unbecoming an honest
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
man in his private capacity, nor aught unwor∣thy of the place he occupied in the state. Mary declared herself satisfied of his inno∣cence, and begged he would give as little cre∣dit to the malicious accusations of her ene∣mies, as she now gave to the reports which she had heard to his prejudice.</P>
<P>Whatever might have been this queeen's offences, it is certain that her treatment was very severe. She desired to be put in posses∣sion of such notes as she had taken preparative to her trial; but this was refused her. She demanded a copy of her protest; but her re∣quest was not complied with; she even required an advocate to plead her cause against so many learned lawyers, as had undertaken to urge her accusations, but all her demands were re∣jected; and, after an adjournment of some days, sentence of death was pronounced against her in the Star-chamber in Westminster, all the commissioners, except two, being present. At the same time a declaration was published by the commissioners, implying, that the sen∣tence against her did no wise derogate from the title and honour of James, king of Scot∣land, son to the attainted queen.</P>
<P>Though the condemning a sovereign prin∣cess at a tribunal to which she owed no sub∣jection,
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
was an injustice that must strike the most inattentive, yet the parliament of Eng∣land, who met four days after,<MILESTONE N="Oct. 29, 1586."/> did not fail to approve the sentence, and to go still farther, in presenting an address to the queen, desiring that it might speedily be put into execution. But Elizabeth still possessed, or pretended to possess, an horror for such precipitate severity. She entreated them to find some expedient to save her from the necessity of taking a step so repugnant to her inclination. But at the same time she seemed to dread another conspi∣racy to assassinate her within a month, which probably was only an artifice of her ministers to encrease her apprehensions, and consequent∣ly her desire of being rid of a rival, that had given her so much disturbance. The parlia∣ment, however, reiterated their sollicitations, arguments, and entreaties; and even remon∣strated, that mercy to the queen of Scots was cruelty to them, her subjects, and her children. Elizabeth affected to continue inflexible; but at the same time permitted Mary's sentence to be made public; and lord Buckhurst, and Beale, clerk to the council, were sent to the unhappy queen to apprize her of the sentence, and the popular clamour for its speedy exe∣cution.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="124"/>Upon receiving this dreadful information, Mary seemed no way moved; but insisted that since her death was demanded by the protest∣ants, she died a martyr to the catholic re∣ligion. She said, that as the English often embrued their hands in the blood of their own sovereigns, it was not to be wondered at that they exercised their cruelty towards her. She wrote her last letter to Elizabeth, not demand∣ing her life, which she now seemed willing to part with, but desiring, that after her enemies should be satiated with her innocent blood, her body might be consigned to her servants, and conveyed to France, there to repose in a catholic country, with the sacred reliques of her mother.</P>
<P>In the mean time, accounts of this extraor∣dinary sentence were spread into all parts of Europe; and the king of France was among the foremost who attempted to avert the threatened blow. He sent over Believre as an extraordinary ambassador, with a professed intention of interceding for the life of Mary. But James of Scotland, her son, was, as in duty obliged, still more pressing in her behalf. He dispatched one Keith, a gentleman of his bed-chamber, with a letter to Elizabeth, con∣juring her to spare the life of his parent, and
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
miring threats of vengeance, in case of a refu∣sal. Elizabeth, however, treated his remon∣strances with the utmost indignation; and when the Scotch ambassador begged that the execution might be put off for a week, the queen answered with great emotion,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, not for an hour."</Q>
Thus Elizabeth, when sol∣licited by foreign princes to pardon the queen of Scots, seemed always disposed to proceed to extremities against her; but when her mini∣sters urged her to strike the blow, her scruples and her reluctance seemed to return.</P>
<P>Whether the queen was really sincere in her reluctance to execute Mary, is a question which, though usually given against her, I will not take upon me to determine. Certain∣ly there were great arts used by her courtiers to determine her to the side of severity; as they had every thing to fear from the resent∣ment of Mary, in case she ever succeeded to the throne. Accordingly, the kingdom was now filled with rumours of plots, treasons, and insurrections; and the queen was continually kept in alarm by fictitious dangers. She, therefore, appeared to be in great terror and perplexity; she was observed to sit much alone, and to mutter to herself half sentences, import∣ing the difficulty and distress to which she was
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
reduced. In this situation, she one day called her secretary, Davison, whom she ordered to draw out secretly the warrant for Mary's exe∣cution, informing him, that she intended to keep it by her in case any attempt should be made for the delivery of that princess. She signed the warrant, and then commanded it to be carried to the chancellor to have the seal affixed to it. Next morning, however, she sent two gentlemen successively to desire that Davison would not go to the chancellor, until she should see him; but Davison telling her that the warrant had been already sealed, she seemed displeased at his precipitation. Davison, who probably wished himself to see the sentence executed, laid the affair before the council, who unanimously resolved, that the warrant should be immediately put in exe∣cution, and promised to justify Davison to the queen. Accordingly, the fatal instrument was delivered to Beale, who summoned the noble∣men to whom it was directed, namely, the earls of Shrewsbery, Derby, Kent, and Cum∣berland, and these together set out for Fother∣ingay castle, accompanied by two execution∣ers, to dispatch their bloody commission.</P>
<P>Mary heard of the arrival of her execution∣ers, who ordered her to prepare for death by
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
eight o'clock the next morning. Without any alarm she heard the death-warrant read with her usual composure, though she could not help expressing her surprize, that the queen of England should consent to her execution. She even abjured her being privy to any con∣spiracy against Elizabeth, by laying her hand upon a New Testament, which happened to lie on the table. She desired that her confes∣sor might be permitted to attend her, which, however, these zealots refused. After the earls had retired, she ate sparingly at supper, while she comforted her attendants, who con∣tinued weeping and lamenting their mistress, with a chearful countenance, telling them, they ought not to mourn, but rejoice, at the prospect of her speedy deliverance from a world of misery. Towards the end of supper, she called in all her servants, and drank to them; they pledged her in order on their knees, and craved her pardon for any past neglect of duty. She craved mutual forgive∣ness; and a plentiful effusion of tears attended this last solemn separation.</P>
<P>After this, she reviewed her will, and pe∣rused the inventory of her effects. These she bequeathed to different individuals, and divid∣ed her money among her domestics, recom∣mending
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
them in letters to the king of France, and the duke of Guise. Then going to bed at her usual hour, she passed part of the night in uninterrupted repose; and rising, spent the remainder in prayer, and acts of devotion. Towards morning, she dressed her∣self in a rich habit of silk and velvet, the only one which she had reserved for this solemn oc∣casion. Thomas Andrews, the under-sheriff of the country, then entering the room, he informed her that the hour was come, and that he must attend her to the place of execution. She replied, that she was ready; and bidding her servants farewel, she proceeded, supported by two of her guards, and followed the sheriff, with a serene composed aspect, with a long veil of linen on her head, and in her hand a crucifix of ivory. In passing through an hall adjoining to her chamber, Sir Andrew Melvil, master of her houshold, fell upon his knees, and shedding a flood of tears, lamented his misfortune, in being doomed to carry the news of her unhappy fate to Scotland.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lament not, said she, but rather rejoice. Mary Stuart will soon be freed from all her cares. Tell my friends that I die constant in my religion, and firm in my affection and fideli∣ty to Scotland and France. God forgive
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
them that have long desired my end, and have thirsted for my blood, as the heart panteth for the water-brook. Thou O God, who art truth itself, and perfectly under∣standest the inmost thoughts of my heart, knowest how greatly I have desired that the realms of Scotland and England might be united. Commend me to my son, and as∣sure him I have done nothing prejudicial to the state, or the crown of Scotland. Ad∣monish him to persevere in amity and friend∣ship with the queen of England, and see that thou dost him faithful service. And so good Melvil farewel; once again fare∣wel, good Melvil, and grant the assistance of thy prayers to thy queen and thy mistress."</Q>
In this place she was received by the four noblemen, who with great difficulty were pre∣vailed upon to allow Melvil, with her physi∣cian, apothecary, and two female attendants, to be present at her execution. She then pas∣sed into another hall, the noblemen and the sheriff going before, and Melvil bearing up her train; where was a scaffold erected and covered with black. As soon as she was seated, Beale began to read the warrant for her execution. Then Fletcher, dean of Peter∣borough, standing without the rails, repeated
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
a long exhortation, which she desired him to forbear, as she was firmly resolved to die in the catholic religion. The room was crowded with spectators, who beheld her with pity and distress, while her beauty, though dimmed by age and affliction, gleamed through her suffer∣ings, and was still remarkable in this fatal mo∣ment. The earl of Kent observing, that in her devotions she made frequent use of the crucifix, he could not forbear reproving her, exhorting her to have Christ in her heart, not in her hand. She replied, with presence of mind, that it was difficult to hold such an object in her hand, without feeling her heart touched for the sufferings of him whom it repre∣sented. She now began, with the aid of her two women, to undress for the block; and the executioner also lent his hand to assist them. She smiled, and said that she was not accustom∣ed to undress herself before so large a com∣pany, nor to be attended by such servants. Her two women bursting into tears, and loud exclamations of sorrow, she turned about to them, put her finger upon her lips, as a sign of imposing silence upon them; and having given them her blessing, desired their prayers in return. The two executioners kneeling, and asking her pardon, she said she forgave them,
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
and all the authors of her death, as freely as she hoped forgiveness from her Maker, and then once more made a solemn protestation of her innocence. Her eyes were then covered with a linen handkerchief; and she laid herself down without any fear or trepidation. Then reciting a psalm, and repeating a pious ejacu∣lation, her head was severed from her body at two strokes by the executioner. He instant∣ly held it up to the spectators, streaming with blood, and agitated with the convulsions of death; the dean of Peterborough alone ex∣claimed, <Q REND="inline">"So perish all queen Elizabeth's enemies."</Q> The earl of Kent replied Amen, while the rest of the spectators wept and sighed at this affecting spectacle; for flat∣tery and zeal alike gave place to stronger and better emotions. Thus died Mary, in the forty-fifth year of her age, and the nineteenth of her captivity, a princess unmatched in beauty, and unequalled in misfortunes. In contemplating the contentions of mankind, we find almost ever both sides culpable; Mary, who was stained with crimes that deserved pu∣nishment, was put to death by a princess who had no just pretensions to inflict punishment on her equal.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="132"/>It is difficult to be certain of the true state of Elizabeth's mind, upon receiving the first accounts of the death of Mary. Historians in general are willing to ascribe the extreme sorrow she testified on that occasion to false∣hood and deep dissimulation. But where is the necessity of ascribing to bad motives, what seems to proceed from a more generous scource? There is nothing more certain, than that, upon hearing the news, she testified the utmost surprize and indignation. Her coun∣tenance changed, her speech faltered and failed her, and she stood fixed for a long time in mute astonishment. When the first burst of sorrow was over, she still persisted in her resentment against her ministers, none of whom dared to approach her. She committed Davison to prison, and ordered him to be tried in the Star-chamber for this misdemeanor. He was condemned to imprisonment during the queen's, pleasure, and to pay a fine of ten thou∣sand pounds; in consequence of which he re∣mained a long time in custody, and the fine, though it reduced him to want and beggary, was rigorously levied upon him. It is likely therefore that Elizabeth was sincere enough in her anger for the fate of Mary; as it was an event likely to brand her reign with the cha∣racter
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
of cruelty, and though she might have desired her rival's death, yet she must certainly be shocked at the manner of it.</P>
<P>But the uneasiness the queen felt from this disagreeable forwardness of her ministry, was soon lost in one much greater. Philip, who had long meditated the destruction of Eng∣land, and whose extensive power gave him grounds to hope for success, now began to put his projects into execution. The point on which he rested his glory, and the perpetual object of his schemes, was to support the catholic religion, and exterminate the reformation. The revolt of his subjects in the Netherlands still more enflamed his resentment against the English, as they had encouraged that insur∣rection, and assisted the revolters. He had, therefore, for some time been making prepa∣rations to attack England by a powerful in∣vasion; and now every part of his vast empire resounded with the noise of armaments, and every art was used to levy supplies for that great design. The marquis of Santa Croce, a sea officer of great reputation and experi∣ence, was destined to command the fleet, which consisted of an hundred and thirty ves∣sels, of a greater size than any that had been hitherto seen in Europe. The duke of Parma
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
was to conduct the land forces, twenty thou∣sand of whom were on board the fleet, and thirty-four thousand more were assembled in the Netherlands, ready to be transported into England. The most renowned nobi∣lity and princes of Italy and Spain, were ambitious of sharing in the honour of this great enterprize. Don Amadaeus of Savoy, Don John of Medicis, Gonzaga, duke of Sabionetta, and others, hastened to join this great equipment; no doubt was entertained of its success, and it was ostentatiously styled the Invincible Armada. It carried on board, beside the land forces, eight thousand four hundred mariners, two thousand galley-slaves, and two thousand six hundred and thirty great pieces of brass ordnance. It was victualled for six months, and was attended with twenty lesser ships, called Caravals, and ten Salves, with six oars a-piece.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the terror and con∣sternation which all ranks of people felt in England upon news of this terrible Armada being under sail to invade them. A fleet of not above thirty ships of war, and those very small, in comparison, was all that was to op∣pose it by sea; and as for resisting by land, that was supposed to be impossible, as the
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
Spanish army was composed of men well dis∣ciplined, and long enured to danger. The queen alone seemed undismayed in this threat∣ening calamity; she issued all her orders with tranquility, animated her people to a steady resistance; and the more to excite the martial spirit of the nation, she appeared on horseback in the camp at Tilbury, exhorting the soldiers to their duty, and promising to share the same dangers, and the same fate with them.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I myself, cried she, will be your general, your judge, and the rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field. Your alacrity has already deserved its rewards; and on the word of a prince they shall be duly paid you. Persevere then in your obedience to command, shew your valour in the field, and we shall soon have a glorious victory over those enemies of my God, my kingdom, and my people."</Q>
The soldiers with shouts proclaimed their ardour, and only wished to be led on to conquest.</P>
<P>Nor were her preparations by sea driven on with less alacrity; although the English fleet was much inferior in number and size of ship∣ping to that of the enemy, yet it was much more manageable, the dexterity and courage of the mariners being greatly superior.
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
Lord Howard of Effingham, a man of great courage and capacity, as lord Admiral, took on him the command of the navy. Drake, Hawkins, and Frobisher, the most renowned seamen in Europe, served under him; while a small squadron consisting of forty vessels, English and Flemish, commanded by lord Seymour, lay off Dunkirk, in order to inter∣cept the duke of Parma. This was the pre∣paration made by the English, while all the protestant powers of Europe regarded this enterpize as the critical event which was to decide for ever the fate of their religion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while the Spanish Arma∣da was preparing to sail, the admiral Santa Croce died, as likewise the vice admiral Pa∣liano; and the command of the expedition was given to the duke de Medina Sidonia, a person utterly unexperienced in sea affairs; and this, in some measure, served to frustrate the design. But some other accidents also con∣tributed to its failure. Upon leaving the port of Lisbon, the Armada next day met with a violent tempest, which sunk some of the small∣est of their shipping, and obliged the fleet to put back into harbour. After some time spent in refitting, they again put to sea; where they took a fisherman, who gave them intelligence
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
that the English fleet, hearing of the dispersion of the Armada in a storm, was retired back in∣to Plymouth harbour, and most of the ma∣riners discharged. From this false intelli∣gence, the Spanish admiral, instead of going directly to the coast of Flanders, to take in the troops stationed there, as he had been instruct∣ed, resolved to sail to Plymouth, and destroy the shipping laid up in that harbour. But Ef∣fingham, the English admiral, was very well prepared to receive them; he was just got out of port when he saw the Spanish Armada com∣ing full sail towards him, disposed in the form of an half moon, and stretching seven miles from one extremity to the other. However the English admiral, seconded by Drake, Haw∣kins, and Frobisher, attacked the Armada at a distance, pouring in their broadsides with admirable dexterity. They did not chuse to engage the enemy more closely, because they were greatly inferior in the number of ships, guns, and weight of metal; nor could they pretend to board such lofty ships without ma∣nifest disadvantage. However, two Spanish galleons were disabled and taken. As the Ar∣mada advanced up the Channel, the English still followed and infested their rear; and their fleet continually encreasing from different ports,
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
they soon found themselves in a capacity to attack the Spanish fleet more nearly; and ac∣cordingly fell upon them, while they were as yet taking shelter in the port of Calais. To encrease their confusion, Howard took eight of his smaller ships, and filling them with com∣bustible materials, sent them, as if they had been fire ships, one after the other into the midst of the enemy. The Spaniards, taking them for what they seemed to be, immediately took flight in great disorder; while the Eng∣lish, profiting by their panic, took or destroyed about twelve of the enemy.</P>
<P>This was a fatal blow to Spain; the duke de Medina Sidonia being thus driven to the coast of Zealand, held a council of war, in which it was resolved, that as their ammuni∣tion began to fail, as their ships had received great damage, and the duke of Parma had re∣fused to venture his army under their protec∣tion, they should return to Spain by sailing round the Orkneys, as the winds were con∣trary to his passage directly back. Accord∣ingly they proceeded northward, and were fol∣lowed by the English fleet as far as Flambo∣rough-head, where they were terribly shattered by a storm. Seventeen of the ships, having five thousand men on board, were afterwards
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
cast away upon the western isles, and the coast of Ireland. Of the whole Armada, three and fifty ships only returned to Spain, in a miser∣able condition; and the seamen as well as sol∣diers who remained, only served, by their ac∣counts, to intimidate their countrymen from attempting to renew so dangerous an expedi∣tion.</P>
<P>These disasters of the Spanish Armada, served only to excite the spirit and courage of the English, to attempt invasions in their turn. It would be endless to relate all the advantages obtained over the enemy at sea, where the cap∣ture of every ship must have been made a sepa∣rate narrative; or their various descents upon different parts of the coast, which were attended with effects too transient for the page of history. It is sufficient to observe, that the sea captains of that reign are still considered as the boldest and most enterprizing set of men that England ever produced; and among this number, we reckon our Rawleigh, and Howard, our Drake, our Cavendish, and Hawkins. The English navy then first began to take the lead; and has since continued irresistible in all parts of the ocean.</P>
<P>Of those who made the most signal figure in these depredations upon Spain, was the
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
young earl of Essex, a nobleman of great bra∣very, generosity, and genius; and fitted, not only for the foremost ranks in war by his valour, but to conduct the intrigues of a court by his eloquence and address. But with all these en∣dowments, both of body and mind, he wanted prudence; being impetuous, haughty, and to∣tally incapable of advice or controul. The earl of Leicester had died some time before, and now left room in the queen's affections for a new favourite, which she was not long in chusing, since the merit, the bravery, and the popularity of Essex, were too great not to en∣gage her attention. Elizabeth, though she rejected an husband, yet appeared always pas∣sionately desirous of a lover; and flattery had rendered her so insensible to her want of beauty, and the depredations of age, that she still thought herself as powerful by her personal accomplishments as by her authority. The new favourite was young, active, ambitious, witty, and handsome; in the field, and at court, he always appeared with superior lustre. In all the masques which were then performed, the earl and Elizabeth were generally coupled as partners; and although she was almost sixty, and he not half so old, yet her vanity over∣looked the disparity; the world told her that she
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
was young, and she herself was willing to think so. This young earl's interest in the queen's affec∣tions, as may naturally be supposed, promoted his interests in the state; and he conducted all things at his discretion. But young and unex∣perienced as he was, he at length began to fancy that the popularity he possessed, and the flatteries he received, were given to his merits and not to his favour. His jealousy also of lord Burleigh, who was his only rival in power, made him still more untractable; and the many successes he had obtained against the Spaniards, encreased his confidence. In a debate before the queen, between him and Burleigh, about the choice of a governor for Ireland, he was so heated in the argument, that he entirely forgot both the rules and duties of civility. He turn∣ed his back on the queen in a contemptuous manner, which so provoked her resentment, that she instantly gave him a box on the ear. Instead of recollecting himself, and making the submissions due to her sex and station, he clapped his hand to his sword; and swore he would not bear such usage even from her fa∣ther. This offence, though very great, was overlooked by the queen; her partiality was so prevalent, that she re-instated him in his former favour, and her kindness seemed to
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
have acquired new force from that short in∣terruption of anger and resentment. The death also of his rival, lord Burleigh, which happen∣ed shortly after, seemed to confirm his power.</P>
<P>But though few men were possessed of Es∣sex's talents, both for war and peace, yet he had not art enough to guard against the in∣trigues of a court; his temper was too candid and open, and gave his enemies many advan∣tages over him. At that time the earl of Ty∣rone headed the rebellious natives of Ireland; who, not yet thoroughly brought into subjection to the English, took every opportunity to make incursions upon the more civilized inhabitants, and slew all they were able to overpower. To subdue these was an employment that Essex thought worthy of his ambition; nor were his enemies displeased at thus removing a man from court, where he obstructed all their private aims of preferment. But it ended in his ruin.</P>
<P>Essex, upon entering on his new command in Ireland, employed his friend, the earl of Southampton, who was long obnoxious to the queen, as general of his horse; nor was it till after repeated orders from Elizabeth, that he could be prevailed on to displace him. This indiscretion was followed by another; instead of attacking the enemy in their grand retreat
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
in Ulster, he led his forces into the province of Munster, where he only exhausted his strength, and lost his opportunity against a people that submitted at his approach, but took up arms again when he retired. It may easily be sup∣posed, that these miscarriages were urged by the enemies of Essex at home; but they had still greater reason to attack his reputation, when it was known, that instead of humbling the rebels, he had only treated with them; and instead of forcing them to a submission, he had concluded a cessation of hostilities. This issue of an enterprize, from which much was ex∣pected, did not fail to provoke the queen most sensibly; and her anger was still more height∣ened by the peevish and impatient letters, which he daily wrote to her and the council. But her resentment against him was still more justly let loose, when she found, that leaving the place of his appointment, and without any permission demanded or obtained, he had re∣turned from Ireland to make his complaints to herself in person.</P>
<P>At first, indeed, Elizabeth was pleased at see∣ing a favourite come back, whom she longed to see; but the momentary satisfaction of his unex∣pected appearance being over, she reflected on the impropriety of his conduct with greater
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
severity; and ordered him to remain a prisoner at his own house. But this was a reception Essex was not unprepared for: he used every expression of humiliation and sorrow, and tried once more, the long unpractised arts of insinuation that had brought him into favour. The queen, however, still continuing inflexible, he resolved to give up every prospect of ambition; but pre∣vious to his retiring into the country, he assured the queen, that he could never be happy till he again saw those eyes, which were used to shine upon him with such lustre; that, in expectance of that happy moment, he would, like another Nebuchadnezzar, dwell with the beasts of the field, and be wet with the dew of heaven, till she again propitiously took pity on his suffer∣ings. This romantic message, which was quite in the breeding of the times, seemed peculiarly pleasing to the queen; she thought him sincere from the consciousness of her own sincerity; she, therefore replied, that after some time, when convinced of his sincerity, something might be expected from her lenity. When these symptoms of the queen's returning af∣fection were known, they equally renewed the fears of his real enemies, and the assiduities of his pretended friends. He did not, therefore, decline an examination of his conduct before
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
the council, secure in his mistress's favour, and their impotence to do him a real injury. In consequence of this, he was only sentenced for his late misconduct, to resign his employments, and to continue a prisoner in his own house, till her majesty's further pleasure should be known.</P>
<P>He now, therefore, had, in some measure,<MILESTONE N="1600" UNIT="A.D."/> triumphed over his enemies; and the discre∣tion of a few months might have reinstated him in all his former employments; but the impetuosity of his character would not suffer him to wait for a slow redress of what he con∣sidered as wrongs; and the queen's refusing his request to continue him in the possession of a lucrative monopoly of sweet wines, which he had long enjoyed, spurred him on to the most violent and guilty measures. Having long built with fond credulity on his great popu∣larity, he began to hope, from the assistance of the giddy multitude, that revenge upon his enemies in the council, which he supposed was denied him from the throne. With these aims he began to encrease the general propen∣sity in his favour, by an hospitality little suited to his situation, or his circumstances. He en∣tertained men of all ranks and professions; but particularly the military, whom he hoped
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
in his present views might be serviceable to him. But his greatest dependence was up∣on the professions of the citizens of Lon∣don, whose schemes of religion and govern∣ment he appeared entirely to approve; and while he gratified the puritans by railing at the government of the church, he pleased the en∣vious, by exposing the faults of those in pow∣er. However the chief severity of his censure was heard to rest upon the queen, whom he did not hesitate to ridicule; and of whom he declared that she was now become an old wo∣man, and that her mind was grown as crooked as her body.</P>
<P>It may well be supposed that none of these indiscretions were concealed from the queen; his enemies, and her emissaries, took care to bring her information of all his resentments and aims, and to aggravate his slightest re∣flections into treason. Elizabeth was ever re∣markably jealous where her beauty was in question; and though she was now in her seventieth year, yet she eagerly listened to all the flattery of her courtiers, when they called her a Venus, or an Angel. She, therefore, began to consider him as unworthy of her esteem, and permitted his enemies to drive him to those extremities to which he was na∣turally
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
very well inclined to proceed. He had, in fact, by this time collected together a select council of malcontents, who flattered him in his wild projects; and, supposing their adherents much more numerous than they really were, they took no pains to conceal their intentions. Among other criminal projects, the result of blind rage and despair, they resolv∣ed at last that Sir Christopher Blount, one of his creatures, should, with a choice detach∣ment, possess himself of the palace gates; that Sir John Davis should seize the hall, Sir Charles Davers the guard-chamber, while Essex himself would rush in from the Meuse, attended by a body of his partizans, into the queen's presence, entreat her to remove his and her enemies, to assemble a new parlia∣ment, and to correct the defects of the present administration.</P>
<P>It was the fortune of this queen's reign, that all projects against it were frustrated by a timely notice of their nature and intent. The queen and council, alarmed at the great resort of people to Essex, and having some intimations of his design, sent secretary Herbert to require his appearance before the council, which was as∣sembled at the lord keeper's. While Essex was deliberating upon the manner he should
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
proceed, whether to attend the summons, or fly into open rebellion, he received a private note, by which he was warned to provide for his own safety. He now, therefore, consulted with his friends touching the emergency of their situation; they were destitute of arms and ammunition, while the guards at the palace were doubled, so that any attack upon that would be fruitless. While he and his confi∣dants were in consultation, a person, probably employed by his enemies, came in as a messen∣ger from the citizens, with tenders of friend∣ship and assistance against all his adversaries. Wild as the project was of raising the city, in the present terrible conjuncture it was resolved on, but the execution of it was delayed till the day following.</P>
<P>Early in the morning of the next day, he was attended by his friends, the earls of Rut∣land and Southampton, the lords Sandes, Parker, and Mounteagle, with three hundred persons of distinction. The doors of Essex∣house were immediately locked, to prevent all strangers from entering; and the earl now discovered his scheme for raising the city more fully to all the conspirators. In the mean time, Sir Walter Raleigh sending a message to Sir Ferdinando Gorges, this officer had a
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
conference with him in a boat on the Thames, and there discovered all their proceedings. The queen being informed of the whole, sent in the utmost haste Egerton, the lord keeper, Sir William Knollys, the controller, Popham, the lord chief justice, and the earl of Worcest∣er, to Essex house, to demand the cause of these unusual proceedings. It was some time before they received admittance through the wicket into the house; and it was not without some degree of fury, that they ordered Essex and his adherents to lay down their arms. While they continued undaunted in the discharge of their duty, and the multitude around them clamoured loudly for their pu∣nishment, the earl of Essex, who now saw that all was to be hazarded, resolved to leave them prisoners in his house, and to sally forth to make an insurrection in the city. But he had made a very wrong estimate in expecting that popularity alone could aid him in time of danger; he issued out with about two hundred followers, armed only with swords; and in his passage to the city was joined by the earl of Bedford and lord Cromwell. As he passed through the streets, he cried aloud, For the queen! for the queen! a plot is laid for my life! hoping to engage the populace to rise;
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
but they had received orders from the mayor to keep within their houses; so that he was not joined by a single person. He then pro∣ceeded to the house of Smith, the sheriff, on whose aid he greatly depended; but the crowd gathered round him rather to satisfy their cu∣riosity than to lend him any assistance. Essex now perceived that he was quite undone; and hearing that he was proclaimed a traitor by the earl of Cumberland, and lord Burleigh, he began to think of retreating to his own house, there to sell his life as dearly as he could. But he was prevented in his aims even there; the streets in his way were baricadoed, and guarded by the citizens, under the com∣mand of Sir John Levison. In fighting his way through this obstruction, Henry Tracy, a young gentleman, for whom he had a singu∣lar affection, was killed, and Sir Christopher Blount wounded and taken. The earl, him∣self, attended by a few of his followers, the rest having privately retired, made towards the river; and, taking a boat, arrived once more at Essex-house, where he began to make preparations for his defence. But his case was too desperate for any remedy from valour; wherefore, after demanding in vain for hosta∣ges, and conditions from his besigers, he sur∣rendered
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
at discretion, requesting only civil treatment, and a fair and impartial hearing.</P>
<P>Essex and Southampton were immediately carried to the archbishop's palace at Lam∣beth, from whence they were next day convey∣ed to the Tower, and tried by their peers on the nineteenth of February following. Little could be urged in their defence; their guilt was too flagrant, and though it deserved pity it could not meet an acquittal. Essex after condemnation was visited by that religious horror which seemed to attend him in all his disgraces. He was terrified almost to despair by the ghostly remonstrances of his own chap∣lain, he was reconciled to his enemies, and made a full confession of his conspiracy. It is alledged upon this occasion, that he had strong hopes of pardon, from the irresolution which the queen seemed to discover before she signed the warrant for his execution. She had given him formerly a ring, which she de∣sired him to send her in any emergency of this nature, and that it should procure his safety and protection. This ring was actually sent her by the countess of Nottingham, who, being a concealed enemy to the unfortunate earl, never delivered it; while Elizabeth secretly fired at his obstinacy in making no applica∣tions for mercy and forgiveness. The fact is,
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
she appeared herself as much an object of pity, as the unfortunate nobleman she was induced to condemn. She signed the warrant for his execution, she countermanded it, she again resolved on his death, and again felt a new re∣turn of tenderness. At last she gave her con∣sent to his execution, and was never seen to enjoy one happy day more.</P>
<P>After the beheading of Essex, which death he suffered in the thirty-fifth year of his age, some of his associates were brought in like manner to their trials. Cuffe, his secretary, a turbulent man, but possessed of great learning, Davers, Blount, Meric, and Davis, were con∣demned and executed; the queen pardoned the rest, being persuaded that they were cul∣pable only from their friendship to their bene∣factor.</P>
<P>The remaining events of this reign are not considerable enough to come into a picture, already crouded with great ones. With the death of her favourite Essex, all Elizabeth's pleasures seemed to expire; she afterwards went through the business of the state merely from habit, but her satisfactions were no more. She had fallen into a profound melancho∣ly, which all the advantages of her high for∣tune, all the glories of her prosperous reign,
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
were unable to remove. She had now found out the falsehood of the countess of Notting∣ham; who, on her death-bed, sent for the queen, and informed her of the fatal circumstance of the ring, which she had neglected to deliver. This information only served to awaken all that passion which the queen had vainly en∣deavoured to suppress. She shook the dying countess in her bed, crying out, <Q REND="inline">"That God might pardon her, but she never would."</Q> She then broke from her, and resigned herself to the dictates of her fixed despair. She refused food and sustenance; she continued silent, and gloomy; sighs, and groans, were the only vent she gave to her despondence; and she lay for ten days and nights upon the carpet, leaning on cushions, which her maids brought her. Per∣haps the faculties of her mind were impaired by long and violent exercise; perhaps she re∣flected with remorse on some past actions of her life, or perceived, but too strongly, the decays of nature, and the approach of her dissolution. She saw her courtiers remitting their assiduity to her, in order to pay their court to James, the apparent successor. Such a concurrence of causes was more than sufficient to destroy the remains of her constitution; and her end was now visibly seen to approach. Feeling a
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
perpetual heat in her stomach, attended with an unquenchable thirst, she drank without cease∣ing, but refused the assistance of her physicians. Her distemper gaining ground, Cecil, and the lord admiral, desired to know her sentiments with regard to the succession. To this she re∣plied, that as the crown of England had al∣ways been held by kings, it ought not to de∣volve upon any inferior character, but upon her immediate heir the king of Scotland. Be∣ing then advised by the archbishop of Canter∣bury to fix her thoughts upon God, she re∣plied, that her thoughts did not in the least wander from him. Her voice soon after left her; she fell into a lethargic slumber, which continued some hours, and she expired gently without a groan, in the seventieth year of her age, and the forty-fifth of her reign. Her character differed with her circumstances; in the beginning, she was moderate and humble; towards the end of her reign, haughty, and severe. But ever prudent, active, and discern∣ing, she procured for her subjects that happi∣ness, which was not entirely felt by those about her. She was indebted to her good for∣tune, that her ministers were excellent; but it was owing to her indiscretion that the favou∣rites, who were more immediately chosen by
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
herself, were unworthy. Though she was possessed of excellent sense, yet she never had the discernment to discover that she wanted beauty; and to flatter her charms at the age of sixty-five, was the surest road to her favour and esteem.</P>
<P>But whatever were her personal defects as a queen, she is to be ever remembered by the English with gratitude. It is true, indeed, that she carried her prerogative in parliament to its highest pitch; so that it was tacitly al∣lowed in that assembly, that she was above all law, and could make and unmake them at her pleasure; yet still she was so wise and good, as seldom to exert that power which she claim∣ed, and to enforce few acts of her prerogative, which were not for the benefit of the people. It is true, in like manner, that the English during her reign were put in possession of no new, or splendid acquisitions; but commerce was daily growing up among them, and the peo∣ple began to find that the theatre of their truest conquests was to be on the bosom of the ocean. A nation which hitherto had been the object of every invasion, and a prey to every plunderer, now asserted its strength in turn, and became terrible to its invaders. The successful voy∣ages of the Spaniards and Portuguese, be∣gan
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
to excite their emulation; and they fitted out several expeditions for discovering a short∣er passage to the East-Indies. The famous Sir Walter Raleigh, without any assistance from government, colonized New England, while internal commerce was making equal improve∣ments; and many Flemings, persecuted in their native country, found, together with their arts and industry, an easy asylum in England. Thus the whole island seemed as if rouzed from her long habits of barbarity; arts, com∣merce, and legislation began to acquire new strength every day; and such was the state of learning at that time, that some fix that period as the Augustan age of England. Sir Walter Raleigh, and Hooker, are considered as among the first improvers of our language. Spenser and Shakespeare are too well known, as poets, to be praised here; but of all mankind, Fran∣cis Bacon, lord Verulam, who flourished in this reign, deserves, as a philosopher, the highest applause; his style is copious and correct, and his wit is only surpassed by his learning and penetration. If we look through history, and consider the rise of kingdoms, we shall scarce find an instance of a people, becoming, in so short a time, wise, powerful, and happy. Liber∣ty, it is true, still continued to fluctuate; Eli∣zabeth
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
knew her own power, and stretched it to the very verge of despotism; but now that commerce was introduced, liberty soon after fol∣lowed; for there never was a nation perfectly commercial, that submitted long to slavery.</P>

</FIGURE> CHAP. XXVIII. JAMES I.</HEAD>
<P>JAMES, the sixth of Scotland and the first of England, the son of Mary, came to the throne with the universal approbation of all orders of the state, as in his person were unit∣ed every claim, that either descent, bequest, or parliamentary sanction could confer. He had every reason, therefore, to hope for an happy reign; and he was taught, from
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
his inafncy, that his prerogative was uncon∣troulable, and his right transmitted from hea∣ven. These sentiments he took no care to con∣ceal; and he even published them in many parts of those works, which he had written be∣fore he left Scotland.</P>
<P>But he was greatly mistaken in the spirit of thinking of the times; for new systems of go∣vernment, and new ideas of liberty, had for some time been stealing in with the reforma∣tion; and only wanted the reign of a weak or merciful monarch, to appear without controul. In consequence of the progress of knowledge, and a familiar acquaintance with the governments of antiquity, the old Gothic forms began to be despised; and an emula∣tion took place, to imitate the freedom of Greece and Rome. The severe, though popu∣lar government of Elizabeth, had confined this rising spirit within very narrow bounds; but when a new sovereign, and a new family ap∣peared, less dreaded, and less loved by the people, symptoms immediately began to be seen of a more free and independent genius in the nation.</P>
<P>James scarce was entered into England when he gave disgust to many. The desire in all to see their new sovereign was ardent and na∣tural;
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
but the king, who loved retirement, forbid the concourse that attended on his jour∣ney from Scotland, pretending that this great resort of people would produce a scarcity of provisions. To this offence to the people he added, soon after, what gave offence to the higher orders of the state, by prostituting titles of honour, so that they became so common as to be no longer marks of distinction. A pas∣quinade was fixed up at St. Paul's, declaring that there would be a lecture given on the art of assisting short memories, to retain the names of the new nobility.</P>
<P>But though his countrymen shared a part of these honours, yet justice must be done the king, by confessing, that he left almost all the great offices in the hands he found them. Among these, Cecil, created earl of Salisbury, who had been so active in the last reign against his own interests, was continued now prime minister and chief counsellor. This crafty statesman had been too cunning for the rest of his associates; and while, during Elizabeth's reign, he was apparently leagued against the earl of Essex whom James protected, yet he kept up a secret corrospondence with that mo∣narch, and secured his interests without for∣feiting the confidence of his party.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="161"/>But it was not so fortunate with lord Grey, lord Cobham, and Sir Walter Raleigh, who had been Cecil's associates. They felt imme∣diately the effects of the king's displeasure, and were dismissed their employments. These three seemed to be marked out for peculiar indig∣nation, for soon after they were accused of en∣tering into a conspiracy against the king; nei∣ther the proofs of which, nor its aims, have reached posterity: all that is certain is, that they were condemned to die, but had their sentence mitigated by the king. Cobham and Grey were pardoned, after they had laid their heads on the block. Raleigh was reprieved, but remained in confinement many years after∣wards, and at last suffered for this offence, which was never proved.</P>
<P>This mercy, shewn to these supposed delin∣quents, was very pleasing to the people; and the king, willing to remove all jealousy of his being a stranger, began his attempts in parlia∣ment by an endeavour to unite both king∣doms into one. However, the people were not as yet ripe for this coalition; they were ap∣prehensive that the posts and employments, which were in the gift of the court, would be conferred on the Scotch, whom they were as yet taught to regard as foreigners. By the
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
repulse in this instance, as well as by some ex∣ceptions, the house of commons took to the form of his summons to parliament, James found that the people he came to govern, were very different from those he had left behind; and perceived that he must give reasons for every measure he intended to enforce.</P>
<P>He now, therefore, attempted to correct his former mistake, and to peruse the English laws, as he had formerly done those of his own country, and by these he resolved to govern. But even here he again found himself disap∣pointed. In a government so fluctuating as that of England, opinion was ever deviating from law; and what was enacted in one reign, was contradicted by custom in another. The laws had all along declared in favour of an al∣most unlimited prerogative, while the opi∣nions of the people were guided by instructors, who began to teach opposite principles. All the kings and queens before him, except such as were controuled by intestine divisions, or awed by foreign invasion, issued rather their commands to parliament, than gave their rea∣sons. James, unmindful of this alteration in the opinions of the people, resolved to govern in the ancient manner; while the people, on the contrary, having once got an idea of the
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
inherent privileges of mankind, never gave it up, sensible that they had reason and power also on their side.</P>
<P>Numberless, therefore, were the disputes between the king and his parliament during his whole reign; one attempting too keep the privileges of the crown entire, the other aiming at abridging the dangerous part of the preroga∣tive; the one labouring to preserve customs established for time immemorial, the other equally assiduous in defending the inherent privileges of humanity. Thus we see laud∣able motives actuating the disputants on both sides of the question, and the principles of both founded either in law or in reason. When the parliament would not grant a subsidy, James had examples enough among his pre∣decessors, which taught him to extort a bene∣volence. Edward the fourth, Henry the eighth, and queen Elizabeth herself, had often done so; and precedent undoubtedly entitled him to the same privilege. On the other hand, the house of commons, who found their growing power to protect the people, and not suffer the impositions of the crown, considered that this extorted benevolence might at length render the sovereign entirely independent of the parliament, and therefore
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
complained against it as an infringement of their privileges. These attempts of the crown, and these murmurings of the commons, con∣tinued through this whole reign, and first gave rise to that spirit of party, which has ever since subsisted in England; the one for preserving the ancient constitution, by main∣taining the prerogative of the king; the other for trying an experiment to improve it, by extending the liberties of the people.</P>
<P>During these contests, James, who sup∣posed no arguments sufficient to impair the prerogative, seemed entirely secure that none would attempt to alledge any. He daily continued to entertain his parliament with set speeches, and florid harrangues, in which he urged his divine right and absolute power as things incontestible; to these the commons made as regular answers, not abso∣lutely denying his pretensions, but slowly and regularly abridging his power.</P>
<P>However, tho' James persevered in asserting his prerogative, and threatened those who should presume to abridge it, yet his justice and clem∣ency were very apparent in the toleration which he gave to the teachers of different religions throughout the kingdom. The minds of the people had long been irritated
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
against one another, and each party persecuted the rest, as it happened to prevail; it was ex∣pected, therefore, that James would streng∣then the hands of that which was then upper∣most; and that the catholics and sectaries should find no protection. But this monarch wisely observed, that men should be punished for actions, and not for opinions; a decision which gave general dissatisfaction: but the universal complaint of every sect was the best argument of his moderation towards all.</P>
<P>Yet mild as this monarch was, there was a project contrived in the very beginning of his reign for the re-establishment of popery, which, were it not a fact known to all the world, could scarcely be credited by posterity. This was the gun-powder plot, than which a more hor∣rid or terrible scheme never entered into the human heart to conceive, and which shews at once the most determined courage may be united with the most execrable intentions.</P>
<P>The Roman catholics had expected great favour and indulgence on the accession of James, both as a descendant from Mary, a rigid catholic, and also as having shewn some partiality to that religion in his youth. But they soon discovered their mistake; and were at once surprised and enraged to find James
<PB N="164" REF="166"/>
on all occasions express his resolution of strict∣ly executing the laws enacted against them, and of persevering in the conduct of his predecessor. This declaration determined them upon more desperate measures; and they at length formed a resolution of destroy∣ing the king and both houses of parliament at a blow. The scheme was first broached by Robert Catesby, a gentleman of good parts and ancient family, who conceived that a train of gun-powder might be so placed under the parliament-house, as to blow up the king and all the members at once. He opened his intention to Thomas Percy, a descendant from the illustrious house of Northumberland, who was charmed with the project, and readily came into it. Thomas Winter was next en∣trusted with the dreadful secret; and he went over to Flanders in quest of Guy Fawkes, an officer in the Spanish service, with whose zeal and courage the conspirators were thoroughly acquainted. When they enlisted any new zealot into their plot, the more firmly to bind him to secrecy, they always, together with an oath, employed the sacrament, the most sacred rite of religion. Every tender feeling and all pity were banished from their breasts; and Tesmond and Garnet, two jesuits, superiors
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
of the order, absolved their consciences from every scruple.</P>
<P>How horrid soever the contrivance might appear, yet every member seemed faithful and secret in the league; and about two months before the sitting of parliament, they hired an house, in Percy's name, adjoining to that in which the parliament was to assemble. Their first intention was to bore a way under the parliament-house, from that which they occu∣pied, and they set themselves laboriously to the task; but when they had pierced the wall, which was three yards in thickness, on ap∣proaching the other side, they were surprised to find that the house was vaulted underneath, and that a magazine of coals were usually deposited there. From their disappointment on this account they were soon relieved, by information that the coals were then selling off, and that the vaults would be then let to the highest bidder. They therefore seized the opportunity of hiring the place, and bought the remaining quantity of coals with which it was then stored, as if for their own use. The next thing done was to convey thither thirty-six barrels of gun-powder, which had been purchased in Holland; and the whole was covered with the coals and with faggots
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
brought for that purpose. Then the doors of the cellar were boldly flung open, and every body admitted, as if it contained nothing dangerous.</P>
<P>Confident of success, they now began to plan the remaining part of their project. The king, the queen, and prince Henry, the king's eldest son, were all expected to be present at the opening of the parliament. The king's second son, by reason of his tender age, would be absent, and it was resolved that Percy should seize, or assassinate him. The prin∣cess Elizabeth, a child likewise, was kept at lord Harrington's house in Warwickshire; and Sir Everard Digby was to seize her, and immediately proclaim her queen.</P>
<P>The day for the sitting of parliament now approached. Never was treason more secret, or ruin more apparently inevitable; the hour was expected with impatience, and the conspi∣rators gloried in their meditated guilt. The dreaful secret, though communicated to above twenty persons, had been religiously kept during the space of near a year and an half; when all the motives of pity, justice, and safety, were too weak, a remorse of private friendship saved the kingdom.</P>
<P>Sir Henry Percy, one of the conspirators,
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
conceived a design of saving the life of lord Mounteagle, his intimate friend and compa∣nion, who also was of the same persuasion with himself. About ten days before the meeting of parliament, this nobleman, upon his return to town, received a letter from a person unknown, and delivered by one who fled as soon as he had discharged his message. The letter was to this effect,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My Lord, stay away from this parliament; for God and man have concurred to punish the wicked∣ness of the times. And think not slightly of this advertisement, but retire yourself in∣to your country, where you may expect the event in safety. For though there be no appearance of any stir, yet I say they will receive a terrible blow this parliament; and yet they shall not see who hurts them. This counsel is not to be contemned, be∣cause it may do you good, and can do you no harm. For the danger is past as soon as you have burned the letter."</Q></P>
<P>The contents of this mysterious letter sur∣prised and puzzled the nobleman to whom it was addressed; and though inclined to think it a foolish attempt to affright and ridicule him, yet he judged it safest to carry it to lord Salisbury, secetary of state. Lord Salisbury
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
too was inclined to give little attention to it, yet thought proper to lay it before the king in council, who came to town a few days after. None of the council were able to make any thing of it, although it appeared serious and alarming. In this universal agitation be∣tween doubt and apprehension, the king was the first who penetrated the meaning of this dark epistle. He concluded that some sudden danger was preparing by gun-powder; and it was thought adviseable to inspect all the vaults below the houses of parliament. This care belonged to the earl of Suffolk, lord cham∣berlain, who purposely delayed the search, till the day before the meeting of parliament.<MILESTONE N="Nov. 5, 1605."/> He remarked those great piles of faggots which lay in the vault under the house of peers; and he cast his eye upon Fawkes, who stood in a dark corner, and who passed himself for Percy's servant. That daring determined courage, which he had long been noted for, even among the desperate, was fully painted in his countenance, and struck the lord chamberlain with strong suspicion. The great quantity of fuel also kept there for the uses of a person seldom in town, did not pass unnoticed; and he resolved to take his time to make a more exact scrutiny. About mid∣night,
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
therefore, Sir Thomas Knevit, a justice of peace, was sent with proper attendants, and, just at the entrance of the vault, he seized a man preparing for the terrible enterprize, dressed in a cloak and boots, and a dark lan∣thorn in his hand. This was no other than Guy Fawkes, who had just disposed every part of the train for its taking fire the next morning, the matches and other combustibles being found in his pockets. The whole of the design was now discovered; but the atro∣ciousness of his guilt, and the despair of par∣don, inspiring him with resolution, he told the officers of justice, with an undaunted air, that had he blown them and himself up together he had been happy. Before the council he displayed the same intrepid firmness, mixt even with scorn and disdain, refusing to disco∣ver his associates, and shewing no concern but for the failure of his enterprize. But his bold spirit was at length subdued; being confined to the Tower for two or three days, and the rack just shewn him, his courage, fatigued with so long an effort, at last failed him, and he made a full discovery of all his accomplices.</P>
<P>Catesby, Percy, and the conspirators who were in London, hearing that Fawkes was
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
arrested, fled with all speed to Warwickshire, where Sir Everard Digby, relying on the suc∣cess of the plot, was already in arms, in order to seize the princess Elizabeth. But the country soon began to take the alarm, and wherever they turned, they found a superior force ready to oppose them. In this exigence, beset on all sides, they resolved, to about the number of eighty persons, to fly no farther, but make a stand at an house in Warwickshire, to defend it to the last, and sell their lives as dearly as possible. But even this miserable consolation was denied them: a spark of fire happening to fall among some gun-powder that was laid to dry, it blew up, and so maimed the principal conspirators, that the survivors resolved to open the gate, and sally out a∣gainst the multitude that surrounded the house. Some were instantly cut to pieces; Catesby, Percy, and Winter, standing back to back, fought long and desperately, till in the end the two first fell covered with wounds, and Winter was taken alive. Those that survived the slaughter were tried and con∣victed; several fell by the hands of the execu∣tioner, and others experienced the king's mer∣cy. The jesuits, Garnet and Oldcorn, who were privy to the plot, suffered with the rest;
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
and, notwithstanding the atrociousness of their treason, Garnet was considered by his party as a martyr, and miracles were said to have been wrought by his blood.</P>
<P>Such was the end of a conspiracy that brought ruin on its contrivers, and utterly supplanted that religion it was intended to establish. Yet it is remarkable, that before this audacious attempt, the conspirators had always borne a fair reputation; Catesby was loved by all his acquaintance, and Digby was as highly respected both for his honour and integrity as any man in the nation. However, such are the lengths that superstition and early prejudice can drive minds originally well form∣ed, but impressed by a wrong direction.</P>
<P>The king's moderation, after the extinction of this conspiracy, was as great as his penetra∣tion in the prevention of it. The hatred ex∣cited in the nation against the catholics knew no bounds; and nothing but a total extinction of those who adhered to that persuasion, seem∣ed capable of satisfying the greater part of the people. James bravely rejected all violent measures, and nobly declared, that the late conspiracy, however atrocious, should never alter his plans of government; but as, on the one hand, he was determined to punish guilt,
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
so, on the other, he would still support and protect innocence.</P>
<P>This moderation, however laudable, was at that time no way pleasing to the people, and the malignant part of his subjects were willing to ascribe his lenity to the papists, to his being himself tinctured with their superstitions. However this be, he still found his parliaments refractory to all the measures he took to sup∣port his authority at home, or his desire of peace with foreign states. His speeches in∣deed betrayed no want of resolution to defend his rights; but his liberality to his favourites, and the insufficiency of his finances to maintain the royal dignity, still rendered him dependent upon his parliament for money, and they took care to keep him in indigence. Thus he was often forced into concessions, which, when once granted, could never be recalled; and while he supposed himself maintaining the royal prerogative, it was diminishing on every side.</P>
<P>It was, perhaps, the opposition which James met with from his people, that made him place his affections upon different persons about the court, whom he rewarded with a liberality that bordered on profusion. The
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
death of young prince Henry, his eldest son, which happened at this time,<MILESTONE N="1612" UNIT="A.D."/> a youth of great hopes, gave him no very great uneasiness, as his affections were rather taken up by newer con∣nexions. In the first rank of these stood Robert Carre, a youth of a good family in Scotland, who, after having passed some time in his travels, arrived in London, at about twenty years of age. All his natural accom∣plishments consisted in a pleasing visage; all his acquired abilities, in an easy and graceful demeanor. This youth came to England with letters of recommendation to see his countryman, lord Hay; and that nobleman took an opportunity of assigning him the of∣fice of presenting the king his buckler at a match of tilting. When Carre was advancing to execute his office, he was thrown by his horse, and his leg was broke in the king's presence. James approached him with pity and concern, and ordered him to be lodged in the palace till his cure was completed. He himself, after tilting, paid him a visit in his chamber, and returned frequently during his confinement. The ignorance and simplicity of the youth confirmed the king's affections, as he disregarded learning in his favourites, of which he found but very little use in his own
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
practice. Carre was therefore soon considered as the most rising man at court; he was knighted, created viscount Rochester, honour∣ed with the order of the garter, made a privy-counsellor; and, to raise him to the highest pitch of honour, he was at last created earl of Somerset.</P>
<P>This was an advancement which some re∣garded with envy; but the wiser part of man∣kind looked upon it with contempt and ridi∣cule, sensible that ungrounded attachments are seldom of long continuance. Nor was it long before the favourite gave proofs of his being unworthy the place he held in the king's affections. Among the friends whom he con∣sulted at court was Sir Thomas Overbury, a man of great abilities and learning; among the mistresses whom he addressed was the young countess of Essex, whose husband had been sent by the king's command to travel, until the young couple should be arrived at the age of puberty. But the assiduities of a man of such personal ac∣complishments as the favourite were too pow∣erful to be resisted; a criminal corespondence was commenced between the countess and the earl; and Essex, upon his return from his travels, found his wife beautiful and lovely indeed, but her affections entirely placed upon
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
another. But this was not all; not contented with denying him all the rights of an husband, she was resolved to procure a divorce, and then to marry the favourite, to whom she had granted her heart. It was upon this occasion that Overbury was consulted by his friend; and that this honest counsellor declared him∣self utterly averse to the match. He describ∣ed the countess as an infamous and abandon∣ed woman; and went so far as to threaten the earl that he would separate himself from him for ever, if he could so far forget his honour and his interest as to prosecute the intended marriage. The consequence of this advice was fatal to the giver. The countess, being made acquainted with his expostulations, urged her lover to undo him. In consequence of this command, the king was persuaded by the favourite to order Overbury on an embassy into Russia; Overbury was persuaded by the same adviser to refuse going; the delin∣quent was shut up in the Tower, and there he was poisoned, by the direction of the coun∣tess, in a tart.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the divorce which had been with some difficulty procured, took place, and the marriage of the favourite was solemnized with all imaginable splendour. But the
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
suspicion of Overbury's being poisoned every day grew stronger, and reached the favourite, amidst all the glare and splendor of seeming happiness and success. The graces of his youth gradually disappeared; the gaiety of his manners were converted into sullen silence; and the king, whose affections had been en∣gaged by these superficial accomplishments, began to cool to a man who no longer con∣tributed to his amusement. But the adoption of another favourite, and the discovery of Somerset's guilt, soon removed all remains of affection, which the king might still harbour for him.</P>
<P>An apothecary's apprentice, who had been employed in making up the poison, having retired to Flushing, had divulged the secret there; and the affair being thus laid before the king, he commanded Sir Edward Coke, lord chief justice, to sift the affair to the bottom, with rigorous impartiality. This injunction was exe∣cuted with great industry and severity; and the whole complication of their guilt was careful∣ly unravelled. The lieutenant of the Tower, with some of the lesser criminals, were con∣demned and executed; Somerset and his countess were soon after found guilty, but reprieved, and pardoned after some years of
<PB N="177" REF="179"/>
strict confinement. The king's duplicity and injustice on this occasion are urged as very great stains upon his character. Somerset was in his presence at the time the officer of justice came to apprehend him; and boldly reprehended that minister's presumption for daring to arrest a peer of the realm before the king. But James being informed of the cause, said, with a smile,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nay, nay, you must go; for if Coke should send for my∣self, I must comply."</Q>
He then embraced him at parting, begged he would return im∣mediately, and assured him he could not live without his company: yet he had no sooner turned his back, than he exclaimed,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Go, and the devil go with thee, I shall never see thy face again."</Q>
He was also heard to wish, some time after, that God's curse might fall upon him and his family, if he should pardon those whom the law should condemn; however, he afterwards restored them both to liberty, and granted them a pension, with which they retired, and languish∣ed out the remainder of their lives in guilt, infamy, and mutual recrimination.</P>
<P>But the king had not been so improvident as to part with one favourite until he had provided himself with another. This was
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
George Villiers, a youth of one and twenty, a younger brother of a good family, who was re∣turned about that time from his travels, and whom the enemies of Somerset had taken occasion to throw in the king's way, certain that his beau∣ty and fashionable manners would do the rest. Accordingly, he had been placed at a comedy full in the king's view, and immediately caught the monarch's affections. The history of these times, which appears not without some degree of malignity against this monarch, does not however insinuate any thing flagitious in these connexions, but imputes his attach∣ment rather to a weakness of understanding, than to any perversion of appetite. Villiers was immediately taken into the king's service, and the office of cup-bearer was bestowed upon him. It was in vain that Somerset had used all his interest to depress him; his stern jealou∣sy only served the more to interest the king in the young man's behalf.</P>
<P>But after Somerset's fall, the favour of James was wholly turned upon young Vil∣liers; in the course of a few years he created him viscount Villiers, earl, marquis, and duke of Buckingham, knight of the garter, master of the horse, chief justice in Eyre, warden of the cinque ports, master of the king's bench
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
office, steward of Westminster, constable of Windsor, and lord high admiral of England. His mother obtained the title of countess of Buckingham; his brother was created viscount Purbeck; and a numerous train of needy re∣lations were all pushed up into credit and au∣thority. It may, indeed be reckoned among the most capricious circumstances of this mo∣narch's reign, that he, who was bred a scholar, should chuse for his favourites the most illiter∣ate persons about his court; that he, whose personal courage was greatly suspected, should lavish his honours upon those whose only ac∣complishments were a skill in the warlike exer∣cises of the times.</P>
<P>When unworthy favourites were thus ad∣vanced, it is not to be wondered at if the pub∣lic concerns of the kingdom were neglected, and men of real merit left to contempt and mi∣sery. Yet such was the case at present, with regard to the cautionary towns in Holland, and the brave Sir Walter Raleigh at home.</P>
<P>In the preceding reign, Elizabeth, when she gave assistance to the Dutch, at that time shak∣ing off the Spanish yoke, was not so disin∣terested upon her lending them large sums of money, as not to require a proper deposit for being repaid. The Dutch, therefore, put
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
into her hands the three important fortresses of Flushing, Brille, and Ramekins, which were to be restored upon payment of the money due, which amounted in the whole to above eight hundred thousand pounds. But James, in his present exigence, being to supply a needy favourite and a craving court, agreed to evacuate these fortresses, upon being paid a third part of the money that was strictly due. The cautionary towns, therefore, were eva∣cuated, which had held the states in total sub∣jection; and which an ambitious or enterprize∣ing prince would have regarded as his most valuable possessions.</P>
<P>The universal murmur which this impolitic measure produced, was soon after heightened by an act of severity, which still continues as the blackest stain upon this monarch's me∣mory. The brave and learned Raleigh had been confined in the Tower almost from the very beginning of James's accession, for a con∣spiracy which had never been proved against him; and in that abode of wretchedness he wrote several valuable performances, which are still in the highest esteem. His long sufferings, and his ingenious writings, had now turned the tide of popular opinion in his favour; and they who once detested the enemy of Essex,
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
could not now help pitying the long captivity of this philosophical soldier. He himself still struggled for freedom; and perhaps it was with this desire that he spread the report of his having discovered a gold mine in Guiana, which was sufficient to enrich, not only the ad∣venturers who should seize it, but afford im∣mense treasures to the nation. The king, ei∣ther believing his assertions, or willing to sub∣ject him to further disgrace, granted him a commission to try his fortune in quest of these golden schemes; but still reserved his former sentence as a check upon his future behaviour.</P>
<P>Raleigh was not long in making prepara∣tions for this adventure, which, from the san∣guine manner in which he carried it on, many believe he thought to be as promising as he described it. He bent his course to Guiana, and remaining himself at the mouth of the river Oroonoko, with five of the largest ships, he sent the rest up the stream, under the com∣mand of his son and of captain Keymis, a per∣son entirely devoted to his interests. But instead of a country abounding in gold, as the adven∣turers were taught to expect, they found the Spaniards had been warned of their approach, and were prepared in arms to receive them.
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
Young Raleigh, to encourage his men, called out that <Q REND="inline">"This was the true mine,"</Q> meaning the town of St. Thomas, which he was ap∣proaching; <Q REND="inline">"and that none but fools looked for any other:"</Q> but just as he was speaking, he received a shot, of which he immediately ex∣pired. This was followed by another disap∣pointment, for when the English took posses∣sion of the town they found nothing in it of any value.</P>
<P>It was Keymis who pretended that he had seen the mine, and gave the first account of it to Raleigh; but he now began to retract, and though he was within two hours march of the place, he refused, on the most absurd pre∣tences, to take any effectual step towards find∣ing it. He returned, therefore, to Raleigh with the melancholy news of his son's death; and then going into his cabbin, put an end to his own life in despair.</P>
<P>Raleigh, in this forlorn situation, found now that all his hopes were over; but saw his mis∣fortunes still farther aggravated by the re∣proaches of those whom he had undertaken to command. Nothing could be more deplorable than his situation, particularly when he was told that he must be carried back to England to answer for his conduct to the king. It is pretended
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
that he employed many artifices, first to engage them to attack the Spanish settlements at a time of peace; and failing of that, to make his escape into France. But all these proving unsuccessful, he was delivered into the king's hands, and strictly examined, as well as his fellow adventurers, before the privy-council. Count Gondemar, the Spanish ambassador, made heavy complaints against the expedition; and the king declared that Raleigh had ex∣press orders to avoid all disputes and hosti∣lities against the Spaniards. Wherefore, to give the court of Spain a particular instance of his attachment, he signed the warrant for his execution, not for the present offence, but for his former conspiracy. Thus shew∣ing himself guilty of complicated injustice; unjust in originally having condemned him without proof; unjust in having trusted a man with a commission without a pardon, expressive of that confidence; unjust in punishing with death a transgression that did not deserve it; but most unjust of all, when he refused a new trial, but condemned him upon an obsolete sentence. This great man died with the same fortitude that he had testified through life; he observed, as he felt the edge of the ax, that it was a sharp, but a sure remedy for all evils;
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
his harangue to the people was calm and elo∣quent; and he laid his head down on the block with the utmost indifference. His death en∣sured him that popularity, which his former intrepidity and his sufferings, so much greater than his crimes, had tended to procure him; and no measure, in this reign, was attended with so much public dissatisfaction. The death of this great man was soon after followed by the disgrace of a still greater, namely, the chan∣cellor Bacon, who was accused of receiving bribes in his office; and, pleading guilty, was degraded and fined thirty thousand pounds; but his fine was afterwards remitted by the king.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1618" UNIT="A.D."/> But there soon appeared very apparent rea∣sons for James's partiality to the court of Spain, in the case of Raleigh. This monarch had entertained an opinion which was peculiar to himself, that in marrying his son Charles, the prince of Wales, any alliance below that of royalty would be unworthy of him; he, there∣fore, was obliged to seek, either in the court of France or Spain, a suitable match, and he was taught to think of the latter. Gonde∣mar, who was ambassador from that court, perceiving this weak monarch's partiality to a crowned head, made an offer of the second
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
daughter of Spain to prince Charles; and that he might render the temptation irresistible, he gave hopes of an immense fortune which should attend the princess. However this was a negotiation that was not likely soon to be concluded; and from the time the idea was first started, James saw five years elapsed with∣out bringing the treaty to any kind of conclu∣sion.</P>
<P>A delay of this kind was very displeasing to the king, who had all along an eye on the great fortune of the princess; nor was it less disagreeable to prince Charles, who, bred up with ideas of romantic passion, was in love without ever seeing the object of his affections. In this general tedium of delay, a project en∣tered the head of Villiers, who had for some years ruled the king with absolute authority, that was fitter to be conceived by the knight of a romance, than by a minister and a states∣man. It was nothing less, than that the prince should himself travel in disguise into Spain, and visit the object of his affections in person. Buckingham, who wanted to ingratiate him∣self with the prince, offered to be his compa∣nion; and the king, whose business it was to check so wild a scheme, gave his consent to this hopeful proposal. Their adventures on this
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>
project could fill novels; and have actually been made the subject of many. Charles was the knight-errant, and Buckingham was his 'squire. They travelled through France in disguise, assuming the names of Jack and Tom Smith. They went to a ball at Paris, where the prince first saw the princess Henrietta, whom he afterwards married, and who was then in the bloom of youth and beauty. They were received at the court of Spain with all possible demonstrations of respect; but Buck∣ingham filled the whole city with intrigues, adventures, serenades, challenges, and jealou∣sy. To complete the catalogue of his follies, he fell in love with the dutchess of Olivarez, the prime minister's wife, and insulted that minister in person. These levities were not to be endured at such a court as that of Spain, where jealousy is so prevalent, and decorum so much observed; the match therefore broke off, for what reason historians do not assign; but if we may credit the novelists of that time, the prince had already fixed his affections upon the French princess.</P>
<P>In fact, a match for this prince was soon after negotiated with Henrietta, who was the daughter of the great Henry the fourth; and this met with much better success than the
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>
former. However, the king had not the same allurements in prosecuting this match as the former, as the portion promised him was much smaller; but willing that his son should not be altogether disappointed of a bride, as the king of France demanded only the same terms which had been offered to the court of Spain, James consented to comply. In an article of this treaty of marriage it was stipulated, that the education of the children, till the age of thirteen, should belong to the mother; and this probably gave that turn towards popery, which has since been the ruin of that unfortu∣nate family.</P>
<P>Indeed a variety of causes seemed to con∣spire, together with their own imprudence, to bring down upon them those evils which they afterwards experienced. The house of com∣mons was by this time become quite unma∣nageable; the prodigality of James to his fa∣vourites, had made his necessities so many, that he was contented to sell the different branches of his prerogative to the commons, one after the other, to procure supplies. In proportion as they perceived his wants, they found out new grievances; and every grant of money was sure to come with a petition for redress. The struggles between him and his
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
parliament had been growing more and more violent every session; and the very last ad∣vanced their pretensions to such a degree, that he began to take the alarm; but these evils fell upon the successor, which the weak∣ness of this monarch had contributed to give birth to.</P>
<P>These domestic troubles were attended by others still more important in Germany, and which produced in the end the most dangerous effects. The king's eldest daughter had been married to Frederic, the elector Palatine of Germany, and this prince revolting against the emperor Ferdinand the second, was defeated in a decisive battle, and obliged to take re∣fuge in Holland. His affinity to the English crown, his misfortunes, but particularly the protestant religion, for which he had contend∣ed, were strong motives for the people of England to wish well to his cause; and fre∣quent addresses were sent from the commons to spur up James to take a part in the Ger∣man contest, and to replace the exiled prince upon the throne of his ancestors.<MILESTONE N="1620" UNIT="A.D."/> James at first attempted to ward off the misfortunes of his son-in-law by negotiations; but these prov∣ing utterly ineffectual, it was resolved at last to rescue the Palatinate from the emperor by
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
force of arms. Accordingly war was declared against Spain and the emperor; six thousand men were sent over into Holland, to assist prince Maurice in his schemes against those powers; the people were every where elated at the courage of their king, and were satisfied with any war which was to exterminate the papists. This army was followed by another consisting of twelve thousand men, commanded by count Mansfeldt, and the court of France promised its assistance. But the English were disap∣pointed in all their views: the troops being embarked at Dover, upon sailing to Calais, they found no orders for their admission. After waiting in vain for some time, they were obliged to sail towards Zealand, where no pro∣per measures were yet consulted for their dis∣embarkation. Mean while, a pestilential dis∣temper crept in among the forces, so long cooped up in narrow vessels; half the army died while on board, and the other half, weakened by sickness, appeared too small a body to march into the Palatinate; and thus ended this ill-concerted and fruitless expedi∣tion.</P>
<P>Whether this misfortune had any effect upon the constitution of the king is uncertain; but he was soon after seized with a tertian ague,<MILESTONE N="1625" UNIT="A.D."/>
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>
which, when his courtiers assured him from the proverb that it was health for a king, he replied, that the proverb was meant for a young king. After some fits he found himself ex∣tremely weakened, and sent for the prince, whom he exhorted to persevere in the pro∣testant religion; then preparing with decency and courage to meet his end, he expired, af∣ter a reign over England of twenty-two years, and in the fifty-ninth year of his age. With regard to foreign negotiations, James neither understood nor cultivated them; and perhaps in a kingdom so situated as England, domestic politics are alone sufficient. His reign was marked with none of the splendors of triumph, nor no new conquests or acqui∣sitions; but the arts were nevertheless silently and successfully going on to improvement. Reason was extending her influence, and disco∣vering to mankind a thousand errors in reli∣gion, in morals, and in government, that had long been reverenced by blind submission. The reformation had produced a spirit of liberty, as well as of investigation, among all ranks of mankind, and taught them that no precedents could sanctify fraud, tyranny, or injustice. James taught them by his own example to argue upon the nature of the king's prerogative, and the ex∣tent
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
of the subjects liberty. He first began by setting up the prescriptive authority of kings against the natural privileges of the people; but when the subject was submitted to a con∣troversy, it was soon seen that the monarch's was the weakest side.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1625" UNIT="A.D."/> FEW princes have ascended a throne with more apparent advantages than Charles; and none ever encountered more real difficulties. The advantages were such as might flatter even the most cautious prince into security; the difficulties were such as no abilities could surmount. He found himself, upon coming to the crown, possessed of a peaceful and flou∣rishing
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
kingdom; his right undisputed by all the world, his power strengthened by an alli∣ance with one of the most potent nations in Europe, his absolute authority tacitly acknow∣ledged by one part of his subjects, and en∣forced from the pulpit by the rest. To add to all this he was loved by his people, whose hearts he had gained by his virtues, his humi∣lity, and his candour.</P>
<P>But on the opposite side of the picture we are presented with a very different scene. Men had begun to think on the different rights of mankind; and found, that all had an equal claim to the inestimable blessings of freedom. The spirit of liberty was roused; and it was resolved to oppose the ancient claims of mo∣narchs, who usurped their power in times of ignorance or danger, and who pleaded in suc∣ceeding times their former depredations as prescriptive privileges. Charles had been taught from his infancy to consider the royal preroga∣tive as a sacred pledge, which it was not in his power to alienate, much less his duty to a∣bridge. His father, who had contributed so much to sink the claims of the crown, had nevertheless boldly defended them in his writ∣ings, and taught his son to defend by the sword what he had only inculcated by the
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
press. Charles, though a prince of tolerable understanding, had not comprehension enough to see, that the genius and disposition of his people had received a total change; he re∣solved, therefore, to govern by old maxims and precedents, a people who had lately found out that these maxims were established in times of ignorance and slavery.</P>
<P>In the foregoing reigns I have given very little of the parliamentary history of the times, which would have led me out of the way; but in the present it will be fit to point out the transactions of every parliament, as they make the principal figure in this remarkable aera, in which we see genius and courage united in op∣posing injustice, seconded by custom, and backed by power.</P>
<P>Charles undertook the reins of government with a fixed persuasion that his popularity was sufficient to carry every measure. He had been loaded with a treaty for defending the Palati∣nate in the late reign; and the war declared for that purpose was to be carried on with vi∣gour in this. But war was more easily de∣clared than supplies granted. After some re∣luctance the commons voted him two subsi∣dies; a sum far from being sufficient to sup∣port him in his intended equipment, to assist
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
his brother-in-law; and to this was added a petition for punishing papists, and redressing the grievances of the nation. Buckingham, who had been the late king's favourite, and who was still more caressed by the present mo∣narch, did not escape their censures; so that instead of granting the sums requisite, they employed the time in disputations and com∣plaints, till the season for prosecuting the in∣tended campaign was elapsed. Charles, there∣fore, wearied with their delays, and offended at their refusal of his demands,<MILESTONE N="1625" UNIT="A.D."/> thought pro∣per to dissolve a parliament which he could not bring to reason.</P>
<P>To supply the want of parliamentary aids, Charles had recourse to some of the ancient methods of extortion, practised by sovereigns when in necessitous circumstances. That kind of tax called a benevolence was ordered to be exacted, and privy-seals were issued accord∣ingly. In order to cover the rigour of this step, it was commanded, that none should be asked for money but such as were able to spare it; and he directed letters to different persons, mentioning the sums he desired. With this the people were obliged, though reluctantly, to comply; it was in fact authorised by many precedents; but no precedents whatsoever could give a sanction to injustice.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="198"/>With this money a fleet was equipped a∣gainst Spain, carrying ten thousand men, the command of which army was entrusted to lord Wimbleton, who sailed directly to Ca∣diz, and found the bay full of ships of great value. But he failed in making himself mas∣ter of the harbour, while his undisciplined army landing, instead of attacking the town, could not be restrained from indulging them∣selves in the wine, which they found in great abundance on shore. Further stay, therefore, appearing fruitless, they were re-imbarked; and the plague attacking the fleet soon after∣wards, they were obliged to abandon all hopes of success, and return to England. Loud complaints were made against the court, for entrusting so important a command to a person who was judged so unqualified for the under∣taking.</P>
<P>This ineffectual expedition was a great blow to the court; and to retrieve the glory of the nation, another attempt was to be made, but with a more certain prospect of success. New supplies therefore being requisite, the king was resolved to obtain them in a more regular and constitutional manner than before. Another parliament was accordingly called; and tho' some steps were taken to exclude the more po∣pular
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
leaders of the last house of commons, by nominating them as sheriffs of counties, yet the present parliament seemed more refractory than the former. When the king laid before the house his necessities, and asked for a supply, they voted him only three subsidies, which a∣mounted to about an hundred and sixty thou∣sand pounds; a sum no way adequate to the importance of the war, or the necessities of the state. But even this was not to be grant∣ed, until the grievances of the state were re∣dressed. Their chief indignation was levelled against Buckingham, a minister who had no real merit, and the great infelicity of being the king's favourite. Whenever the subjects resolve to attack the royal prerogative, they begin with the favourites of the crown, and wise monarchs seldom have any. Charles was not possessed of the art of making a distinc∣tion between friends and ministers; and who∣ever was his friend was always trusted with the administration of his affairs. He loved Buck∣ingham, and undertook to protect him, al∣though to defend a person so obnoxious to the people, was to share his reproach. The com∣mons undertook to impeach him in the lower house, while the earl of Bristol, who had re∣turned from his embassy in Spain, accused him
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
among his peers. The purport of the charge against him amounted to little more than that he had engrossed too much power for himself and his relations; that he had neglected to guard the seas with the fleet; and that he had applied a plaster to the late king's side, which was supposed to be poisonous, and to hasten his end. These frivolous accusations must have sunk of themselves, had they not been intemperately opposed by the royal authority. The king gave orders to the lord-keeper to command the commons expressly in his name not to meddle with his minister and servant Buckingham. The more to enrage them, he had him elected chancellor of the university of Cambridge, and wrote that body a letter of thanks for their compliance. He assured the commons, that if they would not comply with his demands, he would try <HI>new councils.</HI> But what justly enraged them beyond all sufferance was when two of their members, Sir Dudley Digges and Sir John Elliot, complaining of this partiality in favour of a man odious to the nation, the king ordered both to be com∣mitted to prison for seditious behaviour. This was an open act of violence, and should have been supported, or never attempted.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="201"/>It was now that the commons justly ex∣claimed that their privileges were infringed, and all freedom of debate destroyed. They protested, in the most solemn manner, that neither of their members had said any thing disrespectful of the king, and they made pre∣parations for publishing their vindication. The king, whose character it was to shew a readi∣ness to undertake harsh measures, but not to support them, released the two members; and this compliance confirmed that obstinacy in the house, which his injuries had contributed to give rise to. The earl of Arundel, for being guilty of the same offence in the house of lords, was rashly imprisoned, and as tamely dismissed by the king. Thus the two houses having refused to answer the intentions of the court without previous conditions, the king, rather than give up his favourite, chose to be without the supply, and therefore once more dissolved the parliament.</P>
<P>The new councils which Charles had men∣tioned to the parliament, were now to be tried, in order to supply his necessities. Instead of making peace with Spain, and thus trying to abridge his expences, since he could not enlarge his income, he resolved to carry on the war, and to keep up a standing army for this purpose.
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
Perhaps also he had further views in keeping this army in pay, which was to seize upon the liberty of his subjects, when he found matters ripe for the execution. But at present his forces were new levied, ill paid, and worse dis∣ciplined; so that the militia of the country, that would be instantly led out against him, were far his superiors. In order, therefore, to gain time and money, a commission was openly granted to compound with the catholics, and agree for a dispensation of the penal laws a∣gainst them. He borrowed a sum of money from the nobility, whose contributions came in but slowly. But the greatest stretch of his power was in the levying of <HI>ship-money.</HI> In order to equip a fleet (at least this was the pretence made) each of the maritime towns was required, with the assistance of the adja∣cent counties, to arm as many vessels as were appointed them. The city of London was rated at twenty ships. This was the com∣mencement of a tax, which afterwards, being carried to such violent lengths, created such great discontents in the nation. But the ex∣tortions of the ministry did not rest here. Persons of birth and rank, who refused the loan, were summoned before the council; and, upon persisting in a refusal, were put into con∣finement.
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
Thus we see here, as in every ci∣vil war, something to blame on one side and the other. Both sides guilty of injustice, yet either in general actuated by motives of vir∣tue. The one contending for the inherent liberties of mankind, the other for the pre∣scriptive privileges of the crown; both driven to all the extremes of falsehood, rapine, and injustice; and, by a fate attendant on huma∣nity, permitting their actions to degenerate from the motives which first set them in motion.</P>
<P>Hitherto the will of the monarch was re∣luctantly obeyed; most of those who refused to lend their money, were thrown into prison, and patiently submitted to confinement, or applied by petition to the king for their re∣lease. Five persons alone undertook to de∣fend the cause of the public; and, at the ha∣zard of their whole fortunes, were resolved to try whether the king legally had a right to confine their persons without an infringement of any law. The names of these patriots were Sir Thomas Darnel, Sir John Corbet, Sir Wal∣ter Earl, Sir John Haveningham, and Sir Ed∣ward Hambden. Their cause was brought to a solemn trial before the King's Bench, and the whole kingdom was attentive to the result of so important a trial.<MILESTONE N="Nov. 1626."/></P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="204"/>By the debates on this subject it appeared, that personal liberty had been secured by no less than six different statutes, and by an arti∣cle of the Great Charter itself. That in times of turbulence and sedition, the princes infring∣ed upon those laws; and of this also many ex∣amples were produced. The difficulty then lay to determine when such violent measures were expedient; but of that the court pre∣tended to be the supreme judge. As it was legal, therefore, that these five gentlemen should plead the statute, by which they might demand bail, so it was expedient in the court to remand them to prison, without determin∣ing on the necessity of taking bail for the pre∣sent. This was a cruel evasion of justice; and, in fact, satisfied neither the court nor the country party. The court insisted that no bail could be taken; the country exclaimed, that the prisoners should be set free.</P>
<P>The king being thus embroiled with his parliament, his people, and some of the most powerful foreign states, it was not without amazement that all men saw him enter into a war with France, a kingdom with which he had but lately formed the most natural al∣liance. This monarch, among the foibles of a good disposition, relied too much on the
<PB N="203" REF="205"/>
sincerity of his servants; and, among others, permitted Buckingham to lead him as he thought proper. All historians agree that this minister had conceived hopes of gaining the heart of the queen of France, while, at the same time, Cardinal Richelieu aspired to the same honour. The rivalry of these favourites produced an inveterate enmity between them; and from a private quarrel, they resolved to involve their respective nations in the dispute. However this be, war was declared against France; and Charles was taught to hope, that hostilities with that kingdom would be the surest means of producing unanimity at home.</P>
<P>But fortune seemed to counteract all this monarch's attempts. A fleet was sent out, under the command of Buckingham, to re∣lieve Rochelle, a maritime town in France, that had long enjoyed its privileges indepen∣dent of the French king; but that had for some years embraced the reformed religion, and now was besieged with a formidable army. This expedition was as unfortunate as that to the coasts of Spain. The duke's measures were so ill concerted, that the inhabitants of the city shut their gates, and refused to admit allies, of whose coming they were not pre∣viously informed. Instead of attacking the
<PB N="204" REF="206"/>
island of Oleron, which was fertile and de∣fenceless, he bent his course to the Isle of Rhé, which was garrisoned, and well fortified. He attempted there to starve out the garrison of St Martin's castle, which was copiously sup∣plied with provisions by sea. By that time the French had landed their forces privately at another part of the island; so that Bucking∣ham was at last obliged to retreat, but with such precipitation, that two thirds of his ar∣my were cut in pieces before he could reim∣bark, though he was the last man of the whole army that quitted the shore. This proof of his personal courage, however, was but a small subject of consolation for the dis∣grace which his country had sustained, and his own person would have been the last they would have regretted.</P>
<P>The bad success of this expedition served to render the duke still more obnoxious, and the king more needy. He therefore resolved to call a third parliament; for money was to be had at any rate. In his first speech, he told them they were convoked on purpose to grant the supplies; and that if they should neglect to contribute what was necessary for the support of the state, he would, in discharge of his conscience, use those means that God
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
had put into his hands, for saving that, which the folly of certain persons would otherwise endanger. But the king did not find his commons intimidated by his threats, nor by those of the lord-keeper, who commented upon what he said. They boldly inveighed against his late arbitrary measures, forced loans, benevolences, taxes without consent of parliament, arbitrary imprisonments, bilet∣ting soldiers, martial laws; these were the grievances complained of, and against these they insisted that an eternal remedy should be provided. An immunity from these vexations they alledged to be the inherent right of the sub∣ject; and their new demand they resolved to call a petition of right, as implying privileges they had already been possessed of.<MILESTONE N="1628" UNIT="A.D."/> Nothing could be more just than the enacting the contents of this petition of right into a law. The Great Charter, and the old statutes, were sufficiently clear in favour of liberty; but as all the kings of England had ever, in cases of necessity or expediency, been accustomed at intervals to elude them; and as Charles, in a complication of instances, had lately violated them, it was but requisite to enact a new law, which might not be eluded or violated by any authority, or any former precedent to the contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="208"/>But though this was an equitable proposal, and though the ready compliance with it might have prevented many of the disorders that were about to ensue, Charles was taught to consider it as the most violent encroachment on his prerogative, and used at first every me∣thod to obruct its progress. When he found that nothing but his assent would satisfy the house, he gave it; but at first in such an am∣biguous manner as left him still in possession of his former power. At length, however, to avoid their indignation, and still more to screen his favourite Buckingham, he thought proper to give them full satisfaction. He came therefore to the house of peers, and pro∣nouncing the usual form of words
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Soit come il e desire; Let it be law as it is desired,"</Q>
he gave the petition of right all the sanction that was necessary to pass it into a law. The ac∣clamations with which the house resounded sufficiently testified the joy of the people; and a bill for five subsidies, which passed soon af∣ter, was the strongest mark of their gratitude.</P>
<P>But the commons finding their perseverance crowned with success in this instance, were resolved to carry their scrutiny into every part of government, which they considered as de∣fective. The leaders of the house of commons
<PB N="207" REF="209"/>
at this time were very different from those il∣literate barbarians which a century or two before came up to the capital, not to grant supplies, but to consider where supplies were to be procured; not to debate as legislators, but to receive commands as inferiors. The men of whom the present parliaments were compos∣ed, were persons of great knowlege and ex∣tensive learning; of undaunted courage, and inflexible perseverance.</P>
<P>A little before the meeting of this parlia∣ment, a commission had been granted to thirty-three of the principal officers of state, empowering them to meet, and concert among themselves the methods of levying money by impositions, or otherwise. The commons applied for cancelling that commission; and indeed the late statute of the petition of rights seemed to render such a commission entirely unnecessary. They objected to another com∣mission for raising money for the introduction of a thousand German horse, which, with just reason, they feared might be turned against the liberties of the people. They resumed also their censure of Buckingham, whom they resolved implacably to pursue. They also openly asserted, that a method of levying mo∣ney used by the king called tonnage and pound∣age,
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
without the consent of parliament, was a palpable violation of all the liberties of the people. All these grievances were preparing to be drawn up in a remonstrance to his ma∣jesty, when the king, hearing of their inten∣tions, came suddenly to the house, and ended the session by a prorogation.</P>
<P>But they were not so easily to be intimidated in their schemes for the liberty of the people. They urged their claims with still more force on their next sitting; and the duty of tonnage and poundage was discussed with greater pre∣cision than before. This tax upon merchan∣dise was a duty of very early institution, and had been conferred on Henry the fifth, and all succeeding princes during life, in order to enable them to maintain a naval force for the protection of the kingdom. But the parlia∣ment had usually granted it as of their special favour in the beginning of each reign, except to Henry the eighth, who had it not conferred on him by parliament, till the sixth year of his sitting on the throne. Although he had continued to receive it from the beginning, yet he thought it necessary to have the sanction of parliament to ensure it to him, which cer∣tainly implied that it was not an inherent pri∣vilege of the crown. Upon this argument,
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
the commons founded their objections to the levying it in the present reign; it was a tax they had not yet granted, and it had been granted by them in every preceding reign. They refused, therefore, to grant it now; and insisted the king could not levy it without their permission.</P>
<P>This bred a long contest, as may be sup∣posed, between the commons and the crown. The officers of the custom-house were sum∣moned before the commons, to give an ac∣count by what authority they seized the goods of the merchants, who had refused to pay these duties. The barons of the Exchequer were questioned concerning their decrees on that head; the sheriff of London was committed to the Tower for his activity in supporting the custom-house officers. These were bold measures; but the commons went still farther, by a resolution to examine into religious griev∣ances, and a new spirit of intolerance began to appear. The king, therefore,<MILESTONE N="1629" UNIT="A.D."/> resolved to dissolve a parliament, which he found himself unable to manage; and Sir John Finch, the speaker, just as the question concerning ton∣nage and poundage was going to be put, rose up, and informed the house that he had a command from the king to adjourn.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="212"/>Nothing could exceed the consternation and indignation of the commons upon this information. Just at a time they were carry∣ing their most favourite points to a bearing, to be thus adjourned, and the parliament dis∣solved, rendered them furious. The house was in an uproar; the speaker was pushed back into his chair, and forcibly held in it by Hollis and Valentine, till a short remonstrance was framed, and passed by acclamation rather than vote. In this hasty production, Papists and Arminians were declared capital enemies to the state. Tonnage and poundage was condemned as contrary to law; and not only those who raised that duty, but those who paid it, were considered as guilty of capital crimes.</P>
<P>In consequence of this violent procedure, Sir Miles Hobart, Sir Peter Heyman, Selden, Coriton, Long, and Strode, were, by the king's order, committed to prison, under pre∣tence of sedition. But the same temerity that impelled Charles to imprison them, induced him to grant them a release. Sir John Elliot, Hollis, and Valentine, were summoned before the King's Bench; but they refusing to appear before an inferior tribunal, for faults com∣mitted in a superior, they were condemned to be imprisoned during the king's pleasure, to
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
pay a fine, the two former of a thousand pounds each, and the latter of five hundred, and to find sureties for their good behaviour. The members triumphed in their sufferings, while they had the whole kingdom as spectators and applauders of their fortitude.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while the king was thus distressed by the obstinacy of the commons, he felt a much severer blow in the death of his favourite, the duke of Buckingham, who fell a sacrifice to his unpopularity. It had been resolved once more to undertake the rais∣ing of the siege of Rochelle; and the earl of Denbigh, brother-in-law to Buckingham, was sent thither, but returned without effecting any thing. In order to repair this disgrace, the duke of Buckingham went in person to Ports∣mouth to hurry on another expedition, and to punish such as had endeavoured to defraud the crown of the legal assessments. In the general discontent that prevailed against this nobleman, it was daily expected that some se∣vere measures would be resolved on; and he was stigmatized as the tyrant and the betrayer of his country. There was one Felton, who caught the general contagion; an Irishman of a good family, who had served under the duke as lieutenant, but had resigned, on being
<PB N="212" REF="214"/>
refused his rank on the death of his captain, who had been killed at the Isle of Rhé. This man was naturally melancholy, courageous, and enthusiastic; he felt for his country, as if labouring under a calamity which he thought it in the power of his single arm to remove. He therefore resolved to kill the duke, and thus revenge his own private inju∣ries, while he did service also to God and man. Animated in this mannner with gloomy zeal, and mistaken patriotism, he travelled down to Portsmouth alone, and entered the town while the duke was surrounded by his levee, and giving out the necessary orders for embarka∣tion. He was at that time engaged in conver∣sation with one Soubize, and other French gen∣tlemen; and a difference of sentiments having arisen in the conference, it was attended with all these violent gesticulations with which foreigners generally enforce their meaning. The conversation being finished, the duke drew towards the door; and while he was speaking to one of his colonels, Felton struck him over that officer's shoulder in the breast with his knife. The duke had only time to say, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The villain has killed me,"</Q> when he fell at the colonel's feet, and instantly expired. No one had seen the blow, nor the person
<PB N="213" REF="215"/>
who gave it; but in the confusion it was ge∣nerally supposed that he was murdered by one of the Frenchmen, who appeared so violent in their motions but a little before. They were accordingly secured, as for certain punish∣ment; but in the mean time an hat was picked up, on the inside of which was sewed a paper, containing four or five lines of the remon∣strance of the commons against the duke; and under these lines a short ejaculation, desiring aid in the attempt. It was now concluded that this hat must belong to the assassin; and while they were employed in conjectures whose it should be, a man without an hat was seen walking very composedly before the door, and was heard to cry out, I am he. He disdained denying a murder in which he gloried; and averred, that he looked upon the duke as an enemy to his country, and as such deserving to suffer. When asked at whose instigation he had performed that horrid deed? he answer∣ed, that they need not trouble themselves in that enquiry; that his conscience was his only prompter, and that no man on earth could dispose him to act against its dictates. He suffered with the same degree of constancy to the last; nor were there many wanting who admired not only his fortitude, but the action for which he suffered.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="216"/>The king had always the highest regard for Buckingham, and was extremely mortified at his death; he began to perceive that the tide of popularity was entirely turned from him, and that the house of commons only served to encrease the general discontent. He felt therefore a disgust against parliaments; and he was resolved not to call any more, till he should see greater indications of a compli∣ant disposition in the nation. Having lost his favourite Buckingham, he became more his own minister, and never afterwards impos∣ed such unlimited confidence in any other. But though the minister of the crown was changed, the measures still continued the same; the same disregard to the petitions of the people, the same desire of extending and supporting the prerogative, the same temerity, and the same weakness of condescension.</P>
<P>His first measure, however, now being left without a minister and a parliament, was a prudent one.<MILESTONE N="1629" UNIT="A.D."/> He made peace with the two crowns, against whom he had hitherto waged war, which had been entered upon without necessity, and conducted without glory. Be∣ing freed from these embarrassments, he bent his whole attention to the management of the internal policy of the kingdom, and took two
<PB N="215" REF="217"/>
men as his associates in this task, who still acted an under-part to himself. These were Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards created earl of Strafford; and Laud, afterwards arch∣bishop of Canterbury.</P>
<P>Strafford, by his eminent talents and abili∣ties, merited all the confidence which the king reposed in him. His character was stately and austere; more fitted to procure esteem than love; his fidelity to the king was unsha∣ken; but in serving the interests of the crown, he did not consider himself as an agent also for benefit of the people. As he now em∣ployed all his counsels to support the preroga∣tive, which he formerly had endeavoured to diminish, his actions are liable to the imputation of self-interest and ambition, but his good character in private life made up for that seeming duplicity of public conduct.</P>
<P>Laud was in the church somewhat resem∣bling Strafford in the state, rigid, severe, punctual, and industrious. His zeal was un∣relenting in the cause of religion, and the forms as established in the reign of queen Elizabeth seemed essentially connected with it. His desire to keep these on their former footing was imprudent and severe; but it must be confessed that the furious opposition he met with was sufficient to excite his resentment.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="218"/>Since the times of Elizabeth, a new reli∣gious sect had been gaining ground in Eng∣land; which, from the supposed greater purity of their manners, were called <HI>Puritans.</HI> Of all other sects, this was the most dangerous to monarchy; and the tenets of it more calcu∣lated to support that imagined equality which obtains in a state of nature. The partizans of this religion, being generally men of warm, obstinate tempers, pushed their sentiments into a total opposition to those of Rome; and in the countries where their opinions had taken place, not only a religious, but a political free∣dom began to be established. All enthusiasts, indulging themselves in rapturous flights, ex∣tasies, visions, and inspirations, have a natural aversion to all ceremonies, rites, or forms, which are but external means of supplying that devotion, which they want no prompter but their hearts to inspire. The same bold and daring spirit which accompanied them in their addresses to the divinity, appeared in their political speculations; and the princi∣ples of civil liberty, which had hitherto been almost totally unknown in Europe, began to shoot forth in this ungracious soil. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, if kings and bishops were willing to suppress the growth of
<PB N="217" REF="219"/>
opinions so unfavourable to their authority; and that Laud, who of all men alive, was the most attached to ceremony and shew, should treat with rigour, men who braved him into severity. The truth is, that in the histories of the times, we find the great cause of the present contest between the king and his people to arise, not from civil, but religious motives; not from a desire on the one hand of extending power, and on the other of pro∣moting liberty; but merely from the ardour of the king in supporting bishops, surplices, and other ceremonies of the church, and the fury of the puritans in abolishing those distinc∣tions, as remnants of popish idolatry. These distinctions in religion, at this day, are regard∣ed with more unconcern; and, therefore, we are more apt to impute the disorders of those times, rather to civil motives of establish∣ing liberty, which, in reality, made but a very subordinate consideration.</P>
<P>The humour of the nation ran, at that time, into the extreme opposite of superstition; and those ancient ceremonies, to which men had been accustomed in England, since the com∣mencement of the Reformation, were in general considered as impious and idolatrous. It was, therefore, the most impolitic time in the world
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
for Laud to think of introducing new ceremo∣nies and observances, which could not fail of being treated with utter detestation. Never∣theless he went on boldly with his injunctions for the observance of those rites, which, in them∣selves, were of no moment; and, therefore, were as unnecessary to be urged by him, as ri∣diculous in being opposed by the puritans.</P>
<P>Orders were given, and rigorously insisted on, that the communion table should be re∣moved from the middle of the church, where it hitherto stood since the Reformation, to the East end; where it should be railed in, and denominated the altar. The kneeling at the altar, and the using of copes, an embroidered vestment used in popish countries, were intro∣duced to the great discontent of the people. Some pictures were admitted again into churches by his command. All such clergy as neglected to observe every ceremony, were suspended, and deprived by the high commis∣sion court. And, to mortify the puritans still more, orders were issued from the council, for∣bidding any controversy, either from the pul∣pit or the press, on the points in dispute be∣tween them and their opponents, concerning free will and predestination. At the same time that he obtained the king's protection for
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
carrying on these measures, he took care to repay the monarch, by magnifying on every occasion the regal authority; and treating all pretensions to independence, as a puritanical innovation. The king's divine, hereditary, and indefeasible right, was the theme of every sermon; and those who attempted to question such doctrines, were considered as making an attack upon religion itself. The king, who had now taken a resolution of calling no more parliaments, and which resolution he adhered to for the space of eleven years after, was very well satisfied with these doctrines; as they were the only means of facilitating his measures of government, and procuring those pecuniary supplies which he had no legal means of ob∣taining.</P>
<P>While Laud, therefore, during this long in∣terval, ruled the church, the king and Straf∣ford undertook to manage the temporal in∣terests of the nation. A proclamation was issued, in which Charles declared,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That whereas, for several ill ends, the calling again of a parliament is divulged; yet the late abuses, having for the present, unwill∣ingly driven him out of that course; he will account it presumption for any one to pre∣scribe to him any time for calling that as∣sembly."</Q>
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
This was generally construed as a declaration, that during that reign no more parliaments would be summoned; and every measure of the king but too well served to confirm the suspicion.</P>
<P>It was now that the people, without a de∣fender, or hopes of redress, saw themselves at the mercy of a monarch, who, though good and gentle in his own nature, might at any time change in his conduct. They now saw the constitution at one blow wholly overthrown, and one branch of the legislature assuming those rights, which had been divided between three. Tonnage and poundage were conti∣nued to be levied by royal authority alone: custom-house officers received orders from the council to enter any house whatever, in search of suspected goods: compositions were openly made with papists; and their religion was become a regular part of the revenue. The high commission court of Star-chamber exercised its power, independent of any law, upon several bold innovators in liberty, who only gloried in their sufferings, and contri∣buted to render government odious and con∣temptible. Sir David Foulis was fined by this court five thousand pounds, merely for dissuad∣ing a friend from compounding with the com∣missioners;
<PB N="221" REF="223"/>
who called upon him to take up the title of knighthood. Prynne, a barrister of Lincoln's inn, had written an enormous quar∣to of a thousand pages, which was entitled Histriomastix, or a Scourge for the Stage. In this, beside much paltry declamation against the stage, he took occasion to blame the ce∣remonies and late innovations of the church; and this was an offence that Laud was not like∣ly to forgive. He was condemned by the Star-chamber to be degraded from the bar; to stand in the pillory, in two places, Westminster and Cheapside; to lose his ears, one at each place; to pay five thousand pounds to the king, and to be imprisoned during life. This sentence, which was equally cruel and unjust, was rigo∣rously executed; and Prynne gloried in his sufferings. Burton, a divine, and Bastwick, a physician, were tried before this tribunal for schismatical libels, in which they attacked, with great severity and intemperate zeal, the ceremonies of the church of England. They were condemned to the same punishment that had been inflicted upon Prynne; and Prynne himself was also tried for a new offence, for which he was fined five thousand pounds more, and sentenced to lose the rest of his ears. The answers which these bold demagogues gave
<PB N="222" REF="224"/>
into court, were so full of contumacy and in∣vective, that no lawyer could be prevailed with to sign them. The rigours, however, which they underwent, being so unworthy men of their profession, gave general offence; and the patience, or rather alacrity with which they suffered, encreased still further the public indignation.</P>
<P>The puritans, restrained in England, shipped themselves off for America, where they laid the foundations of a new government, agree∣able to their systems of political freedom. But the government, unwilling that the nation should be deprived of its useful members, or dreading the unpopularity of these migrations, was prevailed on to issue a proclamation, de∣barring those devotees access, even into those inhospitable regions. Eight ships, lying in the Thames, and ready to sail, were detained by order of counsel; and in these were embarked Sir Arthur Hazlerig, John Hamden, and Oli∣ver Cromwell, who had resolved for ever to abandon their native country. This may stand as a proof of the sincerity these men afterwards testified in the cause for which they fought; and is a clear proof that hypocrisy, with which they were charged, in the beginning at least, was not among the motives of their opposition.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="225"/>Every year, every month, every day, gave fresh instances, during this long intermission of parliaments, of the resolutions of the court to throw them off for ever: but the levying of <HI>ship-money,</HI> as it was called, being a general burthen, was universally complained of as a national grievance. This was a tax which had, in former reigns, been levied without the con∣sent of parliament; but then the exigency of the state demanded such a supply. But as the necessity at present was not so apparent, and might excite murmurs among the people, a question was proposed by the king to the judges, whether, in a case of necessity, for the defence of the kingdom, he might not impose this tax? and whether he was not sole judge of this necessity? To this the judges replied that he might; and that he was sole judge of the necessity. In this universal appearance of obe∣dience to the king's injunctions, John Ham∣den, a gentleman of fortune in Buckingham∣shire, refused to comply with the tax, and re∣solved to bring it to a legal determination. He had been rated at twenty-shillings for his estate, which he refused to pay; and the case was argued twelve days in the Exchequer chamber, before all the judges of England. The nation regarded, with the utmost anxiety,
<PB N="224" REF="226"/>
the result of a trial that was to fix the limits of the king's power; but after the former opi∣nion of the judges on this subject, the event might have been easily foreseen. All the judges, four only excepted, gave sentence in favour of the crown; while Hamden, who lost his cause, was more than sufficiently recompensed by the applauses of the people. Nothing now was heard in every company but murmurs against government, and encomiums on him who had withstood its usurpations. It was now alleged, that tyranny was confirmed into system; and that there was no redress except in sullen patience, or contented slavery. Ec∣clesiastical tyranny was thought to give aid to political injustice; and all the rights of the nation, transmitted through so many ages, se∣cured by so many laws, and purchased by the blood of so many heroes, now lay prostrate in undistinguished neglect. In this universal state of despondence, or clamour, an accident gave the people of England an opportunity of vin∣dicating their ancient privileges; and even of acquiring greater than was compatible with the subjects' happiness to be possessed of.</P>
<P>The Scotch had, during the reign of James the first, shewed a strong attachment to puri∣tanical principles; and though they still con∣tinued
<PB N="225" REF="227"/>
to allow of bishops; yet they were re∣duced to poverty, and treated with contempt. James, indeed, had seen the low estate of epis∣copacy in that kingdom, and had endeavour∣ed to exalt and establish it once more; but he died in the midst of his endeavours. It was the fate of Charles, for ever to aim at projects which were at once impracticable, and unne∣cessary; he resolved, therefore, to complete what his father had begun. This ill-judged attempt served to alienate the affections of his Scotch subjects, as much as his encroachments on liberty had rendered him unpopular in Eng∣land. The flame of sedition in Scotland, pass∣ed from city to city, while the puritans formed a <HI>Covenant,</HI> to support and defend their opi∣nions; and resolved to establish their doctrines, or overturn the state. On the other hand, the court were determined to establish the liturgy of the church of England; and both sides be∣ing obstinate in opinion, those sanguinary mea∣sures were soon begun in Scotland, which had hitherto been only talked of among the Eng∣lish.</P>
<P>The discontent and opposition which the king met with in maintaining episcopacy among his English subjects might, one would think, hinder him from attempting to intro∣duce
<PB N="226" REF="228"/>
it among those of Scotland; but such was his ardour, that he was resolved to have it established in every part of his dominions. Having published an order for reading the liturgy in the principal church in Edinburgh, the people received it with clamours and im∣precations. The court-party, indeed, with great justice, blamed their obstinacy, as the innovations were but trifling; but the people might have retorted with still greater force the folly of their thus earnestly attempting the establishment of trifles. The seditious disposi∣tion in that kingdom, which had hitherto been kept within bounds, was now too furious for restraint, and the insurrection became general over all the country.</P>
<P>Yet still the king could not think of desist∣ing from his design; and so prepossessed was he in favour of royal right, that he thought the very name of king, when forcibly urged, would induce them to return to their duty. But he was soon undeceived; the puritans of Scotland were republicans in principle, as well as those in England; and they only wished to see the bishops first humbled, in order to make a more successful attack upon unguarded monarchy. Charles, therefore, finding them in arms, and that they insisted on displacing the
<PB N="227" REF="229"/>
bishops, considered their demands as an open declaration of war; and accordingly summon∣ed such of the nobility of England as held lands of the crown, to furnish him with a proper number of forces to oppose them. To add to these supplies, he demanded a vo∣luntary contribution from the clergy, as he was, in fact, fighting their cause; and by means of his queen, the catholics were also pressed for their assistance. By these methods he soon found himself at the head of an un∣disciplined and reluctant army, amounting to about twenty thousand men, and commanded by generals less willing to fight than to nego∣ciate. His superiority in numbers, however, gave him the manifest advantage over his re∣bellious subjects, who were no way slow in marching to give him battle. But Charles, who inherited the peaceable disposition of his father, was unwilling to come to extremities, although a blow then struck with vigour might have prevented many of his succeeding misfortunes. Instead of fighting with his op∣ponents, he entered upon a treaty with them; so that a suspension of arms was soon agreed upon, and a treaty of peace concluded, which neither side intended to observe; and then both parties agreed to disband their forces. This
<PB N="228" REF="230"/>
step of disbanding the army was a fatal mea∣sure to Charles, as he could not levy a new army without great labour and expence; while the Scotch insurgents, who were all volunteers in the service, could be mustered again at plea∣sure. Of this the heads of the malcontents seemed sensible; for they lengthened out the negotiations with affected difficulties, and threw in obstructions, in proportion as they were confident of their own superiority. At length, after much altercation, and many trea∣ties signed and broken, both parties once more had recourse to arms, and nothing but blood could satiate the contenders.</P>
<P>War being thus resolved on, the king took every method as before for raising money to support it. Ship-money was levied as usual; some other arbitrary taxes were exacted from the reluctant people with great severity; but one method of raising the supplies reflects im∣mortal honour on those who contributed. The counsellors and servants of the crown lent the king whatever sums they could spare, and distressed their private fortunes to gratify their sovereign. These were the resources of the crown to prepare an army; but they were far from being sufficient; and there now remained only one method more, the long-neglected method of a parliamentary supply.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="231"/>It was now above eleven years since the king had called a parliament.<MILESTONE N="1640" UNIT="A.D."/> The fierce and ungovernable spirit of the last had taught him to hate and to fear such an assembly; but all resources being exhausted, and great debts contracted, he was obliged to call another par∣liament, from which he had no great reason to expect any favour. The many illegal, and the numerous imprudent steps of the crown, the hardships which several persons had suffer∣ed, and their constancy in undergoing punish∣ment, had as much alienated the affections of the king's English as of his Scotch subjects. Instead of supplies the king was harrassed with murmurs and complaints. The zealous in religion were pleased with the distresses of the crown, in its attempts against their bre∣thren in opinion; and the real friends to the liberties of mankind saw, with their usual penetration, that the time was approaching when the royal authority must fall into a to∣tal dependence on popular assemblies, and when public freedom must acquire a full ascendant.</P>
<P>The House of commons, therefore, could not be induced to treat the Scotch, who were of the same principles with themselves, and contending against the same ceremonies, as ene∣mies
<PB N="230" REF="232"/>
to the state. They regarded them as friends and brothers, who first rose to teach them a duty it was incumbent on all virtuous minds to imitate. The king, therefore, could reap no other fruits from this assembly than murmurings and complaints. Every method he had taken to supply himself with money was declared an abuse, and a breach of the constitution. Tonnage and poundage, ship-money, the sale of monopolies, the billeting soldiers upon refractory citizens, were all voted as stretches of arbitrary power. The king finding no hopes of redress from the commons, had recourse to the house of peers; but this was equally ineffectual with the former ap∣plication. The king, therefore, finding no hopes of a compliance with his request, but recrimination instead of redress, once more dis∣solved the parliament, to try more feasible methods of removing his necessities.</P>
<P>The king having now made enemies of his Scotch subjects, by controlling them in their mode of worship, and of the commons by dissolving them, it remained to exasperate the city of London against him by some new im∣prudence. Upon their refusing to lend him money to carry on the Scotch war, he sued the citizens in the Star-chamber for some lands
<PB N="231" REF="233"/>
in Ireland, and made them pay a considerable fine. He continued also to exact all the taxes against which every former parliament had re∣monstrated; but all were insufficient. A loan of forty thousand pounds was extorted from the Spanish merchants, who had bullion in the Tower, exposed to the attempts of the king. Coat and conduct money for the soldiers was levied on the counties; an ancient practice, but supposed to be abolished by the petition of right. All the pepper was bought from the East India company upon trust, and sold at a great discount for ready money. A scheme was proposed for coining two or three hundred thousand pounds of base money; and yet all these methods were far from being effectual. The Scotch, therefore, sensible of the extre∣mities to which he was reduced, led on an army of twenty thousand men as far as New-castle upon Tyne, to lay their grievances be∣fore their sovereign, as they were pleased to term their rebellion. One of the most dis∣gusting strokes in the puritanical character of the times, was this gentle language and hum∣ble cant, in the midst of treason; and their flattery to their prince, while they were at∣tempting to dethrone and destroy him.</P>
<P>To these troops, inspired by religion, flushed with some slight victories obtained over strag∣gling
<PB N="232" REF="234"/>
parties of the royalists, and encouraged by the English themselves, among whom they continued, the king was able to oppose only a smaller force, new levied, undisciplined, seditious, and ill paid. Being therefore in despair of stemming the torrent, he at last yielded to it. He first summoned a great council of peers to York; and, as he foresaw that they would advise him to call a parlia∣ment, he told them in his first speech that he had already taken that resolution. Having thus prepared for his misfortunes, he a short time after called that long parliament,<MILESTONE N="Nov. 3, 1640."/> which never discontinued sitting till they finally ac∣complished his ruin.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX. CHARLES I. (Continued.)</HEAD>
<P>THE ardent expectations of men with re∣gard to a parliament at such a critical juncture, and during such general discontents, might na∣turally engage the attendance of the members on their duty. The house of commons was never, from its first institution, observed to be so numerous, or the assiduity of its members greater. Without any interval, therefore, they entered upon business; and by unani∣mous consent they struck a blow that might be regarded as decisive. Instead of granting the demanded subsidies, they impeached the earl of Strafford, the king's first minister, and had him arraigned before the house of peers for high treason. Pym, a tedious, but sensi∣ble speaker, who had first opened the accusa∣tion against him in the house of commons, was sent up to defend it at the bar of the house of lords; and most of the house accompanied their member on so agreeable an errand.</P>
<P>To bestow the greatest solemnity on this im∣portant trial, scaffolds were erected in West∣minster Hall, where both houses sat, the one as judges, the other as accusers. Beside the
<PB N="234" REF="236"/>
chair of state, a close gallery was prepared for the king and queen, who attended during the whole trial. The articles of impeachment against him were twenty-eight in number, the substance of which was, that he had attempted to extend the king's authority at home, and had been guilty of several exactions in Ireland. But though four months were employed by the managers in framing the accusation, yet there appears very little just cause of blame in him, since the stretches of the king's power were made before he came into authority. How∣ever, the managers for the house of commons pleaded against him with vehemence stronger than their reasons, and summed up their argu∣ments, by insisting, that though each article taken separately did not amount to a proof, yet the whole taken together might be fairly concluded to carry conviction. This is a method of arguing frequently used in the English courts of justice even at this day: and perhaps none can be more erroneous; for almost every false∣hood may be found to have a multiplicity of weak reasons to support it. In this tumult of aggravation and clamour, the earl himself, whose parts and wisdom had been long re∣spectable, stood unmoved and undaunted. He defended his cause with all the presence of
<PB N="235" REF="237"/>
mind, judgment, and sagacity, that could be expected from innocence and ability. His children were placed beside him as he was thus defending his life, and the cause of his master. After he had in a long and eloquent speech, delivered without premeditation, con∣futed all the accusations of his enemies; af∣ter he had shewn that during his government in Ireland, he had introduced the arts of peace among the savage part of that people; after he had declared, that though his measures in England were harsh, he shewed the necessity by which he was driven into them, since his coming over; after he had clearly refuted the argument upon the accumulative force of his guilt, he thus drew to a conclusion.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But, my lords, I have troubled you too long; longer than I should have done, but for the sake of these dear pledges, which a saint in heaven has left me."</Q>
—Upon this he paused, dropped a tear, looked upon his children, and proceeded.—
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What I forfeit for myself is a trifle; that my indiscretions should reach my posterity, wounds me to the heart.— Pardon my infirmity.—Something I should have added, but am not able; therefore let it pass. And now, my lords, for myself; I have long been taught that the afflictions of
<PB N="236" REF="238"/>
this life are overpaid by that eternal weight of glory which awaits the innocent; and so my lords, even so, with the utmost tran∣quillity, I submit myself to your judg∣ment, whether that judgment be life or death: not my will, but thine, O God, be done."</Q>
His eloquence and innocence in∣duced those judges to pity, who were the most zealous to condemn him. The king himself went to the house of lords, and spoke for some time in his defence; but the spirit of ven∣geance that had been chained for eleven years, was now rouzed, and nothing but his blood could give the people satisfaction. He was found guilty by both houses of parliament; and nothing remained but for the king to give his consent to the bill of attainder. But in the present commotions the consent of the king was a thing that would very easily be dis∣pensed with; and imminent dangers might at∣tend his refusal. Yet still Charles, who loved Strafford tenderly, hesitated, and seemed re∣luctant, trying every expedient to put off so dreadful a duty, as that of signing the warrant for his execution. While he continued in this agitation of mind, not knowing how to act, his doubts were at last silenced by an act of heroic bravery in the condemned lord. He
<PB N="237" REF="239"/>
received a letter from that unfortunate noble∣man, desiring that his life might be made the sacrifice of a mutual reconciliation between the king and his people; adding, that he was prepared to die, and to a willing mind there could be no injury. This instance of noble generosity was but ill repaid by his master, who complied with his request. He consent∣ed to the signing the fatal bill by commission; Strafford was beheaded on Tower-hill, behav∣ing with all that composed dignity of resolu∣tion that was expected from his character. The people, taught by his death to trample upon the rights of humanity, soon after resolved to shed blood that was still more precious.</P>
<P>But the commons did not stop their im∣peachments here. Laud also, after a delibera∣tion which did not continue half an hour, was considered as sufficiently culpable to incur the same accusation, and was committed to custo∣dy. Finch, the lord keeper, was also impeach∣ed; but he had the precaution to make his escape, and fly over into Holland, as did Sir Francis Wyndebank, the secretary, into France.</P>
<P>The crown being thus deprived of the ser∣vices of its ministers, the commons next pro∣ceeded to attack the few privileges it still
<PB N="238" REF="240"/>
possessed. During the late military opera∣tions, several powers had been exerted by the lieutenants, and deputy-lieutenants of coun∣ties, men who were all under the influence of the crown. These were, therefore, voted <HI>Delinquents</HI>; a term now first used to signify transgressors, whose crimes were not as yet as∣certained by law. The sheriffs also, who had obeyed the king's mandate in raising ship-mo∣ney, were voted also to be delinquents. All the farmers and officers of the customs, who had been employed during so many years in levying tonnage and poundage, were subjected to the same imputation, and only purchased their safety by paying an hundred and fifty thousand pounds. Every discretionary or arbitrary sentence of the Star-chamber, and High commission courts, underwent a severe scrutiny; and all those who had any hand in such sentences were voted to be liable to the penalties of the law. The judges, who had declared against Hamden in the trial of ship-money, were accused before the peers, and obliged to find security for their appearance. All those monopolies which had been lately granted by the crown, were now annihilated by the order of the commons; and they carried their detestation of that grievance so far, as to
<PB N="239" REF="241"/>
expel from their own house all such members as had been monopolists or projectors.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have seen the commons in some measure the patrons of liberty and of the peo∣ple; boldly opposing the stretches of illegal power, or repressing those claims which, tho' founded on custom, were destructive of free∣dom. Thus far their aims, their struggles, were just and honourable: but the general passions of the nation were now excited; and having been once put into motion, they soon passed the line, and knew not where to stop. Had they been contented with resting here, af∣ter abridging all those privileges of monarchy which were capable of injuring the subject, and leaving it all those prerogatives that could benefit, they would have been considered as the great benefactors of mankind, and would have left the constitution pretty nearly on the same footing on which we enjoy it at present. But they either were willing to revenge their former sufferings, or thought that some terri∣ble examples were necessary to deter others from attempting to enslave their country. The horrors of a civil war were not sufficiently at∣tended to; and they precipitately involved the nation in calamities which they themselves were the first to repent.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="242"/>The whole nation was thrown into a ge∣neral ferment. The harangues of the mem∣bers, now first published and dispersed, kept alive the horrors which were felt for the late administration. The pulpits, delivered over to the puritanical preachers, whom the commons arbitrarily placed in all the considerable churches, resounded with faction and fanati∣cism. The press, freed from all fear or re∣straint, swarmed with productions, dangerous by their sedition and calumny, more than by their eloquence or style.</P>
<P>In this universal uproar against the crown, Prynne, Burton, and Bastwick, who had some years before suffered so severely for their licen∣tious abuses, and had been committed to re∣mote prisons, were set at liberty by or∣der of the commons, and were seen making their triumphant entry into the capital. Bast∣wick had been confined in Scilly, Burton in Jersey, and Prynne in Guernsey; and upon landing at their respective places they were re∣ceived by the acclamations of the people, and attended by crowds to London. Boughs were carried in this tumultuous procession; the roads were strewed with flowers, their suffer∣ings were aggravated, and their persecutors reviled. Every person who had been punished
<PB N="241" REF="243"/>
for seditious libels during the foregoing admi∣nistration, now recovered their liberty, and had damages given them upon those who had de∣creed their punishment.</P>
<P>Grievances had, no doubt, and heavy ones, been endured during the last intermission of parliaments; but the very complaints against them now became one of the greatest griev∣ances. So many were offered within doors, and petitioned against without, that the house was divided into above forty committees, charged each of them with the examination of its respective complaints. The torrent rising to so dreadful and unexpected an height, de∣spair seized all those who, from interest or ha∣bit, were attached to monarchy; while the king himself saw, with amazement, the whole fabric of government totally overturned.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You have taken, said he to the parliament, the whole machine of government to pieces; a practice frequent with skilful artists, when they desire to clear the wheels from any rust which may have grown upon them. The en∣gine may be restored to its former use and mo∣tions, provided it be fitted up entire, so as not a pin be wanting."</Q>
But the commons, in their present temper, were much better adapted to destroy than to fit up; and having taken
<PB N="242" REF="244"/>
the machine asunder, they soon found an ex∣peditious set of workmen ready, to step in and take the whole business off their hands.</P>
<P>But in this universal rage for abolishing the former constitution, the parliament fell with great justice on two courts, which had been erected under arbitrary kings, and had seldom been employed but in cases of necessity. These were, the High-commission court, and the court of Star-chamber. A bill unanimously passed the houses to abolish both; and in them to an∣nihilate the principal and most dangerous ar∣ticles in the king's prerogative. The first of those, which was instituted for defending the establishments of the church, had great power in all ecclesiastical matters; and the judges in that court were entirely arbitrary in whatever punishments, or fines, they thought proper to inflict. The Star-chamber had given force to the king's proclamations, and punished such as ventured to transgress them; but that being now taken away, his proclamations were of no effect, and might be opposed with im∣punity. Such were, the transactions of this first session of the long parliament; and tho' in some cases they acted with anger, and in others with precipitation, yet their merits so much overbalanced their mistakes, that they deserve the highest gratitude from posterity.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="245"/>After this, the parliament seemingly ad∣journed; but a committee of both houses, a thing altogether unprecedented, was appoint∣ed to sit during the recess, with very ample powers, and very little less than those of the parliament in the plenitude of its authority. Pym was appointed chairman of the lower house; in this further attempts were made for assuming the sovereign executive powers, and publishing the ordinances of this committee as statutes enacted by all the branches of the legislature. In the mean the king went to pay a visit to his subjects in Scotland.</P>
<P>In the midst of these troubles, the papists of Ireland fancied they found a convenient opportunity of throwing off the English yoke. There was a gentleman called Roger More, who, though of a narrow fortune, was descend∣ed from a very ancient Irish family, and was very much celebrated among his countrymen for his valour and capacity. This man first formed the project of expelling the English, and asserting the independency of his native country. The occasion was favourable; the English, warmly engaged in domestic animosi∣ties, were unable to attend to a distant insurrec∣tion; and those of that nation, who resided among them, were too feeble to resist. Struck with
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
these motives, Sir Phelim O'Neale entered in∣to a conspiracy; lord Macguire came into his designs, and soon after all the chiefs of the native Irish promised their concurrence.</P>
<P>Their plan was laid accordingly, which was, that Sir Phelim O'Neale, and the other con∣spirators, should all begin an insurrection on one day throughout the provinces; should de∣stroy all the English, while lord Macguire, and Roger More, should surprise the castle of Dublin. They had fixed on the approach of winter for this revolt, the day was appointed, every thing in readiness, the secret profoundly kept, and the conspirators promised them∣selves a certainty of success. The earl of Leices∣ter, who had been appointed lord lieutenant, was then in London. Sir William Parsons, and Sir John Borlace, the two lords justices, were men of mean intellects; and, without attending to the interests of their country, indulged them∣selves in the most profound tranquility on the very brink of ruin.</P>
<P>The very day before the intended seizure of the castle of Dublin, the plot was discovered by one O'Connolly, an Irishman, but a pro∣testant, to the justices, who fled to the castle, and alarmed all the protestant inhabitants of the city to prepare for their defence. Mac∣guire
<PB N="245" REF="247"/>
was taken, but More escaped; and new informations being every hour added to those already received, the project of a general in∣surrection was no longer a secret.</P>
<P>But though the citizens of Dublin had just time enough to save themselves from danger; the protestants dispersed over the different parts of the country, were taken unprepared. O'Neale and his confederates had already taken arms in Ulster. The Irish, every where inter∣mingled with the English, needed but a hint from their leaders and priests to massacre a people whom they hated for their religion, and envied for their riches and prosperity. The in∣surrections of a civilized people, are usually marked with very little cruelty; but the revolt of a savage nation, generally aims at extermina∣tion. The Irish accordingly resolved to cut off all the protestants of the kingdom at a stroke; so that neither age, sex, or condition, received any pity. In such indiscriminate slaughter, nei∣ther former benefits, nor alliances, nor authori∣ty, were any protection: numberless were the instances of friends murdering their intimates, relations their kinsmen, and servants their mas∣ters. In vain did flight save from the first assault; destruction, that had an extensive spread, met the hunted victims at every turn.
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
Not only death, but studied cruelties were inflicted on the unhappy sufferers; the very avarice of the revolters could not restrain their thirst for blood, and they burned the inhabi∣tants in their own houses to encrease their pu∣nishment. Several hundreds were driven up∣on a bridge; and from thence obliged, by these barbarians, to leap into the water, where they were drowned. The English colonies were totally annihilated in the open country of Ul∣ster; but in the other provinces the rebels pre∣tended to act with greater humanity.</P>
<P>The protestants were driven there from their houses, to meet the severity of the weather, without food or raiment, and numbers of them perished with the cold, which happened at that time to be peculiarly severe. By some computations, those who perished by all these cruelties, are made to amount to an hundred and fifty, or two hundred thousand; but, by a moderate computation, they could not have been less than forty thousand.</P>
<P>In the mean time the English Pale, as it was called, consisting of the old English catholics, who had first come over, joining with the na∣tive Irish, a large army was formed, amounting to above twenty thousand men, which threaten∣ed a total extermination of the English power
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
in that island. The king was at that time in Scotland, when he received the first accounts of this rebellion; and though he did all in his power to induce his subjects there to lend assistance to the protestant cause, yet he found them totally averse to sending any succours into Ireland. Their aim was to oblige the parliament of England, with what succours they could spare, and not to obey the injunc∣tions of their sovereign. They went still far∣ther, and had the assurance to impute a part of these dreadful massacres to the king's own contrivance. In fact, the rebels of Ireland did not fail to shew a royal patent, authorising their attempts; and it is said that Sir Phelim O'Neale, having found a royal patent in lord Caulfield's house, whom he had murdered, he tore off the seal, and affixed it to a commission which he had forged for himself.</P>
<P>However this be, the king took all the pre∣cautions in his power to shew his utter detesta∣tion of these bloody proceedings; and being sensible of his own inability to suppress the re∣bellion, he had once more recourse to his Eng∣lish parliament, and craved their assistance for a supply. But here he found no hopes of as∣sistance; many insinuations were thrown out that he had himself fomented this rebellion,
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
and no money could be spared for the extinc∣tion of distant dangers, when they pretended that the kingdom was threatened with greater at home.</P>
<P>It was now that the republican spirit began to appear without any disguise in the pre∣sent parliament; and that party, instead of attacking the faults of the king, resolved to destroy monarchy. They had seen a republi∣can system of government lately established in Holland, and attended with very noble effects; they began, therefore, to wish for a similar system at home, and many productions of the press at that time sketched out the form. It would be unjust to deny these men the praise of be∣ing guided by honest motives; but it would be unwise not to say also, that they were swayed by wrong ones. In the comparison between a republic and a limited monarchy, the ba∣lance entirely inclines to the latter, since a real republic never yet existed, except in specula∣tion; and that liberty which demagogues pro∣mise to their followers, is generally only sought after for themselves. The aim in general of popular leaders, is rather to depress the great than exalt the humble; and in such govern∣ments, the lower ranks of people are too com∣monly the most abject slaves. In a republic,
<PB N="249" REF="251"/>
the number of tyrants are capable of support∣ing each other in their injustice; while in a monarchy there is one object, who, if he offends, is easily punishable, and ought to be brought to justice.</P>
<P>The leaders of the opposition began their operations by a resolution to attack episco∣pacy, which was one of the strongest bul∣warks of the royal power; but previously framed a remonstrance, in which they sum∣moned up all their former grievances.<MILESTONE N="1641" UNIT="A.D."/> These they ascribed to a regular system of tyranny in the king, and asserted that they amounted to a total subversion of the constitution. This, when drawn up by a tumultuous majority of the house, they ordered to be printed and published, without being carried up, as is usual in such cases, to the house of peers, for their assent and approbation. The commons hav∣ing thus endeavoured to render the king's administration universally odious, they began upon the hierarchy. Their first measure was, by their own single authority, to suspend all the laws which had been made for the obser∣vance of public worship. They particularly forbade bowing at the name of Jesus. They complained of the king's filling five vacant bishoprics; and considered it as an insult upon
<PB N="250" REF="252"/>
them, that he should complete and strengthen an order which they were resolved to abolish. They accused thirteen bishops of high treason, for enacting canons without the consent of parliament; and endeavoured to prevail upon the house of peers to exclude all the prelates from their seats and votes, in that august as∣sembly. But notwithstanding all their ef∣forts, the lords refused their concurrence to this law; and all such as any way tended to the farther limitation of royal authority. The majority of the peers adhered to the king; and plainly foresaw the depression of the nobility as a necessary consequence of the popular usur∣pations on the crown. The commons mur∣mured at their refusal, mixed threats with their indignation, and began, for the first time, to insinuate that the business of the state could be carried on without them.</P>
<P>In order to intimidate the lords into their measures, the populace was let loose to insult and threaten them. Multitudes of people flocked every day towards Westminster, and insulted the prelates, and such lords as ad∣hered to the crown. Some seditious appren∣tices being seized and committed to prison, the house of commons immediately ordered them to be set free. Encouraged by the coun∣tenance
<PB N="251" REF="253"/>
of the house, the populace crowded about Whitehall, and threw out insolent menaces against the king himself. It was at this time that several reduced officers and students of the inns of court, offered their services to the king, to repress the rioters; and many frays ensued not without bloodshed. The rabble, by way of reproach, were called Round-heads, from the manner of wearing their hair, and the gentlemen Cavaliers. These names afterwards served to distinguish the par∣tizans of either side, and served still more to divide the nation.</P>
<P>The fury of the commons, and also of the populace, did not fail to intimidate the bishops; they saw the storm that was gather∣ing against them; and, probably, to avert its effects, they resolved to attend their duty in the house of lords no longer; but drew up a protest, which was signed by twelve of them, in which they declared, that being hindered by the populace from attending at the house of lords, they resolved to go there no more till all commotions should be appeased; pro∣testing, in the mean time, against all such laws as should be enacted in their absence.</P>
<P>This secession of the bishops from the house of lords was what the commons most ardently
<PB N="252" REF="254"/>
wished for; and they seized the opportunity with pleasure. An impeachment of high trea∣son was immediately sent up against them, as guilty of subverting the fundamental laws, and invalidating the legislative authority. In consequence of this, they were by the lords excluded from parliament, and committed to custody, no man in either house daring to speak a word in their vindication. One of the lords, indeed, was heard to say, that he did not believe they were guilty of treason, but he thought they were mad, and therefore were fitter for Bedlam, than a seat in parliament.</P>
<P>This was a fatal blow to the royal interest; but it soon felt a much greater from the king's own imprudence. Charles had long suppressed his resentment and only strove to satisfy the commons by the greatness of his concessions; but finding that all his compliance had but encreased their demands, he could no longer contain. He gave orders to Herbert, his at∣torney general, to enter an accusation of high treason in the house of peers against lord Kim∣bolton, one of the most popular men of his party, together with five commoners, Sir Ar∣thur Haslerig, Hollis, Hambden, Pym, and Strode. The articles were, that they had trai∣terously endeavoured to subvert the funda∣mental
<PB N="253" REF="255"/>
laws and government of the kingdom; to deprive the king of his regal power, and to impose on his subjects an arbitrary and ty∣rannical authority; that they had invited a foreign army to invade the kingdom; that they had aimed at subverting the very rights and being of parliaments, and had actually raised and countenanced tumults against the king. Men had scarce leisure to wonder at the precipitancy and imprudence of this im∣peachment, when they were astonished by ano∣ther measure, still more rash and more unsup∣ported. A serjeant at arms, in the king's name, demanded of the house the five members, and was sent back without any positive answer. This was followed by a conduct still more ex∣traordinary. The next day the king himself was seen to enter the house of commons alone, advancing through the hall, while all the members stood up to receive him. The speaker withdrew from his chair, and the king took possession of it. Having seated himself, and looked round him for some time, he told the house that he was sorry for the occasion that forced him thither, that he was come in person to seize the members, whom he had accused of high treason, seeing they would not deliver them up to his serjeant at arms. Ad∣dressing
<PB N="254" REF="256"/>
himself to the speaker, he desired to know whether any of them were in the house; but the speaker falling on his knees, replied, that he had neither eyes to see, nor tongue to speak in that place, but as the house was pleas∣ed to direct him; and he asked pardon for being able to give no other answer. He then sate for some time to see if the accused were present; but they had escaped a few minutes before his entry. Thus disappointed, perplexed, and not knowing on whom to rely, he next proceeded, amidst the clamours of the popu∣lace, who continued to cry out, <Q REND="inline">"Privilege! privilege!"</Q> to the common council of the city, and made his complaint to them. The common council only answered his complaints with a contemptuous silence; and on his re∣turn, one of the populace, more insolent than the rest, cried out, <Q REND="inline">"To your tents, O Israel!"</Q> a watch word among the Jews, when they in∣tended to abandon their princes.</P>
<P>When the commons were assembled the next day, they affected the greatest terror, and passed an unanimous vote that the king had violated their privileges, and that they could not assemble again in the same place, till they should have obtained satisfaction, with a guard for their security. They ascribed the last mea∣sure
<PB N="255" REF="257"/>
of the king to the counsels of the papists, and the city was thus filled with groundless consternation.</P>
<P>As the commons had artfully kept up their panic, in order to enflame the populace, and as the city was now only one scene of confu∣sion, the king, afraid of exposing himself to any fresh insult from the fury of the populace, retired to Windsor, overwhelmed with grief, shame, and remorse. There he began to re∣flect on the rashness of his former proceedings; and now too late resolved to make some atone∣ment. He therefore wrote to the parliament, informing them, that he desisted from his for∣mer proceedings against the accused members; and assured them, that upon all occasions he would be as careful of their privileges as of his life or his crown. Thus his former vio∣lence had rendered him hateful to his com∣mons, and his present submission now rendered him contemptible.</P>
<P>The commons had already stript the king of almost all his privileges; the bishops were fled, the judges were intimidated; it now only remained that, after securing the church and the law, they should get possession of the sword also. The power of appointing governors, generals, and levying armies, was still a re∣maining
<PB N="256" REF="258"/>
prerogative of the crown. Having, therefore, first magnified their terrors of po∣pery, which perhaps they actually dreaded, they proceeded to petition that the Tower might be put into their hands, and that Hull, Portsmouth, and the fleet, should be intrusted to persons of their chusing. These were re∣quests, the complying with which levelled all that remained of the ancient constitution; however, such was the necessity of the times, that they were at first contested, and then grant∣ed. At last, every compliance only encreas∣ing the avidity of making fresh demands, the commons desired to have a militia, raised and governed by such officers and commanders as they should nominate, under pretext of secu∣ring them from the Irish papists, of whom they were in great apprehensions.</P>
<P>It was here that Charles first ventured to put a stop to his concessions; and that not by a refusal, but a delay. He was at that time at Dover, attending the queen, and the princess of Orange, who had thought prudent to leave the kingdom. He replied to the petition of the commons, that he had not now leisure to con∣sider a matter of such great importance; and therefore would defer an answer till his return. But the commons were well aware, that though
<PB N="257" REF="259"/>
this was depriving him even of the shadow of power; yet they had now gone too far to re∣cede, and were therefore desirous of leaving him no authority whatsoever, as being con∣scious that themselves would be the first victims to its fury. They alleged, that the dangers and distempers of the nation were such as could endure no longer delay; and unless the king speedily complied with their demands, they should be obliged, both for his safety and that of the kingdom, to dispose of the militia by the authority of both houses, and were re∣solved to do it accordingly. In their remon∣strances to the king, they desired even to be permitted to command the army for an ap∣pointed time; which so exasperated him, that he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"No, not for an hour."</Q> This peremptory refusal broke off all further trea∣ty; and both sides were now resolved to have recourse to arms.</P>
<P>Charles, taking the prince of Wales with him, retired to York, where he found the peo∣ple more loyal, and less infected with the reli∣gious frenzy of the times. He found his cause there backed by a more numerous party than he had expected among the people. The queen, who was in Holland, was making suc∣cessful levies of men and ammunition, by sell∣ing
<PB N="258" REF="260"/>
the crown-jewels. But before war was openly declared the shadow of a negotiation was carried on, rather to serve as a pretence to the people, than with a real design of recon∣ciliation. The king offered proposals to the commons, which he knew they would not ac∣cept; and they, in return, submitted nineteen propositions to his consideration, which, if complied with, would have rendered him en∣tirely subservient to their commands. Their import was, that the privy-council, the prin∣cipal officers of state, the governors of the king's children, the commanders of the forts, his fleet, and army, should be all appointed by, and under the controul of parliament; that papists should be punished by their authority; that the church and liturgy should be reform∣ed at their discretion; and that such members as had been displaced, should be restored. These proposals, which, if they had been complied with, would have moulded the government in∣to an aristocracy, were, happily for posterity, re∣jected by the king.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Should I grant these de∣mands, said he, in his reply, I might be waited on bare-headed; I might have my hand kissed, the title of majesty be continued to me, and the king's authority signified by both houses of parliament, might be still the style of
<PB N="259" REF="261"/>
your commands; I might have swords and maces carried before me, and please myself with the sight of a crown and sceptre (tho' even these twigs would not long flourish, when the stock upon which they grew was dead): but as to true and real power, I should remain but the outside, but the pic∣ture, but the sign of a king."</Q>
War on any terms was, therefore, esteemed preferable to such an ignominious peace. Thus the king and his parliament mutually reproached each other for beginning a scene of slaughter, of which both were equally culpable.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI. CHARLES I. (Continued.)</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="1642" UNIT="A.D."/> NO period since England began could shew so many instances of courage, abilities, and virtue, as the present fatal opposition called forth into exertion. Now was the time when talents of all kinds, unchecked by authority, were called from the lower ranks of life to dispute for power and pre-eminence. Both sides, equally confident of the justice of their cause, appealed to God to judge of the recti∣tude of their intentions. The parliament was convinced that it fought for heaven, by asserting its regards for a peculiar mode of worship; and the king was not less con∣vinced that his claims were sacred, as he had ever been taught to consider them as of divine original. Thus passion and enthusiasm on each side animated the combatants; and courage, rather than conduct among these un∣disciplined troops, decided the fortune of the day.</P>
<P>Never was contest more unequal than seem∣ed at first between the contending parties; the
<PB N="261" REF="263"/>
king being entirely destitute of every advan∣tage. His revenue had been seized by par∣liament; all the sea-port towns were in their hands, except Newcastle, and thus they were pos∣sessed of the customs, which these could supply; the fleet was at their disposal; all magazines of arms and ammunition were seized for their use; and they had the wishes of all the most active members of the nation.</P>
<P>To oppose this, the king had that acknow∣ledged reverence which was paid to royalty, to give sanction to his cause. The greater part of the nobility adhered to him, as their distinctions must rise or fall with the source of honour. Most of the men of education also, and the ancient gentry, still considered loyalty as a virtue, and armed their tenants and ser∣vants in his cause. With these followers and hopes, therefore, he resolved to take the field, and erected the royal standard at Nottingham.</P>
<P>Manifestoes on the one side and the other were now dispersed throughout the whole kingdom; and the people were universally divided between two factions, distinguished by the names of Cavaliers and Roundheads. The king, to bind himself by the most solemn en∣gagements to his people, made the following protestation before his whole army.</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>"I do promise, in the presence of almighty
<PB N="262" REF="264"/>
God, and as I hope for his blessing and pro∣tection, that I will, to the utmost of my power, defend and maintain the true re∣formed protestant religion, established in the church of England; and, by the grace of God, in the same will live and die.</P><P>I desire that the laws may be ever the measure of my government, and that the liberty and property of the subject may be preserved by them with the same care as my own just rights. And if it please God by his blessing on this army, raised for my necessary defence, to preserve me from the present rebellion, I do solemnly and faith∣fully promise; in the sight of God, to main∣tain the just privileges and freedom of par∣liament, and to govern, to the utmost of my power, by the known statutes and customs of the kingdom; and particularly to observe inviolably the laws to which I have given my consent this parliament. Mean while, if this emergence, and the great necessity to which I am driven, beget any violation of law, I hope it shall be imputed by God and man to the authors of this war, not to me, who have so earnestly laboured to pre∣serve the peace of the kingdom.</P><P>When I willingly fail in these particulars, I shall expect no aid or relief from man,
<PB N="263" REF="265"/>
nor any protection from above. But in this resolution I hope for the chearful assist∣ance of all good men, and am confident of the blessing of heaven."</P></Q>
<P>The sincerity with which this speech was delivered, and the justice of its contents, served to strengthen the king's cause. At first he appeared in a very low condition; besides the train-bands of the county, raised by Sir John Digby, the sheriff, he had not got together three hundred infantry. His cavalry, which composed his chief strength, exceeded not eight hundred, and were very ill provided with arms. However, he was soon gradually reinforced from all quarters; but not being then in a condition to face his enemies, he thought it prudent to retire by slow marches to Derby, and thence to Shrewsbury, in order to countenance the levies which his friends were making in those quarters.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the parliament were not remiss in preparations on their side. They had a magazine of arms at Hull, and Sir John Hotham was appointed governor of that place by parliament. Charles had some time before presented himself before that town, but was re∣fused admission: and from this they drew their principal resources. The forces also, which
<PB N="264" REF="266"/>
had been every where raised on pretence of the service of Ireland, were now more openly en∣listed by the parliament for their own pur∣poses; and the command given to the earl of Essex, a bold man, who rather desired to see monarchy abridged, than totally destroyed. In London, no less than four thousand men were enlisted in one day; and the parliament voted a declaration, which they required every member to subscribe, that they would live and die with their general. Orders were also issued out for loans of money and plate, which were to defend the king, and both houses of parlia∣ment; for they still preserved this style. This brought immense quantities of plate to the treasury; and so great was men's ardour in the cause, that there was more than they could find room for. By these means they found themselves in a short time at the head of six∣teen thousand men; and the earl of Essex led them towards Northampton against the king.</P>
<P>The army of the royalists was not so great as that of Essex; however it was supposed to be better disciplined, and better and conducted. The two sons of the unfortunate Elector Pa∣latine, prince Rupert and prince Maurice, offered their services to the king, and were gladly accepted. A slight advantage gained
<PB N="265" REF="267"/>
by prince Rupert over colonel Sandys, in the beginning, gave great hopes of his future acti∣vity, and inspired the army with resolution to hazard a battle. So little were both armies skilled in the arts and stratagems of war, that they were within six miles of each other before they were acquainted with their mutual ap∣proach; and, what is remarkable, they had been ten days within twenty miles of each other without knowing it.</P>
<P>Edge-Hill was the first place where the two armies were put in array against each other, and the country first drenched in civil slaughter. It was a dreadful sight, to see above thirty thou∣sand of the bravest men in the world, instead of employing their courage abroad, turning it against each other, while the dearest friends, and the nearest kinsmen, embraced opposite sides, and prepared to bury their private re∣gards in factious hatred. In the beginning of this engagement, Sir Faithful Fortescue, who had levied a troop for the Irish war, but had been obliged to serve in the parliamentary ar∣my, deserted to the royalists; and so intimidat∣ed the parliamentary forces, that the whole body of cavalry fled. The right wing of their army followed the example; but the victors too eagerly pursuing, Essex's body of reserve
<PB N="266" REF="268"/>
wheeled upon the rear of the pursuers, and made great havock among them. After the royalists had a little recovered from their sur∣prize, they made a vigorous stand; and both sides, for a time, stood gazing at each other, without sufficient courage to renew the attack. They all night lay under arms, and next morn∣ing found themselves in sight of each other; this had been the time for the king to have struck a decisive blow; he lost the opportunity, and both sides separated with equal loss. Five thousand men are said to have been found dead on the field of battle.</P>
<P>It would be tedious, and no way instructive, to enter into the marchings, and countermarch∣ings of these undisciplined and ill conducted armies: war was a new trade to the English, as they had not seen an hostile engagement in the island for near a century before. The queen came to re-inforce the royal party; she had brought soldiers and ammunition from Holland, and immediately departed to furnish more. But the parliament, who knew its own strength, was no way discouraged. Their de∣mands seemed to encrease in proportion to their losses; and as they were repressed in the field, they grew more haughty in the cabinet. Such governors as gave up their fortresses to the king,
<PB N="267" REF="269"/>
were attainted of high treason. It was in vain for the king to send proposals after any suc∣cess, this only raised their pride and their ani∣mosity. But though this desire in the king to make peace with his subjects was the high∣est encomium on his humanity, yet his long negociations, one of which he carried on at Ox∣ford, were faulty as a warrior. He wasted that time in altercation and treaty, which he should have employed in vigorous exertions in the field.</P>
<P>However, his first campaign, upon the whole, wore a favourable aspect. One victory fol∣lowed after another; Cornwall was reduced to peace and obedience under the king: a victory was gained over the parliamentarians at Strat∣ton Hill, in Devonshire, another at Rounda∣way Down, about two miles from the Devizes; and still a third at Chalgrave Field. Bristol was besieged and taken; and Gloucester was besieged: the battle of Newbury was favour∣able to the royal cause, and great hopes of success were formed from an army in the North, raised by the marquis of Newcastle.</P>
<P>But in this campaign, the two bravest and greatest men of their respective parties were killed; as if it was intended, by the kindness of Providence, that they should be exempted from seeing the miseries and the slaughter
<PB N="268" REF="270"/>
which were shortly to ensue. These were John Hampden, and Lucius Cary, lord Falk∣land.</P>
<P>In an incursion made by prince Rupert to with in about two miles of the enemies quar∣ters, a great booty was obtained. This the parliamentarians attempted to rescue; and Hampden at their head, overtook the royalists on Chalgrave Field. As he was ever the first to enter into the thickest of the battle, he was shot in the shoulder with a brace of bullets, and the bone broke. Some days after, he died in great pain; nor could his whole party, had their army met a total overthrow, have been cast into greater consternation. Even Charles his enemy felt for his disaster, and offered his own surgeon to assist his cure. Hampden, whom we have seen in the beginning of these troubles refuse to pay ship-money, gained, by his inflexible integrity, the esteem even of his enemies. To these he added affa∣bility in conversation, temper, art, eloquence in debate, and penetration in counsel.</P>
<P>But Falkland was still a greater loss, and a greater character. He added to Hamden's se∣vere principles, a politeness and elegance, but then beginning to be known in England. He had boldly withstood the king's pretensions,
<PB N="269" REF="271"/>
while he saw him making a bad use of his power; but when he perceived the design of the parliament, to overturn the religion and the constitution of his country, he changed his side, and stedfastly attached himself to the crown. From the beginning of the civil war, his natural chearfulness and vivacity forsook him; he became melancholy, sad, pale, and negligent of his person. When the two ar∣mies were in sight of each other, and prepar∣ing for the battle of Newbury, he appeared desirous of terminating his life, since he could not compose the miseries of his country. Still anxious for his country alone, he dreaded the too prosperous success of his own party, as much as that of the enemy; and he pro∣fessed that its miseries had broken his heart. His usual cry among his friends, after a deep silence, and frequent sighs, was Peace! Peace! He now said, upon the morning of the en∣gagement, that he was weary of the times, and should leave them before night. He was shot by a musquet-ball in the belly; and his body was next morning found among an heap of slain. His writings, his elegance, his justice, and his courage, deserved such a death of glory: and they found it.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="272"/>The king, that he might make preparations during the winter for the ensuing campaign, and to oppose the designs of the Westminster parliament, called one at Oxford; and this was the first time that England saw two par∣liaments sitting at the same time. His house of peers was pretty full; his house of com∣mons consisted of about an hundred and forty, which amounted to not above half of the other house of commons. From this shadow of a parliament he received some supplies, after which it was prorogued, and never after as∣sembled.</P>
<P>In the mean time the parliament was equally active on their side. They passed an ordi∣nance, commanding all the inhabitants of London and its neighbourhood to retrench a meal a week, and to pay the value of it for the support of the public cause. But what was much more effectual, the Scotch, who considered their claims as similar, led a strong army to their assistance. They levied an army of fourteen thousand men in the east, under the earl of Manchester; they had an army of ten thousand men under Essex, another of nearly the same force, under Sir William Waller. These were superior to any force the king could bring into the field; and were well ap∣pointed
<PB N="271" REF="273"/>
with ammunition, provisions, and pay.</P>
<P>Hostilities,<MILESTONE N="1644" UNIT="A.D."/> which even during the winter season had never been wholly discontinued, were renewed in spring with their usual fury, and served to desolate the kingdom, without deciding victory. Each county joined that side to which it was addicted from motives of conviction, interest, or fear, though some observed a perfect neutrality. Several fre∣quently petitioned for peace; and all the wise and good were earnest in the cry. What par∣ticularly deserves remark, was an attempt of the women of London; who, to the number of two or three thousand, went in a body to the house of commons, earnestly demanding a peace. <Q REND="inline">"Give us those traitors, said they, that are against a peace; give them, that we my tear them in pieces."</Q> The guards found some difficutly in quelling this insurrection, and one or two women lost their lives in the fray.</P>
<P>The battle of Marston-Moor was the be∣ginning of the king's misfortunes and disgrace. The Scotch and parliamentarian army had join∣ed, and were besieging York; when prince Ru∣pert, joined by the marquis of Newcastle, de∣termined to raise the siege. Both sides drew
<PB N="272" REF="274"/>
up on Marston-Moor, to the number of fifty thousand, and the victory seemed long unde∣cided between them. Rupert, who command∣ed the right wing of the royalists, was opposed by Oliver Cromwell, who now first came into notice, at the head of a body of troops, whom he had taken care to levy and discipline. Crom∣well was victorious; he pushed his opponents off the field, followed the vanquished, return∣ed to a second engagement, and a second vic∣tory; the prince's whole train of artillery was taken, and the royalists never after recovered the blow.</P>
<P>While the king was unfortunate in the field, he was not more successful in negociation. A treaty was begun at Uxbridge, which, like all others, came to nothing. The puritans de∣manded a total abolition of the episcopacy, and all church ceremonies; and these Charles, from conviction, from interest, and persuasion, was not willing to permit. He had all along ad∣hered to the episcopal jurisdiction, not only because it was favourable to monarchy, but because all his adherents were passionately de∣voted to it. He esteemed bishops as essential to the christian church; and thought himself bound, not only by temporal, but sacred ties, to defend them. The parliament was as ob∣stinately
<PB N="273" REF="275"/>
bent upon removing this order; and to shew their resolution, began with the fore∣most of the number.</P>
<P>William Laud, archbishop of Canterbury, as we have already seen, had been imprisoned in the Tower at the same time with Strafford; and he had patiently endured so long a con∣finement, without being brought to any trial. He was now, therefore, accused of high trea∣son, in endeavouring to subvert the fundamen∣tal laws, and of other high crimes and misde∣meanors. The groundless charge of popery, which his life, and afterwards his death belied, was urged against him. In his defence, he spoke several hours, with that courage which seems the result of innocence and integrity. The lords, who were his judges, appeared willing to acquit him; but the commons, his accusers, finding how his trial was likely to go, passed an ordinance for his execution, and terrified the lords who conti∣nued obstinate to give their consent. Seven peers alone voted in this important question; all the rest, either from shame or fear, did not appear. When brought to the scaffold, this venerable prelate, without any terror, but in the usual tone of his exhortations from the pulpit, made the people a long speech. He told them that he had examined his heart;
<PB N="274" REF="276"/>
and thanked God that he found no sins there, which deserved the death he was going to suf∣fer. The king, he said, had been traduced by some, as labouring to introduce popery; but he believed him as sound a protestant as any man in the kingdom; and as for parlia∣ments, though he disliked the conduct of one or two, yet he never designed to change the laws of his country, or the protestant religion. After he had prayed for a few minutes, the executioner severed his head at a blow. It is indeed a melancholy consideration, that in these times of trouble, the best men were those on either side who chiefly suffered.</P>
<P>The death of Laud was followed by a total alteration of the ceremonies of the church. The Liturgy was, by a public act, abolished the day he died, as if he had been the only obstacle to its former removal. The church of England was in all respects brought to a conformity to the pu∣ritanical establishment; while the citizens of London, and the Scotch army, gave public thanks for so happy an alteration.</P>
<P>The total abolition of the reformed reli∣gion, as established by queen Elizabeth, seemed at first to promise vigour and consistence to the counsels of the parliamentarians. But such is the nature of man, that if he does not
<PB N="275" REF="277"/>
find, he makes opposition. From the moment the puritans began to be apparently united, and ranked under one denomination of presby∣terians, they began again to divide into fresh parties, each professing different views and in∣terests. One part of the house was composed of Presbyterians, strictly so called; the other, though a minority, of Independents, a new sect that had lately been introduced, and gain∣ed ground surprisingly.</P>
<P>The difference between these two sects would be hardly worth mentioning, did not their re∣ligious opinions influence their political con∣duct. The church of England, as we have seen, had appointed bishops of clerical ordi∣nation, and a book of common prayer. The presbyterians exclaimed against both; they were for having the church governed by cler∣gymen elected by the people, and prayers made without premeditation. The independents went still farther; they excluded all the clergy, they maintained that every man might pray in public, exhort his audience, and explain the scriptures. Their political system kept pace with their religious. Not contented with re∣ducing the king to a first magistrate, which was the aim of the presbyterians, this sect aspired at the abolition not only of all monar∣chy,
<PB N="276" REF="278"/>
but of all subordination. They main∣tained, and they maintained right, that all men were born equal; but they alleged also, that no accidental or artificial institutions could de∣stroy this equality; and there they were de∣ceived. Could such a plan of government as theirs be practicable, it would no doubt be the most happy; but the wise and industrious must in every country prevail over the weak and idle; and the bad success of the inde∣pendent scheme soon after shewed how ill adapted such speculative ideas were to human infirmity. Possessed, however, with an high idea of their own rectitude, both in religion and politics, they gave way to a surly pride, which is ever the result of narrow manners and solitary thinking.</P>
<P>These were a body of men that were now growing into consideration; their apparent sanctity, their natural courage excited by en∣thusiasm, and their unceasing perseverance, began to work considerable effects; and tho' they were out-numbered in the house of com∣mons, which was composed of more enlight∣ened minds, they formed a majority in the army, made up chiefly of the lowest of the vulgar.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="279"/>The royalists endeavoured to throw a ridi∣cule on this fanaticism, without being sensible how much reason they had to apprehend its dangerous consequences. The forces of the king were united by much feebler ties; and licence among them, which had been intro∣duced by the want of pay, had arisen to a dan∣gerous height, rendering them as formidable to their friends as their enemies. To encrease this unpopularity, the king finding the par∣liament of Scotland as well as that of Eng∣land declaring against him, thought proper to make a truce with the papists of Ireland, in or∣der to bring over the English forces who served in that kingdom. With these troops he also received some of the native Irish into his service, who still retained their fierceness and their barbarity. This gave the parliament a plausible opportunity of upbraiding him with taking papists into his service, and gave a co∣lour to the ancient calumny of his having ex∣cited them to rebel. Unfortunately, too soon after it was found, that they rather encreased the hatred of his subjects, than added to the strength of his army. They were routed by Fairfax, one of the generals of the parliament army; and though they threw down their arms they were slaughtered without mercy.
<PB N="278" REF="280"/>
It is said that several women were found among the slain, who with long knives had done con∣siderable execution; but the animosity of the English against these wretches at that time, might have given rise to the report.</P>
<P>These misfortunes were soon after succeeded by another. Charles, who had now retired to Oxford, found himself at the head of a tur∣bulent seditious army, who, from wanting pay, were scarcely subject to control; while, on the other hand, the parliamentarians were well supplied and paid, and held together from principle. The parliament, to give them an example of disinterestedness in their own con∣duct, passed an act, called the <HI>Self-denying or∣dinance,</HI> which deserved all commendation. They resolved, lest it should be suggested by the nation that their intent was to make themselves masters, that no member of their house should have a command in the army. The former generals were therefore changed; the earls of Essex, Denbigh, and Manchester, gave up their commissions; and Fairfax, who was now appointed general with Cromwell, who found means to keep at once his seat and his commission, new modelled the army. This, which might at first have seemed to weaken their forces, gave them new spirit; and the
<PB N="279" REF="281"/>
soldiers, become more confident in their new commanders, were irresistible.</P>
<P>Never was a more singular army assembled than that which now drew the sword in the par∣liamentary cause. The officers exercised the office of chaplains; and, during the intervals of action, instructed their troops by sermons, prayers, and exhortations. Rapturous ecsta∣cies supplied the place of study and reflection; and while they kindled as they spoke, they ascribed their own warmth to a descent of the spirit from heaven. The private soldiers, seized with the same spirit, employed their va∣cant hours in prayer, in perusing the holy scriptures, in ghostly conferences. When marching to the field of battle, the hymn and the ejaculation, mixed their notes with those of the trumpet. An army thus actuated be∣came invincible.</P>
<P>The well-disputed battle, which decided the fate of Charles, was fought at Naseby,<MILESTONE N="June 14, 1645."/> a vil∣lage in Yorkshire. The main body of the royal army was commanded by lord Ast∣ley, prince Rupert led the right wing, Sir Marmaduke Langdale the left, and the king himself headed the body of reserve. On the opposite side, Fairfax and Skippon command∣ed the main body; Cromwell led on the right
<PB N="280" REF="282"/>
wing, and Ireton, his son-in-law, the left. Prince Rupert attacked the left wing with his usual impetuosity and success: they were broke and pursued as far as the village; but he lost time in attempting to make himself master of their artillery. Cromwell, in the mean time, was equally successful on his side, and broke through the enemies horse after a very obstinate resistance. While these were thus engaged, the infantry on both sides main∣tained the conflict with equal ardour; but in spite of the efforts of Fairfax and Skippon, their battalions began to give way. But it was now that Cromwell returned with his vic∣torious forces, and charged the king's infantry in flank with such vigour, that a total rout began to ensue. By this time prince Rupert had rejoined the king, and the small body of reserve; but his troops, though victorious, could not be brought to a second charge. They were at all times licentious and ungo∣vernable; but they were now intimidated; for the parliamentarians having recovered from the first shock, stood ready in order of battle to receive them. The king was de∣sirous of charging them at the head of his re∣serve; but the earl of Carnwarth, who rode by his majesty's side, seizing the bridle of his
<PB N="281" REF="283"/>
horse, turned him round, saying, with a loud oath,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Will you go upon your death in an instant."</Q>
The troops seeing this motion, wheeled to the right, and rode off in such con∣fusion, that they could not be rallied again during the rest of the day. The king per∣ceiving the battle wholly lost, was obliged to abandon the field to his enemies, who took all his cannon, baggage, and above five thou∣sand prisoners.</P>
<P>This fatal blow the king never after reco∣vered; his army was dispersed, and the con∣querors made as many captives as they thought proper. Among the other spoils taken on this occasion, the king's cabinet of letters was seized, in which was contained all his private correspondence with the queen. These were shortly after published by the command of the parliament, who took a vulgar and brutal plea∣sure in ridiculing all those tender effusions which were never drawn up for the public eye.</P>
<P>The battle of Naseby put the parliament∣arians in possession of almost all the strong ci∣ties of the kingdom. Bristol, Bridgewater, Chester, Sherborn, and Bath. Exeter was be∣sieged; and all the king's troops in the west∣ern counties being entirely dispersed, Fairfax pressed the place, and it surrendered at dis∣cretion.
<PB N="282" REF="284"/>
The king's interests seemed going to ruin on every quarter. The Scotch army, which, as has been said, took part with the par∣liament, having made themselves masters of Carlisle after an obstinate siege, marched south and laid siege to Hereford. Another en∣gagement followed between the king and the parliamentarians, in which his forces were put to the rout by colonel Jones, a thousand of his men made prisoners, and five hundred slain. Thus surrounded, harrassed on every side, he retreated to Oxford, that in all con∣ditions of his fortune had held steady to his cause; and there he resolved to offer new terms to his victorious pursuers.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more affecting than the king's situation during his abode at Oxford. Saddened by his late melancholy disasters, im∣pressed with the apprehensions of such as hung over him, harrassed by the murmurs of those who had followed his cause, and stung with sorrow for his incapacity to relieve them. He now was willing to grant the parliament their own terms, and at any rate to procure a reconciliation. He therefore sent them repeated messages to this purpose, but they never deigned to make him the least reply. At last, after reproaching him with the blood spilt dur∣ing
<PB N="283" REF="285"/>
the war, they told him that they were preparing some bills, to which if he would consent, they would then be able to judge of his pacific inclinations.</P>
<P>In the mean time Fairfax was approaching with a powerful and victorious army, and was taking the proper measures of laying siege to Oxford, which promised an easy surrender. To be taken captive, and led in triumph by his insolent subjects, was what Charles justly abhorred; and every insult and violence was to be dreaded from the soldiery, who had felt the effects of his opposition. In this despe∣rate extremity he embraced a measure which, in any other situation, might justly lie under the imputation of imprudence and indiscretion. He resolved to give himself up to the Scotch army, who had never testified such implacable animosity against him, and to trust to their loyalty for the rest.</P>
<P>That he might the better conceal his design from the people of Oxford, orders were given at every gate of the city for allowing three persons to pass. In the night, the king, ac∣companied by one doctor Hudson, and Mr. Ashburnham, took the road towards London, travelling as Ashburnham's servant. He, in fact, came so near London, that he once en∣tertained
<PB N="284" REF="286"/>
some thoughts of entering that city, and of throwing himself on the mercy of the parliament. At last, after passing through many cross-roads and bye-ways, he arrived at the Scotch camp before Newark, and disco∣vered himself to lord Leven,<MILESTONE N="Jan. 30, 1646."/> the Scotch ge∣neral.</P>
<P>The Scotch, who had before given him some general assurances of their fidelity and protection, now seemed greatly surprised at his arrival among them. Instead of bestow∣ing a thought on his interests, they instantly entered into a consultation upon their own. The commissioners of their army sent up an account of the king's arrival to the parlia∣ment, and declared, that his coming was al∣together uninvited and unexpected. In the mean time they prevailed upon the king to give directions for surrendering all his garri∣sons to the parliament, with which he com∣plied. In return for this condescension they treated him with very long sermons among the ecclesiastics, and with the most cautious reserve, but very different from respect, among the officers. The preachers of the party in∣deed insulted him from the pulpit; and one of them, after reproaching him to his face with his misconduct, ordered that psalm to be
<PB N="285" REF="287"/>
sung, which begins,
<Q><L>"Why dost thou, Tyrant, boast thyself</L>
<L>Thy wicked deeds to praise."</L></Q>
The king stood up, and called for that Psalm, which begins with these words:
<Q><L>"Have mercy, Lord, on me I pray,</L>
<L>For men would me devour."</L></Q>
The audience accordingly sung this Psalm in compassion to majesty in distress.</P>
<P>The parliament being informed of the king's captivity, immediately entered into a treaty with the Scotch about delivering up their pri∣soner. The Scotch had, from their first entrance into England, been allowed pay by the par∣liament, in order to prevent their plundering the country; much of this, however, remain∣ed unpaid, from the unavoidable necessities of the times, and much more was claimed by the Scotch than was really due. Neverthe∣less, they now saw this a convenient time for insisting on their arrears; and they resolved to make the king the instrument by which this money was to be obtained. After various de∣bates upon this head between them and the parliament, in which they pretended to great honour, and insisted upon many punctilios, they agreed, that upon payment of four hun∣dred
<PB N="286" REF="288"/>
thousand pounds they would deliver up the king to his enemies, and this was chear∣fully complied with. An action so atrocious may be palliated, but can never be defended; they returned home laden with plunder, and the reproaches of all good men.</P>
<P>From this period, to the despotic govern∣ment of Cromwell, the constitution was con∣vulsed with all the agitations of faction, guilt, ignorance, and enthusiasm. The kingly power being laid low, the parliament attempted to assume the rein; but they were soon to submit in turn to the military power, which, like all democracies, was turbulent, transient, feeble, and bloody.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII. CHARLES I. (Continued.)</HEAD>
<P>THE king being delivered over by the Scotch to the parliamentary commissioners, he was conducted under a guard to Holmby Cas∣tle, in Northamptonshire. They treated him in confinement with the most rigorous seve∣rity, dismissing all his ancient servants, debar∣ring him from all visits, and cutting off all communication with his friends and family.</P>
<P>The civil war was now over; the king had absolved his followers from their allegiance, and the parliament had now no enemy to fear, except those very troops by which they had extended their overgrown authority. But in proportion as the terror of the king's power diminished, the divisions between the inde∣pendents and the presbyterians became more apparent. The majority in the house were of the presbyterian sect; but the majority of the army were staunch independents. At the head of this sect was Cromwell, who secretly directed its operations, and invigorated all their measures.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="290"/>Oliver Cromwell, whose talents now began to appear in full lustre, was the son of a pri∣vate gentleman of Huntingdon; but being the son of a second brother, he inherited a very small paternal fortune. He had been sent to Cambridge; but his inclinations not at that time turning to the calm occupations of elegant literature, he was remarkable only for the profligacy of his conduct, and the wasting his paternal fortune. It was, perhaps, his poverty that induced him to fall into the opposite extreme shortly after; for, from being one of the most debauched men in the king∣dom, he became the most rigid and abstemious. The same vehemence of temper, which had transported him into the extremes of pleasure, now distinguished his religious habits. He endeavoured to improve his shattered fortunes by agriculture; but this expedient served only to plunge him in further difficulties. He was even determined to go over and settle in New England; but was hindered by the king's or∣dinance to the contrary. From accident or intrigue, he was chosen member for the town of Cambridge, in the long parliament; but he seemed at first to possess no talents for oratory, his person being ungraceful, his dress slovenly, his elocution homely, tedious, obscure, and
<PB N="289" REF="291"/>
embarrassed. He made up, however, by zeal and perseverance, what he wanted in natural powers; and being endowed with unshaken in∣trepidity, much dissimulation, and a thorough conviction of the rectitude of his cause, he rose, through the gradations of preferment, to the post of lieutenant-general under Fairfax; but, in reality, possessing the supreme command over the whole army.</P>
<P>Soon after the retreat of the Scotch, the presbyterian party, seeing every thing reduced to obedience, began to talk of dismissing a considerable part of the army, and to send the rest to Ireland. It may easily be supposed, that for every reason the army were as unwil∣ling to disband, as to be led over into a coun∣try as yet uncivilized, uncultivated, and bar∣barous. Cromwell took care to inspire them with an horror of either; they loved him for his bravery and religious zeal, and still more for his seeming affection to them. Instead, therefore, of preparing to disband, they resolv∣ed to petition; and they began by desiring an indemnity, ratified by the king, for any illegal actions which they might have commit∣ted during the war. This the commons, in turn, treated with great severity; they voted, that this petition tended to introduce mutiny,
<PB N="290" REF="292"/>
to put conditions upon the parliament, to obstruct the relief of the kingdom of Ireland; and they threatened to proceed against the promoters of it as enemies to the state and disturbers of the public peace.</P>
<P>The army now began to consider themselves as a body distinct from the commonwealth; and complained, that they had secured the general tranquility, while they were, at the same time, deprived of the privileges of Eng∣lishmen. In opposition, therefore, to the par∣liament at Westminster, a military parliament was formed, composed of the officers and common soldiers of each regiment. The prin∣cipal officers formed a council to represent the body of peers; the soldiers elected two men out of each company to represent the house of commons, and these were called the Agita∣tors of the army. Cromwell took care to be one of the number, and thus contrived an easy method under-hand of conducting and pro∣moting the sedition of the army.</P>
<P>This fierce assembly having debated for a very short time, declared, that they found many grievances to be redressed; and began by specifying such as they desired to be most speedily removed. The very same conduct which had formerly been used with success by
<PB N="291" REF="293"/>
the parliament against their sovereign, was now put in practice by the army against the par∣liament. As the commons granted every re∣quest, the agitators rose in their demands; these accused the army of mutiny and sedition; the army retorted the charge, and alledged, that the king had been deposed only to make way for their usurpations.</P>
<P>The unhappy king, in the mean time, con∣tinued a prisoner at Holmby castle; and as his countenance might add some authority to that side which should obtain it, Cromwell, who secretly conducted all the measures of the army, while he apparently exclaimed against their violence, resolved to seize the king's person. Accordingly a party of five hundred horse appeared at Holmby castle, under the command of one Joyce, who had been originally a taylor; but who, in the present confusion of all ranks and orders, was advan∣ced to the rank of cornet. Without any op∣position he entered the king's apartment, armed with pistols, and told him, that he must prepare to go with him. Whither? said the king, To the army, replied Joyce. By what warrant? asked the king. Joyce pointed to his followers.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your warrant, replied Charles is wrote in fair characters."</Q>
And then
<PB N="292" REF="294"/>
without further delay he went into his coach, and was safely conducted to the army who were hastening to their rendezvous at Triplo∣heath, near Cambridge. The next day Crom∣well arrived among them, where he was receiv∣ed with acclamations of joy, and was instantly invested with the supreme command.</P>
<P>It was now that the commons perceived a settled design in the army to prescribe laws to their employers; and they did not fail to spread the alarm through the city. But it was too late to resist; the army, with Cromwell at their head, advanced with precipitation, and arrived in a few days at St Alban's; so that the commons now began to think of tempo∣rizing. The declaration, by which they had voted the military petitioners enemies to the state, was recalled, and erazed from their journal book. But all submission was be∣come vain; the army still rose in their de∣mands, in proportion as those demands were gratified, until at last they entirely threw off the mask, and claimed a right of modelling the whole government, and settling the na∣tion.</P>
<P>But as too precipitate an assumption of au∣thority might appear invidious, Cromwell be∣gan
<PB N="293" REF="295"/>
by accusing eleven members of the house as guilty of high treason, and enemies to the army. The members accused were the very leaders of the presbyterian party, the very men who had prescribed such rigorous measures to the king, and now, in their turn, were threa∣tened with popular resentment. As they were the leading men in the house, the commons were willing to protect them; but the army insisting on their dismission, they voluntarily left the house, rather than be compelled to withdraw.</P>
<P>At last, the citizens of London, who had been ever foremost in sedition, began to open their eyes, and to perceive that the constitution was totally overturned. They saw an oppres∣sive parliament now subjected to a more op∣pressive army; they found their religion abo∣lished, their king a captive, and no hopes of redress but from another scene of slaughter. In this exigence, therefore, the common-coun∣cil assembled the militia of the city; the works were manned, and a manifesto published, ag∣gravating the hostile intentions of the army. Finding that the house of commons, in com∣pliance with the request of the army, had voted that the city militia should be disbanded, the multitude rose, besieged the door of the
<PB N="294" REF="296"/>
house, and obliged them to reverse that vote which they had passed so lately.</P>
<P>In this manner was this wretched house in∣timidated on either side, obliged at one time to obey the army, at another, to comply with the clamours of the city rabble. This assembly was, in consequence, divided into parties, as usual, one part siding with the seditious citi∣zens; while the minority, with the two speakers at their head, were for encouraging the army. In such an universal confusion, it is not to be ex∣pected that any thing less than a separation of the parties could take place; and accord∣ingly the two speakers, with sixty two mem∣bers, secretly retired from the house, and threw themselves under the protection of the army, that were then at Hounslow-heath. They were received with shouts and acclamations, their integrity was extolled, and the whole body of the soldiery, a formidable force of twenty-thousand men, now moved forward to rein∣state them in their former seats and stations.</P>
<P>In the mean time, that part of the house that was left behind, resolved to act with vigour, and resist the encroachments of the army. They chose new speakers, they gave orders for enlisting troops, they ordered the train∣bands to man the lines; and the whole city,
<PB N="295" REF="297"/>
boldly resolved to resist the invasion. But this resolution only held while the enemy was thought at a distance, for when the formida∣ble force of Cromwell appeared, all was obe∣dience and submission; the gates were opened to the general, who attended the two speakers, and the rest of the members, peaceably to their habitations. The eleven impeached members, being accused as causes of the tumult, were expelled, and most of them retired to the con∣tinent. The mayor, sheriff, and three alder∣men, were sent to the Tower; several citizens, and officers of militia, were committed to pri∣son, and the lines about the city were levelled to the ground. The command of the Tower was given to Fairfax, the general; and the par∣liament ordered him their hearty thanks for having disobeyed their commands.</P>
<P>It now only remained to dispose of the king, who had been sent by the army a prisoner to Hampton-Court. The independent army, at the head of whom was Cromwell, on one hand; and the presbyterians in the name of either house, on the other hand, treated separately with him in private. He had at one time even hopes, that in these struggles for power, he might have been chosen mediator in the dis∣pute; and he expected that the kingdom, at
<PB N="296" REF="298"/>
last sensible of the miseries of anarchy, would, like a froward child, hushed with its own im∣portunities, settle into its former tranquil con∣stitution. However, in all his miseries and doubts, though at first led about with the army, and afterwards kept a prisoner by them at Hampton, such was his admirable equality of temper, that no difference was perceived in his countenance and behaviour. Though a captive in the hands of his most inveterate enemies, he still supported the dignity of a monarch; and he never one moment sunk from the consciousness of his own superio∣rity.</P>
<P>It is true, that at first he was treated with some flattering marks of distinction; he was permitted to converse with his old servants, his chaplains were admitted to attend him, and celebrate divine service their own way. But the most exquisite pleasure he enjoyed was in the company of his children, with whom he had several interviews. The meet∣ing on these occasions was so pathetic, that Cromwell himself, who was once present, could not help being moved; he was heard to declare, that he had never beheld such an affecting scene before; and we must do justice to this man's feelings, as he was himself a tenderfather.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="299"/>But those flattering instances of respect and submission were of no long continuance. As soon as the army had gained a complete victory over the house of commons, the independents began to abate of their expressions of duty and re∣spect. The king therefore was now more strictly guarded: they would hardly allow his domestics to converse with him in private, and spies were employed to mark all his words and actions. He was every hour threatened with false dangers of Cromwell's contrivance; by which he was taught to fear for his personal safety. The spies and creatures of that cunning man, were sedulously employed in raising the king's terrors, and representing to him the danger of his situation. These, therefore, at length pre∣vailed, and Charles resolved to withdraw him∣self from the army. Cromwell considered, that if he should escape the kingdom, there would be then a theatre open to his ambition; if he should be apprehended, the late attempt would aggravate his guilt, and apologize for any succeeding severity.</P>
<P>Early in the evening the king retired to his chamber, on pretence of being indisposed; and about an hour after midnight, he went down the back-stairs, attended by Ashburn∣ham and Legg, both gentlemen of his bed∣chamber.
<PB N="298" REF="300"/>
Sir John Berkeley waited for him at the garden-gate with horses, which they in∣stantly mounted, and travelling through the Forest all night, arrived at Tichfield, the seat of the earl of Southampton. Before he arrived at this place, had gone towards the shore, and expressed great anxiety that a ship, which Ash∣burnham had promised to be in readiness, was not to be seen. At Tichfield he deliberated with his friends upon his next excursion, and they advised him to cross over to the Isle of Wight, where Hammond was governor; who, though a creature of Cromwell's, was yet a nephew of one doctor Hammond, the king's chaplain. To this inauspicious protector it was resolved to have recourse; Ashburnham and Berkeley were sent before to exact a pro∣mise from this officer, that if he would not protect the king, he would not detain him. Hammond seemed surprised at their demand; expressed his inclination to serve his majesty, but at the same time alledged his duty to his employers. He therefore attended the king's gentlemen to Tichfield, with a guard of sol∣diers, and staid in a lower apartment while Ashburnham went up to the king's chamber. Charles no sooner understood that Hammond was in the house with a body of troops, than
<PB N="299" REF="301"/>
he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"O Jack! thou hast undone me!"</Q> Ashburnham shed a flood of tears, and offered to go down and dispatch the governor, but the king repressed his ardour. When Ham∣mond came into his presence, he repeated his professions of regard; Charles submitted to his fate; and, without further delay, attended him to Carisbrook castle, in the Isle of Wight, where at first he found himself treated with marks of duty and respect.</P>
<P>While the king continued in this forlorn situation, the parliament, new modelled as it was by the army, was every day growing more feeble and factious. Cromwell, on the other hand, was strengthening the army, and taking every precaution to repress any tendency to factious division among them. Nor were his fears without just cause; for had it not been for the quickness of his penetration, and the boldness of his activity, the whole army would have been thrown into a state of ungovernable frenzy.</P>
<P>Among the independents, who, in general, were for having no ecclesiastical subordination, a set of men grew up called <HI>Levellers,</HI> who dis∣allowed all subordination whatsoever, and de∣clared that they would have no other chap∣lain, king, or general, but Christ. They de∣clared
<PB N="300" REF="302"/>
that all men were equal; that all de∣grees and ranks should be levelled, and an exact partition of property established in the nation. This ferment spread through the army; and as it was a doctrine well suited to the poverty of the daring soldiery, it promised every day to become more dangerous and fatal. Several petitions were presented, urging the justice of a partition, and threatening vengeance in case of refusing redress.</P>
<P>Cromwell now saw that he was upon the point of losing all the fruits of his former schemes and dangers, and dreaded this new faction still more, as they turned his own pre∣tended principles against himself. Thus find∣ing all at stake, he resolved, by one resolute blow, to disperse the faction, or perish in the attempt. Having intimation that the levellers were to meet at a certain place, be unexpected∣ly appeared before the terrified assembly, at the head of his red regiment, which had been hi∣therto invincible. He demanded, in the name of God, what these meetings and murmurings meant; he expostulated with them upon the danger and consequence of their precipitate schemes, and desired them immediately to de∣part. But instead of obeying, they returned an insolent answer; wherefore, rushing on them
<PB N="301" REF="303"/>
in a fury, he laid, with his own hands, two of them dead at his feet. His guards dispersing the rest, he caused several of them to be hang∣ed upon the spot, he sent others prisoners to London; and thus dissipated a faction, no otherwise criminal than in having followed his own example.</P>
<P>This action served still more to encrease the power of Cromwell in the camp, and in the parliament; and while Fairfax was nominally general of the troops, he was invested with all the power. But his authority soon became irresistible, in consequence of a new and unex∣pected addition to his successes. The Scotch, perhaps ashamed of the reproach of having sold their king, and stimulated farther by the independents, who took all occasions to mor∣tify them, raised an army in his favour, and the chief command was given to the earl of Ha∣milton; while Langdale, who professed him∣self at the head of the more bigotted party, who had taken the covenant, marched at the head of his separate body, and both invaded the North of England. Their two armies amounted to above twenty thousand men. But Cromwell, at the head of eight thousand of his hardy veterans, feared not to give them battle; he attacked them one after the other,
<PB N="302" REF="304"/>
routed and dispersed them, took Hamilton prisoner; and, following his blow, entered Scot∣land, where he settled the government entirely to his satisfaction. An insurrection in Kent, was quelled by Fairfax, at the same time with the same ease; and nothing but success attend∣ed all this bold usurper's criminal attempts.</P>
<P>During these contentions, the king, who was kept a prisoner at Carisbrook, continued to negociate with the parliament for settling the unspeakable calamities of the kingdom. The parliament saw no other method of destroying the military power, but to depress it by the kingly. Frequent proposals for an accommo∣dation passed between the captive king and the commons; but the great obstacle which had all along stood in the way, still kept them from agreeing. This was the king's refusing to abo∣lish episcopacy, though he consented to de∣stroy the liturgy of the church. However, the treaty was still carried on with vigour, as the parliament had more to apprehend from the designs of their generals, than from the attempts of the king; and, for the first time, they seemed in earnest to conclude their nego∣ciations.</P>
<P>But all was now too late; their power was soon totally to expire, for the rebellious army,
<PB N="303" REF="305"/>
crowned with success, was returned from the destruction of their enemies; and, sensible of their own power, with furious remonstrances be∣gan to demand vengeance on the king. At the same time they advanced to Windsor; and send∣ing an officer to seize the king's person, where he was lately sent under confinement, they con∣veyed him to Hurst-castle, in Hampshire, op∣posite the Isle of Wight. It was in vain that the parliament complained of this harsh proceeding, as being contrary to their approbation; it was in vain that they began to issue ordinances for a more effectual opposition; they received a message from Cromwell, that he intended pay∣nig them a visit the next day with his army; and in the mean time, ordered them to raise him forty thousand pounds upon the city of London.</P>
<P>The commons, however, though destitute of all hopes of prevailing, had still courage to resist, and attempted, in the face of the whole army, to close their treaty with the king. They had taken into consideration the whole of his concessions; and though they had for∣merly voted them unsatisfactory, they now renewed the consultation with fresh vigour. After a violent debate, which had lasted three days, it was carried in the king's favour by a

majority of an hundred and twenty-nine against eighty-three, that his concessions were a foun∣dation for the houses to proceed upon in the settlement of the kingdom. This was the last attempt in his favour; for the next day Co∣lonel Pride, at the head of two regiments, blockaded the house, and seized in the passage forty-one members of the presbyterian party; and sent them to a low room belonging to the house, that passed by the denomination of Hell. Above an hundred and sixty mem∣bers more were excluded: and none were allowed to enter but the most furious and determined of the independents, in all not exceeding sixty. This atrocious invasion of the parliamentary rights, commonly passed by the name of Pride's purge, and the remain∣ing members were called the Rump. These soon voted, that the transactions of the house a few days before were entirely illegal, and that their general's conduct was just and neces∣sary.</P>
<P>Nothing now remained after the constitution had been destroyed, after the parliament had been ejected, after the religion of the country had been abolished, after the bravest and the best of its subjects had been slain, but to mur∣der the king! This vile parliament, if it now deserves the name, was composed of a medley
<PB N="305" REF="307"/>
of the most obscure citizens, and the officers of the army. In this assembly, therefore, a committee was appointed to bring in a charge against the king; and, on their report, a vote passed, declaring it treason in a king to levy war against his parliament. It was therefore resolved that an High Court of Justice should be appointed to try his majesty for this new∣invented treason. For form sake they desired the concurrence of the few remaining lords in the other house; but here there was virtue enough left unanimously to reject the horrid proposal.</P>
<P>But the commons were not to be stopped by so small an obstacle. They voted, that the concurrence of the house of lords was unne∣cessary; they voted, that the people were the origin of all just power, a fact which, though true, they could never bring home to them∣selves. To add to their zeal, a woman of Herefordshire, illuminated by prophetical vi∣sions, desired admittance, and communicated a revelation which she had received from hea∣ven. She assured them that their measures were consecrated from above, and ratified by the sanction of the Holy Ghost. This intelli∣gence gave them great comfort, and much confirmed them in their present resolutions.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="308"/>Colonel Harrison, the son of a butcher, was commanded to conduct the king from Hurst castle to Windsor, and from thence to London. His afflicted subjects, who ran to have a sight of their sovereign, were greatly affected at the change that appeared in his face and person. He had allowed his beard to grow; his hair was become venerably grey, rather by the pressure of anxiety than the hand of time; while the rest of his apparel bore the marks of misfortune and decay. Thus he stood a solitary figure of majesty in distress, which even his adversaries could not behold without reverence and compassion. He had been long attended only by an old decrepid servant, whose name was Sir Philip Warwick, who could only deplore his master's fate, without being able to revenge his cause. All the exterior symbols of sovereignty were now withdrawn; and his new attendants had orders to serve him without ceremony. The duke of Hamilton, who was reserved for the same pu∣nishment with his master, having leave to take a last farewell as he departed from Windsor, threw himself at the king's feet crying out, <Q REND="inline">"My dear master."</Q> The unhappy monarch raised him up, and embracing him tenderly, replied, while the tears ran down his cheeks,
<PB N="307" REF="309"/>
<Q REND="inline">"I have indeed been a dear master to you."</Q> These were severe distresses; however, he could not be persuaded that his adversaries would bring him to a formal trial; but he every moment expected to be dispatched by private assassination.</P>
<P>From the sixth, to the twentieth of January, was spent in making preparations for his ex∣traordinary trial. The court of justice con∣sisted of an hundred and thirty-three persons named by the commons; but of these never above seventy met upon the trial. The members were chiefly composed of the chief officers of the army, most of them of very mean birth, together with some of the lower house, and a few citizens of London. Bradshaw, a law∣yer, was chosen president, Coke was appointed sollicitor for the people of England, Dorislaus, Steele and Aske, were named assistants. The court sat in Westminster-Hall.</P>
<P>The king was now conducted from Wind∣sor to St. James's, and the next day was brought before the high court to take his trial. While the crier was calling over the names of the commissioners for trying him, no body answering for lord Fairfax, a female voice from the gallery was heard to cry out,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He has more wit than to be here."</Q>
When
<PB N="308" REF="310"/>
the impeachment was read in the name of the people of England, the same voice exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"No, nor a tenth part of them."</Q> Axtel, the officer who guarded the court, giving orders to fire into the box from whence the voice proceeded, it was discovered that these bold answers came from the lady Fairfax, who alone had courage to condemn their proceed∣ings.</P>
<P>When the king was brought forward before the court, he was conducted by the mace∣bearer to a chair placed within the bar. Tho' long detained a prisoner, and now produced as a criminal, he still sustained the dignity of a king; he surveyed the members of the court with a stern haughty air, and, without moving his hat, sat down, while the members also were covered. His charge was then read by the sollicitor, accusing him of having been the cause of all the bloodshed which followed since the commencement of the war; at that part of the charge he could not suppress a smile of con∣tempt and indignation. After the charge was finished, Bradshaw directed his discourse to the king, and told him, that the court ex∣pected his answer.</P>
<P>The king with great temper entered upon his defence, by declining the authority of the
<PB N="309" REF="311"/>
court. He represented, that having been en∣gaged in treaty with his two houses of parlia∣ment, and having finished almost every article, he expected a different treatment from that he now received. He perceived, he said, no ap∣pearance of an upper house, which was neces∣sary to constitute a just tribunal. That he was himself the king and fountain of law, and con∣sequently could not be tried by laws to which he had never given his assent; that having been entrusted with the liberties of the people, he would not now betray them, by recogniz∣ing a power founded in usurpation; that he was willing before a proper tribunal to enter into the particulars of his defence; but that before them he must decline any apology for his innocence, lest he should be considered as the betrayer of, and not a martyr for the con∣stitution.</P>
<P>Bradshaw, in order to support the authority of the court, insisted, that they had received their power from the people, the source of all right. He pressed the prisoner not to decline the authority of the court, that was delegated by the commons of England, and interrupted, and over-ruled the king in his attempts to reply.</P>
<P>In this manner the king was three times pro∣duced before the court, and as often persisted
<PB N="310" REF="312"/>
in declining its jurisdiction. The fourth and last time he was brought before this self-creat∣ed court, as he was proceeding thither, he was insulted by the soldiers and the mob, who exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Justice! justice! execution! exe∣cution!"</Q> but he continued undaunted. His judges having now examined some witnes∣ses, by whom it was proved that the king had appeared in arms against the forces commis∣sioned by parliament, they pronounced sen∣tence against him. He seemed very anxious at this time to be admitted to a conference with the two houses; and it was supposed that he intended to resign the crown to his son; but the court refused compliance, and consi∣dered his request as an artifice to delay justice.</P>
<P>The conduct of the king under all these in∣stances of low-bred malice was great, firm, and equal; in going through the hall from this execrable tribunal, the soldiers and rabble were again instigated to cry out justice and execu∣tion. They reviled him with the most bitter reproaches. Among other insults, one mis∣creant presumed to spit in the face of his so∣vereign. He patiently bore their insolence.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Poor souls, cried he, they would treat their generals in the same manner for six pence."</Q>
Those of the populace, who still retained the
<PB N="311" REF="313"/>
feelings of humanity, expressed their sorrow in sighs and tears. A soldier more compas∣sionate than the rest, could not help imploring a blessing upon his royal head. An officer overhearing him, struck the honest centinel to the ground before the king, who could not help saying, that the punishment exceeded the offence.</P>
<P>At his return to Whitehall, he desired the permission of the house to see his children, and to be attended in his private devotions by doctor Juxon, late bishop of London. These requests were granted, and also three days to prepare for the execution of the sentence. All that remained of his family now in England were the princess Elizabeth, and the duke of Gloucester, a child of about three years of age. After many seasonable and sensible ex∣hortations to his daughter, he took his little son in his arms, and embracing him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My child, said he, they will cut off thy father's head, yes they will cut off my head, and make thee a king. But mark what I say; thou must not be a king as long as thy brothers Charles and James are alive. They will cut off their heads when they can take them, and thy head too they will cut off at last, and therefore I charge thee do not be
<PB N="312" REF="314"/>
made a king by them."</Q>
The child, burst∣ing into tears, replied,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I will be torn in pieces first."</Q></P>
<P>Every night during the interval between his sentence and execution, the king slept sound as usual, though the noise of the workmen, employed in framing the scaffold, continually resounded in his ears. The fatal morning being at last arrived, he rose early; and calling one of his attendants, he bad him employ more than usual care in dressing him, and preparing him for so great and joyful a solemnity. The street before Whitehall was the place destined for his execution; for it was intended that this would encrease the severity of his punishment. He was led through the Banquetting House to the scaffold adjoining to that edifice, at∣tended by his friend and servant bishop Juxon, a man endowed with the same mild and steady virtues with his master. The scaffold, which was covered with black, was guarded by a regiment of soldiers, under the command of colonel Tomlinson, and on it were to be seen the block, the ax, and two executioners in masques. The people in great crowds stood at a greater dis∣tance, in dreadful expectation of the event. The king surveyed all these solemn prepara∣tions with calm composure; and as he could
<PB N="313" REF="315"/>
not expect to be heard by the people at a dis∣tance, he addressed himself to the few persons who stood round him. He there justified his own innocence in the late fatal wars; and ob∣served, that he had not taken arms till after the parliament, had shewn him the example. That he had no other object in his warlike preparations than to preserve that authority en∣tire, which had been transmitted to him by his ancestors: but, though innocent towards his people, he acknowledged the equity of his execution in the eyes of his Maker. He owned that he was justly punished for having consented to the execution of an unjust sen∣tence upon the earl of Strafford. He forgave all his enemies, exhorted the people to return to their obedience, and acknowledge his son as his successor, and signified his attachment to the protestant religion, as professed in the church of England. So strong was the impres∣sion his dying words made upon the few who could hear him, that colonel Tomlinson himself, to whose care he had been committed, acknowleged himself a convert.</P>
<P>While he was preparing himself for the block, bishop Juxon called out to him:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There is, Sir, but one stage more, which, though turbulent and troublesome, is yet a
<PB N="314" REF="316"/>
very short one. It will soon carry you a great way. It will carry you from earth to heaven, and there you shall find, to your great joy, the prize to which you hasten, a crown of glory."</Q>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I go, replied the king, from a corruptible to an incorruptible crown, where no disturbance can have place."</Q>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You exchange, replied the bishop, a temporal for an eternal crown, a good exchange."</Q>
Charles having taken off his cloak delivered his George to the prelate, pronouncing the word <Q REND="inline">"Remember."</Q> Then he laid his neck on the block, and stretching out his hands as a signal, one of the executioners severed his head from his body at a blow, while the other, holding it up, exclaimed,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This is the head of a traitor."</Q>
The spectators testified their horror at that sad spectacle in sighs, tears, and lamentations; the tide of their duty and af∣fection began to return, and each blamed him∣self either with active disloyalty to his king, or a passive compliance with his destroyers. The very pulpits, that used to resound with inso∣lence and sedition, were now bedewed with tears of unfeigned repentance; and all united in their detestation of those dark hypocrites, who, to satisfy their own enmity, involved a whole nation in the guilt of treason.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="317"/>Charles was executed in the forty-ninth year of his age,<MILESTONE N="Jan. 30, 1649."/> and the twenty-fourth of his reign. He was of a middling stature, robust, and well proportioned. His visage was pleas∣ing, but melancholy; and it is probable that the continual troubles in which he was in∣volved might have made that impression on his countenance. As for his character, the reader will deduce it with more precision and satisfaction to himself from the detail of his conduct, than from any summary given of it by the historian. It will suffice to say, that all his faults seem to have arisen from the error of his education; while all his virtues, and he possessed many, were the genuine offspring of his heart. He lived at a time when the spirit of the constitution was at variance with the genius of the people; and governing by old rules and precedents, instead of accommodat∣ing himself to the changes of the times, he fell, and drew down as he sunk the constitu∣tion in ruins round him. Many kings before him expired by treasons or assassinations; but never since the times of Agis the Lacedemo∣nian was there any other sacrificed by his sub∣jects with all the formalities of justice. Many were the miseries sustained by the nation in bringing this monarch to the block, and more
<PB N="316" REF="318"/>
were yet to be endured previous to the settle∣ment of the constitution; yet these struggles in the end were productive of domestic hap∣piness and security, the laws became more precise, the monarch's privileges better ascer∣tained, and the subjects duty better delineated; all became more peaceable, as if a previous fermentation in the constitution was necessary for its subsequent refinement.</P>

<P>CROMWELL,<MILESTONE N="1649" UNIT="A.D."/> who had secretly solli∣cited, and contrived the king's death, now began to feel wishes to which he had been hi∣therto a stranger. His prospects widening as he rose, his first principles of liberty were all lost in the unbounded stretch of power that lay before him. When the peers met on the day appointed in their adjournment, they en∣tered
<PB N="318" REF="320"/>
upon business, and sent down some votes to the commons, of which the latter deigned not to take the least notice. In a few days af∣ter the commons voted, that the house of lords was useless and dangerous, and therefore was to be abolished. They voted it high treason to acknowledge Charles Stuart, son of the late king, as successor to the throne. A great seal was made, on one side of which were engra∣ven the arms of England and Ireland, with this inscription:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The great seal of Eng∣land."</Q>
On the reverse was represented the house of commons sitting, with this motto:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"On the first year of freedom, by God's blessing restored, 1648."</Q>
The forms of all public business were changed from the king's name, to that of the keepers of the liberties of England.</P>
<P>The next day they proceeded to try those gallant men, whose attachment to their late sovereign had been the most remarkable. The duke of Hamilton and lord Capel were con∣demned and executed, the earl of Holland lost his life by a like sentence, the earl of Nor∣wich and Sir John Owen were condemned, but afterwards pardoned by the commons.</P>
<P>The Scotch, who had in the beginning shewn themselves so averse to the royal family,
<PB N="319" REF="321"/>
and having, by a long train of successes, to∣tally suppressed all insurrections in its favour, now first began to relent from their various persecutions. Their loyalty began to return; and the insolence of the independents, with their victories, served to enflame them still more. The execution of their favourite duke Hamilton also, who was put to death not only contrary to the laws of war, but of nations, was no small vexation; they, therefore, deter∣mined to acknowlege prince Charles for their king. But their love of liberty was still pre∣dominant, and seemed to combat with their manifold resentments. At the same time that they resolved upon raising him to the throne, they abridged his power with every limitation which they had attempted to impose on their late sovereign.</P>
<P>Charles, after the death of his father, hav∣ing passed some time at Paris, and finding no likelihood of assistance from that quarter, was glad to accept of any conditions. He possessed neither the virtues nor the constancy of his father; and being attached to no religion as yet, he agreed to all their proposals, being satis∣fied with even the formalities of royalty. It is remarkable, that while the Scotch were thus inviting their king over, they were, neverthe∣less,
<PB N="320" REF="322"/>
cruelly punishing those who had adhered to his cause. Among others, the earl of Mon∣trose, one of the bravest, politest, and most finished characters of that age, was taken pri∣soner, as he endeavoured to raise the High∣landers in the royal cause; and being brought to Edinburgh was hanged on a gibbet thirty feet high, then quartered, and his limbs stuck up in the principal towns of the kingdom. Yet notwithstanding all this severity to his fol∣lowers, Charles ventured into Scotland, and had the mortification to enter the gate of Edin∣burgh, where the limbs of that faithful adhe∣rent were still exposed.</P>
<P>Being now entirely at the mercy of the gloomy and austere zealots, who had been the cause of his father's misfortunes, he soon found that he had only exchanged exile for imprisonment. He was surrounded, and in∣cessantly importuned by the fanatical clergy, who obtruded their religious instructions, and obliged him to listen to long sermons, in which they seldom failed to stigmatize the late king as a tyrant, to accuse his mother of idolatry, and himself of an untoward disposition. Six ser∣mons a day were his usual allowance; and though they laboured to out-go each other in absurdity, yet he was denied the small conso∣lation
<PB N="321" REF="323"/>
of laughter. In short, the clergy having brought royalty under their feet, were resolved to keep it still subservient, and to trample upon it with all the contumely of successful upstarts. Charles for a while bore all their insolence with hypocritical tranquili∣ty, and even pretended to be highly edified by their instructions. He once, indeed, at∣tempted to escape from among them; but being brought back, he owned the greatness of his error, he testified repentance for what he had done, and looked about for another op∣portunity of escaping.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Cromwell, who had been appointed to the command of the army in Ireland, prosecuted the war in that kingdom with his usual success. He had to combat against the Royalists, commanded by the duke of Ormond, and the native Irish, led on by O'Neal. But such ill connected and barbarous troops could give very little opposition to Cromwell's more numerous forces, conducted by such a general, and emboldened by long suc∣cess. He soon over-ran the whole country; and after some time, all the towns revolted in his favour, and opened their gates at his ap∣proach. But in these conquests, as in all the rest of his actions, there appeared a brutal fe∣rocity,
<PB N="322" REF="324"/>
that could tarnish the most heroic va∣lour. In order to intimidate the natives from defending their towns, he, with a barbarous policy, put every garrison that made any re∣sistance to the sword. He entered the city of Drogheda by storm, and indiscriminately butch∣ered men, women, and children, so that only one escaped the dreadful carnage to give an account of the massacre. He was now in the train of speedily reducing the whole kingdom to subjection, when he was called over by the parliament to defend his own country against the Scotch, who, having espoused the royal cause, had raised a considerable army to sup∣port it.</P>
<P>After Cromwell's return to England, upon taking his seat, he received the thanks of the house, by the mouth of the speaker, for the services he had done the commonwealth in Ireland. They then proceeded to deliberate upon chusing a general for conducting the war in Scotland, which Fairfax refusing upon principle, as he had all along declined oppos∣ing the presbyterians, the command necessa∣rily devolved upon Cromwell. Fairfax, from that time forward declined meddling in public affairs; but sending his commission of gene∣ralissimo to the house, he retired to spend the
<PB N="323" REF="325"/>
remainder of his life in peace and privacy. Cromwell, eager to pursue the path of ambi∣tion that now lay before him, and being de∣clared captain-general of the forces, boldly set forward for Scotland, at the head of an army of sixteen thousand men.</P>
<P>The Scotch, in the mean time, who had invited over their wretched king to be a pri∣soner, not a ruler, among them, prepared to meet the invasion. They had given the com∣mand of their army to general Lesley, a good officer, who formed a proper plan for their defence. This prudent commander knew, that though superior in numbers, his army was much inferior in discipline and experience to the English; and he kept himself carefully within his entrenchments. After some pre∣vious motions on one side and the other, Cromwell, at last, saw himself in a very dis∣advantageous post near Dunbar, and his anta∣gonist waiting deliberately to take advantage of his situation.<MILESTONE N="1650" UNIT="A.D."/> But the madness of the Scotch clergy saved him from the imminent disgrace that was likely to attend him, and to their vain inspirations he owed his security. These had it seems been night and day wrest∣ling with the Lord in prayer, as they termed it; and they at last fancied that they had ob∣tained the superiority. Revelations they said
<PB N="324" REF="326"/>
were made them, that the heretical army, toge∣ther with Agag their general, would be delivered into their hands. Upon the assurances of these visions, they obliged their general, in spite of all his remonstrances, to descend into the plain, and give the English battle.</P>
<P>The English had their visions and their as∣surances on their side also. Cromwell, in his turn, had been wrestling with the Lord, and had come off with success. When he was told that the Scotch army were coming down to engage, he assured his soldiers that the Lord had delivered the enemy into his hands; and he ordered his army to sing psalms, as already possessed of a certain victory. The Scotch, though double the number of the English, were soon put to flight, and pursued with great slaughter, while Cromwell did not lose above forty men in all.</P>
<P>The unfortunate king, who hated all the Scotch army, and only dreaded Cromwell, was well enough pleased at the defeat, which belied all the assurances of his oppressors. It was attended also with this good consequence to him, that it served to introduce him to a greater share of power than he had hitherto been permitted to enjoy. He now, therefore, put himself at the head of the small part of the Scotch army that had survived the defeat;
<PB N="325" REF="327"/>
and these he still further strengthened by the royalists, whom the covenanters had some time before excluded from his service. Cromwell, however, still followed his blow, pursued the king's forces towards Perth, and cutting off the provisions of the Scotch army, made it impossible for Charles to maintain his forces in that country any longer.</P>
<P>In this terrible exigence he embraced a re∣solution worthy a prince, who was willing to hazard all for empire. Observing that the way was open to England, he resolved immediately to march into that country, where he expected to be reinforced by all the royalists in that part of the kingdom. His generals were persuaded to enter into the same views; and with one consent the Scotch army, to the number of fourteen thousand men, made an irruption southwards.</P>
<P>But Charles soon found himself disappoint∣ed in the expectation of encreasing his army. The Scotch, terrified at the prospect of so hazardous an enterprize, fell from him in great numbers. The English, affrighted at the name of his opponent, dreaded to join him; but his mortifications were still more encreased as he arrived at Worcester, when informed, that Cromwell was marching with hasty strides
<PB N="326" REF="328"/>
from Scotland, with an army encreased to forty thousand men. The news scarce arrived, when that active general himself appeared; and falling upon the town on all sides, broke in upon the disordered royalists. The streets were strewed with slaughter, the whole Scotch army was either killed or taken prisoners, and the king himself, having given many proofs of personal valour, was obliged to fly.</P>
<P>Imagination can scarce conceive adventures more romantic, or distresses more severe, than those which attended the young king's escape from the scene of slaughter. After his hair was cut off, the better to disguise his person, he wrought for some days in the habit of a peasant, cutting faggots in a wood. He next made an attempt to retire into Wales, under the conduct of one Pendrel, a poor farmer, who was sincerely attached to his cause. In this attempt, however, he was disappointed, every pass being guarded to prevent his escape. Being obliged to return, he met one colonel Careless, who, like himself, had escap∣ed the carnage at Worcester; and it was in his company that he was obliged to climb a spreading oak, among the thick branches of which they passed the day together, while they heard the soldiers of the enemy in pursuit of
<PB N="327" REF="329"/>
them below. From thence he passed, with imminent danger, feeling all the varieties of famine, fatigue, and pain, till he arrived at the house of one colonel Lane, a zealous roy∣alist in Staffordshire. There he deliberated about the means of escaping into France; and Bristol being supposed the properest port, it was agreed that he should ride thither, before this gentleman's sister, on a visit to one Mrs. Norton, who lived in the neighbourhood of that city. During this journey he every day met with persons, whose faces he knew; and at one time passed through a whole regiment of the enemy's army.</P>
<P>When they arrived at Mrs. Norton's, the first person they saw was one of his own chap∣lains sitting at the door, amusing himself with seeing people play at bowls. The king, after having taken proper care of his horse in the stable, was shewn to an apartment, which Mrs. Lane had provided for him, as it was said he had the ague. The butler, however, being sent to him with some refreshment, no sooner beheld his face, which was very pale with anxiety and fatigue, then he recollected his king and master; and falling upon his knees, while the tears streamed down his cheeks, cried out, <Q REND="inline">"I am rejoiced to see your ma∣jesty."</Q>
<PB N="328" REF="330"/>
The king was alarmed, but made the butler promise that he would keep the secret from every mortal, even from his master; and the honest servant punctually obeyed him.</P>
<P>No ship being found that would for a month set sail from Bristol, either for France or Spain, the king was obliged to go elsewhere for a passage. He therefore repaired to the house of colonel Wyndham, in Dorsetshire, where he was cordially received; that gentleman's family having ever been loyal. His mother, a venerable matron, seemed to think the end of her life nobly rewarded, in having it in her power to give protection to her king. She expressed no disatisfaction at having lost three sons, and one grand-child in the defence of his cause, since she was honoured in being in∣strumental to his own preservation.</P>
<P>Pursuing from thence his journey to the sea∣side, he once more had a very providential escape from a little inn, where he set up for the night. The day had been appointed by parliament for a solemn fast; and a fanati∣cal weaver, who had been a soldier in the parlia∣ment army, was preaching against the king in a little chapel fronting the house. Charles, to a∣void suspicion, was himself among the audience. It happened, that a smith of the same princi∣ples
<PB N="329" REF="331"/>
with the weaver had been examining the horses belonging to the passengers, and came to assure the preacher that he knew by the fashion of the shoes, that one of the strangers horses came from the north. The preacher immediately affirmed that this horse could be∣long to no other than Charles Stuart, and in∣stantly went with a constable to search the inn. But Charles had taken timely precautions, and had left the inn before the constable's ar∣rival.</P>
<P>At Shoreham, in Sussex, a vessel was at last found, in which he embarked. He was known to so many, that if he had not set sail in that critical moment, it had been impossible for him to escape. After one and forty days concealment, he arrived safely at Feschamp in Normandy. No less than forty men and women had, at different times, been privy to his escape.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Cromwell, crowned with success, returned in triumph to London, where he was met by the speaker of the house, ac∣companied by the mayor of London, and the magistrates, in all their formalities. His first care was to take advantage of his late succes∣ses, by depressing the Scotch, who had so lately withstood the work of the Gospel, as he called
<PB N="330" REF="332"/>
it. An act was passed for abolishing royalty in Scotland, and annexing that kingdom, as a conquered province, to the English common∣wealth. It was impowered, however, to send some members to the English parliament. Judges were appointed to distribute justice; and the people of that country, now freed from the tyranny of the ecclesiastics, were not much disatisfied with their present government. The prudent conduct of Monk, who had was left by Cromwell to complete their sub∣jection, served much to reconcile the minds of the people, harrassed with dissensions, of which they never well understood the cause.</P>
<P>In this manner the English parliament, by the means of Cromwell, spread their uncon∣tested authority over all the British dominions. Ireland was totally subdued by Ireton and Ludlow. All the settlements in America, that had declared for the royal cause, were obliged to submit; Jersey, Guernsey, Scilly, and the Isle of Man, were brought easily under sub∣jection. Thus mankind saw, with astonish∣ment, a parliament composed of sixty or seven∣ty obscure and illiterate members, governing a great empire with unanimity and success. Without any acknowledged subordination, ex∣cept a council of state consisting of thirty-eight,
<PB N="331" REF="333"/>
to whom all addresses were made, they levied armies, maintained fleets, and gave laws to the neighbouring powers of Europe. The finances were managed with oeconomy and exactness. Few private persons became rich by the plunder of the public: the revenues of the crown, the lands of the bishops, and a tax of an hundred and twenty thousand pounds each month, supplied the wants of the govern∣ment, and gave vigour to all their proceed∣ings.</P>
<P>The parliament, having thus reduced their native dominions to perfect obedience, next resolved to chastise the Dutch, who had given but very slight causes of complaint. It hap∣pened that one doctor Dorislaus, who was of the number of the late king's judges being sent by the parliament as their envoy to Holland, was assassinated by one of the royal party, who had taken refuge there. Some time after also Mr. St. John, appointed their ambassador to that court, was insulted by the friends of the prince of Orange. These were thought motives suffi∣cient to induce the commonwealth of England to declare war against them. The parliament's chief dependence lay in the activity and cou∣rage of Blake, their admiral; who, though he had not embarked in naval command till late
<PB N="332" REF="334"/>
in life, yet surpassed all that went before him in courage and dexterity. On the other side, the Dutch opposed to him their famous ad∣miral Van Tromp, to whom they never since produced an equal. Many were the engage∣ments between these celebrated admirals, and various was their success. Sea-fights, in gene∣ral, seldom prove decisive; and the vanquished are soon seen to make head against the victors. Several dreadful encounters, therefore, rather served to shew the excellence of the admirals, than to determine their superiority. The Dutch, however, who felt many great disad∣vantages by the loss of their trade; and by the total suspension of their fisheries, were willing to treat for a peace; but the parliament gave them a very unfavourable answer. It was the policy of that body, to keep their navy on foot as long as they could; rightly judging, that while the force of the nation was exerted by sea, it would diminish the power of general Cromwell by land, which was now become very formidable to them.</P>
<P>This great aspirer, however, quickly per∣ceived their designs; and from the first saw that they dreaded his growing power, and wish∣ed its diminution. All his measures were con∣ducted with a bold intrepidity that marked
<PB N="333" REF="335"/>
his character; and he now saw, that it was not necessary to wear the mask of subordination any longer. Secure, therefore, in the attach∣ment of the army, he resolved to make another daring effort; and persuaded the officers to present a petition for payment of arrears and redress of grievances, which he knew would be rejected with disdain. The petition was soon drawn up and presented, in which the officers, after demanding their arrears, desired the par∣liament to consider how many years they had sat; <MILESTONE N="1653" UNIT="A.D."/> and what professions they had formerly made of their intentions to new model the house, and establish freedom on the broadest basis. They alledged, that it was now full time to give place to others; and however me∣ritorious their actions might have been, yet the rest of the nation had some right, in turn, to shew their patriotism in the service of their country.</P>
<P>The house was highly offended at the pre∣sumption of the army, although they had seen, but too lately, that their own power was wholly founded on that very presumption. They appointed a committee to prepare an act, or∣daining that all persons who presented such pe∣titions, for the future, should be deemed guilty of high treason. To this the officers made a
<PB N="334" REF="336"/>
very warm remonstrance, and the parliament as angry a reply; while the breach between them every moment grew wider. This was what Cromwell had long wished, and had well foreseen. He was sitting in council with his officers, when informed of the subject on which the house was deliberating; upon which he rose up in the most seeming fury, and turn∣ing to major Vernon, cried out,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he was compelled to do a thing that made the very hair of his head stand on end."</Q>
Then hastening to the house with three hundred sol∣diers, and with the marks of violent indigna∣tion on his countenance he entered, took his place, and attended to the debates for some time. When the question was ready to be put, he suddenly started up, and began to load the parliament with the vilest reproaches for their tyranny, ambition, oppression, and rob∣bery of the public. Upon which, stamping with his foot, which was the signal for the soldiers to enter, the place was immediately filled with armed men. Then addressing himself to the members:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For shame, said he, get you gone. Give place to honester men; to those who will more faithfully discharge their trust. You are no longer a parliament; I tell you you are no longer a parliament; the Lord
<PB N="335" REF="337"/>
has done with you."</Q>
Sir Harry Vane ex∣claiming against this conduct:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir Harry, cried Cromwell with a loud voice, O Sir Harry Vane, the Lord deliver me from Sir Harry Vane."</Q>
Taking hold of Martin by the cloak, thou art a whore master; to an∣other, thou art an adulterer; to a third, thou art a drunkard; and to a fourth, thou art a glut∣ton.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is you, continued he to the mem∣bers, that have forced me upon this. I have sought the Lord night and day that he would rather slay me than put me upon this work."</Q>
Then pointing to the mace,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Take away, cried he, that bauble."</Q>
After which, turning out all the members, and clearing the hall, he ordered the doors to be locked, and putting the key in his pocket, returned to Whitehall.</P>
<P>Thus, by one daring exploit, the new re∣public was abolished, and the whole command, civil and military, centered in Cromwell only. The people, however, that were spectators in si∣lent wonder of all these precipitate transactions, expressed no disapprobation at the dissolution of a parliament that had overturned the con∣stitution, and destroyed the king. On the contrary, the usurper received congratulatory addresses from the fleet, the corporations, and
<PB N="336" REF="338"/>
the army, for having dismissed a parliament that had subjected them to the most cruel im∣positions.</P>
<P>But this politic man was too cautious to be seduced by their praise, or driven on by their exhortations. Unwilling to put forth all his power at once, he resolved still to amuse the people with the form of a commonwealth, which it was the delusion of the times to ad∣mire, and to give them a parliament that would be entirely subservient to his commands. For this purpose, consulting with some of the principal officers, it was decreed, that the so∣vereign power should be vested in one hun∣dred and forty-four persons, under the deno∣mination of a parliament; and he undertook himself to make the choice.</P>
<P>The persons pitched upon for exercising this seemingly important trust, were the low∣est, meanest, and the most ignorant among the citizens, and the very dregs of the fanatics. He was well apprized that during the admini∣stration of such a groupe of characters he alone must govern, or that they must soon throw up the reins of government, which they were unqualified to guide. Accordingly, their practice justified his sagacity. To go further than others into the absurdities of fanaticism
<PB N="337" REF="339"/>
was the chief qualification which each of these valued himself upon. Their very names, com∣posed of cant phrases borrowed from Scrip∣ture, and rendered ridiculous by their misap∣plication, served to shew their excess of folly. Not only the names of Zerobabel, Habba∣kuk, and Mesopotamia were given to those ignorant creatures, but sometimes whole sen∣tences from Scripture. One of them parti∣cularly, who was called Praise God Barebone, a canting leatherseller, gave his name to this odd assembly, and it was called Barebone's parliament.</P>
<P>Their attempts at legislation were entirely correspondent to their stations and characters. As they were chiefly composed of antino∣mians, a sect that, after receiving the spirit, supposed themselves incapable of error, and of fifth monarchy men, who every hour ex∣pected Christ's coming on earth, they began by chusing eight of their tribe to seek the Lord in prayer, while the rest calmly sat down to deliberate upon the suppression of the clergy, the universities, the courts of justice; and in∣stead of all this it was their intent to substi∣tute the law of Moses.</P>
<P>To this hopeful assembly was committed the treaty of peace with the Dutch; but
<PB N="338" REF="340"/>
the ambassadors from that nation, though themselves presbyterians, were quite carnal minded to these. They were regarded by the new parliament as worldly men, intent on com∣merce and industry, and therefore not to be treated with. They insisted that the man of sin should be put away, and a new birth ob∣tained by prayer and meditation. The ambas∣sadors finding themselves unable to converse with them in their own way, gave up the treaty as hopeless.</P>
<P>The very vulgar began now to exclaim a∣gainst so foolish a legislature; and they them∣selves seemed not insensible of the ridicule which every day was thrown out against them. Cromwell was probably well enough pleased to find that his power was likely to receive no di∣minution from their endeavours; but began to be ashamed of their complicated absurdi∣ties. He had carefully chosen many persons among them entirely devoted to his inter∣ests, and these he commanded to dismiss the assembly. Accordingly, by concert, they met earlier than the rest of their fraternity; and observing to each other that this parlia∣ment had sat long enough, they hastened to Cromwell, with Rouse their speaker at their head, and into his hands they resigned the authority with which he had invested them.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="341"/>Cromwell accepted their resignation with pleasure; but being told that some of the number were refractory, he sent colonel White to clear the house of such as ventured to re∣main there. They had placed one Moyer in the chair by the time that the colonel had ar∣rived; and he being asked by the colonel <Q REND="inline">"What they did there?"</Q> Moyer replied very gravely, that they were seeking the Lord.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then you may go elsewhere, cried White; for to my certain knowlege the Lord has not been here these many years."</Q></P>
<P>This shadow of a parliament being dissolved, the officers, by their own authority, declared Cromwell protector of the commonwealth of England. Nothing now could withstand his authority; the mayor and aldermen were sent for to give solemnity to his appointment; and he was instituted into his new office at White∣hall, in the palace of the kings of England. He was to be addressed by the title of high∣ness; and his power was proclaimed in Lon∣don, and other parts of the kingdom. Thus an obscure and vulgar man, at the age of fifty-three, rose to unbounded power, first by following small events in his favour, and at length by directing great ones.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="342"/>It was, indeed, in a great measure necessary that some person should take the supreme com∣mand; for affairs were brought into such a situation by the furious animosities of the con∣tending parties, that, nothing but absolute power could prevent a renewal of former bloodshed and confusion. Cromwell, there∣fore, might have said with some justice upon his installation, that he accepted the dignity of protector merely that he might preserve the peace of the nation; and this it must be own∣ed he effected with equal conduct, modera∣tion, and success. The government of the kingdom was adjusted in the following man∣ner. A council was appointed, which was not to exceed twenty-one, nor to be under thir∣teen persons. These were to enjoy their of∣fices for life, or during good behaviour; and, in case of a vacancy, the remaining members named three, of whom the protector chose one. The protector was appointed the su∣preme magistrate of the commonwealth, with such powers as the king was possessed of. The power of the sword was vested in him jointly with the parliament when sitting, or with the council at intervals. He was obliged to summon a parliament every three years, and to allow them to sit five months without
<PB N="341" REF="343"/>
adjournment. A standing army was establish∣ed of twenty thousand foot, and ten thousand horse, and funds were assigned for their sup∣port. The protector enjoyed his office during life; and on his death the place was immedi∣ately to be supplied by the council. Of all those clauses the standing army was alone sufficient for Cromwell's purpose; for while possessed of that instrument, he could mould the rest of the con∣stitution to his pleasure at any time.</P>
<P>Cromwell chose his council among his offi∣cers, who had been the companions of his dangers and his victories, to each of whom he assigned a pension of one thousand pounds a year. He took care to have his troops, upon whose fidelity he depended for support, paid a month in advance; the maga∣zines were also well provided, and the public treasure managed with frugality and care: while his activity, vigilance, and resolution were such, that he discovered every conspiracy against his person, and every plot for an in∣surrection before they took effect.</P>
<P>His management of foreign affairs, though his schemes were by no means political, yet well corresponded with his character, and, for a while, were attended with success. The Dutch having been humbled by repeated de∣feats,
<PB N="342" REF="344"/>
and totally abridged in their commer∣cial concerns; were obliged at last to sue for peace, which he gave them upon terms ra∣ther too favourable. He insisted upon their paying deference to the British flag. He com∣pelled them to abandon the interests of the king, and to pay eighty-five thousand pounds as an indemnification for former expences, and to restore the English East India company a part of those dominions of which they had been dispossessed by the Dutch during the former reign, in that distant part of the world.</P>
<P>He was not less successful in his negotiations with the court of France. Cardinal Maza∣rine, by whom the affairs of that kingdom were conducted, deemed it necessary to pay deference to the protector; and desirous ra∣ther to prevail by dexterity than violence, sub∣mitted to Cromwell's imperious character, and thus procured ends equally beneficial to both.</P>
<P>The court of Spain was not less assiduous in its endeavours to gain his friendship, but was not so successful. This vast monarchy, which but a few years before had threatened the liberties of Europe, was now reduced so low as to be scarce able to defend itself. Crom∣well, however, who knew nothing of foreign
<PB N="343" REF="345"/>
politics, still continued to regard its power with an eye of jealousy, and came into an association with France to depress it still more. He lent that court a body of six thousand men to attack the Spanish dominions in the Nether∣lands; and upon obtaining a signal victory by his assistance at Dunes, the French put Dun∣kirk, which they had just taken from the Spa∣niards, into his hands, as a reward for his at∣tachment.</P>
<P>But it was by sea that he humbled the power of Spain with still more effectual success. Blake, who had long made himself formidable to the Dutch, and whose fame was spread over Europe, now became still more dreadful to the Spanish monarchy. He sailed with a fleet into the Mediterranean, whither, since the time of the crusades, no English fleet had ever ven∣tured to advance. He there conquered all that ventured to oppose him. Casting anchor before Leghorn, he demanded and obtained satisfaction for some injuries which the English commerce had suffered from the duke of Tuscany. He next sailed to Algiers, and compelled the Dey to make peace,<MILESTONE N="1655" UNIT="A.D."/> and to restrain his pyratical subjects from farther in∣juring the English. He then went to Tunis, and having made the same demands, he was
<PB N="344" REF="346"/>
desired by the Dey of that place to look at the two castles, Porto Farino, and Goletta, and do his utmost. Blake shewed him that he was not slow in accepting the challenge; he entered the harbour, burned the shipping there, and then sailed out triumphantly to pursue his voyage. At Cadiz, he took two galleons valued at near two million pieces of eight. At the Canaries, he burned a Spanish fleet of sixteen ships, and returning home to England to enjoy the same of his noble actions, as he came within sight of his native country he expired. This gallant man, though he fought for an usurper, yet was averse to his cause; he was a zealous republican in principle, and his aim was to serve his country, not to establish a tyrant. <Q REND="inline">"It is still our duty, he would say to the sea-men, to fight for our country into whatever hands the government may fall."</Q></P>
<P>At the same time, that Blake's expeditions were going forward, there was another carried on under the command of admiral Pen and Venables, with about four thousand land-forces, to attack the Island of Hispaniola. Failing however, in this, and being driven off the place by the Spaniards, they steered to Jamai∣ca, which was surrendered to them without a
<PB N="345" REF="347"/>
blow. So little was thought of the impor∣tance of this conquest, that, upon the return of the expedition, Pen and Venables were sent to the Tower, for their failure in the prin∣cipal object of their expedition.</P>
<P>All these successes might rather be ascribed to the spirit of the times, than the conductor of them. Cromwell was possessed of but two arts in perfection, that of managing the army, by which he ruled; and obtaining the secrets of his enemies that were plotting against him. For the first, his valour and canting zeal were sufficient; for the latter, it is said he paid sixty thousand pounds a year to his spies to come by his intelligence. But he took care to make the nation refund those extraordinary sums which he ex∣pended for such information. One or two conspi∣racies entered into by the royalists, which were detected and punished, served him as a pretext to lay an heavy tax upon all of that party, of a tenth penny on all their possessions. In order to raise this oppressive imposition, ten major-generals were instituted, who divided the whole kingdom into so many military jurisdic∣tions. These men had power to subject whom they pleased to a payment of this tax, and to imprison such as denied their jurisdic∣tion. Under colour of these powers, they
<PB N="346" REF="348"/>
exercised the most arbitrary authority; the people had no protection against their exac∣tions; the very mask of liberty was thrown off, and all property was at the disposal of a military tribunal. It was in vain that the na∣tion cried out for a free parliament; Crom∣well assembled one in consequence of their clamours; but as speedily dissolved it, when he found it refractory to his commands.</P>
<P>In this state of universal dejection, in which Scotland and Ireland were treated as conquered provinces, in which the protector issued his absolute orders without even the mask of his former hypocrisy, and in which all trust and confidence were lost in every social meeting, the people were struck with a new instance of the usurper's ambition. As parliaments were ever dear to the people, it was resolved to give them one; but such as should be entirely of the protector's chusing, and chiefly composed of his own creatures. Lest any of a different complexion should presume to enter the house, guards were placed at the door, and none ad∣mitted but such as produced a warrant from his council. The principal design of conven∣ing this assembly was, that they should of∣fer him the crown, with the title of king, and all the other ensigns of royalty.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="349"/>His creatures, therefore, took care to in∣fuse into this assembly the merits of the pro∣tector; the confusion there was in legal pro∣ceedings without the name of a king; that no man was acquainted with the extent or li∣mits of the present magistrate's authority, but those of a king had been well ascertained by the experience of ages. At last the motion was made in form in the house, by alderman Pack, one of the city members, for investing the protector with the regal dignity. The majority of the house being Cromwell's crea∣tures, it may easily be supposed that the bill was voted according to his secret wishes; and nothing now remained but his own consent to have his name enrolled among the kings of England.</P>
<P>Whether it was his original intention by having this bill carried through the house, to shew that he was magnanimous enough to re∣fuse the offer, or whether finding some of those on whom he most depended averse to his tak∣ing the title, cannot now be known. Certain it is his doubts continued for some days; and the conference which he carried on with the mem∣bers who were sent to make him the offer, seems to argue that he was desirous of being compelled to accept what he feared openly to
<PB N="348" REF="350"/>
assume. The obscurity of his answers, the absurdity of his speeches on this occasion (for they still remain) shew plainly a mind at va∣riance with itself, and combatting only with a wish to be vanquished.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I confess, said he, for it behoves me to deal plainly with you, I must confess, I would say I hope I may be understood in this; for indeed I must be tender what I would say to such an audience as this; I say I would be understood, that in this argument I do not make a parallel between men of a different mind, and a parliament which shall have their desires. I know there is no comparison; nor can it be urged upon me that my words have the least colour that way, because the parlia∣ment seems to me to give liberty to me to say any thing to you. As that is a tender of my humble reasons and judgment and opinion to them, and if I think they are such, and will be such to them, and are faithful servants, and will be so to the su∣preme authority and the legislative, where∣soever it is. If I say I should not tell you knowing their minds to be so, I should not be faithful if I should not tell you so, to the end that you may report it to par∣liament."</Q>
In this manner did this most
<PB N="349" REF="351"/>
unaccountable of all characters answer their petitions for his assuming the kingly name and dignity; however the conference ended in his refusing their offer.</P>
<P>But it must not be supposed that his situa∣tion, with all these offered honours, was at this time enviable? Perhaps no station, however mean, or loaded with contempt, could be more truly distressful than his, at a time the nation was loading him with congratulations and ad∣dresses. He had by this,<MILESTONE N="1658" UNIT="A.D."/> rendered himself hateful to every party; and he owed his safety to their mutual hatred and diffidence of each other. His arts of dissimulation had been long exhausted; none now could be deceived by them, those of his own party and princi∣ples, disdaining the use to which he had con∣verted his zeal and professions. The truth seems to be, if we may use a phrase taken from common life, he had began with being a dupe to his own enthusiasms, and ended with being a sharper.</P>
<P>The whole nation silently detested his admi∣nistration, but he had not still been reduced to the extreme of wretchedness, if he could have found domestic consolation. Fleetwood, his son in-law, actuated with the wildest zeal, de∣tested that character which could use religious
<PB N="350" REF="352"/>
professions for the purposes of temporal ad∣vancement. His eldest daughter, married to Fleetwood, had adopted republican principles so vehemently, that she could not behold even her own father entrusted with uncontrolable power. His other daughters were no less sanguine in favour of the royal cause; but above all, Mrs. Claypole, his favourite daugh∣ter, who, upon her death-bed, upbraided him with all those crimes that led him to trample on the throne.</P>
<P>Every hour added some new disquietude. Lord Fairfax, Sir William Waller, and many of the heads of the presbyterians, had secretly entered into an engagement to destroy him. His administration, so expensive both at home and abroad, had exhausted his revenue, and he was left considerably in debt. One conspiracy was no sooner detected, but another rose from its ruins; and to encrease his calamity, he was now taught, upon reasoning principles, that his death was not only desirable, but his assassi∣nation would be meritorious. A book was published by colonel Titus, a man who had formerly been attached to his cause, en∣titled <HI>Killing no Murder.</HI> Of all the pam∣phlets that came forth at that time, or perhaps of those that have since appeared, this was the
<PB N="351" REF="353"/>
most eloquent and masterly. Shall we, said this popular declaimer, who would not suffer the lion to invade us, tamely stand to be de∣voured by the wolf. Cromwell read this spi∣rited treatise, and was never seen to smile more.</P>
<P>All peace was now for ever banished from his mind. He now found, that the grandeur to which he had sacrificed his former peace, was only an inlet to fresh inquietudes. The fears of assassination haunted him in all his walks, and was perpetually present to his imagination. He wore armour under his cloaths, and always kept pistols in his pockets. His aspect was clouded by a settled gloom; and he regarded every stranger with a glance of timid suspicion. He always travelled with hurry, and was ever attended by a numerous guard. He never returned from any place by the road he went; and seldom slept above three nights together in the same chamber. Society terrified him, as there he might meet an enemy; solitude was terrible, as he was there unguarded by every friend.</P>
<P>A tertian ague kindly came at last to deli∣ver him from this life of horror and anxiety. For the space of a week no dangerous symp∣toms appeared; and in the intervals of the
<PB N="352" REF="354"/>
fits he was able to walk abroad. At length the fever encreased, and he himself began to dread his approaching fate; but he was taught to consider his present disorder as no way fa∣tal, by his fanatic chaplains, on whom he en∣tirely relied. When his chaplain Goodwin told him that the elect would never be damned, then
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am sure, said he, that I am safe; for I was once in a state of grace."</Q>
His physicians were sensible of his dangerous case; but he was so much encouraged by the reve∣lations of his preachers, that he considered his recovery as no way doubtful.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I tell you, cried he to the physicians, that I shall not die of this distemper; I am well assured of my recovery. Favourable answers have been returned from heaven, not only to my own supplications, but likewise to those of the godly, who have a closer correspond∣ence with God than I. Ye may have skill in your profession; but nature can do more than all the physicians in the world; and God is far above nature."</Q>
Upon a fast day appointed on account of his sickness, his ministers thanked God for the undoubted pledges they had received of his recovery. Not∣withstanding these assurances the fatal symp∣toms every hour encreased; and the physi∣cians
<PB N="353" REF="355"/>
were obliged to declare that he could not survive the next fit. The council now there∣fore came to know his last commands concern∣ing the succession; but his senses were gone, and he was just able to answer yes to their de∣mand, whether his son Richard should be ap∣pointed to succeed him. He died on the third day of September, that very day which he had always considered as the most fortunate of his life; he was then fifty-nine years old,<MILESTONE N="1658" UNIT="A.D."/> and had usurped the government nine years.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV. From the Death of OLIVER CROMWELL to the RESTORATION.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER might have been the differences of interest after the death of the usurper, the influence of his name was still sufficient to get Richard his son proclaimed protector in his room. It was probably owing to the numerous parties that were formed in the kingdom, and their hatred of each other, that Richard owed his peaceable advancement to this high station. He was naturally no way ambitious, being rather mild, easy, and good-natured; and honour seemed rather to pursue, than to attract him. He had nothing active in his disposition; no talents for business, no knowledge of government, no influence among the soldiery, no importance in council.</P>
<P>It was found necessary, upon his first ad∣vancement, to call a parliament, to furnish the supplies to carry on the ordinary ope∣rations of government. The house of com∣mons was formed legally enough; but the house of lords consisted only of those persons
<PB N="355" REF="357"/>
of no real title, who were advanced to that dignified station by the late protector. But it was not on the parliament that the army chose to rely. A great number of the principal male∣contents of the army, established a meeting at general Fleetwood's, which, as he dwelt in Wallingford-house, was called the Cabal of Wallingford. The result of their delibera∣tions was a remonstrance that the command of the army should be entrusted to some per∣son in whom they might all confide; and it was plainly given to understand that the young protector was not that person.</P>
<P>A proposal so daring and dangerous did not fail to alarm Richard; he applied to his coun∣cil, and they referred it to the parliament. Both agreed to consider it as an audacious at∣tempt, and a vote was passed that there should be no meeting, or general council of officers, without the protector's permission. This brought affairs immediately to a rupture. The palace of the protector was the next day sur∣rounded by a body of officers; and one Desbo∣row, a man of a clownish brutal nature, pene∣trating into his apartment with an armed re∣tinue, threatened him if he should refuse. Richard wanted resolution to defend what had been conferred upon him; he dissolved the
<PB N="356" REF="358"/>
parliament then, and soon after he signed his own abdication in form.</P>
<P>Henry Cromwell, his younger brother, who was appointed to the command in Ireland, fol∣lowed the protector's example, and resigned his commission without striking a blow. Rich∣ard lived several years after his resignation, at first on the continent, and afterwards upon his paternal fortune at home. He was thought by the ignorant to be unworthy of the happi∣ness of his exaltation; but he knew by his tranquility in private, that he had made the most fortunate escape.</P>
<P>The officers being once more left to them∣selves, determined to replace the remnant of the old parliament which had beheaded the king, and which Cromwell had so disgracefully turned out of the house. This was called the good old cause from their attachment to re∣publican principles; and to the members of this, the cabal of officers for a while delivered up their own authority. The members, who had been secluded by colonel Pride's purge, as it was called, attempted, but in vain, to resume their seats among them.</P>
<P>The Rump parliament, for that was the name it went by, although reinstated by the army, was yet very vigorous in its attempts to lessen the
<PB N="357" REF="359"/>
power by which it was replaced. The members began their design of humbling the army by new modelling part of the forces, by cashiering such of the officers as they feared, and appoint∣ing others, on whom they could rely, in their room. These attempts, however, were not unobserved by the officers; and their discon∣tent would have broke out into some resolu∣tion, fatal to the parliament, had it not been checked by apprehensions of danger from the royalists, or presbyterians, who were consider∣ed as the common enemy.</P>
<P>In this exigence, the officers held several conferences together, with a design to con∣tinue their power. They at length came to a resolution, usual enough in these times, to dissolve that assembly, by which they were so vehemently opposed. Accordingly Lambert, one of the general officers, drew up a chosen body of troops; and placing them in the streets which led to Westminster-hall, when the speaker Lenthall proceeded in his carriage to the house, he ordered the horses to be turned, and very civily conducted him home. The other members were likewise intercepted, and the army returned to their quarters to observe a so∣lemn fast, which generally either proceeded, or attended their outrages.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="360"/>The officers having thus resumed the power they had given, resolved not to part with it for the future upon easy terms. They elected a committee of twenty-three persons, of whom seven were officers; these they called a com∣mittee of safety, and pretended to invest them with sovereign authority. Fleetwood, a weak zealot, was made commander in chief; Lambert, an artful ambitious man, major-general; Desborow, lieutenant-general; and Monk, who had been invested by Cromwell with the government of Scotland, was appoint∣ed major-general of the foot. A military government was now established, which gave the nation the melancholy prospect of endless servitude, and tyranny without redress: a suc∣cour came to relieve the nation from a quarter on which it was the least expected.</P>
<P>During these transactions, general Monk was at the head of eight thousand veterans in Scotland, and beheld the distraction of his na∣tive country with but slender hopes of reliev∣ing it. This personage, to whom the nation owes such signal obligations, was at first a soldier of fortune. After some time spent a∣broad, he was intrusted with a regiment in the service of king Charles, and was usually called by the soldiery, for his good nature, honest
<PB N="359" REF="361"/>
George Monk. He was, however, taken pri∣soner at the siege of Nantwich, by Fairfax, and soon after sent to the Tower. He did not re∣cover his liberty till after the total overthrow of the royal party, when Cromwell took him into favour and protection, and sent him to op∣pose the Irish rebels, against whom he peform∣ed signal services. Upon the reduction of that kingdom he was sent over into Scotland, and there entrusted with the supreme com∣mand, in which station he was not less esteem∣ed by the Scotch, than loved and adored by his own army.</P>
<P>This general, upon hearing that the officers had, by their own authority, dissolved the par∣liament, protested against the measure, and resolved to defend their invaded privileges. But deeper designs, either in the king's favour or his own, were suspected to be the motive of his actions from the beginning. What∣ever might have been his designs, it was im∣possible to cover them with greater secrecy than he did. As soon as he put his army into motion, to enquire into the causes of the dis∣turbances in the capital, his countenance was eagerly sought by all the contending par∣ties. His own brother, a clergyman, who was a zealous royalist, came to him with a message
<PB N="360" REF="362"/>
from lord Granville, in the name of the king. The general asked him if he had ever com∣municated the contents of his commission to any other person. His brother replied, to none except to Mr. Price, the general's own chaplain, a man of probity, and in the royal interests. The general altering his counte∣nance, at once changed the discourse, and would enter into no further conference with him. The same deep reserve was held thro' all his subsequent proceedings.</P>
<P>Hearing that the officers were preparing an army to oppose him; and that general Lam∣bert was actually advancing northward to meet him, Monk sent three commissioners to Lon∣don, with very earnest professions of an ac∣commodation, by which means he relaxed their preparations. His commissioners even proceeded so far as to sign a treaty, which he refused to ratify. Still, however, he made pro∣posals for fresh negociations; and the com∣mittee of officers again accepted his fallacious offers.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the people perceiving that they were not entirely defenceless, began to gather spirit, and to exclaim loudly against the tyranny of the army. Hazlerig, and More∣ley, while Lambert was absent, took posses∣sion
<PB N="361" REF="363"/>
of Portsmouth, and declared for the par∣liament. The city apprentices rose in a tu∣mult, and demanded a free parliament. Admi∣ral Lawson came into the river with his squa∣dron, and declared for the parliament; and even the regiments that had been left in Lon∣don, being solicited by their old officers, who had been cashiered, revolted again to the par∣liament. The Rump, thus being invited on all hands, again ventured to resume their seats, and to thunder their votes in turn against the officers, and that part of the army by which they had been ejected. Without taking any notice of Lambert, they sent orders to the troops he conducted, immediately to re∣pair to the garrisons they appointed for them. The soldiers were not slow in obeying the par∣liamentary orders; and Lambert at last found himself deserted by his whole army. He was soon after committed to the Tower; several of his brother-officers cashiered, and the par∣liament seemed now to stand on a firmer basis than before.</P>
<P>But they were far from being so secure as they imagined. Monk, though he had heard of their restitution, and therefore might be supposed to have nothing more to do, still continued to march his army towards the ca∣pital;
<PB N="362" REF="364"/>
all the world equally in doubt as to his motives, and astonished at his reserve. The gentry, on his march, flocked round him with entreaties and addresses, expressing their desire of a new parliament. Fairfax brought him a body of troops, with which he offered to assist in the work of restoration; but Monk continued his inflexible taciturnity, and at last came to St. Alban's, within a few miles of London.</P>
<P>He there sent the parliament a message, desiring them to remove such forces as remain∣ed in London to country quarters. With this, some of the regiments refused to comply, but Monk was resolved to be obeyed; he entered London the next day, turned the soldiers out, and, with his army, took up his quarters in Westminster. He then waited upon the house, which was ready enough to vote him their sincere thanks for the services he had done his country. But he, in a blunt man∣ner, assured them, that his only merit was a desire to restore peace to the community; and, therefore, he entreated them that they would permit a free parliament to be called, as the only balm that could heal the wounds of the constitution. He observed also, that many oaths of admission upon this occasion were un∣necessary;
<PB N="363" REF="365"/>
and the fewer the obligations of this kind, the clearer would their consciences be.</P>
<P>The hope of being insolent with security, soon inspired the citizens to refuse submission to the present government. They resolved to pay no taxes, until the members, formerly excluded by colonel Pride, should be replac∣ed. But the parliament found their general willing to give them the most ready instances of his obedience; he entered the city with his troops, arrested eleven of the most obnoxious of the common-council, and began to destroy the gates. Then he wrote a letter to the par∣liament, telling them what he had done; and begging they would moderate the severity of their orders. But being urged by the house to proceed, he, with all possible circumstances of contempt, broke the gates and port-cullises; and having exposed the city to the scorn and derision of all who hated it, he returned in triumph to his quarters in Westminster. But the next day he began to think he had pro∣ceeded too vigorously in this act of obedience; he therefore marched into the city again, and de∣sired the mayor to call a common-council, where he made many apologies for his conduct the day before. He assured them of his perseverance in the cause of freedom; and that his army
<PB N="364" REF="366"/>
would, for the future, co-operate only in such schemes as they should approve.</P>
<P>This union of the city and the army caused no small alarm in the house of commons. They knew that a free and general parliament was desired by the whole nation; and in such a case, they were convinced that their own power must have an end. But their fears of punishment were still greater than their un∣easiness at dismission; they had been instru∣mental in bringing their king to the block, in loading the nation with various taxes, and some of them had grown rich by the common plunder; they resolved, therefore, to try every method to gain off the general from his new alliance; even some of them, desperate with guilt and fanaticism, promised to invest him with the dignity of supreme magistrate, and to support his usurpation. But Monk was too just, or too wise to hearken to such wild proposals; he resolved to restore the secluded members, and by their means to bring about a new election, which was what he desired.</P>
<P>There was no other method to effect this, but by force of arms: wherefore, having previous∣ly secured the consent of his officers, and exact∣ed a promise from the excluded members, that they would call a full and free parliament, he
<PB N="365" REF="367"/>
accompanied them to Whitehall. From thence, with a numerous guard, he conducted them to the house of commons, the other members of which were then sitting. They were surprised to see a large body of men entering the place; but soon recollected them for their ancient bre∣thren, who had been formerly tumultuously expelled, and were now as tumultuously re∣stored. The number of the new comers was so superior to that of the rump, that the chiefs of this last party now, in their turn, thought proper to withdraw.</P>
<P>The restored members began by repealing all those orders by which they had been ex∣cluded. They renewed and enlarged the ge∣neral's commission; they fixed a proper sti∣pend for the support of the fleet and the army; and having passed these votes for the compo∣sure of the kingdom, they dissolved themselves, and gave orders for the immediate assembling a new parliament. Mean while Monk new modelled his army to the purposes he had in view. Some officers, by his direction, pre∣sented him with an address, in which they promised to obey implicitly the orders of the ensuing parliament. He approved of this en∣gagement, which he ordered to be signed by all the different regiments; and this furnished
<PB N="366" REF="368"/>
him with a pretence for dismissing all the of∣ficers by whom it was rejected.</P>
<P>In the midst of these transactions his en∣deavours were very near being defeated by an accident as dangerous as unexpected. Lam∣bert had escaped from the Tower, and began to assemble forces; and as his activity and principles were sufficiently known, Monk took the earliest precautions to oppose his measures. He dispatched colonel Ingoldsby with his own regiment against Lambert, before he should have time to assemble his dependents. That officer had taken possession of Daventry with four troops of horse; but the greater part of them joined Ingoldsby, to whom he himself surrendered, not without exhibiting marks of pusillanimity, that ill agreed with his former reputation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1660" UNIT="A.D."/> As yet the new parliament was not assem∣bled, and no person had hitherto dived into the designs of the general. He still perse∣vered in his reserve; and although the call∣ing a new parliament was but, in other words, to restore the king, yet his expressions never once betrayed the secret of his bosom. No∣thing but a security of confidence at last ex∣torted the confession from him. He had been intimate with one Morrice, a gentleman of
<PB N="367" REF="369"/>
Devonshire, of a sedentary studious disposi∣tion, and with him alone did he deliberate upon the great and dangerous enterprize of the restoration. Sir John Granville, who had a commission from the king, applied for ac∣cess to the general; but he was desired to communicate his business to Morrice. Gran∣ville refused, though twice urged, to deliver his message to any but the general himself; so that Monk now finding he could depend upon this minister's secrecy, he opened to him his whole intentions; but with his usual cau∣tion still scrupled to commit any thing to pa∣per. In consequence of these the king left the Spanish territories, where he very nar∣rowly escaped being detained at Breda by the governor, under pretence of treating him with proper respect and formality. From thence he retired into Holland, where he resolved to wait for further advice.</P>
<P>In the mean time the elections in parlia∣ment went every where in favour of the king's party. The presbyterians had long been so harrassed by the falshood, the folly, and the tyranny of their independent coadjutors, that they longed, for nothing so ardently as the king's restoration. These, therefore, joined to the royalists, formed a decisive majority on
<PB N="368" REF="370"/>
every contest, and without noise, but with steddy resolution, determined to call back the king. Though the former parliament had voted that no one should be elected, who had himself, or whose father had borne arms for the late king, yet very little regard was any where paid to this ordinance; and in many places the former sufferings of the candidate were his best recommendation.</P>
<P>At length the long expected day for the sit∣ting of a free parliament arrived; and they chose Sir Harbottle Grimstone for their speaker, a man, though at first attached to the opposing party, yet a royalist in his heart. The affections of all were turned towards the king; yet such were their fears, and such dan∣gers attended a freedom of speech, that no one dared for some days to make any mention of his name. They were terrified with former examples of cruelty; and they only shewed their loyalty in their bitter invectives against the late usurper, and in execrations against the murder∣ers of their king. All this time Monk, with his usual reserve, tried their tempers, and ex∣amined the ardour of their wishes; at length he gave directions to Annesley, president of the council, to inform them that one Sir John Granville, a servant of the king's, had been
<PB N="369" REF="371"/>
sent over by his majesty, and was now at the door with a letter to the commons.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the joy and transport with which this message was received. The members for a moment forgot the dignity of their situations, and indulged in a loud excla∣mation of applause. Granville was called in, and the letter eagerly read. A moment's pause was scarce allowed; all at once the house burst out into an universal assent at the king's proposals; and to diffuse the joy more widely, it was voted that the letter and decla∣ration should immediately be published.</P>
<P>The king's declaration was highly relished by every order of the state. It offered a ge∣neral amnesty to all persons whatsoever, and that without any exceptions, but such as should be made by parliament. It promised to indulge scrupulous consciences with liberty in matters of religion; to leave to the exami∣nation of parliament the claims of all such as possessed lands with contested titles; to con∣firm all these concessions by act of parliament; to satisfy the army under general Monk with respect to their arrears, and to give the same rank to his officers when they should be re∣ceived into the king's service.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="372"/>This declaration was not less pleasing to the lords than to the people. After voting the re∣stitution of the ancient form of government, it was resolved to send the king fifty thousand pounds, the duke of York his brother ten thousand, and the duke of Gloucester half that sum. Then both houses erased from their records all acts that had passed to the preju∣dice of royalty. The army, the navy, the city of London, were eager in preparing their addresses to be presented to his majesty; and he was soon after proclaimed with great so∣lemnity at Whitehall, and at Temple Bar. The people, now freed from all restraint, let loose their transports without bounds. Thou∣sands were seen running about frantic with pleasure; and, as lord Clarendon says, such were the numbers of the loyalists that pressed forward on this occasion, that one could not but wonder where those people dwelt who had lately done so much mischief.</P>
<P>Charles took care to confirm the substance of his declarations to the English commis∣sioners, who were dispatched to attend him into his native dominions. Montague, the Eng∣lish admiral, waited upon his majesty to in∣form him that the fleet expected his orders at Scheveling. The duke of York immediately
<PB N="371" REF="373"/>
went on board, and took the command as lord high-admiral. The king went on board, and landing at Dover, was received by the ge∣neral, whom he tenderly embraced. Very different was his present triumphant return from the forlorn state in which he left the English coast at Sussex. He now saw the same people that had ardently sought his life, as warmly expressing their pleasure at his safe∣ty, and repentance for their past delusions. He entered London on the twenty-ninth of May, which was his birth-day. An innu∣merable concourse of people lined the way wherever he passed, and rent the air with their acclamations. They had been so long dis∣tracted by unrelenting factions, oppressed and alarmed by a succession of tyrannies, that they could no longer suppress these emotions of de∣light to behold their constitution restored; or rather, like a phoenix, appearing more beau∣tiful and vigorous from the ruins of its former conflagration.</P>
<P>Fanaticism, with its long train of gloomy terrors, fled at the approach of freedom; the arts of society and peace began to return; and it had been happy for the people if the arts of luxury had not entered in their train.</P>

</FIGURE> CHAP. XXXV. CHARLES II.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is one of the most extraordinary epochas in English history, in which we see the people tossed into opposite factions, and, as the sea after a storm, still continuing those vio∣lent motions by which they were first impelled. We see them at one period of the following reign, with unbounded adulation solliciting the shackles of arbitrary power; at another,
<PB N="373" REF="375"/>
with equal animosity banishing all the emis∣saries of unbounded power from the throne; now courting the monarch, and then threat∣ening those on whom he most depended. There seems a clue that can unravel all these inconsistencies. While the people thought the king a protestant, they were willing to entrust him with their lives and fortunes; but when they supposed that he was more inclining to popery, all their confidence vanished, and they were even willing to punish papists, as the properest method of shewing their resent∣ment against himself.</P>
<P>When Charles came to the throne he was thirty years of age, possessed of an agreeable person, an elegant address, and an engaging manner. His whole demeanor and be∣haviour was well calculated to support and encrease popularity. Accustomed during his exile to live chearfully among his cour∣tiers, he carried the same endearing fami∣liarities to the throne; and from the levity of his temper no injuries were dreaded from his former resentments. But it was soon found that all these advantages were merely superfi∣cial. His indolence and love of pleasure made him averse to all kinds of business; his fami∣liarities were prostituted to the worst as well as the best of his subjects; and he took no
<PB N="374" REF="376"/>
care to reward his former friends, as he had taken no steps to be avenged of his former enemies.</P>
<P>It required some time before the several parts of the state, disfigured by war and faction, could come into proper form; a council was composed, into which church of England men and presbyterians indiscriminately were admit∣ed; and the king's choice of his principal minis∣ters was universally pleasing to the people. Sir Edward Hyde, who had attended him in his exile, was now created a peer by the title of lord Clarendon, and appointed lord-chancel∣lor, and first minister of state. This excel∣lent man is better known now by his merits as an historian, than as a statesman; but his in∣tegrity and wisdom were equally excellent in both. The marquis, afterwards created duke of Ormond, was appointed lord-steward of the houshold, the earl of Southampton high trea∣surer, and Sir Edward Nicholas secretary of state. These men, combined by private friend∣ship, and pursuing one common aim, laboured only for the public, and supported its inter∣ests with their own.</P>
<P>But though the joy of the people was unbounded, yet something was thought to be due to justice, and some vengeance was necessary to be taken upon those who had
<PB N="375" REF="377"/>
lately involved the nation in its calami∣ties. Though an act of indemnity was pass∣ed, those who had an immediate hand in the king's death were excepted. Even Crom∣well, Ireton, and Bradshaw, though dead, were considered as proper objects of resent∣ment; their bodies were dug from their graves, dragged to the place of execution, and, after hanging some time, buried under the gallows. Of the rest, who sat in judgment on the late monarch's trial, some were dead, and some were thought worthy of pardon. Ten only, out of fourscore, were devoted to immediate destruction. These were enthusiasts, who had all along acted from principle, and who, in the general spirit of rage excited against them, shewed a fortitude that might do honour to a better cause.</P>
<P>General Harrison, who was first brought to his trial, pleaded his cause with that undaunted firmness which he had shewn through life. What he had done, he said, was from the im∣pulses of the spirit of God. He would not, for any benefit to himself, hurt an hair of the poorest man or woman upon earth; and dur∣ing the usurpation of Cromwell, when all the rest of the world acknowledged his right, or bowed down to his power, he had boldly up∣braided
<PB N="376" REF="378"/>
the usurper to his face; and all the terrors of imprisonment, and all the allure∣ments of ambition, had not been able to bend him to a compliance to that deceitful tyrant. Harrison's death was marked with the same admirable constancy which he shewed at his his trial; so that the greatness of some vir∣tues which he possessed, in some measure coun∣terbalanced the greatness of his guilt.</P>
<P>Carew, Coke, Peters, Scot, Clement, Scrope, Jones, Hacker, and Axtel, shared the same fate. They bore the scorn of the multitude, and the cruelty of the executioner, not simply with fortitude, but with the spirit and confi∣dence of martyrs, who suffered for having done their duty. Some circumstances of scan∣dalous barbarity attended their execution. Har∣rison's entrails were torn out, and thrown into the fire before he expired. His head was fixed on the sledge that drew Coke and Peters to the place of execution, with the face turned towards them. The executioner having mang∣led Coke approached Peters, besmeared with the blood of his friend, and asked how he liked that work. Peters viewed him with an air of scorn:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You have butchered a servant of God in my sight; but I defy your cruelty."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="379"/>This was all the blood that was shed in so great a restoration. The rest of the king's judges were reprieved, and afterwards dis∣persed into several prisons. Charles being di∣rected in all things by Clarendon, gave uni∣versal satisfaction as well by the lenity as the justice of his conduct. The army was dis∣banded that had for so many years governed the nation; prelacy, and all the ceremonies of the church of England, were restored; at the same time that the king pretended to preserve an air of moderation and neutrality. In fact, with regard to religion, Charles, in his gayer hours, was a professed deist, and attached to none; but in the latter part of his life, when he began to think more seriously, he shewed an inclination to the catholic persuasion, which he had strongly imbibed in his exile.</P>
<P>But this toleration, in which all were equally included, was not able to remove the fears, or quell the enthusiasm of a few desperate men, who, by an unexampled combination, were impelled by one common phrenzy. One Ven∣ner, a desperate enthusiast, who had often conspired against Cromwell, and had as often been pardoned, had by this time persuaded his followers, that if they would take arms, Jesus would come to put himself at their head.
<PB N="378" REF="380"/>
With these expectations, to the number of sixty persons, they issued forth into the streets of London in complete armour, and proclaim∣ed king Jesus where ever they went. They believed themselves invulnerable and invinci∣ble, and expected the same fortune which had attended Gideon, and the other heroes of the Old Testament. Every one at first fled before them; one unhappy man being asked who he was for, answering that he was for God and the king, they slew him upon the spot. In this manner they went from street to street, and made a desperate resistance against a body of the train bands that was sent to attack them. After killing many of the assailants, they made a regular retreat into Cane wood, near Hamp∣stead. Being dislodged from thence, the next morning they returned to London, and took possession of an house, in which they defended themselves against a body of troops, until the majority was killed. At last the troops, who had untiled the house, and were tired of slaugh∣ter, rushed in, and seized the few that were left alive. They were tried, condemned, and executed; and to the last they declared, that if they were deceived, it was the Lord himself that was their deceiver.</P>
<P>The absurdity, and even ridicule which at∣tended the professions and expectation of these
<PB N="379" REF="381"/>
poor deluded men, struck the people very strongly; and from the gloomy moroseness of enthusiasm, they now went over into the oppo∣site extreme of riot and debauchery. The court itself set them the example; nothing but scenes of gallantry and festivity were to be seen; the horrors of the late war were become the subject of ridicule; the formality and ig∣norance of the sectaries were displayed upon the stage, and even laughed at from the pul∣pit. But while the king thus rioted, the old faithful friends and followers of his family were left unrewarded. Numbers who had fought for him and his father, and had lost their whole fortunes in his service, still con∣tinued to pine in want and oblivion. While, in the mean time, their persecutors, who had profited by the times, had acquired fortunes during the civil war, and were still permitted to enjoy them without molestation. The suf∣ferers petitioned in vain: the family of the Stuarts were never remarkable for their grati∣tude; and the amusers, the flatterers, and the concubines of this monarch, enjoyed all his consideration. The wretched royalists mur∣mured without redress; he fled from their gloomy expostulations to scenes of mirth, riot, and festivity.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="382"/>Nevertheless his parliaments, both of Eng∣land and Scotland, seemed willing to make reparation for their former disobedience, by their present concessions.<MILESTONE N="1661" UNIT="A.D."/> In the English house, monarchy and episcopacy were carried to as great splendour, as they had suffered misery and depression. The bishops were per∣mitted to resume their seats in the house of peers; all military authority was acknowledg∣ed to be vested in the king; and he was em∣powered to appoint commissioners for regula∣ting corporations, and expelling such mem∣bers as had intruded themselves by violence, or professed principles dangerous to the consti∣tution. An act of uniformity in religion was passed, by which it was required that every clergyman should be re-ordained, if he had not before received episcopal ordination; that he should declare his assent to every thing con∣tained in the Book of Common Prayer, and should take the oath of canonical obedience. In consequence of this law, above two thou∣sand of the presbyterian clergy relinquished their cures in one day, to the great astonish∣ment of the nation; thus sacrificing their in∣terest to their religion.</P>
<P>But the Scotch parliament went still greater lengths in their prostrations to the king. It was
<PB N="381" REF="383"/>
there that his divine, indefeasible, and heredi∣tary right, was asserted in the fullest and most positive terms. His right was extended to their lives and possessions, and from his original grant was said to come all that his subjects might be said to enjoy. They voted him an additional reve∣nue of forty thousand pounds; and all their for∣mer violences were treated with a degree of the utmost detestation.</P>
<P>This was the time for the king to have made himself independent of all parliaments; and it is said that Southampton, one of his ministers, had thought of procuring his master from the commons the grant of a revenue of two millions a year, which would effectually render him absolute; but in this his views were obstructed by the great Clarendon, who, tho' attached to the king, was still more the friend of liberty and the laws. Charles, however, was no way interested in these opposite views of his ministers; he only desired money, in order to prosecute his pleasures; and provid∣ed he had that, he little regarded the manner in which it was obtained.</P>
<P>It was this careless and expensive disposi∣tion that first tended to disgust his subjects, and to dispel that intoxication of loyalty, which had taken place at his restoration. Tho'
<PB N="382" REF="384"/>
the people were pleased with the mirth and pleasantry of their monarch, yet they could not help murmuring at his indolence; his de∣baucheries, and profusion. They could not help remembering the strict frugality and active diligence that marked the usurper's ad∣ministration; they called to mind the victories they had gained under him, and the vast pro∣jects he had undertaken. But they now saw an opposite picture; a court sunk in debauch∣ery, and they taxes of the nation only employ∣ed in extending vice, and corrupting the morals of the people. The ejected clergy did not fail to enflame these just resentments in the minds of the audience; but particularly when the nation saw Dunkirk, which had been acquired during the late vigorous administra∣tion, now basely sold to the French, for a small sum to supply the king's extragance, they could put no bounds to their complaints. From this time,<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="A.D."/> he found the wheels of go∣vernment clogged with continual obstructions, and his parliaments reluctantly granting those supplies, which he as meanly condescended to implore.</P>
<P>His continual exigences drove him con∣stantly to measures no way suited to his incli∣nation. Among others, was his marriage, cele∣brated
<PB N="383" REF="385"/>
at this time with Catharine, the Infanta of Portugal, who, though a virtuous princess, possessed as it should seem but few personal attractions. It was the portion of this prin∣cess that the needy monarch was enamoured of, which amounted to three hundred thousand pounds, together with the fortress of Tangier in Africa, and of Bombay in the East Indies. The chancellor Clarendon, the dukes of Or∣mond, and Southampton, urged many reasons against this match, particularly the likelihood of her never having any children; the king disre∣garded their advice, and the inauspicious mar∣riage was celebrated accordingly.</P>
<P>But still his necessities were greater than his supplies. He never much loved the steady virtue of lord Clarendon, and imputed to him some of those necessities to which he was redu∣ced. It is said also that this great minister prevented him from repudiating the queen, which he had thoughts of doing, in order to marry one Mrs. Stuart, on whom he had pla∣ced his affections, by procuring that lady to be privately married to the duke of Rich∣mond. However this be, he was now willing to give him up to the resentment of the par∣liament, to whom he was become obnoxious, in order to obtain some farther supplies. For
<PB N="384" REF="386"/>
this purpose he assembled the commons in the Banquetting-house; and, in the close of a flat∣tering speech, replete with professions of eter∣nal gratitude, and the warmest affection, he begged a supply for his present occasions, which he said were extremely pressing. They could not resist his humble supplications; they granted him four subsidies; and the clergy, in convocation, followed their example. On this occasion lord Bristol ventured to impeach the chancellor in the house of peers; but not sup∣porting his charge for this time, the affair dropped, only in order to be revived again the next sessions with greater animosity.</P>
<P>It was probably with a view of recruiting the supply for his pleasures, that he was in∣duced to declare war against the Dutch, as the money appointed for that purpose, would go through his hands. A vote, by his contri∣vance, was procured in the house of commons, alledging, that the wrongs, affronts, and in∣dignities offered by the Dutch in several quar∣ters of the globe, had in a great measure ob∣structed the trade of the nation. This was enough for his majesty to proceed upon. As his prodigality always kept him necessitous, he foresaw that he should be able to convert a part of the supplies to his private amuse∣ments.
<PB N="385" REF="387"/>
His brother also, the duke of York, longed for an opportunity of signalizing his courage and conduct, as high admiral, against a people he hated, not only for their republi∣can principles, but also as being one of the chief bulwarks of the protestant religion.</P>
<P>This war began on each side with mutual depredations. The English, under the com∣mand of Sir Robert Holmes, not only expell∣ed the Dutch from Cape Corse castle, on the coast of Africa, but likewise seized the Dutch settlements of Cape Verde, and the Isle of Goree. Sailing from thence to America, the admiral possessed himself of Nova Belgia, since called New York; a country that has since continued annexed to the English government. On the other hand, de Ruyter, the Dutch admiral, sailed to Guinea, dispossessed the English of all their settlements there, except Cape Corse. He then sailed to America, attacked Barba∣does, but was repulsed. He afterwards com∣mitted hostilities on Long Island. Soon after, the two most considerable fleets of each na∣tion met, the one under the duke of York, to the number of an hundred and fourteen sail, the other commanded by Opdam, admi∣ral of the Dutch navy, of nearly equal force. The engagement began at four in the morn∣ing,
<PB N="386" REF="388"/>
and both sides fought with their usual in∣trepidity. The duke of York was in the hot∣test part of the engagement, and behaved with great spirit and composure, while his lords and attendants were killed beside him. In the heat of the action, when engaged in close fight with the duke, the Dutch admiral's ship blew up: this accident much discouraged the Dutch, who fled towards their own coast; they had nineteen ships sunk and taken, the victors lost only one. This disaster threw the Dutch into consternation; and de Wit, their great minister, whose genius and wisdom were admirable, was obliged to come on board, and take the command of the fleet upon himself. This extraordinary man quickly became as much master of naval affairs, as if he had been from his infancy educated in them. He even improved some parts of the naval art, beyond what expert mariners had ever expected to attain.</P>
<P>The success of the English naturally excited the jealousy of the neighbouring states, par∣ticularly France and Denmark, who resolved to protect the Dutch against the superior power of their opposers. The Dutch, being thus strengthened by so powerful an alliance, re∣solved to face their conquerors once more.
<PB N="387" REF="389"/>
De Ruyter, their great admiral, was returned from his expedition to Guinea; and was ap∣pointed, at the head of seventy-six sail, to join the duke of Beaufort, the French admiral, who, it was supposed, was then entering the British channel from Toulon. The duke of Albemarle and prince Rupert now commanded the Eng∣lish fleet, which did not exceed seventy-four sail. Albemarle, who from his successes un∣der Cromwell had learned too much to des∣pise the enemy, proposed to detach prince Ru∣pert with twenty ships to oppose the duke of Beaufort. Sir George Ayscue, well acquaint∣ed with the force of his enemies, protested against the temerity of this resolution; but Albemarle's authority prevailed. The Eng∣lish and Dutch, thus engaging upon unequal terms, a battle ensued, the most memorable in the annals of the ocean. The battle began with incredible fury: the Dutch admiral Evertzen was killed by a cannon ball, and one vessel of their fleet was blown up, while one of the English ships was taken: darkness parted the combatants for the first day. The second day they renewed the combat with encreased ani∣mosity; sixteen fresh ships joined the Dutch, and the English were so shattered, that their fighting ships were reduced to twenty-eight.
<PB N="388" REF="390"/>
Upon retreating towards their own coast, the Dutch followed them, where another dreadful conflict was beginning, but parted by the dark∣ness of the night as before. The morning of the third day, the English were obliged to conti∣nue their retreat, and the Dutch persisted in pursuing. Albemarle, who still kept in the rear, and presented a dreadful front to the enemy, made a desperate resolution to blow up his ship rather than submit to the enemy; when he happily found himself reinforced by prince Rupert with sixteen ships of the line. By this time it was night; and the next morn∣ing, after a distant cannonading, the fleets came to a close combat, which was continued with great violence, till they were parted by a mist. Sir George Ayscue, in a ship of one hundred guns, had the misfortune to strike on the Galoper Sands, where he was surrounded and taken. The English retired first into their harbours; both sides claimed the victory, but the Dutch certainly obtained the advantage, though not the glory of the combat.</P>
<P>A second engagement, equally bloody, fol∣lowed soon after, with larger fleets on both sides, commanded by the same admirals; and in this the Dutch were obliged to own them∣selves vanquished, and retreat into their own
<PB N="389" REF="391"/>
harbours. But they soon were in a capacity to out-number the English fleet, by the junc∣tion of Beaufort the French admiral. The Dutch fleet appeared in the Thames, con∣ducted by their great admiral; and threw the English into the utmost consternation: a chain had been drawn across the river Medway; some fortifications had been added to the forts along the banks, but all these were unequal to the present force: Sheerness was soon taken, the Dutch passed forward, and broke the chain, though fortified by some ships, sunk there by Albemarle's orders. Destroying the shipping in their passage, they advanced still onward, with six men of war, and five fire-ships, as far as Upnore castle, where they burned three men of war. The whole city of London was in consternation; it was expected that the Dutch might fail up next tide to London bridge, and destroy, not only the shipping, but even the buildings of the metropolis. But the Dutch were unable to prosecute that pro∣ject, from the failure of the French, who had promised to give them assistance; spreading, therefore, an alarm along the coast, and having insulted Norwich, they returned to their own ports, to boast their insult on the British glory.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="392"/><MILESTONE N="1667" UNIT="A.D."/> Nothing could exceed the indignation felt by the people at this disgrace. But they had lately sustained some accidental calamities, which in some measure moderated their rage and their pride. A plague had ravaged the city the year before, which swept away more than an hundred thousand of its inhabitants. This calamity was soon after followed by an∣other still more dreadful, as more unexpected: a fire breaking out at a baker's house, who lived in Pudding-lane, near the bridge, it spread with such rapidity, that no efforts could extinguish it till it laid in ashes the most con∣siderable party of the city. The conflagration continued three days; while the wretched in∣habitants fled from one street, only to be spec∣tators of equal calamities in another. At length, when all hope vanished, and a total destruction was expected, the flames ceased unexpectedly, after having reduced thousands from affluence to misery. As the streets were narrow, and mostly built of wood, the flames spread the faster; and the unusual dryness of the season prevented the proper supplies of water. But the people were not satisfied with these obvious motives; having been long taught to impute their calamities to the ma∣chinations of their enemies, they now ascribed
<PB N="391" REF="393"/>
the present misfortune to the same cause, and imputed the burning of the city to a plot laid by the papists. But happily for that sect, no proofs were brought of their guilt, though all men were willing to credit them. The magistracy, therefore, contented themselves with ascribing it to them, on a monument rais∣ed where the fire began; and which still con∣tinues as a proof of the blind credulity of the times. This calamity, though at first it af∣fected the fortunes of thousands, in the end proved both beneficial and ornamental to the city. It rose from its ruins in greater beauty than ever; and the streets being widened, and built of brick instead of wood, became thus more wholesome and more secure.</P>
<P>These complicated misfortunes did not fail to excite many murmurs among the people; fearful of laying the blame on the king, whose authority was formidable, they very li∣berally ascribed all their calamities to papists, jesuits, and fanatics. The war against the Dutch was exclaimed against, as unsuccessful and unnecessary; as being an attempt to hum∣ble that nation, who were equal enemies of popery with themselves. Charles himself also began to be sensible that all the ends for which he had undertaken the Dutch war, were like∣ly
<PB N="392" REF="394"/>
to prove entirely ineffectual. Whatever projects he might have formed for secreting the money granted him by parliament for his own use, he had hitherto failed in his inten∣tion; and instead of laying up, he found him∣self considerably in debt. Proposals were, therefore, thrown out for an accommodation, which, after some negociation, the Dutch con∣sented to accept. A treaty was concluded at Breda, by which the colony of New York was ceded by the Dutch to the English, and has continued a most valuable acquisition to the present time.</P>
<P>Upon the whole of this treaty, it was con∣sidered as inglorious to the English, as they failed in gaining any redress upon the com∣plaints which gave rise to it. Lord Claren∣don, therefore, gained a share of blame, both for having first advised an unnecessary war, and then for concluding a disgraceful peace. He had been long declining in the king's fa∣vour, and he was no less displeasing to the majority of the people. His severe virtue, his uncomplying temper, and his detestation of factious measures, were unlikely to gain him many partizans in such a court as that of Charles, that had been taught to regard every thing serious as somewhat criminal. There
<PB N="393" REF="395"/>
were many accusations now therefore brought up against him; the sale of Dunkirk, the bad pay∣ment of the seamen, and disgrace at Chatham, were all added to the accumulation of his guilt. But particularly his imputed ambition was urged among his crimes. His daughter had, while yet in Paris, commenced an amour with the duke of York; and had permitted his gallan∣tries to transgress the bounds of virtue. Charles, who then loved Clarendon, and who was un∣willing that he should suffer the mortification of a parent, obliged the duke to marry his daugh∣ter; and this marriage, which was just in itself, be∣came culpable in the minister. A building like∣wise of more expence than his slender fortune could afford, had been undertaken by him; and this was regarded as a structure raised by the plunder of the public. Fewer accusations than these would have been sufficient to disgrace him with Charles; he ordered the seals to be taken from him, and given to Sir Orlando Bridgeman.</P>
<P>This seemed the signal for Clarendon's ene∣mies to step in, and effect his entire overthrow. The house of commons, in their address to the king, gave him thanks for his dismission of that nobleman; and immediately a charge was opened against him in the house, by Mr. Sey∣mour,
<PB N="394" REF="396"/>
consisting of seventeen articles. These, which were only a catalogue of the popular rumours before-mentioned, appeared at first sight false or frivolous. However Clarendon finding the popular torrent, united to the vio∣lence of power, running with impetuosity against him, thought proper to withdraw to France. The legislature then passed a bill of banishment and incapacity, while Clarendon continued to reside in a private manner at Paris, where he employed his leisure in reducing his history of the civil war into form, for which he had before collected materials.</P>
<P>A confederacy of great importance, which goes by the name of the Triple Alliance, was formed by Charles, soon after the fall of this great statesman, as if to shew that he could still supply his place. It was conducted by Sir William Temple, one of the great ornaments of English literature; who united the philoso∣pher and the statesman, and was equally great in both. This alliance was formed between England, Holland, and Sweden, to prevent the French king from completing his con∣quests in the Netherlands. That monarch had already subdued the greater part of that delightful country; when he was unexpectedly stopped in the midst of his career by this league;
<PB N="395" REF="397"/>
in which it was agreed by the contracting powers, that they would constitute themselves arbiters of the differences between France and Spain, and check the inordinate pretensions of ei∣ther.</P>
<P>To this foreign confederacy succeeded one of a domestic nature, that did not promise such beneficial effects as the former. The king had long been fluctuating between his pride and his pleasures; the one urged him to extend his prerogative, the other to enjoy the good things that fortune threw in his way. He therefore would be likely to find the great∣est satisfaction in those ministers, who could flatter both his wishes at once. He was ex∣cited by the active spirit of his brother, to rise above humble solicitations to his parliament; and was beset by some desperate counsellors, who importuned and encouraged him to assert his own independence. The principal of those were, Clifford, Ashley, Buckingham, Arling∣ton, Lauderdale, a junto distinguished by the appellation of the Cabal, a word containing the initial letters of their names. Never was there a more dangerous ministry in England, nor one more fitted to destroy all that liberty which had been establishing for ages.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="398"/>Sir Thomas Clifford, was a man of a daring and impetuous spirit, rendered more danger∣ous by eloquence and intrigue. Lord Ashley, soon after known by the name of lord Shaftes∣bury, was the most extraordinary man of his age; he had been a member of the long par∣liament, and had great influence among the presbyterians; he was a favourite of Crom∣well, and afterwards had a considerable hand in the restoration; he was turbulent, ambi∣tious, subtle, and enterprising; well acquaint∣ed with the blind attachment of parties, he surmounted all shame; and while he had the character of never betraying any of his friends, yet he changed his party as it suited his con∣venience. The duke of Buckingham was gay, capricious, of some wit, and great viva∣city, well fitted to unite, and harmonize the graver tempers of which this junto was com∣posed. Arlington was a man but of very mo∣derate capacity, his intentions were good, but he wanted courage to persevere in them. Last∣ly, the duke of Lauderdale, who was not de∣fective in natural, and still less in acquired ta∣lents, but neither was his address graceful, nor his understanding just; he was ambitious, obstinate, insolent, and sullen. These were the men to whom Charles gave up the con∣duct
<PB N="397" REF="399"/>
of his affairs; and who plunged the re∣maining part of his reign in difficulties,<MILESTONE N="1670" UNIT="A.D."/> which produced the most dangerous symptoms.</P>
<P>A secret alliance with France, and a rup∣ture with Holland, were the first consequences of their advice. The duke of York had the confidence boldly to declare himself a catho∣lic; and to alarm the fears of the nation still more, a liberty of conscience was allowed to all sectaries, whether dissenters, or papists. These measures were considered by the peo∣ple as destructive, not only of their liber∣ties, but of their religion, which they va∣lued more. A proclamation was issued, con∣taining very rigorous clauses in favour of press∣ing; another full of menaces against those who ventured to speak undutifully of his ma∣jesty's measures; and even against those who heard such discourses, unless they informed in due time against the offenders. These mea∣sures, though still within bounds, were yet no way suitable to that legal administration, which upon his restoration he had promised to esta∣blish.</P>
<P>The English now saw themselves engaged in a league with France against the Dutch; and consequently, whether victorious or vanquish∣ed, their efforts were like to be equally unsuc∣cessful.
<PB N="398" REF="400"/>
The French had for some years been growing into power; and now, under the con∣duct of their ambitious monarch, Lewis XIV. they began to threaten the liberties of Europe, and particularly the protestant religion, of which Lewis had shewn himself a determined enemy. It gave the people, therefore, a gloomy prospect, to see an union formed, which, if successful, must totally subvert that balance of power, which the protestants aimed at pre∣serving; nor were they less apprehensive of their own sovereign, who, though he pretend∣ed to turn all religion to ridicule in his gayer hours, yet was secretly attached to the catho∣lics, or was very much suspected of being so. The first events of this war, therefore, were very correspondent to their fears of French treachery. The English and French combin∣ed fleets, commanded by the duke of York, and the mareschal d'Etrees, met the Dutch fleet to the number of ninety sail, commanded by admiral de Ruyter, and a furious battle en∣sued. In this engagement, the gallant Sand∣wich, who commanded the English van, drove his ship into the midst of the enemy, beat off the admiral that ventured to attack him, sunk another ship that attempted to board him, and sunk three fire-ships that endeavoured
<PB N="399" REF="401"/>
to grapple with him. Tho' his vessel was torn with shot, and out of a thousand men, there only remained four hundred, he still continued to thunder in the midst of the engagement. At last a fire-ship, more fortunate than the former, having laid hold of his vessel, her destruction was now inevitable. Sandwich however refused to quit his ship, though warned by Sir Edward Haddock his captain; he perished in the flames, while the engagement continued to rage all around him. Night parted the combatants; the Dutch retired, and were not followed by the English. The loss sustained by the two maritime powers was nearly equal; but the French suffered very little, not having entered into the heat of the engagement. It was even supposed that they had orders for this conduct, and to spare their own ships, while the Dutch and English should grow weak by their mu∣tual animosities.</P>
<P>The combined powers were much more successful against the Dutch by land. Lewis conquered all before him, crossed the Rhine, took all the frontier towns of the enemy, and threatened the new republic with a final disso∣lution. Terms were proposed to them by the two conquerors. Lewis offered them such as would have deprived them of all power of
<PB N="400" REF="402"/>
resisting an invasion from France by land. Those of Charles exposed them equally to every invasion from sea. At last, the murmurs of the English at seeing this brave and industrious people, the supporters of the protestant cause, totally sunk, and on the brink of destruction, were too loud not to impress the king. He was obliged to call a parliament to take the sense of the nation upon his conduct; <MILESTONE N="1673" UNIT="A.D."/> and he soon saw how his subjects stood affected.</P>
<P>The eyes of all men, both abroad and at home, were fixed upon this new parliament, which, af∣ter many prorogations, continued sitting for near two years. Before the commons entered upon business, there lay before them an affair, which discovered, beyond a possibility of doubt, the arbitrary projects of the king. It had been a constant practice in the house for many years, in case of any vacancy, to issue out writs for new elections; but, by Shaftesbury's advice, several members had taken their seats upon more irregular writs issued by the chancellor; so that the whole house in time might be filled with members clandestinely called up by the court. The house was no sooner therefore assembled, and the speaker placed in his chair, than a motion was made against this method of election; and the members themselves,
<PB N="401" REF="403"/>
thus called to parliament, had the modesty to withdraw.</P>
<P>The king's late declaration of indulgence to all sectaries was next taken into consideration, and a remonstrance drawn up against that ex∣ercise of the prerogative. The commons per∣sisted in their opposition to it; and represented that such a practice, if admitted, might tend to interrupt the free course of the laws, and alter the legislative power, which had always been acknowledged to reside in the king and the two houses. Charles, therefore, found himself obliged, reluctantly, to retract his declaration; but that he might do it with a better grace, he asked the opinion of the house of peers, who advised him to comply. The commons ex∣pressed the utmost satisfaction with this mea∣sure, and the most entire duty to the king. He on his part assured them, that he would wil∣lingly pass any law which might tend to give them satisfaction in all their just grievances.</P>
<P>Having abridged the king's stretches of power in these points, they went still farther, and resolved to make the conformity of na∣tional principles still more general. A law was passed, entitled the Test act, imposing an oath on all who should enjoy any public office. Besides the taking the oaths of allegiance, and
<PB N="402" REF="404"/>
the king's supremacy, they were obliged to receive the sacrament once a year in the esta∣blished church, and to abjure all belief in the doctrine of transubstantiation. As the dissen∣ters also had seconded the efforts of the com∣mons against the king's declaration for indul∣gence, a bill was passed for their ease and re∣lief, which, however, went with some difficulty through the house of peers.</P>
<P>But still the great object of their meeting was to be enquired into; for the war against the Dutch continued to rage with great ani∣mosity. Several sea engagements succeeded each other very rapidly, which brought on no decisive action; both nations claiming the victory after every battle. The commons, therefore, weary of the war, and distrustful even of success, resolved that the standing army was a grievance. They next declared, that they would grant no more supplies to carry on the Dutch war, unless it appeared that the ene∣my continued so obstinate as to refuse all reason∣able conditions. To cut short these disagreeable altercations, the king resolved to prorogue the parliament; and, with that intention, he went unexpectedly to the house of peers, and sent the usher of the black-rod to summon the house of commons to attend. It happened that
<PB N="403" REF="405"/>
the speaker and the usher nearly met at the door of the house; but the speaker, being within, some of the members suddenly shut the door, and cried To the chair! Upon which the following motions were instantly made in a tumultuous manner. That the alliance with France was a grievance; that the evil counsellors of the king were a grievance; that the duke of Lauderdale was a grievance; and then the house rose in great confusion. The king soon saw that he could expect no supply from the commons for carrying on the war, which was so odious to them; he resolved, therefore, to make a seperate peace with the Dutch, on terms which they had proposed through the channel of the Spanish ambassador. For form sake, he asked the advice of his parliament, who, concurring heartily in his intentions, a peace was concluded accordingly.</P>
<P>This turn in the system of the king's politics was very pleasing to the nation in general; but the Cabal quickly saw that it would be the destruction of all their future attempts and power. Shaftesbury, therefore, was the first to desert them, and go over to the country party, who received him, with open arms, and trusted him with unbounded reserve. Clifford was dead. Buckingham was desirous of imitating
<PB N="404" REF="406"/>
Shaftesbury's example. Lauderdale and Ar∣lington were exposed to all the effects of na∣tional resentment. Articles of impeachment were drawn up against the former, which, however, were never prosecuted; and as for the other, he every day grew more and more out of favour with the king, and contemptible to the people. This was an end of the power of a junto, that had laid a setled plan for over∣turning the constitution, and fixing unlimited monarchy upon its ruins.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1674" UNIT="A.D."/> In the mean time, the war between the Dutch and the French went on with the greatest vigour; and although the latter were repressed for a while, they still continued making en∣croachments upon the enemies territories. The Dutch forces were commanded by the prince of Orange, who was possessed of courage, acti∣vity, vigilance, and patience; but he was in∣ferior in genius to those consummate generals opposed to him. He was, therefore, always unsuccessful; but still found means to repair his losses, and to make head in a little time against his victorious enemies. These ineffec∣tual struggles for the preservation of his coun∣try's freedom, interested the English strongly in his favour; so that from being his opposers, they now wished to lend him assistance. They
<PB N="405" REF="407"/>
considered their alliance with France as threa∣tening a subversion to the protestant, religion; and they longed for an union with him, as the only means of security. The commons, there∣fore, adressed the king, representing the dan∣ger to which the kingdom was exposed from the growing greatness of France; and they assured him, in case of a war, that they would not be backward in their supplies. Charles was not displeased with the latter part of their address, as money was necessary for his pleasures. He therefore told them, that unless they granted him six hundred thousand pounds, it would be impossible for him to give them a satisfactory answer. The commons refused to trust to his majesty's professions; his well known profusion was before their eyes. The king reproved them for their diffi∣dence, and immediately ordered them to ad∣journ.<MILESTONE N="1677" UNIT="A.D."/> The marriage of the duke of York's eldest daugther, the princess Mary, heir appa∣rent to the crown, with the prince of Orange, was a measure that gave great satisfaction in these general disquietudes about religion. The negotiation was brought about by the king's own desire; and the protestants now saw an happy prospect before them of a succession, that would be favourable to their much loved
<PB N="406" REF="408"/>
reformation. A negotiation for peace between the French and the Dutch followed soon after, which was rather favourable to the latter. But the mutual animosities of these states not being as yet sufficiently quelled, the war was conti∣nued for some time longer. The king, therefore, to satisfy his parliament, who declar∣ed loudly against the French, sent over an army of three thousand men to the continent, under the command of the duke of Mon∣mouth, to secure Ostend. A fleet also was fitted out with great diligence; and a quadru∣ple alliance was projected between England, Holland, Spain, and the Emperor. These vigorous measures brought about the famous treaty of Nimeguen, which gave a general peace to Europe.<MILESTONE N="1678" UNIT="A.D."/> But though peace was se∣cured abroad, the discontents of the people still continued at home.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI. CHARLES II. (Continued.)</HEAD>
<P>THIS reign presents the most amazing contrasts of levity and cruelty, of mirth and gloomy suspicion. Ever since the fatal league with France, the people had entertained vio∣lent jealousies against the court. The fears and discontents of the nation were vented without restraint; the apprehensions of a popish successor, an abandoned court, and a parliament which, though sometimes asser∣tors of liberty, yet continuing for seventeen years without change; these naturally render∣ed the minds of mankind timid and suspicious, and they only wanted objects on which to wreck their ill humour.</P>
<P>When the spirit of the English is once rous∣ed, they either find objects of suspicion or make them. On the twelfth of August, one Kirby, a chemist, accosted the king as he was walking in the Park.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, said he, keep within the company, your enemies have a design upon your life, and you may be
<PB N="408" REF="410"/>
shot in this very walk."</Q>
Being questioned in consequence of this strange intimation, he offered to produce one doctor Tongue, a weak credulous clergyman, who had told him that two persons, named Grove and Pickering, were engaged to murder the king; and that Sir George Wakeman, the queen's physician, had undertaken the same task by poison. Tongue was introduced to the king with a bundle of papers relating to this pretended con∣spiracy, and was referred to the lord treasurer Danby. He there declared that the papers were thrust under his door; and he afterwards declared, that he knew the author of them, who desired that his name might be concealed, as he dreaded the resentment of the Jesuits.</P>
<P>This information appeared so vague and unsatisfactory, that the king concluded the whole was a fiction. However Tongue was not to be repressed in the ardour of his loyalty; he went again to the lord treasurer, and told him, that a pacquet of letters, written by Jesuits concerned in the plot, was that night to be put into the post-house for Windsor, directed to one Bedingfield, a Jesuit, who was confessor to the duke of York, and who resided there. These letters had actually been received a few hours before by the duke; but he had shewn them to the king as
<PB N="409" REF="411"/>
a forgery, of which he neither knew the drift nor the meaning. This incident still farther con∣firmed the king in his incredulity. He desired, however, that it might be concealed, as it might raise a flame in the nation; but the duke, sollicitous to prove his innocence, in∣sisted upon a nicer discussion, which turned out very different from his expectations.</P>
<P>Titus Oates, who was the fountain of all this dreadful intelligence, was produced soon after, who, with seeming reluctance, came to give his intelligence. This man affirmed that he had fallen under the suspicion of the Jesuits, and that he had concealed himself, in order to avoid their resentment. This Titus Oates was an abandoned miscreant, obscure, illiterate, vulgar, and indigent. He had been once in∣dicted for perjury, was afterwards chaplain on board a man of war, and dismissed for unna∣tural practices. He then professed himself a Roman catholic, and crossed the sea to St. Omer's, where he was for some time main∣tained in the English seminary of that city. The fathers of that college sent him with some dispatches to Spain; but after his return, when they became better acquainted with his character, they would not suffer him to conti∣nue among them; so that he was obliged to
<PB N="410" REF="412"/>
return to London, where he was ready to en∣counter every danger for his support. At a time that he was supposed to have been en∣trusted with a secret involving the fate of kings, he was allowed to remain in such ne∣cessity, that Kirby was obliged to supply him with daily bread.</P>
<P>He had two methods to proceed, either to ingratiate himself by this information with the ministry, or to alarm the people, and thus turn their fears to his advantage. He chose the latter method. He went, therefore, with his two companions to Sir Edmondsbury Godfrey, a noted and active justice of peace, and before him deposed to a narrative dress∣ed up in terrors fit to make an impression on the vulgar. The pope, he said, considered himself as entitled to the possession of Eng∣land and Ireland, on account of the heresy of the prince and people, and had accordingly assumed the sovereignty of these kingdoms. This, which was saint Peter's patrimony, he had delivered up to the Jesuits, and Oliva, the general of that order, was his delegate. Se∣veral English catholic lords, whose names he mentioned, were appointed by the pope to the other offices of state; lord Arundel was cre∣ated chancellor, lord Powis treasurer, Sir Wil∣liam
<PB N="411" REF="413"/>
Godolphin privy-seal, Coleman, the duke's secretary, was made secretary of state, Lang∣horne attorney-general, lord Belasis general of the forces, lord Peters lieutenant-general, and lord Stafford pay-master. The king, whom the Jesuits called the Black Bastard, was solemnly tried by them, and condemned as an heretic. He asserted that father Le Shee, meaning the French king's confessor La Chaise, had offered ten thousand pounds to any man who should kill the king. Ten thousand pounds had been offered to Sir George Wakeman to poison him; but he was mercenary, and demanded fifteen thousand, which demand was complied with. Lest these means should fail, four Irish ruffians had been employed by the Jesuits at the rate of twenty guineas a piece to stab the king at Windsor. Colman, late secretary to the dutchess of York, was deeply involved in the plot, and had given a guinea to the mes∣senger, who carried them orders for the assas∣sination. Grove and Pickering, to make sure work, were employed to shoot the king, and that too with silver bullets. The former was to receive fifteen hundred pounds for his pains, and the latter, being a pious man, thirty thou∣sand masses. Pickering would have executed his purpose, had not the flint dropped out of
<PB N="412" REF="414"/>
his pistol at one time, and at another the prim∣ing. Oates went on to say that he himself was chiefly employed in carrying notes and letters among the Jesuits, all tending to the same end of murthering the king. A wager of an hun∣dred pound was made, and the money deposited, that the king should eat no more Christmass pyes. The great fire of London had been the work of the Jesuits; several other fires were resolv∣ed on, and a paper model was already framed for firing the city anew. Fire-balls were called among them Tewksbury mustard-pills. Twenty thousand catholics in London were prepared to rise; and Coleman had remitted two hun∣dred thousand pounds to assist the rebels in Ireland. The duke of York was to be of∣fered the crown in consequence of the success of these probable schemes, on condition of ex∣tirpating the protestant religion. Upon his re∣fusal <Q REND="inline">"To pot James must go,"</Q> as the Je∣suits were said to express it.</P>
<P>In consequence of this dreadful informa∣tion, sufficiently marked with absurdity, vul∣garity, and contradiction, Titus Oates became the favourite of the people, notwithstanding during his examination before the council, be so betrayed the grossness of his impostures, that he contradicted himself in every step of his
<PB N="413" REF="415"/>
narration. While in Spain he had been car∣ried, he said, to Don John, who promised great assistance to the execution of the catho∣lic designs. The king asked him what sort of a man his old acquaintance Don John was. Oates replied that he was a tall lean man, which was directly contrary to the truth, as the king well knew. Though he pretended great intimacies with Coleman, yet he knew him not when placed very near him, and had no other excuse but that his sight was bad by candle-light. He was guilty of the same mis∣take with regard to Sir George Wakeman.</P>
<P>But these improbabilities had no weight against the general wish, if I may so express it, that they should be true. The violent ani∣mosity which had been excited against the ca∣tholics in general, made the people find a gloomy pleasure in hoping for an opportunity of satiating their hatred. The more impro∣bable any account seemed, the more unlikely it was that any impostor should invent improba∣bilities, and therefore appeared more like truth.</P>
<P>A great number of the Jesuits mentioned by Oates were immediately taken into custody. Coleman, who was said to have acted so stre∣nuous a part in the conspiracy, at first retired; but next day surrendered himself to the secre∣tary
<PB N="414" REF="416"/>
of state, and some of his papers, by Oates's directions, were secured. These papers, which were such as might be naturally expected from a zealous catholic in his situation, were converted into very dangerous evidence against him. He had, without any doubt, maintained a close correspondence with the French king's confes∣sor, with the pope's nuncio at Brussels, and with many other catholics abroad, in which there was a distant project on foot for bring∣ing back popery upon the accession of the duke of York. But these letters contained nothing that served as proof in the present in∣formation; and their very silence in that respect, though they appeared imprudent enough in others, was a proof against Oates's pretended discovery. However, when the contents of those letters were publicly known, they diffused the panic which the former narrative had be∣gun. The two plots were brought to strength∣en each other, and confounded into one. Cole∣man's letters shewed there had actually been designs on foot, and Oates's narrative was sup∣posed to give the particulars.</P>
<P>In this fluctuation of passions, an accident served to confirm the prejudices of the peo∣ple, and to put it beyond a doubt that Oates's narrative was nothing but the truth. Sir Ed∣mondsbury
<PB N="415" REF="417"/>
Godfrey, who had been so active in unravelling the whole mystery of the po∣pish machinations, after having been missing some days, was found dead in a ditch by Primrose-hill, in the way to Hampstead. His own sword was thrust though his body; but no blood had flowed from the wound; so that it appeared he was dead some time before this method was taken to deceive the public. He had money in his pockets, and there was a broad livid mark quite round his neck, which was dislocated. The cause of his death re∣mains, and must still continue, a secret; but the people, already enraged against the papists, did not hesitate a moment to ascribe it to them. No farther doubt remained of Oates's vera∣city; the voice of the whole nation united against them; and the populace were exasper∣ated to such a degree, that moderate men be∣gan to dread a general massacre of that un∣happy sect. The body of Godfrey was car∣ried through the streets in procession, pre∣ceded by seventy clergymen; and every one who saw it made no doubt that his death could be only caused by the papists. Even the bet∣ter sort of people were infected with this vul∣gar prejudice; and such was the general con∣viction of popish guilt, that no person, with
<PB N="416" REF="418"/>
any regard to personal safety, could express the least doubt concerning the information of Oates, or the murther of Godfrey.</P>
<P>It only remained for the parliament to re∣press these delusions, and to bring back the people to calm and deliberate enquiry. But the parliament testified greater credulity than even the vulgar. The cry of plot was im∣mediately echoed from one house to the other; the country party would not let slip such an opportunity of managing the passions of the people; the courtiers were afraid of being thought disloyal, if they should doubt the in∣nocence of the pretended assassins of their king. Danby, the prime minister, himself en∣tered into it very furiously; and though the king told him that he had thus given the houses a handle to ruin himself, and to disturb the affairs of government, yet this minister persevered, till he found the king's prognostic but too true.</P>
<P>The king himself, whose safety was thus threatened and defended, was the only person who treated the plot with becoming contempt. He made several efforts for stifling an enquiry, which was likely to involve the kingdom in confusion, and must at any rate hurt his bro∣ther, who had more than once professed his re∣solution to defend the catholic religion.</P>
<P><PB N="417" REF="419"/>In order to continue and propagate the alarm, an address was voted for a solemn fast. It was requested that all papers tending to throw light upon so horrible a conspiracy might be laid before the house, that all papists should remove from London, that access should be denied at court to all unknown and suspicious persons, and that the train-bands in London and Westminster should be in readiness to march. They voted, after hearing Oates's evidence, that there was a damnable and hel∣lish plot, contrived and carried on by the po∣pish recusants, for assassinating and murdering the king, and for rooting out the protestant religion. Oates, who had acknowleged the ac∣cusations against his morals to be true, was, how∣ever, recommended by parliament to the king. He was lodged in Whitehall, and encouraged by a pension of twelve hundred pounds a-year to proceed in forging new informations.</P>
<P>The encouragement given to Oates did not fail to bring in others also, who hoped to profit by the delusion of the times William Bedloe, a man, if possible, more infamous than Oates, appeared next upon the stage. He was, like the former, of very low birth, had been noted for several cheats and thefts, had travelled over many parts of Europe under
<PB N="418" REF="420"/>
borrowed names, and had frequently passed himself for a man of quality. This man, at his own desire, was arrested at Bristol, and conveyed to London, where he declared be∣fore the council that he had seen the body of Sir Edmondsbury Godfrey at Somerset-house, where the queen lived. He said that a servant of lord Bellasis offered to give him four thou∣sand pounds if he would carry it off. He was questioned about the plot, but utterly de∣nied all knowlege of it, and also asserted that he had no acquaintance with Oates. Next day, however, he thought it would be better to share the emoluments of the plot, and he gave an ample account of it. This narrative he made to tally as well as he could with the in∣formation of Oates, which had been published; but to render it the more acceptable, he added some circumstances of his own, still more tre∣mendous, and still more absurd, than those of Oates. He said that ten thousand men were to be landed from Flanders in Burlington-bay, and were immediately to seize Hull. He affirmed that the lords Powis and Petre had undertaken to raise an army in Radnorshire; that fifty thousand men were ready to rise in London; that he himself had been tampered with to murder a <HI>man,</HI> and was to receive four thousand pounds
<PB N="419" REF="421"/>
for that service, beside the pope's blessing; that the king was to be assassinated, the pro∣testants butchered, and the kingdom offered to One, if he would consent to hold it of the church; if not, the pope should continue to govern without him. He likewise accused the lords Carrington and Brudenell, who were committed to custody by order of parliament. But the most terrible part of all was that Spain was to invade England with forty thou∣sand men, who were ready at St. Jago in the character of pilgrims; though at this time Spain was actually unable to raise ten thousand men to supply her own garrisons in Flanders.</P>
<P>These narrations carry their own refutation; the infamy of the witnesses, the contradiction in their testimony, the improbability of it, the low vulgarity of the information, unlike what men trusted with great affairs would be apt to form, all these serve to raise our horror against these base villians, and our pity at the delusion of the times that could credit such reports. In order to give a confident air to the discovery, Bedloe published a pamphlet, with this title. <Q REND="inline">"A Narrative and impartial Discovery of the horrid Popish Plot, carried on for the burning and destroying the Cities of London and West∣minster, with their suburbs, &amp;c. by Captain
<PB N="420" REF="422"/>
William Bedloe, lately engaged in that horrid design, and one of the Popish committees for carrying on such fires."</Q> The papists were thus become so obnoxious, that vote after vote passed against them in the house of commons. They were called idolaters; and such as did not concur in acknowleging the truth of the epi∣thet, were expelled the house without ceremo∣ny. Even the duke of York was permitted to keep his place in the house by a majority of only two.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I would not, said one of the lords, have so much as a popish man or a popish woman to remain here, not so much as a popish dog, or a popish bitch, not so much as a popish cat to mew, or pur about our king."</Q>
This was wretched eloquence; but it was admirably suited to the times.</P>
<P>Encouraged by the general voice in their favour, the witnesses, who all along had en∣larged their narratives, in proportion as they were greedily received, went a step farther, and ventured to accuse the queen. The com∣mons, in an address to the king, gave counten∣ance to this scandalous accusation; the lords rejected it with becoming disdain. The king received the news of it with his usual good humour.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They think, said he, that I have a mind to a new wife; but for all that I will
<PB N="421" REF="423"/>
not suffer an innocent woman to be abused."</Q>
He immediately ordered Oates to be strictly confined, seized his papers, and dismissed his servants. But his favour with parliament soon procured his release.</P>
<P>Edward Coleman, secretary to the duke of York, was the first who was brought to trial, as being most obnoxious to those who pretended to fear the introduction of popery. His letters were produced against him. They plainly testified a violent zeal for the catholic cause, and that alone at present was sufficient to con∣vict him. But Oates and Bedloe came in to make his condemnation sure. The former swore that he had sent fourscore guineas to a ruffian, who undertook to kill the king. The date of the transaction he fixed in the month of August, but would not fix the particular day. Coleman could have proved that he was in the country the greatest part of that month, and therefore the witness would not be parti∣cular. Bedloe swore that he had received a commission, signed by the superior of the Jesuits, appointing him papal secretary of state, and that he had consented to the king's assassination. After this unfortunate man's sentence, thus procured by these vipers, many members of both houses offered to interpose in his behalf, if he would make an ample con∣fession;
<PB N="422" REF="424"/>
but as he was, in reality, possessed of no treasonable secrets, he would not procure life by falsehood and imposture. He suffered with calmness and constancy, and to the last persisted in the strongest protestations of his innocence.</P>
<P>The trial of Coleman was succeeded by those of Ireland, Pickering, and Grove. Ireland, a Jesuit, was accused by Oates and Bedloe, the only witnesses against him, that he was one of the fifty Jesuits who had signed the great re∣solve against the king. Ireland affirmed, and proved, that he was in Staffordshire all the month of August, a time when Oates asserted he was in London. The jury brought him in guilty, and the judge commended their verdict. It was in the same manner sworn that Picker∣ing and Grove had bound themselves by an oath to assassinate the king; that they had pro∣vided themselves with screwed pistols and sil∣ver bullets. They both protested their inno∣cence, and were found guilty. All these un∣happy men went to execution protesting their innocence, a circumstance which made no im∣pression on the spectators; their being Jesuits banished even pity from their sufferings.</P>
<P>The animosities of the people, however, seemed a little appeased by the execution of
<PB N="423" REF="425"/>
these four; but a new train of evidence was now discovered, that kindled the flame once more. One Miles Prance, a goldsmith, and a professed Roman catholic, had been accused by Bedloe of being an accomplice in Sir Edmondsbury's murder; and, upon his denial, had been load∣ed with heavy irons, and thrown into the condemned hole, a place cold, dark, and noi∣some. There the poor wretch lay groaning and exclaiming that he was not guilty; but being next day carried before Lord Shaftesbu∣ry, and there threatened with severer punish∣ment in case of obstinacy, he demanded if a confession would procure his pardon. Being assured of that, he had no longer courage to resist, but confessed himself an accomplice in Godfrey's murder. He soon after, however, retracted his evidence before the king; but the same rigours being employed against him, he was induced once more to confirm his first infor∣mation. The murder he said was committed in Somerset-house, by the contrivance of Gerrard and Kelly, two Irish priests. That Lawrence Hill, footman to the queen's treasurer, Robert Green, cushion-keeper to her chapel, and Henry Berry, porter of the palace, followed Sir Edmondsbury at a distance, from ten in the morning till seven in the evening; but that
<PB N="424" REF="426"/>
passing by Somerset-house, Green throwing a twisted handkerchief over his head, he was soon strangled, and the body carried to a high chamber in Somerset-house, from whence it was removed to another apartment, where it was seen by Bedloe.</P>
<P>Hill, Green, and Berry, were tried upon this evidence, though Bedloe's narrative, and Prance's information, were totally irreconcile∣able, and though their testimony was invalidat∣ed by contrary evidence, all was in vain, the prisoners were condemned and executed. They all denied their guilt at execution; and as Berry died a protestant this circumstance was regarded as very considerable. But instead of stopping the torrent of credulity, it only encreas∣ed the people's animosity against a protestant, who could at once be guilty of a popish plot, of murder, and of denying it in his last mo∣ments.</P>
<P>This frightful persecution continued for some time; and the king, contrary to his own judgment, was obliged to give way to the popular fury. Whitebread, provincial of the Jesuits, Fenwick, Gavan, Turner, and Har∣court, all of them of the same order, were brought to their trial: Langhorne soon after. Besides Oates and Bedloe, Dugdale, a new wit∣ness,
<PB N="425" REF="427"/>
appeared against the prisoners. This man spread the alarm still farther, and even asserted, that two hundred thousand papists in England were ready to take arms. The pri∣soners proved, by sixteen witnesses from St. Omers, that Oates was in that seminary at the time he swore he was in London. But as they were papists, their testimony could gain no manner of credit. All pleas availed them nothing; both the Jesuits and Lang∣horne were condemned and executed, with their last breath denying the crimes for which they died.</P>
<P>The informers had less success on the trial of Sir George Wakeman, the queen's physi∣cian, who, though they swore with their usual animosity, was acquitted. His condemnation would have involved the queen in his guilt; and it is propable the judge and jury were afraid of venturing so far.</P>
<P>The earl of Stafford, near two years after, was the last man that fell a sacrifice to these bloody wretches; the witnesses produced a∣gainst him were Oates, Dugdale, and Tuber∣ville. Oates swore that he saw Fenwick, the Jesuit, deliver Stafford a commission from the general of the Jesuits, constituting him pay-master of the papal army. Dugdale gave
<PB N="426" REF="428"/>
testimony that the prisoner had endeavoured to engage him in the design of murdering the king. Turberville affirmed, that the prisoner, in his own house at Paris, had made him the same proposal. The clamour and out-rage of the populace against the prisoner was very great; he was found guilty and condemned to be hanged and quartered; but the king changed the sentence into that of beheading. He was executed on Tower-hill, where even his persecutors could not forbear shedding tears at that serene fortitude which shone in every feature, motion, and accent of this aged nobleman. Some other lords, who were taken up and imprisoned upon the former evidence, were tried and acquitted some time after, when the people began to recover from their phrenzy.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1679" UNIT="A.D."/> But while these prosecutions were going for∣ward, raised by the credulity of the people, and seconded by the artifice of the parliament, other designs equally vindictive, were carried on. The lord treasurer Danby was impeached in the house of commons, by Seymour his ene∣my. The principal charge against him was, his having written a letter to Montague, the king's ambassador at Paris, directing him to sell the king's good offices at the treaty of Nimeguen,
<PB N="427" REF="429"/>
to the king of France for a certain sum of money; contrary to the general interests of the confederates, and even those of his own kingdoms. This was a charge he could not deny; and though the king was more culpa∣ble than the minister, yet the prosecution was carried on against him with vigour. But he had the happiness to find the king resolved to defend him. Charles assured the parliament, that as he had acted in every thing by his or∣ders, he held him as entirely blameless; and though he would deprive him of all his employ∣ments, yet he would positively insist on his per∣sonal safety. The lords were obliged to sub∣mit; however they went on to impeach him, and Danby was sent to the Tower, but no worse consequences ensued.</P>
<P>These furious proceedings had been all car∣ried on by an house of commons that had now continued undissolved for above seventeen years; the king, therefore, was resolved to try a new one, which he knew could not be more unmanageable than the former. However, the new parliament did not in the least abate of the activity and ob∣stinacy of their predecessors. The king, indeed, changed his council, by the advice of Sir William Temple, and admitted into it several of both parties, by which he hoped to appease his op∣ponents;
<PB N="428" REF="430"/>
but the antipathy to popery had taken too fast a possession of men's minds, to be removed by so feeble a remedy. This house resolved to strike at the root of the evil, which threatened them from a popish successor; and, after some deliberations a bill was brought in for the total exclusion of the duke of York from the crown of England and Ireland. It was by that intended, that the sovereignty of these kingdoms, upon the king's death or re∣signation, should devolve to the person next in succession to the duke; and that all acts of royalty, which that prince should afterwards perform, should not only be void, but deemed treason. This important bill passed the lower house, by a majority of seventy nine.</P>
<P>Nor did their efforts rest here, the com∣mons voted the king's standing army and guards to be illegal. They proceeded to esta∣blish limits to the king's power of imprisoning delinquents at will. It was now that the ce∣lebrated statute, called the Habeas Corpus act, was passed, which confirms the subject in an ab∣solute security from oppressive power. By this act, it was prohibited to send any one to prisons beyond the sea: no judge, under severe penal∣ties, was to refuse to any prisoner his writ of
<PB N="429" REF="431"/>
habeas corpus; by which the gaoler was to pro∣duce in court the body of the prisoner, whence the writ had its name, and to certify the cause of his detainer and imprisonments. If the goal lie within twenty miles of the judge, the writ must be obeyed in three days, and so propor∣tionably for greater distances. Every prisoner must be indicted the first term of his commit∣ment, and brought to trial the subsequent term. And no man after being enlarged by court, can be recommitted for the same of∣fence.</P>
<P>This law alone, would have been sufficient to endear the parliament that made it to poste∣rity; and it would have been well if they had rested there. The duke of York had retired to Brussels during these troubles; but an in∣disposition of the king led him back to Eng∣land, to be ready, in case of any sinister acci∣dent, to assert his right to the throne. After prevailing upon his brother to disgrace the duke of Monmouth, a natural son of the king's, by one Mrs. Waters, and now become very popular, he himself retired to Scotland, under pretence of still quieting the apprehensions of the English nation; but in reality, to streng∣then his interests there. This secession served
<PB N="430" REF="432"/>
still more to enflame the country party, who were strongly attached to the duke of Mon∣mouth, and were resolved to support him against the duke of York. Mobs, petitions, pope burnings, were artifices employed to keep up the terrors of popery, and alarm the court. The parliament had shewn favour to the va∣rious tribes of informers, and that served to encrease the number of these miscreants; but plots themselves also became more numerous. Plot was set up against plot; and the people kept still suspended in dreadful apprehen∣sion.</P>
<P>The Meal-Tub Plot, as it was called, was brought forward to the public on this occasion. One Dangerfield, more infamous, if possible, than Oates and Bedloe, a wretch who had been set in the pillory, scourged, branded, and transported for felony and coining, hatched a plot in conjunction with a midwife, whose name was Cellier, a Roman catholic, of aban∣doned character. Dangerfield began by de∣claring, that there was a design on foot to set up a new form of government, and remove the king and the royal family. He commu∣nicated this intelligence to the king and the duke of York, who supplied him with money,
<PB N="431" REF="433"/>
and countenanced his discovery. He hid some seditious papers in the lodgings of one colo∣nel Mansel; and then brought the custom-house officers to his apartment, to search for smuggled merchandize. The papers were found, and the council having examined the affair, concluded they were forged by Dan∣gerfield. They ordered all the places he fre∣quented to be searched; and in the house of Cellier, the whole scheme of the conspiracy was discovered upon paper, concealed in a meal-tub, from whence the plot had its name. Dangerfield being committed to Newgate, made an ample confession of the forgery, which, though probably entirely of his own contrivance, he ascribed to the earl of Castle∣main, the countess of Powis, and the five lords in the Tower. He said that the design was to suborn witnesses to prove a charge of so∣domy and perjury upon Oates, to assassinate the earl of Shaftesbury, to accuse the dukes of Monmouth and Buckingham, the earls of Essex, Hallifax and others, of having been concerned in the conspiracy against the king and his brother. Upon this information, the earl of Castlemain and the countess of Powis were sent to the Tower, and the king him∣self
<PB N="423" REF="434"/>
was suspected of encouraging this impos∣ture.</P>
<P>But it was not by plots alone the adverse parties endeavoured to supplant each other. Tumultuous petitions on the one hand, and flattering addresses on the other, were sent up from all quarters. Wherever the country party prevailed, petitions filled with grie∣vances and apprehensions, were sent to the king with an air of humble insolence. Where∣ever the church, or the court party prevailed, addresses were framed, containing expressions of the highest regard to his majesty, and the deepest <HI>abhorrence</HI> of those who endeavoured to disturb the public tranquility. Thus the nation came to be distinguished into <HI>Petitioners</HI> and <HI>Abhorrers.</HI> Whig and Tory also were first used as terms of mutual reproach at this time. The Whigs, were so denominated from a cant name given to the sour Scotch conven∣ticlers, (Whig being milk turned sour.) The Tories were denominated from the Irish ban∣ditti so called, whose usual manner of bidding people deliver, was by the Irish word Toree, or give me.</P>
<P>As this parliament seemed even to surpass the former in jealousy and resentment, the king was induced to dissolve it; and could willing∣ly
<PB N="433" REF="435"/>
have never applied to another. But his ne∣cessities, caused by his want of oeconomy, and his numberless needy dependents, obliged him to call another. However every change seemed only to inflame the evil; <MILESTONE N="1680" UNIT="A.D."/> and his new parlia∣ment seemed willing to out do even their pre∣decessors. Every step they took, betrayed that zeal with which they were animated. They voted the legality of petitioning to the king; they fell with extreme violence on the Abhor∣rers, who; in their addresses to the crown, had expressed their disapprobation of those peti∣tions. Great numbers of these were seized by their order, from all parts of England, and committed to close custody: the liberty of the subject, which had been so carefully guarded by their own recent law, was every day violated by their arbitrary and capricious commitments. One Stowel of Exeter, was the person that put a stop to their proceedings; he refused to obey the serjeant at arms, who was sent to apprehend him; he stood upon his defence, and said he knew no law by which they pretended to commit him. The house, finding it equally dangerous to proceed or to recede, got off by an evasion. They in∣serted in their votes, that Stowel was indispos∣ed; and a month's time was allowed him for his recovery. It is happy for the nation, that
<PB N="434" REF="436"/>
should the commons at any time overleap the bounds of their authority, and order men ca∣priciously to be committed to prison; there is no power, in case of resistance, that can compel the prisoner to submit to their decrees.</P>
<P>But the chief point which the commons la∣boured to obtain, was the <HI>Exclusion Bill,</HI> which, though the former house had voted, was never passed into a law. Shaftesbury, and many con∣siderable men of the party, had rendered them∣selves so obnoxious to the duke of York, that they could find safety in no measure but his his ruin. Monmouth's friends hoped that the ex∣clusion of James would make room for their own patron. The duke of York's professed bigotry to the catholic superstition influenced numbers; and his tyrannies, which were practised without con∣troul, while he continued in Scotland, rendered his name odious to thousands. In a week, there∣fore, after the commencement of the sessions, a motion was made for bringing in an exclu∣sion bill, and a committee was appointed for that purpose. The debates were carried on with great violence on both sides; the bill was defended by lord Russel, who had now resign∣ed his office of attorney general, by Sir Wil∣liam Jones, Sir Francis Winnington, Sir Harry Capel, Sir William Pultney, colonel Titus,
<PB N="435" REF="437"/>
Treby, Hambden, and Montague. It was op∣posed by Sir Leoline Jenkins, secretary of state, Sir John Ernely, chancellor of the ex∣chequer; by Hyde, Seymour, and Temple: the bill passed by a great majority in the house of commons, but was opposed in the house of peers with better success. Shaftesbury, Sunderland, and Essex, argued for it. Halifax chiefly conducted the arguments against it. The king was present during the whole debate; and had the pleasure of seeing the bill thrown out by a very great majority. All the bishops, ex∣cept three, voted against it; for they were of opinion that the church of England was in much greater danger from the prevalence of presbyterianism, than of popery.</P>
<P>The commons were extremely mortified and enraged at the rejection of their favourite bill; and to shew how strongly they resented the indulgence which was shewn to popery, they passed a bill for easing the protestant dis∣senters, and for repealing such acts as tended to their persecution. They proceeded to bring in bills, which, though contributing to secure the liberty of the subject, yet probably at that period only calculated to excite them to insurrection. They had thoughts of renewing the triennial act; of continuing the judges in their
<PB N="436" REF="438"/>
offices during good behaviour; of ordering an association for the defence of his majesty's per∣son, and the security of the protestant religion. They voted, that till the exclusion bill was passed, they could not, consistent with the trust reposed in them, grant the king any man∣ner of supply; and to prevent his taking other methods to get money, they voted that who∣ever should hereafter lend, by way of advance, any money upon any branches of the king's revenue, should be responsible to parliament for his conduct. The king, therefore, finding that there were no hopes of extorting either money or obedience from the commons, came to a resolution of once more dissolving the parliament. His usher of the black rod ac∣cordingly came to dissolve them, while they were voting that the dissenters should be en∣couraged, and that the papists had burned the city of London.</P>
<P>The parliament thus dissolved, it was con∣sidered as a doubt, whether the king would ever call another: however, the desire he had of being supplied with money, surmounted his fears from every violence a parliament might offer. But it had always been supposed that the neighbourhood of London, at once both potent and factious, was an improper place
<PB N="437" REF="439"/>
for assembling a parliament that would be stedfast in the king's interests; he therefore re∣solved at once to punish the Londoners, by shewing his suspicions of their loyalty; and to reward the inhabitants of Oxford, by bringing down his parliament to that city. Accord∣ingly a parliament was ordered to assemble at Oxford,<MILESTONE N="1681" UNIT="A.D."/> and measures taken on both sides to engage the partizans to be strenuous in their resolutions. In this, as in all former parlia∣ments, the country party predominated: the parliamentary leaders came to that city, attend∣ed not only by their servants but with numer∣ous bands of their retainers. The four Lon∣don members were followed by great multi∣tudes, wearing ribbons, in which were woven these words, <Q REND="inline">"No Popery! No Slavery!"</Q> The king was not behind them in the num∣ber and formidable appearance of his guards; so that the parliament rather bore the appear∣ance of a military congress, than of a civil as∣sembly.</P>
<P>This parliament trod exactly in the steps of the former. The commons having chosen the same speaker, who filled the chair last par∣liament, ordered the votes to be printed every day, that the public might be acquainted with the subject of their deliberations. The bill
<PB N="438" REF="440"/>
of exclusion was more fiercely urged than ever. Ernely, one of the king's ministers, proposed that the duke should be banished during life, five hundred miles from England; and that upon the king's death, the next heir should be constituted regent with regal power. Yet even this expedient, which left the duke the bare title of king, could not obtain the atten∣tion of the house. Nothing but a total exclu∣sion could satisfy them.</P>
<P>Each party had now for some time reviled and ridiculed each other in pamphlets and libels; and this practice, at last, was attended with an incident, that deserves notice. One Fitzharris, an Irish papist, dependent on the dutchess of Portsmouth, one of the king's mistresses, used to supply her with these occa∣sional publications. But he was resolved to add to their number by his own endeavours; and employed one Everhard, a Scotchman, to write a libel against the king and the duke of York. The Scot was actually a spy for the opposite party; and supposing this a trick to entrap him, he discovered the whole to Sir William Waller, an eminent justice of peace; and to convince him of the truth of his infor∣mation, posted him, and two other persons, privately, where they heard the whole confer∣ence
<PB N="439" REF="441"/>
between Fitzharris and himself. The libel composed between them was replete with the utmost rancour and scurrility. Waller carried the intelligence to the king, and ob∣tained a warrant for committing Fitzharris, who happened at that very time to have a copy of the libel in his pocket. Seeing himself in the hands of a party, from which he ex∣pected no mercy, he resolved to side with them, and throw the odium of the libel upon the court, who, he said, were willing to draw up a libel, which, should be imputed to the ex∣clusioners, and thus render them hateful to the people. He enchanced his services with the country party, by a new popish plot, still more tremendous than any of the forego∣ing. He brought in the duke of York as a principal accomplice in this plot, and as a contriver in the murder of Sir Edmondsbury Godfrey.</P>
<P>The king imprisoned Fitzharris; the com∣mons avowed his cause. They voted that he should be impeached by themselves, to screen him from the ordinary forms of justice; the lords rejected the impeachment; the commons asserted their right; a commotion was likely to ensue; and the king, to break off the con∣test, went to the house, and dissolved the par∣liament,
<PB N="440" REF="442"/>
with a fixed resolution never to call another.</P>
<P>This vigorous measure was a blow that the parliament had never expected; and nothing but the necessity of the times could have justi∣fied the king's manner of proceeding. From that moment, which ended the parliamentary commotions, Charles seemed to rule with despotic power; and he was resolved to leave the succession to his brother, but clogged with all the faults and misfortunes of his own ad∣ministration. His temper, which had always been easy and merciful, now became arbitrary, and even cruel; he entertained spies and infor∣mers round the throne, and imprisoned all such as he thought most daring in their designs.</P>
<P>He resolved to humble the presbyterians; these were divested of their employments and their places; and their offices given to such as held with the court, and approved the doc∣trine of non-resistance. The clergy began to testify their zeal and their principles by their writings and their sermons; but though among these, the partizans of the king were the most numerous, those of the opposite faction were the most enterprizing. The king openly es∣poused the cause of the former; and thus pla∣cing himself at the head of a faction, he de∣prived
<PB N="441" REF="443"/>
the city of London, which had long headed the popular party, of their charter. It was not till after an abject submission that he restored it to them, having previously subjected the election of their magistrates to his imme∣diate authority.</P>
<P>Terrors also were not wanting to confirm this new species of monarchy. Fitzharris was brought to his trial before a jury, and condem∣ned, and executed. The whole gang of spies, witnesses, informers, suborners, which had long been encouraged and supported by the leading patriots, finding now that the king was entire∣ly master, they turned short upon their ancient drivers, and offered their evidence against those who had first put them in motion. The king's ministers, with an horrid satisfaction, gave them countenance and encouragement; so that soon the same cruelties, and the same injustice, was practised against presbyte∣rian schemes, that had been employed against catholic treasons.</P>
<P>The first person that fell under the displea∣sure of the ministry, was one Stephen College, a London joiner, who had become so noted for his jeal against popery, that he went by the name of the Protestant Joiner. He had attend∣ed the city members to Oxford, armed with
<PB N="442" REF="444"/>
sword and pistol; he had sometimes been heard to speak irreverently of the king, and was now presented by the grand jury of Lon∣don as guilty of sedition. The sheriffs of London were in strong opposition to the court; and the grand jury, named by them, rejected the bill against College. However, the court were not to be foiled so; they sent the prisoner to Oxford, where the treason was said to have been committed, and there tried before a partial judge, and a packed jury. He was accused by Dugdale, Turberville, and others, who had already given evidence against the catholics; and the nation saw themselves reduced to a ridiculous dilemna upon their testimony. The jury, who were royalists, could not accept their evidence, as they believ∣ed them, to be abandoned liars, nor yet could they rejct it, as they were taught by their opponents to think them sufficient evidence for conviction. College defended himself with great presence of mind, and invalidated all their testimonies. But all was in vain. The jury, after half an hour's deliberation, brought him in guilty, and the spectators testi∣fied their inhuman pleasure, with a shout of applause. He bore his fate with unshaken fortitude; and at the place of execution de∣nied
<PB N="443" REF="445"/>
the crime for which he had been con∣demned.</P>
<P>But higher vengeance was demanded by the king, whose resentment was chiefly level∣led against the earl of Shaftesbury, and not without reason. No sums were spared to seek for evidence, and even to suborn witnesses a∣gainst this intriguing and formidable man. A bill of indictment being presented to the grand jury, witnesses were examined, who swore to such incredible circumstances, as must have invalidated their testimony, even if they had not been branded as perjured villains. Among his papers, indeed, a draught of an association was found, which might have been construed into treason; but it was not in the earl's hand writing, nor could his adversaries prove that he had ever communicated this scheme to any body, or signified his approbation of any such project. The sheriffs had summon∣ed a jury, whose principles coincided with those of the earl, and that probably, more than any want of proof, procured his safety.</P>
<P>The power of the crown by this time be∣came irresistible,<MILESTONE N="1683" UNIT="A.D."/> the city of London having been deprived of their charter, which was res∣tored only upon terms of submission, and the giving up the nomination of their own ma∣gistrates
<PB N="444" REF="446"/>
was so mortifying a circumstance, that all the other corporations in England soon began to fear the same treatment, and were, successively induced to surrender their charters into the hands of the king. Consider∣able sums were exacted for restoring these charters and all the offices of power and pro∣fit were left at the disposal of the crown. Re∣sistance now, however justifiable, could not be safe; and all prudent men saw no other expe∣dient, but peaceably submiting to the present grievances. But there was a party in England that still cherished their former ideas of free∣dom, and were resolved to hazard every dan∣ger in its defence.</P>
<P>This, like all other combinations, was made up of men, some guided by principle to the subversion of the present despotic power, some by interest, and still many more by re∣venge. Some time before, in the year 1681, the king had been seized with a fit of sickness at Windsor, which gave a great alarm to the pub∣lic. Shaftesbury had even then attempted to ex∣clude the duke of York from the succession, and united with the duke of Monmouth, lord Russel, and lord Grey, in case of the king's death, they conspired to rise in arms, and vindicate their opi∣nions by the sword. Shaftesbury's imprisonment and trial for some time put a stop to these designs;
<PB N="445" REF="447"/>
but they soon revived with his release. Mon∣mouth engaged the earl of Macclesfield, lord Brandon, Sir Gilbert Gerrard, and other gentle∣men in Cheshire. Lord Russel fixed a corre∣spondence with Sir William Courtney, Sir Francis Rowles, and Sir Francis Drake, who promised to raise the West. Shaftesbury, with one Ferguson, an independent clergyman, and a restless plotter, managed the city, upon which the confederates chiefly relied. It was now that this turbulent man found his schemes most likely to take effect. After the disap∣pointment and destruction of an hundred plots, he at last began to be sure of this. But this scheme, like all the former, was disap∣pointed. The caution of lord Russel, who in∣duced the duke of Monmouth to put off the enterprize, saved the kingdom from the hor∣rors of a civil war; while Shaftesbury was so struck with a sense of his impending danger that he left his house, and lurking about the city attempted, but in vain, to drive the Londoners into open insurrection. At last, enraged at the numberless cautions and delays which clogged and defeated his projects, he threatened to begin with his friends alone. However after a long strug∣gle between fear and rage, he abandoned all hopes of success, and fled out of the kingdom to
<PB N="446" REF="448"/>
Amsterdam, where he ended his turbulent life soon after, without being pitied by his friends, or feared by his enemies.</P>
<P>The loss of Shaftesbury, though it retarded the views of the conspirators, did not suppress them. A council of six was erected, consist∣ing of Monmouth, Russel, Essex, Howard, Algernon Sidney, and John Hambden, grand∣son to the great man of that name. These corresponded with Argyle and the malcon∣tents in Scotland, and resolved to prosecute the scheme of the insurrection, though they widely differed in principles from each other. Monmouth aspired at the crown; Russel and Hambden proposed to exclude the duke of York from the succession, and redress the grievances of the nation; Sidney was for re∣storing the republic, and Essex joined in the same wish. Lord Howard was an abandoned man, who, having no principles, sought to embroil the nation, to gratify his private in∣terest in the confusion.</P>
<P>Such were the leaders of this conspiracy, and such their motives. But there was also a set of subordinate conspirators, who frequently met together, and carried on projects quite unknown to Monmouth and his council. Among these men was colonel Rumsey, an
<PB N="447" REF="449"/>
old republican officer, together with lieutenant-colonel Walcot of the same stamp, Goodenough, under-sheriff of London, a zealous and noted par∣ty-man, Ferguson, an independent minister, and several attornies, merchants, and tradesmen of London. But Rumsey and Ferguson were the only persons that had access to the great lead∣ers of the conspiracy. These men in their meetings embraced the most desperate resolu∣tions. They proposed to assassinate the king in his way to Newmarket; Rumbal, one of the party, possessed a farm upon that road called the Rye-house, and from thence the conspiracy was denominated the Rye-house Plot. They deliberated upon a scheme of stopping the king's coach by overturning a cart on the high-way at this place, and shoot∣ing him through the hedges. The house in which the king lived at Newmarket took fire accidentally, and he was obliged to leave New∣market eight days sooner than was expected, to which circumstance his safety was ascribed.</P>
<P>Among the conspirators was one Keiling, who finding himself in danger of a prosecu∣tion for arresting the lord-mayor of London, resolved to earn his pardon by discovering this plot to the ministry. Colonel Rumsey, and West, a lawyer, no sooner understood
<PB N="448" REF="450"/>
that this man had informed against them, than they agreed to save their lives by turning king's evidence, and they surrendered themselves ac∣cordingly. Sheppard, another conspirator, being apprehended, confessed all he knew, and general orders were soon issued out for apprehending the rest of the leaders of the conspiracy. Monmouth absconded; Russel was sent to the Tower; Grey escaped; Howard was taken concealed in a chimney; Essex, Sidney, and Hambden, were soon after arrested, and had the mor∣tification to find lord Howard an evidence against them.</P>
<P>Walcot was first brought to trial and con∣demned, together with Hone and Rouse, two associates in the conspiracy, upon the evidence of Rumsey, West, and Sheppard. They died penitent, acknowledging the justice of the sentence by which they were executed. A much greater sacrifice was shortly after to fol∣low. This was the lord Russel, son of the earl of Bedford, a nobleman of numberless good qualities, and led into this conspiracy from a conviction of the duke of York's in∣tentions to restore popery. He was liberal, popular, humane, and brave. All his virtues were so many crimes in the present suspicious dis∣position of the court. The chief evidence against
<PB N="449" REF="451"/>
him was lord Howard, a man of very bad character, one of the conspirators, who was now contented to take life upon such terms, and to accept of infamous safety. This wit∣ness swore that Russel was engaged in the de∣sign of an insurrection; but he acquitted him, as did also Rumsey and West, of being privy to the assassination. His own candour would not allow him to deny the design in which he really was concerned; but his own confession was not sufficient to convict him. To the fact which principally aimed at his life there was but one witness, and the law required two; this was over ruled; for justice, during this whole reign, was too weak for the prevailing party. The jury, who were zealous royalists, after a short deliberation brought the prisoner in guilty. After his condemnation the king was strongly sollicited in his favour. Even money, to the amount of two hundred thou∣sand pounds, was offered to the dutchess of Portsmouth, by the old earl of Bedford, lord Russel's father. The king was inexorable. He dreaded the principles and popularity of this nobleman, and resented his former activity in promoting the bill of exclusion. Lord Ca∣vendish, the intimate friend of Russel, offered to effect his escape by exchanging apparel
<PB N="450" REF="452"/>
with him, and remaining a prisoner in his room. The duke of Monmouth sent a mes∣sage to him, offering to surrender himself, if he thought that step would contribute to his safety. Lord Russel generously rejected both these expedients, and resigned himself to his fate with admirable fortitude. His consort, the daughter and heiress of the earl of South∣ampton, finding that all supplications were vain, took leave of her husband without shed∣ding a tear; while, as he parted from her, he turned to those about him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Now, said he, the bitterness of death is over."</Q>
A little before the sheriffs conducted him to the scaf∣fold, he wound up his watch.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have now, done with time, said he, and must hence∣forth think of eternity."</Q>
The scaffold for his execution was erected in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields; he laid his head on the block without the least change of countenance, and at two strokes it was severed from his body.</P>
<P>The celebrated Algernon Sidney, son to the earl of Leicester, was next brought to his trial. He had been formerly engaged in the parliamentary army against the late king, and was even named on the high court of justice that tried him, but had not taken his seat among the judges. He had ever opposed Cromwell's
<PB N="451" REF="453"/>
usurpation, and went into voluntary banish∣ment upon the restoration. His affairs, however, requiring his return, he applied to the king for a pardon, and obtained his request. But all his hopes and all his reasonings were formed upon republican principles. For his adored republic he had written and fought, and went into banishment, and ventured to return. It may easily be conceived how obnoxious a man of such principles was to a court that now was not even content with limitations to its power. They went so far as to take illegal methods to procure his condemnation. The only witness that deposed against Sidney was lord Howard, and the law required two. In order, therefore, to make out a second witness, they had recourse to a very extraordinary ex∣pedient. In ransacking his closet, some dis∣courses on government were found in his own hand writing, containing principles favourable to liberty, and in themselves no way subver∣sive of a limited government. By overstrain∣ing some of these they were construed in∣to treason. It was in vain he alledged that papers were no evidence; that it could not be proved they were written by him; that, if proved, the papers themselves contained nothing criminal. His defence was over∣ruled;
<PB N="452" REF="454"/>
the violent and inhuman Jefferies, who was now chief-justice, easily prevailed on a partial jury to bring him in guilty, and his execution followed soon after. One can scarce contemplate the transactions of this reign with∣out horror. Such a picture of factious guilt on each side, a court at once immersed in sensuality and blood, a people armed against each other with the most deadly animosity, and no single party to be found with sense enough to stem the general torrent of rancour and factious suspicion.</P>
<P>Hambden was tried soon after; and as there was nothing to affect his life, he was fined forty thousand pounds. Holloway, a merchant of Bristol, who had fled to the West-Indies, was brought over, condemned, and executed. Sir Thomas Armstrong also, who had fled to Hol∣land, was brought over, and shared the same fate. Lord Essex, who had been imprisoned in the Tower, was found in an apartment with his throat cut; but whether he was guilty of suicide, or whether the bigotry of the times might not have induced some assassin to com∣mit the crime, cannot now be known.</P>
<P>This was the last blood that was shed for an imputation of plots or conspiracies, which con∣tinued during the greatest part of this reign.
<PB N="453" REF="455"/>
Nevertheless the cruelty, and the gloomy sus∣picion of the duke of York, who, since the dissolution of the last parliament, daily came into power, was dreadful to the nation. Titus Oates was fined an hundred thousand pounds, for calling him a popish traitor, and he was im∣prisoned till he could pay it, which he was ut∣terly incapable of. A like illegal sentence was passed upon Dutton Colt for the same offence. Sir Samuel Barnardiston was fined ten thousand pounds, for having, in some private letters, re∣flected on the government. Of all those who were concerned in the late conspiracy, scarce one escaped the severity of the court, except the duke of Monmouth, and he was the most culpable of any.</P>
<P>At this period, the government of Charles was as absolute as that of any monarch in Europe; but to please his subjects by an act of populari∣ty, he judged it proper to marry the lady Anne, his niece, to prince George, brother to the king of Denmark. This was the last transaction of this extraordinary reign. The king was seized with a sudden fit, which resembled an apoplexy; and though he was recovered from it by bleeding, yet he languished only for a few days, and then expired, in the fifty-ninth year of his age, and the twenty-fifth of his reign. During his ill∣ness,
<PB N="445" REF="456"/>
some clergymen of the church of Eng∣land attended him, to whom he discovered a total indifference. Catholic priests were brought to his bed-side, and from their hands he receiv∣ed the rites of their communion. Two papers were found in his closet, containing arguments in favour of that persuasion. These were soon after published by James his successor, by which he greatly injured his own popularity, and his brother's memory.</P>
