<P>A WIFE IN THE RIGHT: A COMEDY.</P>
<P>BY MRS. GRIFFITH.</P>
<P>LONDON: PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR, And sold by Mess. E. and C. DILLY, in the Poultry, J. ROBSON, New Bond-street, and J. WALTER, at Charing Cross. M.DCC.LXXII.</P>

<PB REF="2"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of this Address is so per∣fectly sensible of how little conse∣quence such writings are to the public, that she would most willingly have declined troubling them on this occasion, were she not impelled to it by two very strong motives; a desire of vindicating herself from some of the charges brought against the following co∣medy, from the interpolations thrown into one of the principal parts, on the night of per∣formance; and the earnest wish of expressing the sincere gratitude she is sensible of to the public in general, and to her friends in parti∣cular, for the generous patronage they have shewn towards the publication of this little piece, which with true humility and diffi∣dence she now submits to their candor and indulgence.</P>
<P>The author certainly had no reason to have apprehended the unlucky event of this comedy, after the very favourable opinion which Mr. Colman, who is undoubtedly a competent judge of dramatic compositions, had expressed of it,
<PB REF="3"/>
all along, from the time he received it, in July 1770, when he pronounced it
<Q>to bid fairer, both for same and profit, than any of her theatrical writings,</Q>
to the day of its repre∣sentation, in March last, on the morning of which he offered
<Q>to underwrite its success, for half a crown.</Q></P>
<P>However, she confesses that, for some time before the exhibition, she had sufficient cause to be alarmed, on account of Mr. Shuter, who had a long and principal part in the comedy, seldom attending the rehearsals; and when he did, being found to be extremely imperfect— The author remonstrated upon this occasion, and the manager indeed lamented the difficulty along with her, but redressed it not.</P>
<P>At length though late, a day was appointed for the representation, and on that morning Mr. Shuter appeared at rehearsal, pretty much in the same state as before, and confessed him∣self incapable of performing his part, that night. Upon which the play was obliged to be further postponed, and hand-bills were sent about at noon, to advertise the town of the disappointment.</P>
<P>This was a most unlucky circumstance for the author. The curiosity of the public palls upon such delays, and many of her friends, who had waited in London to attend the per∣formance, went into the country, concluding, from the uncertainty of the performer, joined
<PB REF="4"/>
to the lateness of the season, that the comedy could not be exhibited, this year.</P>
<P>A further and final day was afterwards de∣termined on, but the audience being out of humour at their former disappointment, called Mr. Shuter to account for it, on his first ap∣pearance; which threw him into such a con∣fusion, that he was not able to get the better of it, throughout the whole performance.</P>
<P>This untoward incident occasioned two very considerable disadvantages to the piece. In the hurry of his spirits the actor not only forgot his part, the deficiency of which he endea∣voured to supply with his own dialect, but also seemed to lose all idea of the character he was to perform; and made the Governor ap∣pear in a light which the author never intend∣ed; that of a mean, ridiculous buffoon. This unlucky failure in the performer, was, by some, unfortunately imputed to the writer, and appeared to be a sufficient reason for condemn∣ing the piece.</P>
<P>Yet, notwithstanding these almost insuper∣able disadvantages, the play was suffered to proceed, without any sort of reprehension, ex∣cept in the instance above-mentioned, and the Epilogue concluding with these lines,
<Q><L>The author for your passport trembling stands,</L>
<L>And hopes you'll grant it <HI>under all your hands,</HI></L></Q>
received the fullest approbation from the au∣dience, without one single dissenting voice.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>Many of her friends immediately quitted the theatre, in perfect assurance of the favourable event, and came to wish her joy that the co∣medy had been sufficiently strong to struggle thro' such hazardous circumstances, as before recited. But the pleasure she received on this occasion, was extremely transient, for she was in a few minutes after informed, that when the play was going to be given out, for the next night, some obscure persons, in a corner of the gallery, objected to it, who were op∣posed by a considerable majority in all parts of the house; but that after this kind of alter∣cation had been continued, for some minutes, the council behind the curtain, taking alarm at an apple being flung from the upper gallery, and striking a branch of one of the chandeliers, thought proper to obey the malicious, who are ever the most active, rather than the friendly, part of the audience, and withdrew the play.</P>
<P>Whether this opposition arose from ill-na∣ture, or ill-temper, cannot be now determin∣ed; tho' the latter cause is full sufficient to ac∣count for the effect, as every one knows how dangerous a thing it must always be, to suffer an audience to be out of humour, at a first representation of any dramatic performance; and on this account it would certainly have been prudent to have brought Mr. Shuter be∣fore them, in some of his more perfect cha∣racters, between the night of the first and <HI>se∣cond</HI> disappointment, in order to have palliated
<PB REF="6"/>
the resentment of the public, so as to have prevented any interruption to the performance, on that account, at least.</P>
<P>By the advice of those friends who were present, the author went, that night, to Mr. Colman's house, to confer with him upon this unexpected ebb of fortune. He seemed to be much affected with it himself, expressed a friendly concern at her disappointment, and promised to consult with the rest of the pro∣prietors, upon what compensation or redress it might be reasonable to make her, upon this occasion. But the next morning he sent her a letter to acquaint her, that
<Q>all her pro∣spects from that quarter must be at an end, for that she was to expect nothing farther from the theatre.</Q></P>
<P>The author happened to receive this severe sentence in the midst of a large circle of her friends, who were then with her, offering their services, for that night, to bring on the comedy again, engaging to prove the positive part of the audience superior to the negative one, upon that trial. But this kind and well-intentioned offer she declined.</P>
<P>She adhered to the same moderation, also, the next day, when the same offer was again repeated, and seconded by several persons, be∣fore unknown to her, but who seemed to con∣sider hers as a common cause against oppres∣sion, and declared a full confidence of carrying
<PB REF="7"/>
the point against any opposition that might be attempted.</P>
<P>The author does not deny that she felt re∣sentment, and was sensible of injustice, all the while; but she feared the consequence of a riot to the manager's property; choosing to suffer an injury, rather than to do one.</P>
<P>All this temper and conduct was then calmly represented to the manager, both by letter, and the interposition of friends, but no notice was taken of it. The author confesses that she then made a claim of right, to some com∣pensation, upon the late occasion, but not till after it had been refused her, as a matter of fa∣vour. She founded her demand, upon the usage, which is the only law of theatres, and quoted many precedents of the same kind; some of them in circumstances too, far more unfavour∣able to the client; but neither <HI>custom,</HI> nor <HI>courtesy,</HI> it seems, were to be allowed sufficient pleas, in her most singular case.</P>
<P>The author does not mean, by any thing the situation of this affair has obliged her to say here, to charge Mr. Colman with the least design to her injury, by any part of his con∣duct, throughout. She believes him to have been perfectly sincere in his professions, and ingenuous in his purposes towards her; and has seen him mortified and concerned to the last degree, at the delays and disappointments she met with, tho' he did not sufficiently exert his authority to prevent, or remedy them.</P>
<P><PB REF="8"/>The author's friends, upon finding that she would not avail herself, in the way they had first recommended, advised her to publish the comedy, by subscription; as well to vindicate her writing from the misrepresentation of the night of performance, as to make herself some small amends for the considerable loss and mortification she had sustained, from its failure.</P>
<P>This kind proposal she has most gratefully accepted of; and after repeating here her ac∣knowledgments to the public, and her friends, for the liberal encouragement they have shewn her, upon this, and every occasion, she takes this opportunity also of returning her thanks to the other performers in her comedy, who took the pains to be perfect in their several parts, and so well endeavoured to support the spirit of their respective characters, amidst the hurry and confusion which so unhappily in∣terrupted the course of the performance.</P>
<P>She now begs leave to make an apology for having presumed to claim so much of the public attention, on a subject relative merely to her∣self; and with the sincerest gratitude has the honour to subscribe herself their much obliged, and most obedient servant,</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<HEAD>WRITTEN BY MR. COLMAN, And spoken by Mrs. BULKLEY.</HEAD>
<L>BY your leave, critics! To a female play</L>
<L>A female prologue may prepare the way.</L>
<L>Among the Chronicles of modern fame</L>
<L>Who has not read of gentle Frances' name?</L>
<L>Henry and Frances! a fond tender pair,</L>
<L>Whose soft epistles still amuse the fair.</L>
<L>Some nights ago our couple, all alone,</L>
<L>A fire-side <HI>tête-à-tête</HI>—Darby and Joan—</L>
<L>Frances, said Henry, give up writing; men,</L>
<L>And men alone should dare to wield the pen.</L>
<L>Your sex of late all decency confounds,</L>
<L>And breaks 'twixt us and them the modest bounds.</L>
<L>Whether from passion, love of pow'r or riches,</L>
<L>Women, we see, all like to wear the breeches.</L>
<L>At sea some madcaps enter volunteers,</L>
<L>Some in the army list as grenadiers:</L>
<L>Others write hist'ries, state-intrigues unriddle,</L>
<L>Ride the great horse, and play upon the fiddle.</L>
<L>Gently, cries Frances; truce with your reproaches!</L>
<L>And mark which sex on t'other most encroaches.</L>
<L>Soft silky coxcombs, full of nice punctilio,</L>
<L>All paste, pomatum, essence, and pulvilio,</L>
<L>With huge boaupots, like boughpots, daily go,</L>
<L>Trick'd out like dolls, to pace in Rotten-row.</L>
<L>Thus flies the morning; and the day to crown,</L>
<L>To quinze and faro ev'ry fop sits down.</L>
<L><PB REF="19"/>Each coat so trim, lest any speck fall on it,</L>
<L>An apron guards,—each forehead a straw-bonnet;</L>
<L>Nay lest rouleaus themselves should soil their ruffles,</L>
<L>A muffatee each pretty master muffles.</L>
<L>Women in vain to keep their place have striven;</L>
<L>From ev'ry trade, from each profession driven.</L>
<L>Men-midwives swarm; men mantuas make, make stays,</L>
<L>Dress hair, dress meat—let women then write plays!</L>
<L>While narrow prejudice deform'd the age,</L>
<L>No actress play'd, no female trod the stage;</L>
<L>Some smooth unrazor'd youth for Juliet rav'd,</L>
<L>And Kings sat waiting till the Queen was shav'd;</L>
<L>But woman once brought forward on the scene,</L>
<L>By man, like Eve, was lik'd as soon as seen.</L>
<L>Let females then compose, as well as play,</L>
<L>And strive to please you in the noblest way!</L>
<L>No sulky critic to the play-house drawn,</L>
<L>Whom modern comedy provokes to yawn,</L>
<L>But marks of authors past the valu'd file,</L>
<L>And owns Centlivre tempted him to smile.</L>
<L>Why may not Ladies too in future plays,</L>
<L>Strike <HI>a Bold Stroke,</HI> and, anxious for the bays,</L>
<L>New <HI>Busy Bodies</HI> form, new <HI>Wonders</HI> raise?</L>
<L>Thus Frances spoke, and bid her dear good night—</L>
<L>And Henry own'd <HI>his Wife was in the Right.</HI></L>

<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> SEATON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I TELL you, Markam, 'tis impossible! I neither can, nor will believe it. What! Charlotte Melville! The companion of my youth, the confidant of my heart! could she form a connection so unworthy of herself! I say again, it must be impossible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, Ma'am, if you don't chuse to believe it, I can't undertake to convince your Ladyship; but I think the proofs are sufficiently strong, on my side of the question—and if I had such a husband—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Learn to speak with more respect of Lord Seaton, Markam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="22"/>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg pardon, Ma'am, but I was in a little sort of flurry, to think of your Ladyship's being so ungratefully used, by—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stop, I command you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Ma'am, if your Ladyship won't hear what one has to say, you can never expect to come at the truth, surely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, however, I wish to learn; therefore, now tell me upon what circumstances you ground your suspicions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place, Ma'am, did not Miss Melville elope, as it were, from this house, with∣out so much as letting <HI>me</HI> know where she was going to, just a few days before you were married?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can account for Charlotte's quitting me, at that time, but too well, Markam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be, Ma'am, you can account for her clandestine correspondence with my Lord, also.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>A clandestine correspondence with Lord Seaton! What do you mean, Markam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mean! I mean what I say, Ma'am. These very eyes saw her receive a letter from him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not from <HI>my</HI> Lord—From Lord Seaton, Markam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Ma'am, from <HI>your</HI> Ladyship's Lord—Lord Seaton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you indeed amaze me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was sitting in the very next room, just there at the harpsichord—and sweetly she does play, to be sure—I happened to be standing in this very spot, settling the toilette, Ma'am—I love a little music dearly, and I did stop to listen, I own; but without thinking any sort of harm,
<PB N="3" REF="23"/>
heaven knows;—for I then took her to be as in∣nocent as the child unborn—when—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I still wish to think her. But proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>When, as I was saying, Ma'am, in steps my Lord; and with the very same sort of bow that he used to make to your Ladyship—for you know he was courting, at that time—Miss Melville, said he, I have long languished—yes— <HI>languished</HI> was the word, Ma'am, for an opportu∣nity of speaking to you, upon a subject of the utmost importance to my happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>What subject?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that, indeed, he did not di∣rectly say, Ma'am;—but really, I don't think it so very difficult to guess. But you shall hear, Ma'am—Whereabouts was I? O, where he <HI>lan∣guished for an opportunity</HI>; but despairing to find one, continued he, I have taken the liberty of conveying my sentiments to you in writing. So saying he laid a letter down upon the harpsichord, and I made the best of my way out of this room, for fear of being seen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Grant all this to be true, it does not prove her guilty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>She had no need to blush, then, if she was innocent; and I warrant your Ladyship that her face was as red as your Morro satin, all the while my Lord was talking to her; though it is naturally pure and pale, you know, at any other time. I never was deceived in looks, in my life; and it was by Dolly Sly, the housemaid's blushing, that I found out the affair between her and George the groom, last summer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Drop your absurd comparisons, and tell me, Markam, why you did not mention this
<PB N="4" REF="24"/>
circumstance to me, before I was married? It might have served me, then!
<STAGE>(<HI>Sighs.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Ma'am, it would have been a very indiscreet thing in me, and contrary to my own interest, as well as your Ladyship's, to have made mischief between my Lord and you, be∣fore you were married. It might have broken off the match, perhaps, and then every servant in the house would have been a loser, as well as I, Ma'am. But when once the wedding should be over, and all secured, I resolved to watch her closely, and if I saw any thing wrong, to acquaint your Ladyship with it then, when it could do no harm. But they have been too cunning for us, this trip. For to be sure and certain, she is now with my Lord, at his house in the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible! I will not listen to this idle tale, spun out of your own imagination, with∣out a single proof or even probable conclusion to support it. Again I tell you that you are deceiv∣ed, and that Miss Melville's tenderness for me ad∣mits of no dispute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her tenderness, indeed? A plague on all such tenderness, I say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>You grow intemperate, Markam. Leave me, and order Thomas to try at every stand in London, to find out the chair that carried Miss Melville from this house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is above a month ago, since she left us, and I mightily doubt whether Thomas will be able to recollect either the chairmen or their num∣ber, at this distance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do as I direct, without surmises.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll send Thomas, instantly, Ma'am. (A pretty sort of wild goose chace, truly.
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>)</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="25"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>This affair of the letter has tended but too much to convince me of my Lord's at∣tachment to Charlotte—but how is she to blame? Did she take advantage of his passion for her, or strive to supplant me in his heart? O! no, I only am in fault.—My ill-timed coldness and reserve ba∣nished my friend, and has deprived me of that more than sisterly affection which had ever subsisted be∣tween us. I will not rest till I atone my conduct towards her; for in spite of all that Markam says, my heart by sympathy assures me of her inno∣cence.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> MARKAM.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, Ma'am, is just arrived. (I hope she'll be in a better humour, now, since he is returned.
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how does he look, pray? He has been absent, I think, these ten days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look! Ma'am—Why just as he used to do, to be sure.—Ten days! Why what is that in a gentleman's life, Ma'am? Though truly your Ladyship has moped yourself pale again, in that time, with fretting about him, and that plaguy Miss Melville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be silent, I command you.</P>
</SP>

<P>(What the duce makes her so cross, of late? one had as good be dumb, if they are not allowed to speak.
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>And where is my Lord? did he ask for me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>He was following me up to wait on you, Ma'am, when Colonel Ramsay, just arrived from abroad, came into the house.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colonel Ramsay! what shall I say to him, or how account for Charlotte's abrupt de∣parture from my house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>In truth, Ma'am, if I was you, I'd throw all the blame on Miss Melville; for I am sure, that your Ladyship never used her ill, in the least, but was as civil and distant to her, latterly, as if she had been a duchess.</P>
</SP>

<P>Female friendships, you know, Charles, are not among the perennials of life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a mere common-place reflection, my Lord, adapted only to the very triflers of the sex. I have been acquainted with Miss Melville, even from her infancy, and never knew any per∣son more intirely governed by sense, prudence, and proper affections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Colonel, you are entering in∣to a serious defence of one whom I had not the least design of accusing.—There are two ladies in the question, you know; and if either was to blame, mine might, <HI>possibly,</HI> be the one in fault; for I have not been able to discover any symptoms of infallibility, in her Ladyship, yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pretend not to perfection, my Lord, but hope I am incapable of acting—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wrong.—Doubtless, Madam. But errors in judgment, I suppose, you'l admit to be the common lot of frail mortality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feel it severely, in myself, my Lord, but cannot, however, avoid thinking it cruel to add to the distress I am already sensible of on Miss Melville's account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite barbarous, I confess, Madam, —but husbands are savages, it seems.</P>

<P>Are there any letters for me, Lady Seaton?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I presume, my Lord, upon the pri∣vilege of former friendship, to speak my sentiments freely to you, on the present occasion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I think, Charles, that this same former friendship you hint at, has rendered us so thoroughly acquainted with each other, that I am not to expect any thing very new, in the sen∣timental dialect, I suppose, at present. But pro∣ceed—a story may be good, though 'tis an old one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, my Lord, I will frankly con∣fess to you that I feel myself hurt at your beha∣viour to Lady Seaton, just now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that is pretty concise, truly, Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Remember, my Lord, the condition sti∣pulated, and then suffer me to tell you, that there is something so unmanly, in treating a woman ill, especially one within our power, that had I not been a witness to the <HI>unpoliteness,</HI> I shall only say, of your speech and manner toward Lady Seaton, I could never have given credit to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, Charles, I believe I might have behaved a little too harshly to her La∣dyship, upon this occasion; but I own I was dis∣pleased at her seeming to cast the blame of her quitting the house, upon the dear girl—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>What girl, my Lord? You do not speak of Miss Melville, sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Melville! O! no, no—my wife—'twas her I meant—dear foolish girl, I say, to quarrel with her friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then, my Lord, you think that she did quarrel with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="29"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you can't suppose, Colonel, that there could possibly have been any other reason for Miss Melville's quitting Lady Seaton's house. For my own part—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, my Lord, I know not what to think; but as there appears to be some sort of mys∣tery, in this affair, I shall write to my sister, Mrs. Freeman, this night, between whom and Lady Seaton her affections were equally divided, and with whom I hope she is, at present. Two years absence have left me scarce any other clue to trace her by. But I shall never cease from the pursuit, till I have recovered my lost treasure, the lovely Charlotte.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' you should find her, Colonel, she may, possibly, be lost to you—Two years con∣stancy to an absent lover, Charles! How can you be so unconscionable to expect it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not the least doubt of it, my Lord, nor shall I ever suspect my mistress of inconstancy, or my friend of infidelity, 'till I detect a failure in my own heart, that may warrant theirs. I neither love, nor like, lightly, my Lord, and of course, do not lightly change.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear it, Charles, as I think I may now venture to introduce you, this evening, to a very fine woman, who may, possibly, put your boasted constancy to the trial.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish, both for Lady Seaton's sake, and your own, my Lord, that your heart was as much proof against the allurements of profligate beauty, as mine is. But I have no leisure to make the ex∣periment you mention, at present, as every mo∣ment of my time shall be devoted to my search after Miss Melville.</P>
</SP>

<P>Your Lordship must excuse me. I have better purposes for my love and youth, than to sacrifice them on Circe's altar.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a word more on this subject, Charles—Here comes the Governor, my wife's uncle, and for your entertainment I hope his um∣bra, his secretary, his valet de chambre, or what∣ever else he pleases to call him, is with him; for I really think he is as great a curiosity as has ever been imported from the coast of Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mandel.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was originally a country school-master, whom the Governor carried with him to India, and there used him as his private secretary; but on his return to England, having no further occasion for him, in that capacity, he has now de∣graded him to the state of his valet de chambre;

<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, it may be so, but I think, now, that a fine hand—

</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, heaven be praised,—poor dear Bab's at peace. But as you have one, my Lord, she may perhaps think she has a right to be jealous of your receiving billet-doux's—I used to have a sad time of it, with her aunt, upon that score, I'll assure you. We have had twenty squabbles a-day, sometimes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>'Tis from my charming widow, Charles.

<P>Your female correspondents must have been very numerous, I presume, Sir.</P>

But even then, Sir, I don't take upon me to say that I used to receive a score of love-letters, every day— I am no boaster, Captain, tho' I have been a fa∣vourite, in my time, let me tell you. But what with her jealousy, and other slight causes, my poor dear wife and I used to contrive a wrangling-bout, for every hour in the day. You can't imagine how much I missed her, for the first two or three months, after she died. But time—time, Cap∣tain, gets the better of every thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtless, Sir.—I fancy, my Lord, the hour of dressing draws nigh, and as the Governor

<P>Why there now, what a pragmatical world do we live in! your wife is my niece, and yet I must suffer myself to be bound up to my good behaviour, forsooth, before I can be allowed to sit down to table with her; more than if I was to dine with the Sultana of Persia.</P>

<P>That is the very thing I would be at, the laying out my money to the best advantage, and therefore, d'ye hear, I would be glad to know, supposing the worst should happen, and that Sir William should out-bid me, how much I may be likely to lose by the disappointment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squeez.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a calculation intirely out of my way, Sir. But to cut the matter short, Sir, if you will please to sign this article, and give me a bill on your ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, for fifteen hundred, or a couple of thousands, I'll promise you to make it go as far as any man in England, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, truly, stocks are so confounded low, at present, that I can't bear the thoughts of selling
<PB N="21" REF="41"/>
out, to a disadvantage. But you may pass your word to them, Mr. Squeezem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squeez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pass my word, Governor! Such coin will not pass current, in that quarter, I assure you. Sterling cash, and nothing else will do. But if it is so very inconvenient to you to raise the money, there are gentlemen enough ready to leap at the offer. There has not been so cheap a borough to be sold, these seven years, nor won't be, during this session, I'll warrant you. Why, Sir, every man of property in the kingdom wants to get into parlia∣ment, now; and you gentlemen Nabobs have raised the price of boroughs, as well as of every other commodity, throughout the nation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, since it must be so, we'll see what's to be done. I shall meet Bull, presently, and he shall carry you a thousand. That will be two, and I won't go a shilling farther, remember, Mr. Squeezem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squeez.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall do my best, Sir, but two will never do the thing handsomely, I fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it be done at all, I care not a farthing for the handsomness of the matter, d'ye see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squeez.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can venture to say, that neither Sir William, his father, or grandfather—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>What the plague, are you going to draw down the Wealthy's upon us again—Come along, Nicholas, get me my hat, and my gold-headed bamboo, I mean the best of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nich.</SPEAKER>
<P>I obey your Excellency.
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squeez.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must set out with the sun, to-morrow morning, to fix our friends: for I hear that Sir William went down, this day, with his coach full of money; but no matter, leave it to me to out-promise all that he can perform; so that if your Excellency will be pleased but to sign this bond,
<PB N="22" REF="42"/>
you shall have a good account of the borough, by the very next post.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have no bonds in India, and a man is unworthy to live in any quarter of the globe, whose word requires a counter-security—Bull shall carry you the money to-night.
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squeez.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be a bad thing for us prac∣titioners in the law, if such customs were to obtain in Europe. But 'tis our certain maxim that any man's money is as good as his bond, whatever his word may be.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Madam, how charmingly you look to-day. Never, sure, was any thing so becoming, as your dress; and if we could but get your jewels now, out of Mr. Cheatall's hands, I think you might really pass for a queen, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the jewels, Lucy, I fear I shall never see them more. However, give me the paste ear-rings, for the present; they'll pass on the Governor for his own brilliants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope they may, Madam, for as they were a love-token from his Excellency, you should not have parted with them, at least till after you were married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love-token! nonsense, Lucy, for such a creature to think of love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Madam, if it was not for that same nonsense, you would not have had the ear∣rings;
<PB N="23" REF="43"/>
and I wish Mr. Bull, and his nonsense had been far enough before he wheedled you out of them: for I tell you, again, Madam, that if the Governor should miss them, we are all blown up at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it, Lucy; but there was no resisting Mr. Bull's importunities, unless one had a heart as hard—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>As his own, Madam. But I hope, when you are married, you'll cast him off intirely, for I am sure if you don't, his necessities will always keep you poor, and then no body else will ever be a farthing the better for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Lucy, there's the rub, with you.—And so you would have me seriously think of becoming a kind and faithful spouse, and devoting my whole affections to the love of my great grand∣father, for your advantage, truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, really, Madam, I am not quite so unreasonable, for I know it is as good to be out of the world, as out of the fashion, and since you must have a lover, why there's my Lord Seaton, that admires you so much, and a fine gentleman he is, and rich too, into the bargain, I'll warrant me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you have touched the master string of all my misery. I love him, Lucy, and know myself unworthy of his passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, for goodness sake, dear Madam, don't sigh, and look so melancholy—you frighten me out of my wits. I shall dream of the Magdalen, as sure as a gun, to-night. You ought not to let such thoughts come into your head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>A sincere passion makes us humble, Lucy. It is impossible that Lord Seaton should return my affection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="44"/>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I can't see that, for my life; and if you would but look in the glass there, I fancy you would soon be of another opinion yourself too. If I was but half as handsome, I know what I should think. Why there's that Miss Melville, now, that our John says is such a beauty—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, indeed, I must confess that I have some personal advantages over her. But then, how many others has she above me! I almost hate her, at the thought.
<STAGE>A knocking at the door.</STAGE>
Run, Lucy, see who it is. My spirits take alarm, at every motion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And reason enough, indeed, Madam. So many duns, and nothing to satisfy them! My pa∣tience is almost as much worn out, as theirs; and if it were not for my hopes of being well rewarded, when she's married to the Governor, I'd e'en leave her to answer them herself.
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Into what scenes of misery has my thoughtless vanity plunged me! Could I have been but contented with the safe, though humble state of life, in which my fortune had placed me, I should not now have been the wretch I am.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> LUCY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be frightened, Madam, it was no body but the postman, with a letter to Miss Mel∣ville. I left her reading it, in the parlour. She asked me if you were dressed, and I fancy she is just coming up. I wish Miss would not be so prying as to sit so much below stairs, for there can't be a hand's turn done in the house, without her knowing it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish she was fairly out of it, with all my heart. I beg, Lucy, that you will contrive
<PB N="25" REF="45"/>
to keep every thing quiet, here, for a few days, lest any untoward circumstance should marr all our projects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear, we'll manage matters, I war∣rant you, till you are the Governor's Lady, Ma∣dam, and then you know—
<STAGE>Exit Lucy.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I know that I shall be com∣pletely wretched—To have nothing further to hope for, without enjoyment in our present possessions, is a miserable state, surely!
<STAGE><HI>Enter Miss</HI> MELVILLE, <HI>with a letter.</HI></STAGE>
So, my dear, you have just received a <HI>billet-doux,</HI> I presume.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, really, Madam, the contents of this letter have nothing either sweet or soft, in them.— 'Tis from my aunt, Lady Walton, who declines receiving me under her protection, from a ridi∣culous apprehension that her son, Sir William, now just coming of age, might possibly take it into his head to fall in love with his cousen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I think that to be no un∣likely surmise, Miss Melville; and I must suppose it to be with such an idea, at least, that the bury∣ing yourself alive in Northamptonshire, could ever have come into your head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Mrs. Frankly, you are much mistaken—I could never have thought of soliciting a favour, with an intention of repaying it with in∣gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then, if that was not the case, I think I have reason to congratulate you on being, as it were, compelled to follow your own inclina∣tions, by remaining still in this dear delightful city.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="26" REF="46"/>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>London, I confess to be a charming place, Maria, to those who may innocently indulge themselves in its gaieties; but a young woman without fortune or friends—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friends! what an antique expres∣sion! But you were ever romantic, my dear, and began, even at school, I remember, to speculate upon morals, sentiment, and such notions; but be∣lieve me, there is no such thing, on earth, as a friend, except money, child. Youth and beauty are bills of exchange, and therefore you may be a friend to yourself, if you please, my dear.
<STAGE>(Hums a tune.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a strange wild way of talking, Mrs. Frankly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frankly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing but the way of the world, and plain common sense, child. But, by-the-by, Charlotte, I think the story you told me, about your quitting your <HI>friend,</HI> as you affect to call her, has something in it bordering nearly upon absur∣dity. And then your concealing the names of the parties, even from me, my dear, has somewhat in it so very childish, mysterious, and pretty—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have said too much of their respective situations ever to reveal their names. We may make confidants in our own secrets, but have no right over those of others; nor can I be said to be ab∣surd, in sacrificing my own interest and convenience to the peace and happiness of a person, whom, not∣withstanding your sad opinion of the world, I truly believe to have been my friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your conduct, I grant it, was he∣roic, Charlotte, and might have made a notable figure in a romance, some centuries ago; but epic virtue, my dear, is by no means the <HI>ton</HI> of modern times. The present world is not near so difficult as
<PB N="27" REF="47"/>
it was formerly; and the utmost that is required of feeble nature, now-a-days, is barely to conceal the vices we have, under the affectation of those virtues we are deficient in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hypocrisy, they say, is the homage that vice pays to virtue; but I consider it rather as an aggravation of iniquity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, prithee, Miss Melville, do not preach against prudence. It is certainly a very necessary quality, at least, and one that I would, as <HI>a friend,</HI> most seriously recommend to your own practice. But as I am really not yet old enough to set up for a Duenna, we'll change the subject, if you please—What think you of Ranelagh, to-night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must beg to be excused from appear∣ing in public, Mrs. Frankly, 'till my situation and circumstances in life, shall be in some degree more ascertained.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, absolutely, child, you amaze me! your fortune is small, your relations seem to have cut you off; then what measure is left you, now, but <HI>to ascertain your situation and circumstances,</HI> as you say, by the means of your personal advan∣tages? Had I staid moping and moralizing in a corner, I should never have made the figure in life I do, at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our spirit and talents are of quite dif∣ferent natures, Maria.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess, indeed, that there is something rather more striking, in my form and features, than in yours; but tastes differ, you know, my dear; and as in pictures, some like the busy, others the still life, so there may, perhaps, be certain virtuosos, who might possibly give you the preference.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="28" REF="48"/>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Mrs. Frankly, I shall never pretend to rival you. There is but one man in the world I ever wished to please, and he is, to my misfortune, far distant, at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo, Miss Charlotte. And who is this dear man, I pray you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>There again you must excuse my silence, Maria. Two years of absence may have changed his sentiments; and tho' mine for him can never vary, the world is apt to think our being the first to receive and the last to retain a passion, to be a I reach of that kind of prudence, you have just now recommended to me. You see I can profit by ad∣vice, Maria.</P>

Who is that charm∣ing girl, Maria, and how came you acquainted with her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>We were bred at the same board∣ing-school together, but had not seen one another, these eight years, till about a month ago I met her, by chance, at my milleners, who happened to be her's also. She was inquiring for lodgings, for a short time that she purposed staying in London, and I foolishly invited her to my house, in hopes of an agreeable companion at home; but I find her such a canting Methodist, that I shall lay hold on the first fair pretence that offers, of ridding my∣self of so stupid an incumbrance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>She looks far from being stupid, Maria; and if I might advise, I would not have you let the Governor see her. I think I never saw more lively eyes, in my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they have set your heart of tinder in a blaze, I suppose.</P>
</SP>

<P>No, Maria—tho' if you had not been by, I know not what might have been the case.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stuff! this is nothing to the pur∣pose, at present. But where is the money you shewed me, just now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here it is, a round five hundred, in cash and paper. There never was any thing so lucky as my getting it from the Governor, to see your law∣yers, Maria. Ha, ha, ha—But I hope it will keep me out of their talons, at least, for a little while longer, till something better happens.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>You astonish me, Mr. Bull! Why, you do not mean to convert it to your own use, surely.</P>

<P>I must confess I really do, thou most asto∣nished fair.</P>

<P>What! while my jewels lie pledged for your necessities?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who was the cause of your getting those jewels, Mrs. Frankly? Whose credit has hi∣therto supported you in affluence and grandeur, Mrs. Frankly? And what has involved Samuel Bull in difficulties and ruin, but the necessities of Mrs. Frankly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Upbraiding cancels every obliga∣tion—I shall let the Governor know how you have behaved both to him and me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>How fortunate have I been, in meeting with Mrs. Freeman, even in the very moment when I began so severely to be sensible of my in∣discretion, in having too lightly accepted of Mrs. Frankly's invitation. The freedom of those sen∣timents she expressed, just now, has both shocked and surprized me. My happy inexperience did not suffer me to suspect that a few years commerce with the world, could have produced so absolute a change, in a heart that formerly appeared as inno∣cent and artless as my own. Nor could I have be∣lieved that the widow Frankly, launched into the world at large, might become a very different sort of character, from what she first appeared in, as my school-fellow and friend.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Mr. Varnish, what is a paltry hun∣dred and thirty pounds, to a man of your sub∣stance, when you consider how many more hundreds you may get by my Lady? Why she must have three new carriages, at least, for herself, when she is married, besides a most superb palanquin, for his Excellency, such as your Nabobs use; and she has promised to buy me a tim-whiskey, for myself; and I have ever found her as good as her word— she is not one of your court promisers, I assure you.</P>

<P>I wish I could say so, with all my heart; but she has promised to pay me my <HI>paltry sum,</HI> as

<P>Dear Madam, he is gone, and my Mistress out too; but if he were with her, a thousand times, I dare not do so. Mr. Bull, to be sure, is a very rich man, but a very penurious one, and might perhaps disinherit his niece, if he knew that she ventured to run a shilling in debt.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Varn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it is not to him she is going to be married? Eh, Lucy. He has debts enough of his own to pay, I can tell you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>O dear, no, Mr. Varnish, she is to be married to a great rich Nabob, worth six millions, the least farthing.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Varn.</SPEAKER>
<P>(Why that's a good round sum, truly, if one could be certain of the matter—'Tis worth trying, however.
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>)
Eh, Mrs. Lucy, and may I depend on her dealing with me, afterwards? for I have been fobbed off, in that way, before now. When the quality get so far in our debt, that they don't choose to pay, they often quit us, and then do as much for some other of the trade.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But my Lady has too much honour, to serve any one so, believe me.</P>

Well, Mrs. Lucy, to shew you, now, what a reasonable man I am, I will take your

word for my debt, 'till your Lady is married. (And then either the Nabob's purse or person shall be my security.

But you are certain she will want three carriages.</P>

<P>Ay, as sure as there is truth in my words, Mr. Varnish.</P>

<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am alarmed, even to terror, at my situation here. Every thing I see or hear, confirms my apprehensions and suspicions, with regard to Mrs. Frankly's conduct. It seems an age till I quit her house.—Under the protection of my dear Mrs. Freeman, how safe and happy shall I feel myself! The consciousness of one's own virtue becomes doubly pleasing, from the concurring testimony of an amiable and worthy friend.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Madam, I beg your pardon, but that vile blundering coach-maker man has put it quite out of my head to tell you, that just as you came into the door, a servant in livery followed you, and asked our John if you lived here; and the fool only answered simply, yes, without inquiring his business, or calling me to sift him. But if he should come again, I shall be able to give a good account of his errand, I warrant me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am obliged to you, Mrs. Lucy, but would not have you give yourself the least trouble in the matter, as I shall quit this house in the even∣ing, and know no person who can have any manner of business to enquire after me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear, Madam, why my Lady will be so lonesome without you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy not, Mrs. Lucy. But pray is she visible at present? for I am impatient to ac∣quaint her with my good fortune in meeting with the friend I went in quest of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure she will rejoice at it. But pray, Madam, where does your friend live? I should be glad to know, in case the servant should call again with a letter to you. I'll lay my life on't you have made some new conquest, Madam, tho' the fellow was cunning enough to pretend that he belonged to some Lady, when he asked the question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis never worth a woman's while, Lucy, to trouble herself about any chance admirer—if he be really one, he will soon find out some method or other of declaring himself so. Too much anxiety about such matters always renders us contemptible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find, Madam, that you don't chuse to trust me with your secrets.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Lucy, I have none. Innocence disdains mystery. Nor is there a single action of my life, that I need wish to be concealed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's an extraordinary declaration, truly, in these days, for a young Lady turned of eighteen. And now, if you please, Madam, I'll see if my Lady be come in, and let her know that you desire to speak with her.</P>
</SP>

<P>I shall be obliged to you.

Unhappy Maria! how sincerely do I pity her

situation! yet let me hope that indiscretions rather than vice, have misled her steps from the sole paths of happiness and peace. But do they not, alas! in our sex, almost equally involve their wretched victims in misery, and lead them on to ruin! Were it possible for me to awaken her to a sense of her danger, I should then have most amply repaid her civilities to me, by an act of the most real kindness and friendship.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>Lady Seaton's compliments to Co∣lonel Ramsay, and desires the honour of his company to supper, this evening, on a very par∣ticular occasion.</Q>
What can this particular in∣vitation mean? There seems to be something odd in this business, Colonel. Perhaps her Ladyship designs to raise my jealousy. I have heard of such arts put in practice upon lukewarm husbands, here∣tofore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has gone one step towards it, my Lord, at least, by raising your curiosity. But where our affections are not much interested, I should think it unnatural for any such passion to be moved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll pardon me, Colonel, for though I am not romantically in love with my wife, I could perhaps be as outrageously jealous of her honour, on the least alarm, as the most amorous coxcomb breathing. But to do her justice, her conduct through life has been so irreproachable, that I dare say her sense and virtue will never suffer her to render me uneasy; that way, at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be better pleased at hearing you make your wife's encomium, if it did not so strongly
<PB N="40" REF="60"/>
reflect upon yourself, my Lord. How is it possible that you can allow her those merits which are to be the basis of your security and peace, and yet withhold from her the just reward of them, your tenderness and esteem?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not press me upon this subject, Ramsay, for even to you I cannot unfold the secret of my heart; but will so far confess to you that I have acted, and still continue to do so, against the fullest conviction both of my honour and reason. But perhaps if I could happen to discover a few failings in my wife's character, her presence would be less uneasy to me; for, in short, Charles, we cannot love any one cordially, who constantly re∣proaches us, though ever so silently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a perverse fate is Lady Seaton doomed to, whose very merits are imputed to her as faults! but I hope, for your own sake, as well as hers, that this delirium will soon have an end; for no rational person can ever taste of happiness, who is conscious of pursuing it by improper means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though I feel the full force of your argument, Charles, you must permit me to tell you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>What I know already, my Lord, that passion is often too strong for reason; and while Mrs. Frankly's charms retain their dominion over your heart, you will continue still blind and in∣sensible to those of Lady Seaton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are mistaken, Colonel, my heart is no way concerned, in my attachment to Mrs. Frankly—for though she is handsome, lively, and, as far as I can judge, has nothing of the prude about her, she can only amuse, but not infatuate; and 'tis merely in hopes of triumphing over a more serious passion, that I sometimes trifle away an hour or two with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="41" REF="61"/>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is an extraordinary declaration, in∣deed, my Lord, and leaves me still more at a loss for the clue to your labyrinth.</P>

<STAGE>Exit Waters.</STAGE>
Will you accompany me, Colonel, or shall I set you down any where else?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my Lord. I shall return to my search after Miss Melville, and shall then do myself the honour to obey Lady Seaton's summons to supper. I hope we shall meet then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not whether I should obtrude on your <HI>tête à tête,</HI> or shall have resolution enough to quit mine, with my little widow, so soon. But success attend your pursuit.</P>

<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>I most sincerely wish that he may be able to discover Miss Melville's retreat, which I have so much in vain attempted. But then should she reveal the cause of her quitting this house, will not Ramsay think I have acted unworthily? But of what consequence are his thoughts, to the secret upbraidings of my own! Could I but recal a few short weeks, I should be happy, because I should be blameless. But that indissoluble knot, which has rendered an amiable woman as wretched as myself, can never be untied. Then hang reflection, success to dissipation, and now for a little flirt with my lively widow, for the rest of the evening.

SCENE, Mrs. FRANKLY's house.</STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mrs.</HI> FRANKLY <HI>and Miss</HI> MELVILLE.</STAGE>
<P>You are upon the wing, I find, Miss Melville; I shall be vastly dull without you. But before you set out, pray let me a little, into your present scheme; and first tell me about what age may your friend Mrs. Freeman be? Immensely rich, ex∣tremely old, I suppose, and you mean kindly to assist in making her will.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>How wildly you talk, Maria. Mrs. Free∣man is in the prime of life, and likely, I hope, to live long. She has been a widow about five years, and though universally admired, has chosen to pass the greatest part of that time, at her seat in Somer∣setshire, amidst her own and her late husband's friends and neighbours. There I first had the hap∣piness of her acquaintance, and there is she idolized for her goodness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so your hopeful scheme is to be as good as she, till you both fall into a lethargy together. Do you know, Charlotte, that there is nothing on earth so tiresome, as your good sort of people. They constantly set me a yawning, and will at any time serve to procure me as sound a slumber, as a dose of opium.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have a very different effect on me, Mrs. Frankly; they rather rouse my slumbering virtue. Emulation is the strongest incentive to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>O pray, Miss Melville, keep all this canting stuff for your good Mrs. Freeman, and do not stupify my senses with any more of your homilies—I am in an agony till she is out of the house.

But, come along, Master Bull, I have many matters, and money matters, to talk to you about; but those little twinklers put every thing out of my head. I shall want a thousand pounds for the good of the nation, this very night, d'ye see. I have promised to send it to Squeezem, and Ned Anderson never yet broke his word; and that's a bold expression for one of my age, let me tell you.

<P>I wish you had no other misfortune to complain of, Madam. Hearts are soon won, and soon lost. It is not love, but money, that should take up your thoughts at present.

'Tis fine talking, truly, about gratitude, and such stuff, because one won't spend their whole life in poverty with her—and that I foresee will be her fate, at last. In love with my Lord, forsooth! and every thing must be sacrificed to that girlish passion. Why, if the Governor should marry her to-morrow, 'tis ten to one but she'd be in the heighth of the mode in a week; in Doctor's Com∣mons in a fortnight; and a beggar before the honey-moon was over. But I'll prevent that mis∣chief, at least, by exposing her to his Excellency; and if he is bent upon matrimony, right or wrong,

there are people who think me handsomer than my mistress; and if he has but half as much sense, as money, he may possibly be of the same opinion too.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>MY search has hitherto been vain; but I have just now heard that my sister Freeman is expected soon in town; and if female friendships are not, as Lord Seaton says, an empty name, she will probably know something of my dear Char∣lotte's situation or abode. My engagement here, for this evening, puts it out of my power to enquire about her, to-night; but to morrow early I shall call at her house—Mrs. Markam!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mrs.</HI> MARKAM.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are welcome to England, Sir, but am sorry to acquaint you that my Lady happens to be so much indisposed, at present, that she must deny herself the pleasure of seeing you, for this evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am extremely sorry for your Lady's illness, Mrs. Markam. This sudden attack alarms me for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, by no means sudden, Sir. My Lady has been ill of the same disorder, ever since she has been married. I wonder, for my part, how she has been able to bear it so patiently; but she is convinced, at last, and I hope she'll pluck up a
<PB N="54" REF="74"/>
spirit now, and not suffer herself to be imposed upon, any longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not understand you. She seemed to be in perfect health, at dinner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, and if she was, she has had enough in conscience to have made her sick, since then. She'll believe me, another time, I fancy. I am not apt to be mistaken, whatever she may be. I am sure it is a scandalous thing for him that has such a charming Lady of his own, and has not been married quite two months yet—And that pretty demure Miss too, that my Lady was so fond of—But I never liked her, for my part, and al∣ways said that smooth water—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, Mrs. Markam, explain yourself— You alarm me, extremely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your honour's pardon—I forgot that you were in love with Miss Melville formerly, or to be sure I would not have said a word against her before you; but then I was so enraged with my Lord for slighting his good Lady, that I could not command myself—Though for certain it is no affair of mine, after all; and I must beg, Sir, that you would not mention any thing I have said, for the world; for my Lady would never forgive me, if she knew that I spoke of it to any one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am on the rack.
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
The only way then to insure my secrecy, Mrs. Markam, is by making me a thorough confidant; for as yet I do not comprehend what Miss Melville has to do with either your Lady's illness, or your Lord's unkindness. She quitted this house, I have been informed, before they were married; and they have both assured me they have neither of them seen her, since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does my Lord say so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="55" REF="75"/>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>He most certainly did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then great folks have a patent— I suppose; for as sure as I stand here, my Lady detected his Lordship and Miss Melville together, this very afternoon—And was that their first tête à tête, think you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>By heaven, I cannot give credit to this story—I should still think it impossible, though Lord Seaton and Miss Melville themselves were both to confess it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Lord, Sir, I am frightened out of my wits—It mayn't be true, as you say, after all. I could bite my tongue off for being so nimble. I wish heartily I had been dumb.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you have idly slandered Miss Melville, you deserve to be so for life. But I will have this matter explained immediately—Where is Lord Seaton?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>O dear, good Colonel, for heaven's sake don't be in a passion—there might be no harm done, to be sure—he was only kneeling at her feet, when my Lady happened to come into the room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Insidious, base dissembler!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to be sure he has a dissembling tongue, and every one thought that he was in love with my Lady, before he married her, except her∣self—But she, it seems, had her suspicions that he liked Miss better, and that made my Lady so cold to her, that she hardly opened her lips to her for a great while before she left the house.
<STAGE>(<HI>A rapping at the door.</HI>)</STAGE>
Here's my Lord a coming, I fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mark.</SPEAKER>
<P>O dear, merciful Colonel, have com∣passion, and don't betray me now. Consider I am but a poor servant, Sir, and indeed Miss Melville was always very kind to me; and if your honour
<PB N="56" REF="76"/>
will but forgive me, this once, I promise never to speak another word against her, while I have breath —But I must run, Sir.
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>

<P>And I am glad, my Lord, that we are met, and that you are in such a communicative disposition, as I have a question to ask you, that must be answered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Must, Colonel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, my Lord, it must be resolved—Where is Miss Melville?</P>

<P>That question, Colonel, neither must, nor can, be resolved, by me—I know not where she is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can it be possible you should be mean enough to attempt to screen an act of perfidy and baseness, beneath the flimsy subterfuge of false∣hood! But 'twill not do, my Lord; we must not part, till you inform me where Miss Melville is; and from her lips, which used to be the oracles of truth, I will learn all the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>You really astonish me, Sir, with a language as little becoming you to use, as for me to bear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>The man who has deserved such language ought to bear it. Courage and falsehood never
<PB N="57" REF="77"/>
dwelt together; and when the mind is so far de∣based, as to forge a tale to impose upon a friend, all pretence to bravery is but a jest—a madman's phrenzy, or a coward's rage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can endure this insolence, no longer. This roof is your protection, for the present, Sir; but quit it instantly, and let us quickly meet where the vile term you have now used, may light on him who most deserves it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall find me ready, Sir. How was it possible for him to know that I had seen Miss Melville? When I came in the servant told me my wife was ill, and had not seen the Colonel— She could not, therefore, nay, she would not, tell him—But it matters not, at present, who informed him. I never meant to injure him. I did not know of his passion for Charlotte, till after I was married; and had I, on his return, acknowledged each circumstance that ever passed between us, he could not have condemned me. How weak and culpable is want of frankness? This alone has in∣volved me in all my difficulties.</P>

</LETTER>
<PB N="58" REF="78"/>
Despicable, yet unhappy woman! The artful mean∣ness of her conduct, this evening, has sunk her below my pity. This marriage that she hints at, is thrown out merely to draw me to her lure—But 'tis in vain, for I shall never see, or think of her, again. Indeed I have something more material to take up my thoughts, at present—This hasty con∣duct of Ramsay's distresses me extremely—But 'tis first necessary that I should clear Miss Melville's conduct to my wife—They must be mutual sufferers by the continuance of Lady Seaton's mistake; and she, at least, deserves all my endeavours to restore her peace. Though I cannot account for her follow∣ing me to Mrs. Frankly's this evening. But grant it were a fault, 'tis her first to me, and mine I con∣fess to have been manifold against her—Who's there?</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> WATERS.</STAGE>
<P>Ask Markam if her Lady be in her dressing-room, and let her know that I desire to speak with her.
<STAGE>[Exit Waters.]</STAGE>
In what different points of view do the same objects present themselves, at different times, before us! The seriousness of my present situation has removed the veil which the false no∣tions and loose manners of the present world had spread over my thoughts and actions. I see now the impropriety, nay, the inhumanity, of my whole conduct to Lady Seaton, and wish, though perhaps too late, that it may yet be in my power to make her every atonement.</P>

<P>You seem alarmed, Madam; but lay aside your fears—You have nothing to apprehend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="59" REF="79"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>The consciousness, my Lord, of having offended you, though most inadvertently, must certainly render me unhappy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>The extraordinary step you took this evening, Madam, appears to be but little consistent with the delicacy of the sentiment you now express.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you will condescend to hear my motives for it, my Lord, you will not judge so hardly of me. I then thought Miss Melville in∣nocent—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, by heaven, she is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam, I repeat it; and though to support my assertion, I shall be obliged to accuse myself, yet will I do her merit the justice it deserves. On my return from Italy, at the same moment I beheld ye both—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stop there, my Lord—too well, alas! I know who then won the preference in your af∣fections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Passion is involuntary, Madam; but I had hopes that reason, which directed my addresses to you, would have conquered that partiality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible, my Lord, I fear; and blushing own, that though I perceived your attach∣ment to my rival, I yet nourished in my breast the same to you—By vain self-love misled, I fondly thought I might perhaps inspire the tenderness I felt—My weakness has been punished as it ought!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>You judge yourself too severely, Madam—'Tis I alone am culpable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>We both deceived ourselves, my Lord, and both have been to blame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not wish, Madam, to involve you in my errors, and am sincerely sorry you should have suffered by them—Let me now proceed—
<PB N="60" REF="80"/>
After some unsuccessful struggles with myself, I at length determined to confess my prepossession for Miss Melville, and break off the treaty with you— I wrote to her, accordingly, on the subject—Her answer was consistent with that worth which dig∣nifies her whole conduct. She owned ingenuously that her heart had been preingaged, but also gene∣rously assured me, that were it perfectly free, she could never have availed herself of my preference in her favour, to your prejudice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generous, charming girl! how have I injured her!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have reason to believe that she left this house, in hopes her absence might efface my passion, and suffer your beauty and merits, Madam, to produce the effect they must naturally have had upon a disengaged heart. From that moment, till this evening, and that by accident merely, I declare I never saw or heard from her; and was, at that instant, only intreating her return to you again. If therefore you have conceived one doubt to her dishonour, banish it for ever from your mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never had a doubt, my Lord, of Charlotte's worth, nor was it jealousy, but friend∣ship, that brought me to be a witness of that scene which first disturbed my confidence in her—But you have now restored it, and if I knew where to direct my course, I would this moment fly to intreat her pardon, as I do yours; for I have injured you beyond the hope of an atonement—'Twas selfish vanity inspired the cruel wish of being yours, with∣out the power of paying back the happiness I re∣ceived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Madam, do not speak so hum∣bly—The polite attentions which I paid you, joined to your own personal charms and merits, might,
<PB N="61" REF="81"/>
without vanity, have made you think that you pos∣sessed my love; whilst I, false to your happiness, as well as to my own, knew but too well I had not then a heart to give.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>In vain, my Lord, you kindly strive to set my mind at peace, and reconcile me to an error that has been fatal to us both, I fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am too sensible how far I have wronged you, to bear this generous contest; but may I hope the frankness I have shewn, in thus discovering to you the weakness of my conduct, will at least assure you of my confidence and esteem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ask no more, my Lord, and shall ever study to deserve them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>The kindness and condescension of that speech, Lady Seaton, merits much more, and has awaked my tenderness—But is that worthy your acceptance, now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>The world were well exchanged for such a treasure!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Accept then, thou most deserving of thy sex, a heart more surely thine, than if it had first been led to you by passion only, for that is liable to change; but kindness and worth, like yours, must naturally inspire unfading love.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Frankly!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why yes, my Lord, the pretty widow, at whose house we happened to meet, this evening —she was mightily concerned for my niece, I assure you; for she is very strict, and was greatly out of sorts at your behaviour. And by the way you ought to be a little more cautious in your conduct, and not expose yourself, by pursuing a girl into a strange house, d'ye see—</P>

<PB N="64" REF="84"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much obliged to you for your advice, Sir. But pray will you give me leave to ask you by what means you became acquainted with this same paragon of virtue?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why my good friend, honest Sam. Bull, the broker, having in the course of our business together, conceived a particular regard for me, introduced me to his niece, some time ago—she has a jointure of six hundred <HI>per annum,</HI> and he was plaguily afraid that some young fop might run away with her, and use her ill; he therefore recommended me as one that would be a kind of a father to her, d'ye see—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that I do see, very plainly, in∣deed—But pray is your good friend Mr. Bull a broker for marriages, as well as stocks, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, my Lord, he made no matter of business of it, in the least; for tho' he under∣stands making a bargain as well as any man in the Alley, he never once talked of a settlement—all, all is left to my own honour—but he knows his man, that's pretty plain, I think—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very apparent, truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think your Lordship can be ready to attend upon us to church by nine, to-morrow morning?</P>

<P>To-morrow, Governor!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, to-morrow is to be the happy day, nephew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>As circumstances are drawing so near a conclusion, Sir, I will be free enough to tell you, that you must not think of Mrs. Frankly, for a wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that is frank and free enough, to be sure, my Lord; but I must have some better rea∣son than a mere <HI>ipse dixit,</HI> as Nicholas calls it. I
<PB N="65" REF="85"/>
have always been a man of honour, to the ladies, my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>I approve your chivalry, Governor, but with this reserve, that you are sure your Ladies be also Ladies of honour, on their part; lest your knight-errantry should be dishonoured by your ga∣lantry; and as it is happily not yet too late, I may venture to tell you that your present Dulcinea is totally devoid of such a character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not too late! Ay, truly, but it is, tho', for I have not even so much as an acknowledg∣ment under her hand, for five hundred pounds I lent her, this very morning, to fee her lawyers; and I gave her a pair of ear-rings, not a month ago, that cost me five hundred pounds more. But if she has no honour, 'tis well she has some land, at least. Bull assures me that her jointure is a good six hundred, <HI>per annum.</HI></P>
</SP>

<P>What! upon his estate, Governor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard he had one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I either, I promise you; and I rather doubt his having a foot of ground to stand upon, in the Alley, much longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't say so, my Lord; you'll break my heart. If Bull has waddled out a lame duck, I may be an undone man, for aught I see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Matters may not be so bad as you apprehend; but at any rate I think you have reason to rejoice at having escaped being Mrs. Frankly's dupe, at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rejoice! at what? that I have been de∣ceived and disappointed in the woman I had set my heart upon, when it is too late in life to think of mending myself elsewhere. But I'll have my money and my jewels from her, if they are to be had, d'ye see, before we part.</P>

<P>I am struck dumb with amazement! But, if Bull be not her uncle, why should she bestow him her jewels, d'ye see?</P>

<P>Lord, Sir, there may be closer connec∣tions, than relations, I suppose, in the world.</P>

<P>I scorn to speak scandal, Sir; but if he be, he is not her only one, I can assure you; for Lord Seaton is another—Tho' the passion happens unluckily to be all on the wrong side there, I can answer for it—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>My hair stands an end at her wickedness! As for you, girl, there take my purse, as a reward for your honesty, d'ye see—but never let me see you, or any thing that belongs to your mistress, more.</P>

<P>O, Sir, you have made a fine hand of your affairs, with your boasted punctuality—<HI>We have no bonds, in India,</HI> forsooth. Commend me to the persons who are not ashamed to set their names to a piece of stamped paper. They are the men to do business with.</P>

<P>Why, what can be the meaning of all this! Did not Bull carry you the money, last night?

And were you not to set out with the sun, this morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squeez.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, really, Sir, Mr. Bull did not bring me a farthing; but I believe he has carried that, and himself off together, by the light of the moon; for he was not to be found at his own house, at day-break, when I called there; and I fancy that neither sun or moon will ever see him in England again.</P>

<P>You ought not to have doubted it, Sir, nor have ventured to insult a woman of honour upon the testimony of a wretch, whom common sense might have informed you I should not have discarded, had it been in her power to have hurt me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to be sure I might have thought of that, Madam, but you can't conceive what a pack of plausible lies she told me.—She said you were in love too with Lord Seaton, who despised you— nay his Lordship spoke to your disadvantage him∣self, also, and first cautioned me against marrying you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>But surely now any person of common sense, Sir, would have considered his en∣deavour to prevent it, as a proof rather of love,

than of hate—I soon perceived he had gained Lucy over to his interest, which was the chief reason of my discharging her; in revenge for which she in∣vented all those abominable stories, and you were weak enough to believe them.</P>

<P>You trespass on my fondness, which pleads your cause so strongly; for had you less love, you would have had less jealousy; and the excess of one should ever atone for the vio∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ce of the other.

I am impatient till all this mistery is explained, that I may have an op∣portunity of clearing my conduct to my amiable friend. If the weight only of an imputed crime be so hard to bear, what a burden must real guilt be! Lord Seaton said something, I think, of Co∣lonel Ramsay.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can this mean! Surely 'tis you, Sir, who have forgotten both yourself and me, or after two tedious years of absence it were not pos∣sible we should meet thus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy, Madam, that the absence of an injured lover does not appear tedious to those who enjoy the presence of a favoured one. Lord Sea∣ton, Madam, has sufficiently consoled you for my loss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Seaton!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem surprized; but I am too well informed of your connection. However, Madam, I did not mean to upbraid, or intrude upon you, now. I came here only to see my sister, and have but a short time to spare to her, from a very par∣ticular and pressing engagement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be your engagements what they may, Sir, I have a right to expect you should explain the meaning of your present conduct towards me, as far at least as it respects my character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>You speak, Madam, as if you thought you still retained the power you once had over me; but you have forfeited it, and I am no longer now the dupe of my own weakness, or of your deceit.</P>

<P>O Ramsay, how have I deserved this treatment?</P>

I wish not, Madam, to offend or wound you—you are mistress of your own actions, and all I shall further say, upon this subject, is, that had your new en∣gagement
<PB N="79" REF="99"/>
been more for your own honour, your perfidy might have been more pardonable to one who respected your character, as much as he ad∣mired your person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not comprehend you, Sir. What engagements have I entered into, inconsistent with that preference I had too hastily, I fear, confessed for you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>The ties of hearts like mine are formed by honour only, Madam, nor could I ever take advantage of a woman's fondness to hurt her inno∣cence, or wound her fame. Lord Seaton is a more modern kind of lover, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Seaton again! What can you mean by him? Is he not married, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>For his unhappy lady's sake, as well as yours, I would he were not. The woman I once loved might then have had some excuse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can sustain this injury no longer—Have you not known me from my earliest youth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam, 'tis plain I did not. My fond imagination had indeed conceived a fair idea from Miss Melville's form—a heart replete with honour, love and constancy! virtues too seldom found in your frail sex, and it was vanity in me to hope I should engross so rare a treasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>What have I done to forfeit your opi∣nion? But I will condescend to waive the pride of injured virtue, and tell you, Sir, that you are much deceived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I have been so, I own, but the delirium's fled. My time is precious, now—I came hither on other purpose, Madam, and neither thought, or wished to have met you here.</P>

<P>Can it be possible the time should come, when Ramsay should not wish to see me!</P>
</SP>

<P>Too many hours have I, alas, devoted to the fond impatience of seeing her I loved.—'Twas the reward I promised to myself, for toil, for dan∣ger, for the still greater pangs of absence—and how have you repaid my anxious hope!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the most constant, unabated tender∣ness and esteem could have repaid the sufferings you pretend, I should not now be deemed your debtor; nor would a lover, such as you would seem, have listened to a tale invented by some fiend to blast my honour. O Ramsay! 'tis now, alas, too plain, you never loved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>(I know not what to think—she speaks with confidence, and looks with innocence—yet Lady Seaton surely could not invent a falshood. Perhaps I have been too rash; and yet I have not time to repair my error, now. My honour is else∣where too far engaged, at present, and the time draws near.

If ever we should meet again, Miss Melville, you will be then convinced that I have loved.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am perplexed—What can all this mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It means, my Charlotte, that my too hasty credulity has hurried me into a fault; which I can never hope you should forgive, the suspecting truth and virtue such as yours.</P>

<P>To doubt of pardon, on repentance, ag∣gravates the crime; for who that pretends not to perfection in themselves, shall dare to be impla∣cable to another's sailings. But still I am in the dark and on the rack, to know how all this strange confusion has been conjured up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>It arose intirely from my indiscretion in letting drop to Markam my having met you at Mrs. Frankly's. She happened to see the Colonel immediately after, and informed him of all, and perhaps more than she knew.</P>

<P>And I am ready to indulge you.— Unhappy at your absence, my dear Charlotte, I ordered my servant to make every possible inquiry to find you out.—He saw you, by chance, going into Mrs. Frankly's, and was informed you lived there. I immediately flew to request your com∣pany, in hopes of agreeably surprising both you and the Colonel with an unexpected interview, at my house.

<P>Why, my Lord, I have both questions and commands to propose to you, d'ye see, tho' I think you have been more inclined to a game of cross-purposes, than any thing else, lately. But in plain English, I think you have behaved very ungenerously in this affair of my marriage, let me tell you.</P>

I shall burst with rage.— There never was such a villainous proceeding. A rascally coachmaker, a varnishing Scoundrel, I think that's his name, my Lord, threatens to arrest me for a debt I never contracted, because the fel∣low thought I had been married, this morning, d'ye see.—It would have been a pretty sort of in∣cident, truly, to have happened on one's wedding-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>I apprehend, Governor, that this would not have been the only circumstance of the kind you would have had to celebrate your nup∣tials, if you had married that lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, no, I did not fight Gentoos, Ma∣rattoes, Seapoys, and climates, d'ye see, to be bamboozled out of my money, at home.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Except by a pretty woman, Go∣vernor.</P>
</SP>

<P>Nor by her neither, when I find her false; and so Mr. Vanish may arrest Mrs. Frankly, as soon as he pleases, for me.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="88" REF="108"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, that debt I shall take upon myself, with pleasure, for the happiness I have re∣ceived, through Mrs. Frankly's means, of know∣ing and esteeming Lady Seaton as I ought. Be∣sides, a woman in distress, however incurred, is always intitled to the compassion and protection of a man of honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, for that matter, my Lord, let me have but a little of my own way, d'ye see, and I can be as liberal as the best of you. I am pas∣sionate, but not severe; and so I forgive the injury, and shall discharge that debt; for me∣thinks a man's mind and his means must be mi∣serably poor, indeed, who cannot afford to give, and forgive, too—</P>

<P>His tastes and manners may be fo∣reign, perhaps, Colonel, but his good-nature and generosity are true English staple. A Briton need never go a trafficking for principles.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, take me as I am—I have bought some wisdom for myself, at present, for I shall not so readily believe that the women are in love with me, now, as they might have been, some thirty years ago.
