<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>THOUGH wild our theme, the grave historian's page</L>
<L>Hath sanctify'd the tale through ev'ry age.</L>
<L>Who hath not heard of Argo sent from Greece,</L>
<L>Of Jason's labours for the golden fleece,</L>
<L>And fond Medea's ill-requited aid</L>
<L>To that false hero, who his vows betray'd?</L>
<L>In ev'ry clime, where learned Muses reign,</L>
<L>The stage hath known Medea's mournful strain,</L>
<L>Hath giv'n the flying car, and magic rod</L>
<L>To her, th' avow'd descendant of a god.</L>
<L>The storms of trouble, which afflict the great,</L>
<L>Teach private life to prise its tranquil state.</L>
<L>That truth the moral of our fable shows</L>
<L>Too well in scenes of unexampled woes,</L>
<L>Which here will ravage an exalted breast</L>
<L>Of merit conscious, and with shame opprest;</L>
<L>Where love and fury, grief and madness join'd</L>
<L>O'erturn the structure of a godlike mind.</L>
<L>Pow'r, wisdom, science, and her birth divine</L>
<L>In vain to shield her from distress combine;</L>
<L>Nor wisdom, pow'r, nor science yield relief;</L>
<L>Her potent wand can vanquish all, but grief:</L>
<L>In vain her winged chariot sweeps the air</L>
<L>To shun that mightier sorceress, despair.</L>
<L>The characters and passions hence exprest</L>
<L>Are all submitted to the feeling breast;</L>
<L>Let ancient story justify the rest.</L>

<SPEAKER>LYCANDER</SPEAKER>
<STAGE> seeing THEANO advance from the temple of JUNO.</STAGE>
<L>THAT form divine, by all rever'd and lov'd,</L>
<L>Moves from the temple. On her pensive brow</L>
<L>Sits holy care with gentleness and grace,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THEANO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Imperial Juno in an awful vision</L>
<L>This morn presented to my wondring sight</L>
<L>The shapes of strangers by distress pursu'd;</L>
<L>Whom to the refuge of this holy place</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="6"/>I must receive obedient to her charge:</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LYCANDER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ten well-measur'd strokes</L>
<L>Of her swift oars will reach the shore below:</L>
<L>But hear my errand. Creon knows, thy altar</L>
<L>Unclad with garlands still proclaims thy firmness</L>
<L>Against his daughter's marriage; then prepare</L>
<L>Thy hallow'd eye to meet his threat'ning brow;</L>
<L>Fence thy chaste ear against his impious vaunts,</L>
<L>Which urge th' example of Almighty Jove</L>
<L>For his own thirst of empire.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THEANO.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>Say to Creon,</STAGE>
<L>Kings should aspire to imitate the Gods</L>
<L>Not in their pow'r, but goodness; human virtues</L>
<L>More nigh to Heav'n's perfection may be rais'd,</L>
<L>Than human grandeur: Jove derides the toil</L>
<L>Of mortal pow'r, but smiles on righteous deeds.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LYCANDER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thus would I speak, Theano, could my words</L>
<L>And thoughts be tun'd in harmony like thine;</L>
<L>But danger breaks that union in a palace,</L>
<L>And strains the tongue to discord with the heart:</L>
<L>Then pacify thy goddess, when the king</L>
<L>Exacts my service, if discretion wears</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="7"/>A mask of duty; kindly thou impute</L>
<L>Blame to my station, and absolve Lycander.</L>
<L>But look; yon vessel hath discharg'd its train,</L>
<L>Who climb the hill with aged steps and slow.</L>
<L>Nay turn thy eyes; a second troop of strangers</L>
<L>March through the city. Sable is their garb,</L>

<L>Your suit is granted.</L>

<SPEAKER>FIRST COLCHIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>From the banks</L>

<L>Ill-guided Colchians to the walls of Corinth.</L>
<L>On king Aeetes' daughter we attend,</L>
<L>That boast of Asia, to the Sun ally'd,</L>

<L>Her husband left her on a lonely pillow:</L>

<SPEAKER>FIRST COLCHIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>How swift are evil tidings! While our keel</L>

<L>This day to wed the daughter of your monarch.</L>

<L>If heav'n prevent not. Through the solemn shade</L>
<L>Direct thy view. That high-rais'd altar note</L>
<L>Close by the fountain. Thither lead your princess.</L>
<L>This is a refuge, which no regal pride</L>
<L>High-swoln with pow'r, nor multitude inflam'd</L>
<L>By madding discord, nor invader's rapine</L>
<L>Have e'er profan'd. Return. Yon palace opens.</L>
