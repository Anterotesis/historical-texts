<HEAD>THE TIMES.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE Time hath been, a Boyish, Blushing Time,</L>
<L>When Modesty was scarcely held a crime,</L>
<L>When the most Wicked had some touch of grace,</L>
<L>And trembled to meet Virtue face to face,</L>
<L>When Those, who, in the cause of Sin grown grey,</L>
<L>Had serv'd her without grudging day by day,</L>
<L>Were yet so weak an awkward shame to feel,</L>
<L>And strove that glorious service to conceal,</L>
<L>We, better bred, and than our Sires more wise,</L>
<L>Such paultry narrowness of soul despise,</L>
<L>To Virtue ev'ry mean pretence disclaim,</L>
<L>Lay bare our crimes, and glory in our shame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="3"/>
<L>Time was, e'er Temperance had fled the realm;</L>
<L>E're Luxury sat guttling at the helm</L>
<L>From meal to meal, without one moment's space</L>
<L>Reserv'd for business, or allow'd for grace;</L>
<L>E're Vanity had so far conquer'd Sense</L>
<L>To make us all wild rivals in expence,</L>
<L>To make one Fool strive to outvye another,</L>
<L>And ev'ry coxcomb dress against his brother;</L>
<L>E're banish'd Industry had left our shores,</L>
<L>And Labour was by Pride kick'd out of doors;</L>
<L>E're Idleness prevail'd sole Queen in Courts,</L>
<L>Or only yielded to a rage for sports;</L>
<L>E're each weak mind was with externals caught,</L>
<L>And Dissipation held the place of Thought;</L>
<L>E're gambling Lords in Vice so far were gone</L>
<L>To cog the die, and bid the Sun look on;</L>
<L>E're a great Nation, not less just than free,</L>
<L>Was made a beggar by Oeconomy;</L>
<L>E're rugged Honesty was out of vogue,</L>
<L>E're Fashion stamp'd her sanction on the rogue;</L>
<L>Time was, that Men had conscience, that they made</L>
<L>Scruples to owe, what never could be paid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
<L>Was One then found, however high his name,</L>
<L>So far above his fellows damn'd to shame,</L>
<L>Who dar'd abuse, and falsify his trust,</L>
<L>Who, being great, yet dar'd to be unjust,</L>
<L>Shunn'd like a plague, or but at distance view'd,</L>
<L>He walk'd the crouded streets in Solitude,</L>
<L>Nor could his rank, and station in the land</L>
<L>Bribe one mean knave to take him by the hand.</L>
<L>Such rigid maxims (O, might such revive</L>
<L>To keep expiring Honesty alive)</L>
<L>Made rogues, all other hopes of fame denied,</L>
<L>Not just thro' principle, be just thro' pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Times, more polish'd, wear a diff'rent face;</L>
<L>Debts are an Honour; Payment a disgrace.</L>
<L>Men of weak minds, high-plac'd on Folly's list,</L>
<L>May gravely tell us Trade cannot subsist,</L>
<L>Nor all those Thousands who're in Trade employ'd,</L>
<L>If faith 'twixt Man and Man is once destroy'd.</L>
<L>Why—be it so—We in that point accord,</L>
<L>But what is Trade, and Tradesmen to a Lord.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FABER, from day to day, from year to year,</L>
<L>Hath had the cries of tradesmen in his ear,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="5"/>
Of tradesmen by his Villainy betray'd,</L>
<L>And, vainly seeking Justice, bankrupts made.</L>
<L>What is't to FABER? Lordly as before,</L>
<L>He sits at ease, and lives to ruin more.</L>
<L>Fix'd at his door, as motionless as stone,</L>
<L>Begging, but only begging for their own,</L>
<L>Unheard they stand, or only heard by Those,</L>
<L>Those slaves in Livery, who mock their woes.</L>
<L>What is't to FABER? he continues great,</L>
<L>Lives on in grandeur, and runs out in state.</L>
<L>The helpless Widow, wrung with deep despair,</L>
<L>In bitterness of soul, pours forth her pray'r,</L>
<L>Hugging her starving babes, with streaming eyes,</L>
<L>And calls down vengeance, vengeance from the skies.</L>
<L>What is't to FABER? he stands safe and clear</L>
<L>Heav'n can commence no legal action here,</L>
<L>And on his breast a mighty plate he wears,</L>
<L>A plate more firm than triple brass, which bears</L>
<L>The name of PRIVILEGE, 'gainst vulgar awe;</L>
<L>He feels no Conscience, and he fears no Law.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor think, acquainted with small knaves alone,</L>
<L>Who have not shame outliv'd, and grace outgrown,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="6"/>
The great World hidden from thy reptile view,</L>
<L>That on such Men, to whom Contempt is due,</L>
<L>Contempt shall fall, and their vile Author's name</L>
<L>Recorded stand thro' all the land of shame.</L>
<L>No—to his porch, like Persians to the Sun,</L>
<L>Behold contending crowds of Courtiers run;</L>
<L>See, to his aid what noble troops advance,</L>
<L>All sworn to keep his crimes in Countenance.</L>
<L>Nor wonder at it—They partake the charge,</L>
<L>As small their Conscience, and their debts as large.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Propp'd by such Clients, and without controul</L>
<L>From all that's honest in the human soul,</L>
<L>In Grandeur mean, with insolence unjust,</L>
<L>Whilst none but knaves can praise, and Fools will trust,</L>
<L>Caress'd and Courted, FABER seems to stand</L>
<L>A mighty Pillar in a guilty land.</L>
<L>And (a sad truth to which succeeding times</L>
<L>Will scarce give credit, when 'tis told in rimes)</L>
<L>Did not strict Honour with a jealous eye</L>
<L>Watch round the Throne, did not true Piety,</L>
<L>(Who, link'd with Honour for the noblest ends,</L>
<L>Ranks none but honest Men amongst her friends)</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="7"/>
Forbid us to be crush'd with such a weight,</L>
<L>He might in time be Minister of State.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But why enlarge I on such petty crimes?</L>
<L>They might have shock'd the faith of former times.</L>
<L>But now are held as Nothing—We begin,</L>
<L>Where our Sires ended, and improve in Sin,</L>
<L>Rack our invention, and leave nothing new</L>
<L>In vice, and folly for our sons to do.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor deem this censure hard; there's not a place</L>
<L>Most consecrate to purposes of grace,</L>
<L>Which Vice hath not polluted; none so high,</L>
<L>But with bold pinion She hath dar'd to fly,</L>
<L>And build there for her pleasure; none so low,</L>
<L>But She hath crept into it, made it know,</L>
<L>And feel her pow'r; in Courts, in Camps She reigns,</L>
<L>O'er sober Citizens, and simple Swains,</L>
<L>E'en in our temples She hath fix'd her throne,</L>
<L>And 'bove God's holy altars plac'd her own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>More to increase the horrour of our State,</L>
<L>To make her Empire lasting as 'tis great,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="8"/>
To make us in full-grown Perfection feel</L>
<L>Curses which neither Art, nor Time can heal,</L>
<L>All Shame discarded, all remains of pride,</L>
<L>MEANNESS sits crown'd, and triumphs by her side.</L>
<L>MEANNESS, who gleans out of the human mind</L>
<L>Those few good seeds which Vice had left behind,</L>
<L>Those seeds which might in time to Virtue tend,</L>
<L>And leaves the Soul without a pow'r to mend;</L>
<L>MEANNESS, at sight of whom, with brave disdain</L>
<L>The breast of Manhood swells, but swells in vain,</L>
<L>Before whom Honour makes a forc'd retreat,</L>
<L>And Freedom is compell'd to quit her seat;</L>
<L>MEANNESS which, like that mark by bloody CAIN</L>
<L>Borne in his forehead for a brother slain,</L>
<L>God, in his great and all-subduing rage,</L>
<L>Ordains the standing mark of this vile age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The venal Heroe trucks his fame for gold,</L>
<L>The Patriot's virtue for a place is sold,</L>
<L>The Statesman bargains for his Country's shame,</L>
<L>And for preserment Priests their God disclaim.</L>
<L>Worn out with lust, her day of letch'ry o'er,</L>
<L>The Mother trains the daughter which She bore</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="9"/>
In her own paths; The Father aids the plan,</L>
<L>And, when the Innocent is ripe for Man,</L>
<L>Sells her to some old Letcher for a wife,</L>
<L>And makes her an Adulteress for life,</L>
<L>Or in the papers bids his name appear,</L>
<L>And advertises for a L—;</L>
<L>Husband and Wife (whom Av'rice must applaud)</L>
<L>Agree to save the charge of Pimp and Bawd;</L>
<L>Those parts they play themselves, a frugal pair,</L>
<L>And share the infamy, the gain to share,</L>
<L>Well-pleas'd to find, when They the profits tell,</L>
<L>That they have play'd the whore and rogue so well.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor are these things (which might imply a spark</L>
<L>Of Shame still left) transacted in the dark.</L>
<L>No—to the Public they are open laid,</L>
<L>And carried on like any other trade,</L>
<L>Scorning to mince damnation, and too proud</L>
<L>To work the works of darkness in a cloud,</L>
<L>In fullest vigour Vice maintains her sway:</L>
<L>Free are her Marts, and open at noon-day.</L>
<L>MEANNESS, now wed to IMPUDENCE, no more</L>
<L>In darkness skulks, and trembles as of yore</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="10"/>
When the Light breaks upon her coward eye;</L>
<L>Boldly She stalks on earth, and to the sky</L>
<L>Lists her proud head, nor fears least time abate,</L>
<L>And turn her Husband's love to canker'd hate,</L>
<L>Since Fate, to make them more sincerely one,</L>
<L>Hath crown'd their loves with MOUNTAGUE their son.</L>
<L>A Son, so like his Dam, so like his Sire,</L>
<L>With all the Mother's craft, the Father's fire,</L>
<L>An Image so express in ev'ry part,</L>
<L>So like in all bad qualities of heart,</L>
<L>That, had They fifty children, He alone</L>
<L>Would stand as Heir Apparent to the throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With our own Island vices not content,</L>
<L>We rob our neighbours on the Continent,</L>
<L>Dance Europe round, and visit ev'ry court</L>
<L>To ape their follies, and their crimes import.</L>
<L>To diff'rent lands for diff'rent sins we roam,</L>
<L>And, richly freighted, bring our cargoe home,</L>
<L>Nobly industrious to make vice appear</L>
<L>In her sull State, and perfect only here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To HOLLAND, where Politeness ever reigns,</L>
<L>Where primitive Sincerity remains,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="11"/>
And makes a stand, where Freedom in her course</L>
<L>Hath left her name, tho' she hath lost her force</L>
<L>In that, as other lands, where simple Trade</L>
<L>Was never in the garb of Fraud array'd,</L>
<L>Where Av'rice never dar'd to shew his head,</L>
<L>Where, like a smiling Cherub, Mercy, led</L>
<L>By Reason, blesses the sweet-blooded race,</L>
<L>And Cruelty could never find a place,</L>
<L>To HOLLAND for that Charity we roam,</L>
<L>Which happily begins, and ends at home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FRANCE, in return for peace and pow'r restor'd,</L>
<L>For all those Countries, which the Heroe's sword</L>
<L>Unprofitably purchas'd, idly thrown</L>
<L>Into her lap, and made once more her own.</L>
<L>FRANCE hath afforded large and rich supplies</L>
<L>Of Vanities full-trimm'd, of polish'd lies,</L>
<L>Of soothing flatteries, which thro' the ears</L>
<L>Steal to, and melt the heart, of slavish fears</L>
<L>Which break the Spirit, and of abject fraud—</L>
<L>For which alas! we need not send abroad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SPAIN gives us Pride—which SPAIN to all the earth,</L>
<L>May largely give, nor fear herself a dearth—</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="12"/>
Gives us that Jealousy, which, born of fear</L>
<L>And mean distrust, grows not by Nature here—</L>
<L>Gives us that Superstition, which pretends</L>
<L>By the worst means to serve the best of ends—</L>
<L>That Cruelty, which, stranger to the brave,</L>
<L>Dwells only with the Coward, and the Slave,</L>
<L>That Cruelty, which led her Christian bands</L>
<L>With more than savage rage o'er savage lands,</L>
<L>Bade her without remorse whole countries thin,</L>
<L>And hold of nought, but Mercy, as a sin.</L>

<L>Sends us a Fiend, and LEGION is his name.</L>
<L>The Farce of greatness, without being great,</L>

<L>Vain and unthinking Stripling! When the glass</L>

<L>Curse, curse thy beauty, for It leads to shame.</L>
<L>When thy hot Lord, to work Thee to his end,</L>

<L>On those gay, gaudy trappings, which adorn</L>

Or why take refuge in the house of pray'r,</L>

<L>Trust not Old Age, which will thy faith betray;</L>
<L><HI>Saint</HI> SOCRATES is still a Goat, tho' grey;</L>

In Afric's wilds—'mongst them that refuge find,</L>
