<P>THE CITIZEN of the WORLD; OR LETTERS FROM A CHINESE PHILOSOPHER, Residing in LONDON, TO HIS FRIENDS in the EAST.</P>
<P>VOLUME the SECOND.</P>
<P>LONDON: Printed for the AUTHOR; AND Sold by J. NEWBERY and W. BRISTOW, in St. Paul's Church-yard; J. LEAKE and W. FREDERICK, at Bath; B. COLLINS, at Salisbury; and A. M. SMART and Co. at Reading. MDCCLXII.</P>

<HEAD>THE EDITOR's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE schoolmen had formerly a very exact way of computing the abilities of their Saints or authors. Escobar, for instance, was said to have learning as five, genius as four, and gravity as seven. Caramuel was greater than he. His learning was as eight, his genius as six, and his gravity as thirteen. Were I to estimate the merits of our Chinese Philosopher by the same scale, I would not hesitate to state his genius still higher; but as to his learning and gravity, these I think might safely be marked as nine hundred and ninety nine, within one degree of absolute frigidity.</P>
<P>Yet upon his first appearance here, many were angry not to find him as ignorant as a Tripoline ambassador, or an Envoy from Mujac. They were surprized to find a man born so far from London, that school of prudence and wisdom, endued even with a moderate capacity. They expressed the same surprize at his knowlege that the Chinese do at ours. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Comte, Vol. 1. p. 210.</NOTE> <HI>How comes it,</HI> said they, <HI>that the
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
Europeans, so remote from China, think with so much justice and precision? They have never read our books, they scarcely know even our letters, and yet they talk and reason just as we do.</HI> The truth is, the Chinese and we are pretty much alike. Different de∣grees of refinement, and not of distance, mark the distinctions among mankind. Savages of the most opposite climates, have all but one character of improvidence and rapacity; and tutored nations, however separate, make use of the very same me∣thods to procure refined enjoyment.</P>
<P>The distinctions of polite nations are few; but such as are peculiar to the Chinese, appear in every page of the following correspondence. The me∣taphors and allusions are all drawn from the East. Their formality our author carefully preserves. Ma∣ny of their favourite tenets in morals are illustrated. The Chinese are always concise, so is he. Simple, so is he. The Chinese are grave and sententious, so is he. But in one particular, the resemblance is peculiarly striking: the Chinese are often dull; and so is he. Nor has my assistance been want∣ing. We are told in an old romance of a certain knight errant and his horse who con∣tracted an intimate friendship. The horse most usually bore the knight, but, in cases of extra∣ordinary dispatch, the knight returned the fa∣vour, and carried his horse. Thus in the intima∣cy between my author and me, he has usually given
<PB N="v" REF="6"/>
me a lift of his Eastern sublimity, and I have some∣times given him a return of my colloquial ease.</P>
<P>Yet it appears strange in this season of panegy∣ric, when scarce an author passes unpraised either by his friends or himself, that such merit as our Philosopher's should be forgotten. While the epi∣thets of ingenious, copious, elaborate, and re∣fined, are lavished among the mob, like medals at a coronation, the lucky prizes fall on every side, but not one on him. I could on this occasion make myself melancholly, by considering the ca∣priciousness of public taste, or the mutability of for∣tune; but during this fit of morality, lest my rea∣der should sleep, I'll take a nap myself, and when I awake tell him my dream.</P>
<P>I imagined the Thames was frozen over, and I stood by its side. Several booths were erected upon the ice, and I was told by one of the spectators, that FASHION FAIR was going to begin. He added, that every author who would carry his works there, might probably find a very good reception. I was resolved however to observe the humours of the place in safety from the shore, sensible that ice was at best precarious, and having been always a little cowardly in my sleep.</P>
<P>Several of my acquaintance seemed much more hardy thin I, and went over the ice with intrepi∣dity.
<PB N="vi" REF="7"/>
Some carried their works to the fair on fledges, some on carts, and those which were more voluminous, were conveyed in waggons. Their temerity astonished me. I knew their cargoes were heavy, and expected every moment they would have gone to the bottom. They all entered the fair, however, in safety, and each soon after returned to my great surprize, highly satisfied with his enter∣tainment, and the bargains he had brought away.</P>
<P>The success of such numbers at last began to operate upon me. If these, cried I, meet with favour and safety, some luck may, perhaps, for once attend the unfortunate. I am resolved to make a new adventure. The furniture, frippery and fire∣works of China, have long been fashionably bought up. I'll try the fair with a small cargoe of Chi∣nese morality. If the Chinese have contributed to vitiate our tastle, I'll try how far they can help to improve our understanding. But as others have driven into the market in waggons, I'll cautiously begin by venturing with a wheel-barrow. Thus resolved, I baled up my goods and fairly ventured; when, upon just entering the fair, I fancied the ice that had supported an hundred waggons before, cracked under me; and wheel-barrow and all went to the bottom.</P>
<P>Upon awaking from my reverie, with the fright, I cannot help wishing that the pains taken in giving
<PB N="v" REF="8"/>
this correspondence an English dress, had been employed in contriving new political systems, or new plots for farces. I might then have taken my station in the world, either as a poet or a phi∣losopher; and made one in those little societies where men club to raise each others reputation. But at present I belong to no particular class. I resemble one of those solitary animals, that has been forced from its forest to gratify human curio∣sity. My earliest with was to escape unheeded through life; but I have been set up for half-pence, to fret and scamper at the end of my chain. Tho' none are injured by my rage, I am naturally too savage to court any friends by fawning. Too ob∣stinate to be taught new tricks; and too improvi∣dent to mind what may happen, I am appeased, though not contented. Too indolent for intrigue, and too timid to push for favour, I am—But what signifies what am I.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXIII.</HI> From Lien Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tangi to Hingpo, by the way of Moscow.</HEAD>
<P>GENEROSITY properly applied will sup∣ply every other external advantage in life, but the love of those we converse with; it will pro∣cure esteem and a conduct resembling real affec∣tion, but actual love is the spontaneous produc∣tion of the mind, no generosity can purchase, no rewards encrease, nor no liberality continue it, the very person who is obliged, has it not in his power to force his lingring affections upon the object he should love, and voluntarily mix passion with gratitude.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="10"/>Imparted fortune, and well-placed liberality, may procure the benefactor good-will, may load the person obliged, with the sense of the duty he lies under to retaliate; this is gratitude: and simple gratitude untinctured with love, is all the return an ingenuous mind can bestow for former benefits.</P>
<P>But gratitude and love are almost opposite affec∣tions; love is often an involuntary passion, placed upon our companions without our consent, and fre∣quently conferred without our previous esteem. We love some men, we know not why; our tender∣ness is naturally excited in all their concerns; we excuse their faults with the same indulgence, and approve their virtues with the same applause with which we consider our own. While we entertain the passion it pleases us, we cherish it with de∣light, and give it up with reluctance, and love for love is all the reward we expect or desire.</P>
<P>Gratitude, on the contrary, is never conferred, but where there have been previous endeavours to excite it; we consider it as a debt, and our spirits wear a load till we have discharged the obligation. Every acknowledgment of gratitude is a circumstance of humiliation; and some are found to submit to frequent mortifications of this kind; proclaiming what obligations they owe, merely be∣cause they think it in some measure cancels the debt.</P>
<P>Thus love is the most easy and agreeable, and gra∣titude the most humiliating affection of the mind; we never reflect on the man we <HI>love,</HI> without ex∣ulting in our choice, while he who has bound us to him by <HI>benefits</HI> alone, rises to our idea as a per∣son
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
to whom we have in some measure, forfeited our freedom. Love and gratitude are seldom therefore found in the same breast without impair∣ing each other; we may tender the one or the other singly to those we converse with, but can∣not command both together. By attempting to en∣crease, we diminish them; the mind becomes bank∣rupt under too large obligations; all additional benefits lessen every hope of future return, and bar up every avenue that leads to tenderness.</P>
<P>In all our connexions with society therefore, it is not only generous, but prudent, to appear insen∣sible of the value of those favours we bestow, and endeavour to make the obligation seem as slight as possible. Love must be taken by stra∣tagem, and not by open force: We should seem ignorant that we oblige, and leave the mind at full liberty to give or refuse its affections; for constraint may indeed leave the receiver still grate∣ful, but it will certainly produce disgust.</P>
<P>If to procure gratitude be our only aim, there is no great art in making the acquisition; a benefit conferred demands a just acknowledgment, and we have a right to insist upon our due.</P>
<P>But it were much more prudent to forego our right on such an occasion, and exchange it, if we can, for love. We receive but little advantage from repeated protestations of gratitude, but they cost him very much from whom we exact them in return; exacting a grateful acknowledgement is demanding a debt by which the creditor is not ad∣vantaged, and the debtor pays with reluctance.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="12"/>As <HI>Mencius</HI> the Philosopher was travelling in the pursuit of wisdom, night overtook him at the foot of a gloomy mountain, remote from the habitations of men. Here as he was straying, while rain and thunder conspired to make solitude still more hideous, he perceived a hermit's cell, and approaching, asked for shelter: Enter, cries the hermit, in a severe tone, men deserve not to be obliged, but it would be imitating their in∣gratitude to treat them as they deserve. Come in: examples of vice may sometimes strengthen us in the ways of virtue.</P>
<P>After a frugal meal, which consisted of roots and tea, Mencius could not repress his curiosity to know why the hermit had retired from man∣kind, the actions of whom taught the truest les∣sons of wisdom. Mention not the name of man, cries the hermit, with indignation; here let me live retired from a base ungrateful world; here among the beasts of the forest, I shall find no flatterers; the lion is a generous enemy, and the dog a faithful friend, but man, base man, can poison the bowl, and smile while he presents it. <HI>You have been used ill by mankind?</HI> interrupted the philosopher shrewdly. Yes, returned the hermit, on mankind I have exhausted my whole fortune, and this staff, and that cup, and those roots are all that I have in return. <HI>Did you bestow your fortune, or did you only lend it?</HI> returned Mencius. I bestowed it, undoubtedly, replied the other, for where were the merit of being a money lender? <HI>Did they ever own that they received it?</HI> still adds the philosopher. A thousand times, cries the hermit, they every day loaded me with professions of gratitude, for obligations received, and solicita∣tions
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
for future favours. <HI>If then,</HI> says Mencius, smiling, <HI>you did not lend your fortune, in order to have it returned, it is unjust to accuse th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m of in∣gratitude; they own'd themselves obliged, you expected no more, and they certainly earn'd each favour by frequently acknowledging the obligation.</HI> The hermit was struck with the reply, and surveying his guest with emotion, I have heard of the great Mencius, and you certainly are the man; I am now fourscore years old, but still a child in wis∣dom, take me back to the school of man, and educate me as one of the most ignorant and the youngest of your disciples!</P>
<P>Indeed, my son, it is better to have friends in our passage through life than grateful dependants; and as love is a more willing, so it is a more lasting tribute than extorted obligation. As we are uneasy when greatly obliged, gratitude once refused, can never after be recovered: the mind that is base enough to disallow the just return, instead of feeling any uneasiness upon recollection, triumphs in its new acquired freedom, and in some measure is pleased with conscious baseness.</P>
<P>Very different is the situation of disagreeing friends, their separation produces mutual uneasi∣ness: Like that divided being in fabulous cre∣ation, their sympathetic souls once more desire their former union, the joys of both are imperfect, their gayest moments tinctured with uneasiness; each seeks for the smallest concessions to clear the way to a wished for explanation; the most trifling acknowledgement, the slightest accident serves to effect a mutual reconciliation.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="14"/>But instead of pursuing the thought, permit me to soften the severity of advice, by an Eu∣ropean story which will fully illustrate my mean∣ing.</P>
<P>A fidler and his wife, who had rubbed through life, as most couples usually do, sometimes good friends, at others not quite so well; one day hap∣pened to have a dispute, which was conducted with becoming spirit on both sides. The wife was sure she was right, and the husband was re∣solved to have his own way. What was to be done in such a case? the quarrel grew worse by explanations, and at last the fury of both rose to such a pitch, that they made a vow never to sleep together in the same bed for the future. This was the most rash vow that could be ima∣gined, for they still were friends at bottom, and besides they had but one bed in the house; how∣ever, resolved they were to go through with it, and at night the fiddle-case was laid in bed be∣tween them, in order to make a separation. In this manner they continued for three weeks; every night the fiddle-case being placed as a bar∣rier to divide them.</P>
<P>By this time, however, each heartily repented of their vow, their resentment was at an end, and their love began to return; they wished the fiddle-case away, but both had too much spirit to begin. One night, however, as they were both lying awake with the detested fiddle-case between them, the husband happened to sneeze; to which the wife, as is usual in such cases, bid God bless him; <HI>Ay, but,</HI> returns the husband, <HI>woman, do you say that from your heart?</HI> Indeed,
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
I do, my poor Nicholas, cries his wife, I say it with all my heart. <HI>If so then,</HI> says the husband, <HI>we had as good remove the fiddle-case.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXIV.</HI> From the same.</HEAD>
<P>BOOKS, my son, while they teach us to respect the interests of others, often make us unmind∣ful of our own; while they instruct the youthful reader to grasp at social happiness, he grows mise∣rable in detail, and attentive to universal harmony, often forgets that he himself has a part to sustain in the concert. I dislike therefore the philosopher who describes the inconveniencies of life in such pleasing colours that the pupil grows enamoured of distress, longs to try the charms of poverty, meets it without dread, nor fears its inconvenien∣cies till he severely feels them.</P>
<P>A youth, who has thus spent his life among books, new to the world, and unacquainted with man, but by philosophic information, may be con∣sidered as a being, whose mind is filled with the vulgar errors of the wise; utterly unqualified for a journey through life, yet confident of his own skill in the direction, he sets out with confidence, blunders on with vanity, and finds himself at last undone.</P>
<P>He first has learned from books, and then lays it down as a maxim, that all mankind are virtu∣ous or vicious in excess; and he has been long
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
taught to detest vice and love virtue: warm there∣fore in attachments, and stedfast in enmity, he treats every creature as a friend or foe; expects from those he loves unerring integrity, and con∣signs his enemies to the reproach of wanting every virtue. On this principle he proceeds; and here begin his disappointments: upon a closer inspection of human nature, he perceives, that he should have moderated his friendship, and soften∣ed his severity; for he often finds the excellencies of one part of mankind clouded with vice, and the faults of the other brightened with virtue; he finds no character so sanctified that has not its failings, none so infamous, but has somewhat to attract our esteem; he beholds impiety in lawn, and fidelity in fetters.</P>
<P>He now therefore, but too late, perceives that his regards should have been more cool, and his hatred less violent; that the truly wise seldom court romantic friendships with the good, and a∣void, if possible, the resentment even of the wic∣ked: every moment gives him fresh instances that the bonds of friendship are broken if drawn too closely, and that those whom he has treated with disrespect more than retaliate the injury: at length therefore he is obliged to confess, that he has de∣clared war upon the vicious half of mankind, with∣out being able to form an alliance among the vir∣tuous to espouse his quarrel.</P>
<P>Our book-taught philosopher, however, is now too far advanced to recede; and though poverty be the just consequence of the many enemies his conduct has created, yet he is resolved to meet it without shrinking: philosophers have described
<PB N="9" REF="17"/>
poverty in most charming colours; and even his va∣nity is touched, in thinking, that he shall shew the world, in himself, one more example of pati∣ence, fortitude, and resignation. <HI>Come then, O Poverty! for what is there in thee dreadful to the</HI> WISE; <HI>temperance, health, and frugality, walk in thy train; cheerfulness and liberty are ever thy compa∣nions. Shall any be ashamed of thee of whom Cin∣cinatus was not ashamed? the running brook, the herbs of the field can amply satisfy nature; man wants but little, nor that little long; come then, O Poverty, while kings stand by and gaze with admiration, at the true philosopher's resignation.</HI></P>
<P>The goddess appears; for Poverty ever comes at the call: but alas! he finds her by no means the charming figure books and his warm imagina∣tion had painted. As when an eastern bride whom her friends and relations had long described as a model of perfection, pays her first visit, the long∣ing bridegroom lifts the veil to see a face he had never seen before; but instead of a countenance, blazing with beauty like the sun, he beholds de∣formity shooting icicles to his heart; such appears Poverty to her new entertainer; all the fabric of enthusiasm is at once demolished, and a thousand miseries rise upon its ruins, while Contempt, with pointing finger, is foremost in the hideous proces∣sion.</P>
<P>The poor man now finds that he can get no kings to look at him while he is eating; he finds that in proportion as he grows poor, the world turns its back upon him, and gives him leave to act the philosopher in all the majesty of solitude; it might be agreeable enough to play the philoso∣pher,
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
while we are conscious that mankind are spectators; but what signifies wearing the mask of sturdy contentment, and mounting the stage of re∣straint, when not one creature will assist at the ex∣hibition! Thus is he forsaken of men, while his fortitude wants the satisfaction even of self-ap∣plause; for either he does not feel his present cala∣mities, and that is natural <HI>insensibility,</HI> or he dis∣guises his feelings, and that is <HI>dissimulation.</HI></P>
<P>Spleen now begins to take up the man; not dis∣tinguishing in his resentments, he regards all man∣kind with detestation, and commencing man-hater, seeks solitude to be at liberty to rail.</P>
<P>It has been said, that he who retires to solitude, is either a beast or an angel, the censure is too se∣vere, and the praise unmerited; the discontented being, who retires from society, is generally some good-natured man, who has begun life without experience, and knew not how to gain it in his in∣tercourse with mankind. Adieu.</P>

<DIV1 N="65" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXV.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>I Formerly acquainted thee, most grave <HI>Fum,</HI> with the excellence of the <HI>English</HI> in the art of heal∣ing. The <HI>Chinese</HI> boast their skill in pulses, the <HI>Siamese</HI> their botanical knowledge, but the <HI>English</HI> advertising physicians alone, of being the great re∣storers of health, the dispensers of youth, and
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
the insurers of longevity. I can never enough admire the sagacity of this country for the encou∣ragement given to the professors of this art; with what indulgence does she foster up those of her own growth, and kindly cherish those that come from abroad. Like a skilful gardener she invites them from every foreign climate to herself. Here every great exotic strikes root as soon as imported, and feels the genial beam of favour; while the mighty metropolis, like one vast munificent dunghill, receives them indiscriminately to her breast, and supplies each with more than native nourishment.</P>
<P>In other countries the physician pretends to cure disorders in the lump; the same doctor who com∣bats the gout in the toe, shall pretend to prescribe for a pain in the head, and he who at one time cures a consumption, shall at another give drugs for a dropsy. How absurd and ridiculous! this is being a mere jack of all trades. Is the animal machine less complicated than a brass pin? Not less than ten different hands are required to make a pin; and shall the body be set right by one sin∣gle operator?</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> are sensible of the force of this rea∣soning; they have therefore one doctor for the eyes, another for the toes; they have their sciatica doctors, and inoculating doctors; they have one doctor who is modestly content with securing them from bugbites, and five hundred who prescribe for the bite of mad dogs.</P>
<P>The learned are not here retired with vicious modesty from public view; for every dead wall is covered with their names, their abilities, their a∣mazing
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
cures, and places of abode. Few patients can escape falling into their hands, unless blasted by lightening, or struck dead with some sudden disorder: it may sometimes happen, that a stranger who does not understand <HI>English,</HI> or a countryman who cannot read, dies without ever hearing of the vivifying drops, or restorative electuary; but for my part, before I was a week in town, I had learned to bid the whole catalogue of disorders de∣fiance, and was perfectly acquainted with the names and the medicines of every great man, or great woman of them all.</P>
<P>But as nothing pleases curiosity more than anec∣dotes of the great, however minute or trifling, I must present you, inadequate as my abilities are to the subject, with some account of those personages who lead in this honourable profession.</P>
<P>The first upon the list of glory is doctor <HI>Ri∣chard Rock</HI> F. U. N. This great man is short of sta∣ture, is fat, and waddles as he walks. He always wears a white three-tailed wig nicely combed, and frizzed upon each cheek. Sometimes he carries a cane, but a hat never; it is indeed very remarka∣ble, that this extraordinary personage should never wear an hat, but so it is he never wears an hat. He is usually drawn at the top of his own bills, sitting in his arm-chair, holding a little bottle be∣tween his finger and thumb, and surrounded with rotten teeth, nippers, pills, pacquets, and gally-pots. No man can promise fairer nor better than he; for, as he observes, <HI>Be your disorder never so far gone, be under no uneasiness, make yourself quite easy, I can cure you.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="21"/>The next in fame, though by some reckoned of equal pretensions, is doctor <HI>Timothy Franks,</HI> F. O. G. H. living in a place called the <HI>Old Bailey.</HI> As <HI>Rock</HI> is remarkably squab, his great rival <HI>Franks</HI> is as remarkably tall. He was born in the year of the christian aera 1692, and is, while I now write, ex∣actly sixty-eight years, three months, and four days old. Age, however, has no ways impaired his usual health and vivacity, I am told, he gene∣rally walks with his breast open. This gentleman, who is of a mixed reputation, is particularly re∣markable for a becoming assurance, which carries him gently through life; for, except doctor <HI>Rock,</HI> none are more blest with the advantages of face than doctor <HI>Franks.</HI></P>
<P>And yet the great have their foibles as well as the little. I am almost ashamed to mention it. Let the foibles of the great rest in peace. Yet I must impart the whole to my friend. These two great men are actually now at variance; yes, my dear <HI>Fum Hoam,</HI> by the head of our grandfather, they are now at variance like mere men, mere common mortals. The champion <HI>Rock</HI> advises the world to beware of bog trotting quacks, while <HI>Franks</HI> retorts the wit and the sarcasm (for they have both a world of wit) by fixing on his rival the odious appellation of <HI>Dumplin Dick.</HI> He calls the serious doctor <HI>Rock, Dumplin Dick!</HI> Head of <HI>Confucius,</HI> what profanation! <HI>Dumplin Dick!</HI> What a pity, ye powers, that the learned, who were born mutually to assist in enlightening the world, should thus dif∣fer among themselves, and make even the profession ridiculous! Sure the world is wide enough, at least, for two great personages to figure in; men of sci∣ence should leave controversy to the little world
<PB N="14" REF="22"/>
below them; and then we might see <HI>Rock</HI> and <HI>Franks</HI> walking together hand in hand, smiling on∣ward to immortality.</P>
<P>Next to these is doctor <HI>Walker,</HI> preparator of his own medicines. This gentleman is remarkable for an aversion to quacks; frequently cautioning the public to be careful into what hands they com∣mit their safety; by which he would insinuate that if they do not employ him alone, they must be undone. His public spirit is equal to his success. Not for himself, but his country, is the gally-pot prepared and the drops sealed up with proper di∣rections for any part of the town or country. All this is for his country's good: so that he is now grown old in the practice of physic and virtue; and to use his own elegance of expression, <HI>There is not such another medicine as his in the world again.</HI></P>
<P>This, my friend, is a formidable triumvirate; and yet, formidable as they are, I am resol∣ved to defend the honour of <HI>Chinese</HI> physic a∣gainst them all. I have made a vow to summon doctor <HI>Rock</HI> to a solemn disputation in all the mys∣teries of the profession, before the face of every <HI>Philomath,</HI> student in astrology, and member of the learned societies. I adhere to, and venerate the doctrines of old <HI>Wang-shu-ho.</HI> In the very teeth of opposition I will maintain, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Du Halde, vol. II. fol. p. 185.</NOTE><HI>That the heart is the son of the liver, which has the kidneys for its mother, and the stomach for its wife.</HI> I have therefore drawn up a disputation challenge, which is to be sent speedily, to this effect:</P>
<P>I, <HI>Lien Chi Altangi, <HI>D. N. R. P.</HI></HI> native of <HI>Ho∣nan</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> to <HI>Richard Rock,</HI> F. U. N. native of <HI>Garbage-alley</HI> in <HI>Wapping,</HI> defiance. Though, Sir, I
<PB N="15" REF="23"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m perfectly sensible of your importance, though no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ranger to your studies in the paths of nature, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere may be many things in the art of physic with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich you are yet unacquainted. I know full well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doctor thou art, great <HI>Rock,</HI> and so am I.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXVI.</HI> To the same.</HEAD>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>NDULGENT nature seems to have ex∣empted this island from many of those epidemic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tils which are so fatal in other parts of the
<PB N="16" REF="24"/>
world. A want of rain but for a few days beyond the expected season in China, spreads famine, desolation, and terror, over the whole country; the winds that blow from the brown bosom of the western desart are impregnated with death in every gale; but in this fortunate land of Britain, the inhabitant courts health in every breeze, and the husbandman ever sows in joyful expectation.</P>
<P>But tho' the nation be exempt from real evils, think not, my friend, that it is more happy on this account than others. They are afflicted, it is true, with neither famine nor pestilence, but then there is a disorder peculiar to the country, which every season makes strange ravages among them; it spreads with pestilential rapidity, and infects almost every rank of people; what is still more strange the natives have no name for this peculiar malady, tho' well known to foreign physicians by the appellation of <HI>Epidemic terror.</HI></P>
<P>A season is never known to pass in which the people are not visited by this cruel calamity in one shape or another, seemingly different, tho' ever the same; one year it issues from a baker's shop in the shape of a sixpenny loaf, the next it takes the appearance of a comet with a fiery tail, a third it threatens like a flat-bottomed boat, and a fourth it carries consternation at the bite of a mad dog. The people, when once infected, lose their relish for happiness, saunter about with looks of despondence, ask after the calamities of the day, and receive no comfort but in heightening each others distress. It is insignificant how remote or near, how weak or powerful the object of terror may be, when once they resolve to fright
<PB N="17" REF="25" MS="y"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd be frighted, the meerest trifles sow conster∣nation and dismay, each proportions his fears not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the object, but to the dread he discovers in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he countenance of others; for when once the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ermentation is begun, it goes on of itself, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he original cause be discontinued which first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et it in motion.</P>
<P>A dread of mad dogs is the <HI>epidemic terror</HI> which now prevails, and the whole nation is at present actually groaning under the malignity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts influence. The people sally from their houses with that circumspection which is prudent in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch as expect a mad dog at every turning. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hysician publishes his prescription, the beadle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>repares his halter, and a few of unusual bravery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rm themselves with boots and buff gloves, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rder to face the enemy if he should offer to at∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack them. In short, the whole people stand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ravely upon their defence, and seem by their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resent spirit to shew a resolution of not being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amely bit by mad dogs any longer.</P>
<P>Their manner of knowing whether a dog be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad or no, somewhat resembles the ancient Eu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opean custom of trying witches. The old wo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an suspected was tied hand and foot and thrown <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to the water. If she swam, then she was instantly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arried off to be burnt for a witch, if she sunk, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en indeed she was acquitted of the charge, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rown'd in the experiment. In the same manner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> crowd gather round a dog suspected of mad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess, and they begin by teizing the devoted animal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n every side; if he attempts to stand upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efensive and bite, then is he unanimously found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uilty, for <HI>a mad dog always snaps at every thing</HI>;
<PB N="18" REF="26"/>
if, on the contrary, he strives to escape by run∣ning away, then he can expect no compassion, <HI>for mad dogs always run straight forward before them.</HI></P>
<P>It is pleasant enough for a neutral being like me, who have no share in those ideal calamities, to mark the stages of this national disease. The ter∣ror at first feebly enters with a disregarded story of a little dog, that had gone through a neighbouring village, that was thought to be mad by several that had seen him. The next account comes, that a mas∣tiff ran through a certain town, and had bit five geese, which immediately run mad, foamed at the bill, and died in great agonies soon after. Then comes an affecting history of a little boy bit in the leg, and gone down to be dipt in the salt water; when the people have sufficiently shuddered at that, they are next congealed with a frightful account of a man who was said lately to have died from a bite he had received some years before. This relation only prepares the way for another, still more hideous, as how the master of a family, with seven small children, were all bit by a mad lap dog, and how the poor father first perceived the infection by calling for a draught of water, where he saw the lap dog swimming in the cup.</P>
<P>When epidemic terror is thus once excited, every morning comes loaded with some new dis∣aster; as in stories of ghosts each loves to hear the account, though it only serves to make him uneasy, so here each listens with eagerness, and adds to the tidings with new circumstances of pe∣culiar horror. A lady for instance, in the coun∣try, of very weak nerves has been frighted by the barking of a dog; and this, alas! too fre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ently
<PB N="19" REF="27"/>
happens. The story soon is improved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d spreads, that a mad dog had frighted a lady <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> distinction. These circumstances begin to grow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rrible before they have reached the neighbour∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g village, and there the report is, that a lady <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> quality was <HI>bit</HI> by a mad mastiff. This ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>unt every moment gathers new strength and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ows more dismal as it approaches the capital, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d by the time it has arrived in town the lady is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>scribed, with wild eyes, foaming mouth, run∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng mad upon all four, barking like a dog, bi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g her servants, and at last smothered between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o beds by the advice of her doctors: while the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d mastiff is in the mean time ranging the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>untry over, slavering at the mouth, and seek∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g whom he may devour.</P>
<P>My landlady, a good natured woman, but a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tle credulous, waked me some mornings ago <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fore the usual hour with horror and astonish∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent in her looks; she desired me if I had any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gard for my safety, to keep within; for a few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ys ago so dismal an accident had happened, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> put all the world upon their guard. A mad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g down in the country, she assured me, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a farmer, who soon becoming mad ran into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> own yard, and bit a fine brindled cow; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w quickly became as mad as the man, began <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> foam at the mouth, and raising herself up, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lked about on her hind legs, sometimes barking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e a dog, and sometimes attempting to talk <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e the farmer. Upon examining the grounds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this story, I found my landlady had it from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e neighbour, who had it from another neigh∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ur, who heard it from very good authority.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="28"/>Were most stories of this nature thoroughly ex¦amined, it would be found that numbers of suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as have been said to suffer were no way injured and that of those who have been actually bitten not one in a hundred was bit by a mad dog▪ Such accounts in general therefore only serve t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> make the people miserable by false terrors, and sometimes fright the patient into actual phrenzy by creating those very symptoms, they pretended to deplore.</P>
<P>But even allowing three or four to die in a season of this terrible death (and four is probably too large a concession) yet still it is not considered how many are preserved in their health and in their property by this devoted animal's services▪ The midnight robber is kept at a distance▪ the insidious thief is often detected, the health¦ful chace repairs many a worn constitution, and the poor man finds in his dog a willing assistant eager to lessen his toil, and content with the smallest retribution.</P>

<P>THE People of <HI>London</HI> are as fond of walking as our friends at <HI>Pekin</HI> of riding; one of the principal entertainments of the citizens here in summer is to repair about nightfall to a garden not far from town, where they walk about, shew their best cloaths and best faces, and listen to a concert provided for the occasion.</P>
<P>I accepted an invitation a few evenings ago from my old friend, the man in black, to be one of a party that was to sup there, and at the ap∣pointed hour waited upon him at his lodgings. There I found the company assembled and ex∣pecting my arrival. Our party consisted of my friend in superlative finery, his stockings rolled, a black velvet waistcoat which was formerly new, and his grey wig combed down in imitation of hair. A pawn-broker's widow, of whom, by the bye, my friend was a professed admirer, dressed out in green damask, with three gold rings on every finger. Mr. <HI>Tibbs</HI> the second-rate beau, I have formerly described, together with his lady, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n flimsy silk, dirty gauze instead of linnen, and an hat as big as an umbrello.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="34"/>Our first difficulty was in settling how we should set out. Mrs. <HI>Tibbs</HI> had a natural aversion to the water, and the widow being a little in flesh, as warmly protested against walking, a coach was therefore agreed upon; which being too small to carry five, Mr. <HI>Tibbs</HI> consented to sit in his wife's lap.</P>
<P>In this manner therefore we set forward, being entertained by the way with the bodings of Mr. <HI>Tibbs,</HI> who assured us, he did not expect to see a single creature for the evening above the degree of a cheesemonger; that this was the last night of the gardens, and that consequently we should be pestered with the nobility and gentry from <HI>Thames-street</HI> and <HI>Crooked-lane,</HI> with several other prophetic ejaculations probably inspired by the uneasiness of his situation.</P>
<P>The illuminations began before we arrived, and I must confess, that upon entring the gardens, I found every sense overpaid with more than ex∣pected pleasure; the lights every where glimmer∣ing through the scarcely moving trees; the full-bodied consort bursting on the stillness of the night, the natural consort of the birds, in the more retired part of the grove, vying with that which was formed by art; the company gayly dressed looking satisfaction, and the tables spread with various delacacies, all conspired to sill my imagination with the visionary happiness of the <HI>Arabian</HI> lawgiver, and lifted me into an extasy of admiration. Head of <HI>Confucius,</HI> cried I to my friend, this is fine! this unites rural beauty with courtly magnificence, if we except the virgins of immortality that hang on every tree, and may be
<PB N="27" REF="35"/>
plucked at every desire, I don't see how this falls short of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s <HI>Paradise!</HI> As for virgins, cries my friend, it is true, they are a fruit that don't much abound in our gardens here; but if ladies as plenty as apples in autumn, and as complying as any <HI>hoüry</HI> of them all can content you, I fancy, we have no need to go to heaven for Paradise.</P>
<P>I was going to second his remarks, when we were called to a consultation by Mr. <HI>Tibbs</HI> and the rest of the company, to know in what man∣ner we were to lay out the evening to the greatest advantage. Mrs. <HI>Tibbs</HI> was for keeping the gen∣teel walk of the garden, where she observed there was always the very best company; the widow, on the contrary, who came but once a season, was for securing a good standing place to see the water-works, which she assured us would begin in less than an hour at farthest; a dispute therefore began, and as it was managed between two of very opposite characters, it threatned to grow more bitter at every reply. Mrs. <HI>Tibbs</HI> wondered how people could pretend to know the polite world who had received all their rudi∣ments of breeding behind a compter; to which the other replied; that tho' some people sat behind compters, yet they could sit at the head of their own tables too, and carve three good dishes of hot meat whenever they thought proper, which was more than some people could say for them∣selves, that hardly knew a rabbet and onions from a green goose and gooseberries.</P>
<P>It is hard to say where this might have ended, had not the husband, who probably knew the
<PB N="28" REF="36"/>
impetuosity of his wife's disposition, proposed to end the dispute by adjourning to a box, and try if there was any thing to be had for supper that was supportable. To this we all consented, but here a new distress arose, Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Tibbs</HI> would sit in none but a genteel box, a box where they might see and be seen, one, as they expressed it, in the very focus of public view; but such a box was not easy to be obtained, for tho' we were perfectly convinced of our own gentility, and the gentility of our appearance, yet we found it a dif∣ficult matter to persuade the keepers of the boxes to be of our opinion; they chose to reserve genteel boxes for what they judged more genteel company.</P>
<P>At last however we were fixed, tho' somewhat obscurely, and supplied with the usual entertain∣ment of the place. The widow found the supper excellent, but Mrs. <HI>Tibbs</HI> thought every thing detestable: come, come, my dear, cries the hus∣band, by way of consolation, to be sure we can't find such dressing here as we have at lord Crump's or lady Crimp's; but for Vauxhall dressing it is pretty good; it is not their victuals indeed I find fault with, but their wine; their wine, cries he, drinking off a glass, indeed, is most abominable.</P>
<P>By this last contradiction the widow was fairly conquered in point of politeness. She perceived now that she had no pretensions in the world to taste, her very senses were vulgar, since she had praised detestable custard, and smacked at wretch∣ed wine; she was therefore content to yield the victory, and for the rest of the night to listen and improve. It is true, she would now and then forget herself, and confess she was pleased, but
<PB N="29" REF="37"/>
they soon brought her back again to miserable refinement. She once praised the painting of the box in which we were sitting, but was soon con∣vinced that such paltry pieces ought rather to excite horror than satisfaction; she ventured again to commend one of the singers, but Mrs. <HI>Tibbs</HI> soon let her know, in the style of a connoisseur, that the singer in question had neither ear, voice, nor judgment.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tibbs</HI> now willing to prove that his wife's pretensions to music were just, entreated her to favour the company with a song; but to this she gave a positive denial, for you know very well, my dear, says she, that I am not in voice to day, and when one's voice is not equal to one's judgment, what signifies singing; besides as there is no accompanyment, it would be but spoil∣ing music. All these excuses however were over∣ruled by the rest of the company, who, though one would think they already had music enough, joined in the intreaty. But particularly the widow, now willing to convince the company of her breeding, pressed so warmly that she seemed determined to take no refusal. At last then the lady com∣plied, and after humming for some minutes, be∣gan with such a voice and such affectation, as I could perceive gave but little satisfaction to any except her husband. He sat with rapture in his eye, and beat time with his hand on the table.</P>
<P>You must observe, my friend, that it is the custom of this country, when a lady or gentleman happens to sing, for the company to sit as mute and motionless as statues. Every feature, every limb must seem to correspond in fixed attention,
<PB N="30" REF="38"/>
and while the song continues, they are to remain in a state of universal petrefaction. In this morti∣fying situation we had continued for some time, listening to the song, and looking with tranqui∣lity, when the master of the box came to inform us, that the water-works were going to begin. At this information I could instantly perceive the widow bounce from her seat; but correcting herself, she sat down again, repressed by motives of good breeding. Mrs. <HI>Tibbs,</HI> who had seen the water-works an hundred times, resolving not to be interrupted, continued her song without any share of mercy, nor had the smallest pity on our impatience. The widow's face, I own, gave me high entertainment; in it I could plainly t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d the struggle she felt between good breeding and curiosity; she talked of the water-works the whole evening before, and seemed to have come merely in order to see them; but then she could not bounce out in the very middle of a song, for that would be forfeiting all pretensions to high life, or high-lived company ever after: Mrs. <HI>Tibbs</HI> therefore kept on singing, and we continued to listen, till at last, when the song was just con∣cluded, the waiter came to inform us that the water-works were over!</P>
<P>The water-works over, cried the widow! the water-works over already, that's impossible, they can't be over so soon! It is not my business, re∣plied the fellow, to contradict your ladyship, I'll run again and see; he went, and soon returned with a confirmation of the dismal tidings. No ceremony could now bind my friend's disappoint∣ed mistress, she testified her displeasure in the openest manner; in short, she now began to find
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>
fault in turn, and at last, insisted upon going home, just at the time that Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Tibbs</HI> assured the company, that the polite hours were going to begin, and that the ladies would instantaneously be entertained with the horns. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXIX.</HI> From the same.</HEAD>
<P>NOT far from this city lives a poor tinker, who has educated seven sons, all at this very time in arms and fighting for their country, and what reward do you think has the tinker from the state for such important services? None in the world; his sons, when the war is over, may probably be whipt from parish to parish as vaga∣bonds, and the old man, when past labour, may die a prisoner in some house of correction.</P>
<P>Such a worthy subject in China would be held in universal reverence; his services would be re∣warded, if not with dignities, at least with an ex∣emption from labour; he would take the left hand at feasts, and mandarines themselves would be proud to shew their submission. The <HI>English</HI> laws punish vice, the <HI>Chinese</HI> laws do more, they reward virtue!</P>
<P>Considering the little encouragement given to matrimony here, I am not surprized at the dis∣couragements given to propagation. Would you believe it, my dear <HI>Fam Hoam,</HI> there are laws made, which even forbid the peoples marrying each other. By the head of <HI>Confucius</HI> I jest not;
<PB N="32" REF="40"/>
there are such laws in being here; and yet their law-givers have neither been instructed among the <HI>Hottentot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> nor imbibed their principles of equity from the natives of <HI>Anamaboo.</HI></P>
<P>There are laws which ordain, that no man shall marry a woman against her own consent. This, though contrary to what we are taught in <HI>Asia,</HI> and though in some measure a clog upon matrimony, I have no great objection to. There are laws which ordain, that no woman shall marry against her father and mother's consent, unless arrived at an age of maturity; by which is un∣derstood those years, when women with us are generally past child-bearing. This must be a clog upon matrimony, as it is more difficult for the lover to please three than one, and much more difficult to please old people than young ones. The laws ordain, that the consenting couple shall take a long time to consider before they marry, this is a very great clog, because people love to have all rash actions done in a hurry. It is ordained, that all marriages shall be proclaimed before celebration; this is a severe clog, as many are ashamed to have their marriage made public, from motives of vicious modesty, and many afraid from views of temporal interest. It is ordained, that there is nothing sacred in the ceremony, but that it may be dissolved to all intents and purposes by the authority of any civil magistrate. And yet opposite to this it is ordained, that the priest shall be paid a large sum of money for granting his sacred permission.</P>
<P>Thus you see, my friend, that matrimony here is hedged round with so many obstructions, that
<PB N="33" REF="41"/>
those who are willing to break through or sur∣mount them must be contented, if at last they find it a bed of thorns. The laws are not to blame, for they have deterred the people from engaging as much as they could. It is indeed be∣come a very serious affair in <HI>England,</HI> and none but serious people are generally found willing to engage. The young, the gay, and the beautiful, who have motives of passion only to induce them, are seldom found to embark, as those inducements are taken away, and none but the old, the ugly, and the mercenary are seen to unite, who, if they have any posterity at all, will probably be an ill-favoured race like themselves.</P>
<P>What gave rise to those laws might have been some such accidents as these. It sometimes hap∣pened, that a miser who had spent all his youth, in scraping up money to give his daughter such a fortune as might get her a mandarin husband, found his expectations disappointed at last, by her running away with his footman: this must have been a sad shock to the poor disconsolate parent, to see his poor daughter in a one horse chaise, when he had designed her for a coach and six: what a stroke from Providence! to see his dear money go to enrich a beggar; all nature cried out at the profanation!</P>
<P>It sometimes happened also, that a lady who had inherited all the titles, and all the nervous complaints of nobility, thought sit to impair her dignity and mend her constitution, by marrying a farmer; this must have been a sad shock to her inconsolable relations, to see so fine a flower snatched from a flourishing family, and planted
<PB N="34" REF="42"/>
in a dunghill; this was an absolute inversion of the first principles of things.</P>
<P>In order therefore to prevent the great from be∣ing thus contaminated by vulgar alliances, the ob∣stacles to matrimony have been so contrived, that the rich only can marry amongst the rich, and the poor, who would leave celibacy, must be content to encrease their poverty with a wife. Thus have their laws fairly inverted the inducements to matrimony; nature tells us, that beauty is the proper allurement of those who are rich, and money of those who are poor; but things here are so contrived, that the rich are invited to mar∣ry by that fortune which they do not want, and the poor have no inducement, but that beauty which they do not feel.</P>
<P>An equal diffusion of riches through any coun∣try ever constitutes its happiness. Great wealth in the possession of one stagnates, and extreme po∣verty with another keeps him in unambitious in∣digence; but the moderately rich are generally active; not too far removed from poverty to fear its calamities, nor too near extreme wealth to slacken the nerve of labour, they remain still be∣tween both in a state of continual fluctuation. How impolitic therefore are those laws which pro∣mote the accumulation of wealth among the rich, more impolitic still in attempting to increase the depression on poverty.</P>
<P>Bacon the English philosopher, compares money to manure, if gathered in heaps, says he, it does no good: on the contrary, it becomes offensive, but being spread, though never so think, over the
<PB N="35" REF="43"/>
surface of the earth, it enriches the whole coun∣try. Thus the wealth a nation possesses must expatiate, or it is of no benefit to the public; it becomes rather a grievance, where matrimonial laws thus confine it to a few.</P>
<P>But this restraint upon matrimonial community, even considered in a physical light, is injurious. As those who rear up animals take all possible pains to cross the strain in order to improve the breed; so in those countries, where marriage is most free, the inhabitants are found every age to improve in stature and in beauty; on the contrary, where it is confined to a <HI>cast,</HI> a <HI>tribe,</HI> or an <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd,</HI> as among the Gaurs, the Jews, or the Tar∣tars, each division soon assumes a family likeness, and every tribe degenerates into peculiar de∣formity. From hence it may be easily inferred, that if the mandarines here are resolved only to marry among each other, they will soon produce a posterity with mandarine faces; and we shall see the heir of some honourable family scarce equal to the abortion of a country farmer.</P>
<P>These are a few of the obstacles to marriage here, and it is certain, they have in some measure answered the end, for celibacy is both frequent and fashionable. Old batchelors appear abroad without a mask, and old maids, my dear <HI>Fum Hoam,</HI> have been absolutely known to ogle. To confess in friendship; if I were an Englishman, I fancy I should be an old batchelor myself; I should never find courage to run through all the adventures prescribed by the law. I could sub∣mit to court my mistress herself upon reasonable terms, but to court her father, her mother, and
<PB N="36" REF="44"/>
a long tribe of cousins, aunts and relations, and then stand the butt of a whole country church; I would as soon turn tail and make love to her grandmother.</P>
<P>I can conceive no other reason for thus loading matrimony with so many prohibitions, unless it be that the country was thought already too po∣pulous, and this was found to be the most effectual means of thinning it. If this was the motive, I cannot but congratulate the wise projectors on the success of their scheme. Hail, O ye dim-sighted politicians, ye weeders of men! 'Tis yours to clip the wing of industry, and convert Hymen to a broker. 'Tis yours to behold small objects with a microscopic eye, but to be blind to those which require an extent of vision. 'Tis yours, O ye discerners of mankind, to lay the line between society, and weaken that force by dividing, which should bind with united vigour. 'Tis yours, to introduce national real distress, in order to avoid the imaginary distresses of a few. Your actions can be justified by an hundred reasons like truth, they can be opposed by but a few reasons, and those reasons are true. Farewel.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXX.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi to Hinpgo, by the way of Moscow.</HEAD>
<P>AGE that lessens the enjoyment of life encreases our desire of living. Those dangers, which, in the vigour of youth we had learned to despise, assume now terrors as we grew old. Our caution
<PB N="37" REF="45"/>
encreasing as our years encrease, fear becomes at last the prevailing passion of the mind; and the small remainder of life is taken up in useless ef∣forts to keep off our end, or provide for a continu∣ed existence.</P>
<P>Strange contradiction in our nature, and to which even the wise are liable! If I should judge of that part of life which lies before me by that which I have already seen, the prospect is hideous. Experience tells me, that my past enjoyments have brought no real felicity; and sensation assures me, that those I have felt are stronger than those which are yet to come. Yet experience and sensation in vain persuade; hope, more powerful than either, dresses out the distant prospect in fancied beauty, some happiness in long perspective still beckons me to pursue, and, like a losing gamester, every new dis∣appointment encreases my ardour to continue the game.</P>
<P>Whence, my friend, this encreased love of life, which grows upon us with our years; whence comes it, that we thus make greater efforts to pre∣serve our existence, at a period when it becomes scarce worth the keeping? Is it that nature, attentive to the preservation of mankind, encreases our wishes to live, while she lessens our enjoyments; and, as she robs the senses of every pleasure, equips imagination in the spoil? Life would be insupportable to an old man, who loaded with infirmities, feared death no more than when in the vigour of manhood; the num∣berless calamities of decaying nature, and the consci∣ousness of surviving every pleasure, would at once induce him with his own hand to terminate the scene of misery; but happily the contempt of death for∣sakes
<PB N="38" REF="46"/>
him at a time when it could only be preju∣dicial; and life acquires an imaginary value, in proportion as its real value is no more.</P>
<P>Our attachment to every object around us en∣creases, in general, from the length of our acquaint∣ance with it. I would not chuse, says a <HI>French</HI> philosopher, to see an old post pulled up, with which I had been long acquainted. A mind long habituated to a certain set of objects, insensibly be∣comes fond of seeing them; visits them from ha∣bit, and parts from them with reluctance: from hence proceed the avarice of the old in every kind of possession. They love the world and all that it produces; they love life and all its advan∣tages; not because it gives them pleasure, but be∣cause they have known it long.</P>
<P>Chinvang, the Chaste, ascending the throne of China, commanded that all who were unjustly de∣tained in prison, during the preceding reigns, should be set free. Among the number who came to thank their deliverer on this occasion, there ap∣peared a majestic old man, who, falling at the em∣peror's feet, addressed him as follows: "Great father of China, behold a wretch, now eighty-five years old, who was shut up in a dungeon at the age of twenty-two. I was imprisoned, though a stranger to crime, or without being even confront∣ed by my accusers. I have now lived in solitude and darkness for more than fifty years, and am grown familiar with distress. As yet dazzled with the splendour of that sun to which you have re∣stored me, I have been wandring the streets to find some friend that would assist, or relieve, or remem∣ber me; but my friends, my family, and relations,
<PB N="39" REF="47" MS="y"/>
are all dead, and I am forgotten. Permit me then, O Chinvang, to wear out the wretched remains of life in my former prison; the walls of my dungeon are to me more pleasing than the most splendid palace; I have not long to live, and shall be un∣happy except I spend the rest of my days where my youth was passed; in that prison from whence you were pleased to release me.</P>
<P>The old man's passion for confinement is simi∣lar to that we all have for life. We are habitu∣ated to the prison, we look round with discontent, are displeased with the abode, and yet the length of our captivity only encreases our fondness for the cell. The trees we have planted, the houses we have built, or the posterity we have begotten, all serve to bind us closer to earth, and embitter our parting. Life sues the young like a new acquaint∣ance; the companion, as yet unexhausted, is at once instructive and amusing, 'tis company pleases, yet for all this it is but little regarded. To us, who are declined in years, life appears like an old friend; its jests have been anticipated in former conversation; it has no new story to make us smile, no new improvement with which to sur∣prize, yet still we love it; destitute of every agree∣ment still we love it; husband the wasting treasure with encreased frugality, and feel all the poignancy of anguish in the fatal separation.</P>
<P>Sir Philip Mordaunt was young, beautiful, sin∣cere, brave, an Englishman. He had a complete for∣tune of his own, and the love of the king his mas∣ter, which was equivalent to riches. Life open∣ed all her treasure before him, and promised a long succession of future happiness. He came, tast∣ed of the entertainment, but was disgusted even in
<PB N="40" REF="48"/>
in the beginning. He professed an aversion to liv∣ing, was tired of walking round the same circle; had tried every enjoyment, and found them all grow weaker at every repetition. "If life be in youth so displeasing, cried he to himself, what will it appear when age comes on; if it be at present in∣different, sure it will then be execrable. This thought embittered every reflection; till, at last, with all the serenity of perverted reason, he ended the debate with a pistol! Had this self-deluded man been apprized, that existence grows more de∣sirable to us the longer we exist, he would have then faced old age without shrinking, he would have boldly dared to live, and served that society, by his future assiduity, which he basely injured by his desertion.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXI.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, first president of the Ceremonial Academy, at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>IN reading the news-papers here, I have reckon∣ed up not less than twenty-five great men, se∣venteen very great men, and nine very extraordi∣nary men in less than the compass of half a year. These, say the gazattes, are the men that posterity are to gaze at with admiration; these the names that fame will be employed in holding up for the asto∣nishment of succeeding ages. Let me see — forty-six great men in half a year, amounts just to nine∣ty-two in a year. —I wonder how posterity will be able to remember them all, or whether the peo∣ple, in future times, will have any other business to mind, but that of getting the catalogue by heart.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="49"/>Does the mayor of a corporation make a speech? he is instantly set down for a great man. Does a pedant digest his common place book into a folio? he quickly becomes great. Does a poet string up trite sentiments in rhyme? he also be∣comes the great man of the hour. How diminu∣tive soever the object of admiration, each is fol∣lowed by a crowd of still more diminutive admir∣ers. The shout begins in his train, onward he marches toward immortality, looks back at the pursuing crowd with self-satisfaction; catching all the oddities, the whimsies, the absurdities, and the littlenesses of conscious greatness, by the way.</P>
<P>I was yesterday invited by a gentleman to dinner, who promised that our entertainment should con∣sist of an haunch of venison, a turtle, and a great man. I came, according to appointment. The venison was fine, the turtle good, but the great man insupportable. The moment I ventured to speak, I was at once contradicted with a snap. I attempted, by a second and a third assault, to re∣trieve my lost reputation, but was still beat back with confusion. I was resolved to attack him once more from entrenchment, and turned the conver∣sation upon the government of China: but even here he asserted, snapped, and contradicted as be∣fore. Heavens, thought I, this man pretends to know China even better than myself! I looked round to see who was on my side, but every eye was fixed in admiration on the great man; I there∣fore, at last thought proper to sit silent, and act the pretty gentleman during the ensuing conversa∣tion.</P>
<P>When a man has once secured a circle of admir∣ers, he may be as ridiculous here as he thinks pro∣per;
<PB N="42" REF="50"/>
and it all passes for elevation of sentiment, or learned absence. If he transgresses the common forms of breeding, mistakes even a tea-pot for a tobacco-box, it is said, that his thoughts are fixed on more important objects: to speak and act like the rest of mankind is to be no greater than they. There is something of oddity in the very idea of greatness; for we are seldom astonished at a thing very much resembling ourselves.</P>
<P>When the Tartars make a Lama, their first care is to place him in a dark corner of the temple; here he is to sit-half concealed from view, to regu∣late the motion of his hands, lips, and eyes; but, above all, he is enjoined gravity and silence. This, however, is but the prelude to his apotheosis: a set of emissaries are dispatched among the people to cry up his piety, gravity, and love of raw flesh; the people take them at their word, approach the La∣ma, now become an idol, with the most humble prostration; he receives their addresses without mo∣tion, commences a god, and is ever after fed by his priests with the spoon of immortality. The same receipt in this country serves to make a great man. The idol only keeps close, sends out his little emis∣saries to be hearty in his praise; and straight, whether statesman or author, he is set down in the list of fame, continuing to be praised while it is fashionable to praise, or while he prudently keeps his minuteness concealed from the public.</P>
<P>I have visited many countries, and have been in cities without number, yet never did I enter a town which could not produce ten or twelve of those little great men; all fancying themselves
<PB N="43" REF="51"/>
known to the rest of the world, and compliment∣ing each other upon their extensive reputation. It is amusing enough when two of those domestic prodigies of learning mount the stage of ceremony, and give and take praise from each other. I have been present when a German doctor, for having pronounced a panegyric upon a certain monk, was thought the most ingenious man in the world; till the monk soon after divided this reputation by re∣turning the compliment; by which means they both marched off with universal applause.</P>
<P>The same degree of undeserved adulation that attends our great man while living, often also fol∣lows him to the tomb. It frequently happens that one of his little admirers sits down big with the important subject, and is delivered of the history of his life and writings. This may properly be called the revolutions of a life between the fire∣side and the easy-chair. In this we learn, the year in which he was born, at what an early age he gave symptoms of uncommon genius and appli∣cation, together with some of his smart sayings, col∣lected by his aunt and mother, while yet but a boy. The next book introduces him to the uni∣versity, where we are informed of his amazing progress in learning, his excellent skill in darning stockings, and his new invention for papering books to save the covers. He next makes his ap∣pearance in the republic of letters, and publishes his folio. Now the colossus is reared, his works are eagerly bought up by all the purchasers of scarce books. The learned societies invite him to be∣come a member; he disputes against some foreign∣er with a long Latin name, conquers in the con∣troversy, is complimented by several authors of
<PB N="44" REF="52"/>
gravity and importance, is excessively fond of egg-sauce with his pig, becomes president of a literary club, and dies in the meridian of his glory. Hap∣py they, who thus have some little faithful attend∣ant, who never forsakes them, but prepares to wran∣gle and to praise against every opposer; at once ready to encrease their pride while living, and their character when dead. For you and I, my friend, who have no humble admirer thus to attend us, we, who neither are, nor ever will be great men, and who do not much care whether we are great men or no, at least let us strive to be honest men, and to have common sense.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXII.</HI> To the same.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are numbers in this city who live by writing new books; and yet there are thou∣sands of volumes in every large library unread and forgotten. This, upon my arrival, was one of those contradictions which I was unable to ac∣count for. Is it possible, said I, that there should be any demand for new books, before those al∣ready published are read? Can there be so many employed in producing a commodity with which the market is already overstocked; and with goods also better than any of modern manufacture!</P>
<P>What at first view appeared an inconsistence, is a proof at once of this people's wisdom and refine∣ment. Even allowing the works of their ancestors better written than theirs, yet those of the moderns
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>
acquire a real value, by being marked with the im∣pression of the times. Antiquity has been in the pos∣session of others, the present is our own; let us first therefore learn to know what belongs to ourselves, and then, if we have leisure, cast our reflections back to the reign of <HI>Shonou,</HI> who governed twenty thousand years before the creation of the moon.</P>
<P>The volumes of antiquity, like medals, may very well serve to amuse the curious, but the works of the moderns, like the current coin of a kingdom, are much better for immediate use; the former are often prized above their intrinsic value, and kept with care, the latter seldom pass for more than they are worth, and are often subject to the mer∣ciless hands of sweating critics, and clipping com∣pilers; the works of antiquity were ever praised, those of the moderns read; the treasures of our ancestors have our esteem, and we boast the pas∣sion; those of cotemporary genius engage our heart, although we blush to own it. The visits we pay the former resemble those we pay the great; the ceremony is troublesome, and yet such as we would not chuse to forego; our acquaint∣ance with modern books, is like sitting with a friend; our pride is not flattered in the interview, but it gives more internal satisfaction.</P>
<P>In proportion as society refines, new books must ever become more necessary. Savage rusticity is reclaimed by oral admonition alone; but the ele∣gant excesses of refinement are best corrected by the still voice of studious enquiry. In a polite age, almost every person becomes a reader, and receives more instruction from the press than the pulpit. The preaching Bonse may instruct the illiterate
<PB N="46" REF="54"/>
peasant; but nothing less than the insinuating ad∣dress of a fine writer can win its way to an heart already relaxed in all the effeminacy of refinement. Books are necessary to correct the vices of the po∣lite, but those vices are ever changing, and the antidote should be changed accordingly; should still be new.</P>
<P>Instead therefore of thinking the number of new publications here too great, I could wish it still greater, as they are the most useful instruments of reformation. Every country must be instructed either by <HI>writers</HI> or <HI>preachers</HI>; but as the number of readers encreases, the number of hearers is pro∣portionably diminished, the writer becomes more useful, and the preaching Bonse less necessary.</P>
<P>Instead, therefore, of complaining that writers are overpaid, when their works procure them a bare subsistance, I should imagine it the duty of a state not only to encourage their numbers, but their industry. A Bonse is rewarded with im∣mense riches for instructing only a few, even of the most ignorant, of the people; and sure the poor scholar should not beg his bread, who is ca∣pable of instructing a million.</P>
<P>Of all rewards, I grant, the most pleasing to a man of real merit, is fame; but a polite age, of all times, is that in which scarce any share of me∣rit can acquire it. What numbers of fine writers in the latter empire of Rome, when refinement was carried to the highest pitch, have missed that fame and immortality which they had fondly arro∣gated to themselves? How many Greek authors, who wrote at that period when Constantinople was
<PB N="47" REF="55"/>
the refined mistress of the empire, now rest either not printed, or not read, in the libraries of Eu∣rope! Those who came first, while either state as yet was barbarous, carried all the reputation away. Authors, as the age refined, became more numerous, and their numbers destroyed their fame. It is but natural, therefore, for the writer, when conscious that his works will not procure him fame hereafter, to endeavour to make them turn out to his temporal interest here.</P>
<P>Whatever be the motives which induce men to write, whether avarice or fame, the country be∣comes most wise and happy, in which they most serve for instructors. The countries where sacer∣dotal instruction alone is permitted, remain in ig∣norance, superstition, and hopeless slavery. In England, where there are as many new books published as in all the rest of Europe together, a spirit of freedom and reason reigns among the people; they have been often known to act like fools, they are generally found to think like men.</P>
<P>The only danger that attends a multiplicity of publications, is that some of them may be calcu∣lated to injure, rather than benefit society. But where writers are numerous, they also serve as a check upon each other; and perhaps a literary inquisition is the most terrible punishment that can be conceived, to a literary transgressor.</P>
<P>But to do the English justice, there are but few offenders of this kind, their publications in general aim at mending either the heart, or im∣proving the common weal. The dullest writer talks of virtue, and liberty, and benevolence with
<PB N="48" REF="56"/>
esteem; tells his true story, filled with good and wholesome advice; warns against slavery, bribery, or the bite of a mad dog, and dresses up his lit∣tle useful magazine of knowledge and entertain∣ment, at least with a good intention. The dun∣ces of France, on the other hand, who have less encouragement, are more vicious. Tender hearts, languishing eyes, Leonora in love at thirteen, extatic transports, stolen blisses, are the frivolous subjects of their frivolous memoirs. In England, if a baw∣dy blockhead thus breaks in on the community, he sets his whole fraternity in a roar; nor can he escape, even though he should fly to nobility for shelter.</P>
<P>Thus even dunces, my friend, may make them∣selves useful. But there are others whom nature has blest with talents above the rest of mankind; men capable of thinking with precision, and impres∣sing their thought with rapidity. Beings who dif∣fuse those regards upon mankind, which others con∣tract and settle upon themselves. These deserve every honour from that community of which they are more peculiarly the children; to such I would give my heart, since to them I am indebted for its humanity! Adieu.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXIII.</HI> From Hingpo to Lien Chi Altangi, by the way of Moscow.</HEAD>
<P>I Still remain at <HI>Terki,</HI> where I have received that money which was remitted here in order to re∣lease me from captivity. My fair companion still
<PB N="49" REF="57"/>
improves in my esteem; the more I know her mind her beauty becomes more poignant; she ap∣pears charming, even among the daughters of <HI>Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cassia.</HI></P>
<P>Yet were I to examine her beauty with the art of a statuary, I should find numbers here that far surpass her; nature has not granted her all the boasted <HI>Circassian</HI> regularity of feature, and yet she greatly exceeds the fairest of the country, in the art of seizing the affections. Whence, have I often said to myself, this resistless magic that at∣tends even moderate charms: though I regard the beauties of the country with admiration, every interview weakens the impression, but the form of Zelis grows upon my imagination, I never behold her without an encrease of tenderness and respect. Whence this injustice of the mind in preferring imperfect beauty to that which nature seems to have finished with care? whence the infatuation, that he whom a comet could not amaze, should be astonished at a meteor! When reason was thus fatigued to find an answer, my imagination pur∣sued the subject, and this was the result.</P>
<P>I fancied myself placed between two land∣scapes, this called the <HI>region of beauty,</HI> and that <HI>the valley of the graces</HI>; the one adorned with all that luxuriant nature could bestow; the fruits of various climates adorned the trees, the grove resounded with music, the gale breathed per∣fume, every charm that could arise from symmetry and exact distribution were here conspicuous, the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ering a prospect of pleasure without end. <HI>The v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lley of the graces</HI> on the other hand, seemed by
<PB N="50" REF="58"/>
no means so inviting; the streams and the groves appeared just as they usually do in frequented coun∣tries; no magnificent parterres, no consort in the grove, the rivulet was edged with weeds, and the rook joined its voice to that of the nightingale. All was simplicity and nature.</P>
<P>The most striking objects ever first allure the traveller, I entered the region of beauty with encreased curiosity, and promised myself endless satisfaction in being introduced to the presiding goddess. I perceived several strangers, who en∣tered with the same design, and what surprised me not a little, was to see several others hastening to leave this abode of seeming felicity.</P>
<P>After some fatigue, I had at last the honour of being introduced to the goddess, who represented Beauty in person. She was seated on a throne, at the foot of which stood several strangers lately introduced like me; all regarding her form in extasy. <HI>Ah, what eyes! what lips! how clear her complexion! how perfect her shape!</HI> at these excla∣mations Beauty with downcast eyes, would en∣deavour to counterfeit modesty, but soon again looking round as if to confirm every spectator in his favourable sentiments, sometimes she would attempt to allure us by smiles; and at intervals would bridle back, in order to inspire us with respect as well as tenderness.</P>
<P>This ceremony lasted for some time, and had so much employed our eyes, that we had for∣got all this while that the goddess was silent. We soon however began to perceive the defect: <HI>what,</HI> said we, among each other, <HI>are we to have
<PB N="51" REF="59"/>
nothing but languishing airs, soft looks, and incli∣nations of the head, will the goddess only deign to satisfy our eyes?</HI> Upon this one of the company stepped up to present her with some fruits he had gathered by the way. She received the present, most sweetly smiling, and with one of the whitest hands in the world, but still not a word escaped her lips.</P>
<P>I now found that my companions grew weary of their homage; they went off one by one, and re∣solving not to be left hehind, I offered to go in my turn; when just at the door of the temple I was called back by a female, whose name was <HI>Pride,</HI> and who seemed displeased at the behaviour of the company. <HI>Where are you hastening?</HI> said she to me with an angry air, <HI>the goddess of beauty is here.</HI> I have been to visit her, Madam, replied I, and find her more beautiful even than report had made her. <HI>And why then will you leave her?</HI> added the female. I have seen her long enough, returned I; I have got all her features by heart. Her eyes are still the same. Her nose is a very fine one, but it is still just such a nose now as it was half an hour ago: could she throw a little more mind into her face, perhaps I should be for wishing to have more of her company. <HI>What signifies,</HI> replied my female, <HI>whether she has a mind or not; has she any occasion for a mind, so formed as she is by nature? If she had a common face, in∣deed, there might be some reason for thinking to im∣prove it; but when features are already perfect, every alteration would but impair them. A fine face is already at the point of perfection, and a fine lady should endeavour to keep it so; the impression it would
<PB N="52" REF="60"/>
receive from thought, would but disturb its whole oeconomy.</HI></P>
<P>To this speech I gave no reply, but made the best of my way to the valley of the Graces. Here I found all those who before had been my companions in the region of beauty, now upon the same errand.</P>
<P>As we entered the valley, the prospect insensi∣bly seemed to improve; we found every thing so natural, so domestic, and pleasing, that our minds, which before were congealed in admiration, now relaxed into gaiety and good-humour. We had designed to pay our respects to the presiding god∣dess, but she was no where to be found. One of our companions asserted, that her temple lay to the right; another, to the left; a third, insisted that it was straight before us; and a fourth, that we had left it behind. In short, we found every thing familiar and charming, but could not determine where to seek for the Grace in person.</P>
<P>In this agreeable incertitude we passed several hours, and though very desirous of finding the goddess, by no means impatient of the delay. Every part of the valley presented some minute beauty, which without offering itself at once, stole within the soul, and captivated us with the charms of our retreat. Still, however, we continued to search, and might still have continued, had we not been interrupted by a voice which, though we could not see from whence it came, addressed us in this manner:</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="61"/>"If you would find the goddess of Grace, seek her not under one form, for she assumes a thou∣sand, Ever changing under the eye of inspection, her variety, rather than her figure, is pleasing. In contemplating her beauty, the eye glides over every perfection with giddy delight, and, capable of fixing no where, is charmed with the whole.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vultus nimium lubricus aspici. Hor.</NOTE> She is now Contemplation with solemn look, again Compassion with humid eye; she now sparkles with joy, soon every feature speaks distress: her looks at times invite our approach, at others re∣press our presumption; the goddess cannot be properly called beautiful under any one of these forms, but by combining them all, she becomes irresistibly pleasing.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXIV.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>THE Shops of London are as well furnished as those of Pekin. Those of London have a picture hung at their door, informing the pas∣sengers what they have to sell, as those at Pekin have a board to assure the buyer, that they have no intentions to cheat him.</P>
<P>I was this morning to buy silk for a night-cap; immediately upon entering the mercer's shop, the master and his two men, with wigs plaistered with
<PB N="54" REF="62"/>
powder, appeared to ask my commands. They were certainly the civillest people alive; if I but looked, they flew to the place, where I cast my eye; every motion of mine sent them running round the whole shop for my satisfaction. I in∣formed them that I wanted what was good, and they shewed me not less than forty pieces, and each was better than the former; the prettiest pattern in nature, and the fittest in the world for night-caps. My very good friend, said I to the mercer, you must not pretend to instruct me in silks, I know these in particular to be no better than your mere flimsy <HI>Bungees. That may be,</HI> cried the mercer, who I afterwards found had never contradicted a man in his life, <HI>I can't pretend to say but they may; but I can assure you, my Lady Trail has had a sacque from this piece this very morning.</HI> But friend, said I, though my Lady has chosen a sacque from it, I see no necessity that I should wear it for a night∣cap. <HI>That may be,</HI> returned he again, <HI>yet what be∣comes a pretty Lady, will at any time look well on a handsome Gentleman.</HI> This short compliment was thrown in so very seasonably upon my ugly face, that even tho' I disliked the silk, I desired him to cut me off the pattern of a night-cap.</P>
<P>While this business was consigned to his journey∣man, the master himself took down some pieces of silk still finer than any I had yet seen, and spreading them before me, <HI>There,</HI> cries he, <HI>there's beauty, my Lord Snakeskin has bespoke the fellow to this for the birth-night this very morning; it would look charmingly in waistcoats.</HI> But I don't want a waistcoat, replied I: <HI>Not want a waistcoat,</HI> re∣turned the mercer; <HI>then I would advise you to buy one; when waistcoats are wanted, you may depend
<PB N="55" REF="63"/>
upon it they will come dear. Always buy before you want, and you are sure to be well used, as they say in Cheapside.</HI> There was so much justice in his advice, that I could not refuse taking it; besides, the silk, which was really a good one, encreased the temptation, so I gave orders for that too.</P>
<P>As I was waiting to have my bargains measured and cut, which I know not how, they executed but slowly; during the interval, the mercer enter∣tained me with the modern manner of some of the nobility receiving company in their morning gowns; <HI>Perhaps, Sir,</HI> adds he, <HI>you have a mind to see what kind of silk is universally worn.</HI> Without waiting for my reply, he spreads a piece before me, which might be reckoned beautiful even in China. <HI>If the nobility,</HI> continues he, <HI>were to know I sold this to any, under a Right Honourable, I should cer∣tainly lose their custom; you see, my Lord, it is at once rich, tastey, and quite the thing.</HI> I am no Lord, interrupted I.—<HI>I beg pardon,</HI> cried he, <HI>but be pleased to remember, when you intend buying a morning gown, that you had an offer from me of some∣thing worth money. Conscience, Sir, conscience is my way of dealing; you may buy a morning gown now, or you may stay till they become dearer and less fashi∣onable, but it is not my business to advise.</HI> In short, most reverend <HI>Fum,</HI> he persuaded me to buy a morning gown also, and would probably have per∣suaded me to have bought half the goods in his shop, if I had stayed long enough, or was fur∣nished with sufficient money.</P>
<P>Upon returning home, I could not help reflect∣ing with some astonishment, how this very man with such a confined education and capacity, was
<PB N="56" REF="64"/>
yet capable of turning me as he thought proper, and molding me to his inclinations! I know he was only answering his own purposes, even while he attempted to appear solicitous about mine; yet by a voluntary infatuation, a sort of passion compound∣ed of vanity and good nature, I walked into the snare with my eyes open, and put myself to future pain in order to give him immediate pleasure. The wisdom of the ignorant, somewhat resembles the instinct of animals; it is diffused in but a very narrow sphere, but within that circle it acts with vigour, uniformity, and success.</P>

<DIV1 N="75" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXV.</HI> From the same.</HEAD>
<P>FROM my former accounts you may be apt to fancy the English the most ridiculous people under the sun. They are indeed ridiculous: yet every other nation in Europe is equally so; each laughs at each, and the Asiatic at all.</P>
<P>I may, upon another occasion, point out what is most strikingly absurd in other countries; I shall at present consine myself only to France. The first national peculiarity a traveller meets upon entering that kingdom, is an odd sort of a staring vivacity in every eye, not excepting even the children; the people, it seems, have got it into their heads that they have more wit than others, and so stare in order to look smart.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="65"/>I know not how it happens, but there appears a sickly delicacy in the faces of their finest women. This may have introduced the use of paint, and paint produces wrinkles; so that a fine lady shall look like an hag at twenty-three. But as in some measure they never appear young, so it may be equally asserted, that they actually think them∣selves never old; a gentle Miss shall prepare for new conquests at sixty, shall hobble a rigadoon when she can scarce walk without a crutch, she shall affect the girl, play her fan and her eyes, and talk of sentiments, bleeding hearts, and expiring for love, when actually dying with age. Like a departing philosopher, she attempts to make her last mo∣ments the most brilliant of her life.</P>
<P>Their civility to strangers is what they are chiefly proud of; and to confess sincerely, their beggars are the very politest beggars I ever knew; in other places a traveller is addressed with a piteous whine, or a sturdy solemnity, but a French beggar shall ask your charity with a very genteel bow, and thank you for it with a smile and a shrugg.</P>
<P>Another instance of this people's breeding I must not forget. An Englishman would not speak his native language in a company of foreigners where he was sure that none understood him; a travelling Hottentot himself would be silent if acquainted only with the language of his country; but a French∣man shall talk to you whether you understand his language or not; never troubling his head whether you have learned French, still he keeps up the con∣versation, fixes his eye full in your face, and asks
<PB N="58" REF="66"/>
a thousand questions, which he answers himself for want of a more satisfactory reply.</P>
<P>But their civility to foreigners is not half so great as their admiration of themselves. Every thing that belongs to them and their nation is great; magnificent beyond expression; quite ro∣mantic! every garden is a paradise, every hovel a palace, and every woman an angel. They shut their eyes close, throw their mouths wide open, and cry out in rapture: Sacre! What beauty! O Ciel, what taste! mort de ma vie, what grandeur, was ever any people like ourselves; we are the na∣tion of men, and all the rest no better than two-legged barbarians.</P>
<P>I fancy the French would make the best cooks in the world, if they had but meat; as it is, they can dress you out five different dishes from a net∣tle-top, seven from a dock leaf, and twice as ma∣ny from a frog's haunches; these eat prettily e∣nough when one is a little used to them, are easy of digestion, and seldom overload the stomach with crudities. They seldom dine under seven hot dishes; it is true, indeed, with all this magnifi∣cence, they seldom spread a cloth before the guests; but in that I cannot be angry with them; since those who have got no linnen on their backs, may very well be excused for wanting it upon their tables.</P>
<P>Even religion itself loses its solemnity among them. Upon their roads, at about every five miles distance, you see an image of the Virgin Ma∣ry dressed up in grim head-cloaths, painted cheeks, and an old red petticoat; before her a lamp is of∣ten
<PB N="59" REF="67"/>
seen burning, at which, with the saint's per∣mission, I have frequently lighted my pipe. In∣stead of the Virgin you are sometimes presented with a crucifix, at other times with a wooden Sa∣viour, fitted out in complete garniture, with sponge, spear, nails, pincers, hammer, bees-wax, and vi∣negar-bottle. Some of these images, I have been told, came down from heaven; if so, in heaven they have but bungling workmen.</P>
<P>In passing through their towns, you frequently see the men sitting at the doors knitting stockings, while the care of cultivating the ground and prun∣ing the vines falls to the women. This is perhaps the reason why the fair sex are granted some pe∣culiar privileges in this country; particularly, when they can get horses, of riding without a side-saddle.</P>
<P>But I begin to think you may find this descrip∣tion pert and dull enough; perhaps it is so, yet in general it is the manner in which the French usually describe foreigners; and it is but just to <HI>force</HI> a part of that ridicule back upon them, which they attempt to lavish on others.</P>

<P>THE two theatres, which serve to amuse the citizens here, are again opened for the win∣ter. The mimetic troops, different from those of
<PB N="60" REF="68"/>
the state, begin their campaign when all the others quit the field; and at a time when the Europeans cease to destroy each other in reality, they are en∣tertained with mock battles upon the stage.</P>
<P>The dancing master once more shakes his quiver∣ing feet; the carpenter prepares his paradise of pasteboard; the hero resolves to cover his fore∣head with brass, and the heroine begins to scour up her copper tail, preparative to future operations; in short, all are in motion, from the theatrical letter-carrier in yellow cloaths, to Alexander the Great that stands on a stool.</P>
<P>Both houses have already commenced hostilities. War, open war! and no quarter received or given! Two singing women, like heralds, have begun the contest; the whole town is divided on this solemn occasion; one has the finest pipe, the other the finest manner; one curtesies to the ground, the other salutes the audience with a smile; one comes on with modesty which asks, the other with boldness which extorts applause; one wears powder, the other has none; one has the longest waist, but the other appears most easy; all, all is important and serious; the town as yet perseveres in its neutrality, a cause of such moment demands the most mature deliberation, they con∣tinue to exhibit, and it is very possible this con∣test may continue to please to the end of the season.</P>
<P>But the Generals of either army, have, as I am told, several reinforcements to lend occasional assistance. If they produce a pair of diamond buckles at one house, we have a pair of eye-brows
<PB N="61" REF="69"/>
that can match them at the other. If we outdo them in our attitude, they can overcome us by a shrug; if we can bring more children on the stage, they can bring more guards in red cloaths, who strut and shoulder their swords to the asto∣nishment of every spectator.</P>
<P>They tell me here, that people frequent the theatre in order to be instructed as well as amused. I smile to hear the assertion. If I ever go to one of their play-houses, what with trumpets, hallow∣ing behind the stage, and bawling upon it, I am quite dizzy before the performance is over. If I enter the house with any sentiments in my head, I am sure to have none going away, the whole mind being filled with a dead march, a funeral procession, a cat-call, a jigg, or a tempest.</P>
<P>There is perhaps nothing more easy than to write properly for the English theatre; I am amazed that none are apprenticed to the trade. The author, when well acquainted with the value of thunder and lightning, when versed in all the mystery of scene-shifting, and trap-doors; when skilled in the proper periods to introduce a wire-walker, or a water-fall; when instructed in every actor's peculiar talent, and capable of adapting his speeches to the supposed excellence; when thus instructed, knows all that can give a modern audience pleasure. One player shines in an excla∣mation, another in a groan, a third in a horror, a fourth in a start, a fifth in a smile, a sixth faints, and a seventh figets round the stage with pecu∣liar vivacity; that piece therefore will succeed best where each has a proper opportunity of shining; the actor's business is not so much to adapt
<PB N="62" REF="70"/>
himself to the poet, as the poet's to adapt him∣self to the actor.</P>
<P>The great secret therefore of tragedy-writing at present, is a perfect acquaintance with theatrical <HI>ah</HI>'s and <HI>oh</HI>'s, a certain number of these inter∣spersed with <HI>gods! tortures, racks,</HI> and <HI>damnation,</HI> shall distort every actor almost into convulsions, and draw tears from every spectator; a proper use of these will infallibly fill the whole house with applause. But above all, a whining scene must strike most forcibly. I would advise from my present knowledge of the audience, the two fa∣vourite players of the town to introduce a scene of this sort in every play. Towards the middle of the last act, I would have them enter with wild looks and out-spread arms; there is no necessity for speaking, they are only to groan at each other, they must vary the tones of exclamation and des∣pair through the whole theatrical gamut, wring their figures into every shape of distress, and when their calamities have drawn a proper quantity of tears from the sympathetic spectators, they may go off in dumb solemnity at different doors clasp∣ing their hands, or slapping their pocket-holes; this, which may be called a tragic pantomime, will answer every purpose of moving the passions, as well as words could have done, and it must save those expences which go to reward an author.</P>
<P>All modern plays that would keep the audience alive, must be conceived in this manner, and in∣deed, many a modern play is made up on no other plan. This is the merit that lifts up the heart, like opium, into a rapture of insensibility, and can dismiss the mind from all the fatigue of thinking: this is the eloquence that shines in many
<PB N="63" REF="71"/>
a long forgotten scene, which has been reckoned ex∣cessive fine upon acting; this the lightening that flashes no less in the Hyperbolical tyrant, <HI>who break∣fasts on the wind,</HI> than in little Norval, <HI>as harmless as the babe unborn.</HI> Adieu.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXVII.</HI> From the same.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE always regarded the spirit of mercy, which appears in the Chinese laws with admira∣tion. An order for the execution of a criminal is carried from court by slow journies of six miles a day, but a pardon is sent down with the most rapid dispatch. If five sons of the same father be guilty of the same offence, one of them is forgiven, in or∣der to continue the family and comfort his aged parents in their decline.</P>
<P>Similar to this, there is a spirit of mercy breathes through the laws of England, which some erroneously endeavour to suppress; the laws how∣ever seem unwilling to punish the offender, or to furnish the officers of justice with every means of acting with severity. Those who arrest debtors are denied the use of arms, the nightly watch is permitted to repress the disorders of the drunken citizens only with clubs; justice in such a case seems to hide her terrors, and permits some of∣fenders to escape rather than load any with a punishment disproportioned to the crime.</P>
<P>Thus it is the glory of an Englishman, that he is not only governed by laws, but that these are
<PB N="64" REF="72"/>
also tempered by mercy; a country restrained by severe laws, and those too executed with severity (as in Japan) is under the most terrible species of tyranny; a royal tyrant is generally dreadful to the great, but numerous penal laws grind every rank of people, and chiefly those least able to re∣sist oppression, the poor.</P>
<P>It is very possible, thus for a people to become slaves to laws of their own enacting, as the Athe∣nians were to those of Draco. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'It might first happen (says the historian) that men with pecu∣liar talents for villainy attempted to evade the ordinances already established; their practices therefore soon brought on a new law levelled against them; but the same degree of cunning which had taught the knave to evade the former statutes, taught him to evade the latter also; he flew to new shifts, while justice pursued with new ordinances; still however he kept his pro∣per distance, and whenever one crime was judged penal by the state, he left committing it in order to practise some unforbidden species of villainy. Thus the criminal against whom the threatenings were denounced always escaped free; while the simple rogue alone felt the rigour of justice. In the mean time penal laws became numerous, almost every person in the state unknowingly at different times offended, and was every moment subject to a malicious prosecution.'</Q> In fact, penal laws, instead of preventing crimes, are ge∣nerally enacted after the commission; instead of repressing the growth of ingenious villainy, only multiply deceit, by putting it upon new shifts and expedients of practising with impunity.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="73"/>Such laws therefore resemble the guards which are sometimes imposed upon tributary Princes, apparently indeed to secure them from danger, but in reality, to confirm their captivity.</P>
<P>Penal laws, it must be allowed, secure property in a state, but they also diminish personal security in the same proportion: There is no positive law how equitable soever, that may not be sometimes capable of injustice. When a law enacted to make theft punishable with death, happens to be equi∣tably executed, it can at best only guard our possessions; but when by favour or ignorance jus∣tice pronounces a wrong verdict, it then attacks our lives, since in such a case the whole commu∣nity suffers with the innocent victim; if therefore in order to secure the effects of one man, I should make a law which may take away the life of ano∣ther, in such a case to attain a smaller good, I am guilty of a greater evil, to secure society in the possession of a bauble, I render a real and valuable possession precarious. And indeed the experience of every age may serve to vindicate the assertion: No law could be more just than that called <HI>lesae Majestatis,</HI> when Rome was go∣verned by Emperors. It was but reasonable, that every conspiracy against the administration should be detected and punished; yet what terrible slaughters succeeded in consequence of its enact∣ing; proscriptions, stranglings, poisonings, in al∣most every family of distinction, yet all done in a legal way, every criminal had his trial, and lost his life by a majority of witnesses.</P>
<P>And such will ever be the case, where punish∣ments are numerous, and where a weak, vicious,
<PB N="66" REF="74"/>
but above all, where a mercenary magistrate is concerned in their execution; such a man desires to see penal laws encreased, since he too frequently has it in his power to turn them into instruments of extortion; in such hands the more laws, the wider means, not of satisfying justice, but of sa∣tiating avarice.</P>
<P>A mercenary magistrate who is rewarded in pro∣portion, not to his integrity, but to the number he convicts, must be a person of the most un∣blemished character, or he will lean on the side of cruelty; and when once the work of injustice is begun, it is impossible to tell how far it will proceed; it is said of the Hyena that naturally it is no way ravenous, but when once it has tasted human flesh, it becomes the most voracious animal of the forest, and continues to persecute mankind ever after: A corrupt magistrate may be considered as a human Hyena, he begins perhaps by a pri∣vate snap, he goes on to a morsel among friends, he proceeds to a meal in public, from a meal he ad∣vances to a surfeit, and at last sucks blood like a vampyre.</P>
<P>Not into such hands should the administration of justice be entrusted, but to those who know how to reward as well as to punish; it was a fine saying of Nangfu the emperor, who being told that his enemies had raised an insurrection in one of the distant provinces, Come then, my friends, said he, follow me, and I promise you that we shall quickly destroy them; he marched forward, and the rebels submitted upon his approach. All now thought that he would take the most signal revenge, but were surprized to see the captives
<PB N="67" REF="75"/>
treated with mildness and humanity. How! cries his first minister, is this the manner in which you fulfil your promise? your royal word was given that your enemies should be destroyed, and behold you have pardoned all, and even cares∣sed some! I promised, replied the emperor, with a generous air, to <HI>destroy</HI> my enemies, I have ful∣filled my word, for see they are enemies no longer; I have made <HI>friends</HI> of them.</P>
<P>This, could it always succeed, were the true method of destroying the enemies of a state; well it were if rewards and mercy alone could regulate the common-wealth; but since punishments are sometimes necessary, let them at least be rendered terrible, by being executed but seldom, and let justice lift her sword rather to terrify than revenge.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXVIII.</HI> From the same.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE as yet given you but a short and im∣perfect description of the Ladies of England. Woman, my friend, is a subject not easily under∣stood, even in China; what therefore can be ex∣pected from my knowledge of the sex in a coun∣try where they are universally allowed to be riddles, and I but a stranger?</P>
<P>To confess a truth, I was afraid to begin the description, lest the sex should undergo some new revolution before it was finished; and my picture
<PB N="68" REF="76"/>
should thus become old before it could well be said to have ever been new. To-day they are lifted upon stilts, to-morrow they lower their heels and raise their heads; their cloaths at one time are bloated out with whalebone, at present they have laid their hoops aside and are become as slim as mermaids. All, all is in a state of continual fluctuation, from the Mandarine's wife, who rat∣tles through the streets in her chariot, to the hum∣ble sempstress, who clatters over the pavement in iron-shod pattens.</P>
<P>What chiefly distinguishes the sex at present is the train. As a Lady's quality or fashion was once determined here by the circumference of her hoop, both are now measured by the length of her tail. Women of moderate fortunes are contented with tails moderately long; but ladies of true taste and distinction set no bounds to their ambition in this particular. I am told the Lady Mayoress, on days of ceremony, carries one longer than a bell-wether of Bantam, whose tail you know is trund∣led along in a wheel-barrow.</P>
<P>Sun of China, what contradictions do we find in this strange world! not only the people of dif∣ferent countries think in opposition to each other, but the inhabitants of a single island are often found inconsistent with themselves; would you believe it? this very people, my Fum, who are so fond of seeing their women with long tails, at the same time dock their horses to the very rump!!!</P>
<P>But you may easily guess that I am no way displeased with a fashion which tends to encrease a demand for the commodities of the East, and is so
<PB N="69" REF="77"/>
very beneficial to the country in which I was born. Nothing can be better calculated to encrease the price of silk than the present manner of dressing. A lady's train is not bought but at some expence, and after it has swept the public walks for a very few evenings, is fit to be worn no longer: more silk must be bought in order to repair the breach, and some ladies of peculiar oeconomy are thus found to patch up their tails eight or ten times in a season. This unnecessary consumption may in∣troduce poverty here, but then we shall be the richer for it in China.</P>
<P>The man in black, who is a professed enemy to this manner of ornamenting the tail, assures me, there are numberless inconveniencies attend∣ing it, and that a lady dressed up to the fashion is as much a cripple as any in Nankin. But his chief indignation is levelled at those who dress in this manner, without a proper fortune to support it. He assures me, that he has known some, who would have a tail, though they wanted a petticoat, and others, who, without any other pretensions, fan∣cied they became ladies merely from the addition of three superfluous yards of ragged silk; I know a thrifty good woman, continues he, who thinking herself obliged to carry a train like her betters, never walks from home without the uneasy apprehen∣sions of wearing it out too soon; every excursion she makes gives her new anxiety, and her train is every bit as importunate, and wounds her peace as much as the bladder we sometimes see tied to the tail of a cat.</P>
<P>Nay, he ventures to affirm, that a train may often bring a lady into the most critical circum∣stances; for should a rude fellow, says he, offer
<PB N="70" REF="78"/>
to come up to ravish a kiss, and the lady attempt to avoid it, in retiring she must necessarily tread upon her train, and thus fall fairly upon her back, by which means every one knows,— her cloaths may be spoiled.</P>
<P>The ladies here make no scruple to laugh at the smallness of a Chinese slipper, but I fancy our wives at China would have a more real cause of laughter, could they but see the immoderate length of an European train. Head of Confucius, to view a human being crippling herself with a great unwieldy tail for our diversion; backward she cannot go, forward she must move but slowly, and if ever she attempts to turn round, it must be in a circle not smaller than that described by the wheeling crocodile, when it would face an assailant. And yet to think that all this confers importance and majesty! to think that a lady acquires ad∣ditional respect from fifteen yards of trailing taf∣fety! I can't contain; ha, ha, ha; this is certainly a remnant of European barbarity, the female Tartar dressed in sheep-skins, is in far more conve∣nient drapery. Their own writers have some∣times inveigh'd against the absurdity of this fashi∣on, but perhaps it has never been ridiculed so well as upon the Italian theatre, where Pasqua∣rielo being engaged to attend on the countess of Fernambroco, having one of his hands employed in carrying her muff, and the other her lap-dog, he bears her train majestically along by sticking it in the waistband of his breeches.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXIX.</HI> From the same.</HEAD>
<P>A Dispute has for some time divided the philo∣sophers of Europe; it is debated, whether arts and sciences are more serviceable or preju∣dicial to mankind. They, who maintain the cause of literature, endeavour to prove their use∣fulness from the impossibility of a large number of men subsisting in a small tract of country with∣out them; from the pleasure which attends the acquisition; and from the influence of knowledge in promoting practical morality.</P>
<P>They who maintain the opposite opinion, dis∣play the happiness and innocence of those un∣cultivated nations who live without learning; urge the numerous vices which are to be found only in polished society, enlarge upon the oppression, the cruelty and the blood which must necessarily be shed, in order to cement civil society, and in∣sist upon the happy equality of conditions in a bar∣barous state, preferable to the unnatural subordi∣nation of a more refined constitution.</P>
<P>This dispute, which has already given so much employment to speculative indolence, has been managed with much ardour, and (not to sup∣press our sentiments) with but little sagacity. They who insist that the sciences are useful in <HI>refined</HI> society are certainly right, and they who maintain that <HI>barbarous</HI> nations are more happy without them, are right also; but when one side for this reason attempts to prove them as universally
<PB N="72" REF="80"/>
useful to the solitary barbarian, as to the native of a crowded common-wealth; or when the other endeavours to banish them as prejudicial to all society, even from populous states as well as from the inhabitants of the wilderness, they are both wrong; since that knowledge which makes the hap∣piness of a refined European, would be a torment to the precarious tenant of an Asiatic wild.</P>
<P>Let me, to prove this, transport the imagina∣tion for a moment to the midst of a forest in Si∣beria. There we behold the inhabitant, poor in∣deed, but equally fond of happiness with the most refined philosopher of China. The earth lies un∣cultivated and uninhabited for miles around him; his little family and he the sole and un∣disputed possessors. In such circumstances nature and reason will induce him to prefer a hunter's life to that of cultivating the earth. He will certainly adhere to that manner of living which is carried on at the smallest expence of labour, and that food which is most agreeable to the appetite, he will prefer indolent though precarious luxury, to a laborious though permanent competence, and a knowledge of his own happiness will deter∣mine him to persevere in native barbarity.</P>
<P>In like manner his happiness will incline him to bind himself by no law: Laws are made in order to secure present property, but he is pos∣sessed of no property which he is afraid to lose, and desires no more than will be sufficient to sus∣tain him; to enter into compacts with others, would be undergoing a voluntary obligation with∣out the expectance of any reward. He and his countrymen are tenants, not rivals, in the same
<PB N="73" REF="81"/>
inexhaustible forest; the encreased possessions of one by no means diminishes the expectations arising from equal assiduity in another; there are no need of laws therefore to repress ambition, where there can be no mischief attending its most boundless gratifications.</P>
<P>Our solitary Siberian will, in like manner, find the sciences not only entirely useless in directing his practice, but disgusting even in speculation. In every contemplation our curiosity must be first excited by the <HI>appearances</HI> of things, before our reason undergoes the fatigue of investigating the <HI>causes.</HI> Some of those appearances are pro∣duced by experiment, others by minute enquiry; some arise from a knowledge of foreign climates, and others from an intimate study of our own. But there are few objects in comparison which present themselves to the inhabitant of a bar∣barous country; the game he hunts, or the transient cottage he builds, make up the chief objects of his concern; his curiosity therefore must be proportionably less; and if that is dimi∣nished, the reasoning faculty will be diminished in proportion.</P>
<P>Besides, sensual enjoyment adds wings to curi∣osity. We consider few objects with ardent atten∣tion, but those which have some connection with our wishes, our pleasures, or our necessities. A desire of enjoyment first interests our passions in the pursuit, points out the object of investigation, and reason then comments where sense has led the way. An encrease in the number of our enjoy∣ments therefore necessarily produces an encrease
<PB N="74" REF="82"/>
of scientific research; but in countries where al∣most every enjoyment is wanting, reason there seems destitute of its great inspirer, and specula∣tion is the business of fools when it becomes its own reward.</P>
<P>The barbarous Siberian is too wise, therefore, to exhaust his time in quest of knowledge, which neither curiosity prompts, nor pleasure impells him to pursue. When told of the exact admeasure∣ment of a degree upon the equator at Quito, he feels no pleasure in the account; when informed that such a discovery tends to promote navigation and commerce, he finds himself no way interested in either. A discovery which some have pursued at the hazard of their lives, affects him with neither astonishment nor pleasure. He is satisfied with thoroughly understanding the few objects which contribute to his own felicity, he knows the properest places where to lay the snare for the sable, and discerns the value of furrs with more than European sagacity. More extended know∣ledge would only serve to render him unhappy, it might lend a ray to shew him the misery of his situation, but could not guide him in his efforts to avoid it. Ignorance is the happiness of the poor.</P>
<P>The misery of a being endowed with sentiments above its capacity of fruition, is most admirably described in one of the fables of Locman the Indian moralist. "An elephant that had been peculiarly serviceable in fighting the battles of Wistnow, was ordered by the god to wish for whatever he thought proper, and the desire should be attended with immediate gratification. The elephant thanked his benefactor on bended knees,
<PB N="75" REF="83"/>
and desired to be endowed with the reason and the faculties of a man. Wistnow was sorry to hear the foolish request, and endeavoured to dis∣suade him from his misplaced ambition; but find∣ing it to no purpose, gave him at last such a portion of wisdom as could correct even the Zendavesta of Zoroaster. The reasoning elephant went away rejoicing in his new acquisition, and though his body still retained its ancient form, he found his appetites and passions entirely altered. He first considered that it would not only be more com∣fortable, but also more becoming to wear cloaths; but unhappily he had no method of making them himself, nor had he the use of speech to demand them from others, and this was the first time he felt real anxiety. He soon perceived how much more elegantly men were fed than he, therefore he began to loath his usual food and longed for those delicacies which adorn the tables of princes; but here again he found it impossible to be satis∣fied; for though he could easily obtain flesh, yet he sound it impossible to dress it in any degree of perfection. In short, every pleasure that contri∣buted to the felicity of mankind, served only to render him more miserable., as he found himself utterly deprived of the power of enjoyment. In this manner he led a repining, discontented life, detesting himself and displeased with his ill judged ambition, till at last his benefactor Wistnow, tak∣ing compassion on his forlorn situation, restored him to the ignorance and the happiness which he was originally formed to enjoy."</P>
<P>No, my friend, to attempt to introduce the sci∣ences into a nation of wandering barbarians, is only
<PB N="76" REF="84"/>
to render them more miserable than even nature designed they should be. A life of simplicity is best fitted to a state of solitude.</P>
<P>The great law-giver of Russia attempted to improve the desolate inhabitants of Siberia, by sending among them some of the politest men of Europe. The consequence has shewn, that the country was as yet unfit to receive them; they languished for a time with a sort of exotic malady, every day degenerated from themselves, and at last, instead of rendering the country more polite, they conformed to the soil, and put on barbarity.</P>
<P>No, my friend, in order to make the sciences use∣ful in any country, it must first become populous; the inhabitant must go through the different stages of hunter, shepherd▪ and husbandman: then when property becomes valuable, and consequently gives cause for injustice, then when laws are appointed to repress injury, and secure possession, when men, by the sanction of those laws, become possessed of superfluity, when luxury is thus introduced and demands its continual supply then it is that the sci∣ences become necessary and useful; the state then cannot subsist without them; they must then be introduced, at once to teach men to draw the greatest possible quantity of pleasure from circum∣scribed possession; and to restrain them within the bounds of moderate enjoyment.</P>
<P>The sciences are not the cause of luxury, but its consequence, and this destroyer thus brings with it an antidote which resists the virulence of its own poison. By asserting that luxury intro∣duces the sciences, we assert a truth; but if with those, who reject the utility of learning▪ we
<PB N="77" REF="85"/>
assert that the sciences also introduce luxury, we shall be at once false, absurd, and ridiculous.</P>

<P>YOU are now arrived at an age, my son, when pleasure dissuades from application, but rob not by present gratification all the succeeding pe∣riod of life of its happiness Sacrifice a little pleasure at first to the expectance of greater. The study of a very few years will make the rest of life compleatly easy.</P>
<P>But instead of continuing the subject myself, take the following instructions borrowed from a modern philosopher of China<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A translation of this passage may also be seen in Du Halde, Vol. II. Fol. p. 47, and 58. This extract will at least serve to shew that fondness for humour which appears in the writings of the Chinese.</NOTE>. "He who has begun his fortune by study will certainly confirm it by perseverance. The love of books damps the passion for pleasure, and when this passion is once extinguished, life is then cheaply supported; thus a man being possessed of more than he wants, can never be subject to great disappoint∣ments, and avoids all those meannesses which in∣digence sometimes unavoidably produces.</P>
<P>"There is unspeakable pleasure attending the life of a voluntary student. The first time I read
<PB N="78" REF="86"/>
an excellent book, it is to me just as if I had gained a new friend. When I read over a book I have perused before, it resembles the meeting with an old one. We ought to lay hold of every incident in life for improvement, the trifling as well as the important. It is not one diamond alone which gives lustre to another, a common coarse stone is also employed for that purpose. Thus I ought to draw advantage from the insults and con∣tempt I meet with from a worthless fellow. His brutality ought to induce me to self-examination, and correct every blemish that may have given rise to his calumny.</P>
<P>"Yet with all the pleasures and profits which are generally produced by learning, parents often find it difficult to induce their children to study. They often seem dragged to what wears the appearance of application. Thus being dilatory in the begin∣ning, all future hopes of eminence are entirely cut off. If they find themselves obliged to write two lines more polite than ordinary, their pencil then seems as heavy as a mill-stone, and they spend ten years in turning two or three periods with propriety.</P>
<P>"These persons are most at a loss when a banquet is almost over; the plate and the dice go round, that the number of little verses which each is obliged to repeat may be determined by chance. The booby, when it comes to his turn, appears quite stupid and insensible. The company divert themselves with his confusion; and sneers, winks, and whispers are circulated at his expence. As for him, he opens a pair of large heavy eyes, stares at all about him, and even offers to join in the laugh,
<PB N="79" REF="87"/>
without ever considering himself as the burthen of all their good humour.</P>
<P>"But it is of no importance to read much, except you be regular in your reading. If it be interrupted for any considerable time, it can never be attended with proper improvement. There are some who study for one day with intense application, and re∣pose themselves for ten days after. But wisdom is a coquet, and must be courted with unabating assiduity.</P>
<P>"It was a saying of the ancients, that a man never opens a book without reaping some advan∣tage by it. I say with them, that every book can serve to make us more expert, except romances, and these are no better than instruments of de∣bauchery. They are dangerous fictions, where love is the ruling passion.</P>
<P>"The most indecent strokes there pass for turns of wit, intrigue and criminal liberties for gallantry and politeness. Assignations, and even villainy, are put in such strong lights, as may inspire, even grown men, with the strongest passion; how much more therefore ought the youth of either sex to dread them, whose reason is so weak, and whose hearts are so susceptible of passion?</P>
<P>"To slip in by a back-door, or leap a wall, are accomplishments that when handsomely set off en∣chant a young heart. It is true the plot is com∣monly wound up by a marriage, concluded with the consent of parents, and adjusted by every cere∣mony prescribed by law. But as in the body of the work there are many passages that offend good
<PB N="80" REF="88"/>
morals, overthrow laudable customs, violate the laws, and destroy the duties most essential to so∣ciety, virtue is thereby exposed to the most dan∣gerous attacks.</P>
<P>"But, say some, the authors of these romances have nothing in view, but to represent vice punish∣ed and virtue rewarded. Granted. But will the greater number of readers take notice of these punishments and rewards? Are not their minds carried to something else? Can it be imagined that the art with which the author inspires the love of virtue, can overcome that crowd of thoughts which sway them to licentiousness? To be able to inculcate virtue by so leaky a vehicle, the author must be a philosopher of the first rank. But in our age we can find but few first rate philoso∣phers.</P>
<P>"Avoid such performances where vice assumes the face of virtue; seek wisdom and knowledge without ever thinking you have found them. A man is wise, while he continues in the pursuit of wisdom; but when he once fancies that he has found the object of his enquiry, he then becomes a fool. Learn to pursue virtue from the man that is blind, who never makes a step without first ex∣amining the ground with his staff.</P>
<P>"The world is like a vast sea, mankind like a vessel sailing on its tempestuous bosom. Our pru∣dence is its sails, the sciences serve us for oars, good or bad fortune are the favourable or con∣trary winds, and judgment is the rudder; with∣out this last the vessel is tossed by every billow, and will find shipwreck in every breeze.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXXI.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>I Fancy the character of a poet is in every coun∣try the same, fond of enjoying the present, careless of the future, his conversation that of a man of sense, his actions those of a fool! of for∣titude able to stand unmoved at the bursting of an earthquake, yet of sensibility to be affected by the breaking of a tea-cup; such is his character, which considered in every light is the very opposite of that which leads to riches.</P>
<P>The poets of the west are as remarkable for their indigence as their genius, and yet among the numerous hospitals designed to relieve the poor, I have heard of but one erected for the be∣nefit of decayed authors. This was founded by pope Urban VIII. and called the retreat of the incurables, intimating, that it was equally impos∣sible to reclaim the patients, who sued for reception, from poverty, or from poetry. To be sincere, were I to send you an account of the lives of the western poets, either antient or modern, I fancy
<PB N="82" REF="90"/>
you would think me employed in collecting ma∣terials for an history of human wretchedness.</P>
<P>Homer is the first poet and beggar of note among the antients; he was blind, and sung his ballads about the streets; but it is observed, that his mouth was more frequently filled with verses than with bread. Plautus the comic poet was better off; he had two trades, he was a poet for his diversion, and helped to turn a mill in order to gain a livelihood. Terence was a slave, and Boe∣thius died in a jail.</P>
<P>Among the Italians, Paulo Burghese, almost as good a poet as Tasso, knew fourteen different trades, and yet died because he could get em∣ployment in none. Tasso himself, who had the most amiable character of all poets, has often been obliged to borrow a crown from some friend, in order to pay for a month's subsistence; he has left us a pretty sonnet, addressed to his cat, in which he begs the light of her eyes to write by, being too poor to afford himself a candle. But Bentivoglio, poor Bentivoglio! chiefly demands our pity. His comedies will last with the Ita∣lian language; he dissipated a noble fortune in acts of charity and benevolence; but falling into misery in his old age, was refused to be admitted into an hospital which he himself had erected.</P>
<P>In Spain it is said, the great Cervantes died of hunger; and it is certain, that the famous Camoens ended his days in an hospital.</P>
<P>If we turn to France, we shall there find even stronger instances of the ingratitude of the public. Vaugelas, one of the politest writers, and one of the
<PB N="83" REF="91"/>
honestest men of his time, was sirnamed the Owl, from his being obliged to keep within all day, and venture out only by night, through fear of his cre∣ditors. His last will is very remarkable; after having bequeathed all his worldly substance to the discharg∣ing his debts, he goes on thus; But as there still may remain some creditors unpaid, even after all that I have shall be disposed of, in such a case, it is my last will, that my body should be sold to the surgeons to the best advantage, and that the purchase should go to the discharging those debts which I owe to society; so that if I could not, while living, at least when dead, I may be useful.</P>
<P>Cassander was one of the greatest geniuses of his time, yet all his merit could not procure him a bare subsistence. Being by degrees driven into an hatred of all mankind from the little pity he found amongst them, he even ventured at last un∣gratefully to impute his calamities to providence. In his last agonies, when the priest entreated him to rely on the justice of heaven, and ask mercy from him that made him; <HI>If God,</HI> replies he, <HI>has shewn me no justice here, what reason have I to expect any from him hereafter?</HI> But being answered, that a suspension of justice was no argument that should induce us to doubt of its reality; let me entreat you, continued his confessor, by all that is dear, to be reconciled to God, your father, your mak∣er, and friend. <HI>No,</HI> replied the exasperated wretch, <HI>you know the manner in which he left me to live</HI>; (and pointing to the straw on which he was stretched) <HI>and you see the manner in which he leaves me to die!</HI></P>
<P>But the sufferings of the poet in other countries is nothing when compared to his distresses here, the names of Spencer and Otway, Butler and Dryden,
<PB N="84" REF="92"/>
are every day mentioned as a national reproach, some of them lived in a state of precarious indi∣gence, and others literally died of hunger.</P>
<P>At present the few poets of England no longer depend on the Great for subsistence, they have now no other patrons but the public, and the pub∣lic, collectively considered, is a good and a gene∣rous master. It is indeed, too frequently mistaken as to the merits of every candidate for favour; but to make amends, it is never mistaken long. A performance indeed may be forced for a time into reputation, but destitute of real merit it soon sinks; time, the touchstone of what is truly valu∣able, will soon discover the fraud, and an author should never arrogate to himself any share of suc∣cess, till his works have been read at least ten years with satisfaction.</P>
<P>A man of letters at present, whose works are valuable, is perfectly sensible of their value. Every polite member of the community by buying what he writes, contributes to reward him. The ridicule therefore of living in a garret, might have been wit in the last age, but continues such no longer, because no longer true. A writer of real merit now may easily be rich if his heart be set only on fortune: and for those who have no merit, it is but fit that such should remain in merited ob∣scurity. He may now refuse an invitation to dinner, without fearing to incur his patron's displeasure, or to starve by remaining at home. He may now venture to appear in company with just such cloaths as other men generally wear, and talk even to princes, with all the conscious superiority of wisdom. Though he cannot boast of fortune here, yet he can bravely assert the dignity of inde∣pendence. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXXII.</HI> From the same.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE interested myself so long in all the concerns of this people, that I am almost be∣come an Englishman; I now begin to read with pleasure of their taking towns or gaining battles, and secretly wish disappointment to all the enemies of Britain. Yet still my regard to mankind fills me with concern for their contentions. I could wish to see the disturbances of Europe once more ami∣cably adjusted: I am an enemy to nothing in this good world but war; I hate fighting between rival states; I hate it between man and man; I hare fighting even between women!</P>
<P>I already informed you, that while Europe was at variance, we were also threatened from the stage with an irreconcileable opposition, and that our singing women were resolved to sing at each other to the end of the season. O my friend, those fears were just. They are nor only determined to sing at each other to the end of the season, but what is worse, to sing the same song, and what is still more insupportable, to make us pay for hearing.</P>
<P>If they be for war, for my part I should advise them to have a public congress, and there fairly squall at each other. What signifies sounding the trumpet of defiance at a distance, and calling in the town to fight their battles. I would have them come boldly into one of the most open and frequented streets, face to face, and there try their still in quavering.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="94"/>However this may be, resolved I am that they shall not touch one single piece of silver more of mine. Though I have ears for music, thanks to heaven, they are not altogether asses ears. What! Polly and the Pick-pocket to-night, Polly and the Pick-pocket to-morrow night, and Polly and the Pick-pocket again; I want patience. I'll hear no more. My soul is out of tune, all jarring dis∣cord, and confusion. Rest, rest, ye three dear clinking shillings in my pocket's bottom; the mu∣sic you make is more harmonious to my spirit, than cat-gut, rosin, or all the nightingales that ever chirruped in petticoats.</P>
<P>But what raises my indignation to the greatest degree, is that this piping does not only pester me on the stage, but is my punishment in private conversation. What is it to me, whether the <HI>fine pipe</HI> of one, or the <HI>great manner</HI> of the other be pre∣ferable? what care I if one has a better top, or the other a nobler bottom? how am I concerned if one sings from the stomach, or the other sings with a snap? yet paltry as these matters are, they make a subject of debate wherever I go, and this musical dispute, especially among the fair sex, almost always ends in a very unmusical altercation.</P>
<P>Sure the spirit of contention is mixed into the very constitution of the people; divisions among the inhabitants of other countries arise only from their higher concerns, but subjects the most con∣temptible are made an affair of party here, the spirit is carried even into their amusements. The very ladies, whose duty should seem to allay the impetuosity of the opposite sex, become them∣selves party champions, engage in the thickest of

the fight, scold at each other, and shew their courage, even at the expence of their lovers and their beauty.</P>
<P>There are even a numerous set of poets who help to keep up the contention, and write for the stage. Mistake me not, I don't mean pieces to be acted upon it, but panegyrical verses on the per∣formers, for that is the most universal method of writing for the stage at present. It is the business of the stage-poet therefore to watch the appearance of every new player at his own house, and so come out next day with a flaunting copy of news∣paper verses. In these nature and the actor may be set to run races, the player always coming off victorious; or nature may mistake him for her∣self; or old Shakespear may put on his winding-sheet and pay him a visit; or the tuneful nine may strike up their harps in his praise; or should it happen to be an actress, Venus, the beauteous queen of love, and the naked graces, are ever in wait∣ing: the lady must be herself a goddess bred and born; she must—but you shall have a specimen of one of these poems, which may convey a more precise idea.</P>

<P>And yet think not, my friend, that I have any particular animosity against the champions who are at the head of the present commotion; on the contrary, I could find pleasure in their music, if served up at proper intervals; if I heard it only on proper occasions, and not about it wherever I go. In fact, I could patronize them both; and as an instance of my condescension in this par∣ticular, they may come and give me a song at my lodgings, on any evening when I'm at leisure, provided they keep a becoming distance, and stand, while they continue to entertain me, with decent humility at the door.</P>
<P>You perceive I have not read the seventeen books of Chinese ceremonies to no purpose. I know the proper share of respect due to every rank in society. Stage-players, fire eaters, singing women, dancing-dogs, wild beasts, and wire-walkers, as their efforts are exerted for our amuse∣ment, ought not <HI>entirely</HI> to be despised. The laws of every country should allow them to play their tricks at least with impunity. They should not be branded with the ignominious appellation of vagabonds; at least they deserve a rank in society equal to the mystery of barbers, or undertakers, and could my influence extend so far, they should
<PB N="89" REF="97"/>
be allowed to earn even forty or fifty pounds a year, if eminent in their profession.</P>
<P>I am sensible however that you will censure me of profusion in this respect, bred up as you are in the narrow prejudices of eastern frugality. You will undoubtedly assert, that such a stipend is too great for so useless an employment. Yet how will your surprize encrease, when told, that though the law holds them as vagabonds, many of them earn more than a thousand a year. You are amazed. There is cause for amazement. A vagabond with a thousand a year is indeed a cu∣riosity in nature; a wonder far surpassing the flying fish, petrified crab, or travelling lobster. However, from my great love to the profession, I would willingly have them divested of part of their contempt, and part of their finery; the law should kindly take them under the wing of pro∣tection, fix them into a corporation, like that of the barbers, and abridge their ignominy and their pensions. As to their abilities in other respects, I would leave that entirely to the public, who are certainly in this case the properest judges—— whether they despise them or no.</P>
<P>Yes, my <HI>Fum,</HI> I would abridge their pensions. A theatrical warrior, who conducts the battles of the stage, should be cooped up with the same caution as a Bantum cock that is kept for fighting. When one of those animals is taken from its na∣tive dunghill, we retrench it both in the quantity of its food, and the number of its seraglio: play∣ers should in the same manner be fed, not fat∣tened; they should be permitted to get their bread, but not eat the people's bread into the bargain;
<PB N="90" REF="98"/>
and, instead of being permitted to keep four mis∣tresses, in conscience they should be contented only with two.</P>
<P>Were stage-players thus brought into bounds, perhaps we should find their admirers less san∣guine, and consequently less ridiculous in patroniz∣ing them. We should no longer be struck with the absurdity of seeing the same people, whose va∣lour makes such a figure abroad, apostrophizing in the praise of a bouncing blockhead, and wrangling in the defence of a copper-tailed actress at home.</P>
<P>I shall conclude my letter with the sensible ad∣monition of <HI>Mê</HI> the philosopher. "You love harmony, says he, and are charmed with music. I do not blame you for hearing a fine voice, when you are in your closet with a lovely parterre under your eye, or in the night time, while perhaps the moon diffuses her silver rays. But is a man to carry this passion so far as to let a company of co∣medians, musicians, and singers, grow rich upon his exhausted fortune? If so, he resembles one of those dead bodies, whose brains the embalmers have picked out through its ears."</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXXIII.</HI> From the same.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the places of amusement where gentlemen and ladies are entertained, I have not been yet to visit Newmarket. This, I am told, is a large field; where upon certain occasions three or four
<PB N="91" REF="99"/>
horses are brought together, then set a running, and that horse which runs fastest wins the wager.</P>
<P>This is reckoned a very polite and fashionable amusement here, much more followed by the no∣bility than partridge fighting at Java, or paper kites in Madagascar; several of the great here, I am told, understand as much of farriery as their grooms; and a horse, with any share of merit, can never want a patron among the nobility.</P>
<P>We have a description of this entertainment almost every day in some of the gazettes, as for instance: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"On such a day the Give and Take Plate was run for between his Grace's Crab, his Lordship's Periwinkle, and 'Squire Smackem's Slamerkin. All rode their own horses. There was the greatest concourse of nobility that has been known here for several seasons. The odds were in favour of Crab in the beginning, but Slamer∣kin, after the first heat, seemed to have the match hollow; however, it was soon seen, that Periwinkle improved in wind, which, at last, turned out accordingly; Crab was run to a stand still, Slamerkin was knocked up, and Periwinkle was brought in with universal applause."</Q> Thus you see Periwinkle received universal applause, and no doubt his Lordship came in for some share of that praise which was so liberally bestowed upon Periwinkle. Sun of China! how glorious must the Senator appear in his cap and leather breeches, his whip crossed in his mouth, and thus coming to the goal amongst the shouts of grooms, jockies, pimps, stable-bred Dukes, and degraded Generals!</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="100"/>From the description of this princely amusement, now transcribed, and from the great veneration I have for the characters of its principal promoters, I make no doubt but I shall look upon an horse∣race with becoming reverence, predisposed as I am by a similar amusement, of which I have lately been a spectator; for just now I happened to have an opportunity of being present at a Cart-race.</P>
<P>Whether this contention between three carts of different parishes was promoted by a subscription among the nobility, or whether the grand jury, in council assembled, had gloriously combined to en∣courage plaustral merit, I cannot take upon me to determine; but certain it is, the whole was con∣ducted with the utmost regularity and decorum, and the company, which made a brilliant appear∣ance, were universally of opinion, that the sport was high, the running fine, and the riders influ∣enced by no bribe.</P>
<P>It was run on the road from London to a vil∣lage called Brentford, between a turnip cart, a dust cart, and a dung cart; each of the owners condescending to mount and be his own driver. The odds at starting were <HI>dust</HI> against <HI>dung</HI> five to four; but after half a miles going, the knowing ones found themselves all on the wrong side, and it was <HI>turnip</HI> against the field, brass to silver.</P>
<P>Soon however the contest became more doubt∣ful; Turnip indeed kept the way, but it was per∣ceived that Dung had better bottom. The road re-ecchoed with the shouts of the spectators; Dung against Turnip; Turnip against Dung, was now the universal cry; neck and neck; one rode light∣er,
<PB N="93" REF="101"/>
but the other had more judgment. I could not but particularly observe the ardour with which the fair sex espoused the cause of the different rid∣ers on this occasion; one was charmed with the unwashed beauties of Dung; another was captivat∣ed with the patibulary aspect of Turnip: while in the mean time unfortunate gloomy Dust, who came whipping behind, was cheared by the encou∣ragements of some, and pity of all.</P>
<P>The contention now continued for some time, without a possibility of determining to whom vic∣tory designed the prize. The winning post ap∣peared in view, and he who drove the turnip cart assured himself of success; and successful he might have been, had his horse been as ambitious as he; but upon approaching a turn from the road, which led homewards, the horse fairly stood still, and refused to move a foot farther. The dung cart had scarce time to enjoy this temporary triumph, when it was pitched headlong into a ditch by the way side, and the rider left to wallow in congenial mud. Dust in the mean time soon came up, and not being far from the post, came in amidst the shouts and acclamations of all the spectators, and greatly caressed by all the quality of Brentford. Fortune was kind only to one, who ought to have been favourable to all; each had peculiar merit, each laboured hard to earn the prize, and each richly deserved the cart he drove.</P>
<P>I do not know whether this description may not have anticipated that which I intended giving of Newmarket. I am told there is little else to be seen even there. There may be some minute dif∣ferences in the dress of the spectators, but none at
<PB N="94" REF="102"/>
all in their understandings; the quality of Brent∣ford are as remarkable for politeness and delicacy, as the breeders of Newmarket. The quality of Brentford drive their own carts, and the honour∣able fraternity of Newmarket ride their own horses. In short, the matches in one place are as rational as those in the other; and it is more than proba∣ble, that turnips, dust, and dung, are all that can be found to furnish out description in either.</P>
<P>Forgive me, my friend, but a person like me, bred up in a philosophic seclusion, is apt to regard, perhaps with too much asperity, those occurrences which sink man below his station in nature, and diminish the intrinsic value of humanity.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXXIV.</HI> From Fum Hoam to Lien Chi Altangi.</HEAD>
<P>YOU tell me the people of Europe are wise; but where lies their wisdom? You say they are valiant too; yet I have some reasons to doubt of their valour. They are engaged in war among each other, yet apply to the Russians, their neigh∣bours and ours, for assistance. Cultivating such an alliance argues at once imprudence and timidity. All subsidies paid for such an aid is strengthening the Russians, already too powerful, and weakening the employers, already exhausted by intestine com∣motions.</P>
<P>I cannot avoid beholding the Russian empire as the natural enemy of the more western parts of
<PB N="95" REF="103"/>
Europe; as an enemy already possessed of great strength, and, from the nature of the government, every day threatening to become more powerful. This extensive empire, which, both in Europe and Asia, occupies almost a third of the old world, was, about two centuries ago, divided into separate kingdoms and dukedoms, and from such a division consequently feeble. Since the times, however, of Johan Basilides, it has encreased in strength and extent; and those untrodden forests, those innumerable savage animals which formerly covered the face of the country, are now removed, and colonies of mankind planted in their room. A kingdom thus enjoying peace internally, possessed of an unbounded extent of dominion, and learning the military art at the expence of others abroad, must every day grow more powerful; and it is probable, we shall hear Russia, in future times, as formerly, called the Officina Gentium.</P>
<P>It was long the wish of Peter, their great mo∣narch, to have a fort in some of the western parts of Europe; many of his schemes and treaties were directed to this end, but happily for Europe he failed in them all. A fort in the power of this people would be like the possession of a flood-gate; and whenever ambition, interest, or necessity prompt∣ed, they might then be able to deluge the whole western world with a barbarous inundation.</P>
<P>Believe me, my friend, I cannot sufficiently con∣temn the politics of Europe, who thus make this powerful people arbitrators in their quarrel. The Russians are now at that period between re∣finement and barbarity, which seems most adapted to military atchievement; and if once they happen
<PB N="96" REF="104"/>
to get footing in the western parts of Europe, it is not the feeble efforts of the sons of effeminacy and dissention, that can serve to remove them. The fertile valley and soft climate will ever be suf∣ficient inducements to draw whole myriads from their native desarts, the trackless wild, or snowy mountain.</P>
<P>History, experience, reason, nature, expand the book of wisdom before the eyes of mankind, but they will not read. We have seen with terror a winged phalanx of famished locusts each singly contemptible, but from multitude become hideous, cover, like clouds, the face of day, and threaten the whole world with ruin. We have seen them settling on the fertile plains of India and Egypt, destroying in an instant the labours and the hopes of nations; sparing neither the fruit of the earth nor the verdure of the fields, and changing into a frightful desert landscapes of once luxuriant beau∣ty. We have seen myriads of ants issuing together from the southern desert, like a torrent whose source was inexhaustible, succeeding each other without end, and renewing their destroyed forces, with unwearied perseverance, bringing desola∣tion wherever they came, banishing men and ani∣mals, and, when destitute of all subsistence, in heaps infecting the wilderness which they had made! Like these have been the migrations of men. When as yet savage, and almost resembling their brute partners in the forest, subject like them only to the instincts of nature, and directed by hunger alone in the choice of an abode, how have we seen whole armies starting wild at once from their forests and their dens; Goths, Huns, Van∣dals, Saracens, Turks, Tartars, myriads of men,
<PB N="97" REF="105"/>
animals in human form, without country, without name, without laws, out-powering by numbers all opposition, ravaging cities, overturning empires. and, after having destroyed whole nations, and spread extensive desolation, how have we seen them sink oppressed by some new enemy, more barba∣rous and even more unknown than they!</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXXV.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, first president of the Ceremonial Academy, at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>AS the instruction of the fair sex in this country is entirely committed to the care of foreigners, as their language-masters, music-masters, hair-friz∣zers, and governesses, are all from abroad, I had some intentions of opening a female academy my∣self, and made no doubt, as I was quite a foreign∣er, of meeting a favourable reception.</P>
<P>In this I intended to instruct the ladies in all the conjugal mysteries; wives should be taught the art of managing husbands, and maids the skill of pro∣perly chusing them; I would teach a wife how far she might venture to be sick without giving disgust, she should be acquainted with the great benefits of the cholic in the stomach, and all the thorough-bred insolence of fashion; maids should learn the secret of nicely distinguishing every com∣petitor; they should be able to know the differ∣ence between a pedant and a scholar, a citizen and a prig, a squire and his horse, a beau and his
<PB N="98" REF="106"/>
monkey; but chiefly they should be taught the art of managing their smiles, from the contemptuous simper to the long laborious laugh.</P>
<P>But I have discontinued the project; for what would signify teaching ladies the manner of go∣verning or chusing husbands, when marriage is at present so much out of fashion, that a lady is very well off, who can get any husband at all. Celi∣bacy now prevails in every rank of life, the streets are crouded with old bachelors, and the houses with ladies who have refused good offers, and are never likely to receive any for the future.</P>
<P>The only advice, therefore, I could give the fair sex, as things stand at present, is to get husbands as fast as they can. There is certainly nothing in the whole creation, not even Babylon in ruins, more truly deplorable than a lady in the virgin bloom of sixty-three, or a battered unmarried beau, who squibs about from place to place, shewing his pig-tail wig and his ears. The one appears to my imagination in the form of a double night∣cap, or a roll of pomatum, the other in the shape of an electuary, or a box of pills.</P>
<P>I would once more therefore advise the ladies to get husbands. I would desire them not to discard an old lover without very sufficient reasons, nor treat the new with ill-nature till they know him false; let not prudes alledge the falseness of the sex, coquets the pleasures of long courtship, or parents, the necessary preliminaries of penny for penny. I have reasons that would silence even a casuist in this particular. In the first place, therefore, I divide the subject into fifteen heads,
<PB N="99" REF="107"/>
and then <HI>sic argumentor</HI>—but not to give you and myself the spleen, be contented at present with an Indian tale.</P>
<P>In a winding of the river Amidar, just before it falls into the Caspian sea, there lies an island un∣frequented by the inhabitants of the Continent. In this seclusion, blest with all that wild unculti∣vated nature could bestow, lived a princess and her two daughters. She had been wrecked upon the coast while her children as yet were infants, who of consequence, though grown up, were entirely unacquainted with man. Yet, unexperienced as the young ladies were in the opposite sex, both early discovered symptoms, the one of prudery, the other of being a coquet. The eldest was ever learning maxims of wisdom and discretion from her mamma, while the youngest employed all her hours in gazing at her own face in a neighbouring fountain.</P>
<P>Their usual amusement in this solitude was fish∣ing: Their mother had taught them all the secrets of the art; she shewed them which were the most likely places to throw out the line, what baits were most proper for the various seasons, and the best manner to draw up the finny prey, when they had hooked it. In this manner they spent their time, easy and innocent, till one day, the Princess being indisposed, desired them to go and catch her a sturgeon or a shark for supper, which she fancied might sit easy on her stomach. The daugh∣ters obeyed, and clapping on a gold fish, the usual bait, on those occasions, went and sat upon one of the rocks, letting the gilded hook glide down with the stream.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="108"/>On the opposite shore, farther down, at the mouth of the river, lived a diver for pearls; a youth, who, by long habit in his trade, was al∣most grown amphibious; so that he could remain whole hours at the bottom of the water, without ever fetching breath. He happened to be at that very instant diving when the ladies were fishing with the gilded hook. Seeing therefore the bait, which to him had the appearance of real gold, he was resolved to seize the prize, but both his hands being already filled with pearl oysters, he found himself obliged to snap at it with his mouth: The consequence is easily imagined; the hook, before unperceived, was instantly fastened in his jaw, nor could he, with all his efforts, or his floundering, get free.</P>
<P>"Sister, cries the youngest Princess, I have cer∣tainly caught a monstrous fish; I never perceived any thing struggle so at the end of my line before; come, and help me to draw it in." They both now therefore assisted in fishing up the Diver on shore; but nothing could equal their surprize upon seeing him. "Bless my eyes, cries the prude, what have we got here; this is a very odd fish to be sure; I never saw any thing in my life look so queer; what eyes, what terrible claws, what a monstrous snout; I have read of this monster somewhere before, it certainly must be a <HI>Tanlang</HI> that eats women; let us throw it back into the sea where we found it.</P>
<P>The Diver in the mean time stood upon the beach, at the end of the line, with the hook in his mouth, using every art that he thought could best excite pity, and particularly looking extremely ten∣der, which is usual in such circumstances. The
<PB N="101" REF="109"/>
coquet therefore, in some measure influenced by the innocence of his looks, ventured to contradict her companion. "Upon my word, sister, says she, I see nothing in the animal so very terrible as you are pleased to apprehend; I think it may serve well enough for a change. Always sharks, and sturgeons, and lobsters, and crawfish, make me quite sick. I fancy a slice of this nicely grilladed, and dressed up with shrimp sauce, would be very pretty eating. I fancy mamma would like a bit with pickles above all things in the world; and if it should not sit easy on her stomach, it will be time enough to discontinue it when found disagreeable, you know." "Horrid, cries the prude, would the girl be poisoned; I tell you it is a <HI>Tanlang</HI>; I have read of it in twenty places. It is every where de∣scribed as the most pernicious animal that ever in∣fested the ocean. I am certain it is the most insidi∣ous, ravenous creature in the world; and is certain destruction if taken internally." The youngest sister was now therefore obliged to submit: both assisted in drawing the hook with some violence from the Diver's jaw; and he finding himself at liberty, bent his breast against the broad wave and disap∣peared in an instant.</P>
<P>Just at this juncture the mother came down to the beach, to know the cause of her daughter's delay; they told her every circumstance, describ∣ing the monster they had caught. The old lady was one of the most discreet women in the world; she was called the black-eyed Princess, from two black eyes she had received in her youth, being a little addicted to boxing in her liquor. "Alas, my children, cries she, what have you done? the fish you caught was a man-fish; one of the most
<PB N="102" REF="110"/>
tame domestic animals in the world. We could have let him run and play about the garden, and he would have been twenty times more entertain∣ing than our squirrel or monkey. If that be all, says the young coquet, we will fish for him again. If that be all, I'll hold three tooth-picks to one pound of snuff, I catch him whenever I please." Accordingly they threw in their line once more, but, with all their gilding, and padling, and assiduity, they could never after catch the Diver. In this state of solitude and disappointment they continued for many years, still fishing, but without success; till, at last, the genius of the place, in pity to their distresses, changed the prude into a shrimp, and the coquet into an oyster.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXXVI.</HI> From the same.</HEAD>
<P>I AM amused, my dear Fum, with the labours of some of the learned here. One shall write you a whole folio on the direction of a caterpillar. Another shall swell his works with a description of the plumage on the wing of a butterfly; a third shall see a little world on a peach leaf, and publish a book to describe what his readers might see more clearly in two minutes, only by being fur∣nished with eyes and a microscope.</P>
<P>I have frequently compared the understandings of such men to their own glasses. Their field of vision is too contracted to take in the whole of any
<PB N="103" REF="111"/>
but minute objects; they view all nature bit by bit; now the proboscis, now the antennae, now the pinnae of—a flea. Now the polypus comes to breakfast upon a worm; now it is kept up to see how long it will live without eating; now it is turned inside outward; and now it sickens and dies. Thus they proceed, laborious in trifles, constant in experiment, without one single abstrac∣tion, by which alone knowledge may be properly said to encrease; till, at last, their ideas, ever em∣ployed upon minute things, contract to the size of the diminutive object, and a single mite shall fill their whole mind's capacity.</P>
<P>Yet believe me, my friend, ridiculous as these men are to the world, they are set up as objects of esteem for each other. They have particular places appointed for their meetings; in which one shews his cockle-shell, and is praised by all the so∣ciety; another produces his powder, makes some experiments that result in nothing, and comes off with admiration and applause; a third comes out with the important discovery of some new process in the skeleton of a mole, and is set down as the accurate and sensible; while one still more fortu∣nate than the rest, by pickling, potting, and pre∣serving monsters, rises into unbounded reputation.</P>
<P>The labours of such men, instead of being cal∣culated to amuse the public, are laid out only in diverting each other. The world becomes very little the better or the wiser, for knowing what is the peculiar food of an insect that is itself the food of another, which in its turn is eaten by a third; but there are men who have studied themselves into an habit of investigating and admiring such minutiae. To these such subjects are pleasing, as
<PB N="104" REF="112"/>
there are some who contentedly spend whole days in endeavouring to solve aenigmas, or disentangle the puzzling sticks of children.</P>
<P>But of all the learned, those who pretend to in∣vestigate remote antiquity, have least to plead in their own defence, when they carry this passion to a faulty excess. They are generally found to sup∣ply by conjecture the want of record, and then by perseverance are wrought up into a confidence of the truth of opinions, which even to themselves at first appeared founded only in imagination.</P>
<P>The Europeans have heard much of the king∣dom of China: its politeness, arts, commerce, laws, and morals, are, however, but very imper∣fectly known among them. They have even now in their Indian warehouse numberless utensils, plants, minerals, and machines, of the use of which they are intirely ignorant; nor can any among them even make a probable guess for what they might have been designed. Yet though this people be so ignorant of the present real state of China, the philosophers I am describ∣ing have entered into long, learned, laborious dis∣putes about what China was two thousand years ago. China and European happiness are but little connected even at this day; but European happi∣ness and China two thousand years ago have cer∣tainly no connection at all. However, the learn∣ed have written on and pursued the subject thro' all the labyrinths of antiquity; though the early dews and the tainted gale be passed away, though no footsteps remain to direct the doubtful chace, yet still they run forward, open upon the uncertain scent, and though in fact they follow nothing, are earnest in the pursuit. In this chace however they
<PB N="105" REF="113"/>
all take different ways. One, for example, confi∣dently assures us, that China was peopled by a co∣lony from Egypt. Sesostris, he observes, led his army as far as the Ganges; therefore, if he went so far, he might still have gone as far as China, which is but about a thousand miles from thence; therefore he did go to China; therefore China was not peopled before he went there; therefore it was peopled by him. Besides, the Egyptians have py∣ramids; the Chinese have in like manner their por∣celaine tower; the Egyptians used to light up can∣dles upon every rejoicing, the Chinese have lant∣horns upon the same occasion; the Egyptians had their great river, so have the Chinese; but what serves to put the matter past a doubt is, that the antient Kings of China and those of Egypt were called by the same names. The Emperor Ki is certainly the same with King Atoes; for, if we only change <HI>K</HI> into <HI>A,</HI> and <HI>i</HI> into <HI>toes,</HI> we shall have the name Atoes; and with equal ease <HI>Menes</HI> may be proved to be the same with the Emperor <HI>Yu</HI>; therefore the Chinese are a colony from Egypt.</P>
<P>But another of the learned is entirely different from the last; and he will have the Chinese to be a colony planted by Noah just after the deluge. First, from the vast similitude there is between the name of Fohi, the founder of the Chinese monarchy, and that of Noah, the preserver of the human race: Noah, Fohi, very like each other truly; they have each but four letters, and only two of the four happen to differ. But to strengthen the argu∣ment, Fohi, as the Chinese chronicle asserts, had no father. Noah, it is true, had a father, as the European Bible tells us; but then, as this father was probably drowned in the flood, it is just the
<PB N="106" REF="114"/>
same as if he had no father at all; therefore Noah and Fohi are the same, Just after the flood, the earth was covered with mud; if it was covered with mud, it must have been incrustated mud; if it was incrustated, it was cloathed with ver∣dure; this was a fine, unembarrassed road for Noah to fly from his wicked children; he there∣fore did fly from them, and took a journey of two thousand miles for his own amusement; therefore Noah and Fohi are the same.</P>
<P>Another sect of literati, for they all pass among the vulgar for very great scholars, assert, that the Chinese came neither from the colony of Se∣sostris, nor from Noah, but are descended from Magog, Meshec and Tubal, and therefore neither Sesostris, nor Noah, nor Fohi are the same.</P>
<P>It is thus, my friend, that indolence assumes the airs of wisdom, and while it tosses the cup and ball with infantine folly, desires the world to look on, and calls the stupid pastime, philoso∣phy and learning. Adieu.</P>

A general here, who would have faced a culverin when well, if the fit be on him, shall hardly find courage to snuff a candle. An ad∣miral, who could have opposed a broadside with∣out shrinking, shall sit whole days in his cham∣ber, mobbed up in double night-caps, shuddering at the intrusive breeze, and distinguishable from his wife only by his black beard and heavy eye∣brows.</P>
<P>In the country this disorder mostly attacks the fair sex, in town it is most unfavourable to the men. A lady, who has pined whole years amidst cooing doves, and complaining nightingales in rural re∣tirement, shall resume all her vivacity in one night at a city gaming-table; her husband who roar'd, hunted, and got drunk at home, shall grow splenetic in town in proportion to his wife's good humour. Upon their arrival in London, they exchange their disorders. In consequence of her parties and excursions, he puts on the furred cap and scarlet stomacher, and perfectly resembles an Indian husband, who when his wife is safely delivered, permits her to transact business abroad, while he undergoes all the formality of keeping his bed, and receiving all the condolence in her place.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="116"/>But those who reside constantly in town, owe this disorder mostly to the influence of the wea∣ther. It is impossible to describe what a variety of transmutations an east wind shall produce; it has been known to change a Lady of fashion into a parlour couch; an Alderman into a plate of cus∣tards, and a dispenser of justice into a rat trap. Even Philosophers themselves are not exempt from its influence; it has often converted a Poet into a coral and bells, and a patriot Senator into a dumb waiter.</P>
<P>Some days ago I went to visit the man in black, and entered his house with that chearfulness, which the certainty of a favourable reception al∣ways inspires. Upon opening the door of his apartment, I found him with the most rueful face imaginable in a morning gown and flannel night∣cap, earnestly employed in learning to blow the German flute. Struck with the absurdity of a man in the decline of life, thus blowing away all his constitution and spirits, even without the con∣solation of being musical; I ventured to ask what could induce him to attempt learning so difficult an instrument so late in life. To this he made no reply, but groaning, and still holding the flute to his lip, continued to gaze at me for some mo∣ments very angrily, and then proceeded to prac∣tise his gammut as before. After having produced a variety of the most hideous tones in nature; at last turning to me, he demanded, whether I did not think he had made a surprizing progress in two days? You see, continues he, I have got the Ambusheer already, and as for fingering, my master tells me, I shall have that in a few lessons more. I was so much astonished with this instance of inverted ambition, that I know not what to re∣ply,
<PB N="109" REF="117"/>
but soon discerned the cause of all his ab∣surdities; my friend was under a metamorphosis by the power of spleen, and flute-blowing was unluckily become his adventitious passion.</P>
<P>In order therefore to banish his anxiety imper∣ceptibly, by seeming to indulge it, I began to des∣cant on those gloomy topics by which Philosophers often get rid of their own spleen, by communi∣cating it; the wretchedness of a man in this life, the happiness of some wrought out of the miseries of others, the necessity that wretches should ex∣pire under punishment, that rogues might enjoy affluence in tranquility; I led him on from the inhumanity of the rich to the ingratitude of the beggar; from the insincerity of refinement to the fierceness of rusticity; and at last had the good fortune to restore him to his usual serenity of temper, by permitting him to expatiate upon all the modes of human misery.</P>
<P>'Some nights ago, says my friend, sitting alone by my fire, I happened to look into an account of the detection of a set of men called the thief-takers. I read over the many hideous cruelties of those haters of mankind, of their pretended friendship to wretches they meant to betray, of their sending men out to rob and then hanging them. I could not avoid sometimes interrupting the nar∣rative by crying out, <HI>Yet these are men!</HI> As I went on, I was informed that they had lived by this prac∣tice several years, and had been enriched by the price of blood, <HI>and yet,</HI> cried I, <HI>I have been sent into this world, and am desired to call these men my bro∣th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs!</HI> I read that the very man who led the con∣demned wretch to the gallows, was he who falsely swore his life away; <HI>and yet,</HI> continued I, <HI>that perjurer
had
<PB N="110" REF="118"/>
just such a nose, such lips, such hands and such eyes as Newton.</HI> I at last came to the account of the wretch that was searched after robbing one of the thief-takers of half a crown. Those of the confederacy knew that he had got but that single half crown in the world; after a long search therefore, which they knew would be fruitless, and taking from him the half crown, which they knew was all he had, one of the gang compas∣sionately cried out, <HI>Alas, poor a creature let him keep all the rest he has got, it will do him service in Newgate, where we are sending him.</HI> This was an instance of such complicated guilt and hypo∣crisy, that I threw down the book in an agony of rage, and began to think with malice of all the hu∣man kind. I sat silent for some minutes, and soon perceiving the ticking of my watch begin∣ning to grow noisy and troublesome, I quickly placed it out of hearing, and strove to resume my serenity. But the watch-man soon gave me a second alarm. I had scarcely recovered from this, when my peace was assaulted by the wind at my window; and when that ceased to blow, I listened for death-watches in the wainscot. I now found my whole system discomposed, I strove to find a resource in philosophy and reason; but what could I oppose, or where direct my blow, when I could see no enemy to combat. I saw no misery approaching, nor knew any I had to fear, yet still I was miserable. Morning came, I sought for tranquility in dissipation, sauntered from one place of public resort to another, but found my∣self disagreeable to my acquaintance, and ridi∣culous to others. I tried at different times dan∣cing, fencing, and riding, I solved geometrical problems, shaped tobacco-stoppers, wrote verses and cut paper. At last I placed my affections
<PB N="111" REF="119"/>
on music, and find, that earnest employment if cannot cure, at least will palliate every anxiety.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXXVIII.</HI> From the same.</HEAD>
<P>IT is no unpleasing contemplation to consider the influence which soil and climate have upon the disposition of the inhabitants, the animals and vegetables of different countries. That among the brute creation is much more visible than in man, and that in vegetables more than either. In some places those plants which are entirely poison∣ous at home lose their deleterious quality by be∣ing carried abroad; there are serpents in Ma∣cedonia so harmless as to be used as play-things for children, and we are told that in some parts of Fez there are lions so very timorous as to be scared away, though coming in herds, by the cries of women.</P>
<P>I know of no country where the influence of cli∣mate and soil is more visible than in England; the same hidden cause which gives courage to their dogs and cocks, gives also fierceness to their men. But chiefly this ferocity appears among the vul∣gar. The polite of every country pretty nearly resemble each other. But as in simpleing, it is among the uncultivated productions of nature, we are to examine the characteristic differences of climate and soil, so in an estimate of the genius of the people, we must look among the sons of unpolished rusticity. The vulgar English there∣fore may be easily distinguished from all the rest
<PB N="112" REF="120"/>
of the world, by superior pride, impatience, and a peculiar hardiness of soul.</P>
<P>Perhaps no qualities in the world are more sus∣ceptible of a fine polish than these; artificial com∣plaisance and easy deference being superinduced over these, generally forms a great character; some∣thing at once elegant and majestic, affable yet sin∣cere. Such in general are the better sort; but they who are left in primitive rudeness are the least disposed for society with others, or comfort inter∣nally, of any people under the sun.</P>
<P>The poor indeed of every country are but little prone to treat each other with tenderness; their own miseries are too apt to engross all their pity; and perhaps too they give but little commiseration, as they find but little from others. But, in Eng∣land, the poor treat each other upon every occasion with more than savage animosity, and as if they were in a state of open war by nature. In China, if two porters should meet in a narrow street, they would lay down their burthens, make a thousand excuses to each other for the accidental interrup∣tion, and beg pardon on their knees; if two men of the same occupation should meet here, they would first begin to scold, and at last to beat each other. One would think they had miseries enough resulting from penury and labour not to encrease them by ill-nature among themselves, and subjec∣tion to new penalties, but such considerations never weigh with them.</P>
<P>But to recompence this strange absurdity they are in the main generous, brave, and enterprising. They feel the slightest injuries with a degree of ungoverned impatience, but resist the greatest ca∣lamities with surprizing fortitude. Those miseries
<PB N="113" REF="121"/>
under which any other people in the world would sink, they have often shewed they were capable of enduring; if accidentally cast upon some desolate coast, their perseverance is beyond what any other nation is capable of sustaining; if imprisoned for crimes, their efforts to escape are greater than among others. The peculiar strength of their prisons, when compared to those elsewhere, argues their hardiness; even the strongest prisons I have ever seen in other countries would be very insufficient to confine the untameable spirit of an Englishman. In short, what man dares do in circumstances of danger, an Englishman will. His virtues seem to sleep in the calm, and are called out only to com∣bat the kindred storm.</P>
<P>But the greatest eulogy of this people is the generosity of their miscreants; the tenderness in general of their robbers and highwaymen. Per∣haps no people can produce instances of the same kind, where the desperate mix pity with injus∣tice; still shew that they understand a distinction in crimes, and even, in acts of violence, have still some tincture of remaining virtue. In every other country robbery and murder go almost always to∣gether; here it seldom happens, except upon ill-judged resistance or pursuit. The banditti of other countries are unmerciful to a supreme de∣gree; the highwayman and robber here are gene∣rous at least to the public, and pretend even to virtues in their intercourse among each other. Taking therefore my opinion of the English from the virtues and vices practised among the vulgar, they at once present to a stranger all their faults, and keep their virtues up only for the enquiring eye of a philosopher.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="122"/>Foreigners are generally shocked at their inso∣lence upon first coming among them; they find themselves ridiculed and insulted in every street; they meet with none of those trifling civilities, so frequent elsewhere, which are instances of mutual good-will without previous acquaintance; they travel through the country either too ignorant or too obstinate to cultivate a closer acquaintance, meet every moment something to excite their dis∣gust, and return home to characterise this as the region of spleen, insolence, and ill-nature. In short, England would be the last place in the world I would travel to by way of amusement; but the first for instruction. I would chuse to have others for my acquaintance, but Englishmen for my friends.</P>

<P>THE mind is ever ingenious in making its own distress. The wandering beggar, who has none to protect, to feed, or to shelter him, fan∣cies complete happiness in labour and a full meal; take him from rags and want, feed, cloath, and employ him, his wishes now rise one step above his station; he could be happy were he possessed of raiment, food, and ease. Suppose his wishes gratified even in these, his prospects widen as he ascends; he finds himself in affluence and tranquil∣lity indeed, but indolence soon breeds anxiety, and he desires not only to be freed from pain, but to be possessed of pleasure; pleasure is granted him, and this but opens his soul to ambition, and
<PB N="115" REF="123"/>
ambition will be sure to taint his future happiness, either with jealousy, disappointment, or fatigue.</P>
<P>But of all the arts of distress found out by man for his own torment, perhaps, that of philosophic misery is most truly ridiculous, a passion no where carried to so extravagant an excess as in the coun∣try where I now reside. It is not enough to en∣gage all the compassion of a philosopher here, that his own globe is harassed with wars, pestilence, or barbarity, he shall grieve for the inhabitants of the moon, if the situation of her imaginary moun∣tains happens to alter; and dread the extinction of the sun, if the spots on his surface happen to en∣crease: one should imagine, that philosophy was introduced to make men happy; but here it serves to make hundreds miserable.</P>
<P>My landlady some days ago brought me the di∣ary of a philosopher of this desponding sort, who had lodged in the apartment before me. It con∣tains the history of a life, which seems to be one continued tissue of sorrow, apprehension, and dis∣tress. A single week will serve as a specimen of the whole.</P>
<P><HI>Monday.</HI> In what a transient decaying situation are we placed, and what various reasons does phi∣losophy furnish to make mankind unhappy A sin∣gle grain of mustard shall continue to produce its similitude through numberless successions; yet what has been granted to this little seed has been denied to our planetary system; the mus∣tard-seed is still unaltered, but the system is grow∣ing old, and must quickly fall to decay. How terrible will it be, when the motions of all the
<PB N="116" REF="124"/>
planets have at last become so irregular as to need repairing, when the moon shall fall into frightful paroxysms of alteration, when the earth, deviating from its ancient track, and with every other pla∣net forgetting its circular revolutions, shall be∣come so eccentric, that unconfined by the laws of system, it shall fly off into boundless space, to knock against some distant world, or fall in upon the sun, either extinguishing his light, or burned up by his flames in a moment. Perhaps while I write, this dreadful change is begun. Shield me from universal ruin! Yet ideot man laughs, sings, and rejoices in the very face of the sun, and seems no way touched with his situation.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday.</HI> Went to bed in great distress, awaked and was comforted, by considering that this change was to happen at some indefinite time, and therefore, like death, the thoughts of it might easily be borne. But there is a revolution, a fixed determined revolution, which must cer∣tainly come to pass; yet which, by good fortune, I shall never feel, except in my posterity. The obliquity of the equator with the ecliptic is now twenty minutes less than when it was observed two thousand years ago by <HI>Piteas.</HI> If this be the case, in six thousand the obliquity will be still less by an whole degree. This being supposed, it is evident, that our earth, as Louville has clearly proved, has a motion, by which the climates must necessarily change place, and, in the space of about one mil∣lion of years, England shall actually travel to the Antarctic pole. I shudder at the change! How shall our unhappy grandchildren endure the hide∣ous climate! A million of years will soon be ac∣complished; they are but a moment when com∣pared
<PB N="117" REF="125"/>
to eternity; then shall our charming coun∣try, as I may say, in a moment of time, resemble the hideous wilderness of Nova Zembla.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday.</HI> To night, by my calculation, the long predicted comet is to make its first appear∣ance. Heavens, what terrors are impending over our little dim speck of earth! Dreadful visitation! Are we to be scorched in its fires, or only smo∣thered in the vapour of its tail? That is the ques∣tion! Thoughtless mortals, go build houses, plant orchards, purchase estates, for to-morrow you die. But what if the comet should not come? That would be equally fatal. Comets are servants which periodically return to supply the sun with fuel. If our sun therefore should be disappointed of the expected supply, and all his fuel be in the mean time burnt out, he must expire like an exhausted taper. What a miserable situation must our earth be in without his enlivening ray? Have we not seen several neighbouring suns entirely disappear? Has not a fixed star, near the tail of the Ram, late∣ly been quite extinguished?</P>
<P><HI>Thursday.</HI> The comet has not yet appeared; I am sorry for it: first, sorry because my calcula∣tion is false; secondly, sorry lest the sun should want fuel; thirdly, sorry lest the wits should laugh at our erroneous predictions; and fourthly, sorry because if it appears to night, it must necessarily come within the sphere of the earth's attraction; and heaven help the unhappy country on which it happens to fall.</P>
<P><HI>Friday.</HI> Our whole society have been out all eager in search of the comet. We have seen not less
<PB N="118" REF="126"/>
than sixteen comets in different parts of the heavens. However, we are unanimously resolved to fix upon one only to be the comet expected. That near Virgo wants nothing but a tail to fit it out com∣pletely for terrestrial admiration.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday.</HI> The moon is I find at her old pranks. Her appulses, librations, and other irregularities, indeed amaze me. My daughter too is this morn∣ing gone off with a grenadier. No way surpriz∣ing. I was never able to give her a relish for wis∣dom. She ever promised to be a mere expletive in the creation. But the moon, the moon gives me real uneasiness; I fondly fancied I had fixed her. I had thought her constant, and constant only to me; but every night discovers her infidelity, and proves me a desolate and abandoned lover.</P>

<P>IT is surprizing what an influence titles shall have upon the mind, even though these titles be of our own making. Like children we dress up the puppets in finery, and then stand in astonish∣ment at the plastic wonder. I have been told of a rat catcher here, who strolled for a long time about the villages near town, without finding any employment; at last, however, he thought proper to take the title of his Majesty's Rat catcher in or∣dinary, and this succeeded beyond his expecta∣tions; when it was known that he caught rats at
<PB N="119" REF="127"/>
court, all were ready to give him countenance and employment.</P>
<P>But of all the people, they who make books seem most perfectly sensible of the advantage of ti∣tular dignity. All seem convinced, that a book written by vulgar hands, can neither instruct nor improve; none but Kings, Chams, and Manda∣rines, can write with any probability of success. If the titles inform me right, not only Kings and Courtiers, but Emperors themselves in this coun∣try, periodically supply the press.</P>
<P>A man here who should write, and honestly confess that he wrote for bread, might as well send his manuscript to fire the baker's oven; not one creature will read him; all must be court-bred poets, or pretend at least to be court-bred, who can expect to please. Should the caitiff fairly avow a design of emptying our pockets and filling his own, every reader would instantly forsake him; even those, who write for bread themselves, would combine to worry him, perfectly sensible, that his attempts only served to take the bread out of their mouths.</P>
<P>And yet this silly prepossession the more amazes me, when I consider, that almost all the excellent productions in wit that have appeared here, were purely the offspring of necessity; their Drydens, Butlers, Otways, and Farquhars, were all writers for bread. Believe me, my friend, hunger has a most amazing faculty of sharpening the genius; and he who with a full belly, can think like a hero, after a course of fasting, shall rise to the sublimity of a demi-god.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="128"/>But what will most amaze, is, that this very set of men, who are now so much depreciated by fools, are however the very best writers they have among them at present. For my own part, were I to buy an hat, I would not have it from a stock∣ing-maker, but an hatter; were I to buy shoes, I should not go to the taylor's for that purpose. It is just so with regard to wit: did I, for my life, desire to be well served, I would apply only to those who made it their trade, and lived by it. You smile at the oddity of my opinion; but be as∣sured, my friend, that wit is in some measure me∣chanical: and that a man long habituated to catch at even its resemblance, will at last be happy enough to possess the substance: by a long habit of writing he acquires a justness of thinking, and a mastery of manner, which holiday-writers, even with ten times his genius, may vainly attempt to equal.</P>
<P>How then are they deceived, who expect from title, dignity, and exterior circumstance, an excel∣lence, which is in some measure acquired by habit, and sharpened by necessity; you have seen, like me, many literary reputations promoted by the influ∣ence of fashion, which have scarce survived the possessor; you have seen the poor hardly earn the little reputation they acquired, and their merit only acknowledged when they were incapable of enjoying the pleasures of popularity; such, how∣ever, is the reputation worth possessing, that which is hardly earned is hardly lost.</P>

<P>WHERE will my disappointments end? Must I still be doomed to accuse the severity of my fortune, and shew my constancy in distress ra∣ther than moderation in prosperity? I had at least hopes of conveying my charming companion safe from the reach of every enemy, and of again re∣storing her to her native soil. But those hopes are now no more.</P>
<P>Upon leaving Terki, we took the nearest road to the dominions of Russia. We passed the Ural mountains covered in eternal snow, and traversed the forests of Ufa, where the prowling bear and shrieking hyena keep an undisputed possession. We next embarked upon the rapid river Bulija, and made the best of our way to the banks of the Wolga, where it waters the fruitful valleys of Ca∣san.</P>
<P>There were two vessels in company properly equipped and armed in order to oppose the Wolga pyrates, who we were informed infested this river. Of all mankind these pyrates are the most terrible. They are composed of the criminals and outlawed peasants of Russia, who fly to the forests that lie along the banks of the Wolga for protection. Here they join in parties, lead a savage life, and have no other subsistence but plunder. Being deprived of houses, friends, or a fixed habitation, they be∣come more terrible even than the tyger, and as in∣sensible
<PB N="122" REF="130"/>
to all the feelings of humanity. They nei∣ther give quarter to those they conquer, nor re∣ceive it when overpowered themselves. The seve∣rity of the laws against them serve to encrease their barbarity, and seem to make them a neutral species of beings between the wildness of the lion and the subtilty of the man. When taken alive their punishment is hideous. A floating gibbet is erected, which is let run down with the stream; here upon an iron hook stuck under their ribs, and upon which the whole weight of their body de∣pends, they are left to expire in the most terrible agonies; some being thus found to linger several days successively.</P>
<P>We were but three days voyage from the con∣fluence of this river into the Wolga, when we perceived at a distance behind us an armed barque coming up with the assistance of sails and oars, in order to attack us. The dreadful signal of death was hung upon the mast, and our captain with his glass could easily discern them to be pyrates. It is impossible to express our consternation on this occasion; the whole crew instantly came together to consult the properest means of safety. It was therefore soon determined to send off our women and valuable commodities in one of our vessels, and that the men should stay in the other and boldly oppose the enemy. This resolution was soon put into execution, and I now reluctantly parted from the beautiful Zelis for the first time since our retreat from Persia. The vessel in which she was disappeared to my longing eyes, in pro∣portion as that of the pyrates approached us. They soon came up; but, upon examining our strength, and perhaps sensible of the manner in which we
<PB N="123" REF="131"/>
had sent off our most valuable effects, they seemed more eager to pursue the vessel we had sent away than attack us. In this manner they continued to harrass us for three days; still endeavouring to pass us without fighting. But, on the fourth day, finding it entirely impossible, and despairing to seize the expected booty, they desisted from their endeavours, and left us to pursue our voyage with∣out interruption.</P>
<P>Our joy on this occasion was great; but soon a disappointment more terrible, because unexpected, succeeded. The barque, in which our women and treasure were sent off, was wrecked upon the banks of the Wolga, for want of a proper number of hands to manage her, and the whole crew carried by the peasants up the country. Of this however we were not sensible till our arrival at Moscow; where expecting to meet our separated barque, we were informed of its misfortune, and our loss. Need I paint the situation of my mind on this occasion? Need I describe all I feel, when I despair of beholding the beautiful Zelis more! Fancy had dressed the future prospect of my life in the gayest colouring; but one unex∣pected stroke of fortune has robbed it of every charm. Her dear idea mixes with every scene of pleasure, and without her presence to enliven it, the whole becomes tedious, insipid, insupportable. I will confess, now that she is lost, I will confess, I loved her; nor is it in the power of time, or of reason, to erase her image from my heart.</P>

<P>YOUR misfortunes are mine. But as every period of life is marked with its own, you must learn to endure them. Disappointed love makes the misery of youth; disappointed ambition, that of manhood; and successless avarice, that of age. These three attack us through life; and it is our duty to stand upon our guard. To love, we ought to oppose dissipation, and endeavour to change the object of the affections; to ambition, the happi∣ness of indolence and obscurity; and to avarice, the fear of soon dying. These are the shields with which we should arm ourselves; and thus make every scene of life, if not pleasing, at least sup∣portable.</P>
<P>Men complain of not finding a place of repose. They are in the wrong; they have it for seeking. What they should indeed complain of is, that the heart is an enemy to that very repose they seek. To themselves alone should they impute their dis∣content. They seek within the short span of life to satisfy a thousand desires; each of which alone is unsatiable. One month passes and another comes on; the year ends and then begins; but man is still unchanging in folly, still blindly continuing in prejudice. To the wise man, every climate and every soil is pleasing; to him a parterre of flowers is the famous valley of gold; to him, a little brook,

<P>The life of man is a journey; a journey that must be travelled, however bad the roads or the accommodation. If, in the beginning, it is found dangerous, narrow, and difficult, it must either grow better in the end, or we shall by custom learn to bear its inequality.</P>
<P>But though I see you incapable of penetrating into grand principles, attend at least to a simile adapted to every apprehension. I am mounted upon a wretched ass. I see another man before me upon a sprightly horse, at which I find some uneasiness I look behind me and see numbers on foot stooping under heavy burdens; let me learn to pity their estate, and thank heaven for my own.</P>

The company were surprised to see the old man so merry when suffering such great losses, and the Mandarine himself coming out, asked him how

he, who had grieved so much, and given way to the calamity the day before, could now be so chearful? "You ask me one question, cries the old man, let me answer by asking another: Which is the most durable, a hard thing, or a soft thing; that which resists, or that which makes no resist∣ance?" <HI>An hard thing to be sure,</HI> replied the Manda∣rine.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XCIII.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, first presi∣dent of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>THE manner of grieving for our departed friends in China is very different from that of Europe. The mourning colour of Europe is black; that of China white. When a parent or relation dies here, for they seldom mourn for friends, it is only clap∣ping on a suit of sables, grimacing it for a few days, and all, soon forgotten, goes on as before; not a single creature missing the deceased, except perhaps a favourite house-keeper or a favourite cat.</P>
<P>On the contrary, with us in China it is a very serious affair. The piety with which I have seen you behave on one of these occasions should never be forgotten. I remember it was upon the death of thy grandmother's maiden sister. The coffin was
<PB N="127" REF="135"/>
exposed in the principal hall in public view. Be∣fore it were placed the figures of eunuchs, horses, tortoises, and other animals, in attitudes of grief and respect. The more distant relations of the old lady, and I among the number, came to pay our compliments of condolance, and to salute the de∣ceased after the manner of our country. We had scarce presented our wax candles and perfumes, and given the howl of departure, when, crawling on his belly from under a curtain, out came the reverend Fum Hoam himself, in all the dismal so∣lemnity of distress. Your looks were set for sor∣row; your cloathing consisted in an hempen bag tied round the neck with a string. For two long months did this mourning continue. By night you lay stretched on a single mat, and sate on the stool of discontent by day. Pious man, who could thus set an example of sorrow and decorum to our country. Pious country, where, if we do not grieve at the departure of our friends for their sakes, at least we are taught to regret them for our own.</P>
<P>All is very different here; amazement all. What sort of a people am I got amongst! Fum, thou son of Fo, what sort of people am I got amongst! No crawling round the coffin; no dressing up in hempen bags; no lying on mats, or sitting on stools. Gentlemen here shall put on first mourn∣ing with as sprightly an air as if preparing for a birth-night; and widows shall actually dress for another husband in their weeds for the former. The best jest of all is, that our merry mourners clap bits of muslin on their sleeves, and these are called <HI>weepers.</HI> Weeping muslin; alas, alas, very
<PB N="128" REF="136"/>
sorrowful truly! These weepers then it seems are to bear the whole burthen of the distress.</P>
<P>But I have had the strongest instance of this contrast; this tragi-comical behaviour in distress upon a recent occasion. Their King, whose de∣parture, though sudden, was not unexpected, died after a reign of many years. His age, and uncer∣tain state of health, served in some measure to di∣minish the sorrow of his subjects; and their expec∣tations from his successor seemed to balance their minds between uneasiness and satisfaction. But how ought they to have behaved on such an occa∣sion? Surely, they ought rather to have endea∣voured to testify their <HI>gratitude</HI> to their deceased friend, than to proclaim their <HI>hopes</HI> of the future. Sure even the Successor must suppose their love to wear the face of adulation, which so quickly chang∣ed the object. However, the very same day on which the old King died, they made rejoicing for the new.</P>
<P>For my part, I have no conception of this new manner of mourning and rejoicing in a breath; of being merry and sad; of mixing a funeral proces∣sion with a jig and a bonfire. At least, it would have been just, that they who flattered the King while living for virtues which he had not, should lament him dead for those he really had.</P>
<P>In this universal cause for national distress, as I had no interest myself, so it is but natural to sup∣pose, I felt no real affliction. In all the losses of our friends, says an European philosopher, we first consider how much our own welfare is affected by their departure, and moderate our real grief just in
<PB N="129" REF="137"/>
the same proportion. Now, as I had neither re∣ceived nor expected to receive favours from Kings or their flatterers; as I had no acquaintance in particular with their late monarch; as I knew that the place of a King is soon supplied; and as the Chinese proverb has it, that though the world may sometimes want coblers to mend their shoes, there is no danger of its wanting Emperors to rule their kingdoms; from such considerations, I could bear the loss of a King with the most philosophic resig∣nation. However, I thought it my duty at least to appear sorrowful; to put on a melancholy aspect, or to set my face by that of the people.</P>
<P>The first company I came amongst after the news became general, was a set of jolly companions who were drinking prosperity to the ensuing reign. I entered the room with looks of despair, and even expected applause for the superlative misery of my countenance. Instead of that I was universally condemned by the company for a grimacing son of a whore, and desired to take away my penitential phyz to some other quarter. I now corrected my former mistake, and with the most sprightly air imaginable entered a company, where they were talking over the ceremonies of the approaching fu∣neral. Here I sat for some time with an air of pert vivacity; when one of the chief mourners im∣mediately observing my good humour, desired me, if I pleased to go and grin somewhere else; they wanted no disaffected scoundrels there. Leaving this company therefore, I was resolved to assume a look perfectly neutral; and have ever since been studying the fashionable air: something between jest and earnest; a complete virginity of face, un∣contaminated with the smallest symptom of meaning.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="138"/>But though grief be a very slight affair here, the mourning, my friend, is a very important con∣cern. When an Emperor dies in China, the whole expence of the solemnities is defrayed from the royal coffers. When the great die here, Manda∣rines are ready enough to order mourning; but I do not see that they are so ready to pay for it. If they send me down from court the grey undress frock, or the black coat without pocket holes, I am willing enough to comply with their commands, and wear both; but, by the head of Confucius! to be obliged to wear black, and buy it into the bargain, is more than my tranquility of temper can bear. What, order me to wear mourning before they know whether I can buy it or no! Fum, thou son of Fo, what sort of a people am I got amongst; where being out of black is a certain symptom of poverty; where those who have miserable faces cannot have mourning, and those who have mourn∣ing will not wear a miserable face!</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XCIV.</HI> From the same.</HEAD>
<P>IT is usual for the booksellers here, when a book has given universal pleasure upon one subject, to bring out several more upon the same plan; which are sure to have purchasers and readers from that desire which all men have to view a pleasing object on every side. The first performance serves rather to awake than satisfy attention; and when that is once moved, the slightest effort serves to continue its progression; the merit of the first dif∣fuses
<PB N="131" REF="139"/>
a light sufficient to illuminate the succeeding efforts; and no other subject can be relished, till that is exhausted. A stupid work coming thus im∣mediately in the train of an applauded perform∣ance, weans the mind from the object of its plea∣sure; and resembles the sponge thrust into the month of a discharged culverin, in order to adapt it for a new explosion.</P>
<P>This manner, however, of drawing off a subject, or a peculiar mode of writing to the dregs, effec∣tually precludes a revival of that subject or manner for some time for the future; the sated reader turns from it with a kind of literary nausea; and though the titles of books are the part of them most read, yet he has scarce perseverance enough to wade through the title page.</P>
<P>Of this number I own myself one; I am now grown callous to several subjects, and different kinds of composition: whether such originally pleased I will not lake upon me to determine; but at present I spurn a new book merely upon seeing its name in an advertisement; nor have the smallest curiosity to look beyond the first leaf, even though in the second the author promises his own face neatly engraved on copper.</P>
<P>I am become a perfect Epicure in reading; plain beef or solid mutton will never do. I am for a Chinese dish of bear's claws and bird's nests. I am for sauce strong with assafoetida, or fuming with garlic. For this reason there are an hundred very wise, learned, virtuous, well-intended pro∣ductions that have no charms for me. Thus, for the soul of me, I could never find courage nor
<PB N="132" REF="140"/>
grace enough to wade above two pages deep into <HI>Thoughts upon God and Nature,</HI> or <HI>Thoughts upon Providence,</HI> or <HI>Thoughts upon Free Grace,</HI> or indeed into Thoughts upon any thing at all. I can no longer meditate with Meditations for every day in the year; Essays upon divers subjects cannot allure me, though never so interesting; and as for Fune∣ral Sermons, or even Thanksgiving Sermons, I can neither weep with the one, nor rejoice with the other.</P>
<P>But it is chiefly in gentle poetry, where I seldom look farther than the title. The truth is, I take up books to be told something new; but here, as it is now managed, the reader is told nothing. He opens the book, and there finds very good words, truly, and much exactness of rhyme, but no infor∣mation. A parcel of gaudy images pass on before his imagination like the figures in a dream; but curiosity, induction, reason, and the whole train of affections are fast asleep. The <HI>jocunda et idonea vitae</HI>; those sallies which mend the heart while they amuse the fancy, are quite forgotten: so that a reader who would take up some modern ap∣plauded performances of this kind, must, in order to be pleased, first leave his good sense behind him, take for his recompence and guide bloated and compound epithet, and dwell on paintings, just indeed, because laboured with minute exact∣ness.</P>
<P>If we examine, however, our internal sensations, we shall find ourselves but little pleased with such laboured vanities; we shall find that our applause rather proceeds from a kind of contagion caught up from others, and which we contribute to dif∣fuse, than from what we privately feel. There are
<PB N="133" REF="141"/>
some subjects of which almost all the world per∣ceive the futility; yet all combine in imposing upon each other, as worthy of praise. But chiefly this imposition obtains in literature, where men publicly contemn what they relish with rapture in private, and approve abroad what has given them disgust at home. The truth is, we deliver those criticisms in public which are supposed to be best calculated not to do justice to the author, but to impress others with an opinion of our superior dis∣cernment.</P>
<P>But let works of this kind, which have already come off with such applause, enjoy it all. It is neither my wish to diminish, as I was never consider∣able enough to add to their fame. But for the future I fear there are many poems, of which I shall find spirits to read but the title. In the first place, all odes upon winter, or summer, or autumn; in short all odes, epodes, and monodies whatsoever, shall hereafter be deemed too polite, classical, obscure, and refined, to be read, and entirely above hu∣man comprehension. Pastorals are pretty enough —for those that like them—but to me Thyrsis is one of the most insipid fellows I ever conversed with; and as for Corridon, I do not chuse his company. Elegies and epistles are very fine to those to whom they are addressed; and as for epic poems, I am generally able to discover the whole plan in read∣ing the two first pages.</P>
<P>Tragedies, however, as they are now made, are good instructive moral <HI>sermons</HI> enough; and it would be a fault not to be pleased with <HI>good things.</HI> There I learn several great truths; as, that it is impossible to see into the ways of futurity; that
<PB N="134" REF="142"/>
punishment always attends the villain, that love is the fond soother of the human breast, that we should not resist heaven's will, for in resisting hea∣ven's will, heaven's will is resisted; with several other sentiments equally new, delicate and striking. Every new tragedy therefore I shall go to see; for reflections of this nature make a tolerable har∣mony, when mixed up with a proper quantity of drum, trumpet, thunder, lightening, or the scene shifter's whistle.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XCV.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD some intentions lately of going to visit Bedlam, the place where those who go mad are confined. I went to wait upon the man in black to be my conductor, but I found him preparing to go to Westminster-hall, where the English hold their courts of Justice. It gave me some surprize to find my friend engaged in a law∣suit but more so when he informed me that it had been depending for several years. <HI>How is it pos∣sible,</HI> cried I, <HI>for a man who knows the world to go to law; I am well acquainted with the courts of justice in China, they resemble rat-traps every one of them, nothing more easy to get in, but to get out again is at∣tended with some d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fficu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty, and more cunning than rats are generally found to possess!</HI></P>
<P>Faith, replied my friend, I should not have gone to law, but that I was assured of success before I began; things were presented to me in
<PB N="135" REF="143"/>
so alluring a light, that I thought by barely de∣claring myself a candidate for the prize, I had nothing more to do but to enjoy the fruits of the victory. Thus have I been upon the eve of an ima∣ginary triumph every term these ten years, have travelled forward with victory ever in my view, but ever out of reach; however, at present I fancy we have hampered our antagonist in such a manner, that without some unforeseen demur, we shall this very day lay him fairly on his back.</P>
<P><HI>If things be so situated,</HI> said I, <HI>I don't care if I attend you to the courts, and partake in the pleasure of your success. But prithee,</HI> continued I, as we set forward, <HI>what reasons have you to think an af∣fair at last concluded, which has given you so many former disappointments?</HI> My lawyer tells me, re∣turned he, that I have Salkeld and Ventris strong in my favour, and that there are no less then fif∣teen cases in point. <HI>I understand,</HI> said I, <HI>those are two of your judges who have already declared their opinions.</HI> Pardon me, replied my friend, Salkeld and Ventris are lawyers who some hundred years ago gave their opinion on cases similar to mine; these opinions which make for me my lawyer is to cite, and those opinions which look another way are cited by the lawyer employed by my antagonist; as I observed, I have Salkeld and Ventris for me, he has Coke and Hales, for him, and he that has most opinions is most likely to carry his cause. <HI>But where is the necessity,</HI> cried I, <HI>of prolonging a suit by citing the opinions and reports of others, since the same good sense which determined lawyers in for∣mer ages may serve to guide your judges at this day. They at that time gave their opinions only from the light of reason, your judges have the same light at
<PB N="136" REF="144"/>
present to direct them, let me even add a greater, as in former ages, there were many prejudices from which the present is happily free. If arguing from authorities be exploded from every other branch of learning, why should it be particularly adhered to in this? I plainly foresee how such a method of inves∣tigation must embarrass every suit, and even perplex the student, ceremonies will be multiplied, formali∣ties must encrease, and more time will thus be spent in learning the arts of litigation than in the discovery of right.</HI></P>
<P>I see, cries my friend, that you are for a speedy administration of justice, but all the world will grant that the more time that is taken up in consider∣ing any subject the better it will be understood. Besides, it is the boast of an Englishman, that his property is secure, and all the world will grant that a deliberate administration of justice is the best way to <HI>secure his property.</HI> Why have we so many lawyers, <HI>but to secure our property,</HI> why so many formalities, but <HI>to secure our property?</HI> Not less than one hundred thousand families live in op∣pulence, elegance and ease, merely by <HI>securing our property.</HI></P>
<P>To embarras justice, returned I, by a multi∣plicity of laws, or to hazard it by a confidence in our judges, are, I grant, the opposite rocks on which legislative wisdom has ever split; in one case the client resembles that Emperor, who is said to have been suffocated with the bedcloaths, which were only designed to keep him warm; in the other, to that town which let the enemy take pos∣session of its walls, in order to shew the world how little they depended upon aught but courage for
<PB N="137" REF="145"/>
safety:—But bless me, what numbers do I see here—all in black.—how is it possible that half this multitude find employment? Nothing so easily conceived, returned my companion, they live by watching each other. For instance, the catchpole watches the man in debt, the attorney watches the catchpole, the counsellor watches the attorney, the solicitor the counsellor, and all find sufficient employment. I conceive you, interrupt∣ed I, they watch each other, but it is the client that pays them all for watching; it puts me in mind of a Chinese Fable, which is entituled, <HI>Five animals at a meal.</HI></P>
<P>A grashopper filled with dew, was merrily singing under a shade; a whangam that eats gras∣hoppers had marked it for its prey, and was just stretching forth to devour it; a serpent that had for a long time fed only on whangams, was coiled up to fasten on the whangam; a yellow bird was just upon the wing to dart upon the ser∣pent; a hawk had just stooped from above, to seize the yellow bird; all were intent on their prey, and unmindful of their danger: So the whangam eat the grashopper, the serpent eat the whangam, the yellow bird the serpent, and the hawk the yellow bird; when sousing from on high, a vulture gobbled up the hawk, grashop∣per, whangam, and all in a moment.</P>
<P>I had scarce finished my fable, when the law∣yer came to inform my friend, that his cause was put off till another term, that money was wanted to retain, and that all the world was of opinion, that the very next hearing would bring him off victorious. If so, then cries my friend, I believe
<PB N="138" REF="146"/>
it will be my wisest way to continue the cause for another term, and in the mean time, my friend here and I will go and see Bedlam.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XCVI.</HI> From the same.</HEAD>
<P>I Lately received a visit from the little beau, who I found had assumed a new flow of spirits with a new suit of cloaths. Our discourse hap∣pened to turn upon the different treatment of the fair sex here and in Asia, with the influence of beauty in refining our manners and improving our conversation.</P>
<P>I soon perceived he was strongly prejudiced in favour of the Asiatic method of treating the sex, and that it was impossible to persuade him, but that a man was happier who had four wives at his command, than he who had only one. "It is true, cries he, your men of fashion in the East are slaves, and under some terrors of having their throats squeezed by a bow-string; but what then, they can find ample consolation in a seraglio; they make indeed an indifferent figure in conversation abroad, but then they have a seraglio to console them at home. I am told they have no balls, drums, nor operas, but then they have got a se∣raglio; they may be deprived of wine and French cookery, but they have a seraglio; a seraglio, a seraglio; my dear creature, wipes off every in∣convenience in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="147" MS="y"/>"Besides, I am told, your Asiatic beauties are the most convenient women alive, for they have no souls; positively there is nothing in nature I should like so much as ladies without souls; soul, here, is the utter ruin of half the sex. A girl of eighteen shall have soul enough to spend an hundred pounds in the turning of a trump. Her mother shall have soul enough to ride a sweep∣stake match at an horse-race; her maiden aunt shall have soul enough to purchase the furniture of a whole toy shop, and others shall have soul enough to behave as if they had no souls at all."</P>
<P>With respect to the soul, interrupted I, the Asiatics are much kinder to the fair sex than you imagine; instead of one soul, Fohi the idol of China gives every woman three, the Bramines give them fifteen; and even Mahomet himself, no where excludes the sex from Paradise. Abul∣feda reports, that an old woman one day impor∣tuning him to know what she ought to do in order to gain Paradise? <HI>My good Lady,</HI> answered the Prophet, <HI>old women never get there</HI>; what, never get to Paradise, returned the matron, in a fury! Never, says he, for they always grow young by the way.</P>
<P>No, Sir, continued I, the men of Asia behave with more deference to the sex than you seem to imagine. As you of Europe say grace, upon sit∣ting down to dinner, so it is the custom in China to say grace, when a man goes to bed to his wife, <HI>And may I die,</HI> returned my companion, <HI>but a very pretty ceremony; for seriously, Sir, I see no reason why a man should not he as grateful in one situation as in the other. Upon honour, I always find myself much
<PB N="140" REF="148"/>
more disposed to gratitude, on the couch of a fine wo∣man, than upon sitting down to a sirloin of beef.</HI></P>
<P>Another ceremony, said I, resuming the con∣versation, in favour of the sex amongst us, is the bride's being allowed after marriage, <HI>her three days of freedom.</HI> During this interval a thousand extravagancies are practised by either sex. The lady is placed upon the nuptial bed, and number∣less monkey tricks are played round to divert her. One gentleman smells her perfumed handkerchief. another attempts to untie her garters, a third pulls off her shoe to play hunt the slipper, ano∣ther pretends to be an ideot, and endeavours to raise a laugh by grimacing; in the mean time, the glass goes briskly about, till ladies, gentlemen, wife, husband, and all are mixed together in one inundation of arrack punch.</P>
<P>"Strike me dumb, deaf, and blind, cried my companion, but very pretty; there's some sense in your Chinese ladies condescentions; but among us, you shall scarce find one of the whole sex that shall hold her good humour for three days to∣gether. No later than yesterday I happened to say some civil things to a citizen's wife of my ac∣quaintance, not because I loved, but because I had charity; and what do you think was the tender creature's reply! Only that she detested my pig∣tail wig, high heeled shoes, and sallow com∣plexion. That is all. Nothing more! Yes, by the heavens, though she was more ugly than an unpaint∣ed actress, I found her more insolent than a tho∣rough bred woman of quality."</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="149"/>He was proceeding in this wild manner, when his invective was interrupted, by the man in black, who entered the apartment, introducing his neice, a young lady of exquisite beauty. Her very appearance was sufficient to silence the severest satyrist of the sex; easy without pride, and free without impudence, she seemed capable of sup∣plying every sense with pleasure; her looks, her conversation were natural and unconstrained; she had neither been taught to languish nor ogle, to laugh without a jest, or sigh without sorrow. I found that she had just returned from abroad, and had been conversant in the manners of the world. Curiosity prompted me to ask several questions, but she declined them all. I own I never found myself so strongly prejudiced in favour of apparent merit before; and could willingly have prolonged our conversation, but the company after some time withdrew. Just, however, be∣fore the little beau took his leave he called me aside, and requested I would change him a twenty pound bill, which as I was incapable of doing, he was contented with borrowing half a crown.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XCVII.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi to Hinpgo, by the way of Moscow.</HEAD>
<P>FEW virtues have been more praised by mo∣ralists, than generosity; every practical treatise of Ethics tends to encrease our sensibility of the distresses of others, and to relax the grasp of fru∣gality.
<PB N="142" REF="150"/>
Philosophers that are poor, praise it be∣cause they are gainers by its effects; and the opu∣lent Seneca himself has written a treatise on be∣nefits, though he was known to give nothing away.</P>
<P>But among the many who have enforced the duty of giving, I'm surprised there are none to inculcate the ignominy of receiving, to shew that by every favour we accept, we in some measure forfeit our native freedom, and that a state of continual dependance on the generosity of others is a life of gradual debasement.</P>
<P>Were men taught to despise the receiving obliga∣tions with the same force of reasoning and declama∣tion that they are instructed to confer them, we might then see every person in society filling up the requisite duties of his station with chearful industry, neither relaxed by hope, nor sullen from disap∣pointment.</P>
<P>Every favour a man receives, in some measure sinks him below his dignity, and in proportion to the value of the benefit, or the frequency of its acceptance, he gives up so much of his natural independance. He therefore, who thrives upon the unmerited bounty of another, if he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> any sensibility, suffers the worst of servitude; the shackled slave may murmur without reproach, but the humble dependant is taxed with ingratitude upon every symptom of discontent; the one may rave round the walls of his cell, but the other lingers in all the silence of mental confinement. To encrease his distress, every new obligation but adds to the former load which kept the vi∣gorous mind from rising; till at last, elastic no
<PB N="143" REF="151"/>
longer, it shapes itself to constraint, and puts on habitual servility.</P>
<P>It is thus with the feeling mind; but there are some who, born without any share of sensibility, receive favour after favour, and still cringe for more, who accept the offer of generosity with as little reluctance as the wages of merit, and even make thanks for past benefits an indirect petition for new; such I grant can suffer no debasement from dependance, since they were originally as vile as was possible to be; dependance degrades only the ingenuous, but leaves the sordid mind in pristine meanness. In this manner therefore long continued generosity is misplaced, or it is injuri∣ous; it either finds a man worthless, or it makes him so; and true it is, that the person who is con∣tented to be <HI>often</HI> obliged, ought not to have been obliged at all.</P>
<P>Yet while I describe the meanness of a life of continued dependance, I would not be thought to include those natural or political subordinations which subsist in every society, for in such, tho' dependance is exacted from the inferior, yet the obligation on either side is mutual. The son must rely upon his parent for support, but the parent lies under the same obligations to give, that the other has to expect; the subordinate officer must receive the commands of his superior, but for this obedience the former has a right to demand an intercourse of favour; such is not the dependance I would depreciate, but that where every expected favour must be the result of mere be∣nevolence in the giver, where the benefit can be kept without remorse, or transferred without injustice. The character of a legacy-hunter, for instance is
<PB N="144" REF="152"/>
detestable in some countries, and despicable in all; this universal contempt of a man who infringes upon none of the laws of society, some moral∣ists have arraigned as a popular and unjust pre∣judice; never considering the necessary degrada∣tions a wretch must undergo, who previously ex∣pects to grow rich by benefits without having either natural or social claims to enforce his peti∣tions.</P>
<P>But this intercourse of benefaction and acknow∣ledgement is often injurious even to the giver as well as the receiver; a man can gain but little knowledge of himself, or of the world, amidst a circle of those whom hope or gratitude has ga∣thered round him; their unceasing humiliations must necessarily encrease his comparative magni∣tude, for all men measure their own abilities by those of their company; thus being taught to over∣rate his merit, he in reality lessens it; encreasing in confidence, but not in power, his professions end in empty boast, his undertakings in shameful disappointment.</P>
<P>It is perhaps one of the severest misfortunes of the great, that they are, in general, obliged to live among men whose real value is lessened by dependance, and whose minds are enslaved by obligation. The humble companion may have at first accepted patronage with generous views, but soon he feels the mortifying influence of con∣scious inferiority, by degrees sinks into a flatterer, and from flattery at last degenerates into stupid veneration. To remedy this the great often dis¦miss their old dependants, and take new. Such changes are falsely imputed to levity, falsehood,
<PB N="145" REF="153"/>
or caprice, in the patron, since they may be more justly ascribed to the client's gradual deteriora∣tion.</P>
<P>No, my son, a life of independance is generally a life of virtue. It is that which fits the soul for every generous flight of humanity, freedom, and friendship. To give should be our pleasure, but to receive our shame; serenity, health, and afflu∣ence attend the desire of rising by labour; misery, repentance, and disrespect that of succeeding by extorted benevolence; the man who can thank himself alone for the happiness he enjoys is truly blest; and lovely, far more lovely the sturdy gloom of laborious indigence, than the fawning simper of thriving adulation.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XCVIII.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>IN every society some men are born to teach, and others to receive instruction; some to work, and others to enjoy in idleness the fruits of their industry; some to govern, and others to obey. Every people, how free soever, must be contented to give up part of their liberty and judgment to those who govern, in exchange for their hopes of security; and the motives which first influenced their choice in the election of their governors should ever be weighed against the succeeding apparent inconsistencies of their conduct. All cannot be rulers, and men are generally best
<PB N="146" REF="154"/>
governed by a few. In making way thro' the intri∣cacies of business, the smallest obstacles are apt to retard the execution of what is to be planned by a multiplicity of counsels; the judgment of one alone being always fittest for winding through the labyrinths of intrigue, and the obstructions of disappointment. A serpent, which, as the fa∣ble observes, is furnished with one head and many tails, is much more capable of subsistence and ex∣pedition, than another, which is furnished with but one tail and many heads.</P>
<P>Obvious as these truths are, the people of this country seem insensible of their force. Not satis∣fied with the advantages of internal peace and opulence, they still murmur at their governors, and interfere in the execution of their designs; as if they wanted to be something more than happy. But as the Europeans instruct by argument, and the Asiatics mostly by narration, were I to address them, I should convey my sentiments in the fol∣lowing story.</P>
<P>Takupi had long been Prime Minister of Ti∣partala, a fertile country that stretches along the western confines of China. During his administra∣tion, whatever advantages could be derived from arts, learning, and commerce, were seen to bless the people; nor were the necessary precautions of pro∣viding for the security of the state forgotten. It often happens, however, that when men are pos∣sessed of all they want, they then begin to find tor∣ment from imaginary afflictions, and lessen their present enjoyments, by foreboding that those enjoyments are to have an end. The people now therefore endeavoured to find out grievances;
<PB N="147" REF="155"/>
and after some search, actually began to think themselves aggrieved. A petition against the enor∣mities of Takupi was carried to the throne in due form; and the Queen who governed the country, willing to satisfy her subjects, appointed a day, in which his accusers should be heard, and the Minis∣ter should stand upon his defence.</P>
<P>The day being arrived, and the Minister brought before the tribunal, a carrier, who supplied the city with fish, appeared among the number of his accusers. He exclaimed, that it was the custom, time immemorial, for carriers to bring their fish upon an horse in a hamper; which being placed on one side, and balanced by a stone on the other, was thus conveyed with ease and safety: but that the prisoner, moved either by a spirit of innova∣tion, or perhaps bribed by the hamper-makers, had obliged all carriers to use the stone no longer, but balance one hamper with another; an order entirely repugnant to the customs of all antiquity, and those of the kingdom of Tipartala in particular.</P>
<P>The carrier finished; and the whole court shook their heads at the innovating Minister: when a se∣cond witness appeared. He was inspector of the city buildings, and accused the disgraced favourite of having given orders for the demolition of an an∣cient ruin, which obstructed the passage thro' one of the principal streets. He observed, that such buildings were noble monuments of barbarous antiquity; contributed finely to shew how little their ancestors understood of architecture: and for that reason such monuments should be held sacred, and suffered gradually to decay.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="156"/>The last witness now appeared. This was a widow, who had laudably attempted to burn her∣self upon her husband's funeral pile. But the in∣novating minister had prevented the execution of her design, and was insensible to her tears, protes∣tations, and entreaties.</P>
<P>The Queen could have pardoned the two for∣mer offences; but this last was considered as so gross an injury to the sex, and so directly contrary to all the customs of antiquity, that it called for immediate justice. "What, cried the Queen, not suffer a woman to burn herself when she thinks proper? The sex are to be very prettily tu∣tored, no doubt, if they must be restrained from entertaining their female friends now and then with a fried wife, or roasted acquaintance. I sen∣tence the criminal to be banished my presence for ever for his injurious treatment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the sex."</P>
<P>Takupi had been hitherto silent, and spoke only to shew the sincerity of his resignation. "Great Queen, cried he, I acknowledge my crime; and since I am to be banished, I beg it may be to some ruined town, or desolate village in the coun∣try I have governed. I shall find some pleasure in improving the soil, and bringing back a spirit of industry among the inhabitants." His request ap∣pearing reasonable, it was immediately complied with; and a courtier had orders to fix upon a place of banishment, answering the Minister's de∣scription. After some months search, however, the enquiry proved fruitless; neither a desolate vil∣lage, nor a ruined town, was found in the whole kingdom. <HI>Alas,</HI> said Takupi then to the Queen, <HI>How can that country be ill governed which has neither a

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XCIX.</HI> From the same.</HEAD>
<P>THE ladies here are by no means such ardent gamesters as the women of Asia. In this re∣spect I must do the English justice; for I love to praise where applause is justly merited. Nothing more common in China, than to see two women of fashion continue gaming till one has won all the other's cloaths, and stripped her quite naked; the winner thus marching off in a double suit of finery, and the loser shrinking behind in the primitive sim∣plicity of nature.</P>
<P>No doubt, you remember when <HI>Shang,</HI> our maiden aunt, played with a sharper. First her money went; then her trinkets were produced; her cloaths followed piece by piece soon after; when she had thus played herself quite naked, be∣ing a woman of spirit, and willing to pursue <HI>her own,</HI> she staked her teeth; fortune was against her even here, and her teeth followed her cloaths; at last she played for her left eye, and, oh, hard fate, this too she lost: however, she had the consolation of biting the sharper, for he never per∣ceived
<PB N="150" REF="158"/>
that it was made of glass till it became his own.</P>
<P>How happy, my friend, are the English ladies, who never rise to such an inordinance of passion! Though the sex here are naturally fond of games of chance, and are taught to manage games of skill from their infancy, yet they never pursue ill for∣tune with such amazing intrepidity. Indeed I may entirely acquit them of ever playing—I mean of playing for their eyes or their teeth.</P>
<P>It is true, they often stake their fortune, their beauty, health, and reputations at a gaming-table. It even sometimes happens, that they play their husbands into a jail; yet still they preserve a deco∣rum unknown to our wives and daughters of Chi∣na. I have been present at a route in this country, where a woman of fashion, after losing her money, has sat writhing in all the agonies of bad luck; and yet, after all, never once attempted to strip a sin∣gle petticoat, or cover the board, as her last stake, with her head-cloaths.</P>
<P>However, though I praise their moderation at play, I must not conceal their assiduity. In China our women, except upon some great days, are ne∣ver permitted to finger a dice-box; but here every day seems to be a festival; and night itself, which gives others rest, only serves to encrease the female gamester's industry. I have been told of an old lady in the country, who being given over by the physicians, played with the curate of her parish to pass the time away: having won all his money, she next proposed playing for her funeral charges; the
<PB N="151" REF="159"/>
proposal was accepted; but unfortunately the lady expired just as she had taken in her game.</P>
<P>There are some passions, which though dif∣ferently pursued, are attended with equal conse∣quences in every country: here they game with more perseverance, there with greater fury; here they strip their families, there they strip themselves naked. A lady in China, who indulges a passion for gaming, often becomes a drunkard; and by flourishing a dice-box in one hand, she generally comes to brandish a dram cup in the other. Far be it from me to say there are any who drink drams in England; but it is natural to suppose, that when a lady has lost every thing else but her honour, she wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l be apt to toss that into the bargain; and grown insensible to nicer feelings, behave like the Spa∣niard, who, when all his money was gone, endea∣voured to borrow more, by offering to pawn his whisker.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER C.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi to ***, Merchant in Amsterdam.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE just received a letter from my son, in which he informs me of the fruitlessness of his endeavours to recover the lady with whom he fled from Persia. He strives to cover under the appear∣ance of fortitude a heart torn with anxiety and dis∣appointment. I have offered little consolation; since that but too frequently feeds the sorrow which it pretends to deplore, and strengthens the
<PB N="152" REF="160"/>
impression, which nothing but the external rubs of time and accident can thoroughly efface.</P>
<P>He informs me of his intentions of quitting Moscow the first opportunity, and travelling by land to Amsterdam. I must therefore, upon his ar∣rival, entreat the continuance of your friendship; and beg of you to provide him with proper di∣rections for finding me in London. You can scarcely be sensible of the joy I expect upon seeing him once more: the ties between the father and the son among us of China are much more closely drawn than with you of Europe.</P>
<P>The remittances sent me from Argun to Moscow came in safety. I cannot sufficiently admire that spirit of honesty, which prevails through the whole country of Siberia: perhaps the savages of that desolate region are the only untutored people of the globe, that cultivate the moral virtues, even without knowing that their actions merit praise. I have been told surprising things of their good∣ness, benevolence, and generosity; and the unin∣terrupted commerce between China and Russia serves as a collateral confirmation.</P>
<P><HI>Let us,</HI> says the Chinese law-giver, <HI>admire the rude virtues of the ignorant, but rather imitate the delicate morals of the polite.</HI> In the country where I reside, though honesty and benevolence be not so conge∣nial; yet art supplies the place of nature. Though here every vice is carried to excess; yet every vir∣tue is practised also with unexampled superiority. A city like this is the soil for great virtues and great vices; the villain can soon improve here in the
<PB N="153" REF="161" MS="y"/>
deepest mysteries of deceiving; and the practical philosopher can every day meet new incitements to mend his honest intentions. There are no plea∣sures, sensual or sentimental, which this city does not produce; yet, I know not how, I could not be content to reside here for life. There is something so seducing in that spot in which we first had ex∣istence, that nothing but it can please; whatever vicissitudes we experience in life, however we toil, or wheresoever we wander, our fatigued wishes still recur to home for tranquillity, we long to die in that spot which gave us birth, and in that pleasing expectation opiate every calamity.</P>
<P>You now therefore perceive that I have some intentions of leaving this country; and yet my de∣signed departure fills me with reluctance and re∣gret. Though the friendships of travellers are generally more transient than vernal snows, still I feel an uneasiness at breaking the connections I have formed since my arrival; particularly I shall have no small pain in leaving my usual compa∣nion, guide, and instructor.</P>
<P>I shall wait for the arrival of my son before I set out. He shall be my companion in every intended journey for the future; in his company I can sup∣port the fatigues of the way with redoubled ar∣dour, pleased at once with conveying instruction, and exacting obedience.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CI.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>OUR scholars of China have a most profound veneration for forms. A first rate beauty never studied the decorums of dress with more assiduity; they may properly enough be said to be cloathed with wisdom from head to foot; they have their philosophical caps and philosophical whiskers, their philosophical slippers and philosophical fans; there is even a philosophical standard for measuring the nails; and yet, with all this seeming wisdom, they are often found to be mere empty pretenders.</P>
<P>A philosophical beau is not so frequent in Eu∣rope; yet I am told that such characters are found here. I mean such as punctually support all the decorums of learning, without being really very profound, or naturally possessed of a fine under∣standing; who labour hard to obtain the titular honours attending literary merit; who flatter others, in order to be flattered in turn; and only study to be thought students.</P>
<P>A character of this kind generally receives com∣pany in his study, in all the pensive formality of slippers, night-gown, and easy chair. The table is covered with a large book, which is always kept open, and never read; his solitary hours being dedicated to dozing, mending pens, feel∣ing his pulse, peeping through the microscope, and sometimes reading amusing books, which he condemns in company. His library is preserved
<PB N="155" REF="163"/>
with the most religious neatness; and is generally a repository of scarce books, which bear an high price, because too dull or useless to become com∣mon by the ordinary methods of publication.</P>
<P>Such men are generally candidates for admit∣tance into literary clubs, academies, and insti∣tutions, where they regularly meet to give and receive a little instruction and a great deal of praise. In conversation they never betray ignorance, be∣cause they never seem to receive information. Offer a new observation, they have heard it before; pinch them in an argument, and they reply with a sneer.</P>
<P>Yet how trifling soever these little arts may appear, they answer one valuable purpose, of gain∣ing the practisers the esteem they wish for. The bounds of a man's knowledge are easily concealed, if he has but prudence; but all can readily see and admire a gilt library, a set of long nails, a silver standish, or a well-combed whisker, who are inca∣pable of distinguishing a dunce.</P>
<P>When Father Matthew, the first European Missi∣oner, entered China, the court was informed, that he possessed great skill in astronomy; he was there∣fore sent for, and examined. The established astro∣nomers of state undertook this task; and made their report to the Emperor, that his skill was but very su∣perficial, and no way comparable to their own. The Missioner, however, appealed from their judg∣ment to experience, and challenged them to cal∣culate an eclipse of the moon that was to happen a few nights following. "What, said some, shall a Barbarian, without nails, pretend to vie with
<PB N="156" REF="164"/>
men in astronomy, who have made it the study of their lives, with men who know half the know∣able characters of words, who wear scientifical caps and slippers, and who have gone through every literary degree with applause?" They accepted the challenge, confident of success. The eclipse began; the Chinese produced a most splendid apparatus, and were fifteen minutes wrong; the Missioner, with a single instrument, was exact to a second. This was convincing; but the court astronomers were not to be convinced; instead of acknowledging their error, they assured the Emperor, that their calcula∣tions were certainly exact, but that the stranger, without nails, had actually bewitched the moon. <HI>Well then,</HI> cries the good Emperor, smiling at their ignorance, <HI>you shall still continue to be servants of the moon; but I constitute this man her Controller.</HI></P>
<P>China is thus replete with men, whose only pretensions to knowledge arise from external cir∣cumstances; and in Europe every country abounds with them in proportion to its ignorance. Spain and Flanders, who are behind the rest of Europe in learning, at least three centuries, have twenty literary titles and marks of distinction unknown in France or England: they have their <HI>Clarissimi</HI> and <HI>Preclarissimi,</HI> their <HI>Accurat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssimi</HI> and <HI>Minutissi∣mi</HI>; a Round cap entitles one student to argue, and a Square cap permits another to teach; while a cap with a Tossel, almost sanctifies the head it happens to cover. But where true knowledge is cultivated, these formalities begin to disappear; the ermin'd cowl, the solemn beard, and sweeping train are laid aside; philosophers dress, and talk, and think like other men; and lamb-skin dressers, and cap-makers, and tail-carriers, now deplore a literary</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="165"/>For my own part, my friend, I have seen enough of presuming ignorance, never to venerate wisdom but where it actually appears. I have received literary titles and distinctions myself; and, by the quantity of my own wisdom, know how very little wisdom they can confer. Adieu.</P>

<DIV1 N="102" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD><HI>LETTER CII.</HI> From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>THE time for the young King's coronation ap∣proaches; the great and the little world look forward with impatience. A knight, from the country, who has brought up his family to see, and be seen on this occasion, has taken all the lower part of the house where I lodge. His wife is laying in a large quantity of silks, which the mercer tells her are to be fashionable next season; and Miss, her daughter, has actually had her ears bored previous to the ceremony. In all this bustle of preparation I am considered as mere lumber, and have been shoved up two stories higher to make room for others my landlady seems perfectly convinced are my betters; but whom, before me, she is contented with only calling very good company.</P>
<P>The little beau, who has now forced himself into my intimacy, was yesterday giving me a most minute detail of the intended procession. All men are eloquent upon their favourite topic; and this seemed peculiarly adapted to the size and turn of his understanding. His whole mind was blazoned over with a variety of glittering images; coronets,
<PB N="158" REF="166"/>
escutcheons, lace, fringe, tassels, stones, bugles, and spun glass. "Here, cried he, Garter is to walk; and there Rouge Dragon marches with the escutcheons on his back. Here Clarencieux moves forward; and there Blue Mantle disdains to be left behind. Here the Aldermen march two and two; and there the undaunted Champion of England, no way terrified at the very numerous appearance of gentlemen and ladies, rides forward in complete armour, and, with an intrepid air, throws down his glove. Ah, continued he, should any be so hardy as to take up that fatal glove, and so accept the challenge, we should see fine sport; the Cham∣pion would shew him no mercy; he would soon teach him all his passes with a witness. However, I am afraid we shall have none willing to try it with him, upon the approaching occasion, for two reasons; first, because his antagonist would stand a chance of being killed in the single combat; and secondly, because if he escapes the Champi∣on's arm, he would certainly be hanged for trea∣son. No, no, I fancy none will be so hardy as to dispute it with a Champion like him inured to arms; and we shall probably see him prancing unmolested away, holding his bridle thus in one hand, and brandishing his dram cup in the other."</P>
<P>Some men have a manner of describing, which only wraps the subject in more than former obscu∣rity; thus I was unable, with all my companion's volubility, to form a distinct idea of the intended procession. I was certain, that the inauguration of a King should be conducted with solemnity and re∣ligious awe; and I could not be persuaded that there was much solemnity in this description. If this be true, cried I to myself, the people of Eu∣rope
<PB N="159" REF="167"/>
surely have a strange manner of mixing so∣lemn and fantastic images together; pictures at once replete with burlesque and the sublime. At a time when the King enters into the most solemn compact with his people, nothing surely should be admitted to diminish from the real Majesty of the ceremony. A ludicrous image brought in at such a time throws an air of ridicule upon the whole. It some way resembles a picture I have seen, de∣signed by Albert Durer, where, amidst all the so∣lemnity of that aweful scene, a deity judging, and a trembling world awaiting the decree, he has intro∣duced a merry mortal trundling his scolding wife to hell in a wheel-barrow.</P>
<P>My companion, who mistook my silence, during this interval of reflection, for the rapture of asto∣nishment, proceeded to describe those frivolous parts of the shew, that mostly struck his imagination; and to assure me, that if I stayed in this country some months longer I should see fine things. "For my own part, continued he, I know already of fifteen suits of cloaths, that would stand on one end with gold lace, all designed to be first shewn there; and as for diamonds, rubies, emeralds and pearls, we shall see them as thick as brass nails in a sedan chair. And then we are all to walk so majestical∣ly thus; this foot always behind the foot before. The ladies are to fling nosegays; the court poets to scatter verses; the spectators are to be all in full dress; Mrs. Tibbs, in a new sacque, ruffles, and frenched hair; look where you will, one thing finer than another; Mrs. Tibbs curtesies to the Duchess; her Grace returns the compliment with a bow. Lar∣gess, cries the Herald. Make room cries the Gen∣tleman Usher. Knock him down, cries the guard.
<PB N="160" REF="168"/>
Ah, continued he, amazed at his own description, what an astonishing scene of grandeur can art pro∣duce from the smallest circumstance, when it thus actually turns to wonder one man putting on an∣other man's hat."</P>
<P>I now found his mind was entirely set upon the fopperies of the pageant, and quite regardless of the real meaning of such costly preparations. <HI>Pa∣geants,</HI> says Bacon, <HI>are pretty things; but we should rather study to make them elegant than expensive.</HI> Pro∣cessions, cavalcades, and all that fund of gay frip∣pery, furnished out by taylors, barbers, and tire-women, mechanically influence the mind into ve∣neration: an Emperor, in his night-cap, would not meet with half the respect of an Emperor with a glittering crown. Politics resemble religion; at∣tempting to divest either of ceremony, is the most certain method of bringing either into contempt. The weak must have their inducements to admira∣tion as well as the wise; and it is the business of a sensible government to impress all ranks with a sense of subordination, whether this be effected by a diamond buckle, or a virtuous edict, a sumptuary law, or a glass necklace.</P>
<P>This interval of reflection only gave my compa∣nion spirits to begin his description afresh; and as a greater inducement to raise my curiosity, he in∣formed me of the vast sums that were given by the spectators for places. "That the ceremony must be fine, cries he, is very evident from the fine price that is paid for seeing it. Several ladies have as∣sured me, they could willingly part with one eye, rather than be prevented from looking on with the other. Come, come, continues he, I have a friend,
<PB N="161" REF="169"/>
who, for my sake, will supply us with places at the most reasonable rates; I'll take care you shall not be imposed upon; and he will inform you of the use, finery, rapture, splendour, and enchant∣ment of the whole ceremony better than I."</P>
<P>Follies often repeated lose their absurdity, and assume the appearance of reason: his arguments were so often and so strongly enforced, that I had actually some thoughts of becoming a spectator. We accordingly went together to bespeak a place; but guess my surprise, when the man demanded a purse of gold for a single seat: I could hardly be∣lieve him serious upon making the demand. "Pri∣thee, friend, cried I, after I have paid twenty pounds for sitting here an hour or two, can I bring a part of the Coronation back?" <HI>No, Sir.</HI> "How long can I live upon it after I have come away?" <HI>Not long, Sir.</HI> "Can a Coronation cloath, feed, or fatten me?" <HI>Sir,</HI> replied the man, <HI>you seem to be under a mistake; all that you can bring away is the pleasure of having it to say, that you saw the Corona∣tion.</HI> "Blast me, cries Tibbs, if that be all, there's no need of paying for that, since I am re∣solved to have that pleasure, whether I am there or no!"</P>
<P>I am conscious, my friend, that this is but a very confused description of the intended ceremony. You may object, that I neither settle rank, prece∣dency, nor place; that I seem ignorant whether Gules walks before or behind Garter; that I have neither mentioned the dimensions of a Lord's cap, nor measured the length of a Lady's tail. I know your delight is in minute description; and this I am unhappily disqualified from furnishing; yet,
<PB N="162" REF="170"/>
upon the whole, I fancy it will be no way compa∣rable to the magnificence of our late Emperor Whangti's procession, when he was married to the moon, at which Fum Hoam himself presided in person. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CIII.</HI> To the same.</HEAD>
<P>IT was formerly the custom here, when men of dis∣tinction died, for their surviving acquaintance to throw each a slight present into the grave. Several things of little value were made use of for that pur∣pose; perfumes, reliques, spices, bitter herbs, camo∣mile, wormwood, and verses. This custom how∣ever is almost discontinued; and nothing but verses alone are now lavished on such occasions; an ob∣lation which they suppose may be interred with the dead, without any injury to the living.</P>
<P>Upon the death of the great therefore, the poets and undertakers are sure of employment. While one provides the long cloak, black staff, and mourning coach, the other produces the pastoral or elegy, the monody or apotheosis. The nobility need be under no apprehensions, but die as fast as they think proper, the poet and undertaker are ready to supply them; these can find metaphorical tears and family escutcheons at half an hour's warn∣ing; and when the one has soberly laid the body in the grave, the other is ready to fix it figuratively among the stars.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="171"/>There are several ways of being poetically sor∣rowful on such occasions. The bard is now some pensive youth of science, who sits deploring among the tombs; again he is Thyrsis, complaining in a circle of harmless sheep. Now Britannia sits upon her own shore, and gives a loose to maternal ten∣derness; at another time, Parnassus, even the mountain Parnassus, gives way to sorrow, and is bathed in tears of distress.</P>
<P>But the most usual manner is this: Damon meets Menalcas, who has got a most gloomy counte∣nance. The shepherd asks his friend, whence that look of distress? to which the other replies, that Pollio is no more. If that be the case then, cries Damon, let us retire to yonder bower at some dis∣tance off, where the cypress and the jessamine add fragrance to the breeze; and let us weep alternate∣ly for Pollio, the friend of shepherds, and the pa∣tron of every muse. Ah, returns his fellow shep∣herd, what think you rather of that grotto by the fountain side; the murmuring stream will help to assist our complaints, and a nightingale on a neighbouring tree will join her voice to the con∣cert. When the place is thus settled, they begin: the brook stands still to hear their lamentations; the cows forget to graze; and the very tygers start from the forest with sympathetic concern. By the tombs of our ancestors, my dear Fum, I am quite unaffected in all this distress: the whole is liquid laudanum to my spirits; and a tyger of common sensibility has twenty times more tenderness than I.</P>
<P>But though I could never weep with the com∣plaining shepherd, yet I am sometimes induced to
<PB N="164" REF="172"/>
pity the poet, whose trade is thus to make Demi∣gods and Heroes for a dinner. There is not in na∣ture a more dismal figure than a man who sits down to premeditated flattery; every stanza he writes ta∣citly reproaches the meanness of his occupation, till at last his stupidity becomes more stupid, and his dullness more diminutive.</P>
<P>I am amazed therefore that none have yet found out the secret of flattering the worthless, and yet of preserving a safe conscience. I have often wished for some method by which a man might do himself and his deceased patron justice, without being un∣der the hateful reproach of self-conviction. After long lucubration, I have hit upon such an expedi∣ent; and send you the specimen of a poem upon the decease of a great man, in which the flattery is perfectly fine, and yet the poet perfectly innocent.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CIV.</HI> To the same.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the most usual method in every report, first to examine its probability, and then act as the conjuncture may require. The English, however, exert a different spirit in such circumstances; they first act, and, when too late, begin to examine. From a knowledge of this disposition, there are se∣veral here who make it their business to frame new reports at every convenient interval, all tending to denounce ruin both on their cotemporaries and their posterity. This denunciation is eagerly caught up by the public; away they fling to propagate the distress; sell out at one place, buy in at an∣other, grumble at their governors, shout in mobs, and when they have thus, for some time, behaved like fools, sit down coolly to argue and talk wis∣dom, to puzzle each other with syllogism, and prepare for the next report that prevails, which is always attended with the same success.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="174"/>Thus are they ever rising above one report only to sink into another. They resemble a dog in a well, pawing to get free. When he has raised his upper parts above water, and every spectator ima∣gines him disengaged, his lower parts drag him down again and sink him to the nose; he makes new efforts to emerge, and every effort increasing his weakness, only tends to sink him the deeper.</P>
<P>There are some here, who, I am told, make a tolerable subsistence by the credulity of their coun∣trymen: as they find the public fond of blood, wounds and death, they contrive political ruins suited to every month in the year; this month the people are to be eaten up by the French in flat-bot∣tomed boats; the next by the soldiers, designed to beat the French back; now the people are going to jump down the gulph of luxury; and now no∣thing but an herring subscription can fish them up again. Time passes on; the report proves false; new circumstances produce new changes, but the people never change, they are persevering in folly.</P>
<P>In other countries those boding politicians would be left to fret over their own schemes alone, and grow splenetic without hopes of infecting others: But England seems to be the very region where spleen delights to dwell; a man not only can give an unbounded scope to the disorder in himself, but may, if he pleases, propagate it over the whole kingdom, with a certainty of success. He has only to cry out, that the government, the government is all wrong, that their schemes are leading to ruin, that Britons are no more, every good mem∣ber of the commonwealth thinks it his duty, in such a case, to deplore the universal decadence
<PB N="167" REF="175"/>
with sympathetic sorrow, and, by fancying the constitution in a decay, absolutely to impair its vigour.</P>
<P>This people would laugh at my simplicity, should I advise them to be less sanguine in harbour∣ing gloomy predictions, and examine cooly before they attempted to complain I have just heard a story, which, though transacted in a private fa∣mily, serves very well to describe the behaviour of the whole nation, in cases of threatened calamity. As there are public, so there are private incendi∣aries here. One of the last, either for the amuse∣ment of his friends, or to divert a fit of the spleen, lately sent a threatening letter to a worthy family in my neighbourhood, to this effect.</P>
<P>"SIR, Knowing you to be very rich, and find∣ing myself to be very poor, I think proper to in∣form you, that I have learned the secret of poison∣ing man, woman, and child, without danger of detection. Don't be uneasy, Sir, you may take your choice of being poisoned in a fortnight, or poisoned in a month, or poisoned in six weeks; you shall have full time to settle all your affairs. Though I'm poor, I love to do things like a gen∣tleman. But, Sir, you must die; I have determined it within my own breast that you must die. Blood, Sir, blood is my trade; so I could wish you would this day six weeks take leave of your friends, wife, and family, for I cannot possibly allow you longer time. To convince you more certainly of the pow∣er of my art, by which you may know I speak truth, take this letter; when you have read it, tear off the seal, fold it up, and give it to your favourite Dutch mastiff that sits by the fire, he will
<PB N="168" REF="176"/>
swallow it, Sir, like a butter'd toast; in three hours four minutes after he has taken it, he will attempt to bite off his own tongue, and half an hour after burst asunder in twenty pieces. Blood, blood, blood; so no more at present from, Sir, your most obedient, most devoted humble servant to command till death.</P>
<P>You may easily imagine the consternation into which this letter threw the whole good natured family. The poor man, to whom it was address∣ed, was the more surprised, as not knowing how he could merit such inveterate malice. All the friends of the family were convened; it was uni∣versally agreed, that it was a most terrible affair, and that the government should be solicited to of∣fer a reward and a pardon: a fellow of this kind would go on poisoning family after family; and it was impossible to say where the destruction would end. In pursuance of these determinations the government was applied to; strict search was made after the incendiary, but all in vain. At last, there∣fore, they recollected that the experiment was not yet tried upon the dog; the Dutch mastiff was brought up, and placed in the midst of the friends and relations, the seal was torn off, the pacquet folded up with care, and soon they found to the great surprize of all— that the dog would not eat the letter.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CV.</HI> To the same.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE frequently been amazed at the igno∣rance of almost all the European travellers, who have penetrated any considerable way eastward into Asia. They have been influenced either by motives of commerce or piety, and their accounts are such as might reasonably be expected from men of very narrow or very prejudiced education, the dictates of superstition or the result of igno∣rance. Is it not surprizing, that in such a variety of adventurers not one single philosopher should be found; for as to the travels of Gemelli, the learned are long agreed that the whole is but an imposture.</P>
<P>There is scarce any country how rude or in∣cultivated soever, where the inhabitants are not possessed of some peculiar secrets, either in nature or art, which might be transplanted with success; in Siberian Tartary, for instance, the natives extract a strong spirit from milk, which is a secret probably unknown to the chymists of Eu∣rope. In the most savage parts of India, they are possessed of the secret of dying vegetable substan∣ces scarlet; and of refining lead into a metal which, for hardness and colour, is little inferior to silver; not one of which secrets but would in Eu∣rope make a man's fortune. The power of the Asiatics in producing winds, or bringing down rain, the Europeans are apt to treat as fabulous,
<PB N="170" REF="178"/>
because they have no instances of the like nature among themselves; but they would have treated the secrets of gunpowder, and the mariner's com∣pass, in the same manner, had they been told the Chinese used such arts before the invention was common with themselves at home.</P>
<P>Of all the English philosophers I most reverence <HI>Bacon,</HI> that great and hardy genius; he it is who allows of secrets yet unknown; who, undaunted by the seeming difficulties that oppose, prompts human curiosity to examine every part of nature, and even exhorts man to try whether he cannot subject the tempest, the thunder, and even earthquakes to hu∣man controll: O did a man of his daring spirit, of his genius, penetration, and learning travel to those countries which have been visited only by the superstitious and mercenary, what might not man∣kind expect: how would he enlighten the regions to which he travelled! And what a variety of know∣ledge and useful improvement would he not bring back in exchange!</P>
<P>There is probably no country so barbarous, that would not disclose all it knew, if it received from the traveller equivalent information; and I am apt to think, that a person, who was ready to give more knowledge than he received, would be wel∣come wherever he came. All his care in travelling should only be to suit his intellectual banquet to the people with whom he conversed; he should not at∣tempt to teach the unlettered Tartar astronomy, nor yet instruct the polite Chinese in the ruder arts of subsistence; he should endeavour to improve the Barbarian in the secrets of living comfortably; and the inhabitant of a more refined country in
<PB N="171" REF="179"/>
the speculative pleasures of science. How much more nobly would a philosopher thus employed spend his time, than by sitting at home earnestly intent upon adding one star more to his catalogue; or one monster more to his collection; or still, if possible, more triflingly sedulous in the incatena∣tion of fleas, or the sculpture of a cherry-stone.</P>
<P>I never consider this subject, without being sur∣prized how none of those societies so laudably established in England for the promotion of arts and learning, have never thought of sending one of their members into the most eastern parts of Asia, to make what discoveries he was able. To be convinced of the utility of such an undertaking, let them but read the relations of their own travel∣lers. It will be there found, that they are as often deceived themselves, as they attempt to de∣ceive others. The merchants tells us perhaps the price of different commodities, the methods of baling them up, and the properest manner for an European to preserve his health in the country. The missioner, on the other hand, informs us, with what pleasure the country to which he was sent embraced christianity, and the numbers he converted; what methods he took to keep Lent in a region where there was no fish, or the shifts he made to celebrate the rites of his religion, in places where there was neither bread nor wine; such accounts, with the usual appendage of mar∣riages and funerals, inscriptions, rivers, and moun∣tains, make up the whole of an European travel∣ler's diary; but as to all the secrets of which the inhabitants are possessed, those are universally at∣tributed to magic; and when the traveller can give no other account of the wonders he sees per∣formed,
<PB N="172" REF="180"/>
he very contentedly ascribes them to the power of the devil.</P>
<P>It was an usual observation of <HI>Boyle,</HI> the English chymist, that if every artist would but discover what new observations occurred to him in the exercise of his trade, philosophy would thence gain innumerable improvements. It may be ob∣served, with still greater justice, that if the useful knowledge of every country, howsoever barbarous, was gleaned by a judicious observer, the advan∣tages would be inestimable. Are there not even in Europe, many useful inventions known or prac∣tised, but in one place? The instrument, as an ex∣ample, for cutting down corn in Germany, is much more handy and expeditious, in my opinion, than the sickle used in England. The cheap and ex∣peditious manner of making vinegar without pre∣vious fermentation, is known only in a part of France. If such discoveries therefore, remain still to be known at home; what funds of knowledge might not be collected, in countries yet unex∣plored, or only passed through by ignorant travel∣lers in hasty caravans.</P>
<P>The caution with which foreigners are received in Asia, may be alledged as an objection to such a design. But how readily have several European merchants found admission into regions the most suspecting, under the character of <HI>Sanjapins,</HI> or nor∣thern pilgrims; to such not even China itself de∣nies access.</P>
<P>To send out a traveller, properly qualified for these purposes, might be an object of national concern; it would in some measure repair the
<PB N="173" REF="181"/>
breaches made by ambition; and might shew that there were still some who boasted a greater name than that of patriots, who professed them∣selves lovers of men. The only difficulty would remain in chusing a proper person, for so arduous an enterprize. He should be a man of a philoso∣phical turn, one apt to deduce consequences of general utility from particular occurrences, neither swollen with pride, nor hardened by prejudice, nei∣ther wedded to one particular system, nor instruct∣ed only in one particular science; neither wholly a botanist, nor quite an antiquarian; his mind should be tinctured with miscellaneous knowledge, and his manners humanized by an intercourse with men. He should be, in some measure, an enthu∣siast to the design; fond of travelling, from a rapid imagination, and an innate love of change; furnish∣ed with a body capable sustaining every fatigue, and an heart not easily terrified at danger.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CVI.</HI> From the same.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the principal tasks I had proposed to myself on my arrival here, was to become acquainted with the names and characters of those now living, who as scholars or wits, had acquired the greatest share of reputation. In order to suc∣ceed in this design, I fancied the surest method would be to begin my enquiry among the ignorant,
<PB N="174" REF="182"/>
judging that his fame would be greatest, which was loud enough to be heard by the vulgar. Thus predisposed, I began the search, but only went in quest of disappointment and perplexity. I found every district had a peculiar famous man of its own. Here the story-telling shoemaker had en∣grossed the admiration on one side of the street, while the bellman, who excelleth at a catch, was in quiet possession of the other. At one end of a lane the sexton was regarded as the greatest man alive, but I had not travelled half its length, till I found an enthusiast teacher had divided his reputation. My landlady perceiving my design, was kind enough to offer me her advice in this affair. It was true, she observed, that she was no judge, but she knew what pleased herself, and if I would rest upon her judgment, I should set down Tom Collins as the most ingenious man in the world, for Tom was able to take off all man∣kind, and imitate besides a sow and pigs to per∣fection.</P>
<P>I now perceived, that taking my standard of reputation among the vulgar, would swell my ca∣talogue of great names above the size of a Court Calendar, I therefore discontinued this method of pursuit, and resolved to prosecute my enquiry in that usual residence of fame, a bookseller's shop. In consequence of this I entreated the bookseller to let me know who were they who now made the greatest figure either in morals, wit, or learning. Without giving me a direct answer, he pulled a pamphlet from the shelf, <HI>The Young Attorney's Guide</HI>; there, Sir, cries he, there's a touch for you, fifteen hundred of these moved off in a day: I take the author of this pamphlet either for
<PB N="175" REF="183"/>
title, preface, plan, body, or index to be the com∣pletest hand in England. I found it was vain to prosecute my enquiry, where my informer ap∣peared so incompetent a judge of merit, so paying for the <HI>Young Attorney's Guide,</HI> which good man∣ners obliged me to buy, I walked off.</P>
<P>My pursuit after famous men now brought me into a print shop. Here, thought I, the painter only reflects the public voice. As every man who de∣served it had formerly his statue placed up in the Roman forum, so here probably the pictures of none but such as merit a place in our affections are held up for public sale. But guess my surprize when I came to examine this depositary of noted faces; all distinctions were levelled here, as in the grave, and I could not but regard it as the catacomb of real merit. The brick dust man took up as much room as the truncheoned hero, and the judge was elbowed by the thieftaker; quacks, pimps, and buffoons encreased the groupe, and noted stallions only made room for more noted whores. I had read the works of some of the moderns previous to my coming to England, with delight and approbation, but I found their faces had no place here, the walls were covered with the names of authors I had never known, or had en∣deavoured to forget; with the little self-advertising things of a day who had forced themselves into fashion, but not into fame; I could read at the bottom of some pictures, the names of * *, and * * *, and * * * *, all equally candidates for the vulgar shout, and foremost to propagate their un∣blushing faces upon brass. My uneasiness there∣fore at not finding my few favourite names among the number was now changed into congratulation;
<PB N="176" REF="184"/>
I could not avoid reflecting on the fine observation of Tacitus on a similar occasion. In this cavalcade of flattery, cries the historian, neither the pictures of Brutus, Cassius, nor Cato, were to be seen, <HI>eo clariores quia imagines eorum non deferebantur,</HI> their absence being the strongest proof of their merit.</P>
<P>It is in vain, cried I, to seek for true greatness among these monuments of the unburied dead; let me go among the tombs of those who are con∣fessedly famous, and see if any have been lately deposited there, who deserve the attention of pos∣terity, and whose names may be transmitted to my distant friend, as an honour to the present age. Determined in my pursuit, I paid a second visit to Westminster Abbey. There I found several new monuments erected to the memory of several great men; the names of the great men I abso∣lutely forget, but I well remember that Roubil∣lac was the statuary who carved them. I could not help smiling at two modern epitaphs in particular; one of which praised the deceased for being <HI>ortus ex antiqua stirpe</HI>; the other commend∣ed the dead, because <HI>hanc aedem suis sumptibus reaedificavit:</HI> the greatest merit of one, consisted in his being descended from an illustrious house; the chief distinction of the other, that he had propped up an old house that was falling. Alas, alas, cried I, such monuments as these confer honour, not upon the great men, but upon little Roubillac.</P>
<P>Hitherto disappointed in my enquiry after the great of the present age, I was resolved to mix in company, and try what I could learn among critics in coffee-houses; and here it was that I heard my
<PB N="177" REF="185"/>
favourite names talked of even with inverted fame. A gentleman of exalted merit, as a writer, was branded in general terms as a bad man; another of exquisite delicacy as a poet was reproached for want∣ing good nature; a third was accused of free-think∣ing; and a fourth of having once been a player. Strange, cried I, how unjust are mankind in the distribution of fame; the ignorant among whom I sought at first, were willing to grant, but incapable of distinguishing the virtues of those which de∣served it; among those I now converse with, they know the proper objects of admiration, but mix envy with applause.</P>
<P>Disappointed so often, I was now resolved to examine those characters in person of whom the world talked so freely; by conversing with men of real merit I began to find out those characters which really deserved, though they strove to avoid, applause. I found the vulgar admiration entirely misplaced, and malevolence without its sting. The truly great, possessed of numerous small faults, and shining virtues, preserve a sublime in morals as in writing. They who have attained an excellence in either, commit numberless trangressions, observ∣able to the meanest understanding. The ignorant critic and dull remarker can readily spy blemishes in eloquence or morals, whose sentiments are not sufficiently elevated to observe a beauty; but such are judges neither of books nor of life; they can diminish no solid reputation by their censure, nor bestow a lasting character by their applause: In short, I found by my search, that such only can confer real fame upon others, who have merit themselves to deserve it. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CVII.</HI> To the same.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are numberless employments in the courts of the Eastern Monarchs utterly un∣practised and unknown in Europe. They have no such officers, for instance, as the Emperor's ear-tickler, or tooth-picker; they have never introduced at the courts the Mandarine appointed to bear the royal tobacco-box, or the grave director of the imperial exercitations in the seraglio. Yet I am surprized that the English have imitated us in none of these particulars, as they are generally pleased with every thing that comes from China, and ex∣cessively fond of creating new and useless employ∣ments. They have filled their houses with our furniture, their public gardens with our fire-works, and their very ponds with our fish; our courtiers, my friend, are the fish, and the furniture they should have imported; our courtiers would fill up the necessary ceremonies of a court better than those of Europe, would be contented with re∣ceiving large salaries for doing little, whereas some of this country are at present discontented though they receive large salaries for doing nothing.</P>
<P>I lately, therefore, had thoughts of publishing a proposal here, for the admission of some new Eastern offices and titles into their court register. As I consider myself in the light of a Cosmopolite,

<PB N="179" REF="187"/>
I find as much satisfaction in scheming for the countries in which I happen to reside, as for that in which I was born.</P>
<P>The finest apartments in the palace of Pegu are frequently infested with rats. These the religion of the country strictly forbids the people to kill. In such circumstances therefore they are obliged to have recourse to some great man of the court, who is willing to free the royal apartments even at the hazard of his salvation. After a weak Monarch's reign the quantity of court vermin in every corner of the palace is surprizing, but a prudent king and a vigilant officer soon drives them from their sanctu∣aries behind the matts and the tapestry, and effec∣tually frees the court. Such an officer in England would in my opinion be serviceable at this juncture; for if, as I am told, the palace be old, much vermin must undoubtedly have taken refuge behind the wainscot and hangings. A minister should therefore be invested with the title and dignities of Court-vermin killer; he should have full power either to banish, take, poison or destroy them, with enchantments, traps, ferrets, or ratsbane. He might be permitted to brandish his besom without remorse, and brush down every part of the furni∣ture, without sparing a single cobweb however sacred by long prescription. I communicated this proposal some days ago in a company of the first distinction, and enjoying the most honourable of∣fices of the state. Among the number were the in∣spector of Great Britain, Mr. Henriques the Direc∣tor of the Ministry, Ben. Victor the Treasurer, John Lockman the secretary, and the Conductor of the Imperial Magazine. They all acquiesced
<PB N="180" REF="188"/>
in the utility of my proposal, but were appre∣hensive it might meet with some obstructions from court upholsterers and chamber-maids, who would object to it from the demolition of the furniture, and the dangerous use of ferrets and ratsbane.</P>
<P>My next proposal is rather more general than the former, and might probably meet with less opposition. Though no people in the world flatter each other more than the English, I know none who understand the art less, and flatter with such little refinement. Their panegyric, like a Tartar feast, is indeed served up with profusion, but their cookery is insupportable. A client here shall dress up a fricassee for his patron, that shall offend an ordinary nose before it enters the room. A town shall send up their address to a great mi∣nister, which shall prove at once a satire on the minister and themselves. If the favourite of the day sits, or stands, or sleeps, there are poets to put it into verse, and priests to preach it in the pulpit. In order therefore to free both those who praise, and those who are praised from a duty probably disagreeable to both, I would constitute professed flatterers here as in several courts of In∣dia. These are appointed in the courts of their princes, to instruct the people where to exclaim with admiration, and where to lay an emphasis of praise. But an officer of this kind is always in waiting when the Emperor converses in a familiar manner among his Rajas and other nobility. At every sentence, when the Monarch pauses, and smiles at what he has been saying; the Karamat∣man, as this officer is called, is to take it for
<PB N="181" REF="189"/>
granted, that his Majesty has said a good thing. Upon which he cries out Karamat! Karamat! a miracle, a miracle, and throws up his hands and his eyes in extacy. This is ecchoed by the cour∣tiers around, while the Emperor sits all this time, in sullen satisfaction, enjoying the triumph of his joke, or studying a new repartee.</P>
<P>I would have such an officer placed at every great man's table in England. By frequent practice he might soon become a perfect master of the art, and in time would turn out pleasing to his patron, no way troublesome to himself, and might prevent the nauseous attempts of many more ignorant pre∣tenders. The clergy here, I am convinced, would relish this proposal. It would provide places for several of them. And indeed by some of their late productions many appear to have qualified themselves as candidates for this office already.</P>
<P>But my last proposal I take to be of the ut∣most importance. Our neighbour the Empress of Russia has, you may remember, instituted an order of female knighthood. The Empress of Germany has also instituted another; the Chinese have had such an order time immemorial. I am amazed the English have never come into such an institution. When I consider what kind of men are made knights here, it appears strange, that they have never conferred this honour upon women. They make cheesemongers and pastrycooks Knights; then why not their wives? They have called up tallow chandlers to maintain the hardy profession of chivalry and arms; then why not their wives? Haberdashers are sworn; as I suppose all knights must be sworn, <HI>never to fly in time of mellay or bat∣tle,
<PB N="182" REF="190"/>
to maintain and uphold the noble estate of Chivalry, with horse harnishe and other Knightlye habiliments.</HI> Haberdashers, I say, are sworn to all this, then why not their wives? Certain I am their wives under∣stand fighting and feats of mellay and battle better than they, and as for Knightlye horse and har∣nishe, it is probable both know nothing more than the harness of a one horse chaise. No, no, my friend, instead of conferring any order upon the husbands, I would knight their wives. However the State should not be troubled with a new insti∣tution upon this occasion. Some ancient exploded order might be revived, which would furnish both a motto and a name, the ladies might be permitted to chuse for themselves. There are for instance the obsolete orders of the <HI>Dragon</HI> in Germany, of the <HI>Rue</HI> in Scotland, and the <HI>Porcupine</HI> in France, all well sounding names, and very applicable to my intended female institution.</P>
<P>Adieu.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CVIII.</HI> To the same.</HEAD>
<P>RELIGIOUS Sects in England are far more numerous than in China. Every man who has interest enough to hire a conventicle here, may set up for himself and sell off a new religion. The sellers of the newest pattern at present give ex∣treme good bargains; and let their disciples have a great deal of <HI>confidence</HI> for very little money.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="191"/>Their shops are much frequented, and their cus∣tomers every day encreasing, for people are na∣turally fond of going to Paradise at as small ex∣pence as possible.</P>
<P>Yet you must not conceive this modern sect as differing in opinion from those of the established religion: Difference of opinion indeed formerly divided their sectaries, and sometimes drew their armies to the field. White gowns and black mantles, slapped hats and cross pocket holes were once the obvious causes of quarrel; men then had some reason for fighting, they knew what they fought about; but at present they are arrived at such refinement in religion-making, that they have actually formed a new sect without a new opinion; they quarrel for opinions they both equally de∣fend; they hate each other, and that is all the difference between them.</P>
<P>But though their principles are the same, their practice is somewhat different. Those of the es∣tablished religion laugh when they are pleased, and their groans are seldom extorted but by pain or danger. The new sect, on the contrary, weep for their amusement, and use little music except a chorus of sighs and groans, or tunes that are made to imitate groaning. Laughter is their aversion; lovers court each other from the lamentations; the bridegroom approaches the nuptial couch in sor∣rowful solemnity, and the bride looks more dismal than an undertaker's shop. Dancing round the room is with them running in a direct line to the devil; and as for gaming, though but in jest, they would sooner play with a rattle-snake's tail, than finger a dice-box.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="192"/>By this time you perceive that I am describing a sect of Enthusiasts, and you have already compa∣red them with the Faquirs, Bramins, and Talapoins of the East. Among these, you know, are gene∣rations that have been never known to smile, and voluntary affliction makes up all the merit they can boast of. Enthusiasms in every country produce the same effects; stick the Faquir with pins, or confine the Bramine to a vermine hospital, spread the Talapoin on the ground, or load the Sectary's brow with contrition; those worshipers who dis∣card the light of reason, are ever gloomy; their fears encrease in proportion to their ignorance, as men are continually under apprehensions who walk in darkness.</P>
<P>Yet there is still a stronger reason for the en∣thusiast's being an enemy to laughter, namely, his being himself so proper an object of ridicule. It is remarkable that the propagators of false doctrines have ever been averse to mirth, and always begin by recommending gravity, when they intended to disseminate imposture. Fohi, the idol of China, is represented as having never laughed; Zoroaster the leader of the Bramins is said to have laughed but twice, upon his coming into the world, and upon his leaving it; and Mahomet himself, though a lover of pleasure, was a professed opposer of gaiety. Upon a certain occasion telling his fol∣lowers, that they would all appear naked at the resurrection, his favourite wife represented such an assembly as immodest and unbecoming. Fool∣ish woman, cried the grave prophet, though the whole assembly be naked, on that day they shall have forgotten to laugh. Men like him opposed ridicule, because they knew it to be a most for∣midable
<PB N="185" REF="193"/>
antagonist, and preached up gravity, to conceal their own want of importance.</P>
<P>Ridicule has ever been the most powerful ene∣my of enthusiasm, and properly the only anta∣gonist that can be opposed to it with success. Per∣secution only serves to propagate new religions; they acquire fresh vigour beneath the executioner and the ax, and like some vivacious insects, multiply by dissection. It is also impossible to combat en∣thusiasm with reason, for though it makes a shew of resistance, it soon eludes the pressure, refers you to distinctions not to be understood, and feel∣ings which it cannot explain. A man who would endeavour to fix an enthusiast by argument, might as well attempt to spread quicksilver with his fingers. The only way to conquer a visionary is to despise him; the stake, the faggot, and the disputing Doctor, in some measure ennoble the opinions they are brought to oppose; they are harmless against innovating pride; contempt alone is truly dreadful. Hunters generally know the most vulnerable part of the beasts they pursue, by the care which every animal takes to defend the side which is weakest; on what side the en∣thusiast is most vulnerable, may be known by the care which he takes in the beginning to work his disciples into gravity, and guard them against the power of ridicule.</P>
<P>When Philip the second was King of Spain, there was a contest in Salamanca between two or∣ders of friars for superiority. The legend of one side contained more extraordinary miracles, but the legend of the other was reckoned most au∣thentic. They reviled each other, as is usual in
<PB N="186" REF="194"/>
disputes of divinity, the people were divided into factions, and a civil war appeared unavoidable. In order to prevent such an imminent calamity, the combatants were prevailed upon to submit their legions to the fiery trial, and that which came forth untouched by the fire was to have the victory, and to be honoured with a double share of reverence. Whenever the people flock to see a miracle, it is an hundred to one, but that they see a miracle; incredible therefore were the num∣bers that were gathered round upon this occasion; the friars on each side approached, and confidently threw their respective legends into the flames, when lo, to the utter disappointment of all the assembly, instead of a miracle, both legends were consumed. Nothing but thus turning both parties into con∣tempt, could have prevented the effusion of blood. The people now laughed at their former folly, and wondered why they fell out. Adieu.</P>

<P>THE English are at present employed in cele∣brating a feast which becomes general every seventh year; the Parliament of the nation being then dissolved and another appointed to be chosen. This solemnity falls infinitely short of our feast of the lanthorns in magnificence and splendour; it is also surpassed by others of the East in unanimity and pure devotion, but no festival in the world can compare with it for eating. Their eating indeed amazes me: Had I five hundred heads, and were each head furnished with brains, yet would they
<PB N="187" REF="195"/>
all be insufficient to compute the number of cows, pigs, geese and turkies, which upon this occasion die for the good of their country!</P>
<P>To say the truth, eating seems to make a grand ingredient in all English parties of zeal, business or amusement. When a Church is to be built, or an Hospital endowed, the Directors assemble, and instead of consulting upon it, they eat upon it, by which means the business goes forward with success. When the Poor are to be relieved, the officers appointed to dole out public charity, as∣semble and eat upon it: Nor has it ever been known, that they filled the bellies of the poor till they had previously satisfied their own. But in the election of Magistrates the people seem to ex∣ceed all bounds; the merits of a candidate are often measured by the number of his treats; his constituents assemble, eat upon him, and lend their applause, not to his integrity or sense, but the quantities of his beef and brandy.</P>
<P>And yet I could forgive this people their plenti∣ful meals on this occasion, as it is extremely na∣tural for every man to eat a great deal when he gets it for nothing; but what amazes me is, that all this good living no way contributes to improve their good humour. On the contrary, they seem to lose their temper as they lose their appetites; every morsel they swallow, and every glass they pour down serves to encrease their animosity. Many an honest man, before as harmless as a tame rabbit, when loaded with a single election dinner, has become more dangerous than a charged cul∣verin. Upon one of these occasions, I have ac∣tually seen a bloody minded Man Milliner sally
<PB N="188" REF="196"/>
forth at the head of a mob, determined to face a desperate Pastry Cook, who was General of the opposite party.</P>
<P>But you must not suppose they are without a pretext for thus beating each other. On the con∣trary, no man here is so uncivilized as to beat his neighbour without producing very sufficient rea∣sons. One candidate, for instance, treats with gin, a spirit of their own manufacture; another, al∣ways drinks brandy imported from abroad. Bran∣dy is a wholesome liquor; gin a liquor whol∣ly their own. This then furnishes an obvious cause of quarrel, Whether it be most reasonable to get drunk with gin, or get drunk with brandy? The mob meet upon the debate; fight themselves sober; and then draw off to get drunk again, and charge for another encounter. So that the English may now properly be said to be engaged in war; since while they are subduing their enemies abroad, they are breaking each other's heads at home.</P>
<P>I lately made an excursion to a neighbouring village, in order to be a spectator of the cere∣monies practised upon this occasion. I left town in company with three fidlers, nine dozen of hams, and a corporation poet, which were designed as reinforcements to the gin drinking party. We entered the town with a very good face; the fid∣lers, no way intimidated by the enemy, kept hand∣ling their arms up the principal street. By this prudent manoeuvre they took peaceable possession of their head-quarters, amidst the shouts of multi∣tudes, who seemed perfectly rejoiced at hearing their music, but above all at seeing their bacon.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="197"/>I must own I could not avoid being pleased to see all ranks of people on this occasion, levelled into an equality, and the poor, in some measure, en∣joying the primitive privileges of nature. If there was any distinction shewn, the lowest of the peo∣ple seemed to receive it from the rich. I could perceive a cobler with a levee at his door, and an haberdasher giving audience from behind his coun∣ter. But my reflections were soon interrupted by a mob, who demanded whether I was for the Distillery, or the Brewery? as these were terms with which I was totally unacquainted, I chose at first to be silent; however, I know not what might have been the consequence of my reserve, had not the attention of the mob been called off to a skirmish between a brandy-drinker's cow, and a gin-drinker's mastiff, which turned out, greatly to the satisfaction of the mob, in favour of the mastiff.</P>
<P>This spectacle, which afforded high entertain∣ment, was at last ended by the appearance of one of the candidates; who came to harangue the mob; he made a very pathetic speech upon the late ex∣cessive importation of foreign drams; and the downfall of the distillery: I could see some of the audience shed tears. He was accompanied in his procession by Mrs. Deputy and Mrs. Mayoress. Mrs. Deputy was not in the least in liquor; and for Mrs. Mayoress, one of the spectators assured me in my ear that, — She was a very fine woman be∣fore she had the small-pox.</P>
<P>Mixing with the croud, I was now conducted to the hall where the magistrates are chosen; but what tongue can describe this scene of confusion; the whole crowd seemed equally inspired with an∣ger,
<PB N="190" REF="198"/>
jealousy, politics, patriotism and punch: I remarked one figure that was carried up by two men upon this occasion. I at first began to pity his infirmities as natural, but soon found the fel∣low so drunk that he could not stand; another made his appearance to give his vote, but though he could stand, he actually lost the use of his tongue, and remained silent; a third, who though excessively drunk could both stand and speak, be∣ing asked the Candidate's name for whom he voted, could be prevailed upon to make no other answer, but Tobacco and Brandy. In short, an election-hall seems to be a theatre where every passion is seen without disguise; a school where fools may readily become worse, and where philoso∣phers may gather wisdom. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CX.</HI> From the same.</HEAD>
<P>THE disputes among the learned here are now carried on in a much more compendious man∣ner than formerly. There was a time when fo∣lio was brought to oppose folio, and a champion was often listed for life under the banners of a single sorites. At present, the controversy is de∣cided in a summary way; an epigram or an acros∣tic finishes the debate, and the combatant, like the incursive Tartar, advances, and retires with a single blow.</P>
<P>An important literary debate at present engrosses the attention of the town. It is carried on with
<PB N="191" REF="199"/>
sharpness, and a proper share of this epigram∣matical fury. An author, it seems has taken an aversion to the faces of several players, and has written verses to prove his dislike; the players fall upon the author, and assure the town he must be dull, and their faces must be good, because he wants a dinner; a critic comes to the poet's as∣sistance, asserting, that the verses were perfectly original, and so smart that he could never have written them without the assistance of friends; the friends upon this arraign the critic, and plainly prove the verses to be all the author's own. So at it they are all four together by the ears, the friends at the critic, the critic at the players, the players at the author, and the author at the players again. It is impossible to determine how this many-sided contest will end, or which party to adhere to. The town, without siding with any, views the com∣bat in suspense, like the fabled hero of antiquity, who beheld the earth-born brothers give and re∣ceive mutual wounds, and fall by indiscriminate destruction.</P>
<P>This is in some measure a state of the present dispute; but the combatants here differ in one respect from the champions of the fable. Every new wound only gives vigour for another blow; though they appear to strike, they are in fact mu∣tually swelling themselves into consideration, and thus advertising each other away into fame. To∣day says one, my name shall be in the Gazette, the next day my rival's; people will naturally enquire about us; thus we shall at least make a noise in the streets, though we have got nothing to sell. I have read of a dispute of a similar nature, which was managed here about twenty years ago. Hilde∣brand
<PB N="192" REF="200"/>
Jacob, as I think he was called, and Charles Johnson were poets, both at that time possessed of great reputation, for Johnson had written eleven plays acted with great success, and Jacob, though he had written but five, had five times thanked the town for their unmerited applause. They soon be∣came mutually enamoured of each other's talents; they wrote, they felt, they challenged the town for each other. Johnson assured the public that no poet alive had the easy simplicity of Jacob, and Jacob exhibited Johnson as a master-piece in the pathetic. Their mutual praise was not without effect, the town saw their plays, were in raptures, read, and without censuring them, forgot them. So formidable an union, however, was soon op∣posed by Tibbald. Tibbald asserted that the tra∣gedies of one had faults, and the comedies of the other substituted wit for vivacity; the combined champions flew at him like tygers, arraigned the censurer's judgment, and impeached his sincerity. It was a long time a dispute among the learned, which was in fact the greatest man, Jacob, John∣son or Tibbald; they had all written for the stage with great success, their names were seen in almost every paper, and their works in every cof∣fee-house. However, in the hottest of the dispute, a fourth combatant made his appearance, and swept away the three combatants, tragedy, comedy and all into undistinguished ruin.</P>
<P>From this time they seemed consigned into the hands of criticism, scarce a day passed in which they were not arraigned as detested writers. The critics, these enemies of Dryden and Pope, were their enemies. So Jacob and Johnson, instead of mending by criticism, called it envy, and because Dryden and Pope were censured, they compared themselves to Dryden and Pope.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="201"/>But to return; the weapon chiefly used in the present controversy is Epigram, and certainly never was a keener made use of. They have discovered surprising sharpness on both sides. The first that came out upon this occasion was a kind of new composition in this way, and might more properly be called an epigrammatic thesis, than an Epigram. It consists, first, of an argument in prose; next follows a motto from Roscommon; then comes the the epigram; and lastly, notes serving to explain the Epigram. But you shall have it with all its decorations.</P>

<P>There, there's a perplex! I could have wished, to make it quite perfect, the author, as in the case before, had added notes. Almost every word admits a scholium, and a long one too. I, YOU, HE! Suppose a stranger should ask, and who are you? Here are three obscure persons spoken of, that may in a short time be utterly forgotten.

<P>Yet by being thus a spectator of others dangers, I must own I begin to tremble in this literary contest for my own.

I may safely aver, that <HI>I never gave any creature in this good city offence,</HI> except only my rival Doctor Rock, yet by the letters I every day receive, and by some I have seen printed, I am arraigned at one time as being a dull fellow, at another as being pert; I am here petulant, there I am heavy; by the head of my ancestors, they treat me with more inhumanity than a flying fish. If I dive and run my nose to the bottom, there a de∣vouring shark is ready to swallow me up; If I skim the surface, a pack of dolphins are at my tail to snap me; but when I take wing and attempt to escape them by flight, I become a prey to every ravenous bird, that winnows the bosom of the deep.</P>

<P>THE Formalities, delays and disappointments, that precede a treaty of marriage here, are usually as numerous as those previous to a treaty of peace. The laws of this country are finely cal∣culated
<PB N="196" REF="204"/>
to promote all commerce, but the com∣merce between the sexes. Their encouragements for propagating hemp, madder and tobacco, are indeed admirable! Marriages are the only com∣modity that meet with none.</P>
<P>Yet from the vernal softness of the air, the ver∣dure of the fields, the transparency of the streams, and the beauty of the women, I know few coun∣tries more proper to invite to courtship. Here love might sport among painted lawns and warbling groves, and revel upon gales, wafting at once both fragrance and harmony. Yet it seems he has forsaken the island; and when a couple are now to be married, mutual love or an union of minds is the last and most trifling consideration. If their goods and chattles can be brought to unite, their sympathetic souls are ever ready to guarantee the treaty. The gentleman's mortgaged lawn becomes enamoured of the ladies marriagable grove; the match is struck up, and both parties are piously in love—according to act of Parliament.</P>
<P>Thus they, who have fortune, are possessed at least of something that is lovely; but I actually pity those that have none. I am told there was a time, when Ladies with no other merit but youth, virtue and beauty, had a chance for husbands, at least, among the ministers of the church, or the officers of the army. The blush and innocence of sixteen was said to have a powerful influence over these two professions. But of late, all the little traffic of blushing, ogling, dimpling, and smiling, has been forbidden by an act in that case wisely made and provided. A Lady's whole cargo of smiles, sighs and whispers, is declared utterly
<PB N="197" REF="205"/>
contraband, till she arrives in the warm latitudes of twenty-two, where commodities of this nature are too often found to decay. She is then per∣mitted to dimple and smile, when the dimples and smiles begin to forsake her; and when per∣haps grown ugly, is charitably entrusted with an unlimited use of her charms. Her lovers, how∣ever, by this time have forsaken her; the captain has changed for another mistress; the priest him∣self leaves her in solitude, to bewail her virginity, and she dies even without benefit of clergy.</P>
<P>Thus you find the Europeans discouraging love with as much earnestness as the rudest savage of Sofala. The Genius is surely now no more. In every region I find enemies in arms to oppress him. Avarice in Europe, jealousy in Persia, ceremony in China, poverty among the Tartars, and lust in Circassia, are all prepared to oppose his power. The Genius is certainly banished from earth, though once adored under such a variety of forms. He is no where to be found; and all that the Ladies of each country can produce, are but a few trifling reliques as instances of his former residence and favour.</P>
<P>The genius of Love, says the eastern Apologue, had long resided in the happy plains of Abra, where every breeze was health, and every sound produced tranquility. His temple at first was crowded, but every age lessened the number of his votaries, or cooled their devotion. Perceiv∣ing, therefore, his altars at length quite deserted, he was resolved to remove to some more propitious region, and he apprized the fair sex of every coun∣try, where he could hope for a proper reception,
<PB N="198" REF="206"/>
to assert their right to his presence among them. In return to this proclamation, embassies were sent from the Ladies of every part of the world to invite him, and to display the superiority of their claims.</P>
<P>And first the beauties of China appeared. No country could compare with them for modesty, either of look, dress, or behaviour; their eyes were never lifted from the ground; their robes of the most beautiful silk hid their hands, bosom and neck, while their faces only were left un∣covered. They indulged no airs that might ex∣press loose desire, and they seemed to study only the graces of inanimate beauty. Their black teeth and plucked eyebrows were, however, alledged by the Genius against them, but he set them entirely aside when he came to examine their little feet.</P>
<P>The beauties of Circassia next made their ap∣pearance. They advanced hand in hand, singing the most immodest airs, and leading up a dance in the most luxurious attitudes. Their dress was but half a covering; the neck, the left breast, and all the limbs, were exposed to view, which after some time seemed rather to satiate than inflame desire. The lily and the rose contended in forming their complexions; and a soft sleepiness of eye added irresistible poignance to their charms: but their beauties were obtruded, not offered to their ad∣mirers; they seemed to give rather than receive courtship; and the genius of Love dismissed them as unworthy his regard, since they exchanged the duties of love, and made themselves not the pursued, but the pursuing sex.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="207"/>The kingdom of Kashmire next produced its charming deputies. This happy region seemed peculiarly sequestered by nature for his abode. Shady mountains fenced it on one side from the scorching sun; and seaborn breezes, on the other, gave peculiar luxuriance to the air. Their com∣plexions were of a bright yellow, that appeared almost transparent, while the crimson tulip seem∣ed to blossom on their cheeks. Their features and limbs were delicate beyond the statuary's power to express; and their teeth whiter than their own ivory. He was almost persuaded to reside among them, when unfortunately one of the ladies talked of appointing his seraglio.</P>
<P>In this procession the naked inhabitants of Southern America would not be left behind: their charms were found to surpass whatever the warm∣est imagination could conceive; and served to shew, that beauty could be perfect, even with the seem∣ing disadvantage of a brown complexion But their savage education rendered them utterly un∣qualified to make the proper use of their power, and they were rejected as being incapable of uniting mental with sensual satisfaction. In this manner the deputies of other kingdoms had their suits rejec∣ted: the black beauties of Benin, and the tawny daughters of Borneo, the women of Wida with well scarred faces, and the hideous virgins of Cafraria; the squab ladies of Lapland, three feet high, and the giant fair ones of Patagonia.</P>
<P>The beauties of Europe at last appeared: grace was in their steps, and sensibility sate smiling in every eye. It was the universal opinion, while they were approaching, that they would prevail;
<PB N="200" REF="208"/>
and the Genius seemed to lend them his most favourable attention. They opened their preten∣sions with the utmost modesty; but unfortunately as their orator proceeded she happened to let fall the words <HI>house in town, settlement and pin-money.</HI> These seemingly harmless terms had instantly a surprising effect: the Genius with ungovernable rage burst from amidst the circle; and waving his youthful pinions, left this earth, and flew back to those etherial mansions from whence he descended.</P>
<P>The whole assembly was struck with amaze∣ment: they now justly apprehended, that female power would be no more, since love had forsaken them. They continued some time thus in a state of torpid despair, when it was proposed by one of the number▪ that, since the real Genius had left them, in order to continue their power, they should set up an idol in his stead; and that the ladies of every country should furnish him with what each liked best. This proposal was instantly relished and agreed to. An idol was formed by uniting the capricious gifts of all the assembly, tho' no way resembling the departed Genius. The ladies of China furnished the monster with wings; those of Kashmire supplied him with horns; the dames of Europe clapped a purse in his hand; and the virgins of Congo furnished him with a tail Since that time, all the vows addressed to love are in reality paid to the idol; but, as in other false religions, the adoration seems most fervent, where the heart is least sincere.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CXII.</HI> To the same.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND have ever been prone to expati∣ate in the praise of human nature. The dignity of man is a subject that has always been the favourite theme of humanity; they have de∣claimed with that ostentation, which usually ac∣companies such as are sure of having a partial audience; they have obtained victories, because there were none to oppose. Yet from all I have ever read or seen, men appear more apt to err by having too high, than by having too des∣picable an opinion of their nature; and by attempt∣ing to exalt their original place in the creation, depress their real value in society.</P>
<P>The most ignorant nations have always been found to think most highly of themselves. The Deity has ever been thought peculiarly concerned in their glory and preservation; to have fought their battles, and inspired their teachers: their wizzards are said to be familiar with heaven; and every hero has a guard of angels, as well as men to attend him. When the Portuguese first came among the wretched inhabitants of the coast of Africa, these savage nations readily allowed the strangers more skill in navigation and war; yet still considered them, at best, but as useful servants brought to their coasts, by their guardian serpent, to supply them with luxuries they could have lived without. Though they could grant the Portuguese
<PB N="202" REF="210"/>
more riches; they could never allow them to have such a king as their Tottimondelem, who wore a bracelet of shells round his neck, and whose legs were covered with ivory.</P>
<P>In this manner, examine a savage in the history of his country and predecessors; you ever find his warriors able to conquer armies, and his sages ac∣quainted with more than possible knowledge: hu∣man nature is to him an unknown country; he thinks it capable of great things, because he is igno∣rant of its boundaries; whatever can be conceived to be done he allows to be possible, and whatever is possible he conjectures must have been done. He never measures the actions and powers of others by what himself is able to perform, nor makes a proper estimate of the greatness of his fellows by bringing it to the standard of his own incapacity. He is satisfied to be one of a country where mighty things have been; and imagines the fancied power of others reflects a lustre on himself. Thus, by de∣grees, he loses the idea of his own insignificance in a confused notion of the extraordinary powers of humanity, and is willing to grant extraordinary gifts to every pretender, because unacquainted with their claims.</P>
<P>This is the reason, why Demi-gods and Heroes have ever been erected in times or countries of ignorance and barbarity; they addressed a people who had high opinions of human nature, because they were ignorant how far it could extend; they addressed a people who were willing to allow that men should be gods, because they were yet im∣perfectly acquainted with God, and with man. These impostors knew, that all men are naturally
<PB N="203" REF="211"/>
fond of seeing something very great made from the little materials of humanity; that ignorant nations are not more proud of building a tower to reach heaven, or a pyramid to last for ages, than of raising up a Demi-god of their own country and creation. The same pride, that erects a colos∣sus or a pyramid, installs a God or an Hero: but though the adoring savage can raise his colossus to the clouds, he can exalt the Hero not one inch above the standard of humanity; incapable there∣fore of exalting the idol, he debases himself and falls prostrate before him.</P>
<P>When man has thus acquired an erroneous idea of the dignity of his species, he and the Gods become perfectly intimate; men are but angels, angels are but men, nay but servants that stand in waiting to execute human commands. The Per∣sians, for instance, thus address their prophet Haly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chardins' Travels, p. 401.</NOTE>. 'I salute thee, glorious Creator, of whom the sun is but the shadow. Masterpiece of the Lord of human creatures, great star of justice and religion. The sea is not rich and liberal but by the gifts of thy munificent hands. The angel treasurer of heaven reaps his harvest in the fertile gardens of the purity of thy nature. The primum mobile would never dart the ball of the sun through the trunk of heaven, were it not to serve the morn∣ing out of the extreme love she has for thee. The angel Gabriel, messenger of truth, every day kisses the groundsil of thy gate. Were there a place more exalted than the most high throne of God, I would affirm it to be thy place, O master of the faithful; Gabriel with all his art and know∣ledge is but a meer scholar to thee.' Thus, my
<PB N="204" REF="212"/>
friend, men think proper to treat angels; but if indeed there be such an order of beings, with what a degree of satirical contempt must they listen to the songs of little mortals thus flattering each other. Thus to see creatures, wiser indeed than the monkey, and more active than the oyster, claiming to themselves the mastery of heaven; minims, the tenants of an atom, thus arrogating a a partnership in the creation of universal nature! Sure heaven is kind that launches no thunder at those guilty heads; but it is kind, and regards their follies with pity, nor will destroy creatures that it loved into being.</P>
<P>But whatever success this practice of making Demi-gods might have been attended with in barbarous nations, I don't know that any man became a God in a country, where the inhabitants were refined. Such countries generally have too close an inspection into human weakness, to think it invested with celestial power. They sometimes indeed admit the Gods of strangers, or of their ancestors, which had their existence in times of ob∣scurity; their weakness being forgotten, while no∣thing but their power and their miracles were re∣membred. The Chinese, for instance, never had a God of their own country; the idols which the vulgar worship at this day were brought from the barbarous nations around them. The Roman Em∣perors, who pretended to divinity, were generally ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght by a poignard that they were mortal; and Alexander, though he passed among barbarous countries for a real God, could never persuade his polite countrymen into a similitude of think∣ing.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CXIII.</HI> To the same.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is something irresistibly pleasing in the conversation of a fine woman; even though her tongue be silent, the eloquence of her eyes teaches wisdom. The mind sympathizes with the regularity of the object in view, and struck with external grace, vibrates into respondent harmony. In this agreeable disposition, I lately found myself in company with my friend and his niece. Our conversation turned upon love, which she seemed equally capable of defending and inspiring. We were each of different opinions upon this subject; the lady insisted that it was a natural and uni∣versal passion, and produced the happiness of those who cultivated it with proper precaution. My friend denied it to be the work of nature, but allowed it to have a real existence, and affirmed that it was of infinite service in refining society; while I, to keep up the dispute, affirmed it to be merely a name, first used by the cunning part of the fair sex, and admitted by the silly part of ours, there∣fore no way more natural than taking snuff or chewing opium.</P>
<P>"How is it possible, cried I, that such a passion can be natural, when our opinions even of beauty, which inspires it, are entirely the result of fashion and caprice? The ancients, who pretended to be connoisseurs in the art, have praised narrow fore∣heads, red hair, and eyebrows that joined each other over the nose. Such were the charms that
<PB N="206" REF="214"/>
once captivated Catullus, Ovid, and Anacreon. Ladies would at present be out of humour, if their lovers praised them for such graces; and should an antique beauty now revive, her face would certainly be put under the discipline of the twee∣zer, forehead-cloth and lead comb, before it could be seen in public company."</P>
<P>"But the difference between the antients and moderns is not so great, as between the different countries of the present world. A lover of Gon∣gora, for instance, sighs for thick lips; a Chinese lover is poetical in praise of thin. In Circassia a streight nose is thought most consistent with beau∣ty; cross but a mountain which separates it from the Tartars, and there flat noses, tawny skins, and eyes three inches asunder, are all the fashion. In Persia and some other countries, a man when he marries, chuses to have his bride a maid; in the Phillipine Islands, if a bridegroom happens to per∣ceive on the first night that he is put off with a virgin, the marriage is declared void to all in∣tents and purposes, and the bride sent back with disgrace. In some parts of the East, a woman of beauty, properly fed up for sale, often amounts to one hundred crowns; in the kingdom of Loango, Ladies of the very best fashion are sold for a pig, Queens however sell better, and sometimes amount to a cow. In short, turn even to England, don't I there see the beautiful part of the sex neglected; and none now marrying or making love but old men and old women that have saved money? Don't I see beauty from fifteen to twenty one rendered null and void to all intents and purposes, and those six precious years of womanhood put under a
<PB N="207" REF="215" MS="y"/>
statute of virginity? What! shall I call that rancid passion love, which passes between an old batchelor of fifty-six and a widow lady of forty-nine? Never! never! What advantage is society to reap from an intercourse, where the big belly is oftnest on the man's side? Would any persuade me that such a passion was natural, unless the human race were more fit for love as they approach'd the decline, and, like silk-worms, became breeders, just before they expired?"</P>
<P>Whether love be natural or no, replied my friend, gravely, it contributes to the happiness of every society into which it is introduced. All our plea∣sures are short, and can only charm at intervals: love is a method of protracting our greatest plea∣sure; and surely that gamester, who plays the great∣est stake to the best advantage, will at the end of life, rise victorious. This was the opinion of Va∣nini, who affirmed that <HI>every hour was lost which was not spent in love.</HI> His accusers were unable to comprehend his meaning, and the poor advocate for love was burned in flames, alas, no way meta∣phorical. But whatever advantages the individual may reap from this passion, society will certainly be refined and improved by its introduction: All laws, calculated to discourage it, tend to embrute the species, and weaken the state. Though it can∣not plant morals in the human breast, it cultivates them when there: pity, generosity, and honour, receive a brighter polish from its assistance; and a single amour is sufficient entirely to brush off the clown.</P>
<P>But it is an exotic of the most delicate consti∣tution; it requires the greatest art to introduce it
<PB N="208" REF="216"/>
into a state, and the smallest discouragement is sufficient to repress it again. Let us only consider with what ease it was formerly extinguished in Rome, and with what difficulty it was lately re∣vived in Europe: it seemed to sleep for ages, and at last fought its way among us through tilts, tour∣naments, dragons, and all the dreams of chivalry. The rest of the world, China only excepted, are and have ever been utter strangers to its delights and advantages. In other countries, as men find themselves stronger than women, they lay a claim to a rigorous superiority; this is natural, and love which gives up this natural advantage must cer∣tainly be the effect of art. An art calculated to lengthen out our happier moments, and add new graces to society.</P>
<P>I entirely acquiesce in your sentiments, says the lady, with regard to the advantages of this pas∣sion, but cannot avoid giving it a nobler origin than you have been pleased to assign. I must think, that those countries, where it is rejected, are obliged to have recourse to art to stifle so natural a production, and those nations, where it is cul∣tivated, only make nearer advances to nature. The same efforts, that are used in some places to suppress pity and other natural passions, may have been employed to extinguish love. No nation, however unpolished, is remarkable for innocence, that is not famous for passion; it has flourished in the coldest, as well as the warmest regions. Even in the sultry wilds of southern America, the lover is not satisfied with possessing his mistress's person without having her mind.

But the effects of love are too violent to be the re∣sult of an artificial passion. Nor is it in the power of fashion to force the constitution into those chan∣ges which we every day observe. Several have died of it. Few lovers are unacquainted with the fate of the two Italian lovers, Da Corsin and Julia Bella∣mano, who after a long separation expired with pleasure in each others arms. Such instances are too strong confirmations of the reality of the passion, and serve to shew that suppressing it, is but opposing the natural dictates of the heart.</P>

<P>THE clock just struck two, the expiring taper rises and sinks in the socket, the watchman forgets the hour in slumber, the laborious and the happy are at rest, and nothing wakes but medita∣tion, guilt, revelry and despair. The drunkard once more fills the destroying bowl, the robber walks his
<PB N="210" REF="218"/>
midnight round, and the suicide lifts his guilty arm against his own sacred person.</P>
<P>Let me no longer waste the night over the page of antiquity, or the sallies of cotemporary genius, but pursue the solitary walk, where vanity, ever changing, but a few hours past, walked before me, where she kept up the pageant, and now, like a froward child, seems hushed with her own importunities.</P>
<P>What a gloom hangs all around! the dying lamp feebly emits a yellow gleam, no sound is heard but of the chiming clock, or the distant watch-dog. All the bustle of human pride is forgotten, an hour like this may well display the emptiness of human vanity.</P>
<P>There will come a time when this temporary solitude may be made continual, and the city it∣self, like its inhabitants, fade away, and leave a desart in its room.</P>
<P>What cities, as great as this, have once tri∣umphed in existence, had their victories as great, joy as just, and as unbounded, and with short-sighted presumption, promised themselves immor∣tality. Posterity can hardly trace the situation of some. The sorrowful traveller wanders over the awful ruins of others; and as he beholds, he learns wisdom, and feels the transience of every sublunary possession.</P>
<P>Here, he cries, stood their citadel, now grown over with weeds; there their senate-house, but now the haunt of every noxious reptile; temples
<PB N="211" REF="219"/>
and theatres stood here, now only an undistinguish∣ed heap of ruin. They are fallen, for luxury and avarice first made them feeble. The rewards of state were conferred on amusing, and not on useful, members of society. Their riches and opulence invited the invaders, who, though at first repulsed, returned again, conquered by perseverance, and at last swept the defendants into undistinguished destruction.</P>
<P>How few appear in those streets, which but some few hours ago were crowded; and those who appear, now no longer wear their daily mask, nor attempt to hide their lewdness or their misery.</P>
<P>But who are those who make the streets their couch, and find a short repose from wretchedness at the doors of the oppulent? These are strangers, wanderers, and orphans, whose circumstances are too humble to expect redress, and whose distresses are too great even for pity. Their wretchedness ex∣cites rather horror than pity. Some are without the covering even of rags, and others emaciated with disease; the world has disclaimed them; society turns its back upon their distress, and has given them up to nakedness and hunger. These poor shivering females have once seen happier days, and been flattered into beauty. They have been prostituted to the gay luxurious villain, and are now turned out to meet the severity of winter. Perhaps, now lying at the doors of their betrayers, they sue to wretches whose hearts are insensible, or debauchees who may curse, but will not relieve them.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="220"/>Why, why was I born a man, and yet see the sufferings of wretches I cannot relieve! Poor houseless creatures! the world will give you re∣proaches, but will not give you relief. The slight∣est misfortunes of the great, the most imaginary uneasinesses of the rich, are aggravated with all the power of eloquence, and held up to engage our attention and sympathetic sorrow. The poor weep unheeded, persecuted by every subordinate species of tyranny; and every law, which gives others security, becomes an enemy to them.</P>
<P>Why was this heart of mine formed with so much sensibility! or why was not my fortune adapted to its impulse! Tenderness, without a capacity of relieving, only makes the man who feels it more wretched than the object which sues for assistance. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CXV.</HI> Fum Hoam to Lien Chi Altangi, the discontented wanderer, by the way of Moscow.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE been just sent upon an embassy to Ja∣pan; my commission is to be dispatched in f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur days, and you can hardly conceive the pleasure I shall find upon revisiting my native country. I shall leave with joy this proud, barbarous, inhos∣pitable region, where every object conspires to diminish my satisfaction, and encrease my pa∣triotism.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="221"/>But tho' I find the inhabitants savage, yet the Dutch merchants who are permitted to trade hi∣ther, seem still more detestable. They have raised my dislike to Europe in general; by them I learn how low avarice can degrade human nature; how many indignities an European will suffer for gain.</P>
<P>I was present at an audience given by the Em∣peror to the Dutch envoy, who had sent several presents to all the courtiers some days previous to his admission; but he was obliged to attend those designed for the Emperor himself. From the ac∣counts I had heard of this ceremony, my curiosity prompted me to be a spectator of the whole.</P>
<P>First went the pressents, set out on beautiful en∣amelled tables, adorned with flowers, borne on mens shoulders, and followed by Japonese music and dancers. From so great respect paid to the gifts themselves, I had fancied the donors must have received almost divine honours. But about a quar∣ter of an hour after the presents had been carried in triumph, the envoy and his train were brought forward. They were covered from head to foot with long black vails, which prevented their see∣ing, each led by a conductor, chosen from the meanest of the people. In this dishonourable manner having traversed the city of Jedo, they at length arrived at the palace gate, and after waiting half an hour, were admitted into the guard room. Here their eyes were uncovered, and in about an hour the gentleman usher intro∣duced them into the hall of audience. The Em∣peror was at length shewn sitting in a kind of Al∣cove at the upper end of the room, and the Dutch envoy was conducted towards the throne.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="222"/>As soon as he had approach'd within a certain distance, the gentleman usher cried out with a loud voice, <HI>Holanda Capitan</HI>; upon these words the envoy fell flat upon the ground, and crept upon his hands and feet towards the throne. Still ap∣proaching, he rear'd himself upon his knees, and then bowed his forehead to the ground. These ceremonies being over, he was directed to with∣draw, still groveling on his belly, and going back∣ward like a lobster.</P>
<P>Men must be excessively fond of riches, when they are earned with such circumstances of abject submission. Do the Europeans worship Heaven it self with marks of more profound respect? Do they confer those honours on the Supreme of be∣ings, which they pay to a barbarous king, who gives them a permission to purchase trinkets and porcelaine! What a glorious exchange, to forfeit their national honour, and even their title to hu∣manity, for a screen or a snuff-box!</P>
<P>If these ceremonies essayed in the first audience appeared mortifying, those which are practised in the second are infinitely more so. In the se∣cond audience, the Emperor and the ladies of court were placed behind lattices in such a man∣ner as to see without being seen. Here all the Europeans were directed to pass in review, and grovel and act the serpent as before: with this spectacle the whole court seemed highly delighted. The strangers were asked a thousand ridiculous questions; as their names, and their ages: They were ordered to write, to stand upright, to sit, to stop, to compliment each other, to be drunk, to speak the Japanese language, to talk
<PB N="215" REF="223"/>
Dutch, to sing, to eat; in short, they were or∣dered to do all that could satisfy the curiosity of women.</P>
<P>Imagine, my dear Altangi, a set of grave men thus transformed into buffoons, and acting a part every whit as honourable as that of those instruc∣ted animals which are shewn in the streets of Pe∣kin to the mob on a holiday. Yet the ceremony did not end here, for every great Lord of the court was to be visited in the same manner; and their ladies, who took the whim from their husbands, were all equally fond of seeing the strangers per∣form, even the children seeming highly diverted with the dancing Dutchmen.</P>
<P>Alas, cried I, to myself, upon returning from such a spectacle, is this the nation which assumes such dignity at the court of Pekin? Is this that people that appear so proud at home, and in every country where they have the least authority? How does a love of gain transform the gravest of man∣kind into the most contemptible and ridiculous? I had rather continue poor all my life, than be∣come rich at such a rate Perish those riches which are acquired at the expence of my honour or my humanity. Let me quit, said I, a country where there are none but such as treat all others like slaves, and more detestible still, in suffering such treatment. I have seen enough of this nation to desire to see more of others. Let me leave a people suspicious to excess, whose morals are cor∣rupted, and equally debased by superstition and vice; where the sciences are left uncultivated, where the Great are slaves to the Prince, and tyrants to the people, where the women are chaste
<PB N="216" REF="224"/>
only when debarred of the power of transgression; where the true disciples of Confucius are not less persecuted than those of Christianity: in a word, a country where men are forbidden to think, and consequently labour under the most miserable slavery, that of mental servitude.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CXVI.</HI> To the same.</HEAD>
<P>THE misfortunes of the great, my friend, are held up to engage our attention, are enlarged upon in tones of declamation, and the world is called upon to gaze at the noble sufferers; they have at once the comfort of admiration and pity.</P>
<P>Yet where is the magnanimity of bearing mis∣fortunes when the whole world is looking on? Men in such circumstances can act bravely even from motives of vanity. He only who, in the vale of obscurity, can brave adversity, who with∣out friends to encourage, acquaintances to pity, or even without hope to alleviate his distresses, can behave with tranquility and indifference, is truly great: whether peasant or courtier, he deserves admiration, and should be held up for our imita∣tion and respect.</P>
<P>The miseries of the poor are however entirely disregarded; tho' some undergo more real hard∣ships in one day, than the great in their whole lives. It is indeed inconceiveable what difficulties
<PB N="217" REF="225"/>
the meanest English sailor or soldier endures with∣out murmuring or regret. Every day is to him a day of misery, and yet he bears his hard fate without repining.</P>
<P>With what indignation do I hear the heroes of tragedy complain of misfortunes and hardships, whose greatest calamity is founded in arrogance and pride. Their severest distresses are pleasures, compared to what many of the adventuring poor every day sustain, without murmuring. These may eat, drink, and sleep, have slaves to attend them, and are sure of subsistence for life, while many of their fellow-creatures are obliged to wander, without a friend to comfort or to assist them, find enmity in every law, and are too poor to obtain even justice.</P>
<P>I have been led into these reflections from ac∣cidentally meeting some days ago a poor fellow begging at one of the outlets of this town, with a wooden leg. I was curious to learn what had reduced him to his present situation; and after giving him what I thought proper, desired to know the history of his life and misfortunes, and the manner in which he was reduced to his present distress. The disabled soldier, for such he was, with an intrepidity truly British, leaning on his crutch, put himself into an attitude to comply with my request, and gave me his history as follows:</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>As for misfortunes, Sir, I can't pretend to have gone through more than others. Except the loss of my limb, and my being obliged to beg, I don't know any reason, thank heaven, that I have to complain: there are some who have lost
<PB N="218" REF="226"/>
both legs, and an eye; but, thank heaven, it is not quite so bad with me.</P><P>My father was a labourer in the country, and died when I was five years old; so I was put upon the parish. As he had been a wandering sort of a man, the parishioners were not able to tell to what parish I belonged, or where I was born; so they sent me to another parish, and that parish sent me to a third; till at last it was thought I belonged to no parish at all. At length, however, they fixed me. I had some disposition to be a scholar, and had actually learned my letters; but the master of the work∣house put me to business as soon as I was able to handle a mallet.</P>
<P>Here I lived an easy kind of a life for five years. I only wrought ten hours in the day, and had my meat and drink provided for my labour. It is true, I was not suffered to stir far from the house, for fear I should run away: but what of that, I had the liberty of the whole house, and the yard before the door, and that was enough for me.</P>
<P>I was next bound out to a farmer, where I was up both early and late, but I ate and drank well, and liked my business well enough, till he died. Being then obliged to provide for myself, I was resolved to go and seek my fortune. Thus I lived, and went from town to town, working when I could get employment, and starving when I could get none, and might have lived so still: But happening one day to go through a field belonging to a magistrate, I spy'd a hare crossing
<PB N="219" REF="227"/>
the path just before me. I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my stick at it: well, what will you have on't? I killed the hare, and was bringing it away in triumph, when the jus∣tice himself met me: he called me a villain, and collaring me, desired I would give an account of myself. I began immediately to give a full ac∣count of all that I knew of my breed, seed, and generation: but though I gave a very long ac∣count, the justice said, I could give no account of myself; so I was indicted, and found guilty of being poor, and sent to Newgate, in order to be transported to the plantations.</P><P>People may say this and that of being in jail; but for my part, I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in, in all my life. I had my belly full to eat and drink, and did no work; but alas, this kind of life was too good to last for ever! I was taken out of prison, after five months, put on board of a ship, and sent off with two hundred more. Our passage was but indif∣ferent, for we were all confined in the hold, and died very fast, for want of sweet air and provi∣sions; but for my part, I did not want meat, because I had a fever all the way: providence was kind, when provisions grew short, it took away my desire of eating. When we came ashore, we were sold to the planters. I was bound for seven years, and as I was no scholar, for I had forgot my letters, I was obliged to work among the negroes; and served out my time, as in duty bound to do.</P><P>When my time was expired, I worked my pas∣sage home, and glad I was to see Old England
<PB N="220" REF="228"/>
again, because I loved my country. O liberty, liberty, liberty! that is the property of every En∣glishman, and I will die in its defence: I was afraid, however, that I should be indicted for a vagabond once more, so did not much care to go into the country, but kept about town, and did little jobs when I could get them. I was very happy in this manner for some time; till one evening, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then desired me to stand still. They belonged to a press-gang; I was carried before the justice, and as I could give no account of my self, (that was the thing that al∣ways hobbled me,) I had my choice left, whether to go on board a man of war, or list for a sol∣dier. I chose to be a soldier; and in this post of a gentleman I served two campaigns, was at the battles in Flanders, and received but one wound through the breast, which is troublesome to this day.</P><P>When the peace came on, I was discharged; and as I could not work, because my wound was sometimes painful, I listed for a landman in the East India company's service. I here fought the French in six pitched battles; and verily be∣lieve, that if I could read or write, our captain would have given me promotion, and made me a corporal. But that was not my good fortune, I soon fell sick, and when I became good for nothing, got leave to return home a∣gain with forty pounds in my pocket, which I saved in the service. This was at the beginning of the present war, so I hoped to be set on shore, and to have the pleasure of spending my money; but the government wanted men, and I was
<PB N="221" REF="229"/>
pressed again, before ever I could set foot on shore.</P><P>The boatswain found me, as he said, an ob∣stinate fellow: he swore that I understood my business perfectly well, but that I pretended sick∣ness merely to be idle: God knows, I knew nothing of sea-business: He beat me with∣out considering what he was about. But still my forty pounds, was some comfort to me un∣der every beating; the money was my comfort, and the money I might have had to this day; but that our ship was taken by the French, and so I lost it all!</P><P>Our crew was carried into a French prison, and many of them died, because they were not used to live in a jail; but for my part it was nothing to me, for I was seasoned. One night however, as I was sleeping on the bed of boards, with a warm blanket about me, (for I always lov∣ed to lie well,) I was awaked by the boatswain, who had a dark lanthorn in his hand. 'Jack, says he to me, will you knock out the French centry's brains?' 'I don't care, says I, striving to keep myself awake, if I lend a hand.' 'Then follow me, says he, and I hope we shall do business.' So up I got, and tied my blanket, which was all the cloaths I had, about my mid∣dle, and went with him to fight the Frenchmen: we had no arms; but one Englishman is able to beat five French at any time; so we went down to the door, where both the centries were posted, and rushing upon them, seized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down. From thence, nine of us ran together to the
<PB N="222" REF="230"/>
key, and seizing the first boat we met, got out of the harbour, and put to sea: we had not been here three days before we were taken up by an English privateer, who was glad of so many good hands; and we consented to run our chance. However, we had not so much luck as we expected. In three days we fell in with a French man of war, of forty guns, while we bad but twenty three; so to it we went. The fight lasted for three hours, and I verily believe we should have taken the Frenchman, but un∣fortunately, we lost almost all our men, just as we were going to get the victory. I was once more in the power of the French, and I believe it would have gone hard with me, had I been brought back to my old jail in Brest: but by good fortune, we were re-taken, and carried to England once more.</P><P>I had almost forgot to tell you, that in this last engagement I was wounded in two places; I lost four fingers of the left hand, and my leg was shot off. Had I the good fortune to have lost my leg and use of my hand on board a king's ship, and not a privateer, I should have been entitled to cloathing and maintenance dur∣ing the rest of my life, but that was not my chance; one man is born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and another with a wooden ladle. However, blessed be God, I enjoy good health, and have no enemy in this world that I know of, but the French, and the Justice of Peace.</P></Q>
<P>Thus saying, he limped off, leaving my friend and me in admiration of his intrepidity and con∣tent; nor could we avoid acknowledging, that an habitual acquaintance with misery, is the truest school of fortitude and philosophy. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CXVI.</HI> From the same.</HEAD>
<P>THE titles of European Princes are rather more numerous than ours of Asia, but by no means so sublime. The king of Visapour or Pegu, not satisfied with claiming the globe and all its appurtenances to him and his heirs, asserts a pro∣perty even in the firmament, and extends his or∣ders to the milky way. The monarchs of Europe, with more modesty, confine their titles to earth, but make up by number, what is wanting in their sublimity. Such is their passion for a long list of these splendid trifles, that I have known a Ger∣man Prince with more titles than subjects, and a Spanish nobleman with more names than shirts.</P>
<P>Contrary to this, "The English monarchs, says a writer of the last century, disdain to accept of such titles, which tend only to encrease their pride, without improving their glory; they are above depending on the feeble helps of heraldry for respect, perfectly satisfied with the conscious∣ness of acknowledged power." At present, how∣ever, these maxims are laid aside; the English monarchs have of late assumed new titles, and have impressed their coins with the names and arms of obscure dukedoms, petty states, and sub∣ordinate employments. Their design in this, I make no doubt, was laudably to add new lustre to the British throne, but in reality paltry claims only serve to diminish that respect they are designed to secure.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="232"/>There is in the honours assumed by Kings, as in the decorations of architecture, a majestic simplicity, which best conduces to inspire our reverence and respect; numerous and trifling or∣naments in either, are strong indications of mean∣ness in the designer, or of concealed deformity: should, for instance, the Emperor of China, a∣mong other titles, assume that of Deputy Manda∣rin of Maccau, or the Monarch of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, desire to be acknowledged as Duke of Brentford, Lunenburg, or Lincoln, the observer revolts at this mixture of important and paltry claims, and forgets the Emperor in his familiarity with the Duke or the Deputy.</P>
<P>I remember a similar instance of this inverted ambition, in the illustrious King of Manacabo, upon his first treaty with the Portuguese. Among the presents that were made him by the ambas∣sador of that nation, was a sword, with a brass hilt, which he seemed to set a peculiar value upon. This he thought too great an acquisition to his glory, to be forgotten among the number of his titles. He therefore gave orders, that his sub∣jects should style him for the future, <HI>Talipot, the immortal Potentate of Manacabo, Messenger of Morning, Enlightener of the Sun, Possessor of the the whole Earth, and mighty Monarch of the Brass-handled Sword.</HI></P>
<P>This method of mixing majestic and paltry ti∣tles, of quartering the arms of a great Empire, and an obscure province, upon the same medal here, had its rise in the virtuous partiality of their late Monarchs. Willing to testify an affection to their native country, they gave its name and ensigns a
<PB N="225" REF="233"/>
place upon their coins, and thus in some measure enobled its obscurity. It was indeed but just, that a people which had given England up their King, should receive some honorary equivalent in return; but at present these motives are no more; England has now a Monarch wholly British, and it has some reason to hope for British titles upon British coins.</P>
<P>However, were the money of England designed to circulate in Germany, there would be no fla∣grant impropriety in impressing it with German names and arms; but though this might have been so upon former occasions, I am told there is no danger of it for the future; as England therefore designs to keep back its gold, I candidly think Lunenburg, Oldenburgh, and the rest of them, may very well keep back their titles.</P>
<P>It is a mistaken prejudice in Princes, to think that a number of loud sounding names can give new claims to respect. The truly great have ever disdained them: When Timur the Lame had conquered Asia, an orator by profession came to compliment him upon the occasion. He began his harrangue, by styling him the most omnipo∣tent, and the most glorious object of the creation; the Emperor seemed displeased with his paltry adulation, yet still he went on, complimenting him, as the most mighty, the most valiant, and the most perfect of beings: Hold there, my friend, cries the lame Emperor; hold there, till I have got another leg. In fact, the feeble or the despotic alone find pleasure in multiplying these pageants of va∣nity, but strength and freedom have nobler aims,
<PB N="226" REF="234"/>
and often find the finest adulation in majestic sim∣plicity.</P>
<P>The young Monarch of this country has al∣ready testified a proper contempt for several un∣meaning appendages on royalty; cooks and scul∣lions have been obliged to quit their fires; gentle∣mens gentlemen, and the whole tribe of <HI>necessary people,</HI> who did nothing, have been dismissed from further services. A youth, who can thus bring back simplicity and frugality to a court, will soon probably have a true respect for his own glory, and while he has dismissed all useless employments, may disdain to accept of empty or degrading titles. Adieu.</P>

<P>WHENEVER I attempt to characterize the English in general; some unforeseen difficul∣ties constantly occur to disconcert my design; I hesitate between censure and praise: when I con∣sider them as a reasoning philosophical people, they have my applause; but when I reverse the medal, and observe their inconstancy and irreso∣lution, I can scarcely persuade my self that I am observing the same people.</P>
<P>Yet upon examination this very inconstancy, so remarkable here, flows from no other source than
<PB N="227" REF="235"/>
their love of reasoning. The man who examines a complicated subject on every side, and calls in reason to his assistance, will frequently change; will find himself distracted by opposing proba∣bilities and contending proofs: every alteration of place will diversify the prospect, will give some latent argument new force, aad contribute to maintain an anarchy in the mind.</P>
<P>On the contrary, they who never examine with their own reason, act with more simplicity. Igno∣nance is positive, instinct perseveres, and the human being moves in safety within the narrow circle of brutal uniformity. What is true with regard to individuals, is not less so when applied to states A reasoning government like this, is in continual fluctuation, while those kingdoms where men are taught not to controvert but obey, continue always the same. In Asia, for instance, where the monarch's authority is supported by force, and acknowledged through fear, a change of government is entirely unknown. All the in∣habitants seem to wear the same mental complec∣tion, and remain contented with hereditary op∣pression. The sovereign's pleasure is the ultimate rule of duty, every branch of the administration is a perfect epitome of the whole; and if one tyrant is deposed, another starts up in his room to govern as his predecessor. The English, on the contrary, instead of being led by power, en∣deavour to guide themselves by reason; instead of appealing to the pleasure of the prince, appeal to the original rights of mankind. What one rank of men assert is denied by others, as the reasons on opposite sides happen to come home with great∣er
<PB N="228" REF="236"/>
or less conviction. The people of Asia are directed by precedent, which never alters; the English by reason, which is ever changing its ap∣pearance.</P>
<P>The disadvantages of an Asiatic government ac∣ting in this manner by precedent are evident; ori∣ginal errors are thus continued, without hopes of redress, and all marks of genius are levelled down to one standard, since no superiority of thinking can be allowed its exertion in mending obvious defects. But to recompence those defects, their governments undergo no new alterations, they have no new evils to fear, nor no fermentations in the constitution that continue: the struggle for power is soon over, and all becomes tranquil as before; they are habituated to subordination, and men are taught to form no other desires, than those which they are allowed to satisfy.</P>
<P>The disadvantages of a government acting from the immediate influence of reason, like that of England, are not less than those of the former. It is extremely difficult to induce a number of free beings to co-operate for their mutual benefit; every possible advantage will necessarily be sought, and every attempt to procure it must be attended with a new fermentation; various reasons will lead different ways, and equity and advantage will often be out-ballanced by a combination of cla∣mour and prejudice. But though such a people may be thus in the wrong, they have been influ∣enced by an happy delusion, their errors are sel∣dom seen till they are felt; each man is him∣self the tyrant he has obeyed, and such a master he can easily forgive. The disadvantages he feels
<PB N="229" REF="237"/>
may in reality be equal to what is felt in the most despotic government; but man will bear every calamity with patience, when he knows himself to be the author of his own misfortunes. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CXVIII.</HI> From the same.</HEAD>
<P>MY long residence here begins to fatigue me, as every object ceases to be new, it no longer continues to be pleasing; some minds are so fond of variety that pleasure it self, if permanent, would be insupportable, and we are thus obliged to solicit new happiness even by courting distress: I only therefore wait the arrival of my son to vary this trifling scene, and borrow new pleasure from danger and fatigue. A life, I own, thus spent in wandring from place to place, is at best but empty dissipation. But to pursue trifles is the lot of humanity; and whether we bustle in a pantomime, or strut at a coronation; whether we shout at a bonefire, or harrangue in a senate-house; whatever object we follow, it will at last surely conduct us to futility and disappoint∣ment. The wise bustle and laugh as they walk in the pageant, but fools bustle and are im∣portant; and this probably is all the difference be∣tween them.</P>
<P>This may be an apology for the levity of my for∣mer correspondence; I talked of trifles, and I knew that they were trifles; to make the things of this life ridiculous, it was only sufficient to call them by their names.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="238"/>In other respects, I have omitted several stri∣king circumstances in the description of this country, as supposing them either already known to you, or as not being thoroughly known to myself: But there is one omission for which I expect no forgiveness, namely, my being totally silent upon their buildings, roads, rivers, and mountains. This is a branch of science on which all other travellers are so very prolix, that my de∣ficiency will appear the more glaring. With what pleasure, for instance, do some read of a travel∣ler in Egypt, measuring a fallen column with his cane, and finding it exactly five feet nine inches long; of his creeping through the mouth of a catacomb, and coming out by a different hole from that he entered; of his stealing the finger of an antique statue, in spite of the janizary that watch'd him; or his adding a new conjec∣ture to the hundred and fourteen conjectures already published, upon the names of <HI>Osu is</HI> and <HI>Isis.</HI></P>
<P>Methinks I hear some of my friends in China de∣manding a similar account of London and the adja∣cent villages; and if I remain here much longer, it is probable I may gratify their curiosity. I intend, when run dry on other topics, to take a serious survey of the City-wall; to describe that beauti∣ful building the Mansion-House; I will enume∣rate the magnificent squares, in which the nobility chiefly reside, and the Royal Palaces appointed for the reception of the English Monarch; nor will I forget the beauties of Shoe-Lane, in which I my self have resided since my arrival. You shall find me no way inferior to many of my bro∣ther travellers in the arts of description. At pre∣sent,

however as a specimen of this way of wri∣ting, I send you a few hasty remarks, collected in a late journey I made to Kentish Town, <HI>and this in the manner of modern voyagers.</HI></P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>Having heard much of Kentish Town, I con∣ceived a strong desire to see that celebrated place. I could have wish'd indeed to satisfy my curiosity without going thither; but that was impracticable, and therefore I resolved to go. Travellers have two methods of going to Kentish Town; they take coach which costs nine pence, or they may go a foot which costs nothing; in my opinion, a coach is by far the most eligible convenience, but I was resolved to go on foot, having considered with my self, that going in that manner would be the cheapest way.</P><P>As you set out from Dog-house bar, you enter upon a fine level road railed in on both sides, commanding on the right a fine prospect of groves, and fields, enamelled with flowers, which would wonderfully charm the sense of smelling, were it not for a dunghill on the left, which mixes its effluvia with their odours: This dunghill is of much greater antiquity than the road; and I must not omit a piece of injustice I was going to commit upon this occasion. My indignation was levelled against the makers of the dunghill for having brought it so near the road; whereas it should have fallen upon the makers of the road for having brought that so near the dunghill.</P><P>After proceeding in this manner for some time, a building resembling somewhat a triumphal arch salutes the traveller's view. This structure how∣ever
<PB N="232" REF="240"/>
is peculiar to this country, and vulgarly call'd a turnpike gate: I could perceive a long inscription in large characters on the front, proba∣bly upon the occasion of some triumph, but being in haste I left it to be made out by some subse∣quent adventurer who may happen to travel this way; so continuing my course to the west, I soon arrived at an unwalled town called Islington.</P><P>Islington is a pretty neat town, mostly built of brick, with a church and bells: It has a small lake, or rather pond in the midst; tho' at present very much neglected. I am told it is dry in sum∣mer; if this be the case, it can be no very proper receptacle for fish, of which the inhabitants them∣selves seem sensible, by bringing all that is eaten there from London.</P><P>After having surveyed the curiosities of this fair and beautiful town I proceeded forward, leaving a fair stone building called the White Conduit House on my right: here the inhabitants of London often assemble to celebrate a feast of hot rolls and butter; seeing such numbers, each with their little tables before them, employed on this occasion, must no doubt be a very amusing sight to the looker on, but still more so to those who perform in the solemnity.</P><P>From hence I parted with reluctance to <HI>Pan∣crass,</HI> as it is written, or <HI>Pancridge</HI> as it is pro∣nounced; but which should be both pronounced and written <HI>Pangrace:</HI> This emendation I will venture meo arbitrio: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the Greek lan∣guage
<PB N="233" REF="241"/>
signifies all, which added to the English word <HI>grace,</HI> maketh <HI>all grace,</HI> or <HI>Pangrace;</HI> and indeed this is a very proper appellation to a place of so much sanctity as Pangrace is universally es∣teemed. However this be, if you except the parish church and its fine bells, there is little in Pangrace worth the attention of the curious observer.</P><P>From Pangrace to Kentish town is an easy journey of one mile and a quarter: The road lies through a fine champain country, well watered with beautiful drains, and enamelled with flowers of all kinds, which might contribute to charm every sense, were it not that the odoriferous gales are often more impregnated with dust than perfume.</P><P>As you enter Kentish town, the eye is at once presented with the shops of artificers, such as venders of candles, small-coal, and hair brooms; there are also several august buildings of red brick, with numberless sign-posts, or rather pillars, in a peculiar order of architecture; I send you a drawing of several, vide A. B. C. This pretty town probably borrows its name from its vicinity to the county of Kent: And indeed it is not un∣natural that it should, as there are only London and the adjacent villages that lie between them. Be this as it will, perceiving night approach I made a hasty repast on roasted mutton, and a cer∣tain dried fruit called potatoes, resolving to pro∣tract my remarks upon my return: And this I would very willingly have done; but was pre∣vented by a circumstance which in truth I had for some time foreseen, for night coming
<PB N="234" REF="242"/>
on, it was impossible to take a proper survey of the country, as I was obliged to return home in the dark.</P></Q>
<P>Adieu.</P>

<DIV1 N="119" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD><HI>LETTER CXIX.</HI> To the same.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a variety of disapointments, my wishes are at length fully satisfied. My son so long expected is arrived, at once, by his presence banishing my anxiety, and opening a new scene of unexpected pleasure. His improvements in mind and person have far surpass'd even the san∣guine expectations of a father. I left him a boy, but he is returned a man; pleasing in his person, hardened by travel, and polished by ad∣versity. His disappointment in love, however, had infused an air of melancholy into his conversation, which seemed at intervals to interrupt our mu∣tual satisfaction. I expected that this could find a cure only from time; but fortune, as if wil∣ling to load us with her favours, has in a mo∣ment repaid every uneasiness with rapture.</P>
<P>Two days after his arrival, the man in black with his beautiful niece, came to congratulate us upon this pleasing occasion: but, guess our sur∣prize, when my friend's lovely kinswoman was found to be the very captive my son had rescued from Persia, and who had been wreck'd on the Wolga, and was carried by the Russian pea∣sants
<PB N="235" REF="243"/>
to the port of Archangel. Were I to hold the pen of a novelist, I might be prolix in de∣scribing their feelings, at so unexpected an in∣terview; but you may conceive their joy, with∣out my assistance, words were unable to express their transports, then how can words describe it?</P>
<P>When two young persons are sincerely ena∣moured of each other, nothing can give me such pleasure as seeing them married: whether I know the parties or not, I am happy at thus binding one link more in the universal chain. Nature has, in some measure, formed me for a match-maker, and given me a soul to sympathize with every mode of human felicity. I instantly therefore con∣sulted the man in black, whether we might not crown their mutual wishes by marriage; his soul seems formed of similar materials with mine, he instantly gave his consent, and the next day was appointed for the solemnization of their nuptials.</P>
<P>All the acquaintances which I had made since my arrival, were present at this gay solemnity. The little beau was constituted master of the ceremonies, and his wife Mrs. Tibbs conducted the entertainment with proper decorum. The man in black and the pawn-broker's widow, were very sprightly and tender upon this occasion. The widow was dressed up under the direction of Mrs. Tibbs; and as for her lover, his face was set off by the assistance of a pig-tail wig, which was lent by the little beau, to fit him for making love with proper formality. The whole company easily perceived, that it would be a double wedding before all was over, and indeed
<PB N="236" REF="244"/>
my friend and the widow seemed to make no se∣cret of their passion; he even called me aside, in order to know my candid opinion, whether I did not think him a little too old to be married. As for my own part, continued he, I know I am go∣ing to play the fool, but all my friends will praise my wisdom, and produce me as the very pattern of discretion to others.</P>
<P>At dinner, every thing seemed to run on with good humour, harmony, and satisfaction. Every creature in company thought themselves pretty, and every jest was laught at: the man in black sat next his mistress, helped her plate, chimed her glass, and jogging her knees and her elbow, he whispered something arch in her ear, on which she patted his cheek; never was antiquated passion so playful, so harmless, and amusing, as between this reverend couple.</P>
<P>The second course was now called for, and among a variety of other Dishes, a fine turkey was placed before the widow. The Europeans, you know, carve as they eat; my friend therefore begged his mistress to help him to a part of the turkey. The widow, pleased with an opportu∣nity of shewing her skill in carving; an art, upon which it seems, she picqued herself; began to cut it up by first taking off the leg. <HI>Madam,</HI> cries my friend, <HI>if I might be permitted to adv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, I would begin by cutting off the wing, and then the Leg will come off more easily.</HI> Sir, replies the widow, give me leave to understand cutting up a fowl, I always begin with the leg. <HI>Yes Madam,</HI> re∣plies the lover, <HI>but if the wing be the most convenient
<PB N="237" REF="245"/>
manner, I would begin with the wing.</HI> Sir, inter∣rupts the lady, when you have fowls of your own, begin with the wing if you please; but give me leave to take off the leg, I hope I am not to be taught at this time of day. <HI>Madam,</HI> interrupts he, <HI>we are never too old to be instructed.</HI> Old, Sir! interrupts the other, who is old, Sir? when I die of age, I know of some that will quake for fear; if the leg does not come off, take the turkey to your∣self. <HI>Madam,</HI> replied the man in black, <HI>I don't care a farthing whether the leg or the wing comes off; if you are for the leg first, why you shall have the argument, even though it be as I say.</HI> As for the matter of that, cries the widow, I don't care a fig, whether you are for the leg off, or on; and friend, for the future keep your dis∣tance. <HI>O,</HI> replied the other, <HI>that is easily done, it is only removing to the other end of the table, and so, madam, your most obedient humble servant.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, was this courtship of an age destroyed in one moment; for this dialogue effectually broke off the match between this respectable couple, that had been but just concluded. The smallest accidents disappoint the most important treaties: However, though it in some measure interrupted the general satisfaction, it no ways lessened the happiness of the youthful couple; and by the young lady's looks I could perceive, she was not entirely dis∣pleased with this interruption.</P>
<P>In a few hours the whole transaction seemed entirely forgotten, and we have all since, enjoyed those satisfactions which result from a conscious∣ness of making each other happy. My son and
<PB N="238" REF="246"/>
his fair partner are fixed here for life; the man in black, has given them up a small estate in the country, which added to what I was able to bestow, will be capable of supplying all the real, but not the fictitious demands of happiness. As for myself, the world being but one city to me, I don't much care in which of the streets I happen to reside; I shall therefore spend the re∣mainder of life, in examining the manners of dif∣ferent countries, and have prevailed upon the man in black to be my companion. <HI>They must often change, says</HI> Confucius, <HI>who would be constant in happiness or wisdom.</HI> Adieu.</P>
