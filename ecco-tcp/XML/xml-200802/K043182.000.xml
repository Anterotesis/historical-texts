<P>JASON; A TRAGEDY, <HI>IN FIVE ACTS.</HI> BY R. GLOVER, ESQ. AUTHOR OF "LEONIDAS, AN EPIC POEM."</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Tragedy, which is now of∣fered to the Public from the pen of RICHARD GLOVER, Esq. Author of LEONIDAS, is a Sequel to the MEDEA, which has been per∣formed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, with the greatest applause. This Piece was presented by him, many years previous to his death, to the celebrated Mrs. Yates, who passed the highest encomiums upon it; but owing to the grandeur of the scenery, and the expense required to bring it forward, it was altogether laid aside; and it has since that period been offered to the Managers of both Theatres, who still have the same objection. It is therefore only necessary to add, that the Public, well knowing the Author's talents, have it in their power to judge of its merits or defects.</P>

<P>TRAVELS in UPPER and LOWER EGYPT; per∣formed by Order and at the Expense of Lewis the Sixteenth, in 1776, 1777, and 1778. Comprehending the most important Observations and interesting Discove∣ries made in the Course of the Journey. Faithfully translated from the French of C. S. SONNINI, an Officer of Engineers in the French Navy; Member of several learned Academies in Europe, and assistant Contributor to Buffon, in the Ornithological Department of his Natural History.—Illustrated with a Map of Egypt, Portraits of the Author and of Murat Bey, and several other Engrav∣ings, representing Picturesque Views, Antiquities, Natural History, &amp;c. &amp;c. from Drawings taken on the Spot, un∣der the immediate Inspection of the Author, and en∣graved by Landseer, Milton, Anker Smith, Watts, and the first Artists in the various Departments. With a Pre∣face by the Translator, comprehending an authentic and interesting Account of the Trade to the Levant.—Ele∣gantly printed uniformly to bind with Park's and Brown's Travels in Africa, on fine wove paper, hot-pressed, in one large volume quarto.</P>
<P>A COLLECTION of STATE PAPERS relative to the War against France, now carrying on by Great Bri∣tain and the several other European Powers. Containing authentic Copies of Treaties, Conventions, Proclama∣tions, Manifestoes, Declarations, Memorials, Remon∣strances, Official Letters, Parliamentary Papers, London Gazette Accounts of the War, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. many of which have never before been published in England.—Printed uniformly to bind with the Parliamentary De∣bates. In 7 volumes. 3l. 11s. 6d. boards.</P>
<P>OBSERVATIONS on the STATE of the CONTI∣NENT, should France be suffered to retain her immense Acquisitions. In which are reviewed her whole System of Aggrandizement, and the probable Advantages she will derive from the Subversion of Italy and the Possession of Belgium on the Return of Peace. 3s. 6d.</P>
<P>"This useful and interesting publication, in the form of letters, is well timed and well directed. The writer examines, in detail, the conduct of the French from the time of the revolution, and states, that the accumu∣lation of their possessions increases the andacity, and confirms the power of their rulers; and that Englishmen have no resource against their insolence, but to prosecute the war with vigour."<HI>—British Critic, March</HI> 1799.</P>
<P><PB REF="86"/>
A VOCABULARY of SEA-PHRASES and TERMS of ART used in Seamanship and Naval Architecture, in 2 Parts: 1. English and French—2. French and Eng∣lish. Carefully collected from the best Authorities, written and oral, aided by a long and intimate Acquaint∣ance with the nautical Language of both Countries; and containing all the Orders necessary for working a Ship, and carrying on the Duty on board, as well at Sea as in Port. By a Captain of the British Navy. Dedicated, by Permission, to Earl Spencer, K. G. First Lord of the Admiralty, &amp;c. 2 vols. 8s.</P>
<P>VARIETIES of LITERATURE, from foreign Li∣terary Journals and original MSS. now first published, in 2 large volumes 8 vo. 15s.</P>
<P>"This is, in many respects, a very agreeable Miscel∣lany. The undertaking is also a novel one, and will probably be repeated, as the German language is becom∣ing every day more and more an object of attention in this country, and as it is well known that the German Journals contain very interesting and important matter. This collection is completely a miscellany, as the Com∣piler and Translator appears to have had in general no ob∣ject in view except that of placing before his readers an entertaining variety. It must indeed be a fastidious taste, which may not in its progress through these volumes find some of the viands it approves."<HI>—British Critic, Jan.</HI> 1796.</P>
<P>SELECTIONS from the most celebrated Foreign Journals and other Periodical Publications. 2 vols. 16s. boards.</P>
<P>"These Selections, made with judgment, and trans∣lated with fidelity, are on the same plan with that interest∣ing work the Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieties of Literature. These two vo∣lumes of Selections consist chiefly in the papers of Pro∣fessor M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ners, which are various, instructive, learned, and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensed; in the account by Jagemann of the state of commerce, arts, and science, in Tuscany, which is well digested; and in the historic dissertations concerning Russia by Schloetzer, whose erudition and good sense are alike prominent."<HI>—Monthly Rev. July</HI> 1798.</P>
<P>LIFE of CATHARINE II. Empress of Russia; an enlarged Translation from the French, by a Gentleman many Years resident at St. Petersburgh; with seven Por∣traits, viz.—1. The Empress Catharine. 2. Peter III. 3. Emperor Paul. 4. Stanislaus, King of Poland. 5. Princess Daschkoff. 6. Prince Potemkin. 7. Prince Or∣loff;
<PB REF="87"/>
and a correct Map of the Russian Empire. A new edition. 3 vols. 1l. 4s.</P>
<P>VIEW of the RUSSIAN EMPIRE during the Reign of Catharine the Second, and to the Close of the present Century, &amp;c. &amp;c. Containing an accurate De∣scription of the Government, Manners, Customs, Reli∣gion, Extent, Boundaries, Soil, Climate, Produce, Re∣venue, Trade, Manufactures, &amp;c. &amp;c. of the several Nations that compose that extensive Empire. By WIL∣LIAM TOOKE, F. R. S. Member of the Imperial Aca∣demy of Sciences, and of the Free Economical Society at St. Petersburgh. Illustrated with a Map of Russia. In 3 large vols. Il. 7s. boards.</P>
<P>MEMOIRES sur la Vie et le Caractere de Madame la Duchesse de Polignac. Avec des Anecdotes interes∣santes sur la Revolution Francaise, et sur la Personne de Marie Antoinette, Reine de France. Ecrite par Madame la Comtesse Diane de Polignac. 2s. 6d.</P>
<P>"This little work might be put with advantage into the hands of young ladies who are learning the French language. The interest their sensible hearts must take in the narrative, would animate and alleviate the troubles of overcoming the difficulties of the lesson; and they would contemplate more than one or two of the most noble mo∣dels or examples of female excellence."<HI>—English Review, Jan.</HI> 1706.</P>
<P>MATERNAL LETTERS to a Young Lady, on her Entrance into Life. 2s.</P>
<P>"These Letters contain much wholesome advice on religious, moral, and prudential subjects, expressed in un∣affected language; and they are very proper to be put into the hands of young females when they leave the boarding-school, to correct the false notions which they are too apt to gather there, and to prepare them for filling, with credit and advantage, the most important of all female re∣lations, those of a Wife and a Mother."<HI>—Monthly Re∣view, Dec.</HI> 1795.</P>
<P>The WORKS of JOHN HALL STEVENSON, Esq. Containing Crazy Tales, Fables for Grown Gentlemen, Lyric Epistles, Pastoral Cordial, Pastoral Puke, Macarony Fables, Lyric Consolations, Moral Tales, Monkish Epi∣taphs, Essay on the King's Friends, &amp;c. &amp;c. Including several Poems now first printed from the original MSS. with Notes, and a Preface by the Editor: illustrated with a view of Crazy Castle, and the Constellation, engraved by Milton; elegantly printed in 3 volumes, small 8 vo. 15s. boards.</P>
