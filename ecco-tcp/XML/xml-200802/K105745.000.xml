<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE former Part of this Trea∣tise
has been censur'd for two
Faults; first for being obscure;
secondly, for not being so practi∣cal
as it ought to be: As to the
First, I answer, That <HI>Obscurity</HI> may be
taken in two Senses, as Real, or as Relative
to the Understanding of the Reader; if
Obscurity is taken in the first Sense, I will
venture to affirm, That it is unjustly blam'd
upon that Account: Perhaps it may not be
all true, but I am sure it is intelligible. If
Obscurity is taken in the second Sense, <HI>Eu∣clid</HI>'s
Elements may be said to be obscure:
I freely own that I had made too partial a
Judgment of the Capacity of several of my
Readers; and yet it is true, That many, not
bred up in the Profession of Physick, under∣stood
the Whole; many, a great Part of it;
<PB REF="4"/>
and it was not possible to write it down to the
Capacity of every Body.</P>
<P>The second Fault, of its not being suffi∣ciently
practical, I have endeavour'd to re∣pair,
by the Addition of this Second Part,
which I was oblig'd to write in haste, when
the Distress both of my Mind and Body, be∣sides
Business, render'd me very unfit for
such an Undertaking: All I can say for it
is, That tho' it be less accurate, it may per∣haps
be more useful than the first, it being
much such a Work as an Almanack, of pub∣lick
Benefit, but from which no body I be∣lieve
ever propos'd any Reputation. It is a
Collection of the scattered Precepts of the
First Part, and other new Rules, extended
to the most common Diseases as well as Con∣stitutions
of Human Bodies. I have still
follow'd the Method of the learned and in∣dustrious
<HI>Boerhaave,</HI> who has certainly stu∣died
and taught this Part of the Profession
more than any that ever were before him.</P>
<P>I cannot think it trifling nor unnecessary
to treat this Dietetick Part of Medicine
by it self with some Accuracy, for the fol∣lowing
Reasons: <HI>First,</HI> Because the Parts
of any Art or Science are often best under∣stood
when they are treated separately: <HI>Se∣condly,</HI>
Because the Practitioners in Phy∣sick
and Chirurgery are often frustrated in
their Intentions by Errors in Diet com∣mitted
<PB REF="5"/>
by their Patients, a Misfortune that
I my self have felt several times, and, as I
suppose, in common with others of the Pro∣fession.
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> Because some practical
Rules of this sort may be useful to such as
are remote from good Advice; and likewise
to some coarse Practitioners which they are
obliged to make use of: By the Methods
prescrib'd in this short Treatise, which are
almost within the Reach of every Body, more
Good and less Mischief will be done in acute
Distempers, than by Medicines improperly and
unseasonably administred; and great Cures
may be effected in Chronical Distempers, by
a proper Regimen of the Diet. I hope I
have done with this Subject. I was drawn
in to write the First Part by Accident, and
to write the Second by some Defects in the
First; these are the cumbersome Perquisites
of Authors.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the different Qualities and Effects
of ALIMENTARY SUBSTANCES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>1. Alimentary Substances, austere and
astringent.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>USTERE, astringent, ve∣getable
Substances,</HI> are such
as contain an acid essential
Salt, combin'd with Earth,
and very little Oil; as,</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="10"/>
Several sorts of <HI>Plumbs,</HI> and some
sorts of <HI>Pears,</HI> distinguishable by their
rough styptick Taste.</P>
<P><HI>Quinces,</HI> which by their Quality are
often useful to weak Stomachs, and
in stopping of Fluxes of Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Pomegranates,</HI> which contain a Juice
styptick, and extremely cooling.</P>
<P><HI>Barberries, Medlars, Cornelian Cher∣ries,</HI>
all beneficial in Bloody-Fluxes.</P>
<P><HI>Sorrel,</HI> useful in Spitting of Blood,
and Stinking Breath.</P>
<P><HI>Purslain,</HI> succulent, subacid, with
a cooling nitrous Salt.</P>
<P><HI>Burnet,</HI> astringent, with a gentle
spicy Quality, vulnerary.</P>
<P><HI>Tamarinds,</HI> cooling, astringent, yet
laxative to the lower Belly.</P>
<P><HI>Capers,</HI> astringent and diuretick.</P>
<P>All <HI>Pickles,</HI> especially <HI>Samphire,</HI>
which is stimulating. Such sort of
Substances by their Acidity and a∣stringent
Quality offend some Sto∣machs.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="11"/>
There are <HI>Wines</HI> of the same Qua∣lity,
known by their rough austere
Taste; as likewise all acidulated and
chalybeat <HI>Waters.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Strong Waters</HI> or <HI>spirituous Liquors</HI>
contract and harden the solid Parts
most of all.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>2. Alimentary Substances softening and
relaxing.</HEAD>
<P>The Juices of most sorts of ripe
Garden Fruits, as <HI>Cherries,</HI> are cool∣ing,
and laxative to the Bowels; their
Kernels are good for the Gravel in the
Kidneys.</P>
<P><HI>Strawberries,</HI> which by their fra∣grant
Smell seem likewise to be cor∣dial.
The Seeds, which are obtain'd
by shaking the ripe Fruit in Water,
are an excellent Remedy against the
Stone: The Juice of Strawberries
and Limons in Spring-Water is an
excellent Drink in bilious Fevers.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="12"/>
<HI>Oranges,</HI> those that are sweet are
more relaxing than the bitter or <HI>Se∣ville</HI>
Oranges, which nevertheless are
not heating; these are an excellent
Remedy against the hot Scurvy.</P>
<P><HI>Citrons</HI> and <HI>Limons,</HI> their Juices
more cooling than that of Oranges.
Sour Limons do not possess this re∣laxing
Quality very much, they be∣ing
somewhat styptick.</P>
<P><HI>Apples,</HI> which are likewise pecto∣ral,
cooling, and lenitive; they dif∣fer
considerably as to the Kinds of
them, and their Qualities may be
easily known by their Taste.</P>
<P><HI>Pears</HI> have most of the same Qua∣lities;
some Kinds by their high Fla∣vour
seem to be more cordial than
Apples.</P>
<P><HI>Peaches,</HI> which are likewise cordial
and pectoral.</P>
<P>Sweet <HI>Plumbs,</HI> those of the austere
Kind are astringent.</P>
<P><HI>Mulberries,</HI> pectoral, corrective of
the bilious Alkali.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="13"/>
<HI>Apricocks,</HI> unless mellow, are ra∣ther
somewhat styptick.</P>
<P><HI>Gooseberries,</HI> extremely ripe, are le∣nient;
unripe, they are sour, and ra∣ther
astringent.</P>
<P><HI>Currants</HI> are good in Spitting of
Blood, extremely cooling, and some∣what
astringent. The Jelly or Rob
of Currants, mix'd with Water, is a
most excellent Drink in bilious Fe∣vers.</P>
<P><HI>Grapes</HI> taken in moderate Quanti∣ties
help the Appetite and Digestion;
in great Quantities, they resolve the
Bile too much, and produce Fluxes;
dry'd, they are pectoral.</P>
<P><HI>Figs</HI> are great Subduers of Acri∣mony,
useful in Hoarseness and
Coughs, extremely emollient, and by
relaxing the Urinary Passages, diu∣retick,
useful in bloody Urine; it
has been always believed that the
immoderate use of them generates
Lice.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="14"/>
Plants of the low pomiferous Kind,
as <HI>Melons, Pompions, Gourds, Cucum∣bers,</HI>
contain a cooling Juice, with a
nitrous Salt; that of Melons and
the <HI>Ananas</HI> is rich and cordial; they
are diuretick; and there are Instances,
when eaten in great Quantities, they
have produced bloody Urine; they
ought to be taken fasting. The
Juice of Cucumbers is too cold for
some Stomachs, and ought not to
be taken by such as have thin and
poor Blood; if the Stem upon which
they grow be bruised, the Pulp of
the Fruit grows bitter, and has the
Effect of Coloquintids. The Juice
of an unripe Cucumber is purga∣tive.
Cucumbers are useful in bloody
Urine.</P>
<P>All Fruits which contain a sub∣acid
essential Salt, much Phlegm, and
a small Quantity of Oil, have this
lenient Quality; as likewise the emol∣lient
Pot-Herbs; as,</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="15"/>
<HI>Cole, Cabbage, Coleworts,</HI> which
are soft and demulcent, without any
Acidity. The Jelly or Juice of red
Cabbage, bak'd in an Oven, and
mix'd with Honey, is an excellent
Pectoral.</P>
<P><HI>Lettuce,</HI> which has a milky Juice,
with an anodyne or opiate Quality,
resolvent of the Bile, proper for me∣lancholy
People, diuretick, and good
in Stranguries, especially when eat
raw; it is reckoned to increase Milk.</P>
<P><HI>Cichory</HI> and <HI>Dandelion</HI> have some
of the same Qualities, with a small
degree of Bitterness extremely agree∣able
to the Stomach, and not heat∣ing.
The Juice of the Dandelion is
a Remedy in intermitting Fevers.</P>
<P><HI>Spinage,</HI> emollient, but not very
nourishing; it is reckoned good in
Inflammations of the Bowels.</P>
<P><HI>Beets,</HI> emollient, nutritive, and
relaxing.</P>
<P><HI>Carrots,</HI> good in nephritical Cases,
antiacid, and fattening.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="16"/>
<HI>Parsnips,</HI> useful in phlegmatick Co∣licks;
the Plant from which Apopo∣nox
is taken, is a sort of Parsnip.</P>
<P><HI>Skirrets,</HI> useful in bloody Urine,
and Spitting of Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Scorzonera,</HI> demulcent in the Small∣Pox,
Meazles, and pestilential Fevers,
and for Gouty People; the express'd
Juice better than the Decoction.</P>
<P><HI>Goats-beard,</HI> an alimentary Root,
has most of the Qualities of Scorzo∣nera.</P>
<P>Emollient likewise are all farinace∣ous
or mealy Substances.</P>
<P><HI>Barley,</HI> which is deterging, tho 
viscous in a small degree; the De∣coction
and Cream of Barley are
proper in inflammatory Distem∣pers.</P>
<P><HI>Rice,</HI> nourishing, good in Hae∣morrages,
or Fluxes of Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Mays</HI> is not so easily brought to
Fermentation as other Grains, there∣fore
more viscous.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="17"/>
<HI>Wheat,</HI> the properest of any Grain
for Bread, which, when not entirely
purged from the Bran, is laxative,
and stimulating to the Bowels.</P>
<P><HI>Rice,</HI> the Bread, more acescent
and less nourishing than that of
Wheat.</P>
<P><HI>Oats,</HI> cleansing, resolving, and
pectoral; Oatmeal and Butter out∣wardly
apply'd dry the Scab on the
Head.</P>
<P><HI>Millet,</HI> diuretick, cleansing, and
good in Diseases of the Kidneys.</P>
<P><HI>Panick,</HI> aperient, boil'd with Milk,
demulcent, temperating Acrimony.</P>
<P><HI>Pease</HI> contain a soft Oil, without
any spicy Quality; therefore are ex∣tremely
demulcent, and temper Acri∣mony.</P>
<P><HI>Beans</HI> and <HI>Kidney-Beans</HI> have the
same Qualities; they are reckoned
diuretick, and good for the Stone.</P>
<P>It has been commonly reckoned,
because of the Viscosity of Pease and
Beans, that People who live a se∣dentary
<PB N="252" REF="18"/>
Life should not feed much
upon them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Animal Oils; Cream, Butter,</HI>
and <HI>Marrow,</HI> are all lenient and nou∣rishing:
Marrow is excellent in the
dry Scurvy with crackling of the
Bones, where it performs its natural
Office.</P>
<P>Of all Drinks, <HI>Whey</HI> is the most
relaxing, so are warm Water and De∣coctions
of mealy Substances, and
<HI>Panadas,</HI> or Bread boil'd in Water.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>3. Diluting Substances.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Water</HI> and <HI>watery Liquors,</HI> without
any saline Substance; Decoctions of
<HI>mealy Substances; Robs</HI> and <HI>Gellies</HI> of
Garden Fruits in Water.</P>
<P><HI>Resolving</HI> is bringing a Fluid which
is new concreted into the State of
Fluidity again. Such are</P>
<P>All Substances which are sapona∣ceous,
or contain Salt and Oil;
therefore most ripe <HI>Garden Fruits</HI>
<PB N="253" REF="19"/>
have this Quality, and <HI>Honey</HI> most of
all vegetable Substances. Mere dilu∣ting
dissolves and carries off Salts.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>4. Anti-acid, or contrary to Acidity
or Sourness, are,</HEAD>
<P>All <HI>Animal Diet</HI> in general, be∣cause
no Animal has any acid Salt
in it, especially Flesh roasted; tho'
not so easy of Digestion as boil'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Animals</HI> which feed on other
Animals must have this Quality
stronger than those who feed on acid
Vegetables; such are most Fishes, all
Birds which feed upon Worms and
Insects, several Kinds of Water-Fowl,
Woodcocks, Snipes, and several
Kinds of small Birds, which for that
Reason afford a higher Aliment than
those that feed upon Grains or other
Vegetables.</P>
<P>The <HI>Flesh</HI> of <HI>Animals</HI> differs accord∣ing
as they are terrestrial, aquatick,
or amphibious. Fishes contain much
<PB N="254" REF="20"/>
Oil, and amphibious Animals par∣ticipate
somewhat of the Nature of
Fishes, and are oily; and the same
Species of Animals differs according
to the Soil and Air it lives in, and
the Nourishment which it takes, as
those in Marshes and Mountains; the
Flesh of Oxen, Sheep, Deer, in
different Pasturage; and this is in
none more sensible than in Hogs
Flesh.</P>
<P><HI>Young Animals</HI> from their Age and
the Nature of their Aliment have more
tender Fibres, and more superfluous
Humidity than old Animals, which
have their Fibres tougher, and the
Juices more exalted and relishing.</P>
<P><HI>Mutton</HI> by Experiment is the most
perspirable of all animal Food, and
Hogs Flesh and Oysters the least.</P>
<P>The <HI>Flesh</HI> of <HI>Animals</HI> which take
and digest a great Quantity of Food,
and consequently use strong Exercise,
must be nourishing, because they
have strong Sanguification, such are
<PB N="255" REF="21"/>
Pigeons; and the same is true of
some Fishes.</P>
<P>The Nature of most sort of ani∣mal
Diet may be discovered by Taste
and other sensible Qualities, and some
of those general Rules above-men∣tion'd,
without particular Disquisi∣tions
upon every Kind.</P>
<P><HI>Eggs</HI> are perhaps the highest, most
nourishing and exalted of all animal
Food, and most indigestible, be∣cause
no body can take and digest
the same Quantity of them as of
other Food.</P>
<P><HI>Shell-Fish</HI> are nourishing, and their
Oil is corrected by their Salts, which
make it pungent and stimulating.</P>
<P>But, as was said before, all Ani∣mal
Diet is Anti-acid or Alkalescent.</P>
<P>Vegetables used in Aliment anti∣acid
are such as of themselves turn
foetid or stinking, rather than four.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Cole</HI> or <HI>Cabbage</HI> Kind.</P>
<P><HI>Asparagus</HI> diuretick or aperient;
by the foetid Smell which it gives
<PB N="256" REF="22"/>
the Urine it is suspected to be hurt∣ful
to the Kidneys.</P>
<P><HI>Parsley</HI> and <HI>Celery,</HI> both contain a
pungent Salt and Oil, diuretick and
aperient, bad in Bloody-Fluxes.</P>
<P><HI>Garlick, Rockambole, Onions, Shalot,
Leeks,</HI> these abound with a pungent
volatile Salt and Oil, are extremely
diuretick, and, when stimulating Diu∣reticks
may be safely us'd, are very
effectual: Garlick has been found by
Experience to be a very excellent Re∣medy
in Jaundices and Dropsies, and
in Asthmas proceeding from a cold
viscous Phlegm. All these Plants
are hurtful in Cases where the Blood
is too much dissolv'd, in Spitting of
Blood, and bloody Urine.</P>
<P><HI>Cresses, Radishes, Horse-Radishes,
Mustard,</HI> abound likewise in their se∣veral
degrees with a pungent Salt,
and as they subdue Acidity, are very
improper where the Blood verges to
the contrary State of a putrescent
Alkali; and in general they are fitter
<PB N="257" REF="23"/>
for old People, and cold Constitu∣tions,
than the young and sanguine.
Mustard is a very powerful Remedy
in viscous cold phlegmatick Cases.</P>
<P><HI>Dilse,</HI> a Sea-Plant, antiscorbutick.
There are other Sea Plants us'd as
Aliment, which contain a temperate
Sea-Salt, very useful in Scurvies; as
Laver, which is the <HI>Lactuca Marina,</HI>
or Sea-Lettuce, and Sea-Cole, or
Cale.</P>
<P><HI>Carrots, Turnips, Parsnips,</HI> are An∣ti-acids
of a milder Kind.</P>
<P><HI>Nettles,</HI> good against Haemorra∣ges.</P>
<P>Such as abound with a soft Oil,
which operate by blunting the Acri∣mony
of the Salts, as most sorts of
<HI>Nuts;</HI> most of which are hard of
Digestion, yet possess some good me∣dicinal
Qualities.</P>
<P><HI>Walnuts</HI> are cordial, anti-hysterick,
and gently sudorisick.</P>
<P><HI>Hazle-Nuts,</HI> good against Spitting
of Blood.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="24"/>
<HI>Chesnuts</HI> are good in Female Weak∣nesses,
and afford a very good Nou∣rishment.</P>
<P><HI>Almonds,</HI> Pectoral.</P>
<P><HI>Pistachos,</HI> nourishing and stimu∣lating.</P>
<P><HI>Olives</HI> are anti-acid by their Oil,
but all oily Substances beget an Acri∣mony
of another sort.</P>
<P><HI>Truffles,</HI> which have an exalted Oil,
and a volatile Salt of a grateful Sa∣vour,
are heating.</P>
<P><HI>Morelles</HI> have some of the same
Qualities; and so have <HI>Earth-Nuts</HI> and
<HI>Potatoes,</HI> which are very nourishing.</P>
<P><HI>Mushrooms,</HI> which contain an Oil
of a volatile Salt; therefore they are
best corrected by Vinegar; some of
them being poisonous, make the rest
suspicious; the poisonous Kinds ope∣rate
by a sort of Suffocation, in which
the best Remedy is Wine or Vine∣gar
and Salt, and Vomiting as soon
as possible.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="25"/>
Acidity is likewise cur'd by dilu∣ting,
therefore <HI>Water</HI> is an Anti-acid.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>5. Acid Substances are,</HEAD>
<P>Most ripe Garden Fruits, fermen∣ted
Liquors, small Wines, with lit∣tle
Oil, and much Tartar, Vinegar,
sour Milk, Butter-Milk. Several
Plants known by their Taste, as Sor∣rel,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Those of the mealy Kind
are acescent, that is, being kept they
turn sour rather than corrupted and
stinking.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>6. Those things which resolve glutinous
and fat Substances, are</HEAD>
<P><HI>Spices,</HI> as Cinnamon, Mace, Nut∣meg,
Cloves, Ginger, Pepper. These
abounding with a high exalted Oil,
and volatile Salt, by which Principles
they are heating, and act strongly
both on the Fluids and Solids; Gin∣ger
is perhaps one of the best of
<PB N="260" REF="26"/>
them. All Spices are bad for me∣lancholy
People.</P>
<P>Of the same nature are the <HI>Vege∣tables</HI>
used in Seasoning, as Thyme,
Savory, Marjoram, Rosemary, Mint,
Orange and Limon-Peel, Fennel,
which contains a subtil Spice, balsa∣mick,

nourishing Diet, a good Di∣gestion,
little Exercise, much Sleep,

especially Perspiration; therefore the
avoiding these, and inducing their
Contraries, are the proper Cure.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="52"/>
A plethorick Constitution is sub∣ject

Ruptures of the Vessels, and
sudden Death; therefore it ought to
be speedily broke by proper artificial
Evacuations, and restoring the usual

Distemper.</P>
<P>They ought to avoid oily and

Their Diet ought to be rather of
animal Substances than vegetable:
The Flesh of those Animals which
live upon other Animals is most an∣ti-acid,
as several Birds, and Water-Fowl;
tho' those are offensive to the
Stomach sometimes, by reason of
their Oiliness. Vegetable and ani∣mal
Oils are often agreeable to such
Stomachs, as Almonds, Pistachos,
Cream, Butter, Marrow.</P>
<P>Their Diet ought to consist, in
general, of Substances mentioned
N<SUP>o</SUP> 4.</P>
<P>Water or Wine not sour or thin,

<P>They ought to use much Labour

<P><PB N="290" REF="56"/>
To know whether Eruptions of
the Skin come from an acid or alka∣line
Cause, one must attend to the
previous Diet and the concomitant
Symptoms; (Children, by eating un∣ripe
Fruit often, have Eruptions up∣on
their Skin) the Lentor, itching
Colour, and State of such Eruptions,
not inflammatory, nor tending to
Suppuration, point rather to an acid
Cause, and the Success of the Cure
often demonstrates the same, such
being often heal'd by animal alka∣line
Salts.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Constitutions abounding with a spon∣taneous
Alkali.</HEAD>
<P>This Constitution is more natural
to Human Bodies, because all animal
Substances are alkalescent.</P>
<P>Heat, Thirst, hot nidorose Belch∣ings,
Foulness of the Tongue and Pa∣late,
a bitter and hot Taste in the
Mouth, Sickness, Loathing, bilious
<PB N="291" REF="57"/>
Vomitings, Stools with a cadaverous
Smell, Pains in the Belly, with Heat,
are Symptoms of an alkaline State
of the Humours in the Stomach and
Bowels.</P>
<P>Such a State disposeth the Hu∣mours
of the whole Body to Heat,
Inflammations, and Putrefaction, hin∣ders
Nutrition, and often causeth
Eruptions on the Skin, dark, livid,
lead-colour'd and gangrenous, and
what is commonly called the hot
Scurvy.</P>
<P>Such Constitutions ought to avoid
alkaline Substances, mentioned N<SUP>o</SUP> 4,
<HI>viz.</HI> an animal Diet, especially Fat,
Spices, and all Vegetables which a∣bound
with an acrimonious Salt and
high exalted Oil, and the copious
use of Salts in general; all animal
Salts are alkaline; Sea-Salt and Rock-Salt,
tho' they are of a mix'd Na∣ture,
rather increase the Disease; Salt-Petre
is the most cooling and pro∣per.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="58"/>
They ought to use plentifully the
acid Substances mentioned N<SUP>o</SUP> 15, to
live much upon Aliments made of
Grains or mealy Substances, to eat
much Bread, and season much with
Vinegar; thin Wines, Wine mix'd
with Water, Water with Juice of
Limon, and especially Milk and Wa∣ter,
are proper Drinks.</P>
<P>Those who feel no Inconvenience
in taking Acids, ought to take them
plentifully.</P>
<P>People of such Constitutions ought
not to use violent Exercise, nor long
Abstinence, which disposeth to such
a State, and after long Abstinence
they ought not to eat plentifully;
they ought to use liquid rather than
solid Aliment.</P>
<P>Plethorick Constitutions are sub∣ject
to fall into this alkaline State of
the Fluids, which is more dangerous
than that which proceeds from Aci∣dity,
for the Bile (which is here re∣dundant)
is the strongest Anti-acid,
<PB N="293" REF="59"/>
and when it is highly exalted, and
acrimonious, is capable of producing
all the dreadful Symptoms of malig∣nant
and pestilential Fevers, as is
evident from the Experiments that
were made in the Plague of <HI>Mar∣seilles.</HI>
There is nothing corrects the
Acrimony of the Bile so much as the
acid Diet above-mentioned; therefore
one cannot be too early and quick in
discerning a Tendency to such a State,
and observing if the Person be ple∣thorick,
hot, or dry; if the Air be hot;
if bilious Fevers reign; if there be
any Acrimony in the Faeces, Urine,
Sweat; or a yellow; Cast in the Skin;
with the Signs above-mentioned, by
an early Application of proper Reme∣dies,
many dangerous and fatal Di∣seases
might be prevented.</P>

<HEAD>Phlegmatick Constitutions.</HEAD>
<P>Sickness of the Stomach, a Sense

or Meat remaining in the Stomach
undigested, Dejection of Appetite,
Wind coming upwards, but especial∣ly
tough Phlegm frequently rejected
by Vomiting, Inflations and Tu∣mors
of the Belly (sometimes short
Breath) and Paleness, are Signs of a
phlegmatick Constitution; when a
Child grows pale, and his Belly swells,
as happens to those that are rickety,
there is certainly tough Phlegm in
the Intestines, which commonly shuts
up the Mouths of the Lacteals, and
hinders the Nourishment from pas∣sing:
Persons of such Constitutions
ought to avoid mealy Substances un∣fermented,
unripe Fruits, and all
viscous Nourishment; they ought not
to let Blood, except upon urgent
Occasions, nor provoke Sweat, which
thickens the Humours.</P>
<P>Their Diet ought to be alkalescent,
of Substances mentioned N<SUP>o</SUP> 4, be∣cause
whatever brings them into an
alkaline State, is a proper Cure for
<PB N="295" REF="61"/>
the Disease; therefore soapy Sub∣stances,
which consist of a pungent
Salt and volatile Oil, Spices, Salt,
Garlick, Onions, Leeks, and the
warm Vegetables us'd in Seasoning,
Thyme, Rosemary, Savory, Basil,
Marjoram, and in general, every
thing which exalts the Bile; for bi∣lious
and phlegmatick Constitutions
are opposite; and even Children so
diseas'd ought to use a warmer Diet,
than what seems proper to their Age
without it.</P>
<P>Phlegmatick Persons ought to drink
fermented Liquors and generous
Wines, such as put the Blood in a

Phlegm, but it relaxeth too

Salt is a great Dissolver of Fat.</P>
<P>Fat People ought to avoid oily

Honey, Sugar, and ripe Garden-Fruits
are useful.</P>

mentioned No 1, are useful, because
their Fibres are commonly too lax.</P>
<P>Whatever promotes Perspiration,

are useful.</P>
<P>Their Drink ought to be thin
Wines; Coffee and Tea, as they di∣lute
and stimulate moderately, are
useful; great Quantities of oily fer∣mented

<P>To such, all things which heat
and promote too great a Perspiration,
as all Substances that abound with an
acrimonious Salt and volatile Oil,
are hurtful, which the Reader may
see in the First Chapter. Nourish∣ment
viscous and hard of Digestion,
and nothing more than salted and
smok'd Flesh or Fish; in general,
every thing that thickens the Fluids,

<P>There is one Caution to be ob∣serv'd,
That the Diet ought to be
opposite to the particular Acrimony

<HEAD>Faulty Motion of the Fluids.</HEAD>
<P>The Blood and other Fluids of a
Human Body, are often not only
peccant in their Qualities, but Mo∣tion,
which may be either too flow,
too quick, or in some of the Vessels
totally obstructed.</P>
<P>Those who have too slow a Circu∣lation,
are to be consider'd, as in the
Case of phlegmatick and fat People;
and those who have too quick a
Circulation are to be consider'd, as
in the Case of such as are bilious,
hot, and alkaline; and the respective
Diets are proper.</P>
<P>In Obstructions of the Vessels in∣flammatory,
the Aliment ought to
be cool, slender, thin, diluting, a∣voiding
the copious use of Substan∣ces
of a saline Quality, which sti∣mulate,
and consequently may in∣crease
the Inflammations, unless in
some Cases where there is hopes by
<PB N="301" REF="67"/>
volatile Salts to attenuate the Fluid,
and remove the Obstruction, or
where the Intention is to produce a
Suppuration; but it is certain that
any stimulating Substance, when it
does not remove the Obstruction,
increaseth the Inflammation.</P>
<P>In cold Tumors, where the In∣tention

stimulating, consisting of such Sub∣stances

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Acute Diseases.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Fevers, with their various Symptoms.</HEAD>
<P><HI>RIGOR, Coldness.</HI> A right Regi∣men
during the Rigor or cold
Fit in the beginning of a Fever, is
of great Importance, and Mistakes
of dangerous Consequence: A long
continued Rigor is a Sign of a
strong Disease, and is in it self an.
Approach towards Death; during
the Rigor, the Circulation is less
quick, and the Blood actually stag∣nates
in the Extremities, and pres∣sing
upon the Heart creates great
Anxieties, and may produce Con∣cretions
about the Heart, and in
other Parts of the Body; therefore a
Rigor increaseth an Inflammation.
Those who die of Quartan Fevers,
die in the cold Fit; and indeed there
<PB N="304" REF="70"/>
is no Mischief but what may pro∣ceed
from a Rigor of long Dura∣tion.</P>
<P>In such Rigors, all warm Cordials
and stimulating Substances are im∣proper,
for the first acting with
force upon the right Ventricle of the
Heart, may drive the Blood with
too much Force through the Lungs;
and stimulating Substances, by con∣stringing
the Vessels, often increase
the Symptom.</P>
<P>In such a Rigor, nothing is more
proper than Water, which dilutes and
relaxes at the same time, and will
sooner terminate the cold Fit, and
throw the Patient into a Sweat, than
the warmest Cordial; if a very small
Quantity of Rhenish Wine be mix'd
with the Water, it will be still more
effectual: In this Case strong Fric∣tions
of the Extremities relieve.</P>
<P><HI>Anxieties.</HI> In Anxieties which at∣tend
Fevers, when the cold Fit is
over, a warmer Regimen may be
<PB N="305" REF="71"/>
allow'd; and because Anxieties often
happen by Spasms from Wind, Spices
are useful.</P>
<P>In those Anxieties, Soapy Sub∣stances
which dissolve the Blood, are
indicated; ripe Fruits; some of the
lactescent Plants, as Lettuce, Endive,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and especially Honey, have this
Quality.</P>
<P><HI>Thirst.</HI> In Thirst attending Fevers,
Liquors should not be drank quite
cold; for cold Liquors, by constring∣ing
the Glands of the Palate and
Throat, do not quench Thirst so
well as Liquors moderately warm:
In this Case subacid Liquors should be
drank plentifully; all Salts increase
Thirst, except Nitre, and dulcify'd Spi∣rit
of Nitre mix'd with Water, is very
proper in this Case; so are Barley∣Water
and Emulsions, except in great
Weakness and Flatulencies of the Sto∣mach,
in which Case Water mix'd
with a small Quantity of Rhenish
Wine, is best of all.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="72"/>
<HI>Sickness, Vomiting.</HI> This is one of
the most troublesome Symptoms at∣tending
a Fever, because it renders
the Patient incapable of taking any
thing.</P>
<P>This Symptom is often prevented
by giving a Vomit; or cur'd by pro∣moting
the Vomiting for a while by
tepid Water.</P>
<P>During the Symptom, acid Li∣quors,
and ev'n such as are austere
and astringent, are indicated, because
such strengthen the Fibres of the
Stomach; and indeed Nature directs
Patients to such a Diet, for they co∣vet
subacid Liquors, and abhor fat
and oily things.</P>
<P>Diluting, and sometimes relaxing
the Belly, and carrying the bilious
Salts downwards, often cures this
Symptom.</P>
<P>Attention is to be given to the
Appetites of Patients, in this and
many other Cases, who have some∣times
coveted odd things which
<PB N="307" REF="73"/>
have reliev'd them, as Salt, Vine∣gar,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Vomiting, from a bilious Cause,
is cur'd by subacid Liquors; Vomit∣ing,
from some putrid Cause, by
Salts of all Kinds; in such a Case,
Water-Gruel with Cream of Tartar,
Rhenish Wine and Water, Jelly of
Currants, Marmalade of Quinces,
Sorrel boil'd in Broths well skimm'd
from Fat, are beneficial.</P>
<P>If the Vomiting comes from a
phlegmatick Cause, Spices, and bit∣ter
things will relieve. The Counter∣poison
must be adapted to the Cause;
for Example, in Poison from Subli∣mated
Corrosive, and Arsenick.</P>
<P>In the First, alkaline Substances;
in the Second, oily Substances are
proper; in both, diluent.</P>
<P>It is easy to judge of the Cause by
the Substances which the Patient
throws up.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="74"/>
Whether Vomit may be safely
or properly given, must be judg'd
by the Circumstances; if there be
any Symptoms of an Inflammation
of the Stomach, a Vomit is ex∣tremely
dangerous.</P>
<P><HI>Wind</HI> and <HI>Spasms</HI> are occasion'd by
the feverish Heat expanding the ae∣rial
Particles in the Fluids.</P>
<P>Whatever is anodyne and quiets
Convulsions, and what abates the
Heat, relieves this Symptom.</P>
<P><HI>Weakness,</HI> or the Impotence of ex∣ercising
animal Motion which attends
Fevers, proceeds from too great Ful∣ness
in the beginning, and too great
Inanition in the latter end of the
Disease; for whatever stops or re∣tards
the Circulation in the smallest
Vessels, especially those of the Brain
(which either of these Causes will do)
produceth this Symptom. Those
two Causes demand different Me∣thods,
in the first emptying and dilu∣ting;
<PB N="309" REF="75"/>
in the latter, a more plentiful
Nourishment, the use of Wine dilu∣ted
with Water, and Spices in small
Quantities, Jellies, Broths, the alka∣lescent
Quality of which may be cor∣rected
with some acid, unless there
be Signs of Acidity, and in that Case
the Diet ought to be contrary to the
Cause of the Symptom; Viper-Broth
is both anti-acid and nourishing.</P>
<P>In Debility, from great Loss of
Blood, Wine, and all Aliment that
is easily assimulated, or turn'd into
Blood, is proper; Blood is required
to make Blood; a small Quantity of
Blood brings the Patient into danger
of a Dropsy.</P>
<P>Frictions of the extreme Parts re∣lieve
Weaknesses, as they promote
the Flux of the Juices and Spirits in
the Joints and Limbs.</P>
<P>Fat People are most subject to this
Symptom of Weakness in Fevers,
because the Fat, melted by the fever∣ish
Heat, obstructs the small Canals,
<PB N="310" REF="76"/>
and consequently produceth this
Symptom. This is evident by the
great Loss of Fat such People sustain
in Fevers. In the latter end of Fe∣vers,
such are weak by the Laxity of
the Fibres, and the Emptiness of the
smaller Vessels; such therefore must
be treated with particular Care, <HI>viz,</HI>
after due Evacuations, diluting
strongly both by Drink and Clysters,
avoiding all things oily, and using
Sugar, Honey, and ripe Fruits.</P>
<P>Cordials made of spirituous Li∣quors
are not the best Remedies for
this Debility, tho' they increase the
Force of the Heart, and are necessa∣ry
sometimes to keep up the vital
Functions, they rather coagulate the
Fluid; they add Strength to the Mill,
but congeal the Stream. Whatever
makes the Circulation more free
through the small Vessels, is a Cor∣dial.</P>
<P><HI>Heat;</HI> the Degree of which may
be known by the Thermoscope, the
<PB N="311" REF="77"/>
Sensation of the Patient, the Intense∣ness
of the red Colour of the Urine,
the Sizeness of the Blood, the Dissi∣pation
of the fluid Parts, which
renders it thicker; the Hardness,
Strength, and Frequency of the
Pulse, which makes the Friction the
stronger, to which the Heat is pro∣portional,
the bad Disposition of the
Humour, and the dry Temperament
of the Body.</P>
<P>Feverish Heat is moderated by
Blood-letting, by muscular Rest, by
moderate Ligatures which compress the
Veins only, and often removed from
Joint to Joint, by a mechanical Rea∣son,
retard the Circulation; of such
sort is dry Cupping, bathing the
lower Parts, watery Liquors for Drink,
not cold, but tepid; subacid, as Jel∣ly
of Currants dissolved in tepid wa∣tery
Liquors; Decoctions of mealy
Substances acidulated, Substances a∣nodyne,
Substances which dissolve
Concretions, as Sugar, Honey, and
<PB N="312" REF="78"/>
the simple Oxymel, often used by
<HI>Hippocrates,</HI> plentiful diluting, and
restoring as much Water to the Blood
as is dissipated by the Heat; all de∣mulcent
and relaxing Substances,
cooling the Air in the Room, open∣ing
the Curtains, and removing too
thick Bed-clothes; all stimulating and
slyptick Substances to be avoided, be∣cause
they increase the Force of the
solid Parts.</P>
<P><HI>Delirium.</HI> Too great Alacrity and
Promptness in Answering, especially
in Persons naturally of another Tem∣per,
is a Sign of an approaching De∣lirium:
In a feverish Delirium there
is a small Inflammation of the Brain;
therefore any thing which increaseth
the Circulation in the lower Parts,
and diminisheth the Pressure on the
Brain, is beneficial, as immerging
the Feet in warm Water; nothing
relieves the Head more than the
Piles, therefore Suppositories of Ho∣ney,
Aloes, and Rock-Salt, ought
<PB N="313" REF="79"/>
to be try'd, relaxing by emollient
and watery Substances, both in
Drink and Clysters, especially Bar∣ley-Cream
and Barley-Gruel.</P>
<P><HI>Coma Sleepiness.</HI> A Coma will
proceed either from a Pressure upon
the Originals of the Nerves, by
too great Repletion; or from a
Penury of Spirits by too great Ina∣nition.</P>
<P>Old Men are subject to Comas by
the Tenacity of the Fluids circula∣ting
in the Brain, which being re∣solved
by the Fever, obstruct the
small Canals of the Brain: In young
People it commonly proceeds from
Fulness, and is best cur'd by letting
Blood, and relaxing the Belly. The
Sign of such a Fulness is, a red
Countenance, and Eyes inflamed; if
it proceeds from a glutinous Oil, it
ought to be attempted to be resolv'd
by Water, nitrous Salts, Soaps, and
subacid Liquors.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="80"/>
People recovering from Comas,
must take at first soft Nourishment,
and in small Quantities.</P>
<P><HI>Watchfulness.</HI> This Symptom,
which is sometimes call'd a Coma
Vigil, often precedes too great Sleepi∣ness,
and is perhaps the most ill-bo∣ding
Symptom of a Fever.</P>
<P>The Expedients in such a Case
are extreme Care to keep the Pa∣tient
from Noise, and what makes
any strong Impression upon his Senses,
some of those Helps us'd in a Deli∣rium,
because this is an Approach to∣wards
it; a moist softening Diet; all
Preparations of Barley, Emulsions of
Poppy Seeds, and Almonds, Ali∣ment
of some lactescent Plants, espe∣cially
Lettuces, Decoctions of Scor∣zonera
Roots, Almond Cream, and
what is call'd Winter Flummery,
us'd as Aliment; Tea, made of
Cowslip Flowers, relaxing gently the
Belly.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="81"/>
<HI>Boerhaave</HI> proposes some mecha∣nical
Expedients which may perhaps
have a good Effect, as a soft Noise
of Water distilling by Drops into a
Bason, and the Patient trying to
reckon them.</P>
<P>The Air perfum'd with the Smell
of soporiferous Plants, as Poppies,
Mandrakes, Nightshade, Bean Flow∣ers.</P>
<P>Application of Cloths dipp'd in
Vinegar to the Temples.</P>
<P>Opiats must never be given but
after great Evacuations.</P>
<P><HI>Convulsions.</HI> It is of the utmost
Importance to know the Cause and
the Seat of this Disease, which is of∣ten
obscure.</P>
<P>In Infants they commonly pro∣ceed
from Acidity in the Stomach,
and are cured by terrestrial Absor∣bents;
in such indeed Convulsions
attending Fevers are not quite so
dangerous.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="82"/>
Convulsions arising from some
Acrimony in the Stomach, or from
something vellicating a Nerve in its
Extremity, and not in its Original
where it ariseth from the Brain, are not
very dangerous.</P>
<P>Convulsions which arise from great
Evacuations, as great Haemorrages
attending Fevers, are dangerous.</P>
<P>Convulsions arising from Inflam∣mations
of the Membranes of the
Brain are commonly fatal: The
Symptoms attending them are a
great Heat, a hard Pulse, and a De∣lirium:
The Remedies, and even
those from Diet, are to be us'd ac∣cording
to the Seat of the Disease.</P>
<P>If from the Stomach, such Ali∣ments
as are contrary to the par∣ticular
Acrimony, Acid Alkaline, or
Oily, residing there, as in the Case
of Vomiting.</P>
<P>If from something impacted in
the Brain, warm volatile and spicy
Substances will increase the Disease;
<PB N="317" REF="83"/>
in that Case, Substances which re∣lax
and dilute are proper, especially
such as open the Belly; which, <HI>See
in the First Chapter;</HI> and in general,
the Regimen prescrib'd in a Coma,
or Delirium.</P>
<P><HI>Violent Sweats</HI> proceed from a
Laxity of the Vessels, and too vehe∣ment
a Circulation of the Blood.</P>
<P>Profuse Sweats deprive the Blood
of its most fluid Parts, thicken, and
often cause Obstructions; it is not
good Practice to push Sweating too
much in Fevers, except in such as
are pestilential.</P>
<P>In profuse Sweats, Care at least
should be taken, by diluting, to re∣store
the Liquid which the Blood
loseth, and to use the Methods ad∣vised
in too great Heat, by taking
away some of the Coverings of the
Bed, and admitting of cool Air,
and using a Diet moderately astrin∣gent;
Wine, Spices, and spirituous
Liquors, in this Case, have often a
<PB N="318" REF="84"/>
good Effect; spirituous Liquors thick∣en
the Fluids; Sage is a good Re∣medy
in the Case of profuse Sweats.</P>
<P><HI>A Diarrhoea Looseness</HI> proves often a
dangerous and fatal Symptom in Fe∣vers,
it weakens, excoriates and inflames
the Bowels, occasions Bloody-Fluxes,
thickens the circulating Juices, and
exhausts the Strength of the Patient;
notwithstanding, a critical Diarrhoea
is not to be stopt, for fear of in∣curring
these Dangers.</P>
<P>Attention is to be given to the
Cause of Acidity; it is to be cur'd
by Anti-acids; but, as in Fevers, the
Cause is more frequently alkaline and
bilious, Acid or four things resolve,
and it happens that oily Substances
by blasting the Acrimony will do
good in Diarrhoeas. Oily Substances
of themselves do not irritate or pro∣voke
Diarrhoeas, they only lubricate
or make the Bowels slippery. Diar∣hoeas
arising from Quantities of Fruit
are often cur'd by Emulsions.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="85"/>
Vomiting, by evacuating the irri∣tating
Cause, often cures such Diar∣rhoeas.</P>
<P>Anodyne Substances are proper,
and generally speaking, solid and dry
Aliment, rather than liquid.</P>
<P><HI>Inflammatory Eruptions.</HI> In all
these of any kind whatsoever, as
Small-Pox, Meazles, Scarlet Fever,
Purples, the Intention in Diet
ought to be, to avoid strong Sudo∣rificks,
which push out too great a
Quantity of the Matter upon the
Skin; to use cooling and temperate
Diluents, which keep the Matter flu∣id
and moveable, so that it may be
secern'd from the Blood; to keep
warm during the Eruption; and that
then Diet be cool; for which Reason
the moderate Use of Acids, as Juice
of Limon, is indicated.</P>
<P>A due Attention to the few Rules
above-mention'd, in the several Symp∣toms,
will prove very successful in
the Cure of most Fevers. I shall
<PB N="320" REF="86"/>
only add a few more according to
the various Kinds of Fevers and In∣flammatory
Distempers.</P>
<P>An Ephemera, or a Fever of one
Day, is cur'd by Abstinence, Rest,
and Diluting; and the same Method
will prove effectual if the Fever lasts se∣veral
Days, and is not putrid, or attend∣ed
with a greater Inflammation and
Acrimony, and Obstruction of the
Vessels in some Parts of the Body,
amongst which is what is commonly
call'd, a Causus, or burning Fever.</P>
<P>The Causes of such a Fever are
various; Errors in the Non-Naturals,
Air, Meat and Drink, Rest and Mo∣tion.
Such a Fever will be rais'd by
Vehement Exercise or Labour, Heat
of the Sun, by long Thirst, by the
immoderate Use of fermented and
spirituous Liquors; and hot things,
as Spices; and by great Lassitude en∣dured
any way, especially in hot
Weather.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="87"/>
Its Symptoms are a burning Heat
in the Skin, a Sensation of extreme
Heat inwardly; sometimes Coldness
in the extreme Parts; Dryness of
the Skin, Mouth, and Nostrils;
a Dryness and Roughness of the
Tongue; laborious and short breath∣ing;
great Thirst; Loathing, Sick∣ness
of the Stomach, and Vomiting;
Anxiety, Restlesness, Weariness; some∣times
a Cough and Hoarseness; Watch∣fulness
and Delirium, and Exacerba∣tion
every other Day.</P>
<P>Such a Fever is often resolv'd by
a bleeding at the Nose, which ought
not to be stop'd unless it endangers
Life. It is likewise often in the cri∣tical
Day resolv'd by Sweating, Vo∣miting,
Looseness, and Spitting of
thick Phlegm. The fatal Signs are
commonly bloody Urine, Difficulty
of Swallowing, watery Sweats about
the Head and Face, without Relief;
Coldness of the Extremities, Trem∣bling,
too great a Looseness; and
<PB N="322" REF="88"/>
sometimes an Inflammation of the
Lungs.</P>
<P>The Regimen, in such a Fever, is
keeping the Air of the Room pure
and cool, untainted with Fire, Smoke,
or the Breaths of many People; they
ought to have no more Bed-clothes
than barely protects them from Cold;
their Curtains ought to be kept open
so as to renew the Air; and their
Posture in lying, as erect as they
can bear; the Sick, in this Condition,
covet all these things, and their Con∣traries
offend them.</P>
<P>Their Drink ought to be cool, mild,
subacid, tepid, given in moderate
Quantities, and often, as Water
with Juice of Limon or Tama∣rinds.</P>
<P>Their Aliment ought to be light,
of farinaceous Vegetables, as Water-Gruel,
Preparations of Barley, with
some Juice of Limon; Rice boil'd in
Whey, and strain'd. Roasted Apples
in the Progress of the Disease; a lit∣tle
<PB N="323" REF="89"/>
toasted Bread with Rhenish Wine
and Water, Jelly of Currants; Broths
and Jellies made of animal Substances
are rather too alkalescent, at least they
ought to be qualify'd with Juices of
Limon, or some acid.</P>
<P>Sometimes such alimentary Sub∣stances
as gently stimulate the Belly,
are useful, as some ripe Fruits, Straw∣berries,
Currants, Mulberries.</P>
<P>The Symptoms increase by the
Use of hot things given either as Ali∣ment
or Medicine.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Intermitting Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>They are (at least in this Country)
very obstinate, often return in spite
of all Remedies, and by long Con∣tinuance
they degenerate into Hepa∣tical
Fevers, and many chronical Dis∣tempers,
as Jaundice, Dropsy, Schir∣rus's,
and Scurvies; therefore in this
Disease a right Method, both of Me∣dicines
and Diet, is of great Impor∣tance.
<PB N="324" REF="90"/>
There is a great Variety in
these Diseases, as to the Intervals of
Times between the Paroxysms; Ter∣tians
sometimes redouble their Paro∣xysms,
so as to appear like Quotidians.
I think it may be taken as a general
Rule, That the greater Distance of
Time there is between the Paroxysms,
the Fever is less dangerous, but more
obstinate.</P>
<P>There is a different Regimen to
be us'd during the Continuance and
Absence of the Paroxysm; and in the
Paroxysm itself, during the Rigor or
cold Fit, the Heat and the Sweat.</P>
<P>During the Rigor, the Regimen
prescrib'd in the foregoing Part of
this Chapter, in the Article of Fever∣ish
Rigors, is proper in all Fevers,
and Care is to be taken by all pro∣per
Methods to shorten that Period as
much as possible, and by tepid Di∣luents
to bring on the Sweat soon,
but not to push it beyond its due
Measure, because an intermitting Fe∣ver
<PB N="325" REF="91"/>
relaxeth and weakens the Body
extremely.</P>
<P>Between the Paroxysms, too great
Abstinence is hurtful as much as too
great Repletion; as intermitting Fe∣vers
are often of long Continuance,
extreme Abstinence is impractica∣ble,
and would reduce the Pa∣tient
to a Condition not to be able
to sustain the Shock of the next At∣tack.</P>
<P>Between the Paroxysms, such Sub∣stances
as temper, correct, and sub∣due
the bilious Alkali, as acid Sub∣stances,
nitrous Salts, small thin
Wines with Water, Chicken Broth with
Juice of Limons; Wine with Bitters
infused, are proper; Cichory and
Dandelion are useful, because the ex∣press'd
Juices of them cure intermit∣ting
Fevers in warm Countries; the
Physicians of these Countries likewise
use astringent Vegetables, <HI>See</HI> Chap. I.
N<SUP>o</SUP> 1.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="92"/>
Exercise, to as great a degree as
the Patient can bear, is extremely
beneficial between the Paroxysms.</P>
<P>But the chief Remedy of all is to
endeavour to prevent the cold Fit,
by getting to Bed, by Frictions, and
some sudorifick and warm Liquor;
for by putting off the cold Fit some
Agues have been cur'd.</P>
<P>Letting of Blood seldom does
good, and often a great deal of Hurt
in intermitting Fevers; but the Con∣dition
of the Patient is to be consi∣der'd
in this Case.</P>
<P>Intermitting Fevers have been ob∣served
to free from some Chronical
Distempers, as the Gout and Con∣vulsions,
but they often induce great
ones themselves.</P>

<P>This Disease, of all others, re∣quires
the speediest Applications,
profuse Haemorrages from the Nose
commonly resolve it, and copious
Bleeding, by opening the temporal
Arteries, are the most effectual Re∣medies:
But to stick to my Subject,
which is the Diet.</P>
<P>Substances which cool, and at the

beneficial, as Tamarinds boil'd in

<PB N="328" REF="94"/>
Cool Air, and Sitting up, if
possible; for the warm Air of the

<P>The Aliment ought to be slender,

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Quincy.</HEAD>
<P>The Tumour of the Throat, which
occasions the Difficulty of Swallowing
and Breathing, attending this Dis∣temper,
may be of various sorts:
Sometimes it proceeds from a Serosi∣ty
obstructing the Glands, which
may be watery, aedematose, schirrous,
<PB N="329" REF="95"/>
according to the several degrees of
the Viscosity of the Humour; some∣time
inflammatory, which Inflamma∣tion
will sometimes end in a Suppu∣ration,
or Gangrene.</P>
<P>The Difficulties of Breathing and
Swallowing, which happen without
any Tumour outward or inward, af∣ter
long Diseases, proceed commonly
from a Resolution or paralytical Dis∣position
of the Parts, and is the im∣mediate
Forerunner of Death.</P>
<P>The Regimen in those Quincies
which proceed merely from the Ob∣struction
of the Glands, must be to
use such warm Liquors as gently re∣lax,
soften, and moisten those Glands,
such as carry off the redundant Se∣rum
by Stool, Sweat, and Urine; or
by stimulating, open the Emuncto∣ries
of these Glands to secern the
Humour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Chap. I.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="96"/>
In a more watery Tumour, the
Diet may be more warm than in the
inflammatory, and the moderate use
of Wine often relieves the Patient.</P>
<P>The Difficulty of Swallowing and
Breathing, occasion'd by Schirrosities
of the Glands, is not to be cur'd any
otherwise than by Extirpation.</P>
<P>Those who are subject to Inflam∣mations
of the Throat, ought to live
temperately to prevent a Plethora; or
to break such a Fulness speedily by
proper Evacuations, to beware of
cold Air, too astringent or stimula∣ting
Aliment or Medicine, and vio∣lent
Exercise, which, by increasing
the projectile Motion of the Blood,
heat; but especially the swallowing of
cold Liquors when they are hot.</P>
<P>In these Inflammations a slight Di∣arrhoea
relieves; therefore Aliments
which promote it are useful, as Ta∣marinds
infus'd in Whey. Decoc∣tions
and Emulsions of farinaceous
<PB N="331" REF="97"/>
Vegetables moderately acidulated, and
such as abound with a cooling ni∣trous
Salt, are proper; it is com∣monly
thought that Punpenella, Saxi∣fraga,
or Burnet, is a Specifick in
this Case: Every body knows the Be∣nefit
of Mulberries, taken all man∣ner
of ways. All Acids, as Sorrel,
Juice of Limon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> abate Inflam∣mations.</P>
<P>The Mouth and Throat must be
kept moist, and the Nose clear, that
the Air may have a free Passage
through it; for Air drawn by the
Mouth, dries.</P>
<P>When the Deglutition is totally
abolish'd, the Patient may be nou∣rish'd
by Clysters, which I have
known to have been done for a
whole Week, after which the Tumour
suppurated.</P>
<P>When the Inflammation ends in
a Gangrene, the Case generally proves
mortal, except it be only in the

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Inflammation of the Lungs.</HEAD>
<P>Such may happen either in the
bronchial or pulmonary Vessels, and
may soon be communicated from
one to the other; when the Inflam∣mation
affects both the Lobes and the
whole Body of the Lungs, the Case
is desperate, because the Circulation
must be stopt, and no Blood can
flow back into the Heart. Besides
the general Causes of Inflammations,
those which affect the Lungs particu∣larly,
are a bad Conformation of the
Lungs and Thorax commonly atten∣ded
with an Asthma, Air too hot,
cold and moist, abounding perhaps
with caustick, astringent, and coa∣gulating
Particles; the Lungs, pro∣perly
speaking, are an outward Part of
the Body, expos'd to the Air, which,
by its immediate Contact may easily
<PB N="333" REF="99"/>
coagulate the Blood which flows a∣long
the Surfaces of the Air-Bladders,
and I believe the Qualities of the
Air are the general Cause of the In∣flammation
of the Lungs which hap∣pen
in the Winter time.</P>
<P>As the Lungs are the chief Organ
of Sanguification, crude and viscous
Chyle, viscous Aliment, Spices, but
especially spirituous Liquors, may oc∣casion
this Inflammation; too great
an Exercise of the Lungs, so as to
occasion a short and laborious Breath∣ing,
or keeping them too long upon
the Stretch by Vociferation, or loud
Singing, may produce the same Ef∣fect:
There are coagulating Poisons
which affect the Lungs very suddenly;
extreme violent Passions, by affecting
the Motion of the Heart, may do
the same; it is a common thing to
see People in sudden Transports of
Anger breathe short. Inflammations
are sometimes translated from other
Parts to the Lungs; a Pleurisy easily
<PB N="334" REF="100"/>
passeth into Peripneumony. The a∣voiding
those Causes is the best Rule
of Diet to prevent the Disease; be∣sides,
speedy and plentiful letting of
Blood before it has quite taken
place.</P>
<P>This Disease is often cur'd by the
critical Resolution, Concoction, and
Evacuation of the morbifick Matter,
which is either attenuated so as to
be return'd into the Channels, and
to go on in the common. Thread
of Circulation, or expectorated by
Coughing, which may be easily
known by the Abatement of Symp∣toms,
<HI>viz.</HI> the Fever, Difficulty of
Breathing, Thirst, Anxiety, Restles∣ness,
and the Patient's falling into
gentle breathing Sweats. One of the
best Resolvents is the Blood of the
wild Goat.</P>
<P>Copious Bleeding is the most ef∣fectual
Remedy in the beginning of
the Disease; but when the Expecto∣ration
goes on successfully, not so
<PB N="335" REF="101"/>
proper, because it sometimes suppres∣seth
it, and in that Case Sudorificks
thicken the Matter that is expectora∣ted.
The Motions of Nature ought
to be followed. This by the way.</P>
<P>From the Symptoms in this Stage
of the Disease, and the use of the
Lungs, it is evident the Aliment
ought to be more slender and thin
than in any other inflammatory Di∣sease
whatsoever, common Whey be∣ing
sufficient to preserve the Strength
of the Patient; watery Liquors, and
even the Steam of warm Water ta∣ken
in by the Breath, attenuates the
impacted Matter. Relaxing Ali∣ment,
of which Barley and all its
Preparations are the best.</P>
<P>In this State, Diureticks, which
have not much Acrimony in them,
are proper, for Fluxes of Urine re∣lieve
the Lungs; for this Intention,
an Infusion of Fenel Roots in warm
Water, with Milk, is good, both as
Nourishment and Drinks.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="102"/>
If Nature relieves by a Diarrhoea,
without sinking the Strength of the
Patient, it is not to be stopt, but
promoted gently by emollient Cly∣sters.</P>
<P>Decoction of Cichory, Lettuce,
as being anodyne and resolvent, are
proper.</P>
<P>If the Patient is not reliev'd nor
dies in eight Days, the Inflammation
ends in a Suppuration and an Abscess
in the Lungs, and sometimes in some
other Part of the Body; the Symptoms
of which are, an obstinate dry Cough,
increas'd by Motion and taking of
Food; theeasiest Posture in Lying be∣ing
upon the affected Side; a continual
Lent-Fever, with Rigors invading with
uncertain Periods; Exacerbations af∣ter
Motion and Repast, Thirst, Night-Sweats,
a frothy Urine, Paleness,
Leanness, Weakness.</P>
<P>In such a Case one must forbear
letting of Blood. The Diet must
be mild, soft, incrassating, and more
<PB N="337" REF="103"/>
plentiful; tepid Vapours admitted
into the Lungs, of Decoctions of
proper Ingredients; and when by the
Symptoms and Time the Impost∣hume
may be judg'd to be ripe, the
Vapour of Vinegar it self, and any
thing which creates a Cough, as
Oxymel, or Vinegar and Honey,
Exercise and Concussion are proper,
the sooner it is broke, the less Dan∣ger
to the Lungs.</P>
<P>Tho' such a State is extremely dan∣gerous,
it is not quite desperate; the
Aliment ought to be Milk; the
Drink, Milk, and Barley-Water, and
such alimentary Substances as are ex∣pectorating
and cleansing, with gen∣tle
Anodynes, that the Patient may
have some Rest. <HI>See</HI> Chap I.</P>
<P>The principal Intention in every
State of Inflammation of the Lungs
is to promote Expectoration, and to
restore it when it is lost.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="104"/>
If the Inflammation ends in a
Gangrene, the Case is desperate; if
in a Schirrus, incurable.</P>
<P>There is a spurious sort of a Pe∣ripneumony,
not inflammatory; when
the Vessels are obstructed with a vis∣cous
Pituite that mixeth with the
Blood, and invades in cold Weather,
it is dangerous, and often suffocates;
it is incident to weak and old Peo∣ple.
In this, some of the Methods
used in the Inflammatory are pro∣per,
but not so copious Bleeding,
Clysters frequently injected; Ali∣ment
more generous, Broths, and
Jellies with Juice of Limon, Hydro∣mel,
or Honey and Water; for
Drink, soft Oils, and Aliments which
abound with a soft, not volatile Oil,
are beneficial.</P>
<P>A Peripneumony is the last fatal
Symptom of every Disease, for no
Body dies without a Stagnation of
the Blood in the Lungs; as long as
<PB N="339" REF="105"/>
it circulates through the Lungs, it
will circulate through the rest of the
Body. The total Extinction of
Breath is caus'd by the Stagnation of
Blood in the Lungs.</P>

<HEAD>Pleurisy.</HEAD>
<P>There is none of the Membranes
which invest the Inside of the Breast,
but may be the Seat of this Disease,
the Mediastine as well as the Pleura.</P>
<P>The Causes of this Disease, be∣sides
those common to all Inflamma∣tions,
are often a particular Disposi∣tion
to inflammatory Distempers, a
Straitness of the Arteries of the Pleu∣ra,
a Callosity of that Membrane,
an Adhesion of the Lungs, the sud∣den
Admission of cold Air by too
thin clothing, too hot a Regimen,
and especially the copious use of spi∣rituous
Liquors, cold Liquors drank
when the Body is very hot, a Trans∣lation
<PB N="340" REF="106"/>
of some inflammatory Matter
from some other Part, but most of
all cold Air from a Northerly or
North-easterly Wind; from which
Causes proper Cautions may be ta∣ken
in the Regimen by way of Pre∣vention.</P>
<P>This Disease is sometimes dry,
without any Spitting, and sometimes
attended with Expectoration from
the Lungs, and that is taken off
by a Coction and Resolution of the
feverish Matter, or terminates in
Suppurations, or a Gangrene.</P>
<P>The Regimen ought to be much
the same as in a Peripneumony, a
cool, relaxing, slender, diluting Diet,
and avoiding all things which in∣crease
Heat, even too hot Air.</P>

are the same as in Inflammations of
the Lungs; when the Matter is made,

<HEAD>Inflammation of the Liver.</HEAD>
<P>The hepatical Artery, and the Vena
Porta, carry the Blood into the Liver;
the first being very small, and the Mo∣tion
of the Blood in the last being slow,
is the reason that Inflammations in
the Liver are not so frequent as in
<PB N="343" REF="109"/>
some other Parts of the Body; but
when they obtain, extremely dange∣rous,
unless they take up but a small
Part of the Liver, and such happen
more frequently than is commonly
imagined.</P>
<P>Some of the best Cautions in Diet
may be taken from the Causes and
Symptoms of this Disease.</P>
<P>Which, besides the general Causes
of Inflammations, are extreme Fat∣ness.
Fat dissolv'd by Heat and In∣flammations
obstructs the Vessels of
the Liver very suddenly. Cattle fat∣ted
by good Pasturage, after violent
Motion, sometimes die suddenly; in
such the Liver is found to be in∣flamed
and corrupted. An atrabila∣rian
adust Temper of the Blood and
Gall, an acrimonious or purulent
Matter, stagnating in some other Or∣gan,
is more easily deposited upon
the Liver than any other Part,
especially if attended with the use of
hot and spicy Aliments, spirituous
<PB N="344" REF="110"/>
Liquors, great Heat, and a Fever▪
Erosions, by the Acrimony of the
Gall, or Obstructions by Viscosity;
any Callosity, Schirrus, or Stone in
the Liver; Thirst, long endur'd, be∣ing
suddenly chill'd by cold Air, cold
Water, or drinking cold Liquors after
great Heat; Vomits given injudi∣ciously,
when the Liver is already
unsound, which if they do not re∣move
the Obstruction, exagitate the
Liver too much; inveterate hypo∣condriacal
Distempers. All these
Causes may produce Inflammations
of the Liver.</P>
<P>In such a Case, the Liver being
swell'd compresseth the Stomach, Dia∣phragm,
and the neighbouring vis∣cera
of the lower Belly, stops the
Circulation of the Juices, the Gene∣ration
and Excretion of the Gall,
and all Digestion; produceth an In∣finity
of bad Symptoms, the Jaun∣dice,
with all the Diseases depending
upon it; for the Liver receives the
<PB N="345" REF="111"/>
refluent Blood almost from all the
Parts of the Abdomen, and is the
chief Instrument of all the Dige∣stions
which are made there. A Fe∣ver,
an Inflammation and pungent
Pain on the Region of the Liver
and Diaphragm, a Tension of the
Hypochondres, Yellowness of the
Skin and Eyes, and a Saffron-colour'd
Urine, are Signs of an inflammato∣ry
Disposition of the Liver.</P>
<P>This Disease ends as other Inflam∣mations,
being cur'd either by Reso∣lution,
Concoction, and Excretion
of the morbid Matter, terminates in
an Abscess, Schirrus, or Gangrene.</P>
<P>During the first State, a warm Re∣gimen
and Saffron, which is reckon'd
a Specifick, is improper.</P>
<P>Cooling resolving Liquors taken
inwardly, as Whey, with Sorrel boil'd
in it; outward Fomentations, and
frequent Injection of Clysters, Bath∣ing
and Frictions, relax, and render
the Matter fluid; Honey, with a lit∣tle
<PB N="346" REF="112"/>
Rhenish Wine, or Vinegar; the
Juices and Jellies of some ripe Gar∣den
Fruits; and those of some lactes∣cent
papescent Plants, as Endive,
Dandelion, Lettuce, are resolvent.</P>
<P>Violent Purging hurts, gently re∣laxing
the Belly relieves, Diluents
with nitrous Salts are beneficial, or
Tamarinds boil'd in warm Water or
Whey; bloody Stools, not in an ex∣treme
degree, or streak'd with Blood,
ought not to be stop'd, because they
help to resolve the Distemper, and
Haemorrages by the Nose often do
the same.</P>
<P>The feverish Matter is often car∣ried
off by Urine, and therefore Di∣ureticks
not highly stimulating, are
proper.</P>
<P>Sweating ought not to be promo∣ted
by warm Cordials, but encourag'd
by warm diluting Liquors.</P>
<P>It is a deplorable Case when the
Inflammation terminates in a Suppu∣ration,
unless the Abscess points out∣wardly,
<PB N="347" REF="113"/>
so as it may be opened; for
if the Pus be evacuated into the Ab∣domen,
it produceth dismal Symp∣toms,
Putrefaction, or an incura∣ble
hepatical Dysentery, or Bloody-Flux.</P>
<P>The Pus, from an Ulcer of the
Lungs, growing thin and ichorose
corrodes the Vessels (for the Liver of
all the Viscera, is the most friable,
and easily crumbled or dissolv'd) it
is often carried into the Blood, and
rejected by Vomiting, with a cada∣verous
Smell, attended with great
Thirst; if it is carried downward, it
occasions a purulent colliquative Di∣arrhoea;
acid Substances relieve most
in this Case.</P>
<P>This Disease may happen to pro∣duce
a Cancer, or Schirrus; one can∣not
say that the last is absolutely in∣curable,
because it has been known
by Experience that Grass and fresh
Pasture has cur'd it in Cattle; and
perhaps the express'd Juices of Grass,
<PB N="348" REF="114"/>

<HEAD>Inflammation of the Stomach.</HEAD>
<P>The Symptoms of this Disease are a
vehement, burning, fix'd, pungent
Pain in the Stomach, attended with
a Fever; a great Exacerbation of
this Pain the Moment after swallow∣ing
any thing, succeeded with Vo∣miting;
a painful Hickup, and great
Anxiety. The Causes of these Symp∣toms
are those common to all In∣flammations,
a natural Weakness,
and perhaps Erosion of the Coats
of the Stomach, and acrid Substances
taken as Aliment and Medicines.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="115"/>
If this Disease is not speedily cur'd,
it proves fatal.</P>
<P>It terminates in a Cure by a Reso∣lution
of the morbifick Matter, a
Suppuration, Schirrus, Cancer, but
most commonly in a Gangrene.</P>
<P>Of all Diseases this demands most
a total Abstinence from every thing
that has Acrimony in it, even the
nitrous cooling Salts, which are be∣neficial
in other Inflammations, ir∣ritate
too much; Vomits, all Cor∣dials
of volatile or spicy Substances;
spirituous Liquors are no better than
Poison, and Milk generally curdles;
Aliments must be given frequently,
and by Spoonfuls at a time, for any
Distension increaseth the Inflamma∣tion;
a thin Gruel of Barley, Oat∣meal,
Whey, with very little Sugar,
or Honey, or Chicken-Broth, are
proper Aliments; Whey, emollient
Decoctions, Barley-Water, Emulsions,
are proper Drinks; and it has been
found by Experience, that chalybeat
<PB N="350" REF="116"/>
Waters have been agreeable to the
Stomach even in this inflammatory
State. If there happens an Impost∣hume,
Honey, and even Honey of
Roses, taken inwardly, is a good
Cleanser, and Decoctions of Com∣frey
Roots, healing; speedy and
plentiful Bleeding, Fomentations, and
Clysters, have the same good Effect
as in other inflammatory Distem∣pers.</P>
<P>The same Regimen is necessary in
a Schirrus, or Cancer of the Sto∣mach;
though nothing will be quite
effectual.</P>
<P>The same Regimen is to be ob∣served
in the Inflammation of the
Spleen, Caul, Pancreas.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Inflammation of the Guts.</HEAD>
<P>The Intestines or Guts, most fre∣quently
the small ones, may be in∣flam'd
by any acrid or poisonous
Substance taken inwardly; from any
<PB N="351" REF="117"/>
purulent Matter translated upon them
from some other Part of the Body;
from Bile, extremely acrimonious, by
a violent Tension; from a Convulsion
filling them with Wind.</P>
<P>The Symptoms are a total Stop∣page
of the Passage; a vehement fix'd
burning Pain, irritated by things ta∣ken
inwardly, when any thing touch∣eth
the affected Part, it excites Vo∣miting,
sharp griping Pains, with
Wind in other Parts of the Bowels;
the Consequences of such an Inflam∣mation
are an Ileus, what is com∣monly
called the Twisting of the
Guts, but is really either a Circum∣volution
or Insertion of one part of
the Gut within the other. All these
Symptoms are attended with a Fe∣ver.</P>
<P>It is of the utmost Importance to
know what the Causes of Colicks
are; for as they are various, the Re∣medies
in one Case are quite oppo∣site
and destructive in the other; for
<PB N="352" REF="118"/>
the spicy warm carminative things
which are given in a Colick, from a
phlegmatick or cold Cause, are Poi∣son
in an inflammatory one; they
may be distinguish'd by the Fever,
high Pulse, Thirst, and flame-co∣lour'd
Urine attending the Inflam∣mation,
as to the Heat, tho' it is
great likewise by the Violence of the
Pain, the Extremities grow cold; be∣sides,
there is a sudden Prostration of
the Strength or Weakness attending
this Colick, more than any other.</P>
<P>This Disease admits of a speedy
Remedy, or none, for it ends in an
Ileus, and Mortification of the Bow∣els
very soon.</P>
<P>Besides a copious Bleeding, there
is hardly any other Method but fo∣menting
and relaxing the Bowels by
emollient tepid Liquids, both taken
by the Mouth and by Clysters, in∣jected
hourly; yet it has been known
by Experience, that Acids have re∣lieved
in very desperate Cases, as
<PB N="353" REF="119"/>
Juice of Limons taken by the Mouth,
and Vinegar and warm Water given
in Clysters, have sav'd the Patient,
because of the incessant Vomiting;
Opiats to quiet the Convulsions are
sometimes necessary.</P>
<P>Warm Fomentations even of warm
Animals to the Belly, are extremely
beneficial.</P>
<P>If the Inflammation happens to
be in the lower Guts, it is not so
dangerous; and even when it suppu∣rates,
it admits of a Cure, then it
can be reach'd by proper Medicines
in the Form of Clysters; in the lat∣ter
end of such a Case Chalybeat Wa∣ters
are beneficial.</P>
<P>If the Patient survives three Days,
the Acuteness of the Pain abates,
and a Chilliness or Gruing affects
the Body, it betokens a Suppuration,
and in a few Days the Matter flows
either into the Cavity of the Abdo∣men,
producing all the Symptoms
which happen in the Imposthumation
<PB N="354" REF="120"/>
of the Liver, or into the Cavity of
the Intestines, and causing a puru∣lent
Bloody-Flux, and often a Con∣sumption,
<HI>Sinus's, Fistulas.</HI></P>
<P>Whey and Chalybeat Waters are
often beneficial in such a Case, as
Drinks.</P>
<P>The Aliment ought to be of such
things as generate little or no Excre∣ments,
as Broths of Flesh-Meat, with
Scorzonera, Parsley, or Fennel boil'd
in them; Goats Whey is likewise ex∣cellent;
fat and oily Substances ge∣nerally
hurt.</P>
<P>The Continuance of the Fever,
clammy Sweats, Paleness, an ichorose
Diarrhoea, foetid, black, or like the
Washings of Flesh, a small intermit∣ting
Pulse, and at last a total Cessa∣tion
of Pain, are Signs of a Gan∣grene
and approaching Death.</P>
<P>If none of the foremention'd things
happen, if the Fever abates, and the
Patient complains of a Weight, dull
Pain, Stoppage of the Excrements,
<PB N="355" REF="121"/>
a Schirrus is forming, which increas∣eth
daily, and may terminate in a
Cancer, which Purging, and indeed
all Medicines irritate; the Patient in
such a Case may protract a miserable
Life with an exact thin Diet of Whey,
Broths, and such things as produce
no Foeces, or by alimentary Clysters.</P>

<P>By this Name are call'd small,
round, superficial, Ulcerations, which
appear first in the Mouth, but as
they proceed from the Obstruction
of the Emissaries of the Saliva, by
the Lentor and Viscosity of the Hu∣mour,
they may affect every Part of
the alimentary Duct, except the thick
Guts; they often succeed Fevers, es∣pecially
those that inflame the Inte∣stines,
or are attended with a Loose∣ness;
and they are just the same in
the inward Parts as Scabs in the Skin,
and fall off from the Inside of the

approach to a white Colour, the less
dangerous.</P>
<P>The viscous Matter is to be push'd
out, therefore Bleeding in the begin∣ning
is not proper, nor Sudorificks,
because they thicken; but Sweating
is beneficial, when the Matter is quite
push'd out; tepid, diluent and small
Liquors are good in the first State,
and Bathing, if the Patient can bear
it, with Gargarisms, Clysters; after∣wards
the Food ought to be nourish∣ing,
detergent, Panadas with Bread
and Water, Bread and Milk, Ho∣ney
mix'd with the Aliment, when

<HEAD>Inflammations of the Kidneys.</HEAD>
<P>The Kidneys are subject to Inflam∣mations
as much as other Parts of
the Body.</P>
<P>A pungent Pain in the Region
of the Kidneys, a Stupor, or dull
Pain in the Thigh, Colick, Wind,
Vomiting, a Fever, Urine some∣times
totally suppress'd, in small
Quantity, high colour'd; and which is
worse, sometimes quite pale, with∣out
any Sediment, are Symptoms of
an Inflammation of the Kidneys; as
to the Sensation of outward Heat,
the Extremity of Pain often creates a
Coldness in the Extremities, but such
a Sensation is very consistent with an
inflammatory Distemper.</P>
<P>Whatever obstructs the Blood in
the Extremities of the Arteries of the
Kidneys, will produce this Disease;
a Wound, Abscess, Bruise, Swelling,
Lying much on the Back, too vio∣lent
<PB N="358" REF="124"/>
Motion, especially walking in
hot Weather; whatever obstructs the
Passage of the Urine, as a viscous
Matter, Gravel or Stone; every thing
which drives the Blood into the Uri∣nary
Canals, Heat, hard Riding, too
great Fulness of Blood, but especially
sharp and forcing Diureticks: Last∣ly,
Spasms and involuntary Contrac∣tions
of the Vessels of the Kidneys.</P>
<P>Coffee-colour'd Urine is not a dan∣gerous
Symptom; it proceeds indeed
from a Mixture of a small Quantity
of Blood with the Urine, but often
prognosticates a Resolution of the
obstructing Matter, and the Expul∣sion
of Gravel or a Stone after great
Pain; pale Urine is a Symptom of
a more lasting and dangerous Di∣sease.</P>
<P>After plentiful Bleeding, and a
careful avoiding of all stimulating
Diureticks, which in this State of the
Disease will increase it, the Expul∣sion
of the obstructing Cause must
<PB N="359" REF="125"/>
be promoted by emollient and soft
Liquors drank plentifully, by Cly∣sters
of the same frequently injected,
by Bathing and outward Fomenta∣tions,
by opiat and anodyne Sub∣stances,
which stupify and relax the
Fibres; those Liquors must be swal∣low'd
down notwithstanding the con∣tinual
Vomiting; for Vomiting is
the Instrument of Nature to promote
the Expulsion of the Stone Gravel,
or other obstructing Cause.</P>
<P>Whey, and in a great feverish
Heat, Butter-Milk, Emulsions of
Barley and Poppy Seeds, Honey in
Whey and Water, are proper Liquors
for this Intention.</P>
<P>When the Gravel, Stone, or other
obstructing Cause is separated from
the Kidney, soft express'd Oils, and
oily Substances relax the Passages; if
the Pain proceeds only from Gravel,
or a Stone, oily Substances may be
join'd safely with stimulating Sub∣stances,
as with Juice of Limon, Ju∣niper-Water,
<PB N="360" REF="126"/>
and some diuretick Syr∣rup;
this by the way, for it is out
of my present Subject.</P>
<P>Violent Motion, as jolting in a
Coach, may be us'd in this Case.</P>
<P>The Pain protracted beyond seven
Days, a Pulsation, Chillness, often
and irregularly returning, a Heaviness
and Stupor in the Part, are Signs of
making of Matter, which when
made will appear in the Urine.</P>
<P>In which Case soft and balsamick
Substances are beneficial, for if the
Matter stays long, the Case is incu∣rable.</P>
<P>It happens sometimes to end in a
Fistula, with which the Patient may
live many Years in no great Uneasi∣finess.
Butter-Milk, not very sour,
has been reckon'd a great Secret in
Ulcers of the Kidneys, and Chalybeat
Waters have been beneficial to some;
Spruce Beer is a good Balsamick in
such a Case: I should advise soft Malt
Liquors rather than Wine.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="127"/>
Inflammations of the Kidneys
sometimes end in a Schirrus, or great
Stone in the Kidneys.</P>
<P>A sudden Remission of the Pain,
with cold Sweats, weak and inter∣mitting
Pulse, Hickup; no Urine,
or in small Quantity, black and foe∣tid,
are Signs of a Mortification and
approaching Death.</P>
<P>The Regimen of such as are sub∣ject
to nephritick Symptoms may be
in some measure taken from what is
above-mentioned.</P>
<P>Such ought to be extremely care∣ful
of the choice of their Liquors;
sharp Wines which abound with
Tartar, are hurtful; Malt Liquors,
not hard, nor stale, are certainly bet∣ter
to make use of; some of the
softest Diureticks mentioned <HI>Chap.</HI> I.

<HEAD>Apoplexy.</HEAD>
<P>This Disease is a sudden Abolition
of all the Senses, external and inter∣nal,
and of all voluntary Motion, by
the Stoppage of the Flux or Reflux
of the Animal Spirits through the
Nerves destin'd for those Motions,
commonly attended with a strong
Pulse, laborious Breathing, a deep
Sleep with Snorting.</P>
<P>There is no difference between a
Person asleep, and in an Apoplexy,
but that the one can be awak'd, and
the other cannot.</P>
<P>The Causes of this Disease are a
particular Confirmation of the Body,
as a short Neck; for there be some
who have fewer Vertebrae in their
Necks than others; long-necked Peo∣ple
are subject to Consumptions, and
short-neck'd to Apoplexies, tho' this
Rule is not generally true; a gross, ple∣thorick,
fat, phlegmatick Constitu∣tion;
<PB N="363" REF="129"/>
whatever hinders the Motion
of the Blood through the Arteries of
the Brain, as polypose Concretions,
especially about the Heart, attended,
commonly with an unequal Pulse, a
Vertigo, and sometimes a momenta∣ry
Loss of the Eye-sight; an inflam∣matory
and coreaceous Thickness of
the Blood, preceded by a Fever, at∣tended
with the Head-ach, Redness
of the Face and Eyes; Old Age, at∣tended
with a glutinous, cold, ca∣tarrhous,
leucophlegmatick Constitu∣tion;
in such, the Forerunners of
an Apoplexy are Dulness, Inactivity,
Drowsiness, Sleepiness, Slowness of
Speech and giving Answers, Verti∣goes,
Tremblings, Oppressions in
Sleep, Night-Mares; Weakness, Wa∣teryness,
and Turgidity of the Eyes;
pituitous Vomiting, laborious Breath∣ing
upon the smallest Motion; what∣ever
compresseth the Vessels of the
Brain so as to stop the Flux of the
animal Spirits and Blood; a great
<PB N="364" REF="130"/>
Fulness of Blood with its Velocity,
increas'd by Heat, violent Motion,
a high Diet, spirituous Liquors, Tu∣mours
of any kind; within the Skull
a partial and imperfect Circulation
of the Blood towards the lower
Parts. The Effusion and Pressure of
any Serosity or Blood upon the Ven∣tricles
of the Brain (which is the
most common and immediate Cause
of Apoplexies) violent Passions and
Affections of the Mind. The im∣mediate
Forerunners of an Apo∣plexy
are commonly a Vertigo,
Staggering, Loss of Memory, Stu∣por,
Sleepiness, a Noise in the Ears,
and a more deep and laborious
Breathing; those last Symptoms com∣monly
precede an Apoplexy, but
they are likewise common to it with
other nervous and hysterical Distem∣pers.</P>
<P>Attention to the foremention'd
Symptoms affords the best Cautions
and Rules of Diet by way of Pre∣vention;
<PB N="365" REF="131"/>
for when it has taken place
<HI>Hippocrates</HI>'s Prognostick is generally
true, That it is very hard to resolve
a small Apoplexy, and quite impos∣sible
to resolve a great one, the gen∣tlest
Kind of this Disease is often ta∣ken
off by Sweating.</P>
<P>The Applications in the Fit are
of the Medicinal Kind, it being too
acute a Disease to admit of any Helps
from Diet, but that may be of great
use for Prevention; a thin, slender,
cool, regular Diet, opposite to the
particular Symptoms above-men∣tion'd;
frequent and copious Bleed∣ing;
keeping the Belly always open;
stimulating Substances, which have
been thought beneficial, in this Case
very often hurt, by forcing the Blood
too much up to the Head; Vomit∣ing
may prove extremely pernicious,
but the Regimen is to be varied ac∣cording
to the Cause of the Disease,
which may be collected from the
Constitution of the Patient in these
<PB N="366" REF="132"/>
Apoplexies, which depend upon a
sanguineous Cause: The Regimen
prescrib'd in sanguineous Constitu∣tions
is proper; fat and phlegma∣tick
People, who are very subject to
this Disease, ought to attend to the
Rules prescribed in their Case; and
as there are Apoplexies from invete∣rate
Gouts, the Regimen of such
must be different from both, the
Intention being to translate the mor∣bifick
Matter upon the Extremities of
the Body.</P>
<P>Those who have a Disposition to
this Disease ought never to go to
Bed with a full Stomach, nor to lie
with their Head low.</P>
<P>An Apoplexy is resolv'd by a Fe∣ver,
and when not fatal terminates in
a Palsy.</P>
<P>There is a Disease of the same
Kind, but not so frequent, call'd a
Catalepsis, wherein the Patient is
suddenly seiz'd without Sense or Mo∣tion,
and remains in the same Po∣sture
<PB N="367" REF="133"/>
in which the Disease seizeth
him, the Muscles remaining in the
same Tension: Violent Fevers in
strong atrabilarious dry Constitutions
has produc'd this Distemper; the
Diet after the Fit is off ought to be
moistening and relaxing. A Lethar∣gy
is a lighter sort of Apoplexy,
and demands the same Cure and
Diet as an Apoplexy from a phleg∣matick
Case, such being the Consti∣tution
of the Lethargick.</P>

<PB N="368" REF="134"/>
Sensation or Feeling is either totally
abolish'd, or dull, with a Sense of

Convulsion in the first; there is an
Ineptitude to Motion from the too

from the Knowledge of its Causes.
Whatever stops either the Flux of the

in the Winter such as are Seden∣tary,
or live upon salted and smoak∣ed
Flesh and Fish, or Quantities of
unfermented farinaceous Vegetables,
and drink bad Water; such as are
Hypochondriacal and Hysterick; and
sometimes such as have taken the
Peruvian Bark, either in great Quan∣tities,
or without proper Evacuations.
From these Causes the best Rules are
taken for Prevention.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="144"/>
Its Symptoms are a spontaneous
Lassitude or Sensation of Weariness,
being unrefresh'd by Sleep, laborious
Breathing upon small Motion, cold
Tumours in the Legs going off and
returning; sometime Paleness, or a
livid Colour of the Countenance;
Spots on the Skin of various Co∣lours,
red, violet-colour'd, yellow,
livid; sometimes an ill Smell in the
Mouth, painful and bleeding Ero∣sions
of the Gums, and by these the
Teeth growing bare and loose; Hae∣morrages
of all kinds, Ulcers; un∣tractable,
especially in the Legs, with
a gangrenous Appearance in the Skin;
the Itch; a dry crusty Eruption, and
sometimes a small degree of Lepro∣sy
in the Skin; the Blood, when let,
black, grumous, the red part without
a due Consistence; the Serum saline,
and of a yellowish Green; wander∣ing
Pains in the Limbs, increasing by
the Warmth of the Bed, sometimes
a feverish Heat.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="145"/>
These Symptoms proceed from an
ill Temperature of the Blood, too
thick or too thin, being of a saline
Constitution, either from an acid,
alkaline, or muriatick Cause, and ac∣cording
to the Cause, demands very
different and oftentimes opposite Re∣medies.
<HI>See</HI> Part First, of acid and
alkaline Constitutions.</P>
<P>The Scurvy of Mariners is gene∣rally
cured by Acids, as all sorts of
ripe Fruits, Limons, Oranges, Butter-Milk;
alkaline Spirits hurt them;
and acid Spirits, as that of Salt,
does them good; when the Symp∣toms
are attended with a Foetor of
any kind, either in the Urine, Mouth,
Breath, with Drought, Heat, Hae∣morrage
of the Gums, or of any
kind, such a Disease will be cur'd
by acescent Substances, and none
better than Whey: In this Scurvy
Chalybeat Waters are generally ef∣fectual.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="146"/>
If the Scurvy be entirely muria∣tick,
proceeding from a Diet of
salt Flesh or Fish, the Vegetables
commonly called Antiscorbutick, as
Water-cresses, Scurvy-Grass, and
Brook-Lime may be given with Suc∣cess,
but tempered with Acids, as
the Juice of Oranges and Limons;
and the Pot-Herbs which are anti∣acid
in this Case are a proper Diet;
but if there be a high degree of
Heat and Inflammation, the hot An∣tiscorbuticks
will do hurt.</P>
<P>If the Patient be pale, cool, with∣out
Thirst, with pale or natural co∣lour'd
Urine, with a previous Diet
of acescent Substances, the Erup∣tions
not of a high inflammatory or
livid Colour, the warm Antiscorbu∣ticks,
animal Diet, and animal Salts,
are proper.</P>
<P>There is great Attention to be
given to the Condition of the
Mouth, Gums, and Teeth, in the
Scurvy, from which the Nature and
<PB N="381" REF="147"/>
Degree of the Disease may be guess'd
at.</P>
<P>Violent Purging always hurts scor∣butick
Constitutions; lenitive Sub∣stances
relieve.</P>
<P>Bleeding is not proper, unless where
the Symptoms are urgent, and the
Case is inflammatory.</P>
<P>A Scurvy, from an alkaline Cause
is more dangerous than from an
Acid.</P>

<HEAD>Cachexy, or ill Habit of Body.</HEAD>
<P>This is likewise a general Word to
express a great Variety of Symptoms;
most commonly it denotes such a
Distemperature of the Humours as
hinders Nutrition, and weakens the
vital and animal Functions, pro∣ceeding
from Weakness of the Fi∣bres,
and an Abuse of the Non∣naturals,
and often from severe acute
Distempers: It sometimes disposeth
to Consumptions, sometimes to Leu∣cophlegmacy,
<PB N="382" REF="148"/>

<HEAD>Consumption pulmonary.</HEAD>
<P>This Disease is a Decay of the
whole Body, from an Ulcer of the
Lungs, the Matter of which is mix'd,
circulates with, and infects the Blood,
and by its Acrimony infects the
whole Mass of the Fluids.</P>
<P>This Disease makes up above a
tenth part of all the <HI>Bills of Mortality</HI>
about <HI>London,</HI> is often the Product
of a scrophulous Constitution, or
King's-Evil, seldom invades after
Thirty Years of Age, may be pre∣vented,
but seldom admits of any
other than a palliative Cure, and is
generally incurable when hereditary,
but easily so when it proceeds from
an accidental Cause.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="149"/>
It is often preceded by a Spitting
of Blood, occasion'd by its Acrimo∣ny,
and too great a projectile Mo∣tion,
with Slenderness and Weakness
of the Vessels; to which Persons of
a fair rosy Complexion, long Neck,
and narrow Chest, are often subject;
Aliment too viscous, obstructing the
Glands, and by its Acrimony cor∣roding
the small Vessels of the Lungs
(an Organ of a slender Texture,
through which the Half of the whole
Blood passeth, and which is never at
rest) after a Rupture and Extravasa∣tion
of Blood, easily producing an
Ulcer, then a small Fever, dry Cough,
Heat, Flushing after Repast; when
the new Chyle enters the Lungs,
short Breath, a Disposition to Sweat
after Sleep; all these Symptoms,
when the Blood is most copious and
hot, between the Ages of 16 and
30; such a Disease may be indue'd
by the Suppression of Evacuations
natural and artificial, by any great
<PB N="384" REF="150"/>
Force upon the Lungs, from some
accidental Cause; by too hot, full,
and acrimonious Meat or Drink, by
some acute Disease, the Meazles or
Small-Pox.</P>
<P>The Blood is ejected from the
Lungs with some small Pain, Heat,
Oppression on the Breast, florid, and
frothing, with short Breathing, and
a small soft quick Pulse.</P>
<P>If after such Haemorrage from the
Lungs, the Symptoms increase, Short∣ness
of Breath, Flushing in the Face,
a Cough, hectick Fever, but especi∣ally
Rigours and Chilliness invading
irregularly, with Weakness, one may
be sure that there is a Suppura∣tion.</P>
<P>In a Haemorrage from the Lungs,
no Remedy so proper as Bleeding,
often repeated; Stypticks are often
insignificant, and if it were possible
that they could operate immediately
upon the affected Part, so far as
to make a Scar, when that fell off
<PB N="385" REF="151"/>
the Disease would return. Both in∣crassating
and styptick Substances
work universally, but they would
hurt the Lungs if given before the
Vessels are empty'd. Balsamick Sub∣stances
often hurt by their too great
Heat.</P>
<P>The Intention here is by Diet to
abate the Acrimony and projectile
Motion of the Blood, after repeated
Bleeding; to keep strictly to a Milk
Diet, with farinaceous Substances, as
Rice and Barley, Milk with roasted
Apples, Jelly of Currants, or the
Jelly of any ripe subacid Fruit, which
is cooling, and very agreeable to
the Stomach; Milk and common
Water, or Barley-Water, for Drink,
taking the Aliment frequently, and
in very small Quantities, for fear of
charging the Lungs with too great
a Quantity of Chyle at a time. (<HI>See
Part</HI> I. <HI>Chap.</HI> II.) Avoiding all vio∣lent
Motion, or any thing that puts
the Lungs upon a Stretch. Acri∣mony
<PB N="386" REF="152"/>
is likewise corrected by oily
Vegetables, not such as contain a
volatile or high exalted Oil, but
those whose Oil is mild, as Almonds,
Pistachos, Dates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> Consumptions, gene∣rally
speaking, proceed from a scro∣phulous
Disposition; in the first Ac∣cess
of such a Disease any Substance
which is deobstruent, without much
Acrimony, is beneficial, but what
heats disposeth to Suppuration.</P>
<P>There is likewise a Consumption
from an Empyema, after an Inflam∣mation
of the Lungs, which may
be known from a Weight upon the
Diaphragm, Oppression of the Lungs,
a Difficulty of Breathing, and Ina∣bility
to lie on one Side (which is
that which is found) a perpetual
Cough and Fever, with Thirst, Flush∣ing
of the Cheeks, Weakness, and
Decay of Appetite.</P>
<P>The Cure of such a Case is chi∣rurgical,
by opening the Side; if the
<PB N="387" REF="153"/>
Ulcer is not broke, it is com∣monly
call'd a Vomica, attended with
almost the same Symptoms as an
Empyema, because the Vomica com∣municating
with the Vessels of the
Lungs must necessarily void some of
the putrid Matter into these Vessels,
and taint the Blood.</P>
<P>The Ulcer may break suddenly in∣to
the Larynx, with the danger of
Suffocation; or inwardly, and the
Matter may by degrees be expectora∣ted.
The Event of the Disease de∣pends
upon the Symptoms, especi∣ally
the Nature of the Pus; that
which swims in Water, without any
ill Smell, is better than what sinks,
is livid, and smells of putrify'd
Flesh.</P>
<P>There may be a Consumption
with a purulent Spitting, when the
Vomica is contain'd in a Cyst or
Bag, upon the breaking of which
the Patient is commonly suffocated.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="154"/>
In this Case the same Intentions
must be pursued in the Diet, as in
a Wound or any other Ulcer. The
Aliment cool, demulcent, vulnera∣ry,
and not drying or hot, but con∣sisting
of Quantities of liquid things,
even though they provoke Sweat. It
is a common Mistake that acid things
hurt the Lungs. The Gas Sulphuris
may be given with Success in any
Disease of the Lungs, but at some
distance of Time from Milk, Vine∣gar,
and Honey, is proper and deter∣gent;
anodyne Substances relieve the
Cough; gentle Exercise by Riding,
is beneficial; by an extremely exact
Regimen a consumptive Person may
hold out for Years, if the Symptoms
are not violent.</P>
<P>The Sweats and Diarrhoea attend∣ing
Consumptions are generally fatal
Symptoms, but must be reliev'd by
a Diet proper in these Cases, not in∣terfering
with what is formerly ad∣vis'd.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="155"/>
Consumptions are induc'd by Pu∣rulency
in any of the other Viscera;
the Regimen must be very near the
same as in the Pulmonary.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Dropsy.</HEAD>
<P>This Disease is commonly an Ex∣travasation
of Serum receiv'd in some
Cavity of the Body; I say com∣monly,
for there may be a Dropsy
by a Dilatation of the serous Ves∣sels,
as that in the Ovarium, where∣in
the very Membrane of the Ovum
is extended with the Water, and at
the same time thickened so as to
keep it from Rupture.</P>
<P>Therefore this Disease may happen
wherever there are serous Vessels; a
Hydrocephalous, or Dropsy of the
Head, which is only incurable when
the Serum is extravasated into the
Ventricles of the Brain, and gene∣rally
fatal in Infants, when the Su∣tures
<PB N="390" REF="156"/>
are clos'd, and the Skull will
yield no more.</P>
<P>A Dropsy of the Breast is attend∣ed
with almost the same Symptoms
as an Empyema, and cur'd by the
same Chirurgery.</P>
<P>A Dropsy of the Lungs, either by
Hydatides, or by Lymph, extrava∣sated
in the Body of the Lungs.</P>
<P>A Dropsy in the Forepart of the
Windpipe, emulating a Bronchocele.</P>
<P>A Dropsy in the Ovarium, <HI>Testes,
Scrotum,</HI> or <HI>Uterus.</HI></P>
<P>An Ascites, or Collection of Wa∣ter
in the Abdomen. 1. In the Du∣plicature
of the Peritonaeum. 2. Be∣tween
the Peritonaeum and the Bow∣els.
3. When the Water is contain∣ed
in the membranaceous Coat of
the Glands.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Air is so rarify'd
in the Tumour as makes it hard and
tight like a Drum, and from thence
it is call'd a Tympany; when the Ten∣sion
<PB N="391" REF="157"/>
is from Air, it is easily distin∣guish'd
by the Specifick Gravity of
the Patient, and so is Water.</P>
<P>When the Lymph stagnates, or is
extravasated under the Skin, it is cal∣led
an Anasarka.</P>
<P>Whatever hinders the Return of
the Lymph into the Veins, or breaks
the lymphatick Vessels, or obstructs
the absorbent Vessels, so as the
Lymph cannot be absorb'd or ex∣hal'd,
produceth a Dropsy: Any
Stoppage of the Circulation will pro∣duce
a Dropsy, as by strong Liga∣ture,
or Compression.</P>
<P>The most common of these Causes
are an hereditary Disposition; swil∣ling
down great Quantities of cold
watery Liquors, which are not void∣ed;
violent acute Distempers; stub∣born
Obstructions of the Viscera;
the Jaundice, obstinate intermitting
Fevers, Bloody-Fluxes; great Evacu∣ations,
especially of Blood; Aliment
<PB N="392" REF="158"/>
viscous and of hard Digestion; inve∣terate
Scurvies; but the most com∣mon
of all is the habitual and co∣pious
Use of fermented and spiritu∣ous
Liquors.</P>
<P>The Effects are a Swelling of the
Legs at Night by degrees, still as∣cending
higher; a Swelling of the
Belly increasing; and in a Tympany
founding and tense like a Drum;
sometimes the Sensation and Noise
of fluctuating Water, Shortness of
Breath, Thirst, Urine in too small
Quantity, no Sweat; The stagnating
Serum at last turning acrimonious,
exulcerates and putrifies the Bow∣els,
producing most dismal Symp∣toms.</P>
<P>The best Cautions and Rules of
Diet may be taken from the Enu∣meration
of these Causes and Ef∣fects.</P>
<P>The Intentions to be pursued
are, removing the Causes, as Ob∣structions,
<PB N="393" REF="159"/>
dissolving the Viscosity or
Tenacity of the Lymph, and eva∣cuating
it out of the Body.</P>
<P>The Viscosity of the Lymph is
best corrected by such Substances as
contain abundance of alkaline and
volatile Salts, Spices, acrimonious
pungent Vegetables, saponaceous Sub∣stances;
what they are the Reader
may see Chap, I. of this Part.</P>
<P>The only Contradiction to this is
too great Heat and Thirst, to which
Regard is to be had, and do indi∣cate
the Use of Acids, Juice of Li∣mons,
Oranges, Sorrel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I
think it may be taken for a general
Rule, when the Urine is high-colour'd,
that Acids are proper, for they are
opposite to that alkalescent State of
the Humours, and resist the Putre∣faction,
which is the Effect of acri∣monious
Serum.</P>
<P>The Drink should be sparing; but
forasmuch as the Thirst is sometimes
intolerable, the Patient may be in∣dulg'd
<PB N="394" REF="160"/>
the free Use of Spaw-Water
and Rhenish Wine.</P>
<P>The Aliment should be dry, diu∣retick.
<HI>See Chap.</HI> I. Diureticks of
the acid Kind are the safest.</P>
<P>The Chirurgical Operations for
drawing off the Waters are to be
left to the Judgment of the Physi∣cian.</P>
<P>Nothing is more beneficial than
strong Frictions of the Skin, which
attenuate and promote the Circula∣tion
of the stagnating Serum.</P>
<P>Vomiting, in strong Constitu∣tions,
has prov'd often very effec∣tual,
for the Concussion of the solid
Parts dissolves and dispels the stagna∣ting
Humours; and even Clysters of
proper Ingredients are very benefi∣cial.</P>
<P>Violent Purgers, by dissolving the
Blood, have prov'd often pernicious.</P>
<P>Many have been cur'd by Absti∣nence
from Drink, eating dry Bis∣cuit,
which creates no Thirst, and
<PB N="395" REF="161"/>
strong Frictions four or five times a
Day.</P>
<P>When the extravasated Serum is
evacuated, the Diet ought to be such
as strengthens the solid Parts, allow∣ing
Spices and generous Wine, and
especially the Use of Chalybeat Wa∣ters,
Abstinence from other Sorts of
Liquids, dry Food and Vegetables,
astringent, Exercise, especially Riding;
and in general, such a Diet as ge∣nerates
good Blood.</P>
<P>If the Serum stagnates long, it
turns acrimonious, and commonly
renders the Patient feverish and thirsty.
Acid or sour things are the properest
both to prevent and cure these Symp∣toms,
as they are opposite to that
alkaline Putrefaction.</P>

<HEAD>Gout.</HEAD>
<P>This is a Disease which may affect
any membranous Part, but common∣ly
those which are at the greatest
<PB N="396" REF="162"/>
Distance from the Heart or the Brain,
where the Motion of the Fluids is the
slowest, the Resistance, Friction, and
Stricture of the solid Parts the great∣est,
and the Sensation of Pain by the
Obstruction of the small Vessels and
Dilaceration of the nervous Fibres ex∣treme.</P>
<P>The most common Seat of it is
in the Foot, its Tendons, Nerves,
Membranes, Ligaments, and Perio∣stea,
or Membranes investing the
Bones.</P>
<P>The most common Causes of it
are an hereditary Disposition (which
operates more strongly in this Dis∣ease
than in any other) a too rich
and high Diet, and too copious Use
of Wine and other spirituous Li∣quors,
especially at Supper; Excess
in some other Pleasures; a full gross
Habit of Body; the too copious use
of acid or sour things, the Gout be∣ing
the only Disease in which they
are very hurtful to Human Bodies; a
<PB N="397" REF="163"/>
sudden chilling of the Feet after
Sweat, or drying them at the Fire
after being wet and cold; a seden∣tary
Life, with a plentiful Diet, and
intense Study, and Application of the
Mind; most commonly a Gouty
Constitution is attended with great
Acuteness of Parts, the nervous Fi∣bres
both in the Brain and the other
Extremities being delicate; and there
are Instances where Wives have got
it from their Husbands by Infection,
so <HI>Boerhaave</HI> says; Females and young
People are not subject to this Disease,
unless where it is hereditary.</P>
<P>A proper Regimen of Diet is ne∣cessary
in this Distemper, because it
does not admit of very many Helps
from Medicines, and there are no
better Rules than Abstinence from
those things which occasion it.</P>
<P>It seems to be a Disease of the
nervous Parts, which makes it so hard
to cure; Diseases are so as they are
more remote in the Thread of the
<PB N="398" REF="164"/>
Motion of the Fluids, by the con∣stant
and regular Returns of it in
some People, and their Freedom from
it after the Morbid Matter is ex∣hausted;
it looks as there were regu∣lar
Accumulations and Gatherings of
it, as of other Humours in the Bo∣dy,
growing perhaps in some People
as Corns.</P>
<P>As one of the Causes of the Gout
is the Suppression of Sweat and Per∣spiration,
the procuring a due de∣gree
of these seems to be the best Pre∣ventive
of it; if the Feet could be
made to sweat, in due time it would
prevent the Gout, which invades in
such Constitutions of the Air as sup∣press
Perspiration.</P>
<P>Violent Purging, in Absence of
the Paroxysm, by agitating the Hu∣mours
often hurts, and during the
Paroxysm, may draw the Gout in∣wardly.</P>
<P>The best Diet is Abstinence from
acid Substances; the moderate use of
<PB N="399" REF="165"/>
such as promote Perspiration, as Sub∣stances
aromatical, and volatile Salts,
which relieve the Gouty, as they
make the Body perspirable; diluent
Liquors, taken in such a degree as
not to hurt the Stomach; Modera∣tion
in the Quantity of Food and
spirituous Liquors; Exercise without
Fatigue; but especially Frictions of
the extreme Parts, daily, and often
repeated; all possible Methods of
making the Feet sweat, and much
Sleep.</P>
<P>In the Paroxysm, as temperate
and cool, and diluent a Diet as the
Patient can bear; Abstinence from
Opiats, except when the morbid
Matter is separating (by Opiats any
Irruption goes on better) the constant
Use of them will hurt; keeping the
affected Part warm, without the Ap∣plication
of Cataplasms, ev'n such as
are emollient, weaken and relax too
much, and have been sometimes
found to distort the Parts.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="166"/>
It is of the utmost Importance to
know if any Disease proceeds from
a Translation of the Gouty Matter;
for the Methods, especially Evacu∣ations,
us'd in an original Dis∣ease,
would be very improper in a
Gouty Case, where the Intention must
be to draw the Gout down to the
Feet, by Blisters apply'd to the Thighs
or Legs, and acrid inflammatory Ca∣taplasms
and Plaisters; therefore when
any Gouty Person is disappointed of
a Paroxysm which he expected by
the Season, or the previous Symp∣toms,
and instead of it is seiz'd with
another Disease, let him speedily
consult his Physician.</P>
<P>If a Gouty Person can bring him∣self
intirely to a Milk Diet, he may
so change the whole Juices of his Bo∣dy
as to eradicate the Distemper.</P>
<P>The Approach of a Fit of the
Gout is easily known by the inward
Disorders, as Wind, Sickness, Cru∣dities
in the Stomach, a Drowsiness,
<PB N="401" REF="167"/>
these join'd with the Season or Wea∣ther,
if such a one by a statical En∣gine

Perspiration, he might often by re∣storing

will occasion Astriction of the Belly,
with a Swelling; Worms will perfo∣rate
the Guts.</P>
<P>Children subject to Worms ought
not to live much upon Milk, Cheese,
or ripe Fruits, nor take much Su∣gar;
some Insects lay their Eggs in
Sugar.</P>
<P>The Gall of Animals, and Mer∣cury,
kill Worms, and destroy their
Nests; it is found by Experience
that the Water in which Mercury is
boil'd has this Effect; all Bitters a∣mong
alimentary Substances; Honey
and Oil given by the Mouth, or
Clysters, have a good Effect; they
may be taken together fasting; any
Substance which by its Pungency
can wound the Worms, will kill
them, as Steel, Hartshorn, Cora∣line,
Coral powdered, Fish Bones.

Above a tenth Part of Infants
die in Teething, by Symptoms pro∣ceeding
from the Irritation of the
tender nervous Parts of the Jaws,
occasioning Inflammations, Fevers,
Convulsions, Looseness, with green
Stools (not the worst Symptom) and
in some, Gangrenes: It is plain that
such a Case ought to be treated
as any other inflammatory Distemper.</P>
<P>When the Symptoms of Teeth∣ing
appear, the Gums ought to be
relax'd by softening Ointment, the
Jaws fomented with emollient De∣coctions,
and the whole Head to be
kept warm; when the Teeth is rea∣dy
to cut, the upper Part rubb'd
with hard Substances, which Infants
by a natural Instinct affect, and
when there is a manifest Tension
of the Gum by the Tooth, then it
ought to be cut; but this Operation
ought not to be perform'd too soon.</P>
<P><PB N="409" REF="175"/>
In the Convulsions it is necessary
to give volatile Spirits, which they
can bear better than when they are
new-born.</P>
<P>The Rickets is another Disease to
which Children are subject: It has
been reckoned a Disease unknown
to the Ancients, uncommon in hot
Countries, and more common in
<HI>England</HI> than any other Northern
Country.</P>
<P>Children have this Disease from
sickly Parents, and especially from
Mothers of a weak lax Constitution,
living on a various, high, and plen∣tiful
Diet, without Exercise; and
Children born healthy, often con∣tract
the Disease from an unwholsome
Nurse.</P>
<P>A Diet of farinaceous Substances
infermented, as of Pudding, much
Butter, wet or ill-air'd Linen, cuta∣neous
Eruptions repell'd, or ill cur'd,
exposing their lower Parts too long
<PB N="410" REF="176"/>
to cold Air, may bring, or at least
increase this Disease.</P>
<P>The Disease may be foreseen by
the Child's being long in taking to
his Feet; when it takes place the
Child grows lean, the muscular Flesh
decays, and grows flabby, the Skin
loose and flaccid, the Epiphyses of
the Bones about the Joints of the
Arms grow big, the Belly swells, the
Blood-Vessels about the Neck en∣large,
and so does the Head it self,
the Bones grow crooked; these are
the outward Appearances, the Con∣stitution
of the inward Parts is often
much worse.</P>
<P>It is highly probable that this Dis∣ease
proceeds from a redundant Aci∣dity,
because Vinegar will soften and
crook tender Bones; and this Symp∣tom
must happen in Children when
there is no Strength in the Muscles
to support them, or they must be
inflected to that Side where the
<PB N="411" REF="177"/>
Muscle pulls strongest. Contrary to
the common Rules for the Aliment
of Children, the Diet of those that
are Rickety ought to be moderately
warm, even making use of Spices
or carminative Seeds. They ought
to forbear unfermented farinaceous
Substances, new Bread; and rather
use Biscuit. Their Diet should be
pretty much of flesh Meat, such as
are commonly call'd White Meats,
and rather roasted than boil'd, such
Diet being anti-acid. They may
be allow'd a moderate Quantity of
Wine.</P>
<P>I knew a rickety Child cur'd by
a very great Indulgence of fermen∣ted
Liquors, but it is not an Experi∣ment
that I would advise.</P>
<P>Frictions of the Back-bone and
Joints with Flannel, smoak'd with pe∣netrating
aromatical Substances, and
fomenting the Joints with old Malaga
Wine, have prov'd often very effec∣tual.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="178"/>
They ought to use as much Exer∣cise
as they are capable of, but espe∣cially
by Voiture or Carriage. Care
must be taken to open the Obstruc∣tions
in the lower Belly by Vomits
and proper Purgations, where the
Seat of the Disease chiefly lies, and
after that the Cold Bath is a very
proper and effectual Remedy.</P>
<P>I have lanch'd out of my Sub∣ject
under this Head, mentioning
some medicinal Helps, because the
Nurses in such Cases are often the
Physicians, which nevertheless they
ought not to be when they can get
better Advice.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Small-Pox.</HEAD>
<P>Though I took notice of this
Disease in the Article of Feverish
Irruptions, yet it being one of the
most dangerous and universal that
infests Mankind, I shall add a few
<PB N="413" REF="179"/>
more Rules which may be of use to
such as have not the Advice of an
able Physician.</P>
<P>The greatest and most important
Strokes for the Recovery of the Pa∣tient,
must be made at the time of
the Invasion, or first State of this
Disease; therefore it is necessary to
know the first Symptoms of it; ma∣ny
have suffer'd by mistaking it for
another Disease.</P>
<P>In general, young Persons who
have not had the Disease ought to
be extremely careful to avoid great
Irregularities in their Diet, because
the Small-pox which are occasion'd
by such often prove dangerous.
This Disease is likewise more dan∣gerous
as the Fluids are more ex∣alted
and dissipated, and the So∣lids
more strict and compacted, and
consequently more so as People are
advanc'd in Age.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="180"/>
This Disease may be easily com∣municated
by the Contagion or
Steams of an infected Person swim∣ming
in the Air, and drawn in by
the Breath, or perhaps by the Pores
of the Skin; and it is evident by
Inoculation that the smallest Quanti∣ty
of the Matter mix'd with the
Blood produceth the Disease, tho'
not so quickly as those volatile
Steams.</P>
<P>The first Symptoms are a Chil∣ness,
Rigor, succeeded by a Fever
and constant Heat, a certain Splen∣dor
or Shining in the Eyes, with a
little moisture; this is very observable
in Children; a great Pain in the
Head, with Dulness, Drowsiness,
Sleepiness, a pain in the Back in
some, but Pains in the Limbs in all,
Anxiety, Inquietude, notwithstand∣ing
their Drowsiness, Loathing,
Sickness of the Stomach, Vomiting,
and in Infants Convulsions shortly
<PB N="415" REF="181"/>
before the Eruption. The Blood let
the first time, florid; after a second
time sizy.</P>
<P>It is evident that in this State the
Disease ought to be treated as any
other inflammatory Distemper, by
such Methods as if it were possible
to hinder any Suppuration at all,
and to resolve and digest as much
of the feverish Matter as we can;
for the longer the Eruption is a com∣ing,
and the smaller when it comes,
the Disease is less dangerous; there∣fore
all the Methods prractis'd in
the beginning of inflammatory Dis∣eases
are here necessery, with a par∣ticular
Care of cleansing the ali∣mentary
Duct by Vomiting and
Clysters, the Impurities of which
will be carried into the Blood.</P>
<P>There is not yet found any par∣ticular
Antidote to the poisonous
Stimulus of this Distemper; the
learned <HI>Boerhaave</HI> is of opinion,
<PB N="416" REF="182"/>
that if any such could be found, it
must be in Antimony, or Mercury
intirely destitute of all Acrimony:
The Effects of Mercury on all Ul∣cerations
are very manifest.</P>
<P>Bleeding, which is extremely use∣ful
in the beginning of the Disease,
is not so proper and useful when it
is advanc'd.</P>
<P>In the first Stage the whole Ha∣bit
of the Body ought to be re∣lax'd,
a free Perspiration thro' the
Skin, without violent Sweating, pro∣moted;
the Viscosity or Toughness
of the Fluids taken off by diluents;
the alkalescent State of the Salts cor∣rected;
all these things are effected
by emollient Fomentations apply'd
inwardly in Clysters, and why not
outwardly to the Skin? Such are
us'd successfully in other Eruptions,
as Erysipelas, Shingles, by a slender
Diet of Decoctions of farinaceous
Vegetables, and copious drinking
<PB N="417" REF="183"/>
of cooling Liquors, with nitrous
and acid Salts, and other acid Sub∣stances,
mix'd with them; no Flesh,
unless it be small Chicken-Broth;
no Spice; the Air ought not to
be spoil'd by Heat, nor the Cover∣ings
of the Bed so thick as to pro∣mote
Sweat.</P>
<P>The Greatness and Danger of
this Disease is estimated by the Quan∣tity
of Eruptions on the Face and
other Parts of the Head; therefore
the Matter ought to be solicited by
all possible Methods to the lower
Parts, especially the Legs, by Fo∣mentations,
Bathing, Epispasticks,
Blistering, and through the whole
Disease keeping the Feet and Legs
warm; the Breast and Head not
any more cover'd than to keep them
from the Impression of cold Air.</P>
<P>During the Filling and Ripening
of the Pustles, the Diet may be
more plentiful, but still not hot or
<PB N="418" REF="184"/>
inflammatory, with the due Use of
anodyne Substances: In this State
Demulcents, or what abates Acri∣mony;
and where the Circumstances
of the Patient require it, a Spoon∣ful
or two of Canary Wine, twice
or thrice a Day, are proper: The
Diet in this State ought likewise to
be adapted to the particular Symp∣toms
of the Disease, as cleansing,
attenuating, expectorating; to pro∣mote
the Spitting, diuretick; when
that is suppress'd, and Clysters dilu∣ent,
without any Stimulus, frequent∣ly
injected, are beneficial in every
Stage of the Disease.</P>
<P>When the Age, Temperament,
high Pulse, and especially a Watch∣fulness
and Delirium, all would seem
to demand it in any other Case,
why not Bleeding in this State?
which I know to have been us'd
with great Success; a great many
Vessels are in this State almost im∣pervious
<PB N="419" REF="185"/>
by the Fluids; those who
die of this Disease have inward In∣flammations,
especially in the Lungs;
those Reasons seem to justify Bleed∣ing.</P>
<P>Indeed the gangrenous Disposi∣tion
which appears in the malig∣nant
Kind, is a Reason against it,
but hardly any thing will do good
in these extremely malignant Cases.</P>
<P>In such malignant Kinds, all that
is left is at last to try evacuating
the morbifick Matter by other ways,
as Epispasticks and Stools procur'd
by lenitive Substances, not irritating,
which would only agitate the Hu∣mours
and increase the Fever.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Gravel, Stone.</HEAD>
<P>A Stone or stony Matter may
grow in any Part of a Human Bo∣dy;
for when any thing insoluble
sticks in any Part of the Body, it
<PB N="420" REF="186"/>
gathers a Crust about it; a small
Drop of concreted Blood may grow
to be a Stone, for by the Evapora∣tion
of the most fluid Parts it
grows hard, and by the Attraction
of new Matter increaseth Blood,
and a Human Calculus, or Stone,
yield the same Contents by Chy∣mical
Trial, tho' in an inverse Or∣der.</P>
<P>These stony Concretions happen
most commonly in the Kidneys and
Bladder; and indeed if the Tartar
and other Contents of the Urine
were not constantly voided, such
Concretions would happen to every
Human Creature; for the Urine of
the most sound Person being in∣spected
with a Microscope, after it
has stood a while, will discover a
black Speck, which is Sand, and
wherever this Sand sticks it grows
still bigger, by the apposition of
new Matter: When such Concre∣tions
<PB N="421" REF="187"/>
happen in the Kidneys, and
are expell'd or drop into the Ure∣ters,
it makes what we call Gra∣vel;
when they lodge and stick in
the Body of the Kidneys, and
grow to such a Bulk as not to
drop into the Pelvis, or pass by
the Ureters, they make the Stone
in the Kidneys: The Symptoms
of which are a dull Pain in the
Kidney, most commonly bloody
Water; upon a sudden Jolt, vio∣lent
Motion, Pain in Stooping; Pain
in the Thigh, Sickness in the Sto∣mach,
Colical Pains, various Changes
in the Colour of the Urine, black,
bloody, pale, occasion'd by some∣thing
sharp or scabrous wounding the
small Blood-Vessels; if the Stone
is smooth and well bedded, per∣haps
this may not happen. Fleshy
Filaments, or Matter voided by
Urine, are suspicious Symptoms of
a Stone in the Kidney, especially
<PB N="422" REF="188"/>
if the Patient has been subject to
Voiding of Gravel.</P>
<P>When a small Stone is lodg'd in
the Body of the Kidney, it does
not create Pain, nor much when it
falls into the Pelvis; but when it
falls into the Ureter, and sticks,
the Pain is most acute; it often
stops at the Flexure and Valve of
the Ureter, and sometimes in the
Urethra, or Passage of the Urine
from the Bladder; while it stays in
the Bladder it creates no Pain, but
remaining there long it grows a
confirm'd Stone, too big to be pass'd
by the Urethra: The manner of
its Concretion is by concentrical
Rings, like an Onion, about the
first Kernel, which shews the Cause
to be Attraction. This is not on∣ly
true of a small Stone, but any
solid Body lodg'd in the Bladder
will make the Kernel of a Stone;
the Experiment of a Bullet's pro∣ducing
<PB N="423" REF="189"/>
this Effect has been try'd
upon a Dog; and such an Acci∣dent
has happen'd to a Man by a
Wound, in which a Bullet has
dropt into the Bladder.</P>
<P>The Symptoms of a Stone in the
Bladder are a Titillation about the
Neck of the Bladder, and the Parts
thereabout; a frequent Needing to
make Water; a Sensation of Weight
in the lower Belly, under the Shear-Bone,
with a great Pain, especially
upon any sudden Motion, which
causeth a Concussion of the Blad∣der,
a Dribling, Difficulty, and a
momentary Suppression of Urine by
the Stone, shutting up the Orifice
of the Bladder, attended with a Te∣nesmus,
or needing to go to Stool,
and a burning Pain in the Urethra;
sometimes a white Mucus in the Urine;
tho' this last Symptom will happen
without a Stone in the Bladder.</P>
<P><PB N="424" REF="190"/>
The Regimen in the Stone in
the Kidneys is by diluent and soft
Diureticks to try to expel it, if it is
small enough to pass; if the Stone
is brittle, it will often crumble and
pass in the Form of Gravel; if the
Stone is too big to pass, the best
Method is to come to a sort of a
Composition or Truce with it; the
Diet ought to be cool and diluent,
as far as possible to hinder its
Growth; to use Diureticks that gent∣ly
resolve, as Parsley, Fennel, Scor∣zonera,
Sassafras, Mallows, and Tea,
Dandelion, Cichory, Oats, Barley,
Honey, Honey and Vinegar; Ni∣trous
Salts, as Spirit of dulcify'd
Nitre; the most soft cooling Dilu∣ent
of all, is Whey; the best Emol∣lients
are Decoctions of Marshmal∣lows,
Linseed-Tea.</P>
<P>Bathing in tepid Water, Clysters,
seasoning the Aliment moderately
with Sea-Salt, for the immoderate
<PB N="425" REF="191"/>
Use of it is resolving and diuretick;
the Belly, in all Cases of the Stone,
ought to be kept lax and open.</P>
<P>In a confirm'd Stone of the Kid∣neys
too violent Exercise is dange∣rous.</P>
<P>During the passing of a Stone,
one should avoid at first all strong
Stimulating; relaxing and lubrica∣ting
the Passages, and quieting the
Spasms by Opiats is certainly the
best Method; and where Bathing
cannot be conveniently had, Ox∣Bladders,
half full of warm Water,
apply'd constantly to the affected
Part may be usefully substituted.
Letting of Blood taketh off a Ten∣sion
better than any thing, and is
very necessary where the Symptoms
are violent; when the Parts are suf∣ficiently
relax'd, stimulating Diure∣ticks
may be us'd more safely, espe∣cially
if associated with Opiats.</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="192"/>
As to Dissolvents of the Stone,
all that have hitherto been propos'd
are chimerical; <HI>Helmont</HI> talks of Bulls
Blood; Goats Blood is rather a bet∣ter
Dissolvent.</P>
<P>The surest way to hinder the
Generation of a Stone, is to pro∣cure
a Diarrhoea by Whey, Broth,
and a liquid Diet; and indeed what
would not one do to prevent so pain∣ful
a Disease?</P>
<P>When the Stone is fallen to the
Bladder, Care should be taken to
make it pass as soon as possible,
for the Reasons above-mention'd;
if all the Symptoms abate without
the passing of the Stone, it is not
certain that the Stone remains in
the Bladder, because a very small
Stone may pass insensibly by Urine;
if the Stone has pass'd, it is not cer∣tain
that the Fit is over, for there are
often more, and the usual Remedies
ought not to be left off.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="193"/>
The Irritations of the Membranes
of the Bladder by a Stone, may be
much mitigated by the Injection of
the Oil of Linseed or Almonds, in∣to
the Bladder.</P>
<P>Such as are subject to the Gravel
or Stone ought to be careful of their
Diet, to use such Aliments as gene∣rate
a small Quantity of Foeces, or
relax the Belly; Aliment demulcent,
as Pease; a Decoction of Chick-Pease
is a Remedy in a Fit of the
Stone; they ought to drink Whey in
the Spring, and take Honey in seve∣ral
Forms, if it agrees with them;
Rice, Barley, Millet, are all good
in this Case; nothing makes Stones
or Gravel pass more easily than
Opiats.</P>
<P>If the Stone sticks in the Ure∣thra,
emollient Fomentation of the
Parts, Oil injected, or in case of
great Extremity, an Instrument
with a Cavity like a small Spoon,
<PB N="428" REF="194"/>
dipt in Oil, may fetch out the
Stone.</P>
<P>The Stone in the Bladder is not
only a painful, but a mortal Dis∣ease,
if not extracted. The Diet of
a Patient in such a Case is such as of
a wounded Person, nourishing, with∣out
Acrimony.</P>
<P>Let the Reader look into the Ar∣ticle
of Inflammations of the Kid∣neys,
where there are some Direc∣tions
proper for all who are subject
to the Stone or Gravel.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Rheumatism.</HEAD>
<P>The Disease seems to be an in∣flammatory
Disposition in the serous
Part of the Blood, affecting the lym∣phatick
Arteries, and therefore af∣fecting
those Parts where the Vessels
are the narrowest. The Blood, as
in other inflammatory Cases, is
sizy, the alkalescent Salts in the Se∣rum
<PB N="429" REF="195"/>
producing coreaceous Concre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons.</P>
<P>The common Methods us'd in
this Case are certainly proper; these
are, repeated Bleedings and Purges,
interposing Anodynes, and gentle
Sudorisicks; and Blisters when the
Pain is obstinate in one Part.</P>
<P>As for the Diet, it ought to be
cool, diluting, and chiefly Vegeta∣ble.</P>
<P>If there be a specifick in Aliment
is certainly Whey; I knew a Per∣son
subject to this Disease who could
never be cur'd by any other Me∣thod
but a Diet of Whey and Bread.
A Milk Diet is likewise effectual for
changing that saline Constitution of
the Serum of the Blood.</P>
<P>Cream of Tartar in Water-Gruel,
taken for several Days, will abate
the Pains and Swellings considerably,
by its Acidity correcting the alka∣lescent
Salts in the Blood.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="196"/>
In obstinate Sciatical Pains, Blis∣tering
and Cauteries have been found
effectual, and the most penetrating
Medicines, especially the ethereal Oil
of Turpentine mix'd with Honey.</P>
<P>I have lanch'd out of my Sub∣ject
in this Article, because of many
common People who cannot always
have good Advice.</P>
