<HEAD>PREFACE to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>IF there is any Thing, in my Writings, that de∣serves to be remember'd, They will <HI>live,</HI> with∣out Patronage: If They ought to be forgotten, They wou'd <HI>die,</HI> in spite of Protection. So I commit them to the World, unsustain'd by <HI>Dedica∣tion.—</HI>No Patron's Authority can protect a <HI>bad</HI> Work.—And a <HI>good</HI> one can want no Protection.</P>
<P>I am afraid, we need look no farther, than the <HI>Dedications</HI> of our Poetick Writings, for the Source of that <HI>Neglect,</HI> which the <HI>Art, Itself,</HI> complains of.—While Poetry preserv'd its Honesty, it was con∣sider'd with Distinction; But, when it degenerated into a Traffick, between <HI>Praise</HI> and <HI>Reward,</HI> it be∣came despis'd, like the Gold of <HI>Utopia,</HI> not by Igno∣rance of its Value, but through scorn of the Use, It was put to.</P>
<P>Before I speak of the following Tragedy, I am oblig'd to take Notice of another, the first Dramatic Sally of my Youth: And which, I shou'd be asham'd to confess, I had the Folly to begin and finish in a Week, but that I have Occasion, from that Con∣fession, to hope Pardon of its Faults; and admire the <HI>English Good-nature,</HI> which receiv'd it, with un∣deserv'd Indulgence.—It was written on the same Subject with <HI>This,</HI> (upon Mr. <HI>Booth's</HI> recom∣mending it to my Choice.) It was, also, acted at the same Theatre; and is, still, a Living Evidence, against me, under the Name of <HI>Elfrid;</HI> or, the <HI>Fair Inconstant.</HI></P>
<P>As I knew nothing of the Rules of Writing, the Play was, consequently, an unprun'd Wilderness of Fancy, with here and there, a Flower, among the Leaves; but without any Fruit, of Judgment.—I know not how it came to pass, that <HI>Athelwold,</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
even in That Piece, deserv'd some little Pity: But, I am afraid, I was too Dull a Painter, to hit a Like∣ness for the Ladies.<HI>—Elfrid</HI> suffer'd more, by <HI>my</HI> ill Conduct, than Her own; and was a lighter <HI>Inconstant,</HI> than the Histories of those Times have shown her: And, as for <HI>Edgar,</HI> The Monarch came out of <HI>my</HI> Hands, as one of his Successors, out of the Arch-Duke of <HI>Austria</HI>'s; stript of Every Thing that became his Condition, and only a King in his <HI>Title.</HI></P>
<P>I therefore consider'd myself as not deserving Par∣don, from the Publick, till I had purchas'd it, with something, <HI>Better,</HI> on the same Subject.—This was the Original of <HI>Athelwold.</HI></P>
<P>The New Play has neither Thought, Design, nor Expression, in the least, resembling the Old one; And my only Reason, for troubling the Reader with this little Story, is, because, shou'd there be any Thing in the second Attempt, greatly Preferable to the First, it will be a <HI>Proof,</HI> that Fancy (for, to say <HI>Genius,</HI> wou'd be making bold, with what is none of my own,) wants the Aid of the Judgment; and shou'd have Regard to the <HI>Rules,</HI> of an Art, which, like Religion, had an Orthodox Establishment; but (like that too) has been warp'd, and weaken'd, by mysterious Dullness, and the dry Pride of Commen∣tators.</P>
<P>I am unable to execute any Thing in Poetry, if I have <HI>wasted</HI> the Care, I bestow'd on this Tragedy:—Nor can I have so unjust an Opinion of the Pub∣lick Taste, (tho I think Nobody will celebrate it, for Poetry,) as not to know, that shou'd there be Merit in <HI>Athelwold,</HI> there are Spirits, in the Nation, who have Influence, and Generosity, to awaken others, into their Sentiments.—I say this, for the sake of the <HI>Stage;</HI> for, as to myself, the Distinction of Deserving to be <HI>Read,</HI> is all the Advantage I pro∣pose from my Writings.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. WILKS.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>OUR Author's Wishes, partial to the Stage,</L>
<L><HI>Not</HI> for himself, your Favour wou'd engage:</L>
<L>Not his own Cause, but ours, he wou'd defend,</L>
<L>Nor fears an Enemy,—nor tasks a Friend:</L>
<L>But, frankly, bids me <HI>own,</HI> that from <HI>his</HI> Plays,</L>
<L>He <HI>means</HI> no Profit, and <HI>deserves</HI> no Praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, has he <HI>one</HI> fond Passion to impart;</L>
<L>One favourite Weakness, that has warm'd his Heart!</L>
<L><HI>Constant,</HI> he doats on a declining Fair;</L>
<L>Yet, recommends his Mistress to <HI>your</HI> Care;</L>
<L>Tho' past her <HI>Bloom,</HI> still <HI>tempting</HI> she appears,</L>
<L>A <HI>mid-ag'd</HI> Matron,—of three thousand Years!</L>
<L>Slight not <HI>Dame Tragedy,—</HI>nor fancy, Sirs,</L>
<L>That <HI>Pain,</HI> and Spleen, and Age, alone, are hers:</L>
<L><HI>Old,</HI> as you think her, still, she <HI>moves,</HI> and <HI>warms,</HI></L>
<L>Smiles thro' the Soul, and swells the Heart with Charms.</L>
<L>But the vain <HI>Prude,</HI> too coy, to yield, at Pleasure,</L>
<L>Vows, she'll be <HI>wedded,—</HI>or withhold her Treasure.</L>
<L>Take her, to <HI>Wife;—</HI>the Match cou'd ne'er be wrong,</L>
<L>But, for one Quality—she'll <HI>live</HI> too long.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cou'd ye, for once, forgive the <HI>serious</HI> Strain,</L>
<L>And bear a useful Truth, undress'd, and plain?—</L>
<L>Fain wou'd the Muse remind you, that the <HI>Stage</HI></L>
<L>Receiv'd most Honour, from the <HI>wisest Age.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Athens</HI> shone brightest, when the crowded <HI>Scene</HI></L>
<L>Fir'd her bold Sons,—to <HI>dare,—</HI>to <HI>act,—</HI>to <HI>mean!</HI></L>
<L>Greatly, to <HI>copy</HI> the departed <HI>Great,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>be</HI> the Chiefs, they learnt to <HI>emulate.</HI></L>
<L><PB REF="6"/>
Warm'd, by this Heat, which to their <HI>Plays</HI> they ow'd,</L>
<L>The guided Passions of a <HI>People glow'd:</HI></L>
<L>High beat their cherish'd Hearts, in Glory's Cause;</L>
<L>Firm stood their Freedom, and long liv'd their Laws:</L>
<L><HI>Charm'd</HI> into Virtue, and by <HI>Pleasure</HI> taught,</L>
<L>The raptur'd Youth, the meant Impression caught,</L>
<L>Grew up to Greatness, Liberty, and Arts,</L>
<L>And snatch'd the <HI>Heroe</HI>'s, from the <HI>Player</HI>'s Parts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! cou'd we live, to hail the future Day,</L>
<L>When sparkling Folly shall give <HI>Genius</HI> way;</L>
<L>When <HI>low, light, Scenes</HI> shall tempt the Eye, in vain;</L>
<L>And <HI>Passion</HI>'s Power impress the Heart, again;</L>
<L>Then shall the Muses, like their Monarch, smile,</L>
<L>And <HI>all</HI> Heaven's Blessings crown his happy Isle!</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. BOOTH.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>THIS whining Tragedy has made me hoarse,</L>
<L>Yet, as an Epilogue's a Thing of course,</L>
<L>I can't help telling ye, before we part,</L>
<L>I'm glad my Husband's dead, with all my Heart:</L>
<L>That's one Confession,—and one more shall be,</L>
<L>I wish the Author were as dead as he:</L>
<L>His <HI>murdering</HI> Muse, in downright Love of teizing,</L>
<L>Kills <HI>one,</HI> for <HI>being pleas'd,</HI> and one, for <HI>pleasing:</HI></L>
<L>Stabs <HI>Ethy—</HI>'cause <HI>her</HI> Love was an untrue one,</L>
<L>Drowns <HI>my</HI> good Man, because he lik'd a new one:</L>
<L><HI>Lud! Lud!—</HI>what Work 'twou'd make among the <HI>Fair;</HI></L>
<L>Shou'd every <HI>Belle</HI> be <HI>drown'd,</HI> that loves a <HI>Pair:</HI></L>
<L>And, as for <HI>Beaux,—</HI>who make no Bones of erring,</L>
<L><HI>They'd</HI> fill the Seas, all round, like Shoals of Herring!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A fine Example, truly! don't it <HI>move</HI> ye?</L>
<L>Were it well follow'd—how 'twou'd soon <HI>improve</HI> ye!</L>
<L>Send ye, in Pairs, to Heav'n, where good Folks Trust is,</L>
<L>Martyrs, Lord help ye! of <HI>Poetic Justice!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I, for my Part, had a <HI>sweet</HI> Race to run,</L>
<L>I,<HI>—not</HI> to be a Queen;—must be a<HI>—Nun!</HI></L>
<L>No, Ladies, have a care os that:—The Poet</L>
<L>Belies the Story,—and, thank Heaven! I know it:—</L>
<L><HI>Elfrid</HI> was <HI>wiser,</HI> and the King was <HI>kinder;</HI></L>
<L>Even, in the Convent, <HI>he</HI> knew how to find her:</L>
<L>He, pious Prince! lov'd Penitence so well,</L>
<L>That, oft, he trac'd it to the loneliest Cell;</L>
<L><HI>Confess'd</HI> the Saints <HI>Himself—</HI>bless'd Occupation!</L>
<L>Freely bestow'd his <HI>Princely</HI> Consolation;</L>
<L>And <HI>eas'd</HI> the <HI>Father Girards</HI> of the Nation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="8"/>
<L>Nay, tis no laughing Matter—I am <HI>serious,</HI></L>
<L>I meant no Mischief, I:—no Hint mysterious!</L>
<L>Ask <HI>Hollinshead;—</HI>He'll tell ye, if tis new t'ye,</L>
<L>That <HI>Edgar</HI> was a Lyon—at <HI>Church Duty.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>One</HI> of His Virtues needs must Envy raise,</L>
<L>He was the veriest <HI>Patriot,</HI> of His Days!</L>
<L>He, not to <HI>Maids,</HI> alone, thought Pity due,</L>
<L>His will, <HI>unwearied,</HI> work'd for <HI>Husbands,</HI> too.</L>
<L>Dependent Princes sent their Wives, by th' Dozen,</L>
<L>To <HI>tax</HI> This Bounty of their Royal Cozen!</L>
<L>And Eight <HI>dubb'd</HI> Monarchs, of his own Creation,</L>
<L><HI>Row'd</HI> him, in grateful Triumph, round the Nation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This being so—what does our Author Merit,</L>
<L>Who wrongs a Prince—of such a <HI>Publick Spirit!</HI></L>
<L>Hang him, dull Poet!—I'll say nothing for him,</L>
<L>In good King <HI>Edgar's</HI> Quarrel, I abhor him:—</L>
<L>Take him among ye,—and, if e're you'd mend him,</L>
<L>To some <HI>kind Jesuit,</HI> for new Notions, send him.</L>

<L>Why shunn'd you <HI>Edgar?</HI> You had struck no Shoal,</L>

<L>Had we, amid the shouting Swarms, approach'd</L>

<L><HI>Edgar</HI> is young,</L>

<L>True, I lov'd her,</L>
<L>But lov'd her with <HI>Desire:</HI> while, in <HI>Her</HI> Breast,</L>
<L>Love, which, at first, was gen'rous Gratitude,</L>
<L>Drew all its Warmth from Pity.—Never, never,</L>
<L>Shall I forget, how blissfully I won her!</L>
<L>'Twas the dear Night, before this fatal Journey;</L>
<L>I found her, <HI>Edwyn,</HI> sunk on her Couch, alone,</L>
<L>Weeping, with am'rous Grief, for coming Absence:</L>
<L>Loose and enchanting-negligent her Dress;</L>
<L>Faint was her Air; and a kind nameless Languor</L>
<L>Sigh'd, in short Heavings, from her soften'd Heart;</L>
<L>And every Breath was Tenderness and Love!</L>
<L>There, while transported, on my trembling Knee,</L>
<L>Bending, I gaz'd, and hung devoutly o'er her,</L>
<L>Raptur'd, and charm'd, I plung'd amidst Attraction;</L>
<L>Sigh'd on her Eyes; breath'd o'er her panting Bosom,</L>
<L>And snatch'd her Soul, unguarded:—Millions of Vows,</L>
<L>Fierce, burning, Vows! of Everlasting Love,</L>
<L>Transport, and Marriage, and Eternal Truth,</L>
<L>Thaw'd her reluctant Vertue to Belief:</L>
<L>Then—in the soft Desire's new Warmth, I press'd her,</L>
<L>Till, in the beating Tumult of her Heart,</L>
<L>She gave—she knew not what—nor meant Com∣pliance!</L>
<L>Fortune renounce me, <HI>Edwyn,</HI> but my Reason</L>
<L>Prefers her, even to <HI>Elfrid:—</HI>My Passion did not.</L>
<L>The Love she felt for me, I feel for <HI>Elfrid;</HI></L>

<L>My Spirit,</L>

<L>Burns up the Road it runs thro'; yet I feel Warmth,</L>

<L>There may be ways, and we may find 'em, Prince,</L>
<L>To reach this proud Presumer.</L>

<L>I must not aid thee:</L>
<L>He was my Friend; and then, my Life was his,</L>
<L>By Tie of Duty.—He was, since, my Enemy;</L>
<L>And then, again, 'twas his, by Claim of Conquest.</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="38"/>
I've lost Revenge, to Honour.—I have no Right</L>
<L>To lift my Arm against him: For, from a Hand</L>
<L>Oblig'd as mine has been, Justice itself</L>
<L>Would redden into Murder.—But, were I <HI>Oswald,</HI></L>
<L>Wrong'd, as thou art, and free to weigh those Wrongs,</L>
<L>Without this Counterpoise of Obligation,</L>
<L>I would hunt <HI>Athelwold</HI> to the World's Verge;</L>
<L>Nay, would leap after him, and snatch at Vengeance,</L>
<L>Through the unfathom'd Depth of dark Eternity.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oswald.</SPEAKER>
<L>I too, perhaps,</L>
<L>Who have as light a Spring as you, Prince <HI>Leolyn,</HI></L>
<L>Might try that dreadful Leap, could I be sure</L>
<L>That it was bounded, <HI>but</HI> by Depth and Darkness:</L>
<L>But, shou'd there lie some Realm of Light beyond,</L>
<L>I should look foolishly, when I fell through,</L>
<L>To find my State grown worse than 'twas before,</L>
<L>And no Road back again.—Methinks, 'tis strange,</L>
<L>That you, hot Fighters, Friends of bare-fac'd Anger,</L>
<L>Have never learnt our safer courtly Art</L>
<L>Of Vengeance without Danger!—You injure me,</L>
<L>And I assault you openly:—Man against Man</L>
<L>Gives Chance an equal Cast: 'Tis you or me:</L>
<L>Suppose, as first you wrong'd, you, now, shou'd kill me?</L>
<L>Where's Vengeance then?—What Equity is here!</L>
<L>No;—let me pay th' Affront, with a first Blow,</L>
<L>Whereby I hazard nothing: That sets us equal;</L>
<L>And, if I not strike home, he's, then, at liberty</L>
<L>To stand on even Terms, and try, once more.</L>

<L>Alas! I fear, for ever.—Look on me, <HI>Athelwold!</HI></L>
<L>Raise your fal'n Eyes:—They once cou'd gaze, delighted,</L>
<L>And hung their Beams on mine, as both were form'd,</L>

<L>To fix an unmov'd, stedfast, Look upon me;</L>
<L>Hold them, thus earnest, nor decline their Lids,</L>

<L>What have I done, that could deserve, from <HI>Athelwold,</HI></L>

<L>The Virtue that inspires this gen'rous Shame,</L>

<L>The Heart of <HI>Elfrid,</HI> when thou art no more,</L>
<L>May teach her to forget thee.—I, or Thou,</L>
<L>Must fall.—It was the King's Intent to pardon</L>
<L>The Subject's Treason. The <HI>King</HI> does forgive thee;</L>
<L>But the <HI>Friend</HI> cannot pardon.—Let us, then,</L>
<L>On equal Terms, dispute our doubtful Claim,</L>
<L>To Death and Quiet, or to Life and <HI>Elfrid.</HI></L>
<L>Here I renounce Distinction, give Allegiance</L>

<L>That cold Prerogative of a King's Safety;</L>
<L>To teach thee, that I need no borrow'd Pow'r:</L>

<L>O gen'rous <HI>Edgar!</HI> my Imperial Master,</L>
<L>Whose Spirit reigns, distinguish'd among Souls,</L>
<L>As among Kings, thy Person; think me not,</L>
<L>How plung'd soever in the Guilt of Falshood,</L>
<L>So lost to Sense of the unmeasur'd Distance,</L>
<L>Between my Prince and me, to dare defend</L>
<L>One aching Atom of this hated Breast,</L>
<L>Against a Wound he wishes me.—No; take <STAGE>[Lays his Sword at the King's Feet.</STAGE></L>
<L>My Sword.—It has been drawn, with some Success,</L>
<L>In your lov'd Cause; direct it to the Heart</L>
<L>Of this new Traitor. At your sacred Feet,</L>
<L>The tainted Blood will flow, with willing Waste,</L>
<L>And wash away the Mem'ry of his Crime,</L>
<L>Who lives too long, when he not lives for you.</L>

<SPEAKER>Edgar.</SPEAKER>
<L>Rise, and provoke me, if thou would'st be kind,</L>
<L>By some wish'd Mark of Arrogance.—Presume,</L>
<L>Talk insolently of thy Worth; defy me;</L>
<L>Smile at my Sword's rais'd Point; threaten,—accuse,—</L>
<L>Deny,—Calumniate.—Any Thing, but this!</L>
<L>Spare this soft Sorrow, hide this sweet Humility,</L>
<L>And I shall keep my Purpose.—O <HI>Athelwold!</HI></L>
<L>Why hast thou pain'd my Soul, with this sharp Con∣flict?</L>
<L>Why hast thou wrong'd me, into Will to hurt thee? <STAGE>[Throws down his Sword.</STAGE></L>

<SPEAKER>Athelwold.</SPEAKER>
<L>How ill shou'd I deserve your unwish'd Mercy,</L>

<L>Than was the Guilt I fall for!—From my Birth,</L>
<L>With fix'd, unalterable, deadly Hate,</L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="74"/>
I punish'd faithless Rebels. Trust me, now,</L>
<L>Against myself. My Sovereign shall not need</L>
<L>Revenge his Wrongs, on <HI>Athelwold.—</HI>One Pray'r</L>
<L>Has Boldness, yet, to urge your royal Ear;</L>
<L>Then, I have done with Wishes, and the World.—</L>
<L>Prince <HI>Leolyn,</HI> whom I have made unhappy,</L>
<L>Now suffers, for my Guilt. So greatly wrong'd,</L>
<L>I shall not rest, in Death, till your try'd Goodness</L>
<L>Permits his Freedom, and bestows on Him</L>
<L>My forfeit Honours, and the Lands I leave.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edgar.</SPEAKER>
<L>I charge thee, as thy Heart wou'd wish my Pardon,</L>
<L>Attempt not on thy Life. Wait, and expect</L>
<L>Thy Doom, from the slow Workings of my Soul,</L>
<L>That labours to resolve, but knows not how;</L>
<L>For <HI>Leolyn,</HI> thy gen'rous Wish has mov'd me.</L>

<L>How shall I move, in this dark Maze of Passion!</L>
<L>'Tis true, my Favourite has betray'd me, basely;</L>
<L>But he was first, himself, betray'd by Love;</L>
<L>That Tyrant of the Heart, more King than I,</L>
<L>Ranks Monarchs with his Slaves.—Let me weigh</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Athelwold</SPEAKER>
<L>By my own Wishes, and, then, punish <HI>him,</HI></L>
<L>When I can see, unmov'd, those Eyes which charm'd him.</L>
<L>How shall I act? at once, to shield my Fame,</L>
<L>And satisfy my Love.—Cou'd Reason's Force</L>
<L>Tear the unlicens'd Image from my Heart,</L>
<L>Or, patient, leave to Time, th'unhasten'd Means,</L>
<L>To bless my fierce Desires; Who knows what Chance,</L>
<L>Or Death, or Thought, or Woman's changeful Will,</L>
<L>Or my own conquer'd Wishes, may produce.</L>
<L>—Kings should, however injur'd, do no Wrong:</L>
<L><PB N="67" REF="75"/>
They cannot err <HI>alone,</HI> since what They act,</L>
<L>They authorize in others.—Let me, then,</L>
<L>Extinguish low Desires, lest, at <HI>my</HI> Flame,</L>
<L>I light a Nation's Wishes.—I will strive</L>
<L>To check this rising Passion; and forget</L>
<L>That she who charms me thus is in my Power,</L>
<L>Till I can bend that Pow'r, to Reason's Rule.</L>

<L>Stay—for we find,</L>

<L>If it must be,</L>

<L>To tell him what, at my Request, the King</L>
<L>Was won to grant him, were to seem afraid,</L>

<L>Paus'd, for an Answer:—'Till, at last, more shrill,</L>
<L>She scream'd Resentment, to the distant Deep.</L>
<L>—Thou art, she cry'd, as cold, and deaf, as <HI>Athelwold.</HI></L>

<L>This had been Daggers to my guilty Soul,</L>

<L>He met my Rage, with a serene Contempt,</L>
<L>Master'd, a second time, my failing Sword,</L>
<L>And gave me Life, in Punishment.—Live, <HI>Leolyn!</HI></L>
<L>He cry'd, and spoke it with an Air unmov'd,</L>
<L>Superior, <HI>not</HI> insulting.—Live—and know,</L>

<L>And, on his Cheek, support her bending Head;</L>
<L>But her weak Joints soft sinking from their Trust,</L>
<L>She hung sustain'd, and bled upon his Bosom.</L>
<L>He groan'd,—look'd wild,—call'd loud upon her Name,</L>
<L>And, for a Moment, stopt her flying Soul.</L>
<L>Twice, at his Voice, she stretch'd her dying Eyes,</L>
<L>And gasp'd,—and struggl'd,—and wou'd fain have spoke;</L>
<L>But, failing—in a short, convulsive, Sigh,</L>
<L>Breath'd out her Soul,—and sunk upon his Bosom.</L>
<L>He!—standing near the downfal of the Cliff,</L>
<L>Strain'd her, with Rapture, in his circling Arms,</L>
<L>O <HI>Leolyn!</HI> he cry'd, forgive me, <HI>now:</HI></L>
<L>Tell the wrong'd King, I leave his <HI>Elfrid,</HI> free,</L>
<L>And, thus, too late, do Right to <HI>Ethelinda.—</HI></L>

<L>Leap'd, with the Dead, to Death!—Together, both</L>
