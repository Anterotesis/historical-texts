THE LIVES OF THE POETS.</HEAD>
<DIV1 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Sir JOHN DENHAM.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>N eminent poet of the 17th century, was the only son of Sir John Den∣ham, knight, of Little Horsley in Essex, and some time baron of the Exchequer in Ireland, and one of the lords justices of that kingdom. He was born in Dublin, in the year 1615<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ath. Oxon. vol. ii.</NOTE>; but was brought over from thence very young, on his father's being made one of the barons of the Exchequer in England 1617.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5"/>
He received his education, in grammar learning, in London; and in Michaelmas term 1631 he was entered a gentleman commoner in Trinity College, Oxford, being then 16 years of age; where, as Wood expresses it, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'being looked upon as a slow dreaming young man, and more addicted to ga∣ming than study, they could never imagine he could ever enrich the world with the issue of his brain, as he afterwards did.'</Q></P>
<P>He remained three years at the university, and having been examined at the public schools, for the degree of bachelor of arts, he entered him∣self in Lincoln's-Inn, where he was generally thought to apply himself pretty closely to the study of the common law. But notwithstanding his application to study, and all the efforts he was capable of making, such was his propensity to gaming, that he was often stript of all his money; and his father severely chiding him, and threatning to abandon him if he did not reform, he wrote a little essay against that vice, and pre∣sented it to his father, to convince him of his resolution against it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wood.</NOTE>. But no sooner did his fa∣ther die, than being unrestrained by paternal autho∣rity, he reassumed the practice, and soon squan∣dered away several thousand pounds.</P>
<P>In the latter end of the year 1641 he published a tragedy called the Sophy, which was greatly ad∣mired, and gave Mr. Waller occasion to say of our author, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That he broke out like the Irish rebellion, threescore thousand strong, when no body was aware, nor in the least expected it.'</Q> Soon after this he was pricked for high sheriff for the county of Surry, and made governor of Farnham-Castle for the King; but not being well skilled in military affairs, he soon quitted that post and retired to his Majesty at Oxford,
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
where he published an excellent poem called Coo∣per's-hill, often reprinted before and since the re∣storation, with considerable alterations: it has been universally admired by all good judges, and was translated into Latin verse, by Mr. Moses Pengry of Oxford.</P>
<P>Mr. Dryden speaking of this piece, in his de∣dication of his Rival Ladies, says, that it is a poem, which, for the Majesty of the stile, will ever be the exact standard of good writing, and the noble author of an essay on human life, bestows upon it the most lavish encomium<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the preface to 2d edition, 1736, 4to.</NOTE>. But of all the evidences in its favour, none is of greater authority, or more beautiful, than the following of Mr. Pope, in his Windsor Forest.<Q><L>Ye sacred nine, that all my soul possess,</L>
<L>Whose raptures fire me, and whose visions bless;</L>
<L>Bear me, O bear me, to sequester'd scenes,</L>
<L>The bow'ry mazes, and surrounding greens;</L>
<L>To Thames's bank which fragrant breezes fill,</L>
<L>Or where the muses sport on Cooper's-hill.</L>
<L>(On Cooper's hill eternal wreaths shall grow,</L>
<L>While lasts the mountain, or while Thames shall flow.)</L>
<L>I seem thro' consecrated walks to rove,</L>
<L>I hear soft music die along the grove,</L>
<L>Led by the sound, I roam from shade to shade,</L>
<L>By god-like poets venerable made:</L>
<L>Here his last lays majestic Denham sung,</L>
<L>There the last numbers flow'd from Cowley's tongue.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the year 1647 he was entrusted by the Queen with a message to the King, then in the hands of
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
the army, and employed in other affairs relating to his Majesty. In his dedication of his poems to Charles II. he observes, that after the delivery of the person of his royal father into the hands of the army, he undertook for the Queen-mother, to get access to his Majesty, which he did by means of Hugh Peters; and upon this occasion, the King discoursed with him without reserve up∣on the state of his affairs. At his departure from Hampton-court, says he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The King commanded me to stay privately in London, to send to him and receive from him all his letters, from and to all his correspondents, at home and abroad, and I was furnished with nine several cyphers in order to it. Which I trust I performed with great safety to the persons with whom we corres∣ponded; but about nine months after being dis∣covered by their knowledge of Mr. Cowley's hand, I happily escaped both for myself and those who held correspondence with me.'</Q></P>
<P>In April 1648 he conveyed away James duke of York, then under the tuition of Algernon earl of Northumberland, from St. James's, and carried him into France, to the prince of Wales and Queen∣mother. This circumstance is related by Wood, but Clarendon, who is a higher authority, says, that the duke went off with colonel Bamfield only, who contrived the means of his escape. Not long af∣ter, he was sent embassador to the King of Poland, in conjunction with lord Crofts, to whom he ad∣dresses a poem written on their journey; from whence he brought ten thousand pounds for his Majesty, by the decimation of his Scottish sub∣jects there.</P>
<P>About the year 1652, he returned into England, and was well received by the earl of Pembroke at Wilton, and continued with that nobleman a∣bout a year; for his own fortune by the expence he was at during the civil war, and his uncon∣querable
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
itch of gaming was quite exhausted. From that year to the restoration, there are no accounts of our author; but as soon as his Ma∣jesty returned, he entered upon the office of sur∣veyor of his Majesty's buildings, in the room of Inigo Jones, deceased; and at the coronation of King Charles II. was created a knight of the Bath. Upon some discontent arising from his se∣cond marriage he lost his senses, but soon reco∣vering from that disorder, he continued in great esteem at court for his poetical writings. In the dedication of his poems to King Charles II. he tells us that he had been discouraged by King Charles I. from writing verses.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'One morning (says he) when I was waiting up∣on the King at Causham, smiling upon me, he said he could tell me some news of myself, which was that he had seen some verses of mine the evening before (being those to Sir Robert Fan∣shaw) and asking me when I made them, I told him two or three years since; he was pleased to say, that having never seen them before, he was afraid I had written them since my return into Eng∣land; and though he liked them well he would advise me to write no more: alledging, that when men are young, and having little else to do, they might vent the over-flowings of their fancy that way, but when they were thought fit for more serious employments, if they still persisted in that course, it would look as if they minded not the way to any better; whereupon I stood corrected as long as I had the honour to wait upon him.'</Q> This is a strong instance of his duty to the King; but no great compliment to his Ma∣jesty's taste: nor was the public much obliged to the Monarch for this admonition to our author.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9"/>
But King Charles II. being of an humour more sprightly than his father, was a professed encou∣rager of poetry, and in his time a race of wits sprung up, unequalled by those of any other reign.</P>
<P>This monarch was particularly delighted with the poetry of our author, especially when he had the happiness to wait upon him, in Holland and Flanders; and he was pleased sometimes to give him arguments to write upon, and divert the evil hours of their banishment, which now and then, Sir John tells us, he acquitted himself not much short of his Majesty's expectation.</P>
<P>In the year 1688 Sir John Denham died, at his office in Whitehall, and was interred in West∣minster-Abbey, near the tombs of Chaucer, Spen∣ser, and Cowley.</P>
<P>Our author's works are,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Cooper's-hill, of which we have already ta∣ken some notice.</ITEM>

Our author tells us, that intending to translate this piece into prose (where translation ought to be strict) sinding the mat∣ter very proper for verse, he took the liberty to leave out what was only necessary, to that age and place, and to take or add what was proper to this present age and occasion, by laying the scene clearer and in fewer words, according to the stile and car of the times.</ITEM>

<P><PB N="8" REF="11"/>
Besides these, Wood mentions a Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egyric on his excellency general Monk 1659, in one sheet quarto. Though Denham's name is not to it, it is generally ascribed to him. A Prologue to his majesty, at the first play represented at the Cock-pit in White-hall, being part of that noble entertainment, which their majesties received, November 19, 1660, from his grace the duke of Albemarle. A new Version of the Psalms of David. The True Presbyterian, without Disguise; or, a Character of a Presbyterian's Ways and Actions, London 1680, in half a sheet in folio. In the year 1666 there were printed by stealth, in octavo, certain Poems, intitled Directions to a Painter, in four copies or parts, each dedicated to king Charles the IId. They were very satyrically written against several persons engaged in the Dutch war, in 1661. At the end of them was a piece enti∣tled Clarendon's Housewarming; and after that his Epitaph, both containing bitter reflexions against that earl. Sir John Denham's name is to these pieces, but they were generally thought to be written by Andrew Marvel, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a Merry Droll in Charles the IId's Parliaments, but so very honest, that when a minister once called at his lodgings, to tamper with him about his vote, he found him in mean apartments up two pair of stairs, and though he was obliged to send out that very morning to bor∣row a guinea, yet he was not to be corrupted by the minister, but denied him his vote. The printer of these poems being discovered, he was sentenced to stand in the pillory for the same.</P>
<P>We have met with no authors who have given any account of the moral character of Sir John Denham, and as none have mentioned his virtues, so we find no vice imputed to him but that of gaming; to which it appears he was immoderately addicted. If we may judge from his works, he was a good natur'd man, an easy companion, and in the day of danger and tumult, of unshaken loyalty to the suffering in∣terest
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
of his sovereign. His character as a poet is well known, he has the fairest testimonies in his favour, the voice of the world, and the sanction of the cri∣tics; Dryden and Pope praise him, and when these are mentioned, other authorities are superfluous.</P>
<P>We shall select as a specimen of Sir John Denham's Poetry, his Elegy on his much loved and admired friend Mr. Abraham Cowley.<Q><L>Old mother Wit and nature gave</L>
<L>Shakespear, and Fletcher all they have;</L>
<L>In Spencer and in Johnson art,</L>
<L>O slower nature, got the start.</L>
<L>But both in him so equal are,</L>
<L>None knows which bears the happiest share.</L>
<L>To him no author was unknown,</L>
<L>Yet what he wrote was all his own:</L>
<L>He melted not the antient gold,</L>
<L>Nor, with Ben Johnson, did make bold,</L>
<L>To plunder all the Roman stores.</L>
<L>Of poets and of orators.</L>
<L>Horace's wit, and Virgil's state,</L>
<L>He did not steal, but emulate;</L>
<L>And he would like to them appear,</L>
<L>Their garb, but not their cloaths did wear.</L>
<L>He not from Rome alone but Greece,</L>
<L>Like Johnson, brought the golden fleece.</L>
<L>And a stiff gale, (as Flaccus sings)</L>
<L>The Theban swan extends his wings,</L>
<L>When thro' th' aethereal clouds he flies,</L>
<L>To the same pitch our swan doth rise;</L>

<L>When on that gale, his wings are stretch'd.</L></Q></P>

<P>A Gentleman, who was page of honour to king Charles I. and groom of the bed-chamber to king Charles II. with whom he endured twenty∣years exile. During his abode beyond sea, he took a view of France, Italy and Spain, and was ho∣noured by his majesty, with the employment of re∣sident at the state of Venice, whither he was sent in August 1651. During his exile abroad, he applied his leisure hours to the study of poetry, and the com∣position of several plays, of which Sir John Denham in a jocular way takes notice, in his copy of verses on our author's return from his embassy from Venice.<Q><LG N="1">

Killegrew was a man of very great humour, and frequently diverted king Charles II. by his lively spirit of mirth and drollery. He was frequently at court, and had often access to king Charles when ad∣mission was denied to the first peers in the realm. Amongst many other merry stories, the following is related of Killegrew. Charles II. who hated busi∣ness as much as he loved pleasure, would often dis∣appoint the council in vouchsafing his royal presence when they were met, by which their business was necessarily delay'd and many of the council much offended by the disrespect thrown on them: It hap∣pened one day while the council were met, and had sat some time in expectation of his majesty, that the duke of Lauderdale, who was a furious ungovernable man, quitted the room in a passion, and accidentally met with Killegrew, to whom he expressed himself irreverently of the king: Killegrew bid his grace be calm, for he would lay a wager of a hundred pounds, that he would make his majesty come to council in less than half an hour. Lauderdale being a little heated, and under the influence of surprize, took him at his word;—Killegrew went to the king, and without ceremony told him what had happened, and added, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I know that your majesty hates Lauder∣dale, tho' the necessity of your affairs obliges you to behave civilly to him; now if you would get rid of a man you hate, come to the council, for Lauderdale is a man so boundlesly avaritious, that rather than pay the hundred pounds lost in this wager, he will hang himself, and never plague you more."</Q> The king was pleased with the arch∣ness of this observation, and answered, <Q REND="inline">'then Kille∣grew I'll positively go,'</Q> which he did.—It is like∣wise related, that upon the king's suffering his mis∣tresses to gain so great an ascendant over him as to sacrifice for them the interest of the state, and neglect the most important affairs, while, like another Sarda∣napalus, he wasted his hours in the apartments of
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
those enchantresses: Killegrew went one day into his apartment dress'd like a pilgrim, bent upon a long journey. The king being surprized at this ex∣traordinary frolic, asked him the meaning of it, and to what distant country he was going, to which Kil∣legrew bluntly answered, the country I seek, may it please your majesty, is hell; and what to do there? replies the king? to bring up Oliver Cromwel from thence, returned the wag, to take care of the English affairs, for his successor takes none.—We cannot particularly ascertain the truth of these rela∣tions, but we may venture to assert that they are not improbable, when it is considered how much delight∣ed king Charles the IId. was with a joke, however severe, and that there was not at court a more likely p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rson to pass them than Killegrew, who from his long exile with the king, and being about his person, had contracted a kind of familiarity, which the lustre that was thrown round the prince upon his restoration was not sufficient to check.</P>
<P>Tho' Sir John Denham mentions but six, our author wrote nine Plays in his travels, and two at London, amongst which his Don Thomaso, in two parts, and his Parson's Wedding, will always be valued by good judges, and are the best of his performances. The following is a list of his plays.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Bellamira's Dream, or Love of Shadows, a Tragi-Comedy; the first part printed in folio 1663, written in Venice, and dedicated to the lady Mary Villiers, duchess of Richmond and Lennox.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Bellamira's Dream, the second part, written in Venice; printed in folio, London 1663, and dedi∣cated to the lady Anne Villiers, countess of Essex.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Cicilia and Clorinda, or Love in Arms, a Tragi-comedy; the first part printed in folio, Lon∣don 1663, written in Turin.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Cicilia and Clorinda, the second part, written at Florence 1651, and dedicated to the lady Dorothy Sidney, countess of Sunderland.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="13" REF="16"/>
5. Claracilla, a Tragi-comedy, printed in solio, London 1663; written at Rome, and dedicated to his sister in-law lady Shannon; on this play and an∣other of the author's, called the Prisoners, Mr. Cart∣wright has written an ingenious copy of verses.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The Parson's Wedding, a Comedy, printed in folio, London 1663; written at Basil in Switzerland. This play was revived at the old Theatre, at little Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, and acted all by women; a new prologue and epilogue, being spoken by Mrs. Marshal in Man's cloaths, which Mr. Langbain says is printed in the Covent-Garden Drollery. This was a miscellaneous production of those times, which bore some resemblance to our Magazines; but which in all probability is now out of print.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. The Pilgrim, a Tragedy, printed in folio, Lon∣don 1663; written in Paris in the year 1651, and dedicated to the countess of Carnarvon.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. The Princess, or Love at first Sight, a Tragi-Comedy, printed in folio, London 1663; written at Naples, and dedicated to his niece, the lady Anne Wentworth, wife to lord Lovelace.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. The Prisoners, a Tragi-Comedy, printed in folio, London 1663; written at London and dedi∣cated to the lady Crompton.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. Don Thomaso, or the Wanderer, a Comedy in two parts, printed in folio, London 1663; and de∣dicated to the fair and kind friends of prince Pala∣tine Polexander. In the first part of this play, the author has borrowed several ornaments from Flet∣cher's play called the Captain. He has used great freedom with Ben Johnson, for not only the cha∣racters of Lopus, but even the very words are repeat∣ed from Johnson's Fox, where Volpone personates Scoto of Mantua. I don't believe that our author de∣signed to conceal his assistance, since he was so just as to acknowledge a song against jealousy, which he bor∣rowed from Mr. Thomas Carew, cup-bearer to king Charles the Ist, and sung in a masque at Whitehall,
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
anno 1633. This Chorus, says he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I presume to make use of here, because in the first design it was written at my request, upon a dispute held be∣tween Mrs. Cicilia Crofer and myself, when he was present; she being then maid of honour. This I have set down, lest any man should imagine me so foolish, as to steal such a poem, from so famous an author.'</Q> If he was therefore so scrupulous in committing depredations upon Carew, he would be much more of Ben Johnson, whose fame was so su∣perior to Carew's. All these plays were printed to∣gether in one volume in folio, London 1664.</ITEM>

<P>WAS descended from the noble family of the earl of Berkshire, and was more illustrious by his birth than his genius; he addicted himself to the study of dramatic poetry, and produced four plays, but gained no reputation by any of them.<LIST>

This play mis∣carried in the action, as he himself acknowledges in his preface; and the earl of Rochester, with his usual virulence, writ an invective against it; but, Mrs. Behn, Mr. Ravenscroft, and some other poets, taking com∣passion on him, sent the author recommendatory verses, which are printed before that play, and in
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
return he writ a Pindarique to Mrs. Behn, which she printed in a Collection of Poems 1685.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Usurper, a Tragedy, acted at the Theatre-Royal, and printed 1668, in which the character of Damocles, is said to have been drawn for Oliver Cromwel, and that the play is a parallel of those times.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Womens Conquest, a Tragi-Comedy, acted at the Duke's Theatre 1677.</ITEM>

<P>Besides these plays, Mr. Howard has published an Epic Poem in octavo, called the British Princes, which the earl of Rochester likewise handled pretty severely. There is likewise ascribed to him another Book of Poems and Essays, with a Paraphrase on Cicero's Laelius, or Tract of Friendship, printed in 8vo. The Earl of Dorset, who was called by cotemporary writers, the best good man, with the worst natured Muse, has dedicated a few lines to the damnation of this extraordinary epic production of Mr. Howard's.</P>
<P>The Spectator observes, that this epic piece is full of incongruity, or in other words, abounds with nonsense. He quotes the two following lines,<Q><L>A coat of mail Prince Vortiger had on,</L>
<L>Which from a naked pict his grandsire won.</L></Q> Who does not see the absurdity of winning a coat from a naked man?</P>

<HEAD>Mrs. APHRA BEHN,</HEAD>
<P>A Celebrated poetess of the last age, was a gentlewoman by birth, being descended, as her life-writer says, from a good family in the city of Canterbury. She was born in Charles Ist's reign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs prefixed to her Novels, by a lady.</NOTE>, but in what year is not known. Her father's name was Johnson, whose relation to the lord Willoughby engaged him for the advantage∣ous post of lieutenant general. of Surinam, and six and thirty islands, to undertake a voyage, with his whole family, to the West-Indies, at which time our poetess was very young. Mr. Johnson died at sea, in his passage thither; but his family arrived at Surinam, a place so delightfully situated, and abounding with such a vast profusion of beauties, that, according to Mrs. Behn's description, nature seems to have joined with art to render it perfect∣ly elegant: her habitation in that country, called St. John's Hill, she has challenged all the gar∣dens in Italy, nay, all the globe of the world, to shew so delightful a recess. It was there our po∣etess became acquainted with the story and person of the American Prince Oroonoko, whose adven∣tures she has so feelingly and elegantly described in the celebrated Novel of that name, upon which Mr. Southern has built his Tragedy of Oroonoko, part of which is so entertaining and moving, that it is almost too much for nature. Mrs. Behn tells us, that she herself had often seen and conversed with that great man, and been a witness to many of
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
his mighty actions, and that at one time, he, and Imoinda his wife, were scarce an hour in a day from her lodgings; that they eat with her, and that she obliged them in all things she was capa∣ble of, entertaining them with the lives of the Ro∣mans and great men, which charmed him with her company; while she engaged his wife with teaching her all the pretty works she was mistress of, relating stories of Nuns, and endeavouring to bring her to the knowledge of the true God. This intimacy between Oroonoko and Mrs. Behn oc∣casioned some reflexions on her conduct, from which the authoress of her life, already quoted, justified her in the following manner; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Here, says she, I can add nothing to what she has given the world already, but a vindication of her from some unjust aspersions I find are insinu∣ated about this town, in relation to that prince. I knew her intimately well, and I believe she would not have concealed any love affair from me, being one of her own sex, whose friendship and secrecy she had experienced, which makes me as∣sure the world that there was no intr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gue be∣tween that Prince and Astraea. She had a ge∣neral value for his uncommon virtues, and when he related the story of his woes, she might with the Desdemona of Shakespear, cry out, That it was pitiful, wondrous pitiful, which ne∣ver can be construed into an amour; besides, his heart was too violently set on the everlasting charms of his Imoinda, to be shook with those more faint (in his eye) of a white beauty; and Astrea's relations there present kept too watchful an eye over her, to permit the frailty of her youth, if that had been powerful enough.'</Q></P>
<P>After this lady's return to London, she was mar∣ried to Mr. Behn, a Merchant there, but of Dutch extraction. This marriage strengthening her interest, and, perhape, restoring her character, gave her an op∣portunity
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
of appearing with advantage at court. She gave King Charles II. so accurate and agreeable an account of the colony of Surinam, that he con∣ceived a great opinion of her abilities, and thought her a proper person to be entrusted with the management of some important affairs, during the Dutch war; which occasioned her going into Flanders, and residing at Antwerp. Here, by her political intrigues, she discovered the design formed by the Dutch, of sailing up the river Thames, and burning the English ships in their harbours, which she communicated to the court of England; but her intelligence, though well grounded, as appear∣ed by the event, being only laughed at and slight∣ed, she laid aside all other thoughts of state af∣fairs, and amused herself during her stay at Ant∣werp with the gallantries in that city. But as we have mentioned that she discovered the design of the Dutch to burn our ships, it would be injustice to the lady, as well as to the reader, not to give some detail of her manner of doing it. She made this discovery by the intervention of a Dutchman, whom her life-writer calls by the name of Vander Albert. As an ambassador, or negociator of her sex could not take the usual means of intelligence; of mixing with the multitude, and bustling in the cabals of statesmen, she fell upon another way, perhaps more efficacious, of working by her eyes. This Vander Albert had been in love with her before her marriage with Mr. Behn, and no soon∣er heard of her arrival at Antwerp, than he paid her a visit; and after a repetition of his for∣mer vows, and ardent professions for her service, pressed her to receive from him some undeniable proofs of the vehemence and sincerity of his pas∣ssion, for which he would ask no reward, 'till he had by long and faithful services convinced her that he deserved it. This proposal was so suita∣ble to her present aim in the service of her coun∣try,
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
that she accepted it, and employed Albert in such a manner, as made her very serviceable to the King. The latter end of the year 1666, he sent her word, by a special messenger, that he would be with her at a day appoinced, at which time, he revealed to her, that Cornelius de Wit, who, with the rest of that family, had an impla∣cable hatred to the English nation and the house of Orange, had, with de Ruyter, proposed to the States the expedition abovementioned. This pro∣posal, concurring with the advice which the Dutch spies in England had given them, of the total neglect of all naval preparations, was well receiv∣ed, and was resolved to be put in execution, as a thing neither dangerous nor difficult. Albert hav∣ing communicated a secret of this importance, and with such marks of truth, that she had no room to doubt of it: as soon as the interview was at an end, she dispatched an account of what she had discovered, to England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires ubi supra.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But we cannot conclude Mrs. Behn's gallantries at Antwerp, without being a little more particular, as we find her attacked by other lovers, and thought she found means to preserve her innocence, yet the account that she herself gives of her affairs there, is both humorous and entertaining.</P>
<P>In a letter to a friend she proceeds thus, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'My other lover is about twice Albert's age, nay and bulk too, tho' Albert be not the most Barbary shape you have seen, you must know him by the name of Van Bruin, and he was introduced to me by Albert his kinsman, and was obliged by him to furnish me in his absence, with what money and other things I should please to command, or have occasion for. This old fellow had not visited me often, before I began to be sensible of the influence of my eyes upon this old piece of touchwood; but
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
he had not the confidence to tell me he loved me, and modesty you know is no common fault of his countrymen. He often insinuated that he knew a man of wealth an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> substance, though striken in∣deed in years, and on that account not so agreeable as a younger man, was passionately in love with me, and desired to know whether my heart was so far engaged, that his friend should not entertain any hopes. I replied that I was surprized to hear a friend of Albert's making an interest in me for another, and that if love were a passion, I was any way sensible of, it could never be for an old man, and much to that purpose. But all this would not do, in a day or two I received this eloquent epistle from him.'</Q> Here Mrs. Behn inserts a translation of Van Bruin's letter, which was wrote in French; and in a most ridiculous stile, telling her, he had often strove to reveal to her the tempests of his heart, and with his own mouth scale the walls of her affec∣tions; but terrified with the strength of her fortifica∣tions, he concluded to make more regular ap∣proaches, to attack her a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a farther distance, and try first what a bombardment of letters would do; whether these carcasses of love thrown into the scon∣ces of her eyes, would break into the midst of her breast, beat down the out-guard of her aversion, and blow up the magazine of her cruelty, that she might be brought to a capitulation, and yield upon reasonable terms. He then considers her as a goodly ship under sail for the Indies; her hair is the pennants, her fore-head the prow, her eyes the guns, her nose the rudder. He wishes he could once see her keel bove water, and desires to be her pilot, to steer thro' the Cape of Good-Hope, to the Indies of love.</P>
<P>Our ingenious poetess sent him a suitable answer to this truly ridiculous and Dutchman like epistle. She rallies him for setting out in so unprofitable a voyage as love, and humorously reckons up the ex∣pences
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
of the voyage; as ribbons, and hoods for her pennants, diamond rings, lockets, and pearl-neck-laces for her guns of offence and defence, silks, holland, lawn, cambric, &amp;c. for her rigging.</P>
<P>Mrs. Behn tells us she diverted herself with Van Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in in Albert's absence, till he began to assume and grow troublesome to her by his addresses, so that to rid himself of him, she was forced to disclose the whole affair to Albert, who was so enraged that he threatened the death of his rival, but he was pacified by his mistress, and content to upbraid the other for his treachery, and forbid him the house, but this says Mrs. Behn, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'produced a very ridiculous scene, for my Nestorian lover would not give ground to Albert, but was as high as he, challenged him to sniker snee for me, and a thousand things as co∣mical; in short nothing but my positive command could satisfy him, and on that he promised no more to trouble me. Sure as he thought himself of me, he was thunder-struck, when he heard me not only forbid him the house, but ridicule all his addresses to his rival Albert; with a countenance full of despair, he went away not only from my lodgings, but the next day from Antwerp, unable to stay in a place where he had met so dreadful a defeat.'</Q></P>
<P>The authoress of her life has given us a farther account of her affairs with Vander Albert, in which she contrived to preserve her honour, without injuring her gratitude. There was a woman at Antwerp, who had often given Astraea warning of Albert's fickle∣ness and inconstancy, assuring her he never loved after enjoyment, and sometimes changed even before he had that pretence; of which she herself was an instance; Albert having married her, and deserted her on the wedding-night. Our poetess took the op∣portunity of her acquaintance with this lady to put an honest trick upon her lover, and at the same time do justice to an injured woman. Accordingly she
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
made an appointment with Albert, and contrived that the lady whose name was Catalina, should meet him in her stead. The plot succeeded and Catalina infinitely pleased with the advanture, appointed the next night, and the following, till at last he dis∣covered the cheat, and resolved to gratify both his love and resentment, by enjoying Astraea even against her will. To this purpose he bribed an elderly gentlewoman, whom Mrs. Behn kept out of charity, to put him to bed drest in her night-cloaths in her place, when Astraea was passing the evening in a merchant's house in the town. The merchant▪s son and his two daughters waited on Astraea home; and to conclude the evening's mirth with a frolick, the young gentle∣man proposed going to bed to the old woman, and that they should all come in with candles and surprize them together. As it was agreed so they did, but no sooner was the young spark put to bed, but he found himself accosted with ardour, and a man's voice, saying, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'have I now caught thee, thou malicious charmer! now I'll not let thee go till thou hast done me justice for all the wrongs thou hast offered my doating love.'</Q> The rest of the company were extremely surprized to find Albert in Astraea's bed instead of the old woman, and Albert no less surprized to find the young spark instead of Astraea. In the conclusion, the old woman was dis∣carded, and Albert's fury at his disappointment ap∣peased by a promise from Mrs. Bhen, of marrying him at his arrival in England; but Albert returning to Holland to make preparations for his voyage to England, died of a Fever at Amsterdam<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs ubi supra.</NOTE>. From this adventure it plainly appears, that the observa∣tion of a Dutchman's not being capable to love is false; for both Albert, and the Nestorian wooer, seem to have been warm enough in their addresses.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="27"/>
After passing some time in this manner at Antwerp, she embarked at Dunkirk for England; and in her passage, was near being lost, for the ship being driven on the coast, foundered within sight of land, but by the assistance of boats from the shore, they were all saved; and Mrs. Behn arriving in London, dedicated the rest of her life to pleasure and poetry. Besides publishing three volumes of miscel∣lany poems, she wrote seventeen plays, and some histories and novels. She translated Fontenelle's History of Oracles, and plurality of worlds, to which last she annexed an Essay on Translation, and trans∣lated Prose. The Paraphrase of Oenone's, Epistle to Paris, in the English Translation of Ovid's Epistles is Mrs. Behn's; as are the celebrated Love Letters between a Nobleman and his Sister. Her wit gained her the esteem of Mr. Dryden, Mr. South∣ern, &amp;c. and at the same time the love and addresses of several gentlemen, in particular one, with whom she corresponded under the name of Lycida, who it seems did not return her passion with equal warmth, and with the earnestness and rapture, she imagined her beauty had a right to command.</P>
<P>Mrs. Behn died after a long indisposition, April 16, 1689, and was buried in the cloister of Westminster-Abbey. We shall beg leave to exhibit her character, as we find it drawn by some of her cotemporaries, and add a remark of our own. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Mr. Langbain thinks her Memory will be long fresh among all lovers of dramatic poetry, as having been suffici∣ciently eminent, not only for her theatrical per∣formances; but several other pieces both in prose and verse, which gained her an esteem among the wits almost equal to that of the incomparable Orinda, Mrs. Katherine Phillips.'</Q></P>
<P>There are several encomiums on Mrs. Behn pre∣fixed to her lover's watch; among the rest, Mr.

Charles Cotton, author of Virgil Travesty, throws in his mite in her praise; though the lines are but poorly writ. But of all her admirers, Mr. Charles Gildon, who was intimately acquainted with our poetess, speaks of her with the highest en∣comiums.</P>
<P>In his epistle dedicatory to her histories and novels, he thus expresses himself. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Poetry, the supreme pleasure of the mind, is begot, and born in plea∣sure, but oppressed and killed with pain. This reflexion ought to raise our admiration of Mrs. Behn, whose genius was of that force, to main∣tain its gaiety in the midst of disappointments, which a woman of her sense and merit ought never to have met with. But she had a great strength of mind, and command of thought, being able to write in the midst of company, and yet have the share of the conversation: which I saw her do in writing Oroonoko, and other parts of her works, in every part of which you'll find an easy stile and a peculiar happiness of thinking. The pas∣sions, that of love especially, she was mistress of, and gave us such nice and tender touches of them, that without her name we might discover the author.'</Q> To this character of Mrs. Behn may be very properly added, that given of her by the authoress of her life and memoirs, in these words. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'She was of a generous humane disposition, some∣thing passionate, very serviceable to her friends in all that was in her power, and could sooner for∣give an injury than do one. She had wit, humour, good-nature and judgment. She was mistress of all the pleasing arts of conversation: She was a woman of sense, and consequently a lover of plea∣sure. For my part I knew her intimately, and never saw ought unbecoming the just modesty of our sex; though more gay and free, than the folly of the precise will allow.'</P></Q> </P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="29"/>
The authors of the Biographia Brittanica say, that her poetry is none of the best; and that her comedies, tho' not without humour, are full of the most indecent scenes and expressions. As to the first, with submission to the authority of these writers, the charge is ill-founded, which will appear from the specimen upon which Dryden him∣self makes her a compliment; as to the latter, I'm afraid it cannot be so well defended; but let those who are ready to blame her, consider, that her's was the sad alternative to write or starve; the taste of the times was corrupt; and it is a true observation, that they who live to please, must please to live.</P>
<P>Mrs. Behn perhaps, as much as any one, condemn∣ed loose scenes, and too warm descriptions; but something must be allowed to human frailty. She herself was of an amorous complexion, she felt the passions intimately which she describes, and this circumstance added to necessity, might be the occasion of her plays being of that cast.</P>

This author cannot be well acquainted with Mrs. Behn's works, who makes a comparison between them and the productions of Durfey. There are marks of a fine understanding in the most unfi∣nished piece of Mrs. Behn, and the very worst of this lady's compositions are preferable to Durfey's best. It is unpleasing to have the merit of any of the Fair Sex lessened. Mrs. Behn suffered e∣nough at the hands of supercilious prudes, who had the barbarity to construe her sprightliness in∣to lewdness; and because she had wit and beau∣ty, she must likewise be charged with prostitution and irreligion.</P>

<HEAD>Sir GEORGE ETHEREGF,</HEAD>
<P>A Celebrated wit in the reign of Charles and James II. He is said to have been descend∣ed of an ancient family of Oxfordshire, and born about the year 1636; it is thought he had some part of his education at the university of Cam∣bridge, but in his younger years he travelled into France, and consequently made no long stay at the university. Upon his return, he, for some time, studied the Municipal Law at one of the Inns of Court, in which, it seems, he made but little progress, and like other men of sprightly genius, abandoned it for pleasure, and the gayer accomplishments.</P>
<P>In the year 1664 the town was obliged with his first performance for the stage, entitled the Comi∣cal Revenge, or Love in a Tub, the writing where∣of brought him acquainted, as he himself inform∣ed us, with the earl of Dorset, to whom it is by the author dedicated. The fame of this play, to∣gether with his easy, unreserved conversation, and happy address, rendered him a favourite with the leading wits, such as the duke of Buckingham, Sir Charles Sedley, the earl of Rochester, Sir Car Scroop. Being animated by this encouragement, in 1668, he brought another comedy upon the stage, entitled She Would if She Could; which gained him no less applause, and it was expected, that by the continuance of his studies, he would polish
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
and enliven the theatrical taste, and be no less con∣stant in such entertainments, than the most assidu∣ous of his cotemporaries, but he was too much addicted to pleasure, and being impelled by no necessity, he neglected the stage, and never writ, 'till he was forced to it, by the importunity of his friends. In 1676, his last comedy called the Man of Mode, or Sir Fopling Flutter, came on the stage, with the most extravagant success; he was then a servant to the beautiful duchess of York, of whom Dryden has this very singular-expression, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that he does not think, that at the general re∣surrection, she can be made to look more charm∣ing than now.'</Q> Sir George dedicates this play to his Royal Mistress, with the most courtly turns of compliment. In this play he is said to have drawn, or to use the modern cant, taken off, some of the contemporary coxcombs; and Mr. Dryden, in an Epilogue to it, has endeavoured to remove the suspicion of personal satire, and says, that the character of Flutter is meant to ridicule none in particular, but the whole fraternity of finished fops, the idolaters of new fashions.</P>
<P>His words are,<Q><L>True fops help nature's work, and go to school,</L>
<L>To file and finish God Almighty's fool:</L>
<L>Yet none Sir Fopling, him, or him, can call,</L>
<L>He's Knight o'th' Shire, and represents you all.</L></Q></P>
<P>But this industry, to avoid the imputation of per∣sonal satire, but served to heighten it; and the town soon found out originals to his characters. Sir Fopling was said to be drawn for one Hewit, a beau of those times, who, it seems, was such a creature as the poet ridiculed, but who, perhaps, like many other coxcombs, would never have been
<PB N="35" REF="38"/>
remembered, but for this circumstance, which trans∣mits his memory to posterity.</P>
<P>The character of Dorimant was supposed to repre∣sent the earl of Rochester, who was inconstant, faith∣less, and undetermined in his amours; and it is likewise said, in the character of Medley, that the poet has drawn out some sketch of himself, and from the authority of Mr. Bowman, who played Sir Fopling, or some other part in this comedy, it is said, that the very Shoemaker in Act I. was also meant for a real person, who, by his impro∣vident courses before, having been unable to make any profit by his trade, grew afterwards, upon the public exhibition of him, so industrious and notable, that he drew a crowd of the best customers to him, and became a very thriving tradesman. Whether the poet meant to display these characters, we cannot now determine, but it is certain, the town's ascribing them to some particular persons, was paying him a very high compliment, and if it proved no more, it at least demonstrated, a close imitation of nature, a beauty which consti∣tutes the greatest perfection of a comic poet.</P>
<P>Our author, it seems, was addicted to some gay ex∣travagances, such as gaming, and an unlicensed in∣dulgence in women and wine, which brought some satirical reflexions upon him. Gildon in his Lives of the Dramatic Poets, says, that upon marrying a fortune, he was knighted; the circumstances of it are these: He had, by his gaming and extravagance, so embarrassed his affairs, that he courted a rich widow in order to retrieve them; but she being an ambitious woman, would not condescend to marry him, unless he could make her a lady, which he was obliged to do by the purchase of a knight∣hood; and this appears in a Consolatary Epistle to captain Julian, from the duke of Buckingham, in which this match is reflected on. We have no ac∣count
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
of any issue he had by this lady, but from the information of Mr. Bowman we can say, that he cohabited. for some time, with the celebrated Mrs. Barry the actress, and had one daughter by her; that he settled 5 or 6000 l. on her, but that she died young.</P>
<P>From the same intelligence, it also appears, that Sir George was, in his person, a fair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Biogr. Brit. p. 1844.</NOTE>, slender, genteel man, but spoiled his countenance with d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inking, and other habits of intemperance. In his deportment he was very affable and courteous, of a generous disposition, which, with his free, lively, and natural vein of writing, acquired him the ge∣neral character of gentle George, and easy Ethe∣rege, in respect of which qualities, we often find him compared to Sir Charles Sedley. His court∣ly and easy behaviour so recommended him to the Duchess of York, that when on the accession of King James II. she became Queen, she sent him ambassador abroad, Gildon says, to Hamburgh; but it is pretty evident, that he was in that reign a minister at Ratisbon, at least, from the year 1686, to the time his majesty left this kingdom, if not later, but it appears that he was there, by his own letters wrote from thence to the earl of Mid∣dleton</P>
<P>After this last comedy, we meet with no more he ever wrote for the stage; however, there are preserved some letters of his in prose, pub∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed among a collection of Familiar Letters, by John earl of Rochester; two of which, sent to the duke of Buckingham, have particular merit, both for the archness of the turns, and the acuteness of the observation. He gives his lordship a humorous description of some of the Germans, their excessive drunkenness; their plodding stupidity and offensive indelicacy; he complains that he has no compani∣on
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
in that part of the world, no Sir Charles Sed∣leys, nor Buckinghams, and what is still worse, e∣ven deprived of the happiness of a mistress, for, the women there, he says, are so coy, and so nar∣rowly watched by their relations, that there is no possibility of accomplishing an intrigue. He men∣tions, however, one Monsieur Hoffman, who mar∣ried a French lady, with whom he was very great, and after the calamitous accident of Mr. Hoffman's being drowned, he pleasantly describes the grief of the widow, and the methods he took of removing her sorrow, by an attempt in which he succeeded. These two letters discover the true character of Etherege, as well as of the noble person to whom they were sent, and mark them as great libertines, in speculation as in practice.</P>
<P>As for the other compositions of our author, they consist chiefly of little airy sonnets, smart lam∣poons, and smooth panegyrics. All that we have met with more than is here mentioned, of his writing in prose, is a short piece, entitled An Ac∣count of the Rejoicing at the Diet of Ratisbon, performed by Sir George Etherege, Knight, resid∣ing there from his Majesty of Great Britain, up∣on Occasion of the Birth of the Prince of Wales; in a Letter from himself, printed in the Savoy 1688. When our author died, the writers of his life have been very deficient; Gildon says, that after the Revolution, he followed his master into France, and died there, or very soon after his ar∣rival in England from thence. But there was a report (say the authors of the Biograph. Brit. which they received from an ingenious gentleman) <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that Sir George came to an untimely death, by an unlucky accident at Ratisbon, for, after hav∣ing treated some company with a liberal enter∣tainment at his house there, when he had taken
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
his glass too freely, and, being through his great complaisance too forward, in waiting on his guests at their departure, flushed as he was, he tumbled down stairs, and broke his neck, and so fell a martyr to jollity and civility.'</Q></P>
<P>One of the earliest of our author's lesser poems, is that addressed to her Grace the Marchioness of Newcastle, after reading her poems, and as it is esteemed a very elegant panegyric, we shall give the conclusion of it as a specimen.</P>
<P>While we, your praise, endeavouring to re∣hearse,<Q><L>Pay that great duty in our humble verse;</L>
<L>Such as may justly move your anger, now,</L>
<L>Like Heaven forgive them, and accept them too.</L>
<L>But what we cannot, your brave hero pays,</L>
<L>He builds those monuments we strive to raise;</L>
<L>Such as to after ages shall make known,</L>
<L>While he records your deathless fame his own:</L>
<L>So when an artist some rare beauty draws,</L>
<L>Both in our wonder there, and our applause.</L>
<L>His skill, from time secures the glorious dame,</L>
<L>And makes himself immortal in her fame.</L></Q></P>
<P>Besides his Songs, little panegyrical Poems and Sonnets, he wrote two Satires against Nell Gwyn, one of the King's mistresses, though there is no account how a quarrel happened between them; the one is called Madam Nelly's Complaint, be∣ginning,<Q><L>If Sylla's ghost made bloody Cat'line start.</L></Q></P>
<P>The other is called the Lady of Pleasure, with its Argument at the Head of it, whereof the first line is,<Q><PB N="39" REF="42"/>
<L>The life of Nelly truly shewn.</L></Q></P>
<P>Sir George spent a life of ease, pleasure, and affluence, at least never was long, nor much, ex∣posed to want. He seems to have possessed a sprightly genius, to have had an excellent turn for comedy, and very happy in a courtly dialogue. We have no proof of his being a scholar, and was rather born, than made a poet. He has not escaped the censure of the critics; for his works are so extremely loose and licentious, as to render them dangerous to young, unguarded minds: and on this account our witty author is, indeed, justly liable to the severest censure of the virtuous, and sober part of mankind.</P>

<HEAD>WILLIAM MOUNTFORD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman, who was very much distin∣guished as a player, was born in the year 1659, but of what family we have no account, farther than that they were of Staffordshire; the extraordinary circumstances of Mr. Mountford's death, have drawn more attention upon him, than he might otherwise have had; and though he was not very considerable as a poet, yet he was of great eminence as an actor. Mr. Cibber, in his Apology for his own Life, has mentioned him with the greatest respect, and drawn his character with strong touches of admiration. After having deline∣ated the theatrical excellences of Kynaston, Sand∣ford, &amp;c. he thus speaks of Mountford. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Of per∣son he was tall, well made, fair, and of an agree∣able aspect, his voice clear, full, and melodious; in tragedy he was the most affecting lover with∣in my memory; his addresses had a resistless recommendation from the very tone of his voice, which gave his words such softness, that as Dry∣den says,'<Q><L>— ' Like flakes of feather'd snow,</L>
<L>' They melted as they fell.</L></Q> 'All this he particularly verified in that scene of Alexander, where the hero throws himself at the feet of Statira for pardon of his past infidelities. There we saw the great, the tender, the peni∣tent,
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
the despairing, the transported, and the a∣miable, in the highest perfection. In comedy he gave the truest life to what we call the fine gentleman; his spirit shone the brighter for be∣ing polished by decency. In scenes of gaiety he never broke into the regard that was due to the presence of equal, or superior characters, tho' inferior actors played them; he filled the stage, not by elbowing and crossing it before others, or disconcerting their action, but by surpassing them in true and masterly touches of nature; he never laughed at his own jest, unless the point of his raillery upon another required it; he had a particular talent in giving life to bons mots and repartees; the wit of the poet seemed al∣ways to come from him extempore, and sharp∣ened into more wit from his brilliant manner of delivering it; he had himself a good share of it, or what is equal to it, so lively a pleasant∣ness of humour, that when either of these fell into his hands upon the stage, he wantoned with them to the highest delight of his auditors. The agreeable was so natural to him, that even in that dissolute character of the Rover, he seemed to wash off the guilt from vice, and gave it charms and merit; for though it may be a re∣proach to the poet to draw such characters, not only unpunished, but rewarded, the actor may still be allowed his d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e praise in his excellent per∣formance; and this was a distinction which, when this comedy was acted at Whitehall, King William's Queen Mary was pleased to make in favour of Mountford, notwithstanding her disap∣probation of the play; which was heightened by the consideration of its having been written by a lady, viz. Mrs. Behn, from whom more mo∣desty might have been expected.' <P>'He had, besides all this, a variety in his ge∣nius, which few capital actors have shewn, or per∣haps have thought it any addition of their me∣rit
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
to arrive at; he could entirely change him∣self, could at once throw off the man of sense, for the brisk, vain, rude, lively coxcomb, the false, flashy pretender to wit, and the dupe of his own sufficiency; of this he gave a delight∣ful instance, in the character of Sparkish, in Wycherley's Country Wife: in that of Sir Court∣ly Nice, by Crown, his excellence was still great∣er; there his whole man, voice, mien, and ge∣sture, was no longer Mountford, but another person; there, the insipid, soft civility, the ele∣ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and formal mien, the drawling delicacy of voice, the stately flatness of his address, and the empty eminence of his attitudes, were so nicely observed, that had he not been an entire master of nature, had he not kept his judgment, as it were a centinel upon himself, not to admit the least likeness of what he used to be, to enter in∣to any part of his performance, he could not possibly have so compleatly finished it.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Cibber further observes, that if, some years after the death of Mountford, he himself had any success in those parts, he acknowledges the advan∣tages he had received from the just idea, and strong impressions from Mountford's acting them. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Had he been remembered (says he) when I first at∣tempted them, my defects would have been more easily discovered, and consequently my favoura∣ble reception in them must have been very much, and justly abated. If it could be remem∣bered, how much he had the advantage of me in voice and person, I could not here be suspected of an affected modesty, or overvaluing his ex∣cellence: for he sung a clear, counter-tenor, and had a melodious, warbling throat, which could not but set off the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast scene of Sir Courtly with uncommon happiness, which I, alas! could only struggle through, with the faint excuses, and real confidence of a fine singer, under the imperfection of a feigned, and sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaming treble,
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
which, at least, could only shew you what I would have done, had nature been more favour∣able to me.'</Q></P>
<P>This is the amiable representation which Mr. Cibber makes of his old favourite, and whose judgment in theatrical excellences has been ever indisputed. But this finished performer did not live to reap the advantages which would have arisen from the great figure he made upon the stage.</P>
<P>He fell in the 33d year of his age, by the hand of an asiassin, who cowardly murdered him, and fled from justice. As we imagine it will not be unpleasing to the reader to be made acquaint∣ed with the most material circumstances relating to that affair, we shall here insert them, as they appear on the trial of lord Mohun, who was ar∣raigned for that murder, and acquitted by his peers. Lord Mohun, it is well known, was a man of loose morals, a rancorous spirit, and, in short, reflected no honour on his titles. It is a true observation, that the temper and disposition of a man may be more accurately known by the com∣pany he keeps, than by any other means of read∣ing the human heart: Lord Mohun had con∣tracted a great intimacy with one captain Hill, a man of scandalous morals, and despicable life; and was so fond of this fellow, whom, it seems, nature had wonderfully formed to be a cut-throat, that he entered into his schemes, and became a par∣ty in promoting his most criminal pleasures.</P>
<P>This murderer had long entertained a passion sor Mrs. Bracegirdle, so well known, as an ex∣cellent actress, and who died not many years ago, that it would be superfluous to give a particular account of her; his passion was re∣jected with disdain by Mrs. Bracegirdle, who did not think such a heart as his worth possessing. The contempt with which she used captain
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
Hill fired his resentment; he valued himself for being a gentleman, and an officer in the army, and thought he had a right, at the first onset, to triumph over the heart of an actress; but in this he found himself miserably mistaken: Hill, who could not bear the contempt shewn him by Mrs. Bracegirdle, conceived that her aversion must proceed from having previously engaged her heart to some more favoured lover; and though Mr. Mountford was a married man, he became j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a¦lous of him, probably, from no other reason, than the respect with which he observed Mr. Mountford treat her, and their frequently playing together in the same scene. Confirmed in this suspicion, he resolved to be revenged on Mount∣ford, and as he could not possess Mrs. Bracegir∣dle by gentle means, he determined to have re∣course to violence, and hired some ruffians to as∣sist him in carrying her off. His chief accomplice in this scheme was lord Mohun, to whom he communicated his intention, and who concurred with him in it. They appointed an evening for that purpose, hired a number of soldiers, and a coach, and went to the playhouse in order to find Mrs. Bracegirdle, but she having no part in the play of that night, did not come to the house. They then got intelligence that she was gone with her mother to sup at one Mrs. Page's in Drury-Lane; thither they went, and fixed their post, in expecta∣tion of Mrs. Bracegirdle's coming out, when they intended to have executed their scheme against her. She at last came out, accompanied with her mother and Mr. Page: the two adventurers made a sign to their hired bravo's, who laid their hands on Mrs. Bracegirdle: but her mother, who threw her arms round her waist, preventing them from thrusting her immediately into the coach, and Mr. Page gaining time to call assistance, their attempt was
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>
frustrated, and Mrs. Bracegirdle, her mother, and Mr. Page, were safely conveyed to her own house in Howard-street in the Strand. Lord Mohun and Hill, enraged at this disappointment, resolved, since they were unsuccessful in one part of their de∣sign, they would yet attempt another; and that night vowed revenge against Mr. Mountford.</P>
<P>They went to the street where Mr. Mountford lived, and there lay in wait for him: Old Mrs. Bracegirdle and another gentlewoman who had heard them vow revenge against Mr. Mountford, sent to his house, to desire his wife to let him know his danger, and to warn him not to come home that night, but unluckily no messenger Mrs. Mountford sent was able to find him: Captain Hill and lord Mohun paraded in the streets with their swords drawn; and when the watch made enquiry into the cause of this, lord Mohun answered, that he was a peer of the realm, and dared them to touch him at their peril; the night-officers being in∣timidated at this threat, left them unmolested, and went their rounds. Towards midnight Mr. Mountford going home to his own house was saluted in a very friendly manner, by lord Mohun; and as his lordship seemed to cary no marks of resentment in his behaviour, he used the freedom to ask him, how he came there at that time of night? to which his lordship replied, by asking if he had not heard the affair of the woman? Mountford asked what woman? to which he answered Mrs. Bracegirdle; I hope, says he, my lord, you do not encourage Mr. Hill in his attempt upon Mrs. Bracegirdle; which however is no concern of mine; when he uttered these words, Hill, behind his back, gave him some despe∣rate blows on his head, and before Mr. Mountford had time to draw, and stand on his defence, he base∣ly run him thro' the body, and made his escape; the alarm of murder being given, the constable seized lord Mohun, who upon hearing that Hill had es∣caped
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
expressed great satisfaction, and said he did not care if he were hanged for him: When the evi∣dences were examined at Hick's-Hall, one Mr. Ben∣croft, who attended Mr. Mountford, swore that Mr. Mountford declared to him as a dying man, that while he was talking to lord Mohun, Hill struck him, with his left hand, and with his right hand run him thro' the body, before he had time to draw his sword.</P>
<P>Thus fell the unfortunate Mountford by the hand of an assassin, without having given him any provocation; save that which his own jealousy had raised, and which could not reasonably be imputed to Mountford as a crime.</P>
<P>Lord Mohun, as we have already observed, was tried, and acquitted by his peers; as it did not ap∣pear, that he immediately assisted Hill, in perpetra∣ting the murder, or that they had concerted it be∣fore; for tho' they were heard to vow revenge against Mountford, the word murther was never mentioned. It seems abundantly clear, that lord Mohun, however, if not active, was yet accessary to the murther; and had his crime been high trea∣son, half the evidence which appeared against him, might have been sufficient to cost him his head. This nobleman himself was killed at last in a duel with the duke of Hamilton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The foundation of the quarrel between lord Mohun and the duke (however it might be improved by party suggestions) was a law suit between these noblemen, on account of part of the earl of Macclesfield's estate, which Mr. Savage would have been heir to, had not his mother, to facilitate her de∣signed divorce from that earl (with the pleasing view of having her large fortune restored to her, and the no less pleasing pro∣spect of being freed from an uncomfortable husband) declared unhappy Savage to be illegitimate, and natural son of the then earl Rivers. Of this farther notice will be taken in Savage's Life.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>THOMAS SHADWELL.</HEAD>
<P>THIS celebrated poet-laureat was descended of a very antient family in Staffordshire; the eldest branch of which has enjoyed an estate there of five-hundred pounds per ann. He was born about the year 1640, at Stanton-Hall in Norfolk, a seat of his father's, and educated at Caius College in Cambridge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Dictionary. See the article Shadwell.</NOTE>, where his father had been likewise bred; and then placed in the middle Temple, to study the law; where having spent some time, he travelled abroad. Upon his return home he became acquainted with the most celebrat∣ed persons of wit, and distinguished quality, in that age; which was so much addicted to poetry and polite literature, that it was not easy for him, who had no doubt a native relish for the same ac∣complishments, to abstain from these the fashionable studies and amusements of those times. He applied himself chiefly to the dramatic kind of writing, in which he had considerable success. At the revolution, Mr. Dryden, who had so warmly espoused the opposite interest, was dispossessed of his place of Poet Laureat, and Mr. Shadwell succeeded him in it, which em∣ployment he possessed till his death. Mr. Shadwell has been illustrious, for nothing so much as the quarrel which subsisted between him and Dryden, who held him in the greatest contempt. We cannot discover what was the cause of Mr. Dryden's aversion to Shadwell, or how this quarrel began, unless it was
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>
occasioned by the vacant Laurel being bestowed on Mr. Shadwell: But it is certain, the former prose∣cuted his resentment severely, and, in his Mac Fleck∣noe, has transmitted his antagonist to posterity in no advantageous light. It is the nature of satire to be biting, but it is not always its nature to be true: We cannot help thinking that Mr. Dryden has treated Shadwell a little too unmercifully; and has violated truth to make the satire more pungent. He says, in the piece abovementioned,<Q><L>Others to some faint meaning make pretence,</L>
<L>But Shadwell never deviates into sense.</L></Q></P>
<P>Which is not strictly true. There are high authorities in favour of many of his Comedies, and the best wits of the age gave their testimony for them: They have in them fine strokes of humour, the characters are often original, strongly mark'd, and well sustained; add to this, that he had the greatest expedition in writing imaginable, and sometimes produced a play in less than a month. Shadwell, as it appears from Rochester's Session of the Poets, was a great favourite with Otway, and as they lived in intimacy together, it might perhaps be the occasion of Dryden's expressing so much contempt for Otway; which his cooler judgment could never have directed him to do.</P>
<P>Mr. Shadwell died the 19th of December 1692, in the fifty-second year of his age, as we are informed by the inscription upon his monument in Westminster Abbey; tho' there may be some mistake in that date; for it is said in the title page of his funeral sermon preached by Dr. Nicholas Brady, that he was in∣terred at Chelsea, on the 24th of November, that year. This sermon was published 1693, in quarto, and in it Dr. Brady tells us, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That our author was a man of great honesty and integrity, an inviolable
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>
fidelity and strictness in his word, an unalterable friendship wherever he professed it, and however the world may be mistaken in him, he had a much deeper sense of religion than many who pretended more to it. His natural and acquired abilities, con∣tinues the Dr. made him very amiable to all who knew and conversed with him, a very few being equal in the becoming qualities, which adorn, and set off a complete gentleman; his very enemies, if he have now any left, will give him this cha∣racter, at least if they knew him so thoroughly as I did.—His death seized him suddenly, but he could not be unprepared, since to my certain know∣ledge he never took a dose of opium, but he so∣lemnly recommended himself to God by prayer.'</Q></P>
<P>When some persons urged to the then lord cham∣berlain, that there were authors who had better pre∣tensions to the Laurel; his lordship replied, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'He did not pretend to say how great a poet Shadwell might be, but was sure he was an honest man.'</Q></P>
<P>Besides his dramatic works, he wrote several o∣ther pieces of poetry; the chief of which are his congratulatory poem on the Prince of Orange's com∣ing to England; another on queen Mary; his tran∣slation of the 10th Satire of Juvenal, &amp;c. Shadwell in his Comedies imitated Ben Johnson, and propo∣sed him as his model of excellence, with what degree of success we shall not take upon us to determine, but proceed to give an account of his plays.<LIST>

<ITEM>4. The Virtuoso, a Comedy; acted at the duke's theatre, printed at London 1676, in quarto, dedi∣cated to the duke of Newcastle. <P>Mr. Langbaine observes, that no body will deny this play its due applause; at least I know, says he, that the university of Oxford, who may be allowed competent judges of comedy, especially such cha∣racters as Sir Nicholas Gimcrack, and Sir Formal Trifle, applauded it. And as no man ever under∣took to discover the frailties of such pretenders to this kind of knowledge before Mr. Shadwell, so none since Johnson's time, ever drew so many different characters of humour, and with such success.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Pysche, a Tragedy; acted at the duke's thea∣tre, printed in London 1675 in 4to, and dedica∣ted to the duke of Monmouth. In the preface he tell us, that this play was written in five weeks.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The Libertine, a Tragedy; acted by his royal highness's servants, printed in London 1676, in quarto, and dedicated to the duke of Newcastle. In the preface Mr. Shadwell observes, that the story from which he took the hint of this play, is fa∣mous all over Spain, Italy, and France. It was first used in a Spanish play, the Spaniards hav∣ing a tradition of such a vicious Spaniard, as is represented in this play; from them the Italian comedians took it; the French borrowed it from them, and four several plays have been made upon the story.</ITEM>

7. Epsom Wells, a comedy; acted at the duke's theatre; printed at London 1676, in 4to. and de∣dicated to the duke of Newcastle.

<ITEM>8. The History of Timon of Athens the Man∣hater; acted at the duke's theatre, printed at London 1678, in 4to. In the dedication to George duke of Buckingham he observes, that this play was originally Shakespear's, who never made, says he, more masterly strokes than in this; yet I can truly say, I have made it into a play.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. The Miser, a Comedy; acted at the thea∣tre-royal, dedicated to the earl of Dorset. In the preface our author observes, he took the founda∣tion of it from Moliere's L'Avare.</ITEM>

<ITEM>11. The Lancashire Witches, and Teague O Di∣velly, the Irish priest, a comedy; acted at the duke's theatre, printed at London 1682. Our author has a long preface to this play, in which he vin∣dicates his piece from the charge of reflecting upon the church, and the sacred order.

<HEAD>Sir WILLIAM KILLEGREW.</HEAD>
<P>THE eldest son of Sir Robert Killegrew, Knt chamberlain to the Queen, was born at the Manor of Hanworth, near Hampton-Court, in the month of May, 1605. He became a gentleman commoner in St. John's College in Midsummer term 1622; where continuing about three years he tra∣velled beyond seas, and after his return, was made governor of Pendennis castle, and of Falmouth ha∣ven in Cornwall, with command of the militia in the west part of that county. After this he was cal∣led to attend King Charles I. as one of the gentle∣men ushers of his privy chamber; in which employ∣ment he continued till the breaking out of the great rebellion; and had the command given him of one of the two great troops of horse that guarded the King's person, during the whole course of the was between his Majesty and his Parliament. Our author was in attendance upon the King when the court resided at Oxford, and was created doctor of the civil laws 1642; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wood, Athen. Oxon. vol. 2.</NOTE> and upon the run<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the King's affairs, he suffered for his attachment to him, and compounded with the republicans for his estate.</P>
<P>Upon the restoration of King Charles II. he was the first of his father's servants that he took any notice of, and made him gentleman-usher of his privy chamber: the same place he enjoyed under the deceased King. Upon Charles IId's mar∣riage with Donna Catherina of Portugal, he was created his Majesty's first vice chamberlain, in which honourable station he continued twenty-two years.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="59"/>
His dramatic works are,<LIST>

<ITEM>2. Pandora, or the Converts, a Comedy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Siege of Urbin, a Tragi-Comedy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Selindra, a Tragi-Comedy.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>All these plays were printed together in folio, Oxon 1666. There is another play ascribed to our author, called the Imperial Tragedy, printed in 1699; the chief part was taken out of a Latin play, and much altered by him for his own diversion; tho' upon the importunity of his friends, he was prevailed upon to publish it, but without his name. The plot is founded upon the history of Zeno, the 12th emperor of Constantinople after Con∣stantine. Sir William Killegrew's plays have been applauded by men very eminent in poetry, particu∣cularly Mr. Waller, who addresses a copy of verses to him upon his altering Pandora from a tragedy into a comedy, because not approved on the stage.</P>
<P>Sir William has also a little poem extant, which was set to music by Mr. Henry Lawes, a man in the highest reputation of any of his pro∣fession in his time. Mr. Wood says, that after our author had retired from court in his declining age, he wrote</P>

<HEAD>Sir ROBERT HOWARD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was a younger son of Tho∣mas earl of Berkshire, by Elizabeth his wife, one of the daughters and coheirs of William lord Burghley, and received his education at Magdalen∣college, Oxford, under the tuition of Dr. E. Drope. During the civil wars, he suffered with the rest of his family, who maintained their loyalty to the unfortunate King Charles I. Upon the resto∣ration, our author was made a knight, and was chosen one of the burgesses for Stockbridge in Hampshire, to serve in the Parliament which be∣gan at Westminster 8th of May 1661; he was quickly preferred to the place of auditor of the Exchequer, then worth some thousand pounds per annum, and was reckoned one of King Charles's creatures, whom he advanced, on account of his faithful services in cajoling the Parliament for Mo∣ney.</P>
<P>In the year 1679 he was chosen burgess for Castle-rising in Norfolk, to serve in that Parliament which began at Westminster on the 17th of Octo∣ber 1680. When the revolution was effected, and King William ascended the throne, he was elected burgess again for Castle-rising, to sit in the Parlia∣ment which began the 22d of January 1688, was made one of the privy council, about the 16th of February took the usual oaths, and commenced from that moment a violent persecutor of the Non∣jurors,
<PB N="58" REF="61"/>
and disclaimed all manner of conversation and inter course with any of that character. He is said to have been a man extremely positive, and a pretender to a more general understanding than he really possessed. His obstinacy and pride procured him many enemies, amongst whom the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke of Buckingham was the first; who intended to have exposed Sir Robert under the name of Bil∣boa in the Rehearsal; but the plague which then prevailed occasioned the theatres to be shut up, and the people of fashion to quit the town. In this in∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eval he altered his resolution, and levelled his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cale at a much greater name, under that of Bayes.</P>
<P>Thomas Shadwell the poet, tho' a man of the same principles with Sir Robert, concerning the revolution and state matters, was yet so angry with the knight for his supercilious domineering manner of behaving, that he points him out under the name of Sir Positive At All, one of his cha∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cters in the comedy called the Sullen Lovers, or the Impertinents; and amongst the same per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons is the lady Vain, a Courtezan, which the wits then understood to be the mistress of Sir Ro∣bert Howard, whom he afterwards thought pro∣per to marry.</P>
<P>In February 1692, being then in the decline of life, he married one Mrs Dives, maid of ho∣nour to the Queen. The merit of this author seems to have been of a low rate, for very little is preserved concerning him, and none of his works are now read; nor is he ever mentioned, but when that circumstance of the duke of Buckingham's in∣tending to ridicule him, is talked of.</P>
<P>Had Sir Robert been a man of any parts, he had sufficient advantages from his birth and for∣tune to have made a figure, but the highest notice which he can claim in the republic of letters, is, that he was brother in law to Dryden.</P>

<HEAD>RICHARD FLECKNOE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS poet lived in the reign of King Charles II. and is more remarkable for having given name to a satire of Mr. Dryden's, than for all his own works. He is said to have been ori∣ginally a jesuit, and to have had connexions in consequence thereof, with such persons of distinc∣tion in London as were of the Roman Catholic persuasion, Langbaine says, his acquaintance with the nobility was more than with the muses, and he had a greater propensity to rhiming, than genius to poetry.</P>
<P>Tho' he wrote several plays, yet he never could obtain the favour to have more than one of them acted.</P>
<P>His dramatic works are:<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Damoiselles a-la-mode, a Comedy, printed 8vo. Lond. 1667, and addressed to the duke and duchess of Newcastle. This comedy was design∣ed by the author to have been acted by his Ma∣jesty's servants, which they thought proper how∣ever to refuse, we know not for what reason.—The poet indeed has assigned one, whether true or false is immaterial; but it may serve to shew his humour.

<P>This anger of Mr. Flecknoe's at the players for refusing the piece, bears some resemblance to that of Bayes, when the players went to dinner without his leave. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'How! are the players gone to dinner?

<ITEM>2. Ermina, or the chaste lady; printed in octavo, London 1665.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Love's Dominion; a dramatic piece, which the author says, is full of excellent morality; and is written as a pattern of the reformed stage, printed in octavo, London 1654, and dedicated to the lady Elizabeth Claypole. In this epistle the author insi∣nuates the use of plays, and begs her mediation to gain license to act them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Love's Kingdom, a Tragi-Comedy; not as it was acted at the theatre in Lincoln's-Inn; but as it was written and since corrected, printed in octavo, London 1664, and dedicated to his excellency Wil∣liam lord marquis of Newcastle. This is no more than the former play a little alter'd, with a new title; and after the king's return, it seems the poet obtained leave to have it acted, but it had the mis∣fortune to be damned by the audience, which Mr. Flecknoe stiles the people, and calls them judges without judgment, for want of its being rightly re∣presented to them; he owns it wants much of the ornaments of the stage, but that, he says, by a lively imagination may be easily supplied. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'To the same purpose he speaks of his Damoiselles à la Mode:

<HEAD>JOHN DRYDEN, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS illustrious Poet was son of Erasmus Dryden, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ickermish in Northamptonshire, and born at Aldwincle, near Oundle 1631<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Athen. Oxon.</NOTE>, he had his education in grammar learning, at Westminster∣school, under the famous Dr. Busby, and was from thence elected in 1650, a scholar of Trinity-College in Cambridge.</P>
<P>We have no account of any extraordinary indi∣cations of genius given by this great poet, while in his earlier days; and he is one instance how little regard is to be paid to the figure a boy makes at school: Mr. Dryden was turned of thirty before he introduced any play upon the stage, and his first, called the Wild Gallants, met with a very indifferent reception; so that if he had not been im∣pelled by the force of genius and propension, he had never again attempted the stage: a circumstance which the lovers of dramatic poetry must ever have regretted, as they would in this case have been de∣prived of one of the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est ornaments that ever adorned the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rofession.</P>
<P>The year before he left the university, he wrote a poem on the death of lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Hastings, a perform∣ance, say some of his critics, very unworthy of him∣self, and of the astonishing genius he afterwards discovered.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="68"/>
That Mr. Dryden had at this time no fixed prin∣ciples, either in religion or politics, is abundantly evident, from his heroic stanza's on Oliver Cromwel, written after his funeral 1658; and immediately upon the restoration he published Astraea Redux, a poem, on the happy restoration of Charles the IId; and the same year, his Panegyric to the king on his coronation: In the former of these pieces, a re∣markable distich has expos'd our poet to the ridicule of the wits.<Q><L>An horrid stillness first invades the ear,</L>
<L>And in that silence we the tempest hear.</L></Q></P>
<P>Which it must be owned is downright nonsense, and a contradiction in terms: Amongst others captain Radcliff has ridiculed this blunder in the following lines of his News from Hell.<Q><L>Laureat who was both learn'd and florid,</L>
<L>Was damn'd long since for silence horrid:</L>
<L>Nor had there been such clutter made,</L>
<L>But that his silence did invade.</L>
<L>Invade, and so it might, that's clear;</L>
<L>But what did it invade? An ear!</L></Q></P>
<P>In 1662 he addressed a poem to the lord chan∣cellor Hyde, presented on new-year's-day; and the same year published a satire on the Dutch. His next piece, was his Annus Mirabilis, or the Year of Wonders, 1668, an historical poem, which cele∣brated the duke of York's victory over the Dutch. In the same year Mr. Dryden succeeded Sir William Davenant as Poet Laureat, and was also made historiographer to his majesty; and that year published his Essay on Dramatic Po∣etry, addressed to Charles earl of Dorset and Middle∣sex. Mr. Dryden tells his patron, that the writing
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
this Essay, served as an amusement to him in the country, when he was driven from town by the violence of the plague, which then raged in Lon∣don; and he diverted himself with thinking on the theatres, as lovers do by ruminating on their absent, mistresses: He there justifies the method of writing plays in verse, but confesses that he has quitted the practice, because he found it troublesome and flow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He might have added, 'twas unnatural.</NOTE>. In the preface we are informed that the drift of this discourse was to vindicate the honour of the English writers from the censure of those who unjustly prefer the French to them Langbaine has injuriously treated Mr. Dryden, on account of his dramatic performances, and charges him as a licentious plagiary. The truth is, our author as a dramatist is less eminent than in any other sphere of poetry; but, with all his faults, he is even in that respect the most eminent of his time.</P>
<P>The critics have remarked, that as to tragedy, he seldom touches the passions, but deals rather in pompous language, poetical flights, and descrip∣tions; and too frequently makes his characters speak better than they have occasion, or ought to do, when their sphere in the drama is considered: And it is peculiar to Dryden (says Mr. Addison) to make his personages, as wise, witty, elegant and polite as himself. That he could not so intimately affect the tender passions, is certain, for we find no play of his, in which we are much disposed to weep; and we are so often inchanted with beautiful descrip∣tions, and noble flights of fancy, that we forget the business of the play, and are only attentive to the poet, while the characters sleep. Mr. Gildon ob∣serves in his laws of poetry, that when it was re∣commended to Mr. Dryden to turn his thoughts to
<PB N="67" REF="70"/>
a translation of Euripides, rather than of Homer, he confessed that he had no relish for that poet, who was a great master of tragic simplicity. Mr. Gildon, further observes, as a confirmation that Dryden's taste for tragedy was not of the genuine sort, that he constantly expressed great contempt for Otway, who is universally allowed to have succeeded very hap∣pily in affecting the tender passions: Yet Mr. Dryden, in his preface to the translation of M. Du Fresnoy, speaks more favourably of Otway; and after men∣tioning these instances, Gildon ascribes this taste in Dryden, to his having read many French Romances.—The truth is, if a poet would affect the heart, he must not exceed nature too much, nor colour too high; distressful circumstances, short speeches, and pathetic observations never fail to move in∣finitely beyond the highest rant, or long declamations in tragedy: The simplicity of the drama was Otway's peculiar excellence; a living poet observes, that from Otway to our own times,<Q><L>From bard to bard, the frigid caution crept,</L>
<L>And declamation roar'd while passion slept.</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Dryden seems to be sensible, that he was not born to write comedy; for, says he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I want that gaiety of humour which is required in it; my con∣versation is slow and dull, my humour saturnine and reserved. In short, I am none of those who endeavour to break jests in company, and make repartees; so that those who decry my comedies, do me no injury, except it be in point of profit: Reputation in them is the last thing to which I shall pretend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Defence, or the Essay on Dramatic Poetry.</NOTE>.'</Q></P>
<P>This ingenuous confession of inability, one would imagine were sufficient to silence the clamour of the
<PB N="68" REF="71"/>
critics against Mr. Dryden in that particular; but, however true it may be, that Dryden did not suc∣ceed to any degree in com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy, I shall endeavour to support my a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertion, that in tragedy, with all his faults, be is still the most excellent of his time. The end of tragedy is to instruct the mind, as well as move the passi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s; and where there are no shining sentiments, the mind may be affected, but not im∣proved; and however prevalent the passion of grief may be over the heart of man, it is certain that he may feel distress in the acutest manner, and not be much the wiser for it. The tragedies of Otway, Lee and Southern, are irresistibly moving, but they convey not such grand sentiments, and their lan∣guage is far from being so poetical as Dryden's; now, if one dramatic poet writes to move, and an∣other to enchant and instruct, as instruction is of greater consequence than being agitated, it follows naturally, that the latter is the most excellent writer, and possesses the greatest genius.</P>
<P>But perhaps our poet would have wrote better in both kinds of the drama, had not the necessity of his circumstances obliged him to comply with the po∣pular taste. He himself, in his dedication to the Spanish Fryar, insinuates as much. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I remember, says he, some verses of my own Maximin and Almanzor, which cry vengeance upon me for their extravagance. All that I can say for those pas∣sages, which are I hope not many, is, that I knew they were bad when I wrote them. But I repent of them amongst my sins, and if any of their fellows intrude by chance, into my present writings, I draw a veil over all these Dalilahs of the theatre, and am resolved, I will settle myself no reputation upon the applause of fools. 'Tis not that I am mor∣tified to all ambition, but I scorn as much to take it from half witted judges, as I should to raise an estate by cheating of bubbles.

<P>In 1671 Mr. Dryden was publicly ridiculed on the stage, in the duke of Buckingham's comedy, called the Rehearsal, under the character of Bays: This character, we are informed, in the Key to the Rehearsal, was originally intended for Sir Robert Howard, under the name of Bilboa; but the repre∣sentation being put a stop to, by the breaking out of the plague, in 1665, it was laid by for several years, and not exhibited on the stage till 1671, in which interval, Mr. Dryden being advanced to the Laurel, the noble author changed the name of his poet, from Bilboa to Bays, and made great altera∣tions in his play, in order to ridicule several dramatic performances, that appeared since the first writing it. Those of Mr. Dryden, which fell under his grace's lash, were the Wild Gallant, Tyrannic Love, the Conquest of Granada, Marriage A-la-Mode, and Love in a Nunnery: Whatever was extravagant, or too warmly expressed, or any way unnatural, the author has ridiculed by parody.</P>
<P>Mr. Dryden affected to despise the satire levelled at him in the Rehearsal, as appears from his dedica∣tion of the translation of Juvenal and Persius, where speaking of the many lampoons, and libels that had been written against him, he says, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I answered not to the Rehearsal, because I knew the author sat to himself when he drew the pic∣ture, and was the very Bays of his own farce; because also I knew my betters were more con∣cerned than I was in that satire; and lastly, be∣cause

<P>In 1679 came out an Essay on Satire, said to be written jointly by Mr. Dryden and the earl of Mul∣grave; this piece, which was handed about in ma∣nuscript, containing Reflexions on the Duchess of Portsmouth, and the Earl of Rochester; who sus∣pecting, as Wood says, Mr. Dryden to be the au∣thor, hired three ruffians to cudgel him in Wills's coffee-house at eight o'clock at night. This short anecdote, I think, cannot be told without indigna∣tion. It proved Rochester was a malicious coward, and, like other cowards, cruel and insolent; his soul was incapable of any thing that approached towards generosity, and when his resentment was heated, he pursued revenge, and retained the most lasting hatred; he had always entertained a prejudice against Dryden, from no other motive than envy: Dryden's plays met with success, and this was enough to fire the resentment of Rochester, who was naturally envious. In order to hurt the cha∣racter, and shake the interest of this noble poet, he recommended Crown, an obscure man, to write a Masque for the court, which was Dryden's pro∣vince, as poet-laureat, to perform. Crown in this succeeded, but soon after, when his play called the Conquest of Jerusalem met with such extra∣vagant applause, Rochester, jealous of his new favourite, not only abandoned him, but com∣menced from that moment his enemy.</P>

could not have been found, than lord Rochester, and the duchess of Portsmouth. As for Rochester, he had not genius enough to enter the lists with Dryden, so he fell upon another method of revenge; and meanly hired bravoes to assault him.</P>
<P>In 1680 came out a translation of Ovid's Epi∣stles in English verse, by several hands, two of which were translated by Mr. Dryden, who also wrote the preface. In the year following our au∣thor published Absalom and Achitophel. It was first printed without his name, and is a severe satire against the contrivers and abettors of the opposi∣tion against King Charles II. In the same year that Absalom and Achitophel was published, the Medal, a Satire, was likewise given to the public. This piece is aimed against sedition, and was occasioned by the striking of a medal, on account of the indictment against the earl of Shaftsbury for high treason being found ignoramus by the grand jury, at the Old Bailey, November 1681: For which the Whig party made great rejoicings by ringing of bells, bonfires, &amp;c. in all parts of Lon∣don. The poem is introduced with a very sati∣rical epistle to the Whigs, in which the author says, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I have one favour to desire you at parting, that when you think of answering this poem, you would employ the same pens against it, who have combated with so much success against Absalom and Achitophel, for then you may as∣sure yourselves of a clear victory without the least reply. Rail at me abundantly, and not break a custom to do it with wit. By this me∣thod you will gain a considerable point, which is wholly to wave the answer of my arguments. If God has not blessed you with the talent of rhiming, make use of my poor stock and wel∣come; let your verses run upon my feet, and for the utmost refuge of notorious blockheads, reduced to the last extremity of sense, turn my

own lines against me, and in utter despair of my own satire, make me satirize myself.'</Q> The whole poem is a severe invective against the earl of Shaftsbury, who was uncle to that earl who wrote the Characteristics. Mr. Elkanah Settle wrote an answer to this poem, entitled the Medal Re∣versed. However contemptible Settle was as a poet, yet such was the prevalence of parties at that time, that, for some years, he was Dryden's rival on the stage. In 1682 came out his Religio Laici, or a Layman's Faith; this piece is intended as a defence of revealed religion, and the excellency and authority of the scriptures, as the only rule of faith and manners, against Deists, Papists, and Pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yterians. He acquaints us in the preface, that it was written for an ingenious young gen∣tleman, his friend; upon his translation of Father Simons's Critical History of the Old Testament, and that the stile of it was epistolary.</P>
<P>In 1684 he published a translation of M. Maim∣bourg's History of the League, in which he was employed by the command of King Charles II. on account of the pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n parallel between the trou∣bles of France, and those of Great Britain. Upon the death of Charles II. he wrote his Threnodia Augustalis, a Poem, sacred to the happy memory of that Prince. Soon after the accession of James II. our author turned Roman Catholic, and by this extraordinary step drew upon himself abun∣dance of ridicule from wits of the opposite faction; and in 1689 he wrote a Defence of the Papers, written by the late King of blessed memory, found in his strong box. Mr. Dryden, in the above∣mentioned piece, tal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es occasion to vindicate the authority of the Catholic Church, in decreeing matters of faith, upon this principle, that the church is more visible than the scriptures, because the scriptures are seen by the church, and to a∣buse

the reformation in England, which he affirms was erected on the foundation of lust, sacrilege, and usurpation. Dr. Stillingfleet hereupon an∣swered Mr. Dryden, and treated him with some severity. Another author affirms, that Mr. Dry∣den's tract is very light, in some places ridi∣culous; and observes, that his talent lay towards controversy no more in prose, than, by the Hind and Panther, it appeared to do in verse. This poem of the Hind and Panther is a direct defence of the Romish Church, in a dialogue between a Hind, which represents the Church of Rome, and a Panther, which supports the character of the Church of England. The first part of this poem consists most in general characters and narration, which, says he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I have endeavoured to raise, and give it the majestic turn of heroic poetry. The second being matter of dispute, and chiefly concerning church authority, I was obliged to make as plain and perspicuous as possibly I could, yet not wholly neglecting the numbers, though I had not frequent occasion for the magnificence of verse. The third, which has more of the na∣ture of domestic conversation, is, or ought to be, more free and familiar than the two former. There are in it two episodes or fables, which are inter∣woven with the main design, so that they are properly parts of it, though they are also distinct stories of themselves. In both of these I have made use of the common places of satire, whe∣ther true or false, which are urged by the mem∣bers of the one church against the other.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Dryden speaks of his own conversion in the following terms;<Q><L>But, gracious God, how well dost thou provide,</L>

<P>This poem was attacked by Mr. Charles Monta∣gue, afterwards Earl of Hallifax, and Mr. Matthew Prior, who joined in writing the Hind and Panther, transversed to the Country Mouse, and City Mouse, Lond. 1678, 4to. In the preface to which, the author observes, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that Mr. Dryden's poem natural∣ly falls into ridicule, and that in this burlesque, nothing is represented monstrous and unnatural, that is not equally so in the original.'</Q> They af∣terwards remark, that they have this comfort under the severity of Mr. Dryden's satire, to see his abili∣ties equally lessened with his opinion of them, and that he could not be a fit champion against the Pan∣ther till he had laid aside his judgment.</P>
<P>Mr. Dryden is supposed to have been engaged in translating M. Varillas's History of Heresies, but to have dropped that design. This we learn from a passage in Burnet's reflexions on the ninth book of the first volume of M. Varillas's History, being a reply to his answer.</P>
<P>I shall here give the picture the Dr. has drawn of this noble poet, which is, like a great many of the doctor's other characters, rather exhibited to
<PB N="75" REF="78"/>
please himself than according to the true resem∣blance.</P>
<P>The doctor says, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I have been informed from England, that a gentleman who is famous both for poetry, and several other things, has spent three months in translating Mr. Varillas's history; but as soon as my reflexions appeared, he dis∣continued his labours, finding the credit of his author being gone. Now if he thinks it is re∣covered by his answer, he will, perhaps, go on with his translation; but this may be, for ought I know, as good an entertainment for him, as the conversation he has set on foot between the Hinds and Panthers, and all the rest of the animals; for whom M. Varillas may serve well enough as an author; and this history and that poem are such extraordinary things of their kind, that it will be but suitable to see the author of the worst poem become the translator of the worst history, that the age has produced. If his grace and his wit improve so proportionably, we shall hardly find, that he has gained much by the change he has made, from having no religion, to chuse one of the worst. It is true he had some∣what to sink from in matter of wit, but as for his morals, it is scarce possible for him to grow a worse man than he was. He has lately wreaked his malice on me for spoiling his three months la∣bour; but in it he has done me all the honour a man can receive from him, which is to be railed at by him. If I had ill-nature enough to prompt me to wish a very bad wish for him, it should be that he would go and finish his translation. By that it will appear whether the English nation, which is the most compe∣tent judge of this matter, has upon seeing this debate, pronounced in M. Varillas's favour or me. It is true, Mr. Dryden will suffer a little by it; but at least it will serve to keep him in from
<PB N="76" REF="79"/>
other extravagancies; and if he gains little ho∣nour by this work, yet he cannot lose so much by it, as he has done by his last em∣ployment.'</Q></P>
<P>When the revolution was compleated, Mr. Dry∣den having turned Papist, became disqualified for holding his place, and was accordingly dispossessed of it; and it was conferred on a man to whom he had a confirmed aversion; in con∣sequence whereof he wrote a satire against him, called Mac Flecknoe, which is one of the se∣verest and best written satires in our language.</P>
<P>Mr. Richard Flecknoe, the new laureat, with whose name it is inscribed, was a very indifferent poet of those times; or rather as Mr. Dryden ex∣presses it, and as we have already quoted in Fleck∣noe's life.<Q><L>In prose and verse was own'd without dispute,</L>
<L>Thro' all the realms of nonsense absolute.</L></Q></P>
<P>This poem furnished the hint to Mr. Pope to write his Dunciad; and it must be owned the latter has been more happy in the execution of his design, as having more leisure for the per∣formance; but in Dryden's Mac Flecknoe there are some lines so extremely pungent, that I am not quite certain if Pope has any where exceeded them.</P>
<P>In the year wherein he was deprived of the laurel, he published the life of St. Francis Xavier, translated from the French of father Dominic Bouchours. In 1693 came out a translation of Juvenal and Persius; in which the first, third, sixth, tenth, and sixteenth satires of Juvenal, and Persius entire, were done by Mr. Dryden, who prefixed a long and ingenious discourse, by way of dedication, to the earl of Dorset. In this address our author takes occasion a while to drop his reflexions on
<PB N="77" REF="80"/>
Juvenal; and to lay before his lordship a plan for an epic poem: he observes, that his genius never much inclined him to the stage; and that he wrote for it rather from necessity than inclina∣tion. He complains, that his circumstances are such as not to suffer him to pursue the bent of his own genius, and then lays down a plan up∣on which an epic poem might be written: to which, says he, I am more inclined. Whether the plan proposed is faulty or no, we are not at pre∣sent to consider; one thing is certain, a man of Mr. Dryden's genius would have covered by the rapidity of the action, the art of the design, and the beauty of the poetry, whatever might have been defective in the plan, and produced a work which have been the boast of the nation.</P>
<P>We cannot help regretting on this occasion, that Dryden's fortune was not easy enough to enable him, with convenience and leisure, to pursue a work that might have proved an honour to him∣self, and reflected a portion thereof on all who should have appeared his encouragers on this occa∣sion.</P>
<P>In 1695 Mr. Dryden published a translation in prose of Du Fresnoy's Art of Painting, with a pre∣face containing a parallel between painting and poetry. Mr. Pope has addressed a copy of verses to Mr. Jervas in praise of Dryden's translation. In 1697 his translation of Virgil's works came out. This translation has passed thro' many editions, and of all the attempts which have been made to render Virgil into English, The critics, I think, have allowed that Dryden <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was written before Mr. Dodsley's edition of Virgil in English appeared.</NOTE> best succeeded: notwithstanding as he himself says, when he began it, he was past the grand climacteric! so little influence it seems, age had over him, that he retained his judgment and fire in
<PB N="78" REF="81"/>
full force to the last. Mr. Pope in his preface to Homer says, if Dryden had lived to finish what he began of Homer, he (Mr. Pope) would not have attempted it after him, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'No more, says he, than I would his Virgil, his version of whom (not∣withstanding some human errors) is the most noble and spirited translation I know in any lan∣guage.'</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Trap charges Mr. Dryden with grossly mis∣taking his author's sense in many places; with ad∣ding or retrenching as his turn is best served with either; and with being least a translator where he shines most as a poet; whereas it is a just rule laid down by lord Roscommon, that a trans∣lator in regard to his author should
<Q>" Fall as he falls, and as he rises rise"</Q>
Mr. Dryden, he tells us, frequently acts the ve∣ry reverse of this precept, of which he produces some instances; and remarks in general, that the first six books of the Aeneis, which are the best and most perfect in the original, are the least so in the translation. Dr. Trap's remarks may pos∣sibly be true; but in this he is an instance how easy it is to discover faults in other men's works, and how difficult to avoid them in our own.</P>
<P>Dr. Trap's translation is close, and conveys the author's meaning literally, so consequently may be fitter for a school-boy, but men of riper judgment, and superior taste, will hardly approve it; if Dry∣den's is the most spirited of any translation, Trap's is the dullest that ever was written; which proves that none but a good poet is fit to translate the works of a good poet.</P>
<P>Besides the original pieces and translations hitherto mentioned, Mr. Dryden wrote many others, publish∣ed in six volumes of Miscellanies, and in other col∣lections. They consist of translations from the Greek
<PB N="79" REF="82"/>
and Latin poets, Epistles to several persons, pro∣logues, and epilogues to several plays, elegies, epi∣taphs, and songs. His last work was his Fables, an∣cient and modern, translated into verse from Homer, Ovid, Boccace, and Chaucer. To this work, which is perhaps, one of his most imperfect, is prefixed by way of preface, a critical account of the authors, from whom the fables are translated. Among the original pieces, the Ode to St. Cecilia's day is justly esteemed one of the most elevated in any language. It is impossible for a poet to read this without be∣ing filled with that sort of enthusiasm which is pe∣culiar to the inspired tribe, and which Dryden largely felt when he composed it. The turn of the verse is noble, the transitions surprizing, the lan∣guage and sentiments just, natural, and heighten∣ed. We cannot be too lavish in praise of this Ode: had Dryden never wrote any thing besides, his name had been immortal. Mr. Pope has the following beautiful lines in its praise<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essay on Criticism.</NOTE>.<Q><L>Hear how Timotheus varied lays surprize,</L>
<L>And bid alternate passions fall and rise!</L>
<L>While, at each change, the son of Lybian Jove</L>
<L>Now burns with glory, and then melts with love:</L>
<L>Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow;</L>
<L>Now sighs steal out, and tears begin to flow;</L>
<L>Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found,</L>
<L>And the world's victor stood subdued by sound:</L>

<L>And what Timotheus was, is Dryden now.</L></Q></P>
<P>As to our author's performances in prose, besides his Dedications and Prefaces, and controversial Writings, they consist of the Lives of Plutarch and Lucian, prefixed to the Translation of those Au∣thors, by several Hands; the Life of Polybius, before the Translation of that Historian by Sir

Henry Sheers, and the Preface to the Dialogue concerning Women, by William Walsh, Esquire.</P>
<P>Before we give an account of the dramatic works of Dryden, it will be proper here to insert a story concerning him, from the life of Con∣greve by Charles Wilson esquire, which that gen∣tleman received from the lady whom Mr. Dryden celebrates by the name of Corinna, of whom it appears he was very fond; and who had the rela∣tion from lady Chudleigh. Dryden with all his understanding was weak enough to be fond of Judicial Astrology, and used to calculate the nativity of his children. When his lady was in labour with his son Charles, he being told it was decent to withdraw, laid his watch on the table, begging one of the ladies then present, in a most solemn manner, to take exact notice of the very minute the child was born, which she did, and acquainted him with it. About a week after, when his lady was pretty well recovered, Mr. Dryden took occasion to tell her that he had been calcu∣lating the child's nativity, and observed, with grief, that he was born in an evil hour, for Jupiter, Venus, and the sun, were all under the earth, and the lord of his ascendant afflicted with a hateful square of Mars and Saturn. If he lives to arrive at his 8th year (says he) <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'he will go near to die a violent death on his very birth-day, but if he should escape, as I see but small hopes, he will in the 23d year be under the very same evil di∣rection, and if he should escape that also, the 33d or 34th year is, I fear'</Q>—here he was in∣terrupted by the immoderate grief of his lady, who could no longer hear calamity prophecy'd to befall her son. The time at last came, and August was the inauspicious month in which young Dryden was to enter into the eighth year of his age. The court being in progress, and Mr. Dryden at leisure, he was invited to the country seat of the earl of Berk∣shire,
<PB N="81" REF="84"/>
his brother-in-law, to keep the long vacation with him in Charlton in Wilts; his lady was invited to her uncle Mordaunt's, to pass the remainder of the summer. When they came to divide the chil∣dren, lady Elizabeth would have him take John, and suffer her to take Charles; but Mr. Dryden was too absolute, and they parted in anger; he took Charles with him, and she was obliged to be con∣tent with John. When the fatal day came, the an∣xiety of the lady's spirits occasioned such an effer∣vescence of blood, as threw her into so violent a fever, that her life was despaired of, till a letter came from Mr. Dryden, reproving her for her womanish credulity, and assuring her, that her child was well, which recovered he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spirits, and in six weeks after she received an ecclaircissement of the whole affair. Mr. Dryden, either thro' fear of being reckoned su∣perstitious, or thinking it a science beneath his study, was extremely cautious of letting any one know that he was a dealer in Astrology; therefore could not excuse his absence, on his son's anniversary, from a general hunting match lord Berkshire had made, to which all the adjacent gentlemen were invited. When he went out, he took care to set the boy a double exercise in the Latin tongue, which he taught his children himself, with a strict charge not to stir out of the room till his return; well knowing the task he had set him would take up longer time. Charles was performing his duty, in obedience to his father, but as ill fate would have it, the stag made to∣wards the house; and the noise alarming the servants, they hasted out to see the sport. One of them took young Dryden by the hand, and led him out to see it also, when just as they came to the gate, the stag be∣ing at bay with the dogs, made a bold push and leaped over the court wall, which was very low, and very old; and the dogs following, threw down a part of the wall ten yards in length, under which Charles
<PB N="82" REF="85"/>
Dryden lay buried. He was immediately dug out, and after six weeks languishing in a dangerous way he recovered; so far Dryden's prediction was fulfill∣ed: In the twenty-third year of his age, Charles fell from the top of an old tower belonging to the Vati∣can at Rome, occasioned by a swimming in his head, with which he was seized, the heat of the day being excessive. He again recovered, but was ever after in a languishing sickly state. In the thirty-third year of his age, being returned to England, he was un∣happily drowned at Windsor. He had with another gentleman swam twice over the Thames; but re∣turning a third time, it was supposed he was taken with the cramp, because he called out for help, tho' too late. Thus the father's calculation proved but too prophetical.</P>
<P>Mr. Dryden died the first of May 1701, and was interred in Westminster-Abby. On the 19th of April he had been very bad with the gout, and erisipelas in one leg; but he was then somewhat recovered, and designed to go abroad; on the Friday following he eat a partridge for his supper, and going to take a turn in the little garden behind his house in Gerard-street, he was seized with a violent pain under the ball of the great toe of his right foot; that, unable to stand, he cried out for help, and was carried in by his servants, when upon sending for surgeons, they found a small black spot in the place affected; he submitted to their present applications, and when gone called his son Charles to him, using these words. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I know this black spot is a mortification: I know also, that it will seize my head, and that they will at∣tempt to cut off my leg; but I command you my son. by your filial duty, that you do not suffer me to be dismembered:'</Q> As he foretold, the event proved, and his son was too dutiful to disobey his father's commands.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="86"/>
On the Wednesday morning following, he breath∣ed his last, under the most excruciating pains, in the 69th year of his age; and left behind him the lady Elizabeth, his wife, and three sons. Lady Elizabeth survived him eight years, four of which she was a lunatic; being deprived of her senses by a nervous fever in 1704.</P>
<P>John, another of his sons, died of a fever at Rome; and Charles as has been observed, was drowned in the Thames; there is no account when, or at what place Harry his third son died.</P>
<P>Charles Dryden, who was some time usher to pope Clement II. was a young gentleman of a ve∣ry promising genius; and in the affair of his father's funeral, which I am about to relate, shewed him∣self a man of spirit and resolution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Congreve.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The day after Mr. Dryden's death, the dean of Westminster sent word to Mr. Dryden's widow, that he would make a present of the ground, and all other Abbey-fees for the funeral: The lord Halifax likewise sent to the lady Elizabeth, and to Mr. Charles Dryden, offering to defray the ex∣pences of our poet's funeral, and afterwards to be∣stow 500 l. on a monument in the Abbey: which generous offer was accepted. Accordingly, on sun∣day following, the company being assembled, the corpse was put into a velvet hearse, attended by eighteen mourning coaches. When they were just ready to move, lord Jefferys, son of lord chancellor Jeffreys, a name dedicated to infamy, with some of his rakish companions riding by, asked whose funeral it was; and being told it was Mr. Dryden's, he protested he should not be buried in that private manner, that he would himself, with the lady Eliza∣beth's leave, have the honour of the interment, and would bestow a thousand pounds on a monument in
<PB N="84" REF="87"/>
the Abbey for him. This put a stop to their pro∣cession; and the lord Jefferys, with several of the gentlemen, who had alighted from their coaches, went up stairs to the lady, who was sick in bed. His lordship repeated the purport of what he had said below; but the lady Elizabeth refusing her consent, he fell on his knees, vowing never to rise till his request was granted. The lady under a sud∣den surprise fainted away, and lord Jeffery's pre∣tending to have obtained her consent, ordered the body to be carried to Mr. Russel's an undertaker in Cheapside, and to be left there till further orders. In the mean time the Abbey was lighted up, the ground opened, the choir attending, and the bishop waiting some hours to no purpose for the corpse. The next day Mr. Charles Dryden waited on my lord Halifax, and the bishop; and endeavoured to excuse his mother, by relating the truth. Three days after the undertaker having received no orders, waited on the lord Jefferys; who pretended it was a drunken frolic, that he remembered nothing of the matter, and he might do what he pleased with the body. Upon this, the undertaker waited on the lady Elizabeth, who desired a day's respite, which was granted. Mr. Charles Dryden imme∣diately wrote to the lord Jefferys, who returned for answer, that he knew nothing of the matter, and would be troubled no more about it. Mr. Dryden hereupon applied again to the lord Halifax, and the bishop of Rochester, who absolutely refused to do any thing in the affair.</P>
<P>In this distress, Dr. Garth, who had been Mr. Dryden's intimate friend, sent for the corpse to the college of physicians, and proposed a subscription; which succeeding, about three weeks after Mr. Dryden's decease, Dr. Garth pronounced a fine l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tin oration over the body, which was conveyed from the college, attended by a numerous train of
<PB N="85" REF="88"/>
coaches to Westminster-Abbey, but in very great disorder. At last the corpse arrived at the Abbey, which was all unlighted. No organ played, no anthem sung; only two of the singing boys preced∣ed the corpse, who sung an ode of Horace, with each a small candle in their hand. When the fune∣ral was over, Mr. Charles Dryden sent a challenge to lord Jefferys, who refusing to answer it, he sent several others, and went often himself; but could neither get a letter delivered, nor admittance to speak to him; which so incensed him, that finding his lordship refused to answer him like a gentleman, he resolved to watch an opportunity, and brave him to fight, though with all the rules of honour; which his lordship hearing, quitted the town, and Mr. Charles never had an opportunity to meet him, though he sought it to his death, with the utmost application.</P>
<P>Mr. Dryden had no monument erected to him for several years; to which Mr. Pope alludes in his epitaph intended for Mr. Rowe, in this line.<Q><L>Beneath a rude and nameless stone he lies.</L></Q></P>

The character of Mr. Dryden has been drawn by various hands; some have done it in a favourable, others in an opposite manner. The bishop of Sarum in the history of his own times, says, that the stage was defiled beyond all ex∣ample. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Dryden, the great master of dramatic poetry, being a monster of immodesty and im∣purities of all sorts.'</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Millar's edition of the bishop's work, we have the fol∣lowing note upon this passage. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'This (says the editor) must be understood of his performances for the stage; for as to his personal character, there was nothing remarkably vicious in it: but his plays are, some of them, the fullest of obsceni∣ty of any now extant.'</Q></NOTE>The late lord Lans∣down took upon himself to vindicate Mr. Dryden's character from this severe imputation; which was again answered, and apologies for it, by Mr. Burnet, the bishop's son. But not to dwell on these contro∣versies about his character, let us hear what Mr. Congreve says in the dedication of Dryden's works to the duke of Newcastle: Congreve knew him in∣timately, and as he could have no motive to de∣ceive the world in that particular; and being a man of untainted morals, none can suspect his authority; and by his account we shall see, that Dryden was indeed as amiable in private life, as a Man, as he was illustrious in the eye of the public, as a Poet.</P>
<P>Mr. Dryden (says Congreve) <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'had personal qualities, to challenge love and esteem from all who were truly acquainted with him. He was of a nature exceeding humane and compassionate, easily forgiving injuries, and capable of a prompt and sincere reconciliation with those who had of∣fended him.—His friendship, where he professed it, went much beyond his professions.—As his reading had been very extensive, so was he very happy in a memory, tenacious of every thing he
<PB N="87" REF="90"/>
had read. He was not more possessed of know∣ledge, than he was communicative of it; but then, his communication of it was by no means pedan∣tic, or imposed upon the conversation, but just such, and went so far, as by the natural turns of the discourse in which he was engaged, it was necessarily prompted, or required. He was ex∣tremely ready and gentle in the correction of the errors of any writer, who thought fit to consult him, and full as ready and patient to admit of the reprehension of others in respect of his own over∣sight or mistakes. He was of a very easy, I may say, of very pleasing access; but something slow, and as it were diffident in his advances to others. He had something in his nature that abhorred intrusion in any society whatsoever; and indeed, it is to be regretted. that he was rather blameable on the other extreme. He was of all men I ever knew, the most modest, and the most easy to be discountenanced in his approaches, either to his superiors or his equals.—As to his writings—I may venture to say in general terms, that no man hath written in our language so much, and so various matter; and in so various manners so well. Another thing I may say, was very pecu∣liar to him, which is, that his parts did not de∣cline with his years, but that he was an improv∣ing writer to the last, even to near 70 years of age, improving even in fire and imagination as well as in judgment, witness his Ode on St. Cecilia's Day, and his fables, his latest perform∣ances. He was equally excellent in verse and prose: His prose had all the clearness imaginable, without deviating to the language or diction of poetry, and I have heard him frequently own with pleasure, that if he had any talent for writing prose; it was owing to his frequentl hav∣ing read the writings of the great archbishop Til∣lotson. In his poems, his diction is, wherever his
<PB N="88" REF="91"/>
subject requires it, so sublime and so truly poetical, that it's essence, like that of pure gold cannot be destroyed. Take his verses, and divest them of their rhimes, disjoint them of their numbers, trans∣pose their expressions, make what arrangement or disposition you please in his words; yet shall there eternally be poetry, and something which will be found in capable of being reduced to absolute prose; what he has done in any one species, or distinct kind of writing, would have been sufficient to have acquired him a very great name. If he had writ∣ten nothing but his Prefaces, or nothing but his Songs, or his Prologues, each of them would have entitled him to the preference and distinction of excelling in its kind.'</Q></P>
<P>Besides Mr. Dryden's numerous other performan∣ces, we find him the author of twenty-seven dra∣matic pieces, of which the following is an account.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Wild Gallant, a Comedy, acted at the theatre-royal, and printed in 4to, Lond. 1699.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Indian Emperor; or the Conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards, acted with great ap∣plause, and written in verse.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. An Evening's Love; or the Mock Astrologer, a Comedy, acted at the theatre-royal, and print∣ed in 4to. 1671. It is for the most part taken from Corneille's Feint Astrologue, Moliere's Depit Amo∣reux, and Precieux Ridicules.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Marriage A-la-mode, a Comedy, acted at the theatre-royal, and printed in 4to. 1673, dedicated to the earl of Rochester.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Amboyna, a Tragedy, acted at the theatre∣royal, and printed in 4to 1673. It is dedicated to the lord Clifford of Chudleigh. The plot of this play is chiefly founded in history, giving an ac∣count of the cruelty of the Dutch towards our countrymen at Amboyna, A. D. 1618.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="89" REF="92"/>
6. The Mistaken Husband, a Comedy, acted at the theatre-royal, and printed in 4to. 1675. Mr. Lang∣baine tells us, Mr. Dryden was not the author of this play, tho' it was adopted by him as an orphan, which might well deserve the charity of a scene he bestowed on it. It is in the nature of low comedy, or farce, and written on the model of Plautus's Menaechmi.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Aurenge-zebe; or the Great Mogul, a Tra∣gedy, dedicated to the earl of Mulgrave, acted 1676. The story is related at large in Taverner's voyages to the Indies, vol. i. part 2. This play is written in heroic verse.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. The Tempest; or the inchanted Island, a Co∣medy, acted at the duke of York's theatre, and printed in 4to. 1676. This is only an alteration of Shakespear's Tempest, by Sir William Davenant and Dryden. The new characters in it were chiefly the invention and writing of Sir William, as acknowledged by Mr. Dryden in his preface.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. Feigned Innocence; or Sir Martin Mar-all, a Comedy, acted at the duke of York's theatre, and printed in 4to. 1678. The foundation of this is originally French, the greatest part of the plot and some of the language being taken from Moliere's Eteurdi.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. The Assignation; or Love in a Nunnery, a Co∣medy, acted at the theatre-royal, and printed in 4to. 1678, addressed to Sir Charles Sedley. This play, Mr. Langbain tells us, was damned on the stage, or as the author expresses it in the epistle dedicatory, succeeded ill in the representation; but whether the fault was in the play itself, or in the lameness of the action, or in the numbers of its enemies, who came resolved to damn it for the title, he will not pretend any more than the author to determine.</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. The State of Innocence; or the Fall of Man, an Opera, written in heroic verse, and printed in 4to. 1678. It is dedicated to her royal highness the
<PB N="90" REF="93"/>
duchess of York, on whom the author passes the fol∣lowing extravagant compliment. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'Your person is so admirable, that it can scarce receive any addition when it shall be glorified; and your soul which shines thro' it, finds it of a substance so near her own, that she will be pleased to pass an age within it, and to be con∣fined to such a palace.'</P></Q> <P>To this piece is prefixed an apology for heroic poetry, and poetic licence. The subject is taken from Milton's Paradise Lost, of which it must be acknowledged, it is a poor imitation.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>12. The Conquest of Granada by the Spaniards, in two parts, two Tragi-Comedies, acted at the theatre-royal, and printed 1678. These two plays are dedicated to the duke of York, and were receiv∣ed on the stage with great applause. The story is to be found in Mariana's history of Spain, B. 25. chap. 18. <P>These plays are written in rhime. To the first is prefixed an essay on heroic plays, and to the second an essay on the dramatic poetry of the last age.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>13. All for Love, or the World well Lost, a Tragedy, acted at the theatre-royal, and printed in quarto, 1678. It is dedicated to the earl of Danby. <P>This is the only play of Mr. Dryden's which he says ever pleased himself; and he tells us, that he prefers the scene between Anthony and Ventidius in the first act, to any thing he had written in this kind. It is full of fine sentiments, and the most poetical and beautiful descriptions of any of his plays: the description of Cleopatra in
<PB N="91" REF="94"/>
her barge, exceeds any thing in poetry, except Shakespear's, and his own St. Cecilia.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>14. Tyrannic Love; or the Royal Martyr, a Tragedy, acted at the theatre-royal 1679. It is written in rhime, and dedicated to the duke of Monmouth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>15. Troilus and Cressida; or Truth found too late; a Tragedy, acted at the duke's theatre, and printed in 4to. 1679. It is dedicated to the earl of Sun∣derland, and has a preface prefixed concerning grounds of criticism in tragedy. This play was originally Shakespear's, and revised, and altered by Mr. Dryden, who added several new scenes.—The plot taken from Chaucer's Troilus and Cres∣sida, which that poet translated from the original story written in Latin verse, by Lollius, a Lom∣bard.</ITEM>
<ITEM>17. Secret Love; or the Maiden Queen, a Tra∣gi-Comedy, acted at the theatre-royal, and printed in 4to, 1697. The serious part of the plot is found∣ed on the history of Cleobuline, Queen of Corinth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>18. The Rival Ladies, a Tragi-Comedy, acted at the theatre-royal 1679. It is dedicated to the earl of Orrery. The dedication is in the nature of a preface, in defence of English verse or rhime.</ITEM>
<ITEM>19. The Kind Keeper; or Mr. Limberham, a Comedy, acted at the duke's theatre, printed in 4to. 1680. It is dedicated to John lord Vaughan. Mr. Langbain says, it so much exposed the keep∣ers about town, that all the old letchers were up in arms against it, and damned it the third night.</ITEM>
<ITEM>20. The Spanish Fryar; or the Double Discove∣ry, a Tragi Comedy, acted at the duke's theatre, and printed 1681. It is dedicated to John lord Haughton. This is one of Mr. Dryden's best plays, and still keeps possession of the stage. It is said, that he was afterwards so much concerned for having ridiculed the character of the Fryar, that it impaired his health: what effect bigotry, or the
<PB N="92" REF="95"/>
influence of priests, might have on him, on this oc∣casion, we leave others to determine.</ITEM>
<ITEM>21. Duke of Guise, a Tragedy, acted 1688. It was written by Dryden and Lee, and de∣dicated to Hyde earl of Rochester. This play gave great offence to the Whigs, and engaged several writers for and against it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>22. Albion and Albanius, an Opera, performed at the Queen's theatre in Dorset-Gardens, and print∣ed in folio 1685. The subject of it is wholly alle∣gorical, and intended to expose my lord Shaftsbury and his party.</ITEM>
<ITEM>23. Don Sebastian King of Portugal, a Tragedy, acted 1690, dedicated to the earl of Leicester.</ITEM>
<ITEM>24. King Arthur; or the British worthy, a Tra∣gedy, acted 1691, dedicated to the marquis of Hallifax.</ITEM>
<ITEM>25. Amphytrion; or the two Socias, a Comedy, acted 1691, dedicated to Sir Leveson Gower, taken from Plautus and Moliere.</ITEM>
<ITEM>26. Cleomenes, the Spartan Hero, a Tragedy, acted at the theatre-royal, and printed in 4to. 1692, dedicated to the earl of Rochester. There is pre∣fixed to it the Life of Cleomenes, translated from Plu∣tarch by Mr. Creech. This play was first prohibited by the lord Chamberlain, but upon examination being found innocent of any design to satirize the government, it was suffered to be represented, and had great success. In the preface, the author tells us, that a foolish objection had been raised against him by the sparks, for Cleomenes not accepting the favours of Cassandra. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'They (says he) would not have refused a fair lady; I grant they would not, but let them grant me, that they are no he∣roes.'</Q></ITEM>
<ITEM>27. Love Triumphant; or Nature will prevail, a Tragi-comedy, acted 1694. It is dedicated to the earl of Shaftsbury, and is the last Mr. Dryden wrote, or intended for the theatre. It met with but
<PB N="93" REF="96"/>
indifferent success, tho' in many parts the genius of that great man breaks out, especially in the disco∣very of Alphonso's successful love, and in the ca∣tastrophe, which is extremely effecting.</ITEM>

<HEAD>Sir CHARLES SEDLEY, Bart.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman, who obtained a great name in the world of gallantry, was son of Sir John Sedley, of Aylesford in Kent. When our author was about the age of 17, he became a fellow of Wadham college 1656, but he took no degree. When he quitted the university, he retired into his own country, and neither went to travel nor to the inns of cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. As soon as the re∣storation was effected, Sir Charles came to London,
<PB N="95" REF="98"/>
in order to join in the general jubilee, and then commenced wit, courtier, poet, and gallant.</P>
<P>He was so much applauded in all conversations that he began to be the oracle of the poets; and it was by his judgment every performance was ap∣proved or condemned; which made the King jest with him, and tell him, that nature had given him a patent to be Apollo's viceroy. Lord Ro∣chester bears testimony to this, when he puts him soremost among the judges of poetry.<Q><L>I loath the rabble, tis enough for me,</L>
<L>If Sedley, Shadwell, Shepherd, Wycherly,</L>
<L>Godolphin, Butler, Buckhurst, Buckingham,</L>
<L>And some few more, whom I omit to name,</L>
<L>Approve my sense, I count their censure fame.</L></Q></P>
<P>It happened by Sir Charles, in respect of the king, as is said of the famous cardinal Richlieu, viz. That they who recommended him to the Royal fa∣vour, thereby supplanted themselves, and afterwards envied him; but with this difference between the Cardinal and Sir Charles, that the latter was never ungrateful. When he had a taste of the court, as the King never would part with him, so he never would part from the King; and yet two things proved particularly detrimental to him in it, first his estate, so far from being improved was diminish∣ed; and secondly his morals were debauched. The King delighted in his conversation, and he was the dearer to his Majesty on this account, that he never asked a favour; whereas some other courtiers by their bold importunity exhausted that prince's trea∣sures, who could not deny a man who craved, tho' he hated his forwardness; nor could remember the silent indigence of his friend, tho' he applauded the modesty of it. He was deeply immersed in the public distractions of the times, and is said to have
<PB N="96" REF="99"/>
committed many debaucheries, of which the fol∣lowing instance has been recorded.</P>
<P>In the month of June 1663 our author, Charles lord Buckhurst, and Sir Thomas Ogle, were con∣vened at a public house in Bow-street, Covent-Garden, and being enflamed with strong liquors, they went up to the balcony belonging to that house, and there shewed very indecent postures, and gave great offence to the passengers in the street by very unmannerly discharges upon them; which done, Sedley stripped himself naked, and preached to the people in a gross and scandalous manner; whereupon a riot being raised, the mob became very clamorous, and would have forced the door next to the street; but being opposed, the preacher and his company were driven off the balcony, and the windows of a room into which they retired were broken by the mob. The frolic being soon spread abroad, and as persons of fashion were concerned in it, it was so much the more ag∣gravated. The company were summoned to appear before a court of justice in Westminster-Hall, where being indicted for a riot before Sir Robert Hyde, lord chief justice of the Common Pleas, they were all fined, and Sir Charles being sentenced to pay 500 l. he used some very impertinent expressions to the judge; who thereupon asked him if he had ever read a book called the Compleat Gentleman; to which Sir Charles made answer, that he had read more books than his lordship.</P>
<P>The day for payment being appointed, Sir Charles desired Mr. Henry Killegrew, and another gentle∣man to apply to his Majesty to have the fine remit∣ted, which they undertook to do; but in place of supplicating for it, they represented Sir Charles's
<PB N="97" REF="100"/>
frolic rather in an aggravating light, and not a farthing was abated.</P>
<P>After this affair, Sir Charles's mind took a more serious turn, and he began to apply himself to the study of politics, by which he might be of some service to his country. He was chosen, says Wood, a recruiter of that long parliament, which began at Westminster the 8th of May 1661, to serve for New Romney in Kent, and sat in three succeeding Parli∣ments since the dissolution of that.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, considered as an author, has great delicacy in his turns, and Eachard observes in his dedication of Plautus's three come∣dies to Sir Charles, that the easiness of his stile, the politeness of his expressions in his Bellamira, and even those parts of it which are purely tran∣slation, are very delightful, and engaging to the reader.</P>
<P>Lord Rochester, in his imitation of the 10th satire of the first book of Horace, has the following ver∣ses in his commendation.<Q><L>Sedley has that prevailing gentle art,</L>
<L>That can with a resistless charm impart</L>
<L>The loosest wishes to the chastest heart:</L>
<L>Raise such a conflict, kindle such a fire,</L>
<L>Betwixt declining virtue and desire;</L>
<L>That the poor vanquish'd maid dissolves away</L>
<L>In dreams all night, in sighs and tears all day.</L></Q></P>
<P>Before we give an account of our author's works, it will not be amiss to observe, that he was ex∣tremely active in effecting the revolution, which was thought the more extraordinary, as he had received favours from King James II. That Prince, it seems, had fallen in love with a daughter of Sir Charles's, who was not very handsome; for James was remarkable for dedicating his affections
<PB N="98" REF="101"/>
to women who were not great beauties; in con∣sequence of his intrigue with her, and in order to give her greater lustre in life, he created Miss Sedley countess of Dorchester. This honour, so far from pleasing, greatly shocked Sir Charles. How∣ever libertine himself had been, yet he could not bear the thoughts of his daughter's dishonour; and with regard to this her exaltation, he only consider∣ed it as rendering her more conspicuously infamous. He therefore conceived a hatred to James, and rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ily joined to dispossess him of his throne and do∣minions.</P>
<P>Being asked one day, why he appeared so warm against the King, who had created his daughter a Countess? It is from a principle of gra∣titude I am so warm, returns Sir Charles; for since his Majesty has made my daughter a Countess, it is fit I should do all I can to make his daughter a Queen.</P>
<P>Our author's works are,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Mulberry Garden, a Comedy, acted by his Majesty's servants at the theatre-royal 1668, dedi∣cated to the duchess of Richmond and Lennox.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Anthony and Cleopatra, a Tragedy, acted at the Duke of York's theatre 1667. This play was acted with great applause. The Story from Plu∣tarch's Life of Anthony.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Bellamira; or the Mistress, a Comedy, acted by his Majesty's servants, 1687. It is taken from Terence's Eunuch. While this play was acting, the roof of the play-house fell down, but very few were hurt, except the author: whose merry friend Sir Fleetwood Shepherd told him, that there was so much fire in the play, that it blew up the poet, house and all: Sir Charles answered, No, the play was so
<PB N="99" REF="102"/>
heavy it brought down the house, and buried the poet in his own rubbish.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Beauty the Conqueror; or the Death of Mark Anthony, a Tragedy.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Besides these plays, Mr. Coxeter says, he is au∣thor of the two following, which were never printed till with his works in 2 vols. 8vo. 1719. dedicated by Briscoe the bookseller to the duke of Chandois.<LIST>
<ITEM>The Grumbler, a Comedy of three acts, scene Paris.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Tyrant King of Crete, a Tragedy.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Sedley's poems, however amorously tender and delicate, yet have not much strength; nor do they afford great marks of genius. The softness of his verses is denominated by the Duke of Bucking∣ham, Sedley's Witchcraft. It was an art too successful in those days to propagate the immo∣ralities of the times, but it must be owned that in point of chastity he excels Dorset, and Ro∣chester; who as they conceived lewdly, wrote in plain English, and did not give themselves any trouble to wrap up their ribbaldry in a dress tol∣lerably decent. But if Sedley was the more chaste, I know not if he was the less pernicious writer: for that pill which is gilded will be swallowed more readily, and with less reluctance, than if ten∣dered in its own disgustful colours. Sedley insinu∣ates gently into the heart, without giving any alarm, but is no less fraught with poison, than are those whose deformity bespeaks their mischief.</P>
<P>It would be tedious to enumerate here all the poems of Sir Charles Sedley; let it suffice to say, that they are printed in two small volumes along with his plays, and consist of trans∣lations of Virgil's Pastorals, original Pastorals, Pro∣logues,
<PB N="100" REF="103"/>
Songs, Epilogues, and little occasional pieces.</P>
<P>We shall present the reader with an original pastoral of Sir Charles's, as a specimen of his works.</P>
<P>He lived to the beginning of Queen Anne▪s reign, and died at an age near 90; his wit and humour continuing to the last.</P>

<HEAD>JOHN CROWNE</HEAD>
<P>WAS the son of an independent minister, in that part of North America, which is called Nova Scotia. The vivacity of his genius made him soon grow impatient of the gloomy education he received in that country; which he therefore quitted in order to seek his fortune in England; but it was his fate, upon his first arrival here, to engage in an employment more formal, if possible, than his American education. Mr. Dennis, in his Letters, vol. i. p. 48, has given us the best ac∣count of this poet, and upon his authority the a∣bove, and the succeeding circumstances are related. His necessity, when he first arrived in England, was extremely urgent, and he was obliged to be∣come a gentleman usher to an old independent la∣dy; but he soon grew as weary of that precise of∣fice, as he had done before of the discipline of Nova Scotia. One would imagine that an educa∣tion, such as this, would be but an indifferent pre∣parative for a man to become a polite author, but such is the irresistable force of genius, that neither this, nor his poverty, which was very de∣plorable, could suppress his ambition: aspiring to reputation, and distinction, rather than to fortune and power. His writings soon made him known to the court and town, yet it was neither to the favour of the court, nor to that of the earl of Rochester,
<PB N="105" REF="108"/>
that he was indebted to the nomination the king made of him, for the writing the Masque of Ca∣lypso, but to the malice of that noble lord, who designed by that preference to mortify Mr. Dry∣den.</P>
<P>Upon the breaking out of the two parties, af∣ter the pretended discovery of the Popish plot, the favour he was in at court, and the gaiety of his temper, which inclined him to join with the fa∣shion, engaged him to embrace the Tory party. About that time he wrote the City Politicks, in or∣der to satirize and expose the Whigs: a comedy not without wit and spirit, and which has obtained the approbation of those of contrary principles, which is the highest evidence of merit; but after it was ready for the stage, he met with great embarrass∣ments in getting it acted. Bennet lord Arlington (who was then lord chamberlain, was secretly in the cause of the Whigs, who were at that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e potent in Parliament, in order to support himself against the power of lord treasurer Danby, who was his declared enemy) used all his authority to suppress it. One while it was prohibited on account of its be∣ing dangerous; another while it was laid aside up∣on pretence of its being flat and insipid; till Mr. Crowne, at last, was forced to have recourse to the King himself, and engage him to lay his abso∣lute commands on the lord chamberlain to have it no longer delayed. This command he was pleased to give in his own person, for Charles II. loved comedy above all other amusements, except one which was both more expensive, and less innocent, and besides, had a very high opinion of Mr. Crowne's abilities. While he was thus in favour with the King and court, Mr. Dennis declares, he has more than once heard him say, that though he had a sincere affection for the King, he had yet a mortal hatred to the court. The promise of a
<PB N="106" REF="109"/>
sum of money made him sometimes appear there, to sollicit the payment of it, but as soon as he received the sum, he vanished, and for a long time never approached it.</P>
<P>It was at the latter end of King Charles's reign, that Mr. Crowne, tired wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the fatigue of writing, shocked with the uncertainty of theatrical success, and desirous to shelter him∣self from the resentment of those numerous ene∣mies he had made by his City Politics, im∣mediately addressed the King himself, and desired his Majesty to establish him in some of∣fice, that might be a security to him for life: the King answered, he should be provided for; but added, that he would first see another comedy. Mr. Crowne endeavouring to excuse himself, by telling the King he plotted slowly and awkwardly, his Majesty replied, that he would help him to a plot, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so put in his hand the Spanish Comedy called Non Poder Esser. Mr. Crowne was obliged immediately to go to work upon it, but after he had written three acts of it, found, to his sur∣prize, that the Spanish play had some time before been translated, and acted and damned, under the title of Tarugo's Wiles, or the Coffee-House: yet, supported by the King's command, he went briskly on, and finished it.</P>
<P>Mr. Crowne, who had once before obliged the commonwealth of taste, with a very agreeable comedy in his City Politics, yet, in Sir Courtly Nice went far beyond it, and very much surpassed himself; for though there is something in the part of Crack, which borders upon farce, the Spanish author alone must answer for that: for Mr. Crowne could not omit the part of Crack, that is, of Ta∣rugo, and the Spanish farce depending upon it, without a downright affront to the King, who had given him the play for his ground-work. All
<PB N="107" REF="110"/>
that is of English growth in Sir Courtly Nice is admirable; for though it has neither the fine de∣signing of Ben Johnson, nor the masculine satire of Wycherley, nor the grace, delicacy, and courtly air of Etherege, yet is the dialogue lively and spi∣rited, attractively diversified, and adapted to the several characters. Four of these characters are entirely new, yet general and important, drawn truly, and graphically and artfully opposed to each other, Surly to Sir Courtly, and Hot-head to Testimony: those extremes of behaviour, the one of which is the grievance, and the other the plague of society and conversation; excessive ceremony on the one side, and on the other rudeness, and bru∣tality are finely exposed in Surly and Sir Courtly: those divisions and animosities in the two great par∣ties of England, which have so long disturbed the public quiet, and undermined the general interest, are happily represented and ridiculed in Testimony and Hot-head. Mr. Dennis, speaking of this co∣medy, says, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that though he has more than twenty times read it, yet it still grows upon him, and he delivers it as his opinion, that the greatest co∣mic poet, who ever lived in any age, might have been proud to have been the author of it.'</Q></P>
<P>The play was now just ready to appear to the world. Every one that had seen it rehearsed, was highly pleased with it. All who had heard of it conceived great expectations, and Mr. Crowne was delighted with the flattering hope of being made happy for the remaining part of his life, by the performance of the King's promise: But upon the very last day of the rehearsal, he met Underhill coming from the playhouse, as he himself was going towards it, upon which the poet reprimanding the player for neglecting so con∣siderable a part as he had in the comedy, and on a day of so much consequence, as the very
<PB N="108" REF="111"/>
last of the rehearsal. Oh Lord, says Underhill, we are all undone! how! says Crowne, is the Play∣house on fire? the whole nation, replies the player, will quickly be so, for the King is dead; at the hearing of which dismal words, the au∣thor was thrown almost into distraction; for he who the moment before was ravished with the thought of the pleasure he was about to give the King, and the favours which he was afterwards to receive from him, this moment found, to his unspeakable sorrow, that his Royal patron was gone for ever, and with him all his hopes. The King indeed re∣vived from this apoplectic fit, but three days af∣ter died, and Mr. Crowne by his death was re∣plunged into the deepest melancholly.</P>
<P>Thus far Mr. Dennis has traced the life of Crowne; in the same letter he promises a further account of him upon another occasion, which, it seems, never occurred, for we have not been able to find that he has any where else mentioned our author.</P>
<P>The King's death having put a period to Mr. Crowne's expectations of court-favour (for the reign of his successor was too much hurried with party designs, to admit of any leisure to reward poeti∣cal merit, though the Prince himself, with all his er∣rors about him, was a man of taste, and had a ve∣ry quick discernment of the power of genius) he, no doubt, had recourse to writing plays again for bread, and supporting himself the best way he could by his wits, the most unpleasing, and precarious manner of life, to which any man can be exposed. We cannot be absolutely certain when Mr. Crowne died; Mr. Coxeter in his notes says, he was alive in the year 1703, and as he must then have been much advanced in years, in all probability he did not long survive it.</P>

<HEAD>CHARLES SACKVILLE, Earl of DORSET,</HEAD>
<P>ELDEST son of Richard earl of Dorset, born the 24th of January 1637, was one of the most accomplished gentlemen of the age in which he lived, which was esteemed one of the most courtly ever known in our nation; when, as Pope expresses it,<Q><L>The soldiers ap'd the gallantries of France,</L>

<P>Immediately after the restoration, he was chosen member of parliament for East-Grimstead, and dis∣tinguished himself while he was in the House of Commons.

<PB N="113" REF="116"/>
Prior in his dedication of his poems, ob∣serve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that when the honour and safety of his coun∣try demanded his assistance, he readily entered into the most active parts of life; and underwent the dangers with a constancy of mind, which shewed he had not only read the rules of philosophy, but un∣derstood the practice of them. He went a volunteer under his royal highness the duke of York in the first Dutch war, 1665, when the Dutch admiral Opdam was blown up, and about thirty capital ships taken and destroyed; and his composing a song before the engagement, carried with it in the opinion of many people so sedate a presence of mind, and such un∣usual gallantry, that it has been much celebrated.</P>

<P>To maintain an evenness of temper in the time of danger, is certainly the highest mark of heroism; but some of the graver cast have been apt to say, this sedate composure somewhat differs from that levity of disposition, or frolic humour, that in∣clines a man to write a song. But, let us consider my lord's fervour of youth, his gaiety of mind, supported by strong spirits, flowing from an honest heart, and, I believe, we shall rather be disposed to admire, than censure him on this occasion. Re∣member too, he was only a volunteer. The con∣duct of the battle depended not on him. He had only to shew his intrepidity and diligence, in exe∣cuting the orders of his commander, when called on; as he had no plans of operation to take up his thoughts why not write a song? there was neither indecency, nor immorality in it: I doubt not, but with that chearfulness of mind he com∣posed himself to rest, with as right feelings, and as proper an address to his maker, as any one of a more melancholly disposition, or gloomy aspect.</P>
<P>Most commanders, in the day of battle, assume at least a brilliancy of countenance, that may en∣courage their soldiers; and they are admired for it: to smile at terror has, before this, been allowed the mark of a hero. The dying Socrates discoursed his friends with great composure; he was a philo∣sopher
<PB N="117" REF="120"/>
of a grave cast: Sir Thomas Moore (old enough to be my lord's father) jok'd, even on the scaffold; a strong instance of his heroism, and no contradiction to the rectitude of his mind. The verses the Emperor Adrian wrought on his death∣bed (call them a song if you will) have been ad∣mired, and approved, by several great men: Mr. Pope has not only given his opinion in their fa∣vour, but elegantly translated them, nay, thought them worthy an imitation, perhaps exceeding the original. If this behaviour of my lord's is liable to different constructions, let good nature, and good manners, incline us to bestow the most fa∣vourable thereon.</P>
<P>After his fatigues at sea, during the remainder of the reign of Charles the IId, he continued to live in honourable leisure. He was of the bed-chamber to the king, and possessed not only his master's favour, but in a great degree his familiarity, never leaving the court but when he was sent to that of France, upon some short commission, and embassies of com∣pliment; as if the king designed to rival the French in the article of politeness, who had long claimed a superiority in that accomplishment, by shewing them that one of the most finished gen∣tlemen in Europe was his subject; and that he un∣derstood his worth so well, as not to suffer him to be long out of his presence. Among other commissions he was sent in the year 1669, to compliment the French king on his arrival at Dunkirk, in return of the compliment of that monarch, by the duchess of Orleans, then in England.</P>
<P>Being possessed of the estate of his uncle the earl of Middlesex, who died in the year 1674, he was created earl of that county, and baron of Cranfield, by letters patent, dated the fourth of April, 1675. 27 C. H; and in August 1677 succeeded his father as earl of Dorset; as also, in the post of lord lieu∣tenant of the county of Sussex, having been joined
<PB N="118" REF="121"/>
in the commission with him in 1670<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collins's Peerage, p. 575. vol. I.</NOTE>. Also the 20th of February 1684 he was made custos rotulo∣rum for that county.</P>
<P>Having buried his first lady, Elizabeth, daughter of Harvey Bagot, of Whitehall in the county of Warwick, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> widow of Charles Berkley, earl of Falmouth, without any issue by her, he married, in the year 1684, the lady Mary, daughter of James Compton, earl of Northampton, famed for her beauty, and admirable endowments of mind, who was one of the ladies of the bed-chamber to Queen Mary, and left his lordship again a widower, August 6, 1691, leaving issue by him one son, his grace Lionel now duke of Dorset, and a daughter, the lady Mary, married in the year 1702 to Henry Somerset duke of Beaufort, and dying in child-bed, left no issue.</P>
<P>The earl of Dorset appeared in court at the trail of the seven bishops, accompanied with other noblemen, which had a good effect on the jury, and brought the judges to a better temper than they had usually shewn. He also engaged with those who were in the prince of Orange's interest; and car∣ried on his part of that enterprize in London, under the eye of the court, with the same cou∣rage and resolution as his friend the duke of Devonshire did in open arms, at Nottingham. When prince George of Denmark deserted King James, and joined the prince of Orange, the prin∣cess Anne was in violent apprehensions of the King's displeasure, and being desirous of with∣drawing herself, lord Dorset was thought the pro∣perest guide for her necessary flight<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Hist. of his own times.</NOTE>. She was secretly brought to him by his lady's uncle, the bishop of London: who furnished the princess
<PB N="119" REF="122"/>
with every thing necessary for her flight to the Prince of Orange, and attended her northward, as far as Northampton, where he quickly brought a body of horse to serve for her guard, and went from thence to Nottingham, to confer with the duke of Devonshire.</P>
<P>After the misguided monarch had withdrawn himself, lord Dorset continued at London, and was one of those peers who sat every day in the Council-chamber, and took upon them the go∣vernment of the realm, in this extremity, till some other power should be introduced. In the de∣bates in Parliament immediately after this confusi∣on, his lordship voted for the vacancy of the throne, and that the prince and princess of Orange should be declared King and Queen of England, &amp;c. When their Majesties had accepted the crown of these realms, his lordship was the next day sworn of the privy-council, and declared lord chamberlain of the houshold, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'A place, says Prior, which he eminently adorned by the grace of his person, the fineness of his breeding, and the knowledge and practice of what was decent and magnificent.'</Q> It appears by the history of Eng∣land, that he had the honour to stand godfather, with King William to a son of the prince and prin∣cess of Denmark, born at Hampton-court, the 24th of July 1689, and christened the 27th by the name of William, whom his Majesty declared duke of Gloucester. When the King had been earnestly entreated by the States of Holland, and the con∣federate princes in Germany, to meet at a gene∣ral congress to be held at the Hague, in order to concert matters for the better support of the confederacy, and thereupon took shipping the 16th of January 1692, his lordship was among the peers, who to honour their King and Country, waited on their sovereign in that cold season.
<PB N="120" REF="123"/>
When they were two or three leagues off Goree, his Majesty having by bad weather been four days at sea, was so impatient to go on shore, that taking boat, and a thick fog rising soon after, they were surrounded so closely with ice, as not to be able either to make the shore, or get back to the ship; so that lying twenty-two hours, enduring the most bitter cold, and almost despairing of life, they could hardly stand or speak at their landing; and his lordship was so lame, that for some time he did not recover; yet on his return to England, he neither complained of the accident nor the expence.</P>
<P>On the 2d of February 1691, at a chapter of the most noble order of the garter, held at Ken∣sington, his lordship was elected one of the knights companions of this order, with his highness John-George, the fourth elector of Saxony, and was in∣stalled at Windsor on the February following. He was constituted four times one of the regents of the kingdom in his Majesty's absence. About the year 1698, his health sensibly declining, he left pub∣lic business to those who more delighted in it, and appeared only sometimes at council, to shew his respect to the commission which he bore, for he had already tasted all the comfort which court favour could bestow; he had been high in office, respected by his sovereign and the idol of the peo∣ple; but now when the evening of life approach∣ed, he began to look upon such enjoyments with less veneration, and thought proper to dedicate some of his last hours to quiet and meditation. Being advised to go to Bath for the recovery of his health, he there ended his life on the 29th of January 1705-6, and was buried at Wi∣tham on the 17th of February following.</P>
<P>Lord Dorset was a great patron of men of letters and merit. Dr. Sprat, bishop of Ro∣chester,
<PB N="121" REF="124"/>
celebrated for his polite writings, appealed to him when under a cloud, for the part he ac∣ted in the reign of King James II. and by his lordship's interest preserved himself. To him Mr. Dryden dedicated his translation of Juvenal, in which he is very lavish in his lordship's praise, and expresses his gratitude for the bounty he had experienced from him.</P>
<P>Mr. Prior (among others who owed their rise and fortune to my lord Dorset) makes this pub∣lic acknowledgment, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That he scarce knew what life was, sooner than he found himself obliged to his favour; or had reason to feel any sorrow so sensibly as that of his death.'</Q> Mr. Prior then proceeds to enumerate the valuable qualities of his patron; in which the warmth of his gra∣titude appears in the most elegant panegyric. I cannot imagine that Mr. Prior, with respect to his lordship's morals, has in the least violated truth; for he has shewn the picture in various lights, and has hinted at his patron's errors, as well as his graces and virtues. Among his errors was that of indulging passion, which carried him into transports, of which he was often ashamed; and during these little excesses (says he) <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I have known his servants get into his way, that they might make a merit of it immediately after; for he who had the good fortune to be chid, was sure of being rewarded for it.'</Q></P>

<P>From the specimens lord Dorset has given us of his poetical talents, we are inclined to wish, that affairs of higher consequence had permitted him to have dedicated more of his time to the Muses. Though some critics may alledge, that what he has given the public is rather pretty than great; and that a few pieces of a light nature do not suf∣ficiently entitle him to the character of a first rate poet; yet, when we consider, that notwithstanding they were merely the amusement of his leisure hours, and mostly the productions of his youth, they contain marks of a genius, and as such, he is celebrated by Dryden, Prior, Congreve, Pope, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. GEORGE FARQUHAR</HEAD>
<P>WAS descended of a family of no mean rank in the North of Ireland; we have been in∣formed that his father was dean of Armagh, but we have not met with a proper confirmation of this circumstance; but it is on all hands agreed, that he was the son of a clergyman; and born at London Derry in that kingdom, in the year 1678, as appears from Sir James Ware's account of him. There he received the rudiments of education, and discovered a genius early devoted to the Muses: Before he was ten years of age he gave specimens of his poetry, in which, force of thinking, and elegance of turn and expression are manifest; and if the auther who has wrote Memoirs of his life, may be credited, the following stanza's were written by him at that age,<Q><LG>
<L>The pliant soul of erring youth,</L>

</LG></Q></P>
<P>His parents, it is said, had a numerous family, so could bestow no fortune upon him, further than
<PB N="125" REF="128"/>
a genteel education. When he was qualified for the university, he was, in 1694, sent to Trinity College in Dublin: here, by the progress he made in his studies, he acquired a considerable reputa∣tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of Wilks by Obrian, Svo. 1732.</NOTE>, but it does not appear, that he there took his degree of bachelor of arts; for his disposition being volatile and giddy, he soon grew weary of a dull collegiate life; and his own opinion of it, in that sense, he afterwards freely enough displayed in several parts of his comedies, and other writings: Besides, the expence of it, without any immediate prospect of returns, might be inconsistent with his circumstances. The polite entertainments of the town more forcibly attracted his attention, espe∣cially the diversions of the Theatre, for which he discovered a violent propension. When Mr. Ashbury, who then was manager of Dublin Theatre, had recruited his company with the ce∣lebrated Mr. Wilks (who had for some feasons en∣gaged with Mr. Christopher Rich at Drury-Lane, from whom his encouragement was not equal to his merit) Farquhar having acquaintance with him, Mr. Wilks, was soon introduced upon the stage by his means, where he did not long continue, nor make any considerable figure. His person was suf∣ficiently advantageous, he had a ready memory, proper gesture, and just elocution, but then he was unhappy in his voice, which had not power enough to rouse the galleries, or to rant with any success; besides, he was defective in point of assurance, nor could ever enough overcome his natural timidity. His more excellent talents however might, perhaps, have continued the player at Dublin, and lost the poet at London; but for an accident, which was likely to turn a feigned tragedy into a real one: The story is this.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="129"/>
Mr. Farquhar was extremely beloved in Ireland; having the advantage of a good person, though his voice was weak; he never met with the least re∣pulse from the audience in any of his perform∣ances: He therefore resolved to continue on the stage till something better should offer, but his resolution was soon broke by an accident. Being to play the part of Guyomar in Dryden's Indian Emperor, who kills Vasquez, one of the Spanish generals; and forgetting to exchange his sword for a foil, in the engagement he wounded his bro∣ther tragedian, who acted Vasquez, very danger∣ously; and though it proved not mortal, yet it so shocked the natural tenderness of Mr. Farquhar's temper, that it put a period to his acting ever after.</P>
<P>Soon after this, Mr. Wilks received from Mr. Rich a proposal of four pounds a week, if he would return to London (such was the extent of the salaries of the best players in that time, which, in our days, is not equal to that of a second rate performer) which he thought proper to accept of; and Mr. Farquhar, who now had no inducement to remain at Dublin, accompanied Mr. Wilks to London, in the year 1696. Mr. Wilks, who was well acquainted with the humour and abilities of our author, ceased not his sollici∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion 'till he prevailed upon him to write a play, assuring him, that he was considered by all who knew him in a much brighter light than he had a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet shewn himself, and that he was fitter to exhibit entertaining compositions for the stage, than to eccho those of other poets upon it.</P>
<P>But he received still higher encouragement by the patronage of the earl of Orrery, who was a dis∣corner of merit, and saw, that as yet, Mr. Farquhar's went unrewarded. His lordship conferred a lieu∣tenant's commission upon him in his own regiment
<PB N="127" REF="130"/>
then in Ireland, which he held several years<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of Mr. Farquhar, before his Works.</NOTE>, and, as an officer, he behaved himself without re∣proach, and gave several instances both of courage and conduct: Whether he received his commis∣sion before or after he obliged the town with his first comedy, we cannot be certain.</P>
<P>In the year 1698, his first Comedy called Love and a Bottle appeared on the stage, and for its sprightly dialogue, and busy scenes was well re∣ceived by the audience, though Wilks had no part in it. In 1699 the celebrated Mrs. Anne Oldfied was, partly upon his judgment, and re∣commendation, admitted on the Theatre.</P>
<P>Now we have mentioned Mrs. Oldfield, we shall present the reader with the following anecdote concerning that celebrated actress, which discovers the true manner of her coming on the stage; the account we have from a person who belonged to Mr. Rich, in a letter he wrote to the editor of Mrs. Oldfield's Life, in which it is printed in these words;<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'In your Memoirs of Mrs. Oldfield, it may not be amiss to insert the following facts, on the truth of which you may depend. Her father, captain Oldfield, not only run out all the mili∣tary, but the paternal bounds of his fortune, hav∣ing a pretty estate in houses in Pall-mall. It was wholly owing to captain Farquhar, that Mrs. Oldfield became an actress, from the following incident; dining one day at her aunt's, who kept the Mitre Tavern in St. James's Market, he heard miss Nanny reading a play behind the bar,
<PB N="128" REF="131"/>
with so proper an emphasis, and so agreeable turns suitable to each character, that he swore the girl was cut out for the stage, for which she had before always expressed an inclination, be∣ing very desirous to try her fortune that way. Her mother, the next time she saw captain Van∣burgh, who had a great respect for the family, told him what was captain Farquhar's opinion; upon which he desired to know whether in the plays she read, her fancy was most pleased with tragedy or comedy; miss being called in, said comedy, she having at that time gone through all Beaumont and Fletcher's comedies, and the play she was reading when captain Farquhar dined there, was the Scornful Lady. Captain Van∣burgh, shortly after, recommended her to Mr. Christopher Rich, who took her into the house at the allowance of fifteen shillings a week. How∣ever, her agreeable figure, and sweetness of voice, soon gave her the preference, in the opinion of the whole town, to all our young actresses, and his grace the late duke of Bedford, being pleased to speak to Mr. Rich in her favour, he instantly raised her allowance to twenty shillings a week; her fame and salary at last rose to her just merit.'</Q></P>

<P><PB N="129" REF="132"/>
In the beginning of the year 1700, Farquhar brought his Constant Couple, or Trip to the Ju∣bilee, upon the stage, it being then the jubilee year at Rome; but our author drew so gay, and airy a figure in Sir Harry Wildair, so suited to Mr. Wilk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s talents, and so animated by his gesture, and vivacity of spirit, that it is not determined whether the poet or the player received most repu∣tation by it. Towards the latter end of this year we meet with Mr. Farquhar in Holland, probably upon his military duty, from whence he has given a description in two of his letters dated that year from Brill, and from Leyden, no less true than hu∣morpus, as well of those places as the people; and in a third, dated from the Hague he very face∣tiously relates how merry he was there, at a treat made by the earl of Westmoreland, while, not only himself, but king William, and other of his subjects were detained there by a violent storm, which he has no less humorously described, and has, among his poems, written also an ingenious copy of verses to his mistress on the same subject. Whether this mistress was the same person he calls his charming Penelope, in several of his love-letters addressed to her, we know not, but we have been informed by an old officer in the army, who well knew Mr. Farquhar, that by that name we are to under∣stand Mrs. Oldfield, and that the person meant by Mrs. V— in one of them, said to be her bedfellow, was Mrs. Verbruggen the actress, the same who was some years before Mrs. Mountfort, whom Mrs. Oldfield succeeded, (when Mrs. V— died some years after in child-bed) with singular com∣mendation, in her principal parts; and from so bright a flame it was no wonder that Farquhar was more than ordinarily heated. The author of Mrs. Oldfield's life says, that she has often heard her men∣tion some agreeable hours she spent with captain
<PB N="130" REF="133"/>
Farquhar: As she was a lady of true delicacy, nor meanly prostituted herself to every adorer, it would be highly ungenerous to suppose, that their hours ever passed in criminal freedoms. And 'tis well known, whatever were her failings, she wronged no man's wise; nor had an husband to injure.</P>
<P>Mr. Farquhar, encouraged by the success of his last piece, made a continuation of it in 1701, and brought on his Sir Harry Wildair; in which Mrs. Oldfield received as much reputation, and was as greatly admired in her part, as Wilks was in his.</P>
<P>In the next year he published his Miscellanies, or Collection of Poems, Letters, and Essays, already mentioned, and which contain a variety of humorous, and pleasant sallies of fancy: There is amongst them a copy of verses addressed to his dear Penelope, upon her wearing her Masque the evening before, which was a female fashion in those days, as well at public walks, as among the spectators at the Play∣house. These verses naturally display his temper and talents, and will afford a very clear idea of them; and therefore we shall here insert them. <Q><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The arguments you made use of last night for keeping on your masque, I endeavoured to de∣feat with reason, but that proving ineffectual, I'll try the force of rhyme, and send you the heads of our chat, in a poetical dialogue between You and I.'</Q><SP>

<P>It is said, some of the letters of which we have been speaking, were published from the copies re∣turned him at his request, by Mrs. Oldfield, and
<PB N="132" REF="135"/>
that she delighted to read them many years after they were printed, as she also did the judicious essay at the end of them, which is called a Dis∣course upon Comedy, in Reference to the English Stage; but what gives a yet more natural and lively representation of our author still, is one among those letters, which he calls the Picture, containing a description and character of himself, which we should not now omit transcribing, if his works were not in every body's hands.</P>
<P>In 1703 came out another Comedy, entitled the Inconstant, or the Way to Win Him, which had sufficient merit to have procured equal success to the rest; but for the inundation of Italian, French, and other farcial interruptions, which, through the interest of some, and the depraved taste of others, broke in upon the stage like a torrent, and swept down before them all taste for compositions of a more intrinsic excellence. These foreign monsters obtained partizans amongst our own countrymen, in opposition to English humour, genuine wit, and the sublime efforts of genius, and substituted in their room the airy entertainments of dancing and sing∣ing, which conveyed no instruction, awakened no generous passion, nor filled the breast with any thing great or manly. Such was the prevalence of these airy nothings, that our author's comedy was neglected for them, and the tragedy of Phaedra and Hippolitus, which for poetry is equal to any in our tongue, (and though Mr. Addison wrote the prologue, and Prior the epilogue) was suffered to languish, while multitudes flocked to hear the warblings of foreign eunuchs, whose highest excel∣lence, as Young expresses it, was,<Q><L>' Nonsense well tun'd with sweet stupidity.'</L></Q></P>
<P>Very early in the year 1704, a farce called the Stage Coach, in the composition whereof he was
<PB N="133" REF="136"/>
jointly concerned with another, made its first appear∣ance in print, and it has always given satisfaction.</P>
<P>Mr. Farquhar had now been about a twelve∣month married, and it was at first reported, to a great fortune; which indeed he expected, but was miserably disappointed. The lady had fallen in love with him, and so violent was her passion, that she resolved to have him at any rate; and as she knew Farquhar was too much dissipated in life to fall in love, or to think of matrimony unless advantage was annexed to it, she fell upon the stra∣tagem of giving herself out for a great fortune, and then took an opportunity of letting our poet know that she was in love with him. Vanity and interest both uniting to persuade Farquhar to mar∣ry, he did not long delay it, and, to his immor∣tal honour let it be spoken, though he found him∣self deceived, his circumstances embarrassed, and his family growing upon him, he never once up∣braided her for the cheat, but behaved to her with all the delicacy, and tenderness of an indulgent husband.</P>
<P>His next comedy named the Twin-Rivals, was played in 1705.</P>
<P>Our poet was possessed of his commission in the army when the Spanish expedition was made under the conduct of the earl of Peterborough, tho' it seems he did not keep it long after, and tho' he was not em∣barked in that service, or present at the defeat of the French forces, and the conquest of Barcelona; yet from some military friends in that engagement, he received such distinct relations of it in their epistolary correspondence, that he wrote a poem upon the subject, in which he has made the earl his hero. Two or three years after it was writ∣ten, the impression of it was dedicated by the au∣thor's widow to the same nobleman, in which
<PB N="134" REF="137"/>
are some fulsome strains of panegyric, which per∣haps her necessity excited her to use, from a view of enhancing her interest by flattery, which if ex∣cusable at all, is certainly so in a woman left desti∣tute with a family, as she was.</P>
<P>In 1706 a comedy called the Recruiting Officer was acted at the theatre-royal. He dedicates to all friends round the Wrekin, a noted hill near Shrewsbury, where he had been to recruit for his company; and where, from his observations on country-life, the manner that serjeants inveigle clowns to enlist, and the behaviour of the officers towards the milk-maids and country - wenches, whom they seldom fail of debauching, he collected matter sufficient to build a comedy upon, and in which he was successful: Even now that comedy fails not to bring full houses, especially when the parts of Captain Plume, Captain Brazen, Sylvia, and Serjeant Kite are properly disposed of.</P>
<P>His last play was the Beaux - Stratagem, of which he did not live to enjoy the full success.</P>
<P>Of this pleasing author's untimely end, we can give but a melancholy account.</P>
<P>He was oppressed with some debts which o∣bliged him to make application to a certain no∣ble courtier, who had given him formerly many professions of friendship. He could not bear the thought that his wife and family should want, and in this perplexity was ready to embrace any expedient for their relief. His pretended patron persuaded him to convert his commission into the money he wanted, and pledged his honour, that in a very short time he would provide him ano∣ther. This circumstance appeared favourable, and
<PB N="135" REF="138"/>
the easy bard accordingly sold his commission; but when he renewed his application to the noble∣man, and represented his needy situation, the latter had forgot his promise, or rather, perhaps, had never resolved to fulfil it.</P>
<P>This distracting disappointment so preyed upon the mind of Mr. Farquhar, who saw nothing but beggary and want before him, that by a sure, tho' not sudden declension of nature, it carried him off this worldly theatre, while his last play was acting in the height of success at that of Drury∣lane; and tho' the audience bestowed the loudest applauses upon the performance, yet they could scarce forbear mingling tears with their mirth for the approaching loss of its author, which hap∣pened in the latter end of April 1707, before he was thirty years of age.</P>
<P>Thus having attended our entertaining dramatist o'er the contracted stage of his short life, thro' the various characters he performed in it, of the player, the lover, and the husband, the soldier, the critic, and the poet, to his final catastrophe, it is here time to close the scene. However, we shall take the liberty to subjoin a short character of his works, and some farther observations on his genius.</P>
<P>It would be injurious to the memory of Wilks not to take notice here, of his generous behaviour to∣wards the two daughters of his deceased friend. He proposed to his brother managers, (who readily came into it) to give each of them a benefit, to ap∣prentice them to mantua-makers; which is an in∣stance amongst many others that might be produced, of the great worth of that excellent comedian.</P>
<P>The general character which has been given of Mr. Farquhar's comedies is, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the success of the most of them far exceeded the author's ex∣pectations; that he was particularly happy in the choice of his subjects, which he took care to
<PB N="136" REF="139"/>
adorn with a variety of characters and incident: his style is pure and unaffected, his wit natural and flowing, and his plots generally well contrived. He lashed the vices of the age, tho' with a merciful hand; for his muse was good-natured, not abound∣ing over-much with gall, tho' he has been blamed for it by the critics: It has been objected to him, that he was too hasty in his productions; but by such only who are admirers of stiff and elabo∣rate performances, since with a person of a spright∣ly fancy, those things are often best, that are struck off in a heat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs, ubi. supra.</NOTE>. It is thought that in all his heroes, he generally sketched out his own character, of a young, gay, rakish spark, blessed with parts and abilities. His works are loose, tho' not so grossly libertine, as some other wits of his time, and leave not so pernicious impres∣sions on the imagination as other figures of the like kind more strongly stampt by indelicate and heavier hands.'</Q></P>
<P>He seems to have been a man of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gerius rather sprightly than great, rather flow'ry than solid; his comedies are diverting, because his characters are natural, and such as we frequently meet with; but he has used no art in drawing them, nor does there appear any force of thinking in his performances, or any deep penetration into nature; but rather a superficial view, pleasant e∣nough to the eye, though capable of leaving no great impression on the mind. He drew his observations chiefly from those he conversed with, and has seldom given any additional heightening, or indelible marks to his characters; which was the peculiar excellence of Shakespear, Johnson and Congreve.</P>
<P>Had he lived to have gained a more general knowledge of life, or had his circumstances not

<P>He had certainly a lively imagination, but then it was capable of no great compass; he had wit, but it was of so peculiar a sort, as not to gain ground upon consideration; and it is certainly true, that his comedies in general owe their success full as much to the player, as to any thing intrinsi∣cally excellent in themselves.</P>
<P>If he was not a man of the highest genius, he seems to have had excellent moral qualities, of which his behaviour to his wife and tenderness to his children are proofs, and deserved a better fate than to die oppressed with want, and under the calamitous apprehensions of leaving his fami∣ly destitute: While Farquhar will ever be re∣membered with pleasure by people of taste, the name of the courtier who thus inhumanly ruined him, will be for ever dedicated to infamy.</P>

<HEAD>EDWARD RAVENSCROFT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman is author of eleven plays, which gives him a kind of right to be named in this collection. Some have been of o∣pinion, he was a poet of a low rate, others that he was only a wit collector; be this as it may, he acquired some distinction by the vigorous oppo∣sition he made to Dryden: And having chosen so powerful an antagonist, he has acquired more ho∣nour by it, than by all his other works put together; he accuses Dryden of plagiary, and treats him severely.</P>
<P>Mr. Dryden, indeed, had first attacked his Mama∣mouchi; which provoked Ravenscroft to retort so harshly upon him; but in the opinion of Mr. Langbain, the charge of plagiarism as properly belonged to Ravenscroft himself as to Dryden; tho' there was this essential difference between the plagiary of one and that of the other; that Dryden turned whatever he borrowed into gold, and Ravenscroft made use of other people's mate∣rials, without placing them in a new light, or giving them any graces, they had not before.</P>
<P>Ravenscroft thus proceeds against Mr. Dryden: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That I may maintain the character of impartial, to which I pretend, I must pull off his disguise, and discover the politic plagiary that lurks under

it. I know he has endeavoured to shew himself master of the art of swift writing, and would per∣suade the world that what he writes is extempore wit, currente calamo. But I doubt not to shew that tho' he would be thought to imitate the silk worm that spins its webb from its own bowels. yet I shall make him appear like the leech that lives upon the blood of men, drawn from the gums, and when he is rubbed with sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, spues it up again. To prove this, I shall only give an account of his plays, and by that little of my own knowledge, that I shall discover, it will be manifest, that this rickety poet, (tho' of so ma∣ny years) cannot go without others assistance; for take this prophecy from your humble ser∣vant, or Mr. Ravenscroft's Mamamouchi, which you please,'<Q><L>' When once our poet's translating vein is past,</L>
<L>' From him, you can't expect new plays in haste.</L></Q></Q></P>
<P>Thus far Mr. Ravenscroft has censured Dryden; and Langbain, in order to prove him guilty of the same poetical depredation, has been industrious to trace the plots of his plays, and the similarity of his characters with those of other dramatic poets; but as we should reck on it tedious to follow him in this manner, we shall only in general take notice of those novels from which he has drawn his plots.</P>
<P>We cannot ascertain the year in which this man died; he had been bred a templer, which he forsook as a dry unentertaining study, and much beneath the genius of a poet.</P>

<ITEM>7. The London Cuckolds, a Comedy; acted at the duke of York's theatre. This play is collected from the novels of various authors, and is esteemed one of the most diverting, though perhaps the most offensive play of the author's; it was first acted 1682. This play has hitherto kept possession of the stage, a circumstance owing to the annual celebration of the lord mayor's inauguration: Though it seems to be growing into a just disesteem. It was deprived of its annual appearance at Drury-Lane Theatre, in the year 1752, by Mr. Garrick; whose good sense would not suffer him to continue so unwartantable and ridiculous an insult, upon so respectable a body of men as the magistrates of the city of London.
<P>The citizens are exposed to the highest ridicule in it; and the scenes are loose and indecent. The reason why the comic poets have so often declared themselves open enemies of the citizens, was plainly this: The city magistrates had always opposed the court, on which the poets had their dependance, and therefore took this method of revenge.</P></ITEM>

<HEAD>JOHN PHILIPS,</HEAD>
<P>A POET of very considerable eminence, was son of Dr. Stephen Philips, arch-deacon of Salop, and born at Brampton in Oxfordshire, Decem∣ber 30, 1676. After he had received a grammatical education at home, he was sent to Winchester school, where he made himself master of the Latin and Greek languages, and was soon distinguished for an happy imitation of the excellences which he discovered in the best classical authors. With this foundation he was removed to Christ's Church in Oxford, where he performed all his university exercises with applause, and besides other valuable authors in the poetical way, he became particularly ac∣quainted with, and studied the works of Milton. The ingenious Mr. George Sewel, in his life and character of our author, observes, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that there was not an allusion in Paradise Lost, drawn from the thoughts and expressions of Homer or Virgil, which Mr. Philips could not immediately refer to, and by that he perceived what a peculiar life and grace their sentiments added to English poetry; how much their images raised its spirit, and what weight and beauty their words, when translated, gave to its language: nor was he less curious in observing the force and elegance of his mother tongue; but by the example of his darling Milton, searched backwards into the
<PB N="144" REF="147"/>
works of our old English poets, to furnish him with proper sounding, and significant expressions, and prove the due extent, and compass of the language. For this purpose he carefully read over Chancer and Spenser, and afterwards, in his writings, did not scruple to revive any words or phrases which he thought deserved it, with that modesty, and liberty which Horace allows of, either in the coining of new, or the restor∣ing of ancient expressions.'</Q> Our author, how∣ever, was not so much enamoured of poetry, as to neglect other parts of literature, but was very well acquainted with the whole compass of natu∣ral philosophy. He seems in his studies, as well as his writings, to have made Virgil his pattern, and often to have broken out with him in the fol∣lowing rapturous wish, in the Second Book of the Georgics, which, for the sake of the English read∣er, we shall give in Mr. Dryden's translation.<Q><L>' Give me the ways of wand'ring stars to know,</L>
<L>' The depths of heav'n above, or earth below;</L>
<L>' Teach me the various labours of the moon,</L>
<L>' And whence proceed th' eclipses of the sun.</L>
<L>' Why flowing tides prevail upon the main,</L>
<L>' And in what dark recess, they shrink again.</L>
<L>' What shakes the solid earth, what cause delays</L>
<L>' The summer-nights, and the short winter days.'</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Philips was a passionate admirer of nature, and it is not improbable but he drew his own character in that description which he gives of a philosophical and retired life, at the latter end of the first Book of his Cyder.<Q><L>—He to his labour hies,</L>
<L>Gladsome, intent on somewhat that may ease</L>
<L>Unhealthy mortals and with curious search</L>

<L>Fossils, and minerals, that th' embowell'd earth</L>
<L>Displays, if by his industry he can</L>
<L>Benefit human race.</L></Q></P>
<P>Though the reader will easily discover the un∣poetical flatness of the above lines, yet they shew a great thirst after natural knowledge, and we have reason to believe, that much might have been attained, and many new discoveries made, by so diligent an enquirer, and so faithful a recorder of physical operations. However, though death pre∣vented the hopes of the world in that respect, yet the passages of that kind, which we find in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his Poem on Cyder, may convince us of the niceness of his observations in natural causes. Besides this, he was particularly skilled in antiquities, especial∣ly those of his own country; and part of this study too, he has with much art and beauty intermixed with his poetry.</P>
<P>While Mr. Philips continued at the university, he was honoured with the acquaintance of the best and politest men in it, and had a particular intima∣cy with Mr. Edmund Smith, author of Phaedra and Hippolitus. The first poem which got him reputa∣tion, was his Splendid Shilling, which the author of the Tatler has stiled the best burlesque poem in the English Language; nor was it only, says Mr. Sewel, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the finest of that kind in our tongue, but handled in a manner quite different from what had been made use of by any author of our own, or other nation, the sentiments, and stile being in this both new; whereas in those, the jest lies more in allusions to the thoughts and sables of the ancients, than in the pomp of expression. The same humour is continued thro' the whole, and not unnaturally diversified, as most poems of that nature had been before.
<PB N="146" REF="149"/>
Out of that variety of circumstances, which his fruitful invention must suggest to him, on such a subject, he has not chosen any but what are diverting to every reader, and some, that none but his inimitable dress could have made di∣verting to any: when we read it, we are betrayed into a pleasure which we could not expect, tho' at the same time the sublimity of the stile, and the gravity of the phrase, seem to chastise that laughter which they provoke.'</Q> Mr. Edmund Smith in his beautiful verses on our Author's Death, speaks thus concerning this poem;<Q><L>' In her best light the comic muse appears,</L>
<L>' When she with borrow'd pride the buskin wears.'</L></Q></P>
<P>This account given by Mr. Sewel of the Splen∣did Shilling, is perhaps heightened by personal friendship, and that admiration which we natu∣rally pay to the productions of one we love. The stile seems to be unnatural for a poem which is intended to raise laughter; for that laboured gravity has rather a contrary influence; disposing the mind to be serious: and the disap∣pointment is not small, when a man finds he has been betrayed into solemn thinking, in reading the description of a trifle; if the gravity of the phrase chastises the laughter, the purpose of the poem is defeated, and it is a rule in writing to suit the language to the subject. Philips's Splendid Shil∣ling may have pleased, because, its manner was new, and we often find people of the best sense throw away their admiration on monsters, which are seldom to be seen, and neglect more regular beauty, and juster proportion.</P>
<P>It is with reserve we offer this criticism against the authority of Dr. Sewel, and the Tatler;
<PB N="147" REF="150"/>
but we have resolved to be impartial, and the reader who is convinced of the propriety and beauty of the Splendid Shilling, has, no doubt, as good a right to reject our criticism, as we had to make it.</P>
<P>Our author's coming to London, we are in∣formed, was owing to the persuasion of some great persons, who engaged him to write on the Battle of Blenheim; his poem upon which introduced him to the earl of Oxford, and Henry St. John, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> afterwards lord viscount Bolingbroke, and other noble patrons. His swelling stile, it must be owned, was better suited to a subject of this gravity and importance, than to that of a light and ludi∣crous nature: the exordium of this piece is poeti∣cal, and has an allusion to that of Spenser's Fairy Queen:<Q><L>From low and abject themes the grov'ling muse</L>
<L>Now mounts aerial to sing of arms</L>
<L>Triumphant, and emblaze the martial acts</L>
<L>Of Britain's hero.</L></Q></P>
<P>The next poem of our author was his Cyder, the plan of which he laid at Oxford, and afterwards compleated it in London. He was de∣termined to make choice of this subject, from the violent passion he had for the productions of nature, and to do honour to his native country. The poem was founded upon the model of Virgil's Georgics, and approaches pretty near it, which, in the opinion of critics in general, and Mr. Dry∣den in particular, even excels the Divine Aeneid: He imitates Virgil rather like a pursuer, than a follower, not servilely tracing, but emulating his beauties; his conduct and management are superior to all other copiers of that original, and even the admired Rapin (says Dr. Sewel) is much be∣low

him, both in design and success, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'for the Frenchman either fills his garden with the idle fables of antiquity, or new transformations of his own; and, in contradiction of the rules of criticism, has injudiciously blended the serious, and sublime stile of Virgil, with the elegant turns of Ovid in his Metamorphosis; nor has the great genius of Cowley succeeded better in his Books of Plants, who, besides the same faults with the former, is continually varying his num∣bers from one sort of verse to another, and al∣luding to remote hints of medicinal writers, which, though allowed to be useful, are yet so numerous, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>atten the dignity of verse, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ink it from a poem, to a trea ise of physic.'</Q> Dr. Sewel has informed us, that Mr. Philips in∣tended to have written a poem on the Resurrecti∣on, and the Day of Judgment, and we may reason∣ably presume, that in such a work, he would have exceeded his other performances. This awful sub∣j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t is proper to be treated in a solemn stile, and cignified with the noblest images; and we need not doubt from his just notions of religion, and the gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine spirit of poetry, which were conspicuous in him, he would have carried his readers through these tremendous scenes, with an exalted reverence, which, however, might not participate of enthusi∣asm. The meanest soul, and the lowest imagination cannot contemplate these alarming events described in Holy Writ, without the deepest impressions: what then might we not expect from the heart of a good man, and the regulated flights and raptures of a christian poet? Our author's friend Mr. Smith, who had probably seen the first rudiments of his design, speaks thus of it, in a poem upon his death.<Q><PB N="149" REF="152"/><L>O! had relenting Heaven prolong'd his days,</L>
<L>The tow'ring bard had sung in nobler lays:</L>
<L>How the last trumpet wakes the lazy dead;</L>
<L>How saints aloft the cross triumphant spread;</L>
<L>How opening Heav'ns their happier regions shew,</L>
<L>And yawning gulphs with slaming vengeance glow,</L>
<L>And saints rejoice above, and sinners howl be∣low.</L>
<L>Well might he sing the day he could not fear,</L>
<L>And paint the glories he was sure to wear.</L></Q></P>
<P>All that we have left more of this poet, is a Latin Ode to Henry St. John, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> which is esteem∣ed a master-piece; the stile being pure and ele∣gant, the subject of a mixt nature, resembling the sublime spirit. and gay facetious humour of Ho∣race. He was beloved, says Dr. Sewel, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'by all who knew him; somewhat reserved and silent a∣mongst strangers, but free, familiar, and casy with his friends; he was averse to disputes, and thought no time so ill spent, and no wit so ill used, as that which was employed in such de∣bates; his whole life was distinguished by a na∣tural goodness, and well-grounded and unassected piety, an universal charity, and a steady adhe∣rence to his principles; no one observed the natural and civil duties of life with a stricter regard, whether a son, a friend, or a member of society, and he had the happiness to fill every one of these parts, without even the suspicion ei∣ther of undutifulness, insincerity, or disrespect. Thus he continued to the last, not owing his virtues to the happiness of his constitution, but the frame of his mind, insomuch, that during a long sickness, which is apt to ruffle the smooth∣est

temper; he never betrayed any discontent or uneasiness, the integrity of his life still pre∣serving the chearfulness of his spirits; and if his friends had measured their hopes of his life, only by his unconcern in his sickness, they could not but conclude, that either his date would be much longer, or that he was at all times pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pared for death.'</Q> He had long been troubled with a lingering consumption, attended with an asthma; and the summer besore he died, by the advice of his physicians, he removed to Batly, where he got only some present ease, but went from thence with but small hopes of recovery; and upon the return of the distemper, he died at Here∣ford the 15th of February, 1708. He was in∣terred in the Cathedral church of that city, with an inscription upon his grave-stone, and had a monument erected to his memory in Westminster-abbey by Sir Simon Harcourt, afterwards lord chancellor; the epitaph of which was written by Dr. Friend.</P>

<HEAD>WILLIAM WALSH, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS poet was the son of Joseph Walsh, of Aberley in Worcestershire. He became a gentleman-commoner of Wadham-College Ox∣ford, in Easter-Term, 1678, when he was only fifteen years of age; he lest it without a degree, re∣tired to his native county, and some time after went to London. He wrote a Dialogue concerning Wo∣men, being a Defence of the Fair-Sex, addressed to Eugenia, and printed in the year 1691. This is the most considerable of our author's productions, and it will be somewhat necessary to take further notice of it, which we cannot more effectually do, than by transcribing the words of Dryden in its commendation.—That great critic thus characterises it. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The perusal of this dialogue, in defence of the Fair-Sex, written by a gentleman of my ac∣quaintance, much surprised me: For it was not easy for me to imagine, that one so young could have treated so nice a subject with so much judg∣ment. It is true, I was not ignorant that he was naturally ingenious, and that he had improved himself by travelling; and from thence I might reasonably have expected, that air of gallantry which is so visibly diffused through the body of the work, and is, indeed, the soul that animates all things of this nature; but so much variety of reading, both in antient and modern authors, such digestion of that reading, so much justness of thought, that it leaves no room for affectation or pedantry; I may venture to say, are not over com∣mon amongst practised writers, and very rarely to
<PB N="152" REF="155"/>
be found amongst beginners. It puts me in mind of what was said of Mr. Waller, the father of our English numbers, upon the sight of his first verses, by the wits of the last age; that he came out into the world forty-thousand strong, before they had heard of him. Here in imitation of my friend's apostrophes, I hope the reader need not be told, that Mr. Waller is only mentioned for honour's sake, that I am desirous of laying hold on his memory on all occasions, and thereby ac∣knowledging to the world, that unless he had written, none of us all could write. My friend, had not it seems confidence enough to fend this piece out into the world, without my opinion of it. that it might pass securely, at least among the fair readers. for whose service it was principally designed. I am not so presuming, as to think my opinion can either be his touch-stone, or his pass∣port; but, I thought I might send him back to Ariosto, who has made it the business of almost thirty stanza's, in the beginning of the thirty-seventh book of his Orlando Furioso; not only to praise that beautiful part of the creation, but also to make a sharp satire on their enemies; to give mankind their own, and to tell them plainly, that from their envy it proceeds, that the virtue and great actions of women are purposely conceal∣ed. and the failings of some few amongst them exposed, with all the aggravating circumstances of malice. For my own part, who have always been their servant, and have never drawn my pen against them, I had rather see some of them praised extraordinarily, than any of them suffer by detraction, and that at this age, and at this time particularly, wherein I find more he∣roines, than heroes; let me therefore give them joy of their new champion: If any will think me more partial to him, than I really am, they can only say, I have returned his bribe; and
<PB N="153" REF="156"/>
the worst I wish him is, that he may receive ju∣stice from the men, and favour only from the ladies.'</Q></P>
<P>This is the opinion of Mr. Dryden in favour of this piece, which is sufficient to establish its repu∣tation. Mr. Wood, the antiquarian, observes, that this Eugenia was the mistress of Walsh, but for this he produces no proof, neither is it in the least material whether the circumstance is true or no. Mr. Walsh is likewise author of several occasional poems, printed 1749, amongst the works of the Minor Poets, and which he first published in the year 1692, with some letters amorous and gal∣lant, to which is prefixed the following address to the public.<Q><L>Go, little book, and to the world impart</L>
<L>The faithful image of an amorous heart;</L>
<L>Those who love's dear deluding pains have known,</L>
<L>May in my fatal sorrows read their own:</L>
<L>Those who have lived from all its torments free,</L>

<L>And warn'd by my example shun my fate.</L>
<L>Whilst with calm joy, safe landed on the coast</L>
<L>I view the waves, on which I once was tost.</L>
<L>Love is a medley of endearments, jars,</L>
<L>Suspicions, quarrels, reconcilements, wars;</L>
<L>Then peace again. O would it not be best,</L>
<L>To chase the fatal poison from our breast?</L>
<L>But since, so few can live from passion free,</L>
<L>Happy the man, and only happy he,</L>
<L>Who with such lucky stars begins his love,</L>
<L>That his cool judgment does his choice approve▪</L>
<L>Ill grounded passions quickly wear away;</L>
<L>What's built upon esteem can ne'er decay.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="157"/>
Mr. Walsh was of an amorous complexion, and in one of his letters mentions three of his amours, in pretty singular terms. I valued (says he) <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'one mistress, after I left loving her; I loved another after I left valuing her; I love and value the third, after having lost all hopes of her; and according to the course of my passions, I should love the next after having obtained her. However, from this time forward, upon what follies soever you fall, be pleased, for my sake, to spare those of love; being very well satisfied there is not one folly of that kind (excepting marriage) which I have not already committed. I have been, without raillery, in love with the beauty of a woman whom I have never seen; with the wit of one whom I never heard speak, nor seen any thing she has written, and with the heroic vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tues of a woman, without knowing any one action of her, that could make me think she had any; Cupid will have it so, and what can weak mortals do against so potent a god?'</Q> Such were the sentiments of our author when he was about 30 years of age.</P>
<P>Queen Anne constituted Mr. Walsh her master of the horse. On what account this place, in particu∣lar, was allotted him, we know not; but, with re∣gard to his literary abilities, Mr. Dryden in his postscript to his translation of Virgil, has asserted, that Mr. Walsh was the bes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tic then living; and Mr. Pope, speaking of our author, thus con∣cludes his Essay on Criticism, viz.<Q><L>To him, the wit of Greece, and Rome was known,</L>
<L>And ev'ry author's merit, but his own.</L>
<L>Such late was Walsh: the muses judge and friend,</L>
<L>Who justly knew to blame, or to commend;</L>
<L>To failings mild, but zealous for desert,</L>
<L>The clearest head, and the sincerest heart.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="158"/>
In the year 1714 the public were obliged with a small posthumous piece of Mr. Walsh's, entitled Aesculapius, or the Hospital of Fools, in imitation of Lucian. There is printed amongst Mr. Walsh's other performances, in a volume of the Minor Poets, an Essay on Pastoral Poetry, with a Short Defence of Virgil, against some of the reflexions of M. Fontenellé. That critic had censured Virgil for writing his pastorals in a too courtly stile, which, he says, is not proper for the Doric Muse; but Mr. Walsh has very judiciously shewn, that the Shepherds in Virgil's time, were held in greater estimation, and were persons of a much superior figure to what they are now. We are too apt to figure the ancient countrymen like our own, lead∣ing a painful life in poverty, and contempt, with∣out wit, or courage, or education; but men had quite different notions of these things for the first four thousand years of the world. Health and strength were then more in esteem, than the refinements of pleasure, and it was accounted more honourable to till the ground, and keep a flock of sheep, than to dissolve in wantonness, and effeminating sloth.</P>
<P>Mr. Walsh's other pieces consist chiefly of Ele∣gies, Epitaphs, Odes, and Songs; they are ele∣gant, tho' not great, and he seems to have had a well cultivated, tho' not a very extensive, un∣derstanding. Dryden and Pope have given their sanction in his favour, to whom he was personally known, a circumstance greatly to his advantage, for had there been no personal friendship, we have reason to believe, their encomiums would have been less lavish; at least his works do not carry so high an idea of him, as they have done. Mr. Walsh died about the year 1710.</P>

<P>ALMOST every circumstance relating to the life of this celebrated actor, is exposed to dis∣pute, and his manner of first coming on the stage, as well as the action of his younger years have been controverted. He was son of Mr. Betterton, under∣cook to king Charles the Ist, and was born in Tothill∣street Westminster, some time in the year 1635. Having received the rudiments of a genteel educa∣tion, and discovering a great propensity to books, it was once proposed he should have been educated to some learned profession; but the violence and con∣fusion of the times putting this out of the power of his family, he was at his own request bound appren∣tice to a bookseller, one Mr. Holden, a man of some eminence, and then happy in the friendship of Sir William Davenant. In the year 1656 it is pro∣bable Mr. Betterton made his first appearance on the stage, under the direction of Sir William, at the Opera-house in Charter-house-yard. It is said, that going frequently to the stage about his master's busi∣ness, gave Betterton the first notion of it, who shewed such indications of a theatrical genius, that Sir William readily accepted him as a performer. Im∣mediately after the restoration two distinct compa∣nies
<PB N="157" REF="160"/>
were formed by royal authority; the first in virtue of a patent granted to Henry Killegrew <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> called the king's company, the other in virtue of a patent granted to Sir William Davenant, which was stiled the duke's company<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cibber's Apology.</NOTE>. The former acted at the theatre royal in Drury-lane, the other at that in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. In order that the theatres might be decorated to the utmost advantage, and want none of the embellishments used abroad, Mr. Betterton, by command of Charles II. went to Paris, to take a view of the French stage, that he might the better judge what would contribute to the improvement of our own. Upon his return, Mr. Betterton introduced moving scenes into our theatre, which before had the stage only hung with tapestry. The scenes no doubt help the representa∣tion, by giving the spectator a view of the place, and increase the distress, by making the deception more powerful, and afflicting the mind with greater sensibility. The theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields being very inconvenient, another was built for them in Dorset-Garden, called the duke's theatre, to which they removed and followed their profession with great success, during all that reign of pleasure.</P>
<P>The stage at this time was so much the care of the state, that when any disputes arose, they were generally decided by his majesty himself or the duke of York, and srequently canvassed in the circle. Mr. Cibber assigns very good reasons, why at this time, theatrical amusements were so much in vogue; the first is, that after a long eclipse of gallantry during the rage of the civil war, people returned to it with double ardour; the next is, that women were then introduced on the stage, their parts formerly being supplied by boys, or effeminate young men, of which the famous Kynaston possessed the capital parts. When any art is carried to perfection, it sel∣dom happens, that at that particular period, the
<PB N="158" REF="161"/>
profits arising from it are high; and at this time the advantages of playing were very inconsiderable: Mr. Hart the greatest performer at the king's thea∣tre, had but three pounds a week, and Mr. Better∣ton, then but young, very probably had not so much, and besides, benefits then were things unheard of.</P>
<P>In 1670 Mr. Betterton married a gentlewoman on the same stage, one Mrs. Saunderson, who ex∣celled as an actress, every thing but her own con∣duct in life. In her, he was compleatly happy, and by their joint endeavours even in those days, they were able not only to acquire a genteel subsistance, but also to save what might support them in an ad∣vanced age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Biograph. Brittan. from the information of Southern.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After Sir William Davenant's death, the patent came into the hands of his son, Dr. Charles Dave∣nant, so well known to the world by his political writings; but, whether his genius was less fit than his father's for such an administration, or the king's company were really superior to his in acting, we cannot determine; but they gained upon the town, and Dr. Davenant was obliged to have recourse to the dramatic opera, rich scenes, and fine music, to support the stage on which Betterton played. The Dr. himself wrote the Opera of Circe, which came first on the stage in 1675, and was received with such applause, as gave hopes of succeeding in this new way. The same year a Pastoral, called Calista, or the Chaste Nymph, written by Mr. Crowne, at the desire of queen Katherine, was represented at court; and the ladies, Mary and Anne, daughters to the duke of York, played parts in it. On this occa∣sion Mr. Betterton instructed the actors, and Mrs. Betterton gave lessons to the princesses; in grateful remembrance of which queen Anne settled a pension of 100 l. per annum upon her. During this time an emulation subsisted between the two companies, and
<PB N="159" REF="162"/>
a theatrical war was proclaimed aloud, in which the town reaped the advantage, by seeing the parts per∣formed with the greater life. The duke's company however maintained it's superiority, by means of the new invented artillery, of music, machines, and scenery, and other underhand dealings, and bribing of actors in the opposite faction from performing their duty. By these measures, a coalition was ef∣fected, and the two companies joined together, and being united formed one of the perfectest that ever filled a stage, in 1682. It was in this united com∣pany that the merit of Betterton shone with unri∣valled lustre, and having survived the great actors on whose model he had formed himself, he was at liberty to discover his genius in its full extent, by re∣placing many of them with advantage in these very characters, in which, during their life-times, they had been thought inimitable; and all who have a taste for scenical entertainments cannot but thank the present laureat, for preserving for them so lively a portrait of Betterton, and painting him in so true a light, that without the imputation of blind adulation, he may be justly stiled the British Roscius.</P>
<P>This account is too important and picturesque to be here omitted; and it would be an injury to Bet∣terton not to shew him in that commanding light, in which the best judge of that species of excellence has placed him. <Q REND="inline"><P>"Betterton was an actor, as Shakespear was an author, both without competitors! form'd for the mu∣tual assistance, and illustration of each others genius! how Shakespear wrote, all men who have a taste for nature may read, and know—but with what high∣er rapture would he still be read, could they con∣ceive how Betterton play'd him! then might they know, the one was born alone to speak what the other only knew to write! Pity it is, that the mo∣mentary
<PB N="160" REF="163"/>
beauties flowing from an harmonious elocu∣tion cannot, like those of poetry, be their own re∣cord! that the animated graces of the player can live no longer than the instant breath and motion that presents them; or at best can but saintly glimmer through the memory, or imperfect attestation of a few surviving spectators. Could how Betterton spoke, be as easily known as what he spoke; then might you see the muse of Shakespear in her tri∣umph, with all their beauties in their best array, rising into real life, and charming her beholders. But alas! since all this is so far out of the reach of description, how shall I shew you Betterton? Should I therefore tell you, that all the Othellos, Hamlets, Hotspurs, Mackbeths, and Brutus's, whom you may have seen since his time have fallen far short of him: This still would give you no idea of his parti∣cular excelience. Let us see then what a particular comparison may do! whether that may yet draw him nearer to you?</P>
<P>You have seen a Hamlet perhaps, who, on the first appearance of his father's spirit, has thrown himself into all the straining vociferation requisite to express rage and fury, and the house has thundered with ap∣plause; tho' the misguided actor was all the while (as Shakespear terms it) tearing a passion into rags—I am the more bold to offer you this particular in∣stance, because the late Mr. Addison, while I sate by him, to see this scene acted, made the same ob∣servation, asking me with some surprize, if I thought Hamlet should be in so violent a passion with the Ghost, which though it might have astonished, it had not provok'd him? for you may observe that in this beautiful speech, the passion never rises be∣yond an almost breathless astonishment, or an im∣patience, limited by filial reverence, to enquire into the suspected wrongs that may have rais'd him from his peaceful tomb! and a desire to know what a spi∣rit so seemingly distrest, might wisn or enjoin a sor∣rowful
<PB N="161" REF="164"/>
son to execute towards his future quiet in the grave? this was the light into which Betterton threw this scene; which he open'd with a pause of mute amazement! then rising slowly, to a solemn, trem∣bling voice, he made the Ghost equally terrible to the spectator, as to himself! and in the descriptive part of the natural emotions which the ghastly vision gave him, the boldness of his expostu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation was still governed by decency, manly, but not braving; his voice never rising into that seeming outrage, or wild defiance of what he naturally rever'd. But alas! to preserve this medium, between mouthing, and meaning too little, to keep the attention more plea∣singly awake, by a tempered spirit, than by meer vehemence of voice, is of all the master-strokes of an actor the most difficult to reach. In this none yet have equall'd Betterton. But I am unwilling to shew his superiority only by recounting the errors of those, who now cannot answer to them; let their farther failings therefore be forgotten! or rather shall I in some measure excuse them? for I am not yet sure, that they might not be as much owing to the false judgment of the spectator, as the actor. While the million are so apt to be transported, when the drum of their ear is so roundly rattled; while they take the life of elocution to lie in the strength of the lungs, it is no wonder the actor, whose end is applause, should be so often tempted, at this easy rate, to excite it. Shall I go a little farther? and allow that this extreme is more pardonable than its opposite error. I mean that dangerous affectation of the monotone, or solemn sameness of pronuncia∣tion, which to my ear is insupportable; for of all faults that so frequently pass upon the vulgar, that of flatness will have the fewest admirers. That this is an error of ancient standing seems evident by what Hamlet says, in his instructions to the players, viz.<Q><PB N="162" REF="165"/>
Be not too tame, neither, &amp;c.</Q></P>

<P>The Actor, doubtless, is as strongly ty'd down to the rule of Horace, as the writer.<Q><L>Si vis me flere, dolendum est</L>
<L>Primum ipsi tibi—</L></Q> He that feels not himself the passion he would raise, will talk to a sleeping audience: But this never was the fault of Betterton; and it has often amaz'd me, to see those who soon came after him, throw out in some parts of a character, a just and graceful spirit, which Betterton himself could not but have applauded. And yet in the equally shining passages of the same character, have heavily dragg'd the sen∣timent along, like a dead weight; with a long ton'd voice, and absent eye, as if they had fairly forgot what they were about: If you have never made this observation, I am contented you should not know where to apply it.</P>
<P>A farther excellence in Betterton, was that he could vary his spirit to the different characters he acted. Those wild impatient starts, that fierce and flashing fire, which he threw into Hotspur, never came from the unruffled temper of his Brutus (for I have more than once seen a Brutus as warm as Hot∣spur) when the Betterton Brutus was provoked, in his dispute with Cassius, his spirit flew only to his eye; his steady look alone supply'd that terror, which he disdain'd, an intemperance in his voice should rise to. Thus, with a settled dignity of con∣tempt, like an unheeding rock, he repell'd upon himself the foam of Cassius. Perhaps the very words of Shakespear will better let you into my meaning:<Q><PB N="163" REF="166"/><L>Must I give way, and room, to your rash choler?</L>
<L>Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?</L></Q> And a little after,<Q><L>There is no terror, Cassius, in your looks! &amp;c.</L></Q> Not but, in some part of this scene, where he re∣proaches Cassius, his temper is not under this sup∣pression, but opens into that warmth which becomes a man of virtue; yet this is that hasty spark of anger, which Brutus himself endeavours to excuse.</P>
<P>But with whatever strength of nature we see the poet shew, at once, the philosopher and the heroe, yet the image of the actor's excellence will be still imperfect to you, unless language cou'd put colours in our words to paint the voice with.</P>
<P>Et si vis similem pingere, pinge sonum, is enjoin∣ing an impossibility. The most that a Vandyke can arrive at, is to make his portraits of great persons seem to think; a Shakespear goes farther yet, and tells you what his pictures thought; a Betterton steps beyond 'em both, and calls them from the grave, to breathe, and be themselves again, in feature, speech, and motion. When the skilful actor shews you all these powers united, he gratifies at once your eye, your ear, and your understanding. To conceive the pleasure rising from such harmony, you must have been present at it! 'tis not to be told you!"</P></Q></P>
<P>Thus was Betterton happy in his fortune, in the notice of his sovereign, in his fame and character, and in a general respect of all ranks of life; thus happy might he have continued, had he not, been persuaded to attempt becoming rich, and unluckily engaged in a scheme that swept away all his capital, and left him in real distress. This accident fell out in 1692; and is of too particular a kind to pass un∣noticed.
<PB N="164" REF="167"/>
Mr. Betterton had a great many friends amongst the wealthy traders in the city, and so amiable was his private life, that all who knew him were concerned, and interested in his success: A∣mongst these, there was a gentleman, whose name the author of his life thinks proper to conceal, who entered into the strictest amity with this actor. This gentleman in the year 1692 was concerned in an adventure to the East-Indies, upon the footing then allowed by the company's charter, which vessels so employed were stiled interlopers. The project of success was great, the gain unusually high; and this induced Mr. Betterton, to whom his friend offered any share in the business he pleased, to think of so large a sum as eight-thousand pounds; but it was not for himself, as he had no such sum in his power: and whoever considers the situation of the stage at that time will need no other argument to convince him of it. Yet he had another friend whom he was willing to oblige, which was the famous Dr. Rad∣cliffe; so Mr. Betterton advanced somewhat more than two-thousand pounds, which was his all, and the Dr. made it up eight-thousand. The vessel sailed to the East-Indies, and made as prosperous a voyage as those concerned in her could wish, and the war with France being then very warm, the captain very prudently came home north about, and arrived safe in Ireland; but in his passage from thence he was taken by the French. His cargo was upwards of 120, 000 l. which ruined Mr. Betterton, and broke the fortune and heart of his friend in the city: As for doctor Radcliffe, he expressed great concern for Mr. Betterton, but none for himself; the Dr. merrily consoled himself with observing, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that it was only trotting up 200 pair of stairs more, and things are as they were.'</Q></P>
<P>This accident, however fatal to Mr. Betterton's fortune, yet proved not so to his peace, for he bore it without murmur, and even without mention; so
<PB N="165" REF="168"/>
far from entertaining resentment against his friend in the city, who doubtless meant him well, he con∣tinued his intimacy till his death, and after his de∣cease took his only daughter under his protection, and watched over her education till she thought pro∣per to dispose of herself in marriage to Mr. Bowman the player, whose behaviour was such, as to gain the esteem of all that knew him; he has not been many years dead, and reflected credit on the re∣ports of the excellency of the old stage.</P>
<P>Such the virtue, such the honour of Mr. Betterton! who in his private character was as amiable as any he borrowed from the poets, and therefore was always deservedly considered as the head of the theatre, though vested there with very little power. The managers, as the companies were now united, exercised the most despotic stage-tyranny; and o∣bliged our author to remonstrate to them the hard∣ships they inflicted on their actors, and represent that bad policy of the few, forgetting their obliga∣tions to the many. This language in the ears of the theatrical ministry, sounded like treason; and therefore, instead of considering how to remedy the mischiefs complained of, they bent their thoughts to get rid of their monitor: as if the not hearing of faults was equivalent to mending them. It was with this view they began to give away some of Betterton's first parts to young actors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cibber's Life.</NOTE>, supposing this would abate his influence. This policy ruined them, and assisted him: The public refented their having plays ill acted when they knew they might have better.</P>
<P>The best players attached themselves wholly to Betterton, and desired him to turn his thoughts on some method of procuring himself and them justice. Thus theatrical despotism produced its own de∣struction, and the very steps taken to render Better∣ton
<PB N="166" REF="169"/>
desperate, pointed out the way for his de∣liverance. Mr. Betterton, who had a general acquaintance with people of fashion, represent∣ed his case to them, and at last by the interpo∣sition of the earl of Dorset, a patent was grant∣ed him for building a new play-house in Lin∣coln's-Inn-Fields, which he effected by a subscrip∣tion. The patentees, in order to make head against them, got over to their party Mr. Williams, and Mrs. Mountford, both eminent players; they had also recruits from the country, but with all the art of which they were capable, they continued still unequal to Mr. Betterton's company. The new theatre was opened in 1695, with very great advan∣tages: Mr. Congreve accepted of a share with this company, as Mr. Dryden had formerly with the king's; and the first play they acted was Congreve's Comedy of Love for Love. The king honoured it with his presence, there was a large and splendid audience, Mr. Betterton spoke a Prologue, and Mrs. Bracegirdle an Epilogue suited to the occasion, and it appeared by the reception they met with, that the town knew how to reward the merit of those the patentees used so ill. But with all these vast advantages, Betterton's company were not able to maintain this flow of prosperity, beyond two or three seasons: Mr. Congreve was a slow writer, Vanbrugh, and Mr. Cibber, who wrote for the other house, were more expeditious; and if they did not finish, they at least writ pleasing Comedies.</P>
<P>The frequency of new-pieces, however, gave such a turn in their favour, that Betterton's company with all their merit, had been undone, had not the Mourning Bride, and the Way of the World, come like reprieves, and saved them from the last gasp<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cibber's Life.</NOTE>. In a few years however, it appearing plainly, that without a new support from their friends, it was im∣possible for them to maintain their superiority, or
<PB N="167" REF="170"/>
independance; the patrons of Mr. Betterton set about a new subscription, for building a theatre in the Hay-market, under the direction of Sir John Vanbrugh, which was finished in 1706<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of Vanbrugh's Life.</NOTE>; and was to be conducted upon a new plan; music and scenery to be intermixed with the drama, which with the novelty of a new house, was likely to retrieve Mr. Betterton's affairs. This favour was kindly received by Mr. Betterton; but he was now grown old, his health and strength much impaired by constant application, and his fortune still worse than his health; he chose therefore (as a mutinous spirit, occasioned by disappointments, grew up amongst the actors) to decline the offer, and so put the whole design under the conduct of Sir John Vanbrugh, and Mr. Congreve, the latter of whom soon abandoned it entirely; and Mr. Bet∣terton's strength failing, many of the old players dying, and other accidents intervening, a reunion of the companies became absolutely necessary, and soon after took place.</P>
<P>Hitherto, Betterton is considered as at the head of his company, and the affairs of the stage are na∣turally connected with his, as the transactions of a nation are interwoven with the life of a prince. After our author reached seventy, his infirmities grew upon him greatly, his fits of the gout were more lasting, and more severe: His circumstances also, which had not been mended since he took up∣on him the conduct of the theatre, grew more ne∣cessitous, and all this joined to his wife's ill state of health, made his condition melancholy, at a time when the highest affluence could not have made them chearful. Yet under all these pressures, he kept up his spirit, and though less active, was as serene as ever. The public in those days, had a grateful remembrance of the pleasure Betterton had given
<PB N="168" REF="171"/>
them, and would not suffer so distinguished, and so deserving a man, after fifty-years service, to with∣draw, till he had received from them some marks of their favour.</P>
<P>In the spring of 1709 a benefit was granted to Mr. Betterton, and the play of Love for Love was acted for that purpose. Two of the best actresses that ever graced the stage appeared on it upon that occa∣sion, tho' they had long quitted it, to render the bene∣fit more advantageous: The part of Valentine was performed by Mr. Betterton, Angelica by Mrs. Bracegirdle, and Mrs. Barry performed that of Frail. The epilogue was written by Mr. Rowe. Mrs. Bracegirdle, Mrs. Barry, and Mr. Betterton, ap∣peared on the stage together, and the ladies taking hold of him, represented his infirmities of age, and pleaded his ancient merit, in a very natural and moving manner: This epilogue is exquisite in its kind. The profits arising from that benefit, we are told, amounted to 500 l. He had also a promise that the favour should be annually continued.</P>
<P>These extraordinary acts of public gratitude had a proper effect upon Mr. Betterton; who instead of indulging himself on their bounty, exerted the spirit given by this generosity, in their service, and appeared and acted as often as his health would permit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">History of the stage.</NOTE>. On the 20th of September following, in particular, he performed the part of Hamlet, with such vivacity, as well as justice, that it gave ample satisfaction to the best judges. This activity in the winter kept off the gout longer than usual, but the fit returning in the spring, was the more unlucky, as it happened at the time of his benefit, when the success of his play was sure to depend in a great measure upon his own performance. The play he made choice of was the Maid's Tragedy, in
<PB N="169" REF="172"/>
which he acted the part of Melantius; and notice was accordingly given by his good friend the Tatler; but the fit intervened; and that he might not dis∣appoint the town, Mr. Betterton was forced to sub∣mit to outward applications, to reduce the swelling of his feet: Which had such an effect, that he was able to appear on the stage, though he was obliged to use a slipper. He acted that day, says the Laureat, with unusual spirit, and briskness, by which he obtained universal applause; but this could not prevent his paying a very dear price for these marks of approbation, since the gouty humour, repelled by fomentations, soon seized upon the nobler parts; which being perhaps weakened by his extraordinary fatigue on that occasion, he was not able to make a long resistance: But on the 28th of April, 1710, he paid the debt to nature; and by his death occasioned the most undissembled mourn∣ing amongst people of rank and fashion.</P>
<P>His behaviour as a man, and his abilities as a player, raised his character, and procured him the esteem of all worthy and good men; and such honours were paid his memory, as only his memory could deserve.</P>
<P>On the second of May, his corpse was with much ceremony interred in Westminster-Abbey, and the excellent author of the Tatler, has given such an account of the solemnity of it, as will outlast the Abbey itself. And it is no small mor∣tification to us, that it is inconsistent with our proposed bounds, to transcribe the whole: It is writ with a noble spirit; there is in it an air of solemnity and grandeur; the thoughts rise natu∣rally from one another; they fill the mind with an awful dread, and consecrate Mr. Betterton to im∣mortality, with the warmth of friendship, heightened by admiration.</P>
<P>As to the character of this great man in his profes∣sion, the reader need but reflect on Mr. Colley Cib∣ber's account here inserted, who was well qualified
<PB N="170" REF="173"/>
to judge, and who, in his History of the Stage, has drawn the most striking pictures that ever were ex∣hibited; even the famous lord Clarendon, whose great excellence is characterising, is not more hap∣py in that particular, than the Laureat; no one can read his portraits of the players, without ima∣gining he sees the very actors before his eyes, their air, their attitudes, their gesticulations.</P>
<P>Mr. Betterton was a man of great study and application; and, with respect to the subjects that employed his attention, he was as much a master of them as any man. He was an excellent critic, more especially on Shakespear, and Fletcher. Mr. Rowe, who was a good judge, and also studied the same authors with deep attention, gives this testimony in his favour, and celebrates, in the warmest manner, Betterton's critical abilities. His knowledge of Shakespear's merit, gave him so strong, and so perfect an esteem for him, that he made a pilgrimage into Staffordshire to visit his tomb, and to collect whatever particulars tradition might have preserved in rela∣tion to his history; and these he freely communi∣cated to the same friend, who candidly acknow∣ledges, that the Memoirs of Shakespear's Life he published, were the produce of that journey, and freely bestowed upon him by the collector. Mr. Booth, who knew him only in his decline, fre∣quently made mention of him, and said, he never saw him either off, or on the stage, with∣out learning something from him; he frequently observed, that Mr. Betterton was no actor, but he put on his part with his clothes, and was the very man he undertook to be, 'till the play was over, and nothing more. So exact was he in following nature, that the look of surprize he assumed in the character of Hamlet so astonished Booth (when he first personated the Ghost) as to disable him for some moments from going on. He was so com∣municative, that in the most capital parts, he would
<PB N="171" REF="174"/>
enter into the grounds of his action, and explain, the principles of his art. He was an admirable master of the action of the stage, considered as in∣dependent of sentiment; and knew perfectly the connection, and business of the scenes, so as to attract, preserve, and satisfy the attention of an audience: An art extremely necessary to an actor, and very difficult to be attained.</P>
<P>What demonstrated his thorough skill in dramatic entertainments, was, his own performance, which was sufficient to establish a high reputation, independ∣ent of his other merit. As he had the happiness to pass through life without reproach, a felicity few at∣tain, so he was equally happy in the choice of a wife, with whom he spent his days in domestic quiet, though they were of very different tempers; he was naturally gay and chearful, she of a me∣lancholy reserved disposition. She was so strongly affected by his death, which was, in some measure, sudden, that she ran distracted, tho' she appeared rather a prudent and constant, than a fond and passionate wife: She was a great ornament to the stage, and her death, which happened soon after, was a public loss.</P>
<P>The Laureat, in his Apology, thus characterises her: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'She was, says he, though far advanced in years, so great a mistress of nature, that even Mrs. Barry, who acted Lady Macbeth after her, could not in that part, with all her superior strength, and melody of voice, throw out those quick and careless strokes of terror, from the disorder of a guilty mind, which the other gave us, with a facility in her manner that rendered them at once tremendous and delightsul. Time could not impair her skill, though it brought her person to decay: she was to the last the admiration of all true judges of nature, and lovers of Shakespear, in whose plays she chiefly excelled, and without a rival. When
<PB N="172" REF="175"/>
she quitted the stage, several good actresses were the better for her instruction. She was a woman of an unblemished and sober life, and had the honour to teach Queen Anne, when Princess, the part of Semandra in Mithridates, which she acted at court in King Charles's time. After the death of Mr. Betterton, that Princess, when Queen, ordered her a pension for life, but she lived not to receive more than the first half year of it.'</Q> Thus we have seen, that it is not at all impossible for persons of real worth, to transfer a reputation acquired on the stage, to the characters they possess in real life, and it often happens, as in the words of the poet,<Q><L>That scenic virtue forms the rising age,</L>
<L>And truth displays her radiance from the stage.</L></Q></P>
<P>The following are Mr. Betterton's dramatic works;<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Woman made a Justice; a Comedy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Unjust Judge, or Appius and Virginia; a Tragedy, written originally by Mr. John Webster, an old poet, who lived in the reign of James I. It was altered only by Mr. Betterton, who was so cautious, and reserved upon this head, that it was by accident the fact was known, at least with certainty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Amorous Widow, or the Wanton Wife, a Play, written on the plan of Moliere's George Dandin. The Amorous Widow has an under-plot interwoven, to accommodate the piece to the pre∣vailing English taste. Is was acted with great applause, but Mr. Betterton, during his life, could never be induced to publish it; so that it came into the world as a posthumous performance.
<PB N="173" REF="176"/>
The chief merit of this, and his other pieces, lies in the exact disposition of the scenes; their just length, great propriety, and natural connexions; and of how great consequence this is to the fate of either tragedy or comedy, may be learned from all Banks's plays, which, though they have nothing else to recommend them, yet never fail to move an audience, much more than some justly esteemed superior. Who ever saw Banks's earl of Essex re∣presented without tears; how few bestow them upon the Cato of Addison.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Besides these pieces, Betterton wrote several occa∣sional Poems, translations of Chaucer's Fables, and other little exercises. In a word, to sum up all that we have been saying, with regard to the character of this extraordinary person, as he was the most perfect model of dramatic action, so was he the most unblemished pattern of private and social qualities: Happy is it for that player who imitates him in the one, and still more happy that man who copies him in the other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We acknowledge a mistake, which we committed in the life of Marloe, concerning Betterton. It was there observed that he formed himself upon Alleyn, the famous founder of Dulwich-Hospital, and copied his theatrical excellencies: which, upon a review of Betterton's life, we find could not possibly happen as Alleyn was dead several years before Betterton was born: The observation should have been made of Hart.</NOTE>.</P>

His genius led him to make several attempts in dramatic poetry, in which he had various suc∣cess; but even when he met with the greatest en∣couragement, he was very sensible of his error, in quitting the profitable practice of the law, to pursue the entertainments of the stage; but he was fired with a thirst of fame, which reconciled to his mind the many uneasy sensations, to which the pre∣carious success of his plays, and the indigence of his profession naturally exposed him: Mr. Banks no doubt has gained one part of his design by commencing poet, namely, that of being remem∣bered after death, which Pope somewhere calls the poor estate of wits: For this gentleman has here a place amongst the poets, while nine tenths of the lawyers of his time, now sleep with their fathers secure in oblivion, and of whom we can only say, they lived, and died.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks's genius was wholly turned for tra∣gedy; his language is certainly unpoetical, and his numbers unharmonious; but he seems not to have been ignorant of the dramatic art: For in all his plays he has very forcibly rouzed the passions, kept the scene busy, and never suffered his characters to languish.</P>
<P>In the year 1684 Mr. Banks offered a tragedy to the stage called the Island Queens, or the Death
<PB N="175" REF="178"/>
of Mary Queen of Scots, which, it seems, was re∣jected, whether from its want of merit, or motives of a political kind, we cannot now determine, but Mr. Banks thought proper then to publish it. In the year 1706, he obtained the favour of Queen Anne to command it to be acted at the Theatre-Royal, which was done with success, for it is really a very moving tragedy. It has been often revived, and performed at the Theatres, with no inconsiderable applause.</P>
<P>His dramatic works are,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Rival Kings, or the Loves of Oroon∣dates and Statira, a Tragedy, acted at the The∣atre-Royal 1677. This play is dedicated to the Lady Catherine Herbert, and is chiefly formed on the Romance of Cassandra.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Destruction of Troy, a Tragedy, acted 1679. This play met with but indifferent success.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Virtue Betrayed, or Anna Bullen, a Trage∣dy, acted 1682. This play has been often acted with applause.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The Earl of Essex, or the Unhappy Favou∣rite, acted 1682, with the most general applause. Mr. Dryden wrote the Prologue, and Epilogue. It will be naturally expected, that, having men∣tioned the earl of Essex by Banks, we should say something of a Tragedy which has appeared this year on the Theatre at Covent-Garden, of the same name. We cannot but acknowledge, that Mr. Jones has improved the story, and heightened the incident in the last act, which renders the whole more moving; after the scene of parting between Essex, and Southampton, which is very affecting, Rutland's distress upon the melancholy occasion of parting from her husband, is melting to the last degree. It is in this scene Mr. Barry excells all his cotemporaries in tragedy; he there shews his power
<PB N="176" REF="179"/>
over our passions, and bids the heart bleed, in every accent of anguish. After Essex is carried out to execution, Mr. Jones introduces the queen at the tower, which has a very happy effect, and her manner of behaving on that occasion, makes her appear more amiable than ever she did in any play on the same subject. Mr. Jones in his lan∣guage (in this piece) does not affect being very poeti∣cal;—nor is his versification always mellifluent, as in his other writings;—but it is well adapted for speaking: The design is well conducted, the story rises regularly, the business is not suspended, and the characters are well sustained.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The Island Queens, a Tragedy, of which we have already given some account; the name of it was afterwards changed to the Albion Queens.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The Innocent Usurper, or the Death of La∣dy Jane Gray, a Tragedy, printed 1694. It was prohibited the stage, on account of some groundless insinuations, that it reflected upon the government. This play, in Banks's own opinion, is inferior to none of his former. Mr. Rowe has written likewise a Tragedy on this subject, which is a stock play at both houses; it is as much su∣perior to that of our author, as the genius of the former was greater than that of the latter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Cyrus the Great, a Tragedy. This play was at first rejected, but it afterwards got upon the stage, and was acted with great success; the plot is taken from Scudery's Romance of the Grand Cyrus.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>We cannot ascertain the year in which Banks died. He seems to have been a man of parts; his characteristic fault as a writer, was aiming at the sublime, which seldom failed to degenerate in∣to
<PB N="177" REF="180"/>
the bombast; fire he had, but no judgment to manage it; he was negligent of his poetry, nei∣ther has he sufficiently marked, and distinguished his characters; he was generally happy in the choice of his fables, and he has found a way of drawing tears, which many a superior poet has tried in vain.</P>

<HEAD>LADY CHUDLEIGH</HEAD>
<P>WAS born in the year 1656, and was daugh∣ter of Richard Lee of Winslade, in the county of Devon, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> She had an education in which literature seemed but little regarded, being taught no other language than her native tongue; but her love of books, incessant industry in the reading of them, and her great capacity to im∣prove by them, enabled her to make a very con∣siderable figure in literature.</P>
<P>She was married to Sir George Chudleigh of Ashton in the county of Devon, Bart, by whom she had issue Eliza Maria, who died in the bloom of life, (much lamented by her mother, who poured out her griefs on that occasion, in a Poem entitled a Dialogue between Lucinda and Marissa) and George, who succeeded to the title and estate, Thomas, and others.</P>
<P>She was a lady of great virtue, as well as un∣derstanding, and she made the latter of these subservient to the promotion of the former, which was much improved by study; but though she was enamoured of the charms of poetry, yet she de∣dicated
<PB N="178" REF="181"/>
some part of her time to the severer stu∣dy of philosophy, as appears from her excellent essays, which discover an uncommon degree of piety, and knowledge, and a noble contempt of those vanitie which the unthinking part of her sex so much regard, and so eagerly pursue.</P>
<P>The works which this lady produced, are,</P>
<P>The Ladies Defence, or the Bride-Woman's Counsellor answered, a Poem; in a Dialogue be∣tween Sir John Brute, Sir William Loveall, Me∣lissa, and a Parson. This piece has been several times printed; the writing it was occasioned by an angry sermon preached against the fair sex, of which her ladyship gives the following account; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Mr. Lintot, says she, some time since, intending to reprint my poems, desired me to permit him to add to them a Dialogue I had written in the year 1700, on a Sermon preached by Mr. Sprint, a Nonconformist, at Sherbourne in Dorsetshire; I refusing, for several reasons, to grant his re∣quest, he, without my knowledge, bought the copy of the Bookseller who formerly printed it, and, without my consent, or once acquainting me with his resolution, added to it the second edi∣tion of my poems; and that which makes the injury the greater, is, his having omitted the Epistle Dedicatory, and the Preface, by which means he has left the reader wholly in the dark, and exposed me to censure. When it was first printed I had reason to complain, but not so much as now: Then the Dedication was left en∣tire as I had written it, but the Preface so man∣gled, altered, and considerably shortened, that I hardly knew it to be my own; but being then published without a name, I was the less con∣cerned, but since, notwithstanding the great care I took to conceal it, it is known to be mine; I
<PB N="179" REF="182"/>
think myself obliged, in my own defence, to take some notice of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface to her Essays.</NOTE>.'</Q> The omission of this Pre∣face, which contained an answer to part of the sermon, and gave her reasons for writing the po∣em, had occasioned some people to make ill-na∣tured reflexions on it: this put her ladyship on justifying herself, and assuring her readers, that there are no reflexions in it levelled at any par∣ticular persons, besides the author of the Sermon; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'him (says she) I only blame for being too angry, for his not telling us our duty in a softer more engaging way: address, and good manners ren∣der reproofs a kindness; but where they are wanting, admonitions are always taken ill: as truths of this sort ought never to be concealed from us, so they ought never to be told us with an indecent warmth; a respectful tenderness would be more becoming a messenger of peace, the disciple of an humble, patient, meek, com∣miserating Saviour.'</Q></P>
<P>Besides this lady's poems, of which we shall give some account when we quote a specimen; she wrote Essays upon several subjects, in prose and verse, printed in 8vo. 1710. These Essays are upon Know∣ledge, Pride, Humility, Life, Death, Fear, Grief, Riches, Self-love, Justice, Anger, Calumny, Friend∣ship, Love, Avarice, Solitude, and are much admired for the delicacy of the stile, there being not the least appearance of false wit, or affected expression, the too common blemishes of this fort of writing: they are not so much the excursions of a lively imagination, which can often expatiate on the passions, and actions of men, with small experi∣ence of either, as the deliberate result of observa∣tions on the world, improved with reading, regu∣lated with judgment, softened by good manners, and heightened with sublime thoughts, and ele∣vated

piety. This treatise is dedicated to her Royal Highness the Princess Sophia, Electress, and Duchess Dowager of Brunswick, on which oc∣casion that Princess, then in her 80th year, ho∣noured her with the following epistle, written by the Electress in French, but which we shall here present to the reader in English.<LETTER>

<P>At the end of the second volume of the duke of Wharton's poems, are five letters from lady Chud∣leigh, to the revd. Mr. Norris of Bemmerton, and Mrs. Eliz. Thomas, the celebrated Corinna of Dryden.</P>
<P>She wrote several other things, which, though not printed, are carefully preserved in the family, viz. two Tragedies, two Operas, a Masque, some of Lucian's Dialogues, translated into Verse, Sa∣tirical Reflex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons on Saqualio, in imitation of one of Lucian's Dialogues, with several small Poems on various Occasions.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="184"/>
She had long laboured under the pains of a rheumatism, which had confined her to her cham∣ber a considerable time before her death, which happened at Ashton in Devonshire, December 15, 1710, in the 55<SUP>th</SUP> year of her age, and lies buried there without either monument or inscription.</P>
<P>The poetical Works of this Lady consist chiefly in the Song of the Three Children Paraphrased, some Pindaric Odes, Familiar Epistles, and Songs. We shall select as a specimen, a Dialogue between Lucinda and Marissa, occasioned by the death of her Ladyship's Daughter, in the early bloom of her youth. It is of a very melancholy cast, and expressive of the grief she must have felt upon that tender occasion. Her ladyship has in∣formed us in her preface to her poems, that she generally chose subjects suited to her present temper of mind <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'These pieces (says she) were the em∣ployments of my leisure hours, the innocent amuse∣ments of a solitary life; in them the reader will find a picture of my mind, my sentiments all laid open to their view; they will sometimes see me chearful, pleased, sedate, and quiet; at other times, grieving, complaining, and struggling with my passions, blaming myself, endeavouring to pay homage to my reason, and resolving for the fu∣ture with a decent calmness, an unshaken con∣stancy, and a resigning temper, to support all the troubles, all the uneasiness of life, and then, by unexpected emergencies, unforeseen disappoint∣ments, sudden, and surprising turns of fortune, discomposed, and shocked, 'till I have rallied my scattered fears, got new strength, and by making unwearied re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stance, gained the better of my afflictions, and restored my mind to its former tranquiliity.

that only necessary, which nature has made so; we should be no longer fond of riches, ho∣nours, applauses, and several other things, which are the unhappy occasions of much mis∣chief to the world; and doubtless, were we so happy as to have a true notion of the dignity of our nature, of those great things for which we were designed, and of the duration and felicity of that state to which we are hasten∣ing, we should scorn to stoop to mean actions, and blush at the thoughts of doing any thing below our character'</Q> In this manner does our authoress discover her sentiments of piety. We now shall subjoin the specimen;

<HEAD>THOMAS CREECH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was born near Sherborne in Dorsetshire, and bred up at the free school in that town, under Mr. Carganven, a man of eminent character, to whom in gratitude he inscribes one of the Idylliums of Theocritus, tran∣slated by him. His parents circumstances not being sufficient to bestow a liberal education upon him, colonel Strangeways, who was him∣self a man of taste and literature, took notice of the early capacity of Creech, and being wil∣ling to indulge his violent propensity to learning, placed him at Wadham College in Oxford, in the 16th year of his age, anno 1675, being then put under the tuition of two of the fellows. In the year 1683 he was admitted master of arts, and soon elected fellow of All-soul's College; at which time he gave distinguished proofs of his classical learning, and philosophy, before those who
<PB N="187" REF="190"/>
were appointed his examiners. The first work which brought our author into reputation, was his translation of Lucretius, which succeeded so well, that Mr. Creech had a party formed for him, who ventured to prefer him to Mr. Dryden, in point of genius. Mr. Dryden himself highly com∣mended his Lucretius, and in his preface to the second volume of Poetical Miscellanies thus cha∣racterises it. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I now call to mind what I owe to the ingenious, and learned translator of Lucre∣tius. I have not here designed to rob him of any part of that commendation, which he has so justly acquired by the whole author, whose frag∣ments only fall to my portion. The ways of∣our translation are very different; he follows him more closely than I have done, which be∣came an interpreter to the whole poem. I take more liberty, because it best suited with my de∣sign, which was to make him as pleasing as I could. He had been too voluminous, had he used my method, in so long a work; and I had certainly taken his, had I made it my business to translate the whole. The preference then is justly his; and I join with Mr. Evelyn in the con∣fession of it, with this additional advantage to him, that his reputation is already established in this poet; mine is to make its fortune in the world. If I have been any where obscure in following our common author; or if Lucretius himself is to be condemned, I refer myself to his excellent annotations, which I have often read, and always with some pleasure.'</Q></P>
<P>Many poets of the first class, of those times, addressed Mr. Creech in commendatory verses, which are prefixed to the translation of Lucretius: but this sudden blaze of reputation was soon ob∣scured, by his failing in an arduous task, which the success of his Lucretius prompted him to attempt. This was a translation of the works of Horace,
<PB N="188" REF="191"/>
an author more diversified, and consequently more difficult than Lucretius. Some have insinuated, that Mr. Dryden, jealous of his rising fame, and willing to take advantage of his vanity, in order to sink his reputation, strenuously urged him to this undertaking, in which he was morally certain Creech could not succeed. Horace is so various, so ex∣quisite, and perfectly delightful, that he who culls flowers in a garden so replenished with nature's productions, must be well acquainted with her form, and able to delineate her beauties. In this attempt Creech failed, and a shade was thrown over his reputation, which continued to obscure it to the end of his life. It is from this circumstance al∣ledged, that Mr. Creech contracted a melancholy, and moroseness of temper, which occasioned the dis∣inclination of many towards him, and threw him into habits of recluseness, and discontent. To this some writers likewise impute the rash attempt on his own life, which he perpetrated at Oxford, in 1701. This act of suicide could not be occasioned by want, for Mr. Jacob tells us, that just before that accident, he had been presented by the college to the living of Welling in Hertfordshire. Mr. Bar∣nard in his Nouvelles de la Republiques de Lettres, assigns another cause besides the diminution of his fame, which might occasion this disastrous fate. Mr. Creech, though a melancholy man, was yet subject to the passion of love. It happened that he fixed his affections on a lady who had either previously engaged hers, or who could not bestow them upon him; this disappointment, which was a wound to his pride, so affected his mind, that, unable any longer to support a load of misery, he hanged himself in his own chamber. Which ever of these causes induced him, the event was melancholy, and not a little heightened by his being a clergyman, in whose heart religion should have taken deeper root, and maintained a more sa∣lutary
<PB N="189" REF="192"/>
influence, than to suffer him thus to stain his laurels with his own blood.</P>
<P>Mr. Creech's works, besides his Lucretius alrea∣dy mentioned, are chiefly these,<LIST>
<ITEM>The Second Elegy of Ovid's First Book of Ele∣gies. The 6th, 7th, 8th, and 12th Elegies of Ovid's Second Book of Elegies. The 2d and 3d Eclogue of Virgil. The Story of Lucretia, from Ovid de Fastis. B. ii. The Odes, Satires, and Epistles of Horace already mentioned, dedicated to John Dryden, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who is said to have held it in great contempt, which gave such a shock to Mr. Creech's pride. The author in his preface to this translation has informed us, that he had not an ear capable of distinguishing one note in mu∣sic, which, were there no other, was a sufficient objection against his attempting the most musical poet in any language.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The same year he published his Translation of the Idylliums of Theocritus, with Rapin's Dis∣course on Pastorals, as also the Life of Phelopidas, from the Latin of Cornelius Nepos.</ITEM>
<ITEM>In Dryden's Translation of Juvenal and Persius, Mr. Creech did the 13th Satire of Juvenal, and subjoined Notes. He also translated into English, the verses before Mr. Quintenay's Compleat Gar∣diner. The Life of Solon, from the Greek of Plutarch. Laconic Apophthegms, or Remarkable Sayings of the Spartans, printed in the first Vo∣lume of Plutarch's Morals. A Discourse concern∣ing Socrates's Daemon. The two First Books of the Symposiacs.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>These are the works of Mr. Creech: A man of such parts and learning, according to the accounts of all who have written of him, that, had he not by the last act of his life effaced the merit of his labours, he would have been an or∣nament
<PB N="190" REF="193"/>
as weil to the clerical profession, as his country in general. He well understood the an∣cients, had an unusual penetration in discover∣ing their beauties, and it appears by his own translation of Lucretius, how elegantly he could cloath them in an English attire. His judgment was solid; he was perfectly acquainted with the rules of criticism, and he had from nature an extraordinary genius. However, he certainly over∣rated his importance, or at least his friends deceiv∣ed him, when they set him up as a rival to Dryden; but if he was inferior to that great man in judgment, and genius, there were few of the same age to whom he needed yield the palm. Had he been content to be reckoned only the se∣cond, instead of the first genius of the times, he might have lived happy, and died regreted and reverenced, but like Caesar of old, who would ra¦ther be the lord of a little village, than the second man in Rome, his own ambition overwhelmed him.</P>
<P>We shall present the reader with a few lines from the second Book of Lucretius, as a specimen of our author's versification, by which it will be found how much he fell short of Dryden in point of har∣mony, though he seems to have been equal to any other poet, who preceded Dryden, in that par∣ticular.<Q><L>'Tis pleasant, when the seas are rough, to stand,</L>

<HEAD>ARTHUR MAYNWARING, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>A Gentleman distinguished both for poetry and politics, as well as the gay accom∣plishments of life. He was born at lghtfield, in the year 1668, and educated at the grammar-school at Shrewsbury, where he remained four or five years; and at about seventeen years of age, was removed to Christ's Church in Oxford, under the tuition of Mr. George Smalridge, afterwards bishop of Bristol. After he removed from Oxford, he went into Cheshire, where he lived several years with his uncle, Mr. Francis Cholmondley, a gen∣tleman of great integrity and honour; but by a po∣litical prejudice, very averse to the government of William the IIId, to whom he refused to take the oaths, and instilled anti-revolution principles into his nephew<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oldmixon's Life of Maynwaring.</NOTE>, who embraced them warmly; and on his first entry into life, reduced to practice what he held in speculation. He wrote several pieces in favour of James the IId's party: amongst which was a Panegyric on that King. He wrote another intitled the King of Hearts, to ridicule lord Dela∣mere's entry into London, at his first coming to town after the revolution. This poem was said to be Dry∣den's, who was charged with it by Mr. Tonson; but
<PB N="194" REF="197"/>
he disowned it, and told him it was written by an in∣genious young gentleman, named Maynwaring, then about twenty-two years of age.</P>
<P>When our author was introduced to the acquaint∣ance of the duke of Somerset, and the earls of Dorset, and Burlington, he began to entertain (says Old∣mixon) very different notions of politics: Whether from the force of the arguments made use of by those noblemen; or, from a desire of preferment, which he plainly saw lay now upon the revolution interest, cannot be determined; but he espoused the Whig ministry, as zealously as he had formerly struggled for the exiled monarch.</P>
<P>Our author studied the law till he was five or six and twenty years old, about which time his father died, and left him an estate of near eight-hundred pounds a year, but so incumbred, that the interest money amounted to almost as much as the revenue. Upon the conclusion of the peace of Ryswick, he went to Paris, where he became acquainted with Monsieur Boileau, who invited him to his country house, entertained him very elegantly, and spoke much to him of the English poetry, but all by way of enquiry; for he affected to be as ignorant of the English Muse, as if our nation had been as bar∣barous as the Laplanders.</P>
<P>A gentleman, a friend of Mr. Maynwaring, visit∣ing him some time after, upon the death of Mr. Dryden, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Boileau, said that he was wonderfully pleased to see by the public papers, that the English nation had paid so extraordinary honours to one of their poets, burying him at the public charge;'</Q> and then asked the gentleman who that poet was, with as much indifference as if he had never heard Dryden's name; which he could no more be unacquainted with, than our country was with his; for he often frequented lord Monta∣gue's house, when he was embassador in France,
<PB N="195" REF="198"/>
and being also an intimate friend of Monsieur De la Fontaine, who had spent some time in England, it was therefore impossible he could be ignorant of the same of Dryden; but it is peculiar to that na∣tion to hold all others in contempt. The French would as fain monopolize wit, as the wealth and power of Europe; but thanks to the arms and genius of Britain, they have attempted both the one and the other without success.</P>
<P>Boileau's pretending not to know Dryden, to use the words of Milton, <Q REND="inline">'argued himself unknown.'</Q> But perhaps a reason may be assigned, why the wits of France affected a contempt for Mr. Dryden, which is this. That poet, in many of his Prefaces and De∣dications, has unanswerably shewn, that the French writers are really deficient in point of genius; that the correctness for which they are remarkable, and that even pace which they maintain in all their dramatic compositions, is a proof that they are not capable of sublime conceptions; that they never rise to any degree of elevation, and are in truth uninspired by the muses:—Judgment they may have to plan and conduct their designs; but few French poets have ever found the way of writing to the heart. Have they attained the sublime height of Shake∣spear, the tenderness of Otway, or the pomp of Rowe? and yet these are names which a French versifier will pretend, with an air of contempt, ne∣ver to have heard of.</P>
<P>The truth is, our poets have lately done the French too much honour, by translating their pieces, and bringing them on the stage; as if our own stock was exhausted, and the British genius had failed: But it is some satisfaction, that these attempts seem now to be discouraged; we have seen a late play of theirs (we call it a play, for it was neither a tragedy, nor a comedy) translated by a languid poet of our own, received with the coolness it de∣served.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="199"/>
But to return to Mr. Maynwaring. Upon his arri∣val in England, from France, he was made one of the commissioners of the customs, in which post he distinguished himself by his skill and fidelity. Of the latter of these qualities we have an instance, in his treatment of a man, who sollicited to be a tide-waiter: Somebody had told him that his best way to succeed would be to make a present. The advice had been perhaps good enough if he had not mistaken his man. For understanding that Mr. Maynwaring had the best interest at the board of any of the commissioners, with the lords of the treasury; he sent him a letter, with a purse of fifty-guineas, desiring his favour towards obtaining the place he sollicited: Afterwards he delivered a petition to the board, which was read, and several of the commissioners having spoke to it, Mr. Mayn∣waring took out the purse of fifty guineas, and the letter, telling them that as long as he could prevent it, that man should never have this, or any other place in the revenue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life, p. xviii. xix.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Mr. Maynwaring was admitted a member of the Kit-Kat Club, and was considered as one of the chief ornaments of it, by his pleasantry and wit.</P>
<P>In the beginning of queen Anne's reign, lord treasurer Godolphin, engaged Mr. Donne, to quit the office of auditor of the imprests, his lordship paying him several thousand pounds for his doing it, and he never let Mr. Maynwaring know what he was doing for him, till he made him a present of a patent for that office, worth about two-thousand pounds a year in time of business. In the Parlia∣ment which met in 1705, our author was chosen a burgess for Preston in Lancashire<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. xxii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He had a considerable share in the Medley, and was author of several other pieces, of which we shall presently give some account.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="200"/>
He died at St. Albans, November the 13th, 1712, having some time before made his will; in which he left Mrs. Oldfield, the celebrated actress, his executrix, by whom he had a son, named Arthur Maynwaring. He divided his estate pretty equally between that child, Mrs. Oldfield, and his sister. Mr. Oldmixon tells us, that Mr. Maynwaring loved this actress, for nine or ten years before his death, with the strongest passion: It was in some measure owing to his instructions that she became so finished a player; for he understood the action of the stage as well as any man, and took great pleasure to see her excell in it. He wrote several Prologues and Epilogues for her, and would always hear her rehearse them in private, before she spoke them on the stage. His friends of both sexes quarrelled with him for his attachment to her, and so much re∣sented it, that Mrs. Oldfield frequently remonstrated to him, that it was for his honour and interest to break off the intrigue: which frankness and friend∣ship of hers, did, as he often confessed, but engage him the more firmly; and all his friends at last gave over importuning him to leave her, as she gained more and more upon him.</P>
<P>In honour of our author, Mr. Oldmixon ob∣serves, that he had an abhorrence of those that swore, or talked profanely in conversation. He looked upon it as a poor pretence to wit, and ne∣ver excused it in himself or others.—I have already observed, that our author had a share in the Medley, a paper then set up in favour of the Hanoverian succession, in which he combats the Examiner, who wrote on the opposite, or, at least, the High-Church Interest.</P>
<P>He also wrote the following pieces.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Remarks on a late Romance, intitled the Me∣morial of the Church of England, or the History of the Ten Champions.</ITEM>

<ITEM>6. There was a Manuscript given him to peruse, which contained Memoirs of the duke of Marl∣borough's famous march to Blenheim: It was written by a chaplain of the duke's, with great exactness as to the incidents, but was defective in form. Mr. Maynwaring was desired to alter and improve it, which he found too difficult a talk; but being great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y pleased with the particular account of all that pass'd in that surprizing march, he resolved that it should not be lost, and to give it a new and more perfect form himself, by reducing a kind of diary into a regular history.

</LIST></P>
<P>These are chiefly the works of Maynwaring, who was a gentleman of genius, and appears to have been a good-natur'd honest man. His moral life has only been blamed for his intrigue with Mrs. Oldfield; but I am persuaded when the accomplishments of that lady are remembered,
<PB N="200" REF="203"/>
and the delicacy of an amour between people of their fashion is considered, that the most rigid in chastity, will be disposed rather to pity than in∣dignation. The force of love is hardly to be con∣quered by reason, and he must have a stoical consti∣tution indeed, who has read the descriptions given of Mrs. Oldfield's person, as well as the endow∣ments of her mind, and the sweetness of her dis∣position, who severely condemn a man for loving her: none but those who have been in love, can say, how forcibly the passion moves, and to what extravagance it will often carry the wisest men; and with Mr. Maynwaring's opportunities, who could have refisted the charms of Mrs. Oldfield?</P>

<HEAD>The HON. Mrs. MONK.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Lady was the daughter of the Right Hon. the Lord Molesworth, a nobleman of Ireland, and wife of George Monk, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> By the force of her natural genius, she learnt the Latin, Italian, and Spanish tongues, and by a constant read∣ing of the best authors in those languages, became so great a proficient, especially in poetry, that she wrote many pieces that were deemed worthy of publication, and soon after her death, were print∣ed and published with the following title, Marinda. Poems, and Translations upon several occasions, printed in London, 1716. The book is addressed to her Royal Highness Carolina Princess of Wales, in a long dedication, dated March 26, 1716, writ∣ten by her father, who thus affectionately speaks of the poems and their author. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'Most of them (says he) are the product of the leisure hours of a young gentlewoman lately de∣ceased; who in a remote country retirement, without omitting the daily care due to a large family, not only perfectly acquired the several languages here made use of; but tho good morals and principles contained in those books, so as to put them in practice, as well during her life and languishing sickness, as the hour of her death; in short she died not only like a Christian, but a Roman lady, and so became at once the object of

the grief, and comfort of her relations. As much as I am obliged to be sparing in commending what belongs to me, I cannot forbear thinking som of these circumstances uncommon enough to be taken notice of: I loved her more, because she deserved it, than because she was mine, and I cannot do greater honour to her memory, than by consecrating her labours, or rather diversion to your Royal Highness, as we found most of them in her es rutore, after her death, written with her own hand, little expecting, and as little desiring the public should have any opportunity, either of applauding or condemning them.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Jacob tells us, that these Poems and Trans∣lations, shew the true spirit, and numbers of poetry, a delicacy of turn, and justness of thought and ex∣pression. They consist of Ecclogues; the Masque of the Virtues against Love, from Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rini; some translations from the French and Italians; Familiar Epistles, Odes and Madrigals.</P>
<P>Her poetry has great warmth, and tenderness of sentiment. The following Epitaph on a lady of pleasure, was written by her,<Q><LG TYPE="epitaph">

<L>At length the conqueror death asserts his right,</L>
<L>And will forever veil me from thy sight.</L>
<L>He wooes me to him, with a chearful grace;</L>
<L>And not one terror clouds his meagre face.</L>
<L>He promises a lasting rest from pain;</L>
<L>And shews that all life's fleeting joys are vain.</L>
<L>Th' eternal scenes of Heaven he sets in view,</L>
<L>And tells me, that no other joys are true.</L>
<L>But love, fond love, would yet resist his power;</L>
<L>Would fain a-while defer the parting hour:</L>
<L>He brings the mourning image to my eyes,</L>

<HEAD>Mr. THOMAS BROWN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS humorous poet was the son of a considerable Farmer of Shiffnall, in Shrop∣shire, and educated at Newport-school in that coun∣ty, under the reverend and learned Dr. Edwards, a gentleman who had the honour to qualify many persons of distinction for the university. Under the tuition of this master, he attained a knowledge of the Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and Spanish languages, and his exercises were generally so well performed, that the Dr. was filled with admiration of his parts. From Newport school he removed to Christ's-Church College in Oxford, and distinguished himself there for his easy attainments in literature; but some little irregularities of his life would not suffer him to continue long at the university. It is probable he became sick of that discipline, which they who spend their life in the recluseness of a col∣lege, are in some measure obliged to submit to. The father of Mr. Brown, who intended to have him educated to some profession, was not made ac∣quainted with his design of quitting the university, and having remitted him a sum of money, to be appropriated for the promotion of his studies, his son thought proper to defeat his kind intentions.</P>
<P>With this money, our author plann'd a scheme of going to London, which he soon after executed, not very advantageously.—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'My first business, says he, was to apply myself to those few friends I had there, who conjecturing I had left the university, exclusive of my father's know∣ledge, gave but slender encouragement to a young
<PB N="205" REF="208"/>
beginner. However, no whit daunted (my first resolution still standing by me) I launched forth into the world, committing myself to the mercy of fortune, and the uncertain temper of the town. I soon acquired a new sett of acquaintance; and began to have a relish of what I had only tasted before by hearsay; and indeed, every thing served to convince me, I had changed for the better, except that my slender subsistance began to waste extremely; and ruminating upon the difficulty of obtaining a supply, I was then laid under the ne∣cessity of thinking what course to steer. I knew how justly I had incurred the displeasure of an indulgent father, and how far I had put myself from retrieving his favour. Amidst this serous contemplation! I resolved to go through stitch with my enterprize, let what will come on't: However, that I might use discretion, to palliate an unforeseen event, I determined 'twere better to trust to the flexibility of a father's temper, than to lay too great a stress upon the humanity of for∣tune, who would let a man of morals starve if he depended on her favours. Therefore, without more ado (having taken my sorrowful leave of my last guinea, and reduced Carolus Secundus, from a whole number, to decimal fractions) I dispatched a letter into the country, full of excuse, and penitence, baited with all the submissive elo∣quence imaginable. In the mean time, I was no less sedulous to find out some employment, that might suit with my genius, and with my depen∣dancies at home, render my life easy.'</Q></P>
<P>Whether his father was touched by the epistle which our author in consequence of this resolution wrote to him, we cannot ascertain, as there is no mention made of it. Soon after this, we find him school master of Kingston upon Thames, and happy for him, had he continued in that more certain em∣ployment,
<PB N="206" REF="209"/>
and not have so soon exchanged it for beggary and reputation. Mr. Brown, impatient of a recluse life, quitted the school, and came again to London; and as he found his old com∣panions more delighted with his wit, than ready to relieve his necessities, he had recourse to scribbling for bread, which he performed with various success. Dr. Drake, who has written a defence of our au∣thor's character, prefixed to his works, informs us, that the first piece which brought him into reputa∣tion, was an account of the conversion of Mr. Bays, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ialogue, which met with a reception suitable to the wit, spirit, and learning of it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut though this raised his fame, yet it added very little to his profit: For, though it made his company exceed∣ingly covet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and might have recommended him to the great, as well as to the ingenious, yet he was of a temper not to chuse his acquaintance by interest, and slighted such an opportunity of recommending himself to the powerful and opulent, as, if wisely improved, might have procured him dignities and preferments. The stile of this dialogue, was like that of his ordinary conversation, lively and faceti∣ous. It discovered no small erudition, but managed with a great deal of humour, in a burlesque way; which make both the reasoning and the extensive reading, which are abundantly shewn in it, ex∣tremely surprizing and agreeable. The same man∣ner and humour runs through all his writings, whether Dialogues, Letters, or Poems.</P>
<P>The only considerable objection, which the critics have made to his works is, that they want delicacy. But in answer to this, it may be affirmed, that there is as much refinement in his works, as the nature of humorous satire, which is the chief beauty of his compositions, will admit; for, as satire requires strong ideas, the language will sometimes be less polished. But the delicacy so
<PB N="207" REF="210"/>
much demanded, by softening the colours weakens the drawing. Mr. Brown has been charged with inequality in his writings: which is inseparable from human<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty.</P>
<P>Our author's letters, though written carelesly to private friends, bear the true stamp and image of a genius. The variety of his learning may be seen in the Lacedaemonian Mercury, where abundance of critical questions of great nicety, are answered with much solidity and judgment, as well as wit, and humour. But that design exposing him too much to the scruples of the grave and reserved, as well as to the censure, and curiosity of the impertinent, he soon discontinued it. Besides, as this was a periodi∣cal work, he who was totally without steadiness, was very ill qualified for such an undertaking. When the press called upon him for immediate supply, he was often found debauching himself at a tavern, and by excessive drinking unable to perform his engagements with the public, by which no doubt the work considerably suffered.</P>
<P>But there is yet another reason why Mr. Brown has been charged with inequality in his writings, viz. that most of the anonymous pieces which hap∣pened to please the town, were fathered upon him. This, though in reality an injury to him, is yet a proof of the universality of his reputation, when whatever pleased from an unknown hand was ascribed to him; but by these means he was reputed the writer of many things unworthy of him. In poetry he was not the author of any long piece, for he was quite unambitious of reputation of that kind. They are generally Odes, Satires, and Epi∣grams, and are certainly not the best part of his works. His Translations in Prose are many, and of various kinds. His stile is strong and masculine; and if he was not so nice in the choice of his authors, as might be expected from a man of his taste, he
<PB N="208" REF="211"/>
must be excused; for he performed his translations as a task, prescribed him by the Booksellers, from whom he derived his chief support. It was the misfortune of our author to appear on the stage of the world, when fears, and jealousies had soured the tempers of men, and politics, and polemics, had almost driven mirth and good nature out of the nation: so that the careless gay humour, and negligent chearful wit, which in former days of tranquility, would have recommended him to the conversation of princes, was, in a gloomy period, lost upon a people incapable of relishing genuine humour.</P>
<P>An anonymous author who has given the world some account of Mr. Brown, observes, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that it was not his immorality that hindered him from climbing to the top of poetry, and preferment; but that he had a particular way of sinning to himself. To speak in plain English (says he) Tom Brown had less the spirit of a gentleman than the rest of the Wits, and more of a Scholar, Tom thoughts himself as happy with a retailer of damnation in an obscure hole; as another to have gone to the devil with all the splendour of a fine equipage. 'Twas not the brightness of Cae∣lia's eyes, nor her gaudy trappings that attract∣ed his heart. Cupid might keep his darts to himself; Tom always carried his fire about him. If she had but a mouth, two eyes, and a nose, he never enquired after the regularity of her dress, or features. He always brought a good stomach with him, and used but little ceremony in the preface. As of his mistresses, so he was very negligent in the choice of his compani∣ons, who were sometimes mean and despicable, a circumstance which never fails to ruin a man's reputation. He was of a lazy temper, and the Booksellers who gave him credit enough as to his capacity, had no confidence to put in his
<PB N="209" REF="212"/>
diligence.'</Q> The same gentleman informs us, that though Tom Brown was a good-natured man, yet he had one pernicious quality, which eternally procured him enemies, and that was, rather to lose his friend, than his joke.</P>
<P>One of his lampoons had almost cost him a procession at the cart's tail; nor did he either spare friend or foe, if the megrim of abuse once seized him. He had a particular genius for scandal, and dealt it out liberally when he could find occasion. He is famed for being the author of a Libel, fix∣ed one Sunday morning on the doors of Westmin∣ster-abbey, and many others, against the clergy and quality. As for religion, Brown never professed any, and used to say, that he understood the world better than to have the imputation of righteous∣ness laid to his charge: and the world, to be even with him, really thought him an Atheist. But though Brown never made any professions of reli∣gion, yet it proceeded more from affectation than conviction. When he came upon his death-bed, he expressed remorse for his past life, and disco∣vered at that period, sentiments which he had never before suffered to enter his mind. This penitential behaviour, in the opinion of some, was the occasion why all his brethren neglected him, and did not bestow on his memory one elegiac song, nor any of the rites of verse. We find no encomiums upon him, but what appeared in a Grubstreet Journal, which, however, are much su∣perior to what was usually to be found there.<Q><L>—A mournful muse from Albion swains pro∣duce,</L>

Towards the latter end of our author's life, we are informed by Mr. Jacob, that he was in favour with the earl of Dorset, who invited him to din∣ner on a Christmas-day, with Mr. Dryden, and some other gentlemen, celebrated for ingenuity, (according to his lordship's usual custom) when Mr. Brown, to his agreeable surprize, found a Bank Note of 50 l. under his plate, and Mr. Dryden at the same time was presented with another of 100 l. Acts of munificence of this kind were very com∣mon with that generous spirited nobleman.</P>
<P>Mr. Brown died in the year 1704, and was interred in the Cloyster of Westminster-abbey, near the re∣mains of Mrs. Behn, with whom he was in∣timate in his life-time. His whole works consist∣ing of Dia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogues, Essays, Declamations, Satires, Letters from the Dead to the Living, Translati∣ons, Amusements, &amp;c. were printed in 4 vol. 12mo, 1707. In order that the reader may conceive a true idea of the spirit and humour, as well as of the character of Tom Brown, we shall here insert an Imaginary Epistle, written from the Shades to his Friends among the Living; with a copy of Verses representing the Employment of his poetical Brethren in that fancied Region.<LETTER>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Bear it with no little concern to find myself so soon forgot among ye; I have paid as constant attendance to post-hours, in expectation to hear from ye, as a hungry Irish Man (at twelve) to a three-penny ordinary, or a decayed beau for nice eating to a roasting-cook's. No amorous-keeping fool, banished from his Chloris in town, to his country solitude, has waited with greater impati∣ence for a kind epistle from her, than I for one from you. I have searched all private packets, and examined every stragling ghost that came from your parts, without being able to get the least in∣telligence of your affairs. This is the third since my arrival in these gloomy regions, and I can give myself no reason why I have received none in an∣swer, unless the packet-boat has been taken by the French, or that so little time has quite excluded me from your memories. In my first I gave you an account of my journey hither, and my recep∣tion among the ingenious in these gloomy regions.</P>
<P>I arrived on the Banks of Acheron, and found Charon scooping his wherry, who seeing me ap∣proach him, bid me sit down a little, for he had been hard worked lately, and could not go with a single passenger: I was willing enough to embrace the proposal, being much fatigued and weary. Having finished what he was about, he cast his rueful aspect up to the clouds, and demonstrating from thence (as I suppose) it was near dinner-time, he took from out a locker or cupboard in the stern of his pinnace, some provender pinned
<PB N="212" REF="215"/>
up in a clean linnen clout, and a jack of liquor, and fell too without the least shew of ceremony, unless indeed it were to off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r me the civility of partaking with him. He m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttered something to himself, which might be g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce as far as I know; but if it were, 'twas as short as that at an Aucti∣on-dinner, nor did he devour what was before him with less application than I have seen some there. For my part, I could not but contemplate on his shaggy locks, his wither'd sun-burnt coun∣tenance, together with the mightiness and sanctity of his beard; but above all, his brawny chopt knuckles employed my attention: In short, hav∣ing sati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fied the cormorant in his guts, he had time to ask me what country-man I was? to which I submissively answered, an English-man: O, says he, those English-men are merry rogues, and love mischief; I have sometimes a diverting story from thence: What news have you brought with you? truly I told his highness I came away a little dissatisfied, and had not made any remarks on the world for some time before my death; and for news I had not leisure to bring any thing of moment. But ere we had talked much more, we saw two other passengers approach us, who, by their often turning to one another, and their lay∣ing down arguments with their hands, seemed to be in warm debate together; which was as we conjectured; for when they drew nearer to us, they proved to be a termagant High-Flyer, and a puritanical Scripturian, a fiery Scotchman: Oc∣casional Conformity was their subject; for I heard the Scot tell him 'twas all popery, downright popery, and that the inquisition in Spain was christianity to it, by retarding the sons of grace from partaking of the gifts of the Lord; he said it was the bui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding of Babel, and they were con∣fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded in the works of their hands by the confu∣sion
<PB N="213" REF="216"/>
of tongues; such crys, says he, went forth be∣fore the desolation of the great city.</P>
<P>Thou the son of grace, says the other, thou art a son of Satan, and hast preached up iniqui∣ty; ye are the evil tares, and the land can never prosper 'till ye are rooted out from among the good corn.</P>
<P>Thou art an inventer of lies, said the disciple of John Calvin, and the truth is not in thee; ye are bloody minded wretches, and your sury is the on∣ly sign of your religion, as the steeple is to the church; your organs are the prophane tinkling of the cimbals of Satan, that tickle the ears with vanity.</P>
<P>Thus the dispute lasted till they came to us, and getting into the boat, they jostled for pre-emi∣nence, which might have proved a sharp conflict, had not the old fellow took up a stretcher and parted them. After which we passed peaceably over to the other side: being landed, the Scot and I took our way together, and left the furious churchman to vent his spleen by himself. We had not travelled long before we came to a po∣pulous village, where, from the various multitude, our eyes encountered at a distance, we might ea∣sily conjecture that something more than ordinary had gathered them together in that manner; it re∣sembled (as near as I can describe it) that famous place called Sherrick-fair, or a Staffordshire-Wake. While we were applying our admiration that way, we arrived at a small hut erected for that pur∣pose, where Nero the tyrant, like a blind fidler, was surrounded by a confused tribe of all sorts and sexes, like another Orpheus among the beasts.</P>
<P>The various remarks I made (some dancing, some prancing; some clapping, some knapping; some drinking, some winking; some kissing, some pissing; some reeling, some stealing) urged my curiosity to enquire for what it was possible those
<PB N="214" REF="217"/>
noble sports might be ordained, and was soon sa∣tisfied it was the Anniversary Feast of their Great Lady Proserpine's birth-day. But these things that I took to be diverting, so elevated the spleen of my Puritan companion, that he began loudly to exclaim agninst those prophane exercises: he said, they were impure, and lifted up the mind to lewd∣ness; that those that followed them, were the sons of Belial. and wore the mark of the beast in their foreheads. I endeavoured to pacify the sanc∣tified brother, by putting h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m in mind where we were, and that his rashness might draw us into danger, being in a strange place; but all was in vain, I but stirred up his fury more; for, turning his rebukes upon me, he told me, I was myself one of the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cked, and did rejoice in my heart at the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds of darkness: no, says he, I will not be pacified, I will roar aloud to drown their in∣cantations; yea, I will set out a throat even as the beast that belloweth! so that perceiving the mob gather about him, I thought it prudence to steal off, and leave him to the fury of those, whose dis∣pleasure he was about to incur.</P>
<P>I had not gone far, but I'spied two brawney champions at a rubbers of cuffs, which by the dexterity of their heads, hands, and heels, I judged could be no other than Englishmen: nor were my sentiments groundless, for presently I heard the mob cry out, O! rare Jo! O! rare Jo! and att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntively surveying the combatants, I found it to be the merry Jo Haynes, fallen out with Plowden the famous Lawyer, about a game at Nine-holes; and that shout had proclaimed Joe victorious. I was something scrupulous of renew∣ing my acquaintance, not knowing how the con∣queror, in the midst of his success, might use me for making bold with his character in my letters from the dead; though I felt a secret desire to dis∣cover myself, yet prudence withstood my inclina∣tion,
<PB N="215" REF="218"/>
'till a more convenient season might offer: so that I brushed off to a place where I saw a conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urse of the better sort of people; there I found Millington the famous Auctioneer, among a crowd of Lawyers, Physicians, Scholars, Poets, Critics, Booksellers, &amp;c. exercising his old faculty; for which, gentlemen, he is as particularly famed in these parts, as Herostratus for firing the famous Temple, or Barthol. Swarts, for the invention of Gunpowder. He is head journey-man to Ptolo∣my, who keeps a Bookseller's shop here, and rivals even Jacob Tonson in reputation among the great wits.</P>
<P>But most of all I was obliged to admire my friend Millington, who, by his powerful knack of eloquence, to the wonder of the whole company, sold Cave's Lives of the Fathers to Solomon the Magnificent, and the Scotch Directory to the Priests of the Sun; nay, he sold Archbishop Laud's Life to Hugh Peters, Hob's Leviathan to Pope Boniface, and pop'd Bunyan's Works upon Bellarmine for a piece of unrevealed Divinity. Af∣ter the sale was over, I took an opportunity of making myself known to him, who caressed me with all the freedom imaginable, asking me, how long I had been in these parts? and what news from the other world? and a thousand particular questions about his old friends; to all which I re∣sponded as well as I could: and having given me a caution to avoid some people, by whom I was threatened, for exposing them in my letters, we went to take a bottle together.—</P>
<P>Now I presume, gentlemen, you will conclude it high time for me to take my leave; nor shall I tire your patience much longer, only permit me to give ye the trouble of some particular services to those honest gentlemen whose generosity gave me the reputation of a funeral above what I e'er ex∣pected,

<HEAD>The Revd. Mr. JOHN POMFRET.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman's works are held in very great esteem by the common readers of poe∣try; it is thought as unfashionable amongst peo∣ple of inferior life, not to be possessed of the po∣ems of Pomfret, as amongst persons of taste not to have the works of Pope in their libraries. The subjects upon which Pomfret wrote were po∣pular, his versification is far from being unmusi∣cal, and as there is little force of thinking in his writings, they are level to the capacities of those who admire them.</P>
<P>Our author was son of the rev. Mr. Pomfret, rector of Luton in Bedfordshire, and he himself was preferred to the living of Malden in the same coun∣ty. He was liberally educated at an eminent grammar school in the country, from whence he was sent to the university of Cambridge, but to what college is not certain. There he wrote most of his poetical pieces, took the degree of master of arts, and very early accomplished him∣self in most kinds of polite literature. A gentle∣man who writes under the name of Philalethes, and who was an intimate friend of Pomfret's, has cleared his reputation from the charge of fanati∣cism, which some of his malicious enemies brought against him. It was shortly after his leaving the university, that he was preferred to the living of Malden abovementioned, and was, says that gen∣tleman,
<PB N="219" REF="222"/>
so far from being tinctured with fanati∣cism, that I have often heard him express his ab∣horrence of the destructive tenets maintained by that people, both against our religious and civil rights. This imputation it seems was cast on him by there having been one of his sur-name, though not any way related to him, a dissenting teacher, and who published some rhimes upon spiritual sub∣jects, as he called them, and which sufficiently proved him an enthusiast.</P>
<P>About the year 1703 Mr. Pomfret came up to London, for institution and induction, into a very considerable living, but was retarded for some time by a disgust taken by dr. Henry Compton, then bishop of London, at these four lines, in the close of his poem entitled The Choice.<Q><L>And as I near approach'd the verge of life,</L>
<L>Some kind relation (for I'd have no wife)</L>
<L>Should take upon him all my worldly care,</L>
<L>While I did for a better state prepare.</L></Q></P>
<P>The parenthesis in these verses was so malici∣ously represented to the bishop, that his lordship was given to understand, it could bear no other construction than that Mr. Pomfret preferred a mi∣stress before a wife; though the words may as well admit of another meaning, and import no more, than the preference of a single life to marriage; unless the gentlemen in orders will assert, that an unmarried Clergyman cannot live without a mistress. But the bishop was soon convinced that this asper∣sion against him, was no more than an effort of malice, as Mr. Pomfret at that time was really married. The opposition which his enemies made to him, had, in some measure, its effect; for by the obstructions he met with, he was obliged to stay longer in London than he intended, and as the Small-pox then raged in the metropolis, he sickened of
<PB N="220" REF="223"/>
them, and died in London in the 36th year of his age.</P>
<P>The above-mentioned friend of Mr. Pomfret, has likewise shewn the ungenerous treatment he met with in regard to his poetical compositions, in a book entitled Poems by the Earl of Roscom∣mon, and Mr. Duke, printed 1717, in the pre∣face to which, the publisher has peremptorily inserted the following paragraph. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'In this col∣lection, says he, of my lord Roscommon's poems, care has been taken to insert all I possibly could procure, that are truly genuine, there having been several things published under his name, which were written by others, the au∣thors of which I could set down if it were ma∣terial. 'Now, says the gentleman, this arrogant editor would have been more just, both to the publ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c, and to the earl of Roscommon's memory, in telling us what things had been published un∣der his lordship's name by others, than by con∣cealing the authors of any such gross impositi∣ons. Instead of which, he is so much a stran∣ger to impartiality, that he has been guilty of the very crime he exclaims against; for he has not only attributed the prospect of death to the earl of Roscommon, which was wrote by Mr. Pomsret, after the decease of that lord; but likewise another piece entitled the Prayer of Jeremy Paraphrased, prophetically representing the passionate grief of the Jewish people, for the loss of their town, and sanctuary, written by Mr. Southcot, a gentleman who published it in the year 1717, so that it is to be hoped, in a future edition of the earl of Roscommon's, and Mr. Duke's poems, the same care will be taken to do these gentlemen justice, as to prevent any other person from hereafter injuring the memory of his lordship.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Pomiret published his poems in the year 1699, to which he has prefixed a very modest and
<PB N="221" REF="224"/>
sensible preface, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I am not so fond of fame, says he, as to desire it from the injudicious many; nor as so mortisied a temper as not to wish it from the discerning few. 'Tis not the multi∣tude of applauders, but the good fame of the ap∣plauders, which establishes a valuable reputation.'</Q></P>
<P>His poetical compositions consist chiefly of<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Choice, which we shall insert as a speci∣men.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Cruelty and Lust, an Epistolary Essay, founded upon the famous Story which happened in the reign of King James II. Kirk, who was that Prince's general against the duke of Monmouth, was sollicited by a beautiful lady in behalf of her husband, who then lay under sentence of death. The inhuman general consented to grant his fair petitioner her request; but at no less a price than that of her innocence. The lady doat∣ed on her husband, and maintained a hard strug∣gle between virtue, and affection, the latter of which at last prevailed, and she yielded to his guilty em∣braces. The next morning Kirk, with unparal∣leled brutality, desired the lady to look out at the window of his bedchamber, when she was struck with the horrid sight of her husband upon a scaffold, ready to receive the blow of the executioner; and before she could reach the place where he was, in order to take a last embrace, her husband was no more.
<P>How far the lady may be justified in this con∣duct, is not our business to discuss: if it is called by the name of guilt, none ever had more pres∣sing motives; and if such a crime could admit of an excuse, it must be upon such an occasion.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="222" REF="225"/>
3. Several Epistles to his Friends under affliction,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Upon the Divine Attributes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. A Prospect of Death.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Upon the General Conflagration, and the ensu∣ing Judgment. There were two pieces of our au∣thor's, published after his death by his friend Phi∣lalethes; the first of these entitled Reason, was wrote by him in the year 1700, when the debates concerning the doctrine of the Trinity were carried on with so much heat by the Clergy one against another, that the royal authority was interposed in order to put an end to a controversy, which could never be settled, and which was pernicious in its consequences. This is a severe satire, upon one of the parties engaged in that dispute, but his not inserting it amongst his other poems when he collected them into a volume, was, on ac∣count of his having received very particular fa∣vours, from some of the persons therein men∣tioned. The other is entitled Dies Novissima, or the Last Epiphany, a Pindaric Ode on Christ's second Appearance to judge the World. In this piece the poet expresses much heart-felt piety: It is animated, if not with a poetical, at least with so devout a warmth, that as the Guardian has observ∣ed of Divine Poetry, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'We shall find a kind of re∣fuge in our pleasure, and our diversion will be∣come our safety.'</Q></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This is all the account we are favoured with of the life and writings of Mr. Pomfret: A man not destitute either of erudition or genius, of un∣exceptionable morals, though exposed to the ma∣lice of antagonists. As he was a prudent man, and educated to a profession, he was not subject to
<PB N="223" REF="226"/>
the usual necessities of the poets, but his sphere be∣ing somewhat obscure, and his life unactive, there are few incidents recorded concerning him. If he had not fortune sufficient to render him conspicu∣ous, he had enough to keep his life innocent, which he seems to have spent in ease and tranquil∣lity, a situation much more to be envied than the highest blaze of fame, attended with racking cares, and innumerable sollicitudes.</P>

<LG>
<L>IF Heav'n the grateful liberty would give,</L>
<L>That I might chuse my method how to live,</L>
<L>And all those hours propitious fate should lend,</L>
<L>In blissful ease and satisfaction spend,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Near some fair town I'd have a private seat,</L>
<L>Built uniform; not little, nor too great:</L>
<L>Better if on a rising ground it stood</L>
<L>On this side fields, on that a neighb'ring wood.</L>
<L>It should within no other things contain,</L>
<L>But what were useful, necessary, plain:</L>
<L>Methinks 'tis nauseous, and I'd ne'r endure</L>
<L>The needless pomp of gawdy furniture.</L>
<L>A little garden, grateful to the eye,</L>
<L>And a cool rivulet run murm'ring by:</L>
<L>On whose delicious banks a stately row</L>
<L>Of shady Lymes or Sycamores should grow.</L>
<L>At th' end of which a silent study plac'd,</L>
<L>Should be with all the noblest authors grac'd.</L>
<L>Horace and Virgil, in whose mighty lines</L>
<L>Immortal wit and solid learning shines.</L>
<L>Sharp Juvenal, and am'rous Ovid too,</L>
<L>Who all the turns of love's soft passion knew:</L>
<L>He that with judgment reads his charming lines,</L>
<L>In which strong art with stronger nature joins,</L>
<L>Must grant his fancy, does the best excel;</L>
<L>His thoughts so tender, and express'd so well.</L>
<L><PB N="224" REF="227"/>
With all those moderns, men of steady sense,</L>
<L>Esteem'd for learning, and for eloquence.</L>
<L>In some of these, as fancy should advise.</L>
<L>I'd always take my morning exercise:</L>
<L>For sure no minutes bring us more content,</L>
<L>Than those in pleasing, useful studies spent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I'd have a clear, and competent estate,</L>
<L>That I might live genteely, but not great:</L>
<L>As much as I could moderately spend,</L>
<L>A little more, sometimes t' oblige a friend.</L>
<L>Nor should the sons of poverty repine</L>
<L>Too much at fortune, they should taste of mine;</L>
<L>And all that objects of true pity were</L>
<L>Should be reliev'd with what my wants could spare:</L>
<L>For that, our Maker has too largely giv'n,</L>
<L>Should be return'd, in gratitude to Heav'n.</L>
<L>A frugal plenty should my table spread;</L>
<L>With healthy, not luxurious, dishes fed:</L>
<L>Enough to satisfy, and something more</L>
<L>To feed the stranger, and the neighb'ring poor:</L>
<L>Strong meat indulges vice, and pamp'ring food</L>
<L>Creates diseases, and inflames the blood.</L>
<L>But what's sufficient to make nature strong,</L>
<L>And the bright lamp of life continue long,</L>
<L>I'd freely take, and, as I did possess,</L>
<L>The bounteous author of my plenty bless.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I'd have a little vault, but always stor'd</L>
<L>With the best wines each vintage could afford.</L>
<L>Wine whets the wit, improves its native force,</L>
<L>And gives a pleasant flavour to discourse:</L>
<L>By making all our spirits debonair,</L>
<L>Throws off the lees, the sediment of care,</L>
<L>But as the greatest blessing Heav'n lends,</L>
<L>May be debauch'd and serve ignoble ends:</L>
<L>So, but too oft, the Grape's refreshing juice</L>
<L>Does many mischievous effects produce.</L>
<L><PB N="225" REF="228"/>
My house should no such rude disorders know,</L>
<L>As from high drinking consequently flow:</L>
<L>Nor would I use what was so kindly giv'n</L>
<L>To the dishonour of indulgent Heav'n.</L>
<L>If any neighbour came, he should be free,</L>
<L>Us'd with respect, and not uneasy be,</L>
<L>In my retreat, or to himself or me.</L>
<L>What freedom, prudence, and right reason give,</L>
<L>All men may with impunity receive:</L>
<L>But the least swerving from their rule's too much:</L>
<L>For what's forbidden us, 'tis death to touch.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That life might be more comfortable yet,</L>
<L>And all my joys refin'd, sincere, and great;</L>
<L>I'd chuse two friends, whose company would be</L>
<L>A great advance to my felicity.</L>
<L>Well born, of humour suited to my own;</L>
<L>Discreet, and men, as well as books, have known.</L>
<L>Brave, gen'rous, witty, and exactly free</L>

<HEAD>Dr. WILLIAM KING.</HEAD>
<P>THIS ingenious gentleman, was son of Ezekiel King, of London. He received the rudiments of his education in Westmin∣ster-school, under Dr. Bushy, and was removed from thence to Christ's-Church in Oxford, in Michaelmas term, 1681, when at the age of eigh∣teen. He studied the civil law, and practised it at Doctor's-Commons, with very great reputation; but the natural gaiety of his temper, and the love of company, betrayed him into those pleasures, which were incompatible with his profession.</P>
<P>Our author, by the reputation of his abilities obtained a patron in the earl of Pembroke, who upon his being appointed lord Lieutenant of Ireland, press'd him to go over to that kingdom.</P>
<P>Upon Dr. King's arrival in Ireland, his excel∣lency appointed him judge advocate, sole commis∣sioner of the prizes, and record keeper. There, he was well received, and countenanced by persons of the most distinguished rank, and could he have changed his disposition with the climate, had then an opportunity of making his fortune; but so far was he from improving this occasion to the purposes of his interest, that he returned back to England, with no other treasure, than a few merry Poems, and humorous Essays. He was naturally of a cour∣teous behaviour, and very obliging: His conversa∣tion was chearful, and his wit pleasant and enter∣taining. But at length he chiefly subsisted on his fellowship in Christ's Church College: Before this
<PB N="229" REF="232"/>
time, he had published his most ingenious Poem, called the Art of Cookery, in imitation of Horace's Art of Poetry, with some Letters to Dr. Lister and others; occasioned principally by the title of a book, published by the Dr. being the works of Apicius Coelius, concerning the soups and sauces of the ancients, with an extract of the greatest curi∣osities contained in that book. Amongst his Letters, is one upon the Denti Scalps, or Tooth-picks of the Antients: Another contains an imitation of Horace: Epist. 5. Book I. being his invitation of Torquatus to supper. And a third, contains re∣marks on lord Grimston's play, called the Lawyer's Fortune; or Love in a Hollow-Tree.</P>
<P>At his leisure hours he wrote likewise, The Art of Love, an imitation of Ovid, De Arte Amandi. To which he prefixed an account of Ovid. In the latter part of his life, about the year 1711, he pub∣lished an Historical Account of the Heathen Gods and Heroes, for the use of Westminster, and other schools; for the better and more easy understanding of the Classics. Besides these performances, we likewise find three numbers of a project, entitled, the Transactioner, or, Useful Transactions: Con∣taining a great number of small pieces, which it would be tedious here to enumerate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The design of this work, was to ridicule Sir Hans Sloan's writings, in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal-Society; of which Dr. Sloan was secretary. This work, of Dr. King's, which is now become very scarce, is one of the severest and merriest Satires that ever was written in Prose.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We have already observed, that our author while in Ireland, neglected the best opportunity of en∣creasing his fortune; and the circumstance which occasioned it we find to be this: He had contracted an intimacy which soon grew into friendship, with judge Upton, a man of the same temper with himself, who delighted in retirement and poetical amusement. He had a country villa
<PB N="230" REF="233"/>
called Mountown, near Dublin, where he and Dr. King used to retire, and spend most of their time without any regard to their public offices; and by these means neglecting to pay court to the lord lieutenant, they fell under his displeasure. These two poetical companions, indulged no other thoughts but those of living and dying in their rural retreat. Upon this occasion, Dr. King wrote a Pastoral Poem, called Mully of Mountown: Mully was the name of a Red-Cow which gave him milk, whom he made the chief subject of his Poem; which at that time the critics would have imposed upon the wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d as a political allegory, tho' this was a manner of writing, with which the Dr. was totally unac∣quainted.</P>
<P>When Dr. King, after his return from Ireland, had retired to live upon his fellowship at Oxford, he was sollicited by the earl of Anglesey to come to town, and undertake a cause of his, then before the House of Lords, (in relation to some cruelties he was accused of using to his lady) back'd by the violent prosecution of his mother-in-law, the coun∣tess of Dorchester. Upon this occasion the Doctor shook off the indolence of his nature, and so strenu∣ously engaged in the cause of his patron, that he gained the reputation of an able lawyer as well as a poet. He naturally hated business, especially that of an advocate; but when appointed as a delegate, made a very discerning and able judge, yet never could bear the fatigue of wrangling. His chief pleasure consisted in trifles, and he was never happier, than when hid from the world. Few people pleased him in conversation, and it was a proof of his liking them, if his behaviour was tolerably agreeable. He was a great dissembler of his natural temper, which was sullen, morose, and peevish, where he durst shew it; but he was of a timorous disposition, and the least slight or neglect offered to him, would throw him into a melancholy despondency. He
<PB N="231" REF="234"/>
was apt to say a great many ill-natur'd things, but was never known to do one: He was made up of tenderness, pity, and compassion; and of so femi∣nine a disposition, that tears would fall from his eyes upon the smallest occasion.</P>
<P>As his education had been strict, so he was always of a religious disposition, and would not enter upon the business of the day, till he had performed his devotion, and read several portions of scripture out of the Psalms, the Prophets, and the New-Testament.</P>
<P>It appears from his loose papers, which he calls Adversaria, that he had been such an assiduous stu∣dent, that before he was eight-years in the university, he had read over and made reflections on twenty∣two thousand books and manuscripts; a few of which we shall give as specimen, in order to let the rea∣der into the humour and taste of our author.<Q><P>'Diogenes Laertius, Book I.—Thales, being asked how a man might most easily brook misfor∣tunes? answered, if he saw his enemies in a worse condition. It is not agreed, concerning the wise∣men; or whether indeed they were seven.'</P>
<P>'There is a very good letter of Pisistratus to Solon, and of the same stile and character with those of Phalaris.'</P>
<P>'Solon ordained, that the guardians of orphans should not cohabit with their mothers: And that no person should be a guardian to those, whose estate descended to them at the orphan's decease. That no seal-graver should keep the seal of a ring that was sold: That, if any man put out the eye of him who had but one, he should lose both his own: That, where a man never planted, it should be death to take away: That, it should be death for a ma∣gistrate to be taken in drink.'</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="235"/>
'Solon's letters at the end of his life, in Laertius, give us a truer Idea of the man, than all he has written before, and are indeed very fine: Solon's to Craesus are very genteel; and Pitaccus's on the other side, are rude and philosophical: However, both shew Craesus to have been a very good man. These epistles give a further reason to believe, that the others were written by Phalaris. There is a letter from Cleobulus to Solon, to invite him to Lindus.'</P>
<P>'Bion used to say, it was more easy to determine differences, between enemies than friends; for that of two friends, one would become an enemy; but of two enemies, one would become a friend.'</P>
<P>'Anacharsis has an epistle to Craesus, to thank him for his invitation; and Periander one to all the wifemen, to invite them to Corinth to him, after their return from Lydia. Epimenides has an epistle to Solon, to invite him to Crete, under the tyranny of Pisistratus.'</P><P>'Epimenides often pretended that he rose from death to life.'</P></Q></P>
<P>The above notes are sufficient to shew that he read the ancients with attention, and knew how to select the most curious passages, and most deserving the reader's observation.</P>
<P>About the year 1711 the Dr. published a piece called the British Palladium, or a welcome of lord Bolingbroke from France. Soon after this, Dr. Swift, Dr. Friend, Mr. Prior, with some others of lord Bolingbroke's adherents, paid a visit to Dr. King, and brought along with them, the key of the Gazetteer's office, together with another key for the use of the paper office. The day following
<PB N="233" REF="236"/>
this friendly visit, the Dr. entered upon his new post; and two or three days after waited on his benefactor lord Bolingbrooke, then secretary of state.</P>
<P>The author of the Doctor's life, published by Curl, has related an instance of inhumanity in alder∣man Barber, towards Dr. King. This magistrate was then printer of the Gazette, and was so cruel as to oblige the Dr. to sit up till three or four o'clock in the morning, upon those days the Gazette was published, to correct the errors of the press; which was not the business of the author, but a corrector, who is kept for that purpose in every printing-office of any consequence. This slavery the Dr. was not able to bear, and therefore quitted the office. The alderman's severity was the more unwarrantable, as the Dr. had been very kind in obliging him, by writing Examiners, and some other papers, gratis, which were of advantage to him as a printer. Those writings at that juncture made him known to the ministry, who afterwards employed him in a state paper called the Gazettee.</P>
<P>About Midsummer 1712 the Dr. quitted his em∣ploy, and retired to a gentleman's house on Lambeth side the water; where he had diverted himself a summer or two before: Here he enjoyed his lov'd tranquility, with a friend, a bottle, and his books; he frequently visited lord Clarendon, at Somerset-house, as long as he was able. It was the autumn season, and the Dr. began insensibly to droop: He shut himself up entirely from his nearest friends, and would not so much as see lord Clarendon; who hearing of his weak condition, ordered his sister to go to Lambeth, and fetch him from thence to a lodging he had provided for him, in the Strand, over against Somerset-house where next day about noon he expired, with all the pati∣ence, and resignation of a philosopher, and the true devotion of a christian; but would not be persuaded
<PB N="234" REF="237"/>
to go to rest the night before, till he made such a will, as he thought would be agreeable to lord Clarendon's inclinations; who after his death took care of his funeral. He was decently interred in the cloisters of Westminster-Abbey, next to his master Dr. Knipe, to whom a little before, he de∣dicated his Heathen Gods.—The gentleman al∣ready mentioned, who has transmitted some account of our author to posterity, delineates his character in the following manner. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'He was a civilian, exqui∣sitely well read; a skillful judge, and among the learned, an universal scholar, a critic, and an adept; in all sciences and languages expert; and ourEnglish Ovid, among the poets: In conversation, he was grave and entertaining, without levity or spleen: As an author, his character may be also summ'd up in the following lines.'<Q><L>Read here, in softest sounds the sweetest satire,</L>

<HEAD>THOMAS SPRAT (Bishop of RO∣CHESTER)</HEAD>
<P>WAS descended from a very worthy, though obscure family, being the son of a private country minister; but his great merit raised him to that eminent station in the church, wherein he long presided, and was deservedly accounted one of the most considerable of his time. The Oxford antiquary informs us, that on the 16th of January 1654, he was entered in Wadham-College, where he pursued his studies with the closest application, and distinguished himself by his prudent and courte∣ous behaviour.</P>
<P>On the 3d of July 1669, Mr. Sprat took his master of arts degree, and the same day, commenced doctor in divinity. He had not long been in holy orders, till he was introduced at court, and by a happy power in conversation, so attracted the re∣gard of Charles the IId. that he was considered as a man standing fair for preferment. In 1683, broke out the Rye-house Plot, a relation of the particulars of which, Charles the IId. commanded Dr. Sprat to draw up. This the Dr. in a letter to lord Dorset, informs us, he did with great unwillingness, and would have been impelled by no other considera∣tion, that that of a royal command. The reason he executed these orders with so much reluctance, was, because many of the most popular men in the nation were either concerned themselves, or had some relations engaged, so that an account of a plot thus
<PB N="237" REF="240"/>
supported, must expose he writer to partial or popular resentments.</P>
<P>He requested the king, that he might be permit∣ted to spare some names, and to represent the be∣haviour of others in as candid a light as possible, in which request his majesty indulged him; but not∣withstanding all the candour he observed, and the most dispassionate representation of facts, yet his composing this relation, was brought against him as a crime, for which an opposite party endeavoured, and had almost effected his ruin. This work, tho' finished in the year 1683 was not published till 1685, when it came into the world, under the im∣mediate direction of king James the IId. It was no doubt in consequence of this court service, that he was made dean of Westminster, Anno 1683; and bishop of Rochester the year following. Another step he took in the short reign of king James, like∣wise exposed him to the resentment of that power which took place at the revolution, which was his sitting in the ecclesiastical commission. By this he drew upon himself almost an universal censure, which he acknowledges to be just; as appears by a letter he wrote upon that occasion to the earl of Dorset, in the year 1689; which thus begins.<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>'My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I think I should be wanting to myself at this time, in my own necessary vindication, should I forbear any longer to give my friends a true ac∣count of my behaviour in the late ecclesiastical commission. Though I profess what I now say, I only intend as a reasonable mitigation of the offence I have given, not entirely to justify my sitting in that court; for which I acknowledge I have deservedly incurred the censure of many good men; and I wish I may ever be able to make a sufficient amends to my country for it.'</Q></P>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="241"/>
His crime in this particular was somewhat alle∣viated, by his renouncing the commission, when he perceived the illegal practices they were going to put in execution. His offences were streunously urged against him, and had not the earl of Dorset warmly espoused his interest, he had probably been stript of his ecclesiastical preferments. His lord∣ship charged the ill-conduct of both these affairs upon king James and his ministry; and thereby brought the bishop's opponents to a perfect reconci∣liation with him.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this accommodation, such was the inquietude of the times, that his lordship had not long enjoyed this tranquility, before there was hatched a most villainous contrivance; not only to take away his life, but, the lives of archbishop Sancroft, lord Marlborough, and several other persons of honour and distinction; by forging an instrument under their hands, setting forth, that they had an intent to restore king James, and to seize upon the person of the princess of Orange, dead or alive; to surprize the tower, to raise a mighty army; and to bring the city of London into subjection. This black conspiracy to murther so many innocent persons, was by the providence of God soon detected; and his lordship drew up, and published an account of it, under this title, A Rela∣tion of the Wicked Contrivance of Stephen Black∣head, and Robert Young, against the Lives of se∣veral Persons, by forging an Association under their Hands. In two parts. The first being a Relation of what passed at the three Examinations of his Lordship, by a Committee of Lords of the Privy-Council. The second, being an Account of the two Authors of the Forgery; printed in quarto, in the year 1692.</P>
<P>His lordship was honourably acquitted; and he ever after looked upon this escape, as one of the most remarkable blessings of his life. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'In such
<PB N="239" REF="242"/>
critical times (says he) how little evidence would have sufficed to ruin any man, that had been ac∣cused with the least probability of truth? I do therefore, most solemnly oblige myself, and all mine, to keep the grateful remembrance of my deliverance, perpetual and sacred.'</Q></P>
<P>Hitherto, we have considered Dr. Sprat in his episcopal, and public character; in which if he fell into some errors, he has a right to our candour, as they seem rather to have proceeded from misinfor∣mation, and excess of good-nature, than any male∣volent, or selfish principle: We shall now take a view of him as an author.</P>
<P>His first appearance in that sphere, was in the year 1659, when in concert with Mr. Waller, and Mr. Dryden, he printed a Pindarique Ode, to the Memory of the most renowned Prince, Oliver, Lord Protector, &amp;c. printed in quarto, which he dedica∣ted to the reverend Mr. Wilkin's, then warden of Wadham-College; by whose approbation and re∣quest, it was made public, as the author designed it only for a private amusement. This was an unfa∣vourable circumstance for our author, as it more particularly shews the fickleness of his disposition in state-matters, and gave him less credit with those parties he afterwards espoused.</P>
<P>His next production in poetry, was an Ode on the Plague of Athens; which happened in the second year of the Pelopponesian war, first described by Thucydides, afterwards by Lucretius: This Mr. Sprat dedicated to his worthy and learned friend, Dr. Walter Pope. The performance stood the test of the severest critics; and in the opinion of the best judges, the manner of his great original was judi∣ciously imitated. Soon after this, he proceeded to give the public a specimen of his abilities in another kind, and succeeded with the greatest applause; which was his Observations on Monsieur de Serbiere's
<PB N="240" REF="243"/>
Voyage into England, written to Dr. Wren, pro∣fessor of astronomy in Oxford; printed in octavo, in the year 1665.</P>
<P>Mr. Sprat in the beginning of his letter acquaints the Dr. with the motives of his engaging with Monsieur Serbiere, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Having now (says he) under my hands, the history of the Royal-Society, it will be in vain for me to try to represent its design to be advantageous to the glory of England, if my countrymen shall know, that one who calls himself a member of that society, has escaped un∣answered in the public disgraces, which he has cast on our whole nation.'</Q>—In this performance Mr. Sprat has given an undeniable proof, that the strength and solidity of an English pen, is infinitely superior to the gallant air of a French author, who is sprightly without propriety, and positive without truth.</P>
<P>About two years after, 1667, our author pub∣lished his incomparable History of the Royal Society of London, for the improvement of natural knowledge; a work which has acquired him very great reputation, and has ranked him with the most elegant and polite writers of that age. Soon after this, Mr. Sprat lost his amiable and much esteemed friend Mr. Abraham Cowley, who by his will recommended to the care of his reverend friend, the revising of all his works that were printed, and the collecting of those papers which he had designed for the press. This trust Mr. Sprat faithfully dis∣charged, and to the new edition of Mr. Cowley's Works, he prefixed an account of his life and writ∣ings, addressed to Mr. Martin Clifford. Happy is it for a good man, when he has such a friend to close his eyes: This is a desire peculiar to all, and the portion of few to enjoy.<Q><PB N="241" REF="244"/><LG>

<P>This life of Cowley, by Dr. Sprat has been esteemed one of the most elegant compositions in our language; there are several extracts from it in our account of the life of that amiable Poet.</P>
<P>These are the most material performances of Dr. Sprat: a man, who was early introduced into an elevated station in life, which he held not without enemies to his dying moments. Villiers duke of Buckingham was his first patron, who notwithstand∣ing his fickleness, and inconsistent levity, never for∣sook him; a circumstance which has induced many to believe, that that nobleman owed much to the refinement of our author; and that his Rehearsal had never been so excellent, nor so pungent a satire, had it not first passed under Dr. Sprat's perusal.</P>
<P>This learned prelate died of an apoplexy, May the 20th, 1713, at his episcopal seat in Bromly in Kent, in the 79th year of his age; and was interred in the Abbey-Church of Westminster.</P>

As he may be proposed (considered meerly as a writer) for an ex∣ample worthy of imitation; so in the character of a dignified clergyman, he has likewise a claim to be copied in those retired and private virtues, in those acts of beneficence and humility, and that unaffected and primitive piety, for which he was justly distinguished.</P>

<HEAD>CHARLES MONTAGUE (Earl of HALLIFAX)</HEAD>
<P>WAS born the 16th of April 1661, and re∣ceived the rudiments of his education at Westminster-school: From thence he was removed to Trinity-College in Cambridge, where by the bright∣ness of his parts he was early distinguished; and coming to town soon after the death of king Charles the IId. he contracted an intimacy with the earl of Dorset, Sir Charles Sedley, and other wits of the age. After the accession of king William and queen Mary, having attached himself to the revolu∣tion interest, he was sworn one of the council: He served in parliament for the cities of Durham, and Westminster, at different times, and distinguished himself by his speeches in the House of Commons, on several important affairs. He was constituted one of the lords commissioners of the treasury, on the 21st of March 1691, and soon after sworn of the privy-council. In 1694 he was made chancellor and under treasurer of the exchequer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collins's Peerage. See Article Hallifax.</NOTE>. In the year 1695, when the nation was distress'd, by the ill-state of the current coin of this kingdom, he pro∣jected the new coining of the silver money; and by his great prudence, and indefatigable industry brought it to bear. He likewise proposed the issuing exchequer bills, to supply the great scarcity of mo∣ney, which has since been made use of to the great benefit of the nation. On the 16th of February, 1697-8, the House of Commons, came to a resolu∣tion,
<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><PB N="244" REF="247"/>
'That it is the opinion of this house, that the honourable Charles Montague, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> chancellor of the exchequer, for his good services to this go∣vernment, does deserve his majesty's favour.'</Q> His next concern, was the trade to the East-Indies; the settlement of which had been long depending, and was looked on as so nice, and difficult, that it had been referred to the king and council, and from them to the parliament; who on May the 26th, 1698, ordered a bill for settling the trade to that place: Mr. Montague transacted this whole affair; and by his industry and skill, in touching the affections of the people, raised two millions, by only doubling the duties on pa∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, parchment, and salt; which to have done b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any other means, was at that time mat∣ter of the utmost difficulty. These proofs of af∣fection and zeal to his majesty's person and go∣vernment, induced the king to declare him first lord commissioner of the treasury; and on the 10th of July, 1698, appointed him one of the persons to whose fidelity, and honour, he reposed the trust of lords justices of England, for the administration of government during his absence. In the year 1700 his lordship resigned the place of first lord commissioner of the treasury, having obtained a grant of the office of auditor of the receipts of the exchequer, vacant by the death of Sir Robert Howard; and on the 4th of December, the same year, was advanced to the dignity of baron Hallifax, in the county of York.</P>
<P>On the accession of queen Anne, he was con∣cerned in vindicating the memory of king William, and on all occasions shewed a disinterested zeal in the service of his country. He first projected the equivalent, which was given to the Scots, in or∣der to promote the Union between the nations; and without which it had never been effected. And as his lordship first moved for appointing
<PB N="245" REF="248"/>
commissioners to treat of an Union between the two kingdoms; so he had not only a great share in that treaty, as one of the commissioners, but causing it to be ratified in parliament, and answered, with all the force of which he was master, the various objections made against it. And further, to strengthen the interest of the Whigs, which he thought was essentially connected with the pro∣testant religion, his lordship proposed the bill for the naturalization of the illustrious house of Hanover, and for the better security of the suc∣cession of the crown in the protestant line; which being pass'd into an act, her majesty made choice of him to carry the news to our late sovereign; and to invest his son with the ensigns of the most noble order of the Garter. On his arrival at Hanover, he was received with extraordina∣ry marks of distinction, and honour. During his re∣sidence there, the prince-royal of Prussia was mar∣ried to his present majesty's sister; and soon after that prince set out with his lordship for the con∣federate army. Hallifax then went to the Hague, where he laid the foundation of a stricter alliance between Great-Britain, and the United Provinces: On his return to England he was graciously re∣ceived by the queen, and continued in her favour till the change of the ministry, in the year 1710.</P>
<P>On her majesty's death, our author was one of the regency nominated by king George the 1st. till his arrival; who was no sooner possessed of the crown, but he shewed him distinguising marks of his favour, having so strenuously promoted his suc∣cession to the British throne. He had his majesty's leave to resign his post of auditor of the exchequer, to his nephew the honourable George Montague; and after being made first lord commissioner of the treasury, and sworn of the privy-council, he was advanced to the dignity of earl of Hallifax, and
<PB N="246" REF="249"/>
viscount Sunbury, by letters patent, bearing date the 26th of October, 1714; and before the end of that year, was installed one of the knights compa∣nions of the most noble order of the garter, and made lord lieutenant of the county of Surry.</P>
<P>Lord Hallifax died in the 54th year of his age, on the 19th of May 1715, and on the 26th of the same month, was interred in general Monk's vault in Westminster-Abbey: leaving no issue, his titles devolved on his nephew, George late earl of Hallifax.—Considered as a poet, his lordship makes a less considerable figure than the earl of Dorset; there is a languor in his verses, which seems to indicate that he was not born with a po∣etical genius. That he was a lover of the muses, there is not the least doubt, as we find him patro∣nising the poets so warmly; but there is some dif∣ference between a propensity to poetry, and a pow∣er of excelling in it. His lordship has writ but few things, and those not of the utmost consequence.</P>
<P>Among others are the following, printed in Ton∣son's Minor Poets.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Verses On the death of Charles the IId.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. An Ode on the Marriage of the Princess Anne, and Prince George of Denmark.</ITEM>

<HEAD>WILLIAM WYCHERLEY, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman was son of Daniel Wycherley, of Cleve in Shropshire, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and was born (says Wood) in the year 1640.</P>
<P>When he was about fifteen years of age, he was sent to France, in the western parts of which he resided upon the banks of the Charante; where he was often admitted to the conversation of the most accomplished ladies of the court of France, parti∣cularly madam de Montausieur, celebrated by mons. Voiture in his letters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dennis's Letters, vol. i. p. 213.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A little before the restoration of Charles the IId, he became a gentleman commoner of queen's col∣lege in Oxford, and lived in the provost's lodgings; and was entered in the public library, under the title of philosophiae studiosus, in July 1660. He quitted the university without being matriculated, having, according to the Oxford antiquary, been re∣conciled to the protestant religion, which he had renounced during his travels, probably by the per∣swas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of those gay ladies, with whom he conversed in France. This circumstance shews how dangerous it is to engage in a debate with a female antago∣nist, especially, if that antagonist joins beauty with understanding.</P>
<P>Mr. Wycherley afterwards entered himself in the Middle-Temple; but making his first appearance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n town, in a reign when wit and gaiety were the fa∣vourite
<PB N="249" REF="252"/>
distinctions, he relinguished the study of the law, and engaged in pursuits more agreeable to his own genius, and the gallant spirit of the times.</P>
<P>Upon writing his first Play, entitled Love in a Wood, or St. James's Park; and acted at the Theatre-royal, in 1672, he became acquainted with several of the most celebrated wits, both of the court and town; and likewise with the duchess of Cleveland. Mr. Dennis, in his Letters quoted above, has given a particular relation of the begin∣ning of his acquaintance with this celebrated beauty of the times, which is singular enough.—One day Mr. Wycherley riding in his chariot through St. James's Park, he was met by the duchess, whose chariot jostled with his, upon which she looked out of her chariot, and spoke very audibly, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You Wycherley, you are a son of a whore,"</Q> and then burst into a fit of laughter. Mr. Wycherley at first was very much surprized at this, but he soon re∣covered himself enough to recollect, that it was spoke in allusion to the latter end of a Song in his Love in a Wood;<Q><L>When parents are slaves,</L>
<L>Their brats cannot be any other;</L>
<L>Great wits, and great braves,</L>
<L>Have always a punk for their mother.</L></Q></P>
<P>During Mr. Wycherley's surprize, the chariots drove different ways, they were soon at a consider∣able distance from each other; when Mr. Wycherley recollecting, ordered his coachman to drive back, and overtake the lady. As soon as he got over a∣gainst her, he said to her, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Madam, you was pleased to bestow a title upon me, which generally be∣longs to the fortunate. Will your ladyship be at the play to night? Well, she replied, what if I should be there? Why then, answered he, I will be there to wait on your ladyship, though I dis∣appoint
<PB N="250" REF="253"/>
a fine woman, who has made me an as∣signation. So, said she, you are sure to disappoint a woman who has favoured you, for one who has not. Yes, he replied, if she who has not favour∣ed me is the finer woman of the two: Put he who will be constant to your ladyship, till he can find a finer woman, is sure to die your captive."</Q></P>
<P>The duchess of Cleveland, in consequence of Mr. Wycher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey's compliment, was that night, in the first row of the king's box in Drury-Lane, and Mr. Wycherley in the pit under her, where he enter∣tained her during the whole play; and this was the beginning of a correspondence between these two persons, which afterwards made a great noise in the town.</P>
<P>This accident, was the occasion of bringing Mr. Wycherley into favour with George duke of Buck∣ingham, who was passionately in love with that lady, but was ill-treated by her, and who believed that Mr. Wycherley was his happy rival. The duke had long sollicited her, without obtaining any favour: Whether the relation between them shocked her, for she was his cousin-german; or, whether she apprehended that an intrigue with a person of his rank and character, must necessarily in a short time come to the king's ears; whatever was the cause, she refused so long to admit his visits, that at last indignation, rage, and disdain took place of love; and he resolved to ruin her. When he took this resolution, he had her so narrowly watched by his spies, that he soon discovered those whom he had reason to believe were his rivals; and after he knew them, he never failed to name them aloud, in order to expose the lady to all those who visited her; and among others, he never failed to mention Mr. Wycherley. As soon as it came to the know∣ledge of the latter, who had all his expectations from court, he apprehended the consequences of
<PB N="251" REF="254"/>
such a report, if it should reach the King; and applied himself therefore to Wilmot earl of Roches∣ter, and Sir Charles Sedley, entreating them to remonstrate to the duke of Buckingham, the mis∣chief he was about to do to one who had not the honour to know him, and who had not offended him. Upon opening the matter to the duke, he cried out immediately, that he did not blame Wycherley, he only accused his cousin. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ay, but they replied, by rendering him suspected of such an intrigue, you are about to ruin him; that is, your grace is about to ruin a man, whose conversation you would be pleased with above all things.'</Q></P>
<P>Upon this occasion, they said so much of the shining qualities of Mr. Wycherley, and the charms of his conversation, that the duke, who was as much in love with wit, as he was with his cousin, was impatient, till he was brought to sup with him, which was in two or three nights. After supper, Mr. Wycherley, who was then in the height of his vigour, both in body and mind, thought himself o∣bliged to exert his talents, and the duke was charmed to that degree, that he cried out with transport, and with an oath, <Q REND="inline">'My cousin's in the right of it,'</Q> and from that very moment made a friend of a man he before thought his rival.</P>
<P>In the year 1673 a comedy of his called the Gentleman Dancing-Master, was acted at the duke's Theatre, and in 1678 his Plain Dealer was acted with general applause. In 1683 his Country Wife was performed at the same Theatre. These Plays raised him so high in the esteem of the world, and so recommended him to the favour of the duke of Buckingham, that as he was master of the horse, and colonel of a regiment, he bestowed two places on Wycherley: As master of the horse, he made him one of his equeries; and as colonel of a regi∣ment,
<PB N="252" REF="255"/>
a captain lieutenant of his own company. King Charles likewise gave our author the most distinguishing marks of favour, perhaps beyond what any sovereign prince had shewn before to an author, who was only a private gentleman: Mr. Wycherley happened to be ill of a fever, at his lodgings in Bow-Street, Covent-Garden; during his sick∣ness, the king did him the honour of a visit; when finding his fever indeed abated, but his body ex∣tremely weakened, and his spirits miserably shatter∣ed, he commanded him to take a journey to the south of France, believing that nothing could con∣tribute more to the restoring his former state of health, than the gentle air of Montpelier, during the winter season: at the same time, the king assur∣ed him, that as soon as he was able to undertake that journey, he would order five-hundred pounds to be paid him, to defray the expences of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Wycherley accordingly went to France, and returned to England the latter end of the spring fol∣lowing, with his h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alth entirely restored. The king received him with the utmost marks of esteem, and shortly after told him, he had a son, whom he re∣solved should be educated like the son of a king, and that he could make choice of no man so proper to be his g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vernor as Mr. Wycherley; and, that for this service, he should have fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teen-hundred pounds a year allotted him; the King also added, that when the time came, that his office should cease, he would take care to make such a provision for him, as should set him above the malice of the world and fortune. These were golden prospects for Mr. Wycherley, but they were soon by a cross accident dashed to pieces.</P>
<P>Soon after this promise of his majesty's, Mr. Dennis tells us that Mr. Wycherley went down to Tunbridge, to take either the benefit of the waters, or the diversions of the place; when walking one day upon the wells-walk, with his friend Mr. Fair∣beard
<PB N="253" REF="256"/>
of Grey's-Inn, just as he came up to the bookseller's, the countess of Drogheda, a young widow, rich, noble and beautiful, came to the bookseller, and enquired for the Plain Dealer. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Madam, says Mr. Fairbeard, since you are for the Plain Dealer, there he is for you,'</Q> pushing Mr. Wycherley towards her. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Yes, says Mr. Wycherley, this lady can bear plain dealing, for she appears to be so accomplished, that what would be a compliment to others, when said to her, would be plain dealing.—No truly Sir, said the lady, I am not without my faults more than the rest of my sex; and yet, notwith∣standing all my faults, I love plain dealing, and never am more fond of it, then when it tells me of a fault:'</Q> Then madam, says Mr. Fairbeard, you and the plain dealer seem designed by heaven for each other. In short, Mr. Wycherley acompa∣nied her upon the walks, waited upon her home, visited her daily at her lodgings whilst she stayed at Tunbridge; and after she went to London, at her lodgings in Hatton-Garden: where in a little time he obtained her consent to marry her. This he did by his father's command, without ac∣quainting the king; for it was reasonably supposed that the lady having a great independent estate, and noble and powerful relations, the acquainting the king with the intended match, would be the likeliest way to prevent it. As soon as the news was known at court, it was looked upon as an affront to the king, and a contempt of his majesty's orders: and Mr. Wycherley's conduct after mar∣riage, made the resentment fall heavier upon him: For being conscious he had given offence, and sel∣dom going near the court, his absence was con∣strued into ingratitude.</P>
<P>The countess, though a splendid wife, was not formed to make a husba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d happy; she was in her nature extremely jealous, and indulged it to
<PB N="254" REF="257"/>
such a degree, that she could not endure her hus∣band should be one moment out of her sight. Their lodgings were in Bow-street, Covent-Gar∣den, over against the Cock Tavern; whither if Mr. Wycherley at any time went, he was obliged to leave the windows open, that his lady might see there was no woman in the company.</P>
<P>This was the cause of Mr. Wycherley's disgrace with the King, whose favour and affection he had be∣fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e possessed in so distinguished a degree The countess settled all her estate upon him, but his title being disputed after her death, the expence of the law, and other incumbrances, so far reduced him, that he was not able to satisfy the impatience of his creditors, who threw him at last into prison; so that he, who but a few years before was flourishing in all the gaiety of life, flushed with prospects of court preferment, and happy in the most ex∣tensive reputation for wit and parts, was condemn∣ed to suffer all the rigours of want: for his father did not think proper to support him. In this severe extremity, he fell upon an expedient, which, no doubt, was dictated by his distress, of applying to his Bookseller, who had got considerably by his Plain Dealer, in order to borrow 20 l. but he applied in vain; the Bookseller refused to lend him a shilling; and in that distress he languished for seven years: nor was he released 'till one day King James go∣ing to see his Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n-Dealer performed, was so charmed w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th it, that he gave immediate orders for the payment of the author's debts, adding to that bounty a pension of 200 l. per annum, while he con∣tinued in England. But the generous intention of that Prince to him, had not the designed effect, pure∣ly through his modesty; he being ashamed to tell the earl of Mulgrave, whom the King had sent to de∣mand it, a full state of his debts. He laboured un∣der the weight of these difficulties 'till his father
<PB N="255" REF="258"/>
died, and then the estate that descended to him, was left under very uneasy limitations, he being only a tenant for life, and not being allowed to raise money for the payment of his debts: yet, as he had a power to make a jointure, he married, almost at the eve of his days, a young gentlewo∣man of 1500 l. fortune, part of which being ap∣plied to the uses he wanted it for, he died eleven days after the celebration of his nuptials in Decem∣ber 1715, and was interred in the vault of Co∣vent-Garden church.</P>
<P>Besides the plays already mentioned, he publish∣ed a volume of poems 1704, which met with no great success; for, like Congreve, his strength lay only in the drama, and, unless on the stage, he was but a second rate poet. In 1728 his posthu∣mous works in prose and verse were published by Mr. Lewis Theobald at London in 8vo.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennis, in a few words, has summed up this gentleman's character; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'he was admired by the men for his parts, in wit and learning; and he was ad∣mired by the women for those parts of which they were more competent judges.'</Q> Mr. Wycher∣ley was a man of great sprightliness, and vivaci∣ty of genius, he was said to have been handsome, formed for gallantry, and was certainly an idol with the ladies, a felicity which even his wit might not have procured, without exterior advantages.</P>
<P>As a poet and a dramatist, I cannot better exhi∣bit his character than in the words of George lord Lansdowne; he observes, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that the earl of Ro∣chester, in imitation of one of Horace's epistles, thus mentions our author;'<Q><L>' Of all our modern wits none seem to me,</L>
<L>' Once to have touch'd upon true comedy</L>
<L>' But hasty Shadwel, and slow Wycherley.</L>
<L>' Shadwel's unfinish'd works do yet impart</L>
<L>' Great proofs of nature's force; tho' none of art.</L>
<L><PB N="256" REF="259"/>
' But Wycherley earns hard whate'er he gains,</L>
<L>' He wants no judgment, and he spares no pains.</L></Q> 'Lord Lansdowne is perswaded, that the earl fell into this part of the character (of a laborious writer) merely for the sake of the verse; if hasty, says he, would have stood as an epithet for Wycherley, and slow, for Shadwel, they would in all probability have been so applied, but the verse would have been spoiled, and to that it was ne∣cessary to submit. Those, who would form their judgments only upon Mr. Wycherley's writings, without any personal acquaintance with him, might indeed be apt to conclude, that such a di∣versity of images and characters, such strict en∣quiries into nature, such close observations on the several humours, manners, and affections of all ranks and degrees of men, and, as it were, so true and perfect a dissection of humankind, delivered with so much pointed wit, and force of expression, could be no other than the work of extraordinary diligence, labour, and application; but in truth, we owe the pleasure and advan∣tage of having been so well entertained, and in∣structed by him, to his facility of doing it; if it had been a trouble to him to write, I am much mistaken if he would not have spared that trou∣ble. What he has performed, would have been difficult for another; but a club, which a man of an ordinary size could not lift, was a walking staff for Hercules. To judge by the sharpness, and spirit of his satires, you might be led into another mistake, and imagine him an ill-natur'd man, but what my lord Rochester said of lord Dorset, is applicable to him, the best good man with the worst natured muse. As pointed, and severe as he is in his writings, in his temper he had all the softness of the tenderest disposition; gentle and inoffensive to every man in his par∣ticular
<PB N="257" REF="260"/>
character; he only attacks vice as a pub∣lic enemy, compassionating the wound he is un∣der a necessity to probe, or grieving, like a good natured conqueror, at the occasions which provoke him to make such havock. King Charles II. a nice discerner of men, and himself a man of wit, often chose him for a companion at his leisure hours, as Augustus did Horace, and had very advantageous views for him, but un∣luckily an amorous inclination interfered; the lover got the better of the courtier, and ambi∣tion fell a sacrifice to ove, the predominant pas∣sion of the noblest mind. Many object to his versification; it is certain he is no master of num∣bers, but a Diamond is not less a Diamond for not being polished▪'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Pope, when very young, made his court to Mr. Wycherley, when very old; and the latter was so well pleased with the former, and had such an opinion of his rising genius, that he entered into an intimate correspondence with him, and submitted his works to Mr. Pope's correction.

<HEAD>NAHUM TATE</HEAD>
<P>WAS born about the middle of the reign of Charles II. in the kingdom of Ireland, and there received his education. He was a man of learning, courteous, and candid, but was thought to possess no great genius, as being defi∣cient in what is its first characteristic, name∣ly, invention. He was made poet laureat to King William, upon the death of Shadwell, and held that place 'till the accession of King George I. on whom he lived to write the first Birth-Day Ode, which is executed with unusual spirit. Mr. Tate being a man of extreme modesty, was never able to make his fortune, or to raise himself above neces∣sity; he was obliged to have recourse to the patro∣nage of the earl of Dorset, to screen him from the persecution of his creditors. Besides several other poetical performances, which will be afterwards enumerated, and a Version of the Psalms, in con∣junction with Dr. Brady, Mr. Tate has been the author of nine plays, of which the following is the list;<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Brutus of Alba, a Tragedy; acted at the Duke's Theatre 1678, dedicated to the Earl of Dorset. This play is founded on Virgil's Aeneid, b. iv, and was finished under the name of Dido and Aeneas, but by the advice of some friends, was transformed to the dress it now wears.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="259" REF="262"/>
2. The Loyal General, a Tragedy; acted at the Duke's Theatre 1680.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Richard II. revived, and altered from Shake∣spear, under the title of the Sicilian Usurper; a Tragedy, with a Prefatory Epistle, in Vindication of the Author, occasioned by the Prohibition of this Play on the Stage. The scene is in England.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The Ingratitude of a Commonwealth, or the Fall of Caius Marius Coriolanus; this was printed in 4to. 1682, and dedicated to the Marquis of Worcester; it is founded on Shakespear's Cori∣olanus.</ITEM>

<HEAD>Sir SAMUEL GARTH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was descended from a good family in Yorkshire; after he had passed through his school education, he was removed to Peter-house in Cambridge, where he is said to have continued till he was created Dr. of Physic July 7, 1691<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Biog. Brit. p. 2129.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1696 Dr. Garth zealously promoted the erect∣ing the Dispensary, being an apartment in the college for the relief of the sick poor, by giving them advice gratis, and dispensing medicines to them at low rates. This work of charity having exposed him, and many other of the most eminent Physicians to the envy and resentment of several persons of the same faculty, as well as Apothe∣caries, he ridiculed them with peculiar spirit, and vivacity, in his poem called the Dispensary in 6 Cantos; which, though it first stole into the world a little hastily, and incorrect, in the year 1669, yet bore in a few months three impressions, and was afterwards printed several times, with a dedi∣cation
<PB N="264" REF="267"/>
to Anthony Henley, esquire. This poem, gained our author great reputation; it is of the burlesque species, and executed with a degree of humour, hardly equal'd, unless in the Rape of the Lock.</P>
<P>Our author's poetical character, joined with his skill in his profession, his agreeable conversation, and unaffected good nature, procured him vast practice, introduced him to the acquaintance, and established him in the esteem of most of the no∣bility and gentry. Much about the same time he gave a distinguishing instance of his profound knowledge in his profession, his perfect acquain∣tance with antiquity, and correct taste in Roman eloquence by a Latin oration, pronounced before the Faculty in Warwick-La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, September 17, 1697, to the great satisfaction of the audience, and the raising his own reputation, as the college re∣gister testifies. Pieces of this kind are often com∣posed with peculiar attention to the phrase, the sound of the periods in speaking, and their effect upon the ear; these advantages were by no means neglected in Dr. Garth's performance, but the sen∣timents, the spirit, and stile appeared to still great∣er advantage in the reading; and the applause with which it was received by its hearers, was ecchoed by those who perused it; this instance is the more singular, as few have been distinguished both as ora∣tors and poets.</P>
<P>Clcero, who was not heard by his cotempora∣ries with greater applause, than his works are now read with admiration, attempted poetry without success; reputation in that kind of writing the Roman orator much desired, but never could com∣pose a line to please himself, or any of his friends.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="268"/>
Upon the death of Dryden in May 1701, by a ve∣ry strange accident his burial <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dryden's Life.</NOTE> came to depend on the piety of Dr. Garth, who caused the body to be brought to the College of Physicians, proposed and encouraged by his generous example a subscrip∣tion for defraying the expence of the funeral, and after pronouncing over the corpse a suitable oration, he attended the solemnity to Westminster-Abbey, where at last the remains of that great man were interred in Chaucer's grave. For this memorable act of tenderness and generosity, those who loved the person, or who honoured the parts of that ex∣cellent poet, expressed much gratitude to Dr. Garth. He was one of the most eminent mem∣bers of a famous society called the Kit-Kat Club, which consisted of above thirty noblemen and gen∣tlemen, distinguished by their zealous affection to the Protestant succession in the House of Hanover<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">History of the Stewarts, vol. ii. p. 479.</NOTE>. October 3, 1702 he was elected one of the Cen∣sors of the College of Physicians. In respect to his political principles, he was open and warm, and which was still more to be valued, he was steady and sincere. In the time of lord Godol∣phin's administration, nobody was better received of his rank than Dr. Garth; and nobody seemed to have a higher opinion of that minister's integrity, and abilities in which he had, however, the satis∣faction of thinking with the public.</P>
<P>In 1710, when the Whig ministry was discarded, and his lordship had an opportunity of distinguishing his own friends, from those which were only the friends of his power, it could not fail of giving him sensible pleasure to find Dr. Garth early de∣claring for him, and amongst the first who be∣stowed upon him the tribute of his muse, at a time when that nobleman's interest sunk: A situa∣tion
<PB N="266" REF="269"/>
which would have struck a flatterer dumb. There were some to whom this testimony of gra∣titude was by no means pleasing, and therefore the Dr's. lines were severely criticised by the ex∣aminer, a paper engaged in the defence of the new ministry; but instead of sinking the credit either of the author, or the verses, they added to the honour of both, by exciting Mr. Addison to draw his pen in their defence. In order to form a judg∣ment both of the Criticism, and the Defence, it will be necessary first of all to read the poem to which they refer, more especially as it is very short, and may be supposed to have been written suddenly, and, at least, as much from the author's gratitude to his noble patron, as a desire of add∣ing to his reputation.<Q><LG>

<P>These verses, however they may express the gra∣titude, and candour of the author, and may con∣tain no more than truth of the personage to whom they are addressed, yet, every reader of taste will perceive, that the verses are by no means equal to the rest of Dr. Garth's poetical writings. Re∣marks upon these verses were published in a Let∣ter to the Examiner, September 7, 1710. The author observes, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That there does not appear either poetry, grammar, or design in the com∣position of this poem; the whole (says he) seems to be, as the sixth edition of the Dispensary, happily expresses it, a strong, unlaboured, impotence of thought. I freely examine it by the new test of good poetry, which the Dr. himself has esta∣blished. Pleasing at first sight: Has this piece the least title even to that? or if we compare it to the only pattern, as he thinks, of just writing in this kind, Ovid; is there any thing in De Tristi∣bus so wild, so childish, so flat? what can the ingenious Dr. mean, or at what time could he write these verses? half of the poem is a pane∣gyric on a Lord Treasurer in being, and the rest a compliment of condolance to an Earl that has lost the Staff. In thirty lines his patron is a ri∣ver,
<PB N="268" REF="271"/>
the primum mobile, a pilot, a victim, the sun, any thing and nothing. He bestows in∣crease, conceals his source, makes the machine move, teaches to steer, expiates our offences, raises vapours, and looks larger as he sets; nor is the choice of his expression less exquisite, than that of his similies. For commerce to run<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The line here referred to, was omitted in the later editions of these verses.</NOTE>, passions to be poized, merit to be received from dependance, and a machine to be serene, is per∣fectly new. The Dr. has a happy talent at in∣vention, and has had the glory of enriching our language by his phrases, as much as he has improved medicine by his bills.'</Q> The critic then proceeds to consider the poem more minutely, and to expose it by enumerating particulars. Mr Ad∣dison in a Whig Examiner published September 14, 1710, takes occasion to rally the fierce over∣bearing spirit of the Tory Examiner, which, he says, has a better title to the name of the execu∣tioner. He then enters into the defence of the Dr's. poem, and observes, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that the phrase of passions being poized, and retrieving merit from depen∣dence, cavi'led at by the critics, are beautiful and poetical; it is the same cavilling spirit, says he, that finds fault with that expression of the Pomp of Peace, among Woes of War, as well as of Offering unasked.'</Q> This general piece of raillery which he passes on the Dr's. considering the treasurer in several different views, is that which might fall upon any poem in Waller, or any other writer who has diversity of thoughts and allusions, and though it may appear a pleasant ridicule to an ignorant reader, is wholly ground∣less and unjust.</P>
<P>Mr. Addison's Answer is, however, upon the whole, rather a palliation, than a defence. All the skill of that writer could never make that
<PB N="269" REF="272"/>
poetical, or a fine panegyric, which is in its own nature removed from the very appearance of poetry; but friendship, good nature, or a coincidence of party, will sometimes engage the greatest men to combat in defence of trifles, and even against their own judgment, as Dryden finely expresses it in his Address to Congreve,<Q>" Vindicate a friend."</Q></P>
<P>In 1711 Dr. Garth wrote a dedication for an in∣tended edition of Lucretius, addressed to his late Majesty, then Elector of Brunswick, which has been admired as one of the purest compositions in the Latin tongue that our times have produced.</P>
<P>On the accession of that King to the throne, he had the honour of knighthood conferred upon him by his Majesty, with the duke of Marlbo∣rough's sword<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chronol. Diary for A. D. 1714-15.</NOTE>. He was likewise made Phy∣sician in ordinary to the King, and Physician General to the army. As his known services pro∣cured him a great interest with those in power, so his humanity and good nature inclined him to make use of that interest, rather for the support, and encouragement of men of letters who had me∣rit, than for the advancement of his private for∣tune; his views in that respect having been always very moderate. He lived with the great in that degree of esteem and independency, and with all that freedom which became a man possessed of superi∣or genius, and the most shining and valuable ta∣lents. His poem entitled Claremont, addressed to the duke of Newcastle, printed in the 6th vo∣lume of Dryden's Miscellanies, met with great ap∣probation. A warm admirer of the Doctor's, speak∣ing of Claremont, thus expresses himself; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'It will survive, says he, the noble structure it celebrates,
<PB N="270" REF="273"/>
and will remain a perpetual monument of its author's learning, taste, and great capacity as a poet; since, in that short work, there are innu∣merable beauties, and a vast variety of senti∣ments easily and happily interwoven; the most lively strokes of satire being intermixed with the most courtly panegyric, at the same time that there appears the true spirit of enthusiasm, which distinguishes the works of one born a poet, from those of a witty, or learned man, that has arrived at no higher art, than that of making verse<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Biog. Britan, p. 2135.</NOTE>.'</Q> His knowledge in philosophy, his correct taste in criticism, and his thorough ac∣quaintance in classical literature, with all the ad∣vantages that can be derived from an exact, but concealed method, an accurate, though flowing st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, and a language pure, natural, and full of vi∣vacity, appear, says the same panegyrist in the preface he prefixed to a translation of Ovid's Me∣tamorphoses, which would have been sufficient to have raised him an immortal reputation, if it had been the only product of his pen.</P>
<P>Dr. Garth is said to have been a man of the most extensive benevolence; that his hand and heart went always together: A circumstance more valuable than all the lustre which genius can confer. We can∣not however, speak of his works with so much warmth, as the author just quoted seems to indulge. His works will scarce make a moderate volume, and though they contain many things excellent, judicious, and humorous, yet they will not justify the writer, who dwells upon them in the same rap∣turous strain of admiration, with which we speak of a Horace, a Milton, or a Pope. He had the happiness of an early acquaintance with some of the most powerful, wisest, and wittiest men of the age in which he lived; he attached himself to a party,
<PB N="271" REF="274"/>
which at last obtained the ascendant, and he was equally successful in his fortune as his friends: Persons in these circumstances are seldom praised, or censured with moderation.</P>
<P>We have already seen how warmly Addison e∣spoused the Dr's. writings, when they were at∣tacked upon a principle of party, and there are many of the greatest wits of his time who pay him compliments; amongst the rest is lord Lans∣downe, who wrote some verses upon his illness; but as the lines do no great honour either to his lordship, or the Dr. we forbear to insert them.</P>
<P>The following passage is taken from one of Pope's Letters, written upon the death of Dr. Garth, which, we dare say, will be more acceptable. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The best natured of men (says he) Sir Samuel Garth has left me in the truest concern for his loss. His death was very heroical, and yet unaffected e∣nough to have made a saint, or a philosopher fa∣mous. But ill tongues, and worse hearts have branded his last moments, as wrongfully as they did his life, with irreligion: you must have heard many tales upon this subject; but if ever there was a good christian, without knowing himself to be so, it was Dr. Garth.'</Q></P>
<P>Our author was censured for his love of pleasure, in which perhaps it would be easier to excuse than defend him; but upon the whole, his character appears to have been very amiable, particularly, that of his bearing a tide of prosperity with so much evenness of temper; and his universal benevolence, which seems not to have been cramped with party principles; as appears from his piety towards the remains of Dryden.</P>
<P>He died after a short illness, January 18, 1718-19, and was buried the 22d of the same month in the church of Harrow on the Hill, in the county of Mid∣dlesex, in a vault he caused to be built for himself and

<HEAD>NICHOLAS ROWE, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS excellent poet was descended from an ancient family in Devonshire, which had for many ages made a very good figure in that county, and was known by the name of the Rowes of Lambertowne. Mr. Rowe could trace his an∣cestors in a direct line up to the times of the ho∣ly war, in which one of them so distinguished him∣self, that at his return he had the arms given him, which the family has born ever since, that being in those days all the reward of military virtue, or of blood spilt in those expeditions.</P>
<P>From that time downward to Mr. Rowe's father, the family betook themselves to the frugal manage∣ment of a private fortune, and the innocent plea∣sures of a country life. Having a handsome estate, they lived beyond the fear of want, or reach of envy. In all the changes of government, they
<PB N="273" REF="276"/>
are said to have ever leaned towards the side of public liberty, and in that retired situation of life, have beheld with grief and concern the many en∣croachments that have been made in it from time to time.</P>
<P>Our author was born at Little Berkford in Bed∣fordshire, at the house of Jasper Edwards, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> his mother's father, in the year 1673<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Welwood's preface to Rowe's Lucan.</NOTE>. He began his education at a private grammar-school in Highgate; but the taste he there acquired of the classic authors, was improved, and finished un∣der the care of the famous Dr. Busby of West∣minster school; where, about the age of 12 years, he was chosen one of the King's scholars. Besides his skill in the Latin and Greek languages, he had made a tolerable proficiency in the Hebrew; but poetry was his early bent, and darling study. He composed, at different times, several copies of verses upon various subjects both in Greek and Latin, and some in English, which were much ad∣mired, and the more so, because they were pro∣duced with so much facility, and seemed to flow from his imagination, as fast as from his pen.</P>
<P>His father, who was a Serjeant at Law, design∣ing him for his own profession, took him from that school when he was about sixteen years of age, and entered him a student in the Middle Tem∣ple, whereof himself was a member, that he might have him under his immediate care and instructi∣on. Being capable of any part of knowledge, to which he thought proper to apply, he made very remarkable advances in the study of the Law, and was not content to know it, as a collection of statutes, or customs only, but as a system founded upon right reason, and calculated for the good of mankind. Being afterwards called to the bar, he promised as fair to make a figure in that profes∣sion,
<PB N="274" REF="277"/>
as any of his cotemporaries, if the love of the Belles Lettres, and that of poetry in particular, had not stopped him in his career. To him there appeared more charms in Euripides, Sophocles, and Aeschilus, than in all the records of an∣tiquity, and when he came to discern the beau∣ties of Shakespear and Milton, his soul was cap∣tivated beyond recovery, and he began to think with contempt of all other excellences, when put in the ballance with the enchantments of poetry and genius. Mr. Rowe had the best opportunities of rising to eminence in the Law, by means of the patronage of Sir George Treby, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, who was fond of him to a very great degree, and had it in his power to promote him; but being overcome by his propension to poetry, and his first tragedy, called the Ambitious Step-mother, meeting with universal applause, he laid aside all thoughts of the Law. The Ambitious Step mother was our author's first attempt in the drama, written by him in the 25th year of his age, and dedi∣cated to the earl of Jersey. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The purity of the language (says Mr. Welwood) the justness of his characters, the noble elevation of the sentiments, were all of them admirably adapted to the plan of the play.'</Q></P>
<P>The Ambitious Step-mother, being the first, is con∣ducted with less judgment than any other of Rowe's tragedies; it has an infinite deal of fire in it, the bu∣siness is precipitate, and the characters active, and what is somewhat remarkable, the author never after wrote a play with so much elevation. Critics have complained of the sameness of his poetry; that he makes all his characters speak equally elegant, and has not attended sufficiently to the manners. This uniformity of versification, in the opinion of some, has spoiled our modern tragedies, as poetry is made to supply nature, and declamation cha∣racters.
<PB N="275" REF="278"/>
Whether this observation is well found∣ed, we shall not at present examine, only remark, that if any poet has a right to be forgiven for this error, Mr. Rowe certainly has, as his cadence is the sweetest in the world, his sentiments chaste, and his language elegant. Our author wrote several other Tragedies, but that which he valued himself most upon, says Welwood, was his Tamerlane; acted at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, and dedicated to the marquis of Hartington.</P>
<P>In this play, continues Welwood, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'He aimed at a parallel between the late king William and Tamerlane, and also Bajazet, and a monarch who is since dead. That glorious ambition in Tamer∣lane, to break the chains of enslaved nations, and set mankind free from the encroachments of law∣less power, are painted in the most lively, as well as the most amiable colours. On the other side, his manner of introducing on the stage a prince, whose chief aim is to perpetuate his name to pos∣terity, by that havock and ruin he scatters through the world, are all drawn with that pomp of hor∣ror, and detestation, which such monstrous actions deserve. And, since nothing could be more calculated for raising in the minds of the audience a true passion for liberty, and a just abhorrence of slavery, how this play came to be discouraged, next to a prohibition, in the latter end of queen Anne's reign, I leave it to others to give a reason.'</Q></P>
<P>Thus far Dr. Welwood, who has endeavoured to point out the similiarity of the character of Tamerlane, to that of king William. Though it is certainly true, that the Tamerlane of Rowe con∣tains grander sentiments than any of his other plays; yet, it may be a matter of dispute whether Tamer∣lane ought to give name to the play; for Tamerlane is victorious, and Bajazet the sufferer. Besides the
<PB N="276" REF="279"/>
fate of these two monarchs, there is likewise con∣tained in it, the Episode of Moneses, and Arpasia, which is of itself sufficiently distressful to make the subject of a tragedy. The attention is diverted from the fall of Bajazet, which ought to have been the main design, and bewildered in the fortunes of Moneses, and Arpasia, Axalla and Selima: There are in short, in this play, events enough for four; and in the variety and importance of them, Tamerlane and Bajazet must be too much neglected. All the cha∣racters of a play should be subordinate to the leading one, and their business in the drama subservient to promote his fate; but this performance is not the tragedy of Bajazet, or Tamerlane only; but likewise the tragedies of Moneses and Arpasia, Axala and Selima. It is now performed annually, on the 4th and 5th of November, in commemoration of the Gun-powder Treason, and the landing of king Wil∣liam in this rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, when an occasional prologue is spoken.</P>
<P>Another tragedy of Mr. Rowe's is the Fair Penitent, acted at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields; and dedicated to the duchess of Ormond; This is one of the most finished performances of our author. The character of Sciolto the father is strongly marked; Horatio's the most amiable of all characters, and is so sustained as to strike an audience very forcibly. In this, as in the former play, Mr. Rowe is guilty of a mis-nomer; for his Calista has not the least claim to be called the Fair Penitent, which would be better changed to the Fair Wanton; for she discovers not one pang of remorse till the last act, and that seems to arise more from the external distress to which she is then exposed, than to any compunctions of conscience. She still loves and doats on her base betrayer, though a most insignificant creature. In this character, Rowe has been true to the sex, in drawing a woman, as she generally is, fond of her seducer; but he has not
<PB N="277" REF="280"/>
drawn a Penitent. The character of Altamont is one of those which the present players observe, is the hardest to represent of any in the drama; there is a kind of meanness in him, joined with an un∣suspecting honest heart, and a doating fondness for the false fair one, that is very difficult to illustrate: This part has of late been generally given to performers of but very moderate abilities; by which the play suffers prodigiously, and Altamont, who is really one of the most important persons in the drama, is beheld with neglect, or perhaps with contempt; but seldom with pity. Altamont, in the hands of a good actor, would draw the eyes of the audience, notwithstanding the blustering Lothario, and the superior dignity of Horatio; for there is something in Altamont, to create our pity, and work upon our compassion.</P>
<P>So many players failing of late, in the this cha∣racter, leaves it a matter of doubt, whether the actor is most mistaken in his performance; or the manager in the distribution of parts.</P>
<P>The next tragedy Mr. Rowe wrote was his Ulysses, acted at the queen's Theatre, in the Hay-Market, and dedicated to the earl of Godolphin. This play is not at present in possession of the stage, though it deserves highly to be so, as the character of Pene∣lope, is an excellent example of conjugal fidelity: Who, though her lord had been ten years absent from her, and various accounts had been given of his death, yet, notwithstanding this, and the addresses of many royal suitors, she preserved her heart for her Ulysses, who at last triumphed over his enemies, and res∣cued his faithful queen from the persecution of her wooers.—This play has business, passion, and tragic propriety to recommend it.—</P>
<P>The next play Mr. Rowe brought upon the stage, was his Royal Convert, acted at the queen's Theatre, in the Haymarket, and dedicated to the earl of Hallifax.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="281" MS="y"/>
His next was the Tragedy of Jane Shore, writter in imitation of Shakespear's stile; acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane, and dedicated to the duke of Queensberry and Dover. How Mr. Rowe could imagine that this play is written at all in imitation of Shakespear's stile, we cannot con∣ceive; for so far as we are able to judge, it bears not the least resemblance to that of Shakespear. The conduct of the design is regular, and in that sense it partakes not of Shakespear's wildness; the poetry is uniform, which marks it to be Rowe's, but in that it is very different from Shakespear, whose excellency does not consist merely in the beauty of soft language, or nightingale descrip∣tions; but in the general power of his drama, the boldness of the images, and the force of his characters.</P>
<P>Our author afterwards brought upon the stage his Lady Jane Grey, dedicated to the earl of Warwick; this play is justly in possession of the stage likewise. Mr. Edmund Smith, of Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist's-Church, author of Phaedra and Hyppolitus, designed writing a Tra∣gedy on this subject; and at his death left some loose hints of sentiments, and short sketches of scenes. From the last of these, Mr. Rowe acknow∣ledges he borrowed part of one, and inserted it in his third act, viz. that between lord Guilford, and lady Jane. It is not much to be regretted, that Mr. Smith did not live to finish this, since it fell into the hands of one so much above him, as a dramatist; for if we may judge of Mr. Smith's abilities of writing for the stage, by his Phaedra and Hyppolitus, it would not have been so well executed as by Rowe. Phaedra and Hyppolitus, is a play without passion, though of inimitable versification; and in the words of a living poet,
<PB N="279" REF="282"/>
we may say of it, that not the character, but poet speaks.</P>
<P>It may be justly said of all Rowe's Tragedies, that never poet painted virtue, religion, and all the relative and social duties of life, in a more alluring dress, on the stage; nor were ever vice or im∣piety, better exposed to contempt and abhorrence.</P>
<P>The same principles of liberty he had early imbibed himself, seemed a part of his constitu∣tion, and appeared in every thing he wrote; and he took all occasions that fell in his way, to make his talents subservient to them: His Muse was so religiously chaste, that I do not remember, says Dr. Welwood, one wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in any of his plays or writings, that might admit of a double meaning in any point of decency, or morals. There is nothing to be found in them, to flatter a depraved populace, or humour a fashionable folly.</P>
<P>Mr. Rowe's Plays were written from the heart, He practised the virtue he admired, and he never, in his gayest moments, suffered himself to talk loose∣ly or lightly upon religious or moral subjects; or to turn any thing sacred, or which good men reverenced as such, into ridicule.</P>
<P>Our author wrote a comedy of three acts, called the Biter. It was performed at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields; but without success, for Rowe's genius did not lie towards Comedy.—In a conversation he had with Mr. Pope, that great poet advised him to rescue the queen of Scots, from the hands of Banks; and to make that lady to shine on the stage, with a lustre equal to her character. Mr. Rowe observed in answer to this, that he was a great admirer of queen Elizabeth; and as he could not well plan a play upon the queen of Scots's story, without introducing his favourite princess, who in that particular makes but an indifferent figure, he chose to decline it: Besides, he knew that if he favoured the northern lady, there was a strong party
<PB N="280" REF="283"/>
concerned to crush it; and if he should make her appear less great than she was, and throw a shade over her real endowments, he should violate truth, and incur the displeasure of a faction, which though by far the minority, he knew would be yet too powerful for a poet to combat with.</P>
<P>The late duke of Queensberry, when secretary of state, made Mr. Rowe secretary for public affairs; and when that nobleman came to know him well, he was never more delighted than when in his com∣pany: After the duke's death, all avenues were stopt to his preferment; and during the rest of queen Anne's reign, he passed his time with the Muses and his books, and sometimes with the conversation of his friends.</P>
<P>While Mr. Rowe was thus without a patron, he went one day to pay his court to the earl of Oxford, lord high treasurer of England, then at the head of the Tory faction, who asked him if he understood Spanish well? He answered no: but imagining that his lordship might intend to send him into Spain on some honourable commission, he presently added, that in a short time he did not doubt but he should pre∣sently be able, both to understand it, and speak it. The earl approving of what he said, Mr. Rowe took his leave, and immediately retired out of town to a private country farm; where, within a few months, he learned the Spanish tongue, and then waited again on the earl to give him an account of his diligence. His lordship asking him, if he was sure he understood it thoroughly, and Mr. Rowe an∣swering in the affirmative, the earl burst into an ex∣clamation; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'How happy are you Mr. Rowe, that you can enjoy the pleasure of reading, and under∣standing Don Quixote in the original!'</Q></P>
<P>This wanton cruelty inflicted by his lord∣ship, of raising expectations in the mind, that he never intended to gratify, needs only be told to excite indignation.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="284"/>
Upon the accession of king George the Ist. to the throne, Mr. Rowe was made Poet-Laureat, and one of the surveyors of the customs, in the port of London. The prince of Wales conferred on him, the place of clerk of his council, and the lord chancellor Parker, made him his secretary for the presentations, the very day he received the seals, and without his asking it.</P>
<P>He was twice married, first to a daughter of Mr. auditor Parsons; and afterwards to a daughter of Mr. Devenish of a good family in Dorsetshire. By his first wife, he had a son, and by his second a daughter.</P>
<P>Mr. Rowe died the 6th of December 1718, in the 45th year of his age, like a christian and a philoso∣pher, and with an unfeigned resignation to the will of God: He preserved an evenness of temper to the last, and took leave of his wife, and friends, immediately before his last agony, with the same tranquility of mind, as if he had been taking but a short journey.</P>
<P>He was interred in Westminster-Abbey, over against Chaucer; his body being attended with a vast number of friends, and the dean and chapter officiating at the funeral. A tomb was afterwards erected to his memory, by his wife, for which Mr. Pope wrote an epitaph, which we shall here insert; not one word of which is hyperbolical, or more than he deserves.<Q><PB N="282" REF="285"/>Epitaph on ROWE, by Mr. POPE.

<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Mr. Rowe, as to his person, was graceful and well made, his face regular and of a manly beauty; he had a quick, and fruitful invention, a deep penetration, and a large compass of thought, with a singular dexterity, and easiness in communicat∣ing his opinions. He was master of most parts of polite learning, especially the Classic Authors, both Greek and Latin; he understood the French, Italian and Spanish languages. He had likewise read most of the Greek and Roman histories in their original languages; and most that are writ∣ten in English, French, Italian and Spanish: He had a good taste in philosophy, and having a firm impression of religion upon his mind, he took de∣light in divinity, and ecclesiastical history, in both which he made great advances in the times he retired to the country, which were frequent. He expressed upon all occasions, his full perswasion of the truth of revealed religion; and being a sin∣cere
<PB N="283" REF="286"/>
member of the established church himself, he pitied, but condemned not, those who de∣parted from him; he abhorred the principle of per∣secuting men on account of religious opinions, and being strict in his own, he took it not upon him to censure those of another persuasion. His con∣versation was pleasant, witty, and learned, with∣out the least tincture of affectation or pedantry; and his inimitable manner of diverting, or enliven∣ing the company, made it impossible for any one to be out of humour when he was in it: Envy and detraction, seemed to be entirely foreign to his constitution; and whatever provocation he met with at any time, he passed them over, without the least thought of resentment or revenge. There were not wanting some malevolent people, and some pretenders to poetry too, that would some∣times bark at his best performances; but he was too much conscious of his own genius, and had so much good-nature as to forgive them, nor could however be tempted to return them an answer.'</Q></P>
<P>This is the amiable character of Mr. Rowe, drawn by Mr. Welwood, to which we shall add the words of Mr. Pope, in a letter to Edward Blount, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> dated February the 10th, 1715. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'There was a vivacity and gaiety of disposition almost peculiar to Mr. Rowe, which made it impossible to part with him, without that uneasiness, which generally succeeds all our pleasures.'</Q></P>
<P>It would perhaps be injurious to the memory of Rowe, to dismiss his life, without taking notice of his translations of Lucan, and Quillet's Calli∣paedia; the versification in both is musical, and well adapted to the subject; nor is there any reason to doubt but that the true meaning of the original, is faithfully preserved throughout the whole. These translations, however, with Mr. Rowe's Occasional

Poems, and Birth-Day Odes, are but little read, and he is only distinguished as a dramatist; for which we shall not pretend to assign a reason; but we may observe, that a Muse capable of produce∣ing so many excellent dramatic pieces, cannot be supposed to have executed any plan indifferently; however, it may charm a reader less than that kind of composition, which is set off on the Thea∣tre, with so many advantages.</P>
<P>He published likewise an edition of the works of Shakespear, and prefixed the life of that great man, from materials which he had been industrious to collect, in the county where Shakespear was born, and to which, after he had filled the world with admiration of his genius, he retired.</P>
<P>We deem it unnecessary to give any specimen of Mr. Rowe's poetry; the most celebrated speeches in his plays, which are beautifully harmonious; are repeated by every body who reads poetry, or attends plays; and to suppose the reader ignorant of them, would be to degrade him from that rank of in∣telligence, without which he can be little illu∣minated by perusing the <HI>Lives of the Poets.</HI></P>

<HEAD>JOHN SHEFFIELD, Duke of BUCKINGHAM.</HEAD>
<P>THIS nobleman, who made a very great fi∣gure in the last age, as an author, a states∣man, and a soldier: was born about the year 1650. He lost his father when he was about nine years of age, and his mother soon after marrying lord Ossulton; the care of his education was left en∣tirely to a governor, who though a man of letters, did not much improve him in his studies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Character of the Duke of Buckingham, p. 2. London, 1729.</NOTE>. Having parted with his governor, with whom he travelled into France; he soon found by conversing with men of genius, that he was much deficient in many parts of literature, and that while he acquired the graces of a gentleman, he was yet wanting in those higher excellencies; without which politeness makes but an indifferent figure, and can never raise a man to eminence.</P>
<P>He possessed an ample fortune, but for a while laid a restraint upon his appetites, and passions, and dedicated for some time a certain number of hours every day to his studies, by which means he acquired a degree of learning, that entitled him to the character of a fine scholar. But not content with that acquisition, our noble author extended his views yet farther, and restless in the pursuit of distinction, we find him at a very early age entering
<PB N="286" REF="289"/>
himself a volunteer in the second Dutch war; and accordingly was in that famous naval engagement, where the duke of York commanded as admiral, on which occasion his lordship behaved himself so gal∣lantly, that he was appointed commander of the royal Katherine, a second rate man of war.</P>
<P>His lordship in his own Memoirs, tells us, that when he entered himself a volunteer under his royal highness the duke of York, he was then deeply engaged, and under the soft influence of love: He says, he never shall forget the tenderness of parting from his mistress. On this account double honour is due to him:—To enter the bustle of war, without any other call, but that of honour, at an age when most young noblemen are under the tuition of a dancing master, argued a generous intrepid nature; but to leave the arms of his mis∣tress, to tear himself from her he doated on, in order to serve his country, carries in it yet a higher degree of merit, and ought to put all young men of fortune to the blush, who would rather meanly riot in luxurious ease at home, than do honour to themselves and their country, by endeavouring to serve it.</P>
<P>His lordship acknowledges in the above-menti∣oned Memoirs, that the duke of York did wonders in the engagement; and that he was as intrepid in his nature, as some of his enemies supposed him to be of an opposite character; though, says he, alluding to what afterwards happened, misfortunes, age, and other accidents, will make a great man differ from himself. We find our young nobleman while he was aboard a ship, amidst the noise of the crew, could yet indulge his genius for poetry. One would imagine that the ocean is too boisterous an element for the Muses, whose darling wish is for ease and retirement; yet, we find him amidst the roaring of winds and waves, open his Poem with these soothing lines.<Q><PB N="287" REF="290"/><L>Within the silent shades of soft repose,</L>
<L>Where fancy's boundless stream for ever flows;</L>
<L>Where the enfranchis'd soul, at ease can play,</L>
<L>Tir'd with the toilsome bus'ness of the day,</L>
<L>Where princes gladly rest their weary heads,</L>
<L>And change uneasy thrones for downy beds:</L>
<L>Where seeming joys delude despairing minds,</L>
<L>And where even jealousy some quiet finds;</L>
<L>There I, and sorrow, for a while could part,</L>
<L>Sleep clos'd my eyes, and eas'd a sighing heart.</L></Q></P>
<P>Our author afterwards made a campaign in the French service.</P>
<P>As Tangier was in danger of being taken by the Moors, he offered to head the forces which were to defend it; and accordingly he was appointed com∣mander of them. He was then earl of Mulgrave, and one of the lords of the bed-chamber to king Charles the IId. In May 28, 1674, he was installed knight of the Garter.</P>
<P>As he now began to be eminent at court, it was impossible but he must have enemies, and these ene∣mies being mean enough to hint stories to his pre∣judice, in regard to some ladies, with whom the king was not unconcerned; his lordship's command was not made so agreeable as it otherwise would have been. The particulars of this affair have been disputed by historians, some have imagined it to refer to some celebrated courtezan, whose affections his lordship weaned from the king, and drew them to himself; but Mrs. Manly, in her new Atalantis, and Boyer, in his History of queen Anne, assign a very different cause. They say, that before the lady Anne was married to prince George of Denmark, she encouraged the addresses which the earl of Mul∣grave was bold enough to make her; and that he was sent to Tangier to break off the correspondence.</P>
<P>Mrs. Manly in her Atalantis, says many unhand∣some things of his lordship, under the title of count
<PB N="288" REF="291"/>
Orgueil. Boyer says, some years before the queen was married to prince George of Denmark, the earl of Mulgrave, a nobleman of singular accomplish∣ments, both of mind and person, aspired so high as to attempt to marry the lady Anne; but though his addresses to her were checked, as soon as discovered, yet the princess had ever an esteem for him.</P>
<P>This account is more probably true, than the former; when it is considered, that by sending the earl to Tangier<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Dictionary. See Article Sheffield.</NOTE>, a scheme was laid for destroying him, and all the crew aboard the same vessel. For the ship which was appointed to carry the general of the forces, was in such a condition, that the captain of her declared, he was afraid to make the voyage. Upon this representation, lord Mulgrave applied both to the lord admiral, and the king him∣self: The first said, the ship was safe enough, and no other could be then procured. The king an∣swered him coldly, that he hoped it would do, and that he should give himself no trouble about it. His lordship was reduced to the extremity either of going in a leaky ship, or absolutely refusing; which he knew his enemies would impute to cowardice, and as he abhorred the imputation, he resolved, in opposition to the advice of his friends, to hazard all; but at the same time advised several volunteers of quality, not to accompany him in the expedition, as their ho∣nour was not so much engaged as his; some of whom wisely took his advice, but the earl of Plymouth, natural son of the king, piqued him∣self in running the same danger with a man who went to serve his father, and yet was used so strangely by the ill-offices of his ministers.</P>
<P>Providence, however defeated the ministerial scheme of assassination, by giving them the finest weather during the voyage, which held three weeks,
<PB N="289" REF="292"/>
and by pumping all the time, they landed safe at last at Tangier, where they met with admiral Her∣bert, afterwards earl of Torrington, who could not but express his admiration, at their having performed such a voyage in a ship he had sent home as unfit for service; but such was the undisturbed tranquility and native firmness of the earl of Mulgrave's mind, that in this hazardous voyage, he composed the Poem, part of which we have quoted.</P>
<P>Had the earl of Mulgrave been guilty of any offence, capital, or otherwise, the ministry might have called him to account for it; but their con∣triving, and the king's consenting to so bloody a purpose, is methinks such a stain upon them, as can never be wiped off; and had that nobleman and the ship's crew perished, they would have added actual murther, to concerted baseness.</P>
<P>Upon the approach of his lordship's forces, the Moors retired, and the result of this expedition was, the blowing up of Tangier. Some time after the king was appeased, the earl forgot the ill offices, that had been done him; and enjoyed his majesty's favour to the last. He continued in several great posts during the short reign of king James the IId, till that prince abdicated the throne. As the earl constantly and zealously advised him against several imprudent measures, which were taken by the court, the king, some months before the revolution, began to grow cooler towards him; but yet was so equitable as not to remove him from his preferments: And after the king lost his crown, he had the inward satisfaction, to be conscious, that his councils had not contributed to that prince's misfortunes; and that himself, in any manner, had not forfeited his honour and integrity.</P>
<P>That his lordship was no violent friend to, or promoter of, the revolution, seems to appear from his conduct during that remarkable aera;
<PB N="290" REF="293"/>
and particularly from the unfinished relation he left concerning it, which was suppressed some years ago, by order of the government.</P>
<P>In a passage in his lordship's writings, it appears he was unwilling that king James should leave England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 106.</NOTE>. Just as the king was stepping into bed the night before his going away, the earl of Mul∣grave came into the bed-chamber, which, being at so late an hour, might possibly give the king some apprehensions of that lord's su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pecting his design, with which he was resolved not to trust him, nor any protestant: He therefore stopped short, and turned about to whisper him in the ear, that his commissioners had newly sent him a very hope∣ful account of some accommodation with the Prince of Orange; to which that lord only replied with a question, asking him if the Prince's army halted, or approached nearer to London? the King owned they still marched on; at which the earl shook his head, and said no more, only made him a low bow, with a dejected countenance, hum∣bly to make him understand that he gave no cre∣dit to what the King's hard circumstances at that time obliged him to dissemble. It also appears that the earl of Mulgrave was one of those lords, who, immediately after the King's departure, sent letters to the fleet, to the abandoned army of King James, and to all the considerable garrisons in Eng∣land, which kept them in order and subjection, not only to the present authority, but that which should be settled afterwards.</P>
<P>To his lordship's humanity was owing the pro∣tection King James obtained from the Lords in London, upon his being seized, and insulted by the populace at Feversham in Kent; before which time, says he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the Peers sat daily in the council
<PB N="291" REF="294"/>
chamber in Whitehall, where the lord Mulgrave one morning happened to be advertised pri∣vately that the King had been seized by the an∣gry rabble at Feversham, and had sent a poor countryman with the news, in order to procure his rescue, which was like to come too late, since the messenger had waited long at the coun∣cil door, without any body's being willing to take notice of him. This sad account moved him with great compassion at so extraordinary an instance of worldly uncertainty; and no cautions of offending the prevailing party were able to restrain him from shewing a little indignation at so mean a proceeding in the council; upon which, their new president, the marquis of Hallifax, would have adjourned it hastily, in order to pre∣vent him. But the lord Mulgrave earnestly conjured them all to sit down again, that he might acquaint them with a matter that admitted no delay, and was of the highest importance ima∣ginable. Accordingly the Lords, who knew no∣thing of the business, could not but hearken to it; and those few that guessed it, and saw the consequence, yet wanted time enough for con∣certing together about so nice, and very impor∣tant a matter, as saving, or losing a King's life. The Lords then sat down again, and he repre∣sented to them what barbarity it would be, for such an assembly's conniving at the rabble's tear∣ing to pieces, even any private gentleman, much more a great Prince, who, with all his popery, was still their Sovereign; so that mere shame o∣bliged them to suspend their politics awhile, and call in the messenger, who told them with tears, how the King had engaged him to deli∣ver a letter from him to any persons he could find willing to save him from so imminent a danger. The letter had no superscription, and was to this effect;'<P><PB N="292" REF="295"/>
'To acquaint the reader of it, that he had been discovered in his retreat by some fishermen of Kent, and secured at first there by the gentry, who were afterwards forced to resign him into the hands of an insolent rabble.'</P>
<P>'Upon so pressing an occasion, and now so very publickly made known, the council was surprized, and under some difficulty, for as there was danger of displeasing by doing their duty, so there was no less by omitting it, since the Law makes it highly criminal in such an extremity; besides that most of them as yet unacquainted with the Prince of Orange, imagined him prudent, and consequently capable of punishing so base a desertion, either out of generosity, or policy. These found afterwards their caution needless, but at present it influenced the council to send 200 of the life guards under their captain the earl of Feversham; first to rescue the King from all danger of the common people, and afterwards to attend him toward the sea side; if he continued his resolution of retiring, which they thought it more decent to connive at. than to detain him here by force.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Whoever has the least spark of generosity in his nature, cannot but highly applaud this tender con∣duct of his lordship's, towards his Sovereign in distress; and look with contempt upon the slow∣ness of the council in dispatching a force to his relief, especially when we find it was only out of dread, lest they should displease the Prince of Orange, that they sent any: this shewed a mean∣ness of spirit, a want of true honour, to such a degree, that the Prince of Orange himself could not, consistently with good policy, trust those wor∣shippers of power, who could hear, unconcerned, that their late Sovereign was in the hands of a vile rabble, and intreating them in vain for rescue.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="296"/>
The earl of Mulgrave made no mean compli∣ances to King William, immediately after the re∣volution, but when he went to pay his addresses to him, he was well received; yet did he not accept of a post in the government till some years after.</P>
<P>May 10, in the 6th year of William and Mary, he was created marquis of Normanby, in the county of Lincoln. When it was debated in Par∣liament, whether the Prince of Orange should be proclaimed King, or the Princess his wife reign solely in her own right, he voted and spoke for the former, and gave these reasons for it. That he thought the title of either person was equal; and since the Parliament was to decide the matter, he judged it would much better please that Prince, who was now become their Protector, and was al∣so in itself a thing more becoming so good a Princess, as Queen Mary, to partake with her hus∣band a crown so obtained, than to possess it entire∣ly as her own. After long debates in Parliament, the crown at last was settled upon William and Mary. Burnet lord bishop of Salisbury, whose af∣fection for the revolution none I believe can doubt, freely acknowledges that the King was resolved not to hold the government by right of his wife; he would not think of holding any thing by a∣pron strings:' he was jealous of the friends of his wife, and never forgave them; and, last of all, he threatened to leave them in the lurch, that is, to retire to Holland, with his Dutch army; so restless, says Mulgrave in another place, is ambition, in its highest scenes of success.</P>
<P>During the reign of King William however, he enjoyed some considerable posts, and was generally pretty well in his favour, and con∣fidence. April 21, 1702, he was sworn Lord Pri∣vy Seal, and the same year appointed one of the commissioners to treat of an union between Eng∣land and Scotland, and was made Lord Lieute∣nant, and Custos Rotulorum for the North Rid∣ing
<PB N="294" REF="297"/>
of Yorkshire, and one of the governors of the Charterhouse.</P>
<P>March 9, 1703, he was created duke of Nor∣manby, having been made marquis of Normanby by King William, and on the 19th of the same m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nth duke of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uckingham.

<P>In 1710 the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hig ministry began to lose ground, and Mr. Harley, since earl of Oxford, and the Lord Treasurer made the proper use of those cir∣cumstances, yet wanting some assistance, applied to the duke of Buckingham. The duke, who was not then on good terms with Mr. Harley, at first slighted his proposal, but afterwards joined with him and others, which produced a revolution in the ministry, and shook the power of the duke and duchess of Marlborough, while Mr. Harley, the earl of Shrewsbury, lord Bolingbroke, &amp;c. came into the administration. The duke was attached to Tory principles. Her Majesty offered to make him chancellor, which he thought proper to refuse. He was out of employment for some time, during which, he did not so much as pay his compliments at court, 'till he married his third wife, and then went to kiss her Majesty's hand.</P>
<P>The duke of Buckingham, though reckoned haughty, and ill natured, was yet of a tender, com∣passionate disposition; but as the best charac∣ters have generally some allay, he is allowed to have been very passionate; but after his warmth sub∣sided, he endeavoured to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one for it by acts of kind∣ness and beneficence to those upon whom his passion had vented itself. Several years before his grace died, he was well known to have expressed some con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ern for the libertinism of his youth, especially regarding the fair sex, in which he had indulged
<PB N="295" REF="298"/>
himself very freely. He was survived only by one legitimate son, but left several natural children;</P>
<P>Our noble author has been charged by some of his enemies, with the sordid vice of covetousness, but without foundation; for, as a strong indication that he was not avaritious, he lost a considerab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e part of his fortune, merely by not taking the pains to visit, during the space of 40 years, his estates at some distance from London; and whoever is acquainted with human nature knows, that indo∣lence and covetousness are incompatible.</P>
<P>His grace died the 24th of February 1720, in the 75th year of his age, and after lying in state for some days at Buckingham-House, was car∣ried from thence with great funeral solemnity, and interred in Westminster-Abbey, where a monument is erected to his memory, upon which the follow∣ing epitaph is engraved, by his own direction, as appears from a passage in his will. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Since some∣thing is usually written on monuments, I direct that the following lines shall be put on mine, viz.<P>'In one place.<Q>' Pro Rege saepe, pro Republica semper.</Q></P>

Edmund, the duke's eldest son, already mentioned, was snatched away in his bloom; a youth from whom the greatest things might have been expected, as he was untainted with the vices of the age: he was very remarkable for his modesty, which vulgar minds imputed to want of powers, but those who knew him best, have given a different testimony concerning him, and have represented him as pos∣sessed of all the genius of his father, with more strict and inviolable morals. With this young no∣bleman the titles of the Sheffield family expired.</P>
<P>The duke, his father, informs us of a duel he was to have fought with the witty earl of Ro∣chester, which he thus relates; after telling us that the cause of the quarrel happened be∣tween the first and second Dutch war. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I was inform'd (says his grace) that the earl of Ro∣chester had said something very malicious of me; I therefore sent colonel Aston, a very met∣tled friend of mine, to call him to account for it; he denied the words, and indeed I was soon convinced he had never said them. But a mere report, though I found it to be false, obliged me (as I then foolishly thought) to go on with the quarrel; and the next day was appointed for us to fight on horseback: a way in England a little unusual, but it was his part to chuse. Ac∣cordingly I and my second lay the night before at Knightsbridge privately, to avoid being se∣cured at London on any suspicion, which we found ourselves more in danger of there, because we had all the appearance of highwaymen, that had a mind to lye skulking in an odd inn for one night. In the morning we met the lord Rochester at the place appointed, who, instead of James Porter, whom he assured Aston he would make his second, brought an errant life∣guard-man, whom nobody knew. To this Mr.
<PB N="297" REF="300"/>
Aston took exception, as being no suitable ad∣versary, especially considering how extremely well he was mounted, whereas we had only a couple of pads; upon which we all agreed to fight on foot. But as my lord Rochester and I were rid∣ing into the next field in order to it, he told me that he had at first chosen to fight on horse∣back, because he was so weak with a certain distemper, that he found himself unfit to fight at all any way, much less a foot. I was extreme∣ly surprized, because no man at that time had a better reputation for courage; and my anger a∣gainst him being quite subsided, I took the liber∣ty to represent to him what a ridiculous story it would make, should we return without fighting; and told him, that I must in my own defence be obliged to lay the fault on him, by telling the truth of the matter. His answer was, that he submitted to it, and hoped I would not take the advantage in having to do with any man in so weak a condition: I replied, that by such an argument he had sufficiently tied my hands, up∣on condition, I might call our seconds to be witnesses of the whole business, which he con∣sented to, and so we parted. Upon our return to London, we found it full of this quarrel, upon our being absent so long; and therefore Mr. As∣ton thought fit to write down every word and circumstance of this whole matter, in order to spread every where the true reason of our re∣turning without having fought; which being not in the least contradicted, or resented by the lord Rochester, entirely ruined his reputation for cou∣rage, though nobody had still a greater as to wit, which supported him pretty well in the world, notwithstanding some more accidents of the same kind, that never fail to succeed one another, when once people know a man's weak∣ness.'</Q></P>

The duke of Buckingham's works speak him a beautiful prose writer, and a very considerable poet, which is proved by the testimony of som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the best writers, his cotemporaries.</P>
<P>His prose works consist chiefly of</P>
<P>Historical Memoirs, Speeches in Parliament, Characters. Dialogues, Critical Observations, Speeches and Essays, which, with his poetical compositions, were printed by Alderman Barber in 1723. in two splendid 4to volumes. The first volume containing pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces in most species of poe∣try, the epic excepted, and also imitations from o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her authors. His Grace wrote some Epigrams, a great number of lyric pieces, some in the elegiac st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain, and others in the dramatic. Amongst his poems, an Essay on Poetry, which contains excel∣lent instructions to form the poet, is by far the most distinguished. He wrote a play called Julius Caesar and another called Brutus: or rather altered them from Shakespear.</P>
<P>His grace was a great lover of the polite arts in general, as appears from the fondness he expresses for them in several parts of his works; particular∣ly Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture; of the two former he made several cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious collections, and his house, built under his direction in St. James's Park, speaks him not unacquainted with the lat∣ter. It would be superfluous to enumerate all the writers who have given testimony in his grace's fa∣vour as an author. Dryden in several of his De∣dications, while he expresses the warmth of his gra∣titude, fails not to convey the most amiable idea of his lordship, and represents him as a noble writer. He lived in friendship with that great po∣et, who has raised indelible monuments to his memory.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="302"/>
I shall add but one other testimony of his me∣rit, which if some should think unnecessary, yet it is pleasing; the lines are delightfully sweet and flowing. In his Miscellanies thus speaks Mr. Pope;<Q><L>' Muse 'tis enough, at length thy labour ends,</L>
<L>' And thou shalt live; for Buckingham com∣mends.</L>
<L>' Let crowds of critics now my verse assail,</L>
<L>' Let Dennis write, and nameless numbers rail.</L>
<L>' This more than pays whole years of thankless pain,</L>
<L>' Time, health, and fortune, are not lost in vain.</L>
<L>' Sheffield approves: consenting Phoebus bends;</L>
<L>' And I, and malice, from this hour are friends.'</L></Q></P>
<P>The two plays of Julius Caesar, which he altered from Shakespear, are both with Chorusses, after the manner of the Ancients: These plays were to have been performed in the year 1729, and all the Chorusses were set to music by that great master in composition, Signor Bononcini; but English voices being few, the Italians were applied to, who demanded more for their nightly performance, than the receipts of the house could amount to at the usual raised prices, and on that account the de∣sign was dropt.</P>
<P>It appears that our noble author had conceived a great regard for Mr. Pope, on his earliest ap∣pearance in the literary world; and was among the first to acknowledge the young bard's merit, in commendatory verses upon his excellence in poetry. The following compliment from the duke is pre∣fixed to the first volume of Mr. Pope's works.<Q><PB N="300" REF="303"/>On Mr. POPE, and his POEMS, by his Grace JOHN SHEFFIELD, Duke of BUCKINGHAM.

<HEAD>CHARLES COTTON, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS ingenious gentleman lived in the reigns of Charles and James II. He resided for a great part of his life at Beresford in the county of Stafford. He had some reputation for lyric po∣etry, but was particularly famous for burlesque verse. He translated from the French Monsieur Corneille's Horace, printed in 4to. London 1671, and dedicated to his dear sister Mrs. Stanhope Hutchinson. This play was first finished in 1665, but in his prefatory epistle he tells us, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that nei∣ther at that time, nor for several years after, was it intended for the public view, it being written for the private divertisement of a fair young lady, and, ever since it had the honour first to kiss her hands, was so entirely hers, that the author did not reserve so much as the Brouillon to himself; however, she being prevailed upon, though with some difficulty, it was printed in 8vo. 1670.'</Q> As to the merit of this play in the origi∣nal, it is sufficient to observe, that the critics have allowed it to be the best tragedy of Corneille, and the author himself is of the same opinion, provid∣ed the three last acts had been equal to the two first. As to the translation by Mr. Cotton, we have very considerable authority to pronounce it better than that of Mrs. Katherine Philips, who could not number versification among her qualities. The plot of this play, so far as history is concerned, may be

read in Livy, Florus, Dionysius Halicarnasseus, &amp;c. Our stage has lately had a play founded up∣on this story, added to the many it has received, called the Roman Father, by Mr. W. Whitehead.</P>
<P>Besides this translation, Mr. Cotton is author of many other works, such as his poem called the Won∣ders of the Peak, printed in 8vo. London 1681<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. . Cotton's works are printed together in one volumo, 12mo. The thirteenth edition is dated 1751.</NOTE>. His burlesque Poem, called Scarronides, or Virgil Travestie, a mock Poem, on the first and fourth Books of Virgil's Aeneid, printed in 8vo. London 1678. Though the title seems to imply as if his poem was in imitation of Scarron, who has tran∣slated eight books of Virgil in the same manner, yet they who will compare both these pieces, will possibly find, that he has not only exceeded the French, but all those who have made any attempts on that kind of poetry, the incomparable author of Hudibras excepted. Mr. Cotton likewise translated several of Lucian's Dialogues into burlesque verse, printed in 8vo. London 1675, under the title of the Scoffer Scoff'd. In 1689 a volume of poems, with Mr. Cotton's name prefixed, was published in London: on these poems colonel Lovelace, Sir Aston Cockaine, Ro∣bert Harrick, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and Mr. Alexander Brome, complimented the author by copies of verses pre∣fixed; but Mr. Langbain observes, that the truest picture of Mr. Cotton's mind is to be seen in a little piece published at the end of these poems called Retirement; but the chief of Mr. Cotton's production, seems to be his translation of Mon∣taigne's Essays, dedicated to George Lord Saville, Marquis of Hallifax; his lordship in a letter to him, thus expresses his esteem for the translator, and admiration of his performance. This letter is print∣ed amongst the other pieces of the marquis's in a thin 12mo.<LETTER>

<HEAD>The Right Honourable JOSEPH ADDISON, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS elegant writer, to whom the world owes so many obligations, was born at Mil∣ton near Ambrosbury in the county of Wilts (of which place his father, Mr. Lancelot Addison, was then rector) on the 6th of May 1672; and be∣ing not thought likely to live, was baptized on the same day, as appears from the church register. When he grew up to an age fit for going to school, he was put under the care of the rev. Mr. Naish at Ambrosbury. He afterwards removed to a school at Salisbury, taught by the rev. Mr. Taylor, thence to the Charter-house, where he was under the tuition of the learned Dr. Ellis, and where he contracted an intimacy with Mr. Steel, afterwards Sir Richard, which continued as long as Mr. Ad∣dison lived. He was not above fifteen years old when he was entered of Queen's College, Oxford, in which his father had been placed: where he applied himself so closely to the study of classical learning, that in a very short time he became master of a very elegant Latin stile, even before he arrived at that age when ordinary scholars begin to write good English.</P>
<P>In the year 1687 a copy of his verses in that tongue fell into the hands of Dr. Lancaster dean of Magdalen College, who was so pleased with them, that he immediately procured their author's election into that house<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tickell's Preface to Addison's works.</NOTE>; where he took the de∣grees
<PB N="306" REF="309"/>
of bachelor, and master of arts. In the course of a few years his Latin poetry was justly admired at both the universities, and procured him great reputation there, before his name was so much as known in London. When he was in the 22d year of his age, he published a copy of verses addressed to Mr. Dryden, which soon procured him the no∣tice of some of the poetical judges in that age. The verses are not without their elegance, but if they are much removed above common rhimes, they fall infinitely short of the character Mr. Addi∣son's friends bestowed upon them. Some little space intervening, he sent into the world a translation of the 4th Georgic of Virgil, of which we need not say any more, than that it was commended by Mr. Dryden. He wrote also that discourse on the Georgics, prefixed to them by way of preface in Mr. Dryden's translation, and chose to with∣hold his name from that judicious composition, be∣cause it contained an untried strain of cri∣ticism, which bore hard upon the old professors of that art, and therefore was not so fit for a young man to take upon himself; and Mr. Dryden, who was above the meanness of fathering any one's work, owns the Essay on the Georgics to have come from a friend, whose name is not mentioned, because he desired to have it concealed.</P>
<P>The next year Mr. Addison wrote several poems of different kinds; amongst the rest, one addressed to Henry Sacheverel, who became afterwards so exceedingly famous. The following year he wrote a poem to King William on one of his Campaigns, addressed to the Lord Keeper (Sir John Somers.) That excellent statesman received this mark of a young author's attachment with great humanity, admitted Mr. Addison into the number of his friends, and gave him on all occasions distinguish∣ing proofs of a sincere esteem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tickell. Ubi supra.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="310"/>
While he was at the university, he had been pressingly sollicited to enter into holy orders, which he seemed once resolved on, probably in obedi∣ence to his father's authority; but being conscious of the importance of the undertaking, and de∣terred by his extreme modesty, he relinquished, says Mr. Tickell, all views that way; but Sir Ri∣chard Steel in his letter to Mr. Congreve prefixed to the Drummer, who had a quarrel with Tickell, on account of an injurious treatment of him, says, that those were not the reasons which made Mr. Addison turn his thoughts to the civil world, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'and as you were the inducement (says he) of his be∣coming acquainted with my lord Hallifax, I doubt not but you remember the warm instances that noble lord made to the head of the college, not to insist on Mr. Addison's going into orders; his arguments were sounded on the general pra∣vity and corruption of men of business, who wanted liberal education; and I remember, as if I had read the letter yesterday, that my lord end∣ed with a compliment, that however he might be represented as no friend to the church, he would never do it any other injury than by keeping Mr. Addison out of it.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Addison having discovered an inclination to travel, the abovementioned patron, out of zeal, as well to his country, as our author, procured him from the crown an annual pension of 300 l. which enabled him to make a tour to Italy the latter end of 1699. His Latin poems dedicated to Mr. Montague, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, were printed before his departure, in the Musae Angli∣canae, and were as much esteemed in foreign countries, as at home, particularly by that noble wit of France, Boileau. It is from Mr. Tickell we learn this circumstance in relation to Boileau, and we shall present it to the reader in his own words; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'his country owes it to Mr. Addison, that
<PB N="308" REF="311"/>
the famous Monsieur Boileau first conceived an opinion of the English genius for poetry, by pe∣rusing the present he made him of the Musae Anglicanae. It has been currently reported, that this famous French poet, among the civilities he shewed Mr. Addison on that occasion, affirmed, that he would not have written against Perrault, had he before seen such excellent pieces by a modern hand. The compliment he meant, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that these books had given him a very new idea of the English politeness, and that he did not question, but there were excellent comp sitions in the native language of a country, which pos∣sessed the Roman genius in so eminent a degree.'</Q> In 1701 Mr. Addison wrote an epistolary poem from Italy to lord Hallifax, which is much ad∣mired as a finished piece in its kind, and indeed some have pronounced it the best of Mr. Addison's performances. It was translated by the Abbot An∣tonio Mario Salvini, Greek Professor at Florence into Italian verse, which translation is printed with the original in Mr. Tickell's 4to. edition of Mr. Addison's works. This poem is in the high∣est esteem in Italy, because there are in it the best turned compliments on that country, that, perhaps, are to be found any where: and the Italians, on ac∣count of their familiarity with the objects it describes, must have a higher relish of it. This poem like∣wise shews his gratitude to lord Hallifax, who had been that year impeached by the Commons in Parliament, for procuring exorbitant grants from the crown to his own use; and further charged with cutting down, and wasting the timber in his Majesty's forests, and with holding several offices in his Majesty's Exchequer, that were inconsistent, and designed as checks upon each other: The Commons had likewise addressed the King to re∣move him from his councils, and presence for ever. These were the causes of his retiring, and Mr. Ad∣dison's
<PB N="309" REF="312"/>
address at this time, was a noble instance of his fidelity, and stedfastness to his friends.</P>
<P>On his return to England, he published an ac∣count of his travels, dedicated to lord Somers; he would have returned earlier than he did, had not he been thought of as a proper person to attend prince Eugene, who then commanded for the emperor in Italy, which employment would much have pleased him; but the death of king William intervening caused a cessation of his pension and his hopes.</P>
<P>For a considerable space of time he remained at home, and as his friends were out of the ministry, he had no opportunity to display his abilities, or to meet a competent reward for the honour his works had already done his country. He owed both to an accident: In the year 1704 lord treasurer Godolphin happened to complain to the lord Halli∣fax, that the duke of Marlborough's victory at Blenheim, had not been celebrated in verse, in the manner it deserved, and told him, that he would take it kind, if his lordship, who was the patron of the poets, would name a gentleman capable of writing upon so elevated a subject. Lord Hallifax replied with some quickness, that he was well ac∣quainted with such a person, but that he would not name him; and observed, that he had long seen with indignation, men of little or no merit, main∣tained in pomp and luxury, at the expence of the public, while persons of too much modesty, with great abilities, languished in obscurity. The trea∣surer answered, very cooly, that he was sorry his lordship had occasion to make such an observation; but that in the mean time, he would engage his honour, that whoever his lordship should name, might venture upon this theme, without fear of losing his time. Lord Hallifax thereupon named Mr. Addison, but insisted the treasurer should send to him himself, which he promised. Accordingly he prevailed upon Mr. Boyle, then chancellor of the
<PB N="310" REF="313"/>
exchequer, to go in his name to Mr. Addison, and communicate to him the business, which he did in so obliging a manner, that he readily entered upon the task<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Budgel's Memoirs of the Boyles.</NOTE>. The lord treasurer saw the Poem before it was finished, when the author had written no far∣ther than the celebrated simile of the Angel, and was so much pleased with it, that he immediately made him commissioner of appeals, in the room of Mr. Locke, who was promoted to be one of the lords commissioners for trade, &amp;c.</P>
<P>His Poem, entitled the Campaign, was received with loud and general applause: It is addressed to the duke of Marlborough, and contains a short view of the military transactions in the year 1704, and a very particular description of the two great actions at Schellemberg and Blenheim.</P>
<P>In 1705 Mr. Addison attended the lord Hallifax to Hanover; and in the succeeding year he was made choice of for under-secretary to Sir Charles Hedges, then appointed secretary of state. In the month of December, in the same year, the earl of Sunderland, who succeeded Sir Charles in that office, continued Mr. Addison in the post of under secretary.</P>
<P>Operas being now much in fashion, many people of distinction and true taste, importuned him to make a trial, whether sense and sound were really so incompatible, as some admirers of the Italian pieces would represent them. He was at last pre∣vailed upon to comply with their request, and composed his Rosamond: This piece was inscribed to the duchess of Marlborough, and met with but indifferent success on the stage. Many looked upon it as not properly an Opera; for considering what numbers of miserable productions had born that title, they were scarce satisfied that so superior a piece should appear under the same denomination About
<PB N="311" REF="314"/>
this time our author assisted Sir Richard Steel, in a play called the Tender Husband; to which he wrote a humorous Prologue. Sir Richard, whose gratitude was as warm and ready as his wit, surprized him with a dedication, which may be considered as one of the few monuments of praise, not unworthy the great person to whose honour it was raised.</P>
<P>In 1709 he went over to Ireland, as secretary to the marquis of Wharton, appointed lord lieutenant of that kingdom. Her majesty also, was pleased, as a mark of her peculiar favour, to augment the sa∣lary annexed to the keeper of the records in that nation, and bestow it upon him. While he was in Ireland, his friend Sir Richard Steel published the Tatler, which appeared for the first time, on the 12th of April 1709: Mr. Addison (says Tickell) discovered the author by an observation on Virgil he had communicated to him. This discovery led him to afford farther assistance, insomuch, that as the author of the Tatler well exprest it, he fared by this means, like a distrest prince, who calls in a powerful neighbour to his aid: that is, he was un∣done by his auxiliary.</P>
<P>The superiority of Mr. Addison's papers in that work is universally admitted; and being more at leisure upon the change of the ministry, he continued assisting in the Tatler till 1711, when it was dropt.</P>
<P>No sooner was the Tatler laid down, but Sir Richard Steel, in concert with Mr. Addison, formed the plan of the Spectator. The first paper appeared on the first of March 1711, and in the course of that great work, Mr. Addison furnished all the pa∣pers marked with any Letters of the Muse CLIO; and which were generally most admired. Tickell, who had no kindness for Sir Richard Steel, meanly supposes that he marked his paper out of precaution against Sir Richard; which was an ill-natur'd in∣sinuation; for in the conclusion of the Spectators, he acknowledges to Mr. Addison, all he had a right
<PB N="312" REF="315"/>
to; and in his letter to Congreve, he declares that Addison's papers were marked by him, out of tenderness to his friend, and a warm zeal for his fame. Steel was a generous grateful friend; it therefore ill became Mr. Tickell in the defence of Mr. Addison's honour, which needed no such stra tagem, to depreciate one of his dearest friends; and at the expence of truth, and his reputation, raise the character of his Hero. Sir Richard had opposed Mr. Addison, in the choice of Mr. Tickell as his secretary; which it seems he could never forget nor forgive.</P>
<P>In the Spectators, Sir Roger de Coverly was Mr. Addison's favourite character; and so tender was he of it, that he went to Sir Richard, upon his pub∣lishing a Spectator, in which he made Sir Roger pick up a woman in the temple cloisters, and would not part with his friend, until he promised to meddle with the old knight's character no more. However, Mr. Addison to make sure, and to prevent any ab∣surdities the writers of the subsequent Spectators might fall into, resolved to remove that character out of the way; or, as he pleasantly expressed it to an intimate friend, killed Sir Roger, that no body else might murther him. When the old Spectator was finished, a new one appeared; but, though written by men of wit and genius, it did not succeed, and they were wise enough not to push the attempt too far. Posterity must have a high idea of the taste and good sense of the British nation, when they are informed, that twenty-thousand of these papers were sometimes sold in a day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tickell's Preface.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Guardian, a paper of the same tendency, entertained the town in the years 1713 and 1714, in which Mr. Addison had likewise a very large share; he also wrote two papers in the Lover.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="316"/>
In the year 1713 appeared his famous Cato. He entered into a design of writing a Tragedy on that subject, when he was very young; and when he was on his travels he actually wrote four acts of it: However, he ret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uched it on his return, with∣out any design of bringing it on the stage; but some friends of his imagining it might be of service to the cause of liberty, he was prevailed upon to finish it for the theatre, which he accordingly did. When this play appeared, it was received with boundless admiration; and during the representation on the first night, on which its fate depended, it is said that Mr. Addison discovered uncommon timi∣dity; he was agitated between hope and fear, and while he remained retired in the green-room, he kept a person continually going backwards and forwards, from the stage to the place where he was, to inform him how it succeeded, and till the whole was over, and the success confirmed, he never ventured to move.</P>
<P>When it was published, it was recommended by many Copies of Verses prefixed to it, amongst which the sincerity of Mr. Steele, and the genius of Eusden, deserve to be distinguished: But, as I would not omit any particulars relative to this renowned play, and its great author, I shall insert a letter of Mr. Pope's to Sir William Turnbull, dated the 30th of April 1713, in which are some circumstances that merit commemoration.</P>

Rome in his Days, as he is of Britain in ours; and though all the foolish industry possible had been used to make it thought a party play, yet what the author once said of another, may the most properly in the world be applied to him on this occasion.<Q><L>Envy itself is dumb, in wonder lost,</L>
<L>And factions strive who shall applaud him most.</L></Q> 'The numerous and violent claps of the Whig party, on the one side of the theatre, were eccho∣ed back by the Tories on the other; while the author sweated behind the scenes, with concern to find their applause proceeding more from the hard than the head. This was the case too with the Prologue writer, who was clapp'd into a staunch Whig at the end of every two lines. I believe you have heard, that after all the applauses of the opposite faction, my lord Bolingbroke sent for Booth, who played Cato, into the box, between one of the acts, and presented him with fifty guineas, in acknowledgment as he expressed it, for defending the cause of liberty so well against a perpetual dictator. The Whigs are unwilling to be distanced this way, and therefore design a present to the same Cato very speedily; in the mean time, they are getting ready as good a sen∣tence as the former on their side, so betwixt them it is probable, that Cato (as Dr. Garth exprest it) may have something to live upon after he dies.'</Q></P>
</LETTER>
<P>Immediately after the publication of this Tra∣gedy, there came abroad a pamphlet, entitled, Observations on Cato; written by the ingeni∣ous Dr. Sewel: The design of this piece was to shew that the applause this Tragedy met with was founded on merit. It is a very accurate and
<PB N="315" REF="318"/>
entertaining criticism, and tends to secure the poet the hearts of his readers, as well as of his au∣dience. Our author was not however without ene∣mies, amongst whom was Mr. Dennis, who attacked it, first in a pamphlet, and then in a subsequent work, in which he employed seven letters in pulling it to pieces: In some of his remarks he is candid, and judicious enough, in others he is trifling and ill natur'd, and I think it is pretty plain he was agitated by e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vy; for as the intent of that play was to promote the Whig interest, of which Mr. Dennis was a zealous abettor, he could not therefore disesleem it from party princi∣ples. Another gentleman, who called himself a scholar at Oxford, considered the play in a very dif∣ferent light; and endeavoured to serve his party by turning the cannon upon the enemy. The title of this pamphlet is, Mr. Addison turned Tory: It is written with great spirit and vivacity. Cato was speedily translated into French by Mr. Boyer, but with no spirit: It was translated likewise into Italian.</P>
<P>Voltaire has commended, and condemned Mr. Addison by turns, and in respect to Cato, he ad∣mires, and censures it extravagantly. The princi∣pal character he allows superior to any before brought upon the stage, but says, that all the love∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enes are absolutely insipid: He might have added unnecessary, as to the plot; and the only reason that can be assigned for the poet's intro∣ducing them was, the prevalence of custom; but it must be acknowledged, that his lovers are the most sensible, and address each other in the best language, that is to be found in any love dialogues of the British stage: It will be difficult to find a more striking line, or more picturesque of a lover's passion, than this pathetic exclamation; <Q><PB N="316" REF="319"/>A lover does not live by vulgar time.</Q></P>
<P>Queen Anne was not the last in doing justice to our author and his performance; she was pleased to signify an inclination of having it dedicated to her, but as he intended that compliment to another, it came into the world without any de∣dication. If in the subsequent part of his life, his leisure had been greater, we are told, he would pro∣bably have written another tragedy on the death of Socrates; but the honours accruing from what he had already performed deprived posterity of that pro∣duction. This subject was still drier, and less sus∣ceptible of poetical ornament than the former, but in the hands of so great a writer, there is no doubt but genius would have supplied what was wanting in the real story, and have covered by shining sentiments, and noble language, the simplicity of the plot, and deficiency in busi∣ness.</P>
<P>Upon the death of the Queen, the Lords Justices appointed Mr. Addison their secretary. This diverted him from the design he had formed of composing an English Dictionary upon the plan of a famous Italian one: that the world has much suffered by this promotion I am ready to believe, and cannot but regret that our language yet wants the assistance of so great a master, in fixing its standard, settling its purity, and illustrating its copiousness, or elegance.</P>
<P>In 1716 our author married the countess of Warwick; and about that time published the Free∣holder, which is a kind of political Spectator. This work Mr. Addison conducted without any assistance, upon a plan of his own forming; he
<PB N="317" REF="320"/>
did it in consequence of his principles, out of a desire to remove prejudices, and contribute all he could to make his country happy; however it pro∣duced his own promotion, in 1717, to be one of the principal secretaries of state. His health, which had been before impaired by an asthmatic disorder, suffered exceedingly by an advancement so much to his honour, but attended with such great fatigue: Finding, that he was not able to manage so much business as his station led him to, he re∣signed, and in his leisure hours began a work of a religious nature, upon the Evidence of the Chri∣stian religion; which he lived not to finish. He likewise intended a Paraphrase on some of the Psalms of David: but a long and painful relapse broke all his designs, and deprived the world of one of its brightest ornaments, June 17, 1719, when he was entering the 54th year of his age. He died at Holland-house near Kensington, and left behind him an only daughter by the countess of Warwick.</P>
<P>After his decease, Mr. Tickell, by the au∣thority and direction of the author, collected, and published his works, in four volumes 4to. In this edition there are several pieces, as yet un∣mentioned, which I shall here give account of in order; the first is a Dissertation upon Medals, which, though not published 'till after his death, was begun in 1702, when he was at Vienna.</P>
<P>In 1707 there came abroad a pamphlet, under the title of The Present State of the War, and the Necessity of an Augmentation Considered. The Whig Examiner came out September 14 1710, for the first time: there were five papers in all at∣tributed to Mr. Addison; these are by much the tartest things he ever wrote; Dr. Sacheverel,
<PB N="318" REF="321"/>
Mr. Prior, and many other persons are severely treated. The Exam ner had done the same thing on the part of the Tories. and the avowed design of this paper was to make reprisals.</P>
<P>In the year 1713 was published a little pam∣phlet, called The Late Trial, and Conviction of Count Tariff; it was intended to expose the Tory ministry on the head of the French Commerce Bill: This is also a severe piece.</P>
<P>The following have likewise been ascribed to cur author;</P>
<P>Dissertatio de insignioribus Romanorum Poctis, i. e. A Dissertation upon the most Eminent Roman Poets: This is supposed to have been written about 1692.</P>
<P>A Discourse on Ancient and Modern Learning; the time when it was written is uncertain, but pro∣bably as early as the former. It was preserved a∣mongst the manuscripts of lord Somers, which, after the death of Sir Joseph Jekyl, being publickly sold, this little piece came to be printed 1739, and was well received. To these we must add the Old Whig, No. 1 and 2. Pamphlets written in Defence of the Peerage Eill: The scope of the Bill was this, that in place of 16 Peers sitting in Par∣liament, as Representatives of the Peerage of Scot∣land, there were for the future to be twenty five hereditary Peers, by the junction of nine out of the body of the Scotch nobility, to the then 16 sitting Peers; that six English Peers should be added, and the peerage then remain fixed; the crown being restrained from making any new lords, but upon the extinction of families. This gave a great
<PB N="319" REF="322"/>
alarm to the nation, and many papers were wrote with spirit against it; amongst the rest, one called the Plebeian, now known to have been Sir Ri∣chard Steele's. In answer to this came out the Old Whig No. 1. on the State of the Peerage, with some Remarks on the Plebeian. This controversy was c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rried on between the two friends, Addison and Steele, at first without any knowledge of one another, but before it was ended, it appears, from several expressions, that the author of the Old Whig was acquainted with his antagonist.</P>
<P>Thus we have gone through the most remark∣able passages of the life of this great man, in admiration of whom, it is but natural to be an Enthusiast, and whose very enemies expressed their dislike with diffidence; nor indeed were his ene∣mies, Mr. Pope excepted, (if it be proper to reckon Mr. Pope Mr. Addison's enemy) in one particular case, of any consequence. It is a true, and an old observation, that the greatest men have some∣times failings, that, of all other human weaknesses, one would not suspect them to be subject to. It is said of Mr. Addison, that he was a slave to flat∣tery, that he was jealous, and suspicious in his temper, and, as Pope keenly expresses it,<Q><L>Bore, like the Turk, no rival near the throne.</L></Q> That he was jealous of the fame of Pope, many have believed, and perhaps not altogether without ground. He preferred Tickel's translation of the first Book of Homer, to Pope's. His words are, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the other has more of Homer,'</Q> when, at the same time, in a letter to Pope, he strenuously advises him to undertake it, and tells him, there is none but he equal to it; which circumstance has made some
<PB N="320" REF="323"/>
people conjecture, that Addison was himself the author of the translation, imputed to Mr. Tickell: Be this as it may, it is unpleasing to dwell upon the failings, and quarrels of great men; let us rather draw a veil over all their errors, and only admire their virtues, and their genius; of both which the author, the incidents of whose life we have now been tracing, had a large possession. He added much to the purity of the English stile in prose; his rhime is not so flowing, nervous, or manly as some of his cotemporaries, but his prose has an original excellence, a smoothness and dignity peculiar to it. His poetry, as well as sen∣timents, in Cato, cannot be praised enough.</P>
<P>Mr. Addison was stedfast to his principles, faith∣ful to his friends, a zealous patriot, honourable in public stations, amiable in private life, and as he lived, he died, a good man, and a pious Christian.</P>

<HEAD>ANNE, Countess of WINCHELSEA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS lady, deservedly celebrated for her po∣etic genius, was daughter of Sir William Kingsmill of Sidmonton, in the county of South∣ampton. She was Maid of Honour to the Duchess of York, second wife to King James II. and was afterwards married to Heneage earl of Winchel∣sea, who was in his father's life-time Gentleman of the Bed-chamber to the Duke of York.</P>
<P>One of the most considerable of this lady's poems, is that upon the Spleen, published by Mr. Charles Gildon, 1701, in 8vo. That poem oc∣casioned another of Mr. Nicholas Rowe's, entitled an Epistle to Flavia, on the sight of two Pindaric Odes on the Spleen and Vanity, written by a Lady to her Friend. This poem of the Spleen is writ∣ten in stanzas, after the manner of Cowley, and contains many thoughts naturally expressed, and poetically conceived; there is seldom to be found any thing more excellently picturesque than this poem, and it justly entitles the amiable countess to hold a very high station amongst the inspired tribe. Nothing can be more happily imagined than the following description of the pretended in∣fluence of Spleen upon surly Husbands, and gay Coquetes.<Q><PB N="322" REF="325"/><L>Patron thou art of every gross abuse;</L>
<L>The sullen husband's feign'd excuse,</L>
<L>When the ill humours with his wife he spends,</L>
<L>And bears recruited wit, and spirits to his friends.</L>
<L>The son of Bacchus pleads thy pow'r</L>
<L>As to the glass he still repairs</L>
<L>Pretends but to remove thy cares,</L>

<L>And drown thy kingdom in a purple show'r.</L>
<L>When the coquette (whom ev'ry fool admires)</L>

<L>The cause indeed is a defect of sense,</L>
<L>Yet is the Spleen alledged, and still the dull pre∣tence.</L></Q></P>
<P>The influence which Spleen has over religious minds, is admirably painted in the next stanza.<Q><L>By spleen, religion, all we know</L>
<L>That should enlighten here below,</L>
<L>Is veiled in darkness, and perplext</L>

<P>A collection of this lady's poems was published at London 1713 in 8vo. containing likewise a Tra∣gedy never acted, entitled Aristomenes, or the Royal Shepherd. The general scenes are in Ari∣stomenes's camp, near the walls of Phaerea, some∣times the plains among the Shepherds. A great number of our authoress's poems still continue un∣published, in the hands of the rev. Mr. Creake, and some were in possession of the right hon. the countess of Hertford.</P>
<P>The countess of Winchelsea died August 9. 1720, without issue. She was happy in the friendship of Mr. Pope, who addresses a copy of verses to her, occasioned by eight lines in the Rape of the Lock: they contain a very ele∣gant compliment.<Q><L>In vain you boast poetic names of yore,</L>
<L>And cite those Saphoes we admire no more:</L>
<L>Fate doom'd the fall of ev'ry female wit,</L>
<L>But doom'd it then, when first Ardelia writ.</L>

<L>E'en while you write, you take that praise away:</L>
<L>Light to the stars, the sun does thus restore,</L>
<L>And shines himself 'till they are seen no more.</L></Q></P>
<P>The answer which the countess makes to the a∣bove, is rather more exquisite than the lines of Mr. Pope; he is foil'd at his own weapons, and outdone in the elegance of compliment.<Q><PB N="324" REF="327"/><L>Disarm'd with so genteel an air,</L>

<HEAD>CHARLES GILDON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was born at Gillingham near Shaftshury, in the county of Dorset. His parents, and family were all of the Romish persuasion, but they could not instil their principles into our author, who, as soon as he began to reason, was able to discover the errors, and foppery of that church. His father was a member of the society of Grays-Inn, and suf∣fered much for the Royal cause. The first rudi∣ments of learning Mr. Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>don had at the place of his nativity; thence his relations sent him to the English college of secular priests at Doway in Hainault, with a design of making him a priest; but after five years study there, he found his incli∣nation direct him to a quite different course of life. When he was nineteen years old he returned to England, and as soon as he was of age, and ca∣pable of enjoying the pleasures of gaiety, he came to Londos, where he spent the greatest part of his paternal estate. At about the age of twenty∣three, to crown his other imprudences, he married, without improving his reduced circumstances thereby.</P>
<P>During the reign of King James II. he dedi∣cated his time to the st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy of the prevailing con∣troversies, and he s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mewhere declares, it cost him above seven years close application to books, be∣fore he could entirely overcome the prejudices of his education. He never believed the absurd
<PB N="327" REF="330"/>
tenets of the church of Rome; nor could he em∣brace the ridiculous doctrine of her infallibility: But as he had been taught an early reverence to the priesthood, and a submissive obedience to their authority, it was a long while before he assumed courage to think freely for himself, or declare what he thought.</P>
<P>His first attempt in the drama, was not till he had arrived at his 32d year; and he himself in his essays tells us, that necessity (the general induce∣ment) was his first motive of venturing to be an author.</P>
<P>He is the author of three plays, viz.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Roman Bride's Revenge, a Tragedy; acted at the Theatre-Royal 1697. This play was written in a month, and had the usual success of hasty productions, though the first and second acts are well written, and the catastrophe beautiful; the moral being to give us an example, in the punish∣ment of Martian, that no consideration ought to make us delay the service of our country.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Phaeton, or the Fatal Divorce; a Tragedy, acted at the Theatre-Royal 1698, dedicated to Charles Montague, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> This play is written in imitation of the ancients, with some reflexions on a book called a Short View of the Immorality of the English Stage, written by Mr. Collier, a Non∣juring Clergyman, who combated in the cause of virtue, with success, against Dryden, Congreve, Dennis, and our author. The plot of this play, and a great many of the beauties, Mr. Gildon owns in his preface, he has taken from the Medea of Euripides.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Love's Victim, or the Queen of Wales; a Tragedy, acted at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.</ITEM>

<P><PB N="328" REF="331"/>
He introduced the Play called the Younger Bro∣ther, or the Amorous Jilt; written by Mrs. Behn, but not brought upon the stage 'till after her de∣cease. He made very little alteration in it. Our author's plays have not his name to them; and his fault lies generally in the stile, which is too near an imitation of Lee's.</P>
<P>He wrote a piece called the New Rehearsal, or Bays the Younger; containing an Examen of the Ambitious Step-mother, Tamerlane, The Biter, Fair Penitent, The Royal Convert, Ulysses, and Jane Shore, all written by Mr. Rowe; also a Word or Two on Mr. Pope's Rape of the Lock, to which is prefixed a Preface concerning Criticism in ge∣neral, by the Earl of Shaftsbury, Author of the Characteristics, 8vo. 1714. Scene the Rose Ta∣vern. The freedom he used with Mr. Pope in re∣marking upon the Rape of the Lock, it seems was sufficient to raise that gentleman's resentment, who was never celebrated for forgiving. Many years after, Mr. Pope took his revenge, by stigmatizing him as a dunce, in his usual keen spirit of satire: There had arisen some quarrel between Gildon and Dennis, upon which, Mr. Pope in his Dunciad, B. iii. has the following lines,<Q><L>Ah Dennis! Gildon ah! what ill-starr'd rage</L>
<L>Divides a friendship long confirm'd by age?</L>

<P>Mr. Gildon died on the 12th of January 1723, and in the words of Boyer's Political State, vol. xxvii. p. 102. we shall sum up his character. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'On Sunday, January 12, died Mr. Charles Gildon, a person of great literature, but a mean genius; who having attempted several kinds of writing, never gained much reputation in any. Among other treatises, he wrote the English Art of Poetry, which he had practised himself very unsuccessfully in his dramatic performances. He also wrote an English Grammar, but what he seemed to build his chief hopes of fame up∣on, was, his late Critical Commentary on the Duke of Buckingham's Essay on Poetry, which last piece was perused, and highly approved, by his grace.'</P></Q></P>

<HEAD>THOMAS D'URFEY,</HEAD>
<P>WAS born in the county of Devon, and was first bred to the law; but we have not heard from what samily he was descended, nor in what year he was born. He has written upwards of thirty plays, with various success, but had a genius better turned to a ballad, and little irregu∣lar odes, than for dramatic poetry. He soon for∣sook the prosession of the law, and threw himself upon the public, by writing for the stage.—That D'Urfey was a man of some abilities, and enjoyed the esteem and friendship of men of the greatest parts in his time, appears from the favourable testimony of the author of the Guardian: And as the design of this work is to collect, and throw into one view, whatever may be found concerning any poet of eminence in various books, and literary records, we shall make no scru∣ple of transcribing what that ingenious writer has humorously said concerning our author.</P>
<P>In Numb. 29. Vol. 1. speaking of the advan∣tages of laughing, he thus mentions D'Urfey. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'A judicious author, some years since published a collection of Sonnets, which he very successfully called Laugh and be Fat; or Pills to purge Melancholy: I cannot sufficiently admire the facetious title of these volumes, and must censure the world of ingratitude, while they are so neg∣ligent

in rewarding the jocose labours of my friend Mr. D'Urfey, who was so large a contributor to this Treatise, and to whose humorous pro∣ductions, so many rural squires in the remotest parts of this island are obliged, for the dignity and state which corpulency gives them. It is my opinion, that the above pills would be extremely proper to be taken with Asses milk, and might contribute towards the renewing and restoring decayed lungs.'</Q></P>
<P>Numb. 67. He thus speaks of his old friend.—<Q REND="inline">'It has been remarked, by curious observers, that poets are generally long lived, and run beyond the usual age of man, if not cut off by some accident, or excess, as Anacreon, in the midst of a very merry old age, was choaked with a grape stone. The same redundancy of spirits that produces the poetical flame, keeps up the vital warmth, and ad∣ministers uncommon fuel to life. I question not but several instances will occur to my reader's me∣mory, from Homer down to Mr. Dryden; I shall only take notice of two who have excelled in Lyrics, the one an antient, the other a modern. The first gained an immortal reputation by celebrating seve∣ral jockeys in the Olympic Games; the last has signalized himself on the same occasion, by the Ode that begins with—To horse brave boys, to New-market, to horse. The reader will by this time know, that the two poets I have mentioned are Pindar, and Mr. D'Urfey. The former of these is long since laid in his urn, after having many years together endeared himself to all Greece, by his tune∣ful compositions. Our countryman is still living, and in a blooming old age, that still promises many musical productions; for if I am not mistaken our British Swan will sing to the last. The best judges, who have perused his last Song on the moderate Man, do not discover any decay in his parts; but
<PB N="333" REF="336"/>
think it deserves a place among the finest of those works, with which he obliged the world in his more early years.<P>'I am led into this subject, by a visit which I lately received from my good old friend and cotem∣porary. As we both flourished together in king Charles the IId's reign, we diverted ourselves with the remembrance of several particulars that pass'd in the world, before the greatest part of my readers were born; and could not but smile to think how insensibly we were grown into a couple of venerable old gentlemen. Tom observed to me, that after having written more Odes than Horace, and about four times as many Comedies as Terence; he was reduced to great difficulties, by the importunities of a set of men, who of late years had furnished him with the acccommodations of life, and would not, as we say, be paid with a song. In order to ex∣tricate my old friend, I immediately sent for the three directors of the Play-house, and desired they would in their turn, do a good office for a man, who in Shakespear's phrase, often filled their mouths; I mean with pleasantry and popular conceits. They very generously listened to my proposal, and agreed to act the Plotting Sisters (a very taking play of my old friends composing) on the 15th of next month, for the benefit of the author.</P>
<P>'My kindness to the agreeable Mr. D'Urfey, will be imperfect, if, after having engaged the players in his favour, I do not get the town to come into it. I must therefore heartily recommend to all the young ladies my disciples, the case of my old friend, who has often made their grand-mothers merry; and whose Sonnets have perhaps lulled asleep many a present toast, when she lay in her cradle. The gentleman I am speaking of, has laid obligations on so many of his countrymen, that I
<PB N="334" REF="337"/>
hope they will think this but a just return to the good service of a vet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ran Poet.</P>
<P>'I myself, remember king Charles the IId. lean∣ing on Tom D'Urfey's shoulder more than once, and humming over a song with him. It is certain, that monarch was not a little supported, by joy to great Caesar; which gave the Whigs such a blow, as they were not able to recover that whole reign. My friend afterwards attacked Popery, with the same saccess, having exposed Bel armine, and Porto∣carero, more than once, in short satirical compo∣sitions, which have been in every body's mouth. He made use of Italian Tunes and Sonato's, for promoting the Protestant interest; and turned a considerable part of the Pope's music against him∣self. In short, he has obliged the court with poli∣tical S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnets; the country with Dialogues, and Pastorals; the city with Descriptions of a lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Mayor's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>east; not to mention his little Ode upon Stool-Ball; with many others of the like nature.</P>
<P>'Should the very individuals he has celebrated, make their appearance together, they would be sufficient to fill the play-house. Pretty Peg of Windsor, Gilian of Croydon; with Dolly and Molly; and Tommy and Johny; with many others to be met with in the musical Miscellanies, would make a great benefit.</P>
<P>'As my friend, after the manner of the old Lyrics, accompanies his works with his own voice; he has been the delight of the most polite companies and conversations, from the beginning of king Charles the IId's reign, to our own times: Many an honest gentleman has got a reputation in his country, by pretending to have been in company with Tom D'Urfey.</P>
<P>'I might here mention several other merits in my friend, as his enriching our langauge with a multi∣tade of rhimes, and bringing words together, that without his good offices, would never have been
<PB N="335" REF="338"/>
acquainted with one another, so long as it had been a tongue; but I must not omit that my old friend angled for a trout, the best of any man in England.</P>
<P>'After what I have said, and much more that I might say, on this subject, I question not but the world will think that my old friend ought not to pass the remainder of his life in a cage, like a singing bird; but enjoy all that Pindaric liberty, which is suitable to a man of his genius. He has made the world merry, and I hope they will make him easy, as long as he stays amongst us. This I will take upon me to say, they cannot do a kindness, to a more diverting companion, or a more chearful, honest, good-natur'd man.'—</P></Q></P>
<P>The same author, Numb. 82. puts his readers in mind when D Urfey's benefit came on, of some other circumstances favourable to him. <Q REND="inline">'The Plotting Sisters, says he, is this day to be acted for the be∣nefit of the author, my old friend Mr. D'Urfey. This comedy was honoured with the presence of King Charles II. three of the first five nights. My friend has in this work shewn himself a master, and made not only the characters of the play, but al∣so the furniture of the house contribute to the main design. He has made excellent use of a table with a carpet, and the key of a closet; with these two implements, which would perhaps have been over∣looked by an ordinary writer, he contrives the most natural perplexities (allowing only the use of these houshold goods in poetry) that ever were repre∣sented on a stage. He also made good advantage of the knowledge of the stage itself; for in the nick of being surprized, the lovers are let down, and escape at a trap door. In a word, any who have the curiosity to observe what pleased in the last generation, and does not go to a comedy with a r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>solution to be grave, will find this evening am∣ple
<PB N="336" REF="339"/>
food for mirth. Johnson, who understands what he does as well as any man, exposes the imperti∣nence of an old fellow who has lost his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nses, still pursuing pleasures with great mastery. The ingenious Mr. Pinkethman is a bashful rake, and is sheepish, without having modesty with great suc∣cess. Mr. Bullock succeeds Nokes in the part of Bubble, and, in my opinion, is not much below him, for he does excellently that kind of folly we call absurdity, which is the very contrary of wit; but next to that is, of all things, properest to ex∣cite mirth. What is foolish is the object of pity, but absurdity often proceeds from an op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nion of sufficiency, and consequently is an honest occasion for laughter. These characters in this play, can∣not but make it a very pleasant entertainment, and the decorations of singing and dancing, will more than repay the good-nature of those, who make an honest man a visit of two merry hours, to make his following year unpainful.'</Q></P>
<P>These are the testimonies of friendship and e∣steem, which this great author has given in favour of D'Urfey, and however his genius may be turned for the Sing-song, or Ballad, which is certainly the lowest species of poetry, yet that man cannot be termed contemptible, who was thus loved, and, though in jocular terms, praised by Mr. Addison.</P>
<P>There are few, or no particulars relating to the life of this poet preserved. He was attached to the Tory interest, and in the latter part of Queen Anne's reign frequently had the honour of di∣verting her with witty catches, and songs of hu∣mour suited to the spirit of the times. He died, according to Mr. Coxeter, February 26, 1723, in a good old age, and was buried in the Church-yard of St. James's, Westminster.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="340"/>
His dramatic works are,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Siege of Memphis, or the Ambitious Queen; a Tragedy acted at the Theatre-royal, printed in quarto 1676. Mr. Langbain says that this play is full of bombast and fustian, and observes, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That there goes more to the making a poet, than copying verses, or tagging rhimes, and recom∣mends to the modern poetasters, the following lines from a Prologue to a Play called the Atheist.'<Q><L>' Rhimsters get wit, e're ye pretend to shew it,</L>
<L>' Nor think a game at Crambo makes a poet.'</L></Q></Q></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Madam Fickle, or the Witty False One; acted at the duke of York's Theatre, printed in quarto, 1677, dedicated to the duke of Ormond. This play is compiled from several other Comedies; the scene is laid in Covent-Garden.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Trick for Trick, or the Debauched Hypocrite; a Comedy acted at the Theatre-Royal 1678: This is the only one of Fletcher's plays, called Monsieur Thomas revived.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The Fool turn'd Critic; acted at the Theatre-Royal, 1678. Several of the characters of this play are borrowed; as Old-wine-love, Trim and Small-wit, seem to be taken from Senio Asotus, and Ballio, in Randolph's Jealous Lovers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Fond Husband, or the Plotting Sisters, a Comedy. Of this we have already given some account, in the words of Mr. Addison.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Squire Old-Sap, or the Night-Adventures; a Comedy; acted at the duke's Theatre, printed in quarto, 1679. Several incidents in this play are taken from Francion's Comic. Hist. Boccace's No∣vels, les Contes de M. de la Fontaine.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. The Virtuous Wife, or Good Luck at last; a Comedy acted at the duke's Theatre 1680. Several
<PB N="338" REF="341"/>
hints are taken from the Town, Marriage A-la∣mode, &amp;c. the Scene Chelsea.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. Sir Barnaby Whig, or no Wit like a Woman's; a Comedy acted at the Theatre-Royal 1681. De∣dicated to the right honourable George Earl of Berkley. The plot of this play is taken from a Play of Marmion's, called the Fine Companion; and part from the Double Cuckold, a Novel, writ∣ten by M. St. Evremond. Scene London.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. The Royalist, a Comedy; acted at the Duke's Theatre 1682. This play, which is collected chiefly from novels, succeeded on the stage; print∣ed in 4to. 1644.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. The Injured Princess, or the Fatal Wager; a Tragi-Comedy; acted at the Theatre-Royal 1682. The foundation of this play is taken from Shakespear's Cymbeline.</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. A Common-wealth of Women, a Tragi-Comedy; acted at the Theatre-Royal 1686, dedi∣cated to Christopher Duke of Albemarle. This play is chiefly borrowed from Fletcher's Sea Voyage. The scene is in Covent-Garden.</ITEM>
<ITEM>12. The Banditti, or a Lady's Distress; a Co∣medy; acted at the Theatre-Royal 1688. This play met with great opposition during the per∣formance, which was disturbed by the Catcalls. This occasioned the author to take his revenge upon the town, by dedicating it to a certain Knight, under the title of Sir Critic Cat-call. The chief plot of this play is founded on a Romance written by Don Francisco de las Coveras, called Don Fenise, translated into English in 8vo. See the History of Don Antonio, b. iv. p. 250. The design of Don Diego's turning Banditti, and join∣ing with them to rob his supposed father, resem∣bles that of Pipperollo in Shirley's play called the Sisters. Scene Madrid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>13. A Fool'a Preferment, or the Three Dukes of Dunstable; a Comedy; acted at the Queen's Thea∣atre
<PB N="339" REF="342"/>
in Dorset-Garden 1688, dedicated to Charles Lord Morpeth, in as familiar a way as if the Au∣thor was a man of Quality. The whole play is little more than a transcript of Fletcher's Noble Gentlemen, except one scene, which is taken from a Novel called The Humours of Basset. Scene the Court, in the time of Henry IV. The songs in this play were all composed by the celebrated Musician Mr. Henry Purcell.</ITEM>
<ITEM>14. Bussy D'Amboise, or the Husband's Re∣venge; a Tragedy; acted at the Theatre-Royal, 4to. 1691, addressed to Edward Earl of Carlisle. This is a play of Mr. Chapman's revis'd, and the character of Tamyra, Mr. D'Urfey tells us, he has altered for the better. The scene Paris.</ITEM>
<ITEM>15. Love for Money, or the Boarding School; a Comedy; acted at the Theatre-Royal 1691, de∣dicated to Charles Lord Viscount Lansdown, Count of the Sacred Roman Empire, &amp;c. This play met with opposition in the first day's representa∣tion, but afterwards succeeded pretty well. The scene Chelsea.</ITEM>
<ITEM>16. The Richmond Heiress, or a Woman once in the Right; a Comedy, acted at the Theatre-Royal 1693.</ITEM>
<ITEM>17. The Marriage-Hater Matched, a Comedy; acted at the Theatre-Royal 1693, addressed to James Duke of Ormond. Mr. Charles Gildon, in an epistle prefixed to the play, tells us, that this is much the best of our author's performances. Mr. Dogget was first taken notice of as an excellent actor, from the admirable performance of his part in this play. Scene the Park, near Kensington.</ITEM>
<ITEM>18. The Comical History of Don Quixot, Part the First; acted at the Queen's Theatre in Dorset-Garden 1694, dedicated to the Duchess of Or∣mond. This play was acted with great ap∣plause; it is wholly taken from the Spanish Ro∣mance of that name. Scene M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cha in Spain.</ITEM>

<ITEM>21. The Intrigues at Versailles, or A Jilt in all Humours; a Comedy; acted at the Theatre-Roy∣al in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields 1697, dedicated to Sir Charles Sedley the Elder, Bart. and to his much honoured Friend Sir Charles Sedley, his Son. Scene Versailles. The author complains of the want of success in this play, when he asserts, the town had applauded some pieces of his of less merit. He has borrowed very liberally from a play of Mrs. Behn's called The Amorous Jilt.</ITEM>
<ITEM>22. Cynthia and Endymicn, or The Lover of the Deities, a Dramatic Opera; acted at the The∣atre-Royal 1697, dedicated to Henry Earl of Romney; this was acted with applause; and the author tells us, that King William's Queen Mary intended to have it represented at Court. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'There are many lines (says Jacob) in this play, above the genius which generally appears in the other works of this author; but he has perverted the characters of Ovid, in making Daphne, the chaste favourite of Diana, a whore, and a jilt; and fair Syrene to lose her reputation, in the unknown ignominy of an envious, mercenary, infamous woman.'</Q> Scene Ionia.</ITEM>
<ITEM>23. The Campaigners, or The Pleasant Adven∣tures at Brussels; a Comedy; with a familiar Pre∣face upon a late Reformer of the Stage, ending with a Satirical Fable of the Dog, and the Otter, 1698.

<ITEM>31. Ariadne, or The Triumph of Bacchus; the Scene Naxos, an Island in the Archipelago. These last were published with a Collection of Poems 1721.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>These are the dramatic performances of D'Urfey, by which his incessant labours for the stage are to be seen; though not one of his numerous issue is now in possession of it. He was author of ma∣ny poems, and songs, which we need not here enumerate. Mr. Coxeter takes particular notice of a piece of his called Gloriana, a Funcral Pin∣darique Poem to the memory of Queen Mary, 4to. 1695.</P>
<P>The Trophies, or Augusta's Glory; a trium∣phant Ode, made in honour of the City, and up∣on the Trophies taken from the French at the Battle of Ramillies, May 25, 1706, by the Duke of Marlborough, and fixed in Guildhall, London, dedicated to the Lord Mayor, and Court of Al∣dermen,

<HEAD>ELKANAH SETTLE,</HEAD>
<P>SON of Joseph Settle of Dunstable in Bedford∣shire, was born there; and in the 18th year of his age, 1666, was entered commoner of Trinity College, Oxon, and put under the tuition of Mr. Abraham Champion, fellow of that house; but he quitted the university without taking any degree, and came to London<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wood's Athen. Oxon. vol. ii. p. 1076.</NOTE>, where he addicted himself to the study of poetry, in which he lived to make no inconsiderable figure. Finding the nation divided between the opinions of Whig and Tory, and being sensible that a man of parts could not make any considerable figure, unless he attached himself to one of these parties; Settle thought pro∣per, on his first setting out in life, to join the Whigs, who were then, though the minor, yet a powerful party, and to support whose interest he employed his talents.</P>
<P>About the year 1680, when the debates ran high concerning the exclusion of the Duke of York from the succession, on account of his religious princi∣ples, our author wrote a piece called the Character of a Popish Successor, and what may be expected from such an one, humbly offered to the considera∣tion of both the Houses of Parliament appointed to meet at Oxon, on March 21, 1681. This essay it seems was thought of consequence enough to merit an answer, as at that time the Exclusion Bill employed the general conversation. The an∣swer
<PB N="346" REF="349"/>
to it was entitled The Character of a Re∣bellion, and what England may expect from One; printed 1682. The author of this last piece, is ve∣ry severe on the character of Settle; he represents him as an errant knave, a despicable coward, and a prophane Atheist, and seems amazed that any par∣ty should make choice of a champion, whose mo∣rals were so tainted; but as this is only the lan∣guage of party violence, no great credit is to be given to it.</P>
<P>The author of this pamphlet carries his zeal, and ill manners still further, and informs the world of the meanness of our author's birth, and education, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'most of his relations (says he) are Barbers, and of the baseness, falseness, and mutability of his nature, too many evidences may be brought. He closed with the Whigs, contrary to the principles he formerly professed, at a time when they took occasion to push their cause, upon the breaking out of Oates's plot, and was ready to fall off from, and return to them, for his own advantage.'</Q></P>
<P>To the abovementioned pamphlet, written by Set∣tle, various other answers were published, some by writers of distinction, of which Sir Roger L'Est<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ange was one; and to this performance of Sir Roger's, which was entitled The Character of a Papist in Masque∣rade, supported by Authority and Experience, Mr Settle made a Reply, entited The Character of a Popish Successor Compleat; this, in the opinion of the critics, is the smartest piece ever written upon the subject of the Exclusion Bill, and yet Sir Roger, his antagonist, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'calls it a pompous, wordy thing, made up of shifts, and suppositions, without so much as an argument, either offered, or answered in stress of the question, &amp;c.'</Q> Mr. Settle's cause was so much better than that of his antagonist's, that if he had not possessed half the powers he really did, he must have come off the conqueror, for,

who does not see the immediate danger, the fatal chances, to which a Protestant people are exposed, who have the misfortune to be governed by a Popish Prince. As the King is naturally powerful, he can easily dispose of the places of importance, and trust, so as to have them filled with creatures of his own, who will engage in any enterprize, or pervert any law, to serve the purposes of the reign∣ing Monarch. Had not the nation an instance of this, during the short reign of the very Popish Prince, against whom Settle contended? Did not judge Jeffries, a name justly devoted to everlasting infa∣my, corrupt the streams of justice, and by the most audacious cruelty, pervert the forms of law, that the blood of innocent persons might be shed, to gratify the appetite of a suspicious master? Besides, there is always a danger that the religion which the King professes, will imperceptibly diffuse itself over a nation, though no violence is used to pro∣mote it. The King, as he is the fountain of ho∣nour, so is he the fountain of fashion, and as ma∣ny people, who surround a throne, are of no reli∣gion in consequence of conviction; it is but na∣tural to suppose, that fashion would influence them to embrace the religion of the Prince, and in James II's reign, this observation was verified; for the people of fashion embraced the Popish re∣ligion so very fast, in order to please the King, that a witty knight, who then lived, and who was by his education, and principles, a Papist, being asked by a nobleman what news? he made answer, I hear no news my lord, only, God's Papists can get no preferment, because the King's Papists swarm so thick. This was a sententious, and witty ob∣servation, and it will always hold true, that the re∣ligion of the King will become the religion of people of fashion, and the lower stations ape their superiors.</P>
<P>Upon the coronation of King James II. the two Parts of the Character of a Popish Succes∣sor,
<PB N="348" REF="351"/>
were, with the Exclusion Bill, on the 23d of April, 1685, burnt by the sub-wardens, and fellows of Merton College, Oxon, in a public bonfire, made in the middle of their great qua∣drangle. During these contentions, Mr. Settle al∣so published a piece called The Medal Revers'd, published 1681; this was an answer to a poem of Dryden's called The Medal, occasioned by the bill against the earl of Shaftsbury being found ignora∣mus at the Old Baily, upon which the Whig par∣ty made bonfires, and ordered a medal to be struck in commemoration of that event. Shaftsbury, who was by his principles a Whig, and who could not but foresee the miseries which afterwards happen∣ed under a Popish Prince, opposed the succession with all his power; he was a man of very great endowments, and being of a bustling tumultuous disposition, was admirably fitted to be the head of a party. He was the leading man against the succession of the Duke of York, and argued in the House of Lords with great force against him, and what was more remarkable, sometimes in the Duke's presence. It is related, that at the Council-table, when his Majesty, and his Royal Brother were both present, something concerning the succession was canvassed, when Shaftsbury, not in the least intimidated, spoke his opinion with great vehe∣mence against the Duke, and was answered with equal heat, but with less force, by the then lord chamberlain. During this debate, the Duke took occasion to whisper the King, that his Majesty had a villain of a chancellor, to which the King mer∣rily replied, oddsfish, York, what a fool you have of a chamberlain: by which it appears, his Ma∣jesty was convinced that Shaftsbury's arguments were the strongest.</P>
<P>In consequence of Shaftsbury's violent opposition to the Duke, and the court party, there was a Bill of Indictment of High Treason, read before his
<PB N="349" REF="352"/>
Majesty's Commissioners of Oyer and Terminer in the Sessions-House at the Old Bailey, but the Ju∣ry found it Ignoramus; upon which, all the party rejoiced at the deliverance of their head. These disturbances gave Mr. Settle an opportunity to display his abilities, which he did not neglect to improve, by which means he procured so formida∣ble an antagonist as Mr. Dryden, who was obliged by his place of laureat, to speak, and write for the court. Dryden had formerly joined Mr. Set∣tle, in order to reduce the growing reputation of Shadwell, but their interest being now so opposite, they became poetical enemies, in which Settle was, no doubt, over-matched. He wrote a poem, how∣ever, called Azaria and Hushai, in five sheets, 4to. designed as an answer to Mr. Dryden's poem called Absalom and Achitophel.</P>
<P>Soon after this, if we may credit the Oxford Antiquary, Settle changed sides, and turned Tory, with as much violence as he had formerly espoused the interest of the Whigs. He published in 1683, in eight sheets in folio, a Narrative; the first part of which is concerning himself, as being of the Tory side; the second to shew the inconsistency, and contradiction of Titus Oates's Narrative of the Plot of the Popish Party, against the Life of King Charles II. at the time when that Monarch intend∣ed to alter his ministry, to have consented to the exclusion of his brother, and taken measures to sup∣port the Protestant interest. This Oates was in the reign of James II. tried, and convicted of per∣jury, upon the evidence chiefly of Papists, and had a severe sentence pronounced, and inflicted upon him, viz. Imprisonment for life, twice every year to stand on the pillory, and twice to be severely, whipt; but he received a pardon from King William, after suffering his whippings, and two years im∣prisonment, with amazing fortitude, but was never allowed again to be an evidence.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="353"/>
While Settle was engaged in the Tory party, he is said, by Wood, to have been author of Animad∣versions on the Last Speech and Confession of Wil∣liam Lord Russel, who fell a sacrifice to the Duke of York, and whose story, as related by Burnet, never fails to move the reader to tears. Also Re∣marks on Algernon Sidney's Paper, delivered to the Sheriffs at his Execution, London, 1683, in one sheet, published the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er end of December the same year. Algernon Sidney was likewise mur∣dered by the same kind of violence, which popish bigotry had lifted up against the lives of some other British worthies.</P>
<P>He also wrote a heroic poem on the Coronation of the High and Mighty Monarch James II. Lon∣don 1685, and then commenced a Journalist for the Court, and published weekly an Essay in behalf of the Administration. If Settle was capable of these mean compliances of writing for, or against a party, as he was hired, he must have possessed a very fordid mind, and been totally devoid of all principles of honour; but as there is no other au∣thority for it than Wood, who is enthusiastic in his temper, and often writes of things, not as they were, but as he would wish them to be, the read∣er may give what credit he pleases to the report.</P>
<P>Our author's dramatic works are<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Empress of Morocco, a Tragedy; acted at the Duke of York's Theatre. This play was likewise acted at court, as appears by the two Pro∣logues prefixed, which were both spoken by the Lady Elizabeth Howard; the first Prologue was written by the Earl of Mulgrave, the other by Lord Rochester; when it was performed at court, the Lords and Ladies of the Bed-chamber played in it. Mr. Dryden, Mr. Shadwell, and Mr. Crowne, wrote against it, which began a famous controver∣sy
<PB N="351" REF="354"/>
betwixt the wits of the town, wherein, says Jacob, Mr. Dryden was roughly handled, particu∣larly by the lord Rochester, and the duke of Buck∣ingham, and Settle got the laugh upon his side.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Love and Revenge, a Tragedy; acted at the Duke of York's Theatre, 4to. 1675, dedicated to William Duke of Newcastle.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Cambyses King of Persia, a Tragedy; acted at the Duke's Theatre, dedicated to Anne Duchess of Monmouth. This tragedy is written in heroic verse; the plot from Justin, lib. i. c. 9. Herodotus, &amp;c. The Scene is in Suza, and Cambyses's camp near the walls of Suza,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The Conquest of China by the Tartars, a Tragedy; acted at the Duke's Theatre, 4to. 1676, dedicated to the Right Hon. the Lord Howard of Castle rising. This play is likewise written in he∣roic verse, and founded on history.</ITEM>

<P>Our poet possessed a pension from the City Ma∣gistrates, for an annual Panegyric to celebrate the Festival of the Lord Mayor, and in consequence wrote various poems, which he calls Triumphs for the Inauguration of the Lord Mayors, which are preserved in his works, and which it would be needless to enumerate. Besides his dramatic pieces, he published many occasional poems, addressed to his patrons, and some funeral elegies on the deaths of his friends. It is certain Settle did not want learning, and, in the opinion of some critics, in the early part of his life, sometimes excelled Dry∣den; but that was certainly owing more to a pow∣er he had of keeping his temper unruffled, than any effort of genius; for between Dryden and Settle, there is as great difference, as between our modern versifiers, and Pope.</P>
<P>Whatever was the success of his poetry, he was the
<PB N="353" REF="356"/>
best contriver of machinery in England, and for ma∣ny years of the latter part of his life received an an∣nual salary from Mrs. Minns, and her daughter Mrs. Leigh, for writing Drolls for Bartholomew, and Southwark Fairs, with proper decorations. which were generally so well cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ived, that they exceeded those of their opponents in the same pro∣fession.</P>
<P>Our author died in the Charterhouse 1734; some months before his decease, he offered a play to the managers of the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane, but he lived not to introduce it on the stage; it was called The Expulsion of the Danes from Britain.</P>
