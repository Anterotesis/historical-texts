<P>THE RIVAL CANDIDATES: A COMIC OPERA In Two ACTS; AS IT IS NOW PERFORMING AT THE THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</P>
<P>By the Rev. HENRY BATE.</P>
<P>LONDON: Printed: Sold by T. BECKET, corner of the Adelphi-buildings, in the Strand; and by W. GRIFFIN, No. 6, Catharine-street, M,DCC,LXXV.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE RIVAL CANDIDATES is an attempt of the dramatic kind, undertaken by the writer from no motive of literary vanity, but in order to introduce to the world, a young musical composer, whose taste he conceived might do honour to his profession.</P>
<P>The reformer of the English drama no sooner was informed of him, than he kindly consented to an early trial of his abilities, and discovered a ge∣nerous anxiety for his success.</P>
<P>The author arrogates to himself but a moderate share of that universal applause with which his piece has been received, particularly when he re∣collects how much of it is derived from the kind attention of Mr. GARRICK, in the double capaci∣ty, of friend, and manager;—and what immense claims those respectable persons have, who fill his little canvass with such credit to themselves, and their profession. To single out any one of these celebrated performers, when all so kindly com∣bined to produce, what is deemed a striking repre∣sentation in the comic style, would be a task un∣pleasing as ungenerous. And therefore, as they have been equally zealous in their endeavours, as happy in the execution of their several characters, he wishes them, jointly to accept, the returns of a grateful heart.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERHAPS you were not aware, when you were kind enough to shew an early counte∣nance to the following <HI>petite</HI> OPERA, that so in∣dulgent an overture, entitled it in some measure to your future patronage; indeed, notwithstand∣ing this circumstance, you might probably have escaped the present mortifying situation, had not the author conceived, that his piece owes no in∣considerable share of its dramatic effect to your taste and judgment:—hence arose an appeal to his feelings, too powerful to be treated with silent indifference.—</P>
<P>I mean not, however, to alarm your delicacy, by a recital of those accomplishments, which have long rendered you an ornament of the most fashionable circles;—nor by recounting those private virtues, which stamp you one of the first patterns of domestic felicity; facts however agree∣able or instructive they might prove to society, I decline enumerating, in compliment to female diffidence.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>
Having therefore made the acknowledgement I conceive due upon this occasion, it is high time for me frankly to confess, that vanity had some influence over me, when I presumed to think of Mrs. GARRICK for the patroness of this my FIRST ESSAY.</P>

<P>I should be sufficiently repaid, Ma'm, in seeing you happy:—dear me! if he would but come now and offer himself a candidate here, we might have a snug little election of our own:—he should have my vote, and if I know any thing of eyes, I don't think, but you'd immediately return him.</P>

<P>Heavens, girl, not for the world!—after such an imprudent advance on my part, I need not wonder if a cool indifference should succeed on his: for I have been told, Jenny, that men always set a value upon a conquest, in proportion to the ease, or difficulty with which it is obtain'd:—and yet I long to see him!—but come, I am impatient to enjoy once more the beauties of nature: I am going into the drawing-room for my book; you'll find me at one of my favourite seats, where I really long to rest myself.</P>

<P>Oh! if that's all—I can punch it:—<HI>Byron</HI> for ever!—tho' he don't want a second:—he's spunk:—he can manage 'em both—No Muffs and Indigo Nabobs—<HI>Byron</HI> for ever!—</P>
<STAGE>[Exit reeling.]</STAGE>

<P>Powder and fury! I believe there's neither a brave, nor an honest man left in the kingdom.—Look you, Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> win her and wear her:—What! I suppose, I must fight this fellow myself <STAGE>(goes up to the door)</STAGE> but here he comes,—if he refuses to surrender her, put him to death!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if it must be so, it must; tho' 'pon my soul, I've no butchering ideas about me <STAGE>(half draws)</STAGE>—come, good Sir, don't put me to the fatigue of chas∣tising you.</P>

<P>No, split me if I have!—She's mine by deed of gift; if you dispute that title, she must be mine by force of arms;— <STAGE>(Draws, and puts himself in an attitude.)</STAGE></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not in the least, General, <STAGE>(confusedly)</STAGE>—I am—I am—only disconcerted a little for,—for fear of the ladies;—you saw they retired disorder'd: besides, Sir, I'm not upon an equal footing with the assassin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Byr.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more you were, when you valiantly drew

<P><STAGE>[looking earnestly at Byron]</STAGE> Damme, that's noble too! It's almost a sin to kill so fine a fellow:—but the calls of honor must be obey'd:—come, you shall settle it like soldiers however:—I little thought I should ever see another shot fired, <STAGE>(measures ten paces with his cane,</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir. Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear General, what are you about?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>About?—Why measuring the ground:—you would not fight like a couple of foot-pads, with the muzzle of the pistol in each others mouth, would you? What the devil ails you now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir. Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear General, your ear a moment <STAGE>(whis∣pering,</STAGE> my conscience forbids me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Conscience! who the devil ever heard of a man's having conscience, who had no heart?—how∣ever, Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> I see how the land lies:—You need give yourself no further concern about me or my fami∣ly:—I am determin'd to have a brave man for my son-in-law, tho' I cross the ocean for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Byr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You need not put yourself to that inconveniency, Sir, when you behold in me, one, who is ready to lay down his life in defence of your daughter's virtue, and your honor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, tho' my enemy—thou art a fine fellow I own:—and if I could forget the family grudge—</P>

<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
<SPEAKER>Byr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, Sir, I have lamented in secret the groundless animosity, that has so long subsisted be∣tween you and my father, so fatal to the early over∣tures I made the lovely <HI>Narcissa.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! but when I recollect,—to be jockey'd by you out of the borough, and by such underhand means!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Byr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, you surprize me!—they have cho∣sen that Gentleman, have they not? <STAGE>[pointing to Sir Harry.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, they have not.—what, you don't know, I suppose, that they have return'd you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Byr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my honour, no, Sir:—I have been employ'd ugon a much more agreeable service:—and to convince you of it, as they have chosen me, contrary to my wish∣es, I am ready to resign my seat in favour of any one, you shall appoint.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, you young dog:—you shan't do that neither:—I am a little cooler than I was:—that piece of still life there, has brought me to my senses: <STAGE>[pointing to Sir Harry]</STAGE> I begin now to think, that the unanimous choice of a free body of people, is too sacred, to be superceded by the will of any individual; besides your courage has charm'd me:—come, you young dog, you may release your priso∣ners, they shall be upon their parole, 'till I pass sentence. <STAGE>[Byron opens the door of the temple, and brings them a little forward.]</STAGE> You look mighty cunning, Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> after loosing <HI>Tipplewell,</HI> and the richest heiress in the county, through your delicate feelings.—damn such feelings, say I! you'll cut a pretty figure in the modern history of Maccaronyism!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, good General, you don't know me yet:—I confess I have lost a pair of pretty toys!—but with respect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a real fine gen∣tleman,
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
is infinitely beyond it's reach, I assure you:—so I shall laugh at the dinner-hunting tribe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, where the devil did this fellow spring from!— <STAGE><HI>(Byron, Jenny,</HI> and <HI>Narcissa, coming forward)</HI></STAGE>—I believe the young rogue deals in magic with both of us— <STAGE>(to <HI>Narcissa)</HI></STAGE>—come hither, girl, don't tremble so:—I begin to think, that I've held out too long with Sir Walter—and therefore I don't know how I can shew a heartier desire of reconciliation, than by rewarding his son of merit, with my only daughter and fifty thousand pounds:—What says Narcissa?—but I need not ask her!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nar.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I may discover my partiality for Mr. Byron, without offending you, Sir, I should tell you, that I have every reason in the world to admire and esteem him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come hither, then, both of you; as an earnest of my approbation, there—I've joined your hands be∣fore the parson; and may neither you, nor I live to repent it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Byr.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, Sir, is so generous, my life will be too short to repay the obligation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Demme, but I cut a pretty figure here truly!—chous'd out of my own borough, and a fine girl, by the son of a fox-hunting baronet;—and laughed at by the old Jew of a father, for endeavouring to accom∣modate him!—Well!—What's to be done?—Why, upon my arrival at Almack's, I must carry it off, for the present, by dint of bronze; tell 'em the girl was damn'd ugly; and, that the other borough had lost it's charter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Sir Harry; every man's not born to be a giant-killer;—<HI>(ironically)</HI> if it be not beneath the dignity of a fine gentleman, to rejoice at the success
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
of a worthier man than himself, adjourn with us to Worry-hall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Any thing for a frolic, General, for I'm in tip-top spirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>All that now remains, is for me to endeavour to prevail upon Sir Walter to meet us, and consent to make the little rogues happy:—for my own part, I am now fully convinced, that the tender affections were never implanted in the human breast, to be call'd forth, or suppressed, by the caprice of an unfeeling parent.</P>

<STAGE>AND SPOKEN BY MR. WESTON, <HI>Entering with a large Dog.</HI></STAGE>

<L>OH! Lud! What authors have we now adays!</L>
<L><HI>A farmer this!</HI>—Ecod or what you please:</L>
<L>He swears (tho' we've but just got thro' one sweat-o)</L>
<L>He'll make us speak an epilogue duetto.—</L>
<L>What say you <HI>Dragon?</HI>—Why's your tail so low?—</L>
<L>Be not chop-fall'n—they can't damn <HI>you,</HI> you know:—</L>
<L>What dumb my comrade?—terrible disaster;</L>
<L>So I must puff for you, and for your master.</L>
<L>Ye Gods be kind!—No cat-call interference!</L>
<L>Believe, <HI>Tom Weston,</HI> 'tis his first appearance.—</L>
</LG>

<L>You would not think it; but the rogue's so steady,</L>
<L>He's in the privy-council here, already;</L>
<L>The <HI>Prompter</HI> gives him merit universal,</L>
<L>Because— <STAGE>[whistling]</STAGE> his whistle calls him to rehearsal;</L>
<L>Besides, he imitates no tragic brother,—</L>

<L>A <HI>Dragon,</HI> once they say, kept watch and ward,</L>
<L>Some curious golden fruit from thieves to guard.</L>
<L>So to protect the poet's fruit from riot,</L>

<L>He's sent this <HI>Dragon</HI> critics!—So be quiet:</L>
<L>Sharp then's the word, my slender waisted cousins,</L>
<L>He'll swallow macaronies by the dozens!</L>
<L>Growling, and snarling,—don't let this dog catch ye,</L>
