<P>A School for Fathers. A COMIC OPERA. As it is Performed at the THEATRE-ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE. A NEW EDITION.</P>

<P>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE PHILIP EARL OF CHESTERFIELD, THIS OPERA IS INSCRIBED, BY HIS MOST OBEDIENT, MOST OBLIGED, AND MOST GRATEFUL HUMBLE SERVANT, THE AUTHOR.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING, for some years, met with very great success in my productions of the musical kind; when I wrote the following Opera, it was with unusual care and attention; and it was the general opinion of my friends, some of whom rank among the best judges, that of all my trifles, Lionel and Clarissa was the most pardonable; a decision in its favour which I was the prouder of, because, to the best of my knowledge, through the whole, I had not borrowed an expression, a sentiment, or a character, from any dramatic writer extant.</P>
<P>When Mr. GARRICK thought of performing this piece at Drury-lane Theatre, he had a new singer to bring out, and every thing possible for her advantage was to be done; this necessarily occasioned some new songs and airs to be introduced; and other singers, with voices of a different compass from those who originally acted the parts, occasioned still more; by which means the greatest part of the music unavoidably became new. This is the chief, and indeed the only alteration made in the Opera; and even to that, I should in many places have been forced, much against my will, had it not given a fresh opportunity to Mr. Dibdin to dis∣play his admirable talents as a musical composer. And I will be bold to say, that his airs, serious and comic, in this Opera, will appear to no disadvantage by being heard with those of some of the greatest masters.</P>

<P>A fine girl, Mr. Jenkins, a devilish fine girl! she has got my eye to a twinkle. There's fire for

you—spirit!—I design to marry her to a duke. How much money do you think a duke would expect with such a wench?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Colonel, with submission, I think there is no occasion to go out of our own county here; we have never a Duke in it, I believe, but we have many an honest gentleman, who, in my opinion, might deserve the young lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you would have me marry Dy to a country 'squire, eh! How say you to this, Dy? would not you rather be married to a Duke?</P>

<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but listen to me, papa—When you go out with your gun, do you take any pleasure in shoot∣ing the poor tame ducks, and chickens in your yard? No; the partridge, the pheasant, the woodcock are the game! there is some sport in bringing them down, because they are wild; and it is just the same with an husband or a lover. I would not waste powder and shot to wound one of your sober pretty behaved gen∣tlemen; but to hit a libertine, extravagant, madcap fellow, to take him upon the wing—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you hear her, Mr. Jenkins? ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but, good colonel, what do you say to my worthy and honourable patron here, Sir John Flowerdale? He has an estate of eight thousand pounds a-year as well paid rents as any in the kingdom, and but one only daughter to enjoy it; and yet he is will∣ing, you see, to give this daughter to your son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Mr. Jenkins, how does Miss Clarissa and our university friend Mr. Lionel? That is the only
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
grave young man I ever liked, and the only handsome one I ever was acquainted with, that did not make love to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Mr. Jenkins, who is this Lionel? They say he is a damn'd witty knowing fellow; and egad, I think him well enough for one brought up in a col∣lege.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>His father was a general officer, a particular friend of Sir John's, who, like many more brave men, that live and die in defending their country, left little else than honour behind him. Sir John sent this young man, at his own expence, to Oxford; where, while, his son lived, they were upon the same footing: And since our young gentleman's death, which you know unfortunately happened about two years ago, he has continued him there. During the vacation, he is come to pay us a visit; and Sir John intends that he shall shortly take orders, for a very considerable benefice in the gift of the family, the present incumbent of which is an aged man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>The last time I was at your house, he was teaching Miss Clarissa mathematics and philosophy. Lord, what a strange brain I have! If I was to sit down to distract myself with such studies—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go, hussey, let some of your brother's rascals inform their master that he has been long enough at his toilet; here is a message from Sir John Flowerdale—You a brain for mathematics indeed! We shall have women wanting to head our regiments to-morrow or next day.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Mr. Jenkins! don't you think now that a Nobleman, a Duke, an Earl, or a Marquis, might be content to share his title—I say, you under∣stand me—with a sweetener of thirty or forty thousand pounds, to pay off mortgages? Besides, there's a pro∣spect of my whole estate; for, I dare swear, her bro∣ther will never have any children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be concerned at that, Colonel, when there are two such fortunes to descend to his heirs, as yours and Sir John Flowerdale's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look you, Mr. Jenkins, Sir John Flowerdale is an honest gentleman; our families are nearly related; we have been neighbours time out of mind; and if he and I have an odd dispute now and then, it is not for want of a cordial esteem at bottom. He is going to marry his daughter to my son; she is a beautiful girl, an elegant girl, a sensible girl, a worthy girl, and—a word in your ear—damn me, if I an't very sorry for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sorry! Colonel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay—between ourselves, Mr. Jenkins, my son won't do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, Mr. Jenkins, he won't do—he is not the thing, a prig—At sixteen years old, or there∣abouts, he was a bold, sprightly boy, as you should see in a thousand; could drink his pint of port, or his bottle of claret—now he mixes all his wine with water.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh; if that be his only fault, Colonel, he will never make the worse husband, I'll answer for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know my wife is a woman of quality—I was prevailed upon to send him to be brought up by her brother Lord Jessamy, who had no children of his own, and promised to leave him an estate—he has got the estate indeed; but the fellow has taken his Lordship's name for it. Now, Mr. Jenkins, I would be glad to know, how the name of Jessamy is better than that of Oldboy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! but Colonel, it is allowed on all hands that his Lordship has given your son an excellent edu∣cation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! he sent him to the university, and to travel forsooth; but what of that? I was abroad, and at the university myself, and never a rush the better for either. I quarrelled with his Lordship about six years before his death, and so had not an opportunity of seeing how the youth went on; if I had, Mr. Jenkins, I would no more have suffered him to be made such a monkey of—He has been in my house but three days, and it is all turned topsy-turvy by him and his rascally servants—then his chamber is like a perfumer's shop with wash-balls, pastes, and pomatum—and do you know he had the impudence to tell me yesterday at my own table, that I did not know how to behave myself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Colonel, how does my Lady Mary?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, my wife? In the old way, Mr. Jenkins; always complaining; ever something the matter with
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
her head, or her back, or her legs—but we have had the devil to pay lately—she and I did not speak to one another for three weeks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little affair of jealousy—you must know my gamekeeper's daughter has had a child, and the plaguy baggage takes it into her head to lay it to me—Upon my soul, it is a fine fat chubby infant as ever I set my eyes on; I have sent it to nurse; and, between you and me, I believe I shall leave it a for∣tune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Colonel, you will never give over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know my Lady has a pretty vein of poetry; she writ me an heroic epistle upon it, where she calls me her dear false Damon; so I let her cry a little, promised to do so no more, and now we are as good friends as ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Colonel, I must take my leave; I have delivered my message, and Sir John may expect the pleasure of your company to dinner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, we'll come—pox o' ceremony among friends. But won't you stay to see my son? I have sent to him, and suppose he will be here as soon as his valet-de-chambre will give him leave.</P>
</SP>

<P>There is no occasion, good Sir: present my humble respects, that's all.</P>

<P>Well, but, zounds, Jenkins, you must not go till you drink something—let you and I have a bottle of hock—</P>

<P>Not for the world, Colonel; I never touch any thing strong in the morning.</P>

<P>Never touch anything strong! Why, one bottle won't hurt you, man! this is old, and as mild as milk.</P>

<P>That's an exceeding fine China jar your Ladyship has got in the next room; I saw the fellow of it the other day at William's, and will send to my agent to purchase it: it is the true matchless old blue and white. Lady Betty Barebones has a couple that she gave an hundred guineas for, on board an India∣man; but she reckons them at a hundred and twenty-five, on account of half a dozen of plates, four nankeen beakers, and a couple of shaking Mandarins, that the custom-house officers took from under her petticoats.</P>

<P>And has not a bit of the genius of our fa∣mily, and I never knew a woman of it but herself with∣out.

<P>Upon my word, Sir, I have been so long from the university, that it is time for me to think of returning. It is true, I have no absolute studies; but, really, Sir, I shall be obliged to you, if you will give me leave to go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, my dear Lionel, I have for some time observed a more than ordinary gravity grow∣ing upon you, and I am not to learn the reason of it: I know, to minds serious, and well inclined, like yours, the sacred function you are about to embrace—</P>

<P>Fie, fie! no more of them. By my last letters, I find that my old friend the Rector, still con∣tinues in good health, considering his advanced years. You may imagine I am far from desiring the death of so worthy and pious a man; yet I must own, at this time, I could wish you were in orders, as you might then perform the ceremony of my daughter's marriage; which would give me a secret satisfaction.</P>

<P>No doubt, Sir, any office in my power that could be instrumental to the happiness of any of your family, I should perform with pleasure.</P>

<P>Why, really, Lionel, from the character of her intended husband, I have no room to doubt, but this match will make Clarissa perfectly happy: to be sure, the alliance is the most eligible for both families.</P>

<P>The fondness of a father is always su∣spected of partiality; yet, I believe, I may venture to say, that few young women will be found more unex∣ceptionable than my daughter: her person is agreeable, her temper sweet, her understanding good; and, with the obligations she has to your instruction—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do my endeavours too much honour, Sir; I have been able to add nothing to Miss Flower∣dale's accomplishments, but a little knowledge in mat∣ters of small importance to a mind already so well im∣proved.</P>

<P>I don't think so; a little knowledge, even in those matters, is necessary for a woman, in whom I am far from considering ignorance as a desireable

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but Mr. Lionel, consider, pray consi∣der now; how can you be so purdigious undiscreet as you are, walking about the hall here, while the gen∣tlefolks are within in the parlour? Don't you think they'll wonder at your getting up so soon after dinner, and before any of the rest of the company?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>For Heaven's sake, Jenny, don't speak to me: I neither know where I am, nor what I am doing; I am the most wretched and miserable of all mankind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor dear soul, I pity you. Yes, yes, I believe you are miserable enough indeed; and I assure you, I have pitied you a great while, and spoke many a word in your favour; when you little thought you had such a friend in a corner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, good Jenny, since by some accident or other, you have been able to discover what I would willingly hide from all the world; I conjure you, as you regard my interest, as you value your Lady's peace and honour, never let the most distant hint of it escape you; for it is a secret of that importance—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, perhaps, you think I can't keep a secret. Ah! Mr. Lionel, it must be hear, see, and say nothing in this world, or one has no business to live in it: be∣sides who would not be in love with my Lady? There's never a man this day alive but might be proud of it; for she is the handsomest, sweetest temperdest! And I am sure one of the best mistresses ever poor girl had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Jenny! she's an angel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so she is indeed—Do you know that she gave me her blue and silver sack to-day, and it is every crum as good as new; and, go things as they will, don't you be fretting and vexing yourself, for I am mortally sartain she would liverer see a toad than this Jessamy. Though I must say, to my thinking, he's a very likely man; and a finer pair of eye-brows, and a more delicater nose I never saw on a face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>By Heavens, I shall run mad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why so? It is not beauty that always takes the fancy: Moreover, to let you know, if it was, I don't think him any more to compare to you, than a thistle is to a carnation: and so's a sign; for, mark my words, my Lady loves you as much as she hates him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you tell me, Jenny, is a thing I neither merit or expect: No, I am unhappy; and let me con∣tinue so: my most presumptuous thoughts shall never carry me to a wish that may affect her quiet, or give her cause to repent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very honourable of you, I must needs say; but for all that, liking's liking, and one can't help it; and if it should be my Lady's case, it is no fault of yours. I am sure, when she called me into her dressing-room, before she went down to dinner, there she stood with her eyes brim full of tears; and so I fell a-crying for company—and then she said, she could not abide the chap in the parlour; and at the same time, she bid me take an opportunity to speak to you, and de∣sire you wou'd meet her in the garden this evening after tea; for she has something to say to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Jenny, I see you are my friend: for which I thank you, though I know it is impossible to do me any service; take this ring, and wear it for my sake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very much obliged to your honour; I am your friend indeed—but, I say, you won't forget to be in the garden now; and in the mean time keep as little in the house as you can, for walls have eyes and ears; and I can tell you, the servants take notice of your uneasiness, tho' I am always desiring them to mind their business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray have a care, Jenny, have a care my dear girl; a word may breed suspicion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! have a care yourself; it is you that breeds suspicion, sighing and pining about; you look for all the world like a ghost; and if you don't pluck up your spirits, you will be a ghost soon; letting things get the better of you. Though to be sure, when I thinks with myself, being cross'd in love is a terrible thing—There was a young man in the town where I was born made away with himself upon account of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Things shan't get the better of me, Jenny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more they don't ought. And once again say, fortune is thrown in your dish, and you are not to fling it out; my Lady's estate will be better than three bishopricks, if Sir John could give them to you. Think of that, Mr. Lionel, think of that.</P>
</SP>

<P>Think of what.</P>

<L>O talk not to me of the wealth she possesses,</L>

<P>Mr. Oldboy, won't you give me your hand to lead me up stairs, my dear?—Sir, I am pro∣digiously obliged to you; I protest I have not been so well, I don't know when: I have had no return of my bilious complaint after dinner to-day; and ate so vora∣ciously! Did you observe, Miss? the whole wing of a partridge! Dr. Arsnic will be quite astonished when he hears it; surely his new invented medicine has done me a prodigious deal of service.</P>

<P>It brought Sir Barnaby Drugg from death's door, after having tried the Spaw and Bristol waters without effect: it is good for several things; in many, sovereign, as in colds and consumptions, and lowness of spirits; it corrects the humours, rectifies the juices, regulates the nervous system; creates an appetite, pre∣vents flushings and sickness after meals; as also vain fears and head-achs; it is the finest thing in the world for an asthma: and no body that takes it, is ever troubled with hysterics.</P>

<P>Hush, my dear Colonel! don't mention it; to be sure, the circumstance was vastly indelicate; but for the number of lines, the poem was as charm∣ing a morsel—I heard the Earl of Punley say, who understood Latin, that it was equal to any thing in Catullus.</P>

<P>Then, Mr. Jenkins, I shall condescend to speak to you. Does your master know who I am? Does he know, Sir, that I am likely to be a Peer of Great-Britain? That I have ten thousand pounds a-year; that I have passed through all Europe with dis∣tinguished eclat; that I refused the daughter of Myn∣heer Van Slokenfolk, the great Dutch Burgomaster; and, that, if I had not had the misfortune of being bred a protestant, I might have married the niece of his present holiness the Pope; with a fortune of two hundred thousand piastres?</P>

<P>Then, Sir, how comes he, after my shewing an inclination to be allied to his family; how comes he, I say, to bring me to his house to be affronted?

<P>Was ever such a wretch!—I can't stay a mo∣ment in a place; where is my repose?—fled with my virtue. Was I then born for falsehood and dissimula∣tion? I was, I was, and live to be conscious of it! To impose upon my friend! to betray my benefactor, and lie to hide my ingratitude▪—a monster in a moment—No; I may be the most unfortunate of men, but I will not be the most odious; while my heart is yet capable of dictating what is honest, I will obey its voice.</P>

<P>I am afraid of the step we are going to take; indeed, I am: 'tis true, my father is the contriver of it; but, really, on consideration, I think I should appear less culpable, if he was not so; I am at once criminal myself, and rendering him ridiculous.</P>

<P>Why, Sir John gave it to me, to deliver to my uncle Jenkins, and I took it down to his house; but while we were talking together, he remembered that he had some business with Sir John, so he desired me to bring it; because he said it was not proper to be sent by any of the common servants.</P>

<P>So then, the mystery is discovered:—but is it possible that my daughter's refusal of Colonel Old∣boy's son should procced from a clandestine engage∣ment, and that engagement with Lionel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>My niece, Sir, is in her young Lady's secrets, and Lord knows she had little design to betray them; but having remarked some odd expressions of her's yesterday, when she came down to me this morning with the letter, I questioned her; and, in short, drew the whole affair out; upon which I feigned a recollec∣tion of some business with you, and desired her to carry the letter to Colonel Oldboy's herself, while I came up hither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jo.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they are mutually promised to each other, and that promise was exchanged yesterday?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, and it is my duty to tell you; else I would rather die than be the means of wounding the heart of my dear young lady: for if there is one upon earth of truly noble and delicate sentiments—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought so once, Jenkins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>And think so still: O good Sir John, now is the time for you to exert that character of worth and gentleness which the world so deservedly has given you. You have indeed cause to be offended; but consider, Sir, your daughter is young, beautiful, and amiable; the poor youth unexperienced, sensible, and at a time of life when such temptations are hard to be resisted; their opportunities were many, their cast of thinking the same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Jenkins, I can allow for all these things; but the young hypocrites—There's the thing, Jenkins; their hypocrisy, their hypocrisy wounds me.</P>

<P>Call it by a gentler name, Sir; modesty on her part, apprehension on his.</P>

<P>Then what opportunity have they had? They never were together but when my sister or myself made one of the company; besides, I had so firm a re∣liance on Lionel's honour and gratitude—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I can never think that Nature stamp'd that gracious countenance of his, to mask a corrupt heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jo.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! at the very time that he was consci∣ous of being himself the cause of it, did he not shew more concern at this affair than I did? Nay, don't I tell you that last night, of his own accord, he offered to be a mediator in the affair, and desired my leave to speak to my daughter? I thought myself obliged to him, consented; and in consequence of his assurance of suc∣cess, wrote that letter to Colonel Oldboy, to desire the family would come here again to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, as we were standing in the next room, I heard a message delivered from Mr. Lionel, desiring leave to wait upon your daughter; I dare swear they will be here presently; suppose we were to step into that closet, and overhear their conversation?</P>

<P>'Tis I, only I, am to blame; while I took advantage of the father's security, I practised upon the tenderness and ingenuity of the daughter; my own imagination gone astray, I artfully laboured to lead yours after it: but here, Madam, I give you back those vows which I insidiously extorted from you; keep them for some happier man, who may receive them without wounding his honour, or his peace.</P>

<P>Oh! rot your fortune, I don't mind that—I know you are a gentleman, or Dick Rantum would not have recommended you. And so, Dy, kiss and friends.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Jess.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Sir, have you no more to say to the man who has used you so ill?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Us'd me ill!—That's as I take it—he has done a mettled thing; and, perhaps, I like him the better for it; it's long before you would have spirit enough to run away with a wench—Harman, give me your hand; let's hear no more of this now.</P>

<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am so bound by your generosity, Sir—</P>

<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<L>Come then, all ye social pow'rs,</L>
<L>Shed your infiuence o'er us,</L>
<L>Crown with bliss the present hours,</L>
<L>And lighten those before us.</L>

<L>Still see that you regard 'em;</L>
<L>And Lionels for ever find,</L>

<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<L>Love, thy godhead I adore,</L>
<L>Source of sacred passion;</L>
<L>But will never bow before</L>
<L>Those idols, Wealth, or Fashion.</L>
<L>May, like me, each maiden wise,</L>
<L>From the fop defend her;</L>
<L>Learning, sense, and virtue prize,</L>
<L>And scorn the vain pretender!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jess.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why the deuce should men be sad,</L>
<L>While in time we moulder?</L>
<L>Grave, or gay, or vex'd, or glad,</L>
<L>We ev'ry day grow older.</L>
<L><PB N="77" REF="84"/>
Bring the flask, the music bring,</L>
<L>Joy will quickly find us;</L>
<L>Drink, and laugh, and dance, and sing,</L>
<L>And cast our cares behind us.</L>

<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<L>How shall I escape—so naught,</L>
<L>On filial laws to trample?</L>
<L>I'll e'en curtsey, own my fault,</L>
<L>And plead papa's example.</L>
<L>Parents, 'tis a hint to you,</L>
<L>Children oft are shameless;</L>
<L>Oft transgress—the thing's▪ too true—</L>
<L>But are you always blameless?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<L>One word more before we go;</L>
<L>Girls and boys have patience;</L>
<L>You to friends must something owe,</L>
<L>As well as to relations.</L>
<L>These kind gentlemen address—</L>
<L>What tho' we forgave 'em,</L>
<L>Still they must be lost, unless</L>
<L>You lend a hand to save 'em.</L>
