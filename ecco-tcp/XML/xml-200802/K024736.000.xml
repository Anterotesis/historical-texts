<L>'TWAS Night; the Voice of Jollity was hush'd,</L>
<L>Doz'd all her Vot'ries, reasonably flush'd;</L>
<L>Song, Argument, Invention, Laughter, Jest,</L>
<L>Wit, Bawdry, Criticism, sunk to rest:</L>
<L N="5"><HI>Scandal</HI> had empty'd all his Tub on BUTE,</L>
<L>Abuse of <HI>Royalty</HI> itself was mute.</L>
<L><HI>Sleep</HI> in his pleasing Bands had all things ty'd,</L>
<L>All but the Eyes of disappointed PRIDE.</L>

She lay revolving in her anxious mind,</L>
<L N="10">How <HI>Resignation</HI> had too much resign'd;</L>
<L>That Places were dispens'd as others will'd,</L>
<L>Made vacant some, and Vacancies were fill'd;</L>
<L>New Statesmen at the Helm usurp'd her Trade,</L>
<L>And glibly sail'd the Ship without her Aid.</L>
<L N="15">Seeking Repose from Side to Side she flings,</L>
<L>No Change of Posture Pause of Anguish brings.</L>
<L>Each grinding Thought Alleviation scorns,</L>
<L>And sharpens all the Goose-down into Thorns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Forth from the loathed Bed in haste she flew,</L>
<L N="20">And round her weary'd Limbs her Vestments threw.</L>
<L>Enwrought with Gold, in Lelac Purple dy'd,</L>
<L>The Velvet cas'd her endless Length of Side.</L>
<L>Two calveless Bags of Silk then stretch'd to see</L>
<L>If they could reach from Heel to distant Knee.</L>
<L N="25"><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
Next Splay-foot Shoes she to her Insteps girt,</L>
<L>Shoes which disdain'd, yet still were doom'd to Dirt;</L>
<L>Her Thigh sustain'd a Sword unknown to War,</L>
<L>And beam'd upon her Breast a Silver Star,</L>
<L>Whose Rays with magic Influence could warm</L>
<L N="30">Almost to Consequence the languid Form.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Accoutred thus, forth of her Doors she went,</L>
<L>And her dark Visit was to FACTION bent;</L>
<L>Resolv'd, like Heav'n-rejected <HI>Saul,</HI> to try</L>
<L>What Counsel t'other Party might supply.</L>
<L N="35">Onward she strides, impatient of Delay,</L>
<L>Flound'ring thro' ev'ry Kennel in her Way;</L>
<L>Save that at <HI>Charing-cross</HI> she slack'd her Tread,</L>
<L>And thought she saw poor <HI>Charles</HI> without his Head.</L>
<L>Re-hast'ning on thro' the long <HI>Strand</HI> she came,</L>
<L N="40">Then pass'd the <HI>Temple,</HI> and ador'd its Name;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Now reach'd St. <HI>Paul's,</HI> and bless'd the Lord that there</L>
<L>Tho' He was prais'd, 'twas with unwilling Pray'r.</L>
<L>Next in a grateful Rapture stretch'd to <HI>Bow,</HI></L>
<L>And heard th' <HI>unmuffled</HI> Tongue of Night strike Two.</L>
<L N="45">Acknowledging the Omen, she advanc'd,</L>
<L>While sudden Vigour thro' each Sinew danc'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>High on a hundred Columns, whose dead Weight</L>
<L>Presses the rustic Base in aukward State,</L>
<L>Where hardly they sustain, their Shafts unbent,</L>
<L N="50">The Load of Cornice, and of Pediment</L>
<L>Which rough with Sculpture in strong Emblem clad,</L>
<L>Tells us, That Riches make a City mad;</L>
<L>The pond'rous Mansion-house of FACTION stands,</L>
<L>Rais'd by o'er-reaching Heads and griping Hands.</L>

<L N="55">Before the Gate, a Giant fierce and fell,</L>

<L>A Friend, <HI>she said,</HI> to Denmark, not the Dane.</L>
<L>Her well-known Voice he recollected strait,</L>
<L N="60">Quick every Bolt shoots backward on the Gate,</L>
<L>Bolts to endure which never own'd the Pow'r,</L>
<L>But only made to serve the present Hour,</L>
<L>And yet the very best, for Strength and Size,</L>
<L>The Blacksmith's <HI>Place</HI> and <HI>Pension</HI> could devise.</L>
</LG>

<L N="65">Of canker'd Brass and rusty Ir'n each Door,</L>
<L>Stood massive, spirtled thick with human Gore,</L>
<L>Which Popularity for ever draws</L>
<L>From Fools, in Patriot-Rebellion's Cause.</L>
<L>Open they burst, with desperate Recoil,</L>
<L N="70">The jarring Hinges scream for want of Oil,</L>

Loud and discordant, as when Civil Rage</L>
<L>Incites two kindred Armies to engage.</L>

<L>And aided its hoarse Thunder with her Voice:</L>
<L>At once her Cyders sour, and all around</L>
<L N="80">Her Apple-blossoms strew the blushing Ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now, where yawn'd the Portal rude and vast,</L>
<L>To FACTION'S Residence the Goddess past.</L>
<L>Close to the Door, in the first Vestibule,</L>
<L><HI>Sat</HI> Clamour, Riot, Insult, <HI>and</HI> Misrule,</L>

<L>A thousand Voices bellow through the Room,</L>
<L>A thousand Echoes clatter 'gainst the Dome;</L>
<L>Copious, but unconnected Eloquence,</L>

<L>There might be heard, 'midst other piercing Cries,</L>
