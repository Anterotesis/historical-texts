<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>TO those who are not conversant in the history of the Asiatic nations, it may not be improper to give in brief, the story upon which the Tragedy of Zingis is founded, as it is taken from the TARICH MOGULISTAN, or History of the Mogul Tartars, written in the Per∣sian language.</P>
<P>In the twelfth century, most of the Tartar Ordas, or tribes, though governed by their own chiefs, paid tribute to the king of the Orda of the Keraits, who held his court under the title of the GRAND CHAN, in the city of Caracorum, well known since by the name of Orda∣balich. The famous Zingis Chan, who afterwards con∣quered all the countries from the sea of Canton in China to the Nile, was prince of the Niron tribe of Tartars; and from his early youth, served in the armies of Aunac, the Grand Chan; and at last rose to the command of all his forces. Zemouca, chief of the Siogarates, supplanted Zingis in Aunac's favor. Zingis was disgraced. He retired to his Orda, which was in some measure indepen∣dent of the Grand Chan. Aunac pursued Zingis with a small force, and was defeated. In the ensuing year Aunac was, in a pitched battle, totally routed by Zingis; Zangon the prince royal was slain, and the only daughter of Aunac, Ovisa Lugîn, fell into the conqueror's hands. Zingis having determined to give Ovisa in marriage to his favorite son Octar, who afterwards succeeded him in the empire of all Asia, occasioned an insurrection under Timur, another of his sons, who was in love with the princess. Timur fell in his rebellion, Ovisa died of grief, and the unfortunate monarch, Aunac, was killed in his flight, from an action, in which he was defeated by a part of the army of Zingis.</P>
<P>Zingis Chan, whether we regard him as a conqueror or legislator, was, perhaps, the greatest prince, that ever appeared in history. He not only secured the em∣pire of all Asia to his posterity for some ages, but even to
<PB REF="4"/>
this day, two-thirds of that immense continent remains in the possession of princes of his blood. So fortunate was he in his children and descendents, that many of them did not yield in abilities to him; and they would, per∣haps, have equalled him in fame, had his sword left them more to conquer.—The Emperor of China, the Mogul of India, the great Chan of Tartary, and the princes of the Krim Tartars, derive their blood from Zingis; and it is remarkable that, at one period, there were five hundred crowned heads of his race in Asia.</P>

<L>TOO much the Greek and Roman chiefs engage</L>
<L>The Muses care,—they languish on our Stage;</L>
<L>The Modern Bard, struck with the vast applause</L>
<L>Of ancient masters, like the painter draws</L>
<L>From models only;—can such copies charm</L>
<L>The heart, or like the glow of nature warm?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To fill the scene, to night our Author brings</L>
<L>Originals at least,—warriors and kings—</L>
<L>Heroes, who like their gems, unpolish'd shine,</L>
<L>The mighty fathers of the Tartar line;</L>
<L>Greater than those, whom Classic pages boast,</L>
<L>If those are greatest, who have conquer'd most.</L>

<LG>
<L>Such is the subject—such the Poet's theme,</L>
<L>If a rough Soldier may assume that name;</L>
<L>Who does not offer you from Fancy store,</L>
<L>Manners and men.—On India's burning shore,</L>
<L>In warlike toils, he pass'd his youthful years,</L>
<L>And met the Tartar, in the strife of spears;</L>
<L>But tho' he liv'd amidst the cannons roar,</L>
<L>Thunder like yours he never fac'd before;</L>
<L>Listen indulgent to his artless strain,</L>
<L>Nor let a Soldier, quarter ask in vain.</L>

<L>He, jealous of the fame and deeds of Zingis,</L>
